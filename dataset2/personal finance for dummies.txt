Eric Tyson’s Keys to Personal 
Financial Success
» Take charge of your finances. Procrastinating is detrimental to your 
long-term financial health. Don’t wait for a crisis or major life event to get 
your act together. Read this book and start implementing a plan now!
» Don’t buy consumer items (cars, clothing, vacations, and so on) that lose 
value over time on credit. Use debt only to make investments in things that 
gain value, such as real estate, a business, or an education.
» Use credit cards only for convenience, not for carrying debt. If you tend to 
run up credit-card debt, then get rid of your cards and use only cash, checks, 
and debit cards.
» Live within your means and don’t try to keep up with your co-workers, 
neighbors, and peers. Many who engage in conspicuous consumption are 
borrowing against their future; some end up bankrupt.
» Save and invest at least 5 to 10 percent of your income. Preferably, invest 
through a retirement savings account to reduce your taxes and ensure your 
future financial independence.
» Understand and use your employee benefits. If you’re self-employed, find 
the best investment and insurance options available to you and use them.
» Research before you buy. Never purchase a financial product or service on 
the basis of an advertisement or salesperson’s solicitation.
» Avoid financial products that carry high commissions and expenses.
Companies that sell their products through aggressive sales techniques 
generally have the worst financial products and the highest fees and 
commissions.
» Don’t purchase any financial product that you don’t understand. Ask 
questions and compare what you’re being offered to what you can get from 
the best sources, which I recommend in this book.
» Invest the majority of your long-term money in ownership vehicles that 
have appreciation potential, such as stocks, real estate, and your own 
business. When you invest in bonds or bank accounts, you’re simply lending 
your money to others, and the return you earn probably won’t keep you 
ahead of inflation and taxes.
» Avoid making emotionally based financial decisions. For example, 
investors who panic and sell their stock holdings after a major market 
correction miss a buying opportunity. Be especially careful in making impor￾tant financial decisions after a major life change, such as a divorce, job loss, or 
death in your family.» Make investing decisions based upon your needs and the long-term 
fundamentals of what you’re buying. Ignore the predictive advice offered 
by financial prognosticators — nobody has a working crystal ball. Don’t make 
knee-jerk decisions based on news headlines.
» Own your home. In the long run, owning is more cost-effective than renting, 
unless you have a terrific rent-control deal. But don’t buy until you can stay 
put for a number of years.
» Purchase broad insurance coverage to protect against financial catastro￾phes. Eliminate insurance for small potential losses.
» If you’re married, make time to discuss joint goals, issues, and concerns.
Be accepting of your partner’s money personality; learn to compromise and 
manage as a team.
» Prepare for life changes. The better you are at living within your means and 
anticipating life changes, the better off you will be financially and emotionally.
» Read publications that have high quality standards and that aren’t 
afraid to take a stand and recommend what’s in your best interests.
Avoid those that base their content on the hottest financial headlines or the 
whims of advertisers.
» Prioritize your financial goals and start working toward them. Be patient. 
Focus on your accomplishments and learn from your mistakes.
» Hire yourself first. You are the best financial person that you can hire. If you 
need help making a major decision, hire conflict-free advisors who charge a 
fee for their time. Work in partnership with advisors — don’t abdicate control.
» Invest in yourself and others. Invest in your education, your health, and 
your relationships with family and friends. Having a lot of money isn’t worth 
much if you don’t have your health and people with whom to share your life. 
Give your time and money to causes that better our society and world.
Praise for Eric Tyson
“Eric Tyson is doing something important — namely, helping people at all income 
levels to take control of their financial futures. This book is a natural outgrowth of 
Tyson’s vision that he has nurtured for years. Like Henry Ford, he wants to make 
something that was previously accessible only to the wealthy accessible to 
middle-income Americans.”
— James C. Collins, co-author of the national bestsellers Built to Last and Good 
to Great“Personal Finance For Dummies is the perfect book for people who feel guilty about 
inadequately managing their money but are intimidated by all of the publications 
out there. It’s a painless way to learn how to take control.”
— Karen Tofte, producer, National Public Radio’s Sound Money
“Eric Tyson . . . seems the perfect writer for a . . . For Dummies book. He doesn’t tell 
you what to do or consider doing without explaining the why’s and how’s — and 
the booby traps to avoid — in plain English. . . . It will lead you through the thick￾ets of your own finances as painlessly as I can imagine.”
— Chicago Tribune
“This book provides easy-to-understand personal financial information and 
advice for those without great wealth or knowledge in this area. Practitioners like 
Eric Tyson, who care about the well-being of middle-income people, are rare in 
today’s society.”
— Joel Hyatt, founder of Hyatt Legal Services, one of the nation’s largest general￾practice personal legal service firms
“Worth getting. Scores of all-purpose money-management books reach book￾stores every year, but only once every couple of years does a standout personal 
finance primer come along. Personal Finance For Dummies, by financial counselor 
and columnist Eric Tyson, provides detailed, action-oriented advice on everyday 
financial questions. . . . Tyson’s style is readable and unintimidating.”
— Kristin Davis, Kiplinger’s Personal Finance magazine
“This is a great book. It’s understandable. Other financial books are too technical 
and this one really is different.”
— Business Radio Network

Introduction
Welcome to Personal Finance For Dummies, 10th Edition! More than 
two million copies of prior editions of this book were bought, and read￾ers and reviewers alike have been pleased. This book also previously 
earned the prestigious Benjamin Franklin Award for best book of the year in busi￾ness. However, I never rest on my laurels. So the book you hold in your hands 
reflects more hard work and brings you the freshest material for addressing your 
personal financial quandaries.
You’re probably not a personal finance expert, for good reason. Historically, 
Personal Finance 101 hasn’t been offered in our schools — not in high school, 
college, or even graduate programs. Thankfully, a growing number of schools are 
offering basic personal-finance-type courses; some even use Personal Finance For 
Dummies as a textbook.
However, even if you got some financial education and acquired some financial 
knowledge over the years (most likely from a wise family member or friend), you’re 
likely a busy person who doesn’t have enough hours in the day to get everything done. 
Thus, you want to know how to diagnose your financial situation efficiently (and 
painlessly) to determine what you should do next. Unfortunately, after figuring out 
which financial strategies make sense for you, choosing specific financial products in 
the marketplace is often overwhelming. You have literally thousands of investment, 
insurance, and loan options to choose from. Talk about information overload!
To further complicate matters, you probably hear about most products through 
advertising that can be misleading, if not downright false. Of course, some ethical 
and outstanding firms advertise, but so do those that are more interested in con￾verting your hard-earned income and savings into their short-term profits. And 
they may not be here tomorrow when you need them.
Despite the development of new media and new financial products and services, 
folks keep making the same common financial mistakes — procrastinating and 
lack of planning, wasteful spending, falling prey to financial salespeople and 
pitches, failing to do sufficient research before making important financial deci￾sions, and so on. This book can keep you from falling into the same traps and get 
you going on the best paths.
As unfair as it may seem, numerous pitfalls await you when you seek help for 
your financial problems. The world is filled with biased and bad financial advice. 2 Personal Finance For Dummies
As a practicing financial counselor and now as a writer, I constantly see and hear 
about the consequences of poor advice. All too often, financial advice ignores the 
big picture and focuses narrowly on investing.
Because money is not an end in itself but a part of your whole life, this book helps 
connect your financial goals and challenges to the rest of your life. Personal Finance 
For Dummies provides a broad understanding of personal finance that includes all 
areas of your financial present and future: spending, taxes, saving and investing, 
insurance, and planning for major goals like buying a home, someday running 
your own business, investing for your future, and so on.
Even if you understand the financial basics, thinking about your finances in a 
holistic way can be difficult. Sometimes you’re too close to the situation to be 
objective. Your finances may reflect the history of your life more than they reflect 
a comprehensive plan for your future.
You want to know the best places to go for your circumstances, so this book con￾tains specific, tried-and-proven recommendations. I also suggest where to turn 
next if you need more information and help.
About This Book
Here are some of the updates I’ve made to the book:
» Information on how to navigate changing economic conditions and make the 
most of your money, real-estate decisions, and investments
» Complete coverage of recent tax law changes and how to best take advantage 
of coming tax changes in 2024 and beyond affecting individuals, families, 
investors, and small businesses
» Updated investment strategies and recommendations for exchange-traded 
funds, mutual funds, international investments, real estate, and more
» Expanded coverage of self-employed retirement options
» Updated coverage of higher-education options, costs and benefits, and 
career value
» The latest information on government assistance programs, Social Security, 
and Medicare and what it means in terms of how you should prepare for 
retirement
» Revised recommendations for where to get the best insurance deals and 
updated coverage of the health insurance marketplace and subsidy changesIntroduction 3
» Coverage of the best personal finance apps and fintech (financial technology) 
options and solutions
» Expanded and updated coverage of how to use and make sense of the news 
and financial resources (especially online resources)
Aside from being packed with updated information, another great feature of this 
book is that you can read it from cover to cover if you want, or you can read a par￾ticular chapter or part without having to read what comes before it. Handy cross￾references direct you to other places in the book for more details on a particular 
subject. If you like, you can skip the sidebars (shaded boxes) and text marked with 
the Technical Stuff icon; that info is interesting but nonessential.
Foolish Assumptions
In writing this book, I made some assumptions about you, dear reader:
» You want expert advice about important financial topics (such as paying off 
and reducing the cost of debt, planning for major goals, making wise invest￾ments), and you want quality information and answers efficiently.
» You want a crash course in personal finance and are looking for a book you 
can read cover-to-cover to help solidify major financial concepts and get you 
thinking about your finances in a more comprehensive way.
This book is basic enough to help novices get their arms around thorny financial 
issues. But it challenges advanced readers as well to think about their finances in 
a new way and identify areas for improvement.

Embracing Financial 
Literacy
A continuing stream of studies has indicated that many Americans, espe￾cially younger adults, are by and large financially illiterate. The vast 
majority of survey respondents have “failing” scores — meaning that they 
answered less than 60 percent of the questions correctly.
I know from my many years of work as a personal financial counselor and teacher 
and now as a writer that many folks do indeed have significant gaps in their per￾sonal financial knowledge. Though more folks have greater access today to more 
information than in prior generations, the financial world has grown more com￾plicated, and there are more choices, and pitfalls, than ever before.
Unfortunately, most Americans don’t know how to manage their personal finances 
because they were never taught how to do so. Their parents may have avoided 
discussing money in front of them, and most high schools and colleges lack 
courses that teach this vital, lifelong-needed skill.
Some people are fortunate enough to learn the financial keys to success at home, 
from knowledgeable friends, and from the best expert-written books like this one. 
Others either never discover important personal finance concepts, or they learn 
them the hard way  — by making lots of costly mistakes. People who lack

knowledge make more mistakes, and the more financial errors you commit, the 
more money passes through your hands and out of your life. In addition to the 
enormous financial costs, you experience the emotional toll of not feeling in con￾trol of your finances. Increased stress and anxiety go hand in hand with not mas￾tering your money.
This chapter examines what topics fall under the heading of “financial literacy” 
and where people learn about finances, and helps you decide whether your current 
level of knowledge is holding you back. You can find out how to improve your 
financial literacy and take responsibility for your finances, putting you in charge 
and reducing your anxiety about money. After all, you have more important things 
to worry about, like what’s for dinner.
Understanding Everything Financial 
Literacy Includes
I start with the basics. What exactly am I talking about when it comes to being lit￾erate in personal finance? Following are three subjects to become acquainted with:
» Managing your everyday transactions: I cover accounting for money in the 
short term that passes through your hands and your transaction accounts.
» Investing for the long term: I discuss the best ways to invest money for 
better returns and longer-term purposes.
» Protecting your money: I provide an overview on the generally less popular 
but highly important topic of protecting your income and assets with 
insurance.
In addition to these major topic areas, the field of personal finance includes plenty 
of jargon and terminology, the mastery of which will boost your confidence and 
your decision-making skills. I provide definitions along the way and include a 
handy glossary at the end of this book.
Starting with the basics: Budgeting 
and transaction accounts
If you’re like most people, as you earn money, much of it too quickly passes 
through your hands or, more specifically, into and out of your transaction 
accounts. As you surely know, a hefty chunk of money you earn is siphoned off to 
federal, state, and local taxes. What’s left is used to pay your monthly living CHAPTER 1 Embracing Financial Literacy 9
expenses, such as housing, food, utilities, clothing, and hopefully for some enter￾tainment and recreation. Chapter 2 delves into the different kinds of transaction 
accounts and how to use them.
Managing your monthly living expenses (including taxes) and budget and estab￾lishing and working toward financial goals takes time and effort. Parts 1 and 2 
help you accomplish those important tasks.
Making your money work for you: Investing
When you’re spending less than you earn and able to save new money each month, 
you will have the pleasant but challenging problem of deciding where and when to 
invest your savings. Or maybe you already have additional money you want to 
invest and work harder for you.
The world of investments is complicated and filled with pitfalls. That contributes 
to some folks leaving their excess money sitting in their low-interest transaction 
accounts by default. While you could do worse (by losing money in poor invest￾ments), you can certainly do better — and you probably need to do better in order 
to accomplish your financial goals. Part 3 covers all things investing and helps you 
master that important task.
Protecting your income and 
assets: Insurance
When you’re earning money and have some assets (for example, a car, house, and 
so forth), insurance protects against the loss of that income and your assets. If 
others are dependent upon your employment income, you likely need some life 
insurance. Even without dependents, you’re probably dependent on your own 
income and thus should have adequate disability insurance.
Assets like a car and home require sufficient insurance protection. And, as your 
investments and net worth grow, having some excess liability insurance to protect 
that makes sense as well. See Part 4 for the important details on insurance.
Talking Money at Home
I was fortunate — my parents taught me a lot of things that have been invaluable 
throughout my life, and among those things were sound principles for earning, 
spending, and saving money. My parents had to know how to do these things 
because they were raising a family of three children on (usually) one modest 10 PART 1 Getting Started with Personal Finance
income. They knew the importance of making the most of what you have and of 
passing that vital skill on to your kids.
However, my parents’ financial knowledge did have some gaps. I observed first￾hand the struggles my late father endured handling some retirement money after 
being laid off from a job when I was in middle school. In subsequent years, this 
situation propelled me to learn about investing to help myself, my family, and 
others.
In many families, money is a taboo subject — parents don’t level with their kids 
about the limitations, realities, and details of their budgets. Some parents I talk 
with believe that dealing with money is an adult issue and that children should be 
insulated from it so they can enjoy being kids. Others readily admit the many 
holes in their financial knowledge and thus don’t feel comfortable teaching their 
kids about personal finance. In too many families, kids hear about money only
when disagreements and financial crises bubble to the surface. Thus begins the 
harmful cycle of children having negative associations with money and financial 
management.
In other cases, parents with the best of intentions pass on their bad money￾management habits. You may have learned from a parent, for example, to buy 
things to cheer yourself up. Or you may have witnessed a family member mania￾cally chasing get-rich-quick business and investment ideas. Now, I’m not saying 
that you shouldn’t listen to your parents. But in the area of personal finance, as in 
any other area, poor family advice and modeling can be problematic.
Think about where your parents learned about money management and then con￾sider whether they had the time, energy, or inclination to research choices before 
making their decisions. For example, if they didn’t do enough research or had 
faulty information, your parents may mistakenly have thought that banks were 
the best places for investing money or that buying stocks was like going to Las 
Vegas. (You can find the best places to invest your money in Part 3 of this book.)
In still other cases, the parents have the right approach, but the kids do the oppo￾site out of rebellion. For example, if your parents spent money carefully and 
thoughtfully and often made you feel denied, you may tend to do the opposite, 
buying yourself gifts the moment any extra cash comes your way.
Although you can’t change what the educational system and your parents did or 
didn’t teach you about personal finances, you now have the ability to find out 
what you need to know to manage your finances.
If you have children of your own, don’t underestimate their potential or send 
them out into the world without the skills they need to be productive and happy 
adults. Buy them some good financial books when they head off to college or begin 
their first job.CHAPTER 1 Embracing Financial Literacy 11
Identifying Unreliable Sources 
of Information
Most folks know that they’re not financial geniuses. So they set out to take control 
of their money matters by reading about personal finance or consulting a financial 
advisor.
PERSONAL FINANCE AT SCHOOL
In schools, the main problem with personal finance education is the lack of classes, not 
that kids already know the information or that the skills are too complex for children to 
understand.
Nancy Donovan teaches personal finance to her fifth-grade math class as a way to 
illustrate how math can be used in the real world. “Students choose a career, find jobs, 
and figure out what their taxes and take-home paychecks will be. They also have to 
rent apartments and figure out a monthly budget,” says Donovan. “Students like it, 
and parents have commented to me how surprised they are by how much financial 
knowledge their kids can handle.” Donovan also has her students invest $10,000 
(play money) and then track their investments’ performance.
Urging schools to teach the basics of personal finance is just common sense. Children 
need to be taught how to manage a household budget, the importance of saving money 
for future goals, and the consequences of overspending. Unfortunately, few schools 
offer classes like Donovan’s. In most cases, the financial basics aren’t taught at all.
In the minority of schools that do offer a personal finance–related course, the class is 
typically in economics (and an elective at that). “Archaic theory is being taught, and it 
doesn’t do anything for the students as far as preparing them for the real world,” says 
one high school principal I know. Having taken more than my fair share of economics 
courses in college, I understand the principal’s concerns.
Some people argue that teaching children financial basics is the parents’ job. However, 
this well-meant sentiment is what we’re relying on now, and for all too many, it isn’t 
working. In some families, financial illiteracy is passed on from generation to generation.
Education takes place in the home, on the streets, and in the schools. Therefore, schools 
must bear some responsibility for teaching this skill. However, if you’re raising children, 
remember that no one cares as much as you do or has as much ability to teach the 
important life skill of personal money management.12 PART 1 Getting Started with Personal Finance
But reading and seeking advice to find out how to manage your money can be 
dangerous if you’re a novice. Misinformation can come from popular and seem￾ingly reliable information sources, as I explain in the following sections. (Because 
the pitfalls are numerous and the challenges significant when choosing an advi￾sor, I devote Chapter 19 to the financial planning business and tell you what you 
need to know to avoid being duped and disappointed.)
Understanding the dangers of 
free financial content online
In addition to being able to quickly access what we want, the other major attrac￾tion of the internet is the abundance of seemingly free websites providing piles of 
apparently free content. Appearances, however, can be decidedly deceiving!
While there are exceptions to any rule, the fact of the matter is that the vast 
majority of websites purporting to provide a seemingly never-ending array of 
“free” content are rife with conflicts of interest and quality problems due to the 
following:
» Advertising: Any publication that accepts advertising has a potential conflict 
of interest because it may not want to publish articles that would upset its 
advertisers. Such a mindset, however, can stand in the way of telling consum￾ers the unvarnished truth about various products and services. For example, 
credit-card companies aren’t very interested in advertising someplace that 
publishes articles highlighting the negatives of credit cards. (Check out the 
section “Publishers pandering to advertisers” later in this chapter for more on 
the power of advertising to influence the financial information you encounter 
online, on TV, and elsewhere.)
» Advertorials: Too many website owners are unwilling or unable to pay real 
writers for quality content and instead publish articles that are written and 
provided by advertisers. These pieces of “content” are known as advertorials
and, in the worst cases, aren’t even clearly labeled as advertisements, which is 
precisely what they are.
» Affiliate relationships: Many companies pay “referral fees” to websites that 
bring in new customers. Here’s how that practice causes major conflicts of 
interest. On a financial website, you read a glowing review of a particular 
financial product or service. And the site provides a helpful link to the website 
of the provider of that product or service. Unbeknownst to you, when you 
click on that link and buy something, the seller kicks money back to the 
“affiliate” who reeled you in. At a minimum, such relationships should be 
clearly disclosed and detailed in any review.CHAPTER 1 Embracing Financial Literacy 13
» Insufficient editorial oversight: At most established, quality print publica￾tions, there are usually numerous editors who oversee the publication and all 
its articles. This structure helps ensure the accuracy of what gets into print 
(although bias, such as political bias, isn’t necessarily controlled). 
Unfortunately, the shoestring budget on which many websites operate 
precludes these quality-control checks and balances. Thus, sites operated by 
non-experts proffering advice place you at great risk.
» Lack of accountability: In part because of a lack of editorial oversight, there’s 
also often a lack of accountability for advice given online. This situation is 
especially problematic on the numerous sites that are run without disclosure 
of who is actually in charge of the site and/or who is writing the articles. 
Although such anonymity may be helpful to the site and its content providers, 
it’s certainly not in your best interests because it prevents you from checking 
out the background, qualifications, and track record of the providers.
Recognizing the dangers of following 
financial gurus (and celebrities)
While new mediums may come while others fade, the same types of dangers con￾tinue to trip up people with their money. In this section, I highlight what you can 
do to protect yourself from being led astray by supposed financial gurus and 
celebrities.
Knowing who’s talking
Before you take financial advice from anyone, examine their background, includ￾ing professional work experience and education credentials. This is true whether 
you’re getting advice from an advisor, writer, talk show host, or TV financial 
reporter.
If you can’t easily find such information, that’s usually a red flag. People with 
something to hide or a lack of something redeeming to say about themselves usu￾ally don’t promote their background.
Of course, just because someone seems to have a relatively impressive-sounding 
background doesn’t mean that they have your best interests in mind or have hon￾estly presented their qualifications.
You can’t always accept stated credentials and qualifications at face value, because 
some people lie (witness the billions lost to hedge fund Ponzi-scheme-man 
Bernie Madoff). You can’t sniff out liars by the way they look, their résumé, their 14 PART 1 Getting Started with Personal Finance
gender, or their age. You can, however, increase your chances of being tipped off 
by being skeptical (and by regularly reading the “Guru Watch” section of my web￾site at www.erictyson.com).
Beware celebrity endorsers
Celebrities were used big-time as endorsers in recent years in the problematic 
cryptocurrency space. You’ve perhaps heard of the now defunct and bankrupt off￾shore cryptocurrency exchange FTX, which spent hundreds of millions of dollars 
on advertising and paying celebrity endorsers like basketball stars Shaquille O’Neil 
and Stephen Curry, NFL quarterbacks Trevor Lawrence and Tom Brady, comedian 
Larry David, supermodel Gisele Bündchen, tennis great Naomi Osaka, baseball 
stars David “Big Papi” Ortiz and Shohei Ohtani, and Shark Tank’s Kevin O’Leary.
In some of the advertisements for FTX, the well-paid celebrity endorsers joked 
about not knowing much about cryptocurrencies but then suggesting that that 
was why they used FTX, implying that FTX was the expert. In other ads, some 
celebrities acted like they were calling friends to ask if they too were in to invest 
through FTX. Lawyers have filed a class action lawsuit against the celebrities for 
being bought off, failing to disclose large endorsement fees, and misleading the 
public to invest billions of dollars in FTX which turned out to be a fraud.
Always remember that celebrities may have a talent that brings them notoriety, 
fame and fortune, but they are no smarter than anyone else when it comes to their 
personal finances. Furthermore and too often, they have enormous (and rarely 
well disclosed) conflicts of interest in what they tout.
Seeing the red flag in outrageous 
performance claims
You can see a number of hucksters for what they are by using common sense in 
reviewing some of their outrageous claims. Some sources of advice, such as the 
late Wade Cook’s investment seminars, lure you in by promising outrageous 
returns. The stock market has generated average annual returns of about 9 percent 
over the long term. However, Cook, a former taxi driver, promoted his seminars as 
an “alive, hands-on, do the deals, two-day intense course in making huge returns 
in the stock market. If you aren’t getting 20 percent per month, or 300-percent 
annualized returns on your investments, you need to be there.” (I guess I do, as 
does every investment manager and individual investor I know!)
Cook’s get-rich-quick seminars, which cost more than $6,000, were so successful 
at attracting people that his company went public and generated annual revenues 
of more than $100 million. Cook’s “techniques” included trading in and out of CHAPTER 1 Embracing Financial Literacy 15
stocks and options after short holding periods of weeks, days, or even hours. His 
trading strategies can best be described as techniques that are based upon techni￾cal analysis — that is, charting a stock’s price movements and volume history, 
and then making predictions based on those charts.
The perils of following an approach that advocates short-term trading with the 
allure of high profits are numerous:
» You’ll rack up enormous brokerage commissions.
» On occasions where your short-term trades produce a profit, you’ll pay high 
ordinary income-tax rates rather than the far lower capital gains rate for 
investments held more than 12 months.
» You won’t make big profits — quite the reverse. If you stick with this approach, 
you’ll underperform the market averages.
» You’ll make yourself a nervous wreck. This type of trading is gambling, not 
investing. Get sucked up in it, and you’ll lose more than money — you may 
also lose the love and respect of your family and friends.
If Cook’s followers were able to indeed earn the 300 percent annual returns his 
seminars claimed to help you achieve, any investor starting with just $10,000 
would vault to the top of the list of the world’s wealthiest people (ahead of Bill 
Gates and Warren Buffett) in just 11 years!
Publishers pandering to advertisers
Thousands of publications and media outlets — websites, blogs, podcasts, radio, 
TV, magazines, and even some newspapers still, and so on — dole out personal 
financial advice and perspectives. Although some of these “service providers” 
collect revenue from subscribers, virtually all are dependent — in some cases, 
fully dependent (especially the internet, radio, and TV) — on advertising dollars. 
Although advertising is a necessary part of capitalism, advertisers can taint and, 
in some cases, dictate the content of what you read, listen to, and view.
Be sure to consider how dependent a publication or media outlet is on advertising. 
I find that “free” publications, websites/blogs, podcasts, radio, and TV are the 
ones that most often create conflicts of interest by pandering to advertisers. (All 
derive all their revenue from advertising.)
Much of what’s on the internet is advertiser-driven as well. Many of the investing 
sites on the internet offer advice about individual stocks. Interestingly, such sites 
derive much of their revenue from online brokerage firms seeking to recruit cus￾tomers. (See Part 3 for more information about your best investment options.)16 PART 1 Getting Started with Personal Finance
Keep in mind that you have virtually zero privacy on “free” websites because they 
make money by selling access to website visitors like you to companies and people 
with something to sell.
As you read various publications, watch TV, or listen to podcasts and radio, note 
how consumer-oriented these media are. Do you get the feeling that they’re look￾ing out for your interests? For example, if lots of auto manufacturers advertise, 
HOW SOME GURUS BECOME POPULAR
You may be wondering how Wade Cook became so popular despite the obvious flaws 
in his advice (see the section “Seeing the red flag in outrageous performance claims” for 
the goods on Cook). He promoted his seminars through infomercials and other adver￾tising, including radio ads on respected news stations. Social media platforms today 
have many such charlatans falsely claiming high returns they’ve supposedly been 
making.
The attorneys general of numerous states sued Cook’s company and sought millions of 
dollars in consumer refunds. The suits alleged that the company lied about its invest￾ment track record (not a big surprise — this company claimed that you’d make 300 per￾cent per year in stocks!).
Cook’s company settled the blizzard of state and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) law￾suits against his firm by agreeing to accurately disclose its trading record in future pro￾motions and give refunds to customers who were misled by past inflated return claims. 
(That didn’t stop Cook, however, from getting into more legal hot water — and serving a 
seven-year prison term for failing to pay millions in personal income taxes.)
According to a news report by Bloomberg News, Cook’s firm disclosed that it lost a whop￾ping 89 percent of its own money trading during one year in which the stock market 
fared well. As Deb Bortner, director of the Washington State Securities Division and 
president of the North American Securities Administrators Association, observed, 
“Either Wade is unable to follow his own system, which he claims is simple to follow, or 
the system doesn’t work.”
Don’t assume that someone with something to sell, who is getting good press and run￾ning lots of ads, will take care of you. That “guru” may just be good at press relations 
and self-promotion. Certainly, talk shows and the media at large can and do provide 
useful information on a variety of topics, but bad eggs sometimes turn up. These bad 
eggs may not always smell bad up front. In fact, they may hoodwink people for years 
before finally being exposed. Review Part 5 for the details on resources you can trust 
and those that can cause you to go bust!CHAPTER 1 Embracing Financial Literacy 17
does the media outlet ever tell you how to save money when shopping for a car or 
the importance of buying a car within your means? Or are they primarily creating 
an advertiser-friendly broadcast or publication?
Jumping over Real and Imaginary 
Hurdles to Financial Success
Perhaps you know that you should live within your means, buy and hold sound 
investments for the long term, and secure proper insurance coverage; however, 
you can’t bring yourself to do these things. Everyone knows how difficult it is to 
break problematic habits that have been practiced for many years. The temptation 
to spend money lurks everywhere. Ads show attractive and popular people enjoy￾ing the fruits of their labors — a new car, an exotic vacation, and a lavish home.
Maybe you felt deprived by your tightwad parents as a youngster, or maybe you’re 
bored with life and like the adventure of buying new things. If only you could hit 
it big on one or two investments, you think, you could get rich quick and do what 
you really want with your life. As for disasters and catastrophes, well, those things 
happen to other people, not to you. Besides, you’ll probably have advance warning 
of pending problems, so you can prepare accordingly, right?
Your emotions and temptations can get the better of you. Certainly, part of suc￾cessfully managing your finances involves coming to terms with your shortcom￾ings and the consequences of your behaviors. If you don’t, you may end up 
enslaved to an unsatifactory job so you can keep feeding your spending addiction. 
Or you may spend more time with your investments than you do with your family 
and friends. Or unexpected events may leave you reeling financially; disasters and 
catastrophes can happen to anyone at any time.
Discovering what (or who) 
is holding you back
A variety of personal and emotional hurdles can get in the way of making the best 
financial moves. As I discuss earlier in this chapter, a lack of financial knowledge 
(which stems from a lack of personal financial education) can stand in the way of 
making good decisions.
But I’ve seen some people caught in the psychological trap of blaming something 
else for their financial problems. For example, some people believe that adult 
problems can be traced back to childhood and how they were raised.18 PART 1 Getting Started with Personal Finance
I don’t want to disregard the negative impact particular backgrounds can have on 
some people’s tendency to make the wrong choices during their lives. Exploring 
your personal history can certainly yield clues to what makes you tick. That said, 
adults make choices and engage in behaviors that affect themselves as well as 
others. They shouldn’t blame their parents for their own inability to plan for their 
financial futures, live within their means, and make sound investments.
Some people also tend to blame their financial shortcomings on not earning more 
income. Such people believe that if only they earned more, their financial (and 
personal) problems would melt away. My experience working and speaking with 
people from diverse economic backgrounds has taught me that achieving financial 
success — and more importantly, personal happiness — has much less to do with 
how much income a person makes but rather with what they make of what they 
have. I know financially wealthy people who are emotionally poor even though 
they have all the material goods they want. Likewise, I know people who are quite 
happy, content, and emotionally wealthy even though they’re struggling 
financially.
Americans — even those who have not had an “easy” life — ought to be able to 
come up with numerous things to be happy about and grateful for: a family who 
loves them; friends who laugh at their stupid jokes; the freedom to catch a movie, 
play some pickleball or read a good book; or a great singing voice, a good sense of 
humor, or a full head of hair.
Developing good financial habits
After you understand the basic concepts and know where to buy the best financial 
products when you need them, you’ll soon see that managing personal finances 
well is not much more difficult than other things you do regularly, like tying your 
shoelaces and getting to work each day.
Regardless of your income, you can make your dollars stretch further if you prac￾tice good financial habits and avoid mistakes. In fact, the lower your income, the 
more important it is that you make the most of your income and savings (because 
you don’t have the luxury of falling back on your next big paycheck to bail you out).
More and more industries are subject to global competition, so you need to be on 
your financial toes now more than ever. Job security is waning; layoffs and retrain￾ing for new jobs are increasing. Putting in 30 years for one company and retiring 
with the gold watch and lifetime pension are becoming as rare as never having 
problems with your computer.CHAPTER 1 Embracing Financial Literacy 19
Speaking of company pensions, odds are increasing that you work for an employer 
that has you save toward your own retirement instead of providing a pension for 
you. Not only do you need to save the money, you must also decide how to invest 
it. Chapter 12 can help you get a handle on investing in retirement accounts.
Personal finance involves much more than managing and investing money. It also 
includes making all the pieces of your financial life fit together; it means lifting 
yourself out of financial illiteracy. Like planning a vacation, managing your per￾sonal finances means forming a plan for making the best use of your limited time 
and dollars.
Intelligent personal financial strategies have little to do with your gender, ethnic￾ity, or marital status. All people need to manage their finances wisely. Some 
aspects of financial management become more or less important at different 
points in your life, but for the most part, the principles remain the same for 
everyone.
Knowing the right answers isn’t enough. You have to practice good financial hab￾its just as you practice other good habits, such as brushing your teeth or eating a 
healthy diet and getting some exercise. Don’t be overwhelmed. As you read this 
book, make a short list of your financial marching orders and then start working 
away. Throughout this book, I highlight ways you can overcome temptations and 
keep control of your money rather than let your emotions and money rule you. 
(I discuss common financial problems in Chapter 3.)
What you do with your money is a quite personal and confidential matter. In this 
book, I try to provide guidance that can keep you in sound financial health. You 
don’t have to take it all — pick what works best for you and understand the pros 
and cons of your options. But from this day forward, please don’t make the easily 
avoidable mistakes or overlook the sound strategies that I discuss in this book.
Throughout your journey, I hope to challenge and even change the way you think 
about money and about making important personal financial decisions  — and 
sometimes even about the meaning of life. No, I’m not a philosopher, but I do 
know that money is connected to many other parts of our lives.CHAPTER 2 Establishing a Financial Foundation 21
Chapter 2
Establishing a Financial 
Foundation
What are the basic building blocks for establishing your financial founda￾tion? Understanding cash flow, knowing the different types of accounts 
through which your money can be held and accessed, keeping yourself 
in line with a budget, and finding out how to build and improve your credit score.
It’s important to understand how to manage your spending and cash flow, which 
is the difference between your earnings and your expenditures, because accom￾plishing a positive cash flow enables you to work towards future financial and 
associated personal goals.
You also should understand the different types of accounts through which your 
money may pass and be invested through because the best of these accounts offer 
much better terms and potential returns. Transaction accounts (which are check￾ing and asset management accounts) and savings type accounts are offered by 
banks and other types of financial institutions. Far more financial institutions 
offer investment accounts, which makes choosing even more overwhelming.
IN THIS CHAPTER
» Sizing up where your money comes 
from and where it goes
» Understanding transaction and 
investment accounts
» Creating a budget to follow where 
your money goes
» Taking stock of your credit history22 PART 1 Getting Started with Personal Finance
And, you should understand how to establish a budget. Even though a budget may 
sound daunting and a sure strike to anything fun, it doesn’t have to be and, in 
fact, is a great way to get a leg up on your savings so you have the future funds to 
pay for the things you want.
Finally, you should understand how to build and improve your credit score because 
you will likely want to or need to borrow money to accomplish important goals 
such as buying a home, starting a business, or paying for some higher education.
Understanding Your Cash Flow
Every month, you have money coming in and money going out. Most folks have 
never had sufficient training in how to manage their personal finances and do it 
well. Enter this book!
Your cash flow, over a specific time period such as a month or a year, is simply the 
difference between your income coming in and your expenditures going out. If it’s 
positive — that is, your income exceeds your expenditures — you’re saving money 
and have more to invest. When your cash flow is negative — in other words, when 
your expenditures are greater than your income — you’re either burning through 
savings or accumulating debt.
Uncovering where your money goes
Brushing your teeth, eating a diverse and healthy diet, and exercising regularly 
are good habits. Spending less than you earn and saving enough to meet your 
future financial objectives are the financial equivalents of these habits.
Despite relatively high incomes compared with the rest of the world, some 
Americans have a hard time saving a solid percentage of their incomes. Why? 
Often, it’s because they spend too much — sometimes far more than necessary. 
I don’t know the details of your personal situation and please understand that 
there can be reasons somewhat beyond your control, especially in the short term, 
as to why your income is quickly consumed by spending. But the basic idea is to 
make the effort to continuously spend less than what you make.
The first step to saving more of the income that you work so hard for is to figure 
out where that income typically gets spent. Doing a spending analysis helps you 
determine where your cash is flowing. Do the spending analysis (see Chapter 5) if 
any of the following apply to you:CHAPTER 2 Establishing a Financial Foundation 23
» You aren’t saving enough money to meet your financial goals. (If you’re not 
sure whether this is the case, please see Chapter 4.)
» You feel as though your spending is out of control, or you don’t really know 
where all your income goes.
» You’re anticipating a significant life change (for example, marriage, leaving 
your job to start a business, having children, retiring, and so on).
If you’re already a good saver, you may not need to complete the spending analy￾sis. After you save enough to accomplish your goals, I don’t see as much value in 
continually tracking your spending. You’ve already established the good habit — 
saving. Tracking exactly where you spend your money month after month is not
the good habit. (You may still benefit from perusing my smarter spending recom￾mendations in Chapter 7.)
The immediate goal of a spending analysis is to figure out where you typically 
spend your money. The long-range goal is to establish a good habit: maintaining 
a regular, automatic savings routine.
Knowing where your money is going each month is useful, and making changes in 
your spending behavior and cutting out the fat so you can save more money and 
meet your financial goals is terrific. However, you may make yourself and those 
around you miserable if you’re obsessive about documenting precisely where you 
spend every single dollar and cent.
Saving what you need to achieve your goals is what matters most.
Sizing up your income
In addition to reining in your spending, you can boost your cash flow by finding 
ways to earn more money. Most folks have a regular job where they work as an 
employee. But you may be interested in or already running your own small busi￾ness or side hustle.
Investing in your career
In my work with financial counseling clients over the years and from observing 
friends and colleagues, I’ve witnessed plenty of people succeed working for 
employers. So I don’t want to leave you with the impression that financial success 
equates with starting your own small business, or buying or investing in someone 
else’s small business.24 PART 1 Getting Started with Personal Finance
You can and should invest in your career. Following are some time-tested, proven 
ways to do that:
» Networking: Some people wait to network until they’ve been laid off or are 
really eager or desperate to change jobs. Take an interest in what others do 
for a living and you’ll learn and grow from the experience, even if you choose 
to stay with your current employer or in your chosen field. In addition to 
personal networking, check out LinkedIn, the social network for business 
professionals.
» Making sure you keep learning: Whether it’s reading quality books or other 
publications or taking some night courses, find ways to build on your knowl￾edge base.
» Considering the risk in the status quo: Many folks are resistant to change 
and get anxious thinking about what can go wrong when taking a new risk. 
I know when I was ready to walk away from a six-figure job with a prestigious 
management consulting firm and open my own financial counseling firm, 
some of my relatives and friends had difficulty understanding why I’d walk 
away from that. That’s not to say that they didn’t have some valid concerns; 
they just weren’t really considering the risks inherent in my staying put and 
didn’t see the upside of my small-business venture.
Securing a side hustle
If your regular or full-time job leaves you with some free time to work even more, 
developing a side hustle may be worthwhile. Take inventory of your skills and 
interests. Brainstorm about what types of part-time work would enable you to put 
most of your skills and interests to work. You’re only limited by your imagination 
(and regulations/laws) as to different ways you can make some money.
You may find that your side hustle could grow into more of a full-time endeavor 
and allow you to leave behind your current job if that’s of interest to you. It could 
also lead to a good source of revenue during retirement. Some folks simply enjoy 
having more than one stream of employment income. Regardless of the reason, 
having a side hustle can make for a more interesting work experience and help to 
hedge your bets employment wise, especially if your current full-time work is in 
an industry or with a company that is in decline.CHAPTER 2 Establishing a Financial Foundation 25
Utilizing Transaction and 
Investment Accounts
When income comes to you and you need to pay bills and hold onto excess savings, 
you’ll want to have financial accounts with trustworthy and secure companies. 
Historically, banks have been the most often chosen institution, especially trans￾action (also known as checking) accounts, which are the workhorse of most peo￾ple’s accounts. Additional accounts for savings and investing also make sense for 
most people. This section gives you a quick overview.
Transaction/checking accounts
Transaction/checking accounts are best used for depositing your monthly income 
and paying your bills. If you want to have unlimited bill paying and check-writing 
privileges and access to your money with an ATM card, checking accounts at local 
banks are often your best bet.
Here’s how to get the most from a bank:
» Consider small banks, credit unions, and online banks. You may get a 
better checking account deal at a credit union, a smaller bank, or one that 
operates online only. Because you can easily obtain cash through ATM outlets 
in supermarkets and other retail stores, you may not need to do business 
with Big City Bank, which has ATMs and branch offices at every intersection. 
Whatever institution you use, make sure your deposits are fully insured by 
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or the National Credit 
Union Administration (NCUA). Every now and then a bank fails, and so long 
as it participates in these insurance programs and you have less than the 
maximum limit in your accounts ($250,000 for a single person, $500,000 for 
a joint couple account), you’ll be fine.
» Shop around. Some banks don’t require you to maintain a minimum balance 
to avoid a monthly service charge when you direct-deposit your paychecks. 
Make sure that you shop around for accounts that don’t ding you $2 or 
$3 here for the use of an ATM and $15 there for a low balance.
» Limit the amount you keep in checking. Keep only enough money in the 
account for your monthly bill payment needs. If you consistently keep more 
than a few thousand dollars extra in a checking account, get the excess out. 
You can generally earn more in a savings or money-market account, which 
I describe in the following section. And if you’re a high roller, be sure to 
limit the total amount you invest at any one institution to avoid exceeding 
insurance limits.26 PART 1 Getting Started with Personal Finance
» Don’t do your checking through the bank. Some folks (me included) don’t 
have a bank checking account. Discount brokerage accounts offer unlimited 
bill paying and check-writing within a money-market fund. (See Chapter 11 for 
recommended firms; also see my discussion in Chapter 20 about paying your 
bills via your computer and through other automatic means.)
Savings accounts and money-market funds
Savings accounts are available through banks; money-market funds are available 
through mutual-fund companies. Savings accounts and money-market funds are 
nearly identical, except that the best money-market funds generally pay a higher 
rate of interest. The interest rate paid to you, also known as the yield, fluctuates 
over time, depending on the level of interest rates in the overall economy. (Note 
that some banks offer money-market accounts, which are basically like savings 
accounts and shouldn’t be confused with money-market mutual funds.)
The federal government backs bank savings accounts with FDIC insurance. Money￾market funds are not insured. But don’t give preference to a bank account just 
because your investment (principal) is insured. In fact, your preference should 
lean toward money-market funds, because the better ones are higher-yielding 
than the better bank savings accounts. Even though money-market funds are not 
insured, your investment is safe given the types of short-term, high-quality secu￾rities they invest in. And money-market funds offer check-writing and other easy 
ways to access your money (for more on money funds, please see Chapter 11).
Money-market funds generally have several advantages over bank savings 
accounts:
» The best money-market funds have higher yields.
» If you’re in a high tax bracket, you may net more after factoring in taxes using 
tax-free money-market funds. No savings account pays tax-free interest.
» Most money-market funds come with free check-writing privileges. (The only 
stipulation is that each check must be written for a minimum amount — $250 
is common.)
As with money you put into bank savings accounts, money-market funds are 
suitable for money that you can’t afford to see dwindle in value.CHAPTER 2 Establishing a Financial Foundation 27
Investment accounts
Investment brokerage firms, mutual-fund companies, insurance companies, banks, 
and other types of financial services companies offer various types of investments. 
You can also invest in real estate and small, privately held companies.
Understanding how to best invest your money given your personal and financial 
goals is perhaps the most important aspect of managing your money. Please see 
Part 3 for more information and details.
Budgeting to Boost Your Savings
When most people hear the word budgeting, they think unpleasant thoughts — 
like those associated with dieting — and rightfully so. But budgeting can help you 
move from knowing how much you spend on various things to successfully reduc￾ing your spending.
The first step in the process of budgeting, or planning your future spending, is to 
analyze where your current spending is going (refer to Chapter 5). After you do 
that, calculate how much more you’d like to save each month. Then comes the 
hard part: deciding where to make cuts in your spending.
Suppose that you’re currently not saving any of your monthly income and you 
want to save 10 percent for retirement. If you can save and invest through a tax￾sheltered retirement account — for example, a 401(k), 403(b), or a SEP-IRA — 
you don’t actually need to cut your spending by 10 percent to reach a savings 
goal of 10 percent (of your gross income). When you contribute money to a tax￾deductible retirement account, you reduce your federal and state taxes. If you’re a 
moderate-income-earner paying, say, 30 percent in federal and state taxes on 
your marginal income, you actually need to reduce your spending by only 
7 percent to save 10 percent. The other 3 percent of the savings comes from the 
lowering of your taxes. (The higher your tax bracket, the less you need to cut your 
spending to reach a particular savings goal.)
So to boost your savings rate to 10 percent, go through your current spending 
category by category until you come up with enough proposed cuts to reduce your 
spending by 7 percent. Make your cuts in the areas that will be the least painful 
and where you’re getting the least value from your current level of spending. 
(If you don’t have access to a tax-deductible retirement account, budgeting still 
involves the same process of assessment and making cuts in various spending 
categories, but your cuts need to add up to the entire amount you want to save, in 
this example, 10 percent rather than 7 percent.)28 PART 1 Getting Started with Personal Finance
Another method of budgeting involves starting completely from scratch rather 
than examining your current expenses and making cuts from that starting point. 
Ask yourself how much you’d like to spend on different categories. The advantage 
of this approach is that it doesn’t allow your current spending levels to constrain 
your thinking. You’ll likely be amazed at the discrepancies between what you 
think you should be spending and what you actually are spending in certain 
categories.
Understanding and Improving 
Your Credit Score
If you expect to apply for a loan of any type and get a competitively low interest 
rate, you should understand your credit report and credit score and how to improve 
each. A credit report is basically your credit history, while a credit score is a three￾digit score based on the information in your personal credit report.
Deciphering how lenders use 
credit reports and scores
Most people borrow money at various times in their life, whether it’s to buy a 
home (or other real estate), to finance a small business, to pay for educational 
expenses, or for other purposes. When you want to borrow money, lenders exam￾ine your credit report and your credit score(s) to determine how responsible 
you’ve been in the past with credit and to help them decide whether they should 
lend you money (and if so, how much to charge you based on your past behavior 
with credit).
Specifically, lenders examine your history of credit usage in your credit report. 
This information tells the lender when each of your accounts was opened, what 
the recent balance is, your track record of making payments on time, and whether 
you’ve defaulted on any loans. A credit report also tells a prospective lender where 
else you’ve been applying for credit most recently.
Lenders use your credit score to help them predict the likelihood that you’ll default 
on repaying a loan. The higher your credit score the better, because a high credit 
score means that you have a lower likelihood of defaulting on a loan. Thus, more 
lenders will be willing to extend you credit and charge you lower rates for that 
credit. It’s important for you to know your credit score because a high credit score 
puts you in a negotiating position to ask for better rates (see the upcoming section 
“Getting your credit score” for information on how to get your score). Lenders are CHAPTER 2 Establishing a Financial Foundation 29
in the moneymaking business, and many don’t automatically give you the best 
rate for which you qualify.
The most widely used credit score is the FICO score, which was developed by the 
FICO company (formerly known as Fair, Isaac and Company). FICO scores range 
from a low of 300 to a high of 850. Most scores fall in the 600s and 700s, and the 
median is around 720. You generally qualify for the best lending rates if your 
credit score is in the mid-700s or higher.
Obtaining your credit reports
You want to get your hands on your credit report, so you know what lenders are 
reviewing. You’re entitled to receive a free copy of your credit report (which does 
not contain your credit score) every 12 months from each of the three credit 
bureaus — Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. If you visit www.annualcreditre
port.com, you can view and print copies of your credit report from each of the 
three credit agencies. (Alternatively, you can call 877-322-8228 and request that 
your reports be mailed to you.) You may want to order your credit report from a 
different bureau every four months rather than getting all three at once.
When you obtain your reports, inspect them for possible mistakes. You want to 
correct any mistakes because they can adversely affect your credit score. Credit￾reporting bureaus and the creditors who report credit information to these bureaus 
make some errors.
If your problems are fixable, there’s no need to hire someone to do so for you — 
you can fix them yourself, but you will likely have to make some phone calls or 
submit a dispute online or by writing a letter or two. See Chapter 3 for more details 
on fixing errors.
Some credit-report errors arise from other people’s negative information getting 
on your credit report. This can happen if you have a common name, have moved a 
lot, or for other reasons. If the problematic information on your report appears 
not to be yours, tell that particular credit bureau and explain that you need more 
information because you don’t recognize the creditor.
Getting your credit score
Many folks are disappointed to find that their credit reports lack their credit score. 
The reason for this is quite simple: The 2003 federal law mandating that the three 
credit agencies provide a free credit report annually to each U.S. citizen who 
requests a copy did not mandate that they provide the credit score. Thus, if you 
want to obtain your credit score, it’s generally going to cost you.30 PART 1 Getting Started with Personal Finance
One circumstance allows you to get one of your credit scores for free, but unfor￾tunately, you can only do so when you’re turned down for a loan. Current law 
allows you to obtain a free copy of the credit score a lender used in making a nega￾tive decision regarding your desired loan.
For recommended websites to use to obtain your credit score as well as those to 
avoid, please see Chapter 3.
BUILDING YOUR CREDIT SCORE 
WHEN STARTING OUT
To obtain a credit score if you don’t yet have credit, consider the following options:
• Establish a checking account and a savings account (and even a debit card) because 
they demonstrate financial responsibility and stability.
• Jump-start your credit history by being added to someone’s credit card (who is very 
responsible with credit) as a joint or authorized user.
• Have someone with good credit co-sign a loan with you.
• Apply for a credit card in college because approval is generally easy. Just be sure to 
get a card with a low annual rate and no (or a low) annual fee.
• If you can’t get a regular credit card, you may apply for a department store or gas 
charge card or you can apply for a secured credit card (which requires keeping 
money on deposit with the card-issuing bank).
• Making loan payments on time, such as on a student loan, will help toward building 
your credit record and score.CHAPTER 3 Measuring Your Financial Health 31
Chapter 3
Measuring Your 
Financial Health
How financially healthy are you? When was the last time you reviewed your 
overall financial situation, including analyzing your spending, savings, 
future goals, and insurance? If you’re like most people, either you’ve never 
done this exercise or you did so too long ago.
This chapter guides you through a financial physical to help you detect problems 
with your current financial health. But don’t dwell on your “problems.” View 
them for what they are — opportunities to improve your financial situation. In 
fact, the more areas you can identify that stand to benefit from improvement, the 
greater the potential you may have to build real wealth and accomplish your 
financial and personal goals.

net worth

scores

and too much debt

Avoiding Common Money Mistakes
Financial problems, like many medical problems, are best detected early. And as 
with your personal health, the best “problems” are those avoided — clean living 
is a good thing, right? Here are the common personal financial problems I’ve seen 
in my work as a financial counselor:
» Not planning: Most of us procrastinate. That’s why we have deadlines (like 
April 15) — and deadline extensions (need another six months to get that tax 
return done?). Unfortunately, you may have no explicit deadlines with your 
personal finances. You can allow your credit-card debt to accumulate, or you 
can leave your savings sitting in lousy investments for years. You can pay 
higher taxes, leave gaps in your retirement and insurance coverage, and 
overpay for financial products. Of course, planning your finances isn’t as much 
fun as planning a vacation, but doing the former can help you take more of 
the latter. See Chapter 4 for details on setting financial goals.
» Overspending: Simple arithmetic helps you determine that savings is the 
difference between what you earn and what you spend (assuming that you’re 
not spending more than you’re earning!). To increase your savings, you either 
have to work more, increase your earning power through education or job 
advancement, get to know a wealthy family who wants to leave its fortune to 
you, or spend less. For most people, especially over the short term, the thrifty 
approach is the key to building savings and wealth. (Check out Chapter 5 for a 
primer on figuring out where your money goes; Chapter 7 gives advice for 
reducing your spending.)
» Buying with consumer credit: Carrying a debt balance from month to month 
on your credit card or buying a car on credit means that even more of your 
future earnings are going to be earmarked for debt repayment. Buying on credit, 
including the recent trend of “Buy Now, Pay Later,” encourages you to spend 
more than you can really afford. Chapter 6 discusses debt and credit problems.
» Delaying saving for financial independence/retirement: Most folks say 
that they want to achieve financial independence/retire by their mid-60s or 
sooner. But to accomplish this goal, they need to save a reasonable chunk 
(around 10 percent) of their incomes starting sooner rather than later. The 
longer you wait to start saving for retirement, the harder reaching your goal 
will be. And you’ll pay much more in taxes to boot if you don’t take advantage 
of the tax benefits of investing through particular retirement savings accounts. 
For information on planning for retirement, see Chapters 4 and 12.
» Falling prey to financial sales pitches: Steer clear of people who pressure 
you to make decisions, promise you high investment returns, and lack the 
proper training and experience to help you. Supposed great deals that can’t 
wait for a little reflection or a second opinion are often disasters waiting to CHAPTER 3 Measuring Your Financial Health 33
happen. A sucker may be born every minute, but a slick salesperson is 
pitching something every second! For important investment concepts and 
what kinds of investments to avoid, turn to Chapter 9.
» Not doing your homework: To get the best deal, shop around, read reviews, 
and get advice from objective third parties. You also need to check references 
and track records so you don’t hire incompetent, self-serving, or fraudulent 
financial advisors. (For more on hiring financial planners, see Chapter 19.) 
With so many different financial products available, making informed financial 
decisions has become an overwhelming task. I do a lot of the homework for 
you with the recommendations in this book. I also explain what additional 
research you need to do and how to do it.
» Making decisions based on emotion: You’re most vulnerable to making the 
wrong moves financially after a major life change (a job loss, divorce, or death in 
the family, for example) or when you feel pressure. Maybe your investments 
plunged in value. Or perhaps a recent divorce has you fearing that you won’t be 
able to afford to retire when you planned, so you pour thousands of dollars into 
some newfangled financial product. Take your time and keep your emotions out 
of decisions. In Chapter 22, I discuss how to approach major life changes and 
determine what changes you may need to make to your financial picture.
» Not separating the wheat from the chaff: In any field in which you’re not 
an expert, you are at risk of following the advice of someone you think is an 
expert but really isn’t. This book shows you how to separate the financial fluff 
from the financial facts. (Flip to Chapter 20 for information on how to evaluate 
financial advice online and Chapter 21 for how to evaluate financial coverage 
in the mass media.) You are the person who is best able to manage your 
personal finances. Educate and trust yourself!
» Exposing yourself to catastrophic risk: You’re vulnerable if you and your 
family don’t have insurance to pay for financially devastating losses. In the 
worst cases, folks without a savings reserve and a support network can end 
up homeless. Many people lack sufficient insurance coverage to replace their 
income. Don’t wait for a tragedy to strike to find out whether you have the 
right insurance coverage. Check out Part 4 for more on insurance.
» Focusing too much on money: Placing too much emphasis on making and 
saving money can warp your perspective on what’s important in life. Money is 
not the first — or even second — priority in happy people’s lives. Your health, 
relationships with family and friends, career satisfaction, and fulfilling 
interests are more significant. That’s not to say that it’s okay to ignore or give 
insufficient attention to your personal finances and associated decisions.
Money problems can be fixed over time with changes in your behavior. That’s 
what the rest of this book is all about.34 PART 1 Getting Started with Personal Finance
Determining Your Financial Net Worth
Your financial net worth is an important barometer of your monetary health. Your 
net worth indicates your capacity to accomplish major financial goals, such as 
buying a home, retiring, and withstanding unexpected expenses or loss of income.
Your net worth is your financial assets minus your financial liabilities:
Financial Assets – Financial Liabilities = Net Worth
The following sections explain how to determine those numbers.
Adding up your financial assets
A financial asset is real money or an investment you can convert into your favorite 
currency that you can use to buy things now or in the future. Financial assets gen￾erally include the money you have in bank accounts, stocks, bonds, mutual funds, 
and exchange-traded funds (see Part 3, which deals with investments). Money 
that you have in retirement accounts (including those with your employer) and 
the value of any businesses or real estate that you own are also counted.
I generally recommend that you exclude your personal residence when figuring 
your financial assets. Include your home only if you expect to sell it someday or 
otherwise live off the money you now have tied up in it (perhaps by taking out a 
reverse mortgage, which I discuss in Chapter 15). If you plan on eventually tap￾ping into the equity (the difference between the market value and any debt owed 
on the property), add that portion of the equity that you expect to use to your list 
of assets.
Assets can also include your future expected Social Security benefits and pension 
payments (if your employer has such a plan). These assets are usually quoted in 
dollars per month rather than as a lump sum value. In Table 3-1, I explain how to 
account for these monthly benefits when tallying your financial assets.
Consumer items  — such as your car, clothing, computer, smartphone, and so 
forth — do not count as financial assets. I understand that adding these things to 
your assets makes your assets look larger (and some financial software and publi￾cations encourage you to list these items as assets), but you can’t live off them 
unless you sell and do without them.CHAPTER 3 Measuring Your Financial Health 35
Subtracting your financial liabilities
To arrive at your financial net worth, you must subtract your financial liabilities
from your assets. Liabilities include loans and debts outstanding, such as student 
loans, and credit-card and auto-loan debts. When figuring your liabilities, include 
money you borrowed from family and friends — unless you’re not expected to pay 
it back!
Include mortgage debt on your home as a liability only if you include the value of 
your home in your asset list. Be sure to also include debt owed on other real 
estate — no matter what (because you count the value of investment real estate as 
an asset).

*To convert benefits that will be paid to you monthly into a total dollar amount, and for purposes of simplification, 
assume that you will spend 20 years in retirement. Inflation may reduce the value of your employer’s pension if it 
doesn’t contain a cost-of-living increase each year in the same way that Social Security does. Don’t sweat this now — 
you can take care of that concern in the section on retirement planning in Chapter 4.36 PART 1 Getting Started with Personal Finance
Crunching your numbers
Table 3-1 provides a place for you to figure your financial assets. Use the spaces 
provided or create your own spreadsheet to work from. Note: See Table  4-1 in 
Chapter 4 to estimate your Social Security benefits.
Now comes the potentially depressing part — figuring out your debts and loans in 
Table 3-2.
Now you can subtract your liabilities from your assets to figure your net worth in 
Table 3-3.
Interpreting your net worth results
Your net worth is important and useful only to you and your unique situation and 
goals. What seems like a lot of money to a person with a simple lifestyle may seem 
like a pittance to a person with high expectations and a desire for an opulent 
lifestyle.

In Chapter 4, you can crunch numbers to determine your overall financial health 
more precisely for goals such as retirement planning. I also discuss saving toward 
other important goals in that chapter. In the meantime, if your net worth (exclud￾ing expected monthly retirement benefits such as those from Social Security and 
pensions) is negative or less than half your annual income, take notice. If you’re 
in your 20s and you’re just starting to work, a low net worth is less concerning 
and not unusual. Focus on turning this number positive over the next several 
years. However, if you’re in your 30s or older, consider this a wake-up call to 
aggressively address your financial situation.
Getting rid of your debts — the highest-interest-rate ones first — is the most 
important thing. Then you want to build a safety reserve equal to three to six 
months of living expenses. Your overall plan should involve getting out of debt 
(Chapter 6), reducing your spending (Chapter 7), and developing tax-wise ways to 
save and invest your future earnings (Part 3).
Examining Your Credit Score and Reports
Lenders examine your credit report and score before granting you a loan or credit 
line. Building on the background information provided in Chapter 2, this section 
highlights what you need to know about your credit score and reports.
Understanding what your credit data 
includes and means
A credit report contains information such as
» Personal identifying information: Includes your name, address, Social 
Security number, and so on
» Record of credit accounts: Details when each account was opened, the latest 
balance, your payment history, and so on
» Bankruptcy filings: Indicates whether you’ve filed bankruptcy in recent years. 
Chapter 7 can stay on your credit report for ten years, and Chapter 13 for 
seven years.
» Inquiries: Lists who has accessed your credit report because you applied 
for credit
Your credit score, which is not the same as your credit report, is a three-digit score 
based on the report. Lenders use your credit score as a predictor of your likelihood 38 PART 1 Getting Started with Personal Finance
of defaulting on repaying your borrowings. As such, your credit score has a major 
impact on whether a lender is willing to extend you a particular loan and at what 
interest rate.
FICO is the leading credit score in the industry. FICO scores range from a low of 
300 to a high of 850. Most scores fall in the 600s and 700s. As with college entrance 
examinations, higher scores are better. (In recent years, the major credit 
bureaus — Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion — have developed their own credit 
scoring systems, but many lenders still use FICO the most.)
The higher your credit score, the lower your predicted likelihood of defaulting on 
a loan (see Figure 3-1). The “rate of credit delinquency” refers to the percentage 
of consumers who will become 90 days late or later in repaying a creditor within 
the next two years. As you can see in the chart, consumers with low credit scores 
have dramatically higher rates of falling behind on their loans. Thus, low credit 
scorers are considered much riskier borrowers, and fewer lenders are willing to 
offer them a given loan; those who do offer loans charge relatively high interest 
rates.
The median FICO score is around 720. You generally qualify for the best lending 
rates if your credit score is in the mid-700s or higher.
Reviewing your credit reports and score
As I explain in Chapter 2, federal law entitles you to receive a free copy of your 
credit report annually from each of the three credit bureaus (Equifax, Experian, 
and TransUnion).
FIGURE 3-1:

Source: FICO CorporationCHAPTER 3 Measuring Your Financial Health 39
When you receive your reports (which I explain how to do in Chapter 2), the best 
first step is to examine them for possible mistakes (see the upcoming section 
“Getting credit-report errors corrected” to find out how to fix problems in your 
reports). In the past, I found minor errors on two of my three reports. It took me 
several minutes to correct one of the errors (by submitting a request to that credit￾reporting agency’s website), and it took about half an hour to get the other mistake 
fixed (a small doctor’s bill was erroneously listed as unpaid and in collections).
Your credit reports do not include your credit score. Thus, if you want to obtain 
your credit score, it’s going to cost you.
You can request your credit score from FICO, but you’ll be charged $19.95 for 
every request (that can set you back about $60 to see your FICO score for all three 
credit bureaus). Save your money. In fact, you can get your current credit score 
without paying anything. You can start with the FICO score simulator at www.
myfico.com/free-credit-score-range-estimator, which provides you with an 
estimated range for your FICO score based upon your answers to a short list of 
questions about your history with and usage of credit.
If you do choose to pay for your current credit score, be crystal clear about what 
you’re buying. You may not realize that you’re agreeing to some sort of ongoing 
credit monitoring service for $100+ per year, an expenditure I don’t generally feel 
is worthwhile.
Improving your credit reports and score
Instead of simply throwing money into buying your credit scores or paying for 
some ongoing monitoring service to which you may not give much attention, take 
an interest in improving your credit standing and score. Working to boost your 
credit rating is especially worthwhile if you know that your credit report contains 
detrimental information.
Here are the most important actions that you can take to boost your attractiveness 
to lenders:
» Get all three of your credit reports and be sure each is accurate. Correct 
errors (as I explain in the next section) and be especially sure to get accounts 
removed from your credit report if they aren’t yours and show late payments 
or are in collection.
» Ask to have any late or missed payments that are more than seven 
years old removed. Ditto for a bankruptcy that occurred more than ten 
years ago.40 PART 1 Getting Started with Personal Finance
» Pay all your bills on time. To ensure on-time payments, sign up for auto￾matic bill payment, a service that most companies (like phone and utility 
providers) offer.
» Be loyal if it doesn’t cost you. The older your open loan accounts are, the 
better your credit rating will be. Closing old accounts and opening a bunch of 
new ones generally lowers your credit score. But don’t be loyal if it costs you! 
For example, if you can refinance your mortgage and save some money, by all 
means do so. The same logic applies if you’re carrying credit-card debt at a 
high interest rate and want to transfer that balance to a lower-rate card. If 
your current credit-card provider refuses to match a lower rate you find 
elsewhere, move your balance and save yourself some money (see Chapter 6 
for details).
» Limit your debt and debt accounts. The more loans, especially consumer 
loans, that you hold and the higher the balances, the lower your credit score 
will be. That said, your credit score will generally be maximized if you aren’t 
using more than about 30 percent of your credit limits.
» Work to pay down consumer revolving debt (such as credit-card debt).
Turn to Chapters 6 and 7 for suggestions.
Getting credit-report errors corrected
If you obtain your credit report and find a blemish on it that you don’t recognize 
as being your mistake or fault, do not assume that the information is correct.
You’re going to have to fill out a form on a website, make some phone calls, or 
write a letter or two to fix the problems on your credit report. Here’s how to cor￾rect most errors that aren’t your fault:
» If the credit problem is someone else’s: A surprising number of personal 
credit-report glitches are the result of someone else’s negative information 
getting on your credit report. If the bad information on your report looks 
completely foreign to you, contact the credit bureau (by phone or online) and 
explain that you need more information because you don’t recognize 
the creditor.
» If the creditor made a mistake: Creditors make mistakes, too. You need to 
write or call the creditor to get it to correct the erroneous information that it 
sent to the credit bureau. Phoning the creditor first usually works best. (The 
credit bureau should be able to tell you how to reach the creditor if you don’t 
know how.) If necessary, follow up with a letter or email to document and 
provide a record of your request.CHAPTER 3 Measuring Your Financial Health 41
Whether you speak with a credit bureau or an actual lender, make note of your 
conversations. If representatives say that they can fix the problem, get their 
names, email addresses, and phone extensions, and follow up with them if they 
don’t deliver as promised. If you’re ensnared in bureaucratic red tape, escalate the 
situation by speaking with a department manager. By law, bureaus are required to 
respond to a request to fix a credit error within 30 days — hold the bureau account￾able! If they don’t, you can submit a complaint to the Consumer Financial Protec￾tion Bureau; www.consumerfinance.gov/complaint or by calling 855-411-2372.
Knowing the Difference between 
Bad Debt and Good Debt
Why do you borrow money? Usually, you borrow money because you don’t have 
enough to buy something you want or need — like a college education. A four￾year college education can easily cost $100,000, $150,000, $200,000, $250,000, or 
more. Most people don’t have that kind of spare cash. So borrowing money to 
finance part of that cost enables you to buy the education.
How about a new car? A trip to your friendly local car dealer shows you that a new 
set of wheels will set you back $25,000+. Although more people may have the 
money to pay for that than, say, the college education, what if you don’t? Should 
you finance the car the way you finance the education?
The auto dealers and bankers who are eager to make you an auto loan say that you 
deserve and can afford to drive a nice, new car, and they tell you to borrow away 
(or lease, which I don’t love either — please see Chapter 7). I say, “No! No! No!” 
Why do I disagree with the auto dealers and lenders? For starters, I’m not trying 
to sell you a car or loan from which I derive a profit! More importantly, there’s a 
big difference between borrowing for something that represents a long-term 
investment and borrowing for short-term consumption.
If you spend, say, $1,500 on a vacation, the money is gone. Poof! You may have 
fond memories and photos, but you have nothing of financial value to show for it. 
“But,” you say, “vacations replenish my soul and make me more productive when 
I return . . . the vacation more than pays for itself!”42 PART 1 Getting Started with Personal Finance
I’m not saying that you shouldn’t take a vacation. By all means, take one, two, 
three, or as many vacations and trips as you can afford yearly. But the point is to 
spend what you can afford. If you have to borrow money in the form of an outstand￾ing balance on your credit card for many months in order to take the vacation, 
then you can’t afford it.
Consuming your way to bad debt
I coined the term bad debt to refer to debt incurred for consumption, because such 
debt is harmful to your long-term financial health. (I used this term back in the 
early 1990s when the first edition of this book was published, and I’m flattered 
that others have since used the same terminology.)
You’ll be able to take many more vacations during your lifetime if you save the 
cash in advance. If you get into the habit of borrowing and paying all the associ￾ated interest for vacations, cars, clothing, and other consumer items, you’ll spend 
more of your future income paying back the debt and interest, leaving you with 
less money for your other goals.
The relatively high interest rates that banks and other lenders charge for bad 
(consumer) debt is one of the reasons you’re less able to save money when using 
such debt. Not only does money borrowed through credit cards, auto loans, and 
other types of consumer loans carry a relatively high interest rate, but it also isn’t 
tax-deductible.
I’m not saying that you should never borrow money and that all debt is bad. Good 
debt, such as that used to buy real estate and small businesses, is generally avail￾able at lower interest rates than bad debt and is usually tax-deductible. If well 
managed, these investments may also increase in value. Borrowing to pay for 
educational expenses can also make sense. Education is generally a good long￾term investment because it can increase your earning potential. And student loan 
interest is tax-deductible, subject to certain limitations (see Chapter 8). Taking 
out good debt, however, should be done in proper moderation and for acquiring 
quality assets. See the section later in this chapter, “Assessing good debt: Can you 
get too much?”
Recognizing bad debt overload
Calculating how much debt you have relative to your annual income is a useful 
way to size up your debt load. Ignore, for now, good debt — the loans you may owe 
on real estate, a business, an education, and so on (I get to that in the next sec￾tion). I’m focusing on bad debt, the higher-interest debt used to buy items that 
depreciate in value.CHAPTER 3 Measuring Your Financial Health 43
To calculate your bad debt danger ratio, divide your bad debt by your annual 
income. For example, suppose you earn $40,000 per year. Between your credit 
cards and an auto loan, you have $20,000 of debt. In this case, your bad debt rep￾resents 50 percent of your annual income.
The financially healthy amount of bad debt is zero. While enjoying the convenience of 
credit cards, never buy anything with your credit card(s) that you can’t afford to 
pay off in full when the bill comes at the end of the month. Not everyone agrees 
with me. One major U.S. credit-card company says — in its “educational” materi￾als, which it “donates” to schools to teach students about supposedly sound finan￾cial management — that carrying consumer debt amounting to 10 to 20 percent of 
your annual income is just fine.
When your bad debt danger ratio starts to push beyond 25 percent, it can spell real 
trouble. Such high levels of high-interest consumer debt on credit cards and auto 
loans grow like cancer. The growth of the debt can snowball and get out of control 
unless something significant intervenes. If you have consumer debt beyond 
25 percent of your annual income, see Chapter 6 to find out how to get out of debt.
THE LURE OF EASY CREDIT
Many years ago, I worked as a management consultant and did a lot of work with 
companies in the financial services industry, including some of the major credit-card 
companies. Their game then, as it is now, was to push cards into the hands of as many 
people as possible who have a tendency and propensity to carry debt from month to 
month at high interest rates. Their direct marketing campaigns are quite effective. Ditto 
for the auto manufacturers who successfully entice many people who can’t really afford 
to spend $20,000, $30,000, $40,000, or more on a brand-new car to buy new autos 
financed with an auto loan or lease.
And just as alcohol and cigarette makers target young people with their advertising, 
credit-card companies are recruiting and grooming the next generation of overspend￾ers (young adults).
As widely available as credit is today, so, too, are suggestions for how to spend it. We’re 
bombarded with ads 24/7 on radio, TV, websites, blogs, social media, the sides of buses 
and trains and the tops of taxicabs, people’s clothing, and cars. You couldn’t go a day 
without being exposed to advertising if you wanted to — you’re surrounded!44 PART 1 Getting Started with Personal Finance
How much good debt is acceptable? The answer varies. The key question is this: 
Are you able to save sufficiently to accomplish your goals? In the “Analyzing Your 
Savings” section later in this chapter, I help you figure out how much you’re actu￾ally saving, and in Chapter 4, I help you determine how much you need to save to 
accomplish your goals. (See Chapter 15 to find out how much mortgage debt is 
appropriate to take on when buying a home.)
Borrow money only for investments (good debt) — for purchasing things that 
retain and hopefully increase in value over the long term, such as an education, 
real estate, or your own business. Don’t borrow money for consumption (bad 
debt)  — for spending on things that decrease in value and eventually become 
financially worthless, such as cars, clothing, vacations, and so on.
Assessing good debt: Can you 
get too much?
As with good food, you can get too much of a good thing, including good debt! 
When you incur debt for investment purposes — to buy real estate, for small busi￾ness, even your education — you hope to see a positive return on your invested 
dollars.
But some real-estate investments don’t work out. Some small businesses crash 
and burn, and some educational degrees and programs don’t help in the way that 
students hope they will.
There’s no magic formula for determining when you have too much “good debt.” 
In extreme cases, I’ve seen entrepreneurs, for example, borrow up to their eye￾balls to get a business off the ground. Sometimes this works, and they end up 
financially rewarded, but in most cases, extreme borrowing doesn’t pan out.
Here are three important questions to ponder and discuss with your loved ones 
about the seemingly “good debt” you’re taking on:
» Are you and your loved ones able to sleep well at night and function well 
during the day, free from great worry about how you’re going to meet next 
month’s expenses?
» Are the likely rewards worth the risk that the borrowing entails?
» Are you and your loved ones financially able to save what you’d like to work 
toward your goals (see Chapter 4)?
If you answer “no” to these questions, see the debt-reduction strategies in 
Chapter 6 for more information.CHAPTER 3 Measuring Your Financial Health 45
Playing the credit-card float 
and reward games
Given what I have to say about the vagaries of consumer debt, you may think that 
I’m always against using credit cards. Actually, I have credit cards, and I use 
them — but I pay my balance in full each month. Besides the convenience credit 
cards offer me — in not having to carry around other forms of payment such as 
extra cash and checks — I receive another benefit: I have free use of the bank’s 
money until the time the bill is due. (Some cards offer other benefits, such as fre￾quent flyer miles or other rewards, and I have those types of cards too. For more 
details on reward cards, see Chapter 7.) Also, purchases made on credit cards may 
be contested if the sellers of products or services don’t stand behind what they sell.
When you charge on a credit card that does not have an outstanding balance car￾ried over from the prior month, you typically have several weeks (known as the 
grace period) from the date of the charge to the time when you must pay your bill. 
This is called playing the float. Had you paid for this purchase by cash or check, you 
would have had to shell out your money sooner.
If you have difficulty saving money and plastic tends to break your budget, forget 
the float and reward games. You’re better off not using credit cards. The same 
applies to those who pay their bills in full but spend more because it’s so easy to 
do with a piece of plastic. (For information on alternatives to using credit cards, 
see Chapter 6.)
Analyzing Your Savings
How much money have you actually saved in the past year? By that I mean the 
amount of new money you’ve added to your nest egg, stash, or whatever you like 
to call it.
Most people don’t know or have only a vague idea of the rate at which they’re sav￾ing money. The answer may sober, terrify, or pleasantly surprise you. In order to 
calculate your savings over the past year, you need to calculate your net worth as 
of today and as of one year ago.
The amount you actually saved over the past year is equal to the change in your 
net worth over the past year — in other words, your net worth today minus your 
net worth from one year ago. I know it may be a pain to find statements showing 
what your investments were worth a year ago, but bear with me: It’s a useful 
exercise.46 PART 1 Getting Started with Personal Finance
If you own your home, ignore this in the calculations. (However, you can consider 
the extra payments you make to pay off your mortgage principal faster as new 
savings.) And don’t include personal property and consumer goods, such as your 
car, computer, clothing, and so on, with your assets. (See the earlier section 
“Determining Your Financial Net Worth” if you need more help with this task.)
When you have your net worth figures from both years, plug them into Step 1 of 
Table 3-4. If you’re anticipating the exercise and are already subtracting your net 
worth of a year ago from what it is today in order to determine your rate of sav￾ings, your instincts are correct, but the exercise isn’t quite that simple. You need 
to do a few more calculations in Step 2 of Table 3-4. Why? Well, counting the 
appreciation of the investments you’ve owned over the past year as savings 
wouldn’t be fair. Suppose you bought 100 shares of a stock a year ago at $17 per 
share, and now the value is at $34 per share. Your investment increased in value 
by $1,700 during the past year. Although you’d be the envy of your friends at the 
next party if you casually mentioned your investments, the $1,700 of increased 
value is not “savings.” Instead, it represents appreciation on your investments, so 
you must remove this appreciation from the calculations. (Just so you know, I’m 
not unfairly penalizing you for your shrewd investments — you also get to add 
back the decline in value of your less-successful investments.)

If all this calculating gives you a headache, you get stuck, or you just hate crunch￾ing numbers, try the intuitive, seat-of-the-pants approach: Save a regular por￾tion of your monthly income. You can save it in a separate savings or retirement 
account. For information on tracking your money with technology, turn to 
Chapter 20.
How much do you save in a typical month? Get out the statements for accounts 
you contribute to or save money in monthly. It doesn’t matter if you’re saving 
money in a retirement account that you can’t access — money is money.
Note: If you save, say, $200 per month for a few months, and then you spend it all 
on auto repairs, you’re not really saving. If you contributed $5,000 to an individ￾ual retirement account (IRA), for example, but you depleted money that you had 
from long ago (in other words, money that wasn’t saved during the past year), 
don’t count the $5,000 IRA contribution as new savings.
Most folks should be saving at least 5 to 10 percent of their annual income for 
longer-term financial goals such as retirement (Chapter 4 helps you to fine-tune 
your savings goals). If you’re not saving that much, be sure to read Chapter 7 to 
find out how to reduce your spending and increase your savings.
Evaluating Your Investment Knowledge
Congratulations! If you’ve stuck with me from the beginning of this chapter, 
you’ve completed the hardest part of your financial physical. The physical is much 
easier from here!
Regardless of how much or how little money you have invested in banks, mutual 
funds, brokerages, or other types of accounts, you want to invest your money in 
the wisest way possible. Knowing the rights and wrongs of investing is vital to 
your long-term financial well-being. Few people have so much extra money that 
they can afford major or frequent investing mistakes.
Answering “yes” or “no” to the following questions can help you determine how 
much time you need to spend with my “Investing Crash Course” in Part 3. Note:
The more “no” answers you reluctantly scribble, the more you need to find out 
about investing, and the faster you should turn to Part 3.
_____ Do you understand the investments you currently hold?
_____ Is the money that you’d need to tap in the event of a short-term emer￾gency in an investment where the principal does not fluctuate in value?48 PART 1 Getting Started with Personal Finance
_____ Do you know what marginal income-tax bracket (combined federal and 
state) you’re in, and do you factor that in when choosing investments?
_____ For money outside of retirement accounts, do you understand how these 
investments produce income and gains and whether these types of investments 
make the most sense from the standpoint of your tax situation?
_____ Do you have your money in different, diversified investments that aren’t 
dependent on one or a few securities or one type of investment (that is, bonds, 
stocks, real estate, and so on)?
_____ Is the money that you’re going to need for a major expenditure in the 
next few years invested in conservative investments rather than in riskier invest￾ments such as stocks, pork bellies, or cryptocurrency?
_____ Is the money that you have earmarked for longer-term purposes (more 
than five years) invested to produce returns that are likely to stay ahead of 
inflation?
_____ If you currently invest in or plan to invest in individual stocks, do you 
understand how to evaluate a stock, including reviewing the company’s balance 
sheet, income statement, competitive position, price-earnings ratio versus its 
peer group, and so on?
_____ If you work with a financial advisor, do you understand what that person 
is recommending that you do, are you comfortable with those actions and that 
advisor, and is that person compensated in a way that minimizes potential con￾flicts of interest in the strategies and investments they recommend?
Making and saving money are not guarantees of financial success; rather, they’re 
prerequisites. If you don’t know how to choose sound investments that meet your 
needs, you’ll likely end up throwing money away, which leads to the same end 
result as never having earned and saved it in the first place. Worse still, you won’t 
be able to derive any enjoyment from spending the lost money on things that you 
perhaps need or want. Turn to Part 3 to discover the best ways to invest; other￾wise, you may wind up spinning your wheels working and saving.
Assessing Your Insurance Savvy
In this section, you have to deal with the prickly subject of protecting your assets 
and yourself with insurance. The following questions help you get started. Answer 
“yes” or “no” for each question.CHAPTER 3 Measuring Your Financial Health 49
_____ Do you understand the individual coverages, protection types, and 
amounts of each insurance policy you have?
_____ Does your current insurance protection make sense given your current 
financial situation (as opposed to your situation when you bought the policies)?
_____ If you wouldn’t be able to make it financially without your income, do 
you have adequate long-term disability insurance coverage?
_____ If you have family members who are dependent on your continued 
income, do you have adequate life insurance coverage to replace your income if 
you die?
_____ Do you know when it makes sense to buy insurance through fee-for￾service advisors and companies that sell directly to the public (bypassing agents) 
and when it doesn’t?
_____ Do you carry enough liability insurance on your home, car (including 
umbrella/excess liability), and business to protect all your assets?
_____ Have you recently (in the last year or two) shopped around for the best 
price on your insurance policies?
_____ Do you know whether your insurance companies have good track records 
when it comes to paying claims and keeping customers satisfied? J.D. Power and 
Consumer Reports publishes U.S. property/casualty and auto claims satisfaction 
studies.
That wasn’t so bad, was it? If you answered “no” more than once or twice, don’t 
feel bad — nine out of ten people make significant mistakes when buying insur￾ance. Find your insurance salvation in Part 4. If you answered “yes” to all the 
preceding questions, you could spare yourself from reading Part 4, but bear in 
mind that many people need as much help in this area as they do in other aspects 
of personal finance.CHAPTER 4 Establishing and Achieving Goals 51
Chapter 4
Establishing and 
Achieving Goals
I
n my work as a financial counselor, I always asked new clients what their short￾and long-term personal and financial goals were. Most people reported that 
reflecting on these questions was incredibly valuable, because they hadn’t con￾sidered it for a long time — if ever.
In this chapter, I help you think and dream about what you want to get out of life. 
Although my expertise is in personal finance, I wouldn’t be doing my job if I didn’t 
get you to consider your nonfinancial goals and how money fits into the rest of 
your life goals. So, before I jump into how to establish and save toward common 
financial goals, I discuss how to think about making and saving money, as well as 
how to best fit your financial goals into the rest of your life.
IN THIS CHAPTER

retirement and making up for

Creating Your Own Definition of Wealth
Tune into most media outlets, social media, websites, magazines, and newspa￾pers, and you’ll often see our culture’s obsession with financial wealth. The more 
money financial executives, movie stars, or professional athletes have, the more 
publicity and attention they seem to get. In fact, many publications go as far as 
ranking those people who earn the most or have amassed the greatest wealth!
I can tell you from my decades of working as a personal financial advisor and 
writer and interacting with folks from varied backgrounds that there’s surpris￾ingly little correlation between financial wealth and emotional wealth. That’s why 
in your pursuit of financial wealth and security, you should always remember the 
emotional side. The following sections can help you gain some perspective.
Acknowledging what money can’t buy
Recall the handful of best moments in your life. Odds are these times don’t include 
the time you bought a car or found a designer sweater that you liked. The old say￾ing is true: The most enjoyable and precious things of value in your life can’t be 
bought.
The following statement should go without saying, but I must say it, because too 
many people act as if it isn’t so: Money can’t buy happiness. It’s tempting to think 
that if you could only make 20 percent more or twice as much money, you’d be 
happier because you’d have more money to travel, eat out, and buy that new car 
you’ve been eyeing, right? Not so. A great deal of thoughtful research suggests 
that little relationship exists between money and happiness.
“Wealth is like health: Although its absence can breed misery, having it is no 
guarantee of happiness,” says psychology professor Dr. David G. Myers, who has 
written and researched happiness across cultures for decades. Despite myriad 
technological gadgets and communication devices, cheap air travel, microwaves, 
personal computers, voice mail, smartphones, and all the other stuff that’s sup￾posed to make life easier and more enjoyable, Americans aren’t any happier than 
they were four, five, or six decades ago, according to research conducted by mul￾tiple outfits including Gallup and the National Opinion Research Center. These 
results occur even though incomes, after being adjusted for inflation, have more 
than doubled during that time.
Managing the balancing act
Believe it or not, some people save too much. In my counseling practice, I saw 
plenty of people who fell into that category. If making and saving money are good CHAPTER 4 Establishing and Achieving Goals 53
things, then the more the better, right? Well, take the admittedly extreme case of 
Anne Scheiber, who, on a modest income, started saving at a young age, allowing 
her money to compound in wealth-building investments such as stocks over 
many years. As a result, she was able to amass $22 million before she passed away 
at the age of 101.
Scheiber lived in a cramped studio apartment and never used her investments. She 
didn’t even use the interest or dividends — she lived solely on her Social Security 
benefits and a small pension from her employer. Scheiber was extreme in her 
frugality and obsessed with her savings. As reported by James Glassman in the 
Washington Post, “She had few friends . . . she was an unhappy person, totally con￾sumed by her securities accounts and her money.” Most people, myself included, 
wouldn’t choose to live and save the way that Scheiber did.
Even those who are saving for an ultimate goal can become consumed by their 
saving habits. I see some people pursuing higher-paying jobs and pinching pen￾nies in order to retire early. But sometimes they make too many personal sacri￾fices today while chasing after some vision of their expected lives tomorrow. 
Others get consumed by work and then don’t understand why their family and 
friends feel neglected — or don’t even notice that they do.
Another problem with seeking to amass wealth is that tomorrow may not come. 
Even if all goes according to plan, will you know how to be happy when you’re not 
working if you spend your entire life making money? More important, who will be 
around to share your leisure time? One of the costs of an intense career is time 
spent away from friends and family. You may realize your goal of retiring early, 
but you may be putting off too much living today in expectation of living tomor￾row. As Charles D’Orleans said in 1465, “It’s very well to be thrifty, but don’t 
amass a hoard of regrets.”
Of course, at the other extreme are spendthrifts who live only for today. A friend 
of mine once said, “I’m not into delayed gratification.” “Why save when I may not 
be here tomorrow?” reasons this type of person. “Shop ’til you drop” seems to be 
the motto of this personality type.
The danger of this approach is that tomorrow may come after all, and most people 
don’t want to spend all their tomorrows working for a living. The earlier neglect 
of saving, however, may make it necessary for you to work when you’re much 
older. And if for some reason you can’t work and you have little money to live on, 
much less live enjoyably, the situation can be tragic. The only difference between 
a person without any savings or access to credit and some homeless people is a 
few months of unemployment.54 PART 1 Getting Started with Personal Finance
Making and saving money are like eating food. If you don’t eat enough, you may 
suffer. If you eat too much, it will make you overweight and unhealthy. The right 
amount, perhaps with some extra to spare, affords you a healthy, balanced, peace￾ful existence. Money should be treated with respect and acknowledged for what it 
is — a means to an end and a precious resource that shouldn’t be thoughtlessly 
squandered and wasted.
As Dr. David Myers, whom I introduce earlier in this chapter, says, “Satisfaction 
isn’t so much getting what you want as wanting what you have. There are two 
ways to be rich: One is to have great wealth; the other is to have few wants.”
Find ways to make the most of the money that does pass through your hands, and 
never lose sight of all that is more important than money.
Prioritizing Your Savings Goals
The rest of this chapter discusses the most common financial goals and how to 
work toward them. See whether any of the following reflect your ambitions:
» Owning your home: Renting and dealing with landlords can be a financial 
and emotional drag, so most folks want to buy into the American dream and 
own some real estate — the most basic of which is your own home.
» Making major purchases: Most folks need to plan ahead for major pur￾chases such as a car, living room furniture, vacations, and so on.
» Retiring/Achieving financial independence: No, retiring doesn’t imply sitting on 
a rocking chair watching the world go by while hoping that some long-lost friend, 
your son’s or daughter’s family, or the neighborhood dog comes by to visit. 
Retiring is a catchall term for discontinuing full-time work or perhaps not even 
working for pay at all. Some folks find the concept of “financial independence” 
more to their liking because it conveys reaching a level of financial security where 
you no longer have to work full time or perhaps at all.
» Educating the kids: All those diaper changes, late-night feedings, and trips to 
the zoo aren’t enough to get Junior out of your house and into the real world 
as a productive, self-sufficient adult. You may want to help your children get a 
college education or some other form of higher education or skill training.
» Owning your own business: Many employees want to take on the challenges 
and rewards that come with being the boss. The primary reason that most 
people continue just to dream is that they lack the money to leave their 
primary job. Although many businesses don’t require gobs of start-up cash, 
almost all require that you withstand a substantial reduction in your income 
during the early years.CHAPTER 4 Establishing and Achieving Goals 55
Because everyone is different, you can have goals (other than those in the preced￾ing list) that are unique to your own situation. Accomplishing such goals almost 
always requires saving money. As one of my favorite proverbs says, “Do not wait 
until you are thirsty to dig a well,” so don’t wait to save money until you’re ready 
to accomplish a personal or financial goal!
Knowing what’s most important to you
Unless you earn really big bucks or have a large family inheritance to fall back on, 
your personal and financial desires will probably outstrip your resources. Thus, 
you need to prioritize your goals.
One of the biggest mistakes I see people make is rushing into a financial decision 
without considering what’s really important to them. Because many people get 
caught up in the responsibilities of their daily lives, they often don’t have time for 
reflection.
As a result of my experience counseling and teaching people about better personal 
financial management, I can tell you that the folks who accomplish their goals 
aren’t necessarily smarter or higher-income earners than those who don’t. People 
who identify their goals and then work toward them, which often requires chang￾ing some habits, are the ones who accomplish their goals.
Valuing retirement accounts
Where possible, try to save and invest in accounts that offer you a tax advantage, 
which is precisely what retirement accounts do. These accounts — known by such 
enlightening acronyms and names as 401(k), 403(b), SEP-IRAs, and so on — offer 
tax breaks to people of all economic means. Consider the following advantages to 
investing in retirement accounts:
» Contributions are usually tax-deductible. By putting money in a retirement 
account, not only do you plan wisely for your future, but you also get an 
immediate financial reward: lower taxes, which mean more money available 
for saving and investing. Retirement account contributions generally aren’t 
taxed at either the federal or state income-tax level until withdrawal (but 
they’re still subject to Social Security and Medicare taxes when earned). If 
you’re paying, say, 30 percent between federal and state taxes (see Chapter 8 
to determine your tax bracket), a $5,000 contribution to a retirement account 
lowers your taxes by $1,500.
» In some company retirement accounts, companies match a portion of 
your own contributions. Thus, in addition to tax breaks, you get free extra 
money courtesy of your employer!56 PART 1 Getting Started with Personal Finance
» Returns on your investment compound over time without taxation.
After you put money into a retirement account, any interest, dividends, and 
appreciation add to your account without being taxed. Of course, there’s no 
such thing as a free lunch — these accounts don’t allow for complete tax 
avoidance. Yet you can get a really great lunch at a discount: You get to defer 
taxes on all the accumulating gains and profits until you withdraw the money 
down the road. Thus, more money is working for you over a longer period of 
time. (The Roth IRA that I discuss in Chapter 12 offers no up-front tax breaks 
but does allow future tax-free withdrawal of investment earnings.)
The tax rates on stock dividends and long-term capital gains (investments held 
more than one year) are lower than the tax rates levied on ordinary income 
(such as that earned through working). This fact makes some people think 
that investing through retirement accounts may not be worthwhile because 
all investment earnings are taxed at the relatively high ordinary income-tax 
rates when money is withdrawn from retirement accounts. I’ll cut to the 
chase: The vast majority of people are better off contributing to retirement 
accounts (please see Chapter 8 for more details).
Dealing with competing goals
Unless you enjoy paying higher taxes, why would you save money outside of 
retirement accounts, which shelter your money from taxation? The reason is that 
some financial goals are not easily achieved by saving in retirement accounts. 
Also, retirement accounts have caps on the amount you can contribute annually.
If you’re accumulating money for a down payment on a home or to start or buy a 
business, for example, you’ll probably need to save that money outside of a retire￾ment account. Why? Because if you withdraw funds from retirement accounts 
before age 59½, not only do you have to pay income taxes on the withdrawals, but 
you also generally have to pay early withdrawal penalties of 10 percent of the 
withdrawn amount in federal tax plus whatever your state charges. (See the 
sidebar “Avoiding retirement account early withdrawal penalties” for exceptions 
to this rule.)
Because you’re constrained by your financial resources, you need to prioritize 
your goals. Before funding your retirement accounts and racking up those tax 
breaks, read on to consider your other goals.CHAPTER 4 Establishing and Achieving Goals 57
AVOIDING RETIREMENT ACCOUNT EARLY 
WITHDRAWAL PENALTIES
You can find ways to avoid the early withdrawal penalties that the tax authorities nor￾mally apply. Suppose you read this book at a young age, develop sound financial habits 
early, and save enough to retire before age 59½. In this case, you can take money out of 
your retirement account without triggering penalties (which are normally 10 percent of 
the amount withdrawn for federal income tax plus whatever your state levies). Of 
course, you will still owe income tax on your withdrawals.
The IRS allows you to withdraw money before 59½ if you do so in equal, annual install￾ments based on your life expectancy. (You generally must do such distributions for at 
least five years or until age 59½, whichever is later.) The IRS (this is slightly chilling) even 
has a little table that allows you to look up your life expectancy.
You can now also make penalty-free withdrawals from individual retirement accounts 
for a first-time home purchase (up to $10,000) or qualifying higher educational 
expenses for you, your spouse, your children, or your grandchildren. The other condi￾tions under which you can make penalty-free early withdrawals from retirement 
accounts are not as enjoyable: If you have major medical expenses (exceeding 10 per￾cent of your income) or a disability, you may be exempt from the penalties under cer￾tain conditions. (You will still owe ordinary income tax on withdrawals.)
Another situation that allows for penalty-free IRA withdrawals is when you’ve been 
unemployed for at least 12 weeks and the withdrawal is used to pay your health insur￾ance premiums.
If you get into a financial pinch while you’re still employed, be aware that some com￾pany retirement plans allow you to borrow against your balance. This tactic is like loan￾ing money to yourself — the interest payments go back into your account.
If you lose your job and withdraw retirement account money simply because you need 
it to live on, the penalties do apply. However, if you’re not working and you’re earning so 
little income that you need to tap your retirement account, you surely fall into a low tax 
bracket. The lower income taxes you pay (when compared to the taxes you would have 
paid on that money had you not sheltered it in a retirement account in the first place) 
should make up for most or all the penalty.58 PART 1 Getting Started with Personal Finance
Building Emergency Reserves
Because you don’t know what the future holds, preparing for the unexpected is 
financially wise. Even if you’re the lucky sort who sometimes finds $5 bills on 
street corners, you can’t control the sometimes chaotic world in which we live.
Conventional wisdom says that you should have approximately six months’ worth 
of living expenses put away for an emergency. This particular amount may or may 
not be right for you, because it depends, of course, on how expensive the emer￾gency is. Why six months, anyway? And where should you put it?
How much of an emergency stash you need depends on your situation. I recom￾mend saving the following emergency amounts under differing circumstances (in 
Chapter 13, I recommend preferred places to invest this money):
» Three months’ living expenses: Choose this option if you have other 
accounts, such as a 401(k), or family members and close friends whom you 
can tap for a short-term loan. This minimalist approach makes sense when 
you’re trying to maximize investments elsewhere (for example, in retirement 
accounts) or you have stable sources of income (employment or otherwise).
» Six months’ living expenses: This amount is appropriate if you don’t have 
other places to turn for a loan or you have some instability in your employ￾ment situation or source of income.
» Up to one year’s living expenses: Set aside this much if your income 
fluctuates wildly from year to year or if your profession involves a high risk of 
job loss, finding another job can take you a long time, and you don’t have 
other places to turn for a loan.
If your only current source of emergency funds is a high-interest credit card, first 
save at least three months’ worth of living expenses in an accessible account 
before funding a retirement account or saving for other goals.
Saving to Buy a Home or Business
When you’re starting out financially, deciding whether to save money to buy a 
home or to put money into a retirement account presents a dilemma. In the long 
run, owning your own home is generally a wise financial move. On the other hand, 
saving sooner for retirement/financial independence makes achieving that goal 
easier.CHAPTER 4 Establishing and Achieving Goals 59
Presuming both goals are important to you, save toward both buying a home and
for retirement. If you’re eager to own a home, you can throw all your savings 
toward achieving that goal and temporarily put your retirement savings on hold. 
Save for both purposes simultaneously if you’re not in a rush.
You may be able to have the best of both worlds if you work for an employer that 
allows borrowing against retirement account balances. You can save money in the 
retirement account and then borrow against it for the down payment of a home. 
Be extra careful, though. Retirement account loans typically must be paid back 
within a set number of years (check with your employer) or immediately if you 
quit or lose your job. As I mention earlier in this chapter, you’re also allowed to 
make penalty-free withdrawals of up to $10,000 from individual retirement 
accounts toward a first-time home purchase.
When saving money to start or buy a business, most people encounter the same 
dilemma they face when deciding to save to buy a house: If you fund your retire￾ment accounts to the exclusion of earmarking money for your small-business 
dreams, your entrepreneurial aspirations may never become a reality. Generally, I 
advocate hedging your bets by saving money in your tax-sheltered retirement 
accounts as well as toward your business venture in a nonretirement account. As 
I discuss in Part 3, an investment in your own small business can produce great 
rewards, so you may feel comfortable focusing your savings on your own business.
Funding Kids’ Educational Expenses
Wanting to provide for your children’s future is perfectly natural, but doing so 
before you’ve saved adequately toward your own goals can be a major financial 
mistake. The college financial-aid system effectively penalizes you for saving 
money outside of retirement accounts and penalizes you even more if the money’s 
invested in the child’s name.
This concept may sound selfish, but financially speaking, you need to take care of 
your financial future first. Take advantage of saving through your tax-sheltered 
retirement accounts before you set aside money in custodial savings accounts for 
your kids. This practice isn’t selfish: Do you really want to have to leech off your 
kids when you’re old and frail because you didn’t save sufficiently for yourself?
Of course, not everyone should attend four-year colleges, especially costly ones. 
Cost-effective alternatives to college continue to grow and provide solid career 
opportunities for the right students. Please see Chapter  14 for a discussion of 
higher-education options and a complete explanation of how to save for educa￾tional expenses.60 PART 1 Getting Started with Personal Finance
Saving for Big Purchases
If you want to buy a car, the latest smartphone, and a vacation to Thailand, do 
not — I repeat, do not — buy such things with consumer credit (that is, by incur￾ring and carrying debt from month to month to finance the purchase on a 
credit-card or auto loan). As I explain in Chapter 6, cars, boats, vacations, and the 
like are consumer items, not wealth-building investments, such as real estate or 
small businesses. A car begins to depreciate the moment you drive it off the sales 
lot. Money spent on a vacation is worthless the moment you arrive back home. 
(I know your memories will be priceless, but they won’t pay the bills.)
Don’t deny yourself gratification; just learn how to delay or modify it. Get into the 
habit of saving for your larger consumer purchases to avoid paying for them over 
time with high-interest consumer credit. When saving up for a consumer 
purchase such as a car, a money-market account or short-term bond fund (see 
Chapter 13) is a good place to store your short-term savings.
Paying for high-interest consumer debt can cripple your ability not only to save 
for long-term goals but also to make major purchases in the future. Interest on 
consumer debt is exorbitantly expensive — upwards of 20 percent on credit cards. 
When contemplating the purchase of a consumer item on credit, add up the total 
interest you’d end up paying on your debt and call it the price of instant 
gratification.
Preparing for Retirement/Financial 
Independence
Many people toil away at work, dreaming about a future in which they can stop 
the daily commute and grind; get out from under that deluge of voice mails, 
emails, text messages, and other never-ending technological intrusions; and do 
what they want, when they want. People often assume that this magical day will 
arrive when they retire or win the lottery — whichever comes first.
I’ve never cared much for the term retire, which seems to imply idleness or the 
end of usefulness to society. But if retirement means not having to work at a job 
(especially one you don’t enjoy) and having financial flexibility and independence, 
then I’m all for it.CHAPTER 4 Establishing and Achieving Goals 61
Many folks aspire to retire sooner rather than later. But this idea has some obvious 
problems. First, you set yourself up for disappointment. If you want to retire by 
your mid-60s (when Social Security kicks in), you need to save enough money to 
support yourself for 20 to 30 years, maybe longer. Two to three decades is a long 
time to live off your savings. You’re going to need a good-sized chunk of money — 
more than most people realize.
DON’T NEGLECT NONFINANCIAL 
RETIREMENT PREPARATIONS
Investing your money is just one (and not even the most important) aspect of preparing 
for your retirement. In order to enjoy the lifestyle that your retirement savings will 
provide you, you should invest energy into other areas of your life as well:
• Few things are more important than your health. Without your health, enjoying 
the good things in life can be hard. Unfortunately, many people aren’t motivated 
to care about their health until after they discover problems. By then, it may 
be too late.
• Although exercising regularly, eating a balanced and nutritious diet including 
proper hydration, driving safely, and avoiding substance abuse can’t guarantee you 
a healthful future, these good habits go a long way toward preventing many of the 
most common causes of death and debilitating disease. Regular medical exams 
also are important in detecting problems early.
• In addition to your physical health, be sure to invest in your psychological health. 
People live longer and have happier and healthier lives when they have a circle of 
family and friends around them for support.
Unfortunately, many people become more isolated and lose regular contact with busi￾ness associates, friends, and family members as they grow older.
Happy retirees tend to stay active, getting involved in volunteer organizations and new 
social circles. They may travel to see old friends or younger relatives who may be too 
busy to visit them.
Treat retirement life like a bubbly, inviting hot tub set at 102 degrees. You want to ease 
yourself in nice and slow; jumping in hastily can take most of the pleasantness out of 
the experience. Abruptly leaving your job without a plan for spending all that free time 
is an invitation to boredom and depression. Everyone needs a sense of purpose and a 
sense of routine. Establishing hobbies, volunteer work, or a sideline business while 
gradually cutting back your regular work schedule can be a terrific way to ease into 
retirement.62 PART 1 Getting Started with Personal Finance
The earlier you hope to retire, the more money you need to set aside and the 
sooner you have to start saving — unless you plan to work part-time in retire￾ment to earn more income! See Chapter 12 for more details about how to save for 
retirement.
Many of the people I speak to say that they do want to retire, and most say “the 
sooner, the better.” Yet more than half of Americans between the ages of 18 and 
34, and a quarter of those ages 35 to 54, have not begun to save for retirement. 
When I asked one of my middle-aged counseling clients, who had saved little for 
retirement, when he would like to retire, he deadpanned, “Sometime before I die.” 
If you’re in this group (and even if you’re not), determine where you stand finan￾cially regarding retirement. If you’re like most working people, you need to 
increase your savings rate for retirement.
Figuring out what you need for retirement/
financial independence
If you hope to someday reduce the time you spend working or cease working 
altogether, you’ll need sufficient savings to support yourself. Many people  — 
particularly young people and those who don’t work well with numbers  — 
underestimate the amount of money needed to retire. To figure out how much you 
should save per month to achieve your retirement goals, you need to crunch a few 
numbers. (Don’t worry  — this number-crunching is usually easier than doing 
your taxes.)
Luckily for you, you don’t have to start cold. Studies show how people typically 
spend money before and during retirement. Most people need about 70 to 
80 percent of their pre-retirement income throughout retirement to maintain 
their standard of living. For example, if your household earns $70,000 per year 
before retirement, you’re likely to need $49,000 to $56,000 (70 to 80 percent of 
$70,000) per year during retirement to live the way you’re accustomed to living. 
The 70 to 80 percent range is an average. Some people may need more simply 
because they have more time on their hands to spend their money. Others adjust 
their standard of living and live on less.
So how do you figure out what you’re going to need? The following three profiles 
provide a rough estimate of the percentage of your pre-retirement income you’re 
going to need during retirement. Pick the one that most accurately describes your 
situation. If you fall between two descriptions, pick a percentage in between 
those two.CHAPTER 4 Establishing and Achieving Goals 63
To maintain your standard of living in retirement, you may need about
» 65 percent of your pre-retirement income if you
• Save a large amount (15 percent or more) of your annual earnings
• Are a high-income earner
• Will own your home debt-free by the time you retire
• Do not anticipate leading a lifestyle in retirement that reflects your current 
high income
If you’re an especially high-income earner who lives well beneath your means, 
you may be able to do just fine with even less than 65 percent. Pick an annual 
dollar amount or percentage of your current income that will allow the kind of 
retirement lifestyle you desire.
» 75 percent of your pre-retirement income if you
• Save a reasonable amount (5 to 14 percent) of your annual earnings
• Will still have some mortgage debt or a modest rent to pay by the time 
you retire
• Anticipate having a standard of living in retirement that’s comparable to 
what you have today
» 85 percent of your pre-retirement income if you
• Save little or none of your annual earnings (less than 5 percent)
• Will have a relatively significant mortgage payment or sizeable rent to pay 
in retirement
• Anticipate wanting or needing to maintain your current lifestyle through￾out retirement
Of course, you can use a more precise approach to figure out how much you need 
per year in retirement. Be forewarned, though, that using a more-personalized 
method is far more time-consuming, and because you’re making projections into 
an uncertain future, it may not be any more accurate than the simple method I 
explain here. If you’re data-oriented, you may feel comfortable tackling this 
method: Figure out where you’re spending your money today (worksheets are 
available in Chapter  5) and then work up some projections for your expected 
spending needs in retirement (the information in Chapter  20 may help you 
as well).64 PART 1 Getting Started with Personal Finance
Understanding retirement building blocks
Did you play with Lego blocks when you were a child? You start by building a 
foundation on the ground, and then you build up. Before you know it, you’re cre￾ating bridges, castles, and animal figures. Although preparing financially for 
retirement isn’t exactly like playing with blocks, the concept is the same: You 
need a basic foundation so your necessary retirement reserves can grow.
If you’ve been working steadily, you may already have a good foundation, even if 
you haven’t been actively saving toward retirement. In the pages ahead, I walk 
you through the probable components of your future retirement income and 
show you how to figure how much you should be saving to reach particular 
retirement goals.
Counting on Social Security
According to polls, about half of American adults under the age of 35, and more 
than a third of those between the ages of 35 and 49, think that Social Security 
benefits will not be available by the time they retire.
Contrary to widespread skepticism, Social Security should be available when you 
retire, no matter how old you are today. In fact, Social Security is one of the sacred 
cow political programs. Imagine what would happen to the group of politicians 
who voted to greatly curtail benefits! (Congress may make some reductions in 
benefits, probably for the highest income earners, at some point due to the federal 
debt problems.)
If you think that you can never retire because you don’t have any money saved, 
I’m happy to inform you that you’re probably wrong. You likely have some Social 
Security. But Social Security generally isn’t enough to live on comfortably.
Social Security is intended to provide you with a subsistence level of retirement 
income for the basic necessities: food, shelter, and clothing. Social Security is not 
intended to be your sole source of income. Some of the elderly are quite dependent 
upon Social Security: It’s the only source of income for about 20 percent of the 
elderly, and about two out of three Social Security recipients derive at least half of 
their total retirement income from their Social Security retirement check. Few 
working people can maintain their current lifestyles into retirement without sup￾plementing Social Security with personal savings and company retirement plans.
HOW MUCH WORK MAKES ME ELIGIBLE?
To be eligible to collect Social Security benefits, you need to have worked a 
minimum number of calendar quarters. If you were born after 1928, you need 
40 quarters of work credits to qualify for Social Security retirement benefits.CHAPTER 4 Establishing and Achieving Goals 65
If, for some reason, you work only the first half of a year or only during the sum￾mer months, don’t despair. You don’t need to work part of every quarter to get a 
quarter’s credit. You get credits based on the income you earn during the year. As 
of this writing, you get the full four quarters credited to your account if you earn 
$6,560 or more ($1,640 per credit) in a year. To get 40 quarters of coverage, you 
basically need to work (at least portions of) ten years.
To get credits, your income must be reported, and you must pay taxes on it 
(including Social Security tax). In other words, you and those you employ encoun￾ter problems when you neglect to declare income or you pay people under the 
table: You may be cheating yourself, or others, out of potentially valuable 
benefits.
HOW MUCH WILL I GET FROM SOCIAL SECURITY?
The average monthly benefit Social Security pays out to retirees is about $1,830. 
The higher your employment earnings have been on average, the more you can 
expect to receive (the maximum current monthly payment is about $3,630). 
If you’re married and one of you doesn’t work for pay, the nonworking spouse 
collects 50 percent of what the working spouse collects. Working spouses are eli￾gible for either individual benefits or half of their spouse’s benefits — whichever 
amount is greater.
To get a more precise handle on your Social Security benefits, visit the Social 
Security Administration (SSA) website at www.ssa.gov/myaccount/ or call the 
SSA at 800-772-1213 and request Form 7004 (“Request for a Social Security State￾ment”), which allows you to receive a record of your reported earnings and an 
estimate of your Social Security benefits. Check your earnings record, because 
occasional errors do arise and — surprise — they usually aren’t in your favor. The 
Social Security Administration mails Social Security benefit statements to workers 
age 60 and older who have not established a “my Social Security account.”
Planning your personal savings/investment 
strategy
Money you’re saving toward retirement can include money under the mattress as 
well as money in a retirement account such as an individual retirement account 
(IRA), 401(k), or similar plan (see Chapter 12). You may also earmark investments 
in nonretirement accounts for your retirement.
Equity (the difference between the market value less any mortgage balances owed) 
in rental or investment real estate can be counted toward your retirement as well. 
Deciding whether to include the equity in your primary residence (your home) is 
trickier. If you don’t want to count on using this money in retirement, don’t 
include it when you tally your stash.66 PART 1 Getting Started with Personal Finance
You may want to count a portion of your home equity in your total assets for 
retirement. Some people sell their homes when they retire and move to a lower￾cost area, move closer to family, or downsize to a more manageably sized home. 
And a small number of older retirees are tapping their homes’ equity through 
reverse mortgages (see Chapter 15 for information on mortgages).
Making the most of pensions
Pension plans are a benefit offered by some employers — mostly larger and older 
organizations and government agencies. Even if your current employer doesn’t 
offer a pension, you may have earned pension benefits through a previous job.
MORE SOCIAL SECURITY DETAILS
When the Social Security system was created in the 1930s, its designers underestimated 
how long people would live in retirement. Thanks to scientific advances and improved 
medical care, life expectancies have risen substantially since that time. As a result, many 
recent retirees get back far more than they paid into the system.
The age at which you can start collecting full benefits has increased, and it may increase 
again. In the “good old days” (prior to changes made in Social Security regulations in 
1983), you could collect full Social Security payments at age 65, assuming you were eligi￾ble. Under current rules, if you were born before 1938, you’re still eligible to collect full 
Social Security benefits at age 65. If you were born after 1959, you have to wait until age 
67 for full benefits. If you were born between 1938 and 1959, full benefits are payable 
to you at age 66 (plus or minus some number of months, depending on the year you 
were born).
These regulations may seem unfair, but they’re necessary for updating the system to fit 
with the realities of increased longevity, large federal budget deficits, and aging baby 
boomers. Without changes, the Social Security system could collapse, because it would 
be fed by a relatively small number of workers while supporting a large number of 
retirees.
In addition to paying for retirement-income checks for retirees, a portion of your Social 
Security taxes also help fund disability insurance for you, survivor income insurance for 
your financial dependents, and Medicare (the health insurance program for retirees).
The amount of Social Security benefits you receive in retirement depends on your aver￾age earnings during your working years. Don’t worry about the fact that you probably 
earned a lot less many years ago. The Social Security benefits calculations increase your 
older earnings to account for the lower cost of living and wages in prior years.CHAPTER 4 Establishing and Achieving Goals 67
The plans I’m referring to are known as defined-benefit plans. With these plans, 
you qualify for a monthly benefit amount to be paid to you in retirement based on 
your years of service for a specific employer.
Although each company’s plan differs, all plans calculate and pay benefits based 
on a formula. A typical formula may credit you with 1.5 percent of your salary for 
each year of service (full-time employment). For example, if you work ten years, 
you earn a monthly retirement benefit worth 15 percent of your monthly salary.
Pension benefits can be quite valuable. In the better plans, employers put away the 
equivalent of 5 to 10 percent of your salary to pay your future pension. This money 
is in addition to your salary — you never see it in your paycheck, and it isn’t taxed. 
The employer puts this money away in an account for your retirement.
To qualify for pension benefits, you don’t have to stay with an employer long 
enough to receive the 25-year gold watch. Under current government regulations, 
employees must be fully vested (entitled to receive full benefits based on years of 
service upon reaching retirement age) after five years of full-time service.
Defined-benefit pension plans are becoming rarer for two major reasons:
» They’re costly for employers to fund and maintain. Many employees don’t 
understand how these plans work and why they’re so valuable, so companies 
don’t get mileage out of their pension expenditures — employees don’t see 
the money, so they don’t appreciate the company’s generosity.
» Most of the new jobs being generated in the U.S. economy are with smaller 
companies or with larger, younger companies that typically don’t offer these 
types of plans.
More employers offer plans like 401(k)s, in which employees elect to save money 
out of their own paychecks. Known as defined-contribution plans, these plans allow 
you to save toward your retirement at your own expense rather than at your 
employer’s expense. (To encourage participation in defined-contribution plans, 
some employers “match” a portion of their employees’ contributions.) More of 
the burden and responsibility of investing for retirement falls on your shoulders 
with 401(k) and similar plans, so understanding how these plans work is impor￾tant. Most people are ill-equipped to know how much to save and how to invest 
the money. The retirement planning worksheet in the next section can help you 
get started with figuring out the amount you need to save. (Part 3 shows you how 
to invest.)68 PART 1 Getting Started with Personal Finance
Crunching numbers for your retirement
Now that you’ve toured the components of your future retirement income, take a 
shot at tallying where you stand in terms of retirement preparations. Don’t be 
afraid to do this exercise — it’s not difficult, and you may find that you’re not in 
such bad shape. I even explain how to catch up if you find that you’re behind in 
saving for retirement.
Note: The following worksheet (Table 4-1) and the Growth Multiplier (Table 4-2) 
assume that you’re going to retire at age 66 and that your investments will pro￾duce an annual rate of return that is 4 percent higher than the rate of inflation. 
(For example, if inflation averages 3 percent, this table assumes that you will earn 
7 percent per year on your investments.)
To get a more precise handle on where you stand in terms of retirement planning 
(especially if you’d like to retire earlier than your mid-60s), turn to Chapter 20, 
where I recommend retirement planning software and websites that can ease your 
number-crunching burdens.

Making up for lost time
If the amount you need to save per month to reach your retirement goals seems 
daunting, all is not lost. Remember: Winners never quit, and quitters never win. 
Here are my top recommendations for making up for lost time:
» Question your spending. You have two ways to boost your savings: Earn 
more money or cut your spending (or do both). Most people don’t spend their 
money nearly as thoughtfully as they earn it. See Chapter 7 for suggestions 
and strategies for reducing your spending.

» Be more realistic about your retirement age. If you extend the age at 
which you plan to retire, you get a double benefit: You earn and save money 
for more years, and you spend your nest egg over fewer years. Of course, if 
your job is making you miserable, this option may not be too appealing. Try to 
find work that you find more fulfilling, and consider working, at least part￾time, during your “early” retirement years.
» Use your home equity. The prospect of tapping the cash in your home can 
be troubling. After getting together the down payment, you probably worked 
for many years to pay off your mortgage. But what’s the use of owning a 
house free of mortgage debt when you lack sufficient retirement reserves? 
All the money that’s tied up in the house can be used to help increase your 
standard of living in retirement.
You have a number of ways to tap your home’s equity. You can sell your home 
and either move to a lower-cost property or rent an apartment. Current tax 
laws allow you to realize up to $250,000 in tax-free profit from the sale of your 
house ($500,000 if you’re married). Another option is a reverse mortgage, in 
which you get a monthly income check as you build a loan balance against the 
value of your home. The loan is paid when your home is finally sold. (See 
Chapter 15 for more information about reverse mortgages.)
» Get your investments growing. The faster the rate at which your money 
grows and compounds, the less you need to save each year to reach your 
goals. (Make sure, however, that you’re not reckless; don’t take huge risks in 
the hopes of big returns.) Earning just a few extra percentage points per year 
on your investments can dramatically slash the amount you need to save. The 
younger you are, the more powerful the effect of compounding interest. For 
example, if you’re in your mid-30s and your investments appreciate 6 percent 
per year (rather than 4 percent) faster than the rate of inflation, the amount 
you need to save each month to reach your retirement goals drops by about 
40 percent! (See Part 3 for more on investing.)
» Turn a hobby into supplemental retirement income. Even if you earn a 
living in the same career over many decades, you have skills that can be put to 
profitable use. Pick something you enjoy and are good at, develop a business 
plan, and get smart about how to market your services and wares (check out 
the latest edition of Small Business For Dummies from Wiley, which I co-wrote 
with veteran entrepreneur Jim Schell). Remember, as people get busier, more 
specialized services are created to support their hectic lives. A demand for 
quality, homemade goods of all varieties also exists. Be creative! You never 
know — you may wind up profiled in a business publication!
» Invest to gain tax-free and other free money. By investing in a tax-wise 
fashion, you can boost the effective rate of return on your investments 
without taking on additional risk.CHAPTER 4 Establishing and Achieving Goals 71
In addition to the tax benefits you gain from funding most types of retirement 
accounts in this chapter (see the earlier section “Valuing retirement accounts”), 
some employers offer free matching money. Also, the government offers 
tax credits (see Chapter 8) for lower-income earners who use retirement 
accounts.
As for money outside of tax-sheltered retirement accounts, if you’re in 
a relatively high tax bracket, you may earn more by investing in tax-free 
investments and other vehicles that minimize highly taxed distributions.
» Think about inheritances. Although you should never count on an inheri￾tance to support your retirement, you may inherit money someday. If you 
want to see what impact an inheritance has on your retirement calculations, 
add a conservative estimate of the amount you expect to inherit to your 
current total savings in Table 4-1.2

Managing Where 
Your Money Goes
As a financial counselor, I’ve worked with people who have small incomes, 
people who have six-figure and even seven-figure incomes, and everyone 
in between. At every income level, people fall into one of the following 
three categories:
» People who spend more than they earn (accumulating debt)
» People who spend all that they earn (saving nothing — breaking even)
» People who save 2, 5, 10, or even 20 percent or more (growing savings)
I’ve seen $50,000 earners who save 20 percent of their income ($10,000), $100,000 
earners who save just 5 percent ($5,000), and people earning well into six figures 
annually who save nothing or are adding debt.
Suppose that you currently earn $50,000 per year and spend all of it. You may 
wonder, “How can I save money?” Good question! Rather than knock yourself out 
at a second job, you may want to try living below your income — in other words, 
spending less than you earn. Consider that for every discontented person earning 
and spending $50,000 per year, someone else is out there making do on $45,000.
IN THIS CHAPTER
» Understanding why people 
overspend
» Tracking your spending76 PART 2 Spending Less, Saving More
A great many people live on less than you make. If you spend as they do, you can 
save and invest the difference. In this chapter, I examine why people overspend 
and help you look at your own spending habits. When you know where your money 
goes, you can find ways to spend less and save more (see Chapter 7) so that some￾day, you, too, can live richly and achieve your goals.
Now, it’s entirely possible that in part because of the relatively high cost of living 
where you currently live, you may feel that you don’t have much, if any, ability to 
really lower your expenses. That may be true, but this may get you thinking about 
moving or taking a job in a location with more reasonable costs. In a strong 
economy or if you work in (or can switch to) an in-demand occupation, you may 
have more options than you realize.
Examining Overspending
If you’re like most people, you must live within your means to accomplish your 
financial goals. Doing so requires consistently spending less than you earn and 
then investing your savings intelligently (unless you plan on winning the lottery 
or receiving a large inheritance). To put yourself in a position that allows you to 
start saving, take a close look at your spending habits.
Many folks earn just enough to make ends meet. And some can’t even do that; 
they simply spend more than they make. The result of such spending habits is, of 
course, an accumulation of debt.
Most of the influences in society encourage you to spend. Think about it: More 
often than not, you’re referred to as a consumer in the media and in the hallowed 
halls of government. You’re not referred to as a person, a citizen, or a human 
being. This section looks at some of the adversaries you’re up against as you 
attempt to control your spending.
Having access to credit
As you probably already know, spending money is easy. Thanks to ATMs, credit 
cards, myriad smartphone apps, PayPal, Venmo, and so on, your money is always 
available, 24/7.
Sometimes it may seem as though lenders are trying to give away money by mak￾ing credit so easily available. But this free money is a dangerous illusion. Credit is 
most perilous when you make consumption purchases you can’t afford in the first 
place. When it comes to consumer debt (credit cards, auto loans, and the like), CHAPTER 5 Managing Where Your Money Goes 77
lenders aren’t giving away anything except the misfortune of getting in over your 
head, racking up high interest charges, and delaying your progress toward your 
financial and personal goals.
Misusing credit cards
The modern-day bank credit card was invented by Bank of America near the end 
of the baby boom. The credit industry has been generally growing ever since.
If you pay your bill in full every month, credit cards offer a convenient way to buy 
things with an interest-free, short-term loan. But if you carry your debt over from 
month to month at high interest rates, credit cards encourage you to live beyond 
your means. Credit cards make it easy and tempting to spend money that you 
don’t have.
You’ll never pay off your credit-card debt if you keep charging on your card and 
make only the minimum monthly payments. Interest continues to pile up on your 
outstanding debt. Paying only the minimum monthly payment can lead to your 
carrying high-interest debt on your card for decades (not just months or years)!
Some credit cards sell cardholders “insurance” at a cost of 10 to 15-plus percent 
annually to pay the minimum payments due on credit-card balances for those 
months that the debtor is unable to pay because of some life transition event (such 
as a job layoff). With credit-card interest rates around 18 percent on balances, 
when you add the insurance charges, the total annual interest rate is upward of 
around 30 percent!
If you have a knack for charging up a storm and spending more than you should 
with those little pieces of plastic, only one solution exists: Get rid of your credit 
cards. Get out the scissors and cut up that plastic. Go cold turkey. You can function 
without them. (See Chapter 6 for details on how to live without credit cards.)
Taking out car loans
Walking onto a car lot and going home with a new car that you can’t afford 
(or wouldn’t choose to afford if you have that cash) if you had to pay cash is easy. 
The dealer gets you thinking in terms of monthly payments that sound small 
when compared to what that four-wheeler is really gonna cost you. Auto loans are 
easy for just about anyone to get.
Suppose you’re tired of driving around in your old clunker. The car is battle￾scarred and boring, and you don’t like being seen in it. Plus, the car is likely to 
need more repairs in the months ahead and perhaps doesn’t have all the safety 
features of newer models. So off you go to your friendly local car dealer.78 PART 2 Spending Less, Saving More
You start looking around at all the shiny, new cars, and then — like the feeling 
you experience when spotting a water fountain on a scorching hot day — there it 
is: your new car. It’s sleek and clean, and has air conditioning, an amazing audio 
system, a rearview camera, all the latest technology, and heated seats. Before you 
can read the fine print on the sticker page on the side window, the salesperson 
moseys on up next to you. He gets you talking about how nice the car is, the 
weather, or anything but the sticker price of that car.
“How can this guy afford to spend time with me without knowing if I can afford 
this thing?” you think. After a test drive and more talk about the car, the weather, 
and your love life (or lack thereof) comes your moment of truth. The salesperson, 
it seems, doesn’t care about how much money you have. What you do for a living 
and whether you have lots of money or very little doesn’t matter. The car is only 
$399 a month!
“That price isn’t bad,” you think. Heck, you were expecting to hear that the car 
would cost you at least 30 grand. Before you know it, the dealer runs a credit 
report on you and has you sign a few papers, and minutes later you’re driving 
home in your new car.
The dealer wants you to think in terms of monthly payments because the cost 
sounds so cheap: $399 for a car. But, of course, that’s $399 per month for many, 
many months. You’re gonna be payin’ forever — after all, you just bought a car 
that cost a huge chunk of your yearly take-home income.
But it gets worse. What does the total sticker price come to when interest charges 
on borrowed money are added in? (Even if interest charges are low, you may still 
be buying a car with a sticker price you can’t afford.) And what about the cost of 
insurance, registration, and maintenance over the seven or so years that you’ll 
probably own the car? Now you’re probably up to more than a year’s worth of your 
income. Ouch! (See Chapter 7 for information on how to spend what you can afford 
on a car.)
Bending to outside influences and agendas
You go out with some friends to dinner, a sporting event, or a show. Try to remem￾ber the last time one of you said, “Let’s go someplace (or do something) less 
costly. I can’t afford to spend this much.” On the one hand, you don’t want to be 
a stick in the mud. But on the other hand, some of your friends may have more 
money than you do — and the ones who don’t may not be saving money or may 
be running up debt fast.
Some people just have to see the latest hit movie, wear the newest designer 
clothes, or get the latest smartphone or tablet. They don’t want to feel left out or 
behind the times.CHAPTER 5 Managing Where Your Money Goes 79
When was the last time you heard someone say that they decided to forgo a pur￾chase because they were saving for retirement or a home purchase? It doesn’t 
happen often, does it? Just dealing with the here-and-now and forgetting your 
long-term needs and goals is tempting. This mindset leads people to toil away for 
too many years in jobs they dislike.
Living for today has its virtues: Your tomorrow may not come. But odds are good 
that it will. Will you still feel the same way about today’s spending decisions 
tomorrow? Or will you feel guilty that you again failed to stick to your goals?
Your spending habits should be driven by your desires and plans, not those of oth￾ers. If you haven’t set any goals yet, you may not know how much you should be 
saving. Chapter 4 helps you kick-start the planning and saving process.
Spending to feel good
Life is full of stress, obligations, and demands. “I work hard,” you may say, “and 
darn it, I deserve to indulge!” Especially after your boss took the credit for your 
most recent great idea or blamed you for their latest screwup. So you buy some￾thing expensive or go to a fancy restaurant. Feel better? You probably won’t when 
the bill arrives. And the more you spend, the less you save, and the longer you’ll 
be stuck working for jerks like your boss!
Just as people can become addicted to alcohol, tobacco, television, and the inter￾net, some people also become addicted to the high they get from spending. 
Researchers can identify a number of psychological causes for a spending addic￾tion, with some relating to how your parents handled money and spending. (And 
you thought you’d identified all the problems you can blame on Mom and Dad!)
If your spending and debt problems are chronic, or even if you’d simply like to be 
a better consumer and saver, see Chapter 6 for more information.
Assessing Your Spending
As I explain in Chapter 2, most folks should be tracking their spending. The one 
category of people I would exempt from needing to monitor (categorize) where 
their money goes are those who are satisfied with the portion of their income 
they’re able to save and who are saving enough to accomplish their goals. In this 
section, I provide some guidelines and frameworks for tracking your spending.80 PART 2 Spending Less, Saving More
Tracking spending the “low-tech” way
Analyzing your spending is a little bit like being a detective. Your goal is to recon￾struct the spending. You probably have some major clues at your fingertips or 
somewhere on the desk or computer where you handle your finances.
Unless you keep meticulous records that detail every dollar you spend, you won’t 
have perfect information. Don’t sweat it! A number of sources can enable you to 
detail where you’ve been spending your money. To get started, get out/access your
» Recent pay stubs
» Recent tax returns (federal and state)
» Online banking/bill payment record
» Log of checks paid and monthly debit-card transactions
» Credit- and charge-card bills and transactions
Ideally, you want to assemble the information needed to track 12 months of 
spending. But if your spending patterns don’t fluctuate greatly from month to 
month (or you won’t complete the exercise if it means compiling a year’s worth of 
data), you can reduce your data gathering to one six-month period, or to every 
second or third month for the past year. If you take a major vacation or spend a 
large amount on gifts during certain months of the year, make sure that you 
include these months in your analysis. Also account for insurance or other pay￾ments that you may choose not to pay monthly and instead pay quarterly, semi￾annually, or annually.
Purchases made with cash are the hardest to track because they don’t leave a 
paper trail. Over the course of a week or perhaps even a month, you could keep a 
record of everything you buy with cash. Tracking cash can be an enlightening 
exercise, but it can also be tedious. (See the section “Tracking your spending on 
‘free’ websites and apps” later in this chapter.) If you lack the time and patience, 
you can try estimating. Think about a typical week or month — how often do you 
buy things with cash? For example, if you eat lunch out four days a week, paying 
around $8 per meal, that’s about $130 a month. You may also want to try adding 
up all the cash withdrawals from your checking account statement (or any other 
account from which you do cash transactions) and then working backward to try 
to remember where you spent the cash.
Separate your expenditures into as many useful and detailed categories as possi￾ble. Table 5-1 gives you a suggested format; you can tailor it to fit your needs. 
Remember, if you lump too much of your spending into broad, meaningless cat￾egories like “Other,” you’ll end up right back where you started — wondering 
where all the money went. (Note: When completing the tax section in Table 5-1, CHAPTER 5 Managing Where Your Money Goes 81
report the total tax you paid for the year as tabulated on your annual income-tax 
return — and take the total Social Security and Medicare taxes paid from your 
end-of-year pay stub — rather than the tax withheld or paid during the year.)

Tracking your spending on 
“free” websites and apps
Software programs, apps, and websites can assist you with paying bills and track￾ing your spending. The main advantage of using these is that you can continually 
track your spending as long as you keep entering/uploading the information. Such 
tools can even help speed up the check-writing process (after you figure out how 
to use them, which isn’t always an easy thing to do).
Plenty of folks have trouble saving money and reducing their spending. Thus, it’s 
no surprise that in the increasingly crowded universe of free websites and apps, 
plenty are devoted to supposedly helping you to reduce your spending.
More of these sites keep springing up, but among those you may have heard of 
and stumbled upon are Budget Tracker, Mint, and Yodlee. I’ve kicked the tires and 
checked out these sites, and frankly, I have mixed-to-negative feelings about 
them. The biggest problem that I have with these “free” tools is that they’re 
loaded with advertising and/or have affiliate relationships with companies. This 
simply means that these companies get paid if you click on a link to one of their 
recommended service providers and buy what they are selling.
This compensation, of course, creates an enormous conflict of interest and thor￾oughly taints any recommendation made by “free” sites that profit from affiliate 
referrals. For starters, they have no incentive or reason to recommend companies 
that won’t pay them an affiliate fee. And, there’s little — if any — screening of 
companies for quality, service levels, and other criteria important to you as a 
consumer.
Also, be forewarned that after registering you as a user, the first thing most of 
these tools want you to do is connect directly to your financial institutions (banks, 
brokerages, investment companies) and download your investment account and 
spending data. If your intuition tells you this may not be a good idea, trust your 
instincts. Yes, there are security concerns, but those pale in comparison to privacy 
concerns and apprehension about the endless pitching to you of products and 
services.
Another problem I have with these websites is the incredibly simplistic calculators 
that they have. One that purports to help with retirement planning doesn’t allow 
users to choose a retirement age younger than 62 and has no provisions for part￾time work. When it asks about your assets, it makes no distinction between equity 
in your home and financial assets (stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and so on). CHAPTER 5 Managing Where Your Money Goes 85
Finally, these sites generally offer no phone support, so if you encounter a prob￾lem using them, you’re relegated to ping-ponging emails in the hope of getting 
your questions answered.
One app that I have reviewed and liked is Goodbudget. For more on that app and 
others, see Chapter 20.
Paper, pencil, and a calculator can work just fine for tracking your spending. 
For those who want to use technology to track bill payments and expenses, 
I recommend the best software packages and discuss websites and apps in detail 
in Chapter 20.CHAPTER 6 Dealing with Debt 87
Chapter 6
Dealing with Debt
Accumulating bad debt (consumer debt) by buying things like new living 
room furniture or a new car that you really can’t afford is like living on a 
diet of sugar and caffeine: a quick fix with little nutritional value. Borrowing 
on your credit card to afford an extravagant vacation is detrimental to your long￾term financial health.
When you use debt for investing in your future, I call it good debt (see Chapter 3). 
Borrowing money to pay for a quality education that improves your career, to buy 
real estate, or to invest in a small business is like eating a well-balanced and 
healthy diet. That’s not to say that you can’t get yourself into trouble when using 
good debt. Just as you can gorge yourself on too much good food, you can develop 
financial indigestion from too much good debt or when using debt to finance poor 
investments or educational options.
In this chapter, I mainly help you battle the pervasive problem of consumer debt. 
Getting rid of your bad debts may be even more difficult than giving up the junk 
foods you love. But in the long run, you’ll be glad you did; you’ll be financially 
healthier and emotionally happier. And after you get rid of your high-cost con￾sumer debts, make sure you practice the best way to avoid future credit problems: 
Don’t borrow with bad debt.

Before you decide which debt reduction strategies make sense for you, you must 
first consider your overall financial situation (see Chapter  3) and assess your 
alternatives. (I discuss strategies for reducing your current spending  — which 
help you free up more cash to pay down your debts — in the next chapter.)
Using Savings to Reduce Your 
Consumer Debt
Many people build a mental wall between their savings and investment accounts 
and their consumer debt accounts. By failing to view their finances holistically, 
they simply fall into the habit of looking at these accounts individually. The 
thought of putting a door in that big wall doesn’t occur to them. This section helps 
you see how your savings can be used to lower your consumer debt.
Understanding how you gain
If you have the savings to pay off consumer debt, like high-interest credit-card 
and auto loans, consider doing so. (Make sure you pay off the loans with the high￾est interest rates first.) Sure, you diminish your savings, but you also reduce your 
debts. Although your savings and investments may be earning decent returns, the 
interest you’re paying on your consumer debts is likely higher.
Paying off consumer loans on a credit card at, say, 12 percent is like finding an 
investment with a guaranteed return of 12 percent — tax-free. You would actually 
need to find an investment that yielded even more — around 18 percent — to net 
12 percent after paying taxes on those investment returns in order to justify not 
paying off your 12 percent loans. The higher your tax bracket (see Chapter 8), the 
higher the return you need on your investments to justify keeping high-interest 
consumer debt.
Even if you think that you’re an investing genius and you can earn more on your 
investments, swallow your ego and pay down your consumer debts anyway. In 
order to chase that higher potential return from investments, you need to take 
substantial risk. You may earn more investing in that hot stock tip or bargain real 
estate, but you probably won’t.
If you use your savings to pay down consumer debts, be careful to leave yourself 
enough of an emergency cushion. (In Chapter 4, I tell you how to determine what 
size emergency reserve you should have.) You want to be in a position to with￾stand an unexpected large expense or temporary loss of income. On the other CHAPTER 6 Dealing with Debt 89
hand, if you use savings to pay down credit-card debt, you can run your credit￾card balances back up in a financial pinch (unless your card gets canceled), or you 
can turn to a family member or wealthy friend for a low-interest loan.
Finding the funds to pay 
down consumer debts
Have you ever reached into the pocket of an old jacket and found a folded $20 bill 
you forgot you had? Stumbling across some forgotten funds is always a pleasant 
experience. But before you root through all your closets in search of stray cash to 
help you pay down that nagging consumer debt, check out some of these financial 
jacket pockets you may have overlooked:
» Borrow against your cash value life insurance policy. If you did business 
with a life insurance agent, that person probably sold you a cash value policy 
because it pays high commissions to insurance agents. Or perhaps your 
parents bought one of these policies for you when you were a child. Borrow 
against the cash value to pay down your debts. (Note: You may want to 
consider discontinuing your cash value policy altogether and simply withdraw 
the cash balance — see Chapter 17 for details.)
» Sell investments held outside of retirement accounts. Maybe you have 
some shares of stock or a Treasury bond. Consider cashing in these invest￾ments to pay down your consumer loans. Just be sure to consider the tax 
consequences of selling these investments. If possible, sell investments that 
won’t generate a big tax bill.
» Tap the equity in your home. If you’re a homeowner, you may be able to tap 
in to your home’s equity, which is the difference between the property’s 
market value and the outstanding loan balance. You can generally borrow 
against real estate at a lower interest rate and get a tax deduction, subject to 
interest deduction limitations. However, you must take care to ensure that 
you don’t overborrow on your home and risk losing it to foreclosure.
» Borrow against your employer’s retirement account. Check with your 
employer’s benefits department to see whether you can borrow against your 
retirement account balance. The interest rate is usually reasonable. Be 
careful, though — if you leave or lose your job, you have to fully repay the 
loan by the federal income tax return due date of the following year; other￾wise, the unpaid balance is treated as a taxable distribution. Also recognize 
that you’ll miss out on investment returns on the money borrowed.90 PART 2 Spending Less, Saving More
» Lean on family. They know you, love you, realize your shortcomings, and 
probably won’t be as cold-hearted as some bankers. Money borrowed from 
family members can have strings attached, of course. Treating the obligation 
seriously is important. To avoid misunderstandings, write up a simple 
agreement listing the terms and conditions of the loan. Unless your family 
members are the worst bankers I know, you’ll probably get a fair interest rate, 
and your family will have the satisfaction of helping you out. Just be sure to 
pay them back.
Decreasing Debt When You Lack Savings
If you lack savings to throw at your consumer debts, and you’re currently spend￾ing all your income (and more!), you need to figure out how you can decrease your 
spending (see Chapter 7 for lots of great ideas) and/or increase your income. In 
the meantime, you need to slow the growth of your debt.
Reducing your credit card’s interest rate
Different credit cards charge different interest rates. So why pay 14, 16, or 
18 percent (or more) when you can pay less? The credit-card business is compet￾itive. Until you get your debt paid off, slow the growth of your debt by reducing 
the interest rate you’re paying. Here are sound ways to do that:
» Apply for a lower-rate credit card. If you’re earning a decent income, you’re 
not too burdened with debt, and you have a clean credit record, qualifying for 
lower-rate cards is relatively painless. Some persistence (and cleanup work) 
may be required if you have income and debt problems or nicks in your credit 
report. After you’re approved for a new, lower-interest-rate card, you can 
simply transfer your outstanding balance from your higher-rate card.
CreditCards.com’s website (www.creditcards.com) carries information 
on low-interest-rate and no-annual-fee cards (among others, including 
secured cards).
» Call the bank(s) that issued your current high-interest-rate credit card(s) 
and say that you want to cancel your card(s) because you found a 
competitor that offers no annual fee and a lower interest rate. Your bank 
may choose to match the terms of the “competitor” rather than lose you as a 
customer. Sticking with your current card may be better for you because 
canceling the credit card, especially if it’s one you’ve had for a number of 
years, may lower your credit score in the short term.CHAPTER 6 Dealing with Debt 91
» While you’re paying down your credit-card balance(s), stop making new 
charges on cards that have outstanding balances. Many people don’t 
realize that interest starts to accumulate immediately when they carry a 
balance. You have no grace period — the 20 or so days you normally have to 
pay your balance in full without incurring interest charges — if you carry a 
credit-card balance from month to month.
Understanding all credit-card 
terms and conditions
Avoid getting lured into applying for a credit card that hypes an extremely low 
interest rate. One such card advertised a 1.9 percent rate, but you had to dig into 
the fine print for the rest of the story.
First, any card that offers such a low interest rate will honor that rate only for a 
short period of time — in this case, six months. After six months, the interest rate 
skyrocketed to nearly 15 percent.
But wait, there’s more: Make just one late payment or exceed your credit limit, 
and the company raises your interest rate to 19.8 percent (or even 24 percent, 
29 percent, or more) and slaps you with a $25 fee — $35 thereafter. If you want a 
cash advance on your card, you get socked with a fee equal to 3 percent of the 
amount advanced. (Some banks have even advertised 0 percent interest rates — 
although that rate generally has applied only to balances transferred from another 
card, and such cards have been subject to all the other vagaries discussed in this 
section.)
I’m not saying that everyone should avoid this type of card. Such a card may make 
sense for you if you want to transfer an outstanding balance and then pay off that 
balance within a matter of months and cancel the card to avoid getting socked 
with the card’s high fees.
If you hunt around for a low-interest-rate credit card, be sure to review all the 
terms and conditions. Start by reading the uniform rates and terms disclosure, 
which details the myriad fees and conditions (especially how much your interest 
rate can increase for missed or late payments). Also, be sure you understand how 
the future interest rate is determined on cards that charge variable interest rates.92 PART 2 Spending Less, Saving More
Cutting up your credit cards
If you have a tendency to live beyond your means by buying on credit, get rid of 
the culprit — the credit card (and other consumer credit). To kick the habit, a 
smoker needs to toss all the cigarettes, and an alcoholic needs to get rid of all the 
booze. Cut up all your credit cards and call the card issuers to cancel your accounts. 
And when you buy consumer items such as cars and furniture, do not apply for the 
E-Z credit.
The world worked fine back in the years B.C. (Before Credit). Think about it: Just a 
few generations ago, credit cards didn’t even exist. People paid with cash and 
checks — imagine that! You can function without buying anything on credit. In 
certain cases, you may need a card as collateral — such as when renting a car. 
When you bring back the rental car, however, you can pay with cash or a check. 
Leave the card at home in the back of your sock drawer or freezer, and pull 
(or thaw) it out only for the occasional car rental.
With the trend toward a cashless society, it may be difficult to go cash/check only, 
but it can be done, and may be important enough to do so to get out of debt. Some 
businesses are saying no to cash. You could carry a charge card like the American 
Express, which must be paid in full each month as no credit is extended.
If you can trust yourself, keep a separate credit card only for new purchases that 
you know you can absolutely pay in full each month. No one needs three, five, or 
ten credit cards! You can live with one (and actually none), given the wide accep￾tance of most cards.
Retailers such as department stores and gas stations just love to issue cards. Not 
only do these cards charge outrageously high interest rates, but they’re also not 
widely accepted like Visa and Mastercard. Virtually all retailers accept Visa and Mas￾tercard. More credit lines mean more temptation to spend what you can’t afford.
If you decide to keep one widely accepted credit card instead of getting rid of them 
all, be careful. You may be tempted to let debt accumulate and roll over for a 
month or two, starting up the whole horrible process of running up your 
consumer debt again. Rather than keeping one credit card, consider getting a 
debit card.
Discovering debit cards: The best of 
both worlds?
Credit cards are the main reason today’s consumers are buying more than they 
can afford. So logic says that one way you can keep your spending in check is to 
stop using your credit cards. But in a society that’s used to the widely accepted CHAPTER 6 Dealing with Debt 93
Visa and Mastercard plastic for purchases, changing habits is hard. And you may 
be legitimately concerned that carrying your checkbook or cash can be a hassle or 
can be costly if you’re mugged.
Debit cards potentially offer the best of both worlds. The beauty of the debit card 
is that it offers you the convenience of making purchases with a piece of plastic 
without the temptation or ability to run up credit-card debt. Debit cards keep you 
from spending money you don’t have and help you live within your means.
A debit card looks just like a credit card with either the Visa or Mastercard logo. The 
big difference between debit cards and credit cards is that, as with checks, debit￾card purchase amounts are deducted electronically from your checking account 
within days. (Bank ATM cards are also debit cards; however, if they lack a Visa or 
Mastercard logo, they’re accepted by far fewer merchants.)
If you switch to a debit card and you keep your checking account balance low 
and don’t ordinarily balance your checkbook, you may need to start balancing it. 
Otherwise, you may face charges for overdrawing your account.
Here are some other differences between debit and credit cards:
» If you pay your credit-card bill in full and on time each month, your credit card 
gives you free use of the money you owe until it’s time to pay the bill. Debit 
cards take the money out of your checking account almost immediately.
» Credit cards make it easier for you to dispute charges for problematic 
merchandise through the issuing bank. Most banks allow you to dispute 
charges for up to 60 days after purchase and will credit the disputed amount 
to your account pending resolution. Most debit cards offer a much shorter 
window, typically less than one week, for making disputes.
Because moving your checking account can be a hassle, see whether your current 
bank offers Visa or Mastercard debit cards. If your bank doesn’t offer one, shop 
among the major banks in your area, which are likely to offer the cards. Because 
such cards come with checking accounts, make sure you do some comparison 
shopping among the different account features and fees.
A number of investment firms offer Visa or Mastercard debit cards with their asset 
management accounts. Not only can these investment firm “checking accounts” 
help you break the credit-card overspending habit, but they may also get you 
thinking about saving and investing your money. One drawback of these accounts 
is that some of them require higher minimum initial investment amounts. Among 
brokerages offering accounts with debit cards and competitive investment offer￾ings and prices are Fidelity (phone 800-343-3548; website www.fidelity.com), 
and Schwab (phone 800-435-4000; website www.schwab.com).94 PART 2 Spending Less, Saving More
Turning to Credit Counseling Agencies
Prior to the passage of the 2005 bankruptcy laws discussed later in this chapter, 
each year hundreds of thousands of debt-burdened consumers sought “counsel￾ing” from credit counseling service offices. Now, more than a million people 
annually get the required counseling. Unfortunately, some people find that the 
service doesn’t always work the way it’s pitched.
Beware biased advice at credit 
counseling agencies
Leona Davis, whose family racked up significant debt due largely to unexpected 
medical expenses and a reduction in her income, found herself in trouble with too 
much debt. So she turned to one of the large, nationally promoted credit counsel￾ing services, which she heard about through its advertising and marketing 
materials.
WHAT IF YOUR DEBIT CARD IS 
LOST OR STOLEN?
Personal credit cards and debit cards offer you similar so-called “zero liability” if some￾one illegally uses your card. If your debit card is lost or stolen and someone makes 
fraudulent charges on your debit card, you simply sign statements with your bank stat￾ing that the charges aren’t yours. If money was deducted from your account for unau￾thorized purchases, you’ll be reimbursed typically in a matter of days. (You should 
report your card as lost or stolen as soon as you notice it is missing.)
However, cards designated and listed as business (commercial) cards may not have the 
same zero liability as consumer cards. Generally speaking, banks view businesses as 
riskier and more prone to internal fraud. Suppose, for example, that your business 
issued debit cards to its employees and one of them gave it to a friend to use and then 
said the card was lost and those purchases were fraudulent.
Given this background, therefore, I recommend getting a separate consumer debit card 
for your small business (simply keep your name, not the business’s, on the account) or 
use a bank that offers the same protections on their business debit cards as on their 
consumer debit cards. Otherwise, you can get socked with a hefty bill that you didn’t 
bargain for. And don’t provide debit cards to your small business’s employees.CHAPTER 6 Dealing with Debt 95
The credit counseling agency Davis went to markets itself as a “nonprofit com￾munity service.” Davis, like many others I know, found that the “service” was not 
objective. After her experience, Davis feels that a more appropriate name for the 
organization she worked with would be the Credit Card Collection Agency.
Unbeknownst to Davis and most of the other people who use supposed credit 
counseling agencies is the fact that the vast majority of their funding comes from 
the fees that creditors pay them. Most credit counseling agencies collect fees on a 
commission basis — just as collection agencies do! Their strategy is to place those 
who come in for help on their “debt management program.” Under this program, 
counselees like Davis agree to pay a certain amount per month to the agency, 
which in turn parcels out the money to the various creditors.
Because of Davis’s tremendous outstanding consumer debt (it exceeded her 
annual income), her repayment plan was doomed to failure. Davis managed to 
make 10 months’ worth of payments, largely because she raided a retirement 
account for $28,000. Had Davis filed bankruptcy (which she ultimately needed to 
do), she would’ve been able to keep her retirement money. But Davis’s counselor 
never discussed the bankruptcy option. “I received no counseling,” says Davis. 
“Real counselors take the time to understand your situation and offer options. 
I was offered one solution: a forced payment plan.”
Others who have consulted various credit counseling agencies, including one of 
my research assistants who, undercover, visited an office to seek advice, confirm 
that some agencies use a cookie-cutter approach to dealing with debt. Such agen￾cies typically recommend that debtors go on a repayment plan that has the con￾sumer pay, say, 3 percent of each outstanding loan balance to the agency, which 
in turn pays the money to creditors.
Unable to keep up with the enormous monthly payments, Davis finally turned to 
an attorney and filed for bankruptcy — but not before she had unnecessarily lost 
thousands of dollars because of the biased recommendations.
Although credit counseling agencies’ promotional materials and counselors aren’t 
shy about highlighting the drawbacks to bankruptcy, counselors are reluctant to 
discuss the negative impact of signing up for a debt payment plan. Davis’s coun￾selor never told her that restructuring her credit-card payments would tarnish 
her credit reports and scores. The counselor my researcher met with also neglected 
to mention this important fact. When asked, the counselor was evasive about the 
debt management program’s impact on his credit report.
If you’re considering bankruptcy or are otherwise unable to meet your current 
debt obligations, first be sure to read the rest of this chapter. Second, interview 
any counseling agency you may be considering working with. Remember that 
you’re the customer and you should do your homework first and be in control. 96 PART 2 Spending Less, Saving More
Don’t allow anyone or any agency to make you feel that they’re in a position of 
power simply because of your financial troubles.
Ask questions and avoid debt 
management programs
Probably the most important question to ask a counseling agency is whether it 
offers debt management programs (DMPs), whereby you’re put on a repayment plan 
with your creditors and the agency gets a monthly fee for handling the payments. 
You do not want to work with an agency offering DMPs because of conflicts of 
interest. An agency can’t offer objective advice about all your options for dealing 
with debt, including bankruptcy, if it has a financial incentive to put you on a DMP.
The Institute for Financial Literacy is a good agency that doesn’t offer DMPs 
(phone 207-873-0068; website www.financiallit.org).
Here are some additional questions that the Federal Trade Commission suggests 
you ask prospective counseling agencies you may hire:
» What are your fees? Are there setup and/or monthly fees? Get a specific 
price quote in writing.
» What if I can’t afford to pay your fees or make contributions? If an organiza￾tion won’t help you because you can’t afford to pay, look elsewhere for help.
» Will I have a formal written agreement or contract with you? Don’t sign 
anything without reading it first. Make sure all verbal promises are in writing.
» Are you licensed to offer your services in my state? You should work only 
with a licensed agency.
» What are the qualifications of your counselors? Are they accredited or 
certified by an outside organization? If so, by whom? If not, how are they 
trained? Try to use an organization whose counselors are trained by a 
nonaffiliated party.
» What assurance do I have that information about me (including my 
address, phone number, and financial information) will be kept confi￾dential and secure? A reputable agency can provide you with a clearly 
written privacy policy.
» How are your employees compensated? Are they paid more if I sign up 
for certain services, if I pay a fee, or if I make a contribution to your 
organization? Employees who work on an incentive basis are less likely to 
have your best interests in mind than those who earn a straight salary that 
isn’t influenced by your choices.CHAPTER 6 Dealing with Debt 97
Filing Bankruptcy
For consumers in over their heads, the realization that their monthly income is 
increasingly exceeded by their bill payments is usually a traumatic one. In many 
cases, years can pass before people consider a drastic measure like filing bank￾ruptcy. Both financial and emotional issues come into play in one of the most 
difficult and painful, yet potentially beneficial, decisions.
When Helen, a mother of two and a sales representative, contacted a bankruptcy 
attorney, her total credit-card debt equaled her annual gross income. As a result 
of her crushing debt load, she couldn’t meet her minimum monthly credit-card 
payments. Rent and food gobbled up most of her earnings. What little was left 
over went to the squeakiest wheel.
Creditors were breathing down Helen’s back. “I started getting calls from collec￾tion departments at home and work — it was embarrassing,” she said. Helen’s 
case is typical in that credit-card debt was the prime cause of her bankruptcy.
As the debt load grew (partly exacerbated by the high interest rates on the cards), 
more and more purchases got charged — from the kids’ clothing to repairs for the 
car. Finally, after running out of cash, she had to take a large cash advance on her 
credit cards to pay for rent and food.
Despite trying to work out lower monthly payments to keep everyone happy, most 
of the banks to which Helen owed money were inflexible. “When I asked one 
bank’s Visa department if it preferred that I declare bankruptcy because it was 
unwilling to lower my monthly payment, the representative said yes,” Helen says. 
After running out of options, Helen filed personal bankruptcy.
Understanding bankruptcy benefits
Bankruptcy allows certain types of debts to be completely eliminated or discharged.
Debts that typically can be discharged include credit-card, medical, auto, utilities, 
and rent.
Debts that may not be canceled generally include child support, alimony, student 
loans, taxes, and court-ordered damages (for example, drunk driving settle￾ments). Helen, the subject of the preceding section, was an ideal candidate for 
bankruptcy because her debts (credit cards) were dischargeable. Helen also met 
another important criterion — her level of high-interest consumer debt relative 
to her annual income was high (100 percent). When this ratio (discussed in 
Chapter 3) exceeds 25 percent, filing bankruptcy may be your best option.98 PART 2 Spending Less, Saving More
Eliminating your debt also allows you to start working toward your financial 
goals. Depending on the amount of debt you have outstanding relative to your 
income, you may need a decade or more to pay it all off. In Helen’s case, at the age 
of 48, she had no money saved for retirement, and she was increasingly unable to 
spend money on her children.
Filing bankruptcy offers not only financial benefits but emotional benefits, as 
well. “I was horrified at filing, but it is good to be rid of the debts and collection 
calls — I should have filed six months earlier. I was constantly worried. When 
I saw homeless families come to the soup kitchen where I sometimes volunteer, 
I thought that someday that could be me and my kids,” says Helen.
Coming to terms with 
bankruptcy drawbacks
Filing bankruptcy, needless to say, has a number of drawbacks. First, bankruptcy 
appears on your credit report for up to ten years, so you’ll have difficulty obtain￾ing credit, especially in the years immediately following your filing. However, if 
you already have problems on your credit report (because of late payments or a 
failure to pay previous debts), damage has already been done. And without sav￾ings, you’re probably not going to be making major purchases (such as a home) in 
the next several years anyway.
If you do file bankruptcy, getting credit in the future is still possible. You may be 
able to obtain a secured credit card, which requires you to deposit money in a bank 
account equal to the credit limit on your credit card. Of course, you’ll be better off 
without the temptation of any credit cards and better served with a debit card. 
Also, know that if you can hold down a stable job, most creditors will be willing to 
WHAT YOU CAN KEEP IF YOU 
FILE BANKRUPTCY
In every state, you can retain certain property and assets when you file for bankruptcy. 
You may be surprised to discover that in some states, you can keep your home regard￾less of its value! Most states, though, allow you to protect a certain amount of home 
equity.
Additionally, you’re allowed to retain some other types and amounts of personal prop￾erty and assets. For example, most states allow you to retain household furnishings, 
clothing, pensions, and money in retirement accounts. So don’t empty your retirement 
accounts or sell off personal possessions to pay debts unless you’re absolutely sure that 
you won’t be filing bankruptcy.CHAPTER 6 Dealing with Debt 99
give you loans within a few years of your filing bankruptcy. Almost all lenders 
ignore bankruptcy after five to seven years.
Another drawback of bankruptcy is that it costs money, and those expenses have 
jumped higher due to the requirements of bankruptcy laws (more on that in a 
moment). I know this expense seems terribly unfair. You’re already in financial 
trouble — that’s why you’re filing bankruptcy! Court filing and legal fees can eas￾ily exceed $1,500, especially in higher cost-of-living areas.
And finally, most people find that filing bankruptcy causes emotional stress. 
Admitting that your personal income can’t keep pace with your debt obligations is 
painful. Although filing bankruptcy clears the decks of debt and gives you a fresh 
financial start, feeling a profound sense of failure (and sometimes shame) is com￾mon. Bankruptcy filers are reluctant to talk about it with others, including family 
and friends.
Another part of the emotional side of filing bankruptcy is that you must open your 
personal financial affairs to court scrutiny and court control during the several 
months it takes to administer a bankruptcy. A court-appointed bankruptcy trustee 
oversees your case and tries to recover as much of your property as possible to 
satisfy the creditors — those to whom you owe money.
Some people also feel that they’re shirking responsibility by filing for bankruptcy. 
One client I worked with should have filed, but she couldn’t bring herself to do it. 
She said, “I spent that money, and it’s my responsibility to pay it back.”
If you file for bankruptcy, don’t feel bad about not paying back the bank. Credit 
cards are one of the most profitable lines of business for banks. (Now you know 
why your mailbox and email in-box are always stuffed with solicitations for more 
cards.) The nice merchants from whom you bought the merchandise have already 
been paid. Charge-offs — the banker’s term for taking the loss on debt that you 
discharge through bankruptcy — are the banker’s cost, which is another reason 
why the interest rate is so high on credit cards and why borrowing on them is a 
bad idea.
Deciphering the bankruptcy laws
The Bankruptcy Abuse and Prevention Act of 2005 has a significant effect on con￾sumers who are considering filing for bankruptcy. As you may be able to tell from 
the bill’s name, major creditors, such as credit-card companies, lobbied heavily 
for new laws. Although they didn’t get everything they wanted, they got a lot, 
which — not surprisingly — doesn’t benefit those folks in dire financial condition 
contemplating bankruptcy. Don’t despair, though; help and information can 100 PART 2 Spending Less, Saving More
overcome the worst provisions of this law. Here are the major elements of the 
personal bankruptcy laws:
» Required counseling: Before filing for bankruptcy, individuals must complete 
credit counseling, the purpose of which is to explore your options for dealing 
with debt, including (but not limited to) bankruptcy and developing a debt 
repayment plan.
Historically, many supposed “counseling” agencies have provided highly 
biased advice. Be sure to read the earlier section “Turning to Credit 
Counseling Agencies” to find out what conflicts of interest agencies have and 
to get advice on how to pick a top-notch agency.
To have debts discharged through bankruptcy, the new law requires a 
second type of counseling called “Debtor Education.” All credit counseling 
and debtor education must be completed by an approved organization 
on the U.S. Trustee’s website (www.justice.gov/ust). Click on the link 
Credit Counseling & Debtor Education (www.justice.gov/ust/credit￾counseling-debtor-education-information).
» Means testing: Some high-income earners may be precluded from filing the 
form of bankruptcy that actually discharges debts (called Chapter 7) and 
instead be forced to use the form of bankruptcy that involves a repayment 
plan (called Chapter 13).
Recognizing that folks living in higher cost-of-living areas tend to have higher 
incomes, the law allows for differences in income by making adjustments 
based upon your state of residence and family size. The expense side of the 
equation is considered as well, and allowances are determined by county and 
metropolitan area. I won’t bore you with the details and required calculations 
here. Few potential filers are affected by this provision. For more information, 
click on the Means Testing Information section (www.justice.gov/ust/
means-testing) on the U.S. Trustee’s website (www.justice.gov/ust).
» Increased requirements placed on filers and attorneys: The means testing 
alone has created a good deal of additional work for bankruptcy filers, work 
generally done by attorneys. Filers, including lawyers, must also attest to the 
accuracy of submitted information, which has attorneys doing more verifica￾tion work. Thus, it’s no surprise that when the new bankruptcy laws were 
passed, legal fees increased significantly — jumps of 30 to 40 percent were 
common.
» New rules for people who recently moved: Individual states have their own 
provisions for how much personal property and home equity you can keep. 
Prior to the passage of the current laws, in some cases, shortly before filing 
bankruptcy, people actually moved to a state that allowed them to keep more. 
Under the new law, you must live in the state for at least two years before CHAPTER 6 Dealing with Debt 101
filing bankruptcy in that state and using that state’s personal property 
exemptions. To use a given state’s homestead exemption, which dictates how 
much home equity you may protect, you must have lived in that state and 
owned a home for at least 40 months.
Choosing between Chapter 7 and 13
You can file one of two forms of personal bankruptcy: Chapter 7 or Chapter 13. 
Here are the essentials regarding each type:
» Chapter 7 bankruptcy allows you to discharge, or cancel, certain debts.
This form of bankruptcy makes the most sense when you have significant 
debts that you’re legally allowed to cancel. (See “Understanding bankruptcy 
benefits” earlier in this chapter for details on which debts can be canceled, or 
discharged.)
» Chapter 13 bankruptcy comes up with a repayment schedule that 
requires you to pay your debts over several years. Chapter 13 stays on 
your credit record (just like Chapter 7), but it doesn’t eliminate debt, so its value 
is limited — usually to dealing with debts like taxes that can’t be discharged 
through bankruptcy. Chapter 13 can keep creditors at bay until you work out 
a repayment schedule in the courts.
Seeking bankruptcy advice
If you want to find out more about the pros, cons, and details of filing for bank￾ruptcy, pick up a copy of The New Bankruptcy: Will It Work for You? by attorney Cara 
O’Neill (Nolo Press). If you’re comfortable with your decision to file and you think 
you can complete the paperwork, check out How to File for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy, by 
attorneys Albin Renauer and Cara O’Neill (Nolo Press), which comes with all the 
necessary filing forms.
Stopping the Spending/Consumer 
Debt Cycle
Regardless of how you deal with paying off your debt, many folks are in real dan￾ger of falling back into old habits. Backsliding happens not only to people who file 
bankruptcy but also to those who use savings or home equity to eliminate their 
debt. This section speaks to that risk and tells you what to do about it.102 PART 2 Spending Less, Saving More
Resisting the credit temptation
Getting out of debt can be challenging, but I have confidence that you can do it 
with this book by your side. In addition to the ideas I discuss earlier in this chapter 
(such as eliminating all your credit cards and getting a debit card), the following 
list provides some additional tactics you can use to limit the influence credit cards 
hold over your life. (If you’re concerned about the impact that any of these tactics 
may have on your credit rating, please see Chapter 3.)
» Reduce your credit limit. If you choose not to take my advice and get rid of 
all your credit cards or get a debit card, be sure to keep a lid on your credit 
card’s credit limit (the maximum balance allowed on your card). You don’t 
have to accept the increase just because your bank keeps raising your credit 
limit to reward you for being such a profitable customer. Call your credit-card 
service’s toll-free phone number and lower your credit limit to a level you’re 
comfortable with.
» Replace your credit card with a charge card. A charge card (such as the 
American Express Card) requires you to pay your balance in full each billing 
period. You have no credit line or interest charges. Of course, spending more 
than you can afford to pay when the bill comes due is possible. But you’ll be 
much less likely to overspend if you know you have to pay in full monthly.
» Never buy anything on credit that depreciates in value. Meals out, cars, 
clothing, and shoes all depreciate in value. Don’t buy these things on credit. 
Borrow money only for sound investments — education that advances your 
career prospects, real estate, or your own business, for example.
» Think in terms of total cost. Everything sounds cheaper in terms of monthly 
payments — that’s how salespeople entice you into buying things you can’t 
afford. Take a calculator along, if necessary, to tally up the sticker price, 
interest charges, and upkeep. The total cost will scare you. It should.
» Stop the junk mail avalanche. Look at your daily mail — I bet half of it is 
solicitations and mail-order catalogs. You can save some trees and some time 
sorting junk mail by removing yourself from most mailing lists. To remove 
your name from mailing lists, contact the Direct Marketing Association (you 
can register through its website at www.dmachoice.org/register.php.) 
They now charge a $4 administrative fee for a ten-year registration period.
To remove your name from the major credit-reporting agency lists that are 
used by credit-card solicitation companies, call 888-567-8688 or visit www.
optoutprescreen.com online. Also, tell any credit-card companies you keep 
cards with that you want your account marked to indicate that you don’t want 
any of your personal information shared with telemarketing firms.
» Limit what you can spend. Go shopping with a small amount of cash and no 
plastic or checks. That way, you can spend only what little cash you have with you!CHAPTER 6 Dealing with Debt 103
Identifying and treating a compulsion
No matter how hard they try to break the habit, some people become addicted to 
spending and accumulating debt. It becomes a chronic problem that starts to 
interfere with other aspects of their lives and can lead to problems at work and 
with family and friends.
Debtors Anonymous (DA) is a nonprofit organization that provides support (pri￾marily through group meetings) to people trying to break their debt accumulation 
and spending habits. DA is modeled after the 12-step Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) 
program.
Like AA, Debtors Anonymous works with people from all walks of life and socioe￾conomic backgrounds. You can find people who are financially on the edge, 
$100,000-plus income earners, and everybody in between at DA meetings. Even 
former millionaires join the program.
DA has a simple questionnaire that helps determine whether you’re a problem 
debtor. If you answer “yes” to at least 8 of the following 15 questions, you may be 
developing or already have a compulsive spending and debt accumulation habit:
» Are your debts making your home life unhappy?
» Does the pressure of your debts distract you from your daily work?
» Are your debts affecting your reputation?
» Do your debts cause you to think less of yourself?
» Have you ever given false information in order to obtain credit?
» Have you ever made unrealistic promises to your creditors?
» Does the pressure of your debts make you careless when it comes to the 
welfare of your family?
» Do you ever fear that your employer, family, or friends will learn the extent of 
your total indebtedness?
» When faced with a difficult financial situation, does the prospect of borrowing 
give you an inordinate feeling of relief?
» Does the pressure of your debts cause you to have difficulty sleeping?
» Has the pressure of your debts ever caused you to consider getting drunk?
» Have you ever borrowed money without giving adequate consideration to the 
rate of interest you’re required to pay?104 PART 2 Spending Less, Saving More
» Do you usually expect a negative response when you’re subject to a credit 
investigation?
» Have you ever developed a strict regimen for paying off your debts, only to 
break it under pressure?
» Do you justify your debts by telling yourself that you are superior to the 
“other” people, and when you get your “break,” you’ll be out of debt?
To find a Debtors Anonymous (DA) support group in your area, visit the DA 
website at www.debtorsanonymous.org or contact the DA’s national headquarters

Chapter 7
Reducing Your Spending
Telling people how and where to spend their money is a risky undertaking, 
because most people like to spend money and hate to be told what to do. So, 
in this chapter I detail numerous strategies that I have seen work for other 
people. (I can personally vouch for having used many of the suggested strategies 
as well.) The final decision for what to cut rests solely on you. Only you can decide 
what’s important to you and what’s dispensable (should you cut out your weekly 
poker games or cut back on your designer shoe purchases?).
With these recommendations, I assume that you value your time. Therefore, 
I don’t tell you to scrimp and save by doing things like cutting open a tube of 
toothpaste so that you can use every last bit of it. And I don’t tell you to have your 
spouse do your ironing to reduce your dry-cleaning bills — no point in having 
extra money in the bank if your significant other walks out on you!
The fact that you’re busy all the time may be part of the reason you spend money 
as you do. Therefore, the recommendations in this chapter focus on methods that 
produce significant savings but don’t involve a lot of time. In other words, these 
strategies provide bang for the buck.

Unlocking the Keys to Successful Spending
For most people, spending money is a whole lot easier and more fun than earning 
it. Far be it from me to tell you to stop having fun and turn into a penny-pinching, 
stay-at-home miser. Of course you can spend money. But there’s a world of dif￾ference between spending money carelessly and spending money wisely.
If you spend too much and spend unwisely, you put pressure on your income and 
your future need to continue working. Savings dwindle, debts may accumulate, 
and you can’t achieve your financial (and perhaps personal) goals.
If you dive into details too quickly, you may miss the big picture. So before I jump 
into the specific areas where you may trim your budget, I give you my four overall 
keys to successful spending. These four principles run through my recommenda￾tions in this chapter:
» Living within your means
» Finding the best values
» Cutting excess spending
» Shunning consumer credit
Living within your means
Spending too much is a relative problem. Two people can each spend $50,000 per 
year (including their taxes) yet still have drastically different financial circum￾stances. How? Suppose that one of them earns $60,000 annually, while the other 
makes $45,000. The $60,000 income earner saves $10,000 each year. The $45,000 
wage earner, on the other hand, accumulates $5,000 of new debt (or spends that 
amount from prior savings). So, spend within your means. If you do nothing else 
from this chapter, please be sure to do this!
Don’t let the spending habits of others dictate yours. Certain people — and you 
know who they are — bring out the big spender in you. Do something else with 
them besides shopping and spending. If you can’t find any other activity to share 
with them, try shopping with limited cash and no credit cards. That way, you can’t 
overspend on impulse.
How much you can safely spend while working toward your financial goals 
depends on what your goals are and where you are financially. Save first for your 
goals and then live on what’s left over. Chapter 4 assists you with figuring out 
how much you should be saving and what you can afford to spend while still 
accomplishing your financial goals.CHAPTER 7 Reducing Your Spending 107
Looking for the best values
You can find high quality and low cost in the same product. Conversely, paying a 
high price is no guarantee that you’re getting high quality. Cars are a good exam￾ple. Whether you’re buying a subcompact, a sports car, or a luxury four-door 
sedan, some cars are more fuel-efficient and cheaper to maintain than rivals that 
carry the same sticker price.
When you evaluate the cost of a product or service, think in terms of total, long￾term costs. Suppose that you’re comparing the purchase of two used cars: the 
Solid Sedan, which costs $15,995, and the Clunker Convertible, which weighs in at 
$13,995. On the surface, the convertible appears to be cheaper. However, the price 
that you pay for a car is but a small portion of what that car ultimately costs you. 
If the convertible is costly to operate, maintain, and insure over the years, it can 
end up costing you much more than the sedan would (later in this chapter, in the 
section “Cutting transportation costs,” I detail where to find such information). 
Sometimes, paying a reasonable amount up front for a higher-quality product or 
service ends up saving you money in the long run.
People who sell particular products and services may initially appear to have your 
best interests at heart when they steer you toward something that isn’t costly. 
However, you may be in for a rude awakening when you discover the ongoing 
service, maintenance, and other fees you face in the years ahead. Salespeople are 
generally trained to pitch you a lower-cost product if you indicate that’s what 
you’re after.
Don’t waste money on brand names
You don’t want to compromise on quality, especially in the areas where quality is 
important to you. But you also don’t want to be duped into believing that brand￾name products are better or worth a substantially higher price. Be suspicious of 
companies that spend gobs on image-oriented advertising. Why? Because heavy 
advertising costs many dollars, and as a consumer of those companies’ products 
and services, you pay for all that advertising.
All successful companies advertise their products. Advertising is a wise business 
move if it brings in enough new business. But you need to consider the products 
and services and the claims that companies make. In grocery stores, for example, 
you can often find name brands and store brands for the same product sitting in 
close proximity to one another. Upon reading the label, you can see that the prod￾ucts may in fact be identical, and the only difference between the two products is 
that the name-brand product costs more (because of the branding and associated 
advertising and marketing).108 PART 2 Spending Less, Saving More
Branding is used in many fields to sell overpriced, mediocre products and services 
to consumers. Does a cola beverage really taste better if it’s “the real thing” or 
“the choice of a new generation”? Consider all the silly labels and fluffy marketing 
of beers. Blind taste-testing demonstrates little if any difference between the more 
expensive brand-name products and the cheaper, less heavily advertised ones.
Now, if you can’t live without your Coca-Cola or Samuel Adams beer, and you 
think that these products are head and shoulders above the rest, drink them to 
your heart’s content. But question the importance of the name and image of the 
products you buy. Companies spend a lot of money creating and cultivating an 
image, which has zero impact on how their products taste or perform.
Tread carefully online
Online shopping continues to grow in popularity for some good reasons. It’s rea￾sonably fast and convenient, and you can quickly research different products and 
services before buying.
Over the years, I’ve warmed to shopping online, especially when you know what 
you want already. Without much time or effort, you can quickly determine what a 
competitive price is for a product and get it ordered and delivered efficiently. No 
need to get in your car and waste energy and have to navigate traffic, possible 
accidents, and salespeople.
However, online shopping has plenty of pitfalls, some minor, some possibly 
major. Here are some of the potential downsides to shopping online and what you 
can and can’t do about each of them:
» Watch for hidden costs. You can’t simply go by the sticker price of products 
as listed on websites. Be especially careful when ordering from smaller and/or 
newer websites that may not stand behind what they sell. Shipping costs are 
often hard to discern, and in the worst cases, aren’t disclosed until after you’ve 
invested plenty of your time going through an online checkout process that 
involves entering lots of personal information. You may also find that the 
particular color or style of a product you want is more expensive.
» Understand that online shopping encourages overspending. Shopping 
online is easy — too easy. In addition to not even using real cash to buy, you 
don’t even have the sense that you’re buying something because when the 
transaction is complete, all you have is your online receipt. So, for folks with a 
propensity to overspend, online shopping may be especially problematic.
The connection of shopping to social media exposes you to even more 
advertising and overspending problems. The online shopping experience is 
very much intertwined on many sites with social media.CHAPTER 7 Reducing Your Spending 109
» Beware of identity theft. On less than secure websites as well as on sites 
set up for the sole purpose of tricking you into revealing your personal and 
financial details, identity theft is a concern. See Chapter 23 for tips and advice 
on this important topic.
» Closely consider online reviews. Some bogus and biased online reviews can 
lead you astray. Unfortunately, too many online reviews are posted by folks 
with a vested interest and/or who have never even actually bought and used 
the product. I’m not saying that you can’t discover a lot from reading online 
reviews, but be careful and suspicious, especially with overly flattering 
reviews. Combat this problem by using www.fakespot.com to determine 
how authentic or bogus reviews are posted for particular products and 
services online.
» Watch for counterfeit products and unauthorized retailers. If you like to 
shop for the best prices you can find online for specific products you want to 
buy, you greatly increase the odds of being led to sites that are actually selling 
fake merchandise. Even if what you’re buying is the real thing, the manufac￾turer may not stand behind the product in the way that it normally would 
(if you had bought from an authorized retailer) should you have problems 
with it. (See the next section for more shopping advice.)
Getting your money back
Take a look around your home for items you never use. Odds are you have some 
(maybe even many). Returning such items to where you bought them can be 
cathartic; it also reduces your home’s clutter and puts more money in your pocket.
Also, think about the last several times you bought a product or service and didn’t 
get what was promised. What did you do about it? Most people do nothing and let 
the derelict company off the hook. Why? Here are some common explanations for 
this type of behavior:
» Low standards: Consumers have come to expect shoddy service and 
merchandise because of the common lousy experiences they’ve had.
» Conflict avoidance: Most people shun confrontation. It makes them tense 
and anxious, and it churns their stomachs.
» Hassle aversion: Some companies don’t make it easy for complainers to get 
their money back or obtain satisfaction. To get restitution from some compa￾nies, you need the tenacity and determination of a pit bull.110 PART 2 Spending Less, Saving More
You can increase your odds of getting what you expect for your money by doing 
business with companies that
» Have fair return policies: Don’t purchase any product or service until you 
understand the company’s return policy. Be especially wary of buying from 
companies that charge hefty “restocking” fees for returned merchandise or 
simply don’t allow returns at all. Reputable companies offer full refunds and 
don’t make you take store credit (although taking credit is fine if you’re sure 
that you’ll use it soon and that the company will still be around).
» Can provide good references: Suppose that you’re going to install a fence 
on your property, and, as a result, you’re going to be speaking with fencing 
contractors for the first time. You can sift out many inferior firms by asking 
each contractor that you interview for at least three references from people in 
your local area who have had a fence installed in the past year or two.
» Are committed to the type of product or service they provide: Suppose 
that your chosen fencing contractor does a great job, and now that you’re in 
the market for new gutters on your home, the contractor says that they do 
gutters, too. Although the path of least resistance would be to simply hire the 
same contractor for your gutters, you should inquire about how many gutters 
the contractor has installed and also interview some other firms that special￾ize in such work. Because your fencing contractor may have done only a 
handful of gutter jobs, they may not know as much about that type of work.
Following these guidelines can greatly diminish your chances of having unhappy 
outcomes with products or services you buy. And here’s another important tip: 
Whenever possible and as long as you can pay the balance in full when due, buy 
with a credit card if your credit’s in good standing. Doing so enables you to dispute 
a charge for at least 60 days (and possibly longer for contracting work done over 
time) and gives you leverage for getting your money back.
If you find that you’re unable to make progress when trying to get compensation 
for a lousy product or service, here’s what I recommend you do:
» Document. Taking notes whenever you talk to someone at a company can 
help you validate your case down the road should problems develop. 
Obviously, the bigger the purchase and the more you have at stake, the more 
carefully you should document what you’ve been promised. In many cases, 
though, you probably won’t start carefully noting each conversation until a 
conflict develops. Keep copies of companies’ marketing literature and claims, 
because such documents often make promises or claims that companies fail 
to live up to in practice.CHAPTER 7 Reducing Your Spending 111
» Escalate. Some frontline employees either aren’t capable of resolving 
disputes or lack the authority to do so. No matter what the cause, speak with 
a department supervisor and continue escalating from there. If you’re still not 
making progress, lodge a complaint to whatever state regulatory agency (if 
any) oversees such companies. State Attorney General offices generally have 
a consumer protection department. They file class action suits, which means 
there must be multiple complaints, of which you can be a part. Their investiga￾tors also check to make sure the business or individual has the appropriate 
licenses.
» Share. Consider posting your beefs on some of the numerous consumer 
complaint-compiling websites and possibly social media outlets, but be careful 
to stick to the facts and avoid saying something false or incendiary that can 
lead to your being sued. Tell your friends and colleagues not to do business 
with the company (and let the company know that you’re doing so until your 
complaint is resolved to your satisfaction). Also consider contacting a con￾sumer help group — these groups are typically sponsored by broadcast 
media in metropolitan areas. They can be helpful in resolving disputes or 
shining adverse publicity on disreputable companies or products.
» Litigate. If all else fails, consider taking the matter to small claims court if the 
company continues to be unresponsive. (Depending on the amount of money 
at stake, this tactic may be worth your time.) The maximum dollar limit that 
you may recover varies by state, but you’re usually limited to a few thousand 
dollars. For larger amounts than those allowed in small claims court in your 
state, you can, of course, hire an attorney and pursue the traditional legal 
channels — although you may end up throwing away more of your time and 
money. Mediation and arbitration are generally a better option than following 
through on a lawsuit.
Eliminating the fat from your spending
If you want to reduce your overall spending by, say, 10 percent, you can just cut all 
your current expenditures by 10 percent. Or, you can reach your 10 percent goal by 
cutting some categories a lot and others not at all by setting priorities and making 
choices about where you want and don’t want to spend your money.
What you spend your money on is sometimes a matter of habit rather than a mat￾ter of what you really want or value. For example, some people shop at whatever 
stores are close to them. These days, some people order many things online, which 
can lead to overspending as well. But eliminating fat doesn’t necessarily mean 
cutting back on your purchases: You can save money by buying in bulk. Some 
stores specialize in selling larger packages or quantities of a product at a lower 
price because they save money on the packaging and handling. If you’re single, 112 PART 2 Spending Less, Saving More
shop with a friend and split the bulk purchases. You can also do some comparison 
shopping online, but be sure you’re surveying reputable websites that stand 
behind what they sell and that provide high-quality customer service.
Turning your back on consumer credit
As I discuss in Chapters 5 and 6, buying items that depreciate — such as cars, 
clothing, and vacations  — on credit is hazardous to your long-term financial 
health. Buy only what you can afford today. If you’ll be forced to carry a debt for 
months or years on end, you can’t really afford what you’re buying on credit 
today.
Without a doubt, renting-to-own is the most expensive way to buy. Here’s how it 
works: You see a huge ad blaring “$19.99 for a 65-inch Smart TV!” Well, the ad 
has a big hitch: That’s $19.99 per week, for many weeks. When all is said and done 
(and paid), buying a $489 65-inch Smart TV through a rent-to-own store costs a 
typical buyer more than $1,800! Welcome to the world of rent-to-own stores, 
which offer cash-poor consumers the ability to lease consumer items and, at the 
end of the lease, an option to buy.
If you think that paying an 18 percent interest rate on a credit card is expensive, 
consider this: The effective interest rate charged on many rent-to-own purchases 
exceeds 100 percent; in some cases, it may be 200 percent or more! Renting-to￾own makes buying on a credit card look like a deal. I’m not sharing this informa￾tion to encourage you to buy using credit over time on credit cards but to point out 
what a rip-off renting-to-own is. Such stores prey on cashless consumers who 
either can’t get credit cards or don’t understand how expensive renting-to-own 
really is. Forget the instant gratification and save a set amount each week until 
you can afford what you want.
Consumer credit is expensive, and it reinforces a bad financial habit: spending 
more than you can afford.
Reducing Your Spending
As you read through the following strategies for reducing your spending, please 
keep in mind that some of these strategies will make sense for you and some of 
them won’t. Start your spending reduction plan with the strategies that come eas￾ily and seem most appealing. Work your way through them. Keep a list of the 
options that are more challenging for you — ones that may require more of a 
sacrifice but may be workable if necessary to achieve your spending and savings 
goals.CHAPTER 7 Reducing Your Spending 113
No matter which of the ideas in this chapter you choose, rest assured that keeping 
your budget lean and mean pays enormous dividends. After you implement a 
spending reduction strategy, you’ll reap the benefits for years to come. Take a 
look at Figure 7-1: For every $1,000 that you shave from your annual spending 
(that’s just $83 per month), check out how much more money you’ll have 
down the road. (This chart assumes that you invest your newfound savings in a 
tax-deferred retirement account, you average 8-percent-per-year returns on 
your investments, and you’re in a combined federal and state tax bracket of 
35 percent — see Chapter 8 for information on tax brackets.)
Managing food costs
Not eating is one way to reduce food expenditures; however, this method tends to 
make you weak and dizzy, so it’s probably not a viable long-term strategy. The 
following culinary cutbacks can keep you on your feet — perhaps even improve 
your health — and help you save money.
Eating out frugally
Eating meals out and getting takeout can be timesavers, but they rack up big bills 
if done too often and too lavishly. Eating out is a luxury — think of it as hiring 
someone to shop, cook, and clean up for you. Of course, some people either hate

to cook or don’t have the time, space, or energy to do much in the kitchen. If this 
sounds like you, choose restaurants carefully and order from the menu selectively. 
Here are some tips for eating out:
» Avoid beverages, especially alcohol. Most restaurants make big profits on 
beverages. Drink water instead. (Water is healthy, and it reduces the likelihood 
that you’ll want a nap after a big meal.)
» Favor fast casual restaurants. Examples include Panera, Chipotle, Qdoba, 
Sweetgreen, Moe’s Southwestern Grill, and Zaxby’s. Ordering at the counter/
service line saves you from having to tip the usual 15 percent on your bill. You 
can also save at these types of restaurants by not having a server encouraging 
you to order more (for example, appetizers, beverages, desserts, and so on).
» Consider buying prepared food and taking it home or eating it outside 
someplace nice. The abundance of premium grocery stores provides access 
to an unbelievable array of prepared foods. That’s not to say that you can 
ignore prices, because if you do, you can end up spending plenty on these 
purchases. Numerous meal kit delivery services can ship you meals that are 
quick to prepare. The best of these may be less expensive than going to a 
local restaurant, but they tend to be pricey, given the cost of shipping which is 
embedded in the pricing. Most offer discounted trials.
» Order vegetarian. Vegetarian dishes generally cost less than meat-based 
entrees (and they’re generally better for you). I’m not suggesting that you only 
order vegetarian, especially if you’re sharing with a number of other people, 
but that you consider some vegetarian dishes.
I don’t want to be a killjoy. I’m not saying that you should live on bread and water. 
You can have dessert — heck, have some wine, too, for special occasions! Just try 
not to eat dessert with every meal. Try eating appetizers and dessert at home, 
where they’re a lot less expensive.
Eating healthy at home without 
spending a fortune
If you aren’t skilled in the kitchen, consider learning how to cook. Folks who eat 
out a lot do so in part because they don’t really know how to cook. Ask a family 
member who knows how to cook to show you the basics, take a cooking class, and 
read some good books on the topic.
Even if you have rudimentary cooking skills, keep in mind one simple key if you 
want to minimize your food costs and eat well. Be sure to maintain a good inven￾tory of food that you like and that is reasonably priced and nutritious. When you 
go grocery shopping, buy enough to make it worthwhile. Of course, you don’t CHAPTER 7 Reducing Your Spending 115
want food to spoil, but, for example, if you like eating yogurt for breakfast daily, 
get enough to last you at least a couple of weeks. Always check the freshness dates 
on perishable items you’re buying. If you find getting to the store and hauling 
groceries home to be a big obstacle, check out grocery delivery services in your 
area. Minimize the impact of delivery fees by placing larger orders.
As evidenced by the preponderance of diet and weight-loss books on health book 
bestseller lists — and the growth of the natural and organic grocery stores like 
Wegmans, Whole Foods, and Trader Joe’s — Americans are trying to eat healthier. 
Concerned about all the pesticides, antibiotics, and hormones that end up in the 
food supply, organic food purchases are growing at a fast rate.
Problem is, financially speaking, better quality food, especially organic foods, can 
cost more, sometimes much more — but not always. A number of studies I’ve 
seen demonstrate that highly processed foods, which are less nutritious and worse 
for your health, can be as costly as or even more expensive than fresh, so-called 
whole foods. The key to not overspending on fresher, healthier, and organic foods 
is to be flexible when you’re at the grocery store. Buy more of what is seasonal and 
therefore currently less expensive, stock up on sale items that aren’t perishable, 
and buy more at stores like Trader Joe’s, Aldi, and Publix that have competitive 
pricing. Many larger grocery chains carry some organic foods; just be sure to com￾pare prices. Local food co-ops, which source food locally, are another great source 
for competitively priced food and sometimes pay dividends annually to members.
According to various studies, spending the money to buy organic food makes the 
most sense when buying the following foods:
» Produce: Apples, bell peppers, celery, cherries, hot peppers, imported grapes, 
nectarines, peaches, pears, potatoes, red raspberries, spinach, and strawber￾ries have historically been found to carry the greatest amount of pesticides, 
even after washing.
» Meat, poultry, eggs, and dairy: By going organic, you avoid supplemental 
hormones and antibiotics. You also greatly reduce the risk of exposure to the 
agent believed to cause mad cow disease, and you minimize your exposure to 
other potential toxins in nonorganic feed.
» Baby food: Baby food is typically loaded with condensed fruits and vegeta￾bles, which thus contain concentrated pesticide residues. Also, children’s small 
and developing bodies are especially vulnerable to toxins.
One area where many folks are wasting money is in buying bottled water. Although 
tap water often does leave something to be desired, bottled water is typically not 
as pure as some folks think. You can save hundreds of dollars annually and drink 
cleaner water by installing a water filtration system at home and improving your 
tap (or well) water.116 PART 2 Spending Less, Saving More
The simplest and lowest cost approach is a carafe style system that you fill at 
your sink and can keep in your refrigerator. Such systems generally have filters 
that require periodic replacement. For more serious water problems, check out 
reverse-osmosis filtration systems.
Even if you hire someone to do the installation, such a system should easily pay 
for itself within the first year, and then you can enjoy more than 100 percent 
annual return on your investment by being able to eliminate those costly bottled 
water purchases. How’s that for a low risk, super high return investment!
To dispense your own bottled water for use outside your home, get a small supply 
of dishwasher-safe, stainless-steel containers.
Joining a wholesale superstore
Superstores such as Costco and Sam’s Club enable you to buy groceries in bulk at 
wholesale prices. And contrary to popular perception, you don’t have to buy 1,000 
rolls of toilet paper at once — just 24.
I’ve performed price comparisons between wholesale superstores and retail 
grocery stores and found that wholesalers charge about 30 percent less for the 
exact same stuff — all without the hassle of clipping coupons or hunting for the 
store that has the best price on paper towels this month! (At these discount prices, 
you only need to buy about $200 per year to recoup Costco and Sam’s Club’s 
membership fees, which start at $60 and $50 per year, respectively.) In addition 
to saving you lots of money, buying in bulk requires fewer shopping trips. You’ll 
have more supplies around your humble abode, so you’ll have less need to eat out 
(which is costly) or make trips to the local grocer (which wastes time and energy 
for your car), who may be really nice but charges the most. Check out these clubs’ 
premium memberships, which may more than pay for themselves with cash back 
and other rewards.
Perishables run the risk of living up to their name, so only buy what you can rea￾sonably use. Repackage bulk packs into smaller quantities and store them in the 
freezer if possible. If you’re single, shop with a friend and split the order. Also, be 
careful when you shop at the warehouse clubs  — you may be tempted to buy 
things you don’t really need. These stores carry all sorts of items, including the 
newest TVs, computers, furniture, clothing, complete sets of baseball cards, and 
giant canisters of biscotti  — so wallet and waistline beware! Try not to make 
impulse purchases, and be especially careful when you have kids in tow.
To find a Costco store near you, visit the Costco website at www.costco.com or call 
800-774-2678. Sam’s Club is online at www.samsclub.com. Call 888-746-7726 
for Sam’s Club’s locator.CHAPTER 7 Reducing Your Spending 117
Saving on shelter
Housing and all the costs associated with it (utilities, furniture, appliances, and if 
you’re a homeowner, maintenance, repairs, and home insurance) can gobble a 
large chunk of your monthly income. I’m not suggesting that you live in an igloo 
or teepee (though they’re probably less costly), but people often overlook oppor￾tunities to save money in this category.
Reducing rental costs
Rent can take up a sizable chunk of your monthly take-home pay. Many people 
consider rent to be a fixed and inflexible part of their expenses, but it’s not. Here’s 
what you can do to cut down your rental costs:
» Move to a lower-cost rental. Of course, a lower-cost rental may not be as 
nice — it may be smaller, lack a private parking spot, or be located in a less 
popular area (don’t sacrifice safety). Remember that the less you spend 
renting, the more you can save toward buying your own place. Just be sure 
to factor in all the costs of a new location, including the possible higher 
commuting costs.
» Share a rental. Living alone has some benefits, but financially speaking, it’s 
a luxury. If you rent a larger place with roommates, your rental costs should 
be a good deal less, and you’ll get more home for your rental dollars. You 
have to be in a sharing mood, though. Roommates can be a hassle at times, 
but they can also be a plus — you get to meet all sorts of new people, and 
you have someone else to blame when the kitchen’s a mess.
» Negotiate your rental increases. If your local rental market is soft or your 
living quarters are deteriorating, stand up for yourself! You have more 
leverage and power than you probably realize. A smart landlord doesn’t want 
to lose good tenants who pay rent on time. Filling vacancies takes time and 
money. State your case: You’ve been a responsible tenant, and your research 
shows comparable rentals going for less. Crying “poor” may help, too. At the 
very least, if you can’t stave off the rent increase, maybe you can wrangle 
some improvements to the place.
» Buy rather than rent. Purchasing your own place may seem costly, but in the 
long run, owning should be cheaper than renting, and you have something to 
show for it in the end. If you purchase real estate with a 30-year fixed-rate 
mortgage, your mortgage payment (which is your biggest ownership expense) 
remains constant. Only your property taxes, maintenance, and insurance 
costs are exposed to the vagaries of inflation. As a renter, your entire monthly 
housing cost can rise with increases in the cost of living (unless you’re the 
beneficiary of a rent-controlled apartment). See Chapter 15 to find out the 
smart way to buy real estate and determine whether buying in your local area 
makes financial sense.118 PART 2 Spending Less, Saving More
Reducing homeowner expenses
As every homeowner knows, houses suck up money. You should be especially 
careful to watch your money in this area of your budget.
» Know what you can afford. Whether you’re on the verge of buying your first 
home or trading up to a more costly property, crunch some realistic numbers 
before you commit. Calculate how much you can afford to spend monthly on 
a home. Do the exercises in Chapter 5, on where you’re spending your money, 
and Chapter 4, on saving for retirement, to help you calculate the amount you 
can afford.
Although real estate can be a good long-term investment, you can end 
up pouring a large portion of your discretionary dollars into your home. 
In addition to decorating and remodeling, some people feel the need to 
trade up to a bigger home every few years. Of course, after they’re in their 
new home, the remodeling and renovation cycle simply begins again, which 
costs even more money. The cost of most home renovations or remodels 
will never come close to being recouped. In addition, a major remodel may 
result in higher property taxes, as well as higher homeowner’s insurance 
costs. Appreciate what you have, and remember that homes are for living in, 
not museums for display. If you have children, why waste a lot of money on 
expensive furnishings that take up valuable space and require you to con￾stantly nag your kids to tread carefully? And don’t covet — the world will 
always have people with bigger houses and more toys than you. Remember, 
where the grass is greener, the water bills are usually higher!
» Rent out a room. Because selling your home to buy a less expensive place 
can be a big hassle, consider taking in a tenant (or charge those adult 
“children” still living at home!) to reduce your housing expenses. Check out 
the renter thoroughly: Get references, run a credit report, research civil and 
criminal databases online, and talk about ground rules and expectations 
(and have those documented in a written and signed lease agreement) 
before sharing your space. Don’t forget to check with your insurance 
company to see whether your homeowner’s policy needs adjustments to 
cover potential liability from renting. Also check with your town and home￾owner’s association, if applicable, to see if renters are allowed.
» Refinance your mortgage. This step may seem like common sense, but 
surprisingly, many people don’t keep up to date on mortgage rates. If interest 
rates are lower than they were when you obtained your current mortgage, 
you may be able to save money by refinancing (see Chapter 15 for more 
information).
» Appeal your property-tax assessment. If you bought your property when 
housing prices were higher in your area than they are now, you may be able 
to save money by appealing your assessment. Also, if you live in an area CHAPTER 7 Reducing Your Spending 119
where your assessment is based on how the local assessor valued the 
property (rather than what you paid for your home), your home may be 
over-assessed. Check with your local assessor’s office for the appeals proce￾dure you need to follow. An appraiser’s recent evaluation of your property 
may help — you may already have one if you refinanced your mortgage 
recently. Also, review how the assessor valued your property compared with 
similar ones nearby — mistakes happen.
» Reduce utility costs. Sometimes you have to spend money to save money. 
Old refrigerators, for example, can waste electricity. Insulate to save on 
heating and air-conditioning bills. Install water flow regulators in shower￾heads. When planting your yard, don’t select water-guzzling plants, and keep 
your lawn area reasonable. Even if you don’t live in an area susceptible to 
droughts, why waste water (which isn’t free) and lawn fertilizer unnecessarily? 
Recycle — recycling means less garbage, which translates into lower trash bills 
(because you won’t be charged for using larger garbage containers) and 
benefits the environment by reducing landfill. Consider installing solar and 
other newer energy alternatives, but run the numbers and be sure you’ll get 
your expenditures back within a reasonable number of years.
Cutting transportation costs
America is a car-driven society. In many countries, cars are a luxury. If more 
people in the United States thought of cars as a luxury, Americans may have far 
fewer financial problems. Not only do cars pollute the air and clog the highways, 
but they also cost you a bundle.
Purchasing a quality car and using it wisely can reduce the cost of car ownership. 
Using alternative modes of transportation can also help you save.
Contrary to advertising slogans, cars aren’t built to last; manufacturers don’t 
want you to stick with the same car forever. New models are constantly introduced 
with new features and styling changes. But getting a new set of wheels every few 
years is an expensive luxury. Don’t try to keep up with the Joneses as they show 
off their new cars every year — for all you know, they’re running themselves into 
financial ruin trying to impress others. Let your neighbors admire you for your 
thriftiness and wisdom instead.
Research before you buy a car
When you buy a car, you don’t just pay the negotiated purchase price: You also 
have to pay for fuel/energy, insurance, registration fees, maintenance, and repairs. 
You may also owe sales and/or personal property taxes. Don’t compare simply 120 PART 2 Spending Less, Saving More
sticker prices; think about the total, long-term costs of car ownership and 
see  whether they fit into your budget while still allowing you to save toward 
your goals.
Speaking of total costs, remember that you’re also trusting your life to the car. 
With about 40,000 Americans killed in auto accidents annually (about one-third 
of which are caused by drunk drivers), safety should be an important considera￾tion as well. (If you take care of your health, probably the most dangerous thing 
you’ll ever do is get behind the wheel.) Air bags, for example, may save your life. 
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s website (www.nhtsa.gov/
ratings) has lots of crash test data, as well as information on other car safety 
issues.
IntelliChoice (www.motortrend.com/intellichoice/) provides information 
about all categories of ownership costs, warranties, and dealer costs for new cars, 
which are rated based on total ownership costs. Edmunds (www.edmunds.com) 
provides more general information about different makes and models of both new 
and used cars. Please be aware that these sites have advertising and may receive 
referral fees if you buy a car through a dealer their website refers you to. Con￾sumer Reports (www.consumerreports.org/cars/) also has good information 
and data.
Don’t lease, don’t borrow: Buy your car with cash
The main reason people end up spending more than they can afford on a car is 
that they finance the purchase. As I discuss in Part 1, you should avoid borrowing 
money for consumption purchases, especially for items that depreciate in value 
(like cars). A car is most definitely not an investment.
Leasing is generally more expensive than borrowing money to buy a car. Leasing 
is like a long-term car rental. Everyone knows how well rental cars get treated — 
leased cars are treated just as well, which is one of the reasons leasing is so costly.
“But I can’t buy a new car with cash,” you may be thinking. Some people feel that 
it’s unreasonable of me to expect them to use cash to buy a new car, but I’m trying 
to look out for your best long-term financial interests. Please consider the 
following:
» If you lack sufficient cash to buy a new car, don’t buy a new car! Most of 
the world’s population can’t even afford a car, let alone a new one! Buy a car 
that you can afford — which for most people is a used one.
» Don’t fall for the rationale that says buying a used car means lots of 
maintenance, repair expenses, and problems. Do your homework and buy 
a good quality used car (see the preceding section). That way, you can have CHAPTER 7 Reducing Your Spending 121
the best of both worlds. A good used car costs less to buy and, thanks to lower 
insurance costs (and possibly property taxes), less to operate.
» You don’t need a fancy car to impress people for business purposes. Some 
people I know say that they absolutely must drive a nice, brand-spanking-new, 
high-end car to set the right impression for business purposes. I’m not going to 
tell you how to manage your career, but I will ask you to consider that if clients 
and others see you driving an expensive new car, they may think that you 
spend money wastefully or that you’re getting rich off of them!
Replace high-cost cars
Maybe you realize by now that your car is too expensive to operate because of 
insurance, gas, and maintenance costs. Or maybe you bought too much car — 
people who lease or borrow money for a car frequently buy a far more expensive 
car than they can realistically afford.
Sell your expensive car and get something more financially manageable. The 
sooner you switch, the more money you’ll save. Getting rid of a car on a lease is a 
challenge, but it can be done. I had a client who, when he lost his job and needed 
to slash expenses, convinced the dealer (by writing a letter to the owner) to take 
the leased car back.
Keep cars to a minimum
For most households, maintaining two or more cars is an expensive extravagance. 
Try to find ways to make do with fewer cars. You can move beyond the confines of 
owning a car by either carpooling or riding buses or commuter trains to work. 
Some employers give incentives for taking public transit to work, and some cities 
and counties offer assistance for setting up vanpools or carpools along popular 
routes. By leaving the driving to someone else, you can catch up on reading or just 
relax on the way to and from work. You also help reduce pollution.
When you’re considering the cost of living in different areas, don’t forget to factor 
in commuting costs. One advantage of living close to work, or at least close to 
public transit systems, is that you may be able to make do with fewer cars (or no 
car at all) in your household.
If you only need the use of a car occasionally, you may save money and do without 
your own car by renting a car when needed and/or using taxis and rideshare ser￾vices like Lyft and Uber. Do some simple analysis to see if owning your own car 
will be more or less costly than paying for cars when needed. Use the resources 
suggested in the earlier section, “Research before you buy a car” to estimate the 
approximate annual cost of your owning a car. Suppose the model you’re thinking 122 PART 2 Spending Less, Saving More
about buying would effectively cost you about $4,000 per year (fuel, maintenance, 
depreciation, insurance, and so on). You would have to average spending more 
than $333 per month on car rentals and/or rideshares to come out ahead finan￾cially buying and owning your own car.
Buy commuter passes
In many areas, you can purchase train, bus, or subway passes to help reduce the 
cost of commuting. Many toll bridges also have monthly commuter passes or rates 
that you can buy at a discount. Electronic passes like E-Z Pass help you keep mov￾ing through toll plazas and eliminate sitting in toll collection lines that waste your 
time and gas. Some areas even allow before-tax dollars to be withheld from your 
paycheck to buy commuter passes.
Use regular unleaded gas
A number of studies have shown that “premium” gasoline isn’t worth the extra 
expense. But make sure that you buy gasoline that has the minimum octane rating 
recommended for your vehicle by consulting your owner’s manual. Paying more 
for higher-octane gasoline just wastes money. Your car doesn’t run better; you 
just pay more for gas. Fill up your tank when you’re on a shopping trip to the 
warehouse wholesalers (discussed earlier in this chapter). These superstores are 
usually located in lower-cost areas, so the gas is often cheaper there, too. Also, 
don’t use credit cards to buy your gas if you have to pay a higher price to do so.
Service your car regularly
Sure, servicing your car (for example, changing the oil every 5,000 miles) costs 
money, but it saves you dough in the long run by extending the operating life of 
your car. Servicing your car also reduces the chance that your car will conk out in 
the middle of nowhere, which requires a hefty towing charge to a service station. 
Stalling on the freeway during peak rush hour and having thousands of angry 
commuters delayed because of you is even worse.
Lowering your energy costs
Escalating energy prices remind all of us how much we depend upon and use oil, 
electricity, and natural gas in our daily lives. A number of terrific websites are 
packed with suggestions and tips for how to lower your energy costs. Before I 
present those to you, however, here are the basics:
» Drive fuel-efficient cars and drive efficiently. If you’re safety minded, you 
know how dangerous driving can be and aren’t willing to risk your life driving a CHAPTER 7 Reducing Your Spending 123
pint-size vehicle just to get 50 miles per gallon. That said, you can drive safe 
cars (see the earlier section “Research before you buy a car”) that are fuel￾efficient. Also, take it easy on the gas pedal and brakes; do both gradually and 
don’t speed on the highway because doing so gobbles more fuel. Although it 
varies based on the type of car you drive and your driving habits, each 5 mph 
you drive over 60 mph can reduce your fuel economy by about 7 percent.
» Be thrifty at home. Get all family members on the same page, without 
driving them crazy, to turn off lights they don’t need. Turn down the heat at 
night, which saves money and helps you sleep better, and turn it down when 
no one is home. Hint: If people are walking around your home during the 
winter with shorts on (as happens in too many college dormitories) instead of 
wearing sweatpants, turn the heat down!
» Service and maintain what you have. Anything that uses energy — from 
your cars to your furnace — should be regularly serviced. For instance, make 
sure you clean your filters.
» Investigate energy efficiency before you buy. This advice applies not only 
to appliances but also to an entire home. Some builders are building energy 
efficiency into their new homes.
My favorite energy information and tip websites are the Database of State Incen￾tives for Renewables & Efficiency (www.dsireusa.org) and the U.S. Department of 
Energy’s Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (www.energy.gov/energysaver/
energy-saver).
Controlling clothing costs
Given the amount of money that some people spend on clothing and related acces￾sories, I’ve come to believe that people in nudist colonies must be great savers! 
But you probably live among the clothed mainstream of society, so here’s a short 
list of economical ideas:
» Avoid clothing that requires dry-cleaning. When you buy clothing, try to 
stick with cottons and machine-washable synthetics rather than wools or silks 
that require dry-cleaning. Check labels before you buy clothing.
» Don’t chase the latest fashions. Fashion designers and retailers are 
constantly working to tempt you to buy. Don’t do it. In most cases, you simply 
don’t need to buy racks of new clothes or an entire new wardrobe every year. 
True fashion, as defined by what people wear, changes quite slowly. In fact, 
the classics never go out of style. If you want the effect of a new wardrobe 
every year, store last year’s purchases away next year and then bring them 
out the year after. Or rotate your clothing inventory every third year. Set your 124 PART 2 Spending Less, Saving More
own fashion standards. Buy basic and buy classic — if you let fashion gurus be 
your guide, you’ll end up with the biggest wardrobe in the poorhouse!
» Minimize accessories. Shoes, jewelry, handbags, and the like can gobble 
large amounts of money. Again, how many of these accessory items do you 
really need? The answer is probably very few, because each one should last 
many years.
Go to your closet or jewelry box and tally up the loot. What else could you have 
done with all that spent cash? Do you see things you regret buying or forgot you 
even had? Don’t make the same mistake again. If you have a lot of stuff that you 
don’t want, try selling items through local consignment stores or online through 
Poshmark, RealReal, Kidizen, and eBay. Return recent unused purchases to stores. 
For older items you have no intention of using anymore, try a consignment store 
to realize some cash back or try donating to a charity if you are able to itemize 
your deductions by filing Schedule A with your IRS Form 1040.
Repaying your debt
In Chapter 6, I discuss strategies for reducing the cost of carrying consumer debt. 
The best way to reduce the costs of such debt is to avoid it in the first place when 
you’re making consumption purchases.
You can avoid consumer debt by eliminating your access to credit or by limiting 
your purchase of consumer items to what you can pay off each month. Borrow 
only for long-term investments, like a home, real estate, and education. (see 
Chapter 3 for more information).
Don’t keep a credit card that charges you an annual fee, especially if you pay your 
balance in full each month. Many no-fee credit cards exist — and some even offer 
you a reward/benefit for using them:
» Discover Card (phone 800-347-2683; website www.discover.com) offers 
rebates of 1 percent of purchases (higher percentage offered for some 
particular retailers) in cash. At the end of your first year, Discover automati￾cally matches an unlimited amount of your cash back.
» Fidelity Rewards Visa (phone 888-325-6196; www.fidelity.com/cash￾management/visa-signature-card) pays unlimited 2 percent cash back 
on all purchases, and that cash is deposited monthly into an eligible Fidelity 
account such as a cash management account, IRA, and so forth.
» USAA Preferred Cash Rewards (phone 800-922-9092; website www.usaa.
com) offers 1.5 percent cash bank on purchases for members of the military 
and their immediate relatives.CHAPTER 7 Reducing Your Spending 125
Consider the cards in the preceding list only if you pay your balance in full each 
month, because no-fee cards typically don’t offer the lowest interest rates for bal￾ances carried from month to month. The small rewards that you earn really won’t 
do you much good if they’re negated by high interest charges.
If you have a credit card that charges an annual fee, try calling the company and 
saying that you want to cancel the card because you can get a competitor’s card 
without an annual fee. Many banks will agree to waive the fee on the spot. Some 
require you to call back yearly to cancel the fee — a hassle that can be avoided by 
getting a true no-fee card.
Some cards that charge an annual fee and offer credits toward the purchase of a 
specific item, such as a car or airline ticket or hotel stay, may be worth your while 
if you pay your bill in full each month and charge $10,000 or more annually. Note:
Be careful — you may be tempted to charge more on a card that rewards you for 
more purchases. Spending more in order to rack up bonuses defeats the purpose 
of the credits.
Indulging responsibly in fun and recreation
Having fun and taking time out for R and R can be money well spent. But when it 
comes to fun and recreation, financial extravagance can wreck an otherwise good 
budget.
Looking at low-cost entertainment
If you adjust your plans and expectations, entertainment doesn’t have to cost a 
great deal of money. Many movies, theaters, museums, and restaurants offer dis￾count prices on certain days and/or at certain times.
Cultivate some interests and hobbies that are free or low-cost. Visiting with 
friends, hiking, reading, and playing sports can be good for your finances as well 
as your health.
Vacationing for less
For many people, vacations are a luxury. For others, regular vacations are essen￾tial parts of their routine. Regardless of how you recharge your batteries, remem￾ber that vacations aren’t investments, so you shouldn’t borrow through credit 
cards to finance your travels. After all, how relaxed will you feel when you have to 
pay all those bills?126 PART 2 Spending Less, Saving More
Try taking shorter vacations that are closer to home. Have you been to a state or 
national park recently? Great places that you’ve always wanted to see but haven’t 
visited for one reason or another are probably located within 200 miles of you. Or 
you may want to just block out some time and do what family pets do: Relax 
around your home and enjoy some naps.
If you do travel a long way to a popular destination, travel during the off-season 
for the best deals on airfares and hotels. Keep an eye out for discounts. The Con￾sumer Reports Travel newsletter and numerous websites, such as www.priceline.
com, www.expedia.com, and www.travelocity.com can help you find low-cost 
travel options as well. Seniors generally qualify for special fares at most airlines — 
ask the airline what programs it offers.
Also, be sure to shop around, even when working with travel agents/advisors. 
Travel agents work on commission, so they may not work hard to find you the best 
deals. Tour packages, when they meet your interests and needs, may save you 
money.
Using thrift with gifts
Think about how you approach buying gifts throughout the year  — especially 
during the holidays. I know people who spend so much on their credit cards dur￾ing the year-end holidays that it takes them until late spring or summer to pay 
their debts off! Some people forget their thrifty shopping habits when gift￾buying, perhaps because they don’t like to feel cheap when buying a gift. As with 
other purchases you make, paying careful attention to where and what you buy 
can save you significant dollars. Don’t make the mistake of equating the value of 
a gift with its dollar cost.
Although I don’t want to deny your loved ones gifts from the heart — or deny you 
the pleasure of giving them — spend wisely. Homemade gifts are less costly to the 
giver and may be dearer to recipients. Many children actually love durable, classic, 
basic toys. If the TV and web ads dictate your kids’ desires, it may be time to limit 
the TV and internet usage or set better rules for what the kids are allowed to 
watch. Use DVR services to record desired shows so you can zap through the 
ubiquitous commercials on cable TV services and consider paying a bit more for 
ad-free streaming services.
And here’s a good suggestion for getting rid of those old, unwanted gifts: a white 
elephant gift exchange. Everyone brings a wrapped, unwanted gift from the past 
and exchanges it with someone else. After the gifts are opened, trading is allowed. 
(Just be sure not to bring a gift that was given to you by any of the exchange par￾ticipants!) Can’t be bothered with this? Consider donating unwanted items for a 
tax write-off if you itemize on Schedule A — see Chapter 8.CHAPTER 7 Reducing Your Spending 127
Lowering your phone bills
Thanks to increased competition and technology, telephoning costs continue to 
fall. If you haven’t looked for lower rates in recent years, you’re probably paying 
more than you need to for quality phone service. Unfortunately, shopping among 
the many service providers is difficult. Plans come with different restrictions, 
minimums, and bells and whistles.
You may have to switch companies to reduce your bill, but some people can save 
with their current phone company simply by getting onto a better calling plan. 
Contact your current provider(s) and ask them which of their calling plans offers 
the lowest cost for you based on the patterns of your calls.
Cellphones are ubiquitous. And although being able to make calls from wherever 
you are can be enormously convenient, you can spend a lot of money for service 
given the myriad extra charges and put yourself in harm’s way if you use your 
phone while driving and even walking if you’re not paying attention to your sur￾roundings. On the other hand, if you take advantage of the included minutes many 
plans offer, a good cellphone service can save you money. Increasing numbers of 
people, especially younger adults, are just using their cellphones and foregoing 
landlines at home. This strategy can make sense if you live in an area with excel￾lent cell reception.
The primary reason that some parents elect to provide cellphones to their teenage 
children is for safety, the ability to call home for a ride, and so on. Thus, you don’t 
necessarily need all the costly bells and whistles.
To get the best value from using cellphones, you have a few options:
» Examine family plan options that don’t limit usage in the categories 
most important to you. Shop around and make sure you sign up with the 
best plan and carrier given your typical usage. Reputable carriers let you test 
out their services. They also offer full refunds if you’re not satisfied after a 
week or two of service.
» Set and enforce limits. If you provide a cellphone to a child, keep in mind 
that kids don’t need to use their phones for hours daily. This point is especially 
important with data usage, which you can block so that your kids can only use 
Wi-Fi when available. With teens, why not tie having good grades to being able 
to have some of the extra features?
» Check out prepaid or no-contract plans. Look at companies like Consumer 
Cellular, Cricket, Mint Mobile, or Ting.128 PART 2 Spending Less, Saving More
Technology: Spending wisely
We have email, smartphones, voice mail, tablets, satellite TV, the internet, stream￾ing services, virtual reality devices, and too many other ways to stay in touch and 
entertained 24/7. Visit a store that sells electronics, and you’ll find no end to new 
gadgets.
Although I enjoy choices and convenience as much as the next person, I also see 
the detrimental impact these technologies have on people’s lives. As it is, most 
families struggle to find quality time together given their work obligations, long 
school days, and various other activities. At home, all these technology choices 
and options compete for attention and often pull families apart. The cost for all 
these services and gadgets adds up, leading to continued enslavement to your job. 
Err on the side of keeping your life simple. Doing so costs less, reduces stress, and 
allows more time for the things that really do matter in life.
If you’re prone to compulsive shopping and decisions, the worst way to shop for 
electronics and technology-based products is to wander around stores selling lots 
of these goods while a salesperson pitches you things. You may be prone to quick 
buying decisions online as well if you’re comfortable clicking and buying on 
websites. Educate yourself (check out Consumer Reports [just one click away if 
you have a library card] and CNET’s website at www.cnet.com) to determine what 
you really need and what provides the best value.
CELLPHONES AND KIDS CAN 
BE A DANGEROUS MIX
Everywhere you look these days, it seems as if every teen (and just as often, every adult) 
has a cellphone. Cellphones are a great way for parents to keep in contact with their 
children, especially in emergencies. Important safety issues come up when teens get 
caught up in using cellphones. Keep the following in mind:
• A number of studies have raised concerns about the impact of repeated cellphone 
usage on the brain and the possible linkage between brain tumors and usage of 
cellphones held near the side of one’s head. Getting teens who talk on the phone to 
use earpieces connected to the cellphone is easier said than done.
• A second health concern with cellphone usage is the common occurrence of older 
teens being on their phones while driving. Horrible accidents have happened with 
teens fiddling with their phones not only while placing and receiving calls but also 
while typing out text messages or surfing online. Increasing numbers of states have 
passed laws requiring cellphone users to have hands-free devices and laws banning 
texting while driving.CHAPTER 7 Reducing Your Spending 129
Curtailing personal-care costs
You have to take care of yourself, but as with anything else, you can find ways to 
do it that are expensive, and you can find ways that save you money. Try this 
money-saving advice:
» Hair care: Going bald is one way to save money in this category. I’m working 
on this one myself. In the meantime, if you have hair to be trimmed, a number 
of no-frills, low-cost, hair-cutting joints can do the job. Supercuts is one of the 
larger hair-care chains. You may insist that your stylist is the only one who can 
manage your hair the way you like it. At the prices charged by some of the 
trendy hair places, you have to really adore what they do to justify the price. 
Consider going periodically to a no-frills stylist for maintenance after getting a 
fabulous cut at a more expensive place. If you’re daring, you can try getting 
your hair cut at a local training school.
For parents of young children, buying simple-to-use home haircutting electric 
clippers (such as Wahl’s) can be a great time- and money-saver — no more 
agonizing trips with little ones to have their hair cut by a “stranger.” The kit 
pays for itself after just two haircuts!
» Other personal-care services: As long as I’m on the subject of outward 
beauty, I have to say that, in my personal opinion, the billions spent annually 
on cosmetics are largely a waste of money (not to mention all the wasted time 
spent applying and removing them). The difference in high prices for cosmetics 
in department stores and cosmetic stores like Ulta and Sephora over dramati￾cally lower prices in discount stores like Walmart and drugstores like Walgreens 
and CVS can add up quickly in savings. And just like the blind taste test with 
beer, no one can tell the difference between a $5 blush and a $20 one.
And having regular facials, pedicures, and manicures can add up quickly.
» Health club expenses: Money spent on exercise is almost always money well 
spent. But you don’t have to belong to a trendy club to receive the benefits of 
exercise. Local schools, colleges, and universities often have tennis courts, 
running tracks, swimming pools, basketball courts, and exercise rooms, and 
they may provide instruction as well. Community centers offer fitness 
programs and classes, too. Metropolitan areas that have lots of health clubs 
undoubtedly have the widest range of options and prices. Note: When 
figuring the cost of membership, be sure to factor in the cost of travel to and 
from the club, as well as any parking costs (and the realistic likelihood of going 
there regularly to work out).
Don’t forget that healthy exercise can be done indoors or out, free of charge. 
Isn’t hiking in the park or playing tennis or pickleball outside on a warm day 
more fun than pedaling away on a stationary bike, anyway? You may want to 
buy some basic gym equipment for use at home. Be careful, though: Lots of 
exercise equipment gathers dust at home.130 PART 2 Spending Less, Saving More
Paring down professional expenses
Accountants, lawyers, and financial advisors can be worth their expense if they’re 
good. But be wary of professionals who create or perpetuate work and have con￾flicts of interest with their recommendations.
Make sure that you get organized before meeting with professionals for tax, legal, 
or financial advice. Do some background research to evaluate their strengths and 
biases. Set goals and estimate fees in advance so you know what you’re getting 
yourself into.
Computer-based and other resources (see Chapters  20 and  21) can be useful, 
low-cost alternatives and supplements to hiring professionals.
Managing medical expenses
The cost of healthcare continues to go up fast. Your health insurance — if you 
have health insurance, that is — probably covers most of your healthcare needs. 
(Chapter 17 explains how to shop for health insurance.) But many plans require 
you to pay for certain expenses out of your own pocket.
Medical care and supplies are like any other services and products — prices and 
quality vary. And medicine in the United States, like any other profession, is a 
business. A conflict of interest exists whenever the person recommending treat￾ment benefits financially from providing that treatment. Many studies have docu￾mented some of the unnecessary surgeries and medical procedures that have 
resulted from this conflict of interest.
Remember to shop around when seeking health insurance. Don’t take any one 
physician’s advice as gospel. Always get a second opinion for any major surgery. 
Most health insurance plans, out of economic self-interest, require a second 
opinion, anyway.
Therapy can be useful and even lifesaving. Have a frank talk with your therapist 
about how much total time and money you can expect to spend and what kind of 
results you can expect to receive. As with any professional service, a competent 
therapist gives you a straight answer if they’re looking out for your psychological 
and financial well-being.
Alternative medicine (holistic, for example) is gaining attention because of its 
focus on preventive care and the treatment of the whole body or person. Although 
alternative medicine can be dangerous if you’re in critical condition, alternative 
treatment for some forms of chronic pain or disease may be worth investigating. 
Alternative medicine may lead to better and lower-cost healthcare.CHAPTER 7 Reducing Your Spending 131
If you have to take certain drugs on an ongoing basis and pay for them out-of￾pocket, ordering through a mail-order company can bring down your costs 
and help make refilling your prescriptions more convenient. Ask your health plan 
provider for more information about this option. Also inquire about generic 
versions of drugs. Websites and apps like GoodRx can help you save money on 
prescriptions though it can mean going to different drug stores for the best price 
on different prescriptions.
Examine your employer’s benefit plans. Take advantage of being able to put away 
a portion of your income before taxes to pay for out-of-pocket healthcare expenses. 
Make sure that you pay close attention to the “use it or lose it” provisions of some 
plans. (Uncover more about health savings accounts in Chapter 17.)
Eliminating costly addictions
Human beings are creatures of habit. Everybody has habits they wish they didn’t 
have, and breaking those habits can be very difficult. Costly habits are the worst. 
The following tidbits may nudge you in the right direction toward breaking your 
own financially draining habits.
» Kick the smoking habit. Check with local hospitals for smoking-cessation 
programs. The American Lung Association (phone 800-LUNGUSA; website 
www.lung.org) also offers Freedom from Smoking clinics around the country. 
The National Cancer Institute (phone 800-422-6237 or 800-4CANCER; website 
www.cancer.gov) and the Office on Smoking and Health at the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention (phone 800-784-8669 or 800-QUIT NOW; 
website www.cdc.gov/tobacco/about/osh/index.htm) offer free informa￾tion online and in guides that contain effective methods for stopping smoking.
» Stop abusing alcohol and other drugs. The Substance Abuse and Mental 
Health Services Administration (phone 800-662-4357 or 800-662-HELP; 
www.samhsa.gov/) can refer you to local drug treatment programs and can 
refer you to local treatment programs such as Alcoholics Anonymous. It also 
provides information and literature about the various types of substance 
abuse. Access their online treatment locator at findtreatment.gov.
» Don’t gamble. The house always comes out ahead in the long run. Why 
do you think so many governments run lotteries? Because governments 
make big money on people who gamble, that’s why. Casinos, horse and 
dog racetracks, and other gambling establishments are sure long-term 
losers for you. So, too, is the short-term trading of stocks, which isn’t investing 
but gambling. Getting hooked on the dream of winning is easy. And sure, 
occasionally you win a little bit (just enough to keep you coming back). Every 
now and then, a few folks win a lot. But your hard-earned capital mostly winds 
up in the pockets of the casino owners.132 PART 2 Spending Less, Saving More
If you gamble just for entertainment, take only what you can afford to lose. 
Gamblers Anonymous (phone 909-931-9056; website www.gamblersanonymous.
org) helps those for whom gambling has become an addiction.
Keeping an eye on insurance premiums
Insurance is a vast minefield. In Part 4, I explain the different types of coverage, 
suggest what to buy and avoid, and detail how to save on policies. The following 
list explains the most common ways people waste money on insurance:
» Keeping low deductibles. The deductible is the amount of a loss that must 
come out of your pocket. For example, if you have an auto insurance policy 
with a $100 collision deductible and you get into an accident, you pay for the 
first $100 of damage, and your insurance company picks up the rest. Low 
deductibles, however, translate into much higher premiums for you. In the 
long run, you save money with a higher deductible, even when factoring in 
the potential for greater out-of-pocket costs to you when you do have a claim. 
Insurance should protect you from economic disaster. Don’t get carried away 
with a really high deductible, which can cause financial hardship if you have a 
claim and lack savings.
If you have a lot of claims, you won’t come out ahead with lower deductibles, 
because your insurance premiums will escalate. Plus, low deductibles mean 
more claim forms to file for small losses (creating more hassle). Filing an 
insurance claim usually isn’t an enjoyable or quick experience.
» Covering small potential losses. You shouldn’t buy insurance for anything 
that won’t be a financial catastrophe if you have to pay for it out of your own 
pocket. Although the postal service isn’t perfect, insuring inexpensive gifts 
sent in the mail isn’t worth the price. Buying dental or home warranty plans, 
which also cover relatively small potential expenditures, doesn’t make 
financial sense for the same reason.
» Failing to shop around. Rates vary tremendously from insurer to insurer. In 
Part 4, I recommend the best companies to call for quotes and other cost￾saving strategies.
Trimming your taxes
Taxes are probably one of your largest  — if not the largest  — expenditures. 
(So why is it last here? Read on to find out.)CHAPTER 7 Reducing Your Spending 133
Retirement savings plans are one of the best and simplest ways to reduce your tax 
burden. (I explain more about retirement savings plans in Chapter 12.) Unfortu￾nately, most people can’t take full advantage of these plans because they spend 
everything they make. So not only do they have less savings, but they also pay 
higher income taxes — a double whammy.
I’ve attended many presentations where a fast-talking investment guy in an 
expensive suit lectures about the importance of saving for retirement and explains 
how to invest your savings. Yet details and tips about finding the money to save 
(the hard part for most people) are left to the imagination.
In order to take advantage of the tax savings that come through retirement sav￾ings plans, you must first spend less than you earn. Only then can you afford to 
contribute to these plans. That’s why the majority of this chapter is about strate￾gies to reduce your spending.
Reduced sales tax is another benefit of spending less and saving more. When you 
buy most consumer products and services, you pay sales tax. Therefore, when you 
spend less money and save more in retirement accounts, you reduce your income 
and sales taxes. (See Chapter 8 for detailed tax-reduction strategies.)CHAPTER 8 Managing and Reducing Your Taxes 135
Chapter 8
Managing and Reducing 
Your Taxes
You pay a lot of money in taxes  — probably more than you realize. Few 
people know just how much they pay in taxes each year. Most people 
remember whether they received a refund or owed money on their return. 
But when you file your tax return, all you’re doing is settling up with tax authori￾ties over the amount of taxes you paid during the year versus the total tax you owe 
based on your income and deductions.
This chapter gives you the lowdown on lowering your taxes — there are quite a 
few different areas that you can look to for reducing what you pay, but first up, I 
guide you through knowing what you have to pay.
Understanding the Taxes You Pay
Some people feel lucky when they get an income tax refund, but all a refund really 
indicates is that you overpaid your income taxes during the year. You should have 
had this money in your own account all along. If you’re consistently getting big

possible136 PART 2 Spending Less, Saving More
income tax refunds, you need to pay less tax throughout the year. (Fill out a W-4 
to determine how much you should be paying in taxes throughout the year. You 
can obtain a W-4 through your employer’s payroll department or from the IRS. If 
you’re self-employed, you can obtain Form 1040-ES by calling the IRS at 
800-TAX-FORM [800-829-3676] or visiting its website at www.irs.gov. The IRS 
website also has a helpful withholding calculator at www.irs.gov/individuals/
tax-withholding-estimator.)
Instead of focusing on whether you’re going to get a refund when you complete 
your annual tax return, concentrate on the total taxes you pay, which I discuss in 
the following section.
Focusing on your total taxes
To find out the total income taxes you pay, you need to get out your federal and 
state income tax returns. On each of those returns is a line that shows the total tax 
you owed for the year: This is Line 24 on the most recent federal 1040 returns. If you 
add up the totals from your federal and state income tax returns, you’ll probably 
see one of your largest expenses.
The goal of this chapter is to help you legally and permanently reduce your total 
taxes. Understanding the tax system is the key to reducing your tax burden — if 
you don’t, you’ll surely pay more taxes than necessary. Your tax ignorance can 
lead to mistakes, which can be costly if the IRS and state government catch your 
underpayment errors. With the proliferation of computerized information and 
data tracking, discovering mistakes has never been easier.
The tax system, like other public policy, is built around incentives to encourage 
desirable behavior and activity. For example, saving for retirement is considered 
desirable because it encourages people to prepare for a time in their lives when 
they may be less able or interested in working so much and when they may have 
additional healthcare expenses. Therefore, the tax code offers all sorts of tax 
perks, which I discuss later in this chapter, to encourage people to save in retire￾ment accounts.
Now, it’s a free country, and you should make choices that work best for your life 
and situation. However, keep in mind that the fewer desirable activities you engage 
in, the more you will generally pay in taxes. If you understand the options, you can 
choose the ones that meet your needs as you approach different stages of your 
financial life.CHAPTER 8 Managing and Reducing Your Taxes 137
Recognizing the importance 
of your marginal tax rate
When it comes to taxes, not all income is treated equally. This fact is far from self￾evident. If you work for an employer and earn a constant salary during the course 
of a year, a steady and equal amount of federal and state taxes is deducted from 
each paycheck. Thus, it appears as though all that earned income is being taxed 
equally.
In reality, however, you pay less tax on your first dollars of earnings and more tax 
on your last dollars of earnings. For example, if you’re single and your taxable 
income (see the next section) totals $50,000 during 2023, you pay federal tax at 
the rate of 10 percent on the first $11,000 of taxable income, 12 percent on income 
between $11,000 and $44,725, and 22 percent on income from $44,725 up to 
$50,000.
Table 8-1 gives federal tax rates for singles and married households filing jointly.
Your marginal tax rate is the rate of tax you pay on your last, or so-called highest,
dollars of income. A single person with taxable income of $50,000 has a federal 
marginal tax rate of 22 percent. In other words, she effectively pays 22-percent 
federal tax on her last dollars of income — those dollars in excess of $44,725.
Marginal tax rates are a powerful concept. Your marginal tax rate allows you to 
quickly calculate the additional taxes you’d have to pay on additional income. 
Conversely, you can enjoy quantifying the amount of taxes you save by reducing 
your taxable income, either by decreasing your income or by increasing your 
deductions.

37% More than $578,125 More than $693,750138 PART 2 Spending Less, Saving More
As you’re probably already painfully aware, you pay not only federal income taxes 
but also state income taxes — that is, unless you live in one of the handful of 
states (Alaska, Florida, Nevada, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, and Wyoming) 
that have no state income tax. Note: Some states don’t tax employment income but 
do tax certain investment income: New Hampshire (dividend and interest income) 
and Washington (capital gains income).
Your total marginal rate includes your federal and state income tax rates (not to 
mention local income tax rates in the municipalities that have them).
You can look up your state income tax rate in your current state income tax prep￾aration booklet or on the website for the state agency that collects income tax for 
your state.
Defining taxable income
Taxable income is the amount of income on which you actually pay income taxes. 
(In the sections that follow, I explain strategies for reducing your taxable income.) 
The following reasons explain why you don’t pay taxes on your total income:
» Not all income is taxable. For example, you pay federal income tax on the 
interest you earn on a bank savings account but not on the interest you earn 
from municipal bonds. As I discuss later in this chapter, some income, such as 
from stock dividends and long-term capital gains, is taxed at lower rates.
» You get to subtract deductions from your income. Some deductions are 
available just for being a living, breathing human being. In 2023, single people 
get an automatic $13,850 standard deduction, and married couples filing 
jointly get $27,700. (People over age 65 and those who are blind get a slightly 
higher deduction.) Other expenses, such as mortgage interest and property 
taxes, are deductible (subject to limitations) if these so-called itemized 
deductions exceed the standard deductions. When you contribute to 
qualified retirement plans, you also effectively get a deduction.
Being mindful of the second tax system: 
Alternative minimum tax
You may find this hard to believe, but a second tax system actually exists (as if the 
first tax system weren’t already complicated enough). This second system may 
raise your taxes even higher than they would normally be.CHAPTER 8 Managing and Reducing Your Taxes 139
Over the years, as the government grew hungry for more revenue, taxpayers who 
slashed their taxes by claiming lots of deductions or exclusions from taxable 
income came under greater scrutiny. So the government created a second tax 
system — the alternative minimum tax (AMT) — to ensure that those with high 
deductions or exclusions pay at least a certain percentage of taxes on their 
incomes. In its early years of existence, the AMT affected less than 1 percent of 
taxpayers, but that number greatly expanded over the decades until it impacted 
5 million taxpayers. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which took effect in 2018, reduced 
the impact back down to its original intent of just a few hundred thousand higher￾income taxpayers. However, those newer rules are scheduled to expire after 2025, 
at which time the AMT could hit upwards of 7 million taxpayers.
If you have a lot of deductions or exclusions from state income taxes, real-estate 
taxes, certain types of mortgage interest, and passive investments (for example, 
rental real estate), you may fall prey to AMT. You may also get tripped up by AMT 
if you exercise certain types of stock options or if you have a high amount of capi￾tal gains relative to your other ordinary income.
AMT restricts you from claiming certain deductions and requires you to add back 
in income that is normally tax-free (like certain municipal-bond interest). So you 
have to figure your tax under the AMT system and under the other system and 
then pay whichever amount is higher.
Analyzing recent tax law changes
For many years, I had written about the need for corporate tax reform. For too 
long, the United States has had way too high a corporate tax rate, which has caused 
increasing numbers of companies to choose to do less business in the United 
States.
The 2017 tax bill, named the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, took effect with tax year 
2018. In addition to lowering corporate income rates in the United States, this bill 
also lowered personal income tax rates and somewhat (but not greatly) simplified 
taxes for some tax filers. A greater share of the individual income tax benefits 
went to lower and moderate-income earners who are paying a smaller current 
share of federal income taxes. According to Brian Riedl, a senior fellow at the 
Manhattan Institute, his analysis at the time the act was passed showed, “The 
bottom 80 percent of families currently pay 33 percent of all combined federal 
taxes yet would get 37 percent of the tax cuts. By contrast, the top 1 percent cur￾rently pays 27 percent of all federal taxes but would get just 18 percent of the tax 
cuts. The result would be wealthy families paying a larger portion of the federal 
tax burden.”140 PART 2 Spending Less, Saving More
Here are the major changes in that tax bill:
» Lowered individual income tax rates: The tax rate applied in most of the 
federal income tax brackets was reduced about 2 to 3 percent, especially for 
lower to moderate income earners.
» Increased standard deduction and eliminated personal exemption:
Proponents of the bill liked to talk about how the standard deduction nearly 
doubled. This amount is deducted from your income before arriving at your 
taxable income, so a larger standard deduction reduces your taxable income 
and tax bill. However, Congress also eliminated exemptions, which reduced a 
person’s taxable income.
» Increased child tax credit: The child tax credit for children under the age 
of 17 was doubled, and up to $1,400 of that is refundable for taxpayers not 
otherwise owing federal income tax. Also, the incomes at which this credit 
starts phasing out rose to about three times its prior level.
» State and local taxes deduction capped at $10,000: This also includes 
property taxes on your home and for homeowners in high cost of living areas 
with high state income taxes (including metro areas such as San Francisco, 
Los Angeles, New York, and Washington D.C.). This cap posed a modest or 
even significant negative change. Because these taxes are itemized deduc￾tions, only being able to take up to $10,000 (previously unlimited) for them 
has caused some taxpayers to no longer be able to itemize. Also, by reducing 
the tax benefits of homeownership (see the next bullet), this change effec￾tively raised the cost of homeownership, especially in high cost and highly 
taxed areas.
» Mortgage-interest deduction for both primary and second homes 
capped at $750,000 borrowed: This represents a modest reduction from the 
previous $1 million limit on mortgage indebtedness deductibility.
Retirement accounts and retirement savings rules were ripe for revisions and 
improvement. Some of those happened with the SECURE (Setting Every Commu￾nity Up for Retirement Enhancement) Act of 2019. Of course, Congress couldn’t 
leave well enough alone. So another bill — the SECURE Act 2.0 of 2022 — was 
passed to make yet more changes to retirement accounts. Here are the highlights 
of these two bills:
» Small-business owners are eligible for up to $5,000 in tax credits when 
starting a retirement plan. This credit applies to new 401(k), profit sharing, 
SEP, and SIMPLE plans for small employers (up to 100 employees).
» More workers can participate in company 401(k) plans. Previously, you had 
to work at least 1,000 hours per year to take part in a company’s 401(k) plan. 
Now, workers who achieve at least 500 hours over three consecutive years may CHAPTER 8 Managing and Reducing Your Taxes 141
participate. Effective in 2025, employees must be eligible to participate in their 
employer’s qualified retirement plans after two years of service.
» You can withdraw up to $5,000 per parent penalty-free from your 
retirement plan for a “qualified birth or adoption distribution” for 
the birth or adoption of a child. This new provision waives the normal 
10 percent early withdrawal penalty and allows you to repay the withdrawn 
money as a rollover contribution.
» 529 funds can be used to pay down student loans. You can pay down up to 
$10,000 in student loans and pay for qualifying apprenticeship programs.
» Employer matching of student loan repayments permitted. Beginning in 
2024, employers can elect to match student loan repayments in the form of 
retirement account contributions.
» Automatic employee enrollment in company 401(k) and 403(b) plans.
Beginning with new 401(k) and 403(b) plans in 2025, companies must 
automatically enroll eligible employees. (This is going to be wonderful!)
» Increase in retirement plan contribution limits for older workers. As of 
2023, workers aged 50 and older are able to contribute $7,500 more per year 
(increased annually with inflation) than younger workers to most retirement 
plans. Beginning in 2025, the contribution limits for those aged 60 to 63 increases 
so that that age group may contribute up to $10,000 more per year (increasing 
annually with inflation) than younger workers in most retirement plans and 
$5,000 more annually for SIMPLE plans.
» Required minimum distributions (RMDs) from retirement accounts 
begin at age 72, not 70½. Effective in 2023, the RMD increases to 73, and 
then to age 75 in 2033.This gives you more options and flexibility, but delaying 
required distributions that are based upon your life expectancy may or may 
not be in your best long-term interests.
» You can make traditional IRA contributions past age 70½ so long as you 
continue earning employment income. This brings the contribution rules 
for these accounts into alignment with those for Roth IRAs and 401(k)s (see 
Chapter 12 for more information on these types of retirement accounts).
» Inherited retirement accounts must now be tapped and emptied through 
distributions generally within a decade. Before when folks inherited a 
retirement account, the inheritor could stretch their distributions and associ￾ated tax payments out over their life expectancy. For retirement accounts now 
inherited from original owners who have passed away in 2020 or later years, 
most beneficiaries must complete withdrawals from the account within 
ten years of the death of the account holder. There are some exceptions to 
this ten-year rule for retirement accounts left to a surviving spouse, a minor 
child, a disabled or chronically ill beneficiary, and beneficiaries who are less 
than ten years younger than the original retirement account owner.142 PART 2 Spending Less, Saving More
Trimming Employment Income Taxes
You’re supposed to pay taxes on income you earn from work. Countless illegal 
methods can reduce your taxable employment income — for example, not report￾ing it — but if you use them, you can very well end up paying a heap of penalties 
and extra interest charges on top of the taxes you owe. And you may even get 
tossed in jail. Because I don’t want you to serve jail time or lose even more money 
by paying unnecessary penalties and interest, this section focuses on the best legal
ways to reduce your income taxes on your earnings from work.
Contributing to retirement 
investment plans
A retirement investment plan is one of the few relatively painless and authorized 
ways to reduce your taxable employment income. Besides reducing your taxes, 
retirement plans help you build up a nest egg so you don’t have to work for the 
rest of your life.
You can exclude money from your taxable income by tucking it away in employer￾based retirement plans, such as 401(k) or 403(b) accounts, or self-employed 
retirement plans, such as SEP-IRAs. If your combined federal and state marginal 
tax rate is, say, 33 percent and you contribute $1,000 to one of these plans, you 
reduce your federal and state taxes by $330. Do you like the sound of that? How 
about this: Contribute another $1,000, and your taxes drop another $330 (as long 
as you’re still in the same marginal tax rate). And when your money is inside a 
retirement account, it can compound and grow without taxation.
Many people miss this great opportunity to reduce their taxes because they spend
all (or too much) of their current employment income and, therefore, have noth￾ing (or little) left to put into a retirement account. If you’re in this predicament, 
you first need to reduce your spending before you can contribute money to a 
retirement plan. (Chapter 7 explains how to decrease your spending.)
If your employer doesn’t offer the option of saving money through a retirement 
plan, lobby the benefits and human resources departments. If they resist, you may 
want to add this to your list of reasons for considering another employer. Many 
employers offer this valuable benefit, but some don’t. Some company decision￾makers either don’t understand the value of these accounts or feel that they’re too 
costly to set up and administer.CHAPTER 8 Managing and Reducing Your Taxes 143
If your employer doesn’t offer a retirement savings plan, individual retirement 
account (IRA) contributions may or may not be tax-deductible, depending on your 
circumstances. You should first maximize contributions to the previously men￾tioned tax-deductible accounts. Chapter 12 can help you determine whether you 
should contribute to an IRA, what type you should contribute to, and whether your 
IRA contributions are tax-deductible.
Lower- and moderate-income earners can gain a federal tax credit known as the 
“Saver’s Credit.” Married couples filing jointly with adjusted gross incomes (AGIs) 
of less than $73,000 and single taxpayers with an AGI of less than $36,500 can 
earn a tax credit (claimed on Form 8880) for retirement account contributions. 
Unlike a deduction, a tax credit directly reduces your tax bill by the amount of the 
credit. This credit, which is detailed in Table  8-2, is a percentage of the first 
$2,000 contributed (or $4,000 on a joint return). The credit is not available to 
those under the age of 18, full-time students, or people who are claimed as depen￾dents on someone else’s tax return.
Shifting some income
Income shifting, which has nothing to do with money laundering, is a more esoteric 
tax-reduction technique that’s an option only to those who can control when they 
receive their income.
For example, suppose your employer tells you in late December that you’re eligi￾ble for a bonus. You’re offered the option to receive your bonus in either December 
or January. If you’re pretty certain that you’ll be in a higher tax bracket next year, 
you should choose to receive your bonus in December.
Or, suppose you run your own business and you think that you’ll be in a lower tax 
bracket next year. Perhaps you plan to take time off to be with a newborn or take 
an extended trip. You can send out some invoices later in the year so your custom￾ers won’t pay you until January, which falls in the next tax year.

Increasing Your Deductions
Deductions are amounts you subtract from your adjusted gross income before cal￾culating the tax you owe. To make things more complicated, the IRS gives you two 
methods for determining your total deductions. The good news is that you get to 
pick the method that leads to greater deductions — and hence, lower taxes. This 
section explains your options.
Choosing standard or itemized deductions
The first method for figuring deductions requires no thinking or calculating. If 
you have a relatively uncomplicated financial life, taking the so-called standard 
deduction is generally the better option. With the tax reform bill passed in 2017 and 
implemented in 2018, more people are better off taking the standard deduction. 
And that is in fact what has been happening with nearly nine in ten taxpayers now 
taking the standard deduction (down from about two-thirds previously).
Single folks qualify for a $13,850 standard deduction, and married couples filing 
jointly get a $27,700 standard deduction in 2023. If you’re 65 or older, or blind, 
you get a slightly higher standard deduction.
Itemizing your deductions on your tax return is the other method for determining 
your allowable deductions. This method is definitely more of a hassle, but if you 
can tally up more than the standard amounts noted in the preceding paragraph, 
itemizing will save you money. Use Schedule A of IRS Form 1040 to tally your 
itemized deductions.
Even if you take the standard deduction, take the time to peruse all the line items 
on Schedule A to familiarize yourself with the many legal itemized deductions. 
Figure out what’s possible to deduct so you can make more-informed financial 
decisions year-round.
Organizing your deductions
Locating Form 1098 and all the other scraps of paper you need when completing 
your tax return can be a hassle. Setting up a filing system can be a big timesaver:
» Folder or shoebox: If you have a simple financial life (that is, you haven’t 
saved receipts throughout the year), you can confine your filing to January 
and February. During those months, you receive tax summary statements on 
wages paid by your employer (Form W-2), investment income (Form 1099), 
and home mortgage interest (Form 1098) in the mail. Label the shoebox or 
folder with something easy to remember (“2024 Taxes” is a logical choice) and CHAPTER 8 Managing and Reducing Your Taxes 145
dump these documents into it. When you’re ready to crunch numbers, you’ll 
have everything you need to complete the form.
» Accordion-type file: Organizing the bills you pay into individual folders during 
the entire year is a more thorough approach. This method is essential if you 
own your own business and need to tabulate your expenditures for office 
supplies each year. No one is going to send you a form totaling your office 
expenditures for the year — you’re on your own.
» Software: Software programs can help organize your tax information during 
the year and save you time and accounting fees come tax-preparation time. 
See Chapter 20 for more information about tax and financial software.
Shifting or bunching deductions
When you total your itemized deductions on Schedule A and the sum is lower than 
the standard deduction, you should take the standard deduction. This total is 
worth checking each year, because you may have more deductions in some years, 
and itemizing may make sense.
Because you can control when you pay particular expenses that are eligible for 
itemizing, you can shift or bunch more of them into the select years where you 
have enough deductions to take advantage of itemizing. Suppose, for example, 
that you’re using the standard deduction this year because you don’t have many 
itemized deductions. Late in the year, though, you become certain that you’re 
going to buy a home next year. With mortgage interest and property taxes to write 
off, you expect to be able to itemize next year. If you typically make more charita￾ble contributions in December because of the barrage of solicitations you receive 
when you’re in the giving mood, you may want to make those donations in January 
rather than in December.
When you’re sure that you’re not going to have enough deductions in the current 
year to itemize, try to shift as many expenses as you can into the next tax year.
The following sections explain commonly overlooked deductions and deduction 
strategies. Some are listed on Schedule A, and others appear on Form 1040.
Purchasing real estate
When you buy a home, you can claim two big ongoing expenses of homeownership 
as deductions on Schedule A: your property taxes and the interest on your mort￾gage. You’re allowed to claim mortgage interest deductions for a primary residence 
(where you actually live) and on a second home for mortgage debt totaling up to 
$750,000, which is down from the previous limit of $1 million (and a home equity 
loan of up to $100,000). You may be grandfathered under the higher $1 million 146 PART 2 Spending Less, Saving More
limit if your mortgage was taken out before December 16, 2017, or if you had a 
home under contract by that date and closed on that purchase by April 1, 2018.
Before 2018, there was no limit on property tax deductions on Form 1040, Sched￾ule A. Now, property taxes (combined with state and local income tax payments) 
are limited to a maximum $10,000 annual deduction.
To buy real estate, you need to first collect a down payment, which requires main￾taining a lid on your spending. See Part 1 for help with prioritizing and achieving 
important financial goals. Check out Chapter 15 for more on investing in real estate.
Trading consumer debt for mortgage debt
When you own real estate, you haven’t borrowed the maximum, and you’ve run 
up high-interest consumer debt, you may be able to trade one debt for another. 
You may be able to save on interest charges by refinancing your mortgage or tak￾ing out a home equity loan and pulling out extra cash to pay off your credit card, 
auto loan, or other costly credit lines. You can usually borrow at a lower interest 
rate for a mortgage and get a tax deduction as a bonus, which lowers the effective 
borrowing cost further. Consumer debt, such as that on auto loans and credit 
cards, isn’t tax-deductible.
This strategy involves some danger. Borrowing against the equity in your home 
can be an addictive habit. I’ve seen cases where people run up significant con￾sumer debt three or four times and then refinance their home the same number of 
times over the years to bail themselves out.
An appreciating home creates the illusion that excess spending isn’t really costing 
you. But debt is debt, and all borrowed money ultimately has to be repaid (unless 
you file bankruptcy). In the long run, you wind up with greater mortgage debt, 
and paying it off takes a bigger bite out of your monthly income. Refinancing and 
establishing home equity lines cost you more in terms of loan application fees and 
other charges (points, appraisals, credit reports, and so on).
At a minimum, the continued expansion of your mortgage debt handicaps your 
ability to work toward other financial goals. In the worst case, easy access to bor￾rowing encourages bad spending habits that can lead to bankruptcy or foreclosure 
on your debt-ridden home.
Contributing to charities
You can deduct contributions to charities if you itemize your deductions on Form 
1040, Schedule A. Consider the following possibilities:CHAPTER 8 Managing and Reducing Your Taxes 147
» Most people know that when they write a check for $50 to their favorite 
church or college, they can deduct it. Note: Make sure that you get a receipt 
for contributions of $250 or more.
» Many taxpayers overlook the fact that you can deduct expenses for work you 
do with charitable organizations. For example, when you go to a soup kitchen 
to help prepare and serve meals, you can deduct some of your transportation 
costs. Keep track of your driving mileage and other commuting expenses.
» You can deduct the fair market value (which can be determined by looking at 
the price of similar merchandise in thrift stores) of donations of clothing, 
household appliances, furniture, and other goods to charities. (Some charities 
will drive to your home to pick up the stuff.) Find out whether organizations 
such as the Salvation Army, Goodwill, or others are interested in your donation. 
Just make sure that you keep some documentation — write up an itemized list 
and get it signed by the charity. Take pictures of your more valuable donations.
» You can even donate securities and other investments to charity. In fact, 
donating an appreciated investment gives you a tax deduction for the full 
market value of the investment and eliminates your need to pay tax on the 
(unrealized) profit.
Remembering auto registration 
fees and state insurance
If you don’t currently itemize, you may be surprised to discover that your state 
income taxes can be itemized. When you pay a fee to the state to register and 
license your car, you can itemize a portion of the expenditure as a deduction (on 
Schedule A, Line 5c, “State and Local Personal Property Taxes”). The IRS allows 
you to deduct the part of the fee that relates to the value of your car. The state 
organization that collects the fee should be able to tell you what portion of the 
fee is deductible. (Some states detail on the invoice what portion of the fee is 
tax-deductible.) There’s a $10,000 annual federal income tax deduction limit 
on all deductible state and local taxes combined with property tax payments on 
your home.
Several states have state disability insurance funds. If you pay into these funds 
(check your W-2), you can deduct your payments as state and local income taxes 
on Line 5a of Schedule A. You may also claim a deduction on this line for payments 
you make into your state’s unemployment compensation fund.148 PART 2 Spending Less, Saving More
Deducting self-employment expenses
When you’re self-employed, you can deduct a multitude of expenses from your 
income before calculating the tax you owe. If you buy a computer or office furni￾ture, you can deduct those expenses. (Sometimes they need to be gradually 
deducted, or depreciated, over time.) Salaries for your employees, office supplies, 
rent or mortgage interest for your office space, and phone/communications 
expenses are also generally deductible.
Many self-employed folks don’t take all the deductions they’re eligible for. In 
some cases, people simply aren’t aware of the wonderful world of deductions. 
Others are worried that large deductions will increase the risk of an audit. Spend 
some time finding out more about tax deductions; you’ll be convinced that taking 
full advantage of your eligible deductions makes sense and saves you money.
The following are common mistakes made by people who are their own bosses:
» Being an island unto yourself. When you’re self-employed, going it alone is 
usually a mistake when it comes to taxes. You must educate yourself to make 
the tax laws work for rather than against you. Hiring tax help is well worth 
your while. (See “Hiring professional help” later in this chapter for information 
on hiring tax advisors.)
» Making administrative tax screwups. As a self-employed individual, you’re 
responsible for the correct and timely filing of all taxes owed on your income 
and employment taxes on your employees. You need to make estimated tax 
payments on a quarterly basis. And if you have employees, you also need to 
withhold taxes from each paycheck they receive and make timely payments to 
the IRS and the appropriate state authorities. In addition to federal and state 
income tax, you also need to withhold and send in Social Security and any 
other state or locally mandated payroll taxes.
To pay taxes on your income, use Form 1040-ES. This form, along with 
instructions, can be obtained from the IRS (phone 800-829-3676; website www.
irs.gov). The form comes complete with an estimated tax worksheet and the 
four payment coupons you need to send in with your quarterly tax payments. 
If you want to find the rules for withholding and submitting taxes from 
employees’ paychecks, obtain IRS Form 941 and Form 940, which is for 
unemployment insurance. And unless you’re lucky enough to live in a state 
with no income taxes, you need to obtain your state’s estimated income tax 
package. Another alternative is to hire a payroll firm, such as ADP, Gusto, or 
Paychex, to do all this drudgery for you or get good payroll software.
» Failing to document expenses. When you pay with cash, following the paper 
trail for all the money you spent can be hard for you to do (and for the IRS, in 
the event you’re ever audited). At the end of the year, how are you going to CHAPTER 8 Managing and Reducing Your Taxes 149
remember how much you spent for parking or client meals if you fail to keep 
a record? How will you survive an IRS audit without proper documentation?
Credit cards and debit cards are accepted most places and provide a conven￾ient paper trail. (Be careful about getting a debit card in your business’s name, 
because some banks don’t offer protection against fraudulent use of business 
debit cards.) Otherwise, you need a record of your daily petty cash purchases. 
Most pocket calendars or daily organizers include ledgers that allow you to 
track these small purchases. Some software and apps can help with this as 
well (see Chapter 20).
» Failing to fund a retirement plan. You should be saving money toward 
retirement anyway, and you can’t beat the tax break. People who are self￾employed are allowed to save a substantial portion of their net income on an 
annual basis. To find out more about SEP-IRAs and other retirement plans, 
see Chapter 12.
» Failing to use numbers to help manage business. If you’re a small-business 
owner who doesn’t track her income, expenses, staff performance, and 
customer data on a regular basis, your tax return may be the one and only 
time during the year when you take a financial snapshot of your business. 
After you go through all the time, trouble, and expense to file your tax return, 
make sure you reap the rewards of all your work; use those numbers to help 
analyze and manage your business.
Some bookkeepers and tax preparers can provide you with management 
information reports on your business from the tax data they compile for you. 
Just ask! See “Using software and websites” later in this chapter for my 
recommendations.
» Failing to pay family help. If your children, spouse, or other relatives help 
with some aspect of your business, consider paying them for the work. 
Besides showing them that you value their work, this practice may reduce 
your family’s tax liability. For example, children are usually in a lower tax 
bracket. By shifting some of your income to family members, you not only 
cut your tax bill but can also make them eligible for attractive savings options 
like IRAs.
Reducing Investment Income Taxes
The distributions and profits on investments that you hold outside of tax￾sheltered retirement accounts are exposed to taxation when you receive them. 
Interest, dividends, and capital gains (profits from the sale of an investment at a 
price that’s higher than the purchase price) are all taxed.150 PART 2 Spending Less, Saving More
Although this section explains some of the best methods for reducing the taxes on 
investments exposed to taxation, Chapter 13 discusses how and where to invest 
money held outside of tax-sheltered retirement accounts such as IRAs and 401(k) 
plans.
Investing in tax-free money-market 
funds and bonds
When you’re in a high enough tax bracket, you may find that you come out ahead 
with tax-free investments. Tax-free investments pay investment income, which 
is exempt from federal tax, state tax, or both. (See Part 3 for details.)
Tax-free investments normally yield less than comparable investments that 
produce taxable income. But because of the difference in taxes, the earnings from 
tax-free investments can end up being greater than what you’re left with from 
taxable investments.
Tax-free money-market funds can be a better alternative to bank savings accounts 
(where interest is subject to taxation). Likewise, tax-free bonds are intended to be 
longer-term investments that pay tax-free interest, so they may be a better 
investment option for you than bank certificates of deposit, Treasury bills and 
bonds, and other investments that produce taxable income. (See Chapter 13 for 
specifics on which tax-free investments may be right for your situation.)
Selecting other tax-friendly investments
Too often when selecting investments, people mistakenly focus on past rates of 
return. Everyone is wise to remember that the past is no guarantee of the future. 
But choosing an investment with a reportedly high rate of return without consid￾ering tax consequences is an even worse mistake. What you get to keep — after 
taxes — is what matters in the long run.
For example, when comparing two similar funds, most people prefer a fund that 
averages returns of 14 percent per year to one that earns 12 percent per year. But 
what if the 14-percent-per-year fund, because of greater taxable distributions, 
causes you to pay a lot more in taxes? What if, after factoring in taxes, the 
14-percent-per-year fund nets just 9 percent, while the 12-percent-per-year 
fund nets an effective 10-percent return? In such a case, you’d be unwise to choose 
a fund solely on the basis of the higher (pre-tax) reported rate of return.
I call investments that appreciate in value and don’t distribute much in the way of 
highly taxed income tax-friendly. (Some in the investment business use the term 
tax-efficient.) See Chapter 11 for more information on tax-friendly stocks and stock 
mutual funds.CHAPTER 8 Managing and Reducing Your Taxes 151
Real estate is one of the few areas with privileged status in the tax code. In addi￾tion to deductions allowed for mortgage interest and property taxes, you can 
depreciate rental property to reduce your taxable income. Depreciation is a special 
tax deduction allowed for the gradual wear and tear on rental real estate. When 
you sell investment real estate, you may be eligible to conduct a tax-free exchange 
into a replacement rental property. See Chapter 15 for a crash course in real estate.
Making your profits long term
As I discuss in Part 3, when you buy growth investments such as stocks and real 
estate, you should do so for the long term — ideally ten or more years. The tax 
system rewards your patience with lower tax rates on your profits.
When you’re able to hold on to an investment (outside of a retirement account) 
such as a stock, bond, or mutual fund for more than one year, you get a tax break 
if you sell that investment at a profit. Specifically, your profit is taxed under the 
lower capital gains tax rate schedule. High-income earners pay 20 percent of their 
long-term capital gains’ profit in federal taxes. (The same lower tax rate applies 
to stock dividends.) Most moderate- and upper-income taxpayers face a long￾term capital gains tax rate of 15 percent. Finally, for those in the lowest tax brack￾ets, the long-term capital gains tax rate is 0 percent (see Table 8-3).
High-income taxpayers (with total taxable income above $200,000 for singles; 
$250,000 for marrieds filing jointly) are subject to a 3.8-percent-higher tax on 
their investment income (for example, interest, dividends, and capital gains) to 
help pay for Obamacare. This produces a top long-term capital gains rate of nearly 
24 percent.
Does funding retirement accounts 
still make sense?
Historically, taking advantage of opportunities to direct money into retirement 
accounts gives you two possible tax benefits. First, your contributions to the 
retirement account may be immediately tax-deductible (see Chapter 12 for details). 
TABLE 8-3	 Tax Rate on Long-Term Capital Gains and Stock Dividends
Tax Rate Single Taxpayers Married Filing Jointly Taxpayers
0% $0–41,675 $0–$83,350
15% $41,675–$459,750 $83,350–$517,200
20% Over $459,750 Over $517,200152 PART 2 Spending Less, Saving More
Second, the returns on the investments in the retirement accounts aren’t gener￾ally taxed until withdrawal.
In the preceding section, I mention a tax break for long-term capital gains and on 
stock dividends. This break, unfortunately, applies only to investments held out￾side of retirement accounts. If you realize a long-term capital gain or receive stock 
dividends inside a retirement account, those investment returns are taxed, upon 
withdrawal, at the relatively higher ordinary income tax rates. Thus, some people 
argue that you shouldn’t fund retirement accounts. In most cases, the people 
making those arguments have a vested interest.
One good reason not to fund a retirement account is having a specific goal, such 
as saving to purchase a home or start a business, that necessitates having access 
to your money. Not funding a retirement account may make sense in two other 
atypical situations:
» You’re temporarily in a low tax bracket. This circumstance can come about 
if, for example, you lose your job for an extended period of time or are in 
school. In these cases, you’re unlikely to have lots of spare money to contrib￾ute to a retirement account anyway! If you have some employment income, 
consider the Roth IRA (see Chapter 12).
» You have too much money socked away already. If you have a large net 
worth inside retirement accounts as you approach your later years, continuing 
to fund your retirement may be counterproductive. You will eventually be 
forced to make annual withdrawals (required minimum distributions) from 
these accounts, which can push you into higher and higher tax brackets in your 
retirement years if you have significant sums stashed in retirement accounts.
Enlisting Education Tax Breaks
The government offers several tax reduction opportunities for those with educa￾tional expenses. Knowing that you don’t want to read the dreadful tax code, here’s 
a summary of key provisions you should know about for yourself and your kids if 
you have them:
» Student loan interest deduction: You may take up to a $2,500 deduction for 
student loan interest that you pay on IRS Form 1040 for college costs as long 
as your modified adjusted gross income (AGI) is less than or equal to $70,000 
for single taxpayers and $145,000 for married couples filing jointly. (Note:
Your deduction is phased out if your AGI is between $70,000 and $85,000 for CHAPTER 8 Managing and Reducing Your Taxes 153
single taxpayers and between $145,000 and $175,000 for married couples 
filing jointly.)
» Tax-free investment earnings in special accounts: Money invested in 
section 529 plans is sheltered from taxation and is not taxed upon withdrawal 
as long as the money is used to pay for eligible education expenses. Subject to 
eligibility requirements, 529 plans allow you to sock away $200,000+. Please 
be aware, however, that funding such accounts may harm your potential 
financial aid. (See Chapter 14 for details on these accounts.)
» Tax credits: The American Opportunity (AO) credit and Lifetime Learning (LL) 
credit provide tax relief to low- and moderate-income earners facing educa￾tion costs. The AO credit may be up to $2,500 per student per year of 
undergraduate education, while the LL credit may be up to $2,000 per 
taxpayer. Each student may take only one of these credits per tax year, 
and they are subject to income and other limitations.
Read Chapter 14 for the best ways and strategies to pay for educational expenses.
Getting Help from Tax Resources
There are all sorts of ways to prepare your tax return. Which approach makes 
sense for you depends on the complexity of your situation and your knowledge of 
taxes.
Regardless of which approach you use, you should be taking financial steps during 
the year to reduce your taxes. By the time you actually file your return in the fol￾lowing year, it’s often too late for you to take advantage of many tax-reduction 
strategies.
Obtaining IRS assistance
If you have a simple, straightforward tax return, filing it on your own using only 
the IRS instructions is likely fine. This approach is as cheap as you can get. The 
main costs are time, patience, photocopying expenses (you should always keep a 
copy for your files), and postage for mailing the completed tax return (unless 
you’re filing electronically).
IRS publications don’t have Tip or Warning icons. And the IRS has been known to 
give wrong information from time to time. When you call the IRS with a question, 
be sure to take notes about your conversation to protect yourself in the event of an 
audit. Date your notes and include the name and identification number of the tax 154 PART 2 Spending Less, Saving More
employee you talked to, the questions you asked, and the employee’s responses. 
File your notes in a folder with a copy of your completed return.
In addition to the IRS’ standard tax-return preparation instructions, the IRS offers 
some free (actually, paid for with your tax dollars) and sometimes-useful book￾lets. Publication 17, Your Federal Income Tax, is designed for individual tax-return 
preparation. Publication 334, Tax Guide for Small Businesses, is for (you guessed it) 
small-business tax-return preparation (particularly those small business owners 
who use Form 1040, Schedule C). These publications are more comprehensive than 
the basic IRS instructions. Call 800-829-3676 to request these booklets or visit the 
IRS website at www.irs.gov.
Consulting preparation and advice guides
Books about tax preparation and tax planning that highlight common problem 
areas and are written in clear, simple English are invaluable. They supplement the 
official instructions not only by helping you complete your return correctly but 
also by showing you how to save as much money as possible.
Check out the latest edition of Taxes For Dummies, which I co-authored, and my 
Small Business Taxes For Dummies, both published by Wiley.
Using software and websites
If you have access to a computer, good tax-preparation software can be helpful. 
TurboTax, H&R Block Tax Software, and TaxSlayer are programs that I have 
reviewed and rated as the best. If you go the software route, I highly recommend 
having a good tax advice book by your side.
For you web surfers, the Internal Revenue Service website (www.irs.gov) is among 
the better internet tax sites, believe it or not.
Hiring professional help
Competent tax preparers and advisors can save you money — sometimes more 
than enough to pay their fees — by identifying tax-reduction strategies you may 
overlook. They can also help reduce the likelihood of an audit, which can be trig￾gered by blunders. Mediocre and lousy tax preparers, on the other hand, may 
make mistakes and be unaware of sound ways to reduce your tax bill.
Tax preparers and advisors come with varying backgrounds, training, and creden￾tials. The four main types of tax practitioners are preparers, enrolled agents (EAs), CHAPTER 8 Managing and Reducing Your Taxes 155
certified public accountants (CPAs), and tax attorneys. The more training and 
specialization a tax practitioner has (and the more affluent their clients), the 
higher their hourly fee usually is. Fees and competence vary greatly. If you hire a 
tax advisor and you’re not sure of the quality of the work performed or the sound￾ness of the advice, try getting a second opinion.
Preparers
Preparers generally have the least amount of training of all the tax practitioners, 
and a greater proportion of them work part-time. As with financial planners, no 
national regulations apply to preparers, and no licensing is required.
Preparers are appealing because they’re relatively inexpensive  — they can do 
most basic returns for around $100 or so. The drawback of using a preparer is that 
you may hire someone who doesn’t know much more than you do.
Preparers make the most sense for folks who have relatively simple financial lives, 
who are budget-minded, and who hate doing their own taxes. If you’re not good 
about hanging on to receipts or you don’t want to keep your own files with back￾ground details about your taxes, you should definitely shop around for a tax pre￾parer who’s committed to the business. You may need all that stuff someday for 
an audit, and many tax preparers keep and organize their clients’ documentation 
rather than return everything each year. Also, going with a firm that’s open year￾round may be a safer option (some small shops are open only during tax season) 
in case tax questions or problems arise.
Enrolled agents (EAs)
A person must pass IRS scrutiny in order to be called an enrolled agent. This license 
allows the agent to represent you before the IRS in the event of an audit. Continu￾ing education is also required; an EA’s training is generally longer and more 
sophisticated than that of a typical preparer.
Enrolled agents’ fees tend to fall between those of a preparer and a CPA (see the 
next section). Returns that require a few of the more common schedules (such as 
Schedule A for deductions and Schedule D for capital gains and losses) shouldn’t 
cost more than a few hundred dollars to prepare.
EAs are best for people who have moderately complex returns and don’t necessar￾ily need complicated tax-planning advice throughout the year (although some 
EAs provide this service as well). You can get names and telephone numbers of 
EAs in your area by contacting the National Association of Enrolled Agents (NAEA). 
You can call the NAEA at 202-822-6232 or visit its website at www.naea.org.156 PART 2 Spending Less, Saving More
Certified public accountants (CPAs)
Certified public accountants go through significant training and examination 
before receiving the CPA credential. In order to maintain this designation, a CPA 
must also complete a fair number of continuing education classes every year.
CPA fees vary tremendously. Most charge $150+ per hour, but CPAs at large com￾panies and in high-cost-of-living areas tend to charge somewhat more.
If you’re self-employed and/or you file lots of other schedules, you may want to 
hire a CPA. But you don’t need to do so year after year. If your situation grows 
complex one year and then stabilizes, consider getting help for the perplexing 
year and then using preparation guides, software, or a lower-cost preparer or 
enrolled agent in the future.
Tax attorneys
Tax attorneys deal with complicated tax problems and issues that usually have 
some legal angle. Unless you’re a super-high-income earner with a complex 
financial life, hiring a tax attorney to prepare your annual return is prohibitively 
expensive. In fact, many tax attorneys don’t prepare returns, but they may offer 
tax preparation as an ancillary service through others in their office.
Because of their level of specialization and training, tax attorneys tend to have the 
highest hourly billing rates — $300+ per hour is not unusual.
Dealing with an Audit
On a list of real-life nightmares, most people would rank tax audits right up there 
with root canals, rectal exams, and court appearances. Many people are trauma￾tized by audits because they feel like they’re on trial and being accused of a crime. 
Take a deep breath and don’t panic.
You may be getting audited simply because someone at the IRS or a business that 
reports tax information on you made an error regarding the data on your return. 
In the vast majority of cases, the IRS conducts its audit by corresponding with you 
through the mail.
Audits that require you to schlep to the local IRS office are the most feared type of 
audit. In these cases, about 20 percent of such audited returns are left unchanged 
by the audit — in other words, the taxpayer doesn’t end up owing more money. In 
fact, if you’re the lucky sort, you may be one of the 5 percent of folks who actually 
gets a refund because the audit finds a mistake in your favor!CHAPTER 8 Managing and Reducing Your Taxes 157
Unfortunately, you’ll most likely be one of the roughly 75 percent of audit survi￾vors who end up owing more tax money. The amount of additional tax that you 
owe in interest and penalties hinges on how your audit goes.
Getting your act together
Preparing for an audit is sort of like preparing for a test at school. The IRS lets you 
know which sections of your tax return it wants to examine.
The first decision you face when you get an audit notice is whether to handle it 
yourself or hire a tax advisor to represent you. Hiring representation may help you 
save time, stress, and money.
If you normally prepare your own return and you’re comfortable with your under￾standing of the areas being audited, handle the audit yourself. When the amount 
of tax money in question is small compared to the fee you’d pay the tax advisor to 
represent you, self-representation is probably your best option. However, if you’re 
likely to turn into a babbling, intimidated fool and you’re unsure of how to present 
your situation, hire a tax advisor to represent you. (See “Hiring professional help” 
earlier in this chapter for information about whom to hire.)
If you decide to handle the audit yourself, get your act together sooner rather than 
later. Don’t wait until the night before to start gathering documentation. You may 
need to contact others to get copies of documents you can’t find.
You need to document and be ready to speak only about the areas the audit notice 
says are being investigated. Organize the various documents and receipts into 
folders. You want to make it as easy as possible for the auditor to review your 
materials. Don’t show up, dump shopping bags full of receipts and paperwork on 
the auditor’s desk, and say, “Here it is — you figure it out.”
Whatever you do, don’t ignore your audit request letter. The IRS is the ultimate bill￾collection agency. And if you end up owing more money (the unhappy result of 
most audits), the sooner you pay, the less interest and penalties you’ll owe.
Surviving the day of reckoning
Two people with identical situations can walk into an audit and come out with 
very different results. The loser can end up owing much more in taxes and have 
the audit expanded to include other parts of the return. The winner can end up 
owing no additional tax or even owing less.158 PART 2 Spending Less, Saving More
Here’s how to be a winner in your tax audit:
» Treat the auditor as a human being. This advice may be obvious, but it isn’t 
practiced by taxpayers very often. You may be resentful or angry about being 
audited. You may be tempted to gnash your teeth and tell the auditor how 
unfair it is that an honest taxpayer like you had to spend hours getting ready 
for this ordeal. You may feel like ranting and raving about how the govern￾ment wastes too much of your tax money, or how the party in power is out to 
get you. Bite your tongue.
Believe it or not, most auditors are decent people just trying to do their jobs. 
They’re well aware that taxpayers don’t like seeing them. Don’t suck up, 
either — just relax and be yourself. Behave as you would around a boss you 
like — with respect and congeniality.
» Stick to the knitting. Your audit is for discussing only the sections of your tax 
return that are in question. The more you talk about other areas or things that 
you’re doing, the more likely the auditor is to probe into other items. Don’t 
bring documentation for parts of your return that aren’t being audited. 
Besides creating more work for yourself, you may be opening up a can of 
worms that doesn’t need to be opened. Should the auditor inquire about 
areas that aren’t covered by the audit notice, politely say that you’re not 
prepared to discuss those other issues and that another meeting should be 
scheduled.
» Don’t argue when you disagree. State your case. When the auditor wants 
to disallow a deduction or otherwise increase the taxes you owe and you 
disagree, state once why you don’t agree with the assessment. If the auditor 
won’t budge, don’t get into a knock-down, drag-out confrontation. The auditor 
may not want to lose face and is inclined to find additional tax money — that’s 
their job.
When necessary, you can plead your case with several people who work 
above your auditor. If this method fails and you still feel wronged, you can 
take your case to tax court.
» Don’t be intimidated. Most auditors are not tax geniuses. The work is 
stressful — being in a job where people dislike seeing you isn’t easy. Turnover 
is quite high. Thus, many auditors are fairly young, just-out-of-school types 
who majored in something like English, history, or sociology. They may know 
less about tax and financial matters than you do. The basic IRS tax boot camp 
that auditors go through doesn’t come close to covering all the technical 
details and nuances in the tax code. So you may not be at such a disadvan￾tage in your tax knowledge after all, especially if you work with a tax advisor 
(most tax advisors know more about the tax system than the average IRS 
auditor).3

Considering Important 
Investment Concepts
Making wise investments need not be complicated. However, many inves￾tors get bogged down in the morass of the thousands of investment 
choices out there and the often-conflicting perspectives on how to 
invest. This chapter helps you grasp the important “bigger picture” issues that 
can help you ensure that your investment plan meshes with your needs and the 
realities of the investment marketplace.
Establishing Your Goals
Before you select a specific investment, first determine your investment needs 
and goals. Why are you saving money — what are you going to use it for? You 
don’t need to earmark every dollar, but you should set some major objectives or 
goals. Establishing goals is important because the expected use of the money 
helps you determine how long to invest it. And that, in turn, helps you determine 
which investments to choose.
The risk level of your investments should factor in your time frame and your com￾fort level. Investing in high-risk vehicles doesn’t make sense if you’ll need to 
spend the funds within the next few years or if you’ll have to spend all your profits

on stress-induced medical bills! For example, suppose you’ve been accumulating 
money for a down payment on a home you want to buy in a few years. You can’t 
afford much risk with that money because you’re going to need it sooner rather 
than later. Putting that money in the stock market, then, is foolish. As I discuss 
later in this chapter, the stock market can drop a lot in a year or over several years. 
So stocks are probably too risky a place to invest money you plan to use soon.
Perhaps you’re saving toward a longer-term goal, such as retirement, that’s 20 or 
30 years away. In this case, you’re in a position to make riskier investments, 
because your holdings have more time to bounce back from temporary losses or 
setbacks. You may want to consider investing in growth investments, such as 
stocks, within a retirement account that you leave alone for 20 years or longer. (If 
stocks aren’t to your liking, I discuss other growth investments throughout 
Part 3.) You can tolerate year-to-year volatility in the market — you have time on 
your side. If you haven’t yet done so, take a tour through Chapter 4, which helps 
you contemplate and set your financial goals.
Understanding the Primary Investments
For a moment, forget all the buzzwords, jargon, and product names you’ve heard 
tossed around in the investment world — in many cases, they obscure, sometimes 
intentionally, what an investment really is and hide the hefty fees and 
commissions.
Imagine a world with only two investment flavors  — think of chocolate and 
vanilla ice cream (or low-fat frozen yogurt for you health-minded folks). The 
investment world is really just as simple. You have only two major investment 
choices: You can be a lender or an owner.
Looking at lending investments
You’re a lender when you invest your money in a bank certificate of deposit (CD), 
a Treasury bill, or a bond issued by a company like Home Depot, for example. In 
each case, you lend your money to an organization — a bank, the federal govern￾ment, or Home Depot. You’re paid an agreed-upon rate of interest for lending 
your money. The organization also promises to have your original investment (the 
principal) returned to you on a specific date.
Getting paid all the interest in addition to your original investment (as promised) 
is the best that can happen with a lending investment. Given that the investment 
landscape is littered with carcasses of failed investments, this is not a result to 
take for granted!CHAPTER 9 Considering Important Investment Concepts 163
The worst that can happen with a lending investment is that you don’t get every￾thing you were promised. Promises can be broken under extenuating circum￾stances. When a company goes bankrupt, for example, you can lose all or part of 
your original investment.
Another risk associated with lending investments is that even if you get what you 
were promised, the ravages of inflation may reduce the purchasing power of your 
money. Higher inflation returned for the first time in a long time in the aftermath 
of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated spending and shutdowns. Also, the 
value of a bond may drop below what you paid for it if interest rates rise or the 
quality/risk of the issuing company declines.
Table 9-1 shows the reduction in the purchasing power of your money at varying 
rates of inflation after just ten years.
Some investors make the common mistake of thinking that they’re diversifying 
their long-term investment money by buying several bonds, some CDs, and an 
annuity. The problem, however, is that all these investments pay a relatively low 
fixed rate of return that’s exposed to the vagaries of inflation.
A final drawback to lending investments is that you don’t share in the success of 
the organization to which you lend your money. If the company doubles or triples 
in size and profits, your principal and interest rate don’t double or triple in size 
along with it; they stay the same. Of course, such success does ensure that you’ll 
get your promised interest and principal.
Exploring ownership investments
You’re an owner when you invest your money in an asset, such as a company or 
real estate, that can generate earnings or profits. Suppose that you own 100 shares 
of Verizon Communications stock. With billions of shares of stock outstanding, 
Verizon is a mighty big company — your 100 shares represent a tiny piece of it. 
TABLE 9-1	 Reduction in Purchasing Power Due to Inflation
Inflation Rate Reduction in Purchasing Power after Ten Years
2 percent –18 percent
4 percent –32 percent
6 percent –44 percent
8 percent –54 percent
10 percent –61 percent164 PART 3 Building Wealth through Investing
What do you get for your small slice of Verizon? As a stockholder, although you 
don’t get free calling, you do share in the profits of the company in the form of 
annual dividends and an increase (you hope) in the stock price if the company 
grows and becomes more profitable. Of course, you receive these benefits if things 
are going well. If Verizon’s business declines, your stock may be worth less (or 
even worthless!).
Real estate is another one of my favorite financially rewarding and time-honored 
ownership investments. Real estate can produce profits when it’s rented out for 
more than the expense of owning the property or sold at a price higher than what 
you paid for it. I know numerous successful real-estate investors (myself included) 
who have earned excellent long-term profits.
The value of real estate depends not only on the particulars of the individual prop￾erty but also on the health and performance of the local economy. When compa￾nies in the community are growing and more jobs are being produced at higher 
wages, real estate often does well. When local employers are laying people off and 
excess housing is sitting vacant because of previous overbuilding, rent and prop￾erty values fall, as they did in the late 2000s.
Finally, many Americans have also built substantial wealth through small busi￾ness. According to Forbes magazine, more of the United States’ (and the world’s) 
wealthiest individuals have built their wealth through their stake in small busi￾nesses (that became bigger) than through any other vehicle. Small business is the 
engine that drives much of the country’s economic growth. You can participate in 
small business in a variety of ways. You can start your own business, buy and 
operate an existing business, or simply invest in promising small businesses. In 
the chapters ahead, I explain each of these major investment types in detail.
Shunning Gambling and Get Rich 
Quick Vehicles
Although investing is often risky, it’s not gambling. Gambling is putting your 
money into schemes that are sure to lose you money over time. That’s not to say 
that everyone loses or that you lose every time you gamble. However, the deck is 
stacked against you. The house wins most of the time.
Casinos and lotteries are set up to pay out 50 to 60 cents on the dollar. The rest 
goes to profits and covering those business’s operating costs. Sure, you may win 
a bet or two, but in the long run, you’re almost guaranteed to lose about 40 to 
50 percent of what you bet. Would you put your money in an “investment” where 
your expected return over the long term was negative 40 percent?CHAPTER 9 Considering Important Investment Concepts 165
Forsaking futures, options, 
and other derivatives
Futures, options, and commodity futures are derivatives, or financial investments 
whose value is derived from the performance of another security, such as a stock 
or bond.
Suppose you’re solicited by the firm Fleecem, Cheatem, and Leavem to buy heat￾ing oil futures because of conflicts in the Middle East and the upcoming rise in 
heating oil usage due to the cold-weather months. You’re impressed by the 
smooth-talking vice president. Their logic makes sense, and they spend a lot of 
time with little ol’ you, so you send them $10,000.
Buying futures isn’t much different from blowing $10,000 at the craps tables in 
Las Vegas. Futures prices depend on short-term, highly volatile price movements. 
As with gambling, you occasionally win when the market moves the right way at 
the right time. But in the long run, you’re gonna lose. In fact, you can lose it all.
Options are as risky as futures. With options, you’re betting on the short-term 
movements of a specific security, which is gambling — not investing. This was 
fashionable to do among some people who used government distributed COVID-19 
stimulus checks to try to hit it big.
Honest brokers who help their clients invest in stocks, bonds, and mutual funds 
tell them the truth about commodities, futures, and options. A former broker I 
know who worked for various major brokerage firms for 12 years told me, “I had 
just one client who made money in options, futures, or commodities, but the only 
reason he came out ahead was because he was forced to pull money out to close on 
a home purchase just when he happened to be ahead. The commissions were great 
for me, but there’s no way a customer will make money in them.” Remember 
these words if you’re tempted to gamble with futures, options, and the like.
Futures and options are not always used for speculation and gambling. Some 
sophisticated professional investors use them to hedge, or actually reduce the risk 
of, their broad investment holdings. When futures and options are used in this 
fashion, things don’t often work out the way that the pros hoped. You, the indi￾vidual investor, should steer clear of futures and options.
Ditching day trading
Day trading — which is the rapid buying and selling of securities online — is an 
equally foolish vehicle for individual investors. This is speculation and gambling, 
not investing. And even if you’re using a broker who offers “free” trading, every 
time you buy and sell, you’re effectively paying a fee given the inevitable spread 
between the buy and sell price for a given security.166 PART 3 Building Wealth through Investing
Frequent trading also increases your tax bill as profits realized over short time 
periods are taxed at your highest possible tax rate (see Chapter 8). You can cer￾tainly make some profits when day trading. However, over an extended period of 
time, you’ll inevitably underperform the broad market averages. In those rare 
instances where you may do a little better than the market averages, the profits 
are rarely worth the time and personal sacrifices that you, your family, and your 
friendships endure.
Sidestepping “get rich quick” schemes
If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. In today’s high-tech world, people 
are bombarded in all directions — mailers, social media ads, radio and podcast 
commercials, and on and on — on ways to make money, fast. I’m here to tell you 
that getting rich quick is more of a pipedream than an investment strategy. 
Investing for the long term is the way to grow your money.
In the next section, I explain how the best wealth-building investments histori￾cally have returned an average of about 8 to 9 percent per year. You should keep 
that number in mind as you evaluate seemingly attractive alternatives with the 
belief that you will double or triple your investment in a year or less. That’s what 
lured so many inexperienced and naïve investors into cryptocurrencies in recent 
years. Websites and social media recounted tales of folks becoming rich over short 
time periods after buying into a particular cryptocurrency like Bitcoin and Ethe￾reum that zoomed skyward.
New cryptocurrencies sprung up like weeds during a hot summer spell and soon 
there were more than 23,000 of them! Needless to say, nearly all of these ended up 
being poor investments. As with past get-rich-quick schemes, investors kept 
buying into new offerings in the hopes of striking it rich. For more about crypto￾currencies, please see Chapter 10.
Understanding Investment Returns
The previous sections describe the difference between ownership and lending 
investments, and they help you distinguish gambling and speculation from 
investing. “That’s all well and good,” you say, “but how do I choose which type of 
investments to put my money into? How much can I make, and what are the 
risks?”
Good questions. I’ll start with the returns you might make. I say “might” because 
this requires looking at history, and history is a record of the past. Using history CHAPTER 9 Considering Important Investment Concepts 167
to predict the future — especially the near future — is dangerous. History may 
repeat itself, but not always in exactly the same fashion and not necessarily when 
you expect it to.
During this past century, ownership investments such as stocks and investment 
real estate returned around 9 percent per year, handily beating lending invest￾ments such as bonds (around 5 percent) and savings accounts (roughly 4 percent) 
in the investment performance race. Inflation has averaged 3 percent per year.
If you already know that the stock market can be risky, you may be wondering 
why investing in stocks is worth the anxiety and potential losses. Why bother for 
a few extra percent per year? Well, over many years, a few extra percent per year 
can really magnify the growth of your money (see Table 9-2). The more years you 
have to invest, the greater the difference a few percent makes in your returns.
Investing is not a spectator sport. You can’t earn good returns on stocks and real 
estate if you keep your money in cash on the sidelines. If you invest in growth 
investments such as stocks and real estate, don’t chase one new investment after 
another trying to beat the market average returns. The biggest value comes from 
being in the market, not from beating it.
Sizing Investment Risks
Many investors have a simplistic understanding of what risk means and how to 
apply it to their investment decisions. For example, when compared to the yo-yo 
motions of the stock market, a bank savings account may seem like a less risky 
place to put your money. Over the long term, however, the stock market usually 
beats the rate of inflation, while the interest rate on a savings account does not, 
especially when factoring in taxes. Thus, if you’re saving your money for a

long-term goal like retirement, a savings account can be a “riskier” place to put 
your money if you’re concerned about the future purchasing power of your 
investments.
Before you invest, ask yourself these questions:
» What am I saving and investing this money for? In other words, 
what’s my goal?
» What is my timeline for this investment? When will I likely use this money?
» What is the historical volatility of the investment I’m considering? Does 
that suit my comfort level and timeline for this investment?
After you answer these questions, you’ll have a better understanding of risk and 
you’ll be able to match your savings goals to their most appropriate investment 
vehicles. In Chapter  4, I help you consider your savings goals and timeline. I 
address investment risk and returns in the sections that follow.
Comparing the risks of stocks and bonds
Given the relatively higher historic returns I mention for ownership investments 
in the previous section, some people think they should put all their money in 
stocks and real estate. So what’s the catch?
The risk with ownership investments is the short-term fluctuations in their value. 
During the last century, stocks declined, on average, by more than 10 percent once 
every five years. Drops in stock prices of more than 20 percent occurred, on aver￾age, once every ten years. Real-estate prices suffer similar periodic setbacks.
Therefore, in order to earn those generous long-term returns from ownership 
investments like stocks and real estate, you must be willing to tolerate volatility. 
You absolutely should not put all your money in the stock or real-estate market. 
Investing your emergency money or money you expect to use within the next five 
years in such volatile investments is not a good idea.
The shorter the time period that you have for holding your money in an invest￾ment, the less likely growth-oriented investments like stocks are to beat out 
lending-type investments like bonds. Table 9-3 illustrates the historical relation￾ship between stock and bond returns based on number of years held.CHAPTER 9 Considering Important Investment Concepts 169
Some types of bonds have higher yields than others, but the risk-reward relation￾ship remains intact (see Chapter 10 for more on bonds). A bond generally pays you 
a higher rate of interest when it has a
» Lower credit rating: To compensate for the higher risk of default and the 
higher likelihood of losing your investment
» Longer-term maturity: To compensate for the risk that you’ll be unhappy 
with the bond’s set interest rate if the market level of interest rates moves up
Focusing on the risks you can control
I always asked students in my personal finance class that I used to teach at the 
University of California to write down what they’d like to learn. Here’s what one 
student had to say: “I want to learn what to invest my money in now, as the stock 
market is overvalued and interest rates are about to go up, so bonds are dicey and 
banks give lousy interest — HELP!”
This student recognized the risk of price fluctuations in investments, but also 
seemed to believe, like too many people, that you can predict what’s going to hap￾pen. How did the student know that the stock market was overvalued, and why 
hadn’t the rest of the world figured it out? How did they know that interest rates 
were about to go up, and why hadn’t the rest of the world figured that out, either?
When you invest in stocks and other growth-oriented investments, you must 
accept the volatility of these investments. That said, you can take several actions, 
which I discuss in this chapter and the remainder of Part 3, to greatly reduce your 
risk when investing in these higher-potential-return investments. Invest the 
money that you have earmarked for the longer term in these vehicles. Minimize 
the risk of these investments through diversification. Don’t buy just one or two 
stocks; buy a number of stocks. Later in this chapter, I discuss what you need to 
know about diversification.

Discovering low-risk, high-return 
investments
Despite what professors teach in the nation’s leading business and finance 
graduate-school programs, low-risk investments that almost certainly lead to 
high returns are available. I can think of at least four such investments:
» Paying off consumer debt: If you’re paying 10-, 14-, or 18-percent interest or 
more on an outstanding credit-card or other consumer loan, pay it off before 
investing. To get a comparable return through other investment vehicles 
(after the government takes its share of your profits), you’d have to start a 
new career as a loan shark. If, between federal and state taxes, you’re in a 
30-percent combined income tax bracket and you’re paying 14-percent 
interest on consumer debt, you need to annually earn a whopping pre-tax 
return of 20 percent on your investments to justify not paying off such debt. 
Good luck with that!
When your only source of funds for paying off debt is a small emergency 
reserve equal to a few months’ living expenses, paying off your debt may 
involve some risk. Tap into your emergency reserves only if you have a backup 
source — for example, the ability to borrow from a willing family member or 
against a retirement account balance.
» Investing in your health: Eat healthy, exercise, and relax.
» Investing in friends and family: Invest time and effort in improving your 
relationships with loved ones.
» Investing in personal and career development: Pick up a new hobby or 
reinvigorate your interest in an old one, improve your communication skills, 
and read widely. Take an adult education course or go back to school for 
specific training. Your investment will most likely lead to greater happiness 
and perhaps even higher paychecks.
Diversifying Your Investments
Diversification is one of the most powerful investment concepts. It refers to saving 
your eggs (or investments) in different baskets. Diversification requires you to 
place your money in different investments with returns that are not completely 
correlated, which is a fancy way of saying that when some of your investments are 
down in value, odds are that others are up in value.CHAPTER 9 Considering Important Investment Concepts 171
To decrease the chances of all your investments getting clobbered at the same 
time, you must put your money in different types of investments, such as bonds, 
stocks, real estate, and small business. (I cover all these investments and more in 
Chapter 10.) You can further diversify your investments by investing in domestic 
as well as international markets.
Within a given class of investments, such as stocks, investing in different types of 
that class (such as different types of stocks) that perform well under various eco￾nomic conditions is important. For this reason, mutual funds, which are diversified 
portfolios of securities such as stocks or bonds, are a highly useful investment 
vehicle, as are exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which are like mutual funds but 
trade on a stock exchange. When you buy into a mutual fund, your money is pooled 
with the money of many others and invested in a vast array of stocks or bonds.
You can look at the benefits of diversification in two ways:
» Diversification reduces the volatility in the value of your whole portfolio. In 
other words, your portfolio can achieve the same rate of return that a single 
investment can provide with less fluctuation in value.
» Diversification allows you to obtain a higher rate of return for a given level of risk.
Keep in mind that no one, no matter whom they work for or what credentials they 
have, can guarantee returns on an investment. You can do good research and get 
lucky, but no one is free from the risk of losing money. Diversification allows you 
to hedge the risk of your investments. See Figures 9-1, 9-2, and 9-3 to get an idea 
of how diversifying can reduce your risk. (The figures in these charts are adjusted 
for inflation.) Notice that different investments did better during different eco￾nomic environments and time periods.
Recent decades have shown fluctuations as well. In the 1990s, stocks appreciated 
greatly, and bonds did pretty well, too, while gold and silver did poorly. In the 
2000s, stocks treaded water (except those in emerging markets) while bonds and 
precious metals did well. Since the end of the severe recession in 2009, stocks 
have soared while bonds have lagged. Because the future can’t be predicted, diver￾sifying your money into different investments is safer.
Spreading the wealth: Asset allocation
Asset allocation refers to how you spread your investing dollars among different 
investment choices (stocks, bonds, money-market accounts, and so on). Before 
you can intelligently decide how to allocate your assets, you need to ponder a 
number of issues, including your present financial situation, your goals and pri￾orities, and the pros and cons of various investment alternatives.172 PART 3 Building Wealth through Investing
Although stocks and real estate offer attractive long-term returns, they can some￾times suffer significant declines. Thus, these investments are not suitable for 
money that you think you may want or need to use within, say, the next five years.
Money-market and shorter-term bond investments are good places to keep 
money that you expect to use soon. Everyone should have a reserve of money — 
about three to six months’ worth of living expenses in a money-market fund — 
that’s accessible in an emergency. Shorter-term bonds or bond mutual funds can 
serve as a higher-yielding, secondary emergency cushion. (Refer to Chapter 4 for 
more on emergency reserves.)

Bonds can also be useful for some longer-term investing for diversification pur￾poses. For example, when investing for retirement, placing a portion of your 
money in bonds helps buffer stock market declines. The remaining chapters in 
Part 3 detail your various investment options and explain how to select those that 
best meet your needs.
Allocating money for the long term
Investing money for retirement is a classic long-term goal that most people have. 
Your current age and the number of years until you expect to need the money and 
retire are the biggest factors to consider when allocating money for long-term 
purposes. The younger you are and the more years you have before retirement, the 
more comfortable you can afford to be with growth-oriented (and more volatile) 
investments, such as stocks and investment real estate.
One useful guideline for dividing or allocating your money between longer-term￾oriented growth investments, such as stocks, and more-conservative lending 
investments, such as bonds, is to subtract your age from 110 (or 120 if you want to 
be aggressive; 100 to be more conservative) and invest the resulting percentage in 
stocks. You then invest the remaining amount in bonds.
For example, if you’re 30 years old, you invest from 70 (100 – 30) to 90 (120 – 30) 
percent in stocks. You invest the remaining 10 to 30 percent in bonds.
Table 9-4 lists some guidelines for allocating long-term money based on your age 
and the level of risk you desire.
FIGURE 9-3:
Value of $10,000 
invested from 
1972 to 1980.

For example, if you’re the conservative sort who doesn’t like a lot of risk but rec￾ognizes the value of striving for some growth and making your money work 
harder, you’re a middle-of-the-road type. Using Table 9-4, if you’re 40 years old, 
you may consider putting 30 percent (40 – 10) in bonds and 70 percent (110 – 40) 
in stocks.
In most employer retirement plans, mutual funds are the typical investment vehi￾cle. If your employer’s retirement plan includes more than one stock mutual fund 
as an option, you may want to try discerning which options are best by using the 
criteria I discuss in Chapter 11. In the event that all your retirement plan’s stock 
fund options are good, you can simply divide your stock allocation among the 
choices.
When one or more of the choices is an international stock fund, consider allocat￾ing a percentage of your stock fund money to overseas investments: at least 
20 percent for play-it-safe investors, 25 to 35 percent for middle-of-the-road 
investors, and as much as 35 to 50 percent for aggressive investors.
If the 40-year-old middle-of-the-roader from the previous example is investing 
70 percent in stocks, about 25 to 35 percent of the stock fund investments (which 
works out to be about 18 to 24 percent of the total) can be invested in international 
stock funds.
In generations past, most employees haven’t had to make their own investing 
decisions with retirement money. That’s because pension plans, in which the 
company directs the investments, were more common in previous years. It’s 
interesting to note that in a typical pension plan, companies choose to allocate the 
majority of money to stocks (about 60 percent), with a bit less placed in bonds 
(about 35 percent) and other investments. For more information on investing in 
retirement accounts, see Chapter 12.
Sticking with your allocations: Don’t trade
Your goals and desire to take risk should drive the allocation of your investment 
dollars. As you get older, gradually scaling back on the riskiness (and therefore 
growth potential and volatility) of your portfolio generally makes sense.
TABLE 9-4	 Allocating Long-Term Money
Your Investment Attitude Bond Allocation (%) Stock Allocation (%)
Play it safer = Age = 100 – age
Middle-of-the-road = Age – 10 = 110 – age
Aggressive = Age – 20 = 120 – ageCHAPTER 9 Considering Important Investment Concepts 175
Don’t tinker with your portfolio daily, weekly, monthly, or even annually. (Every 
two to three years or so, you may want to rebalance your holdings to get your mix 
to a desired asset allocation, as discussed in the preceding section.) Don’t engage 
in trading with the hopes of buying into a hot investment and selling your losers. 
Jumping onto a “winner” and dumping a “loser” may provide some short-term 
psychological comfort, but in the long term, such an investment strategy often 
produces below-average returns.
When an investment gets front-page coverage and everyone is talking about its 
stunning rise, it’s definitely time to take a reality check. The higher an invest￾ment’s price rises, the greater the danger that it’s overpriced. Its next move may 
be downward. Don’t follow the herd.
During the late 1990s, many technology (especially internet) stocks had spectac￾ular rises, thus attracting a lot of attention. However, the fact that the U.S. econ￾omy is increasingly becoming technology-based doesn’t mean that any price you 
pay for a technology stock is fine. Some investors who neglected to do basic 
research and bought into the attention-grabbing, high-flying technology stocks 
lost 80 percent or more of their investments in the early 2000s — ouch! The same 
pattern repeated itself in 2022 in the aftermath of the pandemic and the rapid 
price rise of numerous technology stocks that then got clobbered.
Conversely, when things look bleak (as when stocks in general suffered signifi￾cant losses in the early 2000s and then again in the late 2000s and early 2020), 
giving up hope is easy  — who wants to be associated with a loser? However, 
investors who forget about their overall asset allocation plan, panic, and sell after
a major decline miss out on a tremendous buying opportunity.
Many people like buying everything from clothing to cars to chicken on sale — yet 
whenever the stock market has a clearance sale, most investors stampede for the 
exits instead of snatching up great buys. Demonstrate your courage; again, don’t 
follow the herd.
Investing lump sums via 
dollar-cost averaging
When you have what is to you a large chunk of cash to invest — whether you 
received it from an accumulation of funds over the years, an inheritance, or a 
recent windfall from work you’ve done — you may have a problem deciding what 
to do with it. Many people, of course, would like to have your problem. (You’re not 
complaining, right?) You want to invest your money, but you’re a bit skittish — if 
not outright terrified — at the prospect of investing the lump of money all at once.176 PART 3 Building Wealth through Investing
If the money is residing in a savings or money-market account, you may feel like 
it’s wasting away. You want to put it to work! My first words of advice are “Don’t 
rush.” Nothing is wrong with earning a small return in a money-market account. 
(See Chapter 13 for my recommendations of the best money funds.) Remember 
that a money-market fund beats the heck out of rushing into an investment in 
which you may lose 20 percent or more. When I worked as a financial advisor, I 
sometimes got calls from people in a state of near panic. Typically, these folks had 
CDs coming due, and they felt that they needed to decide exactly where they 
wanted to invest the money in the 48 hours before the CD matured.
Take a deep breath. You have absolutely no reason to rush into an important deci￾sion. Tell your friendly banker that when the CD matures, you want to put the 
proceeds into the bank’s highest-yielding savings or money-market account. 
That way, your money continues to earn interest while you buy yourself some 
breathing room.
One approach to investing is called dollar-cost averaging (DCA). With DCA, you 
invest your money in equal chunks on a regular basis — such as once a month — 
into a diversified group of investments. For example, if you have $60,000 to 
invest, you can invest $2,500 per month until it’s all invested, which takes a cou￾ple of years. The money awaiting future investment isn’t lying fallow; you keep it 
in a money-market account so it can earn a bit of interest while waiting its turn.
The attraction of DCA is that it allows you to ease into riskier investments instead 
of jumping in all at once. If the price of the investment drops after some of your 
initial purchases, you can buy some later at a lower price. If you dump your entire 
chunk of money into an investment all at once and then it drops like a stone, 
you’ll be kicking yourself for not waiting.
The flip side of DCA is that when your investment of choice appreciates in value, 
you may wish that you had invested your money faster. Another drawback of DCA 
is that you may get cold feet as you continue to pour money into an investment 
that’s dropping in value.
DCA can also cause headaches with your taxes when the time comes to sell invest￾ments held outside retirement accounts. When you buy an investment at many 
different times and prices, the accounting becomes muddied as you sell blocks of 
the investment.
DCA is most valuable when the money you want to invest represents a large por￾tion of your total assets and you can stick to a schedule. Make DCA automatic so 
you’re less likely to abandon plans if the investment falls after your initial pur￾chases. The investment firms I recommend in the next few chapters provide auto￾matic exchange services (investing a set amount at regular intervals, such as 
monthly, drafting the money from a bank account or money fund).CHAPTER 9 Considering Important Investment Concepts 177
Acknowledging Differences among 
Investment Firms
Thousands of firms sell investments and manage money. Banks, mutual-fund 
companies, securities brokerage firms, and even insurance companies all vie for 
your dollars.
Just to make matters more complicated, each industry plays in the others’ back￾yards. You can find mutual-fund companies that offer securities brokerage, insur￾ance firms that are in the mutual-fund business, and mutual-fund companies 
that offer bank-like accounts and services. You may benefit from this competition 
and one-stop shopping convenience. On the other hand, some firms are relative 
novices at particular businesses and count on folks shopping by brand-name 
recognition.
Focusing on the best firms
Make sure you do business with a firm that
» Offers the best value investments in comparison to its competitors:
Value is the combination of performance (including service) and cost. Given 
the level of risk that you’re comfortable with, you want investments that offer 
higher rates of return, but you don’t want to have to pay a small fortune for 
them. Commissions, management fees, maintenance fees, and other charges 
can turn a high-performance investment into a mediocre or poor one.
» Employs representatives who don’t have an inherent self-interest in 
steering you into a particular type of investment: This criterion has 
nothing to do with whether an investment firm hires polite, well-educated, 
or well-dressed people. The most important factor is the way the company 
compensates its employees. If the investment firm’s personnel are paid on 
commission, be wary. Give preference to investing firms that don’t tempt their 
employees to push one investment over another in order to generate more 
fees (such as some discount brokers, as discussed in Chapter 12).
The following two types of investment firms I highlight and recommend are the 
best no-load mutual-fund companies and discount brokers. Some firms play in 
both of these spaces whereas others only do one of these activities.178 PART 3 Building Wealth through Investing
No-load (commission-free) mutual-fund 
companies
Mutual funds are an ideal investment vehicle for most investors. No-load mutual￾fund companies are firms through which you can invest in mutual funds without 
paying sales commissions. In other words, every dollar you invest goes to work in 
the mutual funds you choose — nothing is siphoned off to pay sales commissions. 
Many of these firms also offer exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which are similar 
to mutual funds in many ways, are (in the best cases) lower cost, and trade on a 
major stock exchange and thus can be bought and sold during the trading day. See 
Chapter 11 for details on investing in mutual funds and ETFs.
Discount brokers
In one of the most beneficial changes for investors in the past century, the Securi￾ties and Exchange Commission (SEC) deregulated the retail brokerage industry on 
May 1, 1975. Prior to this date, investors were charged fixed commissions when 
they bought or sold stocks, bonds, and other securities. In other words, no matter 
which brokerage firm an investor did business with, the cost of the firm’s services 
was set (and the level of commissions was high). After the 1975 deregulation, 
brokerage firms could charge people whatever their little hearts desired.
Competition inevitably resulted in more and better choices. Many new brokerage 
firms (that didn’t do business the old way) opened. They were dubbed discount 
brokers because the fees they charged customers were substantially lower than 
what brokers charged under the old fixed-fee system.
Even more important than saving customers money, discount brokers established 
a vastly improved compensation system that greatly reduced conflicts of interest. 
Discount brokers generally pay the salaries of their brokers. The term discount 
broker is actually not an enlightening one. Certainly, this new breed of brokerage 
firm saves you lots of money when you invest; you can easily save 50 to 80 percent 
through the major discount brokers. But these firms’ investments are not “on 
sale” or “second-rate.” Discount brokers are simply brokers without major con￾flicts of interest. Of course, like any other for-profit enterprise, they’re in busi￾ness to make money, but they’re much less likely to steer you in the wrong 
direction for their own benefit.
Be wary of discount brokers selling load mutual funds. (I discuss the reasons you 
should shun these brokers in Chapter 11.)CHAPTER 9 Considering Important Investment Concepts 179
A CLOSER LOOK AT ROBINHOOD 
“FREE STOCK TRADING” APP
Thanks to deregulation decades ago, and now technology, brokerage trading fees have 
dropped dramatically. Numerous leading investment companies that I highlight in this 
book offer broad menus of the best investments (for example, mutual funds, exchange￾traded funds, stocks, bonds, and so on). I explain in my books how to buy many of the 
funds without any trading fees at all, and when fees are levied, they’re typically 
quite low.
But that hasn’t stopped some folks from trying to offer even better deals. Hence, the 
rise of some brokerage firms claiming “free” trading. Of course, there is a catch — a 
brokerage firm can’t possibly exist, survive, and continue to stay in business if it doesn’t 
charge any fees at all for any of its services!
One such company offering “free stock trading” — Robinhood — had many catches 
when I researched what it offers:
• It only exists as an app so you can’t access the company through a traditional desk￾top (or laptop) computer or through a web-based version.
• If you need customer service or help resolving a problem on your account, you 
have limited access to phone assistance and only during normal business hours. 
After hours, including on weekends, you’re stuck using email.
• The app doesn’t offer mutual funds.
• A monthly paper statement of your account will cost you $2.
• Should you decide to close your account and have it transferred to another broker, 
Robinhood will whack you $100 for the privilege of leaving.
A number of major brokerage firms have eliminated trading fees on stock and 
exchange-traded funds. In recent years, “free” online brokerage trades on stocks and 
ETFs were announced by Charles Schwab, E-Trade, Fidelity, Interactive Brokers, T. Rowe 
Price, and Vanguard. These changes have further reduced the attractiveness of firms 
like Robinhood, given the other high fees and sub-par terms offered on their accounts, 
services, and investments to make up for their free brokerage trades. Investors should 
always consider and evaluate the entire package of services when deciding an invest￾ment firm through which to do business.
Remember that there are no free lunches in the investment world, and you should be 
wary of apps claiming their free investment brokerage services. In reality, such compa￾nies charge fees for the vast majority of what services they do provide — they simply 
lure you in by offering a select service or two for “free.”180 PART 3 Building Wealth through Investing
Places to consider avoiding
The worst places to invest are those that charge you a lot, have mediocre- or 
poor-performing investments, and have major conflicts of interest. The prime 
conflict of interest arises when investment firms pay their brokers’ commissions 
on the basis of what and how much they sell. The result: The investment firms sell 
lots of stuff that pays fat commissions, and they churn, or cause a rapid turnover 
of, your account. (Because each transaction has a fee, the more you buy and sell, 
the more money they make.)
Some folks who call themselves financial planners or financial consultants work on 
commission. In addition to working at the bigger brokerage firms, many of them 
belong to so-called broker-dealer networks, which provide back-office support and 
investment products to sell. When a person claiming to be a financial planner or 
advisor is part of a broker-dealer network, odds are quite high that you’re dealing 
with an investment salesperson. See Chapter  19 for more background on the 
financial-planning industry and questions to ask an advisor you’re thinking about 
hiring.
Commissions and their impact 
on human behavior
Investment products bring in widely varying commissions. The products that 
bring in the highest commissions tend to be the ones that money-hungry brokers 
push the hardest.
Table 9-5 lists the commissions that you pay — and that come out of your invest￾ment dollars — when you work with brokers, financial consultants, and financial 
planners who work on commission.
TABLE 9-5	 Investment Sales Commissions

Besides the fact that you can never be sure that you’re getting an unbiased recom￾mendation from a salesperson working on commission, you’re wasting money 
unnecessarily. The best investments can be bought on a no-load (commission￾free) basis.
When you’re unsure about an investment product that’s being pitched to you (and 
even when you are sure), ask for the prospectus. In the first few pages, check out 
whether the investment includes a commission (also known as a load). Although 
salespeople can hide behind obscure titles such as vice president or financial con￾sultant, a prospectus must detail whether the investment carries a commission.
Investment salespeople’s conflicts of interest
Financial consultants (also known as stockbrokers), financial planners, and oth￾ers who sell investment products can have enormous conflicts of interest when 
recommending strategies and specific investment products. Commissions and 
other financial incentives can’t help but skew the advice of even the most earnest 
and otherwise well-intentioned salespeople.
Numerous conflicts of interest can damage your investment portfolio. The follow￾ing are the most common conflicts to watch out for:
» Pushing higher-commission products: As I discuss earlier in this chapter, 
commissions on investment products vary tremendously. Products like 
limited partnerships, commodities, options, and futures are at the worst end 
of the spectrum for you (and the best end of the spectrum for a salesperson). 
Investments such as no-load mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, and 
Treasury bills that are 100-percent commission-free are at the best end of 
the spectrum for you (and, therefore, the worst end of the spectrum for a 
salesperson).
VERIFYING YOUR BROKER
To check out your broker, try the following two methods:
• Head to brokercheck.finra.org/. BrokerCheck provides investment advisor 
information to help you make informed choices. You can find out whether the 
person or firm is registered and if any regulatory actions or complaints have been 
filed against them.
• Contact your state security regulators at www.nasaa.org/contact-your￾regulator/, to do additional research on brokers and investment advisors.182 PART 3 Building Wealth through Investing
Surprisingly, commission-based brokers and financial planners don’t have to 
give you the prospectus (where commissions are detailed) before you buy a 
financial product that carries commissions (as with a load mutual fund). In 
contrast, commission-free investment companies, such as no-load mutual￾fund companies, must send a prospectus before taking a mutual-fund order. 
(Commission-based investment salespeople should also be required to 
provide a prospectus and disclose any commissions up front and in writing 
before making a sale.)
» Recommending active trading: Investment salespeople often advise you to 
trade frequently into and out of different securities. They usually base their 
advice on current news events or an analyst’s comments on the security. 
Sometimes these moves are valid, but more often they’re not. In extreme 
cases, brokers trade on a monthly basis. By the end of the year, they’ve 
churned through your entire portfolio. Needless to say, all these transactions 
cost you big money in trading fees.
Diversified mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (see Chapter 11) make 
more sense for most people. You can invest in funds free of sales commissions. 
Besides saving money on commissions, you earn better long-term returns by 
having an expert money manager work for you.
» Failing to recommend investing through retirement plans: If you’re not 
taking advantage of retirement savings plans (see Chapter 12), you may 
be missing out on valuable tax benefits. The initial contributions to most 
retirement plans are tax-deductible, and your money compounds without 
taxation over the years. An investment salesperson is not likely to recommend 
that you contribute to your employer’s retirement plan — a 401(k) for example. 
Such contributions cut into the money you have available to invest with the 
salesperson.
If you’re self-employed, salespeople are somewhat more likely to recommend 
that you fund a retirement plan because they can set up such plans for you. 
You’re better off setting up a retirement plan through a no-load mutual-fund 
company (see Chapters 11 and 12).
» Pushing high-fee products: Many of the brokerage firms that used to sell 
investment products only on commission moved into fee-based investment 
management. This change is an improvement for investors because it reduces 
some of the conflicts of interest caused by commissions.
On the other hand, these brokers charge relatively high fees, which are 
usually quoted as a percentage of assets under management (see the sidebar 
“Wrap (or managed) accounts” for more info).CHAPTER 9 Considering Important Investment Concepts 183
WHAT TO DO WHEN A BROKER 
FLEECES YOU
You can’t sue a broker just because you lose money on that person’s investment recom￾mendations. However, if you have been the victim of one of the following cardinal finan￾cial sins, you may have some legal recourse:
• Misrepresentation and omission: If you were told, for example, that a particular 
investment guaranteed returns of 15 percent per year and then the investment 
ended up plunging in value by 50 percent, you were misled. Misrepresentation can 
also be charged if you’re sold an investment with hefty commissions after you were 
originally told that it was commission-free.
• Unsuitable investments: Retirees who need access to their capital are often 
advised to invest in limited partnerships (or LPs, discussed in Chapter 10) for safe, 
high yields. The yields on most LPs end up being anything but safe. LP investors 
have also discovered how illiquid (or not readily converted into cash) their invest￾ments are — some can’t be liquidated for up to ten years or more.
• Churning: If your broker or financial planner is constantly trading your invest￾ments, odds are that their weekly commission check is benefiting at your expense.
• Rogue elephant salespeople: When your planner or broker buys or sells without 
your approval or ignores your request to make a change, you may be able to collect 
for losses caused by these actions.
Two major types of practitioners — securities lawyers and arbitration consultants — 
stand ready to help you recover your lost money. You can find securities lawyers by 
searching for “Attorneys — Securities” online or calling your local bar association for 
referrals. Arbitration consultants can be found in phone directories under “Arbitrators.” 
If you come up dry, try contacting business writers at a major newspaper in your area or 
at your favorite personal finance magazine. These sources may be able to give you 
names and numbers of folks they know.
Most lawyers and consultants work on a contingency-fee basis — they get a percentage 
(about 20 to 40 percent) of the amount collected. They also often ask for an up-front 
fee, ranging from several hundred to several thousand dollars, to help them cover their 
expenses and time. If they take your case and lose, they generally keep the up-front 
money. Securities lawyers are usually a more expensive option.
You may want to go to arbitration — in fact, you may have agreed to do just that (proba￾bly without realizing it) when you set up an account to work with the broker or planner. 
Arbitration is usually much quicker, cheaper, and easier than going to court. You can 
even choose to represent yourself. Both sides present their cases, typically to a panel of 
(continued)184 PART 3 Building Wealth through Investing
Valuing brokerage research
Brokerage firms and the brokers who work for them frequently argue that their 
research is better. With their insights and recommendations, they say, you’ll do 
better and “beat the market averages.”
Wall Street analysts are often overly optimistic when it comes to predicting cor￾porate profits. If analysts were simply inaccurate or bad estimators, you’d expect 
that they’d sometimes underestimate and, at other times, overestimate compa￾nies’ earnings. The discrepancy identifies yet another conflict of interest among 
many of the brokerage firms.
Brokerage firm analysts are reluctant to write a negative report about a company 
because the firms these analysts work for also solicit companies to issue new 
stock to the public. What better way to show businesses your potential for selling 
shares to the public at a high price than by showing how much you believe in cer￾tain companies and writing glowing reports about their future prospects?
Seeing Through Experts Who 
Predict the Future
Hoping that you can increase your investment returns by following the prognos￾tications of certain gurus is a common mistake that some investors make, espe￾cially during more trying and uncertain times. Many people may want to believe 
that some experts can predict the future of the investment world and keep them 
out of harm’s way. Trusting in gurus makes it easier to accept the risk you know 
you’re taking when trying to make your money grow. The sage predictions that 
you read in an investment newsletter or hear from an “expert” who is repeatedly 
quoted in financial publications make you feel protected — sort of like Linus and 
his security blanket.
three arbitrators. The arbitrators then make a decision that neither side can squabble 
over or appeal. If you decide to prepare for arbitration by yourself, the nonprofit 
American Arbitration Association can send you a package of background materials to 
help with your case. Contact the association’s headquarters (phone 800-778-7879; 
website www.adr.org). Their website also provides contact information organized by 
state for local branches.
(continued)CHAPTER 9 Considering Important Investment Concepts 185
Investment newsletter subscribers and guru followers would be better off buying 
a warm blanket instead — it has a lot more value and costs a whole lot less! No 
one can predict the future. If they could, they’d be so busy investing their own 
money and getting rich that they wouldn’t have the time and desire to share their 
secrets with you.
Investment newsletters
Many investment newsletters purport to time the markets, telling you the right 
time to get into and out of certain stocks or mutual funds (or the financial markets 
in general). Such an approach is doomed to failure in the long run. By failure, 
I mean that this approach won’t beat the tried-and-true strategy of buying and 
holding sound investments.
I see people paying hundreds of dollars annually to subscribe to all sorts of 
market-timing and stock-picking newsletters. One client of mine, an attorney, 
subscribed to several newsletters. When I asked him why, he said that their 
marketing materials claimed that if you followed their advice, you would make a 
20-percent-per-year return on your money. But in the four years that he’d 
followed their advice, he’d actually lost money, despite appreciating financial 
markets overall.
Before I ever consider subscribing to any investment newsletter, I examine 
its historic track record through avenues such as Hulbert Financial Digest.
hulbertratings.com/ The investment newsletter’s marketing materials typically 
hype the supposed returns that the publication’s recommendations have 
produced. Sadly, newsletters seem to be able to make lots of bogus claims without 
suffering the timely wrath of securities regulators.
Don’t get predictive advice from newsletters. If newsletter writers were so smart 
about the future of financial markets, they’d be making lots more money as money 
managers. The only types of investment newsletters and periodicals that you 
should consider subscribing to are those that offer research and information 
rather than predictions. I discuss the investment newsletters that fill the bill in 
the subsequent investment chapters. My website, www.erictyson.com, provides 
excerpts and updates from the best newsletters to which I subscribe and read. Also 
check out the “Guru Watch” section of my site in which I evaluate commonly 
quoted gurus.186 PART 3 Building Wealth through Investing
Investment gurus
Investment gurus come and go. Some of them get their 15 minutes of fame on the 
basis of one or two successful predictions that someone in the press remembers 
(and makes famous).
During the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009, all sorts of pundits were coming out 
of the woodwork claiming that they had predicted what was unfolding. Chief 
among them was an economist named Nouriel Roubini, whom few people had 
previously heard of. Many news services credited Roubini for supposedly predict￾ing the recession. My research uncovered that Roubini had indeed predicted a 
recession. The only problem, however, is that Roubini predicted a recession in 
2004, 2005, 2006, and 2007. So he was wrong for four long years in a row. In 
2008, his prediction of a recession finally came true.
When the stock market dropped sharply and the recession worsened in late 
2008, Roubini maintained a breakneck schedule with the news media. So he 
made even more predictions. For example, in late October 2008, Roubini pre￾dicted that “. . . hundreds of hedge funds are poised to fail as frantic investors 
rush to redeem their assets and force managers into a fire sale of assets. . . . 
We’ve reached a situation of sheer panic. Don’t be surprised if policymakers 
need to close down markets for a week or two in coming days.” This prediction 
sounded absurd to me at the time, which prompted me to write an article warn￾ing folks not to blindly follow Roubini’s advice. This prediction was indeed 
absurd and, of course, never happened. Roubini was wrong.
In January 2009, Roubini predicted oil prices would stay below $40 per barrel for 
all of 2009. It didn’t take long for that prediction to be proven wrong: Oil jumped 
above $50 per barrel by April and $70 by June.
When the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell to 6,500 in early 2009, Roubini said 
the market was likely to fall much farther, and he described any rally from that 
level as a “sucker’s rally.” Those people who panicked and sold in early 2009 
because of Roubini’s dire prediction were soon disappointed again as the stock 
market rebounded sharply.
The sad part about hyped articles with hyped predictions is that they cause some 
individual investors to panic and do the wrong thing — selling good assets like 
stocks at depressed prices. The media shouldn’t irresponsibly publicize hyped 
predictions, especially without clearly and accurately disclosing the predictor’s 
track record. Don’t fall victim to such hype.
Commentators and experts who publish predictive commentaries and newsletters 
and who are interviewed in the media can’t predict the future. Ignore the predic￾tions and speculations of self-proclaimed gurus and investment soothsayers. The 
few people who have a slight leg up on everyone else aren’t going to share their CHAPTER 9 Considering Important Investment Concepts 187
investment secrets — they’re too busy investing their own money! If you have to 
believe in something to offset your fears, believe in good information and proven 
investment managers. And don’t forget the value of optimism, faith, and hope — 
regardless of what or whom you believe in!
Leaving You with Some Final Advice
I cover a lot of ground in this chapter. In the remaining chapters in Part 3, I detail 
different investment choices and accounts and how to build a champion portfolio! 
Before you move on, here are several other issues to keep in mind as you make 
important investing choices:
» Don’t invest based on sales solicitations. Companies that advertise and 
solicit prospective customers aggressively offer some of the worst financial 
products with the highest fees. All companies have to do some promotion, 
but the companies with the best investment offerings don’t have to use the 
hard-sell approach; they get plenty of new business through the word-of￾mouth recommendations of satisfied customers.
» Don’t invest in what you don’t understand. When you don’t understand an 
investment, odds are good that it won’t be right for you. Slick-tongued brokers 
(who may call themselves financial consultants, advisors, or planners) who 
earn commissions based on what they sell can talk you into inappropriate 
investments. Before you invest in anything, you need to know its track record, 
its true costs, and how liquid (easily convertible to cash) it is.
» Minimize fees. Avoid investments that carry high sales commissions and 
management expenses (usually disclosed in a prospectus). Virtually all 
investments today can be purchased without a salesperson. Besides paying 
unnecessary commissions, the bigger danger with investing through a 
salesperson is that you may be directed to a path that’s not in your best 
interests. Management fees create a real drag on investment returns. 
Not surprisingly, higher-fee investments, on average, perform worse than 
alternatives with lower fees. High ongoing management fees often go toward 
lavish offices, glossy brochures, and skyscraper salaries, or toward propping 
up small, inefficient operations. Do you want your hard-earned dollars to 
support these types of businesses?
» Pay attention to tax consequences. Even if you never become an invest￾ment expert, you’re smart enough to know that the more money you pay in 
taxes, the less you have for investing and playing with. See Chapter 12 for info 
on how retirement accounts can help boost your investment returns. For 
investments outside retirement accounts, you need to match the types of 
investments to your tax situation (see Chapter 13).188 PART 3 Building Wealth through Investing
WRAP (OR MANAGED) ACCOUNTS
Wrap accounts (also called managed accounts) are popular among commission-based 
brokerage firms. These accounts go by a variety of names, but they’re all similar in that 
they charge a fixed percentage of the assets under management to invest your money 
through money managers.
Wrap accounts can be poor investments because their management expenses may be 
extraordinarily high — up to 2 percent per year (some even higher) of assets under 
management. Remember that in the long haul, stocks can return about 9 percent per 
year before taxes. So, if you’re paying 2 percent per year to have your money managed 
in stocks, 22 percent (2 percent divided by 9 percent) of your return (before taxes) is 
siphoned off. But don’t forget — because the government sure won’t — that you pay a 
good chunk of money in taxes on your 9-percent return as well. So, the 2-percent wrap 
fee can end up depleting a third or more of your after-tax profits!
The best no-load (commission-free) mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) 
offer investors access to the nation’s best investment managers for a fraction of the 
cost of wrap accounts. You can invest in dozens of top-performing funds for an annual 
expense of 1 percent per year or less. Some of the best fund companies offer excellent 
funds for a cost as low as 0.1 to 0.5 percent (see Chapter 11).
You may be told, in the marketing of wrap accounts, that you’re getting access to invest￾ment managers who don’t normally take money from small-fry investors like you. Not a 
single study shows that the performance of money managers has anything to do with 
the minimum account they handle. Besides, no-load funds hire many of the same 
managers who work at other money management firms. You also may be told that 
you’ll earn a higher rate of return, so the extra cost is worth it. “You could have earned 
18 to 25 percent per year,” they say, “had you invested with the ‘Star of Yesterday’ 
investment management company.” The key word here is had. History is history. 
Many of yesterday’s winners become tomorrow’s losers or mediocre performers.
You also need to remember that, unlike mutual funds and ETFs, wrap account perfor￾mance records may include unaudited marketing hype. Showing only the performance 
of selected accounts — those that performed the best — is the most common ploy.CHAPTER 10 Understanding Your Investment Choices 189

Understanding Your 
Investment Choices
Which vehicle you choose for your investment journey depends on where 
you’re hoping to go, how fast you want to get there, and what risks 
you’re willing to take. If you haven’t yet read Chapter 9, you may want 
to do so now. In it, I cover a number of investment concepts, such as the difference 
between lending and ownership investments, which will enhance your ability to 
choose among the common investment vehicles I discuss in this chapter.
Slow and Steady Investment: Bonds
Everyone should have some money in stable, safe investment vehicles, including 
money that you’ve earmarked for your near-term expenses, both expected and 
unexpected. Likewise, if you’re saving money for a home purchase within the next 
few years, you certainly don’t want to risk that money on the roller coaster of the 
stock market.
The investment option of bonds is appropriate for money you don’t want to put at 
great risk (bank accounts are discussed in Chapter 2).

estate, and small business

Precious metals, annuities, crypto, 
and collectibles190 PART 3 Building Wealth through Investing
When you invest in a bond, you effectively lend your money to an organization. 
When a bond is issued, it includes a specified maturity date at which time the 
principal will be repaid. Bonds are also issued at a particular interest rate, or 
what’s known as a coupon. This rate is fixed on most bonds. So, for example, if you 
buy a five-year, 6-percent bond issued by Home Depot, you’re lending your 
money to Home Depot for five years at an interest rate of 6 percent per year. (Bond 
interest is usually paid in two equal, semi-annual installments.)
The value of a bond generally moves opposite of the directional change in interest 
rates. For example, if you’re holding a bond issued at 6 percent and rates on sim￾ilar bonds increase to 8 percent, your 6-percent bond will decrease in value. (Why 
would anyone want to buy your bond at the price you paid if it yields just 6 percent 
and 8 percent can be obtained elsewhere?)
Some bonds are tied to variable interest rates. For example, you can buy bonds 
that are adjustable-rate mortgages, on which the interest rate can fluctuate. As an 
investor, you’re actually lending your money to a mortgage borrower  — 
indirectly, you’re the banker making a loan to someone buying a home.
Bonds differ from one another in the following major ways:
» The type of institution to which you’re lending your money: With munici￾pal bonds, you lend your money to the state or local government or agency; 
with Treasuries, you lend your money to the federal government; with GNMAs 
(Ginnie Maes), you lend your money to a mortgage holder (and the federal 
government backs the bond); and with corporate bonds, you lend your money 
to a corporation.
» The credit quality of the borrower to whom you lend your money: Credit 
quality refers to the probability that the borrower will pay you the interest and 
return your principal as agreed.
» The length of maturity of the bond: Short-term bonds mature within a few 
years, intermediate bonds within 3 to 10 years, and long-term bonds within 
10 to 30 years. Longer-term bonds generally pay higher yields but fluctuate 
more with changes in interest rates.
Bonds are rated by major credit-rating agencies for their safety, usually on a scale 
where AAA is the highest possible rating. For example, high-grade corporate 
bonds (AAA or AA) are considered the safest (that is, most likely to pay you back). 
Next in safety are general bonds (A or BBB), which are still safe but just a little less 
so. Junk bonds rated BB or B are actually not all that junky; they’re just lower in 
quality and have a slight (1 or 2 percent) probability of default over long periods of 
time. Junk bonds with even lower ratings — such as C or lower — carry higher 
default rates.CHAPTER 10 Understanding Your Investment Choices 191
Some bonds are callable, which means that the bond’s issuer can decide to pay you 
back earlier than the previously agreed-upon date. This event usually occurs when 
interest rates fall and the lender wants to issue new, lower-interest-rate bonds to 
replace the higher-rate, outstanding bonds. To compensate you for early repay￾ment, the lender typically gives you a small premium over what the bond is cur￾rently valued at.
Building Wealth with Ownership Vehicles
The three best legal ways to build wealth are to invest in stocks (both domestic 
and international), real estate, and small business. I’ve found this to be true from 
observing many clients and other investors and from my own personal experi￾ences. Check out the following sections for more details about these three options.
Selecting stocks
Stocks, which represent shares of ownership in a company, are the most common 
ownership investment vehicle. When companies go public, they issue shares of 
stock that people like you and me can purchase on the major stock exchanges, 
such as the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ (National Association of Secu￾rities Dealers Automated Quotations).
As the economy grows and companies grow with it, earning greater profits, stock 
prices (and dividend payouts on those stocks) generally follow suit. Stock prices 
and dividends don’t move in lockstep with earnings, but over the years, the rela￾tionship is pretty close. In fact, the price-earnings ratio — which measures the 
level of stock prices relative to (or divided by) company earnings — of U.S. stocks 
has averaged approximately 15 (although it has tended to be higher during periods 
of low inflation and interest rates). A price-earnings ratio of 15 simply means that 
stock prices per share, on average, are selling at about 15 times those companies’ 
earnings per share.
Companies that issue stock (called publicly held companies) include automobile 
manufacturers, computer software producers, fast-food and other restaurant 
chains, hotels, publishers, supermarkets, technology companies, wineries, and 
everything in between! (You can also invest overseas — see the “Investing inter￾nationally in stocks” section.) By contrast, some companies are privately held,
which means that they’ve elected to have senior management and a small number 
of affluent investors own their stock. Privately held companies’ stocks do not 
trade on a stock exchange, so folks like you and me can’t buy stock in such firms.192 PART 3 Building Wealth through Investing
Companies differ in what industry or line of business they’re in and also in size. 
In the financial press, you often hear companies referred to by their market capi￾talization, which is the value of their outstanding stock (the number of total shares 
multiplied by the market price per share). When describing the sizes of compa￾nies, Wall Street has done away with such practical adjectives as big and small and 
replaced them with expressions like large cap and small cap (where cap is short￾hand for market capitalization). Such is the language of financial geekiness.
Investing in the stock market involves occasional setbacks and difficult moments 
(just like raising children or going mountain climbing), but the overall journey is 
almost certainly worth the effort. Over the past two centuries, the U.S. stock mar￾ket has produced an annual average rate of return of about 9 percent. However, 
the market, as measured by the Dow Jones Industrial Average, fell more than 
20 percent during 16 different periods in the 20th century. On average, these peri￾ods of decline lasted less than two years. So if you can withstand a temporary 
setback over a few years, the stock market is a proven place to invest for long￾term growth.
You can invest in stocks by making your own selection of individual stocks or by 
letting mutual (or exchange-traded) funds do it for you.
Discovering the relative advantages of mutual 
funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs)
Efficiently managed mutual funds offer investors low-cost access to high-quality 
money managers. Mutual funds span the spectrum of risk and potential returns, 
from nonfluctuating money-market funds (which are similar to savings accounts) 
to bond funds (which generally pay higher yields than money-market funds but 
fluctuate with changes in interest rates) to stock funds (which offer the greatest 
potential for appreciation but also the greatest short-term volatility).
Investing in individual securities should be done only by those who really enjoy 
doing it and are aware of and willing to accept the risks in doing so. Mutual funds 
and exchange-traded funds (see the next section), if properly selected, are a low￾cost, quality way to hire professional money managers. Over the long haul, you’re 
highly unlikely to beat full-time professional managers who are investing in 
securities of the same type and at the same risk level. Chapter 11 is devoted to 
mutual funds and exchange-traded funds.
Understanding exchange-traded funds, hedge 
funds, and managed accounts
Mutual funds aren’t the only game in town when it comes to hiring a professional 
money manager. Three additional options you may hear about includeCHAPTER 10 Understanding Your Investment Choices 193
» Exchange-traded funds (ETFs): These funds are the most similar to mutual 
funds except that they trade on a major stock exchange and thus can be 
bought and sold during the trading day. The best ETFs have low fees and, like 
an index fund (see Chapter 11), invest to track the performance of a particular 
stock market index.
» Hedge funds: These privately managed funds are for wealthier investors and 
are generally riskier (some even go bankrupt) than a typical mutual fund. The 
fees can be steep — typically 15 to 20 percent of the hedge fund’s annual returns 
as well as an annual management fee of 1 percent or so. They’re also generally 
illiquid — there are usually lock-up periods, and it can still be difficult to get your 
money back out later when needed. I generally don’t recommend them.
» Managed accounts: The major brokerage firms, which employ brokers on 
commission, offer access to private money managers. In reality, this option 
isn’t really different from getting access to fund managers via mutual funds, 
but you’ll generally pay a much higher fee, which reduces this option’s 
attractiveness.
Investing in individual stocks
My experience is that plenty of people choose to invest in individual stocks because 
they think that they’re smarter or luckier than the rest. I don’t know you person￾ally, but it’s safe to say that in the long run, your investment choices are highly 
unlikely to outperform those of the best full-time investment professionals and 
index funds.
When I was a financial counselor, I noticed a distinct difference between the sexes 
on this issue. Perhaps because of the differences in how people are raised, testo￾sterone levels, or whatever, men tend to have more of a problem swallowing their 
egos and admitting that they’re better off not selecting their own individual secu￾rities. Maybe the desire to be a stock picker is genetically linked to not wanting to 
ask for directions!
Investing in individual stocks entails numerous drawbacks and pitfalls:
» You need to spend a significant amount of time doing research. When 
you’re considering the purchase of an individual stock, you should understand 
a lot about the company in which you’re thinking about investing. Relevant 
questions to ask about the company include the following:
• What products or services does it sell?
• What are its prospects for future growth and profitability?
• How much debt does the company have?194 PART 3 Building Wealth through Investing
You need to do your homework not only before you make your initial 
investment but also on an ongoing basis for as long as you hold the invest￾ment. Research takes your valuable free time and sometimes costs money.
» Your emotions will probably get in your way. Analyzing financial state￾ments, corporate strategy, and competitive position requires great intellect 
and insight. However, those skills aren’t nearly enough. Will you have the 
stomach to hold on after what you thought was a sure-win stock plunges 
20, 30, 40, or 50 percent? Will you have the courage to dump such a stock if 
your new research suggests that the plummet is the beginning of the end 
rather than just a big bump in the road? When your money is on the line, 
emotions often kick in and undermine your ability to make sound long-term 
decisions. Few people have the psychological constitution to invest in 
individual stocks and handle and outfox the financial markets.
» You’re less likely to diversify. Unless you have tens of thousands of dollars 
to invest in different stocks, you probably can’t cost-effectively afford to 
research, develop, and monitor a diversified portfolio. For example, when 
you’re investing in stocks, you should hold companies in different industries, 
different companies within an industry, and so on. By not diversifying, you 
unnecessarily add to your risk.
» You’ll face accounting and bookkeeping hassles. When you invest in 
individual securities outside retirement accounts, every time you sell a specific 
security, you must report that transaction on your tax return. Even if you pay 
someone else to complete your tax return, you still have the hassle of keeping 
track of statements and receipts.
Of course, you may find some people (with a vested interest) who try to convince 
you that picking your own stocks and managing your own portfolio of stocks is 
easy and more profitable than investing in, say, a mutual fund or an ETF. In my 
experience, such stock-picking cheerleaders fall into at least one of the following 
categories:
» Newsletter writers: Whether in print, on television, or on a website, some 
pundits pitch the notion that professional money managers are just overpaid 
buffoons and that you can handily trounce the pros with little of your time by 
simply putting your money into the pundits’ stock picks. Of course, what these 
self-anointed gurus are really selling is either an ongoing newsletter (which 
can run upward of several hundred dollars per year) or your required daily 
visitation of their advertising-stuffed websites. How else will you be able to 
keep up with their announced buy-and-sell recommendations? These 
supposed experts want you to be dependent on continually following their 
advice. (I discuss investment newsletters in Chapter 9 and websites in 
Chapter 20.)CHAPTER 10 Understanding Your Investment Choices 195
» Book authors: You can easily find investing books claiming that they can teach 
you a stock-picking strategy for beating the system. Never mind the fact that 
the author has no independently audited track record demonstrating their 
success! The book publisher of at least one investment group (Beardstown 
Ladies) was successfully sued over hyping and misrepresenting the group’s 
actual investment success. Other disreputable book authors (for example, 
Wade Cook) have ended up with penalties and even jail time for such unsub￾stantiated claims in their investment advisory or related businesses.
» Stockbrokers/investment advisors: Some brokers steer you toward 
individual stocks for several reasons that benefit the broker and not you. 
First, as I discuss in Chapter 9, the high-commission brokerage firms can 
make handsome profits for themselves by getting you to buy stocks. Second, 
brokers can use changes in the company’s situation to encourage you to then 
sell and buy different stocks, generating even more commissions. Third, as 
with newsletter writers, this whole process forces you to be dependent on the 
broker, leaving you broker!
Researching individual stocks can be more than a full-time job, and if you choose 
to take this path, remember that you’ll be competing against the professionals 
who do so on a full-time basis. If you derive pleasure from picking and following 
your own stocks, or you want an independent opinion of some stocks you cur￾rently own, useful research reports are available from Value Line (call 800-825-
8354 or visit www.valueline.com). I also recommend that you limit your individual 
stock holdings to no more than 20 percent of your overall investments.
Investing internationally in stocks
Not only can you invest in company stocks that trade on the U.S. stock exchanges, 
but you can also invest in stocks around the world. If you’re in the United States, 
you may ask, “Why would you want to invest in international stocks?”
Here are two solid reasons:
» Many investing opportunities exist overseas. If you look at the total value of all 
stocks outstanding worldwide, the value of foreign stocks typically equals or 
exceeds the value of U.S. stocks.
» When you confine your investing to U.S. securities, you miss a world of opportu￾nities, not only because of business growth available in other countries but also 
because you get the opportunity to diversify your portfolio even further.
International securities markets don’t move in tandem with U.S. markets. During 
various U.S. stock market drops, some international stock markets drop less, 
whereas others may sometimes rise in value.196 PART 3 Building Wealth through Investing
Some people hesitate to invest in overseas securities out of concern that overseas 
investing hurts the U.S. economy and contributes to a loss of American jobs. I have 
some counterarguments. First, if you don’t profit from the growth of economies 
overseas, someone else will. If there’s money to be made, Americans may as well 
be there to participate. Profits from a foreign company are distributed to all stock￾holders, no matter where they live. Dividends and stock price appreciation know 
no national boundaries.
Also, recognize that you’ve long been living in a global economy. Making a dis￾tinction between U.S. and non-U.S. companies is no longer appropriate. Many 
companies that are headquartered in the United States also have overseas opera￾tions. Some U.S. firms derive a large portion of their revenue from their interna￾tional divisions. Conversely, many firms based overseas also have U.S. operations. 
An increasing number of companies are worldwide operations.
So where are the major investing opportunities outside the United States? Inter￾national investing managers generally look at opportunities in three major geo￾graphic regions:
» Latin America: Includes countries such as Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Columbia, 
Costa Rica, Mexico, Panama, and Peru.
» Europe: Includes countries such as Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, 
Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the 
United Kingdom.
» Asia-Pacific: Includes countries such as Australia, China, India, Japan, Hong 
Kong, India, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, and 
Vietnam.
Companies in Canada are generally a small investment portion held by many 
international and global stock funds. Canadian holdings may be listed separately 
or as a part of North America holdings.
Another way in which foreign stocks are categorized is between developed mar￾kets and emerging markets.
» Developed markets are characterized by more mature, stable, and secure 
economies with relatively high standards of living. Examples include countries 
such as Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Switzerland, and the 
United Kingdom.
» Emerging markets tend to be more volatile and typically higher growth 
economies that are in their early economic stages. Examples include countries 
such as Brazil, China, Chile, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, South Africa, 
and Thailand.CHAPTER 10 Understanding Your Investment Choices 197
PROFESSOR JEREMY SIEGEL: GLOBALLY 
DIVERSIFIED STOCK PORTFOLIOS REAP 
BEST RETURNS WITH LOWEST RISK
Wharton School Professor of Finance Jeremy Siegel is the author of the investing classic, 
Stocks for the Long Run (McGraw Hill) in which he explains how stocks have performed 
over the generations and why they offer solid potential for long-term returns. His expla￾nations regarding the value of investing globally are outstanding and summarized for 
your benefit in this sidebar.
Siegal says that the financial markets are now clearly globalized. The United States is no 
longer the “unchallenged giant” but is now one of many countries that offer wealth￾building opportunities to investors. About 90 percent of the value of all stocks world￾wide resided in the United States just after World War II. Today, that percentage is about 
50, and the portion is continuing to shrink. “To invest only in the United States is to 
ignore the majority of the world’s equity capital,” Siegel says.
The developed world (United States, Canada, Western Europe, Japan, Australia, New 
Zealand, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, and Hong Kong) is still overrepresented 
economically and in the world’s stock markets. Although these countries contain just 
15 percent of the world’s population, they account for more than 50 percent of the 
world’s economic activity and more than 90 percent of the world’s equity capital.
“The emerging nations’ share of output and equity capital has been rising rapidly and 
will continue to do so . . . and market capitalism will push countries such as China and 
India to the forefront of the world economy.”
While world markets have tended to move more in tandem in recent years, especially 
over shorter time periods, investing opportunities outside the United States provide 
investors greater ability to diversify and spread risk. Historic data suggests that inves￾tors can minimize risk and maximize returns with about 30 to 50 percent of their stock 
portfolio invested outside the United States.
When investing overseas, investors gain diversification exposure to currencies beyond 
the U.S. dollar but also are exposed to the risks of investing in stocks denominated in 
other currencies. “For investors with long-term horizons, hedging currency risk in for￾eign stock markets is not important. . . . It is not worth the cost.”
Economic historians have shown that during the 17th and 18th centuries, China and 
India accounted for roughly one-third of world economic activity and were power￾houses. Siegel predicts that by 2050, these two countries will again account for about 
that amount of world GDP; he predicts 38 percent (it’s currently 22 percent) and will

Generating wealth with real estate
Over the generations, real-estate owners and investors have enjoyed rates of 
return comparable to those produced by the stock market, thus making real estate 
another time-tested method for building wealth. However, like stocks, real estate 
goes through good and bad performance periods. Most people who make money 
investing in real estate do so because they invest over many years and do their 
homework when they buy to ensure that they purchase good property in solid 
locations at an attractive/fair price.
Buying your own home is the best place to start investing in real estate. The equity
(the difference between the market value of the home and the loan owed on it) in 
your home that builds over the years can become a significant part of your net 
worth. Among other things, you can tap this equity to help finance other impor￾tant personal goals, such as retirement, higher-education costs, and starting or 
buying a business. Moreover, throughout your adult life, owning a home should be 
less expensive than renting a comparable home. See Chapter 15 for the best ways 
to buy and finance real estate.
Real estate: Not your ordinary investment
Real estate differs from most other investments in several respects. Here’s what 
makes real estate unique as an investment:
» You can live in it. You can’t live in a stock, bond, or mutual fund (although I 
suppose you can glue together a substantial fortress with all the paper some 
of these companies mail each year). Real estate is the only investment you can 
use (by living in it or renting it out) to produce income.
» Land is in limited supply. The percentage of the Earth occupied by land is 
relatively constant. And because humans like to reproduce, the demand for 
land and housing continues to grow. Consider the areas that have the most 
account for about 36 percent of world stock market values. Siegel warns, however, “The 
increase in a country’s share of world capital . . . does not necessarily represent capital 
appreciation of existing shares. Rather, most of the increases come from the floatation 
of new capital as well as the acquisition of old capital . . . economic growth does not 
guarantee good returns.”
His conclusion: “Only those investors who have a fully diversified world portfolio will be 
able to reap the best returns with the lowest risk.”
(continued)CHAPTER 10 Understanding Your Investment Choices 199
expensive real-estate prices in the world — Hong Kong, Tokyo, Hawaii, San 
Francisco, and Manhattan. In these densely populated areas, little if any new 
land is available for building new housing.
» Zoning shapes potential value. Local government regulates the zoning of 
property, and zoning determines what a property can be used for. In most 
communities these days, local zoning boards are against big growth. This 
position bodes well for future real-estate values. Also know that in some 
cases, a particular property may not have been developed to its full potential. 
If you can figure out how to better develop the property, you can reap greater 
profits.
» You don’t need a lot of cash up front. Real estate is also different from 
other investments because you can borrow a lot of money to buy it — up 
to 80 to 90 percent or more of the value of the property. This borrowing is 
known as exercising leverage: With only a small investment of 10 to 20 percent 
down, you’re able to purchase and own a much larger investment. When the 
value of your real estate goes up, you make money on your investment and 
on all the money you borrowed. (In case you’re curious, you can leverage 
nonretirement-account stock and bond investments through margin 
borrowing. However, you have to make a much larger “down payment” — 
about double to triple the percentage you need to buy real estate.)
For example, suppose you plunk down $20,000 to purchase a property for 
$100,000. If the property appreciates to $120,000, you make a profit of 
$20,000 (on paper) on your investment of just $20,000. In other words, you 
make a 100 percent return on your investment. But leverage cuts both ways. 
If your $100,000 property decreases in value to $80,000, you actually lose (on 
paper) 100 percent of your original $20,000 investment, even though the 
property value drops only 20 percent.
» You can discover hidden value. In an efficient market, the price of an investment 
accurately reflects its true worth. Some investment markets are more efficient 
than others because of the large number of transactions and easily accessible 
information. Real-estate markets can be inefficient at times. Information is not 
always easy to come by, and you may find an ultra-motivated or uninformed 
seller. If you’re willing to do some homework, you may be able to purchase a 
property below its fair market value (perhaps by as much as 10 to 20 percent).
Just as with any other investment, real estate has its drawbacks. For starters, buy￾ing or selling a property generally takes time and incurs significant cost. When 
you’re renting property, you discover firsthand the occasional headaches of being 
a landlord. And especially in the early years of rental property ownership, the 
property’s expenses may exceed the rental income, producing a net cash drain.200 PART 3 Building Wealth through Investing
The best real-estate investment options
Although real estate is unique in some ways, it’s also like other types of invest￾ments in that prices are driven by supply and demand. You can invest in homes or 
small apartment buildings and then rent them out. In the long run, investment￾property buyers hope that their rental income and the value of their properties 
will increase faster than their expenses.
When selecting real estate for investment purposes, remember that local eco￾nomic growth is the fuel for housing demand. In addition to a vibrant and diverse 
job base, you want to look for limited supplies of both existing housing and land 
on which to build. When you identify potential properties in which you may want 
to invest, run the numbers to understand the cash demands of owning the prop￾erty and the likely profitability. See Chapter 15 for help determining the costs of 
real-estate ownership.
COMPARING REAL ESTATE AND STOCKS
Real estate and stocks have historically produced comparable returns. Deciding 
between the two depends less on the performance of the markets than on you and 
your situation. Consider the following major issues when deciding which investment 
may be better for you:
• The first and most important question to ask yourself is whether you’re cut out to 
handle the responsibilities that come with being a landlord. Real estate is a time￾intensive investment (property managers can help, but their cost takes a sizable 
chunk of your rental income). Investing in stocks can be time-intensive as well, but it 
doesn’t have to be if you use professionally managed mutual funds and exchange￾traded funds (see Chapter 11).
• An often-overlooked drawback to investing in real estate is that you earn no tax 
benefits while you’re accumulating your down payment. Retirement accounts such 
as 401(k)s, SEP-IRAs, 403(b)s, and so on (see Chapter 12) give you an immediate tax 
deduction as you contribute money to them. If you haven’t exhausted your tax￾deductible contributions to these accounts, consider doing so before chasing after 
investment real estate.
• Ask yourself which investments you have a better understanding of. Some folks feel 
uncomfortable with stocks and funds because they don’t understand them. If you 
have a better handle on what makes real estate tick, you have a good reason to 
consider investing in it.
• Figure out what will make you happy. Some people enjoy the challenge that comes 
with managing and improving rental property; it can be a bit like running a small 
business. If you’re good at it and you have some good fortune, you can make 
money and derive endless hours of enjoyment.CHAPTER 10 Understanding Your Investment Choices 201
Although few will admit it, some real-estate investors get an ego rush from a tan￾gible display of their wealth. Sufferers of this “edifice complex” can’t obtain sim￾ilar pleasure from a stock portfolio detailed on a piece of paper (although others 
have been known to boast of their stock-picking prowess). When you want to 
invest directly in real estate, residential housing — such as single-family homes 
or small multi-unit buildings — may be an attractive investment. Buying proper￾ties close to home offers the advantage of allowing you to more easily monitor and 
manage what’s going on. The downside is that your investments will be less 
diversified — more of them will be dependent on the local economy.
If you don’t want to be a landlord — one of the biggest drawbacks of investment 
real estate  — consider investing in real estate through real-estate investment 
trusts (REITs). REITs are diversified real-estate investment companies that pur￾chase and manage rental real estate for investors. A typical REIT invests in one or 
two types of property, such as shopping centers, apartments, and other rental 
buildings. You can invest in REITs either by purchasing them directly on the major 
stock exchanges or by investing in a real-estate mutual fund (see Chapter 11) that 
invests in numerous REITs.
The worst real-estate investments
Not all real-estate investments are good; some aren’t even real investments. The 
bad ones are characterized by burdensome costs and problematic economic 
fundamentals:
» Limited partnerships: Avoid limited partnerships (LPs) sold through brokers 
and financial consultants. LPs are inferior investment vehicles. They’re so 
burdened with high sales commissions and ongoing management fees that 
deplete your investment that you can do better elsewhere. The investment 
salesperson who sells you such an investment stands to earn a commission of 
up to 10 percent or more — so only 90 cents of each dollar gets invested. Each 
year, LPs typically siphon off another several percent for management and 
other expenses. Most partnerships have little or no incentive to control costs. 
In fact, they have a conflict of interest that forces them to charge more to 
enrich the managing partners.
Unlike a mutual fund, you can’t vote with your dollars. If the partnership is 
poorly run and expensive, you’re stuck. LPs are illiquid (not readily convertible 
into cash without a substantial loss). You can’t access your money until the 
partnership is liquidated, typically seven to ten years after you buy in.
Many of the yields on LPs have turned out to be bogus. In some cases, 
partnerships prop up their yields by paying back investors’ principals (without 
telling them, of course). As for returns — well — historically too many LPs 
have been turkeys. The only thing limited about a limited partnership is its 
ability to make you money.202 PART 3 Building Wealth through Investing
» Time-shares: Time-shares are another nearly certain money loser. With a 
time-share, you buy a week or two of ownership, or usage, of a particular unit 
(usually a condominium in a resort location) per year. If, for example, you pay 
$12,000 for a week (in addition to ongoing maintenance fees), you’re paying 
the equivalent of more than $600,000 for the whole unit, when a comparable 
unit nearby may sell for only $225,000. The extra markup pays the salespeo￾ple’s commissions, administrative expenses, and profits for the time-share 
development company.
People usually get enticed into buying a time-share when they’re enjoying a 
vacation someplace. They’re easy prey for salespeople who want to sell them 
a souvenir of the trip. The “cheese in the mousetrap” is an offer of something 
free (for example, a free night’s stay in a unit) for attending the sales 
presentation.
If you can’t live without a time-share, consider buying a used one. Many 
previous buyers, who more than likely have lost a good chunk of money, are 
trying to dump their shares (which should tell you something). In this case, 
you may be able to buy a time-share at a fair price. But why commit yourself 
to taking a vacation in the same location and building at the same time each 
year? Many time-shares let you trade your weeks for other times and other 
places; however, doing so is a hassle — you’re charged an extra fee, and your 
choices are usually limited to time slots that other people don’t want (that’s 
why they’re trading them!).
» Second homes: The weekend getaway is a sometimes romantic notion and 
an extended part of the so-called American dream. When your vacation home 
is not in use, you may be able to rent it out and earn some income to help 
defray the expense of keeping it up. However, most second-home owners 
seldom rent out their property — they typically do so 10 percent or less of the 
time. As a result, second homes are usually money drains, not investments.
The supposed tax benefits are part of the attraction of a second home. Even 
when you qualify for some or all of them, tax benefits only partially reduce the 
cost of owning a property. In some cases, the second home is such a cash 
drain that it prevents its owners from contributing to and taking advantage of 
tax-deductible retirement savings plans.
If you aren’t going to rent out a second home most of the time, ask yourself 
whether you can afford such a luxury. Can you accomplish your other financial 
goals — saving for retirement, paying for the home in which you live, and so 
on — with this added expense? Keeping a second home is more of a con￾sumption than an investment decision. Few people can afford more than 
one home.CHAPTER 10 Understanding Your Investment Choices 203
Investing in small business
Small business is the leading investment through which folks have built the 
greatest wealth. You can invest in small business by starting one yourself (and 
thus finding yourself the best boss you’ve probably ever had), buying an existing 
business, or investing in someone else’s small business. Even if small business 
doesn’t interest you, hopefully your own job does, so I present some tips on mak￾ing the most of your career.
Launching your own enterprise
When you have self-discipline and a product or service you can sell, starting your 
own business can be both profitable and fulfilling. Consider first what skills and 
expertise you possess that you can use in your business. You don’t need a 
“eureka”-type idea or invention to start a small business. Millions of people 
operate successful businesses that are hardly unique, such as dry cleaners, res￾taurants, tax-preparation firms, and so on.
Begin exploring your idea by first developing a business plan. Such a plan should 
detail your product or service, how you’re going to market it, your potential cus￾tomers and competitors, and the economics of the business, including the start￾up costs. Check out Small Business For Dummies, which I co-wrote with Jim Schell 
(Wiley) for information on how to put a plan together.
Of all the small-business investment options, starting your own business involves 
the most work. Although you can do this work on a part-time basis in the begin￾ning, most people end up running their business full-time — it’s your new job, 
career, or whatever you want to call it.
I’ve been running my own business for most of my working years, and I wouldn’t 
trade that experience for the corporate life. That’s not to say that running my own 
business doesn’t have its drawbacks and down moments. But in my experience 
counseling small-business owners, I’ve seen many people of varied backgrounds, 
interests, and skills succeed and be happy with running their own businesses.
In most people’s eyes, starting a new business is the riskiest of all small-business 
investment options. But if you’re going into a business that uses your skills and 
expertise, the risk isn’t as great as some think. Many businesses can be started 
with little cash by leveraging your existing skills and expertise. You can build a 
valuable company and job if you have the time to devote. As long as you check out 
the competition and offer a valued service at a reasonable cost, the principal risk 
with your business comes from not doing a good job marketing what you have to 
offer. If you can market your skills and have a plan to get through the inevitable 
economic down cycles that affect every business, you’re home free.204 PART 3 Building Wealth through Investing
As long as you’re thinking about the risks of starting a business, consider the risks 
of staying in a job you don’t enjoy or that doesn’t challenge or fulfill you. If you 
never take the plunge, you may regret that you didn’t pursue your dreams.
Buying an existing business
If you don’t have a specific product or service you want to sell but you’re skilled at 
managing and improving the operations of a company, buying a small business 
may be for you. Finding and buying a good small business takes much time and 
patience, so be willing to devote at least several months to the search. You may 
also need to enlist financial and legal advisors to help inspect the company, look 
over its financial statements, and hammer out a contract.
Although you don’t have to go through the riskier start-up period if you buy a 
small business, you’ll likely need more capital to buy an established enterprise. 
You’ll also need to be able to deal with stickier personnel and management issues. 
The history of the organization and the way things work will predate your owner￾ship of the business. If you don’t like making hard decisions, firing people who 
don’t fit with your plans, and coercing people into changing the way they do 
things, buying an existing business likely isn’t for you.
Some people perceive buying an existing business as being safer than starting a 
new one. Buying someone else’s business may actually be riskier. You’re likely to 
shell out far more money up front, in the form of a down payment, to buy an 
existing business. If you don’t have the ability to run the business and it does 
poorly, you have more to lose financially. In addition, the business may be for sale 
for a reason — it may not be very profitable, it may be in decline, or it may gen￾erally be a pain in the neck to operate.
Good businesses don’t come cheap. If the business is a success, the current owner 
has already removed the start-up risk from the business, so the price of the busi￾ness should be at a premium to reflect this lack of risk. When you have the capital 
to buy an established business and you have the skills to run it, consider going this 
route.
Purchasing a good franchise can be another way to “buy an existing business.” 
When you purchase a franchise, you buy the local rights to a specified geographic 
territory to sell a company’s products or services under the company’s name and 
to use the company’s system of operation. In addition to an up-front franchisee 
fee, franchisers also typically charge an ongoing royalty.
Franchising makes up a large part of the business world. Companies that you 
likely know that franchise include McDonald’s, Papa John’s, H&R Block, Jiffy 
Lube, 7-Eleven stores, Servpro, Keller Williams, Supercuts, Planet Fitness, Holi￾day Inn, Avis, Smoothie King, Subway, and Foot Locker.CHAPTER 10 Understanding Your Investment Choices 205
When you purchase a new franchise, as with starting a business, you must find 
customers. However, the parent company should have a track record and multiple 
locations with customers.
Investing in someone else’s small business
Are you someone who likes the idea of profiting from successful small businesses 
but doesn’t want the day-to-day headaches of being responsible for managing the 
enterprise? Then investing in someone else’s small business may be for you. 
Although this route may seem easier, few people are actually cut out to be inves￾tors in other people’s businesses. The reason: Finding and analyzing opportuni￾ties isn’t easy.
Are you astute at evaluating corporate financial statements and business strate￾gies? Investing in a small, privately held company has much in common with 
investing in a publicly traded firm (as is the case when you buy stock), but it also 
has a few differences. One difference is that private firms aren’t required to pro￾duce comprehensive, audited financial statements that adhere to certain account￾ing principles. Thus, you have a greater risk of not having sufficient or accurate 
information when evaluating a small, private firm.
Another difference is that unearthing private, small-business investing opportu￾nities is harder. The best private companies who are seeking investors generally 
don’t advertise. Instead, they find prospective investors through networking with 
people such as business advisors. You can increase your chances of finding private 
companies to invest in by speaking with tax, legal, and financial advisors who 
work with small businesses. You can also find interesting opportunities through 
your own contacts or experience within a given industry.
Don’t consider investing in someone else’s business unless you can afford to lose 
all of what you’re investing. Also, you should have sufficient assets so that what 
you’re investing in small, privately held companies represents only a small por￾tion (20 percent or less) of your total financial assets.
Off the Beaten Path: Investment 
Odds and Ends
The investments that I discuss in this section sometimes belong on their own 
planet (because they’re not an ownership or lending vehicle). Here are the basics 
on these other common, but odd, investments.206 PART 3 Building Wealth through Investing
Precious metals
Gold and silver have been used by many civilizations as currency or a medium of 
exchange. One advantage of precious metals as a currency is that they can’t be 
debased by the government. With paper currency, such as U.S. dollars, the gov￾ernment can simply print more. This process can lead to the devaluation of a cur￾rency and inflation.
Holdings of gold and silver can provide a so-called hedge against inflation. In the 
late 1970s and early 1980s, inflation rose dramatically in the United States. This 
largely unexpected rise in inflation depressed stocks and bonds. Gold and silver, 
however, rose tremendously in value — in fact, more than 500 percent (even after 
adjusting for inflation) from 1972 to 1980 (see Chapter 9). Such periods are unu￾sual. Precious metals produced decent returns in the 2000s, but, after peaking in 
2011, precious metals prices fell steeply before recovering in the 2020s.
Over many decades, precious metals tend to be lousy investments. Their rate of 
return tends to keep up with the rate of inflation but not surpass it.
When you want to invest in precious metals as an inflation hedge, your best option 
is to do so through mutual funds or exchange-traded funds (see Chapter 11). Don’t 
purchase precious metals futures. They’re not investments; they’re short-term 
gambles on which way gold or silver prices may head over a short period of time. 
I also recommend staying away from firms and shops that sell coins and bullion
(not the soup, but bars of gold or silver). Even if you can find a legitimate firm (not 
an easy task), the cost of storing and insuring gold and silver is quite costly. You 
won’t get good value for your money — markups can be substantial.
Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other 
cryptocurrencies
Perhaps you have heard of Bitcoin — the online “currency.” I find that far more 
young adults know about it than older folks do, which makes sense because it’s a 
digital currency used for internet transactions.
Increasingly, Bitcoin has been in the news more and more as its price climbs to 
ever dizzying higher heights. In December 2017 the price of a Bitcoin neared the 
$20,000 mark. It then plunged to less than $4,000 late in 2018. The roller coaster 
continued with Bitcoin surging again and zooming past $68,000 in late 2021. By 
late 2022, it sank below $16,000, and as of the writing of this book in late 2023, 
it’s at about $26,000.CHAPTER 10 Understanding Your Investment Choices 207
So what exactly is Bitcoin? For starters, it’s not actually a coin — calling it a coin 
is a marketing gimmick to make it sound like a real currency. Bitcoin and other 
similar cryptocurrencies only exist in the online world. Bitcoin’s creators have 
limited the number of Bitcoins that can be “mined” and put into online circulation 
to about 21 million (more on mining later in this section).
As its promoters have talked up its usefulness and dizzying rise, many people who 
have Bitcoins continue to hold onto them in the hopes that the price will keep ris￾ing. Like shares of stock in the next Amazon.com or Apple, its owners and promot￾ers are hoping and expecting for further steep price increases. People don’t hoard 
real currencies with similar pie-in-the-sky hopes for large investment returns.
Ethereum is the second most popular cryptocurrency as people discover that it 
allows for incorporating smart contracts, which are computer-based and enforced 
contracts that delineate specific conditions that must be met in order for the 
transaction to be completed. Like Bitcoin, Ethereum has had wild boom-bust price 
swings.
Bitcoin looks attractive, but it comes with risks and problems. Here are some 
major issues:
» No repercussions or recourse: Online Bitcoin transactions can be done 
anonymously, and they can’t be contested, disputed, or reversed. If you buy 
something using Bitcoin and have a problem with the item you bought, that’s 
too bad — you have no recourse, unlike, for example, with a purchase made 
on your credit card. The clandestine nature of cryptocurrencies makes them 
attractive to folks trying to hide money or engaged in illegal activities (for 
instance criminals, drug dealers, and so on).
» No inherent value: Contrast that with gold. Not only has gold had a long 
history of being used as a medium of exchange (currency), gold has commer￾cial and industrial uses. Furthermore, gold costs real money to mine out of the 
ground, which provides a floor of support under the price of gold at about 
$1,300 per ounce, not far below the recent price of gold at about $2,000 per 
ounce. (Bitcoin does have a made-up mining process whereby you need 
special computer equipment and end up using a bunch of electricity to solve 
complex math problems.)
» Not unlimited: The supply of Bitcoin is currently artificially limited. And 
Bitcoin is hardly unique — it’s one of hundreds of cryptocurrencies. So if 
another cryptocurrency or two or three is easier to use online and perceived 
as attractive (in part because it’s far less expensive), Bitcoin will eventually 
tumble in value.208 PART 3 Building Wealth through Investing
» Not universally accepted: Even though Bitcoin has been the most popular 
cryptocurrency in recent years, few merchants actually accept it. And, to add 
insult to injury, Bitcoin users get whacked with unfavorable conversion rates, 
which add greatly to the effective price of items bought with Bitcoin.
» Problematic exchanges: There are many safe and reputable brokerage 
firms, protected by regulatory oversight and insurance, through which you 
can buy stocks and other securities. That is not the case with buying and 
selling cryptocurrency. Numerous such crypto brokers have blown up (FTX 
being the largest and most famous) due to incompetence and in some cases 
outright fraud. There’s a lack of regulatory oversight, and many such brokers 
are located outside the United States. The Securities & Exchange Commission 
is playing catch-up and beginning to get its arms around the industry’s myriad 
problems.
In late 2023, about $1.1 trillion was tied up in these cryptocurrencies according to 
CoinMarketCap.com, which now tracks more than 25,000 cryptocurrencies. Over 
the preceding years, Bitcoin’s market share has dropped from nearly 90 percent 
to about 47 percent. CoinMarketCap.com tracks the 100 largest cryptocurrencies 
as measured by their market capitalizations — number 100 on the list recently 
had a market cap of about $270 million.
I can’t tell you what will happen to Bitcoin’s price next month, next year, or next 
decade. But I can tell that it has virtually no inherent value as a digital currency, 
so those paying thousands of dollars for a Bitcoin will eventually be extremely 
disappointed. With more than 23,000 of these cryptocurrencies, the field keeps 
growing as creators hope to get in on the ground floor of the next cryptocurrency, 
which they hope will soar in value.
A recent Wall Street Journal investigation found, “Hundreds of technology firms 
raising money in the fevered market for cryptocurrencies are using deceptive or 
even fraudulent tactics to lure investors. . . . The Wall Street Journal has found 271 
with red flags that include plagiarized investor documents, promises of guaran￾teed returns, and missing or fake executive teams.”
Annuities
Annuities are a peculiar type of insurance and investment product. They’re a sort 
of savings-type account with slightly higher yields, and they’re backed by insur￾ance companies. Fixed annuities pay a preset interest rate determined by the insur￾ance company. This rate is typically set one year ahead at a time. Variable annuities’
return varies over time depending on the returns provided by the investment 
that’s chosen within the annuity offerings.CHAPTER 10 Understanding Your Investment Choices 209
As with other types of retirement accounts, money placed in an annuity com￾pounds without taxation until it’s withdrawn. However, unlike most other types 
of retirement accounts, such as 401(k)s, SEP-IRAs, and 403(b)s, you don’t receive 
up-front tax breaks on contributions you make to an annuity. Ongoing invest￾ment expenses also tend to be much higher than in retirement plan accounts. 
Therefore, consider an annuity generally only after you fully fund tax-deductible 
retirement accounts. There’s one other possible personal use for annuities: Those 
nearing or in retirement with limited resources can insure against the risk of out￾living their assets by buying an annuity and annuitizing it — again, at a cost, so 
proceed carefully. (For more help on deciding whether to invest in an annuity, see 
Chapter 13.)
Collectibles (including NFTs)
The collectibles category is a catchall for antiques, art, autographs, baseball cards, 
clocks, coins, comic books, diamonds, dolls, gems, photographs, rare books, rugs, 
stamps, vintage wine, and writing utensils — in other words, any material object 
that, through some kind of human manipulation, has become more valuable to 
certain humans. Coinciding with the rise of cryptocurrencies, there are now NFTs, 
which stands for non-fungible tokens, that some have called digital collectibles.
Notwithstanding the few people who discover on Antiques Roadshow that they own 
an antique of significant value, collectibles are generally lousy investment vehi￾cles. Dealer markups are enormous, maintenance and protection costs are drain￾ing, research is time-consuming, and people’s tastes are quite fickle. All this for 
returns that, after you factor in the huge markups, rarely keep up with inflation. 
Furthermore, long-term investment gains (of more than one year) you do earn on 
collectibles are currently taxed at your ordinary federal income tax rate with a cap 
of 28 percent, which is higher than the long-term capital gains tax rate on stocks, 
real estate, and small business (20 percent) held for a year or more.
Buy collectibles for your love of the object, not for financial gain. Treat collecting 
as a hobby rather than as an investment. When buying a collectible, try to avoid 
the big markups by cutting out the middlemen. Buy directly from the artist or 
producer if you can. With regards to NFTs, I would be very, very, very careful and 
steer clear until this market, which is in its infancy and largely untested, better 
proves itself.CHAPTER 11 Investing in Funds 211
Chapter 11
Investing in Funds
When you invest in a mutual fund or its close sibling — an exchange￾traded fund (ETF) that trades on a stock exchange — an investment 
company pools your money with the money of many other individuals 
and invests it in stocks, bonds, and other securities. Think of it as a big investment 
club without the meetings! When you invest through a typical fund, several hun￾dred million to billions of dollars are typically invested along with your money.
If you’re thinking of joining the club, read on to discover the benefits of investing 
in leading mutual funds and ETFs and the types of funds available (see Chapter 10 
for a discussion of mutual-fund alternatives). In this chapter, I advise you on 
analyzing and choosing your funds, explain how to track your investments, and 
help you decide when to sell.
Understanding the Benefits of Mutual 
Funds and Exchange-Traded Funds
Mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) rank right up there with 
microwave ovens, sticky notes, and cellphones as one of the best inventions. To 
understand their success is to grasp how and why these funds can work for you. 
IN THIS CHAPTER
» Grasping the merits of mutual funds 
and exchange-traded funds (ETFs)
» Checking out the different types of 
funds
» Choosing the best funds
» Evaluating your fund’s performance
» Monitoring and selling your funds212 PART 3 Building Wealth through Investing
Here are the benefits you receive when you invest in the best mutual funds 
and ETFs:
» Professional management: Mutual funds and ETFs are managed by a portfolio 
manager and research team whose full-time jobs are to screen the universe 
of investments for those that best meet the fund’s stated objectives. These 
professionals call and visit companies, analyze companies’ financial statements, 
and speak with companies’ suppliers and customers. In short, the team does 
more research and analysis than you could ever hope to do in your free time.
Fund managers are typically graduates of the top business and finance 
schools in the country, where they learn the principles of portfolio manage￾ment and securities valuation and selection. The best fund managers typically 
have a decade or more of experience in analyzing and selecting investments, 
and many measure their experience in decades rather than years.
» Low fees: The most efficiently managed stock mutual funds and ETFs cost 
much less than 1 percent per year in fees (bond and money-market funds 
cost even less). And, when you buy a no-load fund, you avoid paying sales 
commissions (known as loads) on your transactions. I discuss these types of 
funds throughout this chapter. You can buy an ETF for a low transaction fee 
through the best online brokers (see Chapter 20).
» Diversification: Fund investing enables you to achieve a level of diversifica￾tion that’s difficult to reach without tens of thousands of dollars and a lot of 
time to invest. If you go it alone, you should invest money in at least 15 to 
20 different securities in different industries to ensure that your portfolio can 
withstand a downturn in one or more of the investments. Proper diversifica￾tion allows a fund to receive the highest possible return at the lowest possible 
risk given its objectives. The most unfortunate investors during major stock 
market downswings have been individuals who had all their money riding on 
only a few stocks that plunged in price by 90 percent or more.
» Low cost of entry: Most mutual funds have low minimum-investment 
requirements, especially for retirement account investors. (ETFs essentially 
have no minimum, although you don’t want to do transactions involving small 
amounts if your brokerage firm charges a fee because that brokerage fee 
takes up a larger percentage of your investment amount.) Even if you have a 
lot of money to invest, consider funds for the low-cost, high-quality money￾management services they provide.
» Audited performance records and expenses: In their prospectuses, all 
funds are required to disclose historical data on returns, operating expenses, 
and other fees. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and 
accounting firms check these disclosures for accuracy. Also, several firms 
(such as Morningstar and Value Line) report hundreds of fund statistics, 
allowing comparisons of performance, risk, and many other factors.CHAPTER 11 Investing in Funds 213
» Flexibility in risk level: Among the different funds, you can choose a level of 
risk that you’re comfortable with and that meets your personal and financial 
goals. If you want your money to grow over a long period of time, you may 
want to select funds that invest more heavily in stocks. If you need current 
income and don’t want investments that fluctuate in value as widely as stocks, 
you may choose more-conservative bond funds. If you want to be sure 
that your invested principal doesn’t drop in value (perhaps because you may 
need your money in the short term), you can select a money-market fund.
Exploring Various Fund Types
In this chapter, I discuss the major types of funds: money-market, bond, and 
stock funds. When fund companies develop and market funds, the names they give 
their funds aren’t always completely accurate or comprehensive. For example, a 
stock fund may not be totally invested in stocks. Twenty percent of it may be 
invested in bonds. Don’t assume that a fund invests exclusively in U.S. companies, 
either — it may invest in international firms, as well.
Note: If you haven’t yet read Chapters 9 and 10, which provide an overview of 
investment concepts and vehicles, doing so can enhance your understanding of 
the rest of this chapter.
Money-market funds
Money-market funds are generally considered the safest type of mutual funds 
(although not insured or guaranteed) for people concerned about losing their 
invested dollars. As with bank savings accounts, the value of your original invest￾ment does not fluctuate.
These funds are closely regulated by the SEC. Trillions of dollars of individuals’ 
and institutions’ money are invested in money-market funds. General-purpose 
money-market funds invest in safe, short-term bank certificates of deposit, 
U.S. Treasuries, and corporate commercial paper (short-term debt), which is issued 
by the largest and most creditworthy companies.
Since their origination in the early 1970s, money-market funds have been 
extremely safe. The risk difference versus a bank account is nil. Only twice have 
funds broken the buck (one by 6 percent, the other by 3 percent), and both funds 
were used only by institutional investors. Hundreds of trillions of dollars have 
flowed into and out of money funds over the decades without any retail investors 
losing principal.214 PART 3 Building Wealth through Investing
Money-market-fund investments can exist only in the most creditworthy securi￾ties and must have an average maturity of less than 120 days. In the unlikely event 
that an investment in a money-market-fund’s portfolio goes sour, the mutual￾fund company that stands behind the money-market fund will almost certainly 
cover the loss.
If the lack of insurance on money-market funds still spooks you, select a money￾market fund that invests exclusively in U.S. government securities, which are vir￾tually risk-free because they’re backed by the full strength and credit of the 
federal government (as is the FDIC insurance system). These types of accounts 
typically pay slightly less interest, although the interest is free of state income tax.
Bond funds
Bonds are IOUs. When you buy a newly issued bond, you typically lend your money 
to a corporation or government agency. A bond fund is nothing more than a large 
group of bonds.
Bond funds typically invest in bonds of similar maturity (the number of years that 
elapse before the borrower must pay back the money you lend). The names of 
most bond funds include a word or two that provides clues about the average 
length of maturity of their bonds. For example, a short-term bond fund typically 
concentrates its investments in bonds maturing in the next two to three years. An 
intermediate-term fund generally holds bonds that come due within three to ten 
years. The bonds in a long-term fund usually mature in more than ten years.
In contrast to an individual bond that you buy and hold until it matures, a bond 
fund is always replacing bonds in its portfolio to maintain its average maturity 
objective. Therefore, if you know that you absolutely, positively must have a cer￾tain principal amount back on a particular date, individual bonds may be more 
appropriate than a bond fund.
Like money-market funds, bond funds can invest in tax-free bonds, which are 
appropriate for investing money you hold outside retirement accounts if you’re in 
a reasonably high tax bracket.
Bond funds are useful when you want to live off interest income or you don’t want 
to put all your money in riskier investments such as stocks and real estate (per￾haps because you plan to use the money soon). Also, making small incremental 
investments in a bond fund is easier, as opposed to the cost of buying a single 
individual bond, which can be many thousands of dollars. Bonds (especially 
municipal bonds, which are bonds issued by local or state government) are among 
the most inefficient parts of the U.S. securities markets. Individual investors can’t CHAPTER 11 Investing in Funds 215
easily determine the bonds’ true value and pay steep markups or markdowns, all 
of which a larger institutional trader (like a mutual fund) can more easily avoid.
Stock funds
Stock funds, as their name implies, invest in stocks. These funds are often referred 
to as equity funds. Equity  — not to be confused with equity in real estate  — is 
another word for stocks. Stock funds are often categorized by the type of stocks 
they primarily invest in.
Stock types are first defined by size of company (small, medium, or large). The 
total market value (capitalization) of a company’s outstanding stock determines its 
size. Small-company stocks, for example, are usually defined as companies with 
total market capitalization of less than $2 billion. Mid-cap stocks are defined as 
having a market capitalization of between $2 and $10 billion, and large cap stocks 
are those with market caps over $10 billion. Stocks are further categorized as 
growth or value stocks:
» Growth stocks represent companies that are experiencing rapidly expanding 
revenues and profits and typically have high stock prices relative to their 
current earnings or asset (book) values. These companies tend to reinvest 
most of their earnings in their infrastructure to fuel future expansion. Thus, 
growth stocks typically pay low dividends. (See the later “Dividends” section 
for more information.)
» Value stocks are at the other end of the spectrum. Value stock investors look 
for good buys. They want to invest in stocks that are cheaply priced in relation 
to the profits per share and book value (assets less liabilities) of the company. 
Value stocks are usually less volatile than growth stocks.
These categories are combined in various ways to describe how a mutual fund 
invests its money. One fund may focus on large-company growth stocks, while 
another fund may limit itself to small-company value stocks. Funds are further 
classified by the geographical focus of their investments: U.S., international, 
worldwide, and so on (see the section “U.S., international, and global funds”).
Mixing bonds and stocks: Balanced funds
Balanced funds invest in a mixture of different types of securities. Most commonly, 
they invest in bonds and stocks. These funds are usually less risky and volatile 
than funds that invest exclusively in stocks. In an economic downturn, bonds 
usually hold up in value better than stocks do. However, during good economic 
times when the stock market is booming, the bond portions of these funds tend to 
drag down their performance a bit.216 PART 3 Building Wealth through Investing
Balanced mutual funds generally try to maintain a fairly constant percentage of 
investments in stocks and bonds. A similar class of funds, known as asset allocation 
funds, tends to adjust the mix of different investments according to the portfolio 
manager’s expectations of the market. Of course, exceptions do exist — some bal￾anced funds adjust their allocations, whereas some asset allocation funds main￾tain a relatively fixed mix.
Most funds that shift money around instead of staying put in good investments 
rarely beat the market averages over a number of years.
There are also now increasing numbers of target-date or retirement-date funds, 
which tend to decrease their risk (and stock allocation) over time. Such funds 
appeal to investors who are approaching a particular future goal, such as retire￾ment or a child’s college education, and want their fund to automatically adjust as 
that date approaches.
Balanced funds are a way to make fund investing simple. They give you extensive 
diversification across a variety of investing options. They also make it easier for 
stock-skittish investors to invest in stocks while avoiding the high volatility of 
pure stock funds.
U.S., international, and global funds
Unless they have words like international, global, worldwide, or world in their names, 
most American-issued funds focus their investments in the United States. But 
even funds without one of these terms attached may invest some of its money 
internationally.
The only way to know for sure where a fund is currently invested (or where the 
fund may invest in the future) is to investigate. A fund’s annual report (which can 
be found on the fund company’s website) details where the fund is investing (the 
prospectus will also detail where the fund can be invested). You can also call the 
toll-free number of the fund company you’re interested in and ask.
When a fund has the term international or foreign in its name, it typically means 
that the fund invests anywhere in the world except the United States. The term 
worldwide or global generally implies that a fund invests everywhere in the world, 
including the United States.CHAPTER 11 Investing in Funds 217
Index funds
Index funds are funds that can be (and are, for the most part) managed by a formu￾laic approach. An index fund’s assets are invested to replicate an existing market 
index such as Standard & Poor’s 500, an index of 500 large U.S. company stocks. 
(Some exchange-traded funds are index funds with the added twist that they 
trade on a major stock exchange.)
Over long periods (ten years or more), index funds outperform about three￾quarters of their peers! How is that possible? How can mindlessly mimicking the 
holdings of a given index beat an intelligent, creative, MBA-endowed portfolio 
manager with a crack team of research analysts scouring the market for the best 
securities? The answer is largely cost. You can run an index fund with a much 
smaller management team and without spending gobs of money on research. An 
index fund doesn’t need a team of research analysts.
In contrast to passively managed index funds, most active fund managers can’t 
overcome the handicap of high operating expenses that pull down their funds’ 
rates of return. As I discuss later in this chapter, operating expenses include all 
FUNDS OF FUNDS
An increasing number of fund providers are responding to overwhelmed investors by 
offering a simplified way to construct a portfolio: a fund that diversifies across numer￾ous other funds — or a fund of funds. When a fund of funds is done right, it helps focus 
fund investors on the important big-picture issue of asset allocation — how much of 
your investment money you put into bonds versus stocks. Although the best funds of 
funds appear to deliver a high-quality, diversified portfolio of funds in one fell swoop, 
funds of funds are not all created equal, and few are worthy of your investment dollars.
The fund of funds idea isn’t new. In fact, the concept has been around for many years. 
High fees gave the earlier funds of funds, run in the 1950s by the late Bernie Cornfeld, a 
bad name. Cornfeld established a fund of funds outside the United States and tacked 
on many layers of fees. Although the funds were profitable for his enterprise, duped 
investors suffered a continual drain of high fees. The Cornfeld episode is an important 
reason why the SEC has been careful in approving new funds of funds.
The newer funds of funds developed by the larger fund companies are investor friendly 
and ones that I recommend. Vanguard’s LifeStrategy & Target Retirement, Fidelity’s 
Freedom, Schwab Target Date, and T. Rowe Price’s Spectrum funds of funds add no 
extra fees for packaging together the individual funds. Long-term performance of many 
of these is solid. Annual operating fees on the underlying funds at Vanguard are around 
0.1 percent.218 PART 3 Building Wealth through Investing
the fees and profit that a mutual fund extracts from a fund’s returns before the 
returns are paid to you. For example, the average U.S. stock fund has an operating 
expense ratio of 1.1 percent per year. So a U.S. stock index fund (or its peer 
exchange-traded fund, which is an index fund that trades on a stock exchange) 
with an expense ratio of just 0.1 percent per year has an advantage of 1.0 percent 
per year.
Another not-so-inconsequential advantage of index funds is that they can’t 
underperform the market. Many actively managed funds do just that because of 
the burden of high fees and/or poor management. For money invested outside 
retirement accounts, index funds have an added advantage: Lower taxable capital 
gains distributions are made to shareholders because less trading of securities is 
conducted and a more stable portfolio is maintained.
Yes, index funds may seem downright boring. When you invest in them, you give 
up the opportunity to brag to others about your shrewd investments that beat the 
market averages. On the other hand, with a low-cost index fund, you have no 
chance of doing worse than the market (which plenty of active investment man￾agers do).
Index funds and exchange-traded funds make sense for a portion of your invest￾ments, because beating the market is difficult for portfolio managers. The Van￾guard Group (phone 800-662-7447; website www.vanguard.com), headquartered 
in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, is the largest and lowest-cost provider of such 
funds.
Specialty (sector) funds
Specialty funds don’t fit neatly into the previous categories. These funds are often 
known as sector funds, because they generally invest in securities in specific 
industries.
In most cases, you should avoid investing in specialty funds. Investing in stocks 
of a single industry defeats one of the major purposes of investing in funds — 
diversification. Another good reason to avoid specialty funds is that they tend to 
carry higher expenses than other funds.
Specialty funds that invest in real estate or precious metals may make sense for a 
small portion (10 percent or less) of your investment portfolio. These types of 
funds can help diversify your portfolio, because they can do better during times of 
higher inflation.CHAPTER 11 Investing in Funds 219
Selecting the Best Funds
When you go camping in the wilderness, you can do a number of things to maxi￾mize your chances for happiness and success. You can take maps, a smartphone, 
and a GPS to keep you on course; food for nourishment; proper clothing to stay dry 
and warm; and some first-aid gear to treat minor injuries. But regardless of how 
much advance preparation you do, you may have a problematic experience. You 
may take the wrong trail, trip on a rock and break your ankle, or lose your food to 
a tenacious bear that comes romping through camp one night.
And so it is with funds. Although most fund investors are rewarded for their 
efforts, you get no guarantees. You can, however, follow some simple, common￾sense guidelines to help keep you on the trail and increase your odds of invest￾ment success and happiness. The factors in the following sections are the main 
ones to consider.
Reading prospectuses and annual reports
Fund companies produce information that can help you make decisions about 
fund investments. Every fund is required to issue a prospectus. This legal document 
is reviewed and audited by the SEC. The most valuable information — the fund’s 
investment objectives, costs, performance history, and primary risks — is sum￾marized in the first few pages of the prospectus. Make sure that you read this part. 
Skip the rest, which is comprised mostly of tedious legal details. Funds also pro￾duce what’s called a summary prospectus, which is an abbreviated version of the full 
length (statutory) prospectus, and which hits the important highlights.
Funds also produce annual reports that discuss how the fund has been doing and 
provide details on the specific investments a fund holds. If, for example, you want 
to know which countries an international fund invests in, you can find this infor￾mation in the fund’s annual report.
Keeping costs low
The charges you pay to buy or sell a fund, as well as the fund’s ongoing operating 
expenses, can have a big impact on the rate of return you earn on your invest￾ments. Many novice investors pay too much attention to a fund’s prior perfor￾mance (in the case of stock funds) or to the fund’s current yield (in the case of 
bond funds) and too little attention to fees. Doing so is dangerous because a fund 
can inflate its return or yield in numerous (risky) ways. And what worked yester￾day may flop tomorrow.220 PART 3 Building Wealth through Investing
Fund costs are an important factor in the return you earn from a fund. Fees are 
deducted from your investment. All other things being equal, high fees and other 
charges depress your returns. What are a fund’s fees, you ask? Good question — 
read on to find the answers.
Eliminating loads
Loads are up-front or ongoing annual commissions paid to brokers who sell 
mutual funds. Loads typically range from 3 percent to as high as 8.5 percent of 
your investment. Sales loads have two problems:
» Sales loads are an extra cost that drags down your investment returns.
Because commissions are paid to the salesperson and not to the fund 
manager, the manager of a load fund doesn’t work any harder and isn’t any 
more qualified than a manager of a no-load fund. Common sense suggests, 
and studies confirm, that load funds perform worse, on average, than no-loads 
when factoring in the load because the load charge is subtracted from your 
payment before your payment is invested.
» The power of self-interest can bias your broker’s advice. Although this 
issue is rarely discussed, it’s even more problematic than the issue of sales 
loads. Brokers who work for a commission are interested in selling you 
commission-based investment products; therefore, their best interests 
often conflict with your best interests.
Although you may be mired in high-interest debt or underfunding your 
retirement plan, salespeople almost never advise you to pay off your credit 
cards or put more money into your 401(k). To get you to buy, they tend to 
exaggerate the potential benefits and obscure the risks and drawbacks of 
what they sell. They don’t take the time to educate investors. I’ve seen too 
many people purchase investment products through brokers without 
understanding what they’re buying, how much risk they’re taking, and 
how these investments will affect their overall financial lives.
Invest in no-load (commission-free) funds. The only way to be sure that a fund is 
truly no-load is to look at the prospectus for the fund. Only there, in black and 
white and without marketing hype, must the truth be told about sales charges and 
other fund fees. When you want investing advice, hire a financial advisor on a fee￾for-service basis (see Chapter 19), which should cost less and minimize potential 
conflicts of interest.
Minimizing operating expenses
All funds charge ongoing fees. The fees pay for the operational costs of running 
the fund  — employees’ compensation, marketing, website development and CHAPTER 11 Investing in Funds 221
maintenance, servicing the toll-free phone lines, printing and mailing published 
materials, technology for tracking investments and account balances, accounting 
fees, and so on. Despite being labeled “expenses,” the profit a fund company 
earns for running the fund is added to the tab as well.
The fund’s operating expenses are quoted as an annual percentage of your invest￾ment and are essentially invisible to you because they’re deducted before you’re 
paid any return. The expenses are charged on a daily basis, so you don’t need to 
worry about trying to get out of a fund before these fees are deducted. You can find 
a fund’s operating expenses in the fund’s prospectus. Look in the expenses sec￾tion and find a line that says something like “Total Fund Operating Expenses.” 
You can also call the fund’s toll-free number and ask a representative.
Within a given sector of funds (for example, money-market, short-term bond, or 
international stock), funds with low annual operating fees can more easily pro￾duce higher total returns for you. Although expenses matter on all funds, some 
types of funds are more sensitive to high expenses than others. Expenses are criti￾cal on money-market funds and very important on bond funds. Fund managers 
already have a hard time beating the averages in these markets; with higher 
expenses added on, beating the averages is nearly impossible.
With stock funds, expenses are a less important (but still significant) factor in a 
fund’s performance. Don’t forget that, over time, stocks average returns of about 
9 percent per year. So, if one stock fund charges 1 percent more in operating 
expenses than another fund, you’re already giving up an extra 11 percent of your 
expected returns.
Some people argue that investing in stock funds that charge high expenses may be 
justified if those funds generate higher rates of return. However, evidence doesn’t 
show that these stock funds actually generate higher returns. In fact, funds with 
higher operating expenses tend to produce lower rates of return. This fact makes 
sense, because operating expenses are deducted from the returns a fund gener￾ates. (One additional cost not included in a fund’s expense ratio is trading costs. 
The SEC requires funds to report these costs in their annual reports.)
Stick with funds that maintain low total operating expenses and don’t charge 
loads (commissions). Both types of fees come out of your pocket and reduce your 
rate of return. You have no reason to pay a lot for the best funds. (In Chapters 12 
and 13, I provide some specific fund recommendations as well as sample portfolios 
for investors in different situations.)222 PART 3 Building Wealth through Investing
Evaluating historic performance
A fund’s performance, or historic rate of return, is another factor to weigh when 
selecting a fund. As all funds are supposed to tell you, past performance is no 
guarantee of future results. An analysis of historic fund performance proves that 
some of yesterday’s stars turn into tomorrow’s skid-row bums.
Many former high-return funds achieved their results by taking on high risk. 
Funds that assume higher risk should produce higher rates of return. But high￾risk funds usually decline in price faster during major market declines. Thus, in 
order for a fund to be considered a best fund, it must consistently deliver a favor￾able rate of return given the degree of risk it takes.
When assessing an individual fund, compare its performance and volatility over 
an extended period of time (at least five to ten years) to a relevant market index. 
For example, compare funds that focus on investing in large U.S. companies to the 
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. Compare funds that invest in U.S. stocks of all sizes 
to the CRSP U.S. Total Stock Market Index. Indexes also exist for bonds, foreign 
stock markets, and almost any other type of security you can imagine.
Assessing fund manager and 
fund family reputations
Much is made of who manages a specific mutual fund. As Peter Lynch, the retired 
and famous former manager of the Fidelity Magellan fund, said, “The financial 
press made us Wall Street types into celebrities, a notoriety that was largely unde￾served. Stock stars were treated as rock stars. . . .”
Although the individual fund manager is important, no fund manager is an island. 
The resources and capabilities of the parent company are equally important. 
Different companies have different capabilities and levels of expertise in relation 
to the different types of funds. When you’re considering a particular fund — for 
example, the Barnum & Barney High-Flying Foreign Stock fund — examine the 
performance history and fees not only of that fund but also of similar foreign 
stock funds at the Barnum & Barney company. If Barnum’s other foreign stock 
funds have done poorly, or Barnum & Barney offers no other such funds because 
it’s focused on its circus business, those are strikes against its High-Flying fund. 
Also, be aware that “star” fund managers tend to be associated with higher￾expense funds to help pay their celebrity salaries. (And star managers tend to 
leave or get hired away after several years of stellar performance, so you may not 
be getting the manager who created that good past performance in the first place. 
Index and asset class funds that use a team approach avoid this issue.)CHAPTER 11 Investing in Funds 223
Rating tax friendliness
Investors often overlook tax implications when selecting funds for nonretirement 
accounts. Numerous funds effectively reduce their shareholders’ returns because 
of their tendency to produce more taxable distributions — that is, capital gains 
(especially short-term gains, which are taxed at the highest federal income tax 
rate) and dividends. (See the “Dividends” and “Capital gains” sections later in 
this chapter.)
Fund capital-gains distributions have an impact on an investor’s after-tax rate of 
return. All fund managers buy and sell stocks over the course of a year. Whenever 
a fund manager sells securities, any gain or loss from those securities must be 
distributed to fund shareholders. Securities sold at a loss can offset securities sold 
at a profit. When a fund manager has a tendency to cash in more winners than 
losers, investors in the fund receive taxable gains. So, even though some funds 
can lay claim to producing higher total returns, after you factor in taxes, they 
actually may not produce higher total returns.
Choosing funds that minimize capital-gains distributions helps you defer taxes 
on your profits. By allowing your capital to continue compounding as it would in 
a retirement account, you receive a higher total return. When you’re a long-term 
investor, you benefit most from choosing funds that minimize capital-gains dis￾tributions. The more years that appreciation can compound without being taxed, 
the greater the value to you as the investor.
If you’re purchasing shares in funds outside tax-sheltered retirement accounts, 
consider the time of year when making your purchases. December is the most 
common month in which funds make capital-gains distributions. When making 
purchases late in the year, ask whether the fund may make a significant 
capital-gains distribution. Consider delaying purchases in such funds until after 
the distribution date.
Determining your needs and goals
Selecting the best funds for you requires an understanding of your investment 
goals and risk tolerance. What may be a good fund for your next-door neighbor 
may not necessarily be a good fund for you. You have a unique financial profile.
If you’ve already determined your needs and goals — terrific! If you haven’t, see 
Chapter 4. Understanding yourself is a good part of the battle. But don’t short￾change yourself by not being educated about the investment you’re considering. If 
you don’t understand what you’re investing in and how much risk you’re taking, 
stay out of the game.224 PART 3 Building Wealth through Investing
Deciphering Your Fund’s Performance
As a fund investor, you can’t simply calculate your return by comparing the share 
price of the fund today to the share price you originally paid. Why not? Because 
funds make distributions of dividends and capital gains, which, when reinvested, 
give you more shares of the fund.
Even if you don’t reinvest distributions, they create an accounting problem, 
because they reduce the share price of a fund. (Otherwise, you can make a profit 
from the distribution by buying into a fund just before a distribution is made.) 
Therefore, over time, following just the share price of your fund doesn’t tell you 
how much money you’ve made or lost.
The only way to figure out exactly how much you’ve made or lost on your invest￾ment is to compare the total value of your holdings in the fund today with the total 
dollar amount you originally invested. If you invested chunks of money at various 
points in time and you want to factor in the timing of your various investments, 
this exercise becomes complicated. (Check out my investment website, app, and 
software recommendations in Chapter 20 if you want to harness technology to 
help you crunch the numbers.)
The total return of a fund is the percentage change of your investment over a speci￾fied period. For example, a fund may tell you that in the past year, its total return 
was 15 percent. Therefore, if you invested $10,000 in the fund on the last day of 
the prior year, your investment would be worth $11,500 at the end of that year. To 
find out a fund’s total return, you can visit the company’s website, call the fund 
company’s toll-free number, or read the fund’s annual report.
The following three components make up your total return on a fund:
» Dividends (includes interest paid by money-market or bond funds)
» Capital-gains distributions
» Share price changes
In short, you calculate a fund’s total return as follows:
Dividends + Capital Gains Distributions + Share Price Changes = Total Return
The following sections discuss each of these components in more detail.CHAPTER 11 Investing in Funds 225
Dividends
Dividends are income paid by investments. Both bond funds and stocks can pay 
dividends. Bond fund dividends (the interest paid by the individual bonds in a 
fund) tend to be higher (as a percentage of the amount you have invested in a 
fund). When a dividend distribution is made, you can receive it as cash (which is 
good if you need money to live on) or reinvest it into more shares in the fund. In 
either case, the share price of the fund drops to offset the payout. So if you’re hop￾ing to strike it rich by buying into a bunch of funds just before their dividends are 
paid, don’t bother. You’ll just end up paying more in income taxes.
If you hold your mutual fund outside a retirement account, the dividend distribu￾tions are taxable income (unless they come from a tax-free municipal-bond 
fund). Dividends are taxable whether or not you reinvest them as additional shares 
in the fund. Stock dividends are taxed at a low rate — 0 percent for those in the 
federal 10- and 12-percent tax brackets, 15 percent for most people in the higher 
federal tax brackets, and 20 percent for those in the highest federal income tax 
brackets. From Obamacare, there is also a 3.8 percent surcharge on investment 
earnings for higher income taxpayers.
Capital gains
When a fund manager sells a security in the fund, net gains realized from that sale 
(the difference from the purchase price) must be distributed to you as a capital 
gain. Typically, funds make one annual capital-gains distribution in December, 
but distributions can be paid multiple times per year.
As with a dividend distribution, you can receive your capital-gains distribution as 
cash or as more shares in the fund. In either case, the share price of the fund drops 
to offset the distribution.
For funds held outside retirement accounts, your capital-gains distribution is 
taxable. As with dividends, capital gains are taxable whether or not you reinvest 
them in additional shares in the fund. Capital-gains distributions can be partly 
comprised of short-term and long-term gains. As I discuss in Chapter 8, profits 
realized on securities sold after more than a one-year holding period are taxed at 
the lower long-term capital gains rate. Short-term gains are taxed at the ordinary 
income tax rate.
If you want to avoid making an investment in a fund that is about to make a 
capital-gains distribution, check with the fund to determine when capital gains 
are distributed. Capital-gains distributions increase your current-year tax liabil￾ity for investments made outside of retirement accounts. (I discuss this concept in 
more detail in Chapter 13.)226 PART 3 Building Wealth through Investing
Share price changes
You also make money with a fund when the share price increases. This occurrence 
is just like investing in a stock or piece of real estate. If the fund is worth more 
today than it was when you bought it, you’ve made a profit (on paper, at least). In 
order to realize or lock in this profit, you need to sell your shares in the fund.
Evaluating and Selling Your Funds
How closely you follow your funds is up to you, depending on what makes you 
happy and comfortable. I don’t recommend tracking the share prices of your funds 
(or other investments, for that matter) on a daily basis; it’s time-consuming and 
nerve-racking, and it can make you lose sight of the (long-term) big picture. 
When you track your investments too closely, you’re more likely to panic when 
times get tough. And with investments held outside of retirement accounts, every 
time you sell an investment at a profit, you get hit with taxes.
A monthly or quarterly review is more than frequent enough for following your 
funds. Many publications and websites carry total return numbers over varying 
periods so you can determine the exact rate of return you’re earning.
Trying to time and trade the markets so you buy at lows and sell at highs rarely 
works. Yet an entire industry of investment newsletters, hotlines, online services, 
and the like purport to be able to tell you when to buy and sell. Don’t waste your 
time and money on such predictive nonsense. (See Chapter 9 for more info about 
gurus and newsletters.)
Consider selling a fund only when it no longer meets the criteria mentioned in 
“Selecting the Best Funds” earlier in this chapter. If a fund underperforms its 
peers for at least a two-year period, or if a fund jacks up its management fees, it 
may be a good time to sell. But if you do your homework and buy good funds from 
good fund companies, you shouldn’t have to do much trading.
Finding and investing in good funds isn’t rocket science. Chapters  12 and  13 
recommend some specific funds using the criteria discussed earlier in this 
chapter. If you’re still not satiated, pick up a copy of the latest edition of my book 
Mutual Funds For Dummies (Wiley) and visit my website at www.erictyson.com for 
more details on the best exchange-traded funds and mutual funds.CHAPTER 12 Investing in Retirement Accounts 227
Chapter 12
Investing in Retirement 
Accounts
This chapter helps you make sense of the various retirement account options 
and decide how to invest money you currently hold inside  — or plan to 
contribute to — retirement accounts. (To see how much money you should 
be saving toward retirement, see Chapter 4.)
Looking at Types of Retirement Accounts
In most cases, your contributions to retirement accounts are tax-deductible. And 
when you place your money inside the retirement account, it compounds without 
taxation until you withdraw it. (Some accounts, such as the Roth IRA, aren’t 
tax-deductible up front but even allow for tax-free withdrawal of investment 
earnings.) If you’re not a high-income earner, you may be eligible for a tax 
credit for making retirement account contributions — please refer to Table 8-2 in 
Chapter  8. The following sections detail the types of retirement accounts and 
explain how to determine whether you’re eligible and how to make the best use 
of them.

Employer-sponsored plans
Your employer sets up this type of retirement plan and usually provides a limited 
number of investment options. All you have to do is contribute and choose how to 
divide your money among the menu of investment choices.
401(k) plans
For-profit companies may offer 401(k) plans. The silly name comes from the sec￾tion of the tax code that establishes and regulates these plans. A 401(k) generally 
allows you to save up to $22,500 per year (for 2023), usually through payroll 
deductions. If you’re age 50 or older, you can stash away $7,500 more — for a 
total of $30,000 (for 2023). Your employer’s plan may have lower limits, though. 
Your contributions to a 401(k) are excluded from your reported income and thus 
are generally free from federal and state income taxes (although they are subject 
to Social Security and Medicare taxes). Future year limits will increase in $500 
increments to keep pace with inflation. Effective 2025, workers aged 60 to 63 are 
allowed to contribute even more than younger workers: They may contribute up 
to $10,000 more per year or 150 percent of the more limited catch-up contribution 
amount for 2024. This higher contribution limit will increase yearly with inflation 
beginning in 2026.
Some employers offer a Roth 401(k) option, which doesn’t offer an up-front tax 
deduction but does enable you to put away more money to compound without tax￾ation. Also, withdrawals after age 59½ are tax-free as long as you’ve had the 
account for at least five years.
Some employers don’t allow you to contribute to a 401(k) plan until you work for 
them for a full year. Others allow you to start contributing right away. Some 
employers also match a portion of your contributions. They may, for example, 
match half of your first 6 percent of contributions; so in addition to saving a lot of 
taxes, you get a bonus from the company.
If you’re a high-income earner and you contribute such a significant percentage 
of each paycheck that you hit the plan maximum before the end of the year, you 
may lose out on some matching money. You may be better off spreading your 
contributions over the full calendar year. Check with your company’s benefits 
department for your plan’s specifics.
Smaller companies (those with fewer than 100 employees) can offer 401(k) plans 
or SIMPLE-IRAs (Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees of Small Employ￾ers), too. If your company is interested in this option, contact some of the leading 
mutual-fund organizations and discount brokerage firms that I discuss in 
Chapter 13 and in the section “Allocating money in plans you design” later in this 
chapter.CHAPTER 12 Investing in Retirement Accounts 229
403(b) plans
Nonprofit organizations may offer 403(b) plans to their employees. As with 401(k)s, 
your contributions to these plans are excluded from federal and state income taxes. 
(Some employers are offering a Roth 403(b) option: There are no up-front tax 
breaks on contributions, but investment earnings compound without taxation and 
withdrawals past age 59½ aren’t taxed as long as you’ve had the account for five 
years.) The 403(b) plans are often called tax-sheltered annuities, the name for insur￾ance company investments that satisfy the requirements for 403(b) plans. For the 
benefit of 403(b) retirement plan participants, no-load (commission-free) mutual 
funds can be used in 403(b) plans. (See Chapter 11 for more on mutual funds.)
CAN YOUR EMPLOYER STEAL YOUR 
RETIREMENT MONEY?
The short answer, unfortunately, is yes. However, the vast majority of employees, partic￾ularly those who work for larger and more established companies, need not worry.
Some companies that administer 401(k) plans have been cited by the U.S. Labor 
Department for being too slow in putting money that employees had deferred from 
their paychecks into employee 401(k) investment accounts. In the worst cases, compa￾nies diverted employees’ 401(k) money to pay corporate bills. Business owners who 
engaged in such practices used 401(k) money as a short-term emergency fund.
In cases where companies failed and funds were diverted from employee 401(k) 
accounts, the funds were lost. In situations where the employer delayed placing the 
money into the employees’ 401(k) accounts, employees simply lost out on earning 
returns on their investments during the period. When your contributions are in your 
401(k) account, they’re financially and legally separate from your employer. Thus, your 
funds are still protected even if your employer goes bankrupt or if some unscrupulous 
person at your employer seeks to pilfer your retirement account money.
The Labor Department requires employers to contribute employee retirement contribu￾tions to their proper accounts as soon as they can reasonably be segregated from the 
employer’s general assets, but not later than the 15th business day of the month imme￾diately after the month in which the contributions were either withheld or received by 
the employer. (Employers can get into trouble, for example, if they make a deposit later 
than they typically do — taking, say, ten days when they normally deposit the money 
within a few days.) In addition to keeping tabs on your employer to ensure that money 
withheld from your paycheck is contributed into your account within this time frame, 
periodically check your 401(k) account to make sure that your contributions are being 
invested as you instructed.230 PART 3 Building Wealth through Investing
Nonprofit employees can annually contribute up to $22,500 of their salary 
($30,000 if age 50 or older) for tax year 2023. (Future year limits will increase 
with the cost of living in $500 increments.) Employees who have 15 or more years 
of service may be allowed to contribute beyond the standard limits. Ask your 
employee benefits department or the investment provider for the 403(b) plan 
about eligibility requirements and the details of your personal contribution limit. 
Higher contribution limits for older workers kick in in 2025 — see the “401(k) 
plans” section for the details on that.
If you work for a nonprofit or public-sector organization that doesn’t offer this 
benefit, lobby for it. Nonprofit organizations have no excuse not to offer a 403(b) 
plan to their employees. Unlike a 401(k), this type of plan requires virtually no 
out-of-pocket expenses from the employer. The only requirement is that the 
organization must deduct the appropriate contribution from employees’ pay￾checks and send the money to the investment company handling the 403(b) plan.
When compared to insurance company annuities, no-load (no sales charge) 
mutual funds are superior investment vehicles on several fronts:
» Mutual-fund companies have a longer and more successful investment track 
record than do insurance companies, many of which have only recently 
entered the mutual-fund arena.
» Insurance annuities charge higher annual operating expenses, often two to 
three times those of efficiently managed no-load mutual funds. These high 
expenses reduce your returns.
» Insurance company insolvency (bankruptcy) can risk the safety of your 
investment in an annuity, whereas the value of a mutual fund depends only 
on the value of the securities in the fund. (If a mutual-fund company fails, your 
securities investments aren’t lost because they’re held separately from the 
assets of the fund company itself.)
» Insurance annuities come with significant charges for early surrender; 403(b) 
plans with mutual funds don’t include these charges.
With some 403(b) plans, you may borrow against your fund balance without pen￾alty. If this capability is important to you, check with your employer to see whether 
the company plan allows loans. Although many insurance annuities advertise 
borrowing as an advantage, it can also be a drawback, because it may encourage 
you to raid your retirement money.
As long as your employer allows it, you may want to open a 403(b) account at the 
investment companies I suggest in the section “Allocating money in plans you 
design” later in this chapter.CHAPTER 12 Investing in Retirement Accounts 231
457 plans
Some nonprofit organizations and state and local governments offer 457 plans. 
Like 403(b) or 401(k) plans, 457 plans offer participants the ability to contribute 
money from their paychecks on a pre-tax basis and thus save on federal and 
state taxes.
Money that you contribute to a tax-exempt organization’s 457 plan is not sepa￾rate from the organization’s finances. Thus, if the nonprofit goes belly up — a 
rare but not impossible occurrence in the nonprofit world  — your retirement 
funds can be in jeopardy.
Don’t consider contributing to a 457 plan until you exhaust contributions to your 
403(b). The 2023 tax year contribution limits for a 457 plan are $22,500 per year 
($30,000 if age 50 or older). Future year limits will increase with inflation in $500 
increments.
Self-employed plans
When you work for yourself, you don’t have an employer to do the legwork neces￾sary for setting up a retirement plan. You need to take the initiative. Although 
setting up a retirement account on your own requires more work, you can select 
and design a plan that meets your needs. Self-employment retirement savings 
plans may allow you to put more money away on a tax-deductible basis than do 
employers’ plans.
When you have employees, you’re required to provide coverage for them under 
these plans with contributions comparable to the company owners’ (as a percent￾age of salary).
Some part-time (fewer than 1,000 hours per year) and newer (those with less than 
a few years of service) employees may be excluded. Many small-business owners 
either don’t know about this requirement or choose to ignore it; they set up plans 
for themselves but fail to cover their employees.
The danger is that the IRS and state tax authorities may discover small-business 
owners’ negligence, sock them with big penalties, and disqualify their prior con￾tributions. Remember: Self-employed people and small businesses get their tax 
returns audited at a relatively high rate.
To get the most from contributions as an employer, consider the following advice:
» Educate your employees about the value of retirement savings plans. You 
want them to understand, but more importantly, you want them to appreciate 
your investment.232 PART 3 Building Wealth through Investing
» Select a profit-sharing plan that requires employees to stay a certain 
number of years before they vest fully in their contributions. Reward long￾term contributors to your company’s success.
» Consider offering a 401(k) or SIMPLE-IRA if you have 100 or fewer employ￾ees. An individual 401(k) plan may be an option if you’re a sole proprietor or 
just have partners with no employees other than the owner, a business 
partner, or a shareholder of a corporation and their respective spouses. If you 
want a plan that allows contributing after-tax dollars similar to a Roth IRA, 
there’s also Roth 401(k)s and individual Roth 401(k)s.
Making retirement contributions doesn’t have to increase your personnel costs. In 
the long run, you build the contributions you make for your employees into their 
total compensation package — which includes salary and benefits such as health 
insurance.
SEP-IRA (Simplified Employee Pension Individual Retirement Account) plans 
require little paperwork to set up. SEP-IRAs allow you to sock away 20 percent of 
your net self-employment income (business revenue minus deductions), up to a 
maximum of $66,000 (for tax year 2023). Future contribution limits will rise with 
inflation.
Each year, you decide the amount you want to contribute — with no minimums. 
Your contributions to a SEP-IRA are deducted from your taxable income, saving 
you big-time on federal and state taxes. As with other retirement plans, your 
money compounds without taxation until you withdraw it.
Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs)
Anyone with employment income can contribute to an Individual Retirement 
Account (IRA). You may contribute up to $6,500 each year — $7,500 if you’re age 
50 or older. If you earn less than these contribution limits, you can contribute up 
to the amount you earn. This rule has an exception if you’re a nonworking spouse: 
As long as the working spouse earns at least $13,000 in income ($15,000 if both 
people are at least age 50), the nonworking spouse can put up to $6,500 per year 
($7,500 if at least age 50) into a so-called spousal IRA; likewise, the working spouse 
can put up to $6,500 into their own IRA ($7,500 if at least age 50). Another excep￾tion to earning employment income makes you eligible to contribute to an IRA: 
receiving alimony.
Your contributions to an IRA may or may not be tax-deductible. For tax year 2023, 
if you’re single and your adjusted gross income is $73,000 or less for the year, you 
can deduct your full IRA contribution. If you’re married and file your taxes jointly, 
you’re entitled to a full IRA deduction if your AGI (adjusted gross income) is 
$116,000 per year or less. If you make more than these amounts, you can take a CHAPTER 12 Investing in Retirement Accounts 233
full IRA deduction if and only if you’re not an active participant in any other retire￾ment plan. The only way to know for certain whether you’re an active participant 
is to look at your W-2 Form  — that smallish (4-x-8½-inch) document your 
employer sends you early in the year to file with your tax returns. An “X” mark in 
a little box in Section 13 on that form indicates that you’re an active participant in 
an employer retirement plan.
If your adjusted gross income is higher than the previously mentioned amounts by 
less than $10,000 for singles ($20,000 for married couples filing jointly), you’re 
eligible for a partial IRA deduction, even if you’re an active participant in another 
plan. The IRS 1040 instruction booklet comes with a worksheet that allows you to 
do the calculations for your situation.
If you can’t deduct your contribution to a standard IRA, consider making a contri￾bution to a type of IRA called the Roth IRA. With the Roth IRA, the contribution is 
not deductible (you’re contributing after-tax dollars), but earnings inside the 
account are shielded from tax; and unlike a standard IRA, qualified withdrawals 
from the account, including investment earnings, are free from income tax. Single 
taxpayers with an AGI less than $138,000, and joint filers with an AGI less than 
$218,000 can contribute up to $6,500 per year to a Roth IRA ($7,500 for those age 
50 and older) if they have at least that amount in earned income. (Reduced con￾tributions are allowed for taxpayers with AGIs above these amounts up to $153,000 
for single taxpayers and $228,000 for married taxpayers filing jointly.)
To make a qualified (tax-free) withdrawal, you must be at least 59½ and have 
held the account for at least five years. An exception to the age rule is made for 
first-time home buyers, who can withdraw up to $10,000 toward the down pay￾ment on a principal residence.
Annuities: An odd investment
Annuities are peculiar investments. They’re contracts that are backed by an insur￾ance company. If you, the annuity holder (investor), die during the so-called accu￾mulation phase (that is, prior to receiving payments from the annuity), your 
designated beneficiary is guaranteed to receive the amount of your contribution. 
In this sense, annuities look a bit like life insurance.
Annuities, like IRAs, allow your capital to grow and compound without taxation. 
You defer taxes until withdrawal. Annuities carry the same penalties for with￾drawal prior to age 59½ as do other retirement accounts.
Unlike an IRA, which has an annual contribution limit, you can deposit as much as 
you want into an annuity in any year — even a million dollars or more if you have 
it! As with a so-called nondeductible IRA, you get no up-front tax deduction for 
your contributions.234 PART 3 Building Wealth through Investing
INAPPROPRIATE RETIREMENT ACCOUNT 
INVESTMENTS
Some investments for retirement accounts simply don’t make sense. Investments that 
produce income that is tax-free at either the federal or state level don’t generally make 
much sense inside retirement accounts. Because tax-free securities generally yield less 
than their taxable counterparts, you’re essentially giving away free yield when you invest 
in such securities inside retirement accounts.
Investing in municipal bonds inside a retirement account is a big no-no, and the better 
investment firms won’t let you make this mistake. Municipals are free from federal taxa￾tion (and state tax, too, if you buy such a bond issued in your state). As such, they yield 
significantly less than an equivalent bond that pays fully taxable dividends.
Some people make the mistake (albeit a smaller one) of investing in Treasuries — that 
is, U.S. Treasury bills, notes, or bonds — inside retirement accounts. When you buy 
Treasuries, you get the safety net of a government guarantee, but you also get a bond 
that produces interest free of state tax. Fully taxable bonds yield more than state-tax￾free Treasuries. And the safety of Treasuries can be replicated in other bonds.
Although annuities are retirement vehicles, as noted earlier in this chapter, they have no 
place inside retirement accounts. Annuities allow your investment dollars to compound 
without taxation. In comparison to other investments that don’t allow such tax deferral, 
annuities carry much higher annual operating expenses, which depress your returns.
Purchasing an annuity inside an IRA, 401(k), or other type of retirement account is like 
wearing a belt and suspenders together. Either you have a peculiar sense of style, or 
you’re spending too much time worrying about your pants falling down. In my experi￾ence, many people who mistakenly invest in annuities inside retirement accounts have 
been misled by investment salespeople.
Limited partnerships (LPs) are treacherous, high-commission, high-cost (and hence low￾return) investments sold through investment salespeople. Part of their supposed allure, 
however, is the tax benefits they generate. But when you buy and hold a limited part￾nership in a retirement account, you lose the ability to take advantage of many of the 
tax deductions. The illiquidity of LPs may also mean that you can’t make required retire￾ment account withdrawals when needed. These are just some of the many reasons to 
avoid investing in limited partnerships. (For more reasons, see Chapter 10.)CHAPTER 12 Investing in Retirement Accounts 235
Contributing to an annuity may make sense if
» You have exhausted contributions to employer-sponsored and self￾employed plans. Your contributions to these retirement accounts are 
tax-deductible, while annuity contributions aren’t.
» You have made the maximum contribution possible to an IRA, even if it’s 
not tax-deductible. Annuities carry higher fees than comparable IRA invest￾ments (which reduce your investment returns) because of the insurance that 
comes with them. Roth IRAs also allow for tax-free withdrawal of investment 
earnings.
» You expect to leave the money compounding in the annuity for at least 
15 years. It typically takes this long for the benefits of tax-deferred com￾pounding to outweigh the higher annuity fees and treatment of all withdrawn 
annuity earnings at the higher ordinary income tax rates. If you’re close to or 
are actually in retirement, tax-friendly investments made outside of retire￾ment accounts are preferable.
For details about other investment options and the best places to purchase annui￾ties, see Chapter  13, where I discuss investing money outside of retirement 
accounts.
Allocating Your Money 
in Retirement Plans
With good reason, people are concerned about placing their retirement account 
money in investments that can decline in value. You may feel that you’re gam￾bling with dollars intended for the security of your golden years.
Most working folks need to make their money work hard in order for it to grow 
fast enough to provide this security. This need involves taking some risk; you have 
no way around it. Luckily, if you have 15 to 20 years or more before you need to 
draw on the bulk of your retirement account assets, time is on your side. As long 
as the value of your investments has time to recover, what’s the big deal if some 
of your investments drop a bit over a year or two? The more years you have before 
you’re going to retire, the greater your ability to take risk.
Think of your retirement accounts as part of your overall plan to generate 
retirement income. Then allocate different types of investments between your 
tax-deferred retirement accounts and other taxable investment accounts to get 
the maximum benefit of tax deferral. This section helps you determine how to 
distribute your money in retirement plans. Chapter 9 can help you decide how to 236 PART 3 Building Wealth through Investing
divide your money among different nonretirement investment options based on 
your time frame and risk tolerance.
Prioritizing retirement contributions
When you have access to various retirement accounts, prioritize which account 
you’re going to use first by determining how much each gives you in return. Your 
first contributions should be to employer-based plans that match your contribu￾tions. After that, you should generally contribute to any other employer or 
self-employed plans that allow tax-deductible contributions. After you contribute 
to these tax-deductible plans (or if you don’t have access to such plans), consider 
an IRA. If you max out on contributions to an IRA or you don’t have this choice 
because you lack employment income, consider an annuity (see “Annuities: An 
odd investment” earlier in this chapter).
There are, of course, exceptions to these generalizations. Please see Chapter 8 for 
info on when funding retirement accounts makes sense.
Setting up a retirement account
Investments and account types are different issues. People sometimes get con￾fused when discussing the investments they make in retirement accounts  — 
especially people who have a retirement account, such as an IRA, at a bank. They 
don’t realize that you can have your IRA at a variety of financial institutions (for 
example, a mutual-fund company or investment brokerage firm). At each financial 
institution, you can choose among the firm’s investment options for putting your 
IRA money to work.
No-load, or commission-free, mutual-fund and discount brokerage firms are 
your best bets for establishing a retirement account. For more specifics, see my 
recommendations throughout the remainder of this chapter.
Allocating money when your employer 
selects the investment options
In some company-sponsored plans, such as 401(k)s, you’re typically limited to 
the predetermined investment options your employer offers. In the following sec￾tions, I discuss common investment options for 401(k) plans in order of increas￾ing risk and, hence, likely return. Then I follow with examples for how to allocate 
your money across the different types of common employer retirement plan 
options.CHAPTER 12 Investing in Retirement Accounts 237
Money market/savings accounts
For regular contributions that come out of your paycheck, the money-market or 
savings account option makes little sense. Some people who are skittish about the 
stock and bond markets are attracted to money-market and savings accounts 
because they can’t drop in value. However, the returns are low — so low that you 
have a notable risk that your investment will not stay ahead of, or even keep up 
with, inflation and taxes (which are due upon withdrawal of your money from the 
retirement account).
Don’t be tempted to use a money-market fund as a parking place until you think 
stocks and bonds are cheap. In the long run, you won’t be doing yourself any 
favors. As I discuss in Chapter 9, timing your investments to attempt to catch the 
lows and avoid the peaks isn’t possible.
You may need to keep money in the money-market investment option if you use 
the borrowing feature that some retirement plans allow. Check with your employee 
benefits department for more details. After you retire, you may also want to use a 
money-market account to hold money you expect to withdraw and spend within 
a year or so.
Bond mutual funds
Bond mutual funds (which I describe in Chapter 11) invest in a mixture of typically 
high-quality bonds. Bonds pay a higher rate of interest or dividends than money 
funds. Depending on whether your plan’s option is a short-term, intermediate￾term, or long-term fund (maybe you have more than one type), the bond fund’s 
current yield is probably a percent or two higher than the money-market fund’s 
yield. (Note: During certain time periods, the yield difference may be more, 
whereas during other time periods, it may be less.)
Bond funds carry higher yields than money-market funds, but they also carry 
greater risk because their value can fall if interest rates increase. However, bonds 
tend to be more stable in value over the shorter term (such as a few years) than 
stocks.
Aggressive, younger investors should keep a minimum amount of money in bond 
funds. Older folks who want to invest conservatively can place more money in 
bonds (see the asset allocation discussion in Chapter 9).
Guaranteed-investment contracts (GICs)
Guaranteed-investment contracts (GICs) are backed by an insurance company, 
and they typically quote you a rate of return projected one or a few years forward. 238 PART 3 Building Wealth through Investing
Thus, you don’t have the uncertainty that you normally face with bond or stock 
investments (unless, of course, the insurance company fails).
The attraction of these investments is that your account value doesn’t fluctuate 
(at least, not that you can see). Insurers normally invest your money mostly in 
bonds and maybe a bit in stocks. The difference between what these investments 
generate for the insurer and what they pay in interest to GIC investors is profit to 
the insurer. A GIC’s yield is usually comparable to that of a bond fund.
For people who hit the eject button the moment a bond fund slides a bit in value, 
GICs are soothing to the nerves. And they’re certainly higher yielding than a 
money-market or savings account.
Like bonds, however, GICs don’t give you the opportunity for much long-term 
growth above the rate of inflation. Over the long haul, you can expect to earn a 
better return in a mixture of bond and stock investments. In GICs, you pay for the 
peace of mind of a guaranteed return with lower long-term returns.
GICs also have another minor drawback: Insurance companies, unlike mutual 
funds, can and do fail, putting GIC investment dollars at risk. Some employers’ 
retirement plans have been burned by insurance company failures.
Balanced/target date mutual funds
Balanced mutual funds invest primarily in a mixture of stocks and bonds. This 
one-stop-shopping concept makes investing easier and reduces fluctuations in 
the value of your investments — funds investing exclusively in stocks or in bonds 
make for a rougher ride. These funds are solid options and, in fact, can be used for 
a significant portion of your retirement plan contributions. See Chapter 11 to find 
out more about balanced funds.
Some fund companies offer funds of funds known as a target date mutual fund.
These funds include a mixture of stocks and bonds; the mix gets gradually more 
conservative (less risky) over the years as a person nears retirement.
Stock mutual funds
Stock mutual funds invest in stocks, which often provide greater long-term 
growth potential but also wider fluctuations in value from year to year. Some 
companies offer a number of different stock funds, including funds that invest 
internationally or globally. Unless you plan to borrow against your funds to pur￾chase a home (if your plan allows), you should have a healthy helping of stock 
funds. See Chapter 11 for an explanation of the different types of stock funds as 
well as for details on how to evaluate a stock fund.CHAPTER 12 Investing in Retirement Accounts 239
Stock in the company you work for
Some companies offer employees the option of investing in the company’s stock. 
I generally advocate avoiding this option for the simple reason that your future 
income and other employee benefits are already riding on the success of the com￾pany. If the company hits the skids, you may lose your job and your benefits. You 
certainly don’t want the value of your retirement account to depend on the same 
factors.
In the early 2000s, you may have heard all the hubbub about companies such as 
Enron going under and employees losing piles of money in their retirement sav￾ings plans. Enron’s bankruptcy in and of itself shouldn’t have caused direct prob￾lems in Enron’s 401(k) plan. The problem was that Enron required employees to 
hold substantial amounts of Enron company stock. Thus, when the company 
tanked, employees lost their jobs and their retirement savings balances invested 
in their company’s stock.
Thanks to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), companies are 
no longer allowed to force employees to hold retirement plan money in company 
stock. Specifically, ERISA rules require companies to offer prudent and adequately 
diversified investments within their retirement savings plans. An option to invest 
in the employer’s stock can be offered, but investing in the stock is now strictly 
optional, and it must be one of numerous investment options offered to employees.
If you think that your company has its act together and the stock is a good buy, 
investing a portion of your retirement account is fine — but no more than 20 to 
25 percent. Now, if your company is on the verge of hitting it big and the stock is 
soon to soar, you’ll of course be kicking yourself for not putting more of your 
money into the company’s stock. But when you place a big bet on your company’s 
stock, be prepared to suffer the consequences if the stock tanks. Don’t forget that 
lots of smart investors track companies’ prospects, so odds are that the current 
value of your company’s stock is reasonably fair.
Some employers offer employees an additional option to buy company stock out￾side a tax-deferred retirement plan at a discount, sometimes as much as 15 percent 
when compared to its current market value. If your company offers a discount on 
its stock, take advantage of it. When you sell the stock, you’ll usually be able to 
lock in a decent profit over your purchase price.
Some asset allocation examples
Using the methodology that I outline in Chapter 9 for allocating money, Table 12-1 
shows a couple examples of how people in different employer plans may choose to 
allocate their 401(k) investments among the plan’s investment options.240 PART 3 Building Wealth through Investing
Note: Making allocation decisions isn’t a science. Use the formulas in Chapter 9 as 
a guideline.
Allocating money in plans you design
With self-employed plans (such as SEP-IRAs and self-employed 401(k)s), certain 
403(b) plans for nonprofit employees, and IRAs, you may select the investment 
options as well as the allocation of money among them. In the sections that fol￾low, I give some specific recipes that you may find useful for investing at some of 
the premier investment companies.
To establish your retirement account at one of these firms, investment firms pro￾vide downloadable account applications on their websites, and some allow you to 
complete the application online. Alternatively, you can call the company’s toll￾free number and ask the representative to mail you an account application for the 
type of account (for example, SEP-IRA, 403(b), and so on) you want to set up.
Note: In the examples, I make recommendations for a conservative portfolio and 
an aggressive portfolio for each firm. I use the terms conservative and aggressive in 
a relative sense. Because some of the funds I recommend don’t maintain fixed 
percentages of their different types of investments, the actual percentage of stocks 
and bonds that you end up with may vary slightly from the targeted percentages. 
Don’t sweat it.
Where you have more than one fund choice, you can pick one or split the sug￾gested percentage among them. If you don’t have enough money today to divvy up 
your portfolio as I suggest, you can achieve the desired split over time as you add 
more money to your retirement accounts.

shopping and the ability to hold funds from a variety of leading fund companies. 
SHOULD I USE MORE THAN ONE 
INVESTMENT FIRM?
The firms I recommend in this chapter offer a large-enough variety of investment 
options, managed by different fund managers, that you can feel comfortable concen￾trating your money at one firm. Your investments themselves aren’t at risk based on the 
financial health of the fund company itself. Discovering the nuances and choices of just 
one firm rather than several and having fewer administrative hassles are the advan￾tages of a focused approach.
If you like the idea of spreading your money around, you may want to invest through a 
number of different firms using a brokerage account (see Chapter 9). You can diversify 
across different mutual-fund companies through one brokerage firm. However, you’ll 
pay small transaction fees on some of your purchases and sales of funds.CHAPTER 12 Investing in Retirement Accounts 243
Some funds are available without transaction fees, although some of the better 
funds require you to pay a small transaction fee when you buy funds through a 
broker. The reason: The brokerage firm is a middleman between you and the fund 
companies. You have to weigh the convenience of being able to buy and hold funds 
from multiple fund companies in a single account versus the lower cost of buying 
funds directly from their providers. A $20 to $30 transaction fee can gobble a size￾able chunk of what you have to invest, especially if you’re investing smaller 
amounts.

breadth of fund offerings and competitive pricing, I like Fidelity (phone 800-343-

Transferring Retirement Accounts
Except for plans maintained by your current employer that limit your investment 
options, such as most 401(k)s, you can move your money held in an SEP-IRA, a 
self-employed 401(k), a traditional IRA, and many 403(b) plans (also known as 
tax-sheltered annuities) or 401(k) plans you hold at former employers to almost any 
major investment firm. Moving the money is pretty simple: If you can fill out 
some forms online or send them back in a postage-paid envelope, you can trans￾fer an account. The investment firm to which you’re transferring your account 
does the rest.
Transferring accounts you control
Here’s a step-by-step list of what you need to do to transfer a retirement account 
to another investment firm. Even if you’re working with a financial advisor, you 
should be aware of this process (called a direct trustee-to-trustee transfer) to ensure 
that no hanky-panky takes place on the advisor’s part and to ensure that the 
transfer is not taxable.
1. Decide where you want to move the account.
I recommend several investment companies in this chapter, along with some 
sample portfolios within those firms. You may also want to consult the latest 
editions of some of my other books, including Mutual Funds For Dummies and 
Investing For Dummies (Wiley) and visit my website at www.erictyson.com.
2. Obtain an account application and asset transfer form.
Call the toll-free number of the firm you’re transferring the money to and ask 
for an account application and asset transfer form for the type of account you’re 
transferring — for example, SEP-IRA, self-employed 401(k), IRA, 403(b), or 
401(k). You can also visit the firm’s website, but for this type of request, I think 
most people find it easier to speak directly to someone.
Ask for the form for the same type of account you currently have at the 
company from which you’re transferring the money. You can determine the 
account type by looking at a recent account statement — the account type 
should appear near the top of the statement or in the section with your name 
and address. If you can’t figure out the account type on a cryptic statement, call 
the firm where the account is currently held and ask a representative to tell 
you what kind of account you have.CHAPTER 12 Investing in Retirement Accounts 245
Never, ever sign over assets such as checks and security certificates to a 
financial advisor, no matter how trustworthy and honest they may seem. 
Transfers should not be completed this way. The advisor can bolt with them 
quicker than you can say “Bonnie and Clyde.” Besides, you’ll find the transfer 
easier by following the information in this section.
3. Figure out which securities you want to transfer and which need to be 
liquidated.
Transferring existing investments in your account to a new investment firm can 
sometimes be a little sticky. Transferring such assets as cash (money-market 
funds) or securities that trade on any of the major stock exchanges is not a 
problem.
If you own publicly traded securities, transferring them as is (also known as 
transferring them in kind) to your new investment firm is better, especially if 
the firm offers discount brokerage services. You can then sell your securities 
through that firm more cheaply.
If you own mutual funds unique to the institution you’re leaving, check with 
your new firm to see whether it can accept them. If not, you need to contact 
the firm that currently holds them to sell them.
Certificates of deposit are tricky to transfer. Ideally, you should send in the 
transfer forms several weeks or so before the CDs mature. If the CD matures 
soon, call the bank and tell it that when the CD matures, you would like the 
funds to be invested in a savings or money-market account that you can access 
without penalty when your transfer request lands in the bank’s mailbox.
4. Complete and mail the account application and asset transfer form.
Completing these for your new investment firm opens your new account and 
authorizes the transfer.
Don’t take possession of the money in your retirement account when moving it 
over to the new firm. The tax authorities impose huge penalties if you perform 
a transfer incorrectly. Let the company to which you’re transferring the money 
do the transfer for you. If you have questions or problems, the firm(s) to which 
you’re transferring your account has capable employees waiting to help you. 
Remember, these firms know that you’re transferring your money to them, 
so they should roll out the red carpet.
5. Let the firm from which you’re transferring the money know that you’re 
doing so. (This step is optional.)
If the place you’re transferring the money from doesn’t assign a specific person 
to your account, you can definitely skip this step. When you’re moving your 
investments from a brokerage firm where you dealt with a particular broker, 
deciding whether to follow this step can be more difficult.246 PART 3 Building Wealth through Investing
Most people feel obligated to let their representative know that they’re moving 
their money. In my experience, calling the person with the “bad news” is 
usually a mistake. Brokers or others who have a direct financial stake in your 
decision to move your money will try to convince you to stay. Some may try 
to make you feel guilty for leaving, and some may even try to bully you.
Writing an email or letter may seem like the coward’s way out, but writing 
usually makes leaving your broker easier for both of you. You can polish what 
you have to say, and you don’t put the broker on the defensive. Although 
I don’t want to encourage lying, not telling the whole truth may be an even 
better idea. Excuses, such as that you have a family member in the investment 
business who will manage your money, may help you avoid an uncomfortable 
confrontation.
Then again, telling an investment firm that its fees are too high or that it 
misrepresented and sold you a bunch of lousy investments may help the firm 
improve in the future. Don’t fret too much — do what’s best for you and what 
you’re comfortable with. Brokers are not your friends. Even though the broker 
may know your kids’ names, your favorite hobbies, and your birthday, you 
have a business relationship with that broker.
Transferring your existing assets typically takes two to four weeks to complete. If 
the transfer is not completed within one month, get in touch with your new 
investment firm to determine the problem. If your old company isn’t cooperating, 
call a manager there to help get the ball rolling.
The unfortunate reality is that an investment firm will cheerfully set up a new 
account to accept your money on a moment’s notice, but it will drag its feet, some￾times for months, when the time comes to relinquish your money. To light a fire 
under the behinds of the folks at the investment firm, tell a manager at the 
old firm that you’re going to send letters to the Financial Industry Regulatory 
Authority (FINRA) www.finra.com/contact_us and the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (SEC) www.sec.gov/ if it doesn’t complete your transfer within the 
next week.
Moving money from an employer’s plan
When you leave a job, particularly if you’re retiring or being laid off after many 
years of service, money-hungry brokers and financial planners probably will be 
on you like a pack of bears on a tree leaking sweet syrup. If you seek financial help, 
tread carefully  — Chapter  19 helps you avoid the pitfalls of hiring such 
assistance.CHAPTER 12 Investing in Retirement Accounts 247
When you leave a job, you’re confronted with a slightly different transfer chal￾lenge: moving money from an employer plan into one of your own retirement 
accounts. (As long as your employer allows it, you may be able to leave your money 
in your old employer’s plan. Evaluate the quality of the investment choices using 
the information I provide in this part of the book.) Typically, employer retirement 
plan money can be rolled over into your own IRA. Check with your employer’s 
benefits department or a tax advisor for details.
Federal tax law requires employers to withhold, as a tax, 20 percent of any retire￾ment account disbursements to plan participants. So if you personally take pos￾session of your retirement account money in order to transfer it to an IRA, you 
must wait until you file your annual tax return to be reimbursed by the govern￾ment for this 20-percent withholding. This withholding creates a problem, 
because if you don’t replace the 20-percent withholding into the rollover IRA and 
deposit the entire rollover within 60 days in the new account, the IRS treats the 
shortfall as an early distribution subject to income tax and penalties.
Never take personal possession of money from your employer’s retirement plan. 
To avoid the 20-percent tax withholding and a lot of other hassles, inform your 
employer of where you want your money to be sent. Prior to doing so, establish an 
appropriate account (an IRA, for example) at the investment firm you intend to 
use. Then tell your employer’s benefits department where you’d like your retire￾ment money transferred. You can send your employer a copy of your account 
statement, which contains the investment firm’s mailing address and your 
account number.CHAPTER 13 Investing in Taxable Accounts 249
Chapter 13
Investing in Taxable 
Accounts
I
n this chapter, I discuss investment choices for money held outside retirement 
accounts, and I include some sample portfolio recommendations. (Chapter 12 
reviews investments for money inside retirement accounts.) Thinking of these 
two types of investment accounts differently can be useful because
» Investments held outside retirement accounts are subject to taxation.
You have a whole range of different investment options to consider when 
taxes come into play.
» Money held outside retirement accounts is more likely to be used 
sooner than funds held inside retirement accounts. Why? Because you’ll 
generally have to pay more in income taxes to access money inside rather 
than outside retirement accounts. (And you may be subject to penalties if you 
need to make early withdrawals from retirement accounts.)
» Funds inside retirement accounts have their own nuances. For example, 
when you invest through your employer’s retirement plan, your investment 
options are usually limited to a handful of choices. And special rules govern 
the transfer of your retirement account balances.
IN THIS CHAPTER
» Taking advantage of overlooked 
attractive investments
» Factoring taxes into your investment 
decisions
» Bolstering your emergency reserves
» Looking at longer-term investment 
choices250 PART 3 Building Wealth through Investing
Getting Started
Suppose that you have some money sitting in a bank savings account or money￾market mutual fund, earning a small amount of interest, and you want to invest it 
more profitably. You need to remember two things about investing this type of 
money:
» Earning a little is better than losing 20 to 50 percent or more. Just talk to 
anyone who didn’t do their homework and ended up buying a lousy invest￾ment. Be patient. Educate yourself before you invest.
» To earn a higher rate of return, you must be willing to take more risk.
In order to earn a better rate of return, you need to consider investments that 
fluctuate in value — of course, the value can drop as well as rise.
Even if you don’t have delusions of grandeur, you’d at least like your money to 
grow faster than the cost of living. But before you invest, consider the following 
often overlooked ways to put your money to work and earn higher returns without 
much risk. These options may not be as exciting as hunting the big potential 
investment returns out there, but they can easily improve your financial health.
Paying off high-interest debt
Many folks have auto loans, credit-card, or other consumer debt. Paying off this 
debt with savings is like putting your money in an investment with a guaranteed 
return that’s equal to the interest rate you’re paying on the debt.
For example, if you have credit-card debt outstanding at 14-percent interest, pay￾ing off that loan is the same as putting your money to work in an investment with 
a sure 14-percent annual return. Remember that the interest on consumer debt is 
not tax-deductible, so you actually need to earn more than 14 percent investing 
your money elsewhere in order to net 14 percent after paying taxes. (See Chapter 6 
for more details if you’re still not convinced.)
Paying off some or all of your mortgage may make sense, too. This financial move 
isn’t as clear as erasing consumer debt, because the mortgage interest rate is 
lower than it is on consumer debt and is usually tax-deductible. (See Chapter 15 
for more details on this strategy.)CHAPTER 13 Investing in Taxable Accounts 251
Taking advantage of tax breaks
Make sure that you take advantage of the tax benefits offered on retirement 
accounts. If you work for a company that offers a retirement savings plan such as 
a 401(k), fund it at the highest level you can manage. If you earn self-employment 
income, consider a SEP-IRA. (I discuss retirement-plan options in Chapter 12.)
If you need to save money outside retirement accounts for shorter-term goals (for 
example, to buy a car or a home, or to start or buy a small business), then by all 
means, do so. This chapter can assist you with thinking through investing money 
in taxable accounts (nonretirement accounts exposed to taxation).
Understanding Taxes on Your Investments
When you invest money outside of a retirement account, investment distributions — 
such as interest, dividends, and capital gains — are subject to current taxation. 
Too many folks (and too many of their financial advisors) ignore the tax impact of 
their investment strategies. You need to pay attention to the tax implications of 
your investment decisions before you invest your money.
Consider a person in a combined 40-percent tax bracket (federal plus state taxes) 
who keeps extra cash in a taxable bond paying 4-percent interest. If they pay 
40 percent of their interest earnings in taxes (4 * 0.4 = 1.6), they end up keeping 
just 2.4 percent (4 – 1.6). With a similar but tax-free bond, they can earn more 
than this amount, completely free of federal and/or state taxes. (Make sure you do 
an apples-to-apples comparison: Both the taxable and tax-free bonds must be of 
similar risk, which means that they should have the same credit rating/risk of 
default and mature in about the same number of years.)
Another mistake some people make is investing in securities that produce 
tax-free income when they’re not in a high enough tax bracket to benefit. Now 
consider a person in a combined 20-percent tax bracket who’s investing in secu￾rities that produce tax-free income. Suppose they invest in a tax-free investment 
that yields 3 percent. A comparable taxable investment is yielding 5 percent. If 
they had instead invested in the taxable investment at a 5-percent yield, the 
after-tax yield would have been 4 percent. Thus, they’re losing out on yield by 
being in the tax-free investment that’s paying just 3 percent, even though they 
may feel happy in it because the yield isn’t taxed.252 PART 3 Building Wealth through Investing
To decide between comparable taxable and tax-free investments, you need 
to know your marginal tax bracket (the tax rate you pay on an extra dollar of 
taxable income) and the rates of interest or yield on each investment. (Check out 
Table 8-1 in Chapter 8 to see what federal income tax bracket you’re in.)
Fortifying Your Emergency Reserves
In Chapter 4, I explain the importance of keeping sufficient money in an emer￾gency reserve account. From such an account, you need two things:
» Accessibility: When you need to access your money for an emergency, you 
want to be able to do so quickly and without penalty.
» Highest possible return: You want to get the highest rate of return possible 
without risking your principal. This factor doesn’t mean that you should simply 
pick the money-market or savings option with the highest yield, because other 
issues, such as taxes, are a consideration. What good is earning a slightly 
higher yield if you pay a lot more in taxes?
The following sections give you information on investments that are suitable for 
emergency reserves.
Bank and credit union accounts
When you have a few thousand dollars or less, your best and easiest path may be 
to keep this excess savings in a local bank or credit union. Look first to the institu￾tion where you keep your checking account.
Keeping this stash of money in your checking account, rather than in a separate 
savings account, makes financial sense if the extra money helps you avoid monthly 
service charges when your balance occasionally dips below the minimum. Com￾pare the service charges on your checking account with the interest earnings from 
a savings account.
For example, suppose you’re keeping $4,000 in a savings account to earn 2 percent 
interest versus earning no interest on your checking account money. Over the 
course of a year, you earn $80 in interest on that savings account. If you incur a 
$12 per month service charge on your checking account, you pay $144 per year. So 
keeping your extra $4,000 in a checking account may be better financially if it 
keeps you above a minimum balance and erases that monthly service charge. CHAPTER 13 Investing in Taxable Accounts 253
(However, if you’re more likely to spend the extra money in your checking account, 
keeping it in a separate savings account where you won’t be tempted to spend it 
may be better.)
Money-market mutual funds
Money-market funds, a type of mutual fund (see Chapter 11), are just like bank 
savings accounts — but better, in most cases. The best money-market funds pay 
higher yields than bank savings accounts and allow check-writing. And if you’re 
in a high tax bracket, you can select a tax-free money-market fund, which pays 
interest that’s free from federal and/or state tax — a feature you can’t get with a 
bank savings account.
The yield on a money-market fund is an important consideration. The operating 
expenses deducted before payment of dividends is the single biggest determinant 
of yield. All other things being equal (which they usually are with different money￾market funds), lower operating expenses translate into higher yields for you.
Doing most or all of your fund shopping (money-market and otherwise) at one 
good fund company can reduce the clutter in your investing life. Chasing after a 
slightly higher yield offered by another company sometimes isn’t worth the extra 
administrative hassle. On the other hand, there’s no reason why you can’t invest 
in funds at multiple firms (as long as you don’t mind the extra work), using each 
for its relative strengths.
Most mutual-fund companies don’t have many local branch offices, so you may 
have to open and maintain your money-market mutual fund through the fund’s 
toll-free phone line, website, or the mail. Distance has its advantages. Because 
you can conduct business by mail, the internet, and the phone, you don’t need to 
go schlepping into a local branch office to make deposits and withdrawals. I’m 
happy to report that I haven’t visited a bank office in many years.
Despite the distance between you and your mutual-fund company, your money is 
still accessible via check-writing, and you can also have money electronically 
transferred to your local bank on any business day. Don’t fret about a deposit 
being lost in the mail; it rarely happens, and no one can legally cash a check made 
payable to you, anyway. Just be sure to endorse the check with the notation “for 
deposit only at Financial Institution name” on the back of the check. If you know 
the account number it’s going to, you can add that and make it exclusive to that 
account.254 PART 3 Building Wealth through Investing
Watch out for “sales”
Beware of money-market mutual funds that have a “sale” by temporarily waiving 
(sometimes called absorbing) operating expenses, which lets a fund boost its yield. 
These sales rarely last long; the operating expenses come back and deflate that 
too-good-to-be-true yield like a nail in a bike tire. Some fund companies run 
sales because they know that a major portion of the fund buyers who are lured in 
won’t bother leaving when they jack up operating expenses.
You’re better off sticking with funds that maintain “everyday low operating 
expenses” to get the highest long-term yield. I recommend such funds in the next 
section. However, if you want to move your money to companies having specials 
and then move it back out when the special is over, be my guest. If you have lots 
of money and don’t mind administration, it may be worth the bother.
Recommended money-market mutual funds
In this section, I recommend good money-market mutual funds. As you peruse 
this list, remember that the money-market fund that works best for you depends 
on your tax situation. Throughout the list, I try to guide you to funds that gener￾ally make sense for people in particular tax brackets.
» Money-market funds that pay taxable dividends are appropriate when 
you’re not in a high tax bracket. Some of my favorites include
• Fidelity Government Cash Reserves (phone 800-343-3548; website 
www.fidelity.com)
• T. Rowe Price Cash Reserves (phone 800-638-5660; website www.
troweprice.com)
• Vanguard Cash Reserves Federal Money Market (phone 877-662-7447; 
website www.vanguard.com)
» U.S. Treasury money-market funds are appropriate if you prefer a money 
fund that invests in U.S. Treasuries, which have the safety of government 
backing, or if you’re in a high state tax bracket (5 percent or higher) but not 
in a high federal tax bracket. Vanguard (phone 877-662-7447; website www.
vanguard.com) offers the Vanguard Treasury Money Market fund. Most 
leading fund companies offer Treasury money-market funds — compare the 
operating expense ratio and minimum initial investment requirement to 
Vanguard’s.
» State-focused tax-free money-market funds are appropriate when you’re 
in high federal and state tax brackets. Fidelity (phone 800-343-3548; website 
www.fidelity.com) and Vanguard (phone 877-662-7447; website www.
vanguard.com) offer the best selection.CHAPTER 13 Investing in Taxable Accounts 255
Residents of many states won’t find attractive state-specific money-market 
funds or won’t find any at all. In some cases, no options exist. In other cases, 
the funds available for that particular state have such high annual operating 
expenses, and therefore such low yields, that you’re better off in one of the 
more competitively run federal-tax-free-only funds that I note in the next bullet.
» Federal-tax-free-only money-market funds (the dividends on these are 
state taxable) are appropriate when you’re in a high federal but not state 
bracket, or if you live in a state that doesn’t have competitive state- and 
federal-tax-free funds available:

Investing for the Longer Term 
(Several Years or Decades)
Note: This section (together with its recommended investments) assumes that you 
have a sufficient emergency reserve stashed away and are taking advantage of 
tax-deductible retirement account contributions. (Please see Chapter 4 for more 
on these goals.)
Asset allocation refers to the process of figuring out what portion of your wealth to 
invest in different types of investments. You often (and most appropriately) prac￾tice asset allocation with retirement accounts, because this money is earmarked 
for the long term. Ideally, more of your saving and investing should be conducted 
through tax-sheltered retirement accounts. These accounts generally offer the 
best way to lower your long-term tax burden (see Chapter 12 for details).
If you plan to invest outside retirement accounts, asset allocation for these 
accounts depends on how comfortable you are with risk. But your choice of invest￾ments should also be suited to how much time you have until you plan to use the 
money. That’s not because you won’t be able to sell these investments on short 
notice if necessary (in most cases, you can). Investing money in a more volatile 
investment is simply riskier if you need to liquidate it in the short term.256 PART 3 Building Wealth through Investing
For example, suppose that you’re saving money for a down payment on a house 
and are about one to two years away from having enough to make your foray into 
the real-estate market. If you had put this “home” money into the U.S. stock mar￾ket near the beginning of one of the stock market’s 20- to 50-percent declines 
(such as what happened in 2008–2009, and in early 2020 or 2022), you’d have 
been mighty unhappy. You would have seen a substantial portion of your money 
vanish in short order and would’ve seen your home ownership dreams put on hold.
Defining your time horizons
The different investment options in the remainder of this chapter are organized 
by time frame. All the recommended investment funds that follow assume that 
you have at least a several-year time frame, and they’re all no-load (commission￾free) mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Funds can be sold on 
any business day, usually with a simple phone call or the click of a mouse. Funds 
come with all different levels of risk, so you can choose funds that match 
your time frame and desire to take risk. (Chapter 11 discusses all the basics of 
mutual funds.)
The recommended investments are also organized by your tax situation. (If you 
don’t know your current tax bracket, be sure to review Chapter 8.) Following are 
summaries of the different time frames associated with each type of fund:
» Short-term investments: These investments are suitable for a period of a 
few years — perhaps you’re saving money for a home or some other major 
purchase in the near future. When investing for the short term, look for 
liquidity and stability — features that rule out real estate and stocks. 
Recommended investments include shorter-term bond funds, which are 
higher-yielding alternatives to money-market funds. If interest rates increase, 
these funds drop slightly in value — a couple of percent or so (unless rates 
rise tremendously). I also discuss Treasury bonds and certificates of deposit 
(CDs) later in this chapter.
» Intermediate-term investments: These investments are appropriate for 
more than a few years but less than ten years. Investments that fill the bill 
are intermediate-term bonds and well-diversified hybrid funds (which include 
some stocks as well as bonds).
» Long-term investments: If you have a decade or more for investing your 
money, you can consider potentially higher-return (and therefore riskier) 
investments. Stocks, real estate, and other growth-oriented investments 
can earn the most money if you’re comfortable with the risk involved. See 
Chapter 9 for information on investing the portion that you intend to hold 
for the long term.CHAPTER 13 Investing in Taxable Accounts 257
Bonds and bond funds
Bond funds that pay taxable dividends are generally appropriate when you’re not 
in a high tax bracket. Here are some of my favorites:
» Short-term: Vanguard Short-Term Investment-Grade (phone 877-662-7447; 
website www.vanguard.com)
» Intermediate-term: Dodge & Cox Income (phone 800-621-3979; website 
www.dodgeandcox.com); Vanguard Total Bond Market Index (phone 877-662-
7447; website www.vanguard.com)
» Long-term: Vanguard Long-Term Investment-Grade (phone 877-662-7447; 
website www.vanguard.com)
Please note that Vanguard also offers ETF versions of many of its leading bond 
funds. The following sections discuss other bond funds, as well as the individual 
bonds you can buy through Treasury Direct.
U.S. Treasury bond funds
U.S. Treasury bond funds are appropriate if you prefer a bond fund that invests in 
U.S. Treasuries (which have the safety of government backing), or when you’re in 
a high state tax bracket (5 percent or higher) but not a high federal tax bracket. For 
good Treasury bond funds, the Vanguard Group, which offers short-, intermediate-, 
and long-term U.S.  Treasury funds with a low 0.2-percent operating expense 
ratio. With a $50,000 minimum, Vanguard’s Admiral series of U.S. Treasury funds 
offers higher yields thanks to an even lower expense ratio of 0.1 percent.
Buying Treasuries from the Federal Reserve Bank

get through the thrifty Vanguard Treasury funds, try this: Purchase Treasuries 
directly from the Federal Reserve Bank. To open an account through the Treasury

You do sacrifice a bit of liquidity, however, when purchasing Treasury bonds 
directly from the government. You can sell your bonds prior to maturity; however, 
you’ll have to go through the hassle of having your Treasury bond(s) transferred 
to a brokerage account and you’ll pay brokerage fees to sell them. If you want daily 
access to your money, buy a recommended Vanguard fund and pay the company’s 
low management fee.258 PART 3 Building Wealth through Investing
INFLATION-INDEXED TREASURY BONDS
Like a handful of other nations, the U.S. Treasury offers inflation-indexed government 
bonds. Because a portion of these Treasury bonds’ return is pegged to the rate of infla￾tion, the bonds offer investors a safer type of Treasury bond investment option.
To understand the relative advantages of an inflation-indexed bond, take a brief look at 
the relationship between inflation and a regular bond. Investors who purchase regular 
bonds are committing to a fixed payment over a set period of time — for example, a 
bond that matures in ten years and pays 5 percent interest. However, changes in the 
cost of living (inflation) aren’t fixed, so they’re difficult to predict.
Suppose that an investor put $10,000 into a regular bond in the 1970s. During the life of 
the bond, the investor would’ve unhappily watched inflation escalate. During the time 
the bond was held and by the time it matured, the bond holder would’ve witnessed the 
erosion of the purchasing power of $500 of annual interest and $10,000 of returned 
principal.
Enter the inflation-indexed Treasury bond. Suppose that you have $10,000 to invest 
and you buy a ten-year, inflation-indexed bond that pays you a “real” rate of return (the 
return above and beyond the rate of inflation) of, say, 2 percent (or $200). This portion 
of your return is paid out in interest. The other portion of your return is from the 
inflation adjustment to the principal you invested. The inflation portion of the return 
gets put back into the principal. So if inflation were running at about 2 percent, your 
$10,000 of principal would be indexed upward after one year to $10,200. In the second 
year of holding this bond, the 2-percent real return of interest ($204), would be paid on 
the increased ($10,200) principal base.
If inflation skyrocketed and was running at, say, 8 percent (as happened back in the 
1970s and early 1980s and in 2022) rather than 2 percent per year, your principal 
balance would grow 8 percent per year, and you’d still get your 2-percent real rate 
of return on top of that. Thus, an inflation-indexed Treasury bond investor doesn’t 
see the purchasing power of their invested principal or annual interest earnings 
eroded by unexpected inflation.
The inflation-indexed Treasuries can be a good investment for conservative bond 
investors who are worried about inflation, as well as taxpayers who want to hold the 
government accountable for increases in inflation. The downside: Inflation-indexed 
bonds may yield slightly lower returns because they’re less risky compared to regular 
Treasury bonds.CHAPTER 13 Investing in Taxable Accounts 259
State- and federal-tax-free bond funds
State- and federal-tax-free bond funds are appropriate when you’re in high fed￾eral and state (5 percent or higher) tax brackets. Vanguard (phone 877-662-7447; 
website www.vanguard.com) has the best selection of state-specific tax-free bond 
funds. Also check out T. Rowe Price (phone; website www.troweprice.com) and 
Fidelity (phone 800-343-3548; website www.fidelity.com), which offer some of 
the better state-specific bond funds.
Federal-tax-free-only bond funds
Federal-tax-free-only bond funds (the dividends on them are state-taxable) are 
appropriate when you’re in a high federal bracket but a low state bracket (less 
than 5 percent) or when you live in a state that doesn’t have state- and federal￾tax-free funds available. Vanguard (phone 877-662-7447; website www.
vanguard.com) offers the best selection of federal-tax-free bond funds.
Certificates of deposit (CDs)
For past generations, bank CDs have been a popular investment for folks with 
some extra cash that isn’t needed in the near future. With a CD, you generally get 
a higher rate of return than you get on a bank savings account. And unlike with 
bond funds, your principal doesn’t fluctuate in value.
A certificate of deposit (CD) is another type of bond that’s issued by a bank. With 
a CD, as with a real bond, you agree to lend your money to an organization (in this 
case, a bank) for a predetermined number of months or years. Generally, the lon￾ger you agree to lock up your money, the higher the interest rate you receive.
Compared to bonds, however, CDs have a couple drawbacks:
» Inaccessibility: In a CD, your money isn’t accessible unless you cough up a 
fairly big penalty — typically six months’ interest. With a no-load (commission￾free) bond fund, you can access your money without penalty — whether you 
need some or all your money next week, next month, or next year.
» Taxability: CDs come in only one tax flavor — taxable. Bonds, on the other 
hand, come in tax-free (federal and/or state) and taxable flavors. So if you’re a 
higher-tax-bracket investor, bonds offer you a tax-friendly option that CDs can’t.260 PART 3 Building Wealth through Investing
In the long run, you can expect to earn more — perhaps 1 to 2 percent more per 
year — and have better access to your money in bond funds than in CDs. Bond 
funds make particular sense when you’re in a higher tax bracket and you’d benefit 
from tax-free income on your investments. If you’re not in a high tax bracket and 
you have a bad day whenever your bond fund takes a dip in value, consider CDs. 
Just make sure that you shop around to get the best interest rate.
One final piece of advice: Don’t buy CDs simply for the FDIC (Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corporation) insurance. Much is made, particularly by banks, of the 
FDIC government insurance that comes with bank CDs. The lack of this insurance 
on high-quality bonds shouldn’t be a big concern for you. High-quality bonds 
rarely default; even if a fund were to hold a bond that defaulted, that bond would 
probably represent only a tiny fraction (less than 1 percent) of the value of the 
fund, having little overall impact.
Besides, the FDIC itself is no Rock of Gibraltar. Banks have failed and will continue 
to fail. Yes, you are insured if you have less than $250,000 in a bank. However, if 
the bank fails, you may have to wait some time and settle for less interest than you 
thought you were getting. You’re not immune from harm, FDIC or no FDIC.
If the government backing you receive through FDIC insurance provides you with 
peace of mind, you can invest in Treasuries (see “Bonds and bond funds” earlier 
in this chapter), which are government-backed bonds.
Stocks and stock funds
Stocks have stood the test of time for building wealth. (In Chapter 10, I discuss 
picking individual stocks versus investing through stock funds.) Remember that 
when you invest in stocks in taxable (nonretirement) accounts, all the distribu￾tions on those stocks, such as dividends and capital gains, are taxable. Stock divi￾dends and long-term capital gains do benefit from lower tax rates (the maximum 
20 percent plus 3.8 percent in Obamacare taxes for high-income earners).
Some stock-picking advocates argue that you should shun stock funds due to tax 
considerations. I disagree. You can avoid stock funds that generate a lot of short￾term capital gains, which are taxed at the relatively high ordinary income tax 
rates. Additionally, several fund companies offer lower cost and tax-friendly stock 
funds, which are appropriate if you don’t want current income or you’re in a high 
federal tax bracket and seek to minimize receiving taxable distributions on your 
funds. Vanguard (phone 877-662-7447; website www.vanguard.com) offers the 
best menu of tax-managed stock funds. Alternatively, you can invest in a wider 
variety of diversified stock funds inside an annuity (see the following section). 
Also consider some of the stock funds I recommend in Chapter 12.CHAPTER 13 Investing in Taxable Accounts 261
Annuities
As I discuss in Chapter 12, annuities are accounts that are partly insurance but 
mostly investment. Consider contributing to an annuity only after you exhaust 
contributions to all your available retirement accounts. Because annuities carry 
higher annual operating expenses than comparable mutual funds, you should 
consider them only if you plan to leave your money invested, preferably for 
15 years or more. Even if you leave your money invested for that long, the tax￾friendly funds discussed in the previous sections of this chapter can allow your 
money to grow without excessive annual taxation.
The best annuities can be purchased from no-load (commission-free) mutual 
fund companies such as Vanguard (phone 877-662-7447; website www.vanguard.
com) or Fidelity (phone 800-343-3548; website www.fidelity.com). Also check 
out the annuities offered by the leading discount brokerage firms such as Charles 
Schwab (phone 888-311-4889; website www.schwab.com).
Real estate
Real estate can be a financially and psychologically rewarding investment. It can 
also be a money pit and a real headache if you buy the wrong property or get a 
“tenant from hell.” (I discuss the investment particulars of real estate in 
Chapter 10 and the nuts and bolts of buying real estate in Chapter 15.)
Small-business investments
Investing in your own business or someone else’s established small business can 
be a high-risk but potentially high-return investment. The best options are those 
you understand well. See Chapter 10 for more information about small-business 
investments.CHAPTER 14 Investing for Educational Expenses 263
Chapter 14
Investing for Educational 
Expenses
I
f you’re like most parents (or potential future parents), just turning to this 
chapter makes you anxious. Such trepidation is understandable. According to 
much of what you read about educational expenses (particularly college 
expenses), if costs keep rising at the current rate, you’ll soon have to spend 
upward of $400,000 to give your youngster a quality college education. (And, if 
you add in graduate school, you could be pushing $500,000 to $600,000 or, gasp, 
even more.)
Whether you’re about to begin a regular college investment plan or you’ve already 
started saving, your emotions may lead you astray. The hype about educational 
costs may scare you into taking a financially detrimental path. However, quality 
education for your child doesn’t have to — and probably won’t — cost you as 
much as those gargantuan projections suggest. Increasing numbers of lower cost 
alternatives to high-priced four-year colleges are providing attractive career 
opportunities.
IN THIS CHAPTER
» Grasping the increasing number of 
higher education options
» Understanding the financial aid 
system
» Figuring out how much you need 
to save
» Exploring educational investment 
options264 PART 3 Building Wealth through Investing
In this chapter, I explain the range of higher-education options and alternatives, 
decode the inner workings of the financial aid system, help you gauge how much 
money you’ll need, and discuss educational investment options so you can keep a 
cool head (and some money in your pocket) when all is said and done.
Exploring Higher-Education Options
The traditional four-year college path is expensive, and for increasing numbers of 
families, it’s hard to justify the price tag. More folks have been realizing that col￾lege simply isn’t the only way to prepare for a rewarding career. As college price 
increases have outstripped general inflation for too many years, many have 
already been questioning the return on investment, and alternatives to the four￾year degree have grown quickly over recent decades.
I urge you to investigate college alternatives and consider all your child’s options 
so you can make an informed choice. Some of the programs available today have 
been around for generations while others are new and emerging. For example:
» Last-mile programs, including “boot camps”: The most popular last-mile 
programs are “boot camps” that focus mostly on coding — a high-in-demand 
skill. Coding boot camps are full-time endeavors. Classes are small, and most 
of the time is spent working in teams on projects. Other boot camps, for 
example, conduct training for technology sales or careers in the medical 
device industry. While boot camps/last-mile programs cost an average of 
around $13,000 (some charge a modest portion of post-training earnings for 
a few years), that’s a bargain compared with the cost of traditional colleges.
» College minimum viable products (MVPs): College minimum viable product 
(MVP) programs combine the technical skill training and placement of 
traditional last-mile programs with sufficient cognitive and non-cognitive 
skill development that students get from a good college. Graduates of these 
programs pay through income-share arrangements in which they repay 
money owed to the program through paying a small portion of their employ￾ment income, typically for several years.
» Apprenticeships: Once relegated to industrial trades such as electricians, 
plumbers, carpenters, and iron and steel workers, apprenticeships are gaining 
momentum in industries like advanced manufacturing, healthcare, pharmacy, 
and IT. We’re also seeing some apprenticeship programs in the financial 
services industry.CHAPTER 14 Investing for Educational Expenses 265
» Vocational and trade schools. Also known as career and technical education 
(CTE), vocational and trade schools provide gateways to a wide range of jobs. 
They typically exist in several different entities, including community colleges, 
high schools, and other area CTE centers, and are constantly evolving to meet 
the changing economic environment and jobs that exist today. Examples of 
jobs vocational and trade schools provide training for include auto repair 
technician, chef, firefighter, paramedic, police officer, nurse, dental hygienist, 
pharmacy technician, and veterinary technician. Other skilled vocational jobs 
include welding, plumbing, carpentry, construction management, pipe-fitting, 
machining, computer-aided drafting, and network administration, as well as 
training to become an electrician, a web designer, a civil engineering techni￾cian, a paralegal, or a court reporter.
The growing “alternatives” trend is good for you, the education consumer. Com￾petition for your time and dollars is slowly spurring some positive changes at 
colleges and universities, as it should. Colleges should earn your business — not 
get it by default. Traditional colleges and universities are not the only pathways to 
success. Keep an open mind about the alternatives available to your child because 
they, too, can lead to career satisfaction.
Figuring Out How the Financial 
Aid System Works
Because of the unusual way in which colleges set pricing for each individual fam￾ily, your child shouldn’t choose to apply to a college on the basis of whether you 
think you can afford it. Except for the affluent who have plenty of cash available 
to pay for the full cost of college, everyone else should apply for “financial aid,” 
which is a bit of a misnomer because colleges aren’t actually giving you money. 
What they are really doing is reducing their high list price to a lower and more 
reasonable level. Suppose you’re looking at a highly rated private college that has 
total charges of $60,000 per year. The average student’s family typically pays 
about half of that amount (for example, $30,000). This occurs because the 
families that pay the full or near full amount are effectively subsidizing those who 
pay far less than the average amount.
More than a few parents who don’t think that they qualify for financial aid 
(for instance, lower prices) are pleasantly surprised to find that their children 
have access to loans as well as grants, which don’t have to be repaid. (And your 
ability to pay often isn’t even considered when scholarship committees hand out 
money  — see “Tips for getting loans, grants, and scholarships” later in this 
chapter for info on scholarships.)266 PART 3 Building Wealth through Investing
Completing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), which is avail￾able from any high school or college, is the first step in the financial aid process. 
(Internet users can fill out the form online at studentaid.gov/h/apply-for￾aid/fafsa.) As its name implies, you pay nothing for submitting this application 
other than the time to complete the paperwork. Some schools also supplement the 
FAFSA with the College Board’s CSS Profile form; these forms are mainly used by 
costly private schools to differentiate need among financial aid applicants.
States have their own financial aid programs, so apply to these programs as well 
if your child plans to attend an in-state college. You and your child can check with 
your local high school or college financial aid office to get the necessary forms. 
Some colleges also require submission of supplementary forms directly to them.
The data you supply through student aid forms is run through a financial needs 
analysis, a standard methodology approved by the U.S. Congress. The needs analy￾sis considers a number of factors, such as your income and assets, age and need 
for retirement income, number of dependents, number of family members in col￾lege, and unusual financial circumstances, which you explain on the application.
The financial needs analysis calculates how much money you, as the parent(s), 
and your child, as the student, are expected to contribute toward educational 
expenses. Even if the needs analysis determines that you don’t qualify for need￾based financial aid, you may still have access to loans that are not based on need 
if you go through the financial aid application process. So make sure you apply for 
financial aid!
Treatment of retirement accounts
Under the current financial needs analysis, the value of your retirement plans is 
not considered an asset. By contrast, money that you save outside retirement 
accounts, especially money in the child’s name, is counted as an asset and reduces 
financial aid eligibility and increases the price colleges will charge you.
Therefore, forgoing contributions to your retirement savings plans in order to 
save money in a taxable account for Junior’s college fund doesn’t make sense. 
When you do, you pay higher taxes both on your current income and on the inter￾est and growth of the college fund money. In addition to paying higher taxes, 
you’re expected to contribute more to your child’s educational expenses.
Let me stress the need to get an early start on saving for retirement. Most retire￾ment accounts limit how much you can contribute each year. See Chapter 12 for 
more on saving for your golden years.CHAPTER 14 Investing for Educational Expenses 267
Treatment of money in the kids’ names
If you plan to apply for financial aid, save money in your name rather than in your 
children’s names (such as via custodial accounts). Colleges expect a much greater 
percentage of the money in your children’s names (20 percent) to be used annu￾ally for college costs than the money in your name (about 6 percent).
However, if you’re affluent enough to foot your child’s college bill without outside 
help, investing in your kid’s name can save you some money in taxes. Read on.
Traditional custodial accounts
Parents control a custodial account until the child reaches either the age of 18 or 21, 
depending upon the state in which you reside. For 2023, prior to your child reach￾ing age 18, the first $1,250 of interest and dividend income generally isn’t taxed, 
and the next $1,250 is taxed at the child’s low tax rate. Any unearned income above 
$2,500 is taxed federally at the relatively high rates that apply to trusts and estates 
(see the following bulleted list). Upon reaching age 18 (or age 24 if your offspring 
are still full-time students), all income generated by investments in your child’s 
name is taxed at your child’s rate, which is presumably a lower tax rate.
Over the $2,500 threshold, unearned income is taxed at these rates:
» Up to $2,900 falls into the 10 percent bracket.
» Between $2,900 and $10,550 is in the 24 percent bracket.
» Between $10,550 and $14,450 is in the 35 percent bracket.
» Above $14,450 is in the 37 percent bracket.
State-sponsored college savings plans: 529
The 529 plans (named after Internal Revenue Code Section 529 and also known as 
qualified state tuition plans) are educational savings plans. A parent or grandparent 
can generally put more than $300,000 per beneficiary into one of these plans. Up 
to $85,000 per donor or $150,000 per married couple may be placed in a child’s 
college savings account immediately, and this amount counts for the next five 
years’ worth of $17,000 annual tax-free gifts per donor allowed under current 
gifting laws. (Money contributed to the account is not considered part of the 
donor’s taxable estate. However, if the donor gives $85,000 and then dies before 
five years are up, a proportionate amount of that gift will be charged back to the 
donor’s estate.)268 PART 3 Building Wealth through Investing
Of course, you can contribute much smaller amounts to a 529 plan if you so desire. 
But before you jump into one of these plans, you should understand and weigh the 
overall tax and financial aid consequences of doing so.
The attraction of the 529 plans is that money inside the plan compounds without 
tax, and if it’s used to pay for college tuition, room and board, and other related 
qualifying higher-education (post-secondary) expenses, the investment earnings 
and appreciation can be withdrawn tax-free. You can generally invest in any state 
plan to pay college expenses in any state, regardless of where you live.
In addition to paying college costs, the money in 529 plans may be used for grad￾uate school expenses and up to $10,000 annually toward K–12 expenses at private 
schools. Some states provide additional tax benefits on contributions to their 
state-sanctioned plan.
Unlike the money in a custodial account, with which a child may do as they please 
when they reach either the age of 18 or 21 (the age varies by state), these state tui￾tion plans must be used for higher-education expenses. However, most state 
plans do allow you to change the beneficiary. You can also take the money out of 
the plan if you change your mind. (You will, however, owe tax on the withdrawn 
earnings plus a penalty — typically 10 percent.)
A potential drawback of the 529 plans — especially for families hoping for some 
financial aid — is that college financial aid offices treat assets in these plans as 
parental nonretirement assets. If your family isn’t wealthy and you aren’t fully 
funding your retirement accounts, you gain better tax benefits and help your 
financial aid profile if you instead put your extra dollars into your retirement 
account(s). Also, be aware that the assets can be considered as belonging to an 
older child (independent young adult) who no longer reports parental financial 
information for financial aid purposes.
With some plans, you can’t control how the money is invested, although this may 
be a positive. The farther your child is from college age, the more aggressive the 
investment mix. As your child approaches college age, the investment mix is tilted 
to more conservative investments. The best plans offer both individually selected 
investments and age-based options.
Some state plans have high investment management fees, and some plans don’t 
allow transfers to other plans. Avoid such plans. Look for proven low-cost, per￾forming investment options from companies such as Fidelity, TIAA-CREF, T. Rowe 
Price, and Vanguard.
Please also be aware that a future Congress can change the tax laws affecting 
these plans, diminishing the tax breaks or increasing the penalties for nonquali￾fied withdrawals.CHAPTER 14 Investing for Educational Expenses 269
Clearly, these plans have both pros and cons. They generally make the most sense 
for affluent parents (or grandparents) who don’t expect their children to qualify 
for financial aid. Do a lot of research and homework before investing in any plan. 
Check out the investment track record, allocations, and fees of each plan, as well 
as restrictions on transferring to other plans or changing beneficiaries. (See my 
website at www.erictyson.com for more information on these plans.) Parents who 
do establish a 529 plan should be careful on financial aid forms to list those assets 
as their own and not the child’s to avoid harming their aid chances even more, as 
explained earlier in this chapter.
Treatment of home equity and other assets
Your family’s assets may include equity in real estate and businesses that you 
own. Although the federal financial aid analysis no longer counts equity in your 
primary residence as an asset, many private (independent) schools continue to 
ask parents for this information when making their own financial aid determina￾tions. Therefore, paying down your home mortgage more quickly instead of fund￾ing retirement accounts can harm you financially: You may end up with less 
financial aid and a higher tax bill.
Strategizing to Pay for Educational 
Expenses
Now I get more specific about what college may cost your kids and how you’re 
going to pay for it. I don’t have just one solution, because how you help pay for 
your child’s college costs depends on your own unique situation and personal 
philosophy. However, in most cases, you may have to borrow some money, even if 
you have some available cash that can be directed to pay the college bills as you 
receive them.
Ask yourself what the best way is to help pay for college and what you want/expect 
in the way of contribution(s) from your children. Even parents who can afford to 
pay the entire cost often require their children to contribute something meaning￾ful in terms of cost — whether from savings over summer work, loans, and so on. 
This strategy increases the chances of the kids having more focus via some “skin 
in the game” and helps ensure that they don’t walk away after four or five years 
with a degree but no appreciation, direction, or purpose.270 PART 3 Building Wealth through Investing
Estimating college costs
College can cost a lot. The total costs — including tuition, fees, books, supplies, 
room, board, and transportation  — vary substantially from school to school. 
The  total average annual cost is running around $59,000 per year at private 
colleges and around $29,000 at public colleges and universities (at the in-state 
rate). The more expensive schools can cost up to about one-third more. Ouch!
Is all this expense worth it?
Of course, not all education is created equal, and you should consider the fit of a 
given educational experience with your goals.
Colleges are slowly finding themselves subject to the same types of competition 
that companies confront. As a result, some colleges are beginning to clamp down 
on rising costs. As with any other product or service purchase, it pays to shop 
around. You can find good values — colleges that offer competitive pricing and
provide a quality education. Although you don’t want your offspring to choose a 
college simply because it costs less, you also shouldn’t allow a college choice 
without any consideration of cost.
When considering spending money on a college or other degree, do some digging 
regarding the value of particular colleges and degree programs. Numerous 
resources are available for doing this research. Among those that I’ve reviewed 
and found useful are the following:
» Forbes’ “Best Value Colleges” ranking compares and ranks colleges and 
universities based upon costs, school quality, post-grad earnings, 
student debt loads, and graduation success. Visit www.forbes.com/
value-colleges/list.
» PayScale, the large online salary and benefits information collector, 
ranks colleges and majors on a return-on-investment basis over 20 years. 
Visit www.payscale.com/college-roi.
Setting realistic savings goals
If you have money left over after taking advantage of retirement accounts, by all 
means, try to save for your children’s college costs. You should save in your name 
unless you know you aren’t going to apply for financial aid, including those loans 
that are available regardless of your economic situation.
Be realistic about what you can afford for college expenses given your other 
financial goals, especially saving for retirement (see Chapter  4). Being able to 
personally pay 100 percent of the cost of a college education, especially at a CHAPTER 14 Investing for Educational Expenses 271
four-year private college, is a luxury of the affluent. If you’re not a high-income 
earner, consider trying to save enough to pay a third or, at most, half of the cost. 
You can make up the balance through loans, your child’s employment before and 
during college, and the like.
Use Table 14-1 to help get a handle on how much you should be saving for college.
Tips for getting loans, grants, 
and scholarships
A host of financial aid programs, including a number of loan programs, allow you 
to borrow at reasonable interest rates. Federal government educational loans have 
variable interest rates — which means that the interest rate you’re charged floats, or 
varies, with the overall level of interest rates. Most programs add a few percent to 
the current interest rates on three-month to one-year Treasury bills. Thus, cur￾rent rates on educational loans for students are in the vicinity of rates charged on 
fixed-rate mortgages (parents’ loan rates are a little higher). The rates are also 
capped so the interest rate on your student loan can never exceed several percent 
more than the initial rate on the loan.
A number of loan programs, such as unsubsidized Stafford loans and Parent Loans 
for Undergraduate Students (PLUS), are available even when your family is not 
deemed financially needy. Only subsidized Stafford loans, on which the federal 
government pays the interest that accumulates while the student is still in school, 
are limited to students deemed financially needy.

to tack 20 to 30 percent onto the average figures.
**The amount you need to save (calculated in line 5) “in today’s dollars” does need to be increased once per year to 
reflect the increase in college inflation — 3 to 4 percent should do.272 PART 3 Building Wealth through Investing
Most loan programs limit the amount that you can borrow per year, as well as the 
total you can borrow for a student’s educational career. If you need more money 
than your limits allow, PLUS loans can fill the gap: Parents can borrow the full 
amount needed after other financial aid is factored in. The only obstacle is that 
you must go through a credit qualification process. Unlike privately funded college 
loans, you can’t qualify for a federal loan if you have negative credit (recent bank￾ruptcy, more than three debts over three months past due, and so on). For more 
information from the federal government about these student loan programs, call

If you’re a homeowner, you may be able to borrow against the equity (market value 
minus the outstanding mortgage loan) in your property. This option is useful 
because you can borrow against your home at a reasonable interest rate, and the 
interest is generally tax-deductible subject to IRS limits (typically on up to 
$750,000 of mortgage debt). Some company retirement plans  — for example, 
401(k)s — allow borrowing as well.
Parents are allowed to make penalty-free withdrawals from individual retirement 
accounts if the funds are used for college expenses. Although you won’t be charged 
an early-withdrawal penalty, the IRS (and most states) will treat the amount 
withdrawn as taxable income. On top of that, the financial aid office will look at 
your beefed-up income and assume that you don’t need as much financial aid. 
Because of these negative ramifications, funding college costs in this fashion 
should only be done as an absolute last resort.
In addition to loans, a number of grant programs are available through schools, 
the government, and independent sources. A grant effectively reduces your 
out-of-pocket cost. You can apply for federal government grants via the FAFSA 
(see “Figuring Out How the Financial Aid System Works,” earlier in this chapter). 
Grants available through state government programs may require a separate 
application. Scholarships have the same impact as a grant in that they reduce the 
cost of attending a given college. Specific colleges and other private organizations 
(including employers, banks, credit unions, and community groups) also offer 
grants and scholarships.
One of the most important aspects of getting financial aid is choosing to apply, 
even if you’re not sure whether you qualify. You may be able to lower your expected 
contribution by reducing your qualifying assets. (For more information on how 
those in charge of handing out financial aid evaluate how much of the bill you can 
foot, see “Figuring Out How the Financial Aid System Works.”)CHAPTER 14 Investing for Educational Expenses 273
Many scholarships and grants don’t require any extra work on your part — simply 
apply for financial aid through colleges. Other aid programs need seeking out — 
check with your child’s school counseling department, and college financial aid 
offices. You can also contact local organizations, churches, employers, and so on. 
You have a better chance of getting scholarship money through these avenues. 
Check out the latest edition of my book Paying For College For Dummies (Wiley) for 
all the details on higher education alternatives and how to best afford them.
Your child can work and save money during high school and college. In fact, if 
your child qualifies for financial aid, they are expected to contribute a certain 
amount to education costs from savings and employment during the school year 
or summer breaks. Besides giving your child a stake in their own future, this 
training encourages sound personal financial management.
Investing Educational Funds
Financial companies pour big bucks into advertising for investment and insurance 
products that they claim are best for making your money grow for your children. 
Don’t get sucked in by these ads.
What makes for good and bad investments in general applies to investments for 
educational expenses, too. Stick with basic, proven, lower-cost investments. 
(Chapter 10 explains what you generally need to look for and beware of.) The fol￾lowing sections focus on considerations specific to college funding.
Good investments: No-load mutual funds 
and exchange-traded funds
As I discuss in Chapter 11, the professional management and efficiency of the best 
no-load mutual funds and exchange-traded funds makes them a tough invest￾ment to beat. Chapters 12 and 13 provide recommendations for investing money in 
funds both inside and outside tax-sheltered retirement accounts.
Gearing the investments to the time frame involved until your children will need 
to use the money is the most important issue with funds. The closer your child 
gets to attending college and using the money saved, the more conservatively the 
money should be invested.274 PART 3 Building Wealth through Investing
Bad investments
Life insurance policies that have cash values are among the most oversold invest￾ments for funding college costs. Here’s the usual pitch: “Because you need life 
insurance to protect your family, why not buy a policy that you can borrow against 
to pay for college?”
One reason you shouldn’t invest in this type of policy to fund college costs is that 
you’re better off contributing to retirement accounts that give you an immediate 
tax deduction that saving through life insurance doesn’t offer. Because life insur￾ance that comes with a cash value is more expensive (largely due to the higher 
commissions these policies pay out to agents who sell them), parents are more 
likely to make a second mistake — not buying enough coverage. If you need and 
want life insurance, you’re better off buying lower-cost term life insurance 
(see Chapter 17).
Another poor investment for college expenses is one that fails to keep you ahead 
of inflation, such as savings or money-market accounts. You need your money to 
grow so you can afford educational costs down the road.
Prepaid tuition plans should generally be avoided. A few states have developed plans 
that allow you to pay college costs at a specific school (calculated for the age of 
your child). The allure of these plans is that by paying today, you eliminate the 
worry of not being able to afford rising costs in the future.
This logic doesn’t work for several reasons. First, odds are quite high that you 
don’t have the money today to pay in advance. Second, putting money into such 
plans reduces your eligibility for financial aid dollar for dollar. If you have that 
kind of extra dough around, you’re better off using it for other purposes. You can 
invest your own money — that’s what the school’s going to do with it, anyway.
Besides, how do you know which college your child will want to attend and how 
long it may take for them to finish? Coercing your child into the school you’ve 
already paid for is a sure ticket to long-term problems in your relationship.
Overlooked investments
Too often, I see parents knocking themselves out to make more money so they can 
afford to buy a bigger home, purchase more expensive cars, take costly vacations, 
and send their kids to more expensive (and therefore supposedly better) private 
schools and colleges. Sometimes families want to send younger children to costly 
elementary schools, too. Families stretch themselves with outrageous mortgages 
or complicated living arrangements so they can get into neighborhoods with top￾rated public schools or send their kids to expensive private elementary schools.CHAPTER 14 Investing for Educational Expenses 275
The best school in the world for your child is you and your home. The reason many 
people I know (including my siblings and I) were able to attend some of the top 
educational institutions is that concerned parents worked hard, not just at their 
jobs, but at spending time with the kids when they were growing up. Rather than 
working to make more money (with the best intentions of buying educational 
experiences or trips, or sending the kids to better schools), try focusing more 
attention on your kids. In my humble opinion, you can do more for your kids by 
spending more time with them.
I see parents scratching their heads about their child’s lack of academic interest 
and achievement  — they blame the school, TV, social media, video games, or 
society at large. These factors may contribute to the problem, but education begins 
in the home. Schools can’t do it alone.
Living within your means not only allows you to save more of your income but 
also frees up more of your time for raising and educating your children. Don’t 
underestimate the value of spending more time with your kids and giving them 
your attention.CHAPTER 15 Investing in Real Estate: Your Home and Beyond 277
Chapter 15
Investing in Real Estate: 
Your Home and Beyond
Buying a home or investing in real estate can be financially and psychologi￾cally rewarding. On the other hand, owning real estate can be a real pain in 
the posterior, because purchasing and maintaining property can be quite 
costly, time-consuming, and emotionally draining. Perhaps you’re looking to 
escape renting and buy your first home. Or maybe you’re interested in becoming 
a local real-estate investing tycoon. In either case, you can learn many lessons 
from real-estate buyers who’ve traveled before you.
Note: Although this chapter focuses primarily on real estate in which you’re going 
to live — otherwise known by those in the trade as owner-occupied property — 
much of what this chapter covers is relevant to real-estate investors. (For addi￾tional information on buying investment real estate — property that you rent out to 
others — see Chapter 10.)

Deciding Whether to Buy or Rent
You may be tired of moving from rental to rental. Perhaps your landlord doesn’t 
adequately keep up the place, or you have to ask permission to hang a picture on 
the wall. You may desire the financial security and rewards that seem to come 
with homeownership. Or maybe you just want a place to call your own.
Any one of these reasons is good enough to want to buy a home. But before you 
head down that path to homeownership, you should take stock of your life and 
your financial health so you can decide whether you still want to buy a home and 
how much you can really afford to spend. You should ask yourself some bigger 
questions.
Assessing your timeline
From a financial perspective, you really shouldn’t buy a place unless you can 
anticipate being there for at least three years (preferably five or more). Buying and 
selling a property entails myriad expenses, including the cost of getting a mort￾gage (points, application, and appraisal fees), inspection expenses, moving costs, 
real-estate agents’ commissions, and title insurance. To cover these transaction 
costs plus the additional costs of ownership, a property must appreciate about 15 percent.
If you need or want to move in a couple of years, counting on 15 percent appreci￾ation is risky. If you’re fortunate and you happen to buy before a sharp rise in 
housing prices, you may get it. If you’re unlucky, you’ll probably lose money on 
the deal.
Some people are willing to invest in real estate even when they don’t expect to live 
in it for long and are open to turning their home into a rental. Doing so can work 
well financially in the long haul, but don’t underestimate the responsibilities that 
come with being a landlord. Also, most people need to sell their current home in 
order to tap enough cash from the sale to buy their next home.
Determining what you can afford
Although buying and owning your own home can be a wise long-term financial 
move, it’s a major purchase that can send shock waves through the rest of your 
personal finances. You’ll probably have to obtain a 15- to 30-year mortgage to 
finance your purchase. The home you buy will need maintenance over the years. 
Owning a home is a bit like running a marathon: Just as you should be in good 
physical shape to successfully run a marathon, you should be in solid financial 
health when you buy a home.CHAPTER 15 Investing in Real Estate: Your Home and Beyond 279
I’ve seen too many people fall in love with a home and make a rushed decision 
(with pressure from salespeople) without taking a hard look at the financial rami￾fications. Take stock of your overall financial health and goals (especially where 
you stand in terms of retirement planning and saving toward your other goals) 
before you buy property and agree to a particular mortgage.
Don’t rely upon a lender who tells you what you can “afford” according to some 
formulas the bank uses to figure out what kind of a credit risk you are. To deter￾mine how much a potential home buyer can borrow, lenders look primarily at 
annual income; they pay no attention to some major aspects of a borrower’s over￾all financial situation. Even if you don’t have money tucked away into retirement 
savings, or you have several children to clothe, feed, and help with educational 
expenses, you still qualify for the same size loan as other people with the same 
income (assuming equal outstanding debts). Take the time and make the effort to 
understand how much you can afford, because only you know and really care 
about what your other financial goals are and how important they are to you.
Here are some important financial questions that you should ask yourself before 
buying a home:
» Are you saving enough money monthly to reach your retirement goals?
» How much do you spend (and want to continue spending) on fun things such 
as travel and entertainment?
» How willing are you to budget your expenses in order to meet your monthly 
mortgage payments and other housing expenses?
» How much of your children’s expected college or other educational expenses 
do you want to be able to pay for?
The other chapters in this book can help you answer these important questions. 
Chapter 4, in particular, helps you think through saving for important financial 
goals.
Many homeowners run into financial trouble because they don’t know their 
spending needs and priorities or how to budget for them. For this reason, a sur￾prisingly large percentage — some studies say about half — of people who borrow 
additional money against their home equity use the funds to pay consumer debts.
Calculating how much you can borrow
Mortgage lenders want to know your ability to repay the money you borrow. So 
you have to pass a few tests that calculate the maximum amount the lender is 280 PART 3 Building Wealth through Investing
willing to lend you. For a home in which you’ll reside, lenders total up your 
monthly housing expenses. They define your housing costs as
Mortgage payment + Property taxes + Insurance
Lenders typically limit the amount they’ll loan so your total housing costs are no 
more than 35 to 40 percent of your monthly gross (before taxes) income for the 
housing expense. (If you’re self-employed, take your net income from the bottom 
line of your federal tax form Schedule C and divide by 12 to get your monthly gross 
income.)
Lenders also consider your other debts when deciding how much to lend you. 
These other debts diminish the funds available to pay your housing expenses. 
Lenders add the amount you need to pay down your other consumer debts (for 
example, auto loans and credit cards) to your monthly housing expense. The 
monthly total costs of these debt payments plus your housing costs typically can￾not exceed 40 to 45 percent.
One general rule says that you can borrow up to three times (or two and one-half 
times) your annual income when buying a home. But this rule is a really rough 
estimate. The maximum that a mortgage lender will loan you depends on interest 
rates. If rates fall, the monthly payment on a mortgage of a given size also drops. 
Thus, lower interest rates make real estate more affordable.
Table 15-1 gives you an estimate of the maximum amount you may be eligible to 
borrow. Multiply your gross annual income by the number in the second column 
to determine the approximate maximum you may be able to borrow. For example, 
if you’re getting a mortgage with a fixed rate around 7 percent and your annual 
income is $50,000, multiply 3.5 by $50,000 to get $175,000 — the approximate 
maximum mortgage allowed.
Comparing owning versus renting costs
Many people assume that owning costs more than renting. In fact, owning a home 
doesn’t have to cost much more or more at all; at times, it may even cost less than 
renting (for example, with the decline in home prices in the late 2000s in many 
parts of the country).
On the surface, buying a place seems a lot more expensive than renting. You’re 
probably comparing your monthly rent (measured in hundreds of dollars to more 
than $1,000, depending on where you live) to the purchase price of a property, 
which is usually a much larger number — perhaps $150,000 to $500,000 or more. 
When you consider a home purchase, you may be thinking about your housing 
expenses in one huge chunk rather than in small monthly installments (like a rent 
check).CHAPTER 15 Investing in Real Estate: Your Home and Beyond 281
Tallying up the costs of owning a place can be a useful and not-too-complicated 
exercise. To make a fair comparison between ownership and rental costs, you 
need to figure what it will cost on a monthly basis to buy a place you desire versus 
what it will cost to rent a comparable place. The worksheet in Table 15-2 enables 
you to do such a comparison. Note: In the interest of reducing the number of vari￾ables, all this “figuring” assumes a fixed-rate mortgage, not an adjustable-rate 
mortgage. (For more info on mortgages, see “Financing Your Home” later in this 
chapter.)

9. Equals total cost of owning (add lines 6, 7, and 8) = $282 PART 3 Building Wealth through Investing
Also, I ignore what economists call the opportunity cost of owning. In other words, 
when you buy, the money you put into your home can’t be invested elsewhere, and 
the foregone investment return on that money, say some economists, should be 
considered a cost of owning a home. I choose to ignore this concept because I don’t 
agree with this line of thinking. When you buy a home, you’re investing your 
money in real estate, which historically has offered solid returns over the decades 
(see Chapter 9). And second, I have you ignore opportunity cost because it greatly 
complicates the analysis and wouldn’t lead to a dramatic change in the numbers.
Now compare line 9 in Table 15-2 with the monthly rent on a comparable place to 
see which costs more — owning or renting.
Mortgage
To determine the monthly payment on your mortgage, simply multiply the rele￾vant number (or multiplier) from Table  15-3 by the size of your mortgage 
expressed in thousands of dollars (divided by 1,000). For example, if you’re taking 
out a $100,000, 30-year mortgage at 6.5 percent, you multiply 100 by 6.32 for a 
$632 monthly payment.

9.5% 10.44 8.41
10.0% 10.75 8.78CHAPTER 15 Investing in Real Estate: Your Home and Beyond 283
Property taxes
You can ask a real-estate person, mortgage lender, or your local assessor’s office 
what your annual property tax bill would be for a house of similar value to the one 
you’re considering buying (the average is about 1.5 percent of your property’s 
value). Divide this amount by 12 to arrive at your monthly property tax bill.
Tax savings in homeownership
Through 2017, mortgage interest and property tax payments for your home were 
generally tax-deductible on Schedule A of IRS Form 1040 (see Chapter 8) except 
for the limitation on the mortgage-interest deduction being “limited” to $1 
million of debt. Effective 2018, the tax benefits of homeownership were further 
limited, especially for those buying more expensive properties subject to higher 
property tax bills. The biggest change is that property taxes combined with your 
state income tax deduction is now limited to $10,000 annually. And, the mortgage￾interest deduction now may be claimed on up to $750,000 of mortgage debt, 
which obviously doesn’t affect most home buyers.
Thus, determining the tax savings you may realize from homeownership has 
become much more complicated. Here’s a shortcut that works reasonably well in 
determining your tax savings in homeownership: Multiply your federal tax rate 
(see Table 8-1 in Chapter 8) by the portion of your property taxes up to $10,000 
when combined with your annual state income tax payments and the portion of 
your mortgage payment up to $750,000 of mortgage debt. (Even if you’re under 
the $750,000 threshold, not all your mortgage payment is tax-deductible — only 
the portion of the mortgage payment that goes toward interest. In the early years 
of your mortgage, nearly all your payment goes toward interest. On the other 
hand, you may earn state tax benefits from your deductible mortgage interest and 
property taxes, which I’m ignoring here in this simplified analysis.)
If you want to more accurately determine how homeownership may affect your 
tax situation, get out your tax return and try plugging in some reasonable num￾bers to estimate how your taxes will change. You can also speak with a tax advisor.
Considering the long-term costs of renting
When you crunch the numbers to find out what owning rather than renting a 
comparable place may cost you on a monthly basis, you may discover that owning 
today isn’t as expensive as you thought. Or you may find that owning now costs 
more than renting.284 PART 3 Building Wealth through Investing
Be careful not to jump to conclusions. Remember that you’re looking at the cost of 
owning versus renting today. What about 5, 10, 20, or 30 years from now? As an 
owner, your biggest monthly expense  — the mortgage payment  — doesn’t 
increase (if you buy your home with a fixed-rate mortgage). Your property taxes, 
homeowner’s insurance, and maintenance expenses — which are generally far 
less than your mortgage payment — will increase over time with the cost of living.
When you rent, however, your entire monthly rent is subject to the vagaries of 
inflation. Living in a rent-controlled unit, where the annual increase allowed in 
your rent is capped, is the exception to this rule. Rent control does not eliminate 
price hikes; it just limits them.
Suppose you’re comparing the costs of owning a home that costs $240,000 to 
renting that same home for $1,300 a month. Table 15-4 compares the cost per 
month of owning the home (after factoring in tax benefits) to your rental costs 
over 30 years. This comparison assumes that you take out a mortgage loan equal 
to 80 percent of the cost of the property at a fixed rate of 6 percent and that the 
rate of inflation of your homeowner’s insurance, property taxes, maintenance, 
and rent is 4 percent per year. I further assume that you’re in a moderate, com￾bined 30-percent federal and state tax bracket.
As you can see in Table 15-4, in the first few years, owning a home costs a little 
more than renting it. In the long run, however, owning is less expensive, because 
more of your rental expenses increase with inflation. And don’t forget that as a 
homeowner you’re building equity in your property; that equity will be quite sub￾stantial by the time you have your mortgage paid off.
Recognizing advantages to renting
Although owning a home and investing in real estate generally pay off handsomely 
over the long term, to be fair and balanced, I must say that renting has its advan￾tages. Some of the financially successful renters I’ve seen include people who pay 
TABLE 15-4	 Cost of Owning versus Renting over 30 Years
Year Ownership Cost per Month Rental Cost per Month
1 $1,470 $1,300
5 $1,570 $1,525
10 $1,730 $1,850
20 $2,180 $2,745
30 $2,880 $4,060CHAPTER 15 Investing in Real Estate: Your Home and Beyond 285
low rent, either because they’ve made housing sacrifices or they live in a rent￾controlled building. If you’re consistently able to save 10 percent or more of your 
earnings, you’re probably well on your way to achieving your future financial goals.
As a renter, you can avoid worrying about or being responsible for fixing up the 
property — that’s your landlord’s responsibility. You also have more financial and 
psychological flexibility as a renter. If you want to move, you can generally do so 
a lot more easily as a renter than you can as a homeowner.
Having a lot of your money tied up in your home is another challenge that you 
don’t face when renting over the long haul. Some people enter their retirement 
years with a substantial portion of their wealth in their homes. As a renter, you 
can have all your money in financial assets that you can tap into more easily. 
Homeowners who have a major chunk of equity in their home at retirement can 
downsize to a less costly property to free up cash and/or take out a reverse mort￾gage (which I discuss later in this chapter) on their home equity.
Financing Your Home
After you look at your financial health, figure out your timeline, and compare 
renting costs to owning costs, you need to confront the tough task of taking on 
debt to buy a home (unless you’re independently wealthy). A mortgage loan from 
a bank or other source makes up the difference between the cash down payment 
you intend to put into the purchase and the agreed-upon selling price of the 
real estate. This section reviews the different options you have for financing 
your home.
Understanding the two major 
types of mortgages
Like many other financial products, you have more mortgages to choose from 
than you could ever possibly investigate. The differences can be important or tri￾vial, expensive or not. Two major types of mortgages exist — those with a fixed 
interest rate and those with a variable or adjustable rate.
» Fixed-rate mortgages, which are usually issued for a 15- or 30-year period, 
have interest rates that never, ever change. The interest rate you pay the first 
month is the same rate you pay the last month (and every month in between). 
Because the interest rate stays the same, your monthly mortgage payment 
amount doesn’t change. With a fixed-rate mortgage, your monthly mortgage 
expense is certain.286 PART 3 Building Wealth through Investing
Fixed-rate loans aren’t risk-free, however. If interest rates fall significantly 
after you obtain your mortgage, you face the danger of being stuck with your 
higher-cost mortgage if you’re unable to refinance (see “Refinancing your 
mortgage” later in this chapter). You can be turned down for a refinance 
because of deterioration in your financial situation or a decline in the value 
of your property. Even if you’re eligible to refinance, you may have to spend 
significant time and money to complete the process.
» Adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) carry an interest rate that varies over time. 
With an adjustable-rate mortgage, you can start with one interest rate and then 
have different rates for every year (or possibly every month) during a 30-year 
mortgage. Thus, the size of your monthly payment fluctuates. Because a mort￾gage payment makes an unusually large dent in most homeowners’ budgets 
anyway, signing up for an ARM without understanding its risks is dangerous.
The attraction of ARMs is the potential interest savings. For the first few years 
of an adjustable loan, the interest rate is typically lower than it is on a 
comparable fixed-rate loan. After that, the relative cost depends on the 
overall trends in interest rates. When interest rates drop, stay level, or rise just 
a little, you probably continue to pay less for your adjustable mortgage. On 
the other hand, when rates rise more than a percent or two and then stay 
elevated, the adjustable loan can cost you more than a fixed-rate loan.
Choosing between fixed- and 
adjustable-rate mortgages
You need to weigh the pros and cons of each mortgage type and decide what’s best 
for your situation before you go out to purchase a piece of real estate or refinance 
a loan. In the real world, most people ignore this advice. The excitement of pur￾chasing a home tends to cloud one’s judgment. My experience has been that few 
people look at their entire financial picture before making major real-estate deci￾sions. If you’re one of them, you may end up with a mortgage that can someday 
seriously overshadow the delight you take in your charming backyard.
Consider the issues I discuss in this section before you decide which kind of 
mortgage — fixed or adjustable — is right for you.
How willing and able are you to 
take on financial risk?
Take stock of how much risk you can handle with the size of your monthly mort￾gage payment. You can’t afford much risk, for example, if your job and income are 
unstable and you need to borrow a lot. I define a lot as “close to the maximum a 
bank is willing to lend you.” A lot can also mean that you have no slack in your CHAPTER 15 Investing in Real Estate: Your Home and Beyond 287
monthly budget — in other words you’re not regularly saving money. If you’re in 
this situation, stick with a fixed-rate loan.
Don’t take an adjustable loan simply because the initially lower interest rates 
allow you to afford the property you want to buy (unless you’re absolutely certain 
that your income will rise to meet future payment increases). Try setting your 
sights on a property that you can afford with a fixed-rate mortgage.
If interest rates rise, a mushrooming adjustable mortgage payment may test the 
lower limits of your checking account balance. When you don’t have emergency 
savings you can tap to make the higher payments, how can you afford the monthly 
payments — much less all the other expenses of homeownership?
And don’t forget to factor in reasonably predictable future expenses that may affect 
your ability to make payments. For example, are you planning to start a family 
soon? If so, your income may fall while your expenses rise (as they surely will).
If you can’t afford the highest allowed payment on an adjustable-rate mortgage, 
don’t take out an ARM. You shouldn’t accept the chance that the interest rate may 
not rise that high — it might (look at the sharp rise in interest rates in 2022-23), 
and then you could lose your home! Ask your lender to calculate the highest pos￾sible maximum monthly payment on your loan. That’s the payment you’d face if the 
interest rate on your loan were to go to the highest level allowed (the lifetime cap).
You need to also consider your stress level. If you have to start following interest 
rate movements, it’s probably not worth gambling on rates. On the other hand, 
maybe you’re in a position to take the financial risks that come with an adjustable￾rate mortgage. An adjustable loan places much of the risk of fluctuating rates on 
you (most adjustables, however, limit, or cap, the rise in the interest rate allowed 
on your loan). In return for your accepting some interest-rate risk, lenders cut 
you a deal — an adjustable mortgage’s interest rate starts lower and stays lower 
if the overall level of interest rates doesn’t rise substantially. Even if rates go up, 
they’ll probably come back down over the life of your loan. So, if you can stick with 
your adjustable for better and for worse, you may still come out ahead over the 
long term. Typical caps are 2 percent per year and 6 percent over the life of 
the loan.
You may feel financially secure in choosing an adjustable loan if you have a hefty 
financial cushion accessible in the event that rates go up, you take out a smaller 
loan than you’re qualified for, or you’re saving more than 10 percent of your 
income.288 PART 3 Building Wealth through Investing
How long do you plan to keep the mortgage?
A mortgage lender takes extra risk when committing to a fixed interest rate 
for 15 to 30 years. Lenders don’t know what may happen in the intervening years, 
so they charge you a premium for their risk.
The savings on most adjustables are usually guaranteed in the first two or three 
years, because an adjustable-rate mortgage starts at a lower interest rate than a 
fixed one. If rates rise, you can end up giving back or losing the savings you 
achieve in the early years of the mortgage. In most cases, if you aren’t going to 
keep your mortgage more than five to seven years, you’re probably paying unnec￾essary interest costs to carry a fixed-rate mortgage.
Another mortgage option is a hybrid loan, which combines features of both the 
fixed- and adjustable-rate mortgages. For example, the initial rate may hold con￾stant for a number of years — three to five years is common — and then adjust 
once a year or every six months thereafter. These hybrid loans may make sense for 
you if you foresee a high probability of keeping your loan seven to ten years or less 
but want some stability in your monthly payments. The longer the initial rate 
stays locked in, the higher the rate.
HOME EQUITY LOANS
Home equity loans, or home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) can be a useful source of 
financing to help buy or improve a home. HELOCs are second mortgages and best 
used by someone who already owns a home and wants to simply tap some of that 
equity without affecting the existing first mortgage (perhaps because of its attractive 
interest rate).
Once established, most HELOCs allow you to tap into your credit line as you need or 
want to so you can use the money for many purposes, including a home remodel, 
college expenses for your kids, or as an emergency source of funds.
HELOCs have their downsides. The biggest negative in my experience is that they 
encourage homeowners to view their homes as piggy banks from which they can 
keep borrowing. The interest rate on a HELOC can increase instantaneously. Also 
beware that lenders can generally cancel your HELOC at their discretion; for example, 
if the value of your home falls too much or your credit score deteriorates.
For more complete and detailed information on HELOCs and all other home loans, 
please consult Mortgages For Dummies (Wiley), which I co-authored with Robert 
Griswold.CHAPTER 15 Investing in Real Estate: Your Home and Beyond 289
Shopping for fixed-rate mortgages
Of the two major types of mortgages I discuss earlier in this chapter, fixed-rate 
loans are generally easier to shop for and compare. The following sections cover 
what you need to know when shopping for fixed-rate mortgages.
Trading off interest rates and points
The interest rate is the annual amount a lender charges you for borrowing its 
money. The interest rate on a fixed-rate loan should always be quoted with the 
points on the loan.
Points are up-front fees paid to your lender when you close on your loan. Points 
are actually percentages: One point is equal to 1 percent of the loan amount. So 
when a lender tells you that 1.5 points are on a quoted loan, you pay 1.5 percent of 
the amount you borrow as points. On a $100,000 loan, for example, 1.5 points cost 
you $1,500. Points are actually prepaid interest, so they’re tax-deductible like the 
interest portion of regular monthly mortgage payments.
If one lender offers 30-year mortgages at 5.75 percent and another lender offers 
them at 6 percent, the 6-percent loan isn’t necessarily worse. You also need to 
consider how many points each lender charges.
The interest rate and points on a fixed-rate loan go together and move in opposite 
directions. If you’re willing to pay more points on a given loan, the lender will 
often reduce the interest rate. Paying more in up-front points may save you a lot 
of money in interest, because the interest rate on your loan determines your pay￾ments over a long, long time — 15 to 30 years. If you pay fewer points, your inter￾est rate increases. Paying less in points may appeal to you if you don’t have much 
cash for closing on your loan.
Suppose Lender X quotes you 5.75 percent on a 30-year fixed-rate loan and 
charges one point (1 percent). Lender Y, who quotes 6 percent, doesn’t charge any 
points. Which is better? The answer depends mostly on how long you plan to keep 
the loan.
The 5.75-percent loan is 0.25 percent less than the 6-percent loan. Year in and 
year out, the 5.75-percent loan saves you 0.25 percent. But because you have to 
pay 1 percent (one point) up front on the 5.75-percent loan, it takes about four 
years to earn back the savings to cover the cost of that point. So if you expect to 
keep the loan less than four years, go with the 6-percent option.
To perform an apples-to-apples comparison of mortgages from different lenders, 
get interest rate quotes at the same point level for each mortgage. For example, 
ask each lender for the interest rate on a loan for which you pay one point.290 PART 3 Building Wealth through Investing
Be wary of lenders who advertise no-point loans as though they’re offering some￾thing for nothing. Remember, if a loan has no points, it’s guaranteed to have a 
higher interest rate. That’s not to say that the loan is better or worse than com￾parable loans from other lenders. But don’t get sucked in by a no-points sales 
pitch. Most lenders who spend big bucks advertising these types of loans rarely 
have the best deals.
Understanding other lender fees
In addition to charging you points and the ongoing interest rate, lenders tack on 
other up-front fees when processing your loan. You need to know the total of all 
lender fees so you can compare different mortgages and determine how much 
completing your home purchase is going to cost you.
Lenders can nickel and dime you with a number of fees other than points. Actu￾ally, you pay more than nickels and dimes — $300 here and $50 there add up in a 
hurry! Here are the main culprits:
» Application and processing fees: Most lenders charge several hundred 
dollars to complete your application and process it through their underwriting
(loan evaluation) department. The justification for this fee is that if your loan is 
rejected or you decide not to take it, the lender needs to cover the costs. 
Some lenders return this fee to you upon closing if you go with their loan 
(after you’re approved).
» Credit report: Many lenders charge a modest fee (about $40) for obtaining a 
copy of your credit report. This report tells the lender whether you’ve paid 
other loans you’ve taken in a timely manner. If you have problems on your 
credit report, clean them up before you apply (see “Increasing your approval 
chances” later in this chapter; also check out Chapter 3 for info on checking 
your credit report).
» Appraisal: The property for which you’re borrowing money needs to be 
valued. If you default on your mortgage, your lender doesn’t want to get stuck 
with a property worth less than you owe. For most residential properties, the 
appraisal cost is typically several hundred dollars.
» Title and escrow charges: These not-so-inconsequential costs are discussed 
in the section “Remembering title insurance and escrow fees” later in this 
chapter.
Get a written itemization of charges from all lenders you are seriously considering 
so you can more readily compare different lenders’ mortgages and so you have no 
surprises when you close on your loan. And to minimize your chances of throwing 
money away on a loan for which you may not qualify, ask the lender whether you 
may not be approved for some reason. Be sure to disclose any problems you’re 
aware of that are on your credit report or with the property.CHAPTER 15 Investing in Real Estate: Your Home and Beyond 291
Some lenders offer loans without points or other lender charges. If lenders don’t 
charge points or other fees, they have to make up the difference by charging a 
higher interest rate on your loan. Consider such loans only if you lack cash for 
closing or if you’re planning to use the loan for just a few years.
Shunning balloon loans
Be wary of balloon loans. They look like fixed-rate loans, but they really aren’t. 
With a balloon loan, the large remaining loan balance becomes fully due at a pre￾determined time — typically within three to ten years. Balloon loans are danger￾ous because you may not be able to refinance into a new loan to pay off the balloon 
loan when it comes due. What if you lose your job or your income drops? What if 
the value of your property drops and the appraisal comes in too low to qualify you 
for a new loan? What if interest rates rise and you can’t qualify for a new loan at 
the higher rate? Taking a balloon loan is a high-risk maneuver that can backfire.
Don’t take a balloon loan unless all the following conditions apply:
» You really, really want a certain property.
» The balloon loan is your only financing option.
» You’re certain that you’re going to be able to refinance or pay off the loan 
entirely when the balloon loan comes due.
If you take a balloon loan, get one that allows for as much time as possible before 
coming due.
BEWARE OF PREPAYMENT PENALTIES
Avoid loans with prepayment penalties. You pay this charge, usually 2 to 3 percent of 
the loan amount, when you pay off your loan before you’re supposed to.
Prepayment penalties don’t typically apply when you pay off a loan because you sell the 
property. But if you refinance such a loan in order to take advantage of lower interest 
rates, you almost always get hit by the prepayment penalties if the loan calls for such 
penalties.
Ask whether a loan has a prepayment penalty. If the answer is yes, find yourself another 
mortgage.292 PART 3 Building Wealth through Investing
Inspecting adjustable-rate 
mortgages (ARMs)
Although sorting through myriad fixed-rate mortgage options is enough to give 
most people a headache, comparing the bells and whistles of ARMs can give you a 
mortgage migraine. Caps, indexes, margins, and adjustment periods — you can 
spend weeks figuring it all out. If you’re clueless about personal finances — or 
just think that you are — shopping for adjustable mortgages scores a 9.9 degree 
of difficulty on the financial frustration scale.
Unfortunately, you have to wade through a number of details to understand and 
compare one adjustable to another. Bear with me. And remember throughout this 
discussion that calculating exactly which ARM is going to cost you the least is 
impossible, because the cost depends on so many variables. Selecting an ARM has 
a lot in common with selecting a home: You have to make trade-offs and compro￾mises based on what’s important to you.
Understanding the start rate
Just as the name implies, the start rate is the interest rate your ARM starts with. 
Don’t judge a loan by this rate. You won’t be paying this attractively low rate for 
long. The interest rate will rise as soon as the terms of the mortgage allow.
Start rates are probably one of the least important items to focus on when com￾paring adjustable loans. (You’d never know this from the way some lenders adver￾tise them — you see ads with the start rate in 3-inch bold type and everything else 
in microscopic footnotes!)
The formula (which includes index and margin) and rate caps are far more impor￾tant for determining what a mortgage will cost you in the long run. Some people 
have labeled the start rate a teaser rate, because the initial rate on your loan is set 
artificially low to entice you. In other words, even if the market level of interest 
rates doesn’t change, your adjustable is destined to increase — 1 to 2 percent is 
common.
Determining the future interest rate
You need to know exactly how a lender figures out how much your ARM interest 
rate is going to increase. All adjustables are based on the following formula, which 
specifies how the future interest rate on your loan is set:
Index + Margin = Interest rateCHAPTER 15 Investing in Real Estate: Your Home and Beyond 293
Indexes are often (but not always) widely quoted in the financial press, and the 
specific one used on a given adjustable loan is chosen by the lender. The six-month 
Treasury bill rate is an example of an index that’s used on some mortgages.
The margin is the amount added to the index to determine the interest rate you 
pay on your mortgage. Most loans have margins of around 2.5 percent. The precise 
margin varies by lender and the particular index that lender is using for an 
adjustable.
So, for example, the interest rate of a mortgage can be driven by the following 
formula:
Six-month Treasury bill rate + 2.5 percent = Mortgage interest rate
In this situation, if six-month Treasuries are yielding 3 percent, the interest rate 
on your loan should be 5.5 percent. This figure is known as the fully indexed rate. If 
this loan starts at a 4.0-percent rate and the rate on six-month Treasuries stays 
the same (3 percent), your loan should eventually increase to 5.5 percent.
The margin on a loan is hugely important. When you’re comparing two loans that 
are tied to the same index and are otherwise equivalent, the loan with the lower 
margin is better. The margin determines the interest rate for every year you hold 
the mortgage.
Indexes differ mainly in how rapidly they respond to changes in interest rates. 
Following are the more common indexes:
» Treasury securities: These indexes are based on government IOUs (Treasury 
bonds), and a whole lot of them are out there. You’ll find adjustables tied to 
the interest rate on 12-month, 3-year, 5-year, and 10-year T-bonds.
» The London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR): This index is an average of the 
interest rates that major international banks charge one another to borrow 
U.S. dollars in the London money market. This index has increased in usage 
and popularity with ARMs as foreign investors have bought more U.S. 
mortgages.
» 11th District Cost of Funds: This index tends to be among the slower-moving 
indexes. ARMs tied to the 11th District Cost of Funds tend to start out at a 
higher interest rate. (The 11th District Cost of Funds Index is the weighted 
average of the cost of borrowings to member banking institutions of the 
Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco, the 11th District.) A slower-moving 
index has the advantage of moving up less quickly when rates are on the rise. 
On the other hand, you need to be patient to realize the benefit of falling 
interest rates.294 PART 3 Building Wealth through Investing
Looking at the adjustment period or frequency
Every so often, the mortgage-rate formula is applied to recalculate the interest 
rate on an adjustable-rate loan. Some loans adjust monthly. Others adjust every 
6 or 12 months.
In advance of each rate change, the lender should send you a notice telling you 
what your new rate is. All things being equal, the less frequently your loan adjusts, 
the less financial uncertainty for you. Less-frequent adjustments usually coincide 
with a loan starting at a higher interest rate.
AVOID NEGATIVE AMORTIZATION 
AND INTEREST-ONLY LOANS 
IF YOU’RE STRETCHING
As you make mortgage payments over time, the loan balance you still owe is gradually 
reduced — this process is known as amortizing the loan. The reverse of this process — 
increasing your loan balance — is called negative amortization.
Negative amortization is allowed by some ARMs. Your outstanding loan balance can 
grow even though you’re continuing to make mortgage payments when your mortgage 
payment is less than it really should be.
Some loans cap the increase of your monthly payment, but not the interest rate. The 
size of your mortgage payment may not reflect all the interest you owe on your loan. 
So rather than paying off the interest and some of your loan balance (or principal) every 
month, you’re paying off some, but not all, of the interest you currently owe. Thus, the 
extra unpaid interest you still owe is added to your outstanding debt.
Using negative amortization is like paying only the minimum payment required on a 
credit-card bill. You keep racking up greater interest charges on the balance as long as 
you make only the artificially low payment. Doing so defeats the whole purpose of 
borrowing an amount that fits your overall financial goals. And you may never get your 
mortgage paid off! Even worse, the increased interest you start to accrue on the unpaid 
interest added to your mortgage balance may not be tax-deductible, because it doesn’t 
qualify as interest incurred as part of the original purchase (what the IRS calls the 
acquisition debt).
Avoid negative-amortization mortgages. Ask whether a loan includes negative amortiza￾tion; some lenders aren’t forthcoming about telling you. You’ll find it more frequently on 
loans that lenders consider risky. If you’re having trouble finding lenders who are willing 
to deal with your financial situation, be especially careful.CHAPTER 15 Investing in Real Estate: Your Home and Beyond 295
Understanding rate caps
When the initial interest rate expires, the interest rate fluctuates based on the 
formula of the loan. Almost all adjustables come with rate caps. The adjustment cap
limits the maximum rate change (up or down) allowed at each adjustment. On 
most loans that adjust every six months, the adjustment cap is 1 percent.
Loans that adjust more than once per year often limit the maximum rate change 
allowed over the entire year as well. On most such loans, the annual rate cap is 
2 percent.
Almost all adjustables come with lifetime caps, which limit the highest rate allowed 
over the entire life of the loan. ARMs often have lifetime caps that are 5 to 6 percent 
higher than the start rate. Before taking an adjustable, figure out the maximum 
possible payment at the lifetime cap to be sure you can handle it.
Being aware of other ARM fees
Just as with fixed-rate mortgages, ARMs can carry all sorts of additional lender￾levied charges. See the section “Understanding other lender fees” earlier in this 
chapter for details.
Avoiding the down-payment blues
You can generally qualify for the most favorable mortgage terms by making a 
down payment of at least 20 percent of the purchase price of the property.
In addition to saving money on interest, you can avoid the added cost of private 
mortgage insurance (PMI) by putting down this much. (To protect against losing 
money in the event you default on your loan, lenders usually require PMI, which 
costs you about 0.5 to 1.0 percent of the mortgage amount per year on a typical 
mortgage.)
Another type of loan to generally avoid is the interest-only mortgage. In the early years 
of an interest-only loan, the monthly payment is kept lower because only interest is 
being paid; no payment is going to reduce the loan balance. What many folks don’t real￾ize is that at a set number of years into the mortgage (for instance, three, five, or seven), 
principal payments kick in as well, which dramatically increases the monthly payment.
Tread carefully with interest-only mortgages; consider one only if you understand how 
they work and can afford the inevitable jump in payments. Do not consider interest-only 
loans if you’re stretching to be able to afford a home.296 PART 3 Building Wealth through Investing
Many people don’t have the equivalent of 20 percent or more of the purchase price 
of a home to avoid paying private mortgage insurance. Here are a number of solu￾tions for coming up with that 20 percent more quickly or buying with less money 
down:
» Go on a spending diet. Take a tour through Chapter 7 to find strategies for 
cutting back on your spending.
» Consider lower-priced properties. Smaller properties and ones that need 
some work can help reduce the purchase price and, therefore, the required 
down payment.
» Find financial partners. You can often get more home for your money when 
you buy a building in partnership with one, two, or a few people. Prepare a 
legal contract to specify what’s going to happen if a partner wants out, 
divorces, or passes away.
» Seek reduced down-payment financing. Some lenders will offer you a 
mortgage even though you may be able to put down only 10 percent (and 
perhaps even less) of the purchase price (typically at the cost of a much higher 
interest rate). You must have solid credit to qualify for such loans, and you 
generally have to obtain and pay for the extra expense of private mortgage 
insurance (PMI), which protects the lender if you default on the loan.
When the property value rises enough or you pay down the mortgage enough 
to have 20-percent equity in the property, you can drop the PMI. You generally 
have to apply to your lender to have the PMI dropped; it doesn’t happen 
automatically.
Some property owners or developers may also be willing to finance your 
purchase with 10 percent or less down. You can’t be as picky about properties, 
because not as many are available under these terms — many need work or 
haven’t been sold yet for other reasons.
» Get assistance from family. If your relatives have money dozing away in a 
savings or CD account, they may be willing to lend (or even give) you the down 
payment. You can pay them an interest rate higher than the rate they’re 
currently earning but lower than what you’d pay to borrow from a bank — a 
win/win situation for both of you. Lenders generally ask whether any portion 
of the down payment is borrowed and will reduce the maximum amount 
they’re willing to loan you accordingly.

For Dummies (Wiley), which I co-authored with real-estate guru Ray Brown.CHAPTER 15 Investing in Real Estate: Your Home and Beyond 297
Comparing 15-year and 30-year mortgages
Many people don’t have a choice between 15- and 30-year mortgages. To afford 
the monthly payments on their desired home, they need to spread the loan pay￾ments over a longer period of time, and a 30-year mortgage is the answer. A 
15-year mortgage has higher monthly payments because you pay it off faster, 
meaning you pay off a larger amount of the loan balance each month and thus 
build equity in your home quicker. With fixed-rate mortgages at 6 percent, a 
15-year mortgage comes with payments that are about 35 percent higher than 
those for a 30-year mortgage.
Taking the 15-year option, even if you can afford these higher payments, isn’t 
necessarily better. The money for making extra payments doesn’t come out of 
thin air. You may have better uses (which I discuss later in this section) for your 
excess funds.
And if you opt for a 30-year mortgage, you maintain the flexibility to pay it off 
faster (except in those rare cases where you have to pay a prepayment penalty). By 
making additional payments on a 30-year mortgage, you can create your own 
15-year mortgage. But if the need arises, you can fall back to making only the pay￾ments required on the 30-year schedule.
Locking yourself into higher monthly payments with a 15-year mortgage comes 
with a risk. If money gets too tight in the future, you can fall behind in your mort￾gage payments. You may be able to refinance your way out of the predicament, but 
you can’t count on it. If your finances worsen or your property declines in value, 
you may have trouble qualifying for a refinance.
Suppose you qualify for a 15-year mortgage and you’re financially comfortable 
with the higher payments; the appeal of paying off your mortgage 15 years sooner 
is enticing. Besides, the interest rate is lower — generally up to ½ percent lower — 
on a 15-year mortgage. So if you can afford the higher payments on the 15-year 
mortgage, you’d be silly not to take it, right? Not so fast. You’re really asking 
whether you should pay off your mortgage slowly or more quickly. And the answer 
isn’t simple — it depends. Don’t spend hours crunching numbers; you can make 
this decision by considering some qualitative issues.
First, think about alternative uses for the extra money you’d be throwing into pay￾ing down the mortgage. What’s best for you depends on your overall financial 
situation and what else you can do with the money. If you would end up blowing 
the extra money at the racetrack or on an expensive car, pay down the mortgage. 
That’s a no-brainer.
But suppose you take the extra $100 or $200 per month that you were planning to 
add to your mortgage payment and contribute it to a retirement account instead. 298 PART 3 Building Wealth through Investing
This step may make financial sense. Why? Because contributions to 401(k)s, 
SEP-IRAs, and other types of retirement accounts (discussed in Chapter 12) are 
generally tax-deductible.
When you add an extra $200 to your mortgage payment to pay off your mortgage 
faster, you receive no tax benefits. When you deposit that $200 into a retirement 
account, you get to subtract that $200 from the income on which you pay taxes. If 
you’re paying 30 percent in federal and state income taxes, you shave $60 (that’s 
$200 multiplied by 30 percent) off your tax bill.
In most cases, you get to deduct your mortgage interest on your tax return (see 
the section, “Tax savings in homeownership,” earlier in this chapter). So, if you’re 
paying 5-percent interest, your mortgage may really cost you only around 3.5 to 4 
percent after you factor in the tax benefits. If you think you can do better (remem￾ber to consider the taxes on investment returns) by investing elsewhere (stocks, 
investment real estate, and so on), go for it. Investments such as stocks and real 
estate have generated better returns over the long haul. These investments carry 
risk, though, and they’re not guaranteed to produce any return.
If you’re uncomfortable investing and you’d otherwise leave the extra money 
sitting in a money-market fund or savings account, you’re better off paying down 
the mortgage. When you pay down the mortgage, you invest your money in a sure 
thing with a modest return. In fact, it’s equivalent to buying a risk-free bond that 
pays you a pre-tax interest rate equal to whatever your mortgage-interest rate is.
With pre-college-age kids at home, you have an even better reason to fund retire￾ment accounts before you consider paying down your mortgage quickly. Retire￾ment account balances are generally not counted as an asset when determining 
financial aid for college expenses. By contrast, many schools still count equity in 
your home (the difference between its market value and your loan balance) as an 
asset that can be tapped to pay for college. Your reward for paying down your 
mortgage balance may be less financial aid! See Chapter 14 for more details about 
financing education expenses.
Finding the best lender
As with other financial purchases, you can save a lot of money by shopping around. 
It doesn’t matter whether you shop around on your own or hire someone to help 
you. Just do it!
On a 30-year, $180,000 mortgage, for example, getting a mortgage that costs 
0.5 percent less per year saves you about $20,000 in interest over the life of the 
loan (given current interest rate levels). That’s enough to buy a decent car! On 
second thought, save it!CHAPTER 15 Investing in Real Estate: Your Home and Beyond 299
Shopping for a lender on your own
In most areas, you can find many mortgage lenders. Although having a large 
number of lenders to choose from is good for competition, it also makes shopping 
a chore.
Large banks whose names you recognize from their advertising usually don’t offer 
the best rates. Make sure you check out some of the smaller lending institutions 
in your area. Also, check out mortgage bankers, who, unlike banks, only do mort￾gages. The better mortgage bankers offer some of the most competitive rates.
Real-estate agents can also refer you to lenders with whom they’ve previously 
done business. These lenders may not necessarily offer the most competitive 
rates — the agent simply may have done business with them in the past.
Web-surfers can head on over to Bankrate (www.bankrate.com), Realtor.com 
(www.realtor.com), and HSH Associates (www.hsh.com).
You can also look in the real-estate section of the larger Sunday newspapers (and 
associated websites) in your area for charts of selected lender interest rates. These 
tables are by no means comprehensive or reflective of the best rates available. In 
fact, many of them are sent to newspapers for free by firms that distribute mort￾gage information to mortgage brokers. Use the tables as a starting point by calling 
the lenders who list the best rates.
One tactic that works well, especially in refinance situations, is to gather the best 
quotes from various sources and then check with your current banking relation￾ship last. Ask them to match or beat your best offer (waive or discount some fees, 
discount the interest rate, and so on). If you’re a good client and they want to keep 
your business (or expand what they already have with you), they may give you the 
best deal.
Hiring a mortgage broker
Insurance agents peddle insurance, real-estate agents sell real estate, and mort￾gage brokers deal in mortgages. They buy mortgages at wholesale from lenders 
and then mark them up to retail before selling them to you. The mortgage brokers 
get their income from the difference, or spread, in the form of a commission. The 
terms of the loan obtained through a broker are generally the same as the terms 
you obtain from the lender directly.
Mortgage brokers get paid a percentage of the loan amount — typically 0.5 to 
1 percent. This commission is negotiable, especially on larger loans that are more 
lucrative. Ask a mortgage broker what his cut is. Many people don’t ask for this 
information, so some brokers may act taken aback when you inquire. Remember, 
it’s your money!300 PART 3 Building Wealth through Investing
The chief advantage of using a mortgage broker is that the broker can shop among 
lenders to get you a good deal. If you’re too busy or disinterested to shop around 
for a good deal on a mortgage, a competent mortgage broker can probably save 
you money. A broker can also help you through the tedious process of filling out 
all those horrible documents lenders demand before giving you a loan. And if you 
have credit problems or an unusual property you’re financing, a broker may be 
able to match you up with a hard-to-find lender who’s willing to offer you a 
mortgage.
When evaluating a mortgage broker, be on guard for those who are lazy and don’t 
continually shop the market looking for the best mortgage lenders. Some brokers 
place their business with the same lenders all the time, and those lenders don’t 
necessarily offer the best rates. Also watch out for salespeople who earn big com￾missions pushing certain loan programs that aren’t in your best interests. These 
brokers aren’t interested in taking the time to understand your needs and discuss 
your options. Thoroughly check a broker’s references before doing business.
Even if you plan to shop on your own, talking to a mortgage broker may still be 
worthwhile. At the very least, you can compare what you find with what brokers 
say they can get for you. Just be careful. Some brokers tell you what you want to 
hear and then aren’t able to deliver when the time comes.
When a loan broker quotes you a really good deal, ask who the lender is. (Most 
brokers refuse to reveal this information until you pay the few hundred dollars to 
cover the appraisal and credit report.) You can check with the actual lender to ver￾ify the interest rate and points the broker quotes you and make sure you’re eligible 
for the loan.
Increasing your approval chances
A lender can take several weeks to complete your property appraisal and an eval￾uation of your loan package. When many people are trying to refinance their loans, 
typically after a large drop in interest rates, the process may even take upward of 
six weeks. When you’re under contract to buy a property, having your loan denied 
after waiting several weeks can mean you lose the property as well as the money 
you spent applying for the loan and having the property inspected. Some property 
sellers may be willing to give you an extension, but others won’t.
Here’s how to increase your chances of having your mortgage approved:
» Get your finances in shape before you shop. You won’t have a good handle 
on what you can afford to spend on a home until you whip your personal 
finances into shape. Do so before you begin to make offers on properties. 
This book can help you. If you have consumer debt, eliminate it — the more CHAPTER 15 Investing in Real Estate: Your Home and Beyond 301
credit-card, auto loan, and other consumer debt you rack up, the less 
mortgage you qualify for. In addition to the high interest rate and the fact that 
it encourages you to live beyond your means, you now have a third reason to 
get rid of consumer debt. Hang onto the dream of owning a home and plug 
away at paying off consumer debts.
» Clear up credit-report problems. Get a copy of your credit report before you 
apply for a mortgage. Chapter 3 explains how to obtain a free copy, as well as 
correct any mistakes or clear up blemishes.
» Get preapproved or prequalified. When you get prequalified, a lender 
speaks with you about your financial situation and then calculates the 
maximum amount they’re willing to lend you based on what you tell them. 
Preapproval is much more in-depth and includes a lender’s review of your 
financial statements. Don’t waste your time and money getting preapproved 
if you’re not really ready to buy.
» Be up front about problems. Late payments, missed payments, or debts 
that you never bothered to pay can come back to haunt you. The best defense 
against loan rejection is to avoid it in the first place. You can sometimes head 
off potential rejection by disclosing to your lender anything that may cause a 
problem before you apply for the loan. That way, you have more time to 
correct problems and find alternate solutions. Mortgage brokers (see the 
preceding section) can also help you shop for lenders who are willing to 
offer you a loan despite credit problems.
» Work around low/unstable income. When you’ve been changing jobs or 
you’re self-employed, your recent economic history may be as unstable as a 
country undergoing a regime change. Making a larger down payment is one 
way around this problem. You may try getting a co-signer, such as a relative or 
good friend. As long as the co-signer isn’t overloaded with debt, they can help 
you qualify for a larger loan than you can get on your own. Be sure that all 
parties understand the terms of the agreement, including who’s responsible 
for monthly payments!
» Consider a backup loan. You certainly should shop among different lenders, 
and you may want to apply to more than one for a mortgage. Although 
applying for a second loan means additional fees and work, it can increase 
your chances of getting a mortgage if you’re attempting to buy a difficult-to￾finance property or if your financial situation makes some lenders leery. 
Be sure to disclose to each lender what you’re doing — the second lender 
to pull your credit report will see that another lender has already done so.

Finding the Right Property
Shopping for a home can be fun. You get to peek inside other people’s closets. But 
for most people, finding the right house at the right price can take a lot of time. 
When you’re buying with partners or a spouse (or children, if you choose to share 
the experience with them), finding the right place can also entail a lot of compro￾mise. A good agent (or several who specialize in different areas) can help with the 
legwork. The following sections cover the main things you need to consider when 
shopping for a home to call your own.
Condo, town house, co-op, or 
detached home?
Some people’s image of a home is a single-family dwelling  — a stand-alone 
house with a lawn and white picket fence. In some areas, however — particularly 
in higher-cost neighborhoods — you find condominiums (you own the unit and a 
share of everything else), town houses (attached or row houses), and cooperatives,
also known as co-ops (you own a share of the entire building). The allure of such 
higher-density housing is that it’s generally less expensive. In some cases, you 
don’t have to worry about some of the general maintenance, because the owner’s 
association (which you pay for, directly or indirectly) takes care of it.
If you don’t have the time, energy, or desire to keep up a property, shared housing 
may make sense for you. You generally get more living space for your dollars, and 
it may also provide you with more security than a stand-alone home.
As investments, however, single-family homes generally do better in the long 
run. Shared housing is easier to build and thus overbuild; on the other hand, 
single-family houses are harder to put up because more land is required. And 
most people, when they can afford it, still prefer a stand-alone home.
With that being said, you should remember that a rising tide raises all boats. In a 
good real-estate market, all types of housing generally appreciate, although 
single-family homes tend to do better. Shared housing values tend to fare better 
in densely populated urban areas with little available land for new building.
From an investment return perspective, if you can afford a smaller single-family 
home instead of a larger shared-housing unit, buy the single-family home. Be 
especially wary of buying shared housing in suburban areas with lots of develop￾able land.CHAPTER 15 Investing in Real Estate: Your Home and Beyond 303
Casting a broad net
You may have an idea about the type of property and location you’re interested in 
or think you can afford before you start your search. You may think, for example, 
that you can only afford a condominium in the neighborhood you’re interested in. 
But if you take the time to check out other communities, you may be surprised to 
find one that meets most of your needs and also has single-family homes you can 
afford. You’d never know about this community if you were to narrow your search 
too quickly.
Even if you’ve lived in an area for a while and believe you know it well, look at 
different types of properties in a number of communities before you narrow your 
search. Be open-minded and figure out which of your many criteria for a home 
you really care about.
Finding out actual sale prices
Don’t look at just a few of the homes listed at a particular price and then get 
depressed because they’re all dogs or you can’t afford what you really want. Before 
you decide to renew your apartment lease, remember that properties often sell for 
less than the price at which they’re listed.
Find out what the places you look at eventually sell for. Doing so gives you a bet￾ter sense of what places are really worth and what properties you may be able to 
afford. There are several ways to find this information. A number of websites, 
such as www.realtor.com, www.trulia.com, and www.zillow.com, include sales 
price information. Ask the agent or owner who sold the property what the sale 
price was or contact the town’s assessors’ office for information on how to 
obtain property sale price information.
Researching the area
Even (and especially) if you fall in love with a house at first sight, go back to the 
neighborhood at various times of the day and on different days of the week. Travel 
to and from your prospective new home during commuting hours to see how long 
your commute will really take. Knock on some doors and meet your potential 
neighbors. You may discover, for example, that a flock of chickens lives in the 
backyard next door or that the street and basements frequently flood.
Go visit the schools. Don’t rely on statistics about test scores. Talk to parents and 
teachers. What’s really going on at the school? Even if you don’t have kids, the 
quality of the local school has a direct bearing on the value of your property. Is 
crime a problem? Call the local police department. Will future development be 
allowed? If so, what type? Talk to the planning department. What are your 304 PART 3 Building Wealth through Investing
property taxes going to be? Is the property located in an area susceptible to major 
risks, such as floods, mudslides, fires, or earthquakes? Consider these issues even 
if they’re not important to you, because they can affect the resale value of your 
property. Make sure you know what you’re getting yourself into before you buy.
Working with Real-Estate Agents
When you buy (or sell) a home, you’ll probably work with a real-estate agent. 
Real-estate agents earn their living on commission. As such, their incentives can 
be at odds with what’s best for you. Real-estate agents usually don’t hide the fact 
that they get a cut of the deal. Property buyers and sellers generally understand 
the real-estate commission system. I credit the real-estate profession for calling 
its practitioners “agents” instead of coming up with some silly obfuscating title 
such as “housing consultants.”
A top-notch real-estate agent can be a significant help when you purchase or sell 
a property. On the other hand, a mediocre, incompetent, or greedy agent can be a 
real liability. The following sections help you sort the best from the rest.
Recognizing conflicts of interest
Real-estate agents, because they work on commission, face numerous conflicts of 
interest. Some agents may not even recognize the conflicts in what they’re doing. 
The following list presents the most common conflicts of interest that you need to 
watch out for:
» Because agents work on commission, it costs them when they spend time 
with you and you don’t buy or sell. They want you to complete a deal, and they 
want that deal as soon as possible — otherwise, they don’t get paid. Don’t 
expect an agent to give you objective advice about what you should do given 
your overall financial situation. Examine your overall financial situation before
you decide to begin working with an agent.
» Because real-estate agents get a percentage of the sales price of a property, 
they have a built-in incentive to encourage you to spend more. Adjustable￾rate mortgages (see “Financing Your Home” earlier in this chapter) allow you 
to spend more because the interest rate starts at a lower level than that of a 
fixed-rate mortgage. Thus, real-estate agents are far more likely to encourage 
you to take an adjustable. But adjustables are a lot riskier — you need to 
understand these drawbacks before signing up for one.
» Agents often receive a higher commission when they sell listings that belong 
to other agents in their office. Beware. Sometimes the same agent represents CHAPTER 15 Investing in Real Estate: Your Home and Beyond 305
both the property seller and the property buyer in the transaction — a real 
problem. Agents who hold open houses for sale may try to sell to an unrepre￾sented buyer they meet at the open house. There’s no way one person can 
represent the best interests of both sides.
» Because agents work on commission and get paid a percentage of the sales 
price of the property, many aren’t interested in working with you if you can’t 
or simply don’t want to spend a lot. Some agents may reluctantly take you on 
as a customer and then give you little attention and time. Before you hire an 
agent, check references to make sure that he works well with buyers like you.
» Real-estate agents typically work in a specific territory. As a result, they usually 
can’t objectively tell you the pros and cons of the surrounding regions. Most 
won’t admit that you may be better able to meet your needs by looking in 
another area where they don’t normally work. Before you settle on an agent 
(or an area), spend time figuring out the pros and cons of different territories 
on your own. If you want to seriously look in more than one area, find agents 
who specialize in each area.
» Some agents may refer you to a more expensive lender who has the virtue of 
high approval rates. If you don’t get approved for a mortgage loan, your entire 
real-estate deal may unravel. Be sure to shop around — you can probably get 
a loan more cheaply. Be especially wary of agents who refer you to mortgage 
lenders and mortgage brokers who pay agents referral fees. Such payments 
clearly bias a real-estate agent’s “advice.”
» Agents may encourage you to use a particular inspector with a reputation of being 
“easy” — meaning he may not “find” all the house’s defects. Home inspectors are 
supposed to be objective third parties who are hired by prospective buyers to 
evaluate the condition of a property. Remember, it’s in the agent’s best interest to 
seal the deal, and the discovery of problems may sidetrack those efforts.
» Under pressure to get a house listed for sale, some agents agree to be 
accomplices and avoid disclosing known defects or problems with the 
property. In most cover-up cases, it seems, the seller doesn’t explicitly ask an 
agent to help cover up a problem; the agent just looks the other way or avoids 
telling the whole truth. Never buy a home without having a home inspector 
look it over from top to bottom.
Looking for the right qualities 
in real-estate agents
When you hire a real-estate agent, you want to find someone who’s competent 
and with whom you can get along. Working with an agent costs a lot of money 
(which is built into the price of houses sold and generally deducted from the sell￾er’s proceeds) — so make sure you get your money’s worth.306 PART 3 Building Wealth through Investing
Interview several agents. Check references. Ask agents for the names and contact 
information of at least three clients they’ve worked with in the past six months 
(in the geographical area in which you’re looking). Look for the following traits in 
any agent you work with:
» Full-time employment: Some agents work in real estate as a second or even 
third job. Information in this field changes constantly. The best agents work at 
it full-time so they can stay on top of the market.
» Experience: Hiring someone with experience doesn’t necessarily mean 
looking for an agent who’s been kicking around for decades. Many of the best 
agents come into the field from other occupations. Some sales, marketing, 
negotiation, and communication skills can certainly be picked up in other 
fields, but experience in buying and selling real estate does count.
» Honesty and integrity: If your agent doesn’t level with you about what a 
neighborhood or particular property is really like, you suffer the 
consequences.
» Interpersonal skills: An agent must be able to get along not only with you 
but also with a whole host of other people who are typically involved in a 
real-estate deal: other agents, property sellers, inspectors, mortgage lenders, 
and so on.
» Negotiation skills: Is your agent going to exhaust all avenues to negotiate the 
best deal possible for you? Be sure to ask the agent’s references how well the 
agent negotiated for them.
» High-quality standards: Sloppy work can lead to big legal or logistical 
problems down the road. If an agent neglects to recommend thorough and 
complete inspections, for example, you may be stuck with undiscovered 
problems after the deal is done.
BUYER’S AGENTS/BROKERS
Some agents market themselves as buyer’s agents/brokers. Supposedly, these folks 
represent your interests as a property buyer exclusively. Legally speaking, buyer’s agents 
may sign a contract saying that they represent your — and only your — interests. Before 
this enlightened era, all agents contractually worked for the property seller.
The title “buyer’s agent” is one of those things that sounds better than it really is. 
Agents who represent you as buyer’s brokers still get paid only when you buy. And 
they still get a commission as a percentage of the purchase price. So they still have an 
incentive to sell you a piece of real estate, and the more expensive it is, the more 
commission they make.CHAPTER 15 Investing in Real Estate: Your Home and Beyond 307
Agents sometimes market themselves as top producers, which means that they sell 
a relatively large volume of real estate. This title doesn’t count for much for you, 
the buyer. It may be a red flag for an agent who focuses on completing as many 
deals as possible. When you’re buying a home, you need an agent who has the fol￾lowing additional traits:
» Patience: You need an agent who’s patient and willing to allow you the 
necessary time it takes to get educated and make the best decision 
for yourself.
» Local market and community knowledge: When you’re looking to buy a 
home in an area in which you’re not currently living, an informed agent can 
have a big impact on your decision.
» Financing knowledge: As a buyer (especially a first-time buyer or someone 
with credit problems), you should look for an agent who knows which lenders 
can best handle your type of situation.
Buying real estate requires somewhat different skills than selling real estate. Few 
agents can do both equally well. No law or rule says that you must use the same 
agent when you sell a property as you do when you buy a property.
Putting Your Deal Together
After you do your homework on your personal finances, discover how to choose a 
mortgage, and research neighborhoods and home prices, you’ll hopefully be ready 
to close in on your goal. Eventually, you’ll find a home you want to buy. Before you 
make that first offer, though, you need to understand the importance of negotia￾tions, inspections, and the other elements of a real-estate deal.
Negotiating 101
When you work with an agent, the agent usually handles the negotiation process. 
But you need to have a plan and strategy in mind; otherwise, you may end up over￾paying for your home. Here are some recommendations for getting a good deal:
» Never fall in love with a property. If you have money to burn and can’t 
imagine life without the home you just discovered, pay what you will. 
Otherwise, remind yourself that other good properties are out there. 
Having a backup property in mind can help.308 PART 3 Building Wealth through Investing
» Find out about the property and owner before you make your offer. How 
long has the property been on the market? What are its flaws? Why is the 
owner selling? The more you understand about the property and the seller’s 
motivations, the better able you’ll be to draft an offer that meets both parties’ 
needs.
» Get comparable sales data to support your price. Too often, home buyers 
and their agents pick a number out of the air when making an offer. But if the 
offer has no substance behind it, the seller will hardly be persuaded to lower 
his asking price. Pointing to recent and comparable home sales to justify your 
offer price strengthens your case.
» Remember that price is only one of several negotiable items. Sometimes 
sellers get fixated on selling their homes for a certain amount. Perhaps they 
want to get at least what they paid for it years ago. You may be able to get a 
seller to pay for certain repairs or improvements, to pay some of your closing 
costs, or to offer you an attractive loan without the extra loan fees that a bank 
would charge. Likewise, the real-estate agent’s commission is negotiable.
Inspecting before you buy
When you buy a home, you may be making one of the biggest (if not the biggest) 
purchases of your life. Unless you build homes and do contracting work, you prob￾ably have no idea what you’re getting yourself into when it comes to furnaces and 
termites.
Spend the time and money to locate and hire good inspectors and other experts to 
evaluate the major systems and potential problem areas of the home. Areas that 
you want to check include:
» Overall condition of the property
» Electrical, heating, cooling, and plumbing systems
» Foundation
» Roof
» Pest control and dry rot
» Seismic/slide/flood risk
Inspection fees often pay for themselves. When problems that you weren’t aware 
of are uncovered, the inspection reports give you the information you need to go 
back and ask the property seller to fix the problems or reduce the purchase price 
of the property to compensate you for correcting the deficiencies yourself.CHAPTER 15 Investing in Real Estate: Your Home and Beyond 309
As with other professionals whose services you retain, interview several inspection 
companies. Ask which systems they inspect and how detailed a report they’re 
going to prepare for you (ask for a sample copy). Request names and contact infor￾mation of three people who have used their service within the past six months.
Never accept a seller’s inspection report as your only source of information. When 
a seller hires an inspector, they may hire someone who won’t be as diligent and 
critical of the property. What if the inspector is a buddy of the seller or their agent? 
By all means, review the seller’s inspection reports if available, but get your own 
as well.
And here’s one more inspection for you to do: The day before you close on the 
purchase, do a brief walk-through of the property. Make sure that everything is 
still in good order and that all the fixtures, appliances, curtains, and other items 
that were to be left per the contract are still there. Sometimes sellers (and their 
movers) “forget” what they’re supposed to leave or try to test your powers of 
observation.
Remembering title insurance 
and escrow fees
Mortgage lenders require title insurance to protect against someone else claiming 
legal title to your property. This claim can happen, for example, when a husband 
and wife split up and the one who remains in the home decides to sell and take off 
with the money. If both spouses are listed as owners on the title, the spouse who 
sells the property (possibly by forging the other’s signature) has no legal right to 
do so. Both you and the lender can get stuck holding the bag if you buy the home 
that the one spouse of this divided couple is selling. But title insurance acts as the 
salvation for you and your lender. Title insurance protects you against the risk 
that the spouse whose name was forged will come back and reclaim rights to the 
home after it’s sold.
If you’re in the enviable position of paying cash for a property, you should still buy 
title insurance, even though a mortgage lender won’t prod you to do so. You need 
to protect your investment.
Escrow charges pay for neutral third-party services to ensure that the instructions 
of the purchase contract or refinance are fulfilled and that everyone gets paid.
Many people don’t seem to understand that title insurance and escrow fees vary 
from company to company. As a result, they don’t bother to comparison shop; 
they simply use the company that their real-estate agent or mortgage lender 
suggests.310 PART 3 Building Wealth through Investing
Call around for title insurance and escrow fee quotes, and make sure you under￾stand all the fees. If you find a company with lower prices and want to use it, ask 
for an itemization in writing so you don’t have any surprises. Real-estate agents 
and mortgage lenders can be a good starting point for referrals because they usu￾ally have a broader perspective on the cost and service quality of different compa￾nies. Call other companies as well. Agents and lenders may be biased toward a 
company simply because they’re in the habit of using it or they’ve referred clients 
to it before.
After You Buy
After you buy a home, you’ll make a number of important decisions over the 
months and years ahead. This section discusses the key issues you need to deal 
with as a homeowner and tells what you need to know to make the best decision 
for each of them.
Refinancing your mortgage
Three reasons motivate people to refinance, or obtain a new mortgage to replace an 
old one. One is obvious: to save money because interest rates have dropped. Refi￾nancing can also be a way to release capital for some other purpose. You can use 
refinancing to get out of one type of loan and into another. The following sections 
can help you decide on the best option in each case.
Spending money to save money
If your current loan has a higher rate of interest than comparable new loans, you 
may be able to save money by refinancing. Because refinancing costs money, 
whether you can save enough to justify the cost is open to question. If you can 
recover the expenses of the refinance within a few years, go for it. If recovering 
the costs will take longer, refinancing may still make sense if you anticipate keep￾ing the property and mortgage that long.
Be wary of mortgage lenders or brokers who tout how soon your refinance will pay 
for itself; they usually oversimplify their calculations. For example, if the refi￾nance costs you $2,000 to complete (for appraisals, loan fees and points, title 
insurance, and so on) and reduces your monthly payment by $100, lenders or 
brokers typically say that it’s going to take 20 months for you to recoup the refi￾nance costs. This estimate isn’t accurate, however, because you lose some tax 
write-offs if your mortgage-interest rate and payment are reduced. You can’t sim￾ply look at the reduced amount of your monthly payment. (Mortgage lenders like CHAPTER 15 Investing in Real Estate: Your Home and Beyond 311
to look at it, however, because it makes refinancing more attractive.) And your 
new mortgage will be reset to a different term than the number of years remain￾ing on your old one.
If you want a better estimate of your likely cost savings but don’t want to spend 
hours crunching numbers, take your combined federal and state income tax 
rate — for example, 27 percent — and reduce your monthly payment savings on 
the refinance by this amount (see Chapter 8). Continuing with the example in the 
preceding paragraph, if your monthly payment drops by $100, you’re really saving 
about $73 a month after factoring in the lost tax benefits. So it takes about 
28 months ($2,000 divided by $73) — not 20 — to recoup the refinance costs.
Note that not all refinances cost big money. So-called no-cost refinances or no￾point loans minimize your out-of-pocket expenses, but as I discuss earlier in this 
chapter, they may not be your best long-term options. Such loans usually come 
with higher interest rates.
Using money for another purpose
Refinancing to pull out cash from your home for some other purpose can make 
good financial sense because under most circumstances, mortgage interest is 
tax-deductible. Paying off other higher-interest consumer debt  — such as on 
credit cards or on an auto loan — is a common reason for borrowing against a 
home. The interest on consumer debt is not tax-deductible and is generally at a 
much higher interest rate than what mortgages charge you.
If you’re starting a business, consider borrowing against your home to finance 
the launch of your business. You can usually do so at a lower cost than with a 
business loan.
You need to find out whether a lender is willing to lend you more money against 
the equity in your home (which is the difference between the market value of your 
house and the loan balance). You can use Table 15-1 earlier in this chapter to esti￾mate the maximum loan for which you may qualify.
Changing loans
You may want to refinance even though you aren’t forced to raise cash or aren’t 
able to save money. Perhaps you’re not comfortable with your current loan — 
holders of adjustable-rate mortgages often face this problem. You may find out 
that a fluctuating mortgage payment makes you anxious and wreaks havoc on 
your budget.312 PART 3 Building Wealth through Investing
Paying money to go from an adjustable to a fixed rate is similar to buying insur￾ance. The cost of the refinance is “insuring” you a level mortgage payment. Con￾sider this option only if you want peace of mind and you plan to stay with the 
property for a number of years.
Sometimes jumping from one adjustable to another makes sense. Suppose that 
you can lower the maximum lifetime interest rate cap and the refinance won’t 
cost much. Your new loan should have a lower initial interest rate than the one 
you’re paying on your current loan. Even if you don’t save megabucks, the peace 
of mind of a lower ceiling can make refinancing worth your while.
Mortgage life insurance
Shortly after you buy a home or close on a mortgage, you start getting pitches 
from all kinds of organizations that keep track of publicly available information 
about mortgages. Most of these organizations want to sell you something, and 
they don’t tend to beat around the bush. “What will your dependents do if you 
meet with an untimely demise and they’re left with a gargantuan mortgage?” 
these organizations ask. In fact, this is a good financial-planning question. If your 
family is dependent on your income, can they survive financially if you pass away?
Don’t waste your money on mortgage life insurance. You may need life insurance 
to provide for your family and help meet large obligations such as mortgage pay￾ments or educational expenses for your children, but mortgage life insurance is 
typically grossly overpriced. (Check out the life insurance section in Chapter 17 for 
advice about term life insurance.) Consider mortgage life insurance only if you 
have a health problem and the mortgage life insurer doesn’t require a physical 
examination. Be sure to compare it with term life options.
Considering a reverse mortgage
Some homeowners find, particularly in their later years of retirement, that they 
lack cash. The home in which they live is usually their largest asset. Unlike other 
investments, such as bank accounts, bonds, or stocks, a home does not provide 
any income to owners unless they decide to rent out a room or two.
A reverse mortgage allows a homeowner who is 62 years of age or older and low on 
cash to tap home equity. For an elderly homeowner, using home equity can be a 
difficult thing to do psychologically. Most people work hard to pay a mortgage 
month after month, year after year, until it’s finally all paid off. What a feat and 
what a relief after all those years!CHAPTER 15 Investing in Real Estate: Your Home and Beyond 313
Taking out a reverse mortgage reverses this process. Each month, the reverse 
mortgage lender sends you a check that you can spend on food, clothing, travel, or 
whatever you want. The money you receive each month is really a loan from the 
bank against the value of your home, which makes the monthly check free from 
taxation. (There are other payment options such as a lump sum or line of credit.) 
A reverse mortgage also allows you to stay in your home and use its equity to sup￾plement your monthly income.
The main drawback of a reverse mortgage is that it can diminish the estate that 
you may want to pass on to your heirs or use for some other purpose. Also, some 
loans require repayment within a certain number of years. The fees and the effec￾tive interest rate you’re charged to borrow the money can be quite high.
Because some loans require the lender to make monthly payments to you as long 
as you live in the home, lenders assume that you’ll live many years in your home 
so they won’t lose money when making these loans. If you end up keeping the 
loan for only a few years because you move, for example, the cost of the loan is 
extremely high.
You may be able to create a reverse mortgage with your relatives. This technique 
can work if you have family members who are financially able to provide you with 
monthly income in exchange for ownership of the home when you pass away.
You have other alternatives to tapping the equity in your home. Simply selling 
your home and buying a less expensive property (or renting) is one option. Under 
current tax laws, qualifying house sellers can exclude a sizable portion of their 
profits from capital gains tax: up to $250,000 for single taxpayers and $500,000 
for married couples.
Selling your house
If you’re going to sell your house, make sure you can afford to buy the next home 
you desire. Be especially careful if you’re a trade-up buyer — that is, if you’re 
going to buy an even more expensive home. All the affordability issues discussed 
at the beginning of this chapter apply. You also need to consider the following 
issues.
Selling through an agent
When you’re selling a property, you want an agent who can get the job done effi￾ciently and sell your house for as much as possible. As a seller, you need to seek 
an agent who has marketing and sales expertise and is willing to put in the time 314 PART 3 Building Wealth through Investing
and money necessary to sell your house. Don’t necessarily be impressed by an 
agent who works for a large company. What matters more is what the agent will 
do to market your property.
When you list your house for sale, the contract you sign with the listing agent 
includes specification of the commission to be paid if the agent is successful in 
selling your house. In most areas of the country, agents usually ask for a 5- to 
6-percent commission. In an area that has lower-cost housing, they may ask for 
7 percent.
Remember that commissions are always negotiable. Because the commission is a 
percentage, you have a much greater possibility of getting a lower commission on 
a higher-priced house. If an agent makes 6 percent selling both a $200,000 house 
and a $100,000 house, the agent makes twice as much on the $200,000 house. Yet 
selling the higher-priced house does not take twice as much work. (Selling a 
$400,000 house certainly doesn’t take four times the effort of selling a $100,000 
house.)
If you’re selling a higher-priced home (above $250,000), you have no reason to pay 
more than a 5-percent commission. For expensive properties ($500,000 and up), a 
4-percent commission may be reasonable. You may find, however, that your ability 
to negotiate a lower commission is greatest when an offer is on the table. Because 
you don’t want to give other agents (working with buyers) a reason not to sell your 
house, have your listing agent cut his take rather than reduce the commission that 
you advertise you’re willing to pay to an agent who brings you a buyer.
In terms of the length of the listing sales agreement you make with an agent, 
three to six months is reasonable. When you give an agent a listing that’s too long 
in duration (for example, 12 months), the agent may simply toss your listing into 
the multiple listing book and expend little effort to sell your property. Practically 
speaking, if your home hasn’t sold, you can fire your agent whenever you want, 
regardless of the length of the listing agreement. However, a shorter listing may 
be more motivating for your agent.
Selling without a real-estate agent
You may be tempted to sell without an agent so you can save the commission 
that’s deducted from your house’s sale price. If you have the time, energy, and 
marketing experience and you can take the time to properly value your home, you 
can sell your house without an agent and possibly save some money.CHAPTER 15 Investing in Real Estate: Your Home and Beyond 315
The major problem with attempting to sell your house on your own is that agents 
who are working with buyers don’t generally look for or show their clients prop￾erties that are for sale by owner. Besides saving you time, a good agent can help 
ensure that you’re not sued for failing to disclose the known defects of your prop￾erty. If you decide to sell your house on your own, make sure you have access to a 
legal advisor who can review the contracts. Whether you sell through an agent or 
not, be sure to read the latest edition of House Selling For Dummies (Wiley), which I 
co-wrote with real-estate expert Ray Brown.
Should you keep your home until prices go up?
Some homeowners are tempted to hold on to their properties (when they need to 
move) if the property is worth less than when they bought it for or if the real￾estate market is soft. Renting out your property probably isn’t worth the hassle, 
and holding on to it probably isn’t worth the financial gamble. If you need to 
move, you’re better off, in most cases, selling your house.
You may reason that, in a few years (during which you’d rent the property), the 
real-estate storm clouds will clear, and you’ll be able to sell your property at a 
much higher price. Here are three risks associated with this line of thinking:
» You can’t know whether property prices in the next few years are going to 
rebound, stay the same, or drop even further. A property generally needs to 
appreciate at least a few percent per year just to make up for all the costs of 
holding and maintaining it.
» You may be unprepared for legal issues and dealings with your tenants. If 
you’ve never been a landlord, don’t underestimate the hassle and headaches 
associated with this job.
» If you convert your home into a rental property in the meantime and it 
appreciates in value, you’re going to pay capital gains tax on your profit when 
you sell it (and the taxable profit will be higher if you have taken tax deduc￾tions for depreciation during the rental period). This capital gains tax wipes 
out much of the advantage of having held on to the property until prices 
recovered. (If you want to be a long-term rental property owner, you can 
do a tax-free exchange into another rental property when you sell.)
However, if you would realize little cash from selling and you lack other money for 
the down payment to purchase your next property, you have good reason for 
holding on to a home that has dropped in value.316 PART 3 Building Wealth through Investing
Should you keep your home as investment 
property after you move?
Converting your home into rental property is worth considering if you need or 
want to move. Don’t consider doing so unless it really is a long-term proposition 
(ten years or more). As discussed in the preceding section, selling rental property 
has tax consequences.
If you want to convert your home into an investment property, you have an advan￾tage over someone who’s looking to buy an investment property, because you 
already own your home. Locating and buying investment property takes time and 
money. You also know what you have with your current home. If you go out and 
purchase a property to rent, you’re starting from scratch.
If your property is in good condition, consider what damage renters may do to it; 
few renters will take care of your home the way that you would. Also consider 
whether you’re cut out to be a landlord. For more information, see the section on 
real estate as an investment in Chapter 10.4

Insurance: Getting 
What You Need at 
the Best Price
Unless you work in the industry, you may find insurance to be a dreadfully 
boring topic. Most people associate insurance with disease, death, and 
disaster and would rather do just about anything other than review their 
policies or spend money on insurance. But because you won’t want to deal with 
money hassles when you’re coping with catastrophes — illness, disability, death, 
fires, floods, earthquakes, and so on — you should secure insurance well before
you need it. Also, insurers won’t sell you a policy to cover a negative event that has 
already happened!
Insurance is probably the most misunderstood and least monitored area of 
personal finance. Studies show that about 90 percent of Americans purchase and 
carry the wrong types and amounts of insurance coverage. My own experience as 
a financial counselor confirms this statistic. Many people are overwhelmed by all 
the jargon in sales and policy statements. Thus, they pay more than necessary for 
their policies and get coverage they don’t really need while failing to obtain cov￾erage that they really should have.

» Buying the right insurance at the 
best price
» Overcoming roadblocks to getting 
the coverage you need
» Securing your claim money when 
you’ve suffered a loss320 PART 4 Insurance: Protecting What You Have
In this chapter, I tell you how to determine what kinds of insurance you need, 
explain what you can do if you’re denied coverage, and give you advice on getting 
your claims paid. Later chapters discuss types of insurance in detail, including 
insurance on people (Chapter 17) and possessions (Chapter 18).
Discovering My Three Laws of 
Buying Insurance
I know your patience and interest in finding out about insurance is surely limited, 
so in this section I boil the subject down to three fairly simple but powerful con￾cepts that can easily save you big bucks. And while you’re saving money, you can 
still get the quality coverage you need in order to avoid a financial catastrophe.
Law I: Insure for the big stuff; 
don’t sweat the small stuff
What if you could buy insurance that would pay for the cost of a restaurant meal 
if you got food poisoning? Even if you were splurging at a fancy restaurant, you 
wouldn’t have a lot of money at stake, so you’d probably decline that coverage.
The point of insurance is to protect against losses that would be financially 
catastrophic to you, not to smooth out the bumps of everyday life. The preceding 
example about restaurant insurance is silly, but some people buy equally foolish 
policies without knowing it. In the following sections, I tell you how to get the 
most appropriate insurance coverage for your money. I start off with the “big￾gies” that are worth your money, and then I work down to some insurance options 
that are less worthy of your dollars.
Buy insurance to cover financial catastrophes
You want to insure against what could be a large financial loss for you or your 
dependents. The price of insurance isn’t cheap, but it’s relatively small in com￾parison to the potential total loss from a financial catastrophe.
The beauty of insurance is that it spreads risks over millions of other people. If your 
home were to burn to the ground, paying the rebuilding cost out of your own pocket 
probably would be a financial catastrophe. If you have insurance, the premiums 
paid by you and all the other homeowners collectively can easily pay the bills.CHAPTER 16 Insurance: Getting What You Need at the Best Price 321
Think for a moment about what your most valuable assets are. Also consider 
potential large expenses. Perhaps they include the following:
» Future income: During your working years, your most valuable asset is 
probably your future earnings. If you were disabled and unable to work, what 
would you live on? Long-term disability insurance exists to help you handle 
this type of situation. If you have a family that’s financially dependent on your 
earnings, how would your family manage if you died? Life insurance can fill 
the monetary void left by your death.
» Business: If you’re a business owner, what would happen if you were sued for 
hundreds of thousands of dollars or a million dollars or more for negligence 
in some work that you messed up? Liability insurance can protect you.
» Health: In this age of soaring medical costs, you can easily rack up a $100,000 
hospital bill in short order. You may think you’re healthy and you probably 
are, but someday out of nowhere that lower abdominal pain may turn into a 
costly emergency appendectomy. Major medical health insurance helps pay 
such expenses. And yet, a surprising number of people don’t carry any health 
insurance — particularly those who work in small businesses. (See Chapter 17 
for more on health insurance.)
Psychologically, buying insurance coverage for the little things that are more 
likely to occur is tempting. You don’t want to feel like you’re wasting your insur￾ance dollars. You want to get some of your money back, darn it! You’re more likely
to get into a fender bender with your car or have a package lost in the mail than 
you are to lose your home to fire or suffer a long-term disability. But if the fender 
bender costs $500 (which you end up paying out of your pocket because you took 
my advice to take a high deductible; see the next section) or the postal service 
loses your package worth $50 or $100, you won’t be facing a financial disaster.
On the other hand, if you lose your ability to work at your job because of a dis￾ability, or if you’re sued for $1 million and you’re not insured against such catas￾trophes, not only will you be extremely unhappy, but you may also face financial 
ruin. “Yes, but what are the odds,” I hear people rationalize, “that I’ll suffer a 
long-term disability or that I’ll be sued for $1 million?” I agree that the odds are 
quite low, but the risk is there. The problem is that you just don’t know what, or 
when, bad luck may befall you.
And don’t make the mistake of thinking that you can figure the odds better than 
the insurance companies can. The insurance companies predict the probability of 
your making a claim, large or small, with a great deal of accuracy. They employ 
numerous number-crunching actuaries to calculate the odds that bad things will 
happen and the frequency of current policyholders’ making particular types of 
claims. The companies then price their policies accordingly.322 PART 4 Insurance: Protecting What You Have
So buying (or not buying) insurance based on your perception of the likelihood of 
needing the coverage is unwise. Insurance companies aren’t stupid; in fact, 
they’re ruthlessly smart! When insurance companies price policies, they look at a 
number of factors to determine the likelihood of your filing a claim. Take the 
example of auto insurance. Who do you think will pay more for auto insurance — 
a single male who’s age 20, lives the fast life in a high-crime city, drives a turbo 
sports car, and has received two speeding tickets in the past year? Or a couple in 
their 40s, living in a low-crime area, driving a four-door sedan, and having a 
clean driving record?
Take the highest deductible you can afford
Most insurance policies have deductibles — the maximum amount you must pay in 
the event of a loss before your insurance coverage kicks in and begins paying out. 
On many policies, such as auto and homeowner’s/renter’s coverage, many folks 
opt for a $100 to $250 deductible.
Here are some benefits of taking a higher deductible:
» You save premium dollars. Year in and year out, you can enjoy the lower 
cost of an insurance policy with a high deductible. You may be able to shave 
15 to 20 percent off the cost of your policy. Suppose, for example, that you 
can reduce the cost of your policy by $150 per year by raising your deductible 
from $250 to $1,000. That $750 worth of coverage is costing you $150 per 
year. Thus, you’d need to have a claim of $1,000 or more every five years — 
highly unlikely — to come out ahead. If you’re that accident-prone, guess 
what? The insurance company will raise your premiums.
» You don’t have the hassles of filing small claims. If you have a $300 loss on 
a policy with a $100 deductible, you need to file a claim to get your $200 (the 
amount you’re covered for after your deductible). Filing an insurance claim 
can be an aggravating experience that takes hours of time. In some cases, you 
may even have your claim denied after jumping through all the necessary 
hoops. Getting your due may require prolonged haggling.
When you have low deductibles, you may file more claims (although this doesn’t 
necessarily mean that you’ll get more money). After filing more claims, you may 
be “rewarded” with higher premiums — in addition to the headache you get from 
preparing all those blasted forms! Filing more claims may even cause cancellation 
of your coverage!
Avoid small-potato policies
A good insurance policy can seem expensive. A policy that doesn’t cost much, on 
the other hand, can fool you into thinking that you’re getting something for next CHAPTER 16 Insurance: Getting What You Need at the Best Price 323
to nothing. Policies that cost little also cover little — they’re priced low because 
they don’t cover large potential losses.
Following are examples of common “small-potato” insurance policies that are 
generally a waste of your hard-earned dollars. As you read through this list, you 
may find examples of policies that you bought and that you feel paid for them￾selves. I can hear you saying, “But I collected on that policy you’re telling me not 
to buy!” Sure, getting “reimbursed” for the hassle of having something go wrong 
is comforting. But consider all such policies that you bought or may buy over the 
course of your life. You’re not going to come out ahead in the aggregate — if you 
did, insurance companies would lose money! These policies aren’t worth the cost 
relative to the small potential benefit. On average, insurance companies pay out 
just 60 cents in benefits on every dollar collected. Many of the following policies 
pay back even less — around 20 cents in benefits (claims) for every insurance 
premium dollar spent:
» Extended warranty and repair plans: Isn’t it ironic that right after a sales￾person or company persuades you to buy a particular television, computer, or 
car — in part by saying how reliable the product is — it tries to convince you 
to spend more money to insure against the failure of the item? If the product 
is so good, why do you need such insurance?
Extended warranty and repair plans are expensive and unnecessary short-term 
insurance policies. Product manufacturers’ warranties typically cover any 
problems that occur in the first year or even several years. After that, paying for 
a repair out of your own pocket isn’t a financial catastrophe. (Some credit-card 
issuers automatically double the manufacturer’s warranty without additional 
charge on items purchased with their card. However, the cards that do this 
typically are higher-cost premium cards, so this is no free lunch — you’re paying 
for this protection in terms of higher fees.)
» Home warranty plans: If your real-estate agent or the seller of a home wants 
to pay the cost of a home warranty plan for you, turning down the offer would 
be ungracious. (As Grandma would say, you shouldn’t look a gift horse in the 
mouth.) But don’t buy this type of plan for yourself. In addition to requiring 
some sort of fee (around $50 to $100), home warranty plans limit how much 
they’ll pay for problems.
Your money is best spent hiring a competent inspector to uncover problems 
and fix them before you purchase the home. If you buy a house, you should 
expect to spend money on repairs and maintenance; don’t waste money 
purchasing insurance for such expenses.
» Dental insurance: If your employer pays for dental insurance, you can take 
advantage of it. But don’t pay for this coverage on your own. Dental insurance 
generally covers a couple of teeth cleanings each year and limits payments for 
more expensive work.324 PART 4 Insurance: Protecting What You Have
» Credit life and credit disability policies: Credit life policies pay a small 
benefit if you die with an outstanding loan. Credit disability policies pay a 
small monthly income in the event of a disability. Banks and their credit-card 
divisions usually sell these policies. Some companies sell insurance to pay 
off your credit-card bill in the event of your death or disability, or to cover 
minimum monthly payments for a temporary period during specified life 
transition events (such as loss of a job, divorce, and so on).
The cost of such insurance seems low, but that’s because the potential 
benefits are relatively small. In fact, given what little insurance you’re buying, 
these policies are expensive. If you need life or disability insurance, purchase 
it. But get enough coverage, and buy it in a separate, cost-effective policy 
(see Chapter 17 for more details).
If you’re in poor health and you can buy these insurance policies without a 
medical evaluation, you may represent an exception to the “don’t buy it” rule. 
In this case, these policies may be the only ones to which you have access — 
another reason these policies are expensive. The people in good health are 
paying for the people with poor health who can enroll without a medical 
examination and who undoubtedly file more claims.
» Daily hospitalization insurance: Hospitalization insurance policies that pay a 
certain amount per day, such as $100, prey on people’s fears of running up 
big hospital bills. Healthcare is expensive — there’s no doubt about that.
But what you really need is a comprehensive (major medical) health insurance 
policy. One day in the hospital can lead to thousands, even tens of thousands, 
of dollars in charges, so that $100-per-day policy may pay for less than an 
hour of your 24-hour day! Daily hospitalization policies don’t cover the 
big-ticket expenses. If you lack a comprehensive health insurance policy, 
make sure you get one (see Chapter 17)!
» Packages in the mail: You buy a $40 gift for a friend, and when you go to the 
post office to ship it, the friendly postal clerk asks whether you want to insure 
it. For a few bucks, you think, “Why not?” The U.S. Postal Service may have 
a bad reputation for many reasons, but it rarely loses or damages things. 
Go spend your money on something else — or better yet, invest it.
» Cellphone insurance: I understand that if you just shelled out $800 or more 
for the latest smartphone (especially if you bought one for a teenager in your 
household), you’d want to protect against the loss or damage of said device. 
If you can’t afford to replace such a costly cellphone, then I would argue don’t 
spend that much on one in the first place. But if you insist on costly smart￾phone purchases, the insurance isn’t worth it. My review of recent plans 
shows that the coverage will cost you $300 to $350 just for the first two years. 
If you do have a loss, you’ll also get whacked with a $100 to $200 deductible!CHAPTER 16 Insurance: Getting What You Need at the Best Price 325
» Little stuff riders: Many policies that are worth buying, such as auto and 
disability insurance, can have all sorts of riders added on. These riders are 
extra bells and whistles that insurance agents and companies like to sell 
because of the high profit margin they provide (for them). On auto insurance 
policies, for example, you can buy a rider for a few bucks per year that pays 
you $25 each time your car needs to be towed. Having your vehicle towed isn’t 
going to bankrupt you, so it isn’t worth insuring against.
Likewise, small insurance policies that are sold as add-ons to bigger insurance 
policies are usually unnecessary and overpriced. For example, you can buy 
some disability insurance policies with a small amount of life insurance added 
on. If you need life insurance, purchasing a sufficient amount in a separate 
policy is less costly.
Law II: Buy broad coverage
Purchasing coverage that’s too narrow is another mistake people make when buy￾ing insurance. Such policies often seem like cheap ways to put your fears to rest. 
For example, instead of buying life insurance, some folks buy flight insurance at an 
airport self-service kiosk. They seem to worry more about their mortality when 
getting on an airplane than they do when getting into a car. If they die on the flight, 
their beneficiaries collect. But should they die the next day in an auto accident or 
get some dreaded disease — which is statistically far more likely than going down 
in a jet — the beneficiaries get nothing from flight insurance. Buy life insurance 
(broad coverage to protect your loved ones financially in the event of your untimely 
demise, no matter the cause), not flight insurance (narrow coverage).
The medical equivalent of flight insurance is cancer insurance. Older people, who 
are fearful of having their life savings depleted by a long battle with this dreaded 
disease, are easy prey for this narrow insurance. If you get cancer, cancer insur￾ance pays the bills. But what if you get heart disease, diabetes, or some other 
disease? Cancer insurance won’t pay these costs. Purchase major medical cover￾age, not cancer insurance.
Recognizing fears
Fears, such as getting cancer, are natural and inescapable. Although you may not 
have control over the emotions that your fears invoke, you must often ignore 
those emotions in order to make rational insurance decisions. In other words, 
getting shaky in the knees and sweaty in the palms when boarding an airplane is 
okay, but letting your fear of flying cause you to make poor insurance decisions is 
not okay, especially when those decisions affect the financial security of your 
loved ones.326 PART 4 Insurance: Protecting What You Have
Preparing for natural disasters — 
insurance and otherwise
In the chapters following this one, in which I discuss specific types of insurance 
such as disability insurance and homeowner’s insurance, I highlight the fact that 
you’ll find it nearly impossible to get coverage that includes every possibility of 
catastrophe. For example, when purchasing homeowner’s coverage, you find that 
losses from floods and earthquakes are excluded. You can secure such coverage in 
EXAMINING MISPERCEPTIONS OF RISKS
How high do you think your risks are for expiring prematurely if you’re exposed to toxic 
wastes or pesticides, or if you live in a dangerous area that has a high murder rate? Well, 
actually, these risks are quite small when compared to the risks you subject yourself to 
when you get behind the wheel of a car or light up yet another cigarette.
Now-retired reporter John Stossel (formerly with ABC News and FOX News) was kind 
enough to share with me the results of a study done for him by physicist Bernard 
Cohen. In the study, Cohen compared different risks. Cohen’s study showed that peo￾ple’s riskiest behaviors are smoking and driving. Smoking whacks an average of seven 
years off a person’s life, whereas driving a car results in a bit more than half a year of life 
lost, on average. Toxic waste shaves an average of one week off an American’s life span.
Unfortunately, you can’t buy a formal insurance policy to protect yourself against all 
life’s great dangers and risks. But that doesn’t mean that you must face these dangers 
as a helpless victim; simple changes in behavior can help you improve your security.
Personal health habits are a good example of the types of behavior you can change. If 
you’re overweight and you eat unhealthy, highly processed foods, drink alcohol exces￾sively, and don’t exercise, you’re asking for trouble, especially during post–middle age. 
Engage in these habits, and you dramatically increase your risk of heart disease and 
cancer.
You can buy all the types of traditional insurance that I recommend in this book and still 
not be well protected for the simple reason that you’re overlooking uninsurable risks. 
However, not being able to buy formal insurance to protect against some dangers 
doesn’t mean that you can’t drastically reduce your exposure to such risks by modifying 
your behavior. For example, you can’t buy an auto insurance policy that protects your 
personal safety against drunk drivers, who are responsible for about 10,000 American 
deaths annually. However, you can choose to drive a safe car, practice safe driving hab￾its, and minimize driving on the roads during the late evening hours and on major holi￾days when drinking is prevalent (such as New Year’s Eve, July 4th, and so on).CHAPTER 16 Insurance: Getting What You Need at the Best Price 327
separate policies, which you should do if you live in an area subject to such risks 
(see more on this in Chapter 18). Many people don’t understand these risks, and 
insurers don’t always educate customers about such gaping holes in their 
policies.
In addition to filling those voids, also think about and plan for the nonfinancial 
issues that inevitably arise in a catastrophe. For example, make sure you have
» A meeting place for you and your loved ones if you’re separated during a 
disaster (and an out-of-area person to serve as a common point of contact)
» An escape plan in the event that your area is hit with flooding or some other 
natural disaster (tornado, hurricane, earthquake, fire, or mudslide)
» The security of having taken steps to make your home safer in the event of an 
earthquake or fire (for instance, securing shelving and heavy objects from 
falling and tipping, and installing smoke detectors and fire extinguishers)
» A plan for what you’ll do for food, clothing, and shelter should your home 
become uninhabitable
You get the idea. Although you can’t possibly predict what’s going to happen and 
when, you can find out about the risks of your area. In addition to buying the 
broadest possible coverage, you should also make contingency plans for disasters.
Law III: Shop around and buy direct
Whether you’re looking at auto, home, life, disability, or other types of coverage, 
some companies charge double or triple the rates that other companies charge for 
the same coverage. Insurers that charge the higher rates may not be better about 
paying claims, however. You may even end up with the worst of both possible 
worlds — high prices and lousy service.
Most insurance is sold through agents and brokers who earn commissions based 
on what they sell. The commissions, of course, can bias what they recommend.
Not surprisingly, policies that pay agents the biggest commissions also tend to be 
more costly. In fact, insurance companies compete for the attention of agents by 
offering bigger commissions. When I browse media targeted to insurance agents, 
I see ads in which the largest text is the commission percentage offered to agents 
who sell the advertiser’s products.
Besides the attraction of policies that pay higher commissions, agents also get 
hooked, financially speaking, on companies whose policies they sell frequently. 
After an agent sells a certain amount of a company’s insurance policies, they are 328 PART 4 Insurance: Protecting What You Have
rewarded with bigger commission percentages (and other perks) on any future 
sales. Just as airlines bribe frequent fliers with mileage bonuses, insurers bribe 
agents with heftier commissions and awards such as trips and costly goods.
Shopping around is a challenge not only because most insurance is sold by agents 
working on commission, but also because insurers set their rates in mysterious 
ways. Every company has a different way of analyzing how much of a risk you are; 
one company may offer low rates to me but not to you, and vice versa.
Despite the obstacles, several strategies exist for obtaining low-cost, high￾quality policies. The following sections offer smart ways to shop for insurance. 
(Chapters 17 and 18 recommend how and where to get the best deals on specific 
types of policies.)
Looking at employer and other group plans
When you buy insurance as part of a larger group, you generally get a lower price 
because of the purchasing power of the group. Most of the health and disability 
policies that you can access through your employer are less costly than equivalent 
coverage you can buy on your own.
Likewise, many occupations have professional associations through which you 
may be able to obtain lower-cost policies. Not all associations offer better deals on 
insurance — compare their policy features and costs with other options.
Life insurance is an exception to the rule that group policies offer better value 
than individual policies. Group life insurance plans usually aren’t cheaper than 
the best life insurance policies that you can buy individually. However, group poli￾cies may have the attraction of convenience (ease of enrollment and avoidance of 
lengthy sales pitches from life insurance salespeople). Group life insurance poli￾cies that allow you to enroll without a medical evaluation are usually more expen￾sive, because such plans attract more people with health problems who can’t get 
coverage on their own. If you’re in good health, you should definitely shop around 
for life insurance (see Chapter 17 to find out how).
Insurance agents who want to sell you an individual policy can come up with 101 
reasons why buying from them is preferable to buying through your employer or 
some other group. In most cases, agents’ arguments for buying an individual pol￾icy from them include self-serving hype.
One valid issue that agents raise is that if you leave your job, you’ll lose your group 
coverage. Sometimes that may be true. For example, if you know that you’re going 
to be leaving your job to become self-employed, securing an individual disability CHAPTER 16 Insurance: Getting What You Need at the Best Price 329
policy before you leave your job makes sense. However, your employer’s health 
insurer may allow you to buy an individual policy when you leave.
In Chapter 17, I explain what you need in the policies you’re looking for so you can 
determine whether a group plan meets your needs.
Buying insurance without paying sales 
commissions
Buying policies from the increasing number of companies that are selling their 
policies directly to the public without the insurance agent and the agent’s com￾mission is your best bet for getting a good insurance value. Just as you can pur￾chase no-load mutual funds directly from an investment company without paying 
any sales commission (see Chapter 11), you also can buy no-load insurance. Be 
sure to read Chapters 17 and 18 for more specifics on how to buy insurance directly 
from insurance companies.
Annuities, investment/insurance products traditionally sold through insurance 
agents, are also available directly to the customer, without commission. Simply 
contact some of the leading no-load mutual fund companies (see Chapter 12).
THE STRAIGHT SCOOP ON COMMISSIONS
The commission paid to an insurance agent is never disclosed through any of the 
documents or materials that you receive when buying insurance. The only way you 
can know what the commission is and how it compares with other policies is to ask 
the agent. Nothing is wrong or impolite about asking. After all, your money pays the 
commission. You need to know whether a particular policy is being pitched harder 
because of its higher commission.
Commissions are typically paid as a percentage of the first year’s premium on the 
insurance policy. (Many policies pay smaller commissions on subsequent years’ 
premiums.) With life and disability insurance policies, for example, a 50-percent 
commission on the first year’s premium is not unusual. With life insurance policies 
that have a cash value, commissions of 80 to 100 percent of your first year’s premium 
are possible. Commissions on health insurance are lower but generally not as low as 
commissions on auto and homeowner’s insurance.330 PART 4 Insurance: Protecting What You Have
Dealing with Insurance Problems
When you seek out insurance or have insurance policies, sooner or later you’re 
bound to hit a roadblock. Although insurance problems can be quite frustrating, in 
the following sections, I explain how to successfully deal with the more common 
obstacles.
Knowing what to do if you’re 
denied coverage
Just as you can be turned down when you apply for a loan, you can also be turned 
down when applying for insurance. With life or disability insurance, a company 
may reject you if you have an existing medical problem (a preexisting condition) 
and are therefore more likely to file a claim. When it comes to insuring assets such 
as a home, you may have difficulty getting coverage if the property is deemed to 
be in a high-risk area.
Here are some strategies to employ if you’re denied coverage:
» Ask the insurer why you were denied. Perhaps the company made a 
mistake or misinterpreted some information that you provided in your 
application. If you’re denied coverage because of a medical condition, find 
out what information the company has on you and determine whether 
it’s accurate.
» Request a copy of your medical information file. Just as you have a credit 
report file that details your use (and misuse) of credit, you also have a medical 
information report. Once per year, you can request a free copy of your 
medical information file (which typically highlights only the more significant 
problems over the past seven years, not your entire medical file or history) by 
calling 866-692-6901 or visiting the website at www.mib.com. If you find a 
mistake on your report, you have the right to request that it be fixed. 
However, the burden is on you to prove that the information in your file is 
incorrect. Proving that your file contains errors can be a major hassle — you 
may even need to contact physicians you saw in the past, because their 
medical records may be the source of the incorrect information.
» Shop other companies. Just because one company denies you coverage (for 
example, with disability or life insurance) doesn’t mean all insurance compa￾nies will do the same. Some insurers better understand certain medical 
conditions and are more comfortable accepting applicants with those 
conditions. While most insurers charge higher rates to people with blemished 
medical histories than they do to people with perfect health records, some CHAPTER 16 Insurance: Getting What You Need at the Best Price 331
companies penalize them less than others. Agents who sell policies from 
multiple insurers, called independent agents, can be helpful, because they can 
shop among a number of different companies.
» Find out about state high-risk pools. Before the passage of the Affordable 
Care Act (also known as Obamacare), most states acted as the insurer of last 
resort and provided basic insurance, through high-risk pools, for those who 
couldn’t get it from insurance companies. Because health insurers can no 
longer deny coverage due to preexisting health problems, numerous states 
have ended their high-risk pools. The Health Insurance Resource Center 
website at www.healthinsurance.org/obamacare/risk-pools/ provides 
links to all state health coverage high-risk pool websites still offering such 
coverage. Alternatively, you can check with your state department of insur￾ance (content.naic.org/state-insurance-departments) for high-risk 
pools for other types of insurance, such as property coverage.
» Check for coverage availability before you buy. If you’re considering buying 
a home, for example, and you can’t get coverage, the insurance companies 
are trying to tell you something. What they’re effectively saying is “We think 
that property is so high-risk, we’re not willing to insure it even if you pay a high 
premium.”
Getting your due on claims
In the event that you suffer a loss and file an insurance claim, you naturally hope 
that your insurance company will cheerfully and expeditiously pay your claim. 
Given all the money that you shelled out for coverage and all the hoops you jumped 
through to get approved for coverage in the first place, that’s a reasonable 
expectation.
Insurance companies may refuse to pay you what you think they owe you for 
many reasons, however. In some cases, your claim may not be covered under the 
terms of the policy. At a minimum, the insurer wants documentation and proof of 
your loss. Due to a small incidence of insurance fraud, insurers won’t simply take 
your word, no matter how honest and ethical you are.
Some insurers view paying claims as an adversarial situation and take a “negoti￾ate tough” stance. Thinking that all insurance companies are going to pay you a 
fair and reasonable amount even if you don’t make your voice heard is a mistake.
The tips I discuss in this section can help you ensure that you get paid what your 
policy entitles you to.332 PART 4 Insurance: Protecting What You Have
Documenting your assets and case
When you’re insuring assets, such as your home and its contents, having a record 
of what you own can be helpful if you need to file a claim. The best defense is a 
good offense. If you keep records of valuables and can document their cost, you 
should be in good shape. A video is the most efficient record for documenting your 
assets, but a handwritten list detailing your possessions works, too. Just remem￾ber to keep this record someplace away from your home — if your home burns to 
the ground, you’ll lose your documentation, too!
If you’re robbed or are the victim of an accident, get the names, addresses, and 
phone numbers of witnesses. Take pictures of property damage and solicit esti￾mates for the cost of repairing or replacing whatever has been lost or damaged. 
File police reports when appropriate, if for no other reason than to bolster your 
documentation for the insurance claim.
Preparing your case
Filing a claim should be viewed the same way as preparing for a court trial or an 
IRS audit. Any information you provide verbally or in writing can and will be used 
against you to deny your claim. First, you should understand whether your policy 
covers your claim (this is why getting the broadest possible coverage helps). 
Unfortunately, the only way to find out whether the policy covers your claim is to 
read it. Policies are hard to read because they use legal language in non-user￾friendly ways.
A possible alternative to reading your policy is to call the claims department and, 
without providing your name (and using caller ID blocking on your phone if you’re 
calling from home), ask a representative whether a particular loss (such as the 
one that you just suffered) is covered under its policy. You have no need to lie to 
the company, but you don’t have to tell the representative who you are and that 
you’re about to file a claim, either. Your call is so you can understand what your 
policy covers. However, some companies aren’t willing to provide detailed infor￾mation unless a specific case is cited.
After you initiate the claims process, keep records of all conversations and copies 
of all the documents you give to the insurer’s claims department. If you have 
problems down the road, this “evidence” may bail you out.
For property damage, get at least a couple of reputable contractors’ estimates. 
Demonstrate to the insurance company that you’re trying to shop for a low price, 
but don’t agree to use a low-cost contractor without knowing that they can do 
quality work.CHAPTER 16 Insurance: Getting What You Need at the Best Price 333
Approaching your claim as a negotiation
To get what you’re owed on an insurance claim, you must approach most claims’ 
filings for what they are — a negotiation with a party that’s often uncooperative. 
And the bigger the claim, the more your insurer will play the part of adversary.
A number of years ago, when I filed a homeowner’s insurance claim after a major 
rain and wind storm significantly damaged my backyard fence, I was greeted on a 
weekday by a perky, smiley adjuster. When the adjuster entered my yard and 
started to peruse the damage, her demeanor changed dramatically. She had a 
combative, hard-bargainer type attitude that I last witnessed when I worked on 
some labor-management negotiations during my days as a consultant.
The adjuster stood on my back porch, a good distance away from the fences that 
had been blown over by wind and crushed by two large trees, and said that my 
insurer preferred to repair damaged fences rather than replace them. “With your 
deductible of $1,000, I doubt this will be worth filing a claim for,” she said.
The fence that had blown over, she reasoned, could have new posts set in concrete. 
Because we had already begun to clean up some of the damage for safety reasons, 
I presented to her some pictures of what the yard looked like right after the storm; 
she refused to take them. She took some measurements and said that she’d have 
her settlement check to us in a couple of days. The settlement she faxed was for 
$1,119 — nowhere near what it would cost me to fix the damage that was done.
Practicing persistency
When you take an insurance company’s first offer and don’t fight for what you’re 
due, you may be leaving a lot of money on the table. To make my long fence-repair 
story somewhat shorter, after five rounds of haggling with the adjusters, supervi￾sors, and finally managers, I was awarded payment to replace the fences and clean 
up most of the damage. Even though all the contractors I contacted recommended 
that the work be done this way, the insurance adjuster discredited their recom￾mendations by saying, “Contractors try to jack up the price and recommended 
work once they know an insurer is involved.”
My final total settlement came to $4,888, more than $3,700 higher than the 
insurer’s first offer. Interestingly, my insurer backed off its preference for repair￾ing the fence when the contractor’s estimates for doing that work exceeded the 
cost of a new fence.
I was disappointed with the behavior of that insurance company. I know from 
conversations with others that my homeowner’s insurance company (at that 
time) was not unusual in its adversarial strategy, especially with larger claims. 
And to think that this insurer at the time had one of the better track records for 
paying claims!334 PART 4 Insurance: Protecting What You Have
Enlisting support
If you’re doing your homework and you’re not making progress with the insurer’s 
adjuster, ask to speak with supervisors and managers. This is the strategy I used 
to get the additional $3,700 needed to get things back to where they were before 
the storm.
WHEN INSURERS (AND GOVERNMENT) 
MOVE SLOWLY
When Hurricane Katrina caused unprecedented damage and loss along the Gulf Coast, 
I received many complaints from folks in that region. Typical is the following note 
I received from a New Orleans family more than three months after Hurricane Katrina:
“We had substantial damage to our home in New Orleans due to Hurricane Katrina. 
We had roof damage on August 29th and three feet of water August 31st. Our flood 
insurance is through an insurance company acting as an agent for FEMA’s program. 
Our adjuster has still not turned in the necessary paperwork for our claim. Our home 
insurer made no allowance for proper removal and disposal of asbestos shingles, and 
we have gotten just $2,000 for living expenses out of the $21,000 we’re now owed. 
We have just gotten a first partial payment ($40,000 out of $160,000) on the flood 
insurance, but it was made out to the wrong mortgage company, so we had to send 
the check back.
“It is shocking that it has gone on this long. It has been all over the papers about the 
delay of some flood insurance payments being due to FEMA not having adequate 
money in the till. There’s no doubt the insurers are overwhelmed, but why is this taking 
so long? I called the Louisiana Department of Insurance and was told that insurers 
normally have 30 days for claims according to the insurance department (who has 
said they can have 45 days in this case). It’s been over 60 days since the adjuster came 
out to our home.”
Stories like this make me disappointed and mad. There’s simply no excuse for large 
insurance companies who are in the business of insuring for such events not to bring 
the proper resources to bear to make timely payments. The fact that they did not do so 
for Gulf Coast victims is even more reprehensible given the widespread problems in 
that area. In addition to home losses, many people also had job losses to deal with and 
could ill afford to be without money. Large insurers that wrote flood policies for which 
FEMA temporarily lacked money should have paid their policyholders. Although the 
federal government and FEMA officials should have been taken to task for allowing 
FEMA’s accounts to run dry, customer-service-oriented insurers should have stepped up 
and advanced money that they knew would eventually come from FEMA.CHAPTER 16 Insurance: Getting What You Need at the Best Price 335
The agent who sold you the policy may be helpful in preparing and filing the 
claim. A good agent can help increase your chances of getting paid — and getting 
paid sooner. If you’re having difficulty with a claim for a policy obtained through 
your employer or other group, speak with the benefits department or a person 
responsible for interacting with the insurer. These folks have a lot of clout, because 
the agent and/or insurer doesn’t want to lose the entire account.
If you’re having problems getting a fair settlement from the insurer of a policy 
you bought on your own, try contacting the state department of insurance. You 
can find the phone number possibly in your insurance policy, or you can peruse 
the list at the National Association of Insurance Commissioners website at www.
naic.org (select your state on the home page link for “Insurance Departments” 
on its home page to find links to department of insurance websites for each state).
Hiring a public adjuster who, for a percentage of the payment (typically 5 to 
10 percent), can negotiate with insurers on your behalf is another option.
When all else fails and you have a major claim at stake, try contacting an attorney 
who specializes in insurance matters. You can find these specialists through legal 
websites such as www.nolo.com or by searching for “Attorneys — Insurance Law” 
through a search engine. Expect to pay $150+ per hour. Look for a lawyer who’s 
willing to negotiate on your behalf, help draft letters, and perform other necessary 
tasks on an hourly basis without filing a lawsuit. Your state department of 
insurance; the local bar association; or other legal, accounting, or financial prac￾titioners also may be able to refer you to someone.
In situations like this, if you do your homework and you’re not making progress with the 
insurer’s adjuster, ask to speak with supervisors and managers. If you’re having prob￾lems getting a fair and timely settlement from the insurer, try contacting your state’s 
department of insurance. This person who wrote me was from Louisiana, where the 
state department of insurance had more than 1,600 hurricane-related complaints in the 
first three months after Hurricane Katrina. To my surprise, the department’s director of 
public information told me that no insurance companies had been fined and penalized 
for delaying payments. It’s no wonder these companies weren’t getting on the stick!CHAPTER 17 Insurance on You: Life, Disability, and Health 337
Chapter 17
Insurance on You: Life, 
Disability, and Health
During your working years, multiplying your typical annual income by the 
number of years you plan to continue working produces a pretty big num￾ber. That dollar amount equals what is probably your most valuable 
asset — your ability to earn an income. You need to protect this asset by purchas￾ing some insurance on you.
This chapter explains the ins and outs of buying insurance to protect your income: 
life insurance in case of death, and disability insurance in case of an accident or 
severe medical condition that prevents you from working. I tell you what coverage 
you should have, where to look for it, and what to avoid.
In addition to protecting your income, you also should insure against financially 
catastrophic expenses. I’m not talking about January’s credit-card bill — you’re 
on your own with that one. I’m talking about the type of bills that are racked up 
from a major surgery and a lengthy stay in the hospital. To protect yourself from 
potentially astronomical medical bills, secure comprehensive health insurance.

Providing for Your Loved Ones: 
Life Insurance
You generally need life insurance only when other people depend on your income. 
The following folks don’t need life insurance to protect their incomes:
» Single people with no children
» Working couples who can maintain a lifestyle acceptable to them on one of 
their incomes
» Independently wealthy people who don’t need to work
» Retired people who are living off their retirement nest egg
» Minor children (are you financially dependent upon your children?)
If others are either fully or partly dependent on your paycheck (usually a spouse 
and/or child), you need life insurance, especially if you have major financial com￾mitments such as a mortgage or years of child-rearing ahead. You may also want 
to consider life insurance if an extended family member is currently or likely to be 
dependent on your future income.
Determining how much life 
insurance to buy
Determining how much life insurance to buy is as much a subjective decision as it 
is a quantitative decision. I’ve seen some worksheets that are incredibly long and 
tedious (some rivaling your tax returns). There’s no need to get fancy. If you’re 
like me, your eyes start to glaze over if you have to complete 20-plus lines of cal￾culations. Figuring out how much life insurance you need doesn’t have to be that 
complicated.
The main purpose of life insurance is to provide a lump sum payment to replace 
the deceased person’s income. Ask yourself how many years of income you want 
to replace. Table 17-1 provides a simple way to figure how much life insurance to 
consider purchasing. To replace a certain number of years’ worth of income, sim￾ply multiply the appropriate number in the table by your annual after-tax income.
Another way to determine the amount of life insurance to buy is to think about 
how much would be needed to pay for major debts or expenditures, such as your 
mortgage, other loans, and college for your children. For example, suppose you CHAPTER 17 Insurance on You: Life, Disability, and Health 339
want your spouse to have enough of a life insurance death benefit to pay off your 
mortgage and half of your children’s college education. Simply add your mortgage 
amount to half of your children’s estimated college costs (see Chapter  14 for 
approximate numbers) and then buy that amount of life insurance.
Social Security, if you’re covered, can provide survivors benefits to your spouse 
and children. However, depending upon your income, you may owe federal income 
tax on 50 to 85 percent of your benefits. Single taxpayers may earn up to $25,000 
annually without being taxed on these benefits. If your earnings are between 
$25,000 and $34,000, 50 percent of the survivors benefit is taxable. If you earn 
above $34,000, 85 percent is taxable. For taxpayers filing their taxes jointly, you 
may have income up to $32,000 for tax-exempt status on survivor’s benefits. For 
incomes between $32,000 and $44,000, 50 percent is taxable, and 85 percent is 
taxable for incomes above $44,000.
You may want to factor your Social Security survivors benefits into how much life 
insurance to buy, but be sure to consider the taxes you may owe on them. Contact 
the Social Security Administration by phone at 800-772-1213 or visit its website at 
www.ssa.gov to estimate your benefits.
The Social Security Administration can tell you how much your survivors would 
receive per month in the event of your death. You should factor this benefit into 
the amount of life insurance that you calculate in Table 17-1. For example, sup￾pose your annual after-tax income is $25,000 and Social Security provides a sur￾vivors benefit of $10,000 annually. Therefore, for the purposes of Table 17-1, you 
should determine the amount of life insurance needed to replace $15,000 annually 
($25,000 – $10,000), not $25,000.

Comparing term life insurance to 
cash value life insurance
I’m going to tell you how you can save hours of time and thousands of dollars. 
Ready? Buy term life insurance. If you’ve already figured out how much life insur￾ance to purchase and this is all the advice you need, you can jump to the “Buying 
term insurance” section that follows.
If you want the details behind my recommendation for term insurance, the fol￾lowing information is for you. Or maybe you’ve heard (and have already fallen 
prey to) the sales pitches from life insurance agents, most of whom love selling 
cash value life insurance because of its bigger commissions.
EXAMINING “OTHER” LIFE INSURANCE
Contemplating the possibility of your untimely demise is surely depressing. You’ll likely 
feel some peace of mind when purchasing a life insurance policy to provide for your 
dependents. However, I suggest you take things a step further. Suppose you (or your 
spouse) pass away. Do you think that simply buying a life insurance policy will be 
sufficient “help” for the loved ones you leave behind? Surely your contribution to 
your household involves far more than being a breadwinner.
Do you have a will? See Chapter 18 for more details on wills and other estate-planning 
documents. Make sure all your important financial documents — investment account 
statements, insurance policies, employee benefits materials, small-business accounting 
records, and so on — are kept in one place (such as a file drawer) that your loved ones 
know about. You may also want to consider providing a list of key contacts — such as 
who you recommend calling (or what you recommend reading) in the event of legal, 
financial, or tax quandaries.
So, in addition to trying to provide financially for your dependents, you should also take 
some time to reflect on what else you can do to help point them in the right direction on 
matters you normally handle. With most couples, it’s natural for one spouse to take 
more responsibility for money management. That’s fine; just make sure to talk about 
what’s being done so that in the event that the responsible spouse dies, the surviving 
person knows how to jump into the driver’s seat.
If you have kids (and even if you don’t), you may want to give some thought to 
sentimental leave-behinds for your loved ones. These leave-behinds can be some￾thing like a short note telling them how much they meant to you and what you’d 
like them to remember about you.CHAPTER 17 Insurance on You: Life, Disability, and Health 341
Despite the variety of names that life insurance marketing departments have 
cooked up for policies, life insurance comes in two basic flavors:
» Term insurance: This insurance is pure life insurance. You pay an annual 
premium for which you receive a particular amount of life insurance coverage. 
If you, the insured person, pass away, your beneficiaries collect; otherwise, the 
premium is gone, but you’re grateful to be alive!
» Cash value insurance: All other life insurance policies (whole, universal, 
variable, and so on) combine life insurance with a supposed savings feature. 
Not only do your premiums pay for life insurance, but some of your dollars 
are also credited to an account that grows in value over time, assuming you 
keep paying your premiums. On the surface, this type of insurance sounds 
potentially attractive. People don’t like to feel that their premium dollars are 
getting tossed away.
But cash value insurance has a big catch. For the same amount of coverage 
(for example, for $100,000 of life insurance benefits), cash value policies cost 
you about eight times (800 percent) more than comparable term policies.
Insurance salespeople know the buttons to push to interest you in buying the 
wrong kind of life insurance. In the following sections, I give you some of the typ￾ical arguments they make for purchasing cash value polices, followed by my per￾spective on each one.
“Cash value policies are all paid up after X years. 
You don’t want to be paying life insurance 
premiums for the rest of your life, do you?”
Agents who pitch cash value life insurance present projections that imply that 
after the first ten or so years of paying your premiums, you don’t need to pay 
more premiums to keep the life insurance in force. The only reason you may be 
able to stop paying premiums is because you poured a lot of extra money into the 
policy in the early years. Remember that cash value life insurance costs about 
eight times as much as term insurance.
Imagine that you’re currently paying $500 a year for auto insurance and that an 
insurance company comes along and offers you a policy for $4,000 per year. The 
representative tells you that after ten years, you can stop paying and still keep 
your same coverage. I’m sure you wouldn’t fall for this sales tactic, but many 
people do when they buy cash value life insurance.
You also need to be wary of the projections because they often include unrealistic 
and lofty assumptions about the investment return that your cash balance can 
earn. When you stop paying into a cash value policy, the cost of each year’s life 342 PART 4 Insurance: Protecting What You Have
insurance is deducted from the remaining cash value. If the rate of return on the 
cash balance is not sufficient to pay the insurance cost, the cash balance declines, 
and eventually you receive notices saying that your policy needs more funding to 
keep the life insurance in force.
“You won’t be able to afford term 
insurance when you’re older.”
As you get older, the cost of term insurance increases because the risk of dying 
rises. But life insurance is not something you need all your life! It’s typically 
bought in a person’s younger years when financial commitments and obligations 
outweigh financial assets. Twenty or thirty years later, the reverse should be 
true — if you use the principles in this book!
When you retire, you don’t need life insurance to protect your employment 
income, because there isn’t any to protect! You may need life insurance when 
you’re raising a family and/or you have a substantial mortgage to pay off, but by 
the time you retire, the kids should be out on their own (you hope!), and the mort￾gage should be paid down.
In the meantime, term insurance saves you a tremendous amount of money. For 
most people, it takes 20 to 30 years for the premium they’re paying on a term 
insurance policy to finally catch up to (equal) the premium they’ve been paying all 
along on a comparable amount of cash value life insurance.
“You can borrow against the cash 
value at a low interest rate.”
Such a deal! It’s your money in the policy, remember? If you deposited money in a 
savings or money-market account, how would you like to pay for the privilege of 
borrowing your own money back? Borrowing on your cash value policy is poten￾tially dangerous: You increase the chances that the policy will lapse — leaving you 
with nothing to show for your premiums.
“Your cash value grows tax-deferred.”
Ah, a glimmer of truth at last. The cash value portion of your policy grows without 
taxation until you withdraw it, but if you want tax-deferral of your investment 
balances, you should first take advantage of funding 401(k)s, 403(b)s, SEP-IRAs, 
and other tax-advantaged retirement accounts. Such accounts give you an imme￾diate tax deduction for your current contributions in addition to growth without 
taxation until withdrawal.CHAPTER 17 Insurance on You: Life, Disability, and Health 343
The money you pay into a cash value life policy gives you no up-front tax deduc￾tions. If you exhaust the tax-deductible plans, consider Roth accounts and then 
variable annuities, which provide access to better investment options and tax￾deferred compounding of your investment dollars. Roth accounts have the added 
bonus of tax-free withdrawal of your investment earnings. (See Chapter 12 for 
details on retirement accounts.)
Life insurance tends to be a mediocre investment at best. The insurance company 
generally quotes you an interest rate for the first year; after that, the company 
changes the rate annually. If you don’t like the future interest rates, you can be 
penalized for quitting the policy. Would you ever invest your money in a bank 
account that quoted an interest rate for the first year and then penalized you for 
moving your money within the next seven to ten years?
“Cash value policies are forced savings.”
Many agents argue that a cash value plan is better than nothing — at least it’s 
forcing you to save. This line of thinking is silly because so many people drop cash 
value life insurance policies after just a few years of paying into them. You can 
accomplish “forced savings” without using life insurance. Any of the retirement 
savings accounts mentioned in Chapter 12 can be set up with automatic monthly 
transfers. Employers offering such a plan can deduct contributions from your 
paycheck — and they don’t take a commission! You can also set up monthly elec￾tronic transfers from your bank account to contribute to mutual funds (see 
Chapter 11).
“Life insurance is not part of your taxable estate.”
If the ownership of a life insurance policy is properly structured, the death benefit 
is free of estate taxes. This part of the sales pitch is about the only sound reason￾ing that exists for buying cash value life insurance. Under current federal laws, 
you can pass on $12.92 million ($25.84 million for a married couple) free of fed￾eral estate taxes. But even if you have that large of a nest egg, you have numerous 
other ways to reduce your taxable estate (see Chapter 18).
Making your decision
Insurance salespeople aggressively push cash value policies because of the high 
commissions that insurance companies pay them. Commissions on cash value life 
insurance range from 50 to 100 percent of your first year’s premium. Insurance 
salespeople, therefore, can make eight to ten times more money (yes, you read that 
right) selling you a cash value policy than they can selling you term insurance.344 PART 4 Insurance: Protecting What You Have
Ultimately, when you purchase cash value life insurance, you pay the high com￾missions that are built into these policies. As you can see in the policy’s cash value 
table, you don’t get back any of the money that you dump into the policy if you 
quit the policy in the first few years. The insurance company can’t afford to give 
you any of your money back in those early years because so much of it has been 
paid to the selling agent as commission. That’s why these policies explicitly 
penalize you for withdrawing your cash balance within the first seven to ten years.
Because of the high cost of cash value policies relative to the cost of term, you’re 
more likely to buy less life insurance coverage than you need — that’s the sad part 
of the insurance industry’s pushing of this stuff. The vast majority of life insurance 
buyers need more protection than they can afford to buy with cash value coverage.
Cash value life insurance is the most oversold insurance and financial product in 
the history of the financial services industry. Cash value life insurance makes 
sense for a small number of people, such as business owners who own a business 
worth at least 10+ million dollars and don’t want their heirs to be forced to sell 
their business to pay estate taxes in the event of their death. (See “Considering the 
purchase of cash value life insurance” later in this chapter.)
Purchase low-cost term insurance and do your investing separately. Life insur￾ance is rarely a permanent need; over time, you can reduce the amount of term 
insurance you carry as your financial obligations lessen and you accumulate more 
assets.
Buying term insurance
Term insurance policies have several features from which to choose. I cover the 
important elements of term insurance in this section so you can make an informed 
decision about purchasing it.
Selecting how often your premium adjusts
Term insurance can be purchased so your premium adjusts (increases) annually 
or after 5, 10, 15, or 20 years. The less frequently your premium adjusts, the higher 
the initial premium and its incremental increases will be. (Remember, as you get 
older, the risk of dying increases, so the cost of your insurance goes up.)
The advantage of a premium that locks in for, say, ten years is that you have the 
security of knowing how much you’ll be paying annually for the next ten years. 
You also don’t need to go through medical evaluations as frequently to qualify for 
the lowest rate possible. The disadvantage of a policy with a long-term rate lock 
is that you pay more in the early years than you do on a policy that adjusts more 
frequently. In addition, you may want to change the amount of insurance you CHAPTER 17 Insurance on You: Life, Disability, and Health 345
carry as your circumstances change. Thus, you may throw money away when you 
dump a policy with a long-term premium guarantee before its rate is set to 
change.
Policies that adjust the premium every five to ten years offer a happy medium 
between price and predictability.
Ensuring guaranteed renewability
Guaranteed renewability, which is standard practice on the better policies, assures 
that the policy can’t be canceled because of poor health. Don’t buy a life insurance 
policy without this feature unless you expect that your life insurance needs will 
disappear when the policy is up for renewal.
Deciding where to buy term insurance
A number of sound ways to obtain high-quality, low-cost term insurance are 
available. You may choose to buy through a local agent because you know them or 
prefer to buy from someone close to home. However, you should invest a few min￾utes of your time getting quotes from one or two of the following sources to get a 
sense of what’s available in the insurance market. Gaining familiarity with the 
market can prevent an agent from selling you an overpriced, high-commission 
policy.
Here are some sources for high-quality, low-cost term insurance:

whether you smoke, some basic health questions, and how much coverage 
you want. Services that are worth considering include

Considering the purchase of 
cash value life insurance
Don’t expect to get objective information from the typical salesperson who sells 
cash value life insurance. Beware of insurance salespeople masquerading under 
the guise of self-anointed titles, such as estate-planning specialists or financial 
planners.
As I discuss earlier in the chapter, purchasing cash value life insurance may make 
sense to consider if you expect to have an estate-tax “problem.” However, cash 
value life insurance is just one of many ways to reduce your estate taxes (see the 
section on estate planning in Chapter 18).
Among the best places to shop for cash value life insurance policies are
» USAA: Phone 800-531-8722; website www.usaa.com/inet/wc/
insurance_life_permanent
» Ameritas Direct: Phone 800-555-4655; website www.ameritasdirect.com
If you want to obtain some cash value life insurance, tread carefully with local 
insurance agents. Most agents aren’t as interested in educating as they are in sell￾ing. Besides, the best cash value policies can be obtained commission-free when 
you buy them from the sources in the preceding list. The money saved on com￾missions (which can easily be thousands of dollars) is reflected in a much higher 
cash value for you.
Getting rid of cash value life insurance
If you were snookered into buying a cash value life insurance policy and you want 
to part ways with it, go ahead and do so. But don’t cancel the coverage until you first 
secure new term coverage. When you need life insurance, you don’t want to have a 
period when you’re not covered (Murphy’s Law says that’s when disaster will 
strike).
Ending a cash value life insurance policy has tax consequences. You generally 
must pay federal income tax on the amount you receive in excess of the premiums 
you paid over the life of the policy. Because some life insurance policies feature 
tax-deferred retirement savings, you may incur a 10-percent federal income tax 
penalty on earnings withdrawn before age 59½, just as you would with an 
IRA. Before withdrawing the cash balance in your life insurance policy, consider 
checking with the insurer or a tax advisor to clarify what the tax consequences 
may be.CHAPTER 17 Insurance on You: Life, Disability, and Health 347
You can avoid federal income tax early withdrawal penalties and sidestep taxation 
on accumulated interest in a life insurance policy by doing a tax-free exchange 
(also known as a section 1035 exchange) into a no-load (commission-free) vari￾able annuity. The no-load mutual-fund company through which you buy the 
annuity takes care of transferring your existing balance. (See Chapter 10 for more 
information about variable annuities.)
Preparing for the Unpredictable: 
Disability Insurance
As with life insurance, the purpose of disability insurance is to protect your 
employment income. The only difference is that with disability insurance, you’re 
protecting the income for yourself (and perhaps also your dependents). If you’re 
completely disabled, you still have living expenses, but you probably can’t earn 
employment income.
I’m referring to long-term disabilities. If you strain your back while reliving your 
athletic glory days and you wind up in bed for several days, it likely won’t be a 
financial disaster. But what if you were disabled in such a way that you couldn’t 
work for several years? This section helps you figure out whether you need dis￾ability insurance, how much to get, and where to find it.
Deciding whether you need coverage
Most large employers offer disability insurance to their employees. Many small￾company employees and all self-employed people are left to fend for themselves 
without disability coverage. Being without disability insurance is a risky proposi￾tion, especially if, like most working people, you need your employment income 
to live on.
If you’re married and your spouse earns a large enough income that you can make 
do without yours, consider skipping disability coverage. The same is true if you’ve 
already accumulated enough money for your future years (in other words, you’re 
financially independent). Keep in mind, though, that your expenses may go up if 
you become disabled and require specialized care.
For most people, dismissing the need for disability coverage is easy. The odds of 
suffering a long-term disability seem so remote — and they are. But if you suffer 
bad luck, disability coverage can relieve you (and possibly your family) of a major 
financial burden.348 PART 4 Insurance: Protecting What You Have
Most disabilities are caused by medical problems, such as arthritis, heart condi￾tions, hypertension, and back/spine or hip/leg impairments. Some of these ail￾ments occur with advancing age, but more than one-third of all disabilities are 
suffered by people under the age of 45. The vast majority of these medical prob￾lems cannot be predicted in advance, particularly those caused by random 
accidents.
If you think you have good disability coverage through government programs, 
you’d better think again:
» Social Security disability: Social Security pays long-term benefits only if 
you’re not able to perform any substantial, gainful activity for more than a 
year or if your disability is expected to result in death. Furthermore, Social 
Security disability payments are quite low because they’re intended to provide 
only for basic, subsistence-level living expenses.
» Workers’ compensation: Workers’ compensation (if you have such coverage 
through your employer) pays you benefits if you’re injured on the job, but it 
doesn’t pay any benefits if you get disabled away from your job. You need 
coverage that pays regardless of where and how you’re disabled.
» State disability programs: Some states have disability insurance programs, 
but the coverage is typically bare bones. State programs are also generally 
not a good value because of the cost for the small amount of coverage 
they provide. Benefits are paid over a short period of time (typically only 
up to a year).
Determining how much disability 
insurance you need
You need enough disability coverage to provide you with sufficient income to live 
on until other financial resources become available. If you don’t have much saved 
in the way of financial assets and you want to continue with the lifestyle sup￾ported by your current income if you suffer a disability, get disability coverage to 
replace your entire monthly take-home (after-tax) pay.
The benefits you purchase on a disability policy are quoted as the dollars per month 
you receive if disabled. So, if your job provides you with a $3,000-per-month 
income after taxes, seek a policy that provides a $3,000-per-month benefit.
If you pay for your disability insurance, the benefits are tax-free (but hopefully 
you won’t ever have to collect them). If your employer picks up the tab, your ben￾efits are taxable, so you need a larger benefit amount.CHAPTER 17 Insurance on You: Life, Disability, and Health 349
In addition to the monthly coverage amount, you also need to select the duration 
for which you want a policy to pay you benefits. You need a policy that pays bene￾fits until you reach an age at which you become financially self-sufficient. For 
most people, that’s around age 65 to 67, when their Social Security benefits kick 
in. If you anticipate needing your employment income past your mid-60s, you 
may want to obtain disability coverage that pays you until a later age.
If you crunch some numbers (see Chapter 4) and find that you’re within five to ten 
years of being financially independent or able to retire, five-year and ten-year 
disability policies are available. You may also consider such short-term policies 
when you’re sure that someone (for example, a family member) can support you 
financially over the long term.
Identifying other features you 
need in disability insurance
Disability insurance policies have many confusing features. Here’s what to look 
for — and look out for — when purchasing disability insurance:
» Definition of disability: An own-occupation disability policy provides benefit 
payments if you can’t perform the work you normally do. Some policies pay 
you only if you’re unable to perform a job for which you are reasonably trained.
Other policies revert to this definition after a few years of being own-occupation. 
Own-occupation policies are the most expensive because there’s a greater chance 
that the insurer will have to pay you. The extra cost may not be worth it unless 
you’re in a high-income or specialized occupation and you’d have to take a 
significant pay cut to do something else (and you wouldn’t be happy about a 
reduced income and the required lifestyle changes).
» Noncancelable and guaranteed renewable: These features ensure that 
your policy can’t be canceled because of your falling into poor health. With 
policies that require periodic physical exams, you can lose your coverage just 
when you’re most likely to need it.
» Waiting period: This is the “deductible” on disability insurance — the time 
between the onset of your disability and the time you begin collecting 
benefits. As with other types of insurance, you should take the highest 
deductible (longest waiting period) that your financial circumstances allow. 
Longer waiting periods significantly reduce the cost of the insurance and 
eliminate the hassle of filing a claim for a short-term disability. The minimum 
waiting period on most policies is 30 days. The maximum waiting period can 
be up to one to two years. Try a waiting period of three to six months if you 
have sufficient emergency reserves.350 PART 4 Insurance: Protecting What You Have
» Residual benefits: This option pays you a partial benefit if you have a 
disability that prevents you from working full-time.
» Cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs): This feature automatically increases 
your benefit payment by a set percentage annually or in accordance with 
changes in inflation. The advantage of a COLA is that it retains the purchasing 
power of your benefits. A modest COLA, such as 3 to 4 percent, is worth 
considering.
» Future insurability: A clause that many agents encourage you to buy, future 
insurability allows you to buy additional coverage regardless of health. For 
most people, paying for the privilege of buying more coverage later is not 
worth it if the income you earn today fairly reflects your likely long-term 
earnings and spending desires. You may benefit from the future insurability 
option if your income is artificially low now and you’re confident that it will rise 
significantly in the future. (For example, you just got out of medical school and 
you’re earning a low salary while being a resident.)
» Insurer’s financial stability: As I discuss in Chapter 16, you should choose 
insurers that’ll be here tomorrow to pay your claim. That said, don’t obsess 
over the stability of the company; benefits are paid even if the insurer fails, 
because the state or another insurer will almost always bail out the unstable 
insurer.
Deciding where to buy disability insurance
The place to buy disability insurance with the best value is through your employer 
or professional association. Unless these groups have done a lousy job shopping 
for coverage, group plans generally offer a better value than disability insurance 
you can purchase on your own. Just make sure that the group plan meets the 
specifications discussed in the preceding section, especially any limitations of 
benefit amounts or stricter qualification terms, which are found on some group 
plans.
Don’t trust an insurance agent to be enthusiastic about the quality of a disability 
policy your employer or other group is offering. Agents have a conflict of interest 
when they criticize these options, because they won’t make a commission if you 
buy through a group.
If you don’t have access to a group policy, check with your agent or a company you 
already do business with. But tread carefully when purchasing disability insurance 
through an agent. Some agents try to add all sorts of extra bells and whistles to 
policies to pump up the premium along with their commission.CHAPTER 17 Insurance on You: Life, Disability, and Health 351
Getting the Care You Need: 
Health Insurance
Almost everyone needs health insurance, but not everyone has it. Some people in 
the past were denied coverage or couldn’t afford the coverage they were offered. 
Other people who could afford health insurance chose not to buy it because they 
believed that they were healthy and weren’t going to need it. Others who opted not 
to buy health insurance figured that if they ever really needed healthcare, they’d 
be able to get needed care. To a large extent, they’re right. But, people without 
health insurance generally put off getting routine care, which can lead to small 
problems turning into bigger and costlier ones.
Mandating health insurance: The 
Affordable Care Act (Obamacare)
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education 
Reconciliation Act enacted comprehensive healthcare reform in the United States.
Now, employer group health plans are subject to these rules:
» Plans offering dependent coverage must offer coverage to adult children up 
to age 26. The coverage isn’t taxable to the employee or dependent.
» Plans must provide preventive care without cost-sharing and must cover 
certain child preventive care services as recommended by the government. 
This rule applies only to new group health plans.
» Employers must offer minimum essential coverage to full-time employees or 
make nondeductible payments to the government.
» Plans must remove all annual dollar limits on participants’ benefit payments. 
They may not impose lifetime limits.
» Plans must limit cost-sharing and deductibles to levels that don’t exceed those 
applicable to a health-savings-account-eligible, high-deductible health plan.
» Plans must remove all preexisting condition exclusions on all participants.
» Plans may not have waiting periods of longer than 90 days.
Higher-income taxpayers are now hit with higher tax rates on their investments 
as well as higher Medicare tax rates to help pay for Obamacare. Taxpayers with 
total taxable income above $200,000 (for a single return) or $250,000 (for a joint 352 PART 4 Insurance: Protecting What You Have
return) from any source are subject to a 3.8 percent tax on the lesser of the 
following:
» Their net investment income (for example, interest, dividends, and capital 
gains)
» The amount, if any, by which their modified adjusted gross income exceeds 
the dollar thresholds
OPTING OUT OF OBAMACARE?
Soon after Obamacare began to be implemented, millions of folks (me included) who 
had individual health insurance policies had their policies canceled, regardless of 
whether they wanted to keep them, because the policies didn’t meet the new guide￾lines. To add insult to injury, many folks found that the “replacement” policies they were 
forced to buy to comply with the Affordable Care Act were much more expensive 
because of the mandated benefits and the cost of including people with preexisting 
health problems in the costs for coverage.
Some were and are tempted not to replace their lost coverage. Others who had previ￾ously chosen to go without coverage were in no great hurry to buy the higher-cost plans 
now available. However, people without health insurance faced penalties when it came 
time to file their taxes. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act repealed the tax penalties effective 
2019 for those who don’t get health insurance.
You can purchase subsidized health insurance (barring special circumstances, such as 
the birth of a baby) only during the open enrollment period — between November 1st 
and January 15th. If you miss that window and get diagnosed with a serious illness, say, 
in July, you have to wait many months to buy coverage on the government exchanges. 
(You can purchase a policy outside the exchange, but banking on the ability to get 
insured quickly enough is risky. A major car accident or illness can happen too quickly 
to allow you to buy a policy. The medical bills you’d rack up almost overnight can be 
devastating.)
There is an exception for a so-called special enrollment period, which the federal 
government defines as
“A time outside of the open enrollment period during which you and your family 
have a right to sign up for health coverage. In the marketplace, you qualify for a 
special enrollment period 60 days following certain life events that involve a change 
in family status (for example, marriage or birth of a child) or loss of other health 
coverage. Job-based plans must provide a special enrollment period of 30 days.”CHAPTER 17 Insurance on You: Life, Disability, and Health 353
Taxpayers with earned income above $200,000 (for a single return) or $250,000 
(for a joint return) are subject to an additional 0.9 percent Medicare tax (in other 
words, rising from 1.45 percent to 2.35 percent) on wages in excess of those 
amounts. Employers aren’t required to match the payment of this incremental 
increase, which is applicable only to the employee.
Choosing the best health plan
Before Medicare (the government-run insurance program for the elderly) kicks in 
at age 65+, odds are that you’ll obtain your health insurance through your 
employer. Be thankful if you do. Employer-provided coverage eliminates the 
headache of having to shop for coverage, and it’s usually cheaper than coverage 
you buy on your own.
Whether you have options through your employer or you have to hunt for a plan 
on your own, the following sections cover the major issues to consider when 
selecting among the health insurance offerings in the marketplace.
Major medical coverage
You need a plan that covers the big potential expenses: hospitalization, physician, 
and ancillary charges, such as X-rays and laboratory work. If you’re a woman and 
you think that you may want to have children, make sure your plan has maternity 
benefits.
Choice of healthcare providers
Plans that allow you to use any healthcare provider you want are becoming less 
common and more expensive in most areas. Health maintenance organizations 
(HMOs) and preferred provider organizations (PPOs) are the main plans that 
restrict your choices. They keep costs down because they negotiate lower rates 
with selected providers.
HMOs and PPOs are more similar than they are different. The main difference is 
that PPOs still pay the majority of your expenses if you use a provider outside their 
approved list. If you use a provider outside the approved list with an HMO, you 
typically aren’t covered at all.
If you have your heart set on particular physicians or hospitals, find out which 
health insurance plans they accept as payment. Ask yourself whether the extra 
cost of an open-choice plan is worth being able to use their services if they’re not 
part of a restricted-choice plan. Also be aware that some plans allow you to go 
outside their network of providers as long as you pay a bigger portion of the 
incurred medical costs. If you’re interested in being able to use alternative types 354 PART 4 Insurance: Protecting What You Have
of providers, such as acupuncturists, find out whether the plans you’re consider￾ing cover these services.
Don’t let stories of how hard it is to get an appointment with a doctor or other 
logistical hassles deter you from going with an HMO or PPO plan. These things can 
happen in plans with open choice, too. The idea that doctors who can’t get patients 
on their own are the only ones who sign up with restricted-choice plans is a myth. 
Although HMO and PPO plans do offer fewer choices when it comes to providers, 
surveys show that customer satisfaction with these plans is as high as it is for 
plans that offer more choices.
Lifetime maximum benefits
Health insurance plans specify the maximum total benefits they’ll pay over the 
course of time you’re insured by their plan. Although a million dollars may be 
more money than you could ever imagine being spent on your healthcare, it’s the 
minimum acceptable level of total benefits. With the cost of healthcare today, you 
can quickly blow through that if you develop major health problems. The Afford￾able Care Act has generally required health plans to do away with lifetime maxi￾mums. If you’re shopping for a noncompliant plan, ideally choose a plan that has 
no maximum or that has a maximum of at least $5 million.
Deductibles and co-payments
To reduce your health insurance premiums, choose a plan with the highest 
deductible and co-payment you can afford. As with other insurance policies, the 
more you’re willing to share in the payment of your claims, the less you have to 
pay in premiums. Most policies have annual deductible options (such as $250, 
$500, $1,000, and so on) as well as co-payment options, which are typically 
20 percent or so.
When choosing a co-payment percentage, don’t let your imagination run wild and 
unnecessarily scare you. A 20-percent co-payment doesn’t mean that you have to 
come up with $20,000 for a $100,000 claim. Insurance plans generally set a maxi￾mum out-of-pocket limit on your annual co-payments (such as $1,000, $2,000, 
and so on); the insurer covers 100 percent of any medical expenses that go over 
that cap.
For insurance provided by your employer, consider plans with low out-of-pocket 
expenses if you know you have health problems. Because you’re part of a group, 
the insurer won’t increase your individual rates just because you’re filing more 
claims.
Most HMO plans don’t have deductible and co-payment options. Most just charge 
a set amount — such as $25 — for a physician’s office visit.CHAPTER 17 Insurance on You: Life, Disability, and Health 355
Guaranteed renewability
The Affordable Care Act generally requires health insurers to continue your plan 
coverage regardless of any changes in your health. You want a health insurance 
plan that keeps renewing your coverage without you having to prove continued 
SAVING ON TAXES WHEN SPENDING 
ON HEALTHCARE
If you expect to have out-of-pocket medical expenses, find out whether your employer 
offers a flexible spending or healthcare reimbursement account. These accounts enable 
you to pay for uncovered medical expenses with pre-tax dollars. If, for example, you’re 
in a combined 30-percent federal and state income tax bracket, these accounts allow 
you to pay for necessary healthcare at a 30-percent discount. These accounts can also 
be used to pay for vision and dental care.
Be forewarned of the major stumbling blocks you face when saving through medical 
reimbursement accounts. First, you need to elect to save money from your paycheck 
prior to the beginning of each plan year. The only exception is at the time of a “life 
change,” such as marriage, spouse’s job change, divorce, a family member’s death, or 
the birth of a child. You also generally need to use the money within the year you save 
it, because these accounts contain a “use it or lose it” feature. (Some employer plans 
now allow a $500 carryover; check your plan’s details.)
Health savings accounts (HSAs) are another option, especially for the self-employed and 
people who work for smaller firms. To qualify, you must have a high-deductible (at least 
$1,500 for individuals; $3,000 for families) health insurance policy; then you can put 
money earmarked for medical expenses into an investment account that offers the tax 
benefits — deductible contributions (up to $3,850 for single taxpayers and $7,750 for 
families) and tax-deferred compounding — of a retirement account (see Chapter 4). And 
unlike a flexible spending account, you don’t have to deplete the HSA by the end of the 
year: Money can compound tax-deferred inside the HSA for years. Begin to investigate 
an HSA through insurers offering health plans you’re interested in or with the company 
you currently have coverage through (also see my website, www.erictyson.com, for 
the latest information on the best HSA plans).
You may also be able to save on taxes if you have a substantial amount of healthcare 
expenditures in a year. You can deduct medical and dental expenses as an itemized 
deduction on Schedule A to the extent that they exceed 7.5 percent of your adjusted 
gross income. Unless you’re a low-income earner, you need to have substantial 
expenses, usually caused by an accident or major illness, to take advantage of this 
tax break (see Chapter 8).356 PART 4 Insurance: Protecting What You Have
good health. If good health could be guaranteed, you wouldn’t need health insur￾ance in the first place.
Buying health insurance
Due to the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), the way Americans buy and pay for 
health insurance is going through some upheaval. In addition to traditional insur￾ance agents, numerous states operate health insurance exchanges that offer 
health plans that comply with the Affordable Care Act. To see if your state offers a 
health insurance exchange, visit www.healthcare.gov/marketplace-in-your￾state/. If you live in a state without its own exchange, you can enroll in one at 
www.healthcare.gov.
You can buy many health plans through agents, and you can also buy some directly 
from the insurer. When health insurance is sold both ways, buying through an 
agent usually doesn’t cost more.
If you’re self-employed or you work for a small employer that doesn’t offer health 
insurance as a benefit, get proposals from the larger and older health insurers in 
your area. Larger plans can negotiate better rates from providers, and older plans 
are more likely to be here tomorrow.
Many insurers operate in a bunch of different insurance businesses. You 
want those that are the biggest in the health insurance arena and are committed 
to that business. Nationally, Blue Cross, Blue Shield, Kaiser Permanente, Aetna, 
UnitedHealth, CIGNA, Assurant, and Anthem are among the older and bigger 
health insurers.
Also check with professional or other associations that you belong to, because 
plans offered by these groups sometimes offer decent benefits at a competitive 
price due to the purchasing power clout that they possess. A competent indepen￾dent insurance agent who specializes in health insurance can help you find insur￾ers who are willing to offer you coverage.
Health insurance agents have a conflict of interest that’s common to all financial 
salespeople working on commission: The higher the premium plan they sell you, 
the bigger the commission they earn. So an agent may try to steer you into higher￾cost plans and avoid suggesting some of the strategies I discuss in the preceding 
section for reducing your cost of coverage. (Good agents can help guide you to the 
best plans that cover preexisting conditions and offer the lowest costs for your 
medications. Be sure to provide them with this information and compare options 
carefully.)CHAPTER 17 Insurance on You: Life, Disability, and Health 357
Clarifying why prices rose because 
of the Affordable Care Act
When millions of health insurance policyholders got their plans canceled after 
2010 when the Affordable Care Act (ACA) was implemented, many of them faced 
big rate hikes when shopping for a replacement policy. That happened because of 
the essential health benefits that, by law, must be included in new insurance poli￾cies. These benefits include maternity and newborn care, mental health and sub￾stance use disorder services, prescription drugs, and pediatric services (including 
dental and vision care), to give a partial list. In the past, you were able to pick and 
choose from plans that excluded some of these services and thus were less 
expensive.
Plus, the ACA includes “consumer protection” provisions that have elevated 
prices. For example, it prohibits health insurance companies from limiting or 
excluding coverage related to preexisting health conditions. In order to absorb 
this cost and costs related to other provisions, insurance companies have raised 
rates substantially.
Understanding subsidies
Though the bad news is that many people faced much higher priced policies due 
to the ACA, the good news is that some of those folks may qualify for government 
subsidies that help reduce the effective price of said policies. (Of course, this 
money doesn’t come out of thin air; it comes from the federal government and 
therefore taxpayers.)
Qualifying for a subsidy depends on your family income and how many children 
you have. Subsidies are available to qualified individuals and families whose 
incomes fall in the range of 100 percent to 400 percent of the poverty line (assum￾ing they buy a policy on a government exchange). At the top of the spectrum for 
2023, an individual making just under $54,360 would be eligible for a subsidy, as 
would a family of four earning less than $111,000. To be eligible for a subsidy, you 
may not have access to affordable health insurance coverage through an employer 
(including a family member’s employer) and not be eligible for coverage through 
Medicare, Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), or other 
forms of public assistance. The income thresholds vary based upon zip code — 
check out the handy subsidy calculator at www.kff.org/interactive/subsidy￾calculator/.
If you’re self-employed and end up receiving subsidies, be careful to keep track of 
your earnings. If you end up making more than you thought you would in a given 
year, you can end up having to pay back part of your subsidy. Of course, the reverse 
is also true: If you make less than expected, you may receive a refund.358 PART 4 Insurance: Protecting What You Have
Coping with higher health insurance prices
In recent decades, health insurance prices have consistently increased faster than 
the overall rate of inflation. Since its passage, things have worsened with the 
implementation of the Affordable Care Act. Here are a few tips for health insur￾ance shoppers to make the most of their spending:
» Be patient, shop around, and do your homework. Talk to insurers and 
agents. Spend some time on the computer; the ACA marketplace website 
is www.healthcare.gov. Ask friends and colleagues what they’re doing. 
Although you do need to be mindful of enrollment deadlines, you don’t 
want to rush into what is an important financial decision.
» If you go with a marketplace bronze plan, consider one that is compati￾ble with a health savings account (HSA). A bronze plan may be best for 
people who are generally healthy. These have the lowest premiums. Of 
course, they also have the highest deductibles, which means that in the event 
you do get sick, you’ll have to cover more of your costs out of pocket. And 
that is why it’s important to select a bronze plan that’s compatible with an 
HSA (not all of them are). I have long recommended HSAs as a great tax￾saving strategy, and now that deductibles are so high, they make more 
sense than ever. After all, if you have to have a high deductible anyway, 
at least getting the tax break on the out-of-pocket expenses you have to 
pay makes sense.
» Do what you can to get and stay healthy. Chances are you’ll now be paying 
more out of pocket for nonpreventative care, so good health should be your 
top priority. Of course, health insurance is needed because some conditions 
are unpreventable, but you can affect plenty of others with lifestyle improve￾ments. Obviously, if you smoke, stop now; smoking is the only “preexisting 
condition” health insurance companies are allowed to charge you more for. 
But it’s also important to eat healthfully, exercise, and lose weight if you need 
to. The healthier you are, the less you’ll need to seek medical care — and the 
less you’ll have to pay out of pocket for your care.
Looking at retiree medical care insurance
Medicare, the government-run health insurance plan for those age 65 and over, is 
a multi-part major medical plan. Enrollment in Part A (hospital expenses) is 
automatic. Part B, which covers physician expenses and other charges, including 
home healthcare coverage; Part C, supplemental Medicare coverage (sold through 
private insurers); and Part D, for prescription drugs (provided through private 
insurers), are optional. Supplemental insurance policies, also known as Medigap 
coverage, may be of interest to you if you want help paying for the costs that 
Medicare doesn’t pay.CHAPTER 17 Insurance on You: Life, Disability, and Health 359
Closing Medicare’s gaps
Medigap coverage generally pays the deductibles and co-payments that Medicare 
charges. For the first 60 days of hospitalization, you pay $1,600 total out of your 
own pocket. If you have an unusually long hospital stay, you pay $400 per day for 
the 61st through the 90th day, $800 per day for the 91st through the 150th day, 
and all costs beyond 150 days. Clearly, if you stay in a hospital for many months, 
your out-of-pocket expenses can escalate; however, the longest hospitalizations 
tend not to last for many months. Also note that Medicare’s hospitalization ben￾efits refresh when you’re out of the hospital for 60 consecutive days.
If you’re unable to pay for the deductibles and co-payments because your income 
is low, making a long hospital stay a financial catastrophe for you, Medicaid (the 
state-run medical insurance program for low-income people) may help pay your 
bills. Alternatively, Medigap insurance can help close the gap.
DEALING WITH MEDICAL CLAIMS 
HEADACHES
If you sign up for a health plan that has deductibles and co-payments, make sure you 
review the benefits statements your insurer sends you. Errors often pop up on these 
statements and during the claims filing process. Not surprisingly, the errors are usually 
at your expense.
Make sure that your insurer has kept accurate track of your contributions toward meet￾ing your plan’s annual deductible and maximum out-of-pocket charges. Also, don’t pay 
any healthcare providers who send you bills until you receive proper notification from 
the insurance company detailing what you are obligated to pay those providers accord￾ing to the terms of your plan. Because most insurance companies have negotiated dis￾counted fee schedules with healthcare providers, the amount that a provider bills you is 
often higher than the amount they’re legally due as per the terms of their contract with 
your insurer. Your insurer’s benefits statement should detail the approved and negoti￾ated rate once the claim is processed. Providers are due only the discounted fees they 
agreed to with your insurer.
Haggling with your health insurer is a real pain, and it usually happens after you rack up 
significant medical expenses and may still not be feeling well. But if you don’t stay on 
top of your insurer, you can end up paying thousands of dollars in overpayments. If 
you’re overwhelmed with an avalanche of claims and benefits statements, you may 
want to consider using a health insurance claims processing service. You can get a refer￾ral to firms that engage in this line of work by visiting the Alliance of Claims Assistance 
Professionals website at www.claims.org.360 PART 4 Insurance: Protecting What You Have
Check with your physician(s) to see whether they charge a fee higher than the one 
listed on Medicare’s fee schedule. If your physician does charge a higher fee, you 
may want to consider going to another physician if you can’t afford the fee or if 
you want to save some money. (But don’t drop your current doctor before finding 
another who accepts Medicare and you as a patient. Many doctors are not accept￾ing Medicare patients.) Medicare often pays only 80 percent of the physician 
charges that the program allows on its fee schedule.
The biggest reason that elderly people consider long-term care insurance is that 
Medicare pays only for the first 100 days in a skilled nursing facility. Anything 
over that is your responsibility. Unfortunately, Medigap policies don’t address this 
issue, either.
Long-term care insurance
Insurance agents who are eager to earn a hefty commission will often tell you that 
long-term care (LTC) insurance is the solution to your concerns about an extended 
stay in a nursing home. Don’t get your hopes up. Policies are complicated and 
filled with all sorts of exclusions and limitations. On top of all that, they’re 
expensive.
The decision to purchase LTC insurance is a trade-off. Do you want to pay 
thousands of dollars annually, beginning at age 60, to guard against the possibil￾ity of a long-term stay in a nursing home (or possibly to pay for in-home assis￾tance if you qualify)? If you live into or past your mid-80s, you can end up paying 
$100,000+ on an LTC policy (not to mention the lost investment earnings on these 
insurance premiums).
People who end up in a nursing home for years on end may come out ahead finan￾cially when buying LTC insurance. The majority of people who stay in a nursing 
home are there for less than a year, though, because they either pass away or 
move out. Medicare pays for the bulk of the cost of the first 100 days in a nursing 
home as long as certain conditions are satisfied. Medicare pays for all basic 
services (telephone, television, and private room charges excluded) for the first 
20 days and then requires a co-payment of $200 per day for the next 80 days. 
First, the nursing-home stay must follow hospitalization within 30 days, and the 
nursing-home stay must be for the same medical condition that caused the 
hospitalization. When you’re discharged from the nursing home, you can qualify 
for an additional 100-day benefit period as long as you haven’t been hospitalized 
or in a nursing home in the 60 days prior to your readmission.
If you have relatives or a spouse who will likely care for you in the event of a major 
illness, you definitely should not waste your money on nursing-home insurance. 
You can also bypass this coverage if you have and don’t mind using retirement 
assets to help pay nursing-home costs.CHAPTER 17 Insurance on You: Life, Disability, and Health 361
Even if you do deplete your assets, remember that you have a backup: Medicaid 
(state-provided medical insurance) can pick up the cost if you can’t. However, be 
aware of a number of potential drawbacks to getting coverage for nursing-home 
stays under Medicaid:
» Medicaid patients are at the bottom of the priority list. Most nursing 
homes are interested in the bottom line, so the patients who bring in the least 
revenue — namely Medicaid patients — get the lowest priority on nursing￾home waiting lists.
» Some nursing homes don’t take Medicaid patients. Check with your 
preferred nursing homes in your area to see whether they accept Medicaid.
» The states may squeeze Medicaid further. Deciding which medical 
conditions warrant coverage is up to your state. When budgets tighten, some 
states are disallowing certain types of coverage.
If you’re concerned about having your stash of money wiped out by an extended 
nursing-home stay and you have a strong desire to pass money to your family or 
a favorite charity, you can start giving your money away while you’re still healthy. 
(If you’re already in poor health, legal experts can strategize to preserve your 
assets and keep them from being used to pay nursing-home costs.)
Consider buying LTC insurance if you want to retain and protect your assets and it 
gives you peace of mind to know that a long-term nursing-home stay is covered. 
But do some comparison shopping, and make sure that you buy a policy that pays 
benefits for the long term. A year’s worth (or even a few years’ worth) of benefits 
won’t protect your assets if your stay lasts longer. Also be sure to get a policy that 
adjusts the daily benefit amount for increases in the cost of living. Get a policy 
that covers care in your home or other settings if you don’t need to be in a high￾cost nursing home, and make sure that it doesn’t require prior hospitalization for 
benefits to kick in. To keep premiums down, also consider a longer exclusion or 
waiting period — three to six months or a year before coverage starts.
You may also want to consider retirement communities if you’re willing to live as 
a younger retiree in such a setting. After paying an entrance fee, you pay a monthly 
fee, which usually covers your rent, care, and meals. Make sure that any such 
facility you’re considering guarantees care for life and preferably has a continuum 
of care levels available. Also verify that it accepts Medicaid in case you deplete 
your assets.362 PART 4 Insurance: Protecting What You Have
Making sense of Medicare’s 
prescription drug program
As if there weren’t enough confusing government programs, Uncle Sam created 
yet another that began in 2006 — the Medicare (Part D) prescription drug plan. 
Here are some key facts you need to know about these somewhat complicated 
plans, which are offered through private insurers:
» Plans make the most sense for those who expect to spend more than $5,000 
annually on prescription drugs.
» If you choose not to enroll when you’re first eligible and then later enroll, you’ll 
be charged a penalty equal to 1 percent of the national average Part D 
premium for each month that has elapsed since you were first eligible to 
participate. You will pay this penalty for as long as you’re in the plan.
» If you’re on the fence about enrolling, consider starting with a low-premium 
plan that then gives you the right to transfer into a higher-cost and better￾coverage plan without paying the late enrollment penalty.
» Visit www.medicare.gov for helpful information on drug plans and how to 
select one. For example, click on the Formulary (drug) Finder to identify 
specific insurer plans that cover your current medications or your anticipated 
future medications. AARP’s website, www.aarp.org, also has plenty of 
information and resources to find out more about these confusing plans.CHAPTER 18 Covering Your Assets 363
Chapter 18
Covering Your Assets
I
n Chapter 17, I discuss the importance of protecting your future income from 
disability, death, or large unexpected medical expenses. You should also insure 
major assets that you’ve acquired: your home, your car, and your personal 
property. Protect these assets for two reasons:
» Your assets are valuable. If you were to suffer a loss, replacing the assets 
with money out of your own pocket could be a financial catastrophe.
» A lawsuit can drain your finances. Should someone be injured or killed in 
your home or because of your car, a lawsuit could be financially devastating.
In this chapter, I explain why, how, and for how much to insure your home, per￾sonal property, and vehicle. I also discuss excess liability insurance and how to 
determine where your money will go in the event of your death.
Insuring Your Home
When you buy a home with a mortgage, most lenders require you to purchase 
homeowner’s insurance. But even if they don’t, you’re wise to do so, because your 
home and the personal property within it are worth a great deal and would be 
costly to replace.
IN THIS CHAPTER
» Reviewing renter’s and homeowner’s 
insurance
» Assessing automobile insurance
» Understanding umbrella (excess 
liability) insurance
» Ensuring your estate is handled as 
you want364 PART 4 Insurance: Protecting What You Have
As a renter, damage to the building in which you live isn’t your immediate finan￾cial concern, but you still have personal property you may want to insure. You also 
have the possibility (albeit remote) that you’ll be sued by someone who’s injured 
while in your rental.
When shopping for a homeowner’s or renter’s policy, consider the important fea￾tures that I cover in the following sections.
Dwelling coverage: The cost to rebuild
How much would it cost you to rebuild your home if it were completely destroyed, 
for example, in a fire? The cost to rebuild should be based on the size (square foot￾age) of your home and its amenities. Neither the purchase price nor the size of 
your mortgage should determine how much dwelling coverage you need.
If you’re a renter, rejoice that you don’t need dwelling coverage. If you’re a con￾dominium owner, find out whether the insurance the condo association bought 
for the entire building is sufficient.
Be sure that your homeowner’s policy includes a guaranteed replacement cost
provision. This useful feature ensures that the insurance company will rebuild 
the home even if the cost of construction is more than the policy coverage. If the 
insurance company underestimates your dwelling coverage, it has to make up the 
difference.
Unfortunately, insurers define guaranteed replacement cost differently. While 
some companies pay for the full replacement cost of the home, no matter how 
much it ends up costing, most insurers set limits. For example, some insurers 
may pay up to only 25 percent more than the dwelling coverage on your policy. 
Ask your insurer how it defines guaranteed replacement cost.
If you have an older property that doesn’t meet current building standards, con￾sider buying a rider (supplemental coverage to your main insurance policy) that 
pays for code upgrades. This rider covers the cost of rebuilding your home, in the 
event of a loss, to comply with current building codes that may be more stringent 
than the ones in place when your home was built. Ask your insurance company 
what your basic policy does and doesn’t cover. Some companies include a certain 
amount (for example, 10 percent of your dwelling coverage) for code upgrades in 
the base policy.
Personal property coverage: For your things
On your homeowner’s policy, the amount of personal property coverage is typi￾cally derived from the amount of dwelling coverage you carry. Generally, you get CHAPTER 18 Covering Your Assets 365
personal property coverage that’s equal to 50 to 75 percent of the dwelling cover￾age. This amount is usually more than enough. Some insurers allow you to cus￾tomize this personal property amount, which may save you money as most people 
need less than 50 to 75 percent of their dwelling coverage.
Regarding riders to cover jewelry, computers, collectibles, and other somewhat 
costly items that may not be fully covered by typical homeowner’s policies, ask 
yourself whether the out-of-pocket expense from the loss of such items would 
constitute a financial catastrophe. Unless you have more than several thousand 
dollars’ worth of jewelry or computer equipment, skip such riders.
Some policies come with replacement cost guarantees that pay you the cost to replace 
an item. This payment can be considerably more than what the used item was 
worth before it was damaged or stolen. When this feature is not part of the stan￾dard policy sold by your insurer, you may want to purchase it as a rider, if available.
As a renter or condominium owner, you need to choose a dollar amount for the 
personal property you want covered. Tally it up instead of guessing — the total 
cost of replacing all your personal property may surprise you.
Make a list of your belongings — or even better, take pictures or make a video — 
with an estimate of what they’re worth. Keep this list updated; you’ll need it if you 
have to file a claim. Retaining receipts for major purchases may also help your 
case. No matter how you document your belongings, don’t forget to keep the doc￾umentation somewhere besides your home — otherwise, it can be destroyed along 
with the rest of your house in a fire or other disaster.
Liability insurance: Coverage for 
when others are harmed
Liability insurance protects you financially against lawsuits that may arise if 
someone gets injured on your property, including wounds inflicted by the family’s 
pernicious pup or terrible tabby. (Of course, you should keep Bruno restrained 
when guests visit — even your cranky in-laws.) At a minimum, get enough liabil￾ity insurance to cover your financial assets — covering two times your assets is 
better. Buying extra coverage is inexpensive and well worth the cost.
The probability of being sued is low, but if you are sued and lose, you can end up 
owing big bucks. If you have substantial assets to protect, you may want to 
consider an umbrella, or excess liability, policy. (See “Protecting against Mega￾Liability: Umbrella Insurance” later in this chapter.)366 PART 4 Insurance: Protecting What You Have
Liability protection is one of the side benefits of purchasing a renter’s policy — 
you protect your personal property as well as insure against lawsuits. (But don’t 
be reckless with your banana peels even if you get liability insurance!)
Flood and earthquake insurance: 
Protection from Mother Nature
You should purchase the broadest possible coverage when buying any type of 
insurance (see Chapter 16). The problem with homeowner’s insurance is that it’s 
not comprehensive enough — it doesn’t typically cover losses due to earthquakes 
and floods. You must buy such disaster coverage separately.
If an earthquake or flood were to strike your area and destroy your home, you’d be 
out tens (if not hundreds) of thousands of dollars without proper coverage. Yet 
many people don’t carry these important coverages, often as a result of some 
common misconceptions:
» “Not in my neighborhood.” Many people mistakenly believe that earth￾quakes occur only in California. I wish this were true for those who live in the 
other 49 states, but it’s not. In fact, one of the strongest earthquakes in the 
United States occurred in the Midwest, and known (though less active) fault 
lines lie along the East Coast. The cost of earthquake coverage is based on 
insurance companies’ assessment of the risk of your area and property type. 
You shouldn’t decide whether to buy insurance based on how small you think 
the risk is. The risk is already built in to the price.
An estimated 20,000 communities around the country face potential flood 
damage. Like earthquakes, floods are not a covered risk in standard home￾owner’s policies, so you need to purchase a flood insurance rider. Check with 
your current homeowner’s insurer or with the insurers recommended in this 
chapter. The federal government flood insurance program (www.floodsmart.
gov) provides background information on flood insurance policies.
» “The government will bail me out.” The vast majority of government 
financial assistance is obtained through low-interest loans. Loans, unfortu￾nately, need to be repaid, and that money comes out of your pocket.
» “In a major disaster, insurers would go bankrupt anyway.” This is highly 
unlikely given the reserves insurers are required to keep and the fact that the 
insurance companies reinsure — that is, they buy insurance to back up the 
policies they write. Also, state regulatory agencies facilitate the merging of 
faltering insurers into strong entities.CHAPTER 18 Covering Your Assets 367
People who have little equity in their property and are willing to walk away from 
their property and mortgage in the event of a major quake or flood may consider 
not buying earthquake or flood coverage. Keep in mind that walking away dam￾ages your credit report, because you’re essentially defaulting on your loan.
You may be able to pay for some of the cost of earthquake or flood insurance by 
raising the deductibles (discussed in the next section) on the main part of your 
homeowner’s/renter’s insurance and other insurance policies (such as auto insur￾ance). You can more easily afford the smaller claims, not the big ones. If you think 
flood or earthquake insurance is expensive, compare those costs with the expen￾ditures you would incur to completely replace your home and personal property. 
Buy this insurance if you live in an area that has a chance of being affected by 
these catastrophes. To help keep the cost of earthquake insurance down, consider 
taking a 10-percent deductible. Most insurers offer deductibles of 5, 10, or 20 per￾cent of the cost to rebuild your home. Ten percent of the rebuilding cost is a good 
chunk of money. But losing the other 90 percent is what you want to insure 
against. (For most people, a 20-percent deductible is too high.)
Deductibles: Your cost with a claim
As I discuss in Chapter 16, the point of insurance is to protect against catastrophic 
losses, not the little losses. By taking the highest deductibles you’re comfortable 
with, you save on insurance premiums year after year, and you don’t have to go 
through the hassle of filing small claims.
Special discounts
You may qualify for special discounts on your policy. Companies and agents that 
sell homeowner’s and renter’s insurance don’t always check to see whether you’re 
eligible for discounts. After all, the more you spend on policy premiums, the more 
money they make! If your property has a security system, you’re older, or you 
have other policies with the same insurer, you may qualify for a lower rate. 
Remember to ask.
Also, be aware that insurers use your credit score as a factor in setting some of 
your insurance rates. They do this because their studies have shown that folks 
who have higher credit scores tend to have fewer accidents and insurance claims. 
See Chapter 3 for how to assess and improve your credit reports and scores.368 PART 4 Insurance: Protecting What You Have
Buying homeowner’s or renter’s insurance
Each insurance company prices its homeowner’s and renter’s policies based on its 
own criteria. So the lowest-cost company for your friend’s property may not be 
the lowest-cost company for yours. You have to shop around at several companies 
to find the best rates. The following list features companies that historically offer 
lower-cost policies for most people and have decent track records regarding cus￾tomer satisfaction and the payment of claims:
» Amica: Although Amica does have good customer satisfaction, its prices are 
high in some areas. You can contact the company by calling 800-242-6422 or 
checking out the company’s website at www.amica.com.
» Auto-Owners: Not just for insuring autos, this company offers home insur￾ance too. Check your local phone directory for agents, call 517-323-1200, or 
visit www.auto-owners.com.
» Erie Insurance: This company does business primarily in the Midwest and 
Mid-Atlantic. Check your local phone directory for agents, call 800-458-0811 
for a referral to a local agent, or visit the company’s website at www.
erieinsurance.com.
» GEICO: You can contact the company by calling 800-841-2964 or visit 
www.geico.com.
» NJM Insurance: Offers insurance in Connecticut, Maryland, New Jersey, 
Ohio, and Pennsylvania. Contact the company at 800-232-6600 or visit 
www.njm.com.
» State Farm: Check your local phone directory for agents, call 844-803-1573, 
or visit www.statefarm.com.
» USAA: This company provides insurance for members of the military 
and their families. Call the company at 800-531-8722 (or visit its website 
at www.usaa.com) to see whether you qualify.
Don’t worry that some of these companies require you to call a toll-free number 
for a price quote. This process saves you money because these insurers don’t have 
to pay commissions to local agents hawking their policies. These companies have 
local claims representatives to help you if and when you have a claim.
A number of the companies mentioned in the preceding list sell other types of 
insurance (for example, life insurance) that aren’t as competitively priced. Be sure 
to check out the relevant sections in this part of the book for the best places to buy 
these other types of coverage if you need them.CHAPTER 18 Covering Your Assets 369
Some state insurance departments conduct surveys of insurers’ prices and 
tabulate complaints received. Look up your state’s department of insurance phone 
number in the government section of your local phone directory or visit the 
National Association of Insurance Commissioners’ website at content.naic.org/
state-insurance-departments to find links to each state’s department of insur￾ance site.
Auto Insurance 101
Over the course of your life, you may spend tens of thousands of dollars on auto 
insurance. Much of the money people spend on auto insurance is not spent where 
it’s needed most. In other cases, the money is simply wasted. Look for the follow￾ing important features when searching for an auto insurance policy.
Bodily injury/property damage liability
As with homeowner’s liability insurance, auto liability insurance provides insur￾ance against lawsuits. Accidents happen, especially with a car. Make sure you have 
enough bodily injury liability insurance, which pays for harm done to others, to 
cover your assets. (Coverage of double your assets is preferable.)
If you’re just beginning to accumulate assets, don’t mistakenly assume that you 
don’t need liability protection. Many states require a minimum amount — insurers 
should be able to fill you in on the details for your state. Also, don’t forget that your 
future earnings, which are an asset, can be garnished in a lawsuit.
Property damage liability insurance covers damage done by your car to other 
people’s cars or property. The amount of property damage liability coverage in an 
auto insurance policy is usually determined as a consequence of the bodily injury 
liability amount selected. Coverage of $50,000 is a good minimum to start with.
Uninsured or underinsured 
motorist liability
When you’re in an accident with another motorist and they don’t carry their own 
liability protection (or don’t carry enough), uninsured or underinsured motorist 
liability coverage on your policy allows you to collect for lost wages, medical 
expenses, and pain and suffering incurred in the accident.370 PART 4 Insurance: Protecting What You Have
If you already have comprehensive health and long-term disability insurance, 
uninsured or underinsured motorist liability coverage is largely redundant. 
However, if you drop this coverage, you do give up the ability to sue for general 
pain and suffering and to insure passengers in your car who may lack adequate 
medical and disability coverage.
To provide a death benefit to those financially dependent on you in the event of a 
fatal auto accident, buy term life insurance (see Chapter 17).
Deductibles
To minimize your auto insurance premiums and eliminate the need to file small 
claims, take the highest deductible you’re comfortable with. (Most people should 
consider a $500 to $1,000 deductible.) On an auto policy, two deductibles exist: 
collision and comprehensive. Collision applies to claims arising from collisions. 
(Note that if you have collision coverage on your own policy, you can generally 
bypass collision coverage when you rent a car.) Comprehensive applies to other 
claims for damages not caused by collision (for example, a window broken by 
vandals).
COPING WITH TEEN DRIVERS
If you have a teenage driver in your household, you’re going to be spending a lot more 
on auto insurance (in addition to worrying a lot more). As soon as you decide to allow 
your teenager to drive, you can take a number of steps to avoid spending all your take￾home pay on auto insurance bills:
• Make sure your teen does well in school. Some insurers offer discounts if your 
child is a strong academic achiever and has successfully completed a driver’s 
education class.
• Get price quotes from several insurers to see how adding your teen driver to 
your policy affects the cost.
• Have your teenager share in the costs of using the car. If you pay all the 
insurance, gas, and maintenance bills, your teenager won’t value the privilege 
of using your “free” car.
Of course, teen driving involves more than just keeping your insurance bills to a 
minimum. For more on driving responsibly, see the sidebar “Driving safely: Overlooked 
auto insurance” in this chapter.CHAPTER 18 Covering Your Assets 371
As your car ages and loses its value, you can eventually eliminate your compre￾hensive and collision coverages altogether. The point at which you do this is up to 
you. Insurers won’t pay more than the book value of your car, regardless of what 
it costs to repair or replace it. Remember that the purpose of insurance is to com￾pensate you for losses that are financially catastrophic to you. For some people, 
this amount may be as high as $5,000 or more — others may choose $1,000 as 
their threshold point.
Special discounts: Auto edition
You may be eligible for special discounts on auto insurance. Don’t forget to tell 
your agent or insurer if your car has a security alarm, air bags, or anti-lock brakes. 
If you’re older or you have other policies or cars insured with the same insurer, 
you may also qualify for discounts. And make sure that you’re given appropriate 
“good driver” discounts if you’ve been accident- and ticket-free in recent years.
Before you buy your next car, call insurers and ask for insurance quotes for the 
different models you’re considering. The cost of insuring a car should factor into 
your decision of which car you buy, because the insurance costs represent a major 
portion of your car’s ongoing operating expenses.
Little-stuff coverage to skip
Auto insurers have dreamed up all sorts of riders, such as towing and rental car 
reimbursement. On the surface, these riders appear to be inexpensive. But they’re 
expensive given the small amount you’d collect from a claim and the hassle of 
filing.
Riders that waive the deductible under certain circumstances make no sense, 
either. The point of the deductible is to reduce your policy cost and eliminate the 
hassle of filing small claims.
Medical payments coverage typically pays a few thousand dollars for medical 
expenses. If you and your passengers carry major medical insurance coverage, 
this rider isn’t really necessary. Besides, a few thousand dollars of medical cover￾age doesn’t protect you against catastrophic expenses.
Buying auto insurance
You can use the homeowner’s insurers list I present in the earlier section “Buying 
homeowner’s or renter’s insurance” to obtain quotes for auto insurance. In addi￾tion, you can visit AAA/Auto Club on the web at www.aaa.com/auto and find your 
nearest AAA/Auto Club by entering your zip code.372 PART 4 Insurance: Protecting What You Have
Protecting against Mega-Liability: 
Umbrella Insurance
Umbrella insurance (which is also referred to as excess liability insurance) is liability 
insurance that’s added on top of the liability protection on your home and car(s). 
If, for example, you have $700,000 in assets, you can buy a $1 million umbrella 
liability policy to add to the $300,000 liability insurance that you have on your 
home and car. Expect to pay a couple hundred dollars — a small cost for big pro￾tection. Each year, thousands of people suffer lawsuits of more than $1 million 
related to their cars and homes.
Umbrella insurance is generally sold in increments of $1 million. So how do you 
decide how much you need if you have a lot of assets? You should have at least 
enough liability insurance to protect your assets and preferably enough to cover 
twice the value of those assets. To purchase umbrella insurance, start by contact￾ing your existing homeowner’s or auto insurance company.
DRIVING SAFELY: OVERLOOKED 
AUTO INSURANCE
Tragic events (murders, fires, hurricanes, plane crashes, and so on) are well-covered by 
the media, but the number of deaths that make the news pales in comparison to the 
more than 30,000 people who die on America’s roads every year. I’m not suggesting that 
the national media should start reporting every automobile fatality. Even 24 hours of 
daily CNN coverage probably couldn’t keep up with all the accidents on our roads. But 
the real story with auto fatalities lies not in the who, what, and where of specific accidents 
but in the why. Asking the why question reveals how many of them are preventable.
No matter what kind of car you drive, you can and should drive safely. Stay within the 
speed limits and don’t drive while intoxicated or tired or in adverse weather conditions. 
Wear your seat belt — a U.S. Department of Transportation study found that 60 percent 
of auto passengers killed were not wearing their seat belts. And don’t try to talk or text 
on your cellphone and write notes on a pad of paper attached to your dashboard while 
sipping your coffee!
You can also greatly reduce your risk of dying in an accident by driving a safe car. 
You don’t need to spend buckets of money to get a car with desirable safety features.

Planning Your Estate
Estate planning is the process of determining what will happen to your assets after 
you die. Considering your mortality in the context of insurance may seem a bit 
odd. But the time and cost of various estate-planning maneuvers is really nothing 
more than buying insurance: You’re ensuring that, after you die, everything will 
be taken care of as you wish, and taxes will be minimized. Thinking about estate 
planning in this way can help you better evaluate whether certain options make 
sense at particular points in your life.
Depending upon your circumstances, you may eventually want to contact an 
attorney who specializes in estate-planning matters. However, educating yourself 
first about the different options is worth your time. More than a few attorneys 
have their own agendas about what you should do, so be careful. And most of the 
estate-planning strategies that you’re likely to benefit from don’t require hiring 
an attorney.
Wills, living wills, and medical 
powers of attorney
When you have children who are minors (dependents), a will is a necessity. The 
will names the guardian to whom you entrust your children if both you and your 
spouse die. Should you and your spouse both die without a will (called intestate), 
the state (courts and social-service agencies) decides who will raise your children. 
Therefore, even if you can’t decide at this time who you want to raise your chil￾dren, you should at least appoint a trusted guardian who can decide for you.
DIVERSIFICATION: INVESTMENT 
INSURANCE
Insurance companies don’t sell policies that protect the value of your investments, but 
you can shield your portfolio from many of the dangers of a fickle market through 
diversification.
If all your money is invested in bank accounts or bonds, you’re exposed to the risks of 
inflation, which can erode your money’s purchasing power. Conversely, if the bulk of 
your money is invested in one high-risk stock, your financial future could go up in 
smoke if that stock implodes.
Chapter 10 discusses the benefits of diversification and tells you how to assemble a 
portfolio of investments that do well under different conditions.374 PART 4 Insurance: Protecting What You Have
Having a will makes good sense even if you don’t have kids, because it gives 
instructions on how to handle and distribute all your worldly possessions. If you 
die without a will, your state decides how to distribute your money and other 
property, according to state law. Therefore, your friends, distant relatives, and 
favorite charities will probably receive nothing. Without any living relatives, your 
money may go to the state government!
Without a will, your heirs are legally powerless, and the state may appoint an 
administrator to supervise the distribution of your assets at a fee of around 5 per￾cent of your estate. A bond typically must also be posted at a cost of several hun￾dred dollars.
A living will and a medical power of attorney are useful additions to a standard 
will. A living will (also known as an advanced healthcare directive) tells your doctor 
what, if any, life-support measures you prefer. A medical (or healthcare) power of 
attorney grants authority to someone you trust to make decisions regarding your 
medical care options.
The simplest and least costly way to prepare a will, a living will, and a medical 
power of attorney is to use the high-quality, user-friendly software packages that 
I recommend in Chapter  20. Be sure to give copies of these documents to the 
guardians and executors named in the documents. You don’t need an attorney to 
make a legal will. Most attorneys, in fact, prepare wills and living trusts using 
software packages! What makes a will valid is that three people witness your sign￾ing of it.
If preparing the will all by yourself seems overwhelming, you can (instead of hir￾ing an attorney) use a paralegal typing service to help you prepare the documents. 
These services generally charge 50 percent or less of what an attorney charges.
Avoiding probate through living trusts
Because of the United States’ quirky legal system, even if you have a will, some or 
all of your assets must go through a court process known as probate. Probate is the 
legal process for administering and implementing the directions in a will. Prop￾erty and assets that are owned in joint tenancy or inside retirement accounts, such 
as IRAs or 401(k)s, generally pass to heirs without having to go through probate. 
However, most other assets are probated.
A living trust effectively transfers assets into a trust. As the trustee, you control 
those assets, and you can revoke the trust whenever you desire. The advantage of 
a living trust is that upon your death, assets can pass directly to your beneficiaries 
without going through probate. Probate can be a lengthy, expensive hassle for 
your heirs — with legal fees tallying 5 percent or more of the value of the estate. 
In addition, your assets become a matter of public record as a result of probate.CHAPTER 18 Covering Your Assets 375
Living trusts are likely to be of greatest value to people who meet one or more of 
the following criteria (the more that apply, the more value trusts have):
» Age 60 or older
» Single
» Assets worth more than $100,000 that must pass through probate (including 
real estate, nonretirement accounts, and small businesses)
» Real property held in other states
As with a will, you do not need an attorney to establish a legal and valid living 
trust. (See my software recommendations in Chapter 20 and consider the parale￾gal services that I mention in the preceding section.) Attorney fees for establish￾ing a living trust can range from hundreds to thousands of dollars. Hiring an 
attorney is of greatest value to people with large estates (see the next section) who 
don’t have the time, desire, and expertise to maximize the value derived from 
estate planning. Also consult with an attorney if you have nonstandard wishes to 
be carried out, such as special-needs beneficiaries or extra control measures you 
want applied to assets after incapacity or death.
Note: Living trusts keep assets out of probate but have nothing to do with mini￾mizing estate or inheritance taxes.
Reducing estate taxes
Under current tax laws, an individual can pass $12.92 million to beneficiaries with￾out having to pay federal estate taxes (married couples can pass $25.84 million).
Whether you should be concerned about possible estate taxes depends on several 
issues. How much of your assets you’re going to use up during your life is the first 
and most important issue you need to consider. This amount depends on how 
much your assets grow over time, as well as how rapidly you spend money. During 
retirement, you’ll (hopefully) be using at least some of your money.
I’ve seen too many affluent individuals, especially in their retirements, worry 
about estate taxes on their assets. If your intention is to leave your money to your 
children, grandchildren, or a charity, why not start giving while you’re still alive 
so you can enjoy the act? You can give $17,000 annually to each of your beneficia￾ries, tax-free. By giving away money, you reduce your estate and, therefore, the 
estate taxes owed on it. Any appreciation on the value of the gift between the date 
of the gift and your date of death is also out of your estate and not subject to estate 
taxes.376 PART 4 Insurance: Protecting What You Have
In addition to gifting, a number of trusts allow you to minimize estate taxes. 
Although it’s no longer generally necessary at the federal level, you may want to 
establish a bypass trust to effectively double the estate tax limit for your state. Upon 
the death of the first spouse, assets held in their name go into the bypass trust, 
effectively removing those assets from the remaining spouse’s taxable estate. 
(Speak with an estate-planning attorney.)
Cash value life insurance is another estate-planning tool. Unfortunately, it’s a tool 
that’s overused or, I should say, oversold. People who sell cash value insurance — 
that is, insurance salespeople and others masquerading as financial planners — 
too often advocate life insurance as the one and only way to reduce estate taxes. 
Other methods for reducing estate taxes are usually superior, because they don’t 
require wasting money on life insurance.
Small-business owners whose businesses are worth several million dollars or 
more may want to consider cash value life insurance under specialized circum￾stances. If you lack the necessary additional assets to pay expected estate taxes 
and you don’t want your beneficiaries to be forced to sell the business, you can buy 
cash value life insurance to pay expected estate taxes. To find out more about how 
to reduce your estate (and other) taxes, visit my website at www.erictyson.com.5

Working with 
Financial Planners
Hiring a competent and ethical financial planner or advisor to help you make 
and implement financial decisions can be money well spent. But if you pick 
a poor advisor or someone who really isn’t a financial planner but rather a 
salesperson in disguise, your financial situation can get worse instead of better. So 
before I talk about the different types of help for hire, I discuss the options you 
have for directing the management of your personal finances.
Surveying Your Financial 
Management Options
Everyone has three basic choices for managing money: You can do nothing, you 
can do it yourself, or you can hire someone to help you. This section lays out these 
three options in more detail.
IN THIS CHAPTER
» Checking out your choices for 
managing your finances
» Determining whether you need help 
from a financial planner
» Searching for a stellar financial 
advisor

before you hire them380 PART 5 Where to Go for More Help
Doing nothing
The do-nothing (or do-little) approach has a sizable following (and you thought 
you were alone!). People who fall into this category may be leading exciting, 
interesting lives and are therefore too busy to attend to something as mundane as 
dealing with their personal finances. Or they may be leading mundane existences 
but are too busy fantasizing about more-appealing ways to spend their time.
The dangers of doing nothing are many. Putting off saving for retirement or 
ignoring your buildup of debt eventually comes back to haunt you. If you don’t 
carry adequate insurance, accidents can be devastating. Fires, earthquakes, floods, 
and hurricanes show how precarious living in paradise actually is.
If you’ve been following the do-nothing approach all your life, you’re now offi￾cially promoted out of it! You bought this book to find out more about personal 
finance and make changes in your money matters, right? So keep reading and take 
control!
Doing it yourself
Do-it-yourselfers learn enough about financial topics to make informed decisions 
on their own. Doing anything yourself, of course, requires you to invest some time 
to understand the basic concepts and keep up with changes. The hardest part of 
managing money for most people is catching up on things that they should have 
done previously. After you get things in order, which you can easily do with this 
book as your companion, you shouldn’t have to spend more than an hour or two 
every few months working on your personal finances (unless a major issue, like a 
real-estate purchase, comes up).
Some people in the financial advisory business like to make what they do seem so 
complicated that they compare it to brain surgery! Their argument goes, “You 
wouldn’t perform brain surgery on yourself, so why would you manage your 
money yourself?” Well, to this I say, “Personal financial management ain’t brain 
surgery — not even close.” You can manage on your own. In fact, you can do a 
better job than most advisors. Why? Because you’re not subject to their conflicts 
of interest, and you care the most about your money.
Hiring financial help
Realizing that you need to hire someone to help you make and implement finan￾cial decisions can be a valuable insight. Spending a few hours and several hundred 
dollars to hire a competent professional can be money well spent, even if you have CHAPTER 19 Working with Financial Planners 381
a modest income or assets. But you need to know what your money is buying. 
Financial planners or advisors make money in three ways:
» They earn commissions based on the sales of financial products.
» They charge a percentage of the assets they invest and oversee/manage on 
your behalf.
» They charge by the hour (this can also be done through fixed-fee 
arrangements).
The following sections help you differentiate among the three main types of 
financial planners.
Commission-based “planners”
Commission-based planners aren’t really planners, advisors, or counselors at 
all — they’re salespeople. Prior generations’ “stockbrokers” and “insurance bro￾kers” are now called financial consultants or financial service representatives in order 
to glamorize the profession and obscure how they’re compensated. Ditto for 
insurance salespeople calling themselves estate planning specialists.
A broker referring to themself as a financial consultant is like a Honda dealer call￾ing themself a transportation consultant. A Honda dealer is a salesperson who 
makes a living selling Hondas — period. Such dealers definitely aren’t going to 
tell you nice things about Ford, Chrysler, or Toyota cars — unless, of course, they 
happen to sell those, too. They also have no interest in educating you about poten￾tially money-saving public-transit possibilities!
Salespeople and brokers masquerading as planners can have an enormous 
self-interest when they push certain products, particularly those products that 
pay generous commissions. Getting paid on commission tends to skew their 
recommendations toward certain strategies (such as buying investment or life￾insurance products) and to cause them to ignore or downplay other aspects of 
your finances. For example, they’ll gladly sell you an investment rather than per￾suade you to pay off your high-interest debts or save and invest through your 
employer’s retirement plan, thereby reducing your taxes.
Table  19-1 gives you an idea of the commissions that a financial planner/
salesperson can earn by selling particular financial products.382 PART 5 Where to Go for More Help
Percentage-of-assets-under-management 
advisors
A financial advisor who charges a percentage of the assets that are being managed 
or invested is generally a better choice than a commission-based planner. This 
compensation system removes the incentive to sell you products with high com￾missions and initiate lots of transactions (to generate more of those commissions).
The fee-based system is an improvement over product-pushers working on com￾mission, but it has flaws, too. Suppose that you’re trying to decide whether to 
invest in stocks, bonds, or real estate. A planner who earns a living managing your 
money likely won’t recommend real estate because that will deplete your invest￾ment capital. The planner also probably won’t recommend paying down your 
mortgage for the same reason.
Fee-based planners are also only interested in managing the money of those who 
have already accumulated a fair amount of it  — which rules out most people. 
Many have minimums of $100,000, $250,000, $500,000, or more.
Hourly-based advisors
Your best bet for professional help with your personal finances may be an advisor 
who charges for their time. Because they don’t sell any financial products, their 
objectivity is maintained. They don’t perform money management, so they can 
help you make comprehensive financial decisions with loans, retirement plan￾ning, and the selection of good investments, including real estate, mutual funds, 
and small business.

Annuities $1,000 to $2,000CHAPTER 19 Working with Financial Planners 383
Hiring someone incompetent is the primary risk you face when selecting an 
hourly-based planner. So be sure to check references and find out enough about 
finances on your own to discern between good and bad financial advice. Another 
risk comes from not clearly defining the work to be done and the approximate 
total cost of the planner’s service before you begin, so consider getting these 
items in writing. You should also review some of the other key questions that I 
outline in “Interviewing Financial Advisors: Asking the Right Questions” later in 
this chapter.
An entirely different kind of drawback occurs when you don’t follow through on 
your advisor’s recommendations. You pay for the advisor’s work but don’t act on 
it, so you don’t capture its potential value. If part of the reason you hired the plan￾ner in the first place was that you’re too busy or not interested enough to make 
changes to your financial situation, look for implementation support in the ser￾vices you buy from the planner.
Some planners charge a fixed fee to whip up a financial plan for you. Remember 
to ask how much of their time is involved in working with you, so you can assess 
the amount you’re paying per hour.
If you just need someone to act as a sounding board for ideas or to recommend a 
specific strategy or product, you can hire an hourly-based planner for one or two 
sessions of advice. You save money doing the legwork and implementation on 
your own. Just make sure the planner is willing to give you specific advice so you 
can properly implement the strategy.
Deciding Whether to Hire 
a Financial Planner
If you’re like most people, you don’t need to hire a financial planner, but you may 
benefit from hiring some help at certain times in your life. Good reasons for hiring 
a financial planner can be similar to the reasons you may have for hiring someone 
to clean your home or do your taxes. If you’re too busy, you don’t enjoy doing it, 
or you’re terribly uncomfortable making decisions on your own, using a planner 
for a second opinion makes good sense. And if you shy away from numbers and 
bristle at the thought of long division, a good planner can help you.384 PART 5 Where to Go for More Help
How a good financial advisor can help
The following list gives you a rundown of some of the important ways a compe￾tent financial planner can assist you:
» Identifying problems and goals: Many otherwise intelligent people have a 
hard time being objective about their financial problems. They may ignore 
their debts or have unrealistic goals and expectations given their financial 
situations and behaviors. And many are so busy with other aspects of their 
lives that they never take the time to think about what their financial goals 
are. A good financial planner can give you the objective perspective you need. 
Surprisingly, some people are in a better financial position than they think 
they are in relation to their goals. Good counselors really enjoy this aspect of 
their jobs — good news is easier and much more fun to deliver.
» Identifying strategies for reaching your financial goals: Your mind may be 
a jumble of various plans, ideas, and concerns. A good planner can help you 
sort out your thoughts and propose alternative strategies for you to consider 
as you work to accomplish your financial goals.
» Setting priorities: You may be considering doing dozens of things to improve 
your financial situation, but making just a few key changes is likely to have the 
greatest value. Identifying the changes that fit your overall situation and that 
won’t keep you awake at night is equally important. Good planners help you 
prioritize.
» Saving research time and hassle: Even if you know which major financial 
decisions are most important to you, doing the research needed to make 
them can be time-consuming and frustrating if you don’t know where to turn 
for good information and advice. A good planner will have done research to 
match the needs of people like you to the best available strategies and 
products. A good advisor can prevent you from making a bad decision based 
on poor or insufficient information.
» Purchasing commission-free financial products: When you hire a planner 
who charges for their time, you can easily save hundreds or thousands of 
dollars by avoiding the cost of commissions in the financial products you buy. 
Purchasing commission-free is especially valuable when you buy investments 
and insurance.
» Providing an objective voice for major decisions: When you’re trying to 
figure out when to retire, how much to spend on a home purchase, and 
where to invest your money, you’re faced with some big decisions. Getting 
swept up in the emotions of these issues can cloud your perspective. A com￾petent and sensitive advisor can help you cut through the confusion and 
provide you with sound counsel.CHAPTER 19 Working with Financial Planners 385
» Helping you to just do it: Deciding what you need to do is not enough — you 
have to actually do it. And although you can use a planner for advice and then 
make all the changes on your own, a good counselor can help you follow 
through with your plan. After all, part of the reason you hired the advisor in 
the first place may be that you’re too busy or uninterested to manage your 
finances.
» Mediating: If you have a spouse or partner, financial decisions can produce 
real fireworks. Although a financial counselor isn’t a therapist, a good one can 
be sensitive to the different needs and concerns of each party and can try to 
find middle ground on the financial issues you’re grappling with.
» Making you money and allowing you peace of mind: The whole point of 
professional financial planning is to help you make the most of your money 
and plan for and attain your financial and personal goals. In the process, the 
financial planner should show you how to enhance your investment returns; 
reduce your spending, taxes, and insurance costs; increase your savings; 
improve your catastrophic-insurance coverage; and achieve your financial￾independence goals.
Why advisors aren’t for everyone
Finding a good financial planner isn’t easy, so make sure you want to hire an 
advisor before you venture out in search of a competent one. You should also con￾sider your personality type before you decide to hire help. My experience has been 
that some people (believe it or not) enjoy the research and number crunching. If 
this sounds like you, or if you’re not really comfortable taking advice, you may be 
better off doing your own homework and creating your own plan.
If you have a specific tax or legal matter, consider hiring a good professional who 
specializes in that specific field rather than hiring a financial planner.
Recognizing conflicts of interest
All professions have conflicts of interest. Some fields have more than others, and 
the financial-planning field is one of those fields. Knowing where some of the 
land mines are located can certainly help. Here, then, are the most common rea￾sons that planners may not have 20/20 vision when giving financial directions.
Selling and pushing products 
that pay commissions
If a financial planner isn’t charging you a fee for their time, you can rest assured 
that they’re earning commissions on the products they try to sell you and thus 386 PART 5 Where to Go for More Help
need a broker’s license. (See the section later in this chapter, “What percentage of 
your income comes from clients’ fees versus commissions?”) A person who sells 
financial products and then earns commissions from those products is a salesper￾son, not a financial planner. Financial planning done well involves taking an 
objective, holistic look at your financial situation — something brokers are neither 
trained nor financially motivated to do.
To make discerning a planner’s agenda even harder, you can’t assume that plan￾ners who charge fees for their time don’t also earn commissions selling products. 
This compensation double-dipping happens.
Selling products that provide a commission tends to skew a planner’s recommen￾dations. Products that carry commissions result in fewer of your dollars going to 
the investments and insurance you buy. Because a commission is earned only 
when a product is sold, such a product or service is inevitably more attractive in 
the planner’s eyes than other options. For example, consider the case of a planner 
who sells disability insurance that you can obtain at a lower cost through your 
employer or a group trade association (see Chapter 17). This planner may overlook 
or criticize your most attractive option (buying through your employer) and focus 
on their most attractive option — selling you a higher-cost disability policy on 
which they derive a commission.
Another danger of trusting the recommendation of a commission-based planner 
is that they may steer you toward the products that have the biggest payback for 
them. These products are among the worst for you because they siphon off even 
more of your money up front to pay the commission. They also tend to be among 
the costliest and riskiest financial products available.
“FINANCIAL PLANNING” IN BANKS
Many banks have what they call “financial representatives” and “investment specialists” 
sitting in their branches, waiting to pounce on bank customers with big balances. In 
these banks, such “financial planners” are simply brokers who are out to sell invest￾ments that pay them (and the bank) hefty sales commissions.
Customers often have no idea that these bank reps are earning commissions and that 
those commissions are being siphoned out of customers’ investment dollars. Some 
customers are mistaken (partly due to the banks’ and salespeople’s poor disclosure) 
in believing that these investments, like bank savings accounts, are FDIC-insured and 
cannot lose value.CHAPTER 19 Working with Financial Planners 387
Planners who are commission-greedy may also try to churn your investments. 
They encourage you to frequently buy and sell, attributing the need to changes in 
the economy or the companies you invested in. More trading generally means 
more commissions for the broker.
Taking a narrow view
Because of the way they earn their money, many planners are biased in favor of 
certain strategies and products. As a result, they typically don’t keep your overall 
financial needs in mind. For example, if you have a problem with accumulated 
consumer debts, some planners may never know (or care) because they’re focused 
on selling you an investment product. Likewise, a planner who sells a lot of life 
insurance tends to develop recommendations that require you to purchase it.
Not recommending saving through 
your employer’s retirement plan
Taking advantage of saving through your employer’s retirement savings plan(s) is 
generally one of your best financial options. Although this method of saving may 
not be as exciting as risking your money in cattle futures or real estate in Dubai, 
it’s not as dull as watching paint dry — and most important, it’s typically tax￾deductible. Some planners are reluctant to recommend taking full advantage of 
this option: It takes money away for them to manage on a fee basis and/or sell you 
commission-laden investment products.
Ignoring debts
Sometimes paying off outstanding loans  — such as credit-card, auto, or even 
mortgage debts — is your best investment option. But most financial planners 
don’t recommend this strategy because paying down debts depletes the capital 
with which you can otherwise buy investments — the investments that the broker 
may be trying to sell you to earn a commission or that the advisor would like to 
manage for an ongoing fee.
Not recommending real-estate and 
small-business investments
Investing in real estate and small business, like paying off debts, takes money 
away from your investing elsewhere. Most planners won’t help with these choices. 
They may even tell you tales of real-estate and small-business investing disasters 
to dissuade you.388 PART 5 Where to Go for More Help
The value of real estate can go down just like any other investment. But over the 
long haul, owning real estate makes good financial sense for most people. With 
small business, the risks are higher, but so are the potential returns. Don’t let a 
financial planner convince you that these options are foolish — in fact, if you do 
your homework and know what you’re doing, you can make higher rates of return 
investing in real estate and small business than you can in traditional securities 
such as stocks and bonds.
That said, certain real-estate and small-business investments can be risky, inef￾ficient, and illiquid — so caution by an advisor informed in these fields (and who 
is objective) may be helpful. See Part 3 to read more about your real-estate and 
small-business investment options.
Selling ongoing money-management services
The vast majority of financial advisors who don’t work on commission make their 
money by managing your money for an ongoing fee percentage (typically 1 percent 
of your investment annually). Although this fee removes the incentive to churn
your account (frequently trade your investments) to run up more commissions, 
the service is something that you’re unlikely to need. (As I explain in Part 3, you 
can hire professional money managers for less.)
An ongoing fee percentage still creates a conflict of interest: The financial advisor 
may tend to steer you away from beneficial financial strategies that reduce the 
asset pool from which their percentage is derived. Financial strategies such as 
maximizing contributions to your employer’s retirement savings plan, paying off 
debts like your mortgage, investing in real estate or small business, and so on may 
make the most sense for you. Advisors who work on a percentage-of-assets￾under-management basis may be biased against such strategies.
Selling legal services
Some planners are in the business of drawing up trusts and providing other 
estate-planning services for their clients. Although these and other legal docu￾ments may be right for you, legal matters are complex enough that the compe￾tence of someone who isn’t a full-time legal specialist should be carefully 
scrutinized. And lower-cost options may be available if your situation is not 
complicated.
If you need help determining whether you need these legal documents, do some 
additional reading or consult an advisor who won’t actually perform the work. If 
you do ultimately hire someone to perform estate-planning services for you, 
make sure you hire someone who specializes in estate planning and works at it 
full time. See Chapter 18 to find out more about estate planning.CHAPTER 19 Working with Financial Planners 389
Scaring you unnecessarily
Some planners put together nifty computer-generated projections that show you 
that you’re going to need millions of dollars to retire or that college will cost hun￾dreds of thousands of dollars by the time your 2-year-old is ready to enroll.
Waking up a client to the realities of their financial situation is an important and 
difficult job for good financial advisors. But some planners take this task to an 
extreme, deliberately scaring you into buying what they’re selling. They paint a 
bleak picture and imply that you can fix your problems only if you do what they 
say. Don’t let them scare you; read this book and get your financial life in order.
Creating dependency
Many financial planners create dependency by making things seem so compli￾cated that their clients feel as though they could never manage their finances on 
their own. If your advisor is reluctant to tell you how you can educate yourself 
about personal money management, you probably have a self-perpetuating con￾sultant. Financial planning is hardly the only occupation guilty of this. As author 
George Bernard Shaw said, “All professions are conspiracies against the laity.”
Finding a Good Financial Planner
Locating a good financial planner who is willing to work with the not-yet-rich￾and-famous and who doesn’t have conflicts of interest can feel like trying to find 
a needle in a haystack. Personal referrals and associations are two methods that 
can serve as good starting points.
Soliciting personal referrals
Getting a personal referral from a satisfied customer you trust is one of the best 
ways to find a good financial planner. Obtaining a referral from an accountant or 
attorney whose judgment you’ve tested can help as well. (Beware that such pro￾fessionals in other fields may also do some financial planning and recommend 
themselves.)
The best financial planners continue to build their practices through word of 
mouth. Satisfied customers are a professional’s best and least costly marketers. 
However, you should never take a recommendation from anyone as gospel. I don’t 
care who is making the referral — even if it’s your mother or boss. You must do 
your homework. Ask the planner the questions I list in the upcoming section 
“Interviewing Financial Advisors: Asking the Right Questions.” I’ve seen people 390 PART 5 Where to Go for More Help
get into real trouble because of blindly accepting someone else’s recommendation. 
Remember that the person making the recommendation is (probably) not a finan￾cial expert and may be financially clueless.
You may get referred to a planner or broker who returns the favor by sending 
business to the tax, legal, or real-estate person who referred you. Hire profes￾sionals who make referrals to others based on their competence and ethics.
Seeking advisors through associations
Associations of financial planners are more than happy to refer you to planners in 
your area. But as I discuss earlier in this chapter, the major trade associations are 
composed of planners who sell products and work on commission.
Here are two solid places to start searching for good financial planners:
» National Association of Personal Financial Advisors: NAPFA (phone 
888-333-6659; website www.napfa.org) is made up of fee-only planners. Its 
members are not supposed to earn commissions from products they sell or 
recommend. However, most planners in this association earn their living by 
providing money-management services and charging a fee that is a percent￾age of assets under management. And most have minimums, which can put 
them out of reach of the majority of people.
» Association of International Certified Professional Accountants: AICPA 
(phone 888-777-7077; website www.aicpa.org) is the professional association 
of CPAs, and it can provide names of members who have completed the 
Institute’s Personal Financial Specialist (PFS) program. (From the home page, 
click on the “For the Public” tab and then the “Personal Financial Specialists” 
link under the “Find A CPA” tab.) Many of the CPAs who have completed the 
PFS program provide financial advice on a fee basis. Competent CPAs have 
the advantage of understanding the tax consequences of different choices, 
which are important components of any financial plan. On the other hand, it 
can be hard for a professional to keep current in two broad fields.
Interviewing Financial Advisors: 
Asking the Right Questions
Don’t consider hiring a financial advisor until you read all of this book. If you’re 
not educated about personal finance, how can you possibly evaluate the compe￾tence of someone you may hire to help you make important financial decisions?CHAPTER 19 Working with Financial Planners 391
I firmly believe that you are your own best financial advisor. However, I know that 
some people don’t want to make financial decisions without getting assistance. 
Perhaps you’re busy or simply can’t stand making money decisions. You need to 
recognize that you have a lot at stake when you hire a financial advisor. Besides 
the cost of their services, which generally don’t come cheap, you’re placing a lot 
of trust in their recommendations. The more you know, the better the advisor you 
can hire and the fewer services you need to buy.
The following questions will help you get to the core of an advisor’s competence 
and professional integrity. Get answers to these questions before you decide to hire 
a financial advisor.
What percentage of your income comes 
from clients’ fees versus commissions?
Asking this question first may save you the trouble and time of asking the next 
nine questions. The right answer is “100 percent of my income comes from fees 
paid by clients.” Anything less than 100 percent means that the person you’re 
speaking to is a salesperson with a vested interest in recommending certain strat￾egies and products.
Sadly, more than a few financial advisors don’t tell the truth. In one undercover 
investigation, about one-third of self-proclaimed fee-only advisors turned out to 
be brokers who also sold investment and insurance products on a commission 
basis.
How can you ferret these people out? Advisors who provide investment advice and 
oversee at least $100 million must register with the U.S. Securities and Exchange 
Commission (SEC); otherwise, they generally must register with the state that 
they make their principal place of business. They must file Form ADV, otherwise 
known as the Uniform Application for Investment Adviser Registration. This 
lengthy document asks for the following specific information from investment 
advisors:
» A breakdown of where their income comes from
» Relationships and affiliations with other companies
» Education and employment history
» The types of securities the advisory firm recommends
» The advisor’s fee schedule392 PART 5 Where to Go for More Help
In short, Form ADV provides — in black and white — answers to all the essential 
questions. With a sales pitch over the phone or marketing materials sent in the 
mail, a planner is much more likely to gloss over or avoid certain issues. Although 
some advisors fib on Form ADV, most advisors are more truthful on this form than 
they are in their own marketing. You can ask the advisor to send you a copy of 
Form ADV. You can also find out whether the advisor is registered or has a track 
record of problems by calling the SEC at 800-732-0330 or by visiting its website 
at www.adviserinfo.sec.gov.
Many states require the registration of financial advisors, so you should also con￾tact the department that oversees advisors in your state. Visit the North American 
Securities Administrators Association’s website (www.nasaa.org) and click on the 
“Contact Your Regulator” link on the home page.
What portion of client fees is for money 
management versus hourly planning?
The answer to how the advisor is paid fees provides clues as to whether they have 
an agenda to persuade you to hire them to manage your money. If you want objec￾tive and specific financial planning recommendations, give preference to advisors 
who derive their income from hourly fees. Many counselors and advisors call 
themselves “fee-based,” which usually means that they make their living man￾aging money for a percentage of assets managed.
If you want a money manager, you can hire the best quite inexpensively through 
a mutual fund. Or, if you have substantial assets, you can hire an established 
money manager (refer to Chapter 11).
What is your hourly fee?
The rates for financial advisors range from about $100 per hour up to several hun￾dred dollars per hour. If you shop around, expect to pay more for advisors located 
in high-cost-of-living areas. As you compare planners, remember that what 
matters is the total cost that you can expect to pay for the services you’re seeking.
Do you also perform tax or legal services?
Be wary of someone who claims to be an expert beyond one area. The tax, legal, 
and financial fields are vast in and of themselves, and they’re difficult for even the 
best and brightest advisor to cover well simultaneously.CHAPTER 19 Working with Financial Planners 393
One exception is the accountant who also performs some basic financial planning 
by the hour. Likewise, a good financial advisor should have a solid grounding in 
the basic tax and legal issues that relate to your personal finances. Large firms 
may have specialists available in different areas.
What work and educational experience 
qualifies you to be a financial planner?
This question doesn’t have one right answer. Ideally, a planner should have expe￾rience in the business or financial services field. Some say to look for planners 
with at least five or ten years of experience. I’ve always wondered how planners 
earn a living their first five or ten years if folks won’t hire them until they reach 
these benchmarks! A planner should also be good with numbers, speak in plain 
English, and have good interpersonal skills.
Education is sort of like food. Too little leaves you hungry. Too much can leave you 
feeling stuffed and uncomfortable. And a small amount of high quality is better 
than a lot of low quality.
Because investment decisions are a critical part of financial planning, take note of 
the fact that the most-common designations of educational training among pro￾fessional money managers are MBA (master of business administration) and CFA 
(chartered financial analyst). And some tax advisors who work on an hourly basis 
have the PFS (personal financial specialist) credential. The CFP (certified financial 
planner) credential is also popular among those with general financial training.
Do you carry liability (errors 
and omissions) insurance?
Some counselors may be surprised by this question or think that you’re a problem 
customer looking for a lawsuit. On the other hand, accidents happen; that’s why 
insurance exists. So if the planner doesn’t have liability insurance, they’ve missed 
one of the fundamental concepts of planning: Insure against risk. Don’t make the 
mistake of hiring them.
You wouldn’t (and shouldn’t) let contractors into your home to do work without 
knowing that they have insurance to cover any mistakes they make. Likewise, you 
should insist on hiring a planner who carries protection in case they make a major 
mistake for which they are liable. Make sure that they carry enough coverage 
given what they are helping you with.394 PART 5 Where to Go for More Help
Can you provide references from clients 
with needs similar to mine?
Take the time to talk to other people who have used the planner. Ask what the 
planner did for them and find out what the advisor’s greatest strengths and weak￾nesses are. You can find out a bit about the planner’s track record and style. And 
because you want to have as productive a relationship as possible with your plan￾ner, the more you find out about them, the easier it’ll be for you to hit the ground 
running if you hire them.
Some financial advisors offer a “complimentary” introductory consultation. If an 
advisor offers a free consultation to allow you to check them out and it makes you 
feel more comfortable about hiring them, fair enough. But be careful: Most free 
consultations end up being a sales pitch for certain products or services the advi￾sor offers.
The fact that a planner doesn’t offer a free consultation may be a good sign. Coun￾selors who are busy and who work strictly by the hour can’t afford to burn an hour 
of their time for an in-person free session. They also need to be careful of folks 
seeking free advice. Such advisors usually are willing to spend some time on the 
phone answering background questions. They should also be able to send back￾ground materials by mail and provide references.
Will you provide specific strategies 
and product recommendations that 
I can implement on my own if I choose?
This is an important question. Some advisors may indicate that you can hire them 
by the hour. But then they provide only generic advice without specifics. Some 
planners even double-dip — they charge an hourly fee initially to make you feel 
like you’re not working with a salesperson, and then they try selling commission￾based products. Also be aware of advisors who say that you can choose to imple￾ment their recommendations on your own and then recommend financial products 
that carry commissions.
How is implementation handled?
Ideally, you should find an advisor who lets you choose whether you want to hire 
them to help with implementation after the recommendations have been pre￾sented to you. If you know that you’re going to follow through on the advice and 
you can do so without further discussions and questions, don’t hire the planner to 
help you implement their recommendations.CHAPTER 19 Working with Financial Planners 395
On the other hand, if you hire a counselor because you lack the time, desire, and/
or expertise to manage your financial life in the first place, building implementa￾tion into the planning work makes good sense.
Learning from Others’ Mistakes
Over the many years that I’ve worked as a financial counselor, and now fielding 
questions from readers, I hear too many problems that people encounter from 
hiring incompetent and unethical financial advisors. To avoid repeating others’ 
mistakes, please remember the following:
» You absolutely must do your homework before hiring any financial 
advisor. Despite recommendations from others about a particular advisor, 
you can end up with bad advice from biased advisors.
» Avoid or minimize conflicts of interest. The financial planning and broker￾age fields are minefields for consumers. The fundamental problem is the 
enormous conflict of interest that is created when “advisors” sell products that 
earn them sales commissions. Selling ongoing money-management services 
creates a conflict of interest as well.
» You are your own best advocate. The more you know, and the more you 
understand that investing and other financial decisions needn’t be compli￾cated, the more you realize that you don’t need to spend gobs of money (or 
any money at all) on financial planners and advisors. When you look in the 
mirror, you see the person who has your best interests at heart and is your 
best financial advisor.CHAPTER 20 Using Technology to Manage Your Money 397
Chapter 20
Using Technology to 
Manage Your Money
Although a computer and, to a lesser extent, a smartphone may assist you 
with your personal finances, they simply represent a couple of many tools. 
Computers are best for performing tasks such as performing many calcu￾lations in a spreadsheet quickly and for aiding you with research. Your smart￾phone is a good vehicle for using apps that can check on an investment balance or 
recent transaction.
This chapter gives you an overview of how to use technology, software, apps and 
cyberspace with your finances. (You may hear the term fintech, which is simply a 
shorthanded way of referring to financial technology or the integration of tech￾nology into companies in the financial services industry.) I discuss how to use this 
technology to pay your bills, focus on your spending, prepare taxes, research 
investments, plan for retirement, trade and invest, buy insurance, and plan your 
estate, and I suggest the best software, websites, and apps.
IN THIS CHAPTER
» Evaluating personal finance software, 
apps, and websites
» Performing financial tasks via 
technology398 PART 5 Where to Go for More Help
Surveying Software, Apps, and Websites
You can access major repositories of personal finance information through your 
computer. Although the lines are blurring among these categories, they’re roughly 
defined as software, apps, and the internet:
» Software refers to computer programs that are available to be downloaded 
online. Most of the mass-marketed financial software packages sell for under 
$100. If you’ve ever used a word-processing program such as Microsoft Word 
or a spreadsheet program such as Microsoft Excel, then you’ve used software.
» Apps, which you download onto a smartphone or tablet, are kind of like 
software. They run on your phone and tend to be less costly (albeit generally 
less sophisticated) than computer software.
» The internet refers to sites that provide information and services to help you 
manage your financial life, including online bill paying. Most of the financial 
stuff on the internet is supplied by companies marketing their wares and, 
hence, is available for free. Some sites sell their content for a fee.
Adding up financial software benefits
Although the number of personal-finance software packages, apps, and websites 
is large and growing, quality is lagging behind quantity, especially among the free 
internet sites. The best software programs can
» Guide you to better organization and management of your personal finances
» Help you complete mundane tasks or complex calculations quickly and easily 
and provide basic advice in unfamiliar territory
» Make you feel in control of your financial life
Mediocre and bad software, on the other hand, can make you feel stupid or, at the 
very least, make you want to scream. Lousy packages usually end up in the soft￾ware graveyard.
Having reviewed many of the packages available, I can assure you that if you’re 
having a hard time with some of the programs out there (and sometimes even 
with the more useful programs), you’re not at fault. Too many packages assume 
that you already know things such as your tax rate, your mortgage options, and 
the difference between stock and bond mutual funds. Some of what’s out there is 
too technically oriented and isn’t user-friendly, and in the worst cases, even 
financially flawed.CHAPTER 20 Using Technology to Manage Your Money 399
A good software package, like a good tax or financial advisor, helps you better 
manage your finances. It simply and concisely explains financial terminology, and 
it helps you make decisions by offering choices and recommendations, allowing 
you to “play” with alternatives before following a particular course of action. 
Later in this chapter, I recommend some of my favorite financial software.
Understanding how apps can benefit 
and harm your bottom line
At the risk of starting with the basics, apps are to smartphones what software 
is  to personal computers. As people spend more time on smartphones, more 
applications — known as apps — are being developed to run on phones.
Large companies offer most apps as another option for their customers to be in 
touch with and interact with what they offer. The financial institutions that you 
do business with  — banks, mutual-fund companies, brokerage firms, and so 
on — are common examples. Here’s what to be aware of to be able to get the most 
out of apps without suffering harm:
» Use apps to solve problems and perform financial tasks more efficiently.
You can use apps to do an increasing number of tasks that previously needed 
to be done online and through a regular computer. The dizzying pace of 
technological change continues as many smartphones function as minicom￾puters in your hand. The best apps can help you to solve common challenges 
such as getting better value when shopping for a specific product or service, 
tracking where you’re spending money, checking your banking account 
balance, doing basic investment research, and so forth. Although some apps 
are provided free of charge by companies that are seeking to promote their 
own services, others charge modest fees (like a software company) does 
because the app is all they’re “selling.”
» Beware the downside to “free” apps. Although they haven’t gotten the 
attention that computer viruses, computer malware, and computer ransom￾ware attacks have garnered, similar problems have arisen with smartphone 
apps. Some will end up tracking and spying on you. The worst are scams and/
or some sort of virus or malware. In addition to those issues, make sure you 
check out the background and agenda of any company offering a financial 
app and how it may be making money from the app. The worst apps are 
nothing more than glorified advertising from the company behind the app. 
Sure, they may dangle something seemingly helpful (for example, offering a 
free credit score, stock quotes, and so on), but be sure you uncover what their 
agenda and reputation ultimately are. Many free credit score apps, for 
example, make money from affiliate fees from credit cards they pitch you.400 PART 5 Where to Go for More Help
» Use apps only from legitimate companies with lengthy track records.
You’ll notice that most of the companies recommended in this chapter are 
fairly large companies with lengthy track records of success. For sure, 
technology is disrupting and changing many industries and companies, but 
that doesn’t mean that you should only do business with firms that exist solely 
online, in the cloud, and so on. Research the history of companies with which 
you’re considering doing business. When seeking the link for a mobile app, get 
that link and download the app from the company’s website so you’re sure 
you are getting the actual app rather than a knock-off or a fraudulent one. Do 
your homework and research an app before downloading and beginning to 
use it. Check with more than one independent source and read independent 
reviews, especially those that are critical and less than flattering. And stay far 
away from apps that claim that they can show you how to make big bucks 
doing little from the comfort of your own home.
» Consider the alternatives to an app. Before downloading and using an app, 
question the need for it and consider the alternatives. Remember that the 
company behind the app wants to tie you to it so you’ll buy more and spend 
more with them. Is that your goal? You likely have your phone with you all the 
time. Do you really want this app running and in your face all the time? 
Maybe, maybe not — think about it and examine the alternatives.
Surfing hazards online
Like the information you receive from any medium, you have to sift out the good 
from the bad when you surf the internet. Those who navigate the internet and 
naively think that what’s out there is useful “information,” “research,” or “objec￾tive advice,” are in for a rude awakening.
Most personal finance sites on the internet are free, which  — guess what  — 
means that these sites are basically advertising or are dominated and driven by 
advertising. If you’re looking for material written by unbiased experts or writers, 
finding it on the web may seem like searching for the proverbial needle in the 
haystack because the vast majority of what’s online is biased and uninformed.
Considering the source so you can recognize bias
A report on the internet published by a leading investment-banking firm provides 
a list of the “coolest finance” sites. On the list is the website of a major bank. 
Because it has been a long time since I was in junior high school, I’m not quite 
sure what “cool” means anymore. If cool can be used to describe a well-organized 
and graphically pleasing website, then I guess I can say that the bank’s site is cool.CHAPTER 20 Using Technology to Manage Your Money 401
However, if you’re looking for sound information and advice, then the bank’s site 
is decidedly “uncool.” It steers you in a financial direction that benefits (not sur￾prisingly) the bank and not you. For example, in the real-estate section, users are 
asked to plug in their gross monthly income and down payment. The information 
is then used to spit out the supposed amount that users can “afford” to spend on 
a home. No mention is given to the other financial goals and concerns — such as 
saving for retirement — that affect one’s ability to spend a particular amount of 
money on a home.
Consider this advice in the lending area of the site: “When you don’t have the cash 
on hand for important purchases, we can help you borrow what you need. From a 
new car to that vacation you’ve been longing for, to new kitchen appliances, you 
can make these dreams real now.” Click on a button at the bottom of this screen — 
and presto, you’re on your way to racking up credit-card and auto debt. Why 
bother practicing delayed gratification, living within your means, or buying some￾thing used if getting a loan is “easy” and comes with “special privileges”?
Watching out for “sponsored” content
Sponsored content, a euphemism for advertising under the guise of editorial con￾tent (known in the print media as advertorials), is another big problem to watch 
out for on websites. You may find a disclaimer or note, which is often buried in 
small print in an obscure part of the website, saying that an article is sponsored 
by (in other words, paid advertising by) the “author.”
A mutual-fund “education” site, for example, states that its “primary purpose is 
to provide viewers with an independent guide that contains information and arti￾cles they can’t get anywhere else.” The content of the site suggests otherwise. In 
the “Expert’s Corner” section of the site, material is reprinted from a newsletter 
that advocates frequent trading in and out of mutual funds to try and guess and 
time market moves. Turns out that the article is “sponsored by the featured 
expert”: In other words, it’s a paid advertisement. (The track record of the news￾letter’s past recommendations, which isn’t discussed on the site, is poor.)
Even more troubling are the many websites that fail to disclose (even cryptically) 
that their “content” comes from advertisers, and those that do often do so in far 
too small print buried at the bottom of a web page. Mind you, I’m not saying that 
disclosure makes paid-for content okay — I’m simply stating that a lack of dis￾closure makes an already bad situation even worse.
Also, beware of websites, especially those that are “free,” that are making money 
in a clandestine way from two sources: companies whose products they praise and 
affiliates to whom they direct mouse clicks/web traffic. In perusing the web, I 
noticed, for example, that many “free” financial websites were singing the praises 402 PART 5 Where to Go for More Help
of some budgeting software. I test-drove the product (which is like a slimmed￾down version of Quicken, and it was a decent but not exceptional product. My 
research uncovered the fact that the makers of this software paid a whopping 
35-percent commission to website affiliates who pitched and directed users to buy 
the product. With the software selling for $60, a website flogging it for them 
pockets $21 for each copy it sells. Does that taint a site’s recommendation of the 
software? Of course it does.
Increasingly, companies are paying websites outright to simply mention and 
praise their products; doing so is incredibly sleazy even if it’s disclosed, but to do 
so without disclosure is unethical. Also, beware of links to recommended product 
and service providers to do business with — more often than not, the referring 
website gets paid an affiliate fee. Look for sites that post policies against receiving 
such referral fees from companies whose products and services they recommend. 
(As an example, see the disclosure I use on my own site, www.erictyson.com.)
Steering clear of biased financial-planning advice
I also suggest skipping the financial-planning advice offered by financial service 
companies that are out to sell you something. Such companies can’t take the nec￾essary objective, holistic view required to render useful advice.
For example, on one major investment company’s website, you find a good deal of 
material on the firm’s mutual funds. The site’s college-planning advice is off the 
mark because it urges parents to put money in a custodial account in the child’s 
name. Ignored is the fact that doing so will undermine your child’s ability to qual￾ify for financial aid (see Chapter 14), that your child will have control of the money 
at either age 18 or 21 depending upon your state, and that you’re likely better off 
funding your employer’s retirement plan. If you did that, though, you couldn’t set 
up a college savings-plan account at the investment company.
Shunning short-term thinking
Many financial websites provide real-time stock quotes as a hook to a site that is 
cluttered with advertising. My experience working with individual investors is 
that the more short-term they think, the worse they do. And checking your port￾folio during the trading day certainly promotes short-term thinking.
Another way that sites create an addictive environment for you to return to mul￾tiple times daily is to constantly provide news and other rapidly changing content. 
Do you really need “Breaking News” updates that gasoline prices jumped 19 cents 
per gallon over the past two weeks or that yet another social media personality is 
having a contest with a Hollywood celebrity to see who can sign up more Twitter 
followers in the next week?CHAPTER 20 Using Technology to Manage Your Money 403
Also, beware of tips offered around the electronic water cooler — comment sec￾tions. As in the real world, chatting with strangers and exchanging ideas are 
sometimes fine. However, if you don’t know the identity and competence of com￾menters, why would you follow their financial advice or stock tips? Getting ideas 
from various sources is okay, but educate yourself and do your homework before 
making personal financial decisions.
If you want to best manage your personal finances and find out more, remember 
that the old expression “You get what you pay for” contains a grain of truth. Free 
information on the internet, especially information provided by companies in the 
financial services industry, is largely self-serving. Stick with information provid￾ers who have proven themselves offline or who don’t have anything to sell except 
objective information and advice.
Accomplishing Money Tasks on Your 
Computer, Tablet, or Smartphone
In the remainder of this chapter, I detail important personal financial tasks that 
your computer or smartphone can assist you with. I also provide my recommen￾dations for the best software, apps, and websites to help you accomplish these 
chores.
Paying your bills, finding ways to save, 
and tracking your money
Plenty of folks have trouble saving money and reducing their spending. Thus, it’s 
no surprise that in the increasingly crowded universe of free websites, plenty are 
devoted to supposedly helping you to reduce your spending. Years ago numerous 
such websites kept springing up, and then there was a shakeout. Mint and Wally 
are a couple of long-term survivors.
I’ve kicked the tires and checked out these sites and have some concerns about 
them. The biggest problems I have with these sites are that they’re loaded with 
advertising and/or have affiliate relationships with companies. What does this 
mean? The site gets paid if you click on a link to one of its recommended service 
providers and buy what it’s selling.
This, of course, creates an enormous conflict of interest and thoroughly taints any 
recommendation made by such sites that profit from affiliate referrals. For start￾ers, they have no incentive or reason to recommend companies that won’t pay 404 PART 5 Where to Go for More Help
them an affiliate fee. And there’s little — if any — screening of companies for 
quality service levels that are important to you as a consumer.
Also, be forewarned that after registering you as a site user, the first thing most 
of these sites want you to do is connect directly to your financial institutions 
(banks, brokerages, investment companies) and download your personal invest￾ment account and spending data. If your instincts tell you this may not be a good 
idea, you should trust your instincts. Yes, there are security concerns, but those 
pale in comparison to privacy concerns and concerns about the endless pitching to 
you of products and services.
Another problem that I have with these websites is the simplistic calculators some 
offer. One that purported to help with retirement planning didn’t allow users to 
choose a retirement age younger than 62 and had no provisions for part-time 
work. When it asked about your assets, it made no distinction between equity in 
your home and financial assets (stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and so on).
Apps can come in handy for tracking your money. Check out the following apps:
» Goodbudget: This app is great for its simplicity and practicality. The basic 
version provides you with up to one year of expense-tracking history in ten 
main categories (envelopes). A paid or premium version ($70 per year) that 
provides up to seven years of expense tracking with unlimited categories as 
well as email support is also available. I suggest starting with the free version 
and then deciding in the future whether an upgrade is worth your while.
» GasBuddy: Some apps are simply designed to save you money. GasBuddy, 
for example, shows you the price for gasoline at various service stations in a 
local area. It’s free for consumers to use.
» Tollsmart: Especially when going on lengthy car trips, car tolls can add up 
quickly. This low-cost app enables you to compare toll costs for alternative 
routes.
» CamelCamelCamel: This app is a price tracker that scans items on Amazon, 
shows you their price history, and sends you alerts when a product you’re 
interested in drops in price. (PriceGrabber scans items everywhere online, 
although its website is much easier to use than its app.)
Quicken is a good software program that helps with expense tracking and bill pay￾ing. In addition to offering check paying and electronic bill-payment, Quicken is 
a financial organizer. The program allows you to list your investments and other 
assets, along with your loans and other financial liabilities. Quicken automates the 
process of paying your bills, and it can track your check-writing and prepare 
reports that detail your spending by category so you can find the fat in your bud￾get. (For a complete discussion on how to track your spending, see Chapter 5.)CHAPTER 20 Using Technology to Manage Your Money 405
You can avoid dealing with paper checks — written or printed — by signing up for 
online bill payment. With such services, you save on checks, stamps, and enve￾lopes. These services are available to anyone with a checking account through 
many banks, credit unions, and brokerage firms, as well as through Quicken. 
Another option is to sign up through CheckFree’s website: www.mycheckfree.com.
Planning for retirement
Good retirement-planning tools can help you plan for retirement by crunching the 
numbers for you. They can also teach you how particular changes — such as your 
investment returns, the rate of inflation, or your savings rate — can affect when 
and in what style you can retire. The biggest time-saving aspect of retirement￾planning tools is that they let you more quickly play with and see the conse￾quences of changing the assumptions.
Some of the major investment companies I profile in Part 3 of this book are sources 
for some high-quality, low-cost retirement-planning tools. Here are some good 
ones to consider:
» T. Rowe Price’s website (www.troweprice.com) has several tools, including 
its “Retirement Income Calculator,” (www.troweprice.com/usis/advice/
tools/retirement-income-calculator) that can help you determine 
where you stand in terms of reaching a given retirement goal. Expect some 
marketing of T. Rowe Price’s mutual funds with its tools.
» Vanguard’s website (www.vanguard.com) can help with figuring savings 
goals to reach retirement goals as well as with managing your budget and 
assets in retirement. See their tools and calculators at investor.vanguard.
com/tools-calculators/overview.
Preparing your taxes
Good, properly used tax-preparation software can save you time and money. 
The best programs “interview” you to gather the necessary information and select 
the appropriate forms based on your responses. Of course, you’re still the one 
responsible for locating all the information needed to complete your return. More￾experienced taxpayers can bypass the interview and jump directly to the forms 
they know they need to complete. These programs also help flag overlooked 
deductions and identify other tax-reducing strategies.
TurboTax, H&R Block Tax Software, TaxAct, and Tax Slayer are the leading tax￾preparation programs.406 PART 5 Where to Go for More Help
In addition to the federal tax packages, tax-preparation programs are available for 
state income taxes, too. Many state tax forms are fairly easy to complete because 
they’re based on information from your federal form. If your state tax forms are 
based on your federal form and simple, you may want to skip buying the state 
income-tax preparation packages and prepare your state return by hand.
If you’re mainly looking for federal income tax forms, you can get them at no 
charge through the IRS’s website (www.irs.gov).
Researching investments
Gone are the days of schlepping off to the library to look at investing reference 
manuals, buying print versions for your own use, or slogging through voice-mail 
hell when you call government agencies. Today you can access these and other 
investing resources on your computer. You can also often pay for just what 
you need:
» The SEC: The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) allows unlimited, 
free access to its documents at www.sec.gov. All public corporations, as well 
as mutual funds, file their reports with the agency. Be aware, however, that 
navigating this site takes some patience.
» Morningstar: You can access Morningstar’s individual stock and mutual-fund 
reports at www.morningstar.com. The basic reports are free, but they’re 
watered-down versions of the company’s comprehensive software and paper 
products. If you want to buy Morningstar’s unabridged fund reports online, 
you can do so for a fee.
» Vanguard: Although I’m leery of financial service company “educational” 
materials because of bias and self-serving advice, some companies do a 
worthy job on these materials. The investor-friendly, thrifty Vanguard Group 
of mutual funds and ETFs has an app and website (www.vanguard.com), 
where investors can learn the basics of fund investing. Additionally, investors 
in Vanguard’s funds can access up-to-date personal account information 
through the site.
Accessing economic and financial data
The St. Louis Fed’s Federal Reserve Economic Database — also known as FRED — 
is accessible online at fred.stlouisfed.org and through an app. Here’s a rare 
case where you can have a wealth of data on the economy and financial markets at 
your fingertips and never be bombarded with ads or plugs to buy things.CHAPTER 20 Using Technology to Manage Your Money 407
Trading online
If you do your investing homework, trading securities online may save you money 
and perhaps some time. For years, discount brokers (which I discuss in Chapter 9) 
were heralded as the low-cost source for trading.
A number of major brokerage firms have eliminated online trading fees on stock 
and exchange-traded funds. Quality firms offering “free” brokerage trades on 
stocks and ETFs include Charles Schwab, E-Trade, Fidelity, Interactive Brokers, 
T. Rowe Price, and Vanguard. These changes have reduced the attractiveness of 
online-only trading firms like Robinhood given the other high fees and sub-par 
terms offered on their accounts, services, and investments to make up for their 
free brokerage trades. Investors should always consider and evaluate the entire 
package of services when deciding on an investment firm through which to do 
business.
By eliminating the overhead of branch offices and by accepting and processing 
trades online, these online-only brokers keep their costs and brokerage charges to 
a minimum. However, some of these brokers have limited products and services. 
For example, some don’t offer many of the best mutual funds. And my own expe￾rience with reaching live people at some online brokers has been trying — I’ve 
had to wait on hold for more than ten minutes before a customer service repre￾sentative answered the call.
Although online trading may save you on transaction costs, it can also encourage 
you to trade more than you should, resulting in higher total trading costs, lower 
investment returns, and higher income-tax bills. Following investments on a 
daily basis encourages you to think short term. Remember that the best invest￾ments are bought and held for the long haul (see Part 3 for more information).
Reading and searching periodicals
Many business and financial publications are online, offering investors news and 
financial market data. The Wall Street Journal provides an online, personalized edition 
of the paper (www.wsj.com) that allows you to tailor the content to meet your spe￾cific needs. The price, currently discounted, is $104 for a 12-month subscription.
Leading business publications such as Forbes (www.forbes.com) and Businessweek
(www.bloomberg.com/businessweek) put their current magazines’ content on the 
internet. Some publications are charging for archived articles and for some cur￾rent content for nonsubscribers to their print magazine. Be careful to take what 
you read and hear in the mass media with many grains of salt (see Chapter 21 for 
more on mass media). Much of the content revolves around tweaking people’s 
anxieties and dwelling on the latest crises and fads.408 PART 5 Where to Go for More Help
My website (www.erictyson.com) includes analysis of current news and high￾lights and summarizes the best content from many sources and sites, including 
leading newsletters.
Investing through automated investment 
managers: Robo advisors
Numerous websites offer an automated investing service. These sites purport to 
help you choose an overall investment mix (asset allocation) and then divvy that 
money up, typically among exchange-traded funds. Over time, the allocations can 
be tweaked or adjusted based on some predetermined formulas.
For this largely automated service, so-called robo advisors like Betterment and 
WealthFront generally charge around 0.25 percent to 0.5 percent per year of the 
assets they are managing. I believe that you can educate yourself enough about 
investing in funds that paying an ongoing fee for such services isn’t worth it. (If 
you’re really interested in such services, Vanguard Digital Advisor has low fees 
and minimums.)
Buying life insurance
If loved ones are financially dependent on you, you probably know you need life 
insurance. But add together the dread of life-insurance salespeople and a fear of 
death, and you have a recipe for procrastination. Although your computer can’t 
stave off the Grim Reaper, it can help you find a quality, low-cost policy that can 
be more than 80 percent less costly than the most expensive options, all without 
having you deal with high-pressure sales tactics.
The best way to shop for term life insurance online is through one of the quotation 
services I discuss in Chapter 17. At each of these sites, you fill in your date of birth, 
whether you smoke, how much coverage you’d like, and for how long you’d like to 
lock in the initial premium. When you’re done filling in this information, a new 
web page pops up with a list of low-cost quotes (based on assumed good health) 
from highly rated (for financial stability) insurance companies.
Invariably, the quotes are ranked by how cheap they are. Although price is cer￾tainly an important factor, many of these services don’t do as good of a job 
explaining other important factors to consider when doing your comparison 
shopping. For example, the services sometimes don’t cover the projected and 
maximum rates after the initial term has expired. Be sure to ask about these other 
future rates before you agree to a specific policy.CHAPTER 20 Using Technology to Manage Your Money 409
If you decide to buy a policy from one of the online agencies, you can fill out an 
online application form. The quotation agency will then zap you a detailed descrip￾tion of the policy and insurer, along with your completed application. You’ll also 
have to deal with a medical technician, who will drop by your home to check on your 
health status — at least until some computer genius figures out a way for you to 
give blood and urine samples online!
Preparing legal documents
Just as you can prepare a tax return with good software, you can also prepare 
common legal documents. This type of software may save you from the often￾difficult task of finding a competent and affordable attorney.
Using legal software is generally preferable to using fill-in-the-blank documents. 
Software has the built-in virtues of directing and limiting your choices and pre￾venting you from making common mistakes. Quality software also incorporates 
the knowledge and insights of the legal eagles who developed the software. And it 
can save you money.
If your situation isn’t unusual, legal software may work well for you. As to the 
legality of documents that you create with legal software, remember that a will, 
for example, is made legal and valid by your witnesses; the fact that an attorney 
prepares the document is not what makes it legal.
An excellent package for preparing your own will is Quicken WillMaker Plus, 
which is published by Nolo Press, a name synonymous with high quality and user￾friendliness in the legal publishing world. In addition to allowing you to prepare 
wills, WillMaker can also help you prepare a living will and medical power of 
attorney document. The software also allows you to create a living trust that 
serves to keep property out of probate in the event of your death (see Chapter 18). 
Like wills, living trusts are fairly standard legal documents that you can properly 
create with the guidance of a top-notch software package. The package advises 
you to seek professional guidance for your situation, if necessary. If you establish 
a login on their website at www.nolo.com/, discounts of 25 to 30 percent on 
Quicken WillMaker Plus during special holidays will be sent to your email. On 
Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and in December, the discount is 50 percent.CHAPTER 21 Consuming Financial Content 411
Chapter 21
Consuming Financial 
Content
We have too many options for finding “financial content” — radio and 
television news, websites, social media, podcasts, books, newspapers, 
and magazines that talk about money and purport to help you get rich. 
Tuning out poor resources and focusing on the best ones are the real challenges.
Because you probably don’t consider yourself a financial expert, more often than 
not you may not know who to believe and listen to. I help you solve that problem 
in this chapter.
Observing the Mass Media
For better and for worse, America’s mass media, including social media, has a 
major influence on our culture. On the good side, news is widely disseminated 
these days. So if a product is recalled or a dangerous virus breaks out in your area, 
IN THIS CHAPTER

social media, and pundits on 
investors

podcast, and television investing 
coverage

magazines
» Finding the best investing books412 PART 5 Where to Go for More Help
you’ll probably hear about it, perhaps more than you want to, through the media 
or from tuned-in family members! The downsides of the mass media and social 
media are plenty, though.
Alarming or informing?
The media loves a good crisis. During the “financial crisis” of 2008–2009, we 
heard over and over and over again how it was the worst economy and worst eco￾nomic crisis since the Great Depression. Endless parallels were drawn between the 
Great Depression of the 1930s and the then slumping economy.
For sure, we suffered a significant recession (economic downturn). But some in 
the news media (and pundit class) went overboard in suggesting we were in the 
midst of another depression. During the Great Depression of the 1930s, the unem￾ployment rate hit 25 percent and remained in double digits for years on end. Half 
of all homes ended up in foreclosure during that period. Although job losses and 
home foreclosures mounted during the 2008–2009 recession, they were nowhere 
near the Great Depression levels. The recessions of the late 1970s and early 1980s 
were actually worse because of the pain and hardship caused by the 10+ percent 
inflation rate and interest rates of that period. The unemployment rate was also 
above 10 percent in the early 1980s recession.
The U.S. stock market suffered a steep decline during the 2008 financial crisis and 
recession, and in fact, the percentage decline in the widely followed Dow Jones 
Industrial Average was the worst since the 1930s. Interestingly, the severity of the 
2008–2009 stock market decline was likely exacerbated by all the talk and fear of 
another depression. Various research polls taken during late 2008 found that 
more than 6  in 10 Americans believed we were about to enter another Great 
Depression. Those who panicked and bailed out when the Dow sagged below 
6,500 in early 2009 learned another hard lesson when the market surged back, as 
it always inevitably does after a significant sell-off. (To date, the Dow has approx￾imately risen more than five-fold in value since that market bottom in ’09).
Some news producers, in their quest for ratings and advertising dollars, try to be 
alarming to keep you tuned in and coming back for their “breaking news” updates. 
The more you watch, the more unnerved you get over short-term, especially neg￾ative, events.
Teaching questionable values
Daily doses of American mass media and social media, including all the advertis￾ing that comes with them, essentially communicate the following messages:CHAPTER 21 Consuming Financial Content 413
» Your worth as a person is directly related to your physical appearance 
(including the quality of clothing and jewelry you wear) and your material 
possessions — cars, homes, electronics, and other gadgets.
» The more money you make, the more “successful” you clearly are.
» The more famous you are (especially as a movie or sports star), the more 
you’re worth listening to and admiring.
» Don’t bother concerning yourself with the consequences before engaging in 
negative behavior.
» Delaying gratification and making sacrifices are for boring losers.
Continually inundating yourself with poor messages can cause you to behave in a 
way that undermines your long-term happiness and financial success. Don’t sup￾port (by watching, listening to, or reading) forms of media that don’t reflect your 
values and morals.
Worshipping prognosticating pundits
Quoting and interviewing “experts” are perhaps the only things that the media 
loves more than hyping short-term news events. What’s the economy going to do 
next quarter? What stocks will rise and which will fall next month? What’s the 
stock market going to do in the next few hours? No, I’m not kidding about that 
last one — the stock market cable channel CNBC interviews floor traders from the 
New York Stock Exchange during the trading day to get their opinions about what 
the market will do in the hours just before closing!
Prognosticating pundits keep many people tuned in because their advice is con￾stantly changing (and is therefore entertaining and anxiety-producing), and they 
lead investors to believe that investments can be maneuvered in advance to outfox 
future financial market moves. Common sense suggests, though, that no one has 
a working crystal ball, and if they did, they certainly wouldn’t share such insights 
with the mass media for free. (For more on experts who purport to predict the 
future, see Chapter 9.)
Navigating social media
In recent decades, social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, 
Reddit, TikTok, Twitter, and YouTube have roared onto the scene. Fans of some of 
these platforms point to the interactivity, timeliness, and wide range of content as 
attractions. Critics point to the addictiveness, lack of editorial oversight, and 
biases as drawbacks.414 PART 5 Where to Go for More Help
Social media platforms and blogs have been a tremendous source for misleading 
hype and outright fraud. For example, scores of self-anointed stock-picking gurus 
claim ridiculously hyped and bogus returns, and unfortunately, many of them 
evade regulatory scrutiny or punishment. I’ve been quite disappointed by the 
large volume of obvious hype online, especially on social media platforms.
Here are some commonalities I’ve observed over time among stock-picking touts 
online you should sidestep and avoid:
» They rarely or never post their suggested stock trades in advance. They tell 
you after the fact about stocks they claim to have previously bought.
» They report their own calculated super high returns and don’t have an outside 
or independent audit to substantiate their high and inflated claims.
» They delete postings that make them look bad.
A lot of money is sloshing around out there, and there are so many venues and 
ways in which hucksters and criminals will try to separate you from your money. 
Simply put, you should always be extremely careful listening to any recommenda￾tions or advice, especially when it’s coming from a source you don’t know well in 
terms of their expertise, conflicts of interest, and what they are implicitly or 
explicitly seeking to sell you.
Rating Radio, Podcasts, and Television 
Financial Programs
Over the years, money issues have received increased coverage through the major 
media of television, radio, and podcasts. Some topics gain more coverage on radio, 
podcasts, and TV because they help draw more advertising dollars (which follow 
what people are watching). When you tune into such programming, you generally 
don’t pay a fee to tune in to a particular channel (with pay cable channels, stream￾ing services, and satellite radio being exceptions). Advertising doesn’t necessarily 
prevent a medium from delivering coverage that is objective and in your best 
interests, but it sure doesn’t help foster this type of coverage either.
For example, can you imagine a financial radio or TV correspondent saying the 
following?CHAPTER 21 Consuming Financial Content 415
“We’ve decided to stop providing financial market updates every five minutes because 
we’ve found it causes some investors to become addicted to tracking the short-term 
movements in the markets and to lose sight of the bigger picture. We don’t want to 
encourage people to make knee-jerk reactions to short-term events.”
Sound-bite-itis is another problem with much of the mass media. Producers and 
network executives believe that if you go into too much detail, viewers and listen￾ers will change the channel.
Finding the Best Websites
Yes, the internet has changed the world, but certainly not always for the better 
and not always in such a big way. Consider the way we shop. You can buy things 
online that you couldn’t in the past. Purchasing items online broadens the ave￾nues through which you can spend money. I see a big downside here: Overspend￾ing is easier to do when you surf the internet a lot.
Some of the best websites allow you to more efficiently access information that 
may help you make important investing decisions. However, this doesn’t mean 
that your computer allows you to compete at the same level as professional money 
managers. The best pros work at their craft full-time and have far more expertise 
and experience than the rest of us. Some nonprofessionals have been fooled into 
believing that investing online makes them better investors. My experience has 
been that people who spend time online daily dealing with investments tend to 
trade and react more to short-term events and have a harder time keeping the 
bigger picture and their long-term goals and needs in focus.
If you know where to look, you can more easily access some types of information. 
However, you often find a lot of garbage online — just as you do on other advertiser￾dominated media like TV and radio. In Chapter 20, I explain how to safely navigate 
online to find the best of what’s out there.
Navigating Newspapers and Magazines
Compared with radio and TV, print publications (many of which have migrated 
online) generally offer lengthier discussions of topics. And in the more financially 
focused publications, the editors who work on articles generally have more back￾ground in the topics they write about. Even within the better publications, I find a 416 PART 5 Where to Go for More Help
wide variety of quality. So don’t instantly believe what you read, even if you read 
a piece in a publication you like. Here’s how to get the most from financial 
publications:
» Read some back issues. Go to your local library (or visit the publication’s 
website) and peruse some issues that are at least one to two years old. 
Although reading old issues may seem silly and pointless, it actually can be 
enlightening. You can begin to get a taste of a publication’s style, priorities, 
and philosophies as well as how its prior advice has worked out.
» Look for solid information and perspective. Headlines reveal a lot about 
how a publication perceives its role. Publications with cover stories such as 
“10 hot stocks to buy now!” and “Funds that will double your money in the 
next three years!” are probably best avoided. Look for articles that seek to 
educate with accuracy, not make predictions.
» Note bylines. As you read a given publication over time, you should begin to 
make note of the different writers. After you get to know who the better 
writers are, you can skip over the ones you don’t care for and spend your 
limited free time reading the best.
» Don’t react without planning. Here’s a common example of how not to use 
information and advice you glean from publications: I had a client who had 
some cash he wanted to invest. He would read an article about investing in 
real-estate investment trusts and then go out the next week and buy several 
of them. Then he’d see a mention of some technology stock funds and invest 
in some of those. Eventually, his portfolio was a mess of investments that 
reflected the history of what he had read rather than an orchestrated, 
well-thought-out investment portfolio.
Betting on Books
Reading a good book is one of my favorite ways to get a crash course on a given 
financial topic. Good books can go into depth on a topic in a way that simply isn’t 
possible with other resources. Books also aren’t cluttered with advertising and the 
conflicts inherent therein.
As with the other types of resources I discuss in this chapter, you definitely have 
to choose carefully — plenty of mediocrity and garbage is out there.CHAPTER 21 Consuming Financial Content 417
Understanding the book 
publishing business
Book publishers are businesses first. And like most businesses, their business 
practices vary. Some have a reputation for care and quality; others just want to 
push a product out the door with maximum hype and minimum effort.
For instance, you may think that book publishers check out an author before they 
sign them to write an entire book. Well, you may be surprised to find out that some 
publishers don’t do their homework. What most publishers care about first is the 
marketability of a particular book and author. Some authors are marketable because 
of their well-earned reputation for sound advice. Others are marketable because of 
stellar promotional campaigns built on smoke and mirrors. Even more troubling is 
that few publishers require advice guides to be technically reviewed for accuracy by 
an expert in the field other than the author, who sometimes is not an expert. You, 
the reader, are expected to be your own technical reviewer. But do you have the 
expertise to do that? (Don’t worry; this book has been checked for accuracy.)
As an author and financial counselor, I know that financial ideas and strategies 
can differ considerably. Different is not necessarily wrong. When a technical 
reviewer looks at my text and makes a comment or suggestion, I take a second 
look. I may even see things in a new way. If I were the only expert to see my book 
before publication, I wouldn’t benefit from this second expert opinion. How do 
you know whether a book has been technically reviewed? Check the credits page 
or the author’s acknowledgments.
Authors write books for many reasons other than to teach and educate. The most 
common reason financial book authors write books is to further their own busi￾ness interests. That’s not the best thing for you when you’re trying to educate 
yourself and better manage your own finances. For example, some investment 
newsletter sellers write investment books. Rather than teach you how to make 
good investments, the authors make the investment world sound complicated so 
you feel the need to subscribe to their ongoing newsletters.
Books at the head of their class
In addition to books that I’ve recommended at various places throughout this 
book, here’s a list of some of my other favorite financial titles (please also see the 
book summaries I provide on my website, www.erictyson.com):
» A Random Walk Down Wall Street by Burton G. Malkiel (Norton)
» Built to Last: Successful Habits of Visionary Companies by Jim Collins and 
Jerry I. Porras (HarperCollins)418 PART 5 Where to Go for More Help
» Good to Great: Why Some Companies Make the Leap . . . and Others Don’t

buying, house selling, mortgages, real-estate investing, small business and

Chapter 22
Survival Guide for 
Ten Life Changes
Some of life’s changes come unexpectedly, like earthquakes. Others you can 
see coming when they’re still far off, like the birth of a child. Whether a life 
change is predictable or not, your ability to navigate successfully through its 
challenges and adjust to new circumstances depends largely on your degree of 
preparedness.
First, here are some general tips that apply to all types of life changes:
» Stay in financial shape. An athlete is best able to withstand physical adversities 
during competition by prior training and eating well. Likewise, the sounder your 
finances are to begin with, the better you’ll be able to deal with life changes.
» Changes require change. Even if your financial house is in order, a major 
life change — starting a family, buying a home, starting a business, divorcing, 
retiring — should prompt you to review your personal financial strategies. 
Life changes affect your income, spending, insurance needs, and ability to 
take financial risk.
» Don’t procrastinate. With a major life change on the horizon, procrastination 
can be costly. You (and your family) may overspend and accumulate high-cost 
debts, lack proper insurance coverage, or take other unnecessary risks. Early 
preparation can save you from these pitfalls.

focus on what matters most422 PART 6 The Part of Tens
» Manage stress and your emotions. Life changes often are accompanied by 
stress and other emotional upheavals. Don’t make snap decisions during 
these changes. Take the time to become fully informed and recognize and 
acknowledge your feelings. Educating yourself is key. You may want to hire 
experts to help (see Chapter 19), but don’t abdicate decisions and responsibili￾ties to advisors — the advisors may not have your best interests at heart or 
fully appreciate your needs.
Here, then, are the major changes you may have to deal with at some point in your 
life. I wish you more of the good changes than the bad.
Starting Out: Your First Job
If you just graduated from college or some other program, or you’re otherwise 
entering the workforce, your increased income and reduction in educational 
expenses are probably a welcome relief. You’d think, then, that more young adults 
would be able to avoid financial trouble. But they face challenges because of poor 
financial habits picked up at home or from the world at large. Here’s how to get 
on the path to financial success:
» Use credit cards responsibly. While this point may seem obvious, so many 
people do not use credit cards appropriately. Be sure that you are charging 
only what you can pay off each month. Set up automatic electronic payment 
from your bank/investment account to help you make sure that you are 
paying off the full amount each month. Don’t use a credit card to borrow 
money to buy something you can’t afford.
If you have trouble keeping yourself in check with a credit card, try using a 
debit card (see Chapter 6) instead.
» Get in the habit of saving and investing. Ideally, your savings should be 
directed into retirement accounts that offer tax benefits unless you want 
to accumulate down-payment money for other goals such as a home or 
small-business purchase (see Chapter 4). Thinking about a home purchase 
or retirement is usually not in the active thought patterns of first-time job 
seekers. I’m often asked, “At what age should a person start saving?” To me, 
that’s similar to asking at what age you should start brushing your teeth. Well, 
when you have teeth to brush! So I say you should start saving and investing 
money from your first paycheck. Try saving 5 percent of every paycheck and 
then eventually increase your saving to 10 percent. If you’re having trouble 
saving money, track your spending and make cutbacks as needed (refer to 
Chapters 5 and 7).CHAPTER 22 Survival Guide for Ten Life Changes 423
» Get insured. When you’re young and healthy, imagining yourself feeling 
otherwise is hard. Many twenty-somethings give little thought to the potential 
for healthcare expenses. But because accidents and unexpected illnesses can 
strike at any age, forgoing coverage can be financially devastating. When 
you’re in your first full-time job with more-limited benefits, buying disability 
coverage, which replaces income lost due to a long-term disability, is also 
wise. And as you begin to build your assets, consider making out a will so your 
assets go where you want them to in the event of your untimely passing.
» Continue your education. After you get out in the workforce, you (like many 
other people) may realize how little you learned in formal schooling that can 
actually be used in the real world, and conversely, how much you need to 
learn that school never taught you. Read, learn, and continue to grow. The 
best books, blogs, podcasts, seminars, and mentorships are but of the few 
ways to learn and grow. Continuing education can help you advance in your 
career and enjoy the world around you.
Changing Jobs or Careers
During your adult life, you’ll almost surely change jobs — perhaps several times 
a decade. I hope that most of the time you’ll be changing by your own choice. But 
let’s face it: Downsizing has impacted even the most talented workers, and more 
industries are subjected to global competition.
Always be prepared for a job change. No matter how happy you are in your current 
job, knowing that your world won’t fall apart if you’re not working tomorrow can 
give you an added sense of security and encourage openness to possibility. Whether 
you’re changing your job by choice or necessity, the following financial maneu￾vers can help ease the transition:
» Structure your finances to afford an income dip. Spending less than you 
earn always makes good financial sense, but if you’re approaching a possible 
job change, spending less is even more important, particularly if you’re 
entering a new field, facing a period of unemployment, or starting your 
own company and you expect a short-term income dip. Many people view a 
lifestyle of thriftiness as restrictive, but ultimately those thrifty habits can give 
you more freedom to do what you want to do. Be sure to keep an emergency 
reserve fund (see Chapter 9).424 PART 6 The Part of Tens
If you lose your job, batten down the hatches. You normally get little advance 
warning when you lose your job through no choice of your own. It doesn’t 
mean, however, that you can’t do anything financially. Evaluating and slashing 
your current level of spending may be necessary. Everything should be fair 
game, from how much you spend on housing to how often you eat out to 
where you do your grocery shopping. Avoid at all costs the temptation to 
maintain your level of spending by accumulating consumer debt.
» Evaluate the total financial picture when relocating. At some point in your 
career, you may have the option of relocating. But don’t call the moving 
company until you understand the financial consequences of such a move. 
You can’t simply compare salaries and benefits between the two jobs. You 
also should compare the cost of living between the two areas: housing, 
commuting, state income and property taxes, food, utilities, and all the other 
major expenditure categories that I discuss in Chapter 5.
Getting Married
Ready to tie the knot with the one you love? Congratulations — I hope that you’ll 
have a long, healthy, and happy life together. In addition to the emotional and 
moral commitments that you and your spouse will make to one another, you’re 
HOW TO NAVIGATE A DOWN ECONOMY
In addition to managing your job/career through tough economic times, you need to 
keep a level head regarding your overall finances. So, in addition to the advice in the 
section “Changing Jobs or Careers,” please consider the following points:
• Hold onto your long-term investments like stocks and real estate during downturns. 
It’s impossible to know how long and deep a downturn will be, and history has 
shown that prices can bounce back quickly, so you’re not going to be able to time 
buying back well if you try to exit and miss a part of the decline.
• Read and review news and other sources that help you maintain balance and a 
long-term perspective. This likely means limiting your diet of daily news and choos￾ing your resources carefully.
• Consider using extra cash to take advantage of depressed investing prices to buy 
more at favorable prices.
• Don’t beat yourself up for past mistakes. Everyone makes mistakes. Wise people 
learn from and grow from their mistakes.CHAPTER 22 Survival Guide for Ten Life Changes 425
probably going to be merging many of your financial decisions and resources. 
Even if you’re largely in agreement about your financial goals and strategies, 
managing as two is far different than managing as one. Here’s how to prepare:
» Take a compatibility test. Many couples talk too little about their goals and 
plans before marriage, and failing to do so breaks up marriages. Finances 
are just one of numerous issues you should discuss. Ensuring that you know 
what you’re getting yourself into is a good way to minimize your chances for 
heartache. Ministers, priests, and rabbis sometimes offer premarital counsel￾ing to help bring issues and differences to the surface.
» Discuss and set joint goals. After you’re married, you and your spouse 
should set aside time once a year, or every few years, to discuss personal 
and financial goals for the years ahead. When you talk about where you want 
to go, you help ensure that you’re both rowing your financial boat in unison.
» Decide whether to keep finances separate or manage them jointly.
Philosophically, I like the idea of pooling your finances better. After all, 
marriage is a partnership. In some marriages, however, spouses choose to 
keep some money separate so they don’t feel the scrutiny of a spouse with 
different spending preferences. Spouses who have been through divorce 
may choose to keep the assets they bring into the new marriage separate in 
order to protect their money in the event of another divorce. As long as you’re 
jointly accomplishing what you need to financially, some separation of money 
is okay. But for the health of your marriage, don’t hide money, transactions 
(unless it’s a gift for your spouse), or debts from one another, and if you’re 
the higher-income spouse, don’t assume power and control over your 
joint income.
» Coordinate and maximize employer benefits. If one or both of you have 
access to a package of employee benefits through an employer, understand 
how best to make use of those benefits. Coordinating and using the best that 
each package has to offer is like getting a pay raise. If you both have access to 
health insurance, compare which of you has better benefits. Likewise, one of 
you may have a better retirement savings plan — one that matches and offers 
superior investment options. Unless you can afford to save the maximum 
through both your plans, saving more in the better plan will increase your 
combined assets. (Note: If you’re concerned about what will happen if you 
save more in one of your retirement plans and then you divorce, in most 
states, the money is considered part of your joint assets to be divided equally.)
» Discuss life and disability insurance needs. If you and your spouse can 
make do without each other’s income, you may not need any income￾protecting insurance. However, if you both depend on each other’s incomes, 
or if one of you depends fully or partly on the other’s income, you may each 
need long-term disability and term life insurance policies (refer to Chapter 17).426 PART 6 The Part of Tens
» Update your wills. When you marry, you should make or update your wills. 
Having a will is potentially more valuable when you’re married, especially if you 
want to leave money to others in addition to your spouse, or if you have children 
for whom you need to name a guardian. See Chapter 18 for more on wills.
» Reconsider beneficiaries on investment and life insurance. With retire￾ment accounts and life insurance policies, you name beneficiaries to whom 
the money or value in those accounts will go in the event of your passing. 
When you marry, you’ll probably want to revisit and rethink your beneficiaries.
Buying a Home
Most Americans eventually buy a home. You don’t need to own a home to be a 
financial success, but homeownership certainly offers financial rewards. Over the 
course of your adult life, the real estate you own is likely going to appreciate in 
value. Additionally, you’ll pay off your mortgage someday, which will greatly reduce 
your housing costs. If you’re thinking about buying a home, take these steps:
» Get your overall finances in order. Before buying, analyze your current 
budget, your ability to afford debt, and your future financial goals. Make sure 
your expected housing expenses allow you to save properly for retirement 
and other long- or short-term objectives. Don’t buy a home based on the 
maximum amount lenders are willing to lend you.
» Determine whether now’s the time. Buying a house when you don’t see 
yourself staying put three to five years rarely makes financial sense. Buying 
and selling a home gobble up a good deal of money in transaction costs — 
you’ll be lucky to recoup all those costs even within a five-year period. Also, if 
your income is likely to drop or you have other pressing goals, such as starting 
a business, you may want to wait to buy.
For more about buying a home, be sure to read Chapter 15.
Having Children
If you think that being a responsible adult, holding down a job, paying your bills 
on time, and preparing for your financial future are tough, wait ’til you add kids 
to the mix. Most parents find that with children in the family, their already pre￾cious free time and money become much scarcer. The sooner you discover how to CHAPTER 22 Survival Guide for Ten Life Changes 427
manage your time and money, the better able you’ll be to have a sane, happy, and 
financially successful life as a parent. Here are some key things to do both before 
and after you begin your family:
» Set your priorities. As with many other financial decisions, starting or 
expanding a family requires that you plan ahead. Set your priorities and 
structure your finances and living situation accordingly. Is having a bigger 
home in a particular community important, or would you rather feel less 
pressure to work hard, giving you more time to spend with your family? Keep 
in mind that a less hectic work life not only gives you more free time but also 
often reduces your cost of living by decreasing meals out, dry-cleaning costs, 
day-care expenses, and so on.
» Take a hard look at your budget. Having kids requires you to increase your 
spending. At a minimum, expenditures for food and clothing will increase. But 
you’re also likely to spend more on housing, insurance, day care, and educa￾tion. On top of that, if you want to play an active role in raising your children, 
working at some full-time jobs may not be possible. So while you consider the 
added expenses, you may also need to factor in a decrease in income.
No simple rules exist for estimating how kids will affect your household’s 
income and expenses. On the income side, figure out how much you want to 
cut back on work. On the expense side, government statistics show that the 
average household with school-age children spends about 20 percent more 
than a household without children. Going through your budget category by 
category and estimating how kids will change your spending is a more 
scientific approach. (You can use the worksheets in Chapter 5.)
» Boost insurance coverage before getting pregnant. Make sure you have 
health insurance in place if you’re going to try to get pregnant. Even though 
the Affordable Care Act mandated maternity benefits in all health plans, if you 
lack coverage and then get pregnant, you won’t be able to enroll outside of 
the small portion of the year for open enrollment. With disability insurance, 
pregnancy is considered a preexisting condition, so women should secure this 
coverage before getting pregnant. And most families-to-be should buy life 
insurance. Buying life insurance after the bundle of joy comes home from the 
hospital is a risky proposition — if one of the parents develops a health 
problem, they may be denied coverage. You should also consider buying life 
insurance for a stay-at-home parent. Even though the stay-at-home parent is 
not bringing in income, if they were to pass away, hiring assistance could 
harm the family budget.
» Check maternity leave with your employers. Many of the larger employers 
offer some maternity leave for women, and in rare but thankfully increasing 
cases, for men. Some employers offer paid leaves, while others may offer 
unpaid leaves. Understand the options and the financial ramifications before 428 PART 6 The Part of Tens
you consider the leave and, ideally, before you get pregnant. Also, check laws 
within your state for mandated maternity and paternity leave.
» Update your will. If you have a will, update it; if you don’t have a will, make 
one now. With children in the picture, you need to name a guardian who will 
be responsible for raising your children should you and your spouse both 
pass away.
» Enroll the baby in your health plan. After you welcome your baby into this 
world, enroll your newborn in your health insurance plan. Most insurers give 
you about a month or so to enroll.
» Understand child-care tax benefits. You may be eligible for a $2,000 tax 
credit for each child under the age of 17. That should certainly motivate you to 
apply for your kid’s Social Security number!
If you and your spouse both work and you have children under the age of 13 
or a disabled dependent of any age, you can also claim a tax credit for 
child-care expenses. The tax credit may be for up to 35 percent up to a 
maximum of $3,000 in qualifying expenses for one child or dependent, or up 
to $6,000 for two or more children or dependents. Or you may work for an 
employer who offers a flexible benefit or spending plan. These plans allow 
you to put away up to $5,000 per year on a pre-tax basis for child-care 
expenses. For many parents, especially those in higher income tax brackets, 
these plans can save a lot in taxes. Keep in mind, however, that if you use one 
of these plans, you can’t claim the child-care tax credit. Also, if you don’t 
deplete the account every tax year, you forfeit any money left over.
» Skip saving in custodial accounts. One common concern is how to sock 
away enough money to pay for the ever-rising cost of a college education. If 
you start saving money in your child’s name in a so-called custodial account, 
however, you may harm your family’s future ability to qualify for financial aid 
(reduced college pricing) and miss out on the tax benefits that come with 
investing elsewhere (see Chapter 14).
» Don’t indulge the children. Toys, art classes, music lessons, travel sports and 
associated lessons, smartphones, field trips, and the like can rack up big bills, 
especially if you don’t control your spending. Some parents fail to set guide￾lines or limits when spending on children’s programs. Others foolishly follow 
the examples set by the families of their children’s peers. Introspective 
parents have told me that they feel some insecurity about providing the best 
for their children. The parents (and kids) who seem the happiest and most 
financially successful are the ones who clearly distinguish between material 
luxuries and family necessities.CHAPTER 22 Survival Guide for Ten Life Changes 429
As children get older and become indoctrinated into the world of shopping, all 
sorts of other purchases come into play. Consider giving your kids a weekly 
allowance and letting them discover how to spend and manage it. And when 
they’re old enough, having your kids get a part-time job can help teach 
financial responsibility.
Starting a Small Business
Many people aspire to be their own bosses, but far fewer people actually leave 
their jobs in order to achieve that dream. Giving up the apparent security of a job 
with benefits and a built-in network of co-workers is difficult for most people, 
both psychologically and financially. Starting a small business is not for everyone, 
but don’t let inertia stand in your way. Here are some tips to help get you started 
and increase your chances for long-term success:
» Prepare to ditch your job. To maximize your ability to save money, live as 
Spartan a lifestyle as you can while you’re employed; you’ll develop thrifty 
habits that’ll help you weather the reduced income and increased expenditure 
period that comes with most small-business start-ups. You may also want to 
consider easing into your small business by working at it part-time in the 
beginning, with or without cutting back on your normal job.
» Develop a business plan. If you research and think through your business 
idea, not only will you reduce the likelihood of your business’s failing and 
increase its success if it thrives, but you’ll also feel more comfortable taking 
the entrepreneurial plunge. A good business plan describes in detail the 
business idea, the marketplace you’ll compete in, your marketing plans, and 
expected revenue and expenses. A good return on your tax dollars is utilizing 
the services of Small Business Development Centers (SBDC), which are 
nationwide. They will assist you with your business plan and loan packages for 
the Small Business Administration (SBA). Visit https://AmericasSBDC.org
for more information.
» Replace your insurance coverage. Before you finally leave your job, get 
proper insurance. With health insurance, employers allow you to continue 
your existing coverage (at your own expense) for 18 months. With disability 
insurance, secure coverage before you leave your job so you have income to 
qualify for coverage. If you have life insurance through your employer, obtain 
new individual coverage as soon as you know you’re going to leave your job. 
(See Chapter 17 for details.)430 PART 6 The Part of Tens
» Establish a retirement savings plan. After your business starts making a 
profit, consider establishing a retirement savings plan such as a SEP-IRA. As I 
explain in Chapter 12, such plans allow you to shelter up to 20 percent of your 
business income from federal and state taxation.
Caring for Aging Parents
For many, there comes a time when they reverse roles with their parents and 
become the caregivers. As your parents age, they may need help with a variety of 
issues and living tasks. Although you probably won’t have the time or ability to 
perform all these functions yourself, you may end up coordinating some service 
providers who will. Here are key issues to consider when caring for aging parents:
» Get help where possible. In most communities, a variety of nonprofit 
organizations offer information and counseling to families who are caring for 
elderly parents. Numerous for-profit agencies can help with everything from 
simple cleaning and cooking to health checks and medication monitoring, 
assisted living, and health advocacy. You may be able to find your way to such 
resources through your state’s department of insurance, as well as through 
recommendations from local hospitals and doctors. You’ll especially want to 
get assistance and information if your parents need some sort of home care, 
nursing home care, or assisted living arrangement.
» Get involved in their healthcare. Your aging parents may already have a lot 
on their minds, or they simply may not be able to coordinate and manage all 
the healthcare providers who are giving them medications and advice. Try, as 
best as you can, to be their advocate. Speak with their doctors so you can 
understand their current medical condition, the need for various medications, 
and how to help coordinate caregivers. Visit home care providers and nursing 
homes, and speak with prospective care providers.
» Understand tax breaks. If you’re financially supporting your parents, you 
may be eligible for a number of tax credits and deductions for elder care. 
Some employers’ flexible benefit plans allow you to put away money on a 
pre-tax basis to pay for the care of your parents. Also explore the dependent 
care tax credit, which you can take on your federal income tax Form 1040. 
And if you provide half or more of the support costs for your parents, you may 
be able to claim them as dependents on your tax return.
» Discuss getting the estate in order. Parents don’t like thinking about their 
demise, and they may feel awkward discussing this issue with their adult 
children. But opening a dialogue between you and your folks about such CHAPTER 22 Survival Guide for Ten Life Changes 431
issues can be healthy in many ways. Not only does discussing wills, living wills, 
living trusts, and estate planning strategies (see Chapter 18) make you aware 
of your folks’ situation, but it can also improve their plans to both their benefit 
and yours.
» Take some time off. Caring for an aging parent, particularly one who is 
having health problems, can be time-consuming and emotionally draining. Do 
your parents and yourself a favor by using some personal/vacation time to 
help get things in order.
Divorcing
In most marriages that are destined to split up, both parties usually recognize 
early warning signs. Sometimes, however, one spouse may surprise the other with 
an unexpected request for divorce. Whether the divorce is planned or unexpected, 
here are some important considerations when getting a divorce:
» Question the divorce. Some say that divorcing in America is too easy, and I 
tend to agree. Although some couples are indeed better off parting ways, 
others give up too easily, thinking that the grass is greener elsewhere, only to 
later discover that all lawns have weeds and crabgrass. Just as with lawns that 
aren’t watered and fertilized, relationships can wither without nurturing.
Money and disagreements over money are certainly contributing factors in 
marital unhappiness. Try talking things over, perhaps with a marital counselor.
» Separate your emotions from the financial issues. Feelings of revenge may 
be common in some divorces, but they’ll probably only help ensure that the 
attorneys get rich as you and your spouse butt heads. If you really want a 
divorce, work at doing it efficiently and harmoniously so you can get on with 
your lives and have more of your money to work with.
» Detail resources and priorities. Draw up a list of all the assets and liabilities 
that you and your spouse have. Make sure you list all the financial facts, 
including investment account records and statements. After you know the 
whole picture, begin to think about what is and isn’t important to you 
financially and otherwise.
» Educate yourself about personal finance and legal issues. Divorce 
sometimes forces non-financially–oriented spouses to get a crash course in 
personal finance at a difficult emotional time. This book can help educate you 
financially. Peruse a bookstore and buy a good legal guide or two about 
divorce.432 PART 6 The Part of Tens
» Choose advisors carefully. Odds are that you’ll retain the services of one 
or more specialists to assist you with the myriad issues, negotiations, and 
concerns of your divorce. Legal, tax, and financial advisors can help, but 
make sure you recognize their limitations and conflicts of interest. The more 
complicated things become and the more you haggle with your spouse, the 
more attorneys, unfortunately, benefit financially. Don’t use your divorce 
attorney for financial or tax advice — your lawyer probably knows no more 
than you do in these areas. Also, realize that you don’t need an attorney to get 
divorced. A variety of books and kits can help you. As for choosing tax and 
financial advisors, if you think you need that type of help, see Chapters 8 
and 19 for advice on how to find good advisors.
» Analyze your spending. Some divorcees find themselves financially 
squeezed in the early years following a divorce because two people living 
together in the same property can generally do so less expensively than 
two people living separately. Analyzing your spending needs pre-divorce can 
help you adjust to a new budget and negotiate a fairer settlement with your 
spouse.
» Review needed changes to your insurance. If you’re covered under your 
spouse’s employer’s insurance plan, make sure you get this coverage replaced 
(see Chapter 17). If you or your children will still be financially dependent on 
your spouse post-divorce, make sure the divorce agreement mandates life 
insurance coverage. You should also revise your will (see Chapter 18).
» Revamp your retirement plan. With changes to your income, expenses, 
assets, liabilities, and future needs, your retirement plan will surely need a 
post-divorce overhaul. Refer to Chapter 4 for a reorientation.
Receiving a Windfall
Whether through inheritance, stock options, small-business success, or lottery 
winnings, you may receive a financial windfall at some point in your life. Like 
many people who are totally unprepared psychologically and organizationally for 
their sudden good fortune, you may find that a flood of money can create more 
problems than it solves. Here are a few tips to help you make the most of your 
financial windfall:
» Educate yourself. If you’ve never had to deal with significant wealth, I don’t 
expect you to know how to handle it. Don’t pressure yourself to invest it as soon 
as possible. Leaving the money where it is or stashing it in one of the higher￾yielding money-market funds I recommend in Chapter 13 is far better than 
jumping into investments that you don’t understand and haven’t researched.CHAPTER 22 Survival Guide for Ten Life Changes 433
» Beware of the sharks. You may begin to wonder whether someone has 
posted your net worth, address, and phone number in the local newspaper 
and on the internet. Brokers and financial advisors may flood you with 
marketing materials, telephone solicitations, and lunch date requests. These 
folks pursue you for a reason: They want to convert your money into their 
income either by selling you investments and other financial products or by 
managing your money. Stay away from the sharks, educate yourself, and take 
charge of your own financial moves. Decide on your own terms whom to hire, 
and then seek them out.
» Recognize the emotional side of coming into a lot of money. One of the 
side effects of accumulating wealth quickly is that you may have feelings of 
guilt or otherwise be unhappy, especially if you expected money to solve your 
problems. If you didn’t invest in your relationship with your parents and, after 
their passing, you regret how you interacted with them, getting a big inheri￾tance from your folks may make you feel bad. If you poured endless hours 
into a business venture that finally paid off, all that money in your investment 
accounts may leave you with a hollow feeling if you’re divorced and you lost 
friends by neglecting your relationships.
» Pay down debts. People generally borrow money to buy things that they 
otherwise can’t buy in one fell swoop. Paying off your debts is one of the 
simplest and best investments you can make when you come into wealth.
» Diversify. If you want to protect your wealth, don’t keep it all in one pot. 
Mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (see Chapter 11) are ideally 
diversified, professionally managed investment vehicles to consider. And if 
you want your money to continue growing, consider the wealth-building 
investments — stocks, real estate, and small-business options — that I discuss 
in Part 3 of this book.
» Make use of the opportunity. Most people work for a paycheck for many 
decades so they can pay a never-ending stream of monthly bills. Although I’m 
not advocating a hedonistic lifestyle, why not take some extra time to travel, 
spend time with your family, and enjoy the hobbies you’ve long been putting 
off? How about trying a new career that you may find more fulfilling and that 
may make the world a better place? And what about donating some to your 
favorite charities?
Retiring
If you’ve spent the bulk of your adult life working, retiring can be a challenging 
transition. Most Americans have an idealized vision of how wonderful retirement 
will be — no more irritating bosses and pressure of work deadlines; unlimited 434 PART 6 The Part of Tens
time to travel, play, and lead the good life. Sounds good, huh? Well, the reality for 
most Americans is different, especially for those who don’t plan ahead (finan￾cially and otherwise). Here are some tips to help you through retirement:
» Plan both financially and personally. Planning your activities is even more 
important than planning financially. If the focus during your working years is 
solely on your career and saving money, you may lack interests, friends, and 
the ability to know how to spend money when you retire.
» Take stock of your resources. Many people worry and wonder whether they 
have sufficient assets for cutting back on work or retiring completely, yet they 
don’t crunch any numbers to see where they stand. Ignorance may cause you 
to misunderstand how little or how much you really have for retirement when 
compared to what you need. See Chapters 4 and 12 for help with retirement 
planning and investing.
» Reevaluate your insurance needs. When you have sufficient assets to retire, 
you don’t need to retain insurance to protect your employment income any 
longer. On the other hand, as your assets grow over the years, you may be 
underinsured with regards to liability insurance (see Chapter 18).
» Evaluate healthcare/living options. Medical expenses in your retirement 
years (particularly the cost of nursing home care) can be daunting. Which 
course of action you take — supplemental insurance, buying into a retirement 
community, or not doing anything — depends on your financial and personal 
situation. Early preparation increases your options; if you wait until you have 
major health problems, it may be too late to choose specific paths. (See 
Chapter 17 for more details on healthcare options.)
» Decide what to do with your retirement plan money. If you have money in 
a retirement savings plan, your employer may offer you the option of leaving 
the money in the plan rather than rolling it over into your own retirement 
account. Brokers and financial advisors clearly prefer that you do the latter 
because it means more money for them, but it can also give you many more 
(and perhaps better) investment choices to consider. Read Part 3 of this book 
to find out about investing and evaluating the quality of your employer’s 
retirement plan investment options.
» Pick a pension option. Selecting a pension option (a plan that pays a monthly 
benefit during retirement) is similar to choosing a good investment — each 
pension option carries different risks, benefits, and tax consequences. 
Actuaries who base pension options on reasonable life expectancies structure 
pensions. The younger you are when you start collecting your pension, the 
less you get per month. Check to see whether the amount of your monthly 
pension stops increasing past a certain age. You obviously don’t want to delay 
access to your pension benefits past that age, because you won’t receive a 
reward for waiting any longer and you’ll collect the benefit for fewer months.CHAPTER 22 Survival Guide for Ten Life Changes 435
If you know you have a health problem that shortens your life expectancy, you 
may benefit from drawing your pension sooner. If you plan to continue working 
in some capacity and earning a decent income after retiring, waiting for higher 
pension benefits when you’re in a lower tax bracket is probably wise.
At one end of the spectrum, you have the risky single life option, which pays 
benefits until you pass away and then provides no benefits for your spouse 
thereafter. This option maximizes your monthly take while you’re alive. 
Consider this option only if your spouse can do without this income. The least 
risky option, and thus least financially rewarding while the pensioner is still 
living, is the 100-percent joint and survivor option, which pays your survivor the 
same amount that you received while still alive. The other joint and survivor 
options fall somewhere between these two extremes and generally make 
sense for most couples who desire decent pensions early in retirement but 
want a reasonable amount to continue in the event that the pensioner dies 
first. The 75-percent joint and survivor option is a popular choice, because it 
closely matches the lower expense needs of the lone surviving spouse at 
75 percent of the expenses of the couple, and it provides higher payments 
than the 100-percent joint and survivor option while both spouses are alive.
» Get your estate in order. Confronting your mortality is never fun, but when 
you’re considering retirement or you’re already retired, getting your estate in 
order makes all the more sense. Find out about wills and trusts that may 
benefit you and your heirs. You may also want to consider giving monetary 
gifts now if you have more than you need. Doing so enables you to enjoy and 
see how others will utilize your funds.CHAPTER 23 Ten Tactics to Thwart Identity Theft and Fraud 437

Ten Tactics to Thwart 
Identity Theft and Fraud
Hucksters and thieves are often several steps ahead of law enforcement. 
Eventually, some of the bad guys get caught, but many don’t, and those 
who do get nabbed often go back to their unsavory ways after penalties and 
some jail time. They may even be in your neighborhood or on your local Little 
League board.
Years ago I got a call from my bank informing me that it had just discovered “con￾cerning activity” on the joint checking account I held with my wife. Specifically, 
what had happened was that a man with a bogus ID in my name had gone into five 
different Bank of America branches on the same day and withdrawn $80 from our 
checking account at each one. After some detective work, I discovered that some￾one had pilfered our personal banking information at my wife’s employer’s pay￾roll office. Fortunately, the bank made good on the money that it had allowed to 
be withdrawn by my impostor.
I had been the victim of identity theft. In my situation, the crook had accessed one 
of my accounts; in other cases, the criminal activity may develop with someone 
opening an account (such as a credit card) using someone’s stolen personal infor￾mation. Victims of identity theft can suffer trashed credit reports, reduced ability 
to qualify for loans and even jobs (with employers who check credit reports), 
out-of-pocket costs and losses, and dozens of hours of time to clean up the mess 
and clear their credit record and name.
IN THIS CHAPTER
» Protecting your personal information
» Paying attention to activity in your 
accounts and credit history438 PART 6 The Part of Tens
Unfortunately, identity theft is hardly the only way to be taken to the cleaners by 
crooks. All sorts of scamsters hatch schemes to separate you from your money. 
Please follow the ten tips in this chapter to keep yourself from falling prey and 
unnecessarily losing money.
Save Phone Discussions for Friends Only
Never, ever give out personal information over the phone, especially when you 
aren’t the one who initiated the call. Suppose you get a call and the person on the 
other end of the line claims to be with a company you conduct business with (such 
as your credit-card company or bank). Ask for the caller’s name and number and 
call back the company’s main number (which you look up) to be sure the person 
who called you is indeed with that company and has a legitimate business reason 
for contacting you.
With caller ID on your phone line, you may be able to see what number a call is 
originating from, but often calls from business-registered phone numbers come 
up as “unavailable.” And, crooks have gotten more advanced and can “spoof” real 
phone numbers that aren’t actually the numbers they are calling from. A major 
red flag: calling back the number that comes through on caller ID and discovering 
that the number is bogus (a nonworking number).
Never Respond to Emails 
Soliciting Information
You may have seen or heard about official-looking emails sent from companies 
you know of and may do business with asking you to promptly visit their website 
to correct some sort of billing or account problem. Crooks can generate a return/
sender email address that looks like it comes from a known institution but really 
does not. This unscrupulous practice is known as phishing, and if you bite at the 
bait, visit the site, and provide the requested personal information, your reward is 
likely to be some sort of future identity-theft problem and possibly a computer 
virus.
To find out more about how to protect yourself from phishing scams, visit the 
website of the Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG) at apwg.org/.CHAPTER 23 Ten Tactics to Thwart Identity Theft and Fraud 439
Review Your Monthly Financial 
Statements
Although financial institutions such as banks may call you if they notice unusual 
activity on one of your accounts, some people discover problematic account activ￾ity by simply reviewing their monthly credit-card, checking-account, and other 
statements.
Do you need to balance bank account statements to the penny? No, you don’t. 
I haven’t for years (decades actually), and I don’t have the time or patience for 
such minutiae. The key is to review the line items on your statement to be sure 
that all the transactions were yours and are correct.
Secure All Receipts
When you make a purchase, be sure to keep track of and secure receipts, especially 
those that contain your personal financial or account information. You can keep 
these in an envelope in your home, for example. Then cross-check them against 
your monthly statement.
When you no longer need to retain your receipts, be sure to dispose of them in a 
way that prevents a thief, who may get into your garbage, from being able to deci￾pher the information on them. Rip up the receipts or, if you feel so inclined, buy a 
small paper shredder for your home and/or small business.
Close Unnecessary Credit Accounts
Open your wallet and remove all the pieces of plastic within it that enable you to 
charge purchases. The more credit cards and credit lines you have, the more likely 
you are to have problems with identity theft and fraud and the more likely you are 
to overspend and carry debt balances. Also, reduce preapproved credit offers by 
contacting 888-5OPTOUT (888-567-8688) or visiting www.optoutprescreen.com.
Unless you maintain a card for small-business transactions, you really “need” 
only one piece of plastic with a Visa or Mastercard logo. Give preference to a 
debit card or other direct payment methods if you have a history of accumulating 
credit-card-debt balances.440 PART 6 The Part of Tens
Regularly Review Your Credit Reports
You may also be tipped off to shenanigans going on in your name when you review 
your credit report. Some identity-theft victims have found out about credit 
accounts opened in their name by reviewing their credit reports.
Because you’re entitled to a free credit report from each of the three major credit 
agencies every year, I recommend reviewing your reports at least that often. The 
reports generally contain the same information, so you can request and review 
one agency report every four months, which enables you to keep a closer eye on 
your reports and still obtain them without cost. (Be sure to use the free site 
www.annualcreditreport.com.)
I don’t generally recommend spending the $100 or so annually for a so-called 
credit monitoring service that updates you when something happens on your 
credit reports. If you’re concerned about someone illegally applying for credit in 
your name, know that another option for you to stay on top of things is to “freeze” 
your personal credit reports and scores (see the next section).
Freeze Your Credit Reports or 
Place an Alert
To address the growing problem of identity theft, all states have credit freeze 
laws, which enable consumers to prevent access to their personal credit reports. 
And the law requires that you can freeze your credit file for free.
In some states, only identity-theft victims may freeze their reports. The individ￾ual whose credit report is frozen is the only person who may grant access to the 
frozen credit report.
A fraud alert requires creditors to verify your identity before processing credit 
applications. If you suspect you’ve been a victim of identity theft, you can place an 
initial fraud report for one year. Active-duty service members can also place a 
one-year alert to protect their credit file. An extended fraud alert can be placed for 
seven years if you file an identity theft report with the police or Federal Trade 
Commission (FTC). Alerts also remove you from prescreened credit and insurance 
offers.CHAPTER 23 Ten Tactics to Thwart Identity Theft and Fraud 441
Credit freezes and fraud alerts are designed to prevent identity thieves from open￾ing loans or credit accounts in your name.
Keep Personal Info Off Your Checks
Don’t place personal information on checks. Information that is useful to identity 
thieves — and that you should not put on your checks — includes your credit￾card number, driver’s license number, Social Security number, and so on. I also 
encourage you to leave your home address off your preprinted checks when you 
order them. Otherwise, every Tom, Dick, and Jane whose hands your check passes 
through knows exactly where you live.
When writing a check to a merchant, question the need for adding personal 
information to the check (in fact, in numerous states, requesting and placing 
credit-card numbers on checks is against the law). Remember that your credit 
card doesn’t advertise your home address and other financial account data, so 
there’s no need to publicize it to the world on your checks.
Protect Your Computer and Files
Especially if you keep personal and financial data on your computer, consider 
the following safeguards to protect your computer and the confidential informa￾tion on it:
» Install a firewall.
» Use virus protection software.
» Password-protect access to your programs and files.
Protect Your Mail
Some identity thieves have collected personal information by simply helping 
themselves to mail in home mailboxes. Stealing mail is easy, especially if your 
mail is delivered to a curbside box.442 PART 6 The Part of Tens
Consider using a locked mailbox or a post office box to protect your incoming mail 
from theft. Consider having your investment and other important statements sent 
to you via email, or simply access them online and eliminate mail delivery of 
paper copies.
Check washing, the process of erasing details on checks and rewriting them, is a 
common fraud involving stolen mail containing checks. Amazon and office supply 
stores sell fraud prevention writing pens with ink that can’t be washed.
Be careful with your outgoing mail as well, such as bills with checks attached. 
Minimize your outgoing mail and save yourself hassles by signing up for auto￾matic bill payment for as many bills as possible. Drop the rest of your outgoing 
mail in a secure U.S. postal box, such as those you find at the local post office.Glossary 443
Glossary
adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM): A mortgage whose interest rate and monthly pay￾ments vary throughout its life. ARMs typically start with an artificially low interest rate that 
eventually rises once the initial rate guarantee period ends. The interest rate is deter￾mined by a formula: margin (which is a fixed number) plus index (which varies). Generally 
speaking, if the overall level of interest rates drops, as measured by a variety of different 
indexes, the interest rate of your ARM generally follows suit. Similarly, if interest rates rise, 
so does your mortgage’s interest rate and monthly payment. Caps limit the amount that 
the interest rate can fluctuate. Before you agree to an ARM, be certain that you can afford 
its highest possible payments.
adjusted cost basis: For capital gains tax purposes, the adjusted cost basis is how the IRS 
determines your profit or loss when you sell an asset such as a home or a security. For an 
investment such as a mutual fund or stock, your cost basis is what you originally invested 
plus any reinvested money and any trading or transaction fees. For a home, you arrive at 
the adjusted cost basis by adding the original purchase price to the cost of any capital 
improvements (expenditures that increase your property’s value and life expectancy).
adjusted gross income (AGI): The sum of your taxable income (such as wages, salaries, 
and tips) and taxable interest less allowable adjustments (such as retirement account 
contributions and moving expenses). AGI is calculated before subtracting your personal 
exemptions and itemized deductions, which are used to derive your taxable income.
after-tax contributions: Some retirement plans (such as Roth IRAs) allow you to 
contribute money that has already been taxed. Such contributions are known as after￾tax contributions.
alternative minimum tax (AMT): The name given to a sort of shadow tax system that 
may cause you to pay a higher amount in federal income taxes than you otherwise would. 
The AMT was designed to prevent higher-income earners from lowering their tax bills too 
much through large deductions.
annual percentage rate (APR): The figure that states the total yearly cost of a loan as 
expressed by the actual rate of interest paid. The APR includes the base interest rate and 
any other add-on loan fees and costs. The APR is thus inevitably higher than the rate of 
interest that the lender quotes.444 Personal Finance For Dummies
annuity: An investment that is a contract backed by an insurance company. An annuity is 
frequently purchased for retirement purposes. Its main benefit is that it allows your 
money to compound and grow without taxation until withdrawal. Selling annuities is a 
lucrative source of income for insurance agents and financial advisors who work on 
commission, so don’t buy an annuity until you’re sure it makes sense for your situation.
asset allocation: When you invest your money, you need to decide how to proportion 
(allocate) it between risky, growth-oriented investments (such as stocks), whose values 
fluctuate, and more stable, income-producing investments (like bonds). How soon you’ll 
need the money and how tolerant you are of risk are two important determinants when 
deciding how to allocate your money.
audit: An IRS examination of your financial records, generally at the IRS offices, to 
substantiate your tax return. IRS audits are generally feared to be among life’s worst 
experiences.
bank prime rate: See prime rate.
bankruptcy: Legal action that puts a halt to creditors’ attempts to collect unpaid debts 
from you. Of use to people who have a high proportion of consumer debt to annual 
income (25 percent or greater).
bear market: A period (such as the early 2000s and late 2000s) when the stock market 
experiences a strong downward swing. It is often accompanied by (and sometimes 
precedes) an economic recession. Imagine a bear in hibernation, because this is what 
happens in a bear market: Investors hibernate, and the market falters. During a bear 
market, the value of stocks can decrease significantly. The market usually has to drop at 
least 20 percent from its peak before it is considered a bear market.
beneficiaries: The people to whom you want to leave your assets (or in the case of life 
insurance or a pension plan, benefits) in the event of your death. You denote beneficiaries 
for each of your retirement accounts.
blue-chip stock: The stock of the largest and most consistently profitable corporations. 
This term comes from poker, where the most valuable chips are blue. This list is unofficial 
and changes.
bond: A loan investors make to a corporation or government. Bonds generally pay a set 
amount of interest on a regular basis. They’re an appropriate investment vehicle for 
conservative investors who don’t feel comfortable with the risk involved in investing in 
stocks and who want to receive a steady income. All bonds have a maturity date when the 
bond issuer must pay back the bond at par (full) value to the bondholders (lenders). 
Bonds should not be your primary long-term investment vehicle, because they produce 
little real growth on your original investment after inflation is factored in.
bond rating: See Standard & Poor’s (S&P) ratings and Moody’s ratings.
bond yield: A yield is quoted as an annual percentage rate of return that a bond will 
produce based on its current value if it makes its promised interest payments. How much 
a bond will yield to an investor depends on three important factors: the stated interest 
payments by the bond, changes in the creditworthiness of the bond’s issuer, and the Glossary 445
maturity date of the bond. The better the rating a bond receives, the less risk involved 
and, thus, the lower the yield. As far as the maturity date is concerned, the longer you 
loan your money, the higher the risk (because it’s more likely that rates will fluctuate) and 
the higher your yield generally will be.
broker: A person who acts as an intermediary for the purchase or sale of investments. 
When you buy a house, insurance, or stock, you’re most likely to do so through a broker. 
Most brokers are paid on commission, which creates a conflict of interest with their 
clients: The more brokers sell, the more they make. Some insurance companies let you 
buy their policies directly, and many mutual-fund families bypass stockbrokers. If you’re 
going to work with a broker, a discount broker can help you save on commissions.
bull market: A period (such as most of the 1980s, 1990s, mid-2000s, and 2010s in the 
United States) when the stock market moves higher, usually accompanied and driven by a 
growing economy and increasing corporate profits.
callable bond: A bond for which the lender can decide to pay the holder earlier than the 
previously agreed-upon final maturity date. If interest rates are relatively high when a 
bond is issued, lenders may prefer to issue callable bonds because they have the flexibility 
to call back these bonds and issue new, lower-interest-rate bonds if interest rates decline. 
Callable bonds are risky for investors, because if interest rates decrease, bond holders will 
get their investment money returned early and may have to reinvest their money at a 
lower interest rate.
capital gain: The profit from selling your stock at a higher price than the price for which it 
was purchased. For example, if you buy 50 shares of Sam & Ella’s Chicken Subs stock at 
$20 per share and two years later you sell your shares when the price rises to $25 per 
share, your profit or capital gain is $5 per share, or $250. If you hold this stock outside of a 
tax-sheltered retirement account, you’ll owe federal tax on this profit when you sell the 
stock. Many states also levy such a tax.
capital gains distribution: Taxable distribution by a mutual fund or real-estate invest￾ment trust (REIT) created by securities that are sold within the fund or REIT at a profit. 
These distributions may be either short-term (assets held a year or less) or long-term 
(assets held for more than one year).
cash value insurance: A type of life insurance that’s extremely popular with insurance 
salespeople because it commands a high commission. In a cash value policy, you buy life 
insurance coverage but also get a savings-type account. Unless you’re looking for ways to 
limit your taxable estate (if you’re extremely wealthy, for example), avoid cash value 
insurance. The investment returns tend to be mediocre, and your contributions aren’t 
tax-deductible.
certificate of deposit (CD): A specific-term loan that you make to your banker. The 
maturity date for CDs ranges from a month up to several years. The interest paid on CDs 
is fully taxable, thus making CDs inappropriate for higher tax-bracket investors investing 
outside tax-sheltered retirement accounts.
check washing: The process thieves use to alter stolen checks to change the name and 
amount of the check. Pens with ink that won’t wash are available to prevent this.446 Personal Finance For Dummies
closed-end mutual fund: A mutual fund for which the exact number of shares that are 
going to be issued to investors is decided up front. After all the shares are sold, an investor 
seeking to invest in the closed-end fund can only do so by purchasing shares from an 
existing investor. Shares of closed-end funds trade on the major stock exchanges and 
therefore sell at either a discount, if the sellers exceed the buyers, or at a premium, if 
demand exceeds supply.
COBRA (Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act): Name of the federal 
legislation that requires health insurers and larger employers to continue to offer health 
insurance, at the employee’s expense, for 18 months after coverage would otherwise 
end — for example, when an employee is laid off.
commercial paper: A short-term debt or IOU issued by larger, stable companies to 
help make their businesses grow and prosper. Credit-worthy companies can sell this 
debt security directly to large investors and thus bypass borrowing money from bankers. 
Money-market funds invest in soon-to-mature commercial paper.
commission: The percentage of the selling price of a house, stock, bond, or other 
investment that’s paid to agents and brokers. Because most agents and brokers are paid 
by commission, understanding how the commission can influence their behavior and 
recommendations is important for investors and home buyers. Agents and brokers make 
money only when you make a purchase, and they make more money when you make a 
bigger purchase. Choose an agent carefully and take your agent’s advice with a grain of 
salt, because this conflict of interest can often set an agent’s visions and goals at odds 
with your own.
commodity: A raw material (gold, wheat, sugar, or gasoline, for example) traded on the 
futures market.
common stock: Shares in a company that don’t offer a guaranteed amount of dividend to 
investors; the amount of dividend distributions, if any, is at the discretion of company 
management. Although common-stock investors may or may not make money through 
dividends, they hope that the stock price will appreciate as the company expands its 
operations and increases its profits. Common stock tends to offer you a better return 
(profit) than other investments, such as bonds or preferred stock. However, if the 
company falters, you may lose some or all of your investment.
comparable market analysis (CMA): A written analysis of similar houses currently 
being offered for sale and those that have recently sold. Real-estate agents usually 
complete CMAs.
consumer debt: Debt on consumer items that depreciate in value over time. Credit-card 
balances and auto loans are examples of consumer debt. This type of debt is bad for your 
financial health because it carries a high interest rate and encourages you to live beyond 
your means.
Consumer Price Index (CPI): The Consumer Price Index reports price changes, on a 
monthly basis, in the cost of living for such items as food, housing, transportation, 
healthcare, entertainment, clothing, and other miscellaneous expenses. The CPI is used 
yearly to increase government benefits, such as Social Security, and is used by many 
employers to determine cost-of-living increases in wages and pensions. An increase in 
prices is also known as inflation.Glossary 447
co-payment: The percentage of your medical bill that your health plan requires you to 
pay out of your own pocket with each medical visit or treatment, often even after you 
satisfy your annual deductible. A typical co-payment is 20 percent.
credit alert: A fraud alert on your credit reports requires creditors to verify your identity 
before processing credit applications.
credit freeze: A credit freeze blocks access to your credit report altogether. You must 
thaw it or provide a security code sent to you by the credit bureau.
credit report: A report that details your credit history. It’s the main report that a lender 
uses to determine whether to give you a loan. You may obtain free copies of your credit 
reports annually.
credit score: A score ranging from 300–850 that indicates how you use credit. The 
absence of a score is concerning to lenders because you’re an unknown credit risk. 
Building a positive score can help in multiple areas of your financial life.
cryptocurrency: Numbering more than 26,000 in total, cryptocurrencies, the most 
famous of which include Bitcoin and Ethereum, are made-up digital-only “currencies,” 
which exist online. This universe has witnessed sometimes tremendous speculation 
from those hopeful of discovering the next cryptocurrency to catch on and rise greatly 
in value. The vast majority of cryptocurrencies have been poor investments.
debit card: Although they may look like credit cards, debit cards are different in one 
important way: When you use a debit card, the purchase amount is deducted from your 
checking account. Thus, a debit card gives you the convenience of a credit card without 
the danger of building up a mountain of consumer debt.
deductible: You may be thinking that this is a new product from the Keebler elves. 
Unfortunately, a deductible is actually much more mundane. With insurance, the 
deductible is the amount you pay when you file a claim. For example, say that your car 
sustains $800 in damage. If your deductible is $500, the insurance covers $300, and you 
pay $500 out of your own pocket for the repairs. The higher the deductible, the lower 
your insurance premiums and the less paperwork you expose yourself to when filing 
claims (because small losses that are less than the deductible don’t require filing a claim). 
Take the highest deductibles that you can afford when selecting insurance.
deduction: An expense you may subtract from your income to lower your taxable 
income. Examples include mortgage interest and property taxes (itemized deductions), 
and most retirement account contributions.
derivative: An investment instrument whose value is derived from other securities. 
For example, the value of an option to buy Netflix stock is derived from the price of 
Netflix’s stock.
disability insurance: Disability insurance replaces a portion of your employment income 
in the unlikely event that you suffer a disability that keeps you from working.
discount broker: Unlike a full-service broker, a discount broker generally offers no 
investment advice and has employees who work on salary rather than on commission. 
In addition to trading individual securities, most discount brokerage firms also offer 
no-load (commission-free) mutual-fund-trading networks.448 Personal Finance For Dummies
diversification: If you put all your money into one type of investment, you’re potentially 
setting yourself up for a big shock. If that investment collapses, so does your investment 
world. By spreading (diversifying) your money among different investments — bonds, 
U.S. stocks, international stocks, real estate, and so on — you ensure yourself a better 
chance of investing success and fewer sleepless nights.
dividend: The dividend is the income paid to investors holding an investment. With stock, 
the dividend is a portion of a company’s profits paid to its shareholders. For example, 
if a company has an annual dividend of $2 per share and you own 100 shares, your total 
dividend is $200. Usually, established and slower-growing companies pay dividends, while 
smaller and faster-growing companies reinvest their profits for growth. For assets held 
outside retirement accounts, dividends (except from tax-free money-market and tax-free 
bond funds) are taxable.
dollar-cost averaging (DCA): The process of regularly investing money. You can do it with 
a lump sum of money you may have awaiting investment or through regular payroll 
earnings.
Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA): A widely followed stock market index comprised of 
30 large, actively traded U.S. company stocks. Senior editors at the Wall Street Journal
select the stocks in the DJIA.
down payment: The part of the purchase price for a house that the buyer pays in cash 
up front and does not finance with a mortgage. The larger the down payment, the smaller 
the mortgage amount and often the lower the interest rate. You can usually get access to 
the best mortgage programs with a down payment of at least 20 percent of the home’s 
purchase price.
earthquake insurance: Although the West Coast is often associated with earthquakes, 
other areas are also quake prone. An earthquake insurance rider (which usually comes 
with a deductible of 5 to 20 percent of the cost to rebuild the home) on a homeowner’s 
policy pays to repair or rebuild your home if it is damaged in an earthquake. If you live in 
an area with earthquake risk, consider earthquake insurance coverage!
Emerging Markets Index: The Emerging Markets Index, which is published by MSCI, 
tracks stock markets in developing countries. The main reason for investing in emerging 
markets is that these economies typically experience a higher rate of economic growth 
than developed markets. However, the potential for higher returns is coupled with 
greater risk.
equity: In the real-estate world, this term refers to the difference between the market 
value of your home and what you owe on it. For example, if your home is worth $300,000, 
and you have an outstanding mortgage of $230,000, your equity is $70,000. Equity is also 
a synonym for stock.
estate: The value, at the time of your death, of your assets minus your loans and 
liabilities.
estate planning: The process of deciding where and how your assets will be transferred 
when you die and structuring your assets during your lifetime so as to minimize likely 
estate taxes.Glossary 449
exchange-traded fund (ETF): These funds are similar to mutual funds except that they 
trade on a major stock exchange and thus can be bought and sold throughout the 
trading day.
Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA): The FNMA (or Fannie Mae) is one 
of the best-known institutions in the secondary mortgage market. Fannie Mae buys 
mortgages from banks and other mortgage-lending institutions and, in turn, sells them 
to investors. These loan investments are considered safe because Fannie Mae buys 
mortgages only from companies that conform to its stringent mortgage regulations, 
and Fannie Mae guarantees the repayment of principal and interest on the loans that 
it sells. FNMA, although it is a public company, also has an implicit federal government 
guarantee that was demonstrated in late 2008 during the financial crisis.
financial assets: A property or investment (such as investment real estate or a stock, 
mutual fund, or bond) that is held primarily as an investment to generate a positive return 
over time.
financial liabilities: Your outstanding loans and debts. To determine your net worth, 
subtract your financial liabilities from your financial assets.
financial planners (or advisors): A motley crew that professes an ability to direct your 
financial future. Financial planners come with varying backgrounds and degrees: MBAs, 
Certified Financial Planners, and Certified Public Accountants, to name a few. A useful 
way to distinguish among this mixed bag of nuts is to determine whether the planners 
are commission-, fee-, or hourly-based.
fixed-rate mortgage: The granddaddy of all mortgages. You lock into an interest rate 
(for example, 5 percent), and it never changes during the life (term) of your 15- or 30-year 
mortgage. Your mortgage payment and interest rate will be the same amount each and 
every month. If you become a cursing, frothing maniac when you miss your morning 
coffee or someone is five minutes late, then this mortgage may be for you!
flood insurance: If there’s a remote chance that your area may flood, having flood 
insurance, which reimburses rebuilding your home and replacing its contents in the event 
of a flood, is wise.
401(k) plan: A type of retirement savings plan offered by many for-profit companies to 
their employees. Your contributions compound without taxation over time and are usually 
exempt (yes!) from federal and state income taxes until withdrawal.
403(b) plan: Similar to a 401(k) plan but for employees of nonprofit organizations.
full-service broker: A broker who gives advice and charges a high commission relative to 
discount brokers. Because the brokers work on commission, they have a significant 
conflict of interest: namely, to advocate strategies that will benefit them financially.
futures: An obligation to buy or sell a commodity or security on a specific day for a preset 
price. When used by most individual investors, futures represent a short-term gamble on 
the short-term direction of the price of a commodity. Companies and farmers use futures 
contracts to hedge their risks of changing prices.450 Personal Finance For Dummies
guaranteed-investment contracts (GICs): Insurance company investments that appeal 
to skittish investors. GICs generally tell you one year in advance what your interest rate 
will be for the coming year. Thus, you don’t have to worry about fluctuations and losses 
in your investment value. On the other hand, GICs offer you little upside, because the 
interest rate is comparable to what you may get on a short-term bank certificate of 
deposit.
home equity: See equity.
home-equity loan: Technical jargon for what used to be called a second mortgage. With 
this type of loan, you borrow against the equity in your house. If used wisely, a home￾equity loan can help pay off high-interest consumer debt or be tapped for other short￾term needs (such as a remodeling project). In contrast with consumer debt, mortgage 
debt usually has a lower interest rate and is tax-deductible.
homeowner’s insurance: Dwelling coverage that covers the cost of rebuilding your 
house in the event of fire or another calamity. The liability insurance portion of this policy 
protects you against lawsuits associated with your property. Another essential element of 
homeowner’s insurance is the personal property coverage, which pays to replace your 
damaged or stolen possessions.
index: 1) A security market index, such as the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, is a statistical 
composite that tracks the price level and performance of a basket of many securities, 
typically within a specific investment asset class. Indexes exist for various stock and bond 
markets and are typically set at a round number, such as 100, at a particular point in time. 
See also Dow Jones Industrial Average and Russell 2000. 2) The index can also refer to the 
measure of the overall level of interest rates that a lender uses as a reference to calculate 
the specific interest rate on an adjustable-rate loan. The index plus the margin is the 
formula for determining the interest rate on an adjustable-rate mortgage.
Individual Retirement Account (IRA): A retirement account into which anyone with 
sufficient employment income or alimony may contribute up to $6,500 per year ($7,500 if 
age 50 or older). Based on your eligibility for other employer-based retirement programs 
and which type of IRA you select (regular/traditional or Roth), your contributions may be 
tax-deductible.
inflation: The technical term for a general rise in prices in the economy. Inflation usually 
occurs when too much money is in circulation and not enough goods and services are 
available to spend it on. As a result of this excess money, prices rise. A link is present 
between inflation and interest rates: If interest rates don’t keep up with inflation, no one 
will invest in bonds issued by the government or corporations. When the interest rates on 
bonds are high, it usually reflects a high rate of expected inflation that will eat away at 
your return.
initial public offering (IPO): The first time a company offers stock to the investing public. 
An IPO typically occurs when a company wants to expand more rapidly and seeks 
additional money to support its growth. A number of studies have demonstrated that 
buying into IPOs in which the general public can participate produces sub-par investment 
returns. A high level of IPO activity may indicate a cresting stock market, as companies 
and their investment bankers rush to cash in on a “pricey” marketplace. (IPO could stand 
for It’s Probably Overpriced.)Glossary 451
interest rate: The rate lenders charge you to borrow money. The higher the interest rate, 
the higher the risk entailed in the loan. With bonds of a given maturity, a higher rate of 
interest means a lower quality of bond — one that’s less likely to return your money.
international stock markets: Stock markets outside of the United States account for a 
significant portion of the world stock market capitalization (value). Some specific stock 
indices track international markets (see MSCI EAFE index and Emerging Markets Index). 
International investing offers one way for you to diversify your portfolio and reduce your 
risk. Some of the foreign countries with major stock exchanges outside the United States 
include Japan, Britain, France, Germany, and Canada.
junk bond: A bond rated Ba (Moody’s) or BB (Standard & Poor’s) or lower. Historically, 
these bonds have had a 1 to 2 percent chance of default, which is not exactly “junky.” 
Of course, the higher risk is accompanied by a higher interest rate.
leverage: Financial leverage affords its users a disproportionate amount of financial 
power relative to the amount of their own cash invested. In some circumstances, you can 
borrow up to 50 percent of a stock price and use all funds (both yours and those that you 
borrow) to make a purchase. You repay this so-called margin loan when you sell the stock. 
If the stock price rises, you make money on what you invested plus what you borrowed. 
Although this money sounds attractive, remember that leverage cuts both ways — when 
prices decline, you lose money not only on your investment but also on the money you 
borrowed.
limited partnership (LP): A private partnership, which is designed to limit the legal 
liability of the investors who participate, is often promoted in a way that promises high 
returns, but it generally limits one thing: your investment return. Why? Because it’s 
burdened with high commissions and management fees. Another problem is that it’s 
typically not liquid for many years.
load mutual fund: A mutual fund that includes a sales load, which is the commission paid 
to brokers who sell commission-based mutual funds. The commission typically ranges 
from 4 to 8.5 percent. This commission is deducted from your investment money, so it 
reduces your returns.
marginal tax rate: The rate of income tax you pay on the last dollars you earn over the 
course of a year. Why the complicated distinction? Because not all income is treated 
equally: You pay less tax on your first dollars of your annual earnings and more tax on the 
last dollars of your annual income. Knowing your marginal tax rate is helpful because it 
can help you analyze the tax implications of important personal financial decisions.
market capitalization: The value of all the outstanding stock of a company. Market 
capitalization is the quoted price per share of a stock multiplied by the number of shares 
outstanding. Thus, if Sam & Ella’s Chicken Subs Corporation has 100 million shares of 
outstanding stock and the quoted price per share is $20, the company has a market 
capitalization of $2 billion (100 million × $20).
Moody’s ratings: Moody’s rating service measures and rates the credit (default) risks of 
various bonds. Moody’s investigates the financial condition of a bond issuer. Its ratings 
use the following grading system, which is expressed from highest to lowest: Aaa, Aa, A, 
Baa, Ba, B, Caa, Ca, C. Higher ratings imply a lower risk but also mean that the interest 
rate will be lower.452 Personal Finance For Dummies
mortgage-backed bond (GNMAs and FNMAs): The Government National Mortgage 
Association (GNMA, or Ginnie Mae) specializes in mortgage-backed securities. It passes 
the interest and principal payments of borrowers to investors. When a homeowner makes 
a mortgage payment, GNMA deducts a small service charge and forwards the mortgage 
payments to its investors. The payments are guaranteed in case a borrower fails to pay 
their mortgage. The Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA or Fannie Mae) is a 
publicly owned, government-sponsored corporation that purchases mortgages from 
lenders and resells them to investors. FNMA mainly deals with mortgages backed by the 
Federal Housing Administration.
mortgage broker: Mortgage brokers buy mortgages wholesale from lenders and then 
mark the mortgages up (typically from 0.5 to 1 percent) and sell them to borrowers. 
A good mortgage broker is most helpful for people who don’t want to shop around on 
their own for a mortgage or people who have blemishes on their credit reports.
mortgage life insurance: Mortgage life insurance guarantees that the lender will receive 
its money in the event that you meet an untimely demise. Many people may try to 
convince you that you need this insurance to protect your dependents and loved ones. 
Mortgage life insurance is relatively expensive given the cost of the coverage provided. 
If you need life insurance, buy low-cost, high-quality term life insurance instead.
MSCI EAFE (Europe, Australia, Far East) index: The MSCI EAFE index tracks the 
performance of the more established countries’ stock markets in Europe and Asia. 
This index is important for international-minded investors who want to follow the 
performance of overseas stock investments.
municipal bond: A loan for public projects, such as highways and schools that an investor 
makes to cities, towns, and states. The tax-exempt status of their interest is what makes 
municipal bonds special: They’re exempt from federal taxes and, if you reside in the state 
where the bond is issued, state taxes. Because of that tax exclusion, municipal bonds are 
generally issued with interest rates that are lower than taxable corporate bonds of 
comparable credit quality. Municipal bonds are most appropriate for people in high tax 
brackets who invest money outside of tax-sheltered retirement accounts.
mutual fund: A portfolio of stocks, bonds, or other securities that is owned by numerous 
investors and managed by an investment company. See also no-load mutual fund.
National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation (NASDAQ) system:
An electronic network that allows brokers to trade from their offices all over the country. 
With NASDAQ, brokers buy and sell shares using constantly updated prices that appear on 
their computer screens.
negative amortization: Negative amortization occurs when your outstanding mortgage 
balance increases despite the fact that you’re making the required monthly payments. 
Negative amortization occurs with adjustable-rate mortgages that cap the increase in your 
monthly payment but do not cap the interest rate. Therefore, your monthly payments 
don’t cover all the interest that you actually owe. Avoid loans with this “feature.”
net asset value (NAV): The dollar value of one share of a mutual fund. For a no-load 
fund, the market price is its NAV. For a load fund, the NAV is the “buy” price minus the 
commission.Glossary 453
New York Stock Exchange (NYSE): The largest stock exchange in the world in terms of 
total volume and value of shares traded. It lists companies that tend to be among the 
oldest, largest, and best-known companies.
no-load mutual fund: A mutual fund that doesn’t come with a commission payment 
attached to it. Some funds claim to be no-load but simply hide their sales commissions as 
an ongoing sales charge; you can avoid these funds by educating yourself and reading the 
prospectuses carefully.
open-end mutual fund: A mutual fund that issues as many shares as investors demand. 
These open-end funds do not generally limit the number of investors or amount of money 
in the fund. Some open-end funds have been known to close to new investors, but 
investors with existing shares can often still buy more shares from the company.
option: The right to buy or sell a specific security (such as a stock) for a preset price 
during a specified period of time. Options differ from futures in that with an option, you 
pay a premium fee up front and you can either exercise the option or let it expire. If the 
option expires worthless, you lose 100 percent of your original investment. The use of 
options is best left to companies as hedging tools. Investment managers may use options 
to reduce the risk in their investment portfolio. As with futures, when most individual 
investors buy an option, they’re doing so as a short-term gamble, not as an investment.
pension: Pensions (also known as defined benefit plans) are a benefit offered by some 
employers. These plans generally pay you a monthly retirement income based on your 
years of service and former pay with the employer.
performance: You traditionally judge an investment’s performance by looking at the 
historic rate of return. The longer the period over which these numbers are tallied, the 
more useful they are. Considered alone, these numbers are practically meaningless. You 
must also note how well a fund has performed in comparison to competitors with the 
same investment objectives. Beware of advertisements that tout the high returns of a 
mutual fund, because they may not be looking at risk-adjusted performance, or they may 
be promoting performance over a short time period. Keep in mind that high return 
statistics are usually coupled with high risk and that this year’s star may turn out to be 
next year’s crashing meteor.
precertification: A condition for health insurance benefit coverage that requires a patient 
to get approval before being admitted to a hospital for nonemergency care.
preferred stock: Preferred stock dividends must be paid before any dividends are paid to 
the common stock shareholders. Although preferred stock reduces your risk as an 
investor (because of the more secure dividend and greater likelihood of getting your 
money back if the company fails), it also often limits your reward if the company expands 
and increases its profits.
price/earnings (P/E) ratio: The current price of a stock divided by the current (or 
sometimes the projected) earnings per share of the issuing company. This ratio is a widely 
used stock analysis statistic that helps an investor get an idea of how cheap or expensive 
a stock price is. In general, a relatively high P/E ratio indicates that investors feel that the 
company’s earnings are likely to grow quickly.454 Personal Finance For Dummies
prime rate: The rate of interest that major banks charge their most creditworthy 
corporate customers. Why should you care? Well, because the interest rates on various 
loans you may be interested in are often based on the prime rate. And, guess what — you 
pay a higher interest rate than those big corporations!
principal: No, I’m not talking about the big boss from elementary school who struck fear 
into the hearts of most 8-year-olds. The principal is the amount you borrow for a loan. If 
you borrow $100,000, your principal is $100,000. Principal can also refer to the amount 
you originally placed in an investment.
prospectus: Individual companies and mutual funds are required by the Securities and 
Exchange Commission to issue a prospectus. For a company, the prospectus is a legal 
document presenting a detailed analysis of that company’s financial history, its products 
and services, its management’s background and experience, and the risks of investing in 
the company. A mutual-fund prospectus tells you about the fund’s investment objectives, 
costs, risk, and performance history.
real-estate investment trust (REIT): Real-estate investment trusts are like a mutual fund 
of real estate investments. Such trusts invest in a collection of properties (from shopping 
centers to apartment buildings). REITs trade on the major stock exchanges. If you want to 
invest in real estate while avoiding the hassles inherent in owning property, real-estate 
investment trusts may be the right choice for you.
refinance: Refinance, or refi, is a fancy word for taking out a new mortgage loan (usually 
at a lower interest rate) to pay off an existing mortgage (generally at a higher interest 
rate). Refinancing is not automatic, nor is it guaranteed. Refinancing can also be a hassle 
and expensive. Weigh the costs and benefits of refinancing carefully before proceeding.
return on investment: The percentage of profit you make on an investment. If you put 
$1,000 into an investment and then one year later it’s worth $1,100, you make a profit of 
$100. Your return on investment is the profit ($100) divided by the initial investment 
($1,000) — in this case, 10 percent.
reverse mortgage: A reverse mortgage enables older homeowners, typically those who 
are low on cash, to tap into their home’s equity without selling their home or moving from 
it. Specifically, a lending institution makes a check out to you each month, and you can use 
the check as you want. This money is really a loan against the value of your home, so it’s 
tax-free when you receive it. The downside of these loans is that they deplete your equity 
in your estate, the fees and interest rates tend to be on the high side, and some require 
repayment within a certain number of years.
Russell 2000: An index that tracks the returns of 2,000 small-company U.S. stocks. Small￾company stocks tend to be more volatile than large-company stocks. If you invest in 
small-company stocks or stock funds, this index is an appropriate benchmark to compare 
your stock’s performance to.
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC): The federal agency that administers U.S. 
securities laws and regulates and monitors investment companies, brokers, and financial 
advisors.
simplified employee pension individual retirement account (SEP-IRA): Like other 
retirement plans, a SEP-IRA allows your money to compound over the years without the 
drain of taxes. SEP-IRAs are relatively easy to set up, and they allow self-employed people 
to make annual contributions on a pre-tax basis.Glossary 455
Social Security: If you’re retired or disabled, Social Security is a government safety net 
that can provide you with some income. The program is based on the idea that govern￾ment is responsible for the social welfare of its citizens. Whether you agree with this 
notion or not, part of your paycheck goes to Social Security, and when you retire, you 
receive money from the program.
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index: An index that measures the performance of 500 large￾company U.S. stocks that account for about 75 percent of the total market value of all 
stocks traded in the United States. If you invest in larger-company stocks or stock funds, 
the S&P 500 Index is an appropriate benchmark to compare the performance of your 
investments to.
Standard & Poor’s (S&P) ratings: Standard & Poor’s rating service is one of two services 
that measure and rate the risks in buying a bond. The S&P ratings use the following 
grading system, listed from highest to lowest: AAA, AA, A, BBB, BB, B, CCC, CC, C. See 
also Moody’s ratings.
stock: Shares of ownership in a company. When a company goes public, it issues shares 
of stock to the public (see also initial public offering). Many, but not all, stocks pay 
dividends — a distribution of a portion of the company’s profits. In addition to dividends, 
you make money investing in stock via appreciation in the price of the stock, which normally 
results from growth in revenues and corporate profits. You can invest in stock by purchas￾ing individual shares or by investing in a stock mutual fund that offers a diversified 
package of stocks.
term life insurance: If people are dependent on your income for their living expenses, 
you may need this insurance. Term life insurance functions simply: You determine how 
much protection you would like and then pay an annual premium based on that amount. 
Premium rates vary by age, health, and whether you smoke. Although much less touted 
by insurance salespeople than cash value insurance, it’s the best life insurance out there 
for the vast majority of people.
Treasury bill: IOUs from the federal government that mature within a year. The other 
types of loans that investors can make to the federal government are Treasury notes, 
which mature within one to ten years, and Treasury bonds, which mature in more than 
ten years. The interest that these federal government bonds pay is free of state taxes, but 
it’s federally taxable.
underwriting: The process an insurance company uses to evaluate a person’s likelihood 
of filing a claim on a particular type of insurance policy. If significant problems are 
discovered, an insurer will often propose much higher rates or refuse to sell the 
insurance coverage.
will: A legal document that ensures that your wishes regarding your assets and the care 
of your minor children are heeded when you die.
zero-coupon bond: A bond that doesn’t pay explicit interest during the term of the loan. 
Zero-coupon bonds are purchased at a discounted price relative to the principal value 
paid at maturity. Thus, the interest is implicit in the discount. These bonds do not offer a 
tax break, because the investor must pay taxes on the implicit interest that is paid when 
the bond matures.Index 457

Eric Tyson first became interested in money matters more than three decades ago. 
After his father was laid off during a recession and received some retirement 
money from his employer, Eric worked with his dad to make investing decisions 
with the money. A couple of years later, Eric won his high school’s science fair 
with a project on what influences the stock market.
After college and toiling away for a number of years as a management consultant 
to Fortune 500 financial-service firms, Eric finally figured out how to pursue his 
dream. He took his inside knowledge of the banking, investment, and insurance 
industries and committed himself to making personal financial management 
accessible to all.
Today, Eric is an internationally acclaimed and best-selling personal finance book 
author, syndicated columnist, speaker, and counselor. He has worked with and 
taught people from all financial situations, so he knows the financial concerns and 
questions of real folks just like you. Despite being handicapped by an MBA from 
the Stanford Graduate School of Business and BS degrees in economics and biol￾ogy from Yale University, Eric remains a master of “keeping it simple.”
In addition to being an award-winning columnist, he is the author of six national 
best-selling financial books in the For Dummies series, on personal finance, 
investing, mutual funds, home buying (co-author), taxes (co-author) and small 
business (co-author). A prior edition of this book was awarded the Benjamin 
Franklin Award for best business book of the year.
Eric’s work has been featured and quoted in hundreds of local and national pub￾lications, including Newsweek, the Wall Street Journal, the Los Angeles Times, the 
Chicago Tribune, Forbes, Kiplinger’s Personal Finance magazine, Parenting, Money, 
Family Money, and Bottom Line/Personal; on NBC’s Today Show, ABC, CNBC, FOX 
News, PBS Nightly Business Report, Fox Business, CNN, and on CBS national radio, 
NPR’s Sound Money, Bloomberg Business Radio, and Business Radio Network.

Dedication
This book is hereby and irrevocably dedicated to my family and friends, as well as 
to my counseling clients and customers, who ultimately have helped me to learn 
how to explain financial terms and strategies so that all of us may benefit.Author’s Acknowledgments
Being an entrepreneur involves endless challenges, and without the support and 
input of my good friends and mentors Peter Mazonson, Jim Collins, and my best 
friend and wife, Judy, I couldn’t have accomplished what I have.
I hold many people accountable for my perverse and maniacal interest in figuring 
out the financial services industry and money matters, but most of the blame falls 
on my loving parents, Charles and Paulina, who taught me most of what I know 
that’s been of use in the real world.
Many thanks to all the people who provided insightful comments on this edition 
and previous editions of this book, especially Dr. Mary Ann Campbell, Bill Urban, 
Barton Francis, Mike van den Akker, Gretchen Morgenson, Craig Litman, Gerri 
Detweiler, Mark White, Alan Bush, Nancy Coolidge, and Chris Jensen.
And thanks to all the wonderful people at my publisher on the front line and 
behind the scenes, especially Shannon Vargo, Steve Hayes, Tracy Boggier, and 
Linda Brandon.Publisher’s Acknowledgments
