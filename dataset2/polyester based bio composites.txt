Preface
Fiber-reinforced polymer composites with thermoset matrices such as epoxy, 
polyester, vinyl ester and bismaleimide resins have been used in widespread 
applications in the aerospace sector, automotive parts, construction and building 
materials, sports equipment and household appliances. Natural fiber-based poly￾ester composites have inferior thermal, physico-chemical and mechanical proper￾ties over the conventional synthetic fiber-reinforced polyester composites and is 
considered a potential substitute in applications requiring moderate strength and 
stiffness. Natural fibers have advantages such as superior damping characteristics, 
low density, biodegradability, abundant availability at low cost and non-abrasive to 
tooling, which makes them a cost-effective alternative reinforcement material for 
composites in certain applications.
This book highlights the performance of polyester-based biocomposites rein￾forced with various natural fibers and is organized in the following ways: Chapters 
1–8 focus on the characterization of polyester-based biocomposites reinforced 
with natural fibers extracted from leaf, stem, fruit bunch, grass and wood material. 
Chapters 9–12 address the characteristics of polyester-based biocomposites rein￾forced with rice husk fillers, various nanoparticles and two or more natural fibers, 
respectively. Chapters 13–16 highlight the suitability of the polyester-based biocom￾posites in various applications.
Each chapter of this book has been written by experts with publications. It is our 
pleasure to have worked with authors who are established researchers in the field of 
biocomposites and we express our gratitude to the publisher and their staff mem￾bers associated with this book support. The content in this book could be of help to 
undergraduate and postgraduate students, research scholars, academic researchers, 
professionals and scientists looking for fundamental knowledge on the characteriza￾tion of polyester-based biocomposites, latest research trends and the suitability of 
such composites in various applications.xi

1.1 INTRODUCTION
The material used in the construction of any object has been one of the most impor￾tant aspects of human civilization. The various construction materials that human 
beings have used include metals, ceramics, composites, polymers and other materi￾als. The usage and choice of material vary depending on various factors and have 
changed over time. A drastic change in the materials used in building artefacts 
occurred in the twentieth century with the era of polymers. Towards the end of 
the nineteenth century, synthetic polymers came up with their actual mass-scale 
usage started in the 1940s with the use of polymer-based composites involved in 
radar technology banking upon glass fibres/polyesters (Edwards, 1998; Skrifvars 
et al., 1998; Khan et al., 2002). The properties of products such as being strong, 
inexpensive, lightweight, versatile and having good barrier properties to carbon 
dioxide and oxygen make them comfortable, convenient and safe for our everyday 
lives (Senthilkumar et al., 2015; Alothman et al., 2020; Shahroze et al., 2021). The 
current worldwide plastic consumption is about 370 million tons (PlasticsEurope, 
2020), with annual growth in consumption of about 5% (Gupta et al., 2022). 
Polyolefins such as low- and high-density polyethylene and polypropylene (PP), 
along with polyesters such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET) are the most con￾sumed thermoplastics (Rabnawaz et al., 2017; Yeung et al., 2021). The class of 
materials under resin encompasses polystyrene, polyethylene, polyvinylchloride, 
PP, expandable polystyrene, etc. There are reports evaluating the market size of 
polymer resin as high as 100 billion dollars in 2018 and expected to register a 
Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of over 7% by the year 2030 (Polymer 
Resin Market Size, Share, Growth | Report, 2030).
The resin matrix is an important composite with two classes such as thermoplas￾tics and thermosets. Further classification could be made such as saturated polyester 
and unsaturated polyester. The larger class of these materials is the unsaturated poly￾ester which is about 75% of all polyester resins consumed. The class of resin which 
retains its solid state at ambient temperature and loses its solid state at elevated 
temperature is called thermoplastic. The inability of long-chain polymers not to 
cross-link chemically makes them unable to cure permanently, which rules out them 
from the structural application (Senthilkumar et al., 2021; Nasimudeen et al., 2021; 
Thomas et al., 2021; Senthilkumar et al., 2022). On the other side, a thermosetting 
resin will cure permanently by irreversible cross-linking at higher temperatures, 
making them very promising candidates for structural applications. The thermoset 
unsaturated polyester possesses a brittleness property which reduces its usability 
in many applications. An appropriate additive that disrupts the cross-linked chain

structure is used to improve the toughness of this material (Abral et al., 2020). The 
processing temperature and the amount of the catalyst concentration are critical to 
controlling the rate of polymerization kinetics. The temperature or the concentration 
of the catalyst varies with the rate of reaction. The reaction leading to the release of 
gases and causing voids in products is undesirable (Sheng et al., 2020). Due to the 
post-curing operation by heat treatment, the cross-linking increases subsequently 
elevating the glass transition temperature of the material. Post-cure temperature is 
an important factor governing the extent of cross-linking. The optimized tempera￾tures for such processes will ultimately impact the economic and environmental 
aspects (Silva et al., 2020).
There are several routes explored for manufacturing reinforced polyester matrix 
materials including hand lay-up, filament winding, sheet moulding, prepreg mould￾ing, resin transfer moulding, vacuum-assisted moulding and pultrusion (Kuppusamy 
et al., 2020). The preparation of polyester resin using zinc as a catalyst and phos￾phorous as a stabilizer is available in the literature (Lee et al., 2016). The type and 
amount of reactant and catalyst, monomers and curing temperature all are important 
in deciding the properties as well as the recovery of the polyester resin (An et al., 
2022; Zhang et al., 2021). Polyester resin materials are the topic of this chapter. 
Polymer matrix composites (PMCs) are introduced first and their manufacturing and 
reinforcing technologies are described in detail. Finally, the properties of such com￾posites are discussed, along with their future developments.
The overall growth in the usage of polymer materials in the automotive, elec￾tric vehicles, packaging, PVC bottles and containers, food and beverage industry is 
mainly driving the demand for the polymer market on account of the replacement of 
various metal and alloy parts (Thiagamani et al., 2022; Chandrasekar et al., 2022). 
The material is lightweight with mechanical strength and cost-effectiveness acts as 
the main cause behind such a huge demand in the market. The higher growth in 
lightweight electric vehicle manufacturing all over the world and favourable govern￾ment initiatives are going to further flourish the growth of the market. The basic 
required characteristics of polymer resins are optical, thermal and mechanical prop￾erties. These properties are commonly improved by curing and cross-linking with 
reinforcement material. There is a need for designing the polyester matrix in such a 
way that it carries the load satisfactorily and avoids fatigue failure (He et al., 2017; 
Towo and Ansell, 2008).
1.2 POLYMER MATRIX COMPOSITES
PMCs are preferred nowadays for various advanced and performance applications 
because of their excellent short-term and long-term mechanical and other proper￾ties as compared to the neat polymer at no additional cost (Miskolczi, 2013). PMCs 
find various advantageous applications in aviation, marine, automobile, structural, 
etc. In the 1940s, the first PMC based on polyester and glass fibre was used for 
radar application (Khan et al., 2002; Tabatabai et al., 2018). PMC is a synthetic 
combination of resin and reinforcement present physically at a microscopic level. 
The polymer matrix is a continuous phase which binds the reinforcement, transfers 
the load to the reinforcement and protects the reinforcement from the environment, 4 Polyester-Based Biocomposites
whereas the reinforcement is a discontinuous phase and imparts extra strength to 
the composite and enhances mechanical properties. Reinforcement distributes the 
transfer load provided by the matrix (Chandrasekar et al., 2020). PMCs possess a 
matrix of either thermoplastic or thermosetting polymer reinforced by a reinforc￾ing agent or fibre. They exhibit excellent strength and toughness with corrosion 
resistance properties. They have low cost, good mechanical properties and ease of 
fabrication. Also, they have good strength to weight ratio and specific properties 
because of the low density of its constituents (Askeland and Fulay 2003; Matthews 
and Rawlings, 1999).
PMCs exhibit higher specific strength, short-term and long-term mechanical 
properties such as tensile, elongation, flexural, impact, stiffness, creep, stress relax￾ation and fatigue characteristics, which enable the structural design to be more ver￾satile. The polymer matrix can be thermoplastic or thermosetting. Typical polymer 
matrices include unsaturated polyester, epoxy, phenolics, polyurethane, polyamide, 
acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, PP, etc. Due to the low density of the constituents, 
polymer composites often show excellent strength to weight ratio. Thermoplastic res￾ins are chain polymers and soften on increasing the temperature and degrade ther￾mally due to the breaking of the C–C bond at elevated temperatures. Thermosetting 
resins are cross-linked when heated. They get hardened when heated, and at the 
critical temperature, they start degrading. One of the major disadvantages of the 
thermosetting polymer matrix is the non-recyclability mechanically or chemically 
(Soutis, 2005; Manfredi et al., 2006).
1.3 POLYESTER MATRIX
1.3.1 Classification of Unsaturated Polyester Resin (UPR)
Unsaturated polyester is classified into ortho, iso, bisphenol-A fumarates and vinyl 
ester resins.
i. Ortho-UPRs: These are prepared using ortho-phthalic acids such as phthalic 
anhydride, maleic anhydride and glycerol. It has restricted thermal and 
chemical resistance properties. Ortho-UPR based on 1,2-propylene glycol 
lowers its crystallinity and improves its compatibility.
ii. Iso-UPRs: These are prepared using isophthalic acid, maleic anhydride and 
glycol. Due to its high viscosity, it requires a larger quantity of solvent. It 
has good chemical and thermal resistance with physical properties.
iii. Bisphenol-A fumarates UPR: These are prepared using bisphenol-A and 
fumaric acid. Due to the high raw material cost, this UPR is costly, but they 
possess excellent chemical, corrosion and thermal resistance properties as 
compared to iso- and ortho-UPR. Bisphenol-A is the main backbone chain 
rigidity to the final structure.
iv. Vinyl ester resins: These are prepared using acrylic acid or methacrylic acid 
and epoxy resin. It has high viscosity and requires a larger quantity of sty￾rene as a diluent to reduce the viscosity. It has good performance ability and 
corrosion resistance properties (Athawale and Pandit, 2019).Polyester Resins’ Use as Matrix Material in Polymer Composites 5
1.3.2 Preparation of Unsaturated Polyester Resins
In general, polyester resins can be synthesized from a dibasic organic acid and 
dihydric alcohol. They are classified as saturated polyesters, such as PET, and 
unsaturated polyesters (Deopura et al., 2008). Unsaturated polyesters contribute to 
about 75% consumption of all polyester resins used worldwide. It is advantageous 
due to its fast curing, good chemical resistance, electrical and mechanical proper￾ties, and comparatively low price to that of epoxy resin for various application 
areas. Due to its valuable properties, polyester has achieved continuous growth in 
its consumption worldwide at a rate of 4%–5% gain annually. It is one of the high￾est consumed polymer matrices for composite applications. Unsaturated polyester 
is the mostly used thermosetting resin for PMC. It has a low-melting-point, viscous 
and low-molecular-weight resin. It contains ester linkages in the main backbone 
chain. The presence of C=C makes it unsaturated and acts as a functional site for 
cross-linking. The C=C bond does not play a part in the polymerization reaction 
but takes part during cross-linking.
UPRs are condensation polymers formed by the reaction of polyols (also known 
as polyhydric alcohols), organic compounds with multiple alcohols or hydroxy func￾tional groups, with saturated or unsaturated dibasic acids at 180°C–220°C. The 
commonly used polyol is ethylene glycol; the acids used are phthalic and maleic 
acid. Water is eliminated as a by-product in this esterification reaction, which drives 
towards completion. Styrene is used as a diluent in UPRs to reduce its viscosity. 
The solidification of liquid resin takes place by a cross-linking mechanism with the 
help of curing agents. The curing mechanism includes forming a new free radical at 
unsaturated sites (C=C), which leads to propagation in a chain reaction to another 
unsaturated site in the adjacent molecule and linking it in the process. The addition 
of catalyst decomposes into free radicals which help to complete the cross-linking of 
unsaturated polyester.
Typically, organic peroxides such as benzoyl peroxide (BPO) or methyl ethyl 
ketone peroxide (MEKP) are used as a hardener to cure UPRs (Worzakowska, 2009). 
Benzoyl peroxide or MEKP was used at 1%–2% of the total amount of UPR to cure 
it exothermally. The curing agents should be used in a calculated amount only, as 
excessive quantity can lead to high exothermicity and impart brittleness in the mate￾rial. The brittleness may cause fractures in the cured resin even at low load condi￾tions (Hashemi et al., 2018) (see Figure 1.1).
To obtain the desired cross-linking in UPRs, styrene is used as a comonomer 
and contributes to the final properties of the resin. Curing causes a shrinking in the 
volume of UPR by 2%–5%. Generally, UPR to styrene ratio is maintained at 0.5 to 
obtain the best properties. Styrene acts as a diluent for UPR and avoids its gelling 
while storage. The solvent increases the curing rate after the addition of the initiator 
and accelerator. Initiator and accelerator are added with a concentration of 1%–2%. 
Cobalt octoate is the most widely used accelerator for curing UPR. The initial curing 
rate is slow and then increases rapidly to obtain the final cured structure (Figure 1.2).
The post-curing at higher temperatures may be required to increase the glass 
transition temperature by ensuring complete cross-linking and ultimately enhancing 
the mechanical properties of polyesters. Several factors such as molecular weight, 6 Polyester-Based Biocomposites
FIGURE 1.1 Synthesis of unsaturated polyester (Panda and Behera, 2019).
FIGURE 1.2 Curing mechanism of unsaturated polyester (Panda and Behera, 2019).Polyester Resins’ Use as Matrix Material in Polymer Composites 7
initiator and accelerator concentration affect the final properties of cured resins. The 
higher the molecular weight, the higher will be the point of unsaturation and the 
higher will be the strength of cured resins.
Various additives such as UV stabilizers, antioxidants and colourants can be added 
to UPRs to enhance properties. UPR is highly flammable and generates toxic gases 
after combustion. Halogenated compounds can be added to improve their fire resis￾tance properties. Fillers such as nanoclay, carbon nanotubes, magnesium hydroxide, 
nickel hydroxide, molybdenum disulphide, antimony oxide, gypsum particles and gra￾phene can be used to modify the properties of unsaturated polyesters (Hai et al., 2018).
The composition of monomers affects the final properties of polyester resins such 
as viscosity, reactivity and curing time, and mechanical and thermal properties. The 
advantageous properties of UPRs are good dimensional stability, chemical and ther￾mal resistance, ease of processing, corrosion resistance and low cost (Mustafa et al., 
2014; Kanimozhi et al., 2014). In a nutshell, UPRs have good structural and perfor￾mance abilities at an affordable cost. Table 1.1 depicts the important mechanical 
properties of unsaturated polyester.
1.4 MANUFACTURING OF POLYESTER COMPOSITES
The hand lay-up and compression moulding methods are the most common ones 
for fabricating thermosetting composite matrices. Spray-up, pultrusion, resin transfer 
moulding and vacuum bag moulding are some of the other methods available. These 
moulding processes are divided into two categories: open mould and closed mould.
1.4.1 Open Moulding
1.4.1.1 Spray-Up Method
The method of manufacture inspired the procedure’s name. A spray cannon is uti￾lized to place both the fibre and the resin into the mould in this production procedure. 
Rolling of the pre-layed resin and fibre preform is carried out to eliminate the bubbles 
entrapped within the resin since the likelihood of air bubble trapping is quite high. 
The type of resin used determines the curing process, which is usually done at room 
temperature. This fabrication technique is limited to composites.

The composites’ characteristics, particularly the tensile strength and elastic 
modulus, are anisotropic in this process. The skill of the operators determines the 
product’s quality (Kikuchi et al., 2014).
1.4.1.2 Hand Lay-Up
It is the most basic and well-known composites fabrication technique (Kozlowski 
et al., 2010). In comparison to other moulding or manufacturing methods, it requires 
a low-cost setup.
As a result, the initial investment in this process is minimal. The materials are 
fed into an open mould and left there until they reach the desired stable shape. The 
amount of time required is determined by the polymer’s characteristics. At room 
temperature, 24 hours is required for UPR manufacturing (Yahaya et al., 2015). This 
is a common fabrication method for thermosetting matrices. It is utilized to make a 
variety of car components (Kim et al., 2014).
1.4.2 Closed Moulding
1.4.2.1 Pultrusion
Pultrusion is a method of composite synthesis that produces a constant cross-section 
and production rate (Wiedmer and Manolesos, 2016). In this technique, fibres are 
drawn through a heated die. As the resin travels through the die, constant pressure is 
applied, allowing it to melt and impregnate the fibre reinforcement. The method of 
preheating, the temperature of the die, and the speed of the fibre passage all affect 
the quality of the produced goods.
1.4.2.2 Resin Transfer Moulding
In resin transfer moulding, the resin is transferred into a closed die under pressure. 
This method can create intricate parts with a smooth finish all over (Wulfsberg et al., 
2014). A technique with a short cycle time in a temperature-controlled system can 
achieve any required thickness. A vacuum inside the mould cavity controls the resin 
flow. Resin transfer mouldings can be used to successfully produce hybrid compos￾ites (Pearce et al., 2000).
1.4.2.3 Compression Moulding
Compression moulding is used to make UPR-based composites. The reinforcement 
and thermosetting resin are sandwiched within two matching die/moulds (one male, 
one female), and then the pressure (up to 2000 psi) and temperature (up to 200°C) are 
applied, followed by the system being left for a particular amount of time to cure the 
material. This approach also includes room-temperature curing. The type of curing is 
determined by the resin’s nature, as well as the sample’s shape, size and thickness. The 
moulded product is taken from the mould after curing. For easy composite release, a 
releasing agent is applied before the preform is placed in the die (Wulfsberg et al., 2014).
1.4.2.4 Vacuum Bag Moulding
A variant of the hand lay-up method, vacuum bag moulding is a process that pro￾vides mechanical pressure to a laminate throughout its cure cycle. This procedure Polyester Resins’ Use as Matrix Material in Polymer Composites 9
is important for removing trapped air within the laminates, which helps to keep the 
fibres in the appropriate orientation during curing and reduces the moisture content 
to improve the fibre to resin ratio within the composite (Levy and Hubert, 2019).
1.5 REINFORCEMENT USED IN UNSATURATED POLYESTER RESIN
It is one of the fundamental constituents of the PMC. Reinforcement is a discon￾tinuous phase and adds extra strength to the composite. Reinforcement distributes 
the transfer load provided by the matrix. Different types of organic and inorganic 
reinforcing agents are used to prepare PMC. The PMC can be classified based on the 
reinforcement as shown in Figure 1.3.
1.5.1 Natural Fibre Reinforcement
Natural fibre-reinforced unsaturated polyester exhibits comparable mechanical prop￾erties with synthetic reinforcing agents. The main drawback of the natural fibre is 
that it is hydrophilic due to the presence of cellulosic content. Also, they need some 
chemical treatment to improve the interfacial properties with the polymer matrix 
and obtain enhanced mechanical properties (Da Silva et al., 2008). Different natural 
fibres such as banana, jute, hemp, sisal and coir are used effectively with UPR to 
obtain its composite.
FIGURE 1.3 Classification of composites based on reinforcement (Devaraju and Alagar, 
2019).10 Polyester-Based Biocomposites
1.5.2 Banana Fibre
It is a natural biodegradable reinforcing agent. It contains cellulose and hemicel￾lulose. It requires chemical treatment to remove lignin and unwanted components 
which can affect the adhesion with the unsaturated polyester. Banana fibres can be 
used up to 40% volume fraction of UPRs. Composites based on banana fibres can 
be  fabricated using the hand lay-up technique and resin transfer moulding. They 
exhibits good mechanical properties (Pothan et al., 2016).
1.5.3 Coir Fibre
It is obtained from coconut shells. It is also biodegradable and possesses cellulosic 
content of about 36%. It also contains 41%–45% of lignin and therefore requires 
alkali treatment to remove it. Due to the high microfibril angle, it has limited use and 
application with UPR. However, it requires surface treatment to achieve mechanical 
properties (Biswas et al., 2019).
1.5.4 Jute Fibre
It is biodegradable and contains cellulose. It can be reinforced up to 60% with UPR. 
Jute fibre-based composites are fabricated by hand lay-up or compression moulding. 
Jute along with glass fibres can be used to prepare a hybrid composite of thermo￾setting polyester. Jute fibres also require alkali treatment to improve the wettabil￾ity with UPR and ultimately to achieve developed interfacial properties with the 
polymer matrix. The hybrid composite of jute, glass fibre and UPR can exhibit good 
mechanical properties.
1.6 SYNTHETIC FIBRE REINFORCEMENT
Various synthetic fibres such as glass, carbon and aramid can be used efficiently with 
UPR. Glass fibre and carbon fibre can be used together to obtain its hybrid composite 
with UPR. The hybrid composite has outstanding fatigue resistance and strength to 
weight ratio (Jain and Lee, 2012).
1.6.1 Glass Fibre
Glass fibres are the majorly used reinforcement with UPR. It is inorganic and may 
help to improve its mechanical, electrical, thermal and other properties. The glass 
fibres bear good interfacial properties with UPR. Their composites have good 
strength to weight ratios and impact resistance, and they are better than many other 
polymer-based composite materials. Also, they exhibit good electrical properties, 
resistance to weather, moisture, heat and chemicals coupled with ease of fabrication. 
Glass fibre as reinforcement has been known and used for centuries. The raw mate￾rial of glass fibres is silica, sand, limestone, boric acid and other minor ingredients 
(e.g. clay, coal and fluorspar); the temperature of this melt is different for each glass 
type but is generally about 2300°F (1260°C). It has different types such as A, E, S, Polyester Resins’ Use as Matrix Material in Polymer Composites 11
C and D. A-glass fibre is a soda-lime silicate containing fibre possessing excellent 
strength, durability and good electrical resistance properties. E-glass fibres have 
a calcium aluminoborosilicate composition with maximum alkali content of 2%. 
They are used when strength and high electrical resistivity are required and are 
the most common fibre glasses used in composites. E-glass is inexpensive in com￾parison to the other glasses used for composites. S-glass has better retention of 
properties at elevated temperatures. S-glass is mostly used in advanced composites 
where strength is a premium. C-glass has a soda-lime borosilicate composition and 
because of its chemical stability, it is used in corrosive environments. D-glass fibres 
contain borosilicate having low dielectric constant and are used for electrical appli￾cations (Tables 1.2 and 1.3).

1.6.2 Aramid Fibres
They are obtained from aromatic polyamides. They are also known as Kevlar fibre. 
Kevlar fibres have different grades such as Kevlar 29, Kevlar 49 and Kevlar 149. 
Kevlar fibres have excellent creep and fatigue resistance. UPRs with Kevlar fibre can 
be used for structural applications. To improve the interfacial properties between 
aramid fibres and UPRs, coupling agents are used (Tuttle, 2003).
1.6.3 Carbon Fibres
Carbon fibres are available in different shapes and sizes, i.e. short or continuous. Its 
structure can be crystalline or partially crystalline. The carbon atoms are bonded by 
a covalent bond. They possess high modulus. Commercially, carbon fibres are syn￾thesized using polyacrylonitrile and contain 92% carbon. Carbon fibres have a tensile 
strength in the range of 1310–2480MPa, whereas the modulus of elasticity varies 
from 230 to 620GPa. Their density is in the range of 1.8–2.1 gm/cm3 (Chung, 1994).
1.7 PROPERTIES OF POLYESTER COMPOSITES
1.7.1 Thermal Properties of Polyester Composites
The availability of a wide variety of raw materials along with the manufacturing 
techniques makes it convenient to tune the properties of the polyester composites to 
a greater extent. For various applications such as electrical, naval, automotive and 
electronics, their thermal properties are of utmost importance. Therefore, studying 
the thermal parameters such as their degradation behaviour, thermal stability, tech￾niques to improve their thermal stability and factors affecting it helps in tailoring the 
properties of the polyester composite materials.
Several studies showed that the thermal degradation of UPRs takes place in two 
to three stages (Evans et al., 1996; Skinner et al., 1984; Satdive et al., 2020; Kicko￾Walczak, 2004; Anderson and Freeman, 1959; Ravey, 1983). During the first stage, 
at around 200°C, phthalic anhydride is eliminated and is present in the resins which 
have ortho-phthalic moieties in their structure (Skinner et al., 1984; Kicko-Walczak, 
2004; Satdive et al., 2020). Also, at elevated temperatures, phthalic anhydride con￾tinues to form (Bautista et al., 2017). Generally, Anderson and Freeman’s mechanism 
for the decomposition of polyester is considered over the mechanism proposed by 
Ravey and Sivasamy (Ravey, 1983; Anderson and Freeman, 1959; Sivasamy et al., 
1992). The Anderson and Freeman’s mechanism states that the degradation initi￾ates closer to the ester group via homolytic cleavage and the formation of free radi￾cals. Later, bond rearrangement and hydrogen reaction yield phthalic anhydride and 
hydroxy ester molecules as shown in Figure 1.4a and b.
In the course of the second and third stages of UPR degradation, the cleavage of 
cross-links as well as weak links present in the linear chain takes place and subsequently 
linear chain scission (Evans et al., 1996; Skinner et al., 1984; Satdive et al., 2020; Kicko￾Walczak, 2004; Anderson and Freeman, 1959; Ravey, 1983; Bautista et al., 2017). The 
derivative thermogravimetry curves depict these stages to be around 350°C and 390°C.Polyester Resins’ Use as Matrix Material in Polymer Composites 13
Several studies show that as a result of UPR thermal degradation styrene emerges 
as the most abundant product while phthalic anhydride emerges as the prevalent deg￾radation component of the polyester backbone (Evans et al., 2000). For the relevant 
commercial polyester thermosets, the degradation products were found to be 55%–70% 
for these two items. The degradation of polystyrene cross-links produces ethylbenzene, 
methyl styrene, benzaldehyde, benzene, 1,3-diphenyl propane, 1,2-diphenylethane/1,2-
diphenylethene, toluene, styrene dimer and trimer, and phenylacetaldehyde, according 
to most research. These products were found in concentrations of up to 3%. Propylene 
glycol, maleic anhydride, acetaldehyde, acetone, allyl alcohol, benzaldehyde, etc. were 
discovered as polyester degradation products (Spasojevic, 2019).
The structure of prepolymer, curing procedure, amount of styrene, type and filler 
content along with other additives, climatic conditions, etc. all affect the thermal 
properties of UPR composite materials. By increasing the length of the glycol’s car￾bon chain, UPR’s thermal stability improves marginally. Straight-chain glycol-based 
UPRs were shown to be more stable than branched glycol-based UPRs. In glycols with 
β-hydrogen, the thermal stability of the resins was also reduced (propylene glycol and 
1,3-butanediol). The addition of the ether group reduced thermal stability, but ether 
glycol resins were still more stable than branched glycols with β-hydrogen. When com￾pared to ortho-phthalate, both the iso- and terephthalate esters demonstrated improved 
thermal stability. The UPR made from maleic anhydride, neopentyl glycol and isoph￾thalic acid had the best thermal stability, implying that the lack of β-hydrogen and 
ortho-phthalate structures improves thermal stability (Evans et al., 1996; Hiltz, 1988; 
Bansal et al., 1989). Bansal et al. investigated how the curing regime affected the ther￾mal characteristics of three UPRs (general-purpose resin, isophthalic acid-based and 
bisphenol-A-based). The resins were cured using three different methods: (1) 1% BPO 
at 120°C for half an hour, (2) 1% BPO at 85°C for 4hours and (3) 1% MEKP at room 
temperature for 24hours followed by heating at 85°C for 3hours. The resins treated 
with MEKP were found to be more stable than the resins cured with BPO. Resins cured 
with BPO at 120°C were also more stable than those cured at 85°C.
FIGURE 1.4 Anderson and Freeman’s mechanism explaining the phthalic anhydride for￾mation (Spasojevic, 2019).14 Polyester-Based Biocomposites
The presence of clay fillers in the UPR matrix also impacts the thermal sta￾bility of the composite materials. George et al. showed that heat is resisted by 
intercalated nanoclay platelets scattered throughout the UPR matrix. Inorganic 
platelets help to create char on the nanocomposite’s surface, which slows fur￾ther decomposition due to heat and raises the barrier for degradation products 
to escape into the bulk (George et al., 2016). Several studies on bio-based fillers 
and reinforcements have been published in recent years. Natural fibre composites’ 
significant flammability, caused by hydrocarbon polymers and flammable fibres, 
is one of their key drawbacks for engineering applications, particularly in aero￾space and building interiors (Satdive et al., 2022). When UPR and other natural 
fibre (flax, sisal, jute) composites were compared to UPR glass fibre composites 
in terms of thermal degradation and fire resistance, the glass fibre composites 
outperformed the biocomposites in terms of flame resistance. Sisal fibre com￾posites had the highest fire risk among natural fibre composites, while jute fibre 
composites had a short-duration fast-growing fire and flax fibre composites had a 
slow-growing long-duration fire (Manfredi et al., 2006).
1.7.2 Rheological Properties of Polyester Composites
Many intricate and intriguing flow parameters governed by the UPRs limit their 
possible application. Thus, it is critical to comprehend the link between the UP 
composite structure and its rheological properties. Some manufacturing techniques, 
such as sheet moulding compound (SMC) and bulk moulding compound (BMC), 
require increasing the viscosity of the input material or thickening the feed mate￾rial. High viscosity improves sheet-like structure stability, eases handling before 
moulding, improves fibre carrying during moulding and lowers fibre segregation 
and polymerization shrinkage (Kia, 1993). To ensure good mixing and reinforce￾ment wetting, the feed material’s viscosity should be minimal during the early mix￾ing process. During thickening, the compound viscosity should rapidly increase. To 
provide a long shelf life and dimensional consistency, it should remain constant. A 
higher viscosity is preferred throughout the moulding process than at the start to 
allow for better fibre-carrying capability. Alternatively, lower viscosity is required 
near the end of the mould-filling step to ensure proper filling of the mould cavity’s 
details and corners. Group II metal oxides and hydroxides are the oldest and most 
commonly used thickening systems. A tiny dose of these agents could raise the 
viscosity of the system above 105 mPa s (Rodriguez, 1987). The fundamental disad￾vantage of alkali metal thickeners is that the thickening process is quite slow. Alkali 
metal thickeners are also susceptible to humidity. As a result, alternative thickening 
techniques have been developed previously.
Diisocyanates formed within the UPR can also be thickened the SMC or BMC 
paste, generating a network capable of greatly increasing paste viscosity (Gawdzik 
et  al., 2000; Valette and Hsu, 1999; Xu et al., 1994). When compared to metal 
oxides or hydroxides, diisocyanates thicken much faster. The viscosity of the thick￾ened compound is stable and reaches maximum viscosity in hours rather than days 
(Orgéas and Dumont, 2012). Polyurethane molecules improve the toughness of the 
cured SMC components as well (Xu et al., 1994).Polyester Resins’ Use as Matrix Material in Polymer Composites 15
1.7.3 Mechanical Properties of Polyester Composites
The indentation properties of UPR-based composites are excellent. The primary 
quality achieved through indentation is hardness. Indentations are divided into two 
categories: macro/micro indentation and nanoindentation. Vickers hardness and 
Shore hardness are the most common indentations for polymer composites. Many 
parameters can be measured in the case of nanoindentation, including storage modu￾lus, loss factor, coefficient of friction, loss factor, recovery index, creep, coefficient 
of friction and so on. The nanoindentation method can be used to determine the 
mechanical properties of thermosetting matrices and cell wall layers of natural fibre 
(Wang et al., 2015). Nanoindentation on the nanoscale can be used to assess the 
interfacial mechanical properties of multilayered natural fibre-reinforced UPR com￾posites. The plant or natural fibre, unlike homogenous synthetic fibre, is a multi￾layered structure that can be successfully subjected to nanoindentation experiments 
(Diederichs and Bykov, 2010).
The dispersed phase geometry has a big impact on the tensile characteristics of 
natural fibre-reinforced composites (Jiang et al., 2018). According to a study, jute/
polyester composites offer greater strength and stiffness than wood composites and 
some polymers, although their mechanical properties are not comparable to those of 
typical composites (Weil and Levchik, 2016). The alteration of the dispersed phase to 
make it compatible with thermosetting matrices is another crucial factor. Chemical 
treatment of the matrix and the dispersed phase is possible, but in most situations, 
the latter is transformed by appropriate surface treatment. The tensile characteristics 
of thermosetting polyester resin composites are greatly improved by this modifica￾tion (Andre et al., 1993). The impact qualities are primarily determined by the filler’s 
toughness, interfacial adhesion between the filler and matrix, and filler loading (Yu 
et al., 2016). The impact strength of fibre/clay/UPR composites is influenced by the 
interaction between the constituent phases. Fibre/clay/UPR composites have a higher 
impact strength than fibre/UPR composites. Filler inclusion greater than 25% causes 
agglomeration, which reduces the ability of load transmission from matrix to rein￾forcement, lowering the overall impact strength (Song et al., 2008).
1.7.4 Curing Properties of Polyester Composites
Depending on the initiator type used, UPRs can be cross-linked via thermal or pho￾toinitiation. During curing, unsaturated monomers (typically styrene) function as 
diluent and viscosity modifiers while polyester monomers or oligomers react with 
one another. Curing occurs via several exothermal reaction pathways that result 
in the creation of a three-dimensional network and solidification, including (1) the 
unsaturated monomer (usually styrene) and the polyester are cross-linked intermo￾lecularly, (2) reactions between the unsaturated monomers, (3) unsaturated polyester 
branching using an unsaturated monomer, and (4) unsaturated monomer homopoly￾merization. All of these activities have an impact on curing kinetics, but their effects 
on the final resin structure differ (Gonçalves et al., 2017; Davis, 2019). By connecting 
nearby polyester molecules in reaction 1, a macroscopic network is formed. Reaction 
2 enhances cross-link density but has little effect on the creation of macroscopic 16 Polyester-Based Biocomposites
networks. Reactions 3 and 4 enhance the size of the polymer coil but have minimal 
effect on the total macroscopic network (Gonçalves et al., 2017). Understanding cur￾ing mechanisms as a function of composition and curing circumstances is critical 
to accomplishing optimum curing, process control during fabrication, stresses on 
reinforcing components and die part surfaces, and optimum bulk characteristics in 
the completed part (Torre et al., 2013; Baran et al., 2014). One of the most prevalent 
ways of monitoring curing is in Differential Scanning Calorimeter (DSC) Rheology, 
however, is very beneficial because the development of viscoelastic properties while 
curing is related to both dynamic changes in chemical structure and the mechanical 
properties of the cured resin. During isothermal curing, the cross-linked polymer’s 
viscosity increases until it forms an infinite network and gelation, or the transition 
from a viscous liquid to a rubbery solid occurs. Knowing the gelation time for a cer￾tain material and set of curing conditions is critical since any fibre impregnation or 
shaping activities must take place before gelation. Reactions continue after gelation 
but are severely constrained due to the high viscosity of the system until it reaches 
the vitrification point, at which point it becomes a stiff glass with few to no more 
reactions possible (Halley and Mackay, 1996).
1.8 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE TRENDS
UPRs are known to have less flame-retardant efficiency and compatibility with tradi￾tional flame retardants. This makes it difficult to make the synthesized matrix with￾stand extreme conditions such as high temperatures and radiation exposure. These 
materials can offer better properties than conventional structural materials in certain 
applications. The evolved matrix based on UPR materials has low maintenance costs 
and can be recycled their whole life. UPRs are the choice materials in the applica￾tions of fibres, plastics, composites, coatings, transportation industry, shipbuilding 
and construction engineering, among many others. The growing demands in the 
automotive sector have led to increasing investment. This growth along with the 
increasing adoption of electric vehicles warrants the need for lightweight materi￾als. These materials need to overcome the hurdles of petroleum-derived dependency 
via exploring sustainable synthesizing routes. The replacement of conventional com￾posite materials is gaining importance with the use of bio-based UPRs and other 
blended formulations. Newer recipes of UPRs using bio-modifiers and synthesizing 
biocomposites are providing promising results. Specific applications such as UPR￾based products satisfying the desired mechanical properties demonstrating flame￾retardant properties, UPR-based 4D printing, and enhancing mechanical properties 
per unit density for aerospace and automotive applications are some of the contem￾porary research directions. The bio-based and nanocomposite UPRs competing with 
the products realized from petrochemical routes in the parameters such as glass tran￾sition temperatures, tensile modulus, strength and viscosity are being reported. The 
dependence on the properties of cured resin as a function of thermal ageing is critical 
from the application point of view. The environmental concerns to reducing or elimi￾nating health hazards associated with involved emissions are significant. Such scien￾tific efforts will help in contributing to fuel efficiency and reducing carbon footprint. 
Recycling polymer waste to derive UPRs and retain their employable properties is a 
research avenue that needs to be explored.Polyester Resins’ Use as Matrix Material in Polymer Composites 17

2.1 INTRODUCTION
The innumerable problems created by the production, disposal and recycling 
of synthetic fibres have urged researchers to find natural fibres as alternatives. 
Natural fibres are gaining vast acceptance due to their eco-friendly nature, admi￾rable physical and mechanical properties, ease of availability, safe handling and 
biodegradable nature. Natural fibres especially lignocellulosic fibres are mostly 
used as excellent reinforcements in thermoplastic resin matrices such as polyester 
(PE), polypropylene, polyethylene and polyvinyl chloride (Venkata Deepthi et al., 
2019). This is because of their attractive properties such as relatively low density 
and abrasiveness, high filling levels offering high stiffness, recyclability and high 
bending resistance. Based on the site of extraction, fibres exhibit differing inherent 
properties. Natural fibres are usually extracted from leaves, stems, seeds, fruits and 
bast. The fibres extracted from the leaves offer improved toughness in composite 
matrices, whereas the fibres obtained from seeds or fruit provide elastomeric prop￾erties to the matrix (Sisti et al., 2018). The natural fibres used for such purposes

includes kenaf, banana, jute, oil palm, cotton, flax, hemp, sisal and pineapple leaf 
fibres (PALFs).
Among these natural fibres, PALF obtained from the leaf of the pineapple plant pos￾sesses the highest cellulose content and low microfibrillar angle which attributes to its 
increased tensile strength. Pineapple is a herbaceous and perennial plant which bears the 
most unique and exotic fruit (d’Eeckenbrugge et al., 2011). One of the interesting facts 
about this plant is that its cultivation yields more leaves than fruits. Hence, during post 
fruit harvesting procedures of pineapple, huge bundles of pineapple leaves are discarded 
as agro-wastes, which is later exploited for manufacturing textiles, papers and compos￾ites utilizing leaf fibres (Senthilkumar et al., 2015, 2021, 2022; Alothman et al., 2020).
PALF is one of the most common and abundantly available waste materials in 
South-east Asia, India and South America and is the least exploited natural fibre. 
PALF is an excellent material which can be used as a reinforcing agent in ther￾moset, thermoplastic, rubber and biodegradable polymer composites. Also, research 
has revealed that its abundance and ease of availability, acoustic insulation, good 
thermal, mechanical and physical properties and chemical constituents are attrac￾tive features ensuring their intensive application in textile industry, paper making, 
food packaging and development of composites (Shahroze et al., 2021; Nasimudeen 
et al., 2021; Thomas et al., 2021). This chapter gives an overview of pineapple plant 
morphology, species and cultivation, along with a brief description of the extraction 
process and present and future applications of PALFs. This chapter also discusses on 
the various factors of pineapple leaves that favours development of PALF-reinforced 
PE composites with improved properties. Also, a section briefing the various applica￾tions of PALF-reinforced PE composites is also included.
2.2 PINEAPPLE SPECIES AND PLANT MORPHOLOGY
Pineapple is one of the most common commercially grown fibre crops. Thailand 
and Philippines are the leading producers of PALF followed by Brazil, Hawaii, 
Indonesia, West Indies and India. Pineapple plant, also known as Ananas comosus
L. Merr., belongs to the subclass monocotyledons and family Bromeliaceae (Collins, 
1949). It is a non-climacteric, perennial plant, which is cultivated in tropical and sub￾tropical countries under humid climate in abundant amount. The plant has a height 
of 0.75–1.5m and 0.9–1.2m leaf spread and the central stem contains flower buds 
developing into fruit at the tip. The pineapple fruit has phyllotaxy leaves on top, thick 
skin with scales, and juicy pulp inside (Bartholomew et al., 2003; Pandit et al., 2020). 
Figure 2.1 shows the features of a pineapple plant.
Pineapple fruit is generally used for fresh consumption and can also be consumed 
in canned, frozen or dried form (Siow and Lee, 2016). Pineapple can also be used 
for making juice and concentrates and can also be processed into a variety of value￾added products such as jam, preserve and candy, sauce, jelly, vinegar, squash, Ready￾to-Serve (RTS) beverage, chutney and pickles (Dorta and Sogi, 2016). Based on the 
plant growth, phenotypic characteristics, sweetness and flavours of the fruit, four 
important categories of pineapple cultivars include Smooth Cayenne, Queen, Spanish 
and Abacaxi. Different cultivars of the plant display variation in fruit sweetness, fla￾vour and phenotypic characteristics. Smooth Cayenne variety is characterised by 
smooth spineless leaves and is resistant to bugs, fruit collapse and heart rot disease. Pineapple Fibre-Reinforced Polyester Composites 27
Queen is the most sweet and flavourful variety and hence cultivated for fresh con￾sumption. Spanish cultivar is characterised by spiny purplish leaves, bearing small, 
aromatic fruits weighing 1–2kg and is the best for canning purpose, as the fruits 
are highly sweet and aromatic (Thiagamani et al., 2022; Chandrasekar et al., 2022; 
Chandrasekar et al., 2020). This cultivar is mainly cultivated in the coastal areas of 
Central and South America. The pineapple variety seen in Brazil is the Abacaxi, 
which has tall/long fruits with narrow spiny leaves (Bartholomew et al., 2003).
Each adult plant will have around 80 leaves, of varying size and shape, measuring 
approximately 90–150 cm length and 2–3-inch width. The leaves will be dark green 
in colour, waxy, long, thin, sword-shaped and point-tipped with sharp spines at the 
border (Mishra et al., 2004; Pandit et al., 2020; Senthilkumar et al., 2019b). So, when 
cultivated in large scale, there would be large volumes of post-harvest waste that are 
usually discarded as agro-waste.
2.3 LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA) OF PALF
PALF, being a natural fibre, is biodegradable and sustainable. Figure 2.2 shows the 
life cycle of PALF. Pineapple is cultivated in large scale, and after harvest, the leaves 
are decorticated in the decorticating machine to separate the PALF from the biomass. 
The leaf fibre obtained is then purified to undergo industrial processing using needlepunch 
FIGURE 2.1 Pineapple plant with leaves and fruit.28 Polyester-Based Biocomposites
technology and is converted into nonwoven textiles. This nonwoven pineapple fibre tex￾tiles can be easily dyed with direct, reactive, vat and azo dyes with much fastness com￾pared to cotton. This textile is used to make fashionable apparels, accessories, home 
interiors, automotive and aeronautics interior parts. These commodities being biodegrad￾able can be easily disposed of without causing any degradation problems. At the same 
time, the biomass left can be used as a compost for future pineapple cultivation.
2.4 PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL FEATURES 
OF PINEAPPLE LEAF FIBRE
Pineapple cultivation yields more pineapple leaves besides pineapple fruit. So, it is 
very necessary to find a solution to make this agro-waste productive. PALF is the 
most delicate fibre among all vegetable fibres. It has a ribbon-like structure, and has 
a vascular bundle system. Pineapple fibres are 60cm long and can easily retain dif￾ferent classes of dyes. It is ten times coarser than cotton fibre. About 2.5–3.3wt % of 
fibre can be extracted from green leaves. PALF is made up of 70%–82% α-cellulose, 
hemicelluloses, 5%–12% lignin and 1.1% ash. It is lightweight, easy to care and looks 
like linen (Pandit et al., 2020). The high-cellulose type I content and low microfi￾brillar angle impart to its better mechanical properties (Satyanarayana et al., 1986). 
Fine PALF possess excellent mechanical properties such as tensile strength and ten￾sile modulus. They are highly hygroscopic in nature and are also abrasion-resistant. 
Other attractive features of PALF include excellent thermal and acoustic insulation, 
and high toughness (www.ananas). Table 2.1a summarises the physical properties 
of PALF, Table 2.1b lists the chemical composition of PALF and Table 2.1c lists the 
chemical composition of processed PALF (Franck, 2005).

2.5 METHODS OF EXTRACTION OF PALF
Removal of epidermal tissue of pineapple leaves can yield strong, white lustrous 
silky fibres that can be spun into fine textile yarn on jute and on cotton spinning 
system (Vincent et al., 2016). Usually, freshly harvested green leaf bundles are 
used for fibre extraction. The Perolera cultivar of pineapple in the Caribbean area 
possesses long leaves, which is considered highly suitable for fibre extraction. PALF 
can be extracted either by manual methods such as scraping/hand stripping pro￾cess or mechanically using a decorticator. The choice of the extraction process is 
extremely important as it determines the quality and quantity of fibres (Kengkhetkit 
and Amornsakchai, 2012). Each extraction method influences the structure, chemi￾cal composition and physical properties of the fibres.
The manual method of extraction is considered more preferable than extraction 
by decorticator, but the yield of fibre is very less. The decorticated fibres may usually 
contain waxy substance and fleshy leafy parts. Hence, after extraction with decor￾ticator, the fibrous strands have to be split out by retting and degumming methods. 
The difference in the yield and quality of PALF are listed in Table 2.2.
2.5.1 Manual Extraction Methods
2.5.1.1 Hand Stripping/Scraping
Hand stripping or scraping process is a conventional method of PALF extraction, which 
is done manually by scraping the fibres of small pineapple leaf using a scrapping tool 
called ‘ketam’ or using broken porcelain plate or coconut shell in case of longer leaves 
(Kannojiya et al., 2013). An expert worker can scrap over 500 leaves per day and extract 
fibres, which can be water-washed and dried in air. The fibres are later waxed to remove 
any entanglements and knot them. The knotting process ends up in separation of fibres 
from each other and is knotted at the tips to form a long continuous yarn. Even though 
good-quality fibres are yielded through this process, it is a highly laborious process and

needs manpower of 30 persons per ton of leaves (Jose et al., 2016). Figure 2.3 shows the 
different steps of hand scraping method for PALF extraction.
2.5.1.2 Retting Process
The next step in manual process of PALF extraction is retting process, which is of 
three types: water, bacterial and dew retting.
Water retting includes soaking the PALFs in water for about 20 days until it gets 
saturated. This retting process is usually preformed in water bodies such as ponds, 
ditches, tanks or rivers. During this process, the pectic substances are dissolved by 
the action of microorganisms, which leads to separation of the fibre from the cortex, 
resulting in clean fibres. The bacteria such as Bacillus and Clostridium are found to 
enhance water retting process. The extracted fibre is then washed under running tap 
water and then sun-dried (Yusof et al., 2015). This is a time-consuming process, and 
moreover, during this process, large amount of water is consumed; hence, it is not 
considered as an eco-friendly process.
In bacterial retting, the crushed leaves are placed in bacterial culture solution. As 
a result of the bacterial action, the fibres can be easily removed from the fleshy mass 
of leaves and extraction can be completed within 4–5 days. Also, during bacterial 
retting, the non-fibrous matter like hemicellulose is converted to α-cellulose, leading 
to the yield of high-quality fibres with good tensile strength. So, this process is less 
time-consuming compared to water retting process, but bacterial retting method is 
not commercialised yet (Cueto et al., 1978).
FIGURE 2.3 Hand stripping/scrapping method of PALF extraction. (Source: Adapted and 
modified from Yusof et al. (2015). Copyright © 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.)32 Polyester-Based Biocomposites
Another method is dew retting, fungi such as Rhizomucor pusillus and Fusarium 
lateritium are found to be effective. Using this process, good-quality fibres can be pro￾duced, but the method possess demerits such as time consumption. Moreover, in order 
to maintain homogeneity in retting process, the leaves have to be turned over at least 
one time. This process also needs constant monitoring to prevent over-retting of fibres 
(Mukherjee and Radhakrishnan, 1972). This method is applicable only in regions with 
heavy night dews and warm daytime, where it usually takes a duration of 3–6weeks.
2.5.2 Mechanical Extraction
Since mechanical extraction of fibres includes many processes such as breaking, 
scotching and hackling, specially designed devices are needed for the extraction of 
PALF (Joffe et al., 2003). This is done with the help of a decorticator by leaves crush￾ing mechanism. In mechanical extraction method, the green pineapple leaves are 
manually fed into the decorticating machine called the Raspador, where the revolv￾ing blades scrape out the fibres (Figure 2.4). This machine is a combination of three 
rollers: feed roller, leaf scratching roller and serrated roller. The leaves are fed into 
the feed roller, and then passed through the scratching roller, which scratches the 
upper layer and removes the waxy layer of leaves. Finally, the leaves reach the ser￾rated roller where the dense blades crush the leaves and make several breaks on it 
to enable the entry of microorganisms (N Debasis and D Sanjoy, 2009). The decor￾ticated fibres are then washed out and sun-dried. The fibres generated here are a 
mixture of liniwan and bastos. The last step is knotting the fibres by hand and then 
spinning it with a charkha. The final product will be a single thread, which can be 
used for making fabric or other materials such as ropes, carpets or sponge seats. A 
study conducted by Yusof et al. (2015) stated that the pineapple fibres obtained from 
decorticating machines were more soft, bright and creamy white colour when com￾pared to conventional methods.

pulled out from the decorticator and (c) sun-dried PALFs. (Source: Reused with permission

2.5.3 Degumming of PALF
Even after extraction and retting, the fibres may remain bunched together due to the pres￾ence of gummy substances such as pectin, lignin and pentosan. Hence, it is very essential 
to remove this gum, as it will inhibit the further wet processing of the fibre. The process 
of removing gum from fibres is called degumming. Degumming further improves physi￾cal properties such as moisture regain, fitness, lustre, brightness, whiteness and other 
characteristics of fibres. This gum can be removed by chemical means, enzymes or with 
microorganisms. Chemical degumming methods primarily include alkaline treatment.
2.6 APPLICATIONS OF PALF FIBRES
PALF can be used for various applications such as for fabrication of clothing, bags, 
footwears, furniture and papers. It also has significant potential applications in con￾struction and building, automotive, aerospace, marine, wind energy and consumer 
products. Figure 2.5 summarises the various applications of PALF. In the automotive 
industry, PALFs are used for manufacturing door panels, seat backs, dashboards, pack￾age trays, headliners, and many other interior parts (Reddy et al., 2020). Chemically 
treated PALFs can be used to prepare V-belt cord, conveyer belt cord, transmission 
belt cord, air-bag tying cords and industrial textiles. The following section cites cer￾tain examples and commercially available products developed from PALF.
PALF yarns and handlooms
PALF is considered as a potential commercial-grade textile natural fibre. The most 
common use of PALF is development of yarns and can also be combined with silk or 
PE for manufacturing textile fabrics. PALF being lightweight are highly suitable for 
making curtains, fashionable clothing and bags. Trendy apparels made of PALF has a 
huge demand in the global market, as socioeconomically sound people give more pref￾erence to eco-friendly, sustainable natural fibre-based fashionable dressings (Padzil 
FIGURE 2.5 Various applications of PALF. (Source: Reprinted with permission from Asim 
et al. (2015). Copyright © 2015 M. Asim et al. Open access journal.)34 Polyester-Based Biocomposites
et al., 2020). In a recent study, Jose et al., 2019 reported the potentiality of PALF 
extracted from Indian pineapples to be used for the manufacturing of fashionable 
apparels. In the Philippines, PALFs are commercially marketed as Piña fabric (Emily 
Lush, 2019) and in Spain, it’s called the Piñatex (Carmen Hijosa, 2017). Spreading 
more awareness about the advantages of fabrics made of PALF over synthetic fibres 
can motivate people to cultivate more pineapple and extract more fibres from it.
PALF footwears and baggage
PALF has been recently considered as a leather alternative for footwears and bags 
(ITFN, 2015). The Spanish company Pinatex® markets PALF footwears in Philippines 
(Dan and Mez, 2019). PALF can also be used for fabricating footwears, which are 
flexible, durable, smooth, odourless and chemical-resistant. Recently, PALF-made 
sneakers and shoes have been available in market in different international brand 
names such as Hugo Boss (Boss, 2018), Nike (Sidney, 2021) and H&M boots (H&M, 
2019). PALF is also used for fabricating baggage and furniture.
Paper from PALF
Another important application of PALF is in pulp and paper production (Mat Nayan 
et al., 2014). Many studies have reported the potential of PALF in the development 
of papers (Laftah and Abdul Rahaman, 2015; Sibaly and Jeetah, 2017). In Thailand, 
Bangkok-based company Yothaka International is leading in manufacturing eco￾friendly chairs, stools and benches using pineapple paper fibre (Inhabitat, 2008; Wan 
Nadirah et al., 2012).
In a study, Sibaly and Jeetah (2017) investigated the feasibility of using PALFs for 
paper production. PALFs were mixed with cane-bagasse in different ratios such as 20:80, 
40:60. 60:40, 80:20 and 100:0. Similarly, PALF was also mixed with wastepaper in the 
same ratios and the physical and mechanical properties of the papers were analysed. 
The papers made of 100% PALF were found to be the most absorbent with the highest 
Tensile Index and Burst Index of 6.5 Nm/g and 0.84 kPam2/g, respectively. The most 
abrasion-resistant paper was found to be bagasse-PALF with ratio 40:60 and the most 
crease-resistant paper was wastepaper-pineapple with ratio 80:20. Figure 2.6 illustrates 
the papers made from PALF after mixing with bagasse and wastepaper in different ratios.
PALF composites
Another important application of PALF is in the development of polymer composites. 
Till date, many kinds of thermoset resins such as bisphenol (Vinod and Sudev, 2018), 
epoxy (Doddi et al., 2020; Nagarajan et al., 2016), vinyl ester (Mazlan et al., 2019; 
Mohamed et al., 2014, 2010) and PE (Glória et al., 2017; SaravanaKumar et al., 2021; 
Senthilkumar et al., 2019b) have been reinforced with PALF and their improved prop￾erties investigated. In general, reinforcement of PALF into these polymer matrices 
will improve the mechanical, thermal and vibrational properties of the composites.
2.6.1 PALF-Reinforced PE Composites
PALF is found to be an important reinforcing agent in PE composites, as it is found to 
improve the physical, mechanical and thermal properties of the PE composites. Several 
studies have investigated the role of PALF in enhancing the mechanical properties of Pineapple Fibre-Reinforced Polyester Composites 35
PE composites (B a et al., 2020; B A et al., 2020; Glória et al., 2017; Keerthi Gowda 
et al., 2021; Rajesh et al., 2018; Venkata Deepthi et al., 2019). In a study, the loading of 
30% weight of PALF has shown to improve the flexural strength, tensile strength and 
impact strength (Asim et al., 2015). In addition, in order to improve the fibre quality of 
leaf, several surface alterations can be performed, which include alkali treatment, cya￾noethylation, dewaxing and grafting acetonitrile to dewaxed fibres (Mishra et al., 2001).
In another study the influence of loading different concentrations of PALF on the 
mechanical properties of PALF/ PE composites was studied. An increase of 23% and 
25% was noticed in the tensile strength and tensile modulus, respectively, of PALF 
in PE -PALF composites loaded with 35% PALF compared to composites with 25% 
PALF. This was explained to be due to the increased region of improved interfacial 
adhesion between the fibre and matrix, which resulted in the enhancement of cumu￾lative stress transfer (Senthilkumar et al., 2019b).
The effect of different surface modifications on the mechanical properties of 
PALF-reinforced PE composites was studied by Mishra et al. (2004). In this work, 
detergent washed PALF were subjected to four types of surface modification, viz., 
first was defatted, second was alkali-treated (5% NaOH), and third was subjected 
to graft copolymerization of acrylonitrile and the final sample of PALF was cyano￾ethylated. All four sets of surface-modified PALF were taken into non-woven mat 
form and used for preparing composites and the properties were compared. The 
results indicated that a maximum tensile strength value of 44.77MPa was shown by 
FIGURE 2.6 PALF-bagasse and PALF wastepaper paper samples. (Source: Adapted and 
reprinted with permission from Sibaly and Jeetah (2017).)36 Polyester-Based Biocomposites
alkali-treated PE -PALF composites. This is because alkali treatment removes impu￾rities from the material surface and enhances better fibre–matrix adhesion than any 
other treatments. In another study, an improvement in PE composites with the load￾ing of PALF was reported by Uma Devi et al. (2004). Table 2.3 lists various studies 
on PALF/PE composites and their improved properties.

2.7 CONCLUSION
Pineapple cultivation is now widespread throughout the world due to its ease in 
propagation and economic importance. PALFs are one of the most useful and highly 
exploited natural fibres. Pineapple fibres can be extracted from fresh leaves by dif￾ferent manual and mechanical processes. Both these methods possess merits and

demerits. The quality and quantity of the PALF fibres mainly depend on the type 
of extraction process. So, various factors have to be considered before the fibre is 
extracted from the pineapple leaves. PALF is an excellent material which can be used 
as a reinforcing agent in thermoset, thermoplastic, rubber and biodegradable polymer 
composites. Also, research has revealed that its abundance and ease of availability, 
acoustic insulation, good thermal, mechanical and physical properties, and chemi￾cal constituents are attractive features ensuring their intensive application in textile 
industry, paper making, food packaging and development of composites. This chapter 
details on the cultivation and species varieties of pineapple. This chapter also dis￾cusses on the physical and chemical composition of PALF and explains the various 
methods of extracting PALF from pineapple leaves. The later sections elaborate on 
the applications of PALF with examples and the development of PALF/ PE -based 
composites. The role of PALF in improving the physical, mechanical and thermal 
properties of PE composites is also explained.

3.1 INTRODUCTION
Natural fibre does have many benefits over artificial fibres as a reinforcing agent, 
including renewability (as shown in Figure 3.1), low cost, lightweight, as well as other 
satisfactory standards [1]. Ecologically responsible alternative solutions to traditional 
reinforcement materials (synthetic fibres such as polyester as well as rayon) include 
natural fibres. Due to the hollow as well as cellular nature of natural fibres, they have

a higher surface area as well as lower bulk density, making them less fuel-intensive 
to process [2]. Synthetic fibrils such as glass, but there are more, have a higher fibre 
density (40% greater than natural materials) and therefore are problematic in terms 
of machinability and recycling. Because of this, natural fibre-reinforced compos￾ites are becoming increasingly popular in various industries, including automotive 
and construction. New design flexibility, enhanced corrosion, resistance to abrasion 
as well as fatigue life are some of the advantages of composites [2]. The cellulose 
fibre element of fibre-reinforced polymeric materials could provide considerable low￾temperature preparation, cost benefits, renewable as well as environmentally friendly 
properties. Organic fibre-reinforced research focuses on a variety of areas, such as 
the substitution of conventional compositional or aesthetic components with cost￾effective alternative solutions, lighter weight as well as high strength. Polymeric sub￾stance was used to make 380 million metric tonnes of plastic products, which were 
consumed in 2013, as per Sayeed and co-researchers [3]. These plastic materials are 
also not compostable and produce enormous amounts of waste when disposed of in 
landfills, emit carbon dioxide even during predominant material preparation instead 
recycling processes [4]. Therefore, the next era would then inherit a healthier envi￾ronment thanks to the addition of organic fibres to polymers.
Many countries have access to abundant supplies of jute, making it one of the 
world’s leading fibre-producing crops [5]. Jute fabrics are stronger and more ductile 
than other fibres and yarns. As for the matrix materials, epoxy, phenolic, and polyes￾ter have indeed been extensively utilized. Despite this, polyester matrix is inexpen￾sive, easy to process, as well as easily obtainable in the industry [6,7]. Even though 
FIGURE 3.1 Environmental impact of various fibres [62].Jute Fibre-Reinforced Polyester Composites 47
thermosetting polymer production can be done in a variety of ways, the hand lay￾up method is the most convenient, energy-efficient, and cost-effective method [3]. 
The effectiveness of various layers of jute fibre, mat, as well as the combined effect 
with these other natural fibres [8,9], synthetic fibres [9], and metals [6] on poly￾propylene composites has already been studied extensively. Nevertheless, because 
it is unclear which jute variety was used, the influence of jute diverse array on the 
thermosetting composite material cannot be determined with certainty. Besides that, 
the Bangladesh Jute Research Institute (BJRI) has recognized approximately 2000 
jute genotypes from either the country as well as abroad [10] along with the require￾ments for jute fibre transformation as the retting method progresses. BJRI developed 
Tossa (O-9897) jute variety and distributed through the Department of Agriculture 
for Extension to all of the country’s agricultural producers. The physico-mechanical 
effects of this jute variety on polyester composite must be carefully studied. In addi￾tion, jute sheet layers in the composite increase the final product’s cost, but it is not 
clear how much of an impact this has on their mechanical properties [11–13]. Jute 
fabrics manufactured from Tossa jute diverse array were used in the polyester binder 
and their physical and mechanical properties were studied.
3.2 INFLUENCE OF DIVERSE LAYERS ON 
PHYSICO-MECHANICAL CHARACTERISTICS
The jute fibre in the composite materials is optimized to meet mechanical require￾ments. Comparatively, the physical and mechanical properties of layered jute com￾posites were superior to those of other polyester–jute composites. Nevertheless, a 
two-layer jute fabric material was found to be more cost-effective in terms of sus￾tainability. This jute material has a broad range of applications, including furniture 
and kitchen interior design materials [14]. Composite materials with high-perfor￾mance properties were created by incorporating fibre-reinforced polymers into the 
matrix. Discontinuous and continuous fibres were used as reinforcement agents by 
scientists. Despite the fact that continuous fibres are stronger, discontinuous fibres 
are less so. Therefore, researchers used continuous fibre reinforcement to increase 
the composite’s axial sturdiness. For continuous fibre composite materials, laminate 
configuration is a common one. When two or more layers of reinforcement materi￾als have been layered together in a reinforcement polymer, the result is a laminated 
composite [15,16].
For sporting, aeronautic, automotive, as well as marine applications, laminated 
composites seem to be fascinating since these composites produce substantial 
mechanical performance and seem to be lightweight [17,18]. Numerous laminated fab￾rics, including unidirectional, woven, nonwoven, knitted, as well as braided laminate 
fabrics [19–21], have been used as reinforcement fabrics to fix engineering challenges. 
Amongst some of the various laminated fabric types, woven structures have been used 
as reinforcement materials by several investigators. Weaved fabrics have a number of 
advantages over unidirectional fabrics that are well known [22], and they are easy to 
handle and extremely resistant to impact. A woven fabric seems to be reliable because 
of the yarn fibres there in warp as well as weft directions. Load can be distributed 
in whatsoever longitudinal or transverse direction, and it retains the same shape or 48 Polyester-Based Biocomposites
dimensions. It is also fascinating that the knitted fabric is easy to work with during the 
manufacturing process. Orthogonally angles 0° and 90° are the most commonly used 
in weaving. Weaved fabric comes in a variety of forms, including plain, twill, satin, as 
well as basket weaves. The much more frequently utilized laminated composite mate￾rial is a woven fabric with something like a simple architectural design. The tensile, 
flexural, as well as impact characteristics of woven laminated composites are superior 
to those of unlaminated composites when viewed out of plane [23,24].
Composite materials made from petroleum-based as well as renewable matrix poly￾mers can be made with natural fibre reinforcement. Bio-based plastics and natural 
fibres are combined to create green composites [25]. Using natural fibre-based compos￾ites instead of synthetic fibres is a more environmentally friendly option. A life cycle 
assessment has also been conducted to evaluate long viability of natural fibres and their 
composite materials as reinforcing materials in previous studies [26,27]. A significant 
increase of lightweighting can indeed be attained by simply replacing artificial mate￾rials with organic fibres, especially in automotive as well as structural applications, 
which have a number of environmental benefits, such as recyclability as well as renew￾able resources. Inconsistent fibre dimensions and chemical composition are two of the 
many problems with natural fibres. When developing innovative laminated structures, 
the mechanical characteristics of organic woven fibres are critical [28–31].
These natural fibre-reinforced composites are difficult to manufacture due to 
their physical characteristics, resulting in lengthy and labour-intensive mechanisms 
as well as increase in cost. The woven and laminated variables of organic knitted 
laminated composites are just two of the many variables at play. Laminated variables 
include volume/weight fraction, layering sequence, layering size, as well as fabric 
orientation, whilst knitted variables include yarn crimp, yarn twist, linear density, as 
well as fabric structures. Knitted laminated composites are more difficult to model 
than continuous fibre composites because of these factors. The in-plane character￾istics of woven composite material can be determined mathematically using a vari￾ety of micromechanical modelling techniques. Unidirectional composite materials 
are used in many micromechanical models, including Halpin–Tsai, inverse rule of 
mixture (IROM), Hirsch, as well as rule of mixture (ROM). According to one such 
research, the tensile modulus of unsaturated polyester composites made of single 
and dual-reinforced jute and ramie was determined using micromechanical mod￾els such as Halpin–Tsai and Hirsch. A graph was used to compare experimental as 
well as micromechanical model values to determine which theory values have been 
extremely consistent with the experimental value systems [32,33].
Using natural fibres as reinforcements in polymer matrices has resulted in light￾weight, renewable, and non-hazardous products. Polymer matrix composites have 
been prepared to reinforce natural fibres including Acacia leucophloea, elephant 
grass, isora, jute, fish tail palm, and banana, but also date fibres as well as Ipomoea 
staphylina, wild cane grass, and bamboo fibres [34–37]. The physical, chemical, and 
thermal characteristics of abaca/bamboo composite materials were studied. Resin 
transfer moulding was used to create the composite plates. Using transverse ther￾mal conductivity tests, researchers discovered two distinct patterns of rising conduc￾tivity for bamboo and abaca fibre composites, respectively. E-glass and hemp fibre 
composites were compared. Researchers discovered that hemp fibre has superior Jute Fibre-Reinforced Polyester Composites 49
reinforcement characteristics for composite materials than flax because it is more 
environmentally friendly [38,39].
Previously, a study on the fish tail palm-fibre polymer composites was conducted. 
At a volume fraction of 0.50, the mechanical characteristics of composites were 
already at their best [40]. An investigation of the golden cane grass fibre polymer 
composites under various volume fractions was carried out. Compared to pure poly￾ester-based composites, composites’ mean tensile strength and modulus increased 
[41]. The coconut sheath/polyester composites were discussed and found that the 
composites had a higher flexural as well as impact strength than other composites, 
according to the tests. The influence of silane treatment on coconut sheath-reinforced 
polyester composites was studied and found that the strength of fibre composites that 
have undergone surface treatment is higher than that of similar composites made 
with untreated fibres. The mechanical characteristics of hemp as well as palmyra 
fibre-reinforced polyester composites were predicted. Palmyra and hemp fibres had 
higher tensile properties when the fibres were 30mm long [42,43]. Sun hemp fibre/
polymer composite materials were investigated in terms of fibre weight ratio as well 
as length at 55%, and fibres of 30mm length were found to have the greatest strength 
[44,45]. When the volume fraction (Vf) of snake grass natural fibre-reinforced poly￾mer composites was varied between 10% and 30%, the best tensile strength was 
accomplished at 25% Vf
, while the best flexural strength was accomplished at 25% Vf
for 120 and 150mm length. Few researchers investigated the influence of fibre load￾ing on polyester composites made of banana fibres. Fibre loading was found to have 
a positive impact on composites strength, according to the findings. Compression 
moulding was used to create the sisal/hemp/jute/coir-reinforced composite materials 
by some researchers. Composites made using the compression moulding technique 
were documented and the various characteristics of the composite materials were 
analysed. The laminates were found to have improved mechanical as well as thermal 
properties as a consequence of the chemical treatment [46–48].
Using a hand lay-up method, researchers fabricated natural fibre hybrid compos￾ites to study their properties. The mechanical properties of hybrid composites were 
superior to those of non-hybrid composites. Banana and jute fibre-reinforced epoxy 
composites were investigated by few researchers, and the mechanical properties of 
the banana and jute fibres reinforced with epoxy matrix were increased by up to 30% 
weight percent [49–51]. Some researchers studied bamboo fibre-reinforced polyester 
composites containing between 10% and 60% bamboo fibres. For example, voids, 
fibre bending, and matrix failure were discovered by scanning electron microscopy 
(SEM) analysis. Natural fibre composites made from jowar as well as polyester resin 
were developed. Composites based on the jowar fibre, as opposed to sisal as well as 
bamboo fibres, demonstrated superior tensile and flexural strength. Some researchers 
investigated composites made from short, randomly oriented sansevieria cylindrical 
fibres and polyester. According to some other researchers, a critical fibre length of 
30mm and an optimum fibre weight percent of 40% were found. Some researchers 
used waste grass broom fibres to create green composites. Variations in fibre content 
and temperature were used to study thermal properties [52–54]. They focused on 
random as well as unidirectional oriented polymer composites using natural fibres 
such as banana, jute, bamboo, elephant grass, snake grass, as well as wild cane grass 50 Polyester-Based Biocomposites
in a review performed by them. By ranging the weight percent of Indian mallow 
fibre-polyester composites from 10% to 50%, the various thermal and mechanical 
characteristics have been evaluated [55,56].
Jute, a natural fibre, is in high demand in a wide range of industries. Jute fabrics 
are becoming increasingly popular, both among furniture designers and consum￾ers, for their aesthetic appeal. Jute fabrics-reinforced composite materials have been 
therefore developed using jute fabrics with different types of matrix materials to 
improve their efficiency according to their final use. Layered jute–polyester com￾posites were studied to determine their physical as well as mechanical properties. 
The jute fabrics have been incorporated into unsaturated polyester resin as well as 
hardener by the easy hand lay-up method at room temperature as well as humidity 
situations to create different layers of composites. Analysis of the fracture surface of 
the two-layer, four-layer, and six-layer jute–polyester composites was carried out for 
determining physico-mechanical characteristics. These composites provided signifi￾cant cost savings, adequate strength, and environmental-friendly attributes [57–60].
3.2.1 Fibre Handling and Processing
When treated with emulsion (25% of weight), jute fibres were allowed to rest for 
48hours before being spun in BJRI’s mechanical processing department, where they 
were then passed through a series of steps culminating in the creation of a 10-count 
yarn. A piconol double rapier (Belgium) loom was used to weave 15 ends per inch 
and 15 peaks per inch hessian fabrics in the weaving division of BJRI after beam 
preparation [61]. Inside the textile physics section of BJRI, composite materials made 
of jute and polyester have been created (Figure 3.2).
3.2.2 Composite Fabrication
To reduce the moisture content prior to actual preparation of the composite, 12×12 
jute fabrics were cut as well as baked for 6 hours at 105°C to 110°C. At room tempera￾ture and humidity, polyester matrix was used to create jute–polyester composites. 
Unsaturated polyester resin and hardener are being used in the hand lay-up technique 
to make jute–polyester composites with two, four, and six layers. Methyl ethyl ketone 
peroxide (MEKP) was used as a hardener. Jute composite materials have been cured 
at 25°C for 24hours at room temperature [62]. Characterization could begin well 
after the curing process (Figure 3.3).
Hand lay-up and compression moulding were used to create an unsaturated poly￾ester composite material of woven jute with ramie reinforcement. 300×300mm2 of 
FIGURE 3.2 Jute fibre at various stages [62].Jute Fibre-Reinforced Polyester Composites 51
plain-woven jute and ramie fabric are cut. Through the use of an analytical balance, 
we calculated a 1:50 mixture of unsaturated polyester and MEKP. When the com￾posite plate had dried, a discharge agent was sprayed upon that surface of the mould 
to aid removal. Above the mould, weaved fabric was placed. The woven fabric was 
therefore sprayed within the resin mixture. Excess air was removed from fabric’s 
surface using a roller, and the resin was distributed evenly throughout the fabric. A 
load somewhere between 100 and 200N was applied to the mould. Curing appears 
to take about 8 hours at ambient temperature of 22°C–24°C, and ASTM 3039-com￾pliant specimen was then cut from the finished composite material [63]. The speci￾men is of 25mm (length)×25mm (width)×3mm (thickness). An universal testing 
machine (UTM) (INSTRON 3369) fitted with a 10 kN load cell was used to carry out 
the tensile testing. The crosshead speed was set to 1 mm/min on the UTM machine. 
There in the direction of such warp, the fabric was evaluated. Seven samples were 
given to each group. The results of the screening were subjected to statistical analysis 
(Analysis of Variance). The four micromechanical frameworks used in this study 
include the ROM, the IROM, Halpin–Tsai, as well as Hirsch models [64–66].
A scissor was used to chop the jute fibres into 15mm lengths, as suggested by 
Venkateshwaran et al. [67]. The polyester matrix was created by combining polyester 
resin with 2% catalyst as well as 2% accelerators. After that, the mixture was thoroughly 
whisked to ensure even mixing. Hand lay-up and static compression were used to cre￾ate the composites, which contained a constant 16% of total fibres in each one, follow￾ing preparation of reinforcement as well as matrix materials. A stainless steel mould 
with size of 300 mm×200 mm×3mm was used to create the 3-mm thick composite 
laminate during the fabrication method. Before being eliminated from the mould, thus 
every composite’s cast was given 24hours to cure under a weight of 50kg. After cur￾ing, the laminates were easily removed from the mould with the use of silicon spray. 
The mechanical, thermal, and water absorption characteristics of the samples have been 
examined after they have been cut to suitable ASTM sizes with a diamond cutter.
3.3 PROPERTIES
3.3.1 Mechanical Properties
Tensile strength can be used to describe the tensile behaviour because all param￾eters, including the sample size as well as thickness, have been kept constant 
throughout tensile strength testing. Tensile test specimens made of jute compos￾ites have been cut to ASTM D3039 specifications from each of the three materials 
FIGURE 3.3 Schematic for composite specimen preparation [62].52 Polyester-Based Biocomposites
[55]. The Instron universal testing machine was used to test the tensile strength of 
various layers of jute–polyester composite. During the tensile testing, the load cell 
had a capacity of 50 kN and the cross head had a speed of 5mm per min. Strain 
to failure and tensile strength were calculated based on the machine data. ASTM 
D3039 was then used to calculate Young’s modulus from the strain–stress plot. 
Accuracy was determined by testing five samples in each case [68,69]. Fracture 
surfaces of layered composite materials (Figure 3.4) were examined following 
tensile testing.
Zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles have been shown to enhance the interfacial adhe￾sion among resin, reinforcement, as well as filler in a tensile test of jute fibre treat￾ment. So the composite’s tensile strength is improved due to strong adhesion. There 
is little difference in the tensile strength of fabricated composites. According to these 
results, the scoured process had lower hydrogen bonding interaction and therefore 
lower tensile strength than other process, which increased the size of the fibre’s OH 
groups. The chain movement is constrained by the increased hydrogen bonding. As a 
result, chains that are subjected to tensile force have a difficult time sliding. There are 
three other sets of specimens that exhibit the same tensile strength behaviour. When 
tested against other materials, the best tensile strength was found in 40 g/L treated 
jute-reinforced composite. Similarly, the finest tensile strength characteristics of 
composite materials were obtained by adding ZnO nanoparticles to the matrix. As a 
result, the highest tensile characteristics were found in composites made with 40g/L 
treated reinforcement as well as ZnO particles in the matrix. The tensile stress–strain 
contours of all specimens were not obtained by plotting, because they all exhibited 
the same behaviour [70,71].
The tensile properties of untreated as well as treated jute composites in the aspects 
of tensile strength, tensile modulus, and percentage of strain at break are determined. 
Due to an efficient surface modification, all treated jute composite materials have 
superior tensile properties than the untreated jute composites. The poor fibre–matrix 
adhesion in untreated jute composites will have the least tensile characteristics: 
(1) alkali-treated jute composite seem to have a tensile strength of 12% and ten￾sile modulus of 17% higher than jute composite. Several researchers have found that 
alkali treatment increased the tensile characteristics of jute composites [72–75]. This 
enhanced interfacial adhesion seen between matrix and fibres is due to alkali treat￾ment increasing the surface roughness of the fibre by eliminating hemicelluloses and 
lignin. (2) PLA-coated jute composite does have higher strength than jute compos￾ite but lower strength than other treated composites owing to mean bonding among 
fibres as well as matrix. (3) To put it simply, the treated one is the strongest and most 
FIGURE 3.4 Tensile fracture of (a) two-layer, (b) four-layer, and (c) six-layer jute–polyester 
composite [62].Jute Fibre-Reinforced Polyester Composites 53
elastic of all jute composites, with tensile strength, modulus and % of strain at breaks 
all 20% greater than jute composite. (4) The combination of alkali treatment as well 
as PLA coating may be responsible for the composite’s high adhesion.
3.3.2 Water Absorption Test
Using distilled water and the ASTM D570-98 water uptake criterion of 24, 48, and 
72hours at room temperature, different jute fabric–polyester composites were inves￾tigated [64]. Five samples from each category were subjected to the testing process. 
Following Fan et al. [76], the impact of water absorption on jute fabrics-reinforced 
composite materials was examined. When the specimens have been weighed, they 
were cut into the 76.2×25.4mm dimensions and dried in an oven at 50°C before cool￾ing to ambient temperature in desiccators. This procedure was carried out over and 
over again until the specimen’s mass was stabilized. The specimens were subjected to 
a series of timed water absorption tests in a beaker filled with distilled water. Tissue 
papers were used to wipe samples from the water, then weighed and re-inserted into 
the water. Within one minute of being removed from the water, the samples were 
reweighed to the nearest 0.1mg. As a result of the process, equilibrium was achieved. 
The percentage of water absorption was calculated using equation (3.1):

∆ = ( ) − × (3.1)
where weight of the specimens after soaking inside the solution and their initial 
weights are mt
 and mo in this example.
Young’s modulus is the ratio of stress to strain during tensile testing, and the maxi￾mum load is referred to as tensile strength. Young’s modulus and tensile strength were 
found to enhance with increasing layers of the load-bearing component. In addition, 
the load is transferred from one fibre to the next by the matrix material. There in jute–
polyester composites, the strain to failure enhanced in direct proportion to the increase 
in jute fabric layers. It was found that the natural fibre inhibited/protected ductility of 
polyester, as the jute fibre layers or bundles debonded or delaminated under tensile 
stress. In addition, the thickness of the composite increased slightly with the addition 
of jute fabrics. Both the warp and the weft yarn counts were equal in plain-woven 
fabrics. Therefore, the tensile criteria would then be the same irrespective of whether 
the fabric is warped or wefted. Prediction of physical and mechanical properties of 
various jute–polyester composite layers is the focus of the current study. Using jute 
materials, particularly Tossa jute fabrics, can improve the tensile strength of polyester. 
Increased jute content in the polyester reduces the water absorption of jute–polyester 
composites. Jute–polyester composites should indeed be coated in which moisture 
contact is essential. Because of the degradation of mechanical strength due to swelling 
of jute fibres at the fibre–matrix interface, further research is needed. Moisture uptake 
is reduced when fibre content is low, but mechanical criteria are increased when fibre 
content is high. Using a two-layered composite instead of a four-layered composite for 
a moderately weighted product is preferable [77–79].54 Polyester-Based Biocomposites
The existence of hydroxyl groups in natural fibres causes water absorption, which is 
one of the greatest disadvantages of natural fibres. Micro-gaps in the polymer matrix 
and interfacial bonding among fibres along with matrix are the primary mechanisms 
for water absorption in natural fibre-reinforced polymer composites. In addition, the 
bulging of the fibres caused micro-cracks to propagate, which affected water absorp￾tion. Jute composites show a linear rate of water assimilation at the outset. Over a 
specified length of time of soaking, the fraction of water assimilation slows down and 
reaches saturation. The Fickian diffusion method can be used to model the conduct 
of jute composites [65]. The slope of something like the water absorption versus the 
time graph could be used to determine the rate of water assimilation, which is noticed 
to be smallest for such composites because of strong adhesion that severely prohibits 
the advancement of micro-voids. Due to the hydrophilic existence of jute fibres as 
well as micro-voids in the composite, the jute composite shows the highest percentage 
of water absorption. Treated jute composites seem to have 20% lower water absorp￾tion compared with untreated, alkali-treated jute composites. Alkali treatment may 
be the cause for this. Separation of hemicellulose and lignin in alkali treatment result 
in a decrease in fibre diameter, which results in an increase in the aspect ratio, which 
means that more fibres seem to be readily accessible for adhesion [80,81].
Sampathkumar et al. [66] found that alkali treatments convert the hydrophilic exis￾tence of jute fibre into the hydrophobic existence, which lowers absorption of water. 
Both untreated and treated jute composites have lower water penetration than PLA￾coated jute composite, which is better at resisting water absorption because the PLA 
coating isolates the jute fibres out from water getting absorbed. As a result, treated 
composite does have the least fraction of a percent of water absorption (4.02), which 
is 42% lesser than that of the untreated composite. This may be attributable to the 
combination of alkali treatment as well as PLA coating that offers the greatest fibre–
matrix adhesion, negligible micro-voids, converts the hydrophilic nature into the 
hydrophobic nature, and keeps the fibres separated from water. Diffusion, sorption, 
and permeability coefficient measurements were made on untreated as well as treated 
jute composites. The Fick’s model’s main output is the diffusion coefficient that dem￾onstrates the capacity of water molecules to diffuse into composite materials. Due 
to the hydrophilic existence of jute fibre as well as micro-voids in the composite, the 
natural jute composite had the greatest diffusion coefficient. However, characterized 
composites had lower values because hemicellulose and lignin, which are the primary 
causes of water assimilation, have been removed. Diffusion coefficients derived from 
this research seem to be very similar to those already identified in the literature. A 
further important result of the Fick’s model is the sorption coefficient that also pro￾vides the capability of composites to resist water molecule diffusion. Pure jute com￾posite was found to have the lowest value, while treated jute composite materials had 
higher values. It must have been expected that jute composite would have the highest 
permeability coefficient because of its water absorption capacity [68,69].
3.3.3 Rule of Mixture (ROM) along with Inverse ROM
The mechanical properties of composites can be calculated and predicted using the 
ROM. Depending on the direction of the fibres, the mixture rule can be altered. 
In spite of this, there are a number of issues with the ROM. To predict exactly the Jute Fibre-Reinforced Polyester Composites 55
tensile performance, numerous considerations, including stress and strain raisers 
from embedded reinforcements, interface failure along with statistical dispersion 
effect, presence of void as well as unevenness [], must be taken into account. Errors 
in data collection lead to an overestimation of the utmost tensile strength calculated 
from ROM data. Fibre orientation is presumed to be sequentially connected as well 
as homogeneously dispersed according to the assumptions of ROM. Although its 
spread and alignment appear to be consistent, the fibre exhibits a degree of non￾homogeneity. ROM doesn’t really help anticipate the transverse orientation of a con￾sistent fibre [44,52,72].
3.3.4 Micromechanical Model for Unit Fibre-Based Composite Material
In both single jute and ramie composite materials, modulus vs. volume fraction is 
plotted by investigation. They have been using ROM, Halpin–Tai, as well as Hirsch 
to determine the conceptual toughness of their composite materials. The elasticity 
modulus tends to increase the percentage of such fibre length. Studies and theoreti￾cal values follow the same patterns. There were some discrepancies between the 
evaluated micromechanical model’s elasticity modulus and that of the investiga￾tional one. At the relatively short end of the fibre, the estimated values have been 
compared with the investigational value. Nevertheless, because the volume was so 
much smaller, the variance was much greater. Fibre–matrix interactions may be 
weaker at higher volume fractions. The modulus value for both jute and ramie fibre 
composite materials enhances with increase in volume fraction. All volume fraction 
distributions have higher ROM values when measured axially. Using the findings, 
it is clear that the axial ROM generates the highest possible results. The relatively 
low bound is obtained by running the ROM in the perpendicular direction. The 
ROM outcome is significantly different from the investigational one. The combina￾tion of mixture law anticipates a higher bound for the tensile characteristics of the 
blended system. The blended system’s lack again for impact of fibre orientation 
as well as fibre interaction with matrix is to blame for this issue. Halpin–Tsai’s 
micromechanical model characterizing elasticity modulus x=1 shows nearly ideal 
contract to data acquired from single jute composite materials in volume frac￾tions ranging from 20% to 25%. The Halpin–Tsai micromechanical design with 
an empirical variable x=1 doesn’t really fit the experimentally obtained value for 
single ramie fibre composites. The Halpin–Tsai model with empirical parameter 
x=2 hardly appears to fit ramie fibre composite material values with volume frac￾tions varying from 0% to 20% [38,49].
3.3.5 Influence of Alkali Treatment as well as Poly (Lactic Acid) Coating
Immerse jute fibres in 5% NaOH solution for 30 minutes at 30°C. As a final step, the 
fibres were immersed in a solution of very dilute hydrochloric acid to eliminate the 
NaOH from their surfaces. A hot air oven was used to dry the fibres for 24 hours at 
70°C after they were scrubbed multiple times with distilled water. NaOH reacts with 
jute fibres in the following manner (equation 3.2).
Fibre − + OH NaOH → − Fibre O Na + H O2 − + (3.2)56 Polyester-Based Biocomposites
3.3.6 Covering of PLA-Based Fibres
Originally, PLA pellets were immersed in a chloroform solution containing 2% PLA 
weight per volume for eight hours. In order to ensure a uniform distribution of PLA 
into the chloroform solution, the solution was stirred manually as well as heated to 
60°C, and then the PLA was added. Jute fibres were immersed in PLA solvent and 
then extracted instantaneously. As a final step, the coated fibres were dried in an oven 
at 40°C for 6hours at room temperature.
3.3.7 Scanning Electron Microscopy Analysis
Prior to the creation of composites, the SEM evaluation of fibres is a critical step 
in predicting their adhesion to polymers. Consequently, the SEM images’ failure 
surfaces (tensile, flexural, and impact) of jute fibres utilized as reinforcement in poly￾ester matrix are shown in Figure 3.5. It shows the smooth texture of untreated jute 
fibres. Hemicelluloses and lignin may be the cause for keeping the surface smooth. 
Composites show a rough surface as a result of alkali treatment removing hemicel￾luloses and lignin. Rougher fibres allow the polymer matrix to wet a larger area of the 
fibre, enhancing the adhesion between the fibre and matrix [64,82–84]. A PLA coat￾ing on the exterior of fibres, acting as an outer non-uniform rough thin sheet on the 
fibres’ surface, could also enhance the surface harshness of fibres without removing 
hemicelluloses and lignin. Moreover, PLA coating can change natural fibres’ hydro￾philic nature into a hydrophobic one, increasing the fibres’ adhesion to polymers. 
Due to the consolidated impact of alkali treatment as well as PLA coating, composite 
has extremely high surface roughness.
3.3.8 Flexural Characteristics
Flexural characteristics of untreated as well as treated jute composites on aspects of flex￾ural strength, flexural modulus, and strain at break proportion were analysed. Flexural 
characteristics show the same trend as tensile characteristics. The flexural strength and 
modulus of treated composite seem to be 35% and 49% higher than the untreated ones, 
respectively, while the flexural strength and modulus of composite with coated seem 
to be 37% and 59% higher than those of untreated. Due to good interfacial bonding 
among fibres and matrix, high flexural characteristics in coated composite could be 
due to effective stress transmission from matrix to fibres. This could be explained by 
the interaction between the polar jute fibres and the non-polar polymer matrix in jute 
fibre-reinforced polymer composites, which usually results in poor interfacial adhe￾sion [85]. The flexural characteristics of PLA-coated jute fibres are improved because 
they behave more like non-polar materials and adhere to the polymeric matrix better. 
Flexural characteristics, however, are shown by treated composite to be in the middle 
range. Observe that the proportion of strain at break increases significantly after treat￾ment, with the greatest enhancement found in the coated composite.
The composite specimens have higher flexural strength ranging from 45 to 50MPa
for specimens, which had a maximum value of 55MPa. The ZnO nanoparticles 
enhance the interfacial adhesion of the matrix, reinforcement, as well as filler which Jute Fibre-Reinforced Polyester Composites 57
can be seen from this pattern of behaviour. Increased flexural strength can be achieved 
by adhering strongly to the composite. Additionally, the flexural strength behaviour of 
all untreated composite samples is nearly identical, as can be seen. Flexural strength 
may be affected by treatments that focus on reinforcement, as evidenced by this 
behaviour. The flexural strength of treated composite sample is superior to that of 
untreated one [49,52]. Because the mercerized method produced larger-OH groups on 
the fibres, the hydrogen bonding interactions between the polymer chains of jute were 
FIGURE 3.5 Fracture morphology of jute fibre-polyester composites due to (a–e) tensile 
fracture, (f–j) flexural failure, and (k–j) impact loading [64].58 Polyester-Based Biocomposites
stronger, as well as this resulted in higher flexural strength. The chain can only move 
so far because of the tighter hydrogen bonds. As an outcome, chain flexural force 
applications lead to inadequate chain sliding. The flexural characteristics of composite 
materials are illustrated by the interaction of the matrix and composite reinforce￾ments. When particularly in comparison to other materials, a 40g/L HFC-treated 
jute-reinforced composite had the highest flexural strength. The coated samples with 
flexural strengths approaching 55MPa had the greatest flexural properties of all the 
composites tested when ZnO nanoparticles were added to the matrix. Because of this, 
we can say that composites made with 40g/L HFC-treated reinforcement as well as 
ZnO particle-added matrix exhibited the best flexural characteristics in this study. 
Tensile characteristics were also found to exhibit this phenomenon [60,64,86].
3.3.9 Impact Characteristics
Alkali-treated jute composite has lower impact strength than untreated jute com￾posite, which is fascinating. Few researchers experienced a related result. That’s 
because fibre pull-out is an important factor in determining how much energy a com￾posite can absorb while in an impact assessment; alkali treatment strengthens the 
bond among fibres as well as matrix, reducing the amount of fibre pull-out and thus 
decreasing the impact strength. In terms of impact strength, untreated is lower than 
treated one. Coated composite had the highest impact toughness (5.30 kilo Joules per 
square metre), beating out other composite materials by 4%, 131%, and 34%. During 
the sample impact experiment, the increased capacity to absorb impact energy and 
resist crack propagation is attributed to deformation of a ductile PLA skin wrapped 
around jute fibres. The composite samples’ impact strength was measured at 10.01J. 
Together, all composite material samples had nearly identical impact values. This 
shows that the impact strength of such composite materials was unaffected by treat￾ments on the reinforcement. The impact strength was unaffected by the addition of 
ZnO nanoparticles. Adding only 1% ZnO nanoparticles could have had an impact on 
the results. Specimens’ impact strength was unaffected by this small quantity. No 
matter what type of sample was used, the impact test yielded the same results; there￾fore, these experiments were just not even further examined [28,39,44].
3.3.10 Dynamic Mechanical Characteristics
3.3.10.1 Storage Modulus
The storage modulus is indeed a measure of the quantity of elastic energy that can be 
sequestered in a material all through deformation. The stiffness as well as load-bear￾ing capabilities of a material can be determined by the modulus of Young’s modulus 
[85]. Untreated jute composite materials have lower storage modulus than those that 
have been treated. Those characterized composite materials have higher E′′ values than 
untreated jute composite in the glassy region. Coated composite which had the highest 
storage modulus was followed by other composites. As the temperature rises, the storage 
modulus among all composite materials decreases, which is most likely due to the fibres 
losing their stiffness and elasticity. Many researchers have previously reported similar 
findings [87,88]. There is a gradual decrease in the values of E′′ for all composites within 
the transition zone; however, the integration of treated as well as coated jute fibres in Jute Fibre-Reinforced Polyester Composites 59
coated one causes a slow decrease in the value of E′. In the rubbery province, this com￾posite possesses the greatest value of E′, accompanied by other combinations. Due to 
this same strong interfacial adhesion among treated jute fibres as well as the polyester 
matrix, E′ value is the highest in the family. Coated composite has a better load-bearing 
potential than only those other composite materials at higher temperatures [89–91].
3.3.10.2 Damping
We must split the loss modulus from the storage modulus in sequence to determine 
damping. Strength as well as stiffness of reinforcing fibres and the bonding between 
fibres and matrix all play a role in determining not only the strength but also the 
stiffness of a material. There is more of an impact with a higher damping (Tan Θ) 
value. It was determined that the treated composites have good damping properties, 
even though they have low load-bearing capacity. Coated composite seems to have 
the least Tan Θ value because of its high fibre–matrix adhesion and lower damping, 
making it the most stable material. As a result of alkali treatment and PLA coating, 
both fibre–matrix adhesion and load-bearing capacity have improved. Tan Θ peaks 
increase indicates an increment in thermal stability, which would be evaluated by Tg. 
The composite’s thermal stability as well as maximum Tg value must be reflected in 
its highest Tan Θ peak shift to the right [92–94].
3.3.10.3 Loss Modulus
When a material deforms, it releases heat through thermal dissipation, which is mea￾sured as loss modulus. Dynamic Tg refers to the point on a polymer’s loss modulus 
curve where it reaches its maximum value. The spikes of either the E′′ or Tan Θ
curves can be used to calculate the Tg. The value of E′′ increases up to Tg and then 
decreases as the temperature rises. The coated composite has a higher Tg as well as 
loss modulus because of the addition of alkali treated with PLA-coated jute, which 
also promotes the progress of excellent bonding as well as reduces the movement 
of the polyester bonder. This composite has a higher Tg value than only some other 
composite materials, which indicates its superior thermal consistency [95–98].
3.3.11 Chemical Resistance
Chemical opposition has indeed been found in ZnO nanoparticles reinforced with jute. 
Adding ZnO nanoparticles to unsaturated polyester results in the best chemical resis￾tance, which is almost five times lower than that of the preliminary untreated compos￾ite materials, from 5.45 to 1.51 [96]. Figure 3.6 clearly shows that ZnO nanoparticles 
added to CR polyester resulted in composites with said optimal outcomes.
3.3.12 Flame Retardancy
The composite materials’ flame retardancy was enhanced by adding jute-reinforced 
ZnO nanoparticles. Samples containing ZnO nanoparticles had the highest burning 
time of 149 seconds, which was significantly longer than other samples. Because ZnO 
nanoparticles have such a bigger surface region, they are more resistant to combustibil￾ity than other nanoparticles [97,98]. There is also a noticeable difference in flame retar￾dancy between the first two specimens. Jute fibre treatments augmented the attraction 60 Polyester-Based Biocomposites
between both the jute reinforcement and the matrix, which resulted in higher strength. 
Third, fourth, and fifth specimen sets have the same pattern of behaviour [99–101]. 
Because resin accounts for 75% of the composite’s weight and reinforcement seems to 
be hardly 25%, this consequence may be marginal. Both unsaturated polyester and ZnO 
nanoparticle enhanced flame resistance, as well as the highest suitable flame resistance 
was attained when both are used together. Whenever these two cases are evaluated inde￾pendently, this same flame resistance was lowered to 182 seconds for unsaturated poly￾ester by itself as well as 160 seconds for ZnO nanoparticles-added composites, which is 
significantly lower than the previous results [102–105].
3.4 CONCLUSION
Jute fibre-reinforced polyester composites have been discussed from various spec￾trum initiated with the influence of diverse layers on physico-mechanical charac￾teristics. Fibre handling and processing and composite fabrication are preliminary 
parameters being understood. The evaluating methods including tensile test, water 
absorption test, and their characteristics are discussed. Concern to move forward is 
to be addressed for modelling of composite material for the micromechanical char￾acteristics, which includes the ROM along with IROM, micromechanical model for 
the single jute fibre-based composite material, influence of alkali treatment as well 
as coating and covering of PLA-based jute fibres reinforcement composite mate￾rial. The next realization is about the fabrication method of jute composite mate￾rial and their corresponding SEM analysis. Thereby, this leads to learn about the 
other evaluation for their flexural characteristics, impact characteristics along with 
their dynamic mechanical characteristics including storage modulus, damping, loss 
modulus, chemical resistance and flame retardancy.

4.1 INTRODUCTION
The ever-increasing costs of raw resources for structural and standard plastic 
products, concerns about the long-term viability of natural reservoirs, and the 
growing environmental risk have compelled researchers and manufacturers of 
polymeric materials to turn to naturally occurring, recyclable materials [1,2]. The 
usage of synthetic fibers had controlled the sector of reinforcements in the past 
years; nevertheless, the reinforcements using natural fibers had received a great 
push to replace this synthetic fiber in numerous fields [3]. Over the past decade, 
there has been an increase in interest in the production of polymer composites 
that are successful in the market with synthetic composites by combining natural 
fibers with polymer matrices derived from both non-renewable (petroleum-based) 
and renewable resources [4]. These composites are created by mixing natural 
fibers with polymeric composites.
Biodegradable polymers and bio-based polymeric goods from renewable resources 
may build sustainable and eco-friendly products that can compete and conquer the 
existing market which is occupied by petroleum-based merchandise. These types 
of goods can also be formed from renewable resources. Investigators have used 
both softwoods and hardwoods in their efforts to isolate fibers that may be used as 
reinforcements in a variety of composites. Natural fibers, such as cotton, jute, and 
sisal, are of critical significance to the economies of some underdeveloped countries. 
Cotton is particularly important in a number of West African countries, while jute 
and sisal are important in Bangladesh and Tanzania, respectively [5].
In regions of the world where there is a shortage of natural forests, farmlands have 
been used in research and innovations related to polymer composites. Bamboo is one 
of the agricultural products that has the potential to be employed in polymer compos￾ite research and innovation. Due to its benefits, bamboo is one prominent agricultural 
product that may be utilized [6]. The regions of Asia and South America have abun￾dant supplies of bamboo. Although it is recognized as a natural engineering material, 
bamboo has not been studied to its maximum degree in many of the Asian nations. 
Due to the fact that it takes many months for the material to mature, it has become an 
essential component in determining the socioeconomic level of society. Because of 
its exceptional strength relative to its weight, bamboo has traditionally been used in 
a variety of applications, including housing and equipment. This quality is a result of 
the fibers being aligned in a longitudinal direction. In actual fact, it is obligatory to 
construct the bamboo-based composite materials in combination with the supervised 
extracting of bamboo fibers from bamboo trees [7,8]. This is the case even if the 
extraction of bamboo fibers is the primary focus. Bamboo fibers inherently contain 
finer mechanical qualities than other natural fibers; however, compared with other

natural fibers, bamboo fibers have a more brittle nature owing to the higher lignin 
concentration that covers the bamboo fibers.
Currently, bamboo is thought of as an essential plant fiber, and it has a signifi￾cant potential for use in the polymer composite sector. Because of the variations in 
its structural makeup, mechanical qualities, extraction of fibers, surface modifica￾tion, and thermal characteristics, it has become a versatile material for application in 
automotive industries [9,10]. Some of the most interesting characteristics of bamboo 
are its commercial benefits, thin and light, excellent mechanical properties, and non￾hazardous essence of bamboo fibers, which makes investigators work in the path of 
composite technology. Another attractive property of this material is that it does not 
contain any hazardous elements. Because of this, it is clear that composites made from 
bamboo fiber have capabilities to be used in the automobiles. These composites have 
the potential to recover the non-renewable and expensive synthetic fibers that are cur￾rently used in composite materials, especially in automotive industry and in residential 
sectors. Currently, there is danger to the environment, which has resulted in several 
nations passing regulations requiring the use of recyclable materials in automobiles to 
the extent of 95%. The use of natural fibers, and more specifically composites based 
on bamboo fiber, in day-to-day life is becoming more popular now. Extensive research 
is being conducted in every area, including engineering, biotechnology (also known as 
genetic designing), farming, and other related areas, all with the intention of achieving 
one objective: the improved use of bamboo fibers in composite materials.
4.2 INTERPRETATIONS OF THE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC 
ENVIRONMENT RELATING TO BAMBOO AND COMPOSITE 
MATERIALS CONTAINING BAMBOO FIBER
There are around one thousand subspecies of bamboo widely present, which is itself 
a reflection of the incredible variety of this plant. Instead of saying that bamboo 
keeps growing incredibly quickly, it is more accurate to remark that it is an incredibly 
fast-growing grassland. Bamboo has been put to use in a number of Asian nations 
from prehistoric days, as well as in South American countries for hundreds of years. 
In many contexts, bamboo may be seen as an environmentally sound alternative to 
traditionally used wood species. When opposed to hardwood, which usually takes 
nearly around 20 years to achieve maturation, bamboo may be harvested after just 
3years. When bamboo has reached maturity, its tensile strength is equivalent to that 
of mild steel [11]. The average growth of bamboo is incredible; the renowned and 
fastest tends to grow upward of 2 inches per 60 minutes, and in certain species of 
moso bamboo, the height of 60 feet is attained in only 90 days. As a result, trying to 
cut down this alternative source of wood would have no impact whatsoever on envi￾ronmental health. Trading in bamboo and items made from bamboo is expanding at 
a very quick rate. The explanation for the high selling price of bamboo is that there is 
lack of wood production in developing countries, and bamboo is the preferred option 
available to replace wood in terms of its growth factor [12]. The production and dis￾tribution of bamboo and the goods made from it, whether they be household items, 
panels, or decoration products, all have an impact, collectively, not only on the state 
of the world economy but also on the environment.70 Polyester-Based Biocomposites
Agricultural workers are the ones who stand to profit the most from the cultivation 
and harvesting of bamboo. Cultivating and harvesting bamboo has provided them 
with a reliable source of income, which has allowed them to hone their fundamental 
agricultural skills, remain calm in the face of potential financial setbacks associ￾ated with bamboo sales, and increase their capacity for self-determination. Bamboo 
planting has a direct bearing on the entire ecosystem, not only does it aid in the pre￾vention of mudslides and soil depletion, but it also converts the previously worthless 
area into farmland that can support agriculture. The ability to cultivate bamboo may 
help impoverished farmers in rural areas improve their standard of living [13]. Not 
only can the cultivation of bamboo help restore the damaged land and the ecosystem, 
but it can also help improve food and nutritional security by being intercropped with 
other crops that provide food. The cultivation of bamboo involves just a little cost, 
which is used to purchase bamboo reproduction, site, and labor. The social economic 
subsidies of cultivating raw resources or designing products (household equipment, 
floor coverings, bamboo-based nanocomposite, barricades, decorative items, and so 
on) that produce large quantities of long-lasting goods and services are, without a 
doubt, making a significant contribution to the growth of business attributes in many 
regions of the world. This is the case because these activities lead to the fabrication 
of basic commodities [14]. Interest in employing bamboo in composite technology 
has been sparked as a result of the destruction of the environment and the rapidly 
rising price of gasoline. Bamboo is one of the greatest resources that can be used as 
a reinforcement material in composite materials rather than using glass fibers, which 
also entirely depends on the depletion of natural energy reserves [15]. The imposi￾tion of strict regulations to construct sustainable and environment-friendly consumer 
goods is pushing industry sector to enhance the research methods of someone using 
bioremediation assets for the improvement of mechanical properties.
Organizations are looking for ways to mitigate this ecological imbalance in a 
more sustainable manner. The rapid expansion of the reinforced sector may be attrib￾uted to the widespread accessibility of bamboo. In addition to minimizing the neces￾sity for the use of wood, there is a significant need for a step toward the formulation 
of public policies as well as the acceleration of technical efforts [16].
The development of bamboo-based composite materials for use in home furnish￾ings, mobility, and buildings has contributed to the economy and simultaneously pro￾viding socioeconomic benefits to the general populace. New job opportunities have 
opened up as a result of the marketing of bamboo-based composites; regulations are 
currently being developed all over the community to cultivate attention among some 
of the general community by asserting a series of strategies; for instance, bamboo 
materials will no longer be subject to excise obligations [17].
4.3 BAMBOO FIBERS
4.3.1 The Availability of Bamboo around the World
Bamboo is cultivated in several of the world’s largest regions, as well as the industry 
has indeed been subdivided to reflect this fact: the Asia–Pacific bamboo area, the 
American hardwood territory, the African hardwood province, and the European Bamboo Fibre-Reinforced Polyester Composites 71
and North American bamboo geographic area. The region encompassing Asia and 
the Pacific is home to the greatest number of bamboo plantations in the universe. 
In the continents of Asia, bamboo is referred to by a variety of names. In China, 
it is regarded as the “companion of mankind,” while in India and Vietnam, it is 
known as the “woods of the poor” and “the brother” [18]. The statistics on bamboo 
productivity at the worldwide level were given by FAO and are shown in Figure 4.1. 
India, China, Indonesia, the Philippines, Myanmar, and Vietnam are just few of the 
nations that are responsible for a significant portion of Asia’s bamboo production. 
The monopodial kind of bamboo, as opposed to the monopodial variety, makes up 
the majority of the world’s population [19]. The widespread promotion of bamboo 
cultivation across China has resulted in an approximately 30% increase in the num￾ber of pods per plant of bamboo production.
4.3.2 The Process of Extracting Bamboo Fibers
The organic genuine bamboo fabric and the bamboo pulp fibers are the two types of 
bamboo fiber that may be acquired mostly from trees. Each kind of bamboo fiber is 
processed in a completely different way; thus, it is possible to get both types (namely 
bamboo viscose fiber or regenerated cellulose bamboo fiber). Utilizing just physico￾mechanical processes, the raw bamboo fiber is obtained from the bamboo plant in 
its purest form, without the use of any reprocessing agents. We refer to it as existing 
natural fibers or real natural hardwood fibers so that we can distinguish something 
from bamboo pulp fibers, which is also known as bamboo viscose fibers. However, 
bamboo pulp (viscose) fiber is a kind of chemical fiber that belongs to the category 
of regenerating cellulose fiber. Machinery processing and biochemical treatment 
are the two main methods for obtaining bamboo fibers. Mechanical treatment is 
the more common of the two. The separation of bamboo sticks is the first step in 
both procedures. Afterward, the strips are either subjected to mechanical treat￾ment or chemical preparation, depending on the final application of bamboo fibers.

FIGURE 4.1 Statistics on bamboo productivity at the worldwide level.72 Polyester-Based Biocomposites
The production of cellulose fibers requires first alkali hydrolysis, which is accom￾plished using sodium hydroxide (NaOH). After being treated with alkali, the cel￾lulose fibers are next bleached using a multi-phase process that involves carbon 
disulfide. This method is used by a vast majority of manufacturers since this requires 
the shortest amount of effort to produce the bamboo fibers [20].
In contrast, the mechanical technique involves the bamboo being first crushed 
before being subjected to enzyme treatment, which results in the production of a 
sponge-like mass. Isolated fibers are then recovered with the use of mechanically 
comb fiber technology. In comparison to the chemical reaction, this approach is 
environmentally safe, despite the fact that it is a lesser economically viable proce￾dure. The procedure of extracting the fiber was explained by the investigators, and 
it was separated into coarse and refined bamboo processing [21]. After chopping 
and separating the bamboo, steaming it, and fermenting it with bamboo catalysts, 
we were able to acquire rough bamboo fibers. The process of heating, fermenting 
bamboo with just an enzymatic, washing and bleaching it, treating it with acids, 
immersing it in oil, and air-drying it are the processes that must be taken in order to 
achieve good quality bamboo.
4.3.3 The Structure and Function of Bamboo
The culm, the roots, the rhizome foundation, the shoot, the branching, and the leaf 
make up the anatomical components of a bamboo plant. Phyllostachys elegans in the 
United States and Phyllostachys edulis known as “Moso” in China are examples of 
bamboo species that produce blooms sporadically [22]. The term “sporadic blossom￾ing” refers to the process through which flowers open in response to ambient factors 
instead of genetic information [23].
According to Zhang et al. [24] and Jiang et al. [25], the morphological structure 
(outside look) of bamboo may be broken down into two primary components: the 
rhizome and the culm networks. Additionally, the bamboo plant may be broken down 
into two distinct sections: the subterranean section, which is made up of rhizomes, 
roots, and buds, and the aboveground section (composed of stems, branches, and foli￾age). The purpose of extant bamboo structures is outlined below in detail. Every job 
that is performed out by the same structure of bamboo is connected to every other 
configuration of bamboo in order to guarantee that perhaps the bamboo plant is able 
to develop consistently [26].
4.3.4 Rhizome
It is a horizontally and fragmented stem that projects from the source species and 
has the ability to penetrate underground in order to colonize new land with the aim 
of expanding its territory. It has a sheath that protects it from the elements. When a 
plant breaks the surfaces to develop a culm, the sheath serves the purpose of provid￾ing the necessary protection for the plant to do so. The rhizome is responsible for 
the collection, storage, and distribution of moisture and nutrients for the functions of 
parenchyma and conducting tissue. It also participates in the vegetative development 
of the plant by developing into the nodes of new growth or bamboo culms.Bamboo Fibre-Reinforced Polyester Composites 73
4.3.5 Culm
It is a cylindrical-shaped, wooden stem that is made up of nodes and lateral roots. 
Culms are almost always hollowed inside. In spite of this, there are varieties of bam￾boo which have culms that seem to be solid. A culm’s sheathing, foliage, leaflets, 
flowering, and branching system are its recognized characteristics. The root system 
provides everything with stability, which enables it to endure the additional load of 
leaflets as they expand. After three or four years, a culm reaches its complete matu￾rity, and as it develops, it increases exponentially and becomes more rigid.
4.3.6 Root
The primary purpose of the root system is to provide structural support for the culms, 
which enables the culms to better withstand environmental stresses such as adverse 
weather. Additionally, this makes it possible for the culm to support increased load, 
which in turn enables it to produce additional leaves across greater distances. Storage 
of nutrition is another function of the root. They usually don’t go deeper than one foot 
into the ground, coming from either the rhizome node or the bottom of the culm. The 
morphology of roots is often rather identical, both in terms of their size and their form.
4.3.7 Branches
Nearly all species of bamboo are capable of producing several branches from either 
a solitary bud that’s also situated at a node. Nevertheless, there are genera that are 
capable of growing many branches at every terminal. Chusquea is one such example.
4.3.8 Leaves
Leaves may be found on every major component of a bamboo plant, including the 
rhizomes, the culm, and the branches. The blade, the sheathing, and the ligule are 
the three components that make up the anatomical structure of a leaf. The rhizome is 
the first place where leaflets may be found, and at this stage they are virtually entirely 
made up of the sheath. At this point, the leaves act as a safety covering to encapsulate 
the rhizome as it moves underneath. This helps the rhizome to continue its growth. 
The blades will emerge as the most prominent characteristic of the plant after the 
rhizome has broken through the topsoil and transformed into a culm. By absorbing 
sunlight and turning it into usable energy, the blade performs the photosynthesis 
functionality of the plants. The shape of the blade may vary greatly from species to 
species. The way that the leaves appear is a significant factor in determining whether 
or not something is bamboo [27].
4.4 THE CONSTITUENT SUBSTANCES THAT 
INCORPORATE BAMBOO FIBER
There are three primary chemical components that make up bamboo fiber: cellulose, 
hemicellulose, and lignin [28,29]. Bamboo fiber is a development of biomaterial.74 Polyester-Based Biocomposites
4.4.1 Cellulose
Cellulose is the structural base that constitutes the cellular structure of bamboo fiber, 
and it is mostly constituted of three components including carbon, hydrogen, and 
oxygen. Microfibrils are the most common type of cellulose that is found to be pre￾served inside the cell walls of plants. Following separation, bamboo fiber was exam￾ined for its chemical components by Wang et al. [31], who discovered that somehow 
the cellulose content of the fibers achieved 73.83%. Bamboo fiber is used in the cloth￾ing industry. Cellulose is the primary component that determines tensile properties 
along the grains of bamboo fiber, as well as the amount of cellulose present in bam￾boo is directly proportional to the maturity of the bamboo. It is important to take into 
account that the aging of bamboo results in a reduction in the amount of cellulose 
present in almost the same bamboo materials [30].
4.4.2 Hemicellulose
Hemicellulose is an amorphous polymer that has moderate crystallinity and may be 
found in the spaces among fibers. Hemicellulose is a complicated polysaccharide that 
mostly consists of xylan as the primary chain and, among other things, 4-O-methyl￾D-glucuronic acid, L-arabinose, and D-xylose [32]. According to the findings of 
Fengel et al. [33], who investigated the polysaccharides proportion of Phyllostachys 
makinoi removed with 5% and 17.5% NaOH, the major ingredient of this fraction was 
arabinoxylan, and the ratios of xylose to arabinose seemed to be 17–18:1. Following 
retrieval of filtered water, the majority of the bamboo polysaccharide constituents 
were found to be glucose. However, following removal with an alkali solution, the 
proportion of xylose found in the bamboo polysaccharide elements was found to be 
significantly higher. This research was conducted by Sun et al. [34].
4.4.3 Lignin
Lignin is a type of polymer that may take on many different forms and has intricate 
patterns. Lignin is composed of many different types of monomers, and the most 
important ones are guaiacyl, syringyl, and p-hydroxyphenyl monomers. The struc￾tural units that make up lignin are related to one another mostly by ether linkages 
and carbon–carbon solitary bonding [34]. There is not a uniform distribution of lig￾nin across the secondary walls of the bamboo fibers. When compared, the percent￾age of lignin inside the wide layer is often lower, whereas the percentage of lignin 
in the narrower layer is typically greater [32]. The inclusion of lignin in bamboo 
materials contributes, in addition, to the molecule’s level of resilience. There is also a 
correlation between the maturity of the bamboo and the amount of lignin it contains. 
As shown in Figure 4.2, the fundamental framework of lignin can be generally sepa￾rated into three distinct types.
Contrary to its three primary components, lignin typically consists of a variety 
of carbohydrate, lipid, and protein compounds as well as minute amounts of ashes 
components [28,29,32]. Not only these chemical constituents impact the qualities of 
bamboo, but they also affect how bamboo fiber may be used in various applications. Bamboo Fibre-Reinforced Polyester Composites 75
Table 4.1 shows the mechanical properties of bamboo fiber. Figure 4.3 represents the 
chemical constituents of bamboo fiber.
4.5 BAMBOO TREATMENTS
The strands of bamboo have water-soluble quality because their synthetic constitu￾ents, such as lignin, may weaken bonds well with water-repellent framework ele￾ments. This results in the bamboo having a more water-loving character. A wide

range of researchers have used mixtures, medicines, and methods to delignify the 
bamboo [35].
4.5.1 Alkaline Therapy
When it comes to creating thermoplastics and thermosets, the alkaline treatment of 
natural fibers is by far the most common chemical treatment that is used. The alkaline 
treatment eliminates the extra lignin, wax, and oils that are present on the exterior 
surface of the fiber cell. The treatment with NaOH ionizes the hydroxyl group, which is 
the goal of the process. There are two different effects that the alkaline therapy exerts 
on the fibers. The first is the capability of increasing the quantity of cellulose exposed 
on the fiber surface, and the second is the capability of increasing the roughness over 
the outer surface, which in turn raises the mechanical interlocking [36].
4.5.2 The Treatment with Silane
The silane treatment is most noticeable when there is moisture present, and it may 
also lower the number of hydroxyl groups in cellulose. Moisture, when blended with 
a hydrolyzable alkoxy group, contributes to the creation of silanols, which respond to 
the hydroxyl group of the fiber to form covalent bonds with the wall. Silane treatment 
is most effective when there is moisture present.
4.5.3 Acrylation of Naturally Occurring Fibers
Following acetylation, also known as the incorporation of acetyl substituents into 
the molecule, the hygroscopic quality of the plant fibers is significantly diminished. 
In order to improve the fiber–matrix adhesion, the acetylation solution is frequently 
applied to sisal fibers before they are spun into yarn.
4.5.4 Treatment through Benzoylation
Attributed to the prevalence of benzoyl in benzoyl chloride, this procedure has the 
benefit of reducing the aqueous solubility of the fiber. Additionally, interactions with 
matrices are much improved in terms of their adherence. Additionally, it brings about 
a reduction in moisture absorption.
4.6 PERMANGANATE DIAGNOSIS
During the permanganate treatment procedure, solutions of permanganate are 
employed most of the time. The hydrophilic character of the fiber is reduced by per￾manganate treatments, which result in increased adhesive between both the fiber and 
matrix. This is one of the advantages of the diagnosis.
4.6.1 The Process of Isocyanate and Peroxide Treatments
Agents such as benzoyl peroxide and dicumyl peroxidase, among others, are used 
in the process of modifying the natural fibers. After undergoing a preparation 
with alkaline, the fiber is given an exterior coating of (Black Phosphorus) BP or Bamboo Fibre-Reinforced Polyester Composites 77
(Dichloropropane) DCP in acetone solution during this type of therapy. The tensile 
properties of the fibers may be increased as a result of this treatment. There is a 
high degree of reactivity between the hydroxyl group of cellulose and the isocyanate 
functional group. The hydrophilic character of the fibers is diminished by these treat￾ments, which also results in an increase in the qualities of adhesion.
4.7 APPLICATION
Bamboo is a natural fiber composite material that can be found growing abundantly 
in the majority of tropical regions. As a result of technological developments and an 
increase in business trend, bamboo has already been utilized extensively for the pro￾duction of a variety of consumer goods as well as for industrial purposes.
4.7.1 Capabilities for Construction Work
The tensile strength that was required for the development of the bamboo link during 
the time period just before the First World War is the proof in this case. The pedes￾trian bridge made of bamboo had first been constructed so that people could cross the 
river and maintain their commercial ties.
4.7.2 Applications Related to Interior Design
Bamboo bio-composites have a significant impact on the development of interior 
design, and this impact contributes to the material’s overall commercial value. 
Utilization of bio-composites in the production of various bamboo products for both 
exterior and interior usage has a respectable demand in markets all over the globe 
This is further strengthened by its perfectness as an inspirational material, which has 
received recognition from a variety of sources. This demonstrates that half and half’s 
fabric can beat other building materials from a variety of perspectives, such as physi￾ological, structural, and aesthetic [37,38].
In modern times, several kinds of mixtures based on bamboo products have been 
established. These mixtures have been used for the design of roofs, walls, floors, 
entrances, frame boundaries, staircases, and even house decorative embellishments.
4.7.3 Applications Related to Furniture
Many countries have recently started producing new pieces of decor; for instance, 
Malaysia is the world’s largest transporter of furniture, as it ships its wares to over a 
hundred different countries. Bamboo bio-composite has been shown by a large num￾ber of researchers to have several benefits when it comes to the production of dif￾ferent kinds of furniture and its components. For the purpose of demonstrating that 
the durability of the decor may be equivalent to that of wood, new ideas have been 
devised to use smart materials. Investigations into bent and shaped materials such as 
wood, for example, may help strengthen the durability of the bamboo fibers. Work that 
is done throughout the world to produce more sustainable and environment-friendly 
(bio-based) furniture pieces has the potential to bring about a continuous shift in the 
level of product development accomplishment. Initiatives that aim to extend the use of 78 Polyester-Based Biocomposites
bio-composites are extremely highly applauded and encouraged because of the poten￾tial of these resources to lessen their impact on the natural environment, improve 
development, and enable more advanced manufacturing techniques.
4.7.4 Applications in the Automotive Industry
The development of novel bamboo-tangled polished composite cross-breeds is ongoing, 
and continuous research is leading to the creation of new hybrids in which all the sections 
of wood (core, facing, and rear tiers) are formed of bamboo mate [39]. In addition, bam￾boo tangles with wooden polish panels are used as components of train carriages. This 
is supported by a large number of researchers who have proved the usefulness and fea￾sibility of bamboo as an alternative material in the industry that produces automobiles.
4.7.5 Bamboo Fiber Composites: Potential Benefits and Potential Pitfalls
The economic value of bamboo fiber is quite high in many different sectors, from 
raw materials to finished goods. Bamboo is used in everything from paper to cloth￾ing. It is anticipated that the worldwide market for bamboo fiber would reach 98.30 
billion US dollars by the year 2025 [40]. Because it is such a diverse substrate for 
industrialized items as well as furniture, demand for it is quite strong within these 
sectors. As a consequence, the expansion of the bamboo industries will ultimately 
lead to improve in the socioeconomic standing of the surrounding communities. As a 
consequence, unemployment, poverty, and lack of development in local communities 
will be significantly reduced or eliminated entirely. A situation in which supply and 
demand are in equilibrium is anticipated to result in an increase in the price of bam￾boo fiber. The bamboo fiber-reinforced polymer composites do not seem to have any 
economic value at this point, which is probably also true. The polymer composites 
of synthetic fiber may work well with the bamboo reinforcing fibers that are being 
used. Despite this, there are a number of challenges that need to be addressed before 
bamboo-reinforced polymer composites may find widespread use [41–45].
The present moment is a great opportunity to teach the wider populace regard￾ing bamboo composites, which would need full backing of government educational 
institutions. Inventions are not disseminated to the general population since there are 
not enough relevant venues on which they may be published. This means that they 
are kept inside the scientific community. It is the role of the nation to provide venues 
that are easily accessible for communicating research results to all levels of soci￾ety. The results of research on bamboo composites may be effectively disseminated 
via a variety of channels, including editorials, social networks, awareness programs, 
and/or community events. Additional problem is that there is little financing, which 
diminishes the progression of research studies, restricts participation, and prevents 
presenters from attending academic conferences.
Unfortunately, there is a restriction placed on research grants on a worldwide 
scale during the period of the COVID-19 epidemic. It makes perfect sense for admin￾istrations to put the revival of the economy and society at the top of their agendas. 
To further the internationalization of bamboo composites in the foreseeable future, 
progress should be launched on a number of different fronts. As a consequence of 
this, this chapter compiles and disseminates the most recent information regarding Bamboo Fibre-Reinforced Polyester Composites 79
bamboo-reinforced polymer composites. As a consequence of this, researchers will 
be able to concentrate their role to make new strategies regarding bamboo-reinforced 
polymer matrix composites study.
4.8 FUTURE INNOVATIONS IN BAMBOO￾REINFORCED COMPOSITES
The current industrialization, which is focusing on increasing the eco-efficiency 
of manufacturing goods and the processes used to manufacture them, is key to 
ensuring a stable environment for future generations. All through using techniques 
for chemically produced and gasoline-related goods and services, which currently 
dominate the industry and are depleting natural petroleum sources, high-perfor￾mance, biodegradable waste and renewable plant materials may build a stronger 
foundation for sustainable and eco-efficient advanced technologies. These materials 
can also be used to make plant materials. Natural fibers and bio-composites made 
from natural resources have the potential to replace the prevailing use of petro￾leum products soon since they combine sustainability, environmental friendliness, 
and highly completed products. Cellulose fibers and biomaterials are manufactured 
from natural resources. Bamboo fiber is derived from a source that is well known for 
being renewable in the sense that it has a high rate of growth and superior mechani￾cal qualities. The exploitation of bamboo fiber in the production of biomaterials 
via the application of cutting-edge technology revolutionizes the future of the next 
generations. Products made from bamboo fiber that are thoughtfully developed and 
constructed have the potential to contribute to a new revolution aimed at preserving 
our environmental capital. As a result, based on this concise analysis, bamboo fibers 
have the potential to be employed for the creation of advanced and designed prod￾ucts for a variety of various purposes. It will be an alternate opportunity to grow 
biomaterials, which can be especially helpful for meeting the day-to-day require￾ments of citizens, such as in the manufacture of lighter weight automotive parts 
or sporting goods. This includes domestic tables and chairs, houses, barricades, 
trusses, and floor coverings, among other things. They will be the leading factor in 
the transition from a dependent world today to a sustainable economy because of 
their cheap cost, quick accessibility, and aesthetically designed products.
4.9 CONCLUSION
The utilization of bamboo fibers in a spectrum of uses has made it possible for 
academics and businesses to explore new routes toward the goal of developing a 
renewable framework for the continued use of bamboo fibers in the upcoming years. 
Bamboo fibers have found widespread use in the composite industry, which have 
contributed significantly to the socioeconomic and cultural leadership of citizens. 
The manufacturing of bamboo fiber-based composites using various matrices has 
resulted in the development of biomaterials that are both cost-efficient and envi￾ronmentally benign. This has a direct influence on the stock prices of bamboo. In 
order to build such composites, it is required to do exhaustive research on the basic, 
biomechanical, and functional properties of bamboo fibers. In light of this, an effort 
has been made throughout this research to compile data about the fundamental 80 Polyester-Based Biocomposites
characteristics of composites based on bamboo fiber and the economic applications 
of such composites. Researchers from all around the globe have conducted a wide 
range of studies and created novel ideas in order to simply provide the most basic 
support to people who are both employed and earning. Investigations being done 
now on bamboo fiber-based composites make use of both theoretical and applied 
engineering, whether in terms of transformation, mechano-physical, thermal, or 
other qualities. However, the final objective of using the bamboo fiber to its max￾imum extent remains a long way off from its predicted landmark, especially in 
Malaysia. Other nations, such as India and China, have advanced much farther in 
employing bamboo fiber in a socioeconomic sense.
A successful strategy for the bamboo-based composites sector would aid in 
using bamboo in a manner that is different from the typical and conventional 
use of the material. In terms of research and interpretation, there must be more 
progress made in order to effectively characterize bamboo fiber, as well as com￾posite materials based on bamboo fiber. In this chapter, we have made an effort 
to obtain information on the many forms of experiments and investigations that 
have been carried out. However, scientists have indeed completed a significant 
amount of work on composites based on bamboo, but there is still a need for more 
study and invention in this field in order to address any possible difficulties that 
may arise in future. People living in metropolitan areas and in remote communi￾ties, who rely more on artificial composite materials, will find their lives simpli￾fied as a result of these factors.

5.1 INTRODUCTION
Composites are generally utilised in our everyday life. Because of their light weight 
and can be formed for explicit use, they command significant distinctions in their 
applications, especially in the aviation and automotive industries, to mention a few. 
Nowadays, natural fibres are the source of renewable energy, and they are relatively 
inexpensive and abundantly available (Kiruthika and Veluraj, 2009). Natural fibre 
strands supplant the synthetically manufactured filaments as support in different 
grids. Natural fibre composites can really be used as a replacement for wood and also 
in other specialised fields, e.g., in the automotive industry (Nasimudeen et al., 2021; 
Shahroze et al., 2021; Chandrasekar et al., 2022). In any event, a modification is rec￾ommended to work on the connection between the fibre and the lattice, compound 
(Rashid et al., 2020). The physiochemical characteristics of banana fibre are listed 
in Table 5.1. The impact of compound alteration on the unique mechanical proper￾ties of banana fibre-supported polyester composites is being examined in order to 
explore the interfacial properties. The interfacial peculiarity was thus viewed to be 
connected with the inclusion of corrosive base cooperation, which happens because 
of the particular associations between less responsive utilitarian gatherings of each 
accomplice at the point of interaction (Srinivasababu et al., 2009). The fibre tech￾nology mainly focuses on the longevity, stability and inertness by increasing the 
usage of plant fibre-based composites. Cellulose is the most abundant component of 
plant fibre, followed by hemicellulose, lignin and gelatin (Thiagamani et al., 2022;

Chandrasekar et al., 2020). Table 5.2 presents the nutrient contents in the banana 
fibre. The higher the perspective proportion of the fibre, the higher is the elastic￾ity-aiding reinforcement possible. There are many studies being carried out using 
natural fibres such as coir, sisal, pineapple leaf fibre and banana (Venkateshwaran 
and Elayaperumal, 2010). The effect of fibre treatment of natural fibre improves 
the fibre–matrix bonding, while reinforcing themselves in the cellulose content and 
microfibrillar angle that manifests better mechanical behaviour to the material. One 
such fibre is banana fibre that has extremely notable improvement in mechanical, 
physical and chemical attributes (Shankar et al., 2013). About 64% of high cellu￾lose content with low microfibrillar angle of banana has better reinforcing potential. 
Some other composites, e.g., cotton hybrid fabric, are useful in the preparation of 
low-strength materials. The continuous improvement in the characteristics of natural

fibres, and the use of non-inexhaustible and non-biodegradable assets are expanding 
dramatically, in this modern age (Samivel and Babu, 2013). Normal strands, which 
have excellent mechanical qualities, are typically inexhaustible material assets all 
over the world, particularly in tropical regions. Regular filaments can be used as 
a substitute for designed strands in various ways due to their low thickness, low 
cost, their sustainability and biodegradability. Lately, specialists’ advantage has cen￾tred on the utilisation of normal strands, as support system in polymeric network 
(Hanifawati et al., 2011). By considering the ecological angle, it would be excep￾tionally beneficial to utilise regular filaments, rather than the manufactured strands. 
Normal natural filaments, such as coir, hemp, sisal, pineapple leaf strands, jute and 
others, were tested for their ability to be components in the production of thermoset 
composites. The gum is commonly injected at the lowest part of the form and fills 
it up to reduce air entrapment (Prabu et al., 2012). At the point when the sap begins 
to spill into the pitch trap, the cylinder is cinched to limit tar misfortune. Since the 
interaction happens in a shut form, the development of styrene will be lowered. Resin 
transfer moulding (RTM) doesn’t include huge infusion pressure. Infusion time goes 
from few moments for little and straightforward parts to hours for enormous, com￾plex parts with fibre-rich content (Pothan and Thomas, 2004). This has prompted 
the ecological contamination and has drawn in the consideration of a lot of analysts. 
Over the past several years, scientists have been working to include new classifica￾tions of materials and objects that are both environmentally friendly and practical to 
utilise (Senthilkumar et al., 2021; Alothman et al., 2020). This chapter emphasises 
the physical, mechanical and tribological characteristics of banana fibre-reinforced 
polymer composites, as well as the factor properties of the composites, with extensive 
industrial applications (Kusić et al. 2020).
5.1.1 Properties of Banana Fibre
Banana fibre has better density and microfibrillar angle than sisal and pineapple leaf 
and has better elongation properties compared to palmyra, sisal and pineapple leaf. 
Figure 5.1 depicts the image of paper extracted from banana plant fibres. Fibres such 
as coir and bagasse have lower tensile strength compared to banana fibre. Nicollier 
et al. (2001) studied the actual and mechanical properties of banana fibre concrete 
composites. The normal strands are called building materials, and the cellulose con￾tent and the microfibril point determine these real properties. The high cellulose 
content and the low microfibril level of the banana filaments emphasise their obvious 
suitability as a material for construction. In the material plan, the hybridisation of two 
single strands has become an effective method (Thomas et al., 2021; Senthilkumar 
et al., 2015, 2022). The mechanical characteristics of the cross-link have decreased 
by about half when compared to the hybridised link. Some studies have shown that 
banana strands and sisal twine offer good execution and can be used as suitable can￾didates in polyester netting (Laly et al., 2003 and Kalaprasad et al., 1997). In order to 
improve the mechanical characteristics, banana filaments were hybridised with glass 
strands. As a result, it may be deduced that the test produces relative designs rather 
than true structures.86 Polyester-Based Biocomposites
5.2 RESEARCH ON BANANA FIBRE-REINFORCED 
POLYESTER COMPOSITES
Biocomposites have emerged as a key component in the construction industry as 
widely used, lightweight and efficient composite designs. These biocomposites out￾perform their basic partners in terms of mechanical characteristics. The character￾istics of the biocomposites vary depending on the additive utilised. Hybridisation of 
banana fibres improves ductility.
Chandu et al. (2018) examined composites with specific fibre and matrix composi￾tions that boost the material’s strength. Pin-on-disc type friction and wear monitor 
with data collecting equipment were employed as the testing approach. The material 
is a banana pineapple fibre-reinforced hybrid composite that was manually laid up 
with epoxy glue and hardener as additional ingredients. Different composite combi￾nations were tested, as shown in Table 5.3.
The mechanical characteristics of these hybrid composites were investigated by 
using different weight fractions, viz. 2, 4 and 6 kg at 0.75 and 1m/s of sliding veloci￾ties. The wear behaviour of the composites is affected by the impact load and chemi￾cal bonding. Since the surface of the composites is made only with fibre and the 
matrix smooth, the penetration of load was higher and this led to higher weight loss 
when compared to the banana pineapple-reinforced hybrid composites. It is notewor￾thy that the hybrid composite with 30% banana/70% pineapple exhibited different 
loads at 1m/s sliding velocity, which resulted in lower weight loss and coefficient of 
friction. The fine distribution of fibres along with the chemical bonding between the 
matrix and reinforcements must be the reason behind the mechanical strength of this 
hybrid composite.
Karimi et al. (2014) employed a unidirectional glass/banana fibre epoxy laminate 
by using the hand laying technique and binder materials, resulting in increased ten￾sile strength between the composites. The Unidirectional Glass Fibre (UGF) contains 
high tensile strength values up to 567MPa that can be used for moderate-stability 
applications, especially in the construction articles, e.g., partition boards. In explor￾atory investigation, the creation of deserts in composites, for example, voids, breaks, 
framework and fibre crack, unfortunate holding, ill-advised network dispersion and 
FIGURE 5.1 Tuxing technique to separate fibre from pith.Banana Fibre-Reinforced Polyester Composites 87
nonalignment of filaments were the likely explanations for attaining lower ductile 
incentive for UGF and UB (Banana)/GF composites when contrasted with the theo￾retical/mathematical data.
Pujari et al. (2018) carried out some experiments by conducting thermal con￾ductivity measurements according to ASTM E 122587. Because of its non-reactive 
nature, the thermal conductivity of the compounds reduced as the volume percent￾ages of fenugreek increased. The fenugreek banana components were effective and 
had great heat resistance. The newly innovated composite material may be utilised 
for a variety of purposes, including steam pipes, car interior parts and electronics 
packages. The thermal conductivity of the composite was 0.259 W/mK at the greatest 
extreme volume percent of fenugreek.
Mohan et al., (2019) used banana fibres, untreated raw sodium montmorillonite 
clay along with some binders, e.g., epoxy materials and hardeners infused with 
nanoparticles. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) examination and wear tests 
were employed in the experiments. Microscopy analysis revealed that Nanoclay 
Banana Fibre-supported composites indicated a moving layer between the wear 
test example worn surface and the counter face, resulting in improved wear quali￾ties. Additionally, the micro-clay particles added, increased the hardness and the 
grating to the composites, thereby enhancing the deterioration of the composites 
qualities.
Wang et al. (2016) experimented with raw coconut fibre and waste banana 
stalk fibre along with adhesives, such as phenol formaldehyde and paraffin wax, 
as waterproofing agents. The material was tested for its mechanical integrity, 
viz. elastic modulus, thickness and elasticity. The mechanical properties of the 
Coir Banana (CB) molecular sheet were directly related to the fibre content of 
the banana. The high surface area of the banana fibres and the microstructure 
qualities led to a hike in the phenol formaldehyde content and the 24 h average 
thickness swelling ranges for CB chipboard. The appearance of the CB agglom￾eration was impacted by the organisation of the banana fibre component, which 
was ascribed to two features of the banana fibre, viz. higher cellulose and hemi￾cellulose content and lower lignin content.
Vigneshkumar and Rajasekaran (2018) employed sisal, kenaf, banana and carbon 
fibre filler material in polyester resin and catalytic materials. The fibre-supported

polymer composite on Pin on a plate hardware was used to accomplish the experi￾ment. With the enlarged burden of a symmetrical display technique, the wear and 
frictional characters of carbon, fibre of sisal and rice husk composites were enhanced. 
The weight of the sisal, kenaf and banana fibre composite was reduced further as the 
heap and sliding speeds increased. The wear and frictional forces of the sisal and rice 
husk composites were more problematic when it came to the speeding up and time.
Hariprasad et al. (2013) used woven fibres from banana psuedostem with coconut 
to improve tensile strength. The half-and-half salt-treated banana–coconut–epoxy 
composite exhibited significantly higher stiffness and potency than an untreated 
mixed banana–coconut–epoxy composite, according to their findings. Antacid is 
a type of antiseptic. The flexural strength of the treated banana–coir–epoxy half￾and-half composite was lower than that of the composite blended with untreated 
banana–coir–epoxy. This study was useful in determining the advantages of fibre 
mix composites in the underlying applications, as well as in identifying where 
stresses were fundamental and harmed the connection point under varied stacking 
settings. The centres of the top sections of the intermediate components employed in 
the Finite Element Analysis are the most concerning.
Alavudeen et al. (2010) used the banana and kenaf fibres along with the catalyst 
and polyester as the matrix and reported the fact that the fabric tensile test showed 
a maximum stress of 137.221MPa, leading to the development of a good clutch disc 
compound, especially in terms of stiffness and strength. This composite material had 
high machinability and would extend clutch disc lifespan and decrease energy loss 
during power transfer. Banana and kenaf fibres have been found to be viable rein￾forcements in the creation of a reinforced composite alternatives and novel material 
for low-cost clutch disc applications.
Estrada et al. (2015) experimented with banana fibre containing 6% sodium 
hydroxide with epoxy resin and catalyst/network association. After fibre pre-treat￾ment, the banana fibre/epoxy composite exhibited the greatest compressive strength 
of 122.11MPa, which was 38.35% greater than that obtained without treatment. 
The banana fibre/eco-polyester composites had the highest compressive strength of 
122.88MPa, which was attained without fibre pre-treatment. Higher ecological clog￾ging was observed for the epoxy/banana fibre composites with soluble pre-treatment, 
followed by the untreated banana/polyester fibre composites. Due to the advance￾ment in fibre/lattice formulation, fibre pre-treatment is crucially important for epoxy 
composites and the weakening of the work of the successive fibre arrangements in 
polyester composites.
Subramanya et al. (2020) used the water tank roasting method to extract banana 
fibre from the pseudostem part of the plant. The weight ratio of the composite was 
3:7, consisting of fibres and epoxy resin, together with 10% (w/w) grade K6 as a hard￾ener. Two composite laminates were experimented, one with alkali-treated banana 
fibre and the other with untreated banana fibre. Previous studies had found that ten￾sile strength was directly related to fibre-matrix bonding. The caustic-treated fibre 
composite had better tensile strength than the untreated fibre, representing a signifi￾cant difference of ~15.8%. The impact strength was 27.28% higher for the treated 
banana compound than the untreated. SEM analysis showed that the voids in the 
green fibre composite were the result of poor adhesions in the fibre and epoxy resin. Banana Fibre-Reinforced Polyester Composites 89
The smooth surface of the untreated fibres resulted in a poor epoxy bonding to the 
fibres. This reduced the adhesions/interactions between them and resulted in a lower 
tensile strength. Therefore, this study showed that the alkali-treated banana fibre 
composite had better impact strength, tensile strength and fracture toughness than 
the untreated banana fibre composite.
Bilba et al. (2007) experimented on the banana stalk with 9% alkali and 25% of 
sulphidity treatments to make a cement matrix. Pulped banana fibre (Cavendish) was 
found to be suitable for use in a concrete network. The flexural characteristic of over 
20MPa was recorded at a stacking of between 8% and 16% by mass (as high as those 
found in a few engineered strands-supported concretes and up to 90% that of pulped 
softwood fibre concrete materials). The flexural strength was about 25MPa and the 
fracture durability was 1.74 kJ m2 at a 14% fibre stacking by mass. The mechanical 
tests revealed that a fibre content of ~12% by mass resulted in an excellent representa￾tion of the various waste fibre-reinforced composites, with flexural strength improve￾ment of ~20MPa and toughness value in the range of ~1.01.5 kJ m2.
Banana fibres with unsaturated polyester and methyl ethyl ketone peroxide as a 
hardener were reported by Jannah et al. (2009). The stiffness and modulus of elas￾ticity of the composite were extended in relation to the volumetric expansion of a 
portion of fibreglass due to fibreglass’s closer resemblance to banana fibre with poly￾styrene. The impact of fibre content, fibre stacking and the blending effect on the 
mechanical characteristics such as elasticity, elastic modulus, elongation-at-break 
and flexural properties of composites were investigated. Table 5.4 comprises the den￾sity and thermal conductivity of PP (polypropylene) and banana fibre composites. In 
addition to the elongation-at-break, the volume fraction of the glass fibre, in terms of 
the absolute fibre fraction, enhances the mechanical characteristics in each situation. 
The elastic and flexural characteristics of the composites were shown to improve 
when the fibre stacking was increased (vol.%). The reticular fibre’s perfect qualities 
were further refined when the banana fibre was modified. The additive rule of cross￾breeds was used to assess the cross potency.
Paul et al. (2008) used polypropylene fibres and banana fibres to make a composite 
and analysed the thermophysical properties of these composites. Banana fibres have 
been chemically treated with alkali, potassium permanganate, benzoyl chloride and 
silane. These treatments increased the thermophysical properties of the composites.

The benzoylated fibre composite and the 10% caustic (NaOH)-treated composite had 
higher thermal conductivity than the untreated fibre composite. This was due to the 
benzoylation treatment, leading to reduced hydrophilicity of the fibre. This increases 
the compatibility of the fibre with the hydrophobic polypropylene matrix. Sodium 
hydroxide pre-treatment removed the hydrogen bonds in the cellulose and activated the 
fibre surface for benzoylation. The cavities created during the treatment, interlocked 
with the matrix surface and contributed to the strengthening of the composite materials.
Due to the treatment with alkali, the banana fibre surface became rough, and it 
created small voids for interlocking with the matrix, which is schematically por￾trayed in Figure 5.2. Irrespective of the type of treatments, the chemicals affect 
the thermal conductivity of the composites. As the alkali concentration increased 
by 8%, there was an increase of 9% in the thermal conductivity and 10% increase 
in the thermal diffusivity. On treatment with permanganate, the thermal diffusiv￾ity increased by 16% when compared to the untreated fibre composite, whereas the 
silane (tetraethoxysilane)-treated fibre composite had an increase of 8% when com￾pared to the untreated composite. The benzoylated fibre composite had the highest 
increase of ~25% in the thermal diffusivity and 16% increase in the thermal conduc￾tivity when compared to the untreated fibre composites.
Pujari et al. (2017) studied the thermal conductivity of jute fibre composites and 
banana fibre composites. As the fibre content in the composite increased, its ther￾mal conductivity decreased. Comparing the thermal conductivity of the banana fibre 
composite, which was 0.228, the jute fibres had a conductivity greater than 0.231 
in a temperature range between 20°C and 300°C. Hence, banana fibres can easily 
find application in insulation items such as furniture, insulation boards and aircraft 
components.
In the study by Haneefa et al. (2008), while attempting to increase the quali￾ties of the fibre matrix, banana fibre was combined with glass fibre and polystyrene 
glass. The associated characters of glass fibres and banana fibres led the composite’s

elasticity and modulus of elasticity to increase in relation to the volumetric expansion 
of glass fibres with the use of polystyrene as the matrix. The effect of fibre content, 
fibre stacking and shearing on the mechanical properties of the volume fraction of 
the glass fibre, such as stiffness, modulus of elasticity, elongation-at-break and flex￾ural properties, was evaluated in terms of the total fibre fraction, which, in addition to 
the elongation-at-break, extended the values of all the mechanical properties tested. 
It was discovered that when the stacking of (percent by volume) rose, the deform￾ability and flexural characteristics of the composites improved. The modification of 
the banana fibre surface further developed the ideal properties of the fibre structure.
Shivankar and Mukhopadhyay (2019) used three types of banana fibre to deter￾mine the bending length by using a polypropylene pleat as the matrix. Grain Naine’s 
banana nonwoven texture exhibited a high percentage of elongation for cross-machine 
support. Fleece structure blend saw was used as a parallel laid (P.L.)-100% banana 
fleece structure. The shot fastness of the P. nonwoven texture was higher than the 
Cross-laid (C.) nonwoven texture for three assortments of banana strands, both on 
the machine and in the cross-pass. The curvature length of the nonwoven structure 
C. banana was greater than that of nonwoven structure.
Laly et al. (2003) experimented on banana fibre along with unsaturated polyester 
resin. The tensile strength of the banana fibre was increased when added with the 
polyester material. The greatest rigidity was attained at 30mm fibre length, while 
the sway strength yielded the most extreme incentive for the 40mm fibre length. The 
joining of 40% untreated filaments, yielded a 20% increment in the rigidity and a 
341% expansion in the sway strength. On treatment with silane coupling agent, the 
composites showed a 28% expansion in rigidity and a 13% increment in the flexural 
strength. Studies showed a reduction in the rigidity of the composites. The explor￾atory elasticity values were contrasted with hypothetical expectations, hence con￾curring with the Piggot condition. Electron microscopy studies were completed in 
order to comprehend the morphology of the fibre surface, fibre pull-out and point of 
interaction holding. Water assimilation studies showed an expansion in water take-up 
with increases in the fibre content. In conclusion, the authors contrasted the proper￾ties of banana fibre in polyester composites and other commonly available natural 
fibre-supported composites.
Jeyasekaran et al. (2016) investigated the tensile strength of glass fibre and banana 
glass fibre-reinforced epoxy composites. The value of the experimental stress for 
the glass fibre-reinforced composite was 567.7MPa, which was higher than that for 
banana glass fibre-reinforced composite having a value of 295.38MPa. This vast 
difference was due to the fabrication defects, such as improper alignment of fibres, 
voids, non-uniformly distributed matrix and low inter-bonds between matrix and 
fibres. There was no major difference between the average load-displacement of 
these two fibre composites. Hence, they can be used for the manufacturing of house￾hold materials, such as partition boards, which require moderate strength.
Sreekumar et al. (2008) investigated banana fibre, used in composites and 
arranged by the RTM method. All investigations were accomplished by shifting the 
length of the fibre and its stacking. SEM studies were carried out in order to have an 
understanding into network cooperation, fibre direction along its breakage or defor￾mation. The idea of the fibre-reinforced composites relies upon few factors such 92 Polyester-Based Biocomposites
as fibre length, fibre content and void substance. The reliance of the mechanical 
properties, e.g., elasticity and Young’s modulus, is highly dependent on the length 
of the fibre in the composite. Obviously, as the length of the fibre increases from 
least 10 to a maximum of 30mm, the elasticity and Young’s modulus show a rising 
pattern and these two were most extreme at 30mm. The pressure strain examination 
was conducted on the banana-supported polyester composites with fibre stacking. 
Here, additionally at minimum strain esteems, the composites showed a direct trend 
of behaviour and when the strain % increased, a nonlinear way of behaviour was 
noticed. The increment in the fibre content builds the pliability, which is appar￾ent from the elongation-at-break values. The elasticity and Young’s modulus of the 
composites were 223% and 226% higher than those of the unreinforced plastic. At 
lower fibre stacking, scattering of fibre is extremely poor so much so that the pres￾sure transmission across the composite would not happen, as expected. At greater 
fibre stacking, there was a solid inclination for fibre connection. In those frame￾works, the break initiation and its spread will be more straightforward. The SEM 
for the elastic surface of composites tests was undertaken in order to comprehend its 
crack component that are tractable via fractography, for the composites containing 
40 and 50 vol.% of fibre. Over the cracked surface of the composite, fibre breakage, 
fibre pull-out and fibrillation can be observed. At the maximum fibre stacking point, 
there was void development because of fibre pull-out, which was additionally high 
and was obvious from the SEM results.
Tuan et al. (2014) studied the regular threads from banana tree bark (banana 
strands), a material that is readily available in Vietnam. These threads were utilised 
to support the composite material. Banana strands were removed from banana strips, 
and then pre-treated with 5% NaOH and sliced to a standard length of 30mm. The 
banana fibre was made with mass percent of 10, 15, 20 and 25wt.% for an epoxy 
pitch Epikote resin 240 matrix. The results were evaluated, based on the underlying 
morphology, mechanical qualities, fire resistance and thermal properties. The trac￾table, compressive and sway properties of the biosynthetic materials, up to the 20% 
by weight, had expanded when compared to epoxy perfect, according to preliminary 
findings. The fire resistance and warmth were maintained, while the 20wt.% banana 
fibre inclusion in the epoxy resin provided a restricting oxygen record of 20.8% and 
a good warmth consistency. Table 5.5 describes the various composites derived from 
the application of banana fibres.
5.3 CONCLUSION
Accordingly, it is presumed that because of banana fibre’s enticing properties and 
its varying uses will serve a significant part in the advancement of its anticipated 
popularity in the fibre industry. The results of different tests conducted on the fibre 
indicate the fact that it is increasingly being used in a variety of industries. Fibres 
can be used as a filler in a mix with other strands in order to improve the qualities 
of basic filaments. Economically effective composites with high elasticity and flex￾ural properties can be developed through the legal use of banana filaments. Banana 
filaments show a high ability to change along the length and between strands. This 
is a grade of normal filaments to fully delineate the banana strands and allow Banana Fibre-Reinforced Polyester Composites 93 TABLE 5.5 Various Composites of Banana Fibre and Outcomes of Their Analysis S.

On comparing other hybrids, the efficient bonding between matrix and the fibre in the hybrid composition ratio of 3B:7P, showed the minimum weight loss and wear value at various loads with a sliding velocity of 1m/s.

Compared to the glass banana fibre composite, the unidirectional glass fibre composites 
had a higher tensile strength up to 567.7MPa on a load of 60 kN.
In the application viewpoint, they can be used for household appliances that require 
moderate strength.

No. Composition of the Composite Analysis Inferences References 6 Banana fibres, polyurethane matrix form castor oil, NaOH, polyol, prepolymer, resin Tensile properties, surface morphology using SEM, ATR- FTIR (Attenuated Total Reflectance Infrared Spectroscopy) The tensile strength increased to a maximum of 268.9MPa with an increase in treatment time. The dynamic tensile properties are proportional to the quantity and length of banana fibres in the composite. The absorption rate of 2273 cm−1 represents the free isocyanate groups in the concentrated polyurethane. The absence of these bands indicates the cross-linking between the isocyanate groups with the hydroxyl groups on the treated banana fibres. This increases the tensile strength and the storage modulus. Merlini (2011) 7 Banana fibres, epoxy resin, NaOH, hardener, petroleum jelly Physical and mechanical properties The increase in length of the fibre in the composite determined the increase of the tensile strength, compressive strength and flexural strength, moisture absorption and void content. The flexural strength increased with the fibre length of 25mm. The maximum fibre length up to 15mm increased the tensile strength to its maximum. Sumaila (2013) 8 Fibres of banana and sisal, polyester resin, methyl ethyl ketone peroxide (curing agent), cobalt naphthenate (catalyst) Tensile properties, flexural properties, impact properties, surface morphology As the banana fibre fraction increased, the tensile strength of the hybrid composite also enhanced. As Vf of banana was fixed in 0.19, the flexural modulus attained its maximum. More economical and value-added composites can be produced from this hybrid combination of banana sisal fibres. Maries Indicula (2004) 9 Banana pseudostem stalk, alkali, 25% sulphidity, portland cement as matrix Flexural properties, fracture energy, water absorption rate The fracture toughness depends upon the aspect ratio and the fibre content. A maximum of 16% fibre mass was studied and analysed with the resulting fracture toughness. It was 1.79kJ m2, which was 45–50 times higher than that of the matrix material. There was a decrease in the modulus of elasticity from 14 to 6GPa, with an increase in the fibre content from 2% to 16%.

suitable applications in regular fibre composites. A composite frame comprising 
cross-grip panels with strength and unyielding was created using wear-resistant 
banana fibre material. The banana strip shows promise as a material for further￾ing a worldwide bioremediation strategy for effluents containing hazardous com￾binations. In order to ameliorate the ductile properties of the banana, a synthetic 
modification to the regular polymer system (antacid treatment, benzoyl chloride 
treatment and polystyrene maleic anhydride) could be carried out. Composite 
expansion showed a copious reduction in the hydrophilicity of the banana fibre 
and improved fibre/structure similarity through mechanical fixation of the body 
and substance retention. By hybridising sisal fibre and banana yielded an economi￾cally intelligent banana standard for the construction of the polymer with adequate 
strength, and, hence, composites of cushioning characteristics can be created. As a 
result of the current research, it was determined that banana fibre may be used as 
an anticipated support in a polyester network.

6.1 INTRODUCTION
Polyesters, which feature an ester functional group in their backbone, are particularly 
significant polymers. Polyesters can be found in nature or synthesized [1]. Synthetic 
polyesters are typically nonbiodegradable but natural polyesters are biodegradable. 
The polyester can be classified into two classes which are thermoplastic and thermo￾set, according to their chemical structure [2]. Similarly, depending on the primary 
chain, polyesters can be aliphatic, aromatic, or semi-aromatic. Aromaticity improves 
thermal stability, mechanical strength, glass transition temperature, and chemical 
stability in polyesters. Polycaprolactone, polylactic acid, polyhydroxyalkanoate, 
polyethylene adipate, polyethylene terephthalate, polybutylene terephthalate, and 
polyethylene naphthalate are some of the examples (Figure 6.1).
Moreover, moisture resistance, fire resistance, mechanical and thermal properties, 
liquid crystal qualities, and environmental stability are all advantages of synthetic 
polyesters. Films, capacitor components, liquid crystal displays, car interiors, holo￾grams, wire insulation, jet engine seals, tapes, and textiles are all made from polyes￾ters [3]. In addition, car body parts and watercraft have both used polyester resin and 
glass fibre (GF) composites [4].
Since the 1980s, the utilization of natural fibres in polyester composites has 
piqued interest. Hemp, jute, banana, sisal, coir, kenaf, bamboo, rice, oil palm, and 
flax were among the plant fibres utilized to reinforce the polyester matrix. These 
fibres have attracted renewed interest as replacements for artificial fibres such as car￾bon, aramid, and glass in the automotive industry. In contrast, natural fibres provide 
a number of advantages over synthetic fibres, including low cost, low density, accept￾able specific strength qualities, ease of separation, carbon dioxide sequestration, and

biodegradability. The fibres in fibre-reinforced composites operate as reinforcement, 
providing strength and stiffness to the composite structure [5–11]. In addition, these 
natural fibre composites are found to have a better electrical resistance, good ther￾mal and acoustic insulating properties, and higher resistance to fracture. Moreover, 
they are also renewable, have high strength and stiffness, and cause no skin irrita￾tion. Nonetheless, in a humid environment, these fibres are very vulnerable to water 
absorption. Chemical treatment of these fibres’ surfaces improved their interfacial 
characteristics, lowering the composite’s water absorption [12–14].
Among the natural fibres, the usage palm fibre has been increased. In recent, 
palm tree extracts have been used by a number of researchers in a variety of matrices 
[15–19]. On the other hand, leaf fibres, meshes, Ijuk, and empty fruit bunches have 
demonstrated distinct properties [20]. Every year, palm harvesting generates tons of 
biomass fibrous wastes around the world, which can be recycled and used to make 
palm natural fibre composite. The majority of palm fibre research has been done in 
Malaysia and India, as illustrated in Figure 6.2, due to the high availability of these 
resources in those countries.
The ability of palm natural fibre composite to be used in a variety of applica￾tions has been demonstrated by the results of many investigations. Nonetheless, the 
physical, mechanical, and morphological properties of these composites, as well as 
matrix/fibre bonding, production methods, and dispersion characteristics, must all 
be thoroughly investigated before they are used in industrial applications to ensure 
dependable and repeatable results. However, significant drawbacks exist, such as 
fibre microstructure modification when subjected to pressures and water absorption. 
In addition, natural fibres are known for having limited heat stability, as most fibres 
begin to degrade at temperatures exceeding 200°F. To avoid the decomposition of 
lignocellulose components, which would prevent the composite from performing 
FIGURE 6.1 Examples of polyester.102 Polyester-Based Biocomposites
optimally, the processing temperature and operation parameters must be carefully 
chosen. Some of these flaws are resolved through fibre treatments and matrix modi￾fication [21].
Therefore, the goal of this review is to classify and summarize recent research on 
the main categories of palm natural fibre composites and their mechanical, thermal, 
and wettability properties. Additionally, the factors that affect the palm natural fibre￾reinforced polyester are discussed in this review.
6.2 PALM FIBRE
Elaeis guineensis (oil palm tree) is one of the most valuable plants in Malaysia, 
Indonesia, and Thailand. Palm trees are planted for oil on around 15 million hect￾ares, and each hectare produces about 11 tonnes of dry biomass. Currently, oil palm 
production has increased by double in the last decades, and it has been the most 
productive fruit crop on the globe for over two decades. Due to this reason, biomass 
waste from the oil palm sector has been estimated in millions of tonnes due to the 
expansion of the palm industry. If we effectively utilize oil palm biomass, we will 
not only solve the disposal problem, but we will also be able to add value to this 
biomass product. One of the agricultural by-products is fronds (leaves), with an esti￾mated global production of 164 million tonnes of fronds per year. The palm trees 
also give two additional sources of fibre in addition to the fronds. The fibrous empty 
fruit bunches or known as oil palm empty fruit bunch (OPEFB) have been explored 
as possible fibre sources after the seeds have been harvested. Approximately 22 g 
of palm oil is produced every kilogram of fruit bunch, while roughly a kilogram of 
OPEFB is produced. After the oil is extracted, the mesocarp remains in the seed, 
which can be also used as a source of fibre. Essentially, natural retting method can

Composites” and “Palm”; Date: 26 February 2022. Documents by country or territory.)A Review on Palm Fibre-Reinforced Polyester Composites 103
provide roughly 400g of fibres from each OPEFB on average. Typical OPEFB fibre 
composition is classified as lignocellulosic residues containing about 63% cellulose, 
18% hemicellulose, and 18% lignin. Due to the high content of cellulose, natural 
cellulose fibres have been isolated from a variety of palm tree species and sections. 
Figure 6.3 depicts the oil palm tree and its biomass.
There are several other types of palm fibres such as sugar palm and date palm. 
For example, Hyphaene thebaica (doum palm), a plant native to upper Africa, was 
used to remove fibres from the folioles and leaf stalks. The plant portions were split 
into fibres for mechanical extraction by beating and grating to free the fibres, which 
were then dried in the air. Another example is sugar palm fibre (SPF) extracted from 
Arenga Pinnata plant, a Palmae family plant originated from Indonesia. Fibre from 
sugar palm tree could be extracted from four different morphological parts, i.e. 
fronds, trunk, bunch, and Ijuk (surface of trunk). The extraction of SPFs is started by 
soaking them in a water tank to remover dirt before the palm stalks are occasionally 
stirred to accelerate the separation process. The SPFs were dried at room tempera￾ture before use [23]. According to Ishak et al. [24], the content of cellulose, hemi￾cellulose, and lignin in sugar palm trees is determined by the palm tree’s height. In 
comparison to fibres of 5–15m height, the composition of 1m height fibres contained 
more impurities such as silica. Indication of presence silica is related to ash content. 
Ash content for 5–15m height of fibres is less than 10%, as compared to 1m fibres 
which contained more than 30%. In general, the composition of cellulose, hemicel￾luloses, and lignin in 1m fibres was lower (37.3%, 4.71%, and 17.93%, respectively), 
compared to the composition of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin in fibres at 5m 
and above (53.41%–56.8%, 7.45%–7.93%, 20.45%–24.92%, respectively).
In Middle Eastern countries, the date palm (Phoenix dactylifera) is an important 
source of economic and social life. They are common in Qatar, which has abundance

of palm trees. The date palm’s fibres can be harvested and used in a variety of appli￾cations. Khalasa date palm fibres, which were taken from stems, are one of the exam￾ples. The Khalasa leaflet was submerged in water, shredded into fibre bundles, and 
lastly dried at room temperature. Long strands of fibres were painstakingly extracted 
using a specially designed needle brush. The green date palm, dried date palm leaf￾let, and continuous date palm leaflet fibres are depicted in Figure 6.4. In the Khalasa 
date palm, cellulose contributes for 47.14% of its weight, followed by lignin 36.73%, 
and hemicellulose 16.13% [25].
Palm fibres are promising materials for numerous applications such as absorbent 
material for different oils [28,29], thermal and acoustic insulation [30,31], reinforce￾ment after acid and alkali treatment [32], cement composites [33,34], thermoplas￾tic composites [35,36], and nanocomposites [37–40]. For example, Neoh et al. [41] 
investigated the composition of diacylglycerol (DAG) and lauric acid extracted using 
different hexane extraction procedures (cold, soxhlet, and reflux). The goal is to find 
the best palm pressed fibre (PPF) oil for premium hard stock manufacture. PPF is 
a by-product of oil palm fruit extraction. PPF has unique properties as a result of 
the mixture of palm mesocarp fibre, kernel shell, and crushed kernel. As a result, 
PPF oil inherited all of the products’ properties, such as high triglycerides, palmitic 
and oleic content from the mesocarp, and gaining high DAG and lauric acid from 
the palm kernel. Data revealed that as compared to soxhlet extraction, reflux and 
FIGURE 6.4 (a) Green date palm, (b) dried date palm, and (c) date palm leaflet fibres. 
(Reproduced from Ref. [25].)A Review on Palm Fibre-Reinforced Polyester Composites 105
cold extraction yielded a higher recovered oil yield. Cold extraction is the preferred 
approach for acylglyceride extraction since it yields more DAG. Therefore, the author 
proposed that cold extraction delivers a higher amount of DAG and a reasonable 
amount of oil with minimal effort, which is ideal for premium hardstock raw mate￾rial manufacturing.
On the other hand, Chaktouna et al. [42] used date palm fibres as novel photocata￾lyst for efficient dye removal. The authors used date palm fibres from the leaves of 
date palm trees grown in Morocco and combined with titanium dioxide as green pho￾tocatalyst of cationic and anionic dyes photodegradation. X-ray diffraction, Fourier 
transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy coupled to 
energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, and nitrogen 
adsorption–desorption were used to evaluate the green photocatalyst. The results 
reveal that it has a high capacity for adsorption of Congo red and methylene blue dyes 
under optimum parameters, with excellent regeneration after a few cycles and simple 
separation. Taban et al. [43] created sound-absorbing panels from date palm fibres. 
The absorption coefficient of panels of varying thicknesses was examined using an 
impedance tube and modelled using both the Johnson–Champoux–Allard and the 
Attenborough models. The findings indicate that samples with a thickness of 55mm 
and a density of 175kg/m3 have the best sound absorption performance and thus can 
be implemented to improve room acoustics characteristics.
Modification of palm fibre with other materials could enhance the performance of 
palm fibres. For instance, Darryle et al. [44] employed hydrogen peroxide to modify 
date palm fibre and evaluated its adsorption capacity against sodium diclofenac in an 
aqueous solution. The surface functionalization was tailored using a plasma device. 
The adsorption investigation was conducted with a few variables such as pH, adsor￾bent size, and temperature. The results showed that plasma-modified palm fibres 
had excellent diclofenac adsorption performance, which was strongly dependent on 
the pH solution. As an adsorption mechanism, non-covalent interactions such as 
electrostatic interaction, hydrogen bonding, and van der Waals forces are involved.

[54]A Review on Palm Fibre-Reinforced Polyester Composites 107
Therefore, palm fibres may be promoted as a low-cost adsorbent material for con￾trolling water pollution caused by pharmaceuticals. Esterified OPEFB fibre was 
explored as an oil absorption material in the marine sector by Asadpour et al. [29]. 
Their kinetic and isotherm studies, as well as their physical and chemical character￾ization, are well discussed in this study. The presence of hydroxyl and ester groups 
in the FTIR spectra proved the esterification of oil palm fibres. The pseudo-second￾order model was better fitted by R2, which represents the correlation coefficient, 
and qe, which represents the adsorption quantity. The crude oil was adsorbed as a 
monolayer onto the surface of the treated oil palm fibre, according to batch isotherm 
data. Hence, the use of fatty acid oil palm fibres as an economical sorbent for crude 
oil clean-up could be widely considered.
6.3 PRETREATMENT OF PALM FIBRE
6.3.1 The Important of Pretreatment of Fibre for Composites Production
Pretreatment of fibre is a very important step in composites production, as it would 
remove the lignin present (i.e. delignification) by altering or modifying the compo￾sition of lignocellulosic macrostructure and microstructure, which would therefore 
result in the increase of its surface area and improve the porosity of lignocellulosic 
material [9,55–60]. Apart from that, pretreatment methods could also reduce the 
crystallinity of cellulose [57]. It is understandable that each operating facility for 
composites production would aim for a more resourceful pretreatment method (i.e. 
cheap, easy to operate, and form a substantial percentage of yield), and it is important 
to note that the pretreatment methods need to be selected thoroughly based on the 
lignin profile as the amount of lignin present varies in each type of oil palm biomass 
(i.e. oil palm mesocarp fibre (OPMF), oil palm empty fruit bunch (OPEFB), oil palm 
trunk (OPT), oil palm frond (OPF), and oil palm leaves (OPL)) [5,58,61]. For instance, 
oil palm mesocarp (OPMF) recorded the highest amount of lignin (24.88%), whereas 
OPEFB had the lowest composition of lignin (14.25%) [58]. On a related note, selec￾tion of pretreatment method should also be made upon consideration of the effects on 
the final product and its composition [58].
6.3.2  Several Types of Pretreatment That Have
Been Applied to the Palm Fibre
There are several types of pretreatment methods, which are grouped into three 
main categories: (1) physical pretreatment, (2) chemical pretreatment, and (3) bio￾logical pretreatment [58]. Both physical and chemical pretreatment methods are 
widely used due to their low cost and user-friendliness but the biological pre￾treatment method could offer more in terms of its reduced energy consumption, 
better productivity, greater specificity, and also forming non-toxic components 
[62]. Physical pretreatment method includes milling, pyrolysis, and hydrothermal 
treatment, while acid, alkaline, and organic solvents are used in the chemical 
pretreatment, and biological pretreatment involves the use of microorganisms and 
enzymatic reaction [58].108 Polyester-Based Biocomposites
6.3.1.1 Physical Pretreatment
6.3.1.1.1 Milling
This green approach (i.e. it does not produce any toxic or inhibitory compounds and 
does not require any harmful chemicals) can reduce the particle size to 0.2mm and 
indirectly leads to improved enzymatic hydrolysis in later steps as milling can loosen 
the cellulose structure and retain the micro-fibre structure in the hydrogen bond 
fracture [63]. Additionally, it can also increase the degree of polymerization of the 
biomass and decrease crystalline structure. Examples of milling pretreatment meth￾ods are ball milling, two-roll milling, colloid milling, rod milling, vibratory mill￾ing, hammer milling, and wet disc milling. Despite all the advantages it possesses, 
this approach consumes high energy for the operation of machinery (i.e. expensive) 
which exceeds the cost of particle size reduction as well as requires the capital cost 
of mechanical equipment [64].
6.3.1.1.2 Extrusion
Similar to milling technique, extrusion machines (single-screw extruders and twin￾screw extruders) increase accessibility of cellulose, does not produce inhibitors such 
as furfural and HMF, and are eco-friendly but demand high energy consumption 
[65]. The mechanism of extrusion starts when the raw materials are passing through 
the rotating screws positioned in a tight barrel of the extruders resulting in the break￾ing down of the lignocellulose biomass. The high temperature (>300°C) of the barrel 
also causes chemical changes in the biomass [65]. It is interesting to note that extrud￾ers can be modified according to needs as the design of the screws, the rotational 
speed, and the temperature within the barrel are the main parameters controlling the 
extrusion pretreatment method [66].
6.3.1.2 Chemical Pretreatment
6.3.1.2.1 Acid pretreatment
Inorganic acids (i.e. H2SO4, H3PO4, HNO3, and HCl) or organic acids (i.e. formic 
acid, maleic acid, oxalic acid, acetic acid, and citric acid) are employed as a catalyst 
to hydrolyze carbohydrates (i.e. hemicellulose), thereby weakening the lignin–hemi￾cellulose barrier [67]. In general, the use of organic acids holds several advantages 
over the inorganic acids as they do not generate lignocellulose-derived compounds 
during fermentation process, less toxic, and produce comparatively fewer inhibitory 
compounds in the hydrolysate [68]. On a related note, pretreatment can be carried 
out using either diluted acids (0.1% to 10% at 120°C–200°C) or concentrated acids 
(30%–70% at lower than 100°C) [69]. Diluted acids are often preferred over concen￾trated acids for lignocellulose pretreatment due to their high reaction rate and ability 
to support continuous production processes without the need for recycling. In addi￾tion, diluted acids create a more gradual decrease in pH, allowing microorganisms 
used in subsequent fermentation steps to better adapt to the low-pH environment. 
This can lead to more efficient conversion of the lignocellulosic material to biofuels 
or other value-added products [70]. On the other hand, there are several drawbacks 
when using the acid pretreatment such as the need of using individual reactors to 
withstand corrosion and requirements to perform subsequent detoxification, washing, A Review on Palm Fibre-Reinforced Polyester Composites 109
and neutralizing before further processing, which would impact the operational and 
maintenance costs and be time-consuming [71]. Other than that, Eom et al. [72] 
observed that acid pretreatment causes starch to degrade to form HMF under severe 
conditions.
6.3.1.2.2 Alkaline pretreatment
Hydroxides such as NaOH, H2O2, NH4OH, KOH, and Ca(OH)2 are used to break 
down the intermolecular ester linkage between hemicellulose and lignin through a 
saponification reaction [58]. This results in the solubilization of lignin and changes 
to the lignin structure, which exposes the cellulose and enlarges its internal sur￾face area. This enhanced surface area facilitates enzymatic hydrolysis in subsequent 
steps, leading to higher sugar yields that can be converted into valuable products [73]. 
Previous studies showed that it can also decrease the polymerization and degree of 
crystallinity of cellulose as well as remove acetyl and various uronic acid in hemicel￾lulose [58]. Alkali pretreatment has several advantages as it can be operated at low 
temperature and pressure, making it a less-energy consumption process, degrades 
less sugar, and only solubilizes a limited amount of hemicellulose, but it is important 
to note that this method is only suitable for biomass with low lignin content and 
requires extensive washing and neutralizing before proceeding to further enzymatic 
hydrolysis [64]. In addition, Noorshamsiana et al. [71] stated that alkali salts can be 
converted to irrecoverable salts and may get absorbed by the biomass, making them 
difficult to recover.
6.3.1.2.3 Organic solvent pretreatment
Ethanol, methanol, acetone, glycerol, aqueous phenol, ethylene glycol, triethylene 
glycol, and aqueous n-butanol are some of the organic solvents used in this type of 
chemical pretreatment [58]. This inexpensive and less toxic method reaction is per￾formed at temperatures between 150°C and 200°C (i.e. low boiling points), whereby 
the organic solvent would hydrolyze the biomass internal bonds (i.e. unbounding the 
linkage between lignin and hemicellulose) and increase the pore size, thus increas￾ing its accessibility for further reactions [64]. In addition, Kapoor et al. [64] out￾lined that the reaction rate would also increase with the addition of acids or bases 
as catalysts. Other than that, increasing the concentration of organic solvent such as 
ethanol would enhance the delignification process outcome, thus promoting cellulose 
and hemicellulose to be converted into sugars through acid hydrolysis. Although the 
organic solvent is considered less toxic towards environment, it may be hazardous 
when handled in large quantities and is highly flammable [58].
6.3.1.3 Biological Pretreatment
Biological pretreatment approaches can be performed either by using complete/whole 
organisms such as bacteria or fungi (brown-rot fungi that can break down cellulose 
and have hydrolytic role, white-rot fungi which can selectively degrade lignin, and 
soft-rot fungi) or enzymes extracted from these organisms or synthesized artificially 
such as lignin peroxidase, versatile peroxidase, manganese peroxidase, and laccases 
[71,74]. Of note, enzymes such as lignin peroxidase and manganese peroxidase play 
a role as oxidizing agent to oxidize non-phenolic lignin and phenolic ring lignin, 110 Polyester-Based Biocomposites
respectively, whereas the versatile peroxidase can oxidize both types of lignin com￾pounds [73]. Nevertheless, despite the fact it is a green and eco-friendly process, this 
fermentation approach has certain drawbacks as it has slower rate of conversion in 
comparison to physical and chemical pretreatment methods and is costly (i.e. depen￾dency on enzymes).
6.4 PALM FIBRE-REINFORCED POLYESTER 
COMPOSITE PROPERTIES
6.4.1 Mechanical Properties
Utilization of palm fibre as reinforcement materials in polyester composites generally 
imparted better mechanical properties. As reported by Hussein [75], a 20 vol.% date 
palm fibre reinforcement increased the ultimate compression strength and flexural 
strength of unsaturated polyester by 24% (from 72 to 89MPa) and 49% (from 40.5 to 
60MPa), respectively. The presence of date palm fibre was reported to prevent the cracks 
propagation and rapid failure of the polyester, through the formation of good bonding 
between the matrix and the filler. The date fibres also restricted the chain mobility 
of the unsaturated polyester and hence remarkably improved its Young’s modulus 
by 77% (from 540 to 955MPa). The enhancement of flexural strength and 
modulus by date palm fibre inclusion was also reported in another study [76].
Similarly, a study by Norizan et al. [77] revealed remarkable increment of the 
tensile modulus and flexural strength by 13% and 98% when incorporated with 
palm fibre despite the decrement in the tensile strength. A similar finding on ten￾sile strength decrement was reported earlier by de Farias et al. [78]. The randomly 
oriented 10wt.% palm peach fibre in unsaturated polyester imparted reduction to 
the composite tensile strength by more than half of those by neat polymer. The ten￾sile strength was better for sample with weaved oriented fibre, where the value was 
similar to the neat. Reports on the palm fibre polyester tensile strength were, how￾ever, varied in trend. In an earlier report by Wazzan [79], ultimate tensile strength, 
elongation at break, and Young’s modulus of date palm polyester composites were 
all higher than those of the neat polyester regardless of the fibre volume fraction and 
structure (unidirectional and woven). The incorporation of oil palm fibre also suc￾cessfully increased the tensile strength for neat polyester from 25 to 35MPa [80]. 
Additionally, Raghavendra and Lokesh [81] who investigated the effect of different 
fibre origin revealed that almost all polyester containing 50 vol.% date palm fibre 
showed higher tensile strength (8%–24%), flexural strength (64%–92%), and impact 
strength (63%–83%).
The impact strength of polyester composites generally were lower than the neat 
itself, and reduced with increase in fibre content [75,79,82]. However, de Farias et al. 
[78] reported an exception to this trend. They found that incorporating 10% peach 
palm fibres into an unsaturated polyester matrix, with fibres oriented in different 
directions, led to higher impact strength values ranging from approximately 0.54 
to 0.85 J/m, compared to the neat matrix value of approximately 0.33 J/m. Higher 
Young’s modulus through palm peach fibre reinforcement was also reported in a 
study, suggesting that the fibre provides toughness to the polymer matrix.A Review on Palm Fibre-Reinforced Polyester Composites 111
6.4.2 Thermal Properties
Improvement in thermal conductivity behaviour of unsaturated polyester through 
reinforcement of date palm fibre from 0.4 to 0.8 W/m.C° and reduction in dielectric 
strength from 33.7 to 32.6 KV/mm were also reported [75]. Meanwhile, Norizan et al. 
[83] who studied the effect of palm sugar fibre on the thermal stability of unsaturated 
polyester/glass hybrid composite reported that the presence of fibre which are less 
thermally stable caused decrement in the thermal stability in terms of degradation 
onset and the maximum thermal decomposition. Alteration of sugar palm and glass 
fraction in the unsaturated polyester hybrid composites also influence the thermal 
stability; for example, composites with 50wt.% sugar palm/50wt.% glass exhibited 
much higher thermal stability than those with 70wt.% sugar palm/30wt.% glass.
6.4.3 Wettability Properties
Palm fibre as natural fibre is generally hydrophilic and hence often imparts changes 
in the physical properties of polymer composites by means of wettability or water 
absorption and swelling behaviour. A study [84] showed relatively four times higher 
water absorption and five times higher thickness swelling percentage of composites 
with SPF as compared to the neat matrix which was the vinyl ester. This was in 
agreement with earlier studies whereby palm peach fibre in unsaturated polyes￾ter led to increasing weight gain due to water absorption as compared to the neat 
matrix [78].
6.5 FACTORS AFFECTING THE PROPERTIES 
OF PALM FIBRE-REINFORCED POLYESTER
The palm fibre volume fraction in composites mixture plays an important role espe￾cially in their mechanical properties. Increasing the date fibre content in polyester 
up to 60% led to continuous increment of ultimate tensile strength, elongation at 
break, and Young’s modulus, whereas the impact strength showed vice versa [79]. 
In other report, the Young’s modulus, compression and flexural strength of unsatu￾rated polyester steadily increased with increasing date palm fibre up to 20% volume 
fraction before prominent decrement through addition of 30% volume fraction [75]. 
Similar trends were observed in the study by Norizan et al. [77], where inclusion of 
SPF up to 30wt.% increased the tensile modulus of unsaturated polyester from 3.54 
to 4.43GPa. However, with further increases in fibre content, the tensile modulus 
gradually decreased to 4.01 and 3.90GPa at 40 and 50wt.%, respectively. The oil 
palm fibre polyester composites prepared by authors of Refs. [85,86] showed increas￾ing trend; for example, increasing fibre content up to 45wt.% steadily increased the 
tensile strength.
Apart from fibre content, the orientation also implied a great influence on the 
mechanical properties. Fibre aligned to the direction of force evidently contributed 
to better stress transfer, which was translated through highest tensile strength, elon￾gation at break, tensile modulus, impact and compressive strength for 0° orienta￾tion, followed by 45° and 90° as the lowest [77]. This was in agreement with earlier 112 Polyester-Based Biocomposites
report, which showed higher mechanical properties by unidirectional fibre alignment 
as compared to the woven pattern [79].
The tensile strength of composite also relies on the interfacial interaction between 
the matrix and filler. Therefore, surface modification or functionalization using cou￾pling agents was often opted to enhance the compatibility, and eventually the tensile 
strength of composites. For example, the use of silane agents such as chloropropyl￾triethoxysilane (CPTS) and tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) imparts Si and Cl ele￾ments to the materials and hence improve the interfacial interaction between the 
filler and the matrix. Findings by Azmami et al. [87] proved the efficiency of these 
two silane agents in improving the interactions between the palm fibre and the poly￾ester as evident through prominent increment of tensile strength by almost two-folds 
(from 157N to approximately 300N) for both CPTS- and TEOS-treated samples. 
Additionally, these treated palm fibre/polyester composites exhibited lower water 
absorption capacity by almost half of that untreated sample due to their increased in 
hydrophobicity, besides higher thermal stability and flame retardancy.
Anggawan and Mohamad [86] conducted a study on alkali treatment to enhance 
the matrix–filler adhesion and improve the tensile strength of oil palm fibre/polyes￾ter composites. Their results showed that treating oil palm fibre with 2% NaOH for 
2 hours gave highest tensile strength, and further increase in NaOH concentration to 
10% caused lowest tensile strength. Earlier investigations by Hill and Abdul Khalil 
[85] revealed better compatibility of acetylated oil palm fibre translated through its 
highest tensile strength (4.8MPa), while the other two treatments silane and titanate 
gave 38.3 and 38.8MPa tensile strength, respectively. More hydrophobic properties 
of the cellulosic oil palm fibre provide stronger interfacial bond with the polyester, 
and hence better stress transfer upon applying load.
Several manufacturing methods can be used in preparing palm polyester compos￾ites by which the method used may influence the properties of the fabricated com￾posites. The methods include hand lay-up, resin transfer moulding, filament winding 
and compression moulding. Hand lay-up technique is a process in which fibre is 
impregnated with matrix by hand. The process could be done using roller or brushes 
and nip-roller type impregnator was usually used to press the materials before left to 
cure [88]. Despite the fact that it is a simple and widely used technique, hand lay-up 
is highly dependent on personal skills by which complete impregnation can be dif￾ficult to be ensured. A similar concept to hand lay-up technique is by spray layup, 
which can be more easily automated and suitable for large size pieces. The limita￾tion is, however, due to its incapability of loading high fibre volume fraction, and 
utilization of long fibres, as well and high viscosity resins can be unsuitable. In resin 
transfer moulding method, a single or multi-stack preforms are laid up and could be 
prepressed into mould by using binder. Resin will be injected into the cavity of the 
mould and left to cure. Similar to spray layup, this method depends on viscosity of 
the resin, and therefore is more suitable for less viscous resin like unsaturated poly￾ester, vinyl ester, and epoxy [89]. This method allows incorporation of high fibre vol￾ume with low void content. Nevertheless, despite its capability in producing excellent 
surface quality, a fibre wash in which fibre in the mould is moved due to the pressure 
(when resin was injected in) can happen and might influence the mechanical proper￾ties of the composites [88,90,91].A Review on Palm Fibre-Reinforced Polyester Composites 113
6.6 CHALLENGES AND FUTURE RECOMMENDATION
The length, diameter, thickness, mechanical properties (tensile, Young’s modulus, 
flexibility), chemical properties (stability, water permeability, reactivity), thermal 
conductivity, availability, cost-effectiveness, and cellulose content are all key aspects 
to consider when contemplating the use of palm fibre in a variety of applications. 
Essentially, palm fibres have some disadvantages over synthetic fibres, such as low 
thermal stability, sensitivity to the environment, poor interfacial adhesion, and low 
durability. Palm fibres will be a versatile material for reinforced composites in a 
variety of applications once all of these drawbacks are addressed. Oil palm fibres for 
example, are not suited for high-performance applications such as automotive and 
supercapacitor because of their low strength, sensitivity to environment, and poor 
moisture resistance, which causes reinforced composites to lose strength and stiff￾ness. As a result, combining oil palm fibres with other fibres (glass, jute, sisal) will 
improve their mechanical and thermal stability [22].
Palm fibres also offer a lot of potential as reinforcement in cement-insulating compos￾ites. Date palm fibre, for example, will improve the thermal degradation and flammabil￾ity of phenolic resins. Phenolic resins are a type of polymer that is highly cross-linked. 
The outer layer of phenolic resin transforms into a char layer during a fire, making 
it fire-resistant. The reinforced composites contained date palm fibres lower phenolic 
composites’ brittleness, thus improving their impact and thermal properties [92].
On the other hand, SPF has a unique set of properties that make it not only robust, 
but also resistant to seawater. It is easily available in woven fibres, making it simple 
to prepare. However, the use of SPF as a composite material is not yet completely 
investigated. Therefore, more research is needed to unveil its relevance and capa￾bilities. There are lot of advantages which could be offered by SPFs such as cost￾effectiveness, eco-friendly, and great mechanical properties. Employing the SPFs as 
composites not only increased the productivity but could also influence environmen￾tal as waste management can be efficiently practiced [24].
To date, low interfacial adhesion in palm fibre has been a major problem. Matrix 
plays a function in composites by transferring load via shear stresses at the matrix–
fibre contact. The bonding between the matrix and the fibre determines the load 
transfer capacity. If the interfacial adhesion is weak, it will have a negative impact on 
the composite’s mechanical properties. Finding an appropriate matrix for fibre-rein￾forced composites is one possible answer to this problem. Fibre modification, such 
as introducing a new functional group or treating it with alkali or acid, can also be a 
solution. The introduction of a functional group may improve the bonding between 
the matrix and the fibre [93].
Eventually, the potential of palm fibre as a nanomaterial is yet to be fully explored. 
The mechanical and chemical properties of nano-sized palm fibres have undoubt￾edly improved, resulting in a wider range of applications. Reinforcing composites in 
various thermoset and thermoplastic materials to make nanocomposites using nano￾sized palm fibre could have a great prospect. We also believe that expanding the 
usage of palm fibres by developing bio-composites and hybrid composites based on 
them is still a major issue. This technique could resolve the issue of palm fibre com￾patibility with other natural or synthetic fibres.114 Polyester-Based Biocomposites

7.1 INTRODUCTION
Coir fibers are obtained from the hair of the coconut fruit and therefore constitute 
a product from a multifaceted cropping system. The most added value products are 
obtained from the exploitation of coconuts as for flesh and milk, also marketed and 
prepared to serve as additives in food, e.g., for confectionery products. Furthermore, 
coconut (Cocos nucifera) palms offer other products such as coconut palm sheath 
leaves (Obi Reddy et al., 2010). Most recently, the use of coconut palm wood in 
buildings has been promoted as a strategy that would be beneficial for the sustain￾ability of the construction industry. However, there are a number of impediments to 
be removed in the process, starting from the cost of processing and low perception 
and image of this type of wood (Sodangi et al., 2020). It is important to notice that 
coir, according to the different maturation phases of the fruit, may be distinguished 
as white and brown coir, and the latter is typically more frequently used in compos￾ites (Figure 7.1), where it offers better performance in terms of mechanical and wear 
resistance (Valášek et al., 2018).
Dealing specifically with the coconut shell, coir fiber is not the only product it 
offers. Coir pith is produced from coconut shell, which is more powder-like than 
fiber, and has a number of uses. These include, for example, the possibility of appli￾cation as a peat substitute (Meerow 1994), which also highlighted some potential 
in terms of bioremediation from heavy metals (Namasivayam and Sangeetha 2006) 
and wastewater treatment (Kavitha and Namasivayam 2007), and the use as filler

in cementitious composites (Brasileiro et al., 2013). Also, coir pith offers a huge 
possibility to be compressed up to 8–10 times its initial volume and can be shaped 
into blocks, such as those represented in Figure 7.2. In this case the locking effect 
between pith particles is able to offer a solid material, capable of withstanding trans￾portation, only with the addition of a limited amount of thermosetting resin, such as 
unsaturated polyester, although of course a higher amount of resin would enhance its 
resistance (Panamgama and Peramune 2018).
On the other side, the nutshells present a value in themselves, specifically in their 
combustion or in the production of active carbons (Iqbaldin et al., 2013). However, it 
is important to note that, the complete exploitation of all products from the coconut 
system makes it desirable to use also the shell waste powder as the filler of thermo￾plastic matrices, such as polyethylene and polypropylene (Bradley and Conroy 2019). 
Coconut shells have also found some application in the construction industry, typi￾cally in road lower layers, in combination with compacted soil (Ting et al., 2015). 
Coir has also been proposed for structural upgradation and compared for perfor￾mance and ease of positioning and setting up with other well-known natural fibers, 
in particular bamboo, jute and sisal (Sen and Reddy 2011).
During the past decades, coir fiber has often been considered as a suitable rein￾forcement for composites. A large variety of matrices has been used for this purpose, 
starting from cementitious ones (Asasutjarit et al., 2007; Andiç-Çakir et al., 2014; Yan 
et al., 2016), also in hybrid combination e.g., with flax (Yan et al., 2015), to a consider￾able variety of polymer ones, an aspect which is also elucidated by Reddy et al. (2019).
In contrast with other traditional fibers, such as jute and sisal, sometimes coir 
proved to be inferior, especially when applied with matrices of interest for the 
automotive industry, such as polypropylene, yet was considered more reliable for 
FIGURE 7.1 Brown coir (a) and white coir (b), as received and prepared for experimenta￾tion. (Source: Valášek et al. 2018.)Coir Fiber–Polyester Composites 123
its reduced water absorption (Sudhakara et al., 2015). These fibers spawned some 
interest also for the production of composites, on which a review encompassing all 
the routes from the fiber to the production and characterization of composites was 
recently produced by Oladele et al. (2022).
The production of composites is principally carried out using some traditional 
thermosetting matrices, such as phenol-formaldehyde (Bharath et al., 2019), vinyl￾ester (Velumani et al., 2014), or epoxy (Biswas et al., 2011; Kumar et al., 2014), and 
unsaturated polyester, which is the specific focus of this work. With thermosetting 
matrices, the profile of application of coir fibers as their reinforcement has been often 
considered very high and perfectly comparable with most common fibers, such as 
glass and even carbon. In practice, also the application of coir–epoxy composites as 
ballistic armors has been attempted in the understanding that the complexity of their 
FIGURE 7.2 Coir pith blocks (a) top view and (b) side view. (Source: Panamgama and 
Peramune 2018.)124 Polyester-Based Biocomposites
damage absorption modes would much exceed the expectations that can be raised 
from their quite modest tensile strength (Luz et al., 2017). In the case of a com￾parative study between pineapple leaf fibers (PALF)–glass and coir–glass hybrids 
with epoxy matrix, the potential offered by coir was particularly concentrated on the 
improvement of impact properties, which were able to exceed 10 kJ/m2 for a 15% 
glass and 15% coir reinforcement (Mittal and Chaudhary 2018).
In view of the application for ballistic purposes, such as for helmet shells, the 
fabrication of carbon/coir–epoxy composites has been investigated (Singh et al., 
2020). On the other side, the creation of hybrid composites including carbon and 
natural fibers also obtained some success, so that a specific review has been dedi￾cated to these (Santulli 2019). More recently, also thermoplastic matrices, includ￾ing petrochemical ones, such as polypropylene (Islam et al. 2010; Sudakhara 
et al., 2013) and starch-derived ones, such as wheat gluten (Muensri et al., 2011), 
poly(lactic acid) (PLA) (Yusoff et al., 2016; Rigolin et al., 2019) have been intro￾duced in the production of coir fiber reinforced composites. Further studies on 
PLA were also carried out in comparison with other fibers, such as the previously 
mentioned PALF (Siakeng et al., 2018).
However, the reliability and easy application of polyester matrices for compos￾ites still make them preferable for a number of uses, which especially extend over 
the wider construction sector (Scheirs and Long 2005). Their ease of application 
and flexibility of use allowed for a facile laying of randomly discontinuous oriented 
coir fibers (Priya et al., 2014) and also the production of hybrid composites includ￾ing other fibers with coir. Over time, these included jute (Saw et al., 2012), oil palm 
(Zainudin et al., 2014) and glass, which in particular was studied considering inter￾mingling with coir (Pavithran et al., 1991). Most commonly, and in view of their 
machinability, a skin (glass)–core (coir) approach was selected: in this regard, the 
use of polyester matrix was demonstrated to be highly suitable for the application 
(Hamouda et al., 2017).
The chapter partially draws upon a number of reviews that exist on coir fiber 
composites, which of course are usually more general. Among the previously avail￾able reviews on coir fibers, some can be mentioned, in particular by Verma et al. 
(2013), Jayavani et al. (2016), Adeniyi et al. (2019), Bongarde et al. (2019) and 
Hasan et al. (2021).
Characterization of obtained composites from mechanical and thermal points 
of view also needs to be investigated. On the other side, to improve the resistance 
of coir fibers and hence the performance of composites, treatments may be neces￾sary, on which a specific review exists by Dugvekar and Dixit (2022). Treatment 
is not the only way to improve fiber–matrix compatibility: another method is the 
addition of compatibilizer, such has been the case for lignin in the case of poly￾propylene/coir composites (Morandim-Giannetti et al., 2012), as an alternative 
to the usual maleic anhydride and silanization/compatibilizations (Santos et al. 
2009). Further reviews concern other applications of coir fibers, which do not spe￾cifically concern the production of composites. This is the case, for example, of 
the review on soil stabilization applications of coir fibers by Maurya et al. (2015), 
on the improvement of sand properties, as reported by Sridhar (2017), and in road 
construction by Ting et al. (2015).Coir Fiber–Polyester Composites 125
7.2 CHARACTERISTICS OF COIR FIBERS
To start investigating the potential of coir fibers in polyester composites, a number of 
fiber characteristics are essential to be known, as they are extracted from fruit hair: 
these include chemical composition, thermal degradation properties and mechanical 
performance of the fibers. Some data are reported in Table 7.1 on untreated fibers, 
which are able to offer an idea of the scattering in properties observed.
The amount of lignin present in coir fibers is higher than what is obtained from 
fibers extracted from other parts of the coconut plant: for example, a study on leaf 
sheath fibers reported values of 27%, 40% and 26% for lignin, cellulose and hemicel￾lulose, respectively (Suresh Kumar et al., 2014). The relatively high amount of lignin 
in coir fibers, together with their comparatively high microfibrillar angle, does affect 
the tensile and flexural properties of the obtained composites. On the other hand, it 
has been suggested that they are particularly suitable for impact-resistant applica￾tions, especially by making use of thermosetting matrices, such as unsaturated poly￾esters (Wambua et al., 2003).
The elongation of coir fibers, as it is apparent from Table 7.2, may be very vari￾able, and actually strongly depends on the geometrical characteristics of fiber, in 
particular on their diameter and length. Some data are offered in Sindhu et al. (2007): 
in this study, increasing the length of fibers employed from 10 to 30mm long fibers, 
resulted in an enhancement of tensile strength from 15 to 24.2MPa, and in Young’s 
modulus growing from 831 to 952MPa. However, a further consequence was also a 
loss in elongation, which was that elongation was reduced from 9% to 5%.

In general terms, it can be suggested that the most repeatable and consistent data 
for coir originate from fiber diameter. This has been suggested also from compara￾tive studies, for example, with banana and bagasse fibers, where coir performed quite 
at the same level than the former and showed to be much superior to the latter (Jústiz￾Smith et al., 2008).
Early studies on thermal characterization of untreated coir fibers, after a period for 
moisture evaporation, which terminates at around 120°C, with a weight loss usually 
not exceeding 8%, indicated two main transition intervals peaking at 334°C and 
476°C for cellulose and lignin degradation, respectively (Silva et al., 2000). The ther￾mal stability of cellulose can be affected even at higher temperatures, such as 357°C, 
although the transition interval may be very wide, such as from 223°C to 395°C, as 
reported by Dos Santos et al., 2018.
7.3 COIR FIBER–POLYESTER COMPOSITES
7.3.1 General Considerations
Apart from the use of coconut shell powder, which showed some promise as the 
filler of polyester matrices (Islam et al., 2017) and has been recently repurposed for 
this aim in the form of micro- or nanofiller (Karthik Babu et al. 2020), coir fibers 
have been used for fabrication of composites using polyester matrices from the very 
early experiments, according to Prasad et al. (1983). In particular, it was suggested 
even from the 1980s that this fiber–matrix combination would be suitable for a num￾ber of applications, such as covers for voltage stabilizers or projectors, mirror casing 
and roofing (Satyanarayana et al., 1986). More recent experiments also suggested 
some potential for coir–polyester composites as material for liquid storage tanks, 
with some possible concerns to be attributed to fiber strength deteriorating during 
the aging process (Yousif and Ku 2012).
First evidence was that the interface between the hydrophobic polyester matrix 
and the relatively hydrophilic coir fibers was unsatisfactory. These initial studies 
revealed that treatment with a 5% sodium hydroxide solution almost doubled the 
debonding stress of coir fibers so that a volume fraction equal to 0.3 was successfully 
introduced. Other types of alkaline treatments, such as with sodium bicarbonate, 
do not affect the mechanical strength of the fibers: also, coir/polyester composites, 
though inferior to coir/epoxy ones in terms of tensile or flexural strength, outper￾form these as far as stiffness is concerned (Dos Santos et al., 2019).
Over time, composite fabrication with higher tenors of fibers has been progres￾sively experimented, to try to lead to substantial advantages in terms of mechanical 
performance. An important study was carried out by Monteiro et al. (2008), where 
comparison between two different modes for the introduction of coir fibers in a poly￾ester matrix, namely, as either pressed mat or tangled mass, allowed pushing the 
tenor of reinforcement up to 80wt.%. With growing amounts of fibers, the strength, 
especially the flexural one, of the composite decreases: however, this can be justified 
by obtaining two different types of products, rigid composites with less than 50wt.% 
of fibers, and agglomerates with more than this.Coir Fiber–Polyester Composites 127
7.3.2 Effect of Fiber Treatments
Apart from the typical alkali treatment for ligno-cellulosic fibers with sodium 
hydroxide, other possible surface modifications have been attempted. Rout et al. 
(2001) and (2003) compared a few of these in their investigation of tensile, flexural 
and impact performance of coir–polyester composites. In particular, alkali treatment 
with concentrations of 2 to 10%, bleaching defatted fibers with sodium chlorite, then 
neutralized at pH 7, were applied. In comparison, cyanoethylation and vinyl grafting 
applied on 5% alkali-treated fibers were experimented, therefore limiting possible 
damage produced by excessively concentrated solutions onto the fiber surface. The 
results indicated that every surface modification is able to improve the mechanical 
properties of 17wt.% coir–polyester composites. Silane treatment did generally con￾siderably and consistently improve tensile strength and modulus of coir–polyester 
with respect to the application of untreated fibers, up to 70wt.% of reinforcement 
added (Anyakora 2013). However, in general terms, tensile strength decreases with 
the addition of a higher amount of coir fibers while the opposite occurs for stiffness.
Other types of treatment have also been experimented, such as acetylation at 
high temperature (Khalil et al., 2000). This treatment was performed in the under￾standing that the improvement of temperature would result in a possible removal of 
loose matter, apart from moisture, with the consequence of enhancing the mechani￾cal properties of coir–polyester composites. This proved true up to 100°C, while the 
results of treatment with a further increased temperature were contrasting.
7.3.3 Production of Hybrid Composites
Coir–cotton hybrid polyester with fiber content of up to 20wt.% were studied: the 
introduction of coir compares unfavorably against that of cotton in tensile, flexural 
and Charpy impact testing with frequent occurrences of pullout of coir fibers (Balaji 
and Senthil Vadivu 2017). The introduction of coir in hybrids with other fibers with 
superior tensile performance, namely, PALF and bamboo, however, proved to be 
successful to compensate with positive interlocking effect between the three fibers 
(Rihayat et al., 2018). More complex hybrids were also proposed more recently, 
where in an unsaturated polyester matrix, sisal (50%–90%), sorghum (5%–25%) and 
coir (5%–25%) were introduced (Kumar 2020). An attempt also of self-reinforced 
hybrid composites was developed including poly(ethylene terephtalate) (PET) fibers 
from textile waste, adding to this olive root waste and coir pith microparticles, as 
reported in Figure 7.3 (Tufail et al., 2021).
Another possible trend was the addition of particulate ceramics, such as eggshell 
powder (ESP) and rice husk (around 70% in silica), in large amounts into a poly￾ester–coir composite with fibers having different lengths, from 10 to 50mm. The 
amount of polyester was kept constant at 60wt.%, while coir fibers and particulate 
reinforcements were balanced in a compromised manner, with a maximum of par￾ticulate equal to 25% and subsequently with a minimum amount of coir equal to 15% 
(Bharathiraja et al., 2016). An optimization study was carried out in a similar occur￾rence of addition of coir and particulates, in this case rice husk and red mud from 
aluminum production, with the aim of identifying the optimal fabrication conditions 128 Polyester-Based Biocomposites
about the amount of bioparticles+coir (total 40%) and coir fiber length (between 26 
and 29mm) (Bharathiraja et al., 2017).
The impregnation of short coir fibers in polyester matrix using calcium carbonate 
was also studied by full factorial design (Sathiyamurthy et al., 2012). This method 
was also followed in a complete study by Rajamuneeswaran et al. (2016), where cal￾cium carbonate filler was extracted from crab carapace: in this case, polyester matrix 
was found to offer properties inferior to vinylester and epoxy to the composite. In 
particular, with 25% of fibers, 50mm long and with 0.25mm diameter and filler con￾tent of 2%, a tensile strength equal to 17.8MPa, a flexural strength equal to 22.8MPa 
and impact strength equal to 38.4 kJ/m² were obtained.
A complex hybrid with jute was also realized recently including two types of 
ceramic fillers, ESP and montmorillonite nanoclay (MMT-NC) under dry and wet 
(freshwater and seawater) conditions. This was performed with the idea to lead to its 
optimization with respect to the contents of the fillers and the different mechanical 
properties, i.e., tensile, flexural and impact strength, examined (Ganesan et al., 2021). 
The results indicated that the addition of equal amounts of 1.5wt.% of MMT-NC and 
ESP offered, as a whole, optimum properties.
Coir–unsaturated polyester composites (50/50) demonstrated to be also suitable for 
mixing with other types of waste materials, such as bio-particulate, for example, red 
mud from aluminum production and termite mound soil. The best mechanical (tensile, 
flexural and impact) performance was obtained with 30mm long fibers and 20% bio￾particulate (10 red mud+10 termite mound) (Bharathiraja et al., 2014). Another study 
concerned the filling of coir–polyester laminates using alumina evaluating the com￾bined effect of fiber length and diameter and filler content (Sathiyamurthy et al., 2013).
7.3.4 Mechanical Characterization
A recent review is available on mechanical properties of coir-reinforced compos￾ites, which offered some data also on coir–polyester composites, namely, on ten￾sile and flexural strength, Young’s modulus and elongation (Guyat et al., 2021). 
FIGURE 7.3 Images (a) of SEM micrograph and (b) of PET fibers, olive root waste and coir 
pith fibers. (Source: Tufail et al. 2021.)Coir Fiber–Polyester Composites 129
A significant characteristic of coir fiber has also been revealed in a drilling study 
against glass fiber when inserted into polyester matrix, and they indicated a lower 
proneness to delamination than the latter (Balaji et al., 2014). The general issue of 
machinability of coir/polyester composites has also been modeled, since it depends 
on a number of different variables during the drilling process, such as thrust force, 
torque and tool wear. The effect of these can be globally treated into a design 
of experiments (DOE) procedure (Jayabal et al., 2010, 2011a,b). In terms of wear 
properties, it was noticed that coir fibers did break in the polyester matrix before 
pulling out, therefore confirming the remarkable level of adhesion, as reported 
by Herrera-Franco and Valadez-Gonzalez (2004). However, the fabrication of two 
types of coir–polyester composites with three and four layers, respectively, resulted 
in a limited but not fully consistent reduction of friction, hence with a large varia￾tion among different samples, resulting in a higher specific wear rate (Yousif 
et al., 2009). This was attributed to the presence of micro-plowing in the resin-rich 
regions, which is a typical occurrence in coir fiber–reinforced composites, possibly 
for the irregular surface profile of these fibers (Siva et al., 2012). Another tribologi￾cal study compared E-glass, coir and their hybrid polyester composites, all with 48 
(±1) wt. % total reinforcement content.
Impact strength can be considered to be the most consistently behaving mechani￾cal data: in particular, the increase in volume fraction of fibers (10%–30%) and of 
laminate thickness (from 2 to 6mm) proved advantageous, allowing Charpy impact 
strength to grow with a rather predictable trend. To have an idea of the possible 
improvement obtainable, it can be noticed that a 10 vol% 2mm thick laminate offered 
an impact strength of around 0.2 J/m, while a 30 vol% 6mm thick laminate yielded 
an impact strength approximating 1.6 J/m (Prasad et al., 2017). A comparative study 
between impact strengths of different polyester matrix composites, reinforced, 
respectively, with E-glass, coir or oil palm fibers, and two hybrids, including E-glass/
coir and E-glass/oil palm, and the addition of sand filler, was carried out by Wong 
et al. (2010). In this context, different fiber volume fractions (40, 50 and 60%) and 
fiber lengths (3, 7, 10mm) were employed to study coir composites with fibers dis￾posed either longitudinally or transversely to load application, with up to four layers 
and different spacing among them. A larger number of layers enhance the impact 
strength, but this is depressed by higher amounts of fibers. In an attempt to use longer 
coir fibers, yet untreated, of up to 35mm and aligned on the longitudinal direction 
of tensile samples, it was noticed that the effect on the strength of the resin was only 
positive for 10wt.% fiber content. On the other side, stiffness was improved up to 
40wt.% fiber (Júnior et al., 2010).
A study topic that is not very usual among natural fibers is the attempt to predict 
mechanical properties, using artificial neural network (ANN) methods: in the case 
of a study on coir/polyester composites, the idea was to elucidate for which amount 
of coir fibers, the peak of flexural strength was reached for laminates with different 
thicknesses. The result obtained was for 21wt.% and 5mm, with a flexural strength 
of 144.82MPa, while the experimental testing, carried out at every 5% of further 
fiber addition, indicated at 20% fibers, 142.04MPa. The idea, which was successful, 
was that ANN was able to predict the trend of the flexural strength vs. fiber weight 
behavior with higher accuracy than what is realizable with experimental testing 
(Prasad et al., 2016).130 Polyester-Based Biocomposites
A preliminary fatigue evaluation has been carried out on 10wt.% coir–polyester 
composites to try to elucidate possible S-N curves at 6Hz frequency and load ratio R 
equal to 0.1, which indicated a more than halving of ultimate stress between 103 and 
105 cycles (Mulinari et al., 2011).
7.3.5 Thermal Characterization
The treatment of coir fibers has been indicated to improve the thermal stability of the 
fibers, to a very different extent, depending on the type of chemical used. In particu￾lar, it was highlighted that the most successful one is still mercerization, while less 
effective are oxidation by hydrogen peroxide and then acetylated coir, although all of 
them provide some positive effect (Akintayo et al., 2016).
A thermogravimetric study on coir–polyester composites was performed by Santafé 
et al. (2011) and subsequently reported and compared in Monteiro et al. (2012). In 
particular, for a 30% coir–polyester composite, two peaks were observed at 285°C and 
348°C, attributed to hemicellulose and cellulose degradation, respectively. Comparative 
study carried out by the same authors on neat polyester suggested that its decomposi￾tion occurred at higher temperatures, such as at 385°C, with a tail as high as 414°C.
Balaji et al. (2020) observed that the addition of coir fibers (15%) to zea fibers 
(25%) in a polyester matrix offered some increase of the crystalline temperature, 
precisely from 92°C to 98°C, while zea fibers already gave rise to a considerable shift 
from 64°C to 92°C.
7.4 CONCLUSIONS
Coir–polyester composites are a very diffuse matrix–fiber combination for coconut 
fruit fibers, second possibly only to epoxy. It allowed in recent years the fabrication 
of composites with up to 70% of coir fibers, normally treated to obtain an increase of 
crystallinity and some improvement of thermal stability, other than the removal 
of looser material, hence a higher hardness and stiffness. It needs to be considered 
that in mechanical terms this is convenient for obtaining a higher stiffness and a bet￾ter impact strength, for a consistent interlocking effect, less so in the case of tensile 
and flexural strength. However, the fabrication of hybrid composites, both with other 
natural fibers, such as jute, PALF, sisal, etc., and/or with other lignocellulosic mate￾rial and ceramic waste, especially silica or calcium carbonate-based material, also 
proved to be successful. This suggests the flexibility of unsaturated polyester matrix 
to obtain a sufficient compatibility and interface with coir fibers, also for the experi￾ence accumulated over a few decades of experimentation on the manufacturing and 
characterization of coir–polyester composites.

8.1 INTRODUCTION
The rise in ecological awareness has led to the use of natural resources as techno￾logical materials for different applications, and government modern ecological rules 
and regulations have tasked various engineering industries to find new materials 
[1]. Presently, synthetic fiber-reinforced composites are extensively used in differ￾ent engineering applications. However, the difficulties in the handling of synthetic 
fibers such as their non-degradability and skin irritations have been overemphasized 
[2]. Composites are materials which consist of two or more suitably ordered or dis￾tributed physically distinct phases. The matrix is referred to as the continuous phase 
while the fillers or reinforcements are the distributed phase [3].
Over the past couple of decades, considerable interest has been channeled toward 
natural fibers as suitable substitute for man-made (synthetic) fiber reinforcements in 
polymer composites [4–6]. These interests are driven by low cost, low density, simple 
handling, relatively good mechanical properties, renewability, and eco-friendliness 
of the natural fiber-reinforced composites [7,8].
Wood is one of the commonly used natural fibers in engineering applications, 
because of their low cost, low weight, and better recyclability [9,10]. It is also the 
most preferred material for structural applications; this is because of its inexpensive, 
aesthetically attractive quality, and good physical strength. Wood fiber polymer com￾posites are produced either by incorporating wood fiber as an inclusion in polymer 
matrix, and molding or pressing under high pressure and temperature [3]. In various 
industries such as transportation, aerospace, biomedical equipment, automobiles, 
and mining industries, conventional materials are being widely replaced by fiber￾reinforced composites [4,11–13].
Furthermore, the eco-friendliness of waste products from wood industry is one of 
the positive effects of using them in polymer composites. However, its major drawback 
is the degradation of the physical and mechanical properties due to environmental 
variation that leads to bond failure [14]. Another disadvantage is their hygroscopicity, 
which makes it difficult to achieve a good level of dispersion in the polymer matrix. 
Hygroscopicity can be minimized, however, by esterifying the wood components. 
Chemically modifying wood enhances its mechanical characteristics, as well as its 
stability while reducing water absorption [15,16]. The degradation of wood plastic 
composites is a function of proportion of wood dust in the composite. A faster degrad￾ability in both water and the earth was ensured with higher wood proportion [17].
Unsaturated polyester (UP) is the most popular in preparing composites and 
accounts for 80% excess of all thermoset resins, and the global UP market has been 
forecast to grow at a steady rate of 5.3% compound annual growth rate between 2019 
and 2029 [18,19]. Finally, to address the increasing demand for the use of wood￾based polyester composite, an up-to-date review is required to better understand 
their properties.
8.2 WOOD FIBER
Wood is a lignocellulosic material composed mostly of lignin, hemicellulose, and 
cellulose, with extractives and ash as minute constituents [20]. In woods, there are Wood Fiber-Reinforced Polyester Composite 139
several kinds of specialty cells; the wood cells are elongated, pointed at the end, 
and oriented along the stem axis. Latewood and earlywood have different cell sizes. 
When compared to the latewood, which is generated later in the growth season and 
has darker rings, the earlywood is softer, weaker, and lighter in weight. [21].
Wood fiber is a finely ground wood that can be made from a variety of sources, 
including chips, wood planar shaving, saw dust, and other neat wood waste from 
wood processing industries. Particle size distribution, moisture, and density are all 
observed during processing to ensure constant physical and chemical properties [22]. 
Wood flour (WF) and long wood fibers are two types of wood fiber. However, long 
wood fibers are more difficult to handle than WF. Long wood fibers tend to clump 
together, causing dispersion problems. However, longer wood fibers tend to provide 
greater reinforcing effects in composites due to their high aspect ratio [22].
The properties of wood are determined by the tree from which it was extracted, 
while the source of the wood determines its density. Ever since the evolution of 
man, wood has contributed enormously in human civilization and to the socioeco￾nomic lives of the global human population. Due to the over-exploitation of wood 
throughout history, as a result of large-scale multiple applications, there have been a 
depletion of forest and this poses a danger to the survival of the ecological system. 
However, wood polymer composites (WPCs) can proffer solution to this problem. To 
accomplish this, wood fibers or WF derived from wood waste are utilized to create 
WPCs with strength and other qualities comparable to, if not superior to, wood.
Woods are classified into two classes: hard woods and soft woods. Gymnosperms 
(primarily conifers) produce soft woods, while hard woods come from angiosperms 
(deciduous trees). The woods also differ in terms of their constituents’ cells. The 
structure of hardwood is contained of fibrous elements, axial parenchyma cells, and 
vessel elements with more complex structure [24]. Figure 8.1 depicts the morphology 
of softwood and hardwood. Cell walls are layered structures that are stacked con￾centrically and have different chemical compositions and orientations (Figure 8.2). 
The middle lamella is a cellulose-free lamella that binds the separate cells together. 
The primary wall (P) is distinguished from secondary walls (S) by the transitional 
arrangement of the cellulose fibrils in the wall (S1, S2, S3) [25]. The cellulose fibrils 
in the primary wall are oriented in a modest slope perpendicular to the fiber direc￾tion, whereas the fibrils are unevenly arranged with the fiber orientation in the sec￾ondary wall (S2) while non-structural substances are present in high concentration 
in secondary wall 3 (S3) layer [26]. There is more cellulose in the secondary walls 1 
and 2 (S1 and S2) than in the secondary wall and primary wall 3. Lumen is the cell 
wall-bound cavity, and the difference in wall thickness between latewood and early￾wood is due to differences in S2 thickness; therefore, the bulk cellulose is found [21].
8.3 CHEMICAL TREATMENT OF WOOD FIBERS
The utilization of natural fibers as an inclusion in polyester matrix, to give polyester 
composite is often limited by the incompatibility nature of the cellulose fibers with 
the polymer interface [27]. Each of the repeating units of cellulose has three hydroxyl 
groups which bond with each other to form inter-cohesive hydrogen bond [28]. 
The hydrogen bond results in high flexural strength between the repeating units, 140 Polyester-Based Biocomposites
FIGURE 8.2 Diagram of the transversal structure of the tracheid cell wall in black spruce 
wood [25].
FIGURE 8.1 SEM image of (a) hardwood (Eucalytus globulus) and (b) softwood (Cupressus 
macrocarpa) [23].Wood Fiber-Reinforced Polyester Composite 141
with solvent affinity attributes on the surface of the fiber [27]. A method is required 
to enhance the homogeneity between wood fibers and polyester matrix to enhance 
composite materials’ physical properties. Materials with coupling ability have been 
employed to establish a chemical bond at the interface between fiber and polymer to 
improve the fiber polymer interfacial bonding. The hydroxyl group on the fiber sur￾face reacts with the bonding sites of the coupling agent. Depending on the type of the 
polyester, the other end is coupled to the polyester matrix’s functional group through 
various bonding such as hydrogen bond, covalent bonding, acid–base interaction, 
and also through chain entanglement [29].
Natural fibers are treated to improve their water resistance, increase the wettabil￾ity of their surfaces with polymers (mostly non-polar polymers), and boost interfacial 
adhesion [30]. Fiber chemical treatments which include peroxide treatment, alkali 
treatment, acrylation, benzoyl treatment, silane treatment, and isocyanate treatment 
have been reported to enhance fiber strength and fiber–matrix bonding in wood fiber 
composites to varying degrees, and are thus used for final composite applications 
[27,31,32]. Thus, the chemical treatments are utilized to prepare the wood fiber prior 
to its usage as a filler in polyester matrix, which will result in the formation of wood 
fiber composite with enhanced properties. The effect of chemical treatment on both 
the pristine wood fiber and the resulted wood fiber composite is evident on the sur￾face morphology of the treated wood fiber and wood fiber composites, which assumes 
a soft and curly nature as a result of mechanical entanglement which will enhance 
fiber adhesion when used as a filler [31]. More so, chemical treatment of wood fibers￾filled polymer matrix results in a decline in the voids and irregular matrix cracking, 
showing outstanding laminar linkages between the polymer matrix and the WF [31].
8.3.1 Polyester
Polyesters are classified into different classes based on the bonding affinity of 
monomer (e.g., aromatic or aliphatic). This division yields two classes: UPs and 
saturated polyesters. Poly(L-lactic acid), poly(caprolactone), poly(glycolic acid), 
and their copolymers are examples of saturated polyesters. Because of their bio￾degradability and biocompatibility, polyesters have various applications in their 
biocomposites form [33].
Polyester resins are one of the most common man-made resin categories, which 
are widely utilized in plastic reinforcement, as well as powder coatings, water-based 
paints, lacquers, glues, and automotive cements [34]. Polyesters are polymeric large 
molecules composed of monomers joined by ester linkages. Ester linkages/bonds are 
covalent chemical bonds formed of both a –COOH carboxylic acid group and a –OH 
alcohol group [35]. Polyesters are among the most valuable polymer categories in use 
currently. Polyesters are created in their most basic form by the polycondensation 
reaction of a glycol with a di-functional carboxylic acid [36].
The most commonly used thermosetting resins are polyesters. Because of their 
low strength and brittleness, polyesters could not be used for technology-specific 
purpose without reinforcement, but they are widely used in composite matrices. UPs 
have high polydispersity value and low molecular weight. Because of the unsatura￾tion in their chain, UPs can be utilized in cure chemical interactions through radical 142 Polyester-Based Biocomposites
polymerization reactions in the presence of a reactive monomer, say unsaturated sty￾rene, resulting in unsaturated polyester resins (UPRs) which belong to the class of 
thermosetting polyesters [33].
8.3.1.1 Unsaturated Polyester Resin
UP resin, also known as polyester resin, is a viable and widely known resin, as well 
as a multifunctional synthetic copolymer used in composites production. They are 
a type of high-performance engineering polymer that can be found in a variety of 
applications [37]. UP resins are linear polycondensation products derived from sat￾urated and unsaturated anhydrides/acids as well as oxides or diols. UP resins are 
typically with a low degree of polymerization, resulting in pale yellow oligomers. 
These oligomers can be splintery solids or sticky liquids depending on their molecu￾lar weight (1200–3000 g/mol) and chemical composition. They were mostly used in 
compression molding, injection molding, filament winding, resin transfer molding, 
and hand lay-up. Polyesters are found to be used in the manufacture of 85% of fiber￾filled polymeric products, which include car and aircraft components, boats body 
parts and chairs [38].
The curing effect of UPR is commonly initiated by the co-polymerization of the 
ester functional group on its main chain with styrene monomer. The unsaturated 
effect of the main chain provides sites for peroxide initiators to react with double 
bonds in styrene monomer, resulting in the formation of a 3D network [39]. UP can 
form very strong bonds with other materials and have high toughness and crack resis￾tance [37]. This type of polyester’s unsaturation offers a site for successive crosslink￾ing. These resins are mixed with various reinforcements and inclusions, and cured 
with radical initiators to produce thermosetting entities with a variety of mechani￾cal and chemical properties depending on the diols, initiators, crosslinking agents, 
diacids, and other inclusions used. The diversity of the resulted thermoset product’s 
properties has sparked interest in these polyester resins as an essential engineering 
material for a broad array of material applications [40].
The most important low cost and commonly used monomers for introducing 
unsaturation in the polyester chain are fumaric acid and maleic anhydride. The UP 
characteristics are easily modified by introducing varying concentrations of diacids 
and diols, as well as altering the constituent’s ratio [33,40,41]. The characteristics 
of UPs are determined not only by the degree of the cure reaction, but also by their 
molecular composition. Hence, it is critical to comprehend the reaction’s thermody￾namics that occur during curing and their inferences in the process [41].
The conversion of UPs into an engineering material necessitates the inclusion of 
another material, the unsaturated monomer (UM), also known as diluent and typically 
added in wt.% ranging from 30% to 40%. The general procedure for obtaining UPRs 
is classified into two major stages: UP synthesis and curing reaction (Figure 8.3).
The UM is incorporated into the UP for two reasons: (1) to increase the fluidity 
of the system (which aids resin preparation) and (2) to develop an effective double 
bond, which initiates a crosslink network in the UP main chain. Styrene is the most 
common UM used, but other UMs such as alkyl methacrylate vinyl esters, dimeth￾acrylates, and divinylbenzene can also be utilized. Also, due to the radical kinetics 
of the curing process, an initiator of radical nature must be added to the formulation. Wood Fiber-Reinforced Polyester Composite 143
Organic peroxides, such as alkyl hydro peroxides, ketone peroxides, dialkyl, or dia￾cyl peroxides, are the most commonly used initiators [33,40,42].
A further critical additive for the compounding is the accelerator, which is a 
chemical component capable of lowering the activation energy and, thereby, low￾ering the temperature and enthalpy required for network formation (crosslinking). 
FIGURE 8.3 Path for development of UPRs: (a) polycondensation reaction and (b) cure 
reaction [33].144 Polyester-Based Biocomposites
The most commonly used accelerators are tertiary amines (e.g., N,N-diethylaniline, 
N,N-dimethylaniline, or N,N-dimethyl-p toluidine) and cobalt salts. Inhibitors such 
as hydroquinone and t-butyl hydroquinone are also utilized to prevent unnecessary 
radical polymerization due to high temperatures, handling, addition of UM, and stor￾age. However, adjustment of the amount of inhibitor is necessary to prevent the slow￾ing of the growing crosslinking network. Once the UPR formulation is heated or 
irradiated, the crosslinking reaction begins with the emergence of free radicals from 
initiators. The foremost radicals created are fully consumed by the trapped inhibitor 
in the formulation. Radical crosslinking reactions occur at this instance, forming an 
elongated molecular chain by the stepwise end-to-end connectivity of vinyl mono￾mers, and by intramolecular and intermolecular reactions (Figure 8.4).
Aside from the benefits, UPRs have some drawbacks, such as low impact strength, 
high flammability, and poor toughness. The need for polyester matrix to be rein￾forced cannot be overemphasized. The high shrinkage of the polyester resin during 
curing is the major challenge encountered during its synthesis. This is as a result of 
the over chain entanglement which restricts the chain growth and movement, and as 
such, could be remedied by the use of processing oil during compounding [33,39].
8.3.1.2 Saturated Polyester
Thermoplastic polyesters (TPPs), known also as saturated polyesters or linear poly￾esters, are formed by condensation polymerization, resulting in ester (–COO–) func￾tional groups along their backbones. Nevertheless, the ester linkage established in 
TPP’ molecules is often found in small parts. Linear polyesters are categorized into 
three types, namely aromatic, partly aromatic, and aliphatic. Aliphatic polyesters 
FIGURE 8.4 Schematic representation of the possible reactions in the UM-UP cure reac￾tion: (I) intermolecular crosslinking UP-UM-UP*; (II) intermolecular crosslinking UP-UP*; 
(III) intramolecular crosslinking UP-UM-UP (or UP*-UM-UP*); (IV) intramolecular cross￾linking UP-UP (or UP*-UP*); (V) branching growth UP-UM (or UP*-UM); (VI) UM homo￾polymerization [33].Wood Fiber-Reinforced Polyester Composite 145
are created by combining aliphatic diols with dicarboxylic acids (or esters). Linear 
aliphatic polyesters have lower melting points, and are susceptible to hydrolysis due 
to the high mobility nature of the C–O interaction that exists in their main chain. 
Aliphatic diols and aromatic dicarboxylic acids (or esters) are used to make partially 
aromatic polyesters [43] (Figure 8.5).
Also, polyesters, however, exist in liquid crystalline forms, with most ester linkages 
anchored to aromatic rings. The most common TPP among others is poly(ethylene 
terephthalate) (PET). PET is a clear polymer with good mechanical properties and 
dimensional stability under varying loads. Furthermore, PET has good gas barrier 
properties as well as chemical resistance, and also has good mechanical properties 
when reinforced with both synthetic and bio-fillers. Among so many bio-fillers for 
the reinforcement of polyesters, wood fiber presents an excellent choice for the prepa￾ration of polyester composites, due to its soft, curl nature, and improved mechanical 
properties when chemically treated.
8.4 METHOD OF PREPARATION OF WOOD FIBER￾REINFORCED POLYESTER COMPOSITES
Among the various methods for the production of composites, the hand lay-up tech￾nique is the basic approach of composite fabrication. It is the most commonly used 
method in the wood fiber-reinforced polyester composite fabrication [3,44,45]. Cast 
mold was employed in the hand lay-up fabrication of composites for the study of the 
effect of water on the behaviors of saw dust and chopped reeds-filled UP composites 
[3]. The iron used for the mold consisted of dual plates. The polished defect-free first 
FIGURE 8.5 Fewer examples of co-monomers and monomers utilized for the preparation 
of partial co-polyesters and aromatic homo-polyesters [43].146 Polyester-Based Biocomposites
plate served as the base of the mold while the second plate served as the cover to 
attain uniform thickness. Figure 8.6a depicts the cast mold, while Figure 8.6b shows 
the compression apparatus. Ganesan and Kaliyamoorthy [1] adopted the hand lay-up 
technique to produce wood dust-filled woven jute fiber-reinforced polyester compos￾ites. The stainless-steel mold (300×300mm) was polished with a wax-dipped paper 
cloth. The thoroughly mixed, accelerated, and catalyzed UPR was poured in the 
stainless-steel mold for the fabrication of the composite samples.
A lot of curing practices are available in composite fabrication. However, allow￾ing the composite to cure at room temperature is the most basic method. Curing 
can also be sped up via application of heat and pressure. Coconut and wood fiber￾reinforced composites were produced by mixing coconut and wood fiber rigorously 
in polyester resin to obtain a uniform mixture, which was conveyed into the mold 
plate and pressure of 2 tons applied for 60 minutes. The samples were then allowed 
to cure under the sunlight for 3 days [46]. Ahmed and Mei [47] used aluminum 
mold castings to develop rubber saw dust-reinforced UP composites. The compos￾ites were cured after a day at room temperature, post-cured for 6 hours at 60°C 
and an additional 5 hours at 150°C. Nunez et al. [48] produced wood particle fiber￾reinforced composites via compression molding while hand lay-up and compression 
molding were adopted in the manufacturing of the hybrid composites. After 6 hours 
at room temperature and under pressure, the plagues were cured and subsequently 
post-cured at 150°C for 1.5 hours.
Other methods of wood fiber-reinforced composites fabrication have been devel￾oped based on the materials, the part design, application, and end use [49]. Glass 
fiber/UPR/poplar wood composites were produced via prepreg/press method using 
laboratory instruments and machines [50]. The glass fiber was dipped in a container 
of hardener and UPR for impregnation of the resin on the fabric. The fabric was 
extruded with a roller and accelerator sprayed on the fabric. The fabric was finally 
sandwiched fabric between the poplar wood and cold pressed to produce the com￾posite (Figure 8.7).
Needling mat polyester/wood composite fiber was produced using carded polyes￾ter web with wood sprinkled uniformly on the polyester web [51]. Multilayer wood 
fiber composite web and polyester fiber were finally needled by needle punching to 
form the polyester/wood composite fiber [51].

8.5 PROPERTIES OF WOOD–POLYESTER COMPOSITES
8.5.1 Mechanical Properties
The mechanical characteristics of natural fiber composites play a big role in their 
structural applications. On fiber-filled composites, a variety of mechanical tests are 
performed, some of which are extremely specialized to a particular application. 
These tests can be used to define the mechanical behavior of any composite to a sig￾nificant extent, as well as provide insight into other potential application areas [52].
Farhan [3] studied and compared the Young’s modulus and flexural strength of 
saw dust and chopped reed-filled UP composite. They observed that saw dust-filled 
polyester composite recorded lower flexural strength and modulus than the chopped 
reed composites. This decrease was attributed to size of saw dust being lesser than the 
chopped reeds, thereby decreasing the adhesion between matrix and saw dust. The 
effect of WF on styrene-diluted UP thermoset resin was also studied [48]. The study 
recorded an increase in tensile modulus from 3.4GPa for the unreinforced compos￾ites to a maximum of 4.94GPa when WF was introduced. However, a decrease in the 
tensile strength was observed.
In another studies, the mechanical behavior of WF-reinforced UPR was evaluated 
[18]. Before and after accelerated aging, the mechanical attributes of the composites 
were investigated. The flexural strength was observed to reduce both before (108–
74MPa) and after aging (69–39MPa). However, the hardness was seen to increase 
(36–45MPa) before aging but a reduction was noticed after accelerated aging. In a 
previous study, Paczkowski et al. [19] synthesized and characterized WF green com￾posite-filled UPR from recycled PET. Inclusion of WF fiber into the resin increased 
the flexural modulus and Barcol hardness from 3.59 to 3.81GPa and 36–45 HBa, 
FIGURE 8.7 The prepreg/press fabrication method of glass fiber/UPR/poplar wood com￾posites [50].148 Polyester-Based Biocomposites
respectively. However, the flexural strength, mechanical loss factor, and strain at 
break of the green composites were all decreased. The addition of WF improved the 
composite’s hardness by reducing brittleness and increasing the polyester composite’s 
resistance to deformations, as well as causing stronger interactions between atoms and 
molecules, thereby increasing hardness and improving its resistance to scratch.
Edoziuno et al. [53] examined the hardness of particulate wood charcoal-rein￾forced polyester composites. An increase was noticed on addition of the wood char￾coal particulate, from 16.6 HBW and having a maximum of 43 HBW when 20wt% 
of wood charcoal was introduced. Also, increase in specific wear rate in the compos￾ite was noticed. The wear rate increased from 0.048 for the unreinforced composite 
to a maximum of 0.628 (15wt%). The flexural properties of wood dust and coir fiber￾reinforced polyester composites were investigated [54]. The flexural behavior of the 
composite saw a reduction from 20.85 to 15.40MPa on addition of 1wt% wood dust. 
This dramatic reduction was ascribed to non-uniform alignment between fiber and 
filler particle. However, continuous addition of wood dust led to an increase, up to a 
maximum of 31.32MPa, at wood dust loading of 7wt% before another decrease in 
flexural strength was noticed, possibly, due to the increase in viscosity in the matrix 
and in turn increase in porosity and decrease in the wettability of the composite.
Barbosa et al. [55] investigated the toughness behavior of eucalyptus wood fiber￾reinforced polyester composite by means of Charpy impact test. From their observa￾tions, incorporation of wood fiber into polyester matrix considerably improved the 
impact strength of the composite. Improvement from 23.8 J/m (unreinforced) to 251.1 
J/m (30wt% wood fiber) was recorded.
Apparently, as a result of the minimal eucalyptus fiber/polyester matrix bound￾ary shear stress, an increase in toughness of the composite was achieved. This 
resulted in large rupture areas following a higher absorbed energy due to a longitu￾dinal propagation of the cracks all through the interface. The long-term behavior of 
wood–polyester composite material, reinforced with glass fiber, was reported [56]. 
The purpose of the study was to evaluate the long-term performance of the materi￾als by the Goldenblat–Kopnov criterion. The studied model was a sandwich type, 
where the upper and lower flanges are glass/polyester composite material while the 
intermediate layer is pine wood. The observations of the calculated results show 
that the conditions of strength to the dangerous points of the plate were met for this 
type of material.
Laksono, Ernawati, and Maryanti [44] recorded the modulus of elasticity of 
Bangkirai wood-reinforced polyester composite. Increase was observed in the result 
as the wood fibers were introduced into the polyester composite (1.46–2.22GPa) 
(Figure 8.8). The improvements in the elastic modulus were attributed to the effec￾tive distribution of pressure between fillers and matrix [57]. Also, the mechanical 
behavior of hybrid wood dust and coir-reinforced polyester composites was evaluated 
[45]. The tensile performance of the composites was raised by nearly 10% on addi￾tion of 7.5% particles of Teak wood dust to the composite. Further increase up to 24% 
was also reported on increasing the wood particles to 20%. Jose et al. also reported 
that addition of wood dust in the composite increased the flexural characteristic. The 
flexural performance of the specimen, which has 7.5% wood dust with 15% of fiber 
content, was 12% greater than that of composites with no wood dust.Wood Fiber-Reinforced Polyester Composite 149
The hardness, braking time, and wear properties of wood powder and coconut fiber 
polyester composite were investigated [46]. The composition with 40% wood powder 
and 0% coconut fiber had the maximum hardness value (59 VHN). The hardness of the 
UP composites reduced with growing composition of coconut fiber. However, inclu￾sion of coconut fiber led to a reduced braking time and wear properties (Figure 8.9). 
Marcovich et al. [58] studied sisal and WF composites made from UP thermoset. The 
use of sisal and wood fibers led to an improvement in flexural strength. The flexural 
strength obtained was higher than that observed for WF composites and sisal compos￾ites. In a previous study [59] the reliance of mechanical performance of WF–polyester 
composite on moisture content was examined. The results noticed that the compressive 
and flexural strength determined on the wet samples were poor. These properties were 
worse as the humidity of the environment increases. This was ascribed to the detriment 
of wood fiber strength in wet conditions.

8.5.2 Water Properties
Moisture diffusion in composites can cause other qualities, such as mechanical and 
electrical properties, to deteriorate. The amount of water absorbed is influenced by 
factors such as the type of material, exposure time, additives, and temperature [60,61]. 
Three different mechanisms are involved in diffusion of water molecules. The first 
mechanism involves water molecules diffusing via tiny gaps in between polymer 
chains. Following that is the capillary transport into the gaps and defects at fiber–
matrix interfaces, and finally, swelling processes that propagate micro-cracks in the 
matrix. Water molecules penetrate in natural fiber-reinforced composites through 
micro-cracks, when in wet environment. This leads to a reduced interfacial bonding of 
the fiber with the matrix, thereby leading to rebinding between fiber and matrix [62].
The effect of water in saw dust-filled polyester composites were studied [3] and 
compared to chopped reed composites. Saw dust composite had the minimum value 
of weight gain of water due to the bonding between the polyester and saw dust reduced 
the penetration of water to the material. Ahmad and Mei [47] showed the water absorp￾tion of rubber wood saw dust-filled UPR composite from recycled PET. The effect of 
both sodium hydroxide (NaOH)-treated and untreated wood was investigated. It was 
observed that raising the filler content led to increased water absorption properties. 
However, the value considerably decreased with surface change of the wood. The 
untreated rubber wood saw dust/UPR composite had deficient wettability and their 
bonding toward the UPR is ascribed to the hydrophilic property of the filler.
Ansari, Skifvars, and Berglund [63] revealed the moisture sorption proper￾ties of wood cellulose nanofiber-reinforced UPR. The moisture sorption of the 
composites was studied in different relative humidity (RH50, RH90). The sorp￾tion properties of the composite were seen to increase on the introduction of 
wood cellulose nanofiber into the UPR. The percentage water uptake of Garjon 
wood and Gamari wood particles-reinforced composites was also studied [64]. 
From  their research findings, pristine polyester had minimal water absorption 
inclination. However, the water absorption of the composite increased with the 
rise in the wood particle content (Figure 8.10). Water absorption in composites 
leads to swelling of fibers till the cell walls are completely filled with water. This 
saturation leads to void formation or composite delamination as water exists as 
free water in the void structure. Another effect of water absorption is the dete￾rioration of the interfacial bonding and hydrolytic degradation of both fiber and 
matrix [65].
High water absorption could be caused by fiber cracking and blistering, whereas 
degradation causes tiny molecules to be leached [66]. Abdul Mun’aim et al. [67] eval￾uated the water absorption properties of mixed and Cengal saw dust polyester com￾posites. The minimum and maximum water absorption was noticed at 5% and 25% 
Cengal wood dust. The increase in water absorption was said to be due to increased 
number of micro-voids on the surface of the composites. This is a consequence of the 
bigger amount of poor adhesion area between hydrophilic saw dust and hydrophobic 
polymer matrix.
The hydrophilic property of cellulosic fibers, which is related to the existence of 
numerous H-bonds (OH– groups) between macromolecules of cell walls in fibers, Wood Fiber-Reinforced Polyester Composite 151
allows them to absorb moisture. By removing these groups, cellulosic fibers’ water 
absorption can be reduced. This can be accomplished by using surface modification 
techniques and applying a polymer coating to the fibers’ surfaces [68].
8.5.3 Thermal Properties
The manufacturing temperature plays an important role in the production process of 
polymer composites, as the thermal stability of natural fibers composite is a relevant 
aspect to be considered because it plays an important role [69]. The maximum tem￾perature at which any given fiber decomposes is regarded as its thermal stability [70]. 
The hemicellulose, cellulose, and lignin contents of natural fibers decompose at vari￾ous temperatures, leading to the total decomposition of the fiber as a whole [71]. The 
thermal stability of fibers is considerably improved by eradicating as much hemi￾cellulose, lignin, and other alkaline-soluble components from the fiber as possible, 
whether by physical, chemical, or biological means [52,72]. The thermal characteris￾tics of natural fibers-filled composites are determined using different methods. This 
helps to understand the appropriateness of various fiber-reinforced composite for 
specific applications. Differential scanning calorimetry [73,74], dynamic mechanical 
analysis [75,76], and thermogravimetric analysis [76,77] are the methods reported to 
be used in literature for thermal analysis of composites.
Al-Anie, Hassan, and Hadithy [78] investigated the thermal conductivity of 
WF-incorporated polyester composite. The thermal conductivity of the composites 
FIGURE 8.10 (a) Water absorption behavior of 10% (w/w) saw dust polyester composite; 
(b) water absorption behavior of 5% (w/w) saw dust polyester composite. KRC, GMC, P, and 
GRC denote kerosene wood particles, Gamari, pure polyester, and Garjan, respectively [64].152 Polyester-Based Biocomposites
was reduced from 10.56–8.06 w/mc◦ when WF was increased from 5% to 20% 
wt.%. The decrease was due to the fact that WF has poor thermal conductivity and it 
was also suggested that the inability of the WF to form crosslinks with the polyester 
resin and the formation of spaces from the introduction of WF in the composites 
led to the impedance of thermal conductivity. The thermal properties of WFs from 
different wood species in UPR were investigated [79]. Pine and eucalyptus WF 
showed similar final region of degradation. The maximum differential thermogra￾vimetry (DTG) peak temperature appeared at 285°C and 366°C for pine sample, 
and at 287°C and 364°C for eucalyptus. Lower thermal stability was recorded for 
Marmelero with a peak of 342°C.
The significance of wood cellulose nanofiber on the Tg of UP composites was 
investigated by Ansari et al. [63]. The Tg of the composites were seen to increase 
strongly with increase in wood cellulose nanofiber content. An increase from 66°C 
(unreinforced composite) to 78°C (for 45% wood nanofiber-reinforced composites) 
was noticed. The increased Tg was said to be an indication of constrained molecu￾lar mobility in the UP network, due to proximity of high specific surface area of 
wood nanofibrils.
The effect of WF on Tg of reinforced polyester composites was studied [18]. No 
noticeable changes were observed in Tg on addition of WF to the polyester resin. 
However, the storage modulus at the glassy stage increased to a maximum on addi￾tion of 2wt% WF and to maximum at the rubbery state on addition of 5wt% of WF. 
In a previous study [19], the glass transition temperature of the WF–polyester resin 
was greater than that of the pure resin (100°C). The glass transition temperature 
increased from 101°C to 105°C as the amount of WF in the composite increased.
8.5.4 Physico-Chemical Properties
The physico-chemical properties of wood-reinforced polyester composites have been 
documented in a number of studies.
The wettability and penetration of UPR into wood surface were studied through 
their contact angle and absorptivity [50]. This reflects the physical-chemical affinity 
between the fiber surface and the matrix resin, and it is crucial to examine the bond 
ability between wood and the matrix resin [80]. Dynamic contact angle is mostly used 
to study the wettability of wood surfaces and matrix. During a period of 10 minutes, 
Cheng et al. [50] found that the contact angle fell from 103° to 33° and that the absorp￾tivity was 1.0 × 10−4 g/mm2. Because of UPR’s favorable wettability and penetrability, it 
was able to permeate wood and produce a good wood/UPR interface during fabrication.
As a strategy to improve environmental protection performance, the use of nat￾ural fibers in the production of sound absorbing materials has received some atten￾tion. Sound absorption performance of wood–polyester composite fiber needling 
mat were analyzed [51]. The study showed that increase in flow resistivity and 
density increased the sound absorption characteristics of the polyester compos￾ites. Also, the improvements of sound absorption characteristics of the composites 
were dependent on the wood fiber surface roughness and small cracks. The sound 
insulation capabilities of natural fiber Galam wood–polyester composites with 
respect to filler composition and shape were studied [51]. The studies investigated 
the sound insulation of WF and wood shavings polyester composites. The best Wood Fiber-Reinforced Polyester Composite 153
insulation properties were observed in composites containing 7% saw dust filler at 
800 Hz sound frequency [51,67].
Abdul Mun’aim et al. [67] studied the thickness swelling of Cengal and mixed 
saw dust polyester composite. The highest thickness swelling was recorded at 25% 
Cengal saw dust with 0.6242% thickness swelling. The observation was ascribed 
to be due to ample porosity or the presence of voids on the surface of the polyester 
composites leading to the dimensional change of cellulose composites.
The density of Kraft fiber-reinforced UPR composites was investigated [81]. The 
composite had comparable densities, ranging from 1371 to 1456kg/m3 with maxi￾mum difference of 6.2%. The contact angles were studied for three different wood 
species (Douglas fir, maple, and oak wood). The wettability of the wood with UP 
was studied before and after surface roughening [82]; the minimum average contact 
angle, 14°, was noticed after 5 seconds for Douglas fir sanded with 120 grit. When 
compared to un-sanded veneers, maple, sanding Douglas fir, and oak veneer sheets 
with 120 grit enhanced their wettability by decreasing contact angles. However, the 
Douglas fir veneer didn’t show significant improvement. Dust and contaminants were 
cleaned from the surface of the veneer by 120 grits, creating a fresh, smooth surface, 
subsequently increasing veneer wettability [83,84].
8.5.5 Morphological Properties
Morphology is a phenomenon that focuses on studying the structure and relation￾ships of polymer composites. It studies the arrangement of the wood fibers in the 
polyester matrix. These structures and arrangements affect the performance of the 
polyester composites. Some researchers have examined the morphological character￾istics of wood-reinforced polyester composites.
The morphology of Bangkirai wood fibers in UPR was studied [44]. Scanning 
electron microscope (SEM) showed that there were voids in the 40% and 60% 
volume fraction wood-reinforced composites. This indicated trapped air bubbles 
(Figure 8.11). The studies showed that 60% filler fraction has lesser voids than 
40% filler fraction. When hand lay-up method of composite production was used, 
FIGURE 8.11 SEM observations showing void marks (a and b) and SEM observations after 
bending tests on 40% and 60% wood filler fraction (c and d) [44].154 Polyester-Based Biocomposites
voids are usually unavoidable because it interacts directly with open air. Though 
the matrix transfers load to the reinforcer, however, the stress areas will move to 
the void areas and cause cracks when the composites receive load, thereby leading 
to early failure of the composite. Void content also depends on the degree of fiber 
orientation [85].
The morphology of Galam wood powder and wood shavings-reinforced polyes￾ter was investigated. The composite with wood powder appeared to be more evenly 
distributed, and the smaller particle size encouraged greater binding between the 
wood powders than the composite with wood shavings, which had bigger particle 
size. During application, the wood shavings reinforced composite cracks foremost 
due to encountered stress. Air bubbles were discovered in the samples, which may 
be remedied using the proper hand-lay approach [86]. The fracture morphology of 
wood particle-reinforced polyester composites was investigated using SEM [64]. The 
results indicated that fracture was initiated in the pure polyester sample due to dust 
particles picked up during molding or fabrication period. However, the fracture in 
wood particle composites was initiated by the air bubbles. Increase in wood fiber 
leads to wood agglomeration which Hossain et al. also thought to have contributed to 
the reduced strength of the wood particle-reinforced composites.
8.6 APPLICATIONS OF WOOD–POLYESTER COMPOSITES
WPCs are widely used in construction components such as flooring planks and 
screens, as well as in automotive components [87–89]. Aside from these, some more 
specific applications for WPCs, such as decking, cladding, paneling, fencing, and 
furniture, have been identified and tested in recent years. WPCs, for example, have 
been used in the production of pallets [90]. When compared to other synthetic struc￾tures such as fiber cement composites, WPCs can be considered value-added materi￾als due to their wide range of applications.
Wood–polyester composites have found a special application in 3D printing. It 
has been determined that 3D printing is a critical component of the next-level indus￾trial revolution [91–93]. The most common utilized process for 3D printing strips 
is fused deposition modeling, which employs polycarbonate, acrylonitrile–butadi￾ene–styrene, polyamide, and thermoplastic material blends [94–96]. However, some 
of these materials are harmful to the environment, and harmful substances can be 
released during printing, causing significant harm to the environment and the human 
body [97]. Environmentally friendly aliphatic polyesters, on the other hand, have 
been developed [98]. Polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) is one of the most interesting 
of these environmentally friendly polyesters [99]. PHA has good biocompatibility, 
biodegradability, nontoxicity, processability, and mechanical properties [100]. When 
PHA/WF composite is made into 3D printing strips, for example, the composite’s 
value and competitiveness are increased [99].
8.7 CONCLUSION
Wood properties have been reported to be dependent on the tree from which it has 
been obtained. Wood fibers or WF derived from wood waste are utilized in the right 
fiber to matrix ratio to produce wood polymer composites, having properties similar Wood Fiber-Reinforced Polyester Composite 155
to or even better than wood. Wood fiber polymer composites are known for their eco￾friendly nature in addition to their higher modulus to weight ratio when likened to syn￾thetic fiber composites. However, the incompatibility of the wood fibers with polymer 
matrices and their high tendency to absorb moisture were reported to often reduce the 
tendency of bio-fibers to act as reinforcements and thus limit their utilization. Fiber 
chemical treatments such as isocyanate treatment, alkaline treatment, silane treatment, 
acrylation, benzoyl treatment, maleated coupling agents, and peroxide treatment have 
been reported to have introduced various levels of improvement in fiber strengths, 
water resistance, fiber–matrix adhesion, and thermal resistance in wood fiber com￾posites, and are therefore used for final composite applications. Incorporation of wood 
fibers in the right proportion into polymer matrices for composite manufacture has 
been understood to modify various properties of the polyester composite materials.

9.1 INTRODUCTION
Polyesters are polymers fabricated from a diol and dicarboxylic acid. Polyesters are 
very resilient thermoplastics and they have a wide variety of applications, based 
on how they have been synthesized and the resultant position of polymer chains 
(Kobayashi and Uyama, 2019). In the last few decades, various types of synthetic poly￾mers have been coupled with numerous cellulose-based fillers in order to enhance the

mechanical characteristics of the resultant composites (Gutierrez Cisneros, Bloemen 
and Mignon, 2021). Synthetic or petroleum-based composites have been largely used 
in various fields such as medical equipment, plastic bags, consumer goods, construc￾tion areas and the automotive domain (Aℓ-Maadeed, Shabana and Khanam, 2014; 
Noorunnisa Khanam and AlMaadeed, 2014). The worldwide production of plastics 
is increasing yearly, owing to the increasing usage of plastics. Generally, polyester￾based composites comprise polymer resins as the matrix and one or several fillers are 
incorporated into the resin in order to enhance the requirement of a specific objective. 
For example, composites for sports and aerospace applications need high thermal 
and mechanical characteristics (Rajak et al., 2019). Conventionally, synthetic fibres, 
such as glass, silicone and carbon, have been utilized as composite reinforcements. 
However, synthetic fillers have excellent characteristics but their processing cost is 
little high and they are toxic to environment and human health (Rajak, Wagh and 
Linul, 2021). Due to this fact, environmentally friendly materials, as fillers in poly￾mer composite, are attained with great recognition in the industries. Natural fillers 
have many beneficial characteristics, such as low cost, lightweight, nontoxic effect 
and decrease of the machinery abrasion. The usage of natural fillers for the strength￾ening of composites has gained considerable attention from both the industry and 
academia. There are many categories of natural fillers, such as oats, wood, barely, 
wood, hemp, rice, wheat, barley and flax (Sethulekshmi, Saritha and Joseph, 2022).
Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is one of the main crops; it surrounds ~1% of the earth 
surface and it is the primary food source for billions of the world’s population 
(FAOSTAT, n.d.). According to the United States Department of Agriculture, 500 
million tonnes of husked or milled rice were produced globally in the year 2020–
2021 (USDA ERS - Agricultural Trade, n.d.). Statistical studies showed that Asia 
produces ~90% of rice that is required for the global populations as illustrated in 
Figure 9.1. During the rice processing operation, rice husk is the by-product and it 
is segregated from rice grains during the milling process (Muthayya et al., 2014). 
Rice milling is a major industry in countries such as China, Pakistan, Indonesia, 
Malaysia, Bangladesh and India. Often, rice husks are eliminated by the incineration 
process and the incineration of rice husk produces toxic gases and ash fumes, which 
cause the severe air pollution (Thomas, 2018). The incorporation of rice husk as a 
filler in polyester aids in overcoming these disadvantages and acts as natural filler 
in the composite produced. In this chapter, we detailed the use of rice husk filler in 
polyester composites.
9.2 NATURAL FILLER AS POLYESTER COMPOSITES
Polymers or polyesters are generally filled with blended solid materials, e.g., glass 
or mineral. The filled polymers are not commonly accepted as composite materi￾als, despite the fact that they comprise more than one component (Kroczek et al., 
2022). Polymeric matrix composite materials are generally reinforced with long or 
short fibres. Natural fibre-reinforced polyester composites show a means to partially 
improve the negative environmental effects by incorporating biodegradable filler 
into the polyester-based composites (Nurazzi et al., 2021). The most common bio￾wastes are hemp, rice and husk, banana fibres, wood flour, kenaf, flax, hemp, coir, Polyester-Based Composites Reinforced with Rice Husk Fillers 163
jute wood flour, etc., often used as replacements for synthetic filler, namely steel, car￾bon, calcium hydroxyapatite and other petroleum-based filler (Andrew and Dhakal, 
2022). Certainly, the utilization of natural filler, which is a type of organic filler, is 
growing, and it has many advantages over synthetic fillers (Aℓ-Oqla and Salit, 2017). 
Cotton fibres were used as reinforced material in radar aircraft. Thereafter, several 
cellulosic products wastes have been utilized as natural filler in polyester-based prod￾ucts (Soutis, 2005). Because of their good mechanical characteristics, low density, 
significant processing benefits and low cost, the growth of natural fillers-reinforced 
polyester composites has steadily been recorded (Rinawa et al., 2021). Natural fibres 
as fillers in composites are used mainly in the automotive, electromagnetic, aero￾space and biomedical applications.
These fillers could confer some advantages to the materials in respect of density 
control, fire-proofing, better optical, electrical, mechanical, magnetic and thermal 
properties (Aℓ-Oqla et al., 2015). Scientists around the world have researched on 
the merits of natural fibres reinforced with polyester composites, and some of the 
broadly used natural fibres as fillers in polyester composites are listed in Table 9.1 
(Esa and Abdul Rahim, 2013; Korotkova et al., 2016).
RH is one of the most valuable agricultural by-products or wastes and it has the 
potential to reinforce polyester matrices for the growth of added-value products. The 
major components of RH are tabulated in Table 9.2 and the pictorial representation 
of RH is given in Figure 9.2. RH is the inedible guarding layer of the grain and it is 
always eliminated or separated from the grain (Chan, 2016). In addition to this, the 
environmental benefits of integrating RH with polyester or polymer materials are

increasing due to the unique and unmatched composition with other types of natural 
fillers, high availability and low cost (Aℓ-Oqla et al., 2015). Even though RH has 
numerous advantages, the major demerit in synthesizing RH composites is their low 
compatibility to the hydrophobic matrices due to their hydrophilic nature (Majeed 
et al., 2017). The low compatibility of RH hinders its interfacial interaction between 
the polymer matrices and RH filler (Aℓ-Oqla et al., 2015). A study reported that 
RH-reinforced polypropylene (PP) composite showed low tensile strength due to the 
low compatibility between the matrix material and the RH filler. The study suggested 
that the use of a coupling agent would improve the compatibility within the matrix 
material and the filler (Arjmandi, Hassan and Zakaria, 2017).
The reinforcing potential of RH filler mostly depends on its interfacial interaction 
with the matrix material. Improved interfacial interactions produce greater mechani￾cal properties (Malkapuram, Kumar and Negi, 2009). However, the intrinsic varia￾tions between hydrophilic, the RH and hydrophobic, the polymer matrices hinder 
the interfacial interaction and compatibility between the RH filler and the polymer 
matrices (Yap et al., 2020). In order to improve the compatibility, physical and chem￾ical pre-treatment methods were employed by researchers to reduce RH surface, with 
the motivation to activate new reactive site or region for interfacial interactions.
9.3 PRE-TREATMENT OF RICE HUSK
9.3.1 Physical Pre-Treatment
Physical pre-treatment methods are often used to improve compatibility between the 
hydrophobic matrices and the hydrophilic RH filler (Ciannamea, Stefani and Ruseckaite, 
2010). Steam treatment is a physical treatment in which high-pressure steam is applied 
in a steam explosion unit. The unit is quickly depressurized, which leads to steam explo￾sion comprising the application of high-pressure steam in a steam explosion unit (Ndazi 
et al., 2007). The unit is rapidly depressurized resulting in steam-exploded fibre. This 
process separates the cellulose (structural element) from lignin and hemicellulose (non￾structural elements), as well as the reactive site of the natural fibre becomes apparent. An 
improved availability of filler’s reactive region will enhance the interfacial interaction, 
which leads to better mechanical characteristics (Hakeem et al., 2015).
9.3.2 Chemical Treatment
Like physical treatment, chemical methods also help to enhance the interfacial inter￾action between the components, making up the composites. The additions of cou￾pling agent or compatibilizer, alkaline, acetylation and silane treatment are the most 
practised chemical methods. In comparison to all methods, the usage of compatibil￾izer has increased the compatibility of RH and the matrix. However, the alkaline 
method of RH is the most preferable than other treatment methods, due to its low 
cost and high effectiveness.
Soaking RH in a NaOH solution helps to remove the non-structural parts of the 
RH. The removal of the non-structural parts improves the interfacial bonding and 
increases the mechanical properties of the resulting composites (Ndazi, Nyahumwa 
and Tesha, 2008).166 Polyester-Based Biocomposites
Acetic anhydride treatment of RH improves the hydrophobicity by reducing the 
hydroxyl (OH) groups. During this treatment, acetic anhydride cross-links with the 
RH hydroxyl groups. This results in the OH group being substituted by the acetyl 
group. This is similar to acetylation process, which lessens the hydrophilic nature of 
RH in order to elevate its affinity with polyethylene (PE) (Fávaro et al., 2010; Hill, 
Khalil and Hale, 1998).
Silane treatment is another effective method to improve the RH compatibility 
with polymer matrices. Silane has two bifunctional structures and during this treat￾ment the silane’s one reactive group combines with the OH group of the natural fibre; 
meanwhile, the second reactive group is polymerized with the matrix component 
(Xie et al., 2010). This interaction causes the formation of covalent bond between the 
natural fibre and polymer matrices. Thus, this interaction improves the characteris￾tics of the filler in polymer matrices. Another research was reported on rice husk ash 
(RHA)-reinforced high-density polyethylene (HDPE). The RHA-HDPE composites 
showed ~18% higher tensile and higher thermostability than virgin the HDPE did. 
The study proved that RHA is one of the best reinforcing materials (Abdelmouleh 
et al., 2007). Zhao et al. (2009) analyzed the flammability and thermal stability of 
HDPE-RH in e-composites. The study was evident that the flammability of the com￾posites increased with increase in RH content and that the incorporation of RH had 
retarded thermal-oxidation process.
9.4 RH-REINFORCED POLYMER COMPOSITES
A polymer is a material that comprises large molecules, consisting of numerous 
repeating subunits, and it can be produced through the polymerization of monomer. 
Both the natural and synthetic polymers play vital roles in the everyday human life. 
Herein, we discussed some of the most important polymers that are often reinforced 
with rice husk.
PE is a polymer also known as polythene; the IUPAC name is poly(methylene or 
polyethene). It is a commonly used plastic for many and everyday purposes. PE is 
classified into HDPE and low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and they vary in their 
molecular weights, thermal properties and crystallization nature. When compared 
to other polymers, polyethene is the most commonly used polymer (Ronca, 2017).
HDPE is a type of PE that is synthesized from the ethylene monomer. HDPE is 
a thermoplastic, known for its high strength-to-density ratio. HPDE has very broad 
range of applications, ranging from storage container to pipes. Relatively, the melt￾ing point of HPDE is high when compared to other plastics. The chemical formula 
of HPDE is (C2H4)n (Kim et al., 1996). The density of HDPE varies between 930 and 
970kg/m3 (Rodrigue, Kavianiboroujeni and Cloutier, 2017). Even though HDPE is 
non-biodegradable, it has been used in recycled products for automobile parts, etc., 
(Subramanian, 2000). For the production of HDPE plastics, many synthetic fillers are 
being utilized. RH filler is used in many studies to replace the synthetic fillers (Medina 
and Dzalto, 2018). An investigation reported that RH-incorporated HDPE composites 
resulted in adequate rigidity and strength by integrating various coupling agents, such 
as ethylene-(acrylic ester)-(glycidyl methacrylate) terpolymers and ethylene-(acrylic 
ester)-(maleic anhydride) terpolymers. The results showed that the incorporation Polyester-Based Composites Reinforced with Rice Husk Fillers 167
of coupling agent enhanced the strength of the composites (Panthapulakkal, Sain 
and Law, 2005). Rahman et al. studied the RH-filled HPDE composites for injec￾tion moulding purposes. Ultra-Plast TP01 and UltraPlast TP10 were used as lubri￾cant and coupling agent, respectively. The melting flow rate of the composites was 
reduced with increased composition of RH (Rahman et al., 2010). Similarly, low filler 
size decreased the impact strength of the composite and high filler content and also 
reduced the impact strength. Gejo et al., 2010 reported that 30% of RH was found 
to have increased the rheological characteristics and the impact strength of the bio￾composites produced. RH was used as filler in recycled high-density polyethylene 
(rHPDE) and in addition to the RH, wood dust was also used as secondary filler, 
antioxidant and fire retardants as mineral filler. The overall performance of the RH￾and sawdust-reinforced composites was increased. Besides, the antioxidant and fire 
retardants enhanced the ageing and durability properties, respectively. Similar to 
the above-mentioned study, RH filler-treated with maleic acid PE-reinforced rHDPE 
enhanced the interfacial bonding (Tong et al., 2014). In another study on rice husk, 
an 8% alkaline (NaOH) was employed to treat rice husk flour and the result was an 
improvement in the interaction between RH and matrix. The treatment also exhibited 
positive impact on the mechanical characteristics (Bisht and Gope, 2018). Further 
studies also investigated RH-reinforced rHDPE in which the RH surface was modi￾fied through alkali, UV/O3 (ultraviolet) and acid treatment. The result of the study 
indicated that alkali treatment resulted in higher tensile strength and other mechanical 
properties than the other treatments employed (Hamid, Ab Ghani and Ahmad, 2012).
Like HDPE, LDPE is a thermoplastic, which is synthesized from the monomer 
ethylene (Goswami and Mangaraj, 2011). LDPE is the first grade of PE and it is 
produced by the high-pressure process (Butler, 2010). It is broadly utilized for the 
manufacturing of numerous items, such as bottle, plastic bags, containers, laboratory 
equipment and computer parts. LDPE has higher ductility but low strength, stiffness 
and hardness when compared to HDPE with lower hardness (Achilias et al., 2007). 
When compared to HDPE, only few investigations on LDPE-RH composite have 
been reported. A report stated that 30% of RH-loaded LDPE composites showed an 
increase in tensile strength and other mechanical properties of the composites are 
marginally enhanced (U. et al., 2013). Santiagoo et al., 2015 developed LDPE nano￾composite based modified atmospheric packaging films which consist of rice husk 
(RH), and montmorillonite (MMT).The outcome of the study found that an increased 
concentration of RH in the hybrid filler enhanced the tensile modulus, crystallin￾ity and the melting temperature, whereas decreases in the tear and tensile strength 
were recorded. Likewise, various concentrations of RH filler and recycled LDPE 
and virgin PE amalgamation was carried out. The tensile modulus, Brinell hard￾ness and flexural strength increased with RH filler loadings, and in contrast to this 
observation, increased filler loading reduced the impact strength. Along with this, 
the tensile strength improved with a 10% filler loading (Bertin and Robin, 2002). 
MMT nanoclay and RH-filled LDPE were studied. A study conducted by Hwang, 
Kwon and Lee, 2018 stated that maleic anhydride-modified PE was exploited as a 
compatibilizer. The study resulted in an improved interfacial adhesion between the 
matrix and the filler, which produced better barrier and tensile characteristics of the 
resulting composites.168 Polyester-Based Biocomposites
Medium-density polyethylene (MDPE) is also another type of PE, whose den￾sity is lower than the LDPE (density range: 0.926–0.940 g/cm3
). MDPE also has 
better drop-and-shock resistance characteristics (Crawford and Throne, 2002). 
Additionally, MDPE has better stress-cracking resistance and with low notch sen￾sitivity when compared to HDPE (Ayyer, Hiltner and Baer, 2007). MDPE is com￾monly used in packaging films, sacks, screw closure, gas pipes, etc. (AℓMaadeed, 
Ouederni and Noorunnisa Khanam, 2013). A research aimed at analyzing the effect 
of nanoclay-loaded in MDPE/RH-based composites was carried out. RH was treated 
with NaOH in order to improve the characteristics of RH; in addition to this treat￾ment, maleic anhydride-grafted PE was added to the composite in order to improve 
the interfacial bonding between RH and MDPE matrix. The results exhibited the 
fact that the composite recorded better tensile strength, flexural strength and other 
mechanical properties when compared to the untreated MDPE (Thungphotrakul, 
Somboonwanna and Prapainainar, 2020).
Linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) is a linear PE, with substantial range of 
short branches. It is generally produced via the copolymerization of ethylene mono￾mers with longer chain olefins. LLDPE is structurally different from LDPE (Ranjan, 
n.d.). Like other polyethene, LLDPE has a wide variety of applications, such as plas￾tic bags, pouches, lids, toys and pipes, just as the usage of LLDPE is increasing 
(Satapathy et al., 2018). The rice husk powder filler-loaded LLDPE/recycled acryloni￾trile butadiene rubber composites were analyzed. Santiagoo et al., 2015 reported that 
epoxidized natural rubber-50 (ENR-50) was used as the compatibilizer. The struc￾tural outcome shows that ENR-50 improved the interactions between LLDPE and 
RHP (rice husk particle) filler. In addition, the incorporation of RHP filler improved 
the mechanical characteristics of the resulting composites. In another study, rice 
husk-loaded LLDPE/styrene butadiene rubber (SBR) composite blends with maleic 
anhydride as a compatibilizer was prepared. Herewith, virgin SBR-LLDPE was also 
compared with RH-loaded SBR-LLDPE composite. Similar to other studies, the 
RH-filled LLDPE/SBR exhibited increased mechanical properties than the virgin 
SBR-LLDPE composites (Zurina, Ismail and Bakar, 2004; Wang et al., 2014). The 
NaOH treated RH reinforced with LLDPE had a positive influence on the compos￾ite constituents’ compatibility, tear strength, composite and the Young’s modulus 
(Hwang, Kwon and Lee, 2018). Further examination also indicated the fact that the 
surface-modified RH had better interaction with the LLDPE matrix and displayed 
higher rigidity and compressive strength. In the same way as the previous study, the 
surface-modified RH filler in the LLDPE recorded elevated stiffness and strength 
characteristics (Abdul Wahab et al., 2016).
PP, also known as polypropene, is synthesized from the monomer, propylene, and 
PP has been used in a wide variety of applications. A research was carried out on 
maleic anhydride-altered PP reinforced with RH. The result showed that the compos￾ite recorded superior flexural and tensile properties (Raghu et al., 2018). Many inves￾tigations have shown that RH-reinforced PP has improved overall characteristics.
Polystyrene (PS) is a synthetic aromatic monomer, also known as styrene. The 
Young’s modulus of RH/waste PS composite was found to have increased with 
increasing RH content, up to ~40wt.% when compared to pure PS. Like PE, it is one 
of the most commonly used plastics. PS is naturally transparent in nature and it can Polyester-Based Composites Reinforced with Rice Husk Fillers 169
be coloured by using colourant. Generally, it is used in food packaging, trays, bottles, 
etc. RH contents of 30% and 40%-reinforced PS have greater moisture diffusivity 
and better Young’s modulus, respectively, than the unfilled PS (Farhan Zafar and 
Siddiqui, 2018).
Polyurethane (PU or PUR) is composed of organic groups that are combined 
by carbamate. PU is synthesized from a broad range of monomers (Kemona and 
Piotrowska, 2020). PUs are used in varnishes, coating, fibres, rigid and flexible foams, 
etc. (Somarathna et al., 2018). An investigation showed that PU foams, containing 
modified tung oil and RH filler have higher thermal property than the unfilled PU 
(Ribeiro da Silva et al., 2013).
Poly vinyl chloride (PVC) is the third most widely used and largest polymer in 
the world. PVC is used in doors, panels, construction pipes, plastic bottles, non-food 
packaging, etc. Maleic anhydride- and aminosilane-treated rice husk was used to 
reinforce PVC. The RH positively influenced the tribological and mechanical prop￾erties of the PVC composites and especially, the tensile properties of the resulting 
composites (Chand, Sharma and Fahim, 2010; Ramle, Romli and Abidin, 2013).
9.5 RH-REINFORCED POLYESTER MATRICES
9.5.1 Polyester
Polyester is a group of polymers that consists of ester functional groups in each of the 
repeat unit of its main chain. The naturally obtained polyesters are biodegradable, but 
the synthetic polyesters are not biodegradable. Synthetic polyesters are widely used in 
the clothing industry (Campbell, 2001). Synthetic polyester has a high environmental 
concern and it is more water-resistant than the natural polyesters. Polyester synthesis 
is commonly obtained via the polycondensation reaction. Azeotrope esterification, 
alcoholic transesterification, melt esterification and acylation are the most commonly 
used esterification methods for the production of polyesters (Otera, 1993). The indus￾trial applications of polyester are illustrated in Figure 9.3. India, Indonesia, Korea, 
United States, Japan and Taiwan are the major polyester-producing countries. When 
compared to the Western countries, Asian countries are the most dominant in poly￾ester production, as represented in Figure 9.4. Different types of polyester are used 
widely in various applications. Many investigations have proved that the incorpora￾tion of RH improved the characteristics of polyester matrices. The RH-reinforced 
polyester matrices is discussed in detail below.
Delamination is one of the major defects of machining composites and it is a 
main form of breakdown in drilled composite, which causes less bearing strength, 
surface finish and structural integrity of machines (Babu et al., 2016). In order to 
reduce the delamination process, nature fibre, e.g., RH fibre, was incorporated into 
polyester matrices of machines. Drilling process was carried out at three different 
speeds, geometries and feed rates. The results obtained from the work displayed that 
RH-loaded polyester matrices have less delamination value than the glass fibre-loaded 
fibre matrices. The mechanical and physical properties of RHA-filled polyester resin 
composites were analyzed. From the experiment, it was found that the bulk density 
and flexural strength were reduced with increase in the RHA content; however, the 170 Polyester-Based Biocomposites
FIGURE 9.4 Polyester-dominant countries across the globe.
FIGURE 9.3 General industrial applications of polyester, including construction material, 
electronic devices, clothing material, fabrics, PET bottles, packaging material, storage con￾tainers, automobile parts, biomedical devices and furniture.Polyester-Based Composites Reinforced with Rice Husk Fillers 171
water absorption rate was increased with increase in the RH addition. However, 
e-modulus of the composites was initially increased, but it suddenly decreased after 
the addition of 10% and 15% of RHA. The hardness of the composites also decreased 
with increase in RHA content. In contrast to this, a 5% of RHA increased the overall 
mechanical properties of composites (Barreno-Avila, Moya-Moya and Pérez-Salinas, 
2022; Azuan, Juraidi and Muhamad, 2012; Ahmad et al., 2005).
9.5.2 Unsaturated Polyesters Resins
Unsaturated polyesters resins (UPRs) are also called polyester resins or synthetic 
resin produced by polyhydric alcohol and dibasic organic acids. The chemical 
structure of UPR is given in Figure 9.5. UPRs are thermosetting resins and used 
in fibreglass, wall panels, printer tonners, bulk and sheet moulding compounds. 
An UPR, based on vinyl silane reinforced with RHA, was prepared and character￾ized. The RHA-reinforced composites have better mechanical and thermal prop￾erties than their unreinforced counterparts (Kanimozhi et al., 2014; Islam, 2016). 
RHA (5% to 25%)-loaded unsaturated polyesters were evaluated; in this study 
methyl ethyl ketone peroxide was utilized as the hardener. It was observed that 
10% of RH inclusion in a UPR matrix improved flexural and hardness properties. 
Besides, a 10% RH decreased the tensile strength; in contrast to this, the impact 
strength improved with a 5% RH. RH was reinforced into the unsaturated polyester 
matrices. The study found out that the flexural strength, flexural modulus, tensile 
strength and tensile modulus were increased with increase in RH fibres (Islam 
et al., 2015; Surata et al., 2014).
9.5.3 Polyethylene Terephthalate
Polyethylene terephthalate, abbreviated as PET, PETP and PETE, is the most cus￾tomary resin of the polyester group, and this is used in thermoforming, packaging, 
storage container, etc. PET (C10H8O4) comprises of units of the monomer, ethylene 
terephthalate (De Vos et al., 2021). PET can be synthesized from ethylene gly￾col or monoethylene glycol and dimethyl terephthalate (Fink, 2013). Based on the 
processing technique, PET could be available in semi-crystalline and amorphous 
forms (Arnoult, Dargent and Mano, 2007). The chemical structure of PET is given 
in Figure 9.6.
FIGURE 9.5 The chemical structure of unsaturated polyester resins.172 Polyester-Based Biocomposites
High amount of RH was loaded in biocomposites of recycled polyethylene tere￾phthalate (rPET) matrices. Ethylene-glycidyl methacrylate was used as a copolymer 
in order to enhance the compatibility of the immiscible rHDPE/rPET blend. Maleic 
anhydride polyethylene was utilized as a coupling agent in order to improve the inter￾action of matrix and fibre. The effect of natural fibre loadings on rHDPE/rPET blends 
was examined. The biocomposites loaded with RH filler have greater tensile strength 
(58%–172%), storage modulus and flexural modulus (80%–305%), when compared 
with the matrices without RH filler. These investigations concluded that RH filler 
can perform efficiently with rPET and rHDPE for the production of biocomposite 
products (Chen et al., 2015). The RH was combined with polyester resin, produced 
from a glycolyzed product of PET. This polyester reinforced with RH increased the 
hardness and tensile modulus (Ahmad et al., 2005). According to the study con￾ducted by Chen, Ahmad and Gan, 2016, recycled thermoplastic blend (rPET/rHDPE) 
was reinforced with RH via the moulding and extrusion processes. The composites 
recorded better improvements in storage, loss modulus, storage and thermal stability. 
The composites submerged in tap water, distilled water and seawater revealed lowest 
absorption of water. The thickness dimension of the composite specimens exhib￾ited the highest swelling values, followed by the width and then, the length dimen￾sions. The elastic modulus and tensile strength showed higher values than without 
RH-loaded composites.
This study focused on the thermal, morphological and rheological characteristics 
of PET and polyamide-6 composites. de Matos Costa et al., 2021, stated that RHA 
was used as filler. This study concluded that 20% RHA filler improved the rate of 
degradation of polyester matrices. In addition to this, during processing, the thermal 
stability of the composites and particle agglomeration size were increased in the 
RHA filler-incorporated matrices. The 70% RH-reinforced rPET and rHDPE com￾posites recorded increased tensile strength, elongation and flexural characteristics 
(Chen, Ahmad and Gan, 2018). Recycled PET loaded with RH filler was investigated. 
The study reported reduced tensile strength, impact strength and elongation-at-break, 
but with increased hardness and tensile modulus (Ahmad et al., 2005).
9.5.4 Poly-3-hydroxybutyrate
Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) is also known as polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) and 
belongs to the polyesters family. PHB is a biodegradable plastic and it is mainly 
FIGURE 9.6 The chemical structure of polyethylene terephthalate (Copyrights reserved, 
5312650765510).Polyester-Based Composites Reinforced with Rice Husk Fillers 173
synthesized by Methylobacterium, Bacillus megaterium and Cupriavidus necator
bacteria (McAdam et al., 2020). The structure of PHB is given in Figure 9.7. Due to 
its biodegradable nature, PHB is used in many industrial applications.
Poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB), loaded with 10% RH flour with dicumyl perox￾ide (DCP), used as compatibilizer, was studied. Simultaneously, poly(3-hydroxybu￾tyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) synthesized by mixture of bacterial cultures 
obtained from fruit pulp waste was reinforced into a green composite in the range 
between 5% and 50%. The results revealed that the incorporation of 20% of PHBV 
produced a green composite that has a low crystallinity, medium barrier function 
to flavour, high thermal stability, transparency and mechanical ductility. The PHB/
PHBV/RHF green composite films could be a good alternative in food packaging 
industry. The main aim of this investigation was to assess the effect of RH undergo￾ing hot water treatment in PHB matrix. The mechanical, chemical, morphological 
and physical properties were characterized. The RH-reinforced composites showed 
a better performance than the non-reinforced matrix (Melendez-Rodriguez et al., 
2019; Moura et al., 2018). Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-4-hydroxybutyrate) (P34HB) 
is a fourth-generation PHA family compound. Wu et al., 2018 stated that RHA￾reinforced P34HB composites were examined, and melamine phosphate-modified 
lignin was used as additive in the RHA-P34HB composites. RHA-P34HB displayed 
improved tensile tress, storage modulus and elongation-at-break. Besides, RH is 
often used as one of the sources to enhance the production of PHB in many studies.
9.5.5 Polylactic Acid
Polylactic acid (PLA) is a biodegradable polyester and is also called polylactide 
(PLA). PLA is produced from the condensation of lactic acid. PLA is one of the most 
widely used bioplastics throughout the world. It has a wide range of applications 
and majorly used in 3D printing of plastic filament material (Nofar et al., 2019). The 
structure of PLA is illustrated in Figure 9.8.
Three-dimensional printing filaments were made from biodegradable PLA com￾posited filled with renewable RH. PLA was grafted with acrylic acid (PLA-g-AA) 
and a coupling agent-treated RH (TRH) was incorporated into the PLA-RH bio￾composites in order to improve the characteristics. TRH was uniformly spread in 
the PLA-g-AA matrix. The PLA-g-AA-TRH improved the tensile and other charac￾teristics compared to the PLA-RH composites. Therefore, PLA-g-AA-TRH biocom￾posites could be utilized as biodegradable filaments in 3D printing (Wu and Tsou, 
2019). The other study aimed to develop biocomposites, based on the polybutylene 
succinate (PBS)/PLA matrix with the incorporation of RH, was synthesized. RH 
FIGURE 9.7 The chemical structure of polyhydroxybutyrate (Copyrights reserved, 
5312661236994).174 Polyester-Based Biocomposites
underwent chemical modifications in order to improve the compatibility with the 
PLA/PBS matrix. RH increased impact strength and elongation-at-break. The study 
revealed the fact that RH is one of the effective fillers needed to improve properties 
of PLA/PBA composites (Sirichalarmkul and Kaewpirom, 2021). PLA grafted with 
maleic anhydride-grafted (PLA-g-MAH) was blended with RH. Methylenediphenyl 
diisocyanate was utilized as the compatibilizing agent in order to increase the com￾patibility between the RH filler and the PLA-g-MAH matrix. The results showed 
that PLA-g-MAH/RH composites positively influenced the thermal characteristics 
and tensile strength (Tsou et al., 2014). The RH and cellulose fibres in PLA matrix 
enhanced the composite stiffness, flexural modulus and crystallization kinetics 
(Běhálek et al., 2020).
9.5.6 Poly(Butylene Adipate-Co-Terephthalate) 
and Polybutylene Succinate
Poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT) is otherwise known as polybutyr￾ate or polybutyrate-adipate-terephthalate; it is a biodegradable, semi aromatic and 
thermoplastic copolyester (Azevedo et al., 2022). PBAT has many appealing charac￾teristics, similar to PE. PBAT, PBS or polytetramethylene succinate is an aliphatic 
polyester and biodegradable in nature. PBS has similar characteristics to PP. The 
scope of PBS industrial application is still growing, and it is envisaged that in future, 
it will be a suitable alternative candidate to non-degradable plastics (Siracusa et al., 
2015). The structures of PBAT and PBS are presented in Figure 9.9.
This work presents the fabrication of RH in polyester matrices of PBAT and PBS 
in order to obtain better mechanical characteristics. The main challenge in this work 
is the incorporation of the RH, considering its hydrophilic nature, into the PBS/
FIGURE 9.8 The chemical structure of polylactic acid (Copyrights reserved, 5312660197616).Polyester-Based Composites Reinforced with Rice Husk Fillers 175
PBAT matrices. This issue was addressed by adding calcium stearate and glycerol 
as plasticizers. The maleic anhydride and DCP components were utilized to elevate 
the miscibility between hydrophilic the RH filler and the hydrophobic PBS/PBAT 
matrices. The PBAT/PBS/TPRH (Thermo Plastic Rice Husk) composites possessed 
desirable elongation-at-break, tensile strength and modulus of 12.99%, 14.27MPa 
and 200.43MPa, respectively. This composite was found suitable for the production 
of straw, lunchbox and tray. In addition, this composite exemplified good biodegrad￾ability (Yap et al., 2020).
9.5.7 Polycaprolactone
Polycaprolactone (PCL) is a polyester with biodegradable nature, and it has been 
approved by the Food and Drug Administration for application in drug delivery and 
biomedical devices. PCL is also used for filament fabrications of 3D printer (Peña 
et al., 2016). The structure of PCL is illustrated in Figure 9.10.
PCL/RHP composites were prepared, specifically, for increase in the perfor￾mance of electronic components. The study showed that RHP (%) helps to improve 
the hardness of composites. In contrast, elongation-at-break, tensile, hardness and 
flexural strength were affected. However, increase in the RHP particle size decreased 
the impact strength and increased the tensile strength. In addition, the efficiency of 
the shielding effectiveness increases with increase in the RHP filler and the dielectric 
characteristics of the composites increased with decreasing RH particle size. The 
study concluded that the PCL/RHP composites are more appropriate for a small 
shielding application in telecommunication and military devices (Yakubu, Abbas 
FIGURE 9.9 The chemical structure of (a) poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) and (b) 
polybutylene succinate.176 Polyester-Based Biocomposites
and Abdullahi, 2020). Novel e-composites, synthesized based on biodegradable PCL 
and RH, have been prepared. The findings of the study concluded that RH enhanced 
the biodegradability of e-composites (Zhao et al., 2008).
9.6 CONCLUSION
Rice is one of the major food sources throughout the world. As a result, millions 
of tons of RH are produced annually, during the milling process of rice. In recent 
years, RH-reinforced polyester composites have gained attention due to its numerous 
advantageous effects. RH-reinforced composites have been used in many industrial 
applications, such as the construction, automobile, biomedical, aircraft and textile 
industries. There is a wide range of investigations that have explored the efficiency of 
RH in polymer matrices. However, only few studies focused on the RH-filled polyes￾ter matrices. Besides, these RH-filled polyester composites are destined to discover 
many applications in the near future. The extent of RH–polyester interaction deter￾mines the properties of final composite; therefore, most of the studies have empha￾sized the use of compatibilizer, coupling agent and grafter polyester. The chemical 
and physical treatments are the primary choices, required to enhance the interfacial 
interaction between RH and the polyester matrix. Along with this, polyester blend 
could be used to improve the characteristics of RH composites.
In addition to this, RH mixed with other natural fibres, such as hemp and coconut 
coir as hybrid fillers, silica and cellulose, obtained from rice husk, have also been inves￾tigated by many researchers in order to improve the properties of the polyester matri￾ces. This chapter has briefly discussed the RH-reinforced polyester matrices. Hence, 
it is envisaged that a better understanding on the use of RH-reinforced for different 
polyester matrices would provide novel insights into many industrial applications.

10.1 INTRODUCTION
Plastics are manufactured by using non-biodegradable polymers, such as polyeth￾ene, poly(vinyl chloride), polypropylene, poly(ethylene terephthalate), polycarbon￾ate resin, phenolic resin and polystyrene. Being non-biodegradable, these polymers 
persist in the surrounding nature for years, far beyond their end dates, leaving a 
significant plastic garbage collection in the environment and see beds. Plastics are 
released into the environment via dumping, landfilling, consumption by animals and 
incineration. The consumption of plastics by the marine species is considered a big 
problem since the ocean is the largest sink or dumping site for polymeric wastes. 
Bio-magnification causes the mortality of fishes, birds, reptiles and other endangered 
species. The incineration of plastics releases CO2 that significantly contributes to

global warming and endangers human health. Due to their versatility, plastics usage 
is difficult to scale down, although biodegradable polymers may help (Alothman 
et al., 2020; Chandrasekar et al., 2020).
Plastics that degrade via metabolism in the presence of naturally existing organ￾isms are known as biodegradable plastics. Biodegradable plastics are a class of 
polymeric materials that may be broken down, enzymatically, into smaller pieces 
over time. Biodegradation results in the fragmentation or disintegration of plastics 
under the right circumstances of moisture, temperature and the availability of oxy￾gen (Chandrasekar, Senthilkumar, Jawaid, Alamery et al., 2022a,b; Chandrasekar, 
Senthilkumar, Jawaid, Mahmoud, et al., 2022a,b). This process leaves no toxic or 
ecologically detrimental residue. Biodegradable polymers or biopolymers are the 
most promising alternatives to replace plastics that are derived from petroleum. 
According to the Association of European Bioplastics, biopolymers are considered 
to be derived from renewable resources and are completely degradable. However, the 
term “biodegradation” essentially refers to the breakdown of substances by enzy￾matic activity. Biodegradable natural polymers, extracted from renewable natural 
resources, such as chitosan, polylactic acid, starch, pectin, cellulose derivatives or 
polycaprolactone (PCL), are gradually replacing synthetic plastics, which are derived 
from petroleum, for the production of bioplastics and used in packaging applications. 
This substitution occurs most frequently in the production of bioplastics (Nasimudeen 
et al., 2021; Senthilkumar et al., 2015, 2021, 2022). Numerous research organizations 
have devoted their attention to the potential of replacing synthetic polymers, gener￾ated from petroleum, with biodegradable materials that are natural, plentiful and 
relatively inexpensive and that are acquired from renewable sources. The sources of 
these materials determine their (biodegradable polymers) classifications:
1. Biomass-derived polymers (i.e., all types of polysaccharides, various pro￾teins, polypeptides and polynucleotides);
2. Chemically synthesized polymeric materials that employ bio-based mono￾mers, petroleum-derived (i.e., polylactic acid or bio-polyester);
3. Microorganism- or GMO (Genetically Modified Organism)-developed 
polymers (polyhydroxybutyrate, bacterial cellulose [BC], xanthan gum, 
pullan).
There are three challenges that are related to biodegradable polymers: performance, 
processing and cost. Despite the fact that these factors are related, in part to one 
another, efficiency and manufacturing concerns are same for all biodegradable poly￾mers, independent of their origin. Nanotechnology may improve these polymers’ 
characteristics and cost–performance ratio. Dispersed nanoparticles provide nano￾composites with better mechanical, thermal, barrier and physicochemical charac￾teristics compared to the neat polymers and the traditional (microscale) composites.
Over the last several years, the phrase “bio-nano composites” has emerged as a 
popular one. A new class of nanostructured hybrid materials, known as bio-nano￾composites, is now coming into being. Composite is said to be a “nanocomposite”, 
if at least one phase has dimensions smaller than 1 nm (10–9m). There are a number 
of advantages to using nanocomposite materials in place of microcomposites and Polyester-Based Bio-Nanocomposites 185
monolithics; however, the nanocluster phase presents unique preparation issues, per￾taining to the management of the chemical composition of the composite as well as 
its stoichiometry. From the standpoint of holding the design originality and the dif￾ferent properties that are not present in the ordinary composites, they are believed to 
be the materials of the twenty-first century. The “critical size” has been proposed as 
a threshold below which changes in the particle characteristics may be conspicuously 
observed. Additionally, when dimensions reduce to the nanoscale range, the interac￾tions at the phase interfaces increase dramatically, which is critical for improving the 
characteristics of the materials in question. The understanding of the link between 
nanocomposites’ structures and properties hinges on the surface area-to-volume ratio 
of reinforcing materials used in its development.
Nanoparticles have at least one dimension that is on the nanoscale, and their inclu￾sion in bio-based polymer matrices produces natural polymers and inorganic solids 
that are combined. In a manner similar to that of traditional nanocomposites, which 
are composed of synthetic polymers, these biodegradable hybrid composites also 
have enhanced morphological and functional features that are of considerable signifi￾cance for several applications. Because of the amazing capabilities that they carry, 
bio-nanocomposites are becoming more common in the modern world. Researchers 
have learned to identify proper matrices (such as synthetic fibre, polypeptides and 
proteins (such as gluten, casein, lecithin), polysaccharides (such as starch, chitosan, 
pectin, cellulose) and polynucleic acids and fillers (such as cellulose nanocrystals, 
chitosan nanocrystals, pectin nanocrystals, nanotubes, nanofibre varieties, clay 
nanoparticles, hydroxyapatite and metal nanoparticles, e.g., silver nanoparticles) and 
reconfigure their chemical properties and framework to fit the target field.

10.2 OVERVIEW OF BIODEGRADABLE POLYESTERS
10.2.1 Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)
The term “water-soluble synthetic polymers” refers to human-made polymers that 
have natural, semi-synthetic or synthetic origins and that have the ability to be dis￾solved, distributed and inflated when exposed to water. In addition to being harm￾less and odourless, PVA is biocompatible and biodegradable. It also has desirable 
mechanical characteristics and good chemical resistance, but it has limited barrier 
and thermal properties and is rather expensive. Its merits, however, include good 
chemical resistance and excellent mechanical qualities. PVA is readily accessible in 
different forms, including fibre, powder and film, and it does not need the addition of 
co-monomers. PVA is a semicrystalline polymer that is mostly composed of amor￾phous phases and has just a trace amount of crystallinity (Rescignano et al., 2022). 
Depending on the degree of hydrolysis of PVA, it may either be composed of 1 or 
3-diol units (vinyl acetate). Molecular weight and hydrolysis increase the mechani￾cal characteristics, but its flexibility and water sensitivity decrease. PVA is one of 
the most hydrophilic polymers with high moisture sensitivity, making it perfect for 
packaging.
In 1924, the saponification technique of poly(vinyl acetate), abbreviated as PVAc, 
was used to synthesis PVA for the very first time. PVA cannot be produced by using 
the direct polymerization of PVAc monomer. Therefore, Herrmann and Haehnel 
synthesized PVA in 1924, by initially combining, at ambient temperature, ethanol 
solutions containing potassium hydroxyl and polyvinyl acetate; these solutions were 
then heated in the presence of hydraulic acid for between 1 and 2hours in order to 
form PVA (Alghunaim et al., 2016). The reaction routes for the synthesis of PVA are 
shown in the chemical equations below:
Alcoholysis of polyvinyl acetate is described in Reaction A. The production of 
methyl acetate is accomplished in Reaction C, whereas the saponification of polyvi￾nyl acetate is represented in Reaction B.Polyester-Based Bio-Nanocomposites 187
Industries use acetylene or ethylene as basic materials in the presence of acetic 
acid and/or oxygen, to produce vinyl acetate. This process requires the major pres￾ence of both of these elements. After that, the purified vinyl acetate is brought into 
contact with a solution containing methanol and heat is applied in order to com￾mence the polymerization process. During the polymerization process, more than 
70% of the monomers are typically transformed into polyvinyl acetate. This is 
done in order to make PVA go through the saponification process. In the presence 
of sodium hydroxide or anhydrous sodium methylate, the ester groups of polyvi￾nyl acetate are partly or totally replaced by hydroxyl groups during the hydrolysis 
process. The degree of hydrolysis is usually adjusted by the concentration of the 
catalyst and the hydrolysis temperature. When compared to other biodegradable 
polymers, PVA may be synthesized easily, from the suspension and water and 
from the melt by extrusion or injection moulding at a reduced cost. Casting from 
a water solution, injection moulding and blast extrusion are all viable methods for 
producing PVA films for packaging applications, despite the heat sensitivity of the 
material. The use of plasticizers as well as lubricants is a potential strategy for 
overcoming this major problem. Plasticizers may lower the melting temperature 
and viscosity of PVA in order to prevent thermal deterioration during the extru￾sion process.
10.2.2 Polylactide (PLA)
PLA, a polymer derived from lactic acid (2-hydroxy propionic acid), has been inten￾sively investigated for its therapeutic uses, owing to its bioresorbable and biocompat￾ible properties in the human body. Due to its high cost, PLA was first used primarily 
for high-value films, stiff thermoforms, food and beverage containers and coating 
papers (Yang et al., 2016). As contemporary and upcoming manufacturing methods 
may reduce the cost of producing PLA, they may be used for packaging a wider 
variety of items. Furthermore, the production of PLA has numerous advantages, 
including the fact that it can be made from corn, which is in abundance, and it is 
a renewable agricultural resource, carbon-neutral, and recyclable and compostable. 
Moreover, its physical and mechanical properties can be exploited through appropri￾ate polymer design. There are several uses for the polymer PLA, including contain￾ers, ice cream and sundae cups, as well as lamination and overwrap films and blister 
packs for short-lived items. Furthermore, thermoformed PLA containers for fresh 
fruits and vegetables are already being utilized in retail shops.
Lactic acid, the integral element of PLA, is usually synthesized by the fermen￾tation of carbohydrates or chemical synthesis. The vast majority of lactic acid is 
produced by the bacterial fermentation of carbohydrates. Lactic acid production pro￾cesses may be categorized depending on the type of bacteria utilized in the fermenta￾tion. It is estimated that the hetero-fermentative process yields less than one mole of 
lactic acid for every eighteen moles of hexose consumed, with significant quantities 
of other acids and alcohols, carbon dioxide and other waste products produced dur￾ing the process. An average of 1.8 moles of lactic acid per mole of hexose is produced 
by the homo-fermentative method, which also generates trace quantities of other 
metabolites. Homo-fermentative processes are preferred by the industrial sector 188 Polyester-Based Biocomposites
because they produce more lactic acid and produce fewer by-products. Nowadays, 
Lactococcus is used in the vast majority of fermentation activities because of its 
ability to create a considerable quantity of lactic acid. Homo-fermentative bacteria 
need a pH of between 5.4 and 6.4, a temperature of between 38 and 42.8°C and a 
low oxygen level for digestion. In most circumstances, simple sugars are employed 
as a source of energy. Sucrose comes from sugar beets or sugarcane. Other examples 
include corn- and potato-derived glucose and maltose and cheese-derived lactose. 
Besides carbohydrates, corn steep liquor is a rich source of B vitamins, amino acids 
and nucleotides.
PLA with high molecular weight may be produced by a variety of methods. The 
chemical synthesis method is one that can be employed to manufacture huge amounts 
of racemic lactic acid; however, this method is not commercially feasible. As a direct 
result of this, the use of fermentation as a method for the generation of L-lactic acid 
is gaining popularity. In order to manufacture PLA with a high molecular mass, one 
may often choose between three different production methods: (1) polymerization by 
means of direct condensation, (2) polymerization by means of azeotropic dehydrative 
condensation and (3) polymerization by use of lactide formation.
PLA is primarily produced via polymerization through lactide production. 
Polymerization by direct condensation is the cheapest method. However, it is very 
difficult to create a solvent-free poly(lactic acid) with high molecular weight. This 
procedure becomes more expensive and more difficult since chain coupling agents 
and adjuvants are used. Lactic acid may be converted into high-molecular-weight 
poly(lactic acid) via an azeotropic dehydrative condensation without the need for 
adjuvants or chain extenders. In general, the process entails the lowering of the dis￾tillation pressure of lactic acid for 2–3hours at a temperature of 130°C. After that, 
the great majority of the water that had condensed is drained. In addition to the 
diphenyl ester, a catalyst is also added. After the solvent has been passed through the 
molecular sieves and back into the reaction vessel for a further 30–40 hours at 130°C, 
the tube containing the molecular sieves is then linked to the reaction vessel. At this 
point, the polymer may either be left in its natural state or dissolved and precipitated 
for further purification.
10.2.3 Polycaprolactone (PCL)
Polycaprolactone is a biodegradable polyester used in wound dressings, contracep￾tives, fastening machinery and drug passage systems. PCL is used to deliver drugs, 
amino acids, peptides, vaccinations and other bioactive compounds. A monomer and 
an initiator are the two major components for the polymerization of PCL. The mono￾mer and the initiator are combined at high temperatures under a purging nitrogen gas 
in order to create the polymer. After cooling, dissolving in an organic solvent and 
washing are done and the unreacted molecules are removed from the polymer. The 
freeze-dried polymer is used to make nanoparticles, microparticles and scaffolds. 
The PCL’s Tg is 213 K and Tm is between 332K and 337K, depending on its crystal￾linity. Its low melting point facilitates its mixing with other polymers. Chemically, 
PCL is formed of hexanoate repeating units with the formula (C6H10O2)n. It is also 
called 2-oxepanone homopolymer or 6-caprolactone polymer (Espinoza et al., 2019).Polyester-Based Bio-Nanocomposites 189
It is possible to copolymerize PCL in order to alter its physiological, biochemi￾cal and mechanical behaviours. PCL copolymerization influences its crystallinity, 
dissolution, breakdown pattern and permeability, resulting in customized polymers 
for drug delivery. PCL may be produced by using either the polycondensation of 
6-hydroxyhexanoic acid or the ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of ε-caprolactone. 
Polycondensation is a method for the production of polymers that involves the sequen￾tial development of condensation processes. Two molecules that possess functional 
groups that are complementary to one another, react, which enables the formation of 
the polymeric chain, while simultaneously releasing the by-products that have low 
molecular weight. An esterification reaction takes place during the PCL synthesis 
via polycondensation reaction. This reaction takes place either between the acidic 
function of 6-hydroxyhexanoic acid or the growing polymeric chain and the hydroxyl 
functional group of another molecule of 6-hydroxyhexanoic acid. This results in the 
formation of PCL. Throughout the course of the process, one water molecule is pro￾duced as a by-product. During the synthesis process, the elimination of water shifts 
the equilibrium of the reaction in a direction that favours the creation of the polymer. 
The production of PCL by polycondensation has been established either through the 
use of Candida antartica-derived lipases or that derived from Pseudomonas sp. or 
through the complete elimination of the need for a catalyst. In spite of the fact that 
polycondensation is used in the production of a number of aliphatic polyesters, the 
production of PCL via the use of this technique is quite uncommon. On the other 
hand, the ROP synthesis process has been proposed as a superior alternative to the 
PCL synthesis process since it makes it possible to develop polymers with higher 
molecular weights and lower polydispersity values.
The ROP process may be carried out in either bulk or solution and involves the 
cyclic monomeric addition to the structure of a polymeric chain that already has a 
propagating centre. This depends on the steric concerns rather than the conversion 
of multiple bonds into a single bond. When it comes to ROP, the microstructure of 
the products is significantly impacted by both the starting monomer content and the 
temperature.
10.2.4 Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB)
Poly-β-hydroxy alkanoates, often known as PHA, are thermoplastics that are bio￾compatible and biodegradable, and they have recently attracted considerable interest 
as a result of their prospective application areas (Policastro et al., 2021). Generally, 
PHBs (poly-hydroxybutyrate) are considered as one of the well-known biodegradable 
polymers under the common PHA (Poly-hydroxy alkanoates) group. PHB is a natu￾rally occurring thermoplastic polyester that has many mechanical attributes similar 
to the synthetically manufactured degradable polyesters, e.g., poly-L-lactides. PHB 
is a highly crystalline thermoplastic with low water vapour permeability, similar to 
LDPE (Low Density Poly Ethylene). PHB homopolymer’s undesirable ageing pro￾cess is its biggest commercial downside. As an intracellular reserve material, PHB 
has been synthesized via bacterial fermentation in the presence of a broad range of 
microorganisms. The intracellular granules of PHB have been found in, at least, 75 
distinct bacterium species. Despite the fact that this polymer can only be formed 190 Polyester-Based Biocomposites
under highly constrained culture conditions, studies on its synthesis have focused on 
bacteria from Alcaligenes, Azotobacter, Bacillus and Pseudomonas genera. Some 
bacteria may develop up to 80% of their body weight in PHB under conditions of 
restricted nitrogen and ample carbon. In order to produce PHB, Alcaligenes eutro￾phus is the most often employed organism because it is easy to culture, can accumu￾late significant quantities of PHB (up to 80% of dry cell weight on a simple medium) 
and its physiology and biochemistry are well characterized. Various microorganisms 
(bacteria, fungus and algae) break down PHB films into a variety of habitats. The 
enzymes secreted by microbes when they come into contact with the polymer break 
it down into smaller pieces, thereby lowering its average molecular weight. PHB has 
been utilized as packaging materials and tiny disposable items. However, very little 
is known regarding the use of PHB in food packaging. The food packaging indus￾try has difficulty in its attempts to manufacture biodegradable primary packaging 
by balancing the product shelf life with the packaging durability. Stability in the 
mechanical and/or barrier integrities, as well as the functionality, is essential for 
biological packing materials. Throughout the storage period, the circumstances that 
promote biodegradation must be avoided, whereas optimal conditions for biodegra￾dation must exist after discarding the food product.
10.3 POLYESTER-BASED HYBRID BIOCOMPOSITES
10.3.1 Polyester and Nanocellulose-Based Hybrids
Nanocelluloses have significant promise since cellulose is the most prevalent bio￾logical raw material and can self-assemble into well-defined designs from micro- to 
nanoscale. Cellulose is renewable and versatile, and it is predicted to replace numer￾ous non-renewable materials. Over the past several decades, the creation of cellulose 
nanofibres (CNFs) has garnered a lot of attention because of its unique properties 
such as high surface area-to-volume proportion, high specific surface area, high elas￾tic modulus, high tensile strength and low coefficient of thermal expansion. CNFs are 
isolated from algae, tunicates and BC, although plant cell walls are their principal 
sources. Numerous researchers have investigated the extraction of nanofibres from 
natural plant cellulose fibres due to their regenerative, abundance and low-cost char￾acteristics. Ultra-pure CNFs have been isolated from several plant sources, including 
wood derivatives (Abe et al. 2007). Different parts of bamboo (Abe and Yano 2010), 
unused soy hulls (Alemdar and Sain 2008) and the remains of pineapple leaf fibres 
are good sources for CNC (Cellulose Nano Crystals) generation (Cherian et al. 2010. 
The extraction methods include cryo-crushing (Chakraborty et al. 2005), grind￾ing (Abe et al. 2007), high-pressure homogenization (Herrick et al., 1983) and acid 
hydrolysis (Araki et al., 2000). Depending on the cellulose sources, its preliminary 
treatment, and the hydrolysis process, various approaches can be employed to pro￾duce distinct nano-fibrillar materials. CNF is used as a nanofiller for various biode￾gradable polyesters such as PVA and PLA. This is because polyester alone has many 
limitations of its own. PLA, being highly biocompatible and biodegradable, has few 
drawbacks such as high production cost, brittleness, low mechanical strength and 
poor thermal stability, when used in packaging applications. Fillers, such as cellulose Polyester-Based Bio-Nanocomposites 191
or cellulose derivatives, which are renewable and biodegradable, might increase the 
mechanical and thermal properties and improve the cost–performance ratio. It is 
becoming more popular to employ natural fibres in polymer composites, instead of 
synthetic fibres, e.g., glass. This is because of their availability, renewability, high 
stiffness and non-abrasiveness to processing equipment, as well as the capability to 
be incinerated, lightweight and reduced cost (Shahroze et al., 2021; Thomas et al., 
2021). In this regard, CNFs have been used to reinforce various polymeric matri￾ces, including starch (Wang et al., 2009), PVA (Lee et al., 2009) and polylactic acid 
(Dobreva et al., 2010).
Cellulose nanocrystals, due to their distinctive structural qualities and impressive 
physicochemical properties, such as compatibility, biodegradability, compostabil￾ity, lightweight, adaptive surface composition, optical transmittance and improved 
mechanical properties and tensile strength, have attracted considerable interest 
from both the industries and the academia (Frone et al., 2013). This nanomaterial 
is a prospective contender for use in biomedical, pharmaceutical, electrical, barrier 
film, nanocomposites and membrane and supercapacitor applications, among oth￾ers. In order to meet the rising demand for the production of new kinds of cellulose 
nanocrystals-based products on an industrial scale, new sources, isolation methods 
and various other treatments are constantly being developed. CNCs are nanomet￾ric or rod-like particles that have a needle-like configuration and have at least one 
dimension that is less than 100 nm. They have a very high crystalline structure. 
They may be made from a wide variety of plant-based materials, including wood 
pulp, BC, algal cellulose, bast fibres, cotton linters, microcrystalline cellulose and 
tunicin. These nanocrystals have attractive combinations of bio-physicochemical 
properties, such as compatibility, biodegradability, compact size, non-toxic nature, 
stuffiness, recyclability and sustainability. They also have absorptivity, heat resis￾tance, gas barrier properties, adaptable surface composition and improved mechani￾cal properties. These nanocrystals may also replace certain goods that are based 
on petrochemicals, and they are more cost-effective than some comparative high￾performance nanomaterials. Strong acids, e.g., sulfuric and hydrochloric acid, are 
used in the process of acid hydrolysis, which is one of the most common methods 
for synthesizing CNCs from a wide variety of starting materials that are based on 
cellulose. In more recent times, the production of CNCs has also made use of a 
variety of different mineral and organic acids. Several alternative methods of prepa￾ration, such as enzymatic hydrolysis, mechanical refining, ionic liquid treatment, 
subcritical water hydrolysis, the oxidation technique and combination procedures, 
have also been developed. During the synthesis process, cellulose chains are joined, 
largely into fascicular microfibrils. Due to the kinetic considerations and the lower 
steric hindrance, amorphous domains disperse as chain dislocations on segments 
of the elementary fibril that are more accessible to acid and more prone to hydro￾lytic action, while the crystalline domains have a stronger resistance to acid assault. 
Consequently, CNCs may be generated by removing the amorphous areas from 
microfibrils. When compared to nanofillers made of minerals or metals that are 
commercially accessible, cellulose nanocrystals are manufactured from numerous 
feedstocks; they have low densities, their prices are comparatively inexpensive and 
they do not compromise biodegradability.192 Polyester-Based Biocomposites
As a result of these benefits, CNCs are now undergoing intensive research in order 
to determine whether or not they are ideal fillers for the mechanical reinforcement 
of a polymer matrix. Because of their nanoscale size and high inherent rigidity, they 
are very desirable for the purpose of improving the stiffness of polymer composites. 
A percolating CN network will cause gas molecules to follow a convoluted route in 
order for them to pass through the polymer film, which will result in the layer acting 
as a barrier. The enhancement in the permeability property of a PVA membrane was 
established by Paralikar et al. (2008), who observed a decrease in the transmission 
of water vapour and organic vapour (i.e., trichloroethylene) with a 10% loading of 
cotton CNC in comparison to the plain (neat) polymer. Additionally, they recorded 
a reduction in the transmission of trichloroethylene. In research conducted by 
Suryanegara, Nakagaito and Yano (2009), differential scanning calorimetry studies 
and dynamic mechanical analysis were conducted to shed light on the use of micro￾fibrillated cellulose (MFC) as fillers that might expand the application range of PLA 
to high temperature-exposed products. In this study, the effect of MFC on polylac￾tic acid’s (PLA) thermal and mechanical properties was investigated (Suryanegara, 
Nakagaito & Yano, 2009). It was also shown that PLA’s tensile characteristics were 
improved when 20wt.% MFC was added, compared to the PLA that had no MFC 
inclusion (Yano et al., 2009).
10.3.2 Carbon-Based Polyester Bio-Nanocomposites
10.3.2.1 Graphene
Graphene, a two-dimensional carbon sheet, has a thickness of one atom and is one 
of the lightest substances in the universe, and it has sparked a great deal of curiosity 
in physics, materials engineering, chemistry and biology (Chang et al., 2013). The 
superior mechanical characteristics of graphene, including its high Young’s modu￾lus, tensile strength and its heat conduction capability, are also advantageous for a 
variety of graphene applications. Despite the fact that graphene sheets were first 
studied, primarily in basic physics, graphene nanocomposites and their hybrids are 
garnering an increasing number of real-world applications. By incorporating con￾trolled functional building blocks into graphene, the current emphasis on graphene 
as a generic substrate for nanocomposites has spawned several energy and envi￾ronmental applications. In order to have increases in the characteristics of polymer 
nanocomposites, it is necessary to have uniform dispersion of nanofiller throughout 
the polymer matrix and to ensure that there are no agglomerates present. The char￾acteristic analysis of polymer nanocomposites is significantly connected to their 
microstructures. During the reduction process, a greater repulsion was observed for 
graphene oxide (GO) sheets towards the water, and it has a propensity to quickly 
agglomerate into flakes of single-layered sheets, which then stack up to produce 
graphite and eventually precipitate. The in situ reduction of GO that is disseminated 
in a polymer matrix, is one of the most successful routes that can be employed to 
create stable graphene dispersions. The in situ intercalative polymerizations, solu￾tion intercalation and melt intercalation methods are the primary approaches that 
are used during the creation of polymer/graphene nanocomposites. The solution Polyester-Based Bio-Nanocomposites 193
casting approach is the simplest method and in comparison, to the melt mixing 
method, it is more effective to obtain excellent dispersion of the graphene through￾out the polymer matrix.
The incorporation of graphene and its derivatives into PVA has the potential to 
bring about significant improvements in the material’s characteristics and to expand 
the range of applications for which it may be deplored. PVA nanocomposites have 
been prepared by using a wide variety of graphene derivatives and reports have shown 
that these preparations result in an improvement in the bulk physical characteristics.
10.3.2.2 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs)
The structural, mechanical and electrical characteristics of CNTs (multiwalled car￾bon nanotubes, MWNTs, and single-wall carbon nanotubes, SWNTs), as well as 
the prospective technological uses of these nanotubes, have sparked a great deal of 
research. As a result, the production of composite materials by incorporating CNTs 
has piqued a lot of scientific interest, whether for the understanding of their physical 
and chemical characteristics or for the development of new usages. Improved electri￾cal, mechanical and thermal characteristics have been achieved by the incorporation 
of CNTs into diverse matrices (Gan et al., 2020). The complexes resulting from the 
combination of polymeric nanomaterials with appropriate nanofillers, such as CNTs, 
are beneficial for the design of ultra-high-energy devices, such as battery cells, fuel 
cells and display systems, due to their ease of fabrication into thin films of desir￾able dimensions. This is one reason why polymeric nanomaterials are of particular 
interest. It is possible for CNTs to have a significant impact on the characteristics of 
polymers if they are incorporated into the matrix of the polymeric material. The char￾acteristics of the polymer matrix are significantly enhanced when just a trace amount 
of CNTs is included in the formulation. Therefore, CNT/polymer composites make 
use of the remarkable qualities of the CNTs along with the characteristic property of 
the polymeric matrix. According to the findings of certain investigations, the char￾acteristics of polymer and CNT nanocomposites are significantly improved. It was 
discovered by scientist Dalton that fibres synthesized with PVA and the addition of 
a high proportion of CNTs resulted in the development of a film, which had a tensile 
strength and toughness far greater when compared to that of Kevlar or even spider 
silk. In addition, in comparison to pure PVA films, PVA composite films that include 
poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) and completely dispersed CNTs demonstrate enhanced ten￾sile strength and modulus. Experiments carried out recently on PVA combined with 
CNTs and subjected to non-isothermal crystallization procedure have shown that 
nanotubes are capable of increasing the crystallinity of the mixture. It is critical to 
choose the right CNTs when producing nanocomposites containing CNTs in order 
to obtain the most reinforcement. Due to their high modulus and compact size, high￾quality SWNTs are typically considered the best choice. Arc-discharged CNT, on 
the other hand, is often regarded as superior to chemical vapour deposition CNT. 
The mechanical characteristics of pure PVA composites containing various types of 
nanotubes have been studied by Cadek et al. (2004) and Coleman et al. (2004), who 
revealed that the reinforcement increased with the inverse of the nanotube diameter 
for MWNTs, whereas SWNTs showed very weak reinforcement, which was due to 
uneven bundle formation.194 Polyester-Based Biocomposites
10.3.3 Polyester-Based Active Biocomposite Films
Active packaging film for food is a growing alternative to the common procedures, 
such as the addition of antioxidants or essential oils or nanoparticles directly in food 
samples in combination with a vacuum or modified atmosphere for the protection of 
sensitive foods from oxidation (Chen et al., 2021). In most cases, the foundation for 
these systems is made up of materials in which certain additives, exhibiting antioxi￾dant and antibacterial capabilities, have been directly incorporated into the polymer 
matrix. These additives have the potential to serve two purposes: firstly, they may 
prevent oxidation of fat and colour components in foods by controlling how quickly 
they are released, and secondly, they can shield polymers from damage caused during 
processing. Nanotechnology-enhanced materials for packaging have the potential to 
function through two distinct modes of action. The first advantage is an improvement 
in packaging. A high interfacial area between the polymer matrix and the nanofill￾ers is achieved due to the uniform distribution of nanofillers. Structural, thermody￾namic and barrier characteristics of the matrix are enhanced due to the presence of 
this interfacial region. The second technique is called the active packaging and it 
offers improved food safety by virtue of the nanofillers’ direct interaction with the 
food that is packaged and with the environment in which it is stored. It is possible 
to increase the functional qualities of polyester-based bio-nanocomposite films by 
using a wide range of naturally occurring bioactive substances. In particular, there 
has been an increased emphasis on components that may prevent the deterioration of 
foods, owing to the antioxidant and antibacterial qualities that they possess. There 
has already been a lot of research done on the topic of inclusion of natural bioac￾tive compounds, including polyphenols, essential oils, curcumin and carotenoids into 
edible films for food packaging purposes. The antioxidant, antibacterial, colouring, 
flavouring and/or nutritional properties of these components are often put to use in 
a variety of recipes. It is important to note that the insertion of these active compo￾nents has the potential to have an effect, not only on the structural organization of 
the films, but also on their functional qualities. For example, when added to bio￾nanocomposite films, essential oils not only have an antioxidant and antimicrobial 
impacts, but also change the films’ mechanical and barrier qualities. Before the film 
is formed, the active components are often simply combined with the materials that 
will be used to produce the film. In certain circumstances, the active substances have 
to be enclosed inside colloidal particles first, before they can be combined with the 
components that are used to produce the film. The technique that is applied is deter￾mined by whether or not the active components are soluble in the solution that forms 
the film. In order to attain the necessary functional qualities, such as an antioxidant 
and an antimicrobial, the films may be supplemented with a single kind of active 
ingredient or with multiple types of active compounds.

are accessible. Active agents/carbon and natural fibres, e.g., cellulose, are often used 
to reinforce composites that are developed using polyesters. In the recent decades, 
the use of natural fibres derived from natural resources has been growing in usage, 
as reinforcement agents, because of their easy availability and rapid degradation due 
to their biodegradable nature. Polyester composites reinforced with natural fibres 
typically have adequate mechanical qualities, including tensile properties, impact 
resistance and elasticity, making them to be appropriate for a variety of applica￾tions. It has been shown that aliphatic polyesters are more biodegradable than other 
types of polymers. Biodegradable composite materials are often made from PLAs, 
PVAs, and PHBs. In addition to being easy to handle, polyester-based biodegradable 
composites have excellent mechanical and functional qualities. Biodegradable poly￾ester-based composite materials first appeared on the market in the medical indus￾try, specifically in the tissue engineering and packaging industries. Its performance 
relies heavily on its biodegradability, mechanical characteristics and piezoelectric 
qualities. Numerous breakthroughs and innovations have occurred in the last sev￾eral decades. The environmental advantages of exploiting renewable resources are a 
major driving force behind the biopolymer industry’s bright future. The biodegrad￾able nanocomposite of the next era will most probably concentrate on producing 
materials with superior material characteristics and other functional properties, as 
well as a significant level of biodegradability. Certainly, the biopolymer industry has 
a very prominent future, which is mainly due to the environmental advantages of 
using renewable resources. Future research studies and experimental development 
of biodegradable nanocomposite materials are envisaged to concentrate completely 
on developing materials with optimal strength and barrier qualities, as well as their 
capability to inhibit pathogenic organisms by providing antimicrobial or antioxidant 
ability. This is shown by the widespread usage of biodegradable composite materials 
in several applications, including the food packaging, pharmaceutical, automobile, 
industrial, construction and cosmetics industries. The relevance and value of biode￾gradable composite materials cannot be emphasized from an ecological standpoint. 
From this perspective, polyester-based biodegradable composites will play a major 
role in the development of emerging products.

Bio-Polyester Composites

11.1 INTRODUCTION
Polyester is a polymer with an ester functional group in every repeating unit of its 
main chain. It is synthetically produced by condensation reactions between dicar￾boxylic acids and diols. The polyester group includes polyhydroxyalkanoates, which 
are produced in nature by numerous microorganisms and also through bacteria fer￾mentation of sugars or lipids, and poly(alkylene dicarboxylates) or also known as 
bio-polyester [1]. Depending on its structure and behavior toward heat, polyester can 
be classified as thermoset and thermoplastic. Examples of thermoplastic polyester 
are polyethylene terephthalate, polyglycolic acid, and polylactic acid, which can eas￾ily be recycled, while thermoset polyester is known as unsaturated polyester resin 
(UPR), which is commonly applied in composite industries and cannot be recycled. 
UPR is extremely versatile in meeting the end-user requirements, which have signifi￾cantly been the driving force in their widespread growth. UPRs can be compounded 
with various types of reinforcement fillers and cured under heat or radiation. The 
wide-ranging chemical and physical properties of UPRs depend upon the selection of 
diacids and diols, cross-linking agents, initiators, and other additives [2]. The major￾ity of UPRs are used in the marine industry, such as in the production of hulls, decks, 
hatch, and engine conveyers; in the construction industry, such as in the production 
of bathroom compartments and fixtures, pipes, tanks, panels, and window frames;

and in the transportation industry, such as in the production of automotive parts and 
structural components [3].
Synthetic and natural fibers-reinforced polyester is the major approach applied in 
composite industry. Besides their biodegradability, natural fibers are much cheaper, 
have a lower density, and have properties that are acceptable compared to synthetic 
fibers [4, 5]. Polyester gives high mechanical properties to the fabricated composites; 
while the associated fibers contribute excellent rigidity, low density, and biodegrad￾ability over polyester, in which this combination provides excellent properties of 
composites [6].
11.2 CONCEPT OF HYBRID POLYMER COMPOSITES
Hybrid polymer composites are not clearly defined in a material category. It is the 
result of the design method that associates the polymer integration in a polymer or 
composite system. It is understood that high-functionality materials are difficult to 
obtain using a single polymer matrix. Thus, hybrid polymer composite is under￾stood as an effective strategy to achieving desired properties by combining more 
than single continuous phase (matrix) and discontinuous phase (reinforcement). In 
some composites, there may be two interpenetrating continuous phases, while in 
others, there needs to be a non-continuous phase or two non-continuous phases in 
a single continuous phase. It should be noted that there are no limits to hybridizing 
polymers and composites.
The common example of hybrid composites is laminated composite, in which two 
or more types of fiber are incorporated in a laminated form. The laminated fibers 
provide enhanced properties in comparison with the corresponding single fiber￾reinforced composite [7]. Currently, increasing sustainability and environmental 
awareness have increased the interest to substitute synthetic fiber with natural fiber 
in engineering applications. However, natural fibers have variability in their charac￾teristic properties; thus, hybridizing two fibers, including natural and natural fibers 
or natural and synthetic fibers, could improve specific performances and reduce the 
weakest aspect of both natural and synthetic fibers [7–9].
A hybrid system could also be designed on the matrix or a continuous system in 
a composite. Bio-based matrices have widely been studied, but their performance 
still could not compete with the synthetic polymer matrix. For example, vegetable oil 
(VO)-based thermoset resins gives various performances depending on the reactivity 
sites such as unsaturation and ester bonds. Lack of aromatic or cycloaliphatic com￾pound in the VO structure resulted in lower stiffness and strength properties of the 
resulting resin [10]. Thus, blending VO partly with synthetic resin could maintain the 
stiffness and strength, and improve the thermal and toughness properties of the resin 
[11, 12]. However, providing higher toughness at higher VO loadings in the blends low￾ers the stiffness performance of the composite [13]. Thus, reinforcement filler is always 
added to the blends system, which provides higher stiffness and therefore results in a 
proper toughness–stiffness balance of the resulting resin [14, 15]. In addition, filler also 
provides improvement in specific properties of composite such as hydrophobic prop￾erties, thermal resistance and fire retardancy. In other words, composites with two or 
more fillers of the same matrix are also called hybrid composites [16].Hybrid Polyester and Bio-Polyester Composites 203
11.3 HYBRID NATURAL FIBERS-REINFORCED 
POLYESTER COMPOSITES
Natural fiber-reinforced polyester composites have widely been applied specifically 
for low technology applications, including structural applications such as building, 
automotive, and sports equipment industry. Natural fibers have attracted more inter￾est than synthetic fibers as it is abundantly available, renewable, and environmentally 
friendly. In addition, natural fiber possesses properties of lightweight, low cost, high 
flexibility, biodegradability, high specific strength, high toughness, and easy process￾ing. Natural fiber is a fiber that is synthesized from natural sources, and can be clas￾sified according to its origin: vegetable fiber from cellulose, wood fiber from a tree, 
animal fiber such as spider silk and silkworm silk, mineral fiber including asbestos 
group, and biological fiber such as fibrous protein and collagen. Different types of 
fiber orientations such as random orientation, unidirectional for continuous or long 
fiber, and bidirectional such as woven fiber reinforcement, have a range of properties. 
Thus, natural fibers of specific type of orientation are selected as the reinforcement 
agent in polyester for a specific composite application [17]. Besides the advantages, 
natural fiber also shows low strength and high-water absorption properties. To meet 
the demand for advanced composite materials with higher mechanical properties, 
recently, there has been a growing interest in hybridizing different types of natu￾ral fibers as reinforcement in a polyester composite. Besides the properties of the 
fiber and matrix, the design of the hybrid system and interfacial adhesion between 
the fiber and matrix significantly affect the properties of the final composite [18]. 
Specific volume and weight percent of fiber are also important in determining the 
optimum behavior of the hybrid natural fiber-reinforced polyester composite.
Dixit and Verma [19] studied the mechanical performance of hybridized dif￾ferent natural fibers such as coir, sisal, and jute reinforced in polyester compos￾ite in sandwich construction using the hand lay-up technique. This study revealed 
that composite with the outer layer of jute and core and sisal in the middle has the 
highest modulus, tensile strength, and flexural strength properties as compared to 
other arrangements. The same fiber construction also provided the lowest water 
absorption after immersion in water for 24 hours. These findings demonstrate that 
the improvement of mechanical properties of polyester composite is highly depen￾dent on the hybridization arrangement. Another study conducted by Shanmugam 
and Thiruchitrambalam [20] proved that the hybridization of fibers provided higher 
thermo-mechanical properties of the polyester composite. It was revealed by the 
increase of static and dynamic mechanical properties of the polyester composite 
when unidirectional continuous palmyra palm leaf stalk hybridized with jute fiber 
was reinforced in the composite. The tensile strength, tensile modulus, storage, and 
loss modulus, and tan d of the continuous unidirectional bi-layer hybrid composite 
improved with increasing jute content with an alkali treatment of fibers.
Athijayamani et al. [21], who studied randomly oriented roselle/sisal (1:1) hybrid 
polyester composite, found that fiber content and lengths significantly affect the 
water absorption and mechanical properties of the composite in dry and wet condi￾tions. Fiber loadings and fiber length have different effects on moisture absorption, 
i.e., higher fiber loadings increase the moisture absorption, while higher fiber length 204 Polyester-Based Biocomposites
gives the opposite effect. In dry condition, increasing hybrid fiber loading and length 
increases the tensile and flexural strength of the hybrid composite. Exposure to mois￾ture (wet condition) degraded the fiber–matrix interface and caused a significant drop 
in the mechanical properties of the composite. In a previous study, Alavudeen et al. 
[22] explored the mechanical properties of banana/kenaf fiber-reinforced hybrid 
polyester composites, and in particular the effect of woven fabric of plain and twill 
type and random orientation. Based on the results, they found that the plain type of 
woven fiber showed higher tensile and flexural strength than the twill-type woven 
fiber and random-orientation fiber. The plain-woven hybrid banana/kenaf compos￾ite showed 54% and 15% higher tensile strength than the pure banana/polyester 
and kenaf/polyester composite, respectively. Moreover, the highest tensile modulus 
and flexural strength properties were also observed. The performance of random￾orientation fiber was lower compared to woven fiber due to non-uniform distribu￾tion of stress transfer in both the longitudinal and transverse directions when tensile 
load is applied. Moreover, the plain type of banana/kenaf woven fiber shows highest 
mechanical performance due to the highest stress transfer when the fibers of greater 
strength (kenaf fiber) are oriented longitudinally which the tensile load could be bear 
along the direction of fiber.
When two types of fibers have the same length but different diameters, they will 
provide a different effective area for the fiber–matrix adhesion, which provides dif￾ferent stress transfer to the composite material [23]. An analysis on thermo-physical 
properties of banana/sisal hybrid fiber-reinforced polyester composite conducted by 
Idicula et al. [24] found that, at a relative 1:1 volume fraction of banana and sisal fiber, 
40% fiber volume fraction (banana/sisal) showed the highest increment in storage 
modulus, tensile modulus, flexural strength, and glass transition temperature of the 
polyester composite. This condition indicates better fiber–matrix interaction at 40% 
fiber volume fractions. They also confirmed that banana/polyester and hybrid fibers/
polyester showed almost the same storage modulus properties, which are higher than 
sisal/polyester composite. The high storage modulus indicates good interface bonding 
for the hybrid fiber with the polyester matrix. Based on the analysis, even though the 
cellulose content of banana and sisal fiber is almost similar, the lumen size, microfi￾brillar angle, and the diameter of banana fiber are smaller, which contributed to higher 
wetting and interactions with the matrix. This phenomenon affected better perfor￾mances of hybridizing banana fiber with other fiber types with higher diameters. The 
same results were found by Venkateshwaran et al. [25] on epoxy banana/sisal-rein￾forced epoxy hybrid composite and Boopalan et al. [26] on hybridizing banana fiber 
in jute/epoxy composites. They proved that hybridizing up to 50wt.% banana fibers 
in sisal/epoxy and jute/epoxy composite, respectively, result in higher mechanical and 
thermal properties and decreased moisture absorption properties.
11.4 HYBRID NATURAL-SYNTHETIC FIBERS￾REINFORCED POLYESTER COMPOSITES
Although natural fibers are cheaper and lighter, they have low mechanical properties 
than synthetic fibers such as glass, aramid, and carbon fiber. The hybridization of 
different types of natural fibers-reinforced polyester composite still could not yield Hybrid Polyester and Bio-Polyester Composites 205
superior mechanical properties. This phenomenon limits the use of natural fibers and 
their hybridization of polyester composites in high-performance technology applica￾tions. However, the cost of synthetic fibers which have higher mechanical properties 
is high, and the higher production cost urges for an alternative approach. Due to this 
issue, hybridization of synthetic with natural fibers, which can reduce the produc￾tion cost while not compromising its performances, is preferable [27]. For instance, 
hybridization of natural fiber with synthetic glass and carbon fiber can also improve 
the stiffness, strength, and moisture-resistant behavior of the natural fiber composite 
[28]. Due to the lower price, glass fibers are typically being selected to be hybridized 
with natural fibers in composite applications. Like natural–natural fibers hybridiza￾tion process, the synthetic–natural fibers hybridization can also be done at different 
orientations and stagnation, loadings, and fiber sizes.
Ahmed and Vijayarangan [29] studied the stacking sequence of untreated woven 
jute and glass fabric-reinforced polyester hybrid composites using the hand lay-up 
technique. At a constant of 10 plies layers, there is a huge improvement in tensile and 
flexural properties of jute composite by the incorporation of glass fiber as extreme 
plies (outer surfaces). Based on the results, the tensile and flexural modulus and 
strength have improved by 30% and 53%, and 62% and 31%, respectively. In another 
study, Ramesh, Palanikumar, and Reddy [27] have proven that orientation and fiber 
selection are important to determine the best mechanical performance of the com￾posite. Based on their study, jute/glass has the highest tensile strength as compared to 
sisal/glass and sisal/jute/glass-reinforced polyester composite at 5 plies of fiber with 
glass fiber as the extreme plies.
Mishra et al. [30] studied the effect of glass/pineapple leaf/sisal fibers in polyester 
composite. Based on their results, the ultimate tensile strength of pineapple leaf fibers 
(PALF)-polyester composite at 25wt.% fiber volume fraction, Vf
, is significantly 
improved by 66% when the PALF is hybridized with 8.5wt.% glass fiber. While for 
sisal-polyester composite at 30wt.% Vf
, the ultimate tensile strength is increased by 
more than 50% when hybrid sisal/glass fiber is used. These results revealed that the 
properties of the composite are mainly dependent on the properties of individual 
reinforcing fiber and specific composition of synthetic-natural fiber hybridization is 
important to provide the ultimate mechanical properties of the composite. Besides 
the mechanical properties, hybridization of PALF/glass fiber also allows significant 
better heat transportability of composite. It can be observed by the 50% increment of 
thermal conductivity, and higher thermal diffusivity in the hybrid PALF/glass fiber 
as compared to PALF reinforced in polyester composite [31]. In a different study by 
Sapuan et al. [32], they found that addition of basalt in woven glass fiber polyester 
composite has improved the density, tensile and flexural strength of polyester com￾posite. Hybridization of 75% basalt fiber with 25% of woven glass fiber-reinforced 
polyester composite showed the highest improvement in tensile strength which is 
more than 50% of woven glass fiber reinforcement composite.
11.5 BIO-BASED POLYESTER RESIN
The polyester resins synthesized directly from natural resources such as lipids, 
protein, polysaccharides, sugar, VOs, and other monomers usually exhibit low 206 Polyester-Based Biocomposites
mechanical and thermal properties, and limit their use in the market. In the litera￾ture, the most reported polyester blending is blending with VO. VO is one of the 
potential materials to replace petroleum-based polymer due to its worldwide avail￾ability and is a major agricultural commodity. Therefore, VOs are a valuable source 
of bio-based polymer resins. VO is composed of various chemical structures and 
compositions, and it can be activated for condensation polymerization by adding a 
curing agent or a latent catalyst [33].
The use of VO in polyester resins has caught the attention of researchers due to 
its apparent toughening effect [34]. This indirectly overcomes the main limitations 
of polyester resin: brittleness and low impact resistance. VO is mainly composed of 
triglycerides and contains various fatty acids. The physical and chemical properties 
of VOs are different from each other, depending on the fatty acid composition and 
whether there are unsaturated or double bonds in the triglyceride chain [35]. VO in 
native form is not reactive. Therefore, several techniques have been used to func￾tionalize VOs to increase their reactivity with polymer resins, such as epoxidation, 
acrylation, maleinization, amidation, and glycerolysis reactions [36].
There are several researchers conducted studies of blending polyester resin with 
VOs such as soybean oil [14, 37, 38], palm oil [9, 39], grapeseed oil [40], and linseed 
oil [41]. In conclusion, the experimental results suggest that the inclusion of VO in 
polyester resin enhanced the toughness properties and elasticity of brittle polyester 
resins [12, 14, 15]. The higher the amount of VO, the higher the ability of the bio￾based resin to absorb the impact energy. This may be due to the long, flexible, and 
elastic network structure of the VO, which improves the mobility of the resulting 
resin and its resistance to cracking and propagation [42].
Liu et al. [43] studied the potential use of tung oil (TO) as a toughening agent in 
UPRs. They observed that the impact strength of the modified system was signifi￾cantly improved with the optimum value of 20% TO content. The impact strength of 
the modified system was significantly improved with a maximum increase of 370% 
compared with that of the unmodified system. Das et al. [44] produced bio-based 
polymer resin by blending UPR and TO. They also concluded that the TO improved 
resin toughness at a very low content of TO.
Liu et al. [45] investigated the mechanical and thermal properties of UPR with 
the addition of castor oil. In their work, they found that the mechanical and thermal 
properties of the unsaturated polyester (UPE) blend were better than those of neat 
UPE. However, the tensile strength and flexural strength values decreased as castor 
oil increased. Therefore, to balance the strength or stiffness and toughness properties 
of bio-based thermoset resin, several researchers reported the addition of nanofiller 
is required.
11.6 NATURAL FIBER-REINFORCED POLYESTER/
VEGETABLE OIL HYBRID COMPOSITE
The development of bio-based polymer composites reinforced with natural fibers also 
known as Fiber Reinforced Polymer (FRP). Indeed, natural fibers are less expensive, 
very abundant, and have good mechanical properties. As a result, its bio-polyester 
resin reinforcement has contributed to the creation of green composite products, Hybrid Polyester and Bio-Polyester Composites 207
offering a promising compromise between respect for the environment and perfor￾mance. The commonly used natural fibers are kenaf, flax, hemp, and sisal fibers. The 
employment of treated natural fibers was reported to give significant improvements 
in tensile strength, flexural strength, Izod impact, and storage modulus of bio-based 
composites.
The development of natural fiber-reinforced bio-based polyester resins was 
reported by a few researchers. One of the studies was conducted by Pfister, D. P. 
and Larock [46], who prepared composites from flaxseed oil-based conjugate resins 
using wheat straw as a reinforcement. They found that increasing the wheat straw 
loading has increased the mechanical properties and increased the thermal proper￾ties of the composite. This composite material is suitable for use in non-structural 
applications such as automotive panels, wall or floor panels, furniture, and residential 
building materials.
Hosur et al. [47], on the other hand, showed that the use of the commercial UPR/
VO-based system exhibit similar properties to the commercial polyester resin. The 
study also showed that introducing a higher concentration of alkali solution up to 
2.5% will increase the degree of crystallinity of the fibers. Liu and co-workers [48] 
have developed green composites from soybean thermoset resin using two differ￾ent processing methods: injection molding and compression molding. The kenaf 
fibers have been used as reinforcement. The effects of different processing methods 
and fiber length on the physical properties of the composites were investigated. It 
was observed that the compression-molded composites showed a similar modulus 
to injection-molded composites. Haq et al. [14] employed natural fibers (industrial 
hemp) as reinforcement in UPE/epoxidized soybean oil (epoxidized methyl soyate 
(EMS)). Their works revealed that the UPE/EMS/hemp fiber composites experience 
improvement in impact strength with the increase in EMS loading.
11.7 HYBRID NATURAL FIBER-REINFORCED 
POLYESTER/VEGETABLE OIL COMPOSITE
More recently, the focus has also been on the development of hybrid composites that 
contain more than one type of reinforcing fiber in a single matrix. Hybrid compos￾ites have properties that cannot be achieved by single-fiber composites. They offer 
more advanced composites with reduced cost, acceptable corrosion resistance, good 
mechanical properties, i.e., flexural modulus, good strength properties, and good 
thermal stability. However, studies on hybrid natural fiber-reinforced bio-based poly￾ester composites are rarely seen in the literature. There is one recent study conducted 
by Mustapha and co-workers [9] on the hybrid kenaf and empty fruit bunch (EFB) 
fibers-reinforced polyester/VO composites. They investigated the effect of different 
weight percentages of hybrid kenaf and EFB compositions and fiber fractions (wt.%) 
on the mechanical and thermal properties of UPE/epoxidized palm oil (EPO) com￾posites. In their findings, they revealed that hybridization of kenaf and EFB fibers 
improved the mechanical properties such as strength, stiffness, and toughness of the 
composites and improved thermal stability. Dramatic improvements were observed 
at lower fibers fractions, i.e., 9 and 12% by weight.208 Polyester-Based Biocomposites
11.8 NANOFILLER-FILLED NATURAL FIBER-REINFORCED 
POLYESTER HYBRID COMPOSITE
As reported earlier, most polymers, including polyester, require fillers to improve 
the properties of the resin. Nanomaterials such as nanoclays, graphene, carbon nano￾tubes, silica, and alumina have been utilized as reinforcing fillers in polymer nano￾composites. Incorporating small amounts of nanofillers into polymer matrices has 
been reported to significantly improve the tensile strength, modulus, and thermal 
stability of composites.
In the development of natural fiber-reinforced polyester nanocomposites, the 
most investigated nanofillers were nanoclays [12, 49], eggshell powder (ESP) 
[50, 51], and calcium carbonate [52]. The main challenges in the development 
of hybrid natural fiber-based nanocomposites are to achieve good dispersion of 
nanoparticles within the polyester resin and also to obtain good interfacial adhe￾sion between polyester, fibers, and the nanofillers. Various researchers have used 
nanoclays as nanofillers in polymer nanocomposite systems. However, most of the 
work using nanoclays as reinforcing nanofillers has been hindered by obstacles 
related to achieving optimal dispersion of nanoclays in the polymer matrix and 
inadequate interfacial interaction between the nanoclays and the polymer matrix. 
The problem of inadequate dispersion of nanoclays arose from the aggregation 
of nanoclays by Van der Waals forces between the nanofillers. Therefore, various 
mechanical and chemical techniques have been used to improve the dispersion 
of fillers in the matrix. The most widely used technique in polyester/nanoclays is 
using the ultrasonication process. This method is reported to produce good disper￾sion of nanoclays in the polymer matrix which leads to improved mechanical and 
thermal properties [53].
On the other hand, the hydrophilicity of nanoclay hinders the ability of nanoclay 
to disperse well in many polymer matrices. To overcome this problem, various modi￾fications of nanoclays such as amino acids, tetraorganic phosphonium or organic 
ammonium salts are used [53]. The addition of clay to a polymer resin system can be 
exfoliated, intercalated, or tactoid, depending on the method of preparation or syn￾thesis, type of clay, amount of organic modifier, the polarity of the organic modifier, 
and the type of polymer matrix used [54].
Some researchers have carried out a study on utilizing nanofillers in hybrid natu￾ral fiber-reinforced composites. Ganesan et al. [55] studied the synergistic effect of 
jute fiber and coir fiber as hybrid reinforcements in polyester composites-filled hybrid 
eggshell powder (ESP) and montmorillonite nanoclay filler. The results show that the 
addition of the hybrid filler to the hybrid fiber composite improved the mechanical 
properties compared to the composite without the hybrid filler. Moreover, hybridiza￾tion of fillers also resulted in reducing water uptake of the composites. The hybrid 
polyester composite reinforced with 1.5% by weight ESP/MMT hybrid filler shows 
the lowest water absorption of 3.8% and 4.0% in river and seawater environments, 
respectively.
The uses of nanofiller in VO-based composites are more significant as the addition 
of VO in polyester (UPE) resin improved the toughness properties of the VO/UPE 
resin; however, the stiffness of the VO/UPE resin decreased. The opposing stiffness Hybrid Polyester and Bio-Polyester Composites 209
and toughness performance of the VO/UPE resin needs a proper balance in order to 
get an efficient thermoset resin. One way to attain this balance is by adding nano￾filler. In the literature, there are several researchers reported on the enhancement of 
the stiffness and mechanical properties of UPE/VO with the addition of nanofillers. 
The synergy between nanofiller and UPE/VO matrix may produce composites with 
properties equivalent to or improved from pure polyester resin, and it is expected to 
be used in a wide range of applications.
Haq et al. [12] studied the effects of nanoclays on epoxidized methyl linseedate/
UPR. In this study nanoclays loadings varied between 2.5 and 5.0wt.%. The addi￾tion of nanoclays reduced the strength and toughness properties of the resins. This 
effect is explained by the increased stiffness of the nanoclay, which in turn forms 
more brittle nanocomposites. Liu et al. [48] investigated the effects of clay content 
on mechanical and thermal properties of soybean oil/clay nanocomposites. It was 
observed that the stiffness properties of the resulted resins were improved by the 
addition of clay up to 8wt.%. The further increases in clay loading up to 10wt.% 
reduce the storage modulus of the resins.
11.9 FUTURE OUTLOOK
Overall, natural fiber-reinforced polyester composites have proven to be a viable 
alternative to fiberglass-reinforced polyester composites, especially in automo￾tive and construction products. However, natural fiber-reinforced polyester com￾posites are not environmentally friendly as the polymer matrix material is still 
petroleum-based and not biodegradable. Therefore, it is important to develop natu￾ral fiber-reinforced resins based on renewable resources in order to improve the 
sustainability of composite materials and solve environmental problems such as 
reducing dependence on non-renewable resources. The development of bio-based 
resins from renewable sources is a clear future outlook. For the past decade, natu￾ral oils have received a great deal of attention as a raw material for thermosetting 
resins due to their availability and low cost. However, it has been found that the use 
of VO-based resins in composite materials is limited due to their lower mechanical 
and thermo-physical properties compared to synthetic resins. Therefore, most of 
the research done so far has focused on blends of petroleum-based resins and VOs. 
Partial replacement of petroleum-based resins with functionalized VOs has been 
reported to improve the toughness, barrier, and thermal properties of the resulting 
bio-based resin system. However, the improvement in toughness performance gen￾erally goes against the stiffness performance of the material. Therefore, some fill￾ers need to be added to achieve the proper balance of toughness and stiffness and to 
improve certain properties of the bio-based resin. The development of composites 
from entirely natural materials and reinforced with natural fibers is one of the goals 
in the world of collaborative research. For example, the development of polyester 
resins that are synthesized directly from VOs, reinforced with natural fibers, and 
filled with natural fillers, can be further investigated in the future. However, some 
research suggestions are needed to get a composite that gives satisfactory results 
in a real application.210 Polyester-Based Biocomposites
11.10 CONCLUSION
In summary, this chapter has explained extensively the method, approach, detailed 
important parameters, and performances of the hybrid polyester composite. There 
are multiple hybridization approaches discussed in this chapter, including the hybrid￾ization of the reinforcing agent such as fibers and fillers. Bio-polyester successfully 
synthesized by blending polyester and VO reinforced with hybrid natural fibers has 
a good future in green composites. This chapter also highlights the importance of 
analyzing the interactions between the continuous and non-continuous, and also 
between all the hybrid entities contained in the composite to allow optimum per￾formance of polyester composite. In summary, hybridization is the best method that 
could enhance the properties of polyester and bio-polyester composite to meet the 
high technology demand in future.

12.1 INTRODUCTION
Present-day technologies such as aerospace, safe and quality transportation, and 
underwater solicitations demand a special amalgamation of material properties 
which can’t be fulfilled by ceramics or metal alloys. The material properties could 
be high specific stiffness and specific strength, and less dense (Alothman et al., 
2020; Thomas et al., 2021; Senthilkumar et al., 2015, 2022; Nasimudeen et al., 2021; 
Shahroze et al., 2021). Such combination of properties could be achieved by merg￾ing different materials in a thoughtful way and the resulting materials are termed as 
composites or hybrids. Recently, hybrids of carbon-reinforced polymers and glass 
fiber-reinforced polymers serve as alternatives to metals in several industrial appli￾cations (Fuqua et al., 2012; Joshi et al., 2004; Li et al., 2007; Herrera-Franco and 
Valadez-González, 2005). Broadly, these composites are categorized into two types, 
synthetic fiber-reinforced and the natural fiber-reinforced ones. Synthetic fibers are 
generally used as filler or reinforcing agents to develop polymer composite. The 
problem with synthetic fibers is its high energy combustion, non-renewability and 
non-biodegradability. Hence, there is a great interest in employing natural fibers as 
reinforcements in thermoplastic epoxy matrix. Various plant-based natural fibers 
such as coir, ramie, bamboo, sisal, jute and many more, and animal-based fibers 
such as wool, silk and many more have been explored as reinforcing materials in the 
composite’s fabrication (Radoor et al., 2022).
The attractive features of natural fibers are low cost, biodegradability, abun￾dance, renewability and excellent recyclability. Hence, natural fiber-based composite 
causes less environmental issues than synthetic fibers, and it was suggested as a good 
replacement for synthetic fiber (Chandrasekar et al., 2020; Senthilkumar et al., 2021). 
Nevertheless, the weak thermo-mechanical properties, poor compatibility with the 
polymer and high water absorption limits the applications of natural fibers-reinforced 
composite (Radoor et al., 2021; Parameswaranpillai et al., 2022; Chandrasekar et al., 
2021). The compatibility of natural fiber with the matrix is enhanced by surface 
treatment such as alkali, permanganate and isocyanate. Hybrid composite is another 
solution for improving the properties of natural fiber-based composite (Chandrasekar 
et al., 2022a, b). Hybrid composite means two or more fibers in one matrix or two 
polymer blends and with one natural fiber reinforcement. The resulting composite 
shows unique properties such as high mechanical, thermal and water absorption, over 
individual fiber-reinforced composite (Sabarish et al., 2020; Radoor et al., 2020a, b).
12.2 PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF NATURAL FIBER/
POLYESTER HYBRID COMPOSITES
Akil et al (2014) improved the durability of jute fiber by hybridizing it with synthetic 
glass fiber. In their work they monitored the effect of water aging on the mechanical 
properties of jute fiber and jute/glass fiber hybrid composite. It can be clearly seen

that water aging has detrimental effects on the mechanical properties of both com￾posites. The water exposure causes the degradation of jute and thereby results in the 
mechanical damage. In the case of hybrid composite, the reduction in water uptake 
is low due to the fact that glass fiber acts as the barrier and thereby prevents contact 
between the fiber and water (Figure 12.1). Hence, hybrid composite shows superior 
tensile and flexural strength even after water aging. Polyester composite was devel￾oped through talc as filler. The talc-incorporated composites have less tendency for 
cracking and also can withstand bending force. Consequently, the flexural strength 
and Young’s modulus of the composite increase with the increase in talc content. The 
authors therefore concluded that talc-incorporated polyester composites possess good 
mechanical, thermal and water absorption properties (Jahani and Ehsani, 2009).
Arumugam et al. (2020) studied the effect of chemical treatment and nanopar￾ticles on the physical and mechanical properties of kenaf fiber/unsaturated polyester 
(UPE) composite. Their results suggested that inclusion of nanoparticle and chemi￾cally treatment has significantly improved the mechanical and thermal properties 
of kenaf fiber composite. The silver nanoparticle enhances the interfacial adhesion 
of the fiber and the polymer matrix. The mechanical bonding between the fiber and 
the polymer matrix is also improved by chemical treatment; the chemical treatment 
removes the lignin and cellulose from the fiber surface and makes the surface rough. 
The removal of lignin from the fiber surface is confirmed by monitoring the intensity

of characteristic band of lignin (1736cm−1). The band at 1736cm−1 was completely 
disappeared on treating the fiber with 5% NaOH. Athijayamani et al. (2009) studied 
the tensile, flexural and impact strength of roselle and sisal fiber hybrid polyester 
composite in both dry and wet conditions. In the case of both dry and wet condi￾tions, the mechanical properties increase with increase in weight percentage of the 
fiber and its length. But in the case of wet condition, there is significant reduction in 
the mechanical properties of the composites. With increase in the fiber content, the 
amount of water absorption also increases due to high cellulose content and genera￾tion of large number of microvoids. The presence of moisture in the composite has a 
negative impact on the interfacial interaction between the matrix and the fiber, which 
is reflected in the morphological analysis. Presence of void and generation of crack 
is clearly visible in the micrograph of the composite immersed in water. Atiqah et al. 
(2014) developed kenaf glass fiber-reinforced UPE hybrid composite for structural 
applications. The hybrid composites displayed good mechanical performance and 
the properties were further improved by mercerization treatment. The merceriza￾tion process enhanced the adhesion between the fiber and matrix, which is quite 
evident from the SEM (scanning electron microscope) micrograph (Figure 12.2). 
Less fiber pulls out and absence of microvoid confirm the strong mechanical bond￾ing in treated kenaf fiber hybrid composites. A hybrid biocomposite from UPE and 
epoxidized methyl soyate was developed by Haq et al. (2008). The tensile strength 
and tensile modulus increased with the addition of nanoclay. Due to the synergistic 
effect of hemp and the nanoclay, the hybrid composite displayed good stiffness and 
toughness. The author thus suggested hybrid biocomposites as suitable candidate for 
structural and transportation applications. Similarly, Dewan et al. (2013) observed an 
enhancement in the properties of developed hybrid composite of polyester reinforced 
with alkali/untreated jute and nanoclay. The combined effect of nanoclay and sur￾face treatment make the hybrid composite induce thermo-mechanical stability to the 
composite. However, high percentage of clay leads to agglomeration and therefore to 
a reduction in the mechanical properties of the composite.
Prasanna Venkatesh et al. (2016) observed an enhancement in the tensile, flexural 
and impact properties of polyester composite reinforced with treated sisal/bamboo 
fiber. The mechanical properties increase with increase in fiber content and maxi￾mum mechanical properties was observed for fiber length 15 cm and fiber content 
of 20%. The untreated fiber has smooth surface, and during mechanical test the 
fiber was pulled out and deboned. This problem is minimized by fiber treatment. 
The fiber treatment reduces the moisture absorption capacity of the composite and 
improves the adhesion of the fiber with the polymer matrix. The good interfacial 
adhesion in the treated composite is confirmed from morphological and mechanical 
analyses. Rout et al. (2001) studies shows that an optimum percentage of alkali is 
required for improving the mechanical bonding of fiber with the matrix. They have 
varied the percentage of alkali from 2%–10%. The coir fiber modified with 2% and 
5% alkali shows significant tensile and flexural strength. However, for 10% alkali￾treated samples, a reduction in the mechanical properties was noted. High percent￾age of alkali thickens the cell wall of the fiber and thereby leads to poor adhesion 
between the fiber and matrix. Oil palm shell (OPS) is an agricultural waste, which 
could be employed as filler in polymer composite. Rosamah et al. (2016) utilized OPS Natural Fiber/Polyester-Based Hybrid Composites 219

nanoparticle as a filler in polyester composite. The addition of OPS nanoparticles 
improves the energy absorbing capability and surface area of the composite. The 
uniform distribution of nanoparticles in the polymer matrix reduces the free space 
within the hybrid composite and thereby enhances the filler matrix interaction. The 
3% OPS nanoparticle-loaded composite exhibits maximum value for tensile strength 
and modulus. The reduction in the properties at high weight percentage of OPS 
nanoparticles is ascribed to the formation of agglomeration. Meanwhile, Reddy et al. 
(2020) added industrial waste granite powder into hybrid polyester composite. Here, 
in addition to granite powder, alkali-treated Cordia dichotoma fiber was also used 
as filler. The mechanical properties of the composites were investigated at differ￾ent weight percentages of granite powder (5%–20%) by keeping C. dichotoma fiber 
content at fixed percentage (20wt%). With increase in the granite powder, the tensile 
modulus and strength also increase. The granite powder is properly dispersed in the 
polymer matrix and enhances the adhesion between the constituent of the composite. 
However, beyond 15%, the granite powder has a negative effect on the mechanical 
properties (Figure 12.3).
High concentration of granite increases the viscosity of the system and causes 
exfoliation of the polymer matrix. Similar observation was noticed for impact 
strength. SEM morphological result revealed the well dispersion of granite filler on 
the surface of the C. dichotoma fiber. Arumuga Prabu and co-workers (2014) applied 
industrial waste, red mud (RM) to improve the properties of banana fiber-reinforced

polyester composite. The experimental results suggest that RM is an effective filter. 
The RM-incorporated composite can therefore be applied for high load-bearing appli￾cation (Figure 12.4 and 12.5). Idicula et al. (2006) analyzed the static and dynamic 
mechanical properties of the banana/sisal fiber-reinforced polyester matrix. Results 
revealed that hybrid composite shows better mechanical property than unhybridized 
composite. They observed that 0.4 volume fraction of fiber shows good results due to 
the effective transfer of stress between the fiber and the polymer matrix.
12.3 FACTORS INFLUENCING THE MECHANICAL 
FEATURES OF COMPOSITES
Some of the important parameters such as environmental conditions, fiber layers 
stacking sequence, fiber treatment and fiber volume to weight ratio are known to 
influence the mechanical features of hybrid composites. The following sections will 
detail those parameters one by one.
12.3.1 Effect of Environmental Conditions
The environmental conditions in which the composites are used have a greater influ￾ence on their mechanical features, due to which scientists have started exploring 
the mechanical conditions of prepared composites at varied environmental condi￾tions. Natural fiber-reinforced composites possess internal strong water absorption 
property under moisture or wet environment. Hydrothermal degradation of jute-rein￾forced composites (JFRP) and glass-reinforced composite (GFRP) was explored by 
Liao et al. JFRP was able to absorb more amount of water and was faster than GFRP 
due to hydroscopic nature of jute fiber. Due to loss of resin particles, weight loss 
was observed and pectin dissolution occurred due to the micro-cracks attributing to 
hydrothermal water environments. There also occurred serious internal deterioration 
(Liao et al., 2012). Phani and Bose explored a similar work, wherein the hydrother￾mal aging was studied by acousto-ultrasonic technique. They found that incorpora￾tion of jute into GFRP reduced the degradation rate for the ones which were aged 
above 70 hours. Jute fiber and jute resin interfaces are expected to undergo faster 
degradation under moist conditions below 70 hours aging. Above 70hours aging, the 
inflated jute fiber layer would absorb swelling strain from the resin, which acts as 
cushion. Additionally, jute fibers give added protection for the sandwiched glass lay￾ers (Phani and Bose, 1987). Composites made of orthophthalic polyester reinforced 
with curaua and E-glass fiber were exposed to distilled water and sea water and their 
mechanical properties were compared (Silva et al., 2008). Up to 330hours, the diffu￾sion rate for both the water remained same. However, after 330 hours, the diffusion 
rate for sea water reduced, attributing to the added NaCl ions on the fiber surface. 
The ones exposed to distilled water possessed lower tensile strength and tensile mod￾ulus than those exposed to sea water due to the greater absorption of water. Due to 
matrix plasticization, the flexural modulus for sea water-exposed samples degraded 
in a greater way. Water absorption ability and the swelling thickness for oil palm and 
jute-reinforced materials were tested. In the study by Abdul et al., the addition of jute Natural Fiber/Polyester-Based Hybrid Composites 223
fibers to the oil palm fibers at higher concentrations improved the mechanical char￾acteristics. The work concluded the direct dependency of water adsorption ability 
and thickness swelling of composite on the density, existence of voids and the nature 
of fiber and matrix bonding of composite. Critical stress intensity factor, interlaminar 
shear strength and impact toughness for glass or textile fabric-reinforced hybrid were 
tested under ambient conditions and sea water. The considered parameters varied 
with the immersion time. Both the environments showed a different feature with 
respect to matrix cracking, growth of crack and fiber pull-out (Abdul Khalil et al., 
2008).
12.3.2 Fiber Layers Stacking Sequence
The arrangement pattern of fiber layers in the hybrid composites is termed as 
stacking sequence. The symmetry in the sequence and the mechanical features of 
extremities and the core layer interestingly vary the impact, tensile and flexural 
strengths. A stacking sequence in jute- and glass-reinforced composites was varied 
by Ahmed and Vijayarangan (2008). Specimens with glass fibers at the extremities 
possessed a greater strength due to the stiffness and strength of glass fibers than 
those with jute fibers. Amico and group reported that hybrids with symmetrical 
stacking sequence are more capable when compared to the ones with asymmetrical 
stacking sequence owing to the structural integrity of the overall hybrid (Amico 
et al., 2008). Ortho-UPE was reinforced with long abaca and short bagasse fibers 
with altered sequences (Cao et al., 2006). Three abaca sheets were sandwiched 
between two bagasse mats; the orientations were parallel and at 90° cross-ply. 
Specimen with cross-ply orientation showed lesser tensile strength but exhibited 
greater load support, tested at both axial and transverse directions signifying its 
feasibility for biaxial loading. Woven coir (C) and glass (G) hybrids were made 
with different stacking sequences such as CGG, GGC, GGG and CGC (Jayabal et 
al., 2011). Maximum flexural, impact and tensile strengths were obtained for CGG 
than any other sequence. GGC sequence showed greater mechanical properties 
than GCG, and it also possessed greater breaking resistance than CGC sequence 
due to weaker coir fibers than glass fibers.
12.3.3 Fiber Treatment
An interfacial bonding and the compatibility between the matrix and fiber is an 
essential feature for the feasible performance. Chemical treatment is one of the best 
ways to reach the best interfacial bonding. The most preferred one is the alkali 
treatment, which aids in improving interfacial adhesion between matrix and fiber. 
Sisal and glass fiber-reinforced polyester was kept untreated, and treated with alkali 
and silane, and their mechanical characteristics were compared (John and Naidu, 
2016). Alkali treatment removes the hemicellulose from natural fibers and helps in 
improved adhesion properties, and hence, hybrid treated with alkali showed maxi￾mum tensile strength than silane-treated and untreated hybrids. Silane treatment 
aids in increasing wetting property of sisal fiber resulting in better tensile strength 
than untreated hybrid. Jute fibers treated with alkali underwent acrylation and led 224 Polyester-Based Biocomposites
to improved physical properties. Due to –OH groups esterification after alkali treat￾ment, the composites showed reduced water uptake (Patel et al., 2008). Kapok and 
glass fiber-reinforced polyester was treated with alkali, and thus an increase in bond 
strength and interlaminar shear strength was observed (Venkata Reddy et al., 2008). 
The same group has also explored the effect of alkali treatment on bamboo fiber￾reinforced hybrids (Reddy et al., 2010). Lignin and hemicellulose were removed 
by the alkali treatment to the coir/silk fiber composites, which increased fiber and 
matrix adhesion (Noorunnisa Khanam et al., 2009). Alavudeen and group have 
shown that banana/kenaf-reinforced hybrids showed better performance when the 
fibers were treated with 10% NaOH and 10% of sodium lauryl sulfate for 30 min￾utes (Alavudeen et al., 2015). Jute and E-glass fiber-reinforced UPE was prepared 
by Abdullah-Al et al. (2005). The dissimilar proportions of E-glass and jute (3:1) 
gave the better performance. The fiber surfaces when irradiated with UV radiation 
of different intensities have changed the mechanical properties. A Charpy impact 
strength of 40 kJ/m2 was obtained for the jute/E-glass-reinforced fiber treated with 
UV radiation.
12.3.4 Fiber Volume
A measure of weight fraction or the volume of fibers in hybrid is termed as fiber vol￾ume. The weight or volume ratios of fiber in the matrix have affected the mechanical 
properties of hybrids both positively and negatively. Banana and glass fibers hybrids 
showed the linear variation of mechanical features with the glass fiber volume 
(Nunna et al., 2012). At higher ratio of glass fibers volume, the delamination of layers 
is observed and the failure of the hybrid occurred. 11% weight ration of glass fiber 
gave the optimal mechanical features. In the case of silk/glass hybrid composite has 
fixed weight ratio of 25%, silk-glass fiber of total weight ratio 25%, where the weight 
of glass varied from 0% to 50%. Each with 50% of weight ratio showed better per￾formance (Priya and Rai, 2016). The glass fiber avoids the direct transformation of 
water tosilk, and it also transfers the efficient load transfer to silk. Wood flour hybrid￾ized with kenaf fiber was found to show greater properties with increase in kenaf 
fiber weight (Mirbagheri et al., 2007). In case of jute and glass fiber composite, 25% 
weight of jute showed better performance and beyond which the efficiency decreased 
due to the agglomerates formation (Abdullah-Al et al., 2005). These agglomerates 
would block the stress transfer and hence decreases the crack resistance and the 
mechanical properties. Mishra et al. fabricated pineapple leaf fiber- and sisal fiber￾reinforced composites (Mishra et al., 2003). A very small amount of added glass 
fiber to the leaf and sisal fiber-reinforced matrix increased the mechanical proper￾ties of the formed hybrid. The group also explored the effect of alkali treatment and 
cyanoethylation to the sisal fibers on the mechanical features. Alkali treatment has 
improved the optimum properties the cyanoethylation increased the flexural strength 
of hybrids (Figure 12.6).
Overall, the mechanical features of hybrids increase linearly with the volume 
fraction of high strength fibers and it is applicable up to some ratios, beyond which 
the hybrids will fail due to agglomeration of reinforcing materials. Alkali treatment 
enhances the adhesion between fiber and matrix, leading to increased stiffness of the Natural Fiber/Polyester-Based Hybrid Composites 225
composite. The deformation of hybrid occurs depending on the exposure time and 
temperature with respect to various environmental conditions. The performance and 
behavior of hybrids are also dependent on the extreme layer of the hybrid; the fiber of 
greater strength placed at the extreme layer would show better performance.
12.4 CONCLUSION
In this chapter, we presented an overview of reports on the enhancement of mechani￾cal properties, water barrier, and thermal stability of natural fiber/polyester hybrid 
composites. It was observed that the effect of chemical treatment, coupling agent, 
fiber geometry, stacking sequence, fiber volume and concentration influences the 
overall properties of natural fiber hybrid composites. Hybrid composites exhibit supe￾rior physical properties such as tensile, impact, flexural and compressive strength 
compared to neat samples. The advantages of combination of natural and synthetic 
fibers are being eco-friendly, biodegradability, low cost and comparable mechanical 
properties, compared to glass fiber-reinforced composites. Hybrid composites have 
a wide range of applications such as automotive parts, construction and food pack￾aging. The main challenges that we will face in the near future are to enhance the 
mechanical and water barrier properties of hybrid composites with low cost and to 
develop an eco-friendly strategy.

13.1 INTRODUCTION
Concerns about the environment have boosted interest in renewable resource-based 
products. Polymeric materials, due to their wide collection of characteristics, are 
now an integral component of daily life. The efficient utilization of biodegradable 
polymers, which are being used more efficiently in a variety of disciplines, includ￾ing medical, pharmacy, agro-chemistry, marine, and packaging industry, is grow￾ing rapidly (Alothman et al., 2020; Chandrasekar et al., 2020, 2022a). Plastics have 
numerous advantages over other traditional materials, including performance and 
adaptability, corrosion resistance, ease of processing, lightweight, durability, low 
cost, high productivity, environmental aspects, and so on, which determine their 
value to the society and ensure future industrial development. Biodegradable poly￾mers can be considered ecologically benign and an appealing alternative to conven￾tional polymers in terms of long-term sustainable development (Musiol et al., 2011).
Composites are heterogeneous materials that are made up of a mixture of (two or 
more) materials with distant physical and chemical characteristics. To attain greater 
mechanical performance in the desired plane, composite materials are combined 
with the high qualities of fiber and matrix components. Composites used in marine 
applications provide additional advantages such as flatness stealth and corrosion 
resistance to reliable and durable vessels (Cao and Grenestedt, 2004). In general, con￾ditioning reinforcement fibers is to be done before composite makeup in aerospace 
and automotive sectors, which prefer to employ glass and carbon synthetic fibers 
for polymer strengthening (Chandrasekar et al., 2022b; Nasimudeen et al., 2021; 
Senthilkumar et al., 2015, 2021, 2022). Bio-composites are made up of one or more 
layers of natural fiber reinforcing with biopolymers (organic matrix). At the same 
time, biopolymers (natural biopolymers such as gelatin, corn zein, and soy protein; 
synthetic biopolymers such as poly(lactic acid) (PLA), poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), 
and other microbial polyesters) and reinforcements (cotton, hemp, flax, sisal, jute, 
and kenaf or recycled wood and paper) are renewable and degradable (Akampumuza 
et al., 2017) (Table 13.1).
Despite their higher cost, high-performance goods that are lightweight but robust 
are sufficient to endure rigorous packing conditions. One of the most significant draw￾backs of using this vast family of composites is difficulty in applying two separate 
components at the same time. This makes end-of-life reuse and recycling extremely 
challenging. As a result, it is preferred to dispose of composite materials directly in 
a landfill or eliminate them.
In the mid-1960s, the hand lay-up process was used to produce mat and woven 
roving fiber glass. Polymeric composite materials are widely used in offshore struc￾tures, boats, submersibles, ships, and other marine structural applications. Sandwich 
construction methods were first utilized in the related industry in the 1970s, leading to 
the development of advanced fabrication technology and the usage of substitute resins 
such as vinyl ester and epoxy in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Polymer composites 
have tremendous potential for a broad range of uses, but their environmental effects 
and distance from a manufacturing industry limit their widespread use (Pickering, 
2006). Plastic manufacturing, on the other hand, necessitates significantly non-renew￾able oil-based resources (Shahroze et al., 2021; Thomas et al., 2021).Polyester-Based Bio-Composites for Marine Applications 233
Petroleum-based synthetic polymers, such as polyolefin, are used in packing 
bottles and in molded goods employed in today’s society. Worldwide, millions of 
tons of petrochemical plastics’ disposal creates serious environmental issues; even 
production and consumption continue to rise. Furthermore, because these plastic 
wastes are resistant to microbial assault, they have become an unwelcome pollu￾tion on land, rivers, and seas. Nowadays, the usage of eco-friendly biodegradable 
polymers is the most practical way to replace the use of petroleum-based plastic 
components.
Regrettably, polymeric composite materials are sensitive to moisture and tem￾perature, and prolonged exposure to such severe environments causes the material’s 
mechanical qualities to deteriorate. For the prediction of structural service life, it is 
vital to understand the durability and life cycle of composites in terms of mechani￾cal, chemical, and thermal characteristics (Hawileh et al., 2015; Yan et al., 2015). 
These biodegradable polymer compounds have the capacity to degrade completely in 
natural ecosystems (natural soil, lakes, active sludge, and seas). These eco-friendly 
polymers, on the other hand, can be chemically changed by the action of microbes 
or biological enzymes. According to some research, the biodegradability of bio￾composites was the most essential aspect for many composites. A completely new 
approach on production and product must be provided, using present-day environ￾mental assessment methods.

13.2 DEGRADATION AND MARINE FOULING
The rate of degradation of bio-composite materials in a variety of natural habitats, 
not simply composting systems, is a significant quality for its long-term sustainabil￾ity and reduction of the environmental impact associated with petrochemical-based 
plastics. Each year, several hundred thousand tons of plastic are estimated to be dis￾carded directly or indirectly into the ocean, causing consequent negative impact on 
the pelagic and benthic marine environments (Gregory, 2009) (Table 13.2).
Fouling organisms must be protected aboard any boats and ship’s vessel or device 
used in the marine applications, and fouling can be displaced using recently devel￾oped technologies. Toxic formulations such as cuprous oxide paints can raise the 
amounts of heavy metals, and other toxic substances in the marine ecology (e.g., tri￾butyl tin is banned worldwide) are potential hazards. Self-polishing (exfoliating) sur￾faces produce polymer micro-debris, which concentrate poisons and are consumed by 
animals at the bottom of the food chain (Thompson et al., 2005). Low-surface energy 
coatings (e.g. silicone or polytetrafluoroethylene, PTFE) require extensive surface 
preparation to enable solid adhesion of the non-stick substance to the component.
13.3 RUSTING AND CAVITATION
A vapour bubble can form in a fast fluid flow with local pressures below the vapour 
pressure and sources for nucleation, and it will ascend until it reaches a higher pres￾sure zone and collapse.. The term “cavitation” is accredited to Froude. Cavitation 
erosion of metal–matrix composites from a materials perspective is based on crystal 
displacement mechanics.

According to Hammond et al. (1993), GRP performs better than aluminum 
but not as well as nickel aluminum bronze (NiAl bronze) in cavitation erosion 
resistance.
 According to Yamatogi et al. (2009), glass fiber has weak cavitation erosion 
resistance, whereas carbon fiber, unreinforced epoxy resin, and aramid fiber\ Nickel 
Aluminum Bronze (NAB) have strong cavitation erosion resistance. Some elasto￾meric coatings have very high erosion resistance, according to Kallas and Lichtman 
(1968); however, such systems may be damaged by coating substrate separation, 
resulting in early failure. Hydrofoils and stern gear are made of composites that work 
in a cavitating area, such as propellers (Anon, 2003) and rudders (Anon, 2012).
Due to the flow of an electric current, metals and semiconductors material may 
corrode. Electrochemical corrosion is not a concern because the majority of the con￾stituent materials in fiber-reinforced laminates act as insulators. Carbon fibers should 
not be utilized with structural metals like light alloys in the presence of conducting 
fluid (seawater). To prevent the galvanic corrosion, cell formation and consequent 
loss of the alloy, and a thin glass fiber surface layer or polymer liners around bolt￾holes, should be adequate.
13.4 SYNTHETIC COMPOSITES
When wood gets wet, it degrades and is attacked by marine boring creatures. In sea￾water, surface coatings protect steel, iron, and aluminum against rust and corrosion. 
As a result, one of the most essential factors in the acceptance of fiber-reinforced 
polymer and glass fiber-reinforced polyester for long-term usage in seawater has been 
their capacity to withstand this environment. Resins that cure at room temperature 
are compatible with reinforcing materials and are simple to laminate. Boat builders 
require resins with high mechanical and thermal qualities. Resins are simple to work 
with, when making composite parts.
In terms of mechanical characteristics and cost, vinyl esters are a cross between 
polyesters and epoxies. Because of the ester group’s presence, they have a good affin￾ity with polyesters, and they, like polyesters, require a catalyst and accelerator to cure 
at ambient temperature (Marsh, 2007). Vinyl esters have fewer reactive sites, so they 
may tolerate chemical corrosion well and have acceptable absorption and hydrolytic 
attack characteristics. As a result of these factors, they are a popular choice for boat 
hulls (Galanis, 2002; Marsh, 2007). A vinyl ester-based skin on a glass/polyester 
laminate can avoid hydrolysis-induced osmotic blistering. Even though epoxies are 
a more efficient barrier against humidity, boat builders and owners can adopt this 
protection instead of the more expensive epoxies.
Vinyl esters have a higher hardness than polyesters, making them more flexible. 
As a result, they can survive the effects of fatigue, which causes hulls and decks dam￾age when utilized as a matrix in a fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) laminate. Vinyl 
esters operate at a higher temperature of approximately 200°C. By using vinyl esters 
rather than polyester resins to create GRP components for their motor yachts, West 
Bay Son Ship of British Columbian was the first to advocate for this transition. Vinyl 
ester is increasingly being employed in the construction of larger ships and navy 
ships, because of its resilience.236 Polyester-Based Biocomposites
Because of rigorous surface preparation required during treatment and the spe￾cific environmental conditions required to produce proper adhesion between fibers 
and resin, processing vinyl esters is more difficult and time-consuming when com￾pared to polyesters. Furthermore, today’s resins should be low in styrene to com￾ply with more stringent industrial emission regulations (Hoge and Leach, 2016). In 
FRP constructions, polyester and epoxy resins are commonly utilized as matrices. 
Despite, this, there has been a substantial improvement with phenolic-based resins.
Phenolic resins can tolerate relatively high temperatures (about 200°C), and they 
are known for their fire resistance, while emitting minimal smoke or harmful fumes. 
Hand lay-up, hot-press, and infusion are all methods that can be used to process 
them. Mechanical properties, on the other hand, are 10%–20% lower than those of 
polyesters (Kimpara, 1991; Slater, 1994).
13.4.1 Plasticizing Effect
The plasticizing effect can be described. As the plasticizer concentration is raised, 
the fracture strength, elastic modulus, and viscosity of biopolymer–water mixtures 
decrease. When water molecules penetrate polymer composite materials, the plas￾ticizing action is evident. Depending on whether the composite is made of a poly￾mer matrix or natural fibers, it has a different impact on the composite’s behavior. 
Effective plasticizers facilitate inter and intra-macromolecular contacts which may 
be shielded, segmental molecular motion must be facilitated, and internal friction 
in the biopolymer materials must be reduced. Plasticizers that are good solvents are 
usually good plasticizers. Some macromolecular associations and crystalline areas 
can be dissolved by a good solvent, while inter- and intra-molecular interactions are 
protected. The solvation shells reduce the activation energy of segmental motion by 
increasing the distance between chain segments. Many low-molecular-weight hydro￾philic chemicals can operate as plasticizers for most biopolymers. Water, on the other 
hand, is the most effective.
13.4.2 Swelling
When water is absorbed, it causes expansion strains in polymers and polymer com￾posites that are analogous to thermal expansion. Water molecules diffuse between 
the polymer’s macromolecular chains and fill the free volume, causing the distance 
between the macromolecules to grow. Swelling of polymers or composites occurs as 
the spacing between polymer chains widens. The steady-state or equilibrium state of 
the swelling process is the focus of the most swelling studies and characterizations. 
As the space between polymer chains grows, polymers or composites swell.
The stretch of osmotic pressure and a pull of material elasticity balance the equi￾librium swelling of each network strand. Swelling measurements of filler-modified 
polymer composites are commonly used to quantify the polymer’s cross-linking den￾sity. Araby et al. (2014), for example, evaluated the cross-linking density of graphene 
nanoplatelet-reinforced nano-composites produced to improve the electrical and 
thermal properties of styrene-butadiene by performing swelling investigations. The 
two most common methods for measuring swelling are gravimetrical and optical. Polyester-Based Bio-Composites for Marine Applications 237
The mass ratio of the swollen network and solvent to the dry extracted material is 
taken into consideration in gravimetric measurements (Gevers et al., 2006).
13.4.3 Hydrolysis
In polymer materials, water diffusion can cause both physical and chemical interac￾tions with polymer chains. When polymers are exposed to humidity or immersed 
in water, it causes the most common damaging process, called hydrolysis. It works 
on the basis of a chemical reaction between polymer chains and water molecules, 
commonly referred to as a chain cleavage mechanism. In the presence of water, this 
mechanism causes chain cleavage, resulting in the production of two broken chains; 
one has a hydrogen ion and the other with a hydroxide ion. In the presence of water, 
the esters, amides, and epoxide groups are the most likely to be hydrolyzed.
Aside from masts and propellers, a variety of secondary pieces, particularly in 
warships, are now made of polymer composites instead of metal. Discharge funnel, 
protective systems, shield, rudder, bulkhead, deck, hatches engine components, and 
heat exchangers are only some of the examples.
13.5 BIO-COMPOSITES
The development of eco-friendly composites offers a way to mitigate environmen￾tal issues caused by marine operations. Agricultural waste has emerged as a viable 
resource for the production of environmentally acceptable composites. This exciting 
field of study has various advantages, including biodegradability when combined 
with bio-based or natural polymers, light weight, low cost, and simple manufactur￾ing (Kellersztein et al., 2019). Composite materials are made of two or even more 
materials that have been blended in such a way that the separate components can be 
easily distinguished.
Le Duigou et al. (2009) conducted a study on the aging of flax/PLA bio-compos￾ites in seawater. According to the results of this experiment, the absorption of water 
determined structural change, the degradation of fiber/matrix interface, different 
swelling at composite interfaces, and the degradation of matrix hydrolysis, and the 
degradation of fibers reduced the mechanical properties of the composites under the 
seawater aging mechanism.
The new material may be favored for a variety of reasons, including the fact that 
it is stronger, lighter, and less expensive than traditional materials. The majority of 
composites are made up of two materials: matrix and reinforcement. The reinforce￾ment is more rigid and stronger than the matrix, giving the composite its upper￾level qualities. The matrix keeps the reinforcement in an orderly pattern. Due to the 
uneven nature of reinforcement, the matrix also aids in the load transfer between 
reinforcements. These materials are also known as fiber-reinforced composite mate￾rials since they contain substantial fibers.
The most fundamental requirement for composites is the specificity of reinforce￾ment. There are three types of reinforcements: particle, discontinuous fibers, and 
continuous fiber. Fibers are reinforcements that have one dimension that is at least 
one order of magnitude greater than the others. Even though there is a wide range 238 Polyester-Based Biocomposites
of reinforcing options, the most frequent are glass, carbon, and aramid (commer￾cially known as Kevlar). These composites are commonly referred to as “reinforced 
plastics” because matrix materials are frequently plastic. The most common plastic 
matrices are epoxy, polyester, and vinyl ester resins.
A composite material is a mixture of two or more chemically different and insol￾uble phases whose characteristics and structural performance outperform those of 
its constituents functioning alone. Nowadays, composites are now one of the most 
widely used types of engineered materials. Composites are employed for electri￾cal, thermal, tribological, and environmental purposes in addition to their structural 
qualities. The type of reinforcement utilized in composite materials is frequently 
used to classify them. This reinforcement is encased in a matrix that keeps every￾thing together. The reinforcement is used to make the composite stronger. The matrix 
material in glass fiber reinforced polymers (GFRP), for example, is polymer, and the 
reinforcing is glass fiber.
The development of natural biodegradable polymer composites as a replacement 
for petrochemical sources is an essential research subject at this level of renew￾able energy implementation. Cotton, flax, hemp, jute, Bamboo, and nettle fibers are 
largely constituted of cellulose from plants, whereas animal-origin fibers are made of 
protein (hair, silk, wool). Natural fibers come in a wide range of colors and textures, 
and their smooth surfaces aid with matrix adherence. In comparison to standard 
petroleum-based polymers, the market for biopolymers is currently quite tiny. Agro￾polymers (such as starch and cellulose) and biodegradable polyesters (obtained by 
microbiological production) are two types of biopolymers (Figures 13.1 and 13.2).
Biopolymers have the best prospects for application potential in the packaging 
market, which is also the largest market segment. Bio-plastics have the potential to 
grab up to 10% of the global polyolefin resin industry, which is utilized in packaging 
and agricultural products, and their production is estimated to be around 18 million 
t/year. Furthermore, agricultural fibers for use in the construction and automotive 
composites might have a market of 5,000 t/year. The price difference between bio￾plastics and synthetic plastics is expected to narrow due to continued advancements 
in production and processing technology, increases in base crude oil prices, close 
substitute energy prices, and government regulations encouraging greater use of 
renewable energy and waste materials (Fowler et al., 2006).
Bio-composites are materials that contain one or more biologically generated 
components. Due to a lack of sufficient strength, stiffness, and dimensional stabil￾ity, these plastics are not appropriate for load-bearing applications. Fibers, on the 
other hand, offer tremendous strength and stiffness but, due to their fibrous structure, 
are challenging to utilize in load-bearing applications. Fibers provide strength and 
stiffness to fiber-reinforced composites, while the plastic matrix acts as an adhesive, 
binding the fibers in place so that structural composites can be created (Figure 13.3).
The principal physico-mechanical properties of natural fiber composites are that 
they are made of strong, light natural fibers that have a high strength-to-weight ratio.. 
However, because moisture absorption is often high and impact strength is low, rein￾forced materials’ technical properties can be compromised (Kuciel et al., 2010). To 
begin with, the use of synthetic fibers such as glass and carbon fibers leads to sig￾nificant structural lightening due to the massive specific weight difference between Polyester-Based Bio-Composites for Marine Applications 239
FIGURE 13.1 Natural and synthetic fibers of various sorts (Rajak et al., 2019). (Source: 
Open Access.)240 Polyester-Based Biocomposites
these materials and natural fibers (note that a linen strand weighs 1.4 g/cm3 versus 
2.1 for a glass fiber) and a corresponding reduction in fuel consumption (and harmful 
emissions). A shift to bio-sourced and recyclable matrix polymers has been favored, 
as environmental concerns have grown. Natural fibers, like as flax, are sometimes 
used to reinforce them.
The hydrophilic character of the lignocellulose fibers, and thus the moist sen￾sitivity of the composite material, is a possible issue with natural fiber-reinforced 
FIGURE 13.3 Hybrid structure: (a) laminate fiber sandwich arrangement; (b) inter-layer;

FIGURE 13.2 Plant-based natural fibers (Ashik and Sharma, 2015) (Source: Open Access.)Polyester-Based Bio-Composites for Marine Applications 241
polymer matrix composites. Water absorption will be delayed by embedding hydro￾philic fibers in a hydrophobic matrix, although the material will degrade over time 
due to diffusion and degradation. Moisture causes dimensional changes (swelling), 
changes in mechanical performance (plasticization, which results in higher strains to 
failure but lower moduli), and vulnerability to microbiological attack.
Acetylation is said to improve the resilience of composites when exposed to 
the environment. The matrix for composites containing various amounts of plant￾derived precursor ingredients is increasingly made of bio-based and/or biodegrad￾able thermoplastic polymers and thermosetting resins. The mechanical properties 
of the jute-epoxy composites were the best for all immersion times tested. Interface 
integrity and moisture resistance of jute fiber-matrix was better with epoxy resin 
(Costa and D’Almeida, 1999). Plant fibers can be acetylated to improve their com￾posite’s mechanical properties and hydrophobicity (Abdul Khalil et al., 2000). Jute 
and flax bast fibers, as well as coconut fiber (coir), oil palm empty fruit bunch, and oil 
palm frond were all to be considered for bio-composite production.
In marine manufacture, Short bio-fibers and wood dust are employed as fillers 
(thermoplastic blankets), as well as automobile, furniture, and train components. 
Long fibers such as hemp, bamboo, linen, and jute are employed as reinforcing 
materials to replace fiber glass. The fundamentals of fiber-reinforced plastics, which 
are a combination of polymeric resins and fibers, allow for the full or partial exploi￾tation of components with a natural origin, such as flax fiber, hemp, bamboo, or 
jute. Instead of using materials of synthetic origin, from flax fiber, hemp, bamboo, 
and jute, aside from being less expensive than glass, they are also non-abrasive, 
non-toxic, and biodegradable. Unfortunately, these fibers are hydrophilic, and hence 
they should be protected from moisture absorption, which might have disastrous 
repercussions.
13.6 THE DIFFUSION PROPERTIES OF NATURAL FIBERS
Natural fibers are composites fabricated mostly of cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, 
pectin, wax, and moisture (in the context of flax fibers) (Manfredi et al., 2006). The 
hemicellulose, which is the plant cell wall connected with the cellulose, is the fiber 
component responsible for moisture absorption (Methacanon et al., 2010). Higher 
hemicellulose content, as a result of the hollow-cavity shape of the fibers, leads to 
increased moisture sorption and biodegradation. The vulnerability of bio-composites 
to moisture, which causes dimensional changes and a loss of mechanical capabilities, 
drives researchers to investigate the use of a physico-chemical treatment to safeguard 
natural fibers.
When treated fibers are impregnated with a polymer matrix, the water resistance 
behavior changes. The coupling reaction between silane-treated fibers and an unsatu￾rated polyester resin is explained using a co-polymerization process. In the presence 
of a peroxide initiator, the methacryl groups of the silane molecule might react with 
the double bonds of the unsaturated polyester. Oil palm fibers treated with methacry￾loxypropylmethoxysilane were found to provide significant protection against water 
uptake in unsaturated polyester composites.242 Polyester-Based Biocomposites
13.6.1 Thermal Degradation
During service, composite materials destined for maritime applications may be sub￾jected to thermal degradation. The term “thermal degradation” refers to a long-term 
change in material behavior caused by changes in temperature. The examination of 
thermal degradation is much more difficult to study for bio-composites, which have 
a matrix thermal behavior that differs significantly from natural fibers. When natu￾ral fibers are used as a composite material, distinct thermal behavior for the lignin, 
hemicellulose, and other components is introduced.
When natural fibers are exposed to heat, their non-homogeneous nature deter￾mines their behavior. The heat deterioration of natural fibers determined the vis￾coelastic behavior of wood. The temperature activates the viscoelastic qualities of 
wood up to a point where the temperature causes the wood to degrade.
13.6.2 Mechanical Behavior
The mechanical character of bio-fibers in bio-composites may also be estimated 
by using Halpin Tsai model (Le Duigou et al., 2014). The creation of hydrogen 
bonds between water molecules and cellulose fibers may induce deterioration in 
mechanical characteristics of bio-composites as moisture content rises. Natural 
fibers have a high concentration of hydroxyl groups (–OH) in their structure, which 
forms a wide network of –H bonds between the cellulose macromolecules with 
polymer. Water can cause dimensional variation in composites and break down 
the interfacial connection between fiber and matrix when it forms hydrogen bonds 
with cellulose in the fiber structure. One of the mechanisms involved in makeup 
of bio-composites is the permeability of natural fibers to polymer impregnation 
(mostly polar resins).
13.6.3 Coupling Effect
In real situations, various damaging causes act simultaneously, and their effects on 
bio-composites are intertwined. Temperature, humidity, mechanical loadings, and 
even additional aging mechanisms are regularly coupled (Vauthier et al., 1998). In 
order to construct entirely biodegradable bio-composites without emitting poison￾ous or noxious components, benign materials should be expected to be used as a 
coupling agent. It’s crucial to investigate the impact of fiber and coupling agent pres￾ence on the thermal stability of extruded polypropylene composites. In this scenario, 
the coupling agent is largely concentrated at the polymer/fiber interface, where the 
polymeric component interacts with the hydrophobic polymer matrix and the maleic 
anhydride interacts with hydrophilic fibers, promoting adhesion between the two 
phases.
13.6.4 Marine Usage
Several studies have shown that bio-composites have potential marine appli￾cations due to their superior mechanical properties and biodegradability. As a Polyester-Based Bio-Composites for Marine Applications 243
result of these characteristics, bio-composites have evolved as a feasible alterna￾tive to synthetic fiber-reinforced composites. As bio-composites are biodegrad￾able, particular attention must be taken while integrating marine constructions. 
From small boats to submarines, composite materials have been widely utilized 
in marine structures.
13.6.5 Ferro-Cement
It’s a cement-based composite material with one or more layers of mesh and tiny 
diameter rods covered with cement mortar. It was arguably the first composite mate￾rial employed in the marine industry, and it was used to construct low-cost barges. 
Armature corrosion is a typical concern in chemically harsh marine environments, 
despite the fact that it is a low-cost composite. However, a few of ferro boats are still 
in operation today. It has a wide range of engineering qualities, including flexural 
strength, toughness, fatigue resistance, impact resistance, and fracture resistance.
13.7 GLASS-REINFORCED PLASTIC (FIBER GLASS)
Glass fibers were available after polyester resins were developed. Glass-reinforced 
plastic boats first appeared in the early 1950s and have remained a common marine 
composite construction approach to this day. It is strong, extremely light, and highly 
versatile, although fibers commonly used are GRP, and other fibers such as carbon, 
aramid, and basalt are also employed. The GRP composite’s surface is comprised of 
diamond-hard aluminum oxide aggregate, which has excellent long-term wear resis￾tance. GRP is extremely useful for its valuable properties in industries worldwide. 
Easy to shape, thermal insulation, anti-slip safety, weight ratio, high strength, fire 
retardancy, high energy absorption, chemical and corrosion resistance, good insula￾tion to heat and sound are some of the properties of GRP.
13.8 ADHESIVE COMPOSITES
For connecting fiber composites to themselves and a variety of substrates, cutting￾edge adhesive formulations are offered. To address the present requirement for com￾posite bonding, these adaptable adhesives are offered as liquids, pastes, and films. 
Even when exposed to harsh environments, they are engineered to provide the best 
physical strength and endurance. “Hot molded” and “cold molded” boat building 
methods based on putting thin wood veneers over a frame were created as a result 
of wartime necessity (Table 13.3). To help speed up the process and lessen depen￾dency on aluminum and steel, high-performance, urea-based adhesives have been 
employed successfully for molding naval hulls and in aircraft makeup. In bonded 
interfaces, impact/fracture toughness, tensile, compressive, creep, stress fracture, 
and shear properties are all outstanding. Thermal cycle resistance, cryogenic shock 
resistance, mechanical shock resistance, chemical resistance, low shrinkage, elec￾trical insulation, and serviceability in extreme temperatures are just a few of the 
benefits.244 Polyester-Based Biocomposites
13.9 ARAMID FIBER COMPOSITES
Aramid fibers are a type of synthetic organic polymer made by spinning a solid fiber 
from a liquid chemical combination, commonly utilized to reinforce sailboat parts 
such as the keel and bow sections. They also have better shock absorption properties, 
making them ideal for ocean sailing. All aramid fibers have tremendously strong and 
have a low density, resulting in a very high specific strength. Impact resistance is 
strong in all classes, and lower modulus grades are widely utilized in ballistic appli￾cations. The fibers are resistant to abrasion, chemical, and heat damage in addition 
to their great strength. However, if the fiber is exposed to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, 
it may eventually deteriorate.
13.10 CARBON FIBERS
It was rapidly being used in sailboats, super yacht furnishings, and highly ridged 
inner moldings because it provided stability and great effect while weighing less. 
Carbon fibers are an attractive material, and they are frequently substituted for the 
woven material’s aesthetics, due to their superior material properties. Boats with 
honeycomb or foam hulls, structural mounts, keels, masts, poles, booms, and carbon 
winches, drums, and shafting are made up of carbon fiber-reinforced epoxy com￾posites. In harsh sailing conditions, composites may aid to boost efficiency while 
minimizing the failure rate. Racing yachts use complex polymer composites more 
than any other marine structure to conserve weight and boost durability.
In comparable research, contemporary environmental problems like depletion 
and waste management must be considered on sailing yacht designs innovation. This 
leads to incorporation of natural fibers into the matrix, resulting in environmentally 
acceptable composite materials that might be used in marine applications. 
Furthermore, they have a high specific toughness and a small environmental imprint. 
For 2 years, the aging process of flax/PLA bio-composites was studied in natural 
saltwater. This research shows that bio-composites absorb a relatively substantial 
quantity of moisture, which is regulated by vegetal fibers (Le Duigou et al., 2014).

Controlling the aging of bio-composites in a marine habitat comprising both 
natural fiber and matrix is required. An additional coating layer of a comparable 
biopolymer on a bio-composite may improve weight loss through the interaction 
of fiber and matrix. The bio-composite’s immersion mechanical and thermal char￾acteristics demonstrate that the protective layers limit matrix hydrolysis, maintain 
composite qualities, and improve durability (Le Duigou et al., 2011). DuPont has 
created a marine composite Kevlar that is beneficial for providing an optimal blend 
of strength, rigidity, and lightweight qualities for a variety of nautical applications.1
This improves the greater speeds that may be obtained in patrol and service boats 
by boosting engine power. These Kevlar-based composites are lighter, and also harder, 
more damage-resistant, and perform much better during hydrodynamic fatigue load￾ing.2 Davies (2016) investigated the environmental destruction of composites used in 
highly loaded marine components, like tidal turbine blades or composite propellers; 
the use of composites is growing and necessitates a thorough understanding of the 
stress–seawater coupling. Rather than the theoretical framework, just a few experi￾mental data sets are accessible, and the effort is being spent on completing a few tests 
that require particular test equipment. More research is critically needed in this area.
The FRP composite material was first utilized marine construction for boats 
shortly after World War II. As wood became more scarce and expensive, boat design￾ers began to use FRP composites instead of timber, which was typically used in small 
nautical craft. Many boat builders and owners are moving away from wood since it 
is easily damaged by seawater and marine creatures, demanding expensive regular 
maintenance and repairs. The earliest attempts to make boat hulls and 12 small surf 
boats out of FRP composites were reported in 1947, for the United States Navy.
Despite the fact that sandwiched composites and modern FRP have carbon and 
aramid fibers along with vinyl ester or epoxy resin matrices, most marine ships are 
made of glass-reinforced polyester composites. They’re frequently employed in 
structural applications that required excellent performance. The interest in marine 
renewable energy sources is rising, and composite components like tidal turbine 
blades are playing a crucial part in this new industry. Marine composites are being 
pushed into new aspects of quality and structure due to extremely high cyclic loads 
and long-term immersion.
13.11 FIBER-REINFORCED POLYMER (FRP) COMPOSITES
FRPs have been widely employed in the boat manufacturing and marine construc￾tion sectors for decades since they are the most durable, workable, and cost-effec￾tive option. These materials offer a higher strength-to-weight ratio (specific tensile 
strength) than traditional materials and are more resistant to material corrosion as 
well as marine environmental factors like UV, seawater, organisms, and fatigue 
loading (Guersel and Neser, 2012; Mouritz et al., 2001). It has become necessary 
to build marine structures in a cost-effective manner while also assessing their life 
cycle. Researchers in the field of marine technology can identify appropriate mate￾rial solutions for the boatbuilding industry by investigating the behavior of FRPs in 
the marine environment. The intrinsic inhomogeneity of FRP and various distinc￾tive damage mechanisms, including matrix/fiber fracture, fiber/matrix debonding, 246 Polyester-Based Biocomposites
and inter-laminar delamination, as well as their intricate interactions (Marsh, 2010; 
Stewart, 2011).
FRPs have a number of additional benefits during the construction phase, such as 
the capacity to consolidate parts, lowering the number of parts, joints, fasteners, and 
manufacturing steps; offering significant weight savings and improved stability by 
lowering the center of gravity; and making it simpler to apply complex shapes, such 
as hulls, decks, and submarine fairings. (Guillermin, 2010). Fatigue characteristics 
are a key signal for the limit state in marine constructions susceptible to environmen￾tal cyclic loads, which must be considered by the designer concurrently nowadays. 
In comparison to metallic structural materials, the fatigue design approach for FRP 
is currently limited in terms of method availability and the inadequacy of available 
models to reliably characterize fatigue behavior.
13.12 GLASS-REINFORCED POLYMER-BASED COMPOSITES (GRP)
In addition to warships, high-performance materials are being utilized in civil appli￾cations. GRPs are used to make fishing boats, small boats, hovercraft, and catama￾rans all over the world. Yachts, sailboats, barges, and lifeboats are all examples of 
small boats that use GRP. GRP is the most widely used material, accounting for over 
80% of the hulls on ships up to 20m in length. GRP materials have significant weight 
and production cost advantages over steel, as well as low maintenance costs due to 
its extraordinary resistance to marine organisms and corrosion. The Dutch shipyards 
“Mulder and Rijke” have created a glass fiber/polyurethane composite lifeboat with 
improved flame resistance. The boat was engulfed in flames for 10 minutes in fire￾resistance testing, with an outside temperature of 816°C recorded, but with an inter￾nal temperature of only 15.5°C (Tekalur et al., 2008).
A hybrid glass/carbon fiber composite was used in one of the early versions of the 
composite mast to improve both ballistic performance and rigidity. When compared 
to an aluminum shaft of the same size, it reduces the weight of 20%±50%. The com￾posite shaft is more resistant to fatigue and corrosion, as well as vibration damping 
and air blast damage.
For excellent performance and safety, racing powerboats are highly composed of 
sophisticated and hybrid composites. Bennington-based Fothergill Composites Inc. 
has developed a safe cell cockpit made of carbon and aramid fibers with an aramid 
honeycomb core to safeguard the driver in all circumstances, especially in a high￾speed collision. This construction can endure a 100-foot fall without sustaining seri￾ous damage.
The materials utilized in the composite are commercially accessible, and the for￾mulation of the correct blend of fibers, resin, and laminate lay-up for marine applica￾tions provides the needed mechanical and environmental performance. Endurance 
testing in the marine habitat, as well as water uptake and fouling tests, are all part 
of the extensive development process. Glass or carbon fiber laminates are commonly 
used in composite propeller blades, although a thin layer of polyurethane, NAB, or 
stainless steel can be added to decrease impact damage. Although composite-based 
hubs have been realized, the FRP blades are normally bonded or connected to the 
metal hub of the propeller.Polyester-Based Bio-Composites for Marine Applications 247
Lightweight composite propellers have less inertia, resulting in faster accelera￾tion and deceleration rates, as well as increased speed and fuel economy. Hydro￾elastic tuning of the laminate might postpone the development of cavitation (Young, 
2008). Stiffness, strength, and fatigue performance are all essential mechanical 
attributes in this application. The construction was designed to be the stiffest over 
the blade’s length and robust enough to provide a large margin of safety over the 
design load. The composite was half as stiff as NAB in terms of material but 
had equivalent strength. The propeller’s structural rigidity was restored through 
enhanced design. During the test, the metal insert at the root also improved in 
terms of fatigue performance. NAB flaws caused the failure, but the composite was 
unaffected.
Reinforcing a resin with reinforcing elements such as carbon fibers, fiber-glasses, 
or aramid fibers produces composite materials that are substantially stronger and 
have improved material qualities for a number of applications. They have a stronger 
strength-to-weight ratio than typical wood or steel frames, and produce a consider￾able easier finish with less skills. There has been considerable caution about selecting 
systems that suit current requirements without risking future generations’ ability to 
meet their own.
13.13 CONCLUSION
Renewable bio-composites are used to make a variety of interior and exterior parts 
for autos, ships, sound-absorbing timber construction materials, and consumer prod￾ucts. Indeed, multiple studies have found that natural fiber reinforcement using as 
biopolymers has superior physical, thermal, and degradable qualities. Furthermore, 
incorporation of a compatibility agent may improve these qualities. However, as 
compared to other inorganic fillers, renewable bio-composites manufactured from 
bacterium cellulose, rice straw, rice husk, natural fiber, lignocellulose, cellulose, 
and paper sludge have a number of advantages. When compared to petroleum-based 
composites, bio-composites are the best and most environmentally beneficial option. 
Nonetheless, there remains a sense of traditionalism, if not outright refusal, to define 
polymer composite-based solutions for a variety of applications. This is owing to 
concerns about new ways to use old materials, as well as new and existing materials 
being used in novel applications. This suggests that more research is necessary to 
broaden the applicability and use of composite materials in marine industries.
In the case of thermoset composites, these materials are inappropriate that has 
restricted disposal alternatives at the end of their useful life (Singh et al., 2010). The 
usage of thermoplastic matrix composites, on the other hand, necessitates higher 
temperatures during manufacturing, potentially resulting in immediate global warm￾ing and climate change. Significant progress has been made in understanding the 
behavior of these materials and built buildings under mechanical, thermal, and fire￾induced load scenarios over this time. Processing and manufacturing considerations 
have also received a lot of attention, resulting in the capacity to build extremely com￾plicated, multi-material, massive, three-dimensional assemblies that can withstand 
tremendous loads. There are tons and tons of plastics and other waste being dumped 
into marine environments. If researchers focus on those recyclable materials for the 248 Polyester-Based Biocomposites
making of composites, they may be used in the production of various parts in marine 
applications and solve environmental issues as well.
Bio-composites are gaining traction in both worldwide research and cutting-edge 
applications, which is becoming increasingly concerned about environmental pres￾ervation and, as a result, the eco-compatibility of composite materials. Many studies 
have looked into the physical properties of natural fibers like sisal, jute, and palm 
fibers, as well as the interfacial performances of hydrophilic natural fibers and hydro￾phobic polymer matrices due to insufficient interfacial bonding (Dufresne, 2008; Li 
and Mai, 2006). Natural fibers such as hemp, flax, and jute are mixed with polymeric 
matrices from both renewable and non-renewable sources to create materials that are 
increasingly more competitive than standard composites.
Despite the fact that their manufacturing needs additional care, such as a specific 
interface between the bio-fiber and the matrix, and more complex processing steps, 
there is a mineral and synthetic reinforcement’s replacement with annually natural 
renewable fibers that has arisen as a result of public interest in environmental issues 
and awareness of future raw material exhaustion. Natural fibers in marine architec￾ture have piqued the interest of many specialists and yacht designers. The current 
European directives on the disposal of toxic waste, on the other hand, make this 
industry quite fascinating and deserving of further investigation.
Bio-composites have been proven to exhibit mechanical qualities comparable to 
glass fiber-reinforced composites. One of the most serious concerns to be solved is 
the hydrophilicity of these materials, which drastically restricts their use and the 
amount of fiber produced. Natural materials in the marine industry are important 
because of their inherent qualities; they can solve a variety of problems and increase 
performance. Natural reinforcements for composites in the maritime industry aren’t 
without their drawbacks. When selecting to employ vegetable fibers, one issue to 
consider is their suitability with the polymeric matrix that will sustain them. These 
procedures are currently being researched, and while many potential treatments were 
presented and tried, there are many components to be defined, as well as numerous 
alternatives to those that have already been tried.
Given the environmental benefits of adopting recyclable materials, extensive 
research is now being taken in this area to maximize longevity, regulate degrada￾tion, and mitigate inherent property losses. The development of next generation of 
composite materials, products, and processes should be guided by sustainability, 
industrial ecology, eco-efficiency, and eco-friendly manner under new legislation. 
Glass fiber-reinforced composites are being replaced with bio-composites (natural/
bio-fiber). Although there is still a long way to completely “green” composites, the 
road to innovation is teeming with new technologies and products.

14.1 INTRODUCTION
Polyester resin belongs to the class of polymer materials, commonly referred to as 
‘laminating resin’ or ‘fibreglass resin’ (Cook, 2001). In general terms, it is referred to 
as ‘unsaturated polyester resin’ (UPR). Polymer materials comprise foams, epoxies, 
polyesters and silicon resins largely used in the construction and building industry.

The ease in usage and being cheaper than epoxies/urethanes make it an economical 
component used in a wide range of industrial components (Chandrasekar et al., 2020; 
Senthilkumar et al., 2021; Alothman et al., 2020). This material offers incredible 
physical and chemical properties, making its performance superior and a choice of 
the construction sector (Plank, 2005). The main characteristics of these materials 
involve gain in strength at a faster rate, very high abrasion/chemical/corrosion/heat 
resistance and excellent impact and compressive strength. The lower styrene emis￾sion rates and application-ready viscosity responses allow the mass-scale usage and 
consumption of these materials (Crawford and Throne, 2002; Vanderlaan and Forster, 
1988). Polyesters are consumed in the construction sector in anchoring grouts, resin 
mortars and concrete additives, coatings, electrical insulation and lighting sealants, 
bridge building high-tension and strong ropes and power belts. Characteristic￾based classification of the polyester material forms the following classes:(1) flexible 
polyester, (2) chemical-resistant polyester, (3) general purpose and speciality poly￾ester, (4) low-styrene emission polyester and (5) drinking water-compliant polyester. 
Construction and buildings are one of the highest consuming segments of polyester 
materials along with the electrical and transport sectors. The expected yearly growth 
of the polyester resin market from 2019 to 2027 is 6.3%, creating a market size 
of more than USD 19 billion by 2027 (Unsaturated Polyester Resin Market Size | 
Industry Report, 2027, n.d.).
There is a tremendous growth expected in the construction industry which war￾rants the huge demand for construction resources (García-Gonzále et al., 2020; 
Ślosarczyk et al., 2020). The anchoring grouts are used in drilled or formed holes 
in various construction instances such as concrete, masonry or natural rock. These 
anchoring grouts are made of polyester and are used for securing bolts, bars, tendons 
or dowels (Thomas et al., 2021; Senthilkumar et al., 2015, 2022; Nasimudeen et al., 
2021). Anchoring grouts made from polyester composites feature rapid installation, 
rapid strength gain and a high degree of corrosion protection (Lim et al., 2009). 
Polyester-based coatings are used in the construction industry to provide a barrier for 
concrete and steel substrates, particularly in mineral acid resistance. These coatings 
are also useful in tank linings, floors and sewage treatment plant pipeline systems 
(Bouzit et al., 2022). The next application of polyesters in the construction industry 
is concreting. The concretes realized from polyesters are applied as a repair material 
similar to epoxy mortars. Composites are developed with phases of materials from 
biological sources, glass cloth or glass flakes (Shahroze et al. 2021; Chandrasekar 
et al., 2022a). The challenge of using this material is the limited pot-life, thermal 
contraction and volume shrinkage during the cure. Owing to its rapid strength gain 
capacities, the polyester concrete is used in bridge decks for galvanic corrosion pro￾tection, subsequent cracking and spalling of the concrete, for airport runway main￾tenance and the installation of runway lights, and as a filler in cable slots cut across 
asphalt runways and also to fill over PVC cable ducts installed in concrete runways. 
Loop and lightning sealants made from polyester composites are used in road traf￾fic signal controllers and inductance loops, airport runway lighting and automatic 
barriers or gates sealing horizontal cable slots in concrete and asphalt pavements. 
Features of rapid cure to form a tough resilient seal with a flexible degree of move￾ment, without the need of a primer, adhesion in dry or damp conditions to concrete, Polyester-Based Biocomposites for Building and Construction Applications 255
and resistance to various ambient attacks make them suitable for such applications 
(Al-Haydari et al., 2021; Halil Akın and Polat, 2022; Pothan et al., 2003; Tabatabai 
et al., 2018). Cement is one of the highest consumed key components in the construc￾tion industry. The production of cement is not environmentally friendly and accounts 
for nearly 10% of global carbon emissions (Marrero et al., 2017). With time, the 
problems associated with the concrete such as non-eco-friendly, harmful environ￾mental potential, low durability, low post-cracking capacity, brightness and limited 
fatigue life are rising (Noori et al., 2021). The substitute materials with appropri￾ate mechanical, physical and thermal performance characteristics are required to 
replace cement simultaneously controlling the final product cost.
Agro-originated biopolymers, i.e., starch, are generally cheaper, biodegradable 
and renewable materials with potential as a substitute for non-biodegradable syn￾thetic polymers (Avérous, 2007; Ślosarczyk et al., 2020; Verma et al., 2022). The 
inherent limitations such as poor mechanical properties compared to conventional 
thermoplastics, long post-processing ageing and high hygroscopicity hinder the pos￾sibility of using these materials. The multiphase composite materials are considered 
to overcome these drawbacks (Okonkwo et al., 2020; Reddy et al., 2013; Xie et al., 
2013). Biodegradable co-polyesters such as poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) 
exhibit good mechanical performance and higher elongation at break than synthetic 
polymers explored in these situations (Fukushima et al., 2012; Mohanty and Nayak, 
2012). The resultant biocomposite materials with a high interface area leading to 
strong nanofiller–polymer interactions, higher dispersion, and improved mechanical, 
thermal and barrier properties exhibit improved behaviour along with the biodegrad￾ability eliminating the possibility of any (eco)toxic effects (Ali et al., 2021; Mini 
et al., 2022; Rivera-Gómez and Galán-Marín, 2017). Lignocellulosic fibres obtained 
from natural sources, i.e., hemp fibre, are studied as a potential material in civil con￾struction applications as polymer composite reinforcement in substitution of energy￾intensive and non-recyclable synthetic fibres (Islam and Ahmed, 2018; Sanjay et al., 
2018). The qualification criteria such as mechanical properties, tensile strength and 
modulus create a possibility of creating stronger thermoset polymeric matrices using 
polyester (Callister and Rethwisch, 2018).
The scientific community is particularly working on various aspects of the con￾struction industry, as it is consuming a high amount of total energy in the world. The 
research frontiers include finding possible solutions towards enhanced thermal insu￾lation of building envelope, optimizing the building’s energy performance, acousti￾cal design and sustainable green concrete, reducing the use of conventional Portland 
cement and withstanding the adverse environmental conditions. In this scenario, 
the present chapter begins with a brief description of the polyester materials, useful 
properties and various applications of polyesters in the construction industry and 
market volume as an introduction to the topic. Then chapter proceed towards the 
discussion of the latest updates and reflections about the fibres used in construction 
and buildings, various blends of polymer resins, characteristics of natural fibres and 
mechanical properties of polyester-based biocomposites used in the construction and 
building industry. Finally, in order to stimulate ideas among readers about the new 
applications of polyester materials in building products, this chapter concludes with 
a discussion of future prospects.256 Polyester-Based Biocomposites
14.2 POLYESTER-BASED BIOCOMPOSITES AS 
A CONSTRUCTION MATERIAL
Polyester-based biocomposites are gaining importance nowadays for building and 
construction applications. Polyester-based biocomposites possess good strength and 
toughness, as they have low density and exhibit good specific properties. The com￾posites which are used for building and construction applications are supposed to 
have good functional and structural stability during the end-use applications and 
resistance to various environmental factors (Conzatti et al., 2012). A trend of green 
building is focusing on the use of biocomposite as the main material. Polyester-based 
biocomposites are replacing many synthetic composite materials because of the 
negative impact of synthetic composites on the environment (Chandrasekar et al., 
2022b). For the building and construction applications, various parts such as doors, 
windows, fencing and roofing are biocomposites. The polymer biocomposites are 
petroleum-based synthetic polymers (polyester, phenolics, epoxy, polyethylene, poly￾propylene, etc.) reinforced with natural fibres. Biocomposites can be biopolymers 
(e.g., polylactic acid) reinforced with natural fibres. Also, it can be biopolymers rein￾forced with synthetic fibres (e.g., kevlar fibre, glass fibre, etc.). The polyester-based 
biocomposites used for building and construction applications can be classified as 
structural and non-structural. Polyester-based biocomposites are gaining worldwide 
attention because of their low weight and manufacturing cost.
UPR is the liquid polymer matrix synthesized by condensation polymerization 
using dicarboxylic acid (phthalic acid/anhydride) reacting with polyhydric alcohol 
and unsaturated dicarboxylic acid. The viscosity of UPR is reduced with the help 
of a styrene monomer. The styrene monomer reacts with the double bond of UPR 
to form a cross-linked structure. Cobalt octate/cobalt is used as a curing agent along 
with methyl ethyl ketone peroxide (MEKP). Cobalt octate act as an accelerator while 
MEKP work as an initiator. The ratio between them and their percentage played an 
important role in deciding curing time with the exothermic behaviour of the ther￾mosetting polyesters. Cobalt can be used in the range of 0.05%–1% (Mohd Nurazzi 
et al., 2017; Kuppusamy and Neogi, 2014). The excess use of styrene monomer in the 
UPR may lead to phase separation between them. Thus, 30%–40% of styrene mono￾mer can be used commercially with UPR (Hsu and Lee, 1993). The use of biobased 
polyester composite in the building and construction industry is playing an important 
role in replacing concrete and metal materials (Keller, 2003).
14.3 BLENDS OF POLYESTER RESIN
As the individual polyester polymer matrix could not provide the mechanical and 
other properties required for the specific application, polyester can be blended with 
another polymer or copolymer, which remains together physically to exhibit the 
desired mechanical and other functional properties. After curing, the glass transition 
temperature of unsaturated polyester increases, and due to high crosslinking it shows 
brittleness, which is a major reason to limit it for engineering and may be for building 
and construction applications. Therefore, using a blend of polyester resin is a suitable 
way to achieve the performance more cheaply (Cherian and Thachil, 2001).Polyester-Based Biocomposites for Building and Construction Applications 257
14.4 UPR-EPOXY BLEND
Reactive blending is used to prepare a blend of UPR-epoxy resin. Both the resins are 
compatible with each other as they have good miscibility. Their blends have improved 
thermal, mechanical and weather resistance properties. Bioepoxies in the form of 
epoxidized oil can be used to blend with UPR. The blending of epoxidized oil in 
UPR reduces its crosslinking density and ultimately the glass transition temperature. 
It has been observed that modulus decreases but the impact properties increase in 
this type of blending (Mustapha et al., 2014).
14.5 UPR-PHENOLIC RESIN BLEND
This blend can be used when fire resistance is required for building and construc￾tion applications. Phenolic resins possess good flammability resistance, whereas 
UPR is highly flammable and generates toxic fumes on combustion. Therefore, the 
blend of UPR and phenol-formaldehyde exhibits good fire resistance properties with 
low smoke generation on burning. After curing the phenolic resins form a thermally 
stable cross-link structure which helps to improve its heat and fire resistance. Their 
blend also shows compatibility with a natural fibre like kenaf, which is a polyester￾based biocomposite with good thermal and somewhat low mechanical properties 
(Mohd Mahadar et al., 2016).
14.6 UPR-NATURAL RUBBER BLEND
It has been observed from the studies that the blend of UPR with natural rubber shows 
improved impact properties but reduced modulus in specific conditions (Hameed, 
2012). Natural rubber is available at a low cost, possessing good mechanical and 
abrasion resistance properties with poor resistance to oil. Mechanical mixing can 
be used to blend UPR with natural rubber. As the natural rubber is elastomeric and 
imparts impact, fracture and toughness resistance to its blend with UPR.
14.7 UPR-VINYL ESTER (VE) BLEND
The UPR-VE blend can be prepared by blending them mechanically, followed by 
curing at atmospheric temperature conditions using MEKP. Their blend shows good 
thermal and physical properties (Ardhyananta et al., 2017). UPR-VE blend is a low 
cost material that can be used to produce composites for building and construction 
applications with enhanced tensile and stiffness properties.
14.8 FIBRES USED IN CONSTRUCTION AND 
BUILDING COMPOSITES
Looking forward to the negative effect of non-degradable polymer matrix compos￾ites on the environment, various countries are emphasizing to use of biocomposites 
for building, construction, automotive and other applications (Gupta et al., 2011). 
The use of natural fibres as a reinforcing agent makes the polymer matrix composite 258 Polyester-Based Biocomposites
a biocomposite. Natural fibres are derived from bio-resources and are biodegrad￾able, cheap, eco-friendly, non-toxic, high specific strength and lightweight (Lee et al., 
2012; Gupta et al., 2015). But they have poor mechanical and thermal resistance and 
high water absorption, brittleness and flammability properties (Bajpai et al., 2013). 
The natural fibre-based polyester composite exhibits a moderate strength-to-weight 
ratio and good impact resistance properties, while the use of synthetic fibres such 
as glass, carbon, Kevlar and boron as a reinforcement makes them expensive. Also, 
synthetic fibres are non-degradable by biological means, which causes pollution.
Plant fibres are renewable and cellulosic. Various natural fibres such as sisal, 
kenaf, hemp, jute, coir, bamboo, sugarcane and banana. are used as a reinforcing 
agent in UPR for building and construction applications.
From Figure 14.1, it is found that the natural fibres of about 26% are used for 
building and construction applications.
Figure 14.2 shows the development of natural fibre used in polymer matrix com￾posites. The fibres obtained from the plant or animal resources are known as bio￾fibres. They may be short or long fibres. Fibres having a length-to-diameter ratio 
greater than 100 are known as long fibres, while those less than 100 are called short 
fibres. The plant fibres are obtained from the plant stem or leaf. Cellulose, hemicel￾lulose and lignin are the important constituents of plant fibres. Cellulose is nothing 
but a natural polymer and is crystalline in nature containing hydroxyl groups. It has 
a degree of polymerization of about 1000. The bio-fibres have advantages in terms 
of environment, biological, production, economic and general aspects. They show 
CO2 neutrality and can degrade biologically. Bio-fibres do not have any issue related

to skin itching while handling them as compared to glass fibres. Also, they are low 
cost and renewable as compared to glass fibres and other synthetic fibres. The direct 
use of plant fibres as reinforcement in the polyester matrix may have poor interfacial 
properties. Hence, the plant fibres need alkali treatment to have proper adhesion with 
the polymer matrix. The coupling agents such as silane can also be used to improve 
the fibre–matrix interfacial properties and ultimately the mechanical properties of 
biocomposites. The chemical treatment helps to improve the surface tension, surface 
properties and removal of undesired components from plant fibres. As the plant fibres 
contain cellulose and hydroxyl groups, they are hygroscopic in nature, which may 
be a challenge while processing them and utilizing them for end-use application. 
Various factors such as type of fibre, fibre composition, fibre orientation, properties 
of fibre and type of polymer matrices affect the properties of biocomposite. Along 
with the advantageous properties, biocomposites have some disadvantages as well. 
Dimensional instability, moisture absorption, limited biological resistance, limited 
strength, low UV and fire resistance are some of the major disadvantages of biocom￾posites obtained from natural fibres. Some plant fibres are discussed in the following 
subsections.
14.9 COIR FIBRE
It is obtained from coconut and is available easily at low cost. It is non-toxic and 
mainly contains cellulose 36%–43%, hemicellulose 0.15%–0.25% and lignin 41%–
45%. It has poor adhesion with the polymer matrix because of its high fibrillar angle 
and lignin content. Therefore, it is treated with alkali for proper adhesion with the 
polymer matrix (Geethamma et al., 1998).
FIGURE 14.2 Natural fibre development for composite applications. (Shireesha and 
Nandipati, 2019.)260 Polyester-Based Biocomposites
14.10 HEMP FIBRE
It is obtained from the hemp plant. They are cellulosic fibres and possess good 
strength. Due to the absorption of moisture, its tensile and flexural strength decreases 
and reduces fibre–matrix adhesion. It requires alkali treatment to modify surface 
properties and the use of maleated coupling agents to enhance interfacial adhesion 
between fibres and polymer matrix (Dhakal et al., 2007).
14.11 JUTE FIBRE
It is also a cellulosic fibre containing microfibrils. Due to the presence of cellulose, 
it absorbs moisture and can cause an increase in the density of composite material. 
They are cheaper and lightweight. Due to poor adhesion with the polymer matrix, 
they also need chemical treatment. The alkali treatment improves the crystallinity 
of jute fibres, which helps to enhance their adhesion with the polymer matrix. The 
alkali treatment helps to improve the mechanical properties of the jute fibres (Shaikh 
and Channiwala, 2010; Wang et al., 2008).
14.12 NATURAL FIBRE CHARACTERISTICS
Almost 30% of natural fibres are produced per year and used as a constituent in vari￾ous applications such as building materials, automotive, packaging, sports equipment, 
paper-making, clothing, etc.(Jawaid and Khalil, 2015; Asim et al., 2015). Due to its 
density and eco-friendly nature over traditional composites, natural fibres have become 
a material of interest for the industries (Asim et al., 2015). While selecting the natural 
fibres for building and construction applications, one of the most important properties, 
i.e., mechanical characteristics, should always be considered. These characteristics dif￾fer in natural fibres and mainly depend on the type of natural fibre, chemical composi￾tion, growth conditions and structural strength. As compared with synthetic fibres, 
natural fibres exhibit poor mechanical properties. Nevertheless, the main advantages 
include low health risk, low density, low cost, non-abrasiveness, non-irritating to skin, 
renewability, recyclability and biodegradability (Malkapuram et al., 2008; Ku et al., 
2011; Asim et al., 2021; Arumugam et al., 2020; Odesanya et al., 2021). When com￾pared to synthetic fibres, their processing is more environmentally friendly, resulting in 
improved working conditions and a lower risk of dermatological or respiratory disor￾ders. Natural fibres’ most intriguing feature is their favourable environmental impact. 
Natural fibres have a lower density (1.6 g/cm3
) than glass fibre (2.5 g/cm3
), allowing for 
lighter composites to be produced. Natural fibres have a number of disadvantages over 
synthetic fibres, including non-uniformity, a wide range of diameters and mechani￾cal qualities (Bismarck et al., 2005). As a result, developing high-performance natural 
fibre/polymer composites is a crucial problem to be solved in order to increase natu￾ral fibre adoption as a quality alternative to conventional reinforcing fibres (John and 
Thomas, 2008; Akil et al., 2011). Fibres of various types, spanning from long-continu￾ous to short-discontinuous, have been employed to reinforce composites. The proper￾ties of natural fibre-reinforced polymer composites are determined by each component 
in the composite, namely the reinforcing fibres and resin matrix (Md Shah et al., 2019).Polyester-Based Biocomposites for Building and Construction Applications 261
Natural fibres often have a high amount of hydroxyl groups, making them polar 
and hydrophilic in nature (Wambua et al., 2003). Most plastics, on the other hand, are 
hydrophobic by nature. As a result, one of the major disadvantages of natural fibres/
polymers composites is the incompatibility of hydrophilic natural fibres with hydro￾phobic thermoplastic matrices, which results in unfavourable composite properties 
(Asim et al., 2021). Natural fibres’ polar nature causes natural fibre-based composites 
to absorb a lot of moisture, causing fibre swelling and voids in the fibre–matrix inter￾phase. Moisture will result in a porous product if it is not removed from natural fibres 
prior to compounding by drying. Mechanical qualities may deteriorate and dimen￾sional stability may be lost as a result of excessive moisture absorption (Alvarez et al., 
2004). To strengthen the adhesion between fibre and matrix while reducing their ability 
to absorb moisture, it is essential to modify the fibre surface using chemical modifica￾tions (Malkapuram, Kumar, and Singh Negi, 2008; Li et al., 2020). The fibre content/
amount of filler can also influence the characteristics of natural fibre-reinforced poly￾mer composites. As a result, the impact of fibre content on the characteristics of natural 
fibre-reinforced composites is quite important. The processing parameters utilized are 
another essential component that has a considerable impact on the composites’ prop￾erties and interfacial properties (Ku et al., 2011). When natural fibres are heated over 
200°C, they degrade, limiting the types of plastics that can be utilized as a matrix 
(Bismarck et al., 2005; Akil et al., 2011). As a result, the best processing processes and 
parameters must be carefully chosen to produce the best composite products.
14.13 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE TRENDS
Polyester-based biocomposites have found a vital place in construction applications, 
and a wide range of products is now being used, with significant sales turnover. 
Moreover, this trend will further increase with the expansion of the construction 
industry. The availability challenges with conventional materials technology shift 
will alter the demands of lignosulfonate, lignite, concrete and gypsum products. 
This vacuum will possibly be filled by various polymer derivatives with an expected 
requirement for more sophisticated building products. Reason supplementing to this 
situation is rapid deployment of modern tools and technology such as machine plas￾tering in the place of the conventional building methods. The shift from a labour￾intensive strategy to an automated approach to construction using prefabricated 
building materials created the need for various novel materials. Polyester-based bio￾composites have a perceived advantage over synthetic materials. Being convinced of 
‘bio’ needs to be confirmed and practised as being environmentally more preferable. 
The conventional materials used in the construction industry are currently under 
scanner for potential health risks for their products. Therefore, polyester-based bio￾composites are possibly non-toxic, emission-free alternatives. Before mass-scale use 
of these materials, there is a need for a set of standards to qualify recycling criteria, 
minimizing the need to dispose of building materials. The main requirement of the 
construction industry is the admixtures allowing the economic, high-quality mate￾rials which are compatible with modern tools and technology, without sacrificing 
environmental aspects. It is conclusive to assume that polyester-based biocomposites 
will make a major contribution to this target.262 Polyester-Based Biocomposites

15.1 INTRODUCTION
The principal functions of food packaging are to ensure the safety and quality of 
food and prolong the shelf life of products (Moustafa et al., 2019). Polymers that 
contain the ester functional group in their main chain are called polyesters. These 
polymers can be natural or synthetic, aliphatic, semi-aromatic, or aromatic. In addi￾tion, polyesters are adaptable and diverse and can be rigid or soft, opaque or trans￾parent thermoset, or thermoplastic. This characteristic allows them to transform 
into various shapes and sizes of films or containers. As essential properties of food 
packaging, they include a barrier to gases, aromatic compounds and water vapors, 
mechanical strength, and thermal stability. Polyesters have these predefined prop￾erties, so they have a high demand for these packaging materials. Main examples 
include polycaprolactone (PCL), poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB), poly(glycolic acid) 
(PGA), poly(lactic acid) (PLA), polybutylene adipate-co-terephthalate (PBAT), and 
polyethylene terephthalate (PET) (Hamid & Samy, 2021; Kausar, 2019).

Most polyesters are not biodegradable and are referred to as persistent pollutants in 
many environmental niches. As a result, there is growing interest in developing sus￾tainable materials to alleviate environmental pollution due to these polymers. Thus, 
environmental pollution caused by polyesters has encouraged the development of sus￾tainable materials to reduce the effects of plastic pollution (Hamid & Samy, 2021). In 
this context, biopolymers are potential substitutes for petroleum-based polyesters due 
to their biodegradability, compatibility, and renewability properties. Biopolymers can 
be classified as natural biopolymers, chemically synthesized biodegradable polymers, 
and polymers of microbial origin (Moreira et al., 2022; Vinod et al., 2020). Besides, 
biopolymers allow the incorporation of a variety of additives such as antifungals, anti￾oxidants, antimicrobials, and dyes (Maftoonazad & Ramaswamy, 2018).
The growing consumer demand for safe food has encouraged research in new 
technologies such as intelligent and active food packaging systems. In the first sys￾tem, biologically active compounds are added to the packaging material to ensure 
food preservation. In the second, food quality information is obtained with an indi￾cator external or internal to the packaging (Moustafa et al., 2019; Priyadarshi et al., 
2021). Currently, food packaging combines various materials and technologies to 
take advantage of functional characteristics or design properties and ensure product 
quality and freshness during distribution and storage (Hamid & Samy, 2021).
A polyester composite consists of material composed of a polymer matrix with 
reinforcing fillers integrated into this matrix, resulting in synergistic chemical, phys￾ical, and mechanical properties (Wang et al., 2017). Biocomposites are materials 
obtained from natural and renewable sources. These biomaterials combine the opti￾mized functional properties of composites with the environmental appeal of biopoly￾mers (Abdulkhani et al., 2020). However, the use of polyester-based biocomposites in 
food packaging is limited to industrial application due to mechanical properties and 
relatively weak barriers (Tyagi et al., 2021).
Polyester-based bionanocomposites consist of a biopolymer matrix reinforced 
with nanofillers (Arora et al., 2018). Nanofillers can increase the surface area of the 
biocomposite material. Nanomaterials can improve the functionality of polyester￾based food packaging, improving the barrier, mechanical, optical, and thermal 
properties (Priyadarshi et al., 2021). Despite the advantages, there is great concern 
regarding the migration of nanomaterials to food through the packaging material. 
Moreover, there is a growth in interest to develop biocompatible, safe, and non-toxic 
nanostructures. Therefore, more research is needed to investigate the toxic poten￾tial and immunogenic effects of these nano-bionanocomposites (Bajpai et al., 2018; 
Priyadarshi et al., 2021). Based on this, the chapter addresses the potential of polyes￾ter-based biocomposites for the development of food packaging materials, focusing 
on strategies to improve their properties through nanotechnological approaches.
15.2 MAIN POLYESTERS APPLIED IN FOOD PACKAGING
PCL is a polyester extracted from fossil sources, with ring-opening polymerization 
of ε-caprolactone and an average molecular weight between 3000 and 90,000 g/mol 
(Li et al., 2021; Ma et al., 2020). The tensile strength of bulk PCL is about 25–43MPa 
and the modulus of elasticity is about 330–360MPa. The mechanical characteristics Polyester-Based Biocomposites for Food Packaging Applications 271
and adjusting physicochemical properties contribute to PCL resistance to physical, 
chemical, and mechanical aggressions without significantly losing its properties 
(Dwivedi et al., 2019). PCL is compatible with other polymers to form polymeric 
blends and overcomes mechanical limitations. In polymer blends, PCL would act as 
the majority phase. The other polymer, preferably with a more rigid character, would 
function as the dispersed phase (Schmatz et al., 2019; Terra et al., 2021a, b). Another 
crucial property of PCL is its high solubility in organic solvents due to the hydro￾phobic methylene fractions in its repeating units (Dwivedi et al., 2019). Furthermore, 
PCL is non-toxic and compatible with human cells and tissues and is considered safe 
by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to develop food packaging materials 
(Malik, 2020).
PLA polymer is a linear aliphatic polyester obtained by fermentation from natural 
sources (Jem & Tan, 2020; Sanusi et al., 2020). The solubility properties of amor￾phous PLA are high in organic solvents such as chlorinated and acetonitrile (Buhecha 
et al., 2019). PLA is also biodegradable and biocompatible with human cells and are 
Generally Recognized as Safe certified by the FDA (Gigante et al., 2019; Malek 
et al., 2021). When processed PLA is exposed to natural environments with high tem￾peratures and humidity, it is gradually hydrolyzed to form carbon dioxide (CO2) and 
water (Kalita et al., 2021). The barrier properties to water vapor, gases, and organic 
substances of PLA are poor (Jin et al., 2018; Sari et al., 2021). Thus, its processability 
is restricted, making it necessary to formulate polymeric blends (Khatsee et al., 2018; 
Mohandesnezhad et al., 2020; Moreira et al., 2018a).
PGA is a linear aliphatic polyester, which has high crystallinity and mechanical 
strength, good gas barrier properties, and low deformation resistance. PGA also has low 
solubility in organic solvents; however, it is soluble in fluorinated solvents such as hexa￾fluoroisopropanol and water (Samantaray et al., 2020). Due mainly to its high hydro￾philicity, the formation of polymeric blends with this polyester becomes an alternative 
(Jem & Tan, 2020; Wang et al., 2021a, b). In addition to being miscible in the formation 
of polymer blends, PGA is also compostable and has high biodegradation rates. The 
biodegradation rate is high (~1month at 30°C) when compared to other biodegradable 
polyesters such as PCL (2–3years) (Gentile et al., 2014; Jem & Tan, 2020; Samantaray 
et al., 2020). The biodegradation of PGA occurs through slow chemical hydrolysis in an 
aqueous environment, which may have a better adjunct efficiency to enzymatic cataly￾sis (Samantaray et al., 2020). PGA is also considered non-toxic and biocompatible with 
human cells and tissues. This biopolymer can be used as a matrix for human tissue 
regeneration, drug carrier, and packaging materials (Guido et al., 2021).
PHB is a short-chain biological polyester belonging to the family of polyhydroxy￾alkanoate. PHB is an aliphatic monomer produced by bacteria that use glucose, 
sucrose, and lactose as carbon sources to obtain this polymer (Atakav et al., 2021). 
In addition, studies show that microalgae (Kamravamanesh et al., 2019; Silva et al., 
2018) also synthesize PHB as an energy reserve. PHB has high crystallinity, rigidity, 
and resistance to deformation. The high crystallinity of PHB also contributes to its 
low water solubility and good gas barrier (Santos et al., 2017). Another property of 
PHB is its biodegradability, which can be either by aerobic or anaerobic biological 
means. However, this biopolymer is miscible in organic solvents such as chloroform 
and has low processability due to low thermal stability. Thus, plasticizers are used 272 Polyester-Based Biocomposites
to overcome this limitation (Moreira et al., 2022). In addition, nanotechnological 
approaches, such as the fabrication of nanocomposites and nanofibers, have been 
used to contribute to the thermal properties of PHB (Garcia-Garcia et al., 2018; 
Jayakumar et al., 2020; Kuntzler et al., 2018). PHB can be applied both in the medi￾cal field and in the food industry, as it is FDA-approved, non-toxic, and biocompat￾ible with human cells and tissues (Chen & Zhang, 2017; Moreira et al., 2022).
PBAT is a synthetic aliphatic-aromatic thermoplastic copolyester based on fossil 
resources (Pavon et al., 2020; Rodrigues et al., 2016). The excellent biodegradability 
characteristic of PBAT is related to the aliphatic unit in the molecule chain (Jian 
et al., 2020; Rodrigues et al., 2016). PBAT has good thermal stability and mechani￾cal properties similar to some polyethylenes. This polyester also has more flexibility 
than other biodegradable polyesters such as PLA and PHB, making it interesting for 
packaging applications (Fukushima et al., 2012; Jian et al., 2020). However, the pro￾duction costs of PBAT are high (Pavon et al., 2020). In this way, the addition of low￾cost materials (natural fibers) is an alternative to improve the economic viability of 
processing this polymer. In addition, the reinforcement with biomaterials contributes 
to some polymer properties, maintaining the material’s biodegradability. Melt blend￾ing (extrusion or injection molding) is considered one of the most commonly applied 
techniques for developing PBAT-based composites (Ferreira et al., 2019).
PET is the most common semi-crystalline and transparent thermoplastic in the 
polyester family (Singh et al., 2021). The polymeric film developed with PET for 
food packaging material features lightweight, high tensile strength, excellent chemi￾cal resistance, elasticity, and thermal stability (−60°C to 220°C) (Robertson, 2014). 
Despite the various applications of PET, the inappropriate disposal of this polyester 
in the environment harms the marine ecosystem (Singh et al., 2021). On the other 
hand, PET is one of the most recycled polymers worldwide. In this sense, research 
has investigated the recycling of post-consumer PET waste and the properties of 
composite materials produced from recycled PET (Ragaert et al., 2017; Raheem 
et al., 2019; Nasir et al., 2022; Singh et al., 2021).
15.3 MECHANICAL AND BARRIER PROPERTIES OF 
POLYESTER-BASED BIOCOMPOSITES
Knowledge of the mechanical properties of materials used in food packaging is cru￾cial to protect food against physical damage and control mass transfers that act in the 
degradation of products (Berthet et al., 2015). To be applied in packaging, the mate￾rial must have some characteristics, including tensile strength, elongation at break, 
and modulus of elasticity (Ahmad et al., 2016). The mechanical properties of com￾posites are related to the constituent reinforcement and matrix’ properties. The trans￾fer of forces applied to the material depends on relatively strong interfacial bonds, as 
weak interfaces can influence the integrity of the composite (De Rosa et al., 2009). 
Studies demonstrate that the nanostructures addition to the polymer matrix develops 
bionanocomposites with improved mechanical and barrier properties for application 
in food packaging (Table 15.1).
The barrier properties of packaging influence food quality during its shelf life 
(Berthet et al., 2015). Oxygen (O2) is one of the main ones responsible for degradation Polyester-Based Biocomposites for Food Packaging Applications 273 TABLE 15.1 Studies on Polyester-Based Bionanocomposites Polymer Type of Reinforcement Method Principal Results Reference PLA Cellulose nanowhisker (NWC) Solvent casting The incorporation of 1% NWC improved the mechanical properties, including tensile strength (21.22MPa) and tensile modulus (11.35MPa). Sucinda et al. (2021) PLA Nanoclay added to the antimicrobial agents cinnamaldehyde (Ci) and thymol (Thy) Supercritical impregnation with CO2 Young’s modulus reduction (close to 86% and 77% for thymol- impregnated bionanocomposites and nanoclay-added films, respectively). Villegas et al. (2017) PLA/PHB Cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) Electrospinning The addition of 1% by weight of CNC increased the values of modulus and tensile strength (E

Schmatz et al. (2019) PBAT/PLA Nano-polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS(epoxy)8) Twin-screw extrusion The addition of POSS (epoxy 8) increased the mechanical performance of the films in the longitudinal and transverse directions. Higher tensile strength was obtained in the materials with 1% by weight of POSS (epoxy 8) (30MPa longitudinal strength and 20MPa transverse strength). Qiu et al. (2021) PLA Titanium dioxide (TiO2) Electrospinning and casting Maximum tensile strengths of 2.71±0.11MPa and 14.49±0.13MPa for the nanofibers and films, respectively, with a TiO2 content of 0.75% by weight. Feng et al. (2019) PLA TiO2 nanoparticles Casting method The tensile strength of the PLA/TiO2 composites increased by 63.3MPa at a TiO2 content of 0.6% by weight. Li et al. (2020) PHB Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) Biological synthesis by Bacillus megaterium Increased mechanical properties of PHB-AgNps compared to pure PHB, such as elongation at break, tensile strength, and Young’s modulus, by 1.305%, 35.42 and 1.058 N/mm2, respectively.

reactions that occur in food. The presence of this gas can promote the oxidation of 
several compounds that compromise the sensory and nutritional characteristics of 
foods. Oxygen also favors the emergence of microorganisms and acts in the mat￾uration process of fresh products (Jafarzadeh & Jafari, 2021). CO2 influences the 
inhibition of the respiration rate of microorganisms. Thus, CO2 is considered a bac￾teriostatic and fungistatic agent. The rate of transmission of this gas or permeability 
should be a criterion for choosing the used material in food packaging (Berthet et al., 
2015). The control of moisture permeability in packaging is also of great importance 
to control the growth of microorganisms that promote aerobic spoilage and preserve 
the sensory characteristics of the food (Jafarzadeh & Jafari, 2021).
Fortunati et al. (2012) evaluated the barrier properties of PLA nanocomposites 
added with cellulose nanocrystals, developed by the solvent casting method. The 
authors investigated the incorporation of pure (CNC) and surfactant-modified cellu￾lose nanocrystals (s-CNC) into the polymer matrix. Films containing 1% by weight 
s-CNC showed a 34% reduction in water permeability. On the other hand, bion￾anocomposites with 5wt% surfactant-modified CNC (PLA/5s-CNC) had the highest 
reduction in oxygen transfer rate.
Díez-Pascual and Díez-Vicente (2014) incorporated different concentrations of Zn 
nanoparticles into PHB-based biocomposites using the solution casting technique. 
There was a reduction in water absorption (66%) and water vapor permeability (38%) 
with increasing ZnO content (5% by weight). Oxygen permeability also decreased 
with increasing ZnO concentration (~53% decrease compared to pure PHB). Vasile 
et al. (2017) evaluated the influence of plasticization and the addition of nanoparticles 
on the barrier properties of PLA films. The materials were plasticized with Cu-doped 
ZnO, and Ag nanoparticle composites (ZnO:Cu/Ag) were added by the melt blend￾ing technique. The addition of 0.5 ZnO:Cu/Ag in the nanobiocomposites promoted 
a reduction in the water vapor transmission rate (11.35 g/m2/day) and CO2 and O2
transmission rates (230 and 97 mL/m2/day, respectively).
Manikandan et al. (2020) developed PHB nanocomposites with graphene nano￾platelets (Gr-NPs) (0%–1.3% by weight) for application in food packaging. Compared 
to pure PHB, the nanocomposite containing 0.7% Gr-NPs promoted 2× increase in 
tensile strength. Moreover, UV and visible light penetration was reduced by 3× with 
the addition of Gr-NPs. The nanocomposite application enhanced the shelf life (4×) 
of foods sensitive to moisture and oxygen (chips and dairy products).
From this perspective, bionanocomposites reinforcements have shown positive 
results in the mechanical and barrier properties of food packaging. Moreover, with 
the bionanocomposites application, the environmental appeal of packaging will be 
met by using materials of biological origin.
15.4 POLYESTER-BASED BIOCOMPOSITES IN 
ACTIVE FOOD PACKAGING
Active packaging systems involve the use of antimicrobial, antioxidant, scaven￾gers, emitter, and absorber agents and their interaction with food or the environ￾ment (Figure 15.1). Antimicrobial packaging works by preventing or delaying the 276 Polyester-Based Biocomposites
growth of microorganisms in food products. Therefore, active packaging helps to 
maintain the quality of foods (Moreira et al., 2018b). The migration of antimicrobial 
compounds to foods can cause reactions with lipids and proteins, leading to the loss 
of their activity. Thus, the development of packaging with the addition of bionano￾composites allows the controlled release of these agents, controlling the incidence of 
contaminating microorganisms in the food (Talegaonkar et al., 2017). These bion￾anomaterials can be developed with polymeric nanostructures, including nanopar￾ticles, nanofibers, nanoclays, nanocrystals, or nanowhiskers (Sharma et al., 2020). 
Kaffashi et al. (2016) developed PCL bionanocomposites with different concentra￾tions of triclosan-loaded PLA nanoparticles (30% by weight), produced through a 
melt mixing process. The authors found that PLA nanoparticles contributed to reduc￾ing the rapid release of triclosan from the bionanocomposites and thus, extending the 
antibacterial property of the samples for up to 2 years. Villegas et al. (2017) evaluated 
the antimicrobial capacity of PLA films with the addition of C30B nanoclay (5.0% 
w/w). Cinnamaldehyde and thymol were incorporated into the nanocomposites by 
supercritical impregnation using carbon dioxide. According to the study, PLA films 
without the active compound addition showed growth of microorganisms with values 
around 2.1×107 and 6.0×107 CFU/mL for Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia 
coli, respectively.
In another study, Lyu et al. (2019) evaluated the antioxidant capacity of PCL 
films developed with grapefruit seed extract. The concentration of 5% of the active 
compound provided high inhibition of Listeria monocytogenes (decreased bacterial 
count by 5.8 log). Moreover, bionanomaterials developed by electrospinning from 
functional or renewable polymers allow encapsulating of active agents. In this way, 
FIGURE 15.1 Characteristics, classification, and application of smart and active packaging 
materials. (Sani et al., 2021.)Polyester-Based Biocomposites for Food Packaging Applications 277
nanofibers can be applied as reinforcement to improve the physical properties of com￾posites and develop active packaging with antimicrobial properties (Maftoonazad & 
Ramaswamy, 2018). In this sense, Kuntzler et al. (2018) evaluated the antimicro￾bial capacity of PHB nanofibers containing phenolic compounds from the microalga 
Spirulina sp. LEB 18. The addition of 1% of the active compound in nanomaterials 
developed with 35% of PHB showed a greater area of inhibition (7.5±0.4mm) for S. 
aureus. Thus, active compounds attributed antimicrobial capacity to the nanofibers 
to develop active food packaging.
Feng et al. (2019) evaluated the antimicrobial activity of nanofibers and PLA/
TiO2 composite films through electrospinning and casting processes, respectively. 
In the study, materials containing 0.75% by weight of TiO2 nanoparticles showed an 
increase in antimicrobial capacity. The nanofibers and films developed showed areas 
of antimicrobial inhibition for E. coli (4.86±0.50 and 3.69±0.40mm) and S. aureus
(5.98±0.77 and 4.63±0. 45mm), respectively. Thus, both materials can be applied in 
food packaging to control contaminating microorganisms present in food.
15.5 POLYESTER-BASED BIOCOMPOSITES FOR 
MONITORING FOOD QUALITY
Intelligent packaging is a system that detects, tracks, and communicates to the con￾sumer possible changes in food (Figure 15.1). These packaging systems are crucial 
to guarantee the quality of the products, allowing decision-making about food safety 
(Kalpana et al., 2019). Besides, intelligent packaging help prevents food poisoning 
by users, reduces food waste, indicates the integrity of the seal, and acts against the 
counterfeiting of products (Moreira et al., 2018a, b).
The intelligent packaging system can be classified into indicators, sensors, and 
data support (Tyagi et al., 2021). The indicators directly show the quality of the 
packaged product due to its interactions/reactions with compounds generated during 
the growth of microorganisms. The sensors detect the presence of microorganisms, 
interacting with components inside the package (food macromolecules and gases), 
and environmental factors. Regarding data support, barcodes and Radio Frequency 
Identification tags are included (Kalpana et al., 2019; Ramos et al., 2018).
Using nanotechnological compounds in food packaging is a promising technology 
for quality control and food safety (Duncan, 2011). From this perspective, bionano￾composites are materials with great potential for intelligent biodegradable coat￾ings due to their ability to monitor the deterioration of food products (Abreu et al., 
2012). Studies have addressed the electrospun nanofibers’ potential for application in 
active and intelligent food packaging. Moreira et al. (2018a) developed pH-indicating 
membranes from PLA/poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) fibers containing phycocyanin. 
Variations in pH (from 3 to 4 and 5 to 6) caused a color change (ΔE) of the compound 
added to the nanomaterials (ΔE around 18). Thus, nanofibers loaded with phycocya￾nin are promising for use in intelligent food packaging, as the pigment color changes 
with pH variation. In this same segment, Terra et al. (2021a) also developed pH indi￾cator membranes from polymeric nanofibers for application in food packaging. In 
the study, PCL/PEO nanofibers were developed with phycocyanin concentrations of 
0.5%, 1%, and 2% (w/v). Nanomaterials containing 2% of the pigment were exposed 278 Polyester-Based Biocomposites
to pH buffers ranging from 3 to 4 and 5–6 and showed a color change ΔE≥8.5. These 
data indicate that this color change is perceptible to the human eye. The authors 
also found no membranes with phycocyanin additions returned to the initial staining 
color, confirming that the indicators could not tamper. In another study, Terra et al. 
(2021b) produced PCL/PEO nanofibers with curcumin, quercetin, and phycocyanin 
for application as pH–time indicators in food packaging. Color changes detectable by 
the human eye (ΔE≥5) were evidenced in nanofibers containing only phycocyanin 
(2%, w/v) in the pH range 3–6, showing that the developed indicator is promising for 
food quality control.
15.6 BIOSAFETY OF BIONANOCOMPOSITES IN FOODS
Nanomaterials have a high surface area and small size that facilitate migration and 
absorption by consumers’ bodies (Li & Huang, 2008). Research is still insufficient to 
measure the risks related to nanomaterials in the human body (Youssef & El-Sayed, 
2018). The safety of biocomposites in food packaging is still not fully understood 
(Abdul-Khalil et al., 2019). The effects of nanomaterials on human health and their 
application in the food sector should be better exposed (Sharma et al., 2020). There 
are still differences between countries regarding regulations and legislative measures 
regarding the application of nanotechnology in food packaging. This aspect makes 
it difficult to guarantee product safety, the environment, and the marketing of new 
products that benefit consumers (Ramos et al., 2018).
In this sense, the main limitation of nanotechnology is the migration speed of 
nanocomposites from food packaging and the consequences for human health, ani￾mals, and the environment (Dimitrijevic et al., 2015). Regarding food intake by 
consumers, the migration of nanomaterials must be evaluated from the mouth to 
absorption in the gastrointestinal system (Silvestre et al., 2011). The speed at which 
nanomaterials migrate into products depends on the food’ physicochemical proper￾ties and coating material characteristics. In this context, the diffusivity is related to 
the polymer characteristics (concentration, molecular weight, and viscosity) and the 
food composition. Moreover, factors such as temperature, pH, and contact time of 
the packaging with the product also influence this phenomenon (Huang et al., 2015).
Therefore, the use of nanocomposites in food packaging is essential to improve 
the characteristics of packaging materials. However, research should deepen the 
investigation into the impact of these particles on the human body. In addition, there 
should be uniformity of regulations related to nanomaterials applied to food around 
the world to promote safety in the application and consumption of these products.
15.7 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE PROSPECTS
Biocomposites represent a new class of materials for creating food packaging. These 
biomaterials have promising potential to improve the barrier, mechanical, thermal, 
and functional properties, and biodegradability of polyester composites. Polyester￾based biocomposites are versatile materials that allow the development of packages 
for application in various food products. Governments and industries are investing 
in the development of biocomposites through research to increase the application Polyester-Based Biocomposites for Food Packaging Applications 279
efficiency of these materials. In addition, research for environmentally friendly pack￾aging has gained prominence among companies seeking more sustainable processes 
to reduce environmental pollution and resource depletion. Therefore, biocomposite 
market is expected to increase considerably with technological innovations related 
to the identification/application of new nanocomposite materials in food packages.
Active and intelligent packages added with polyester-based bionanocomposites 
have been investigated to ensure food quality, integrity, and safety without altering 
the taste and physical characteristics of the product. However, despite the advantages 
of bionanocomposites as packaging materials for food, safety and health concerns 
arise regarding nanomaterials accumulation in the human body and the environment. 
Therefore, detailed protocols must report the bionanomaterials migration from pack￾aging to food and their toxicity. In addition, regulatory policies must be considered 
during the manufacturing and processing of nanocomposite-based active and intel￾ligent packages.

16.1 BACKGROUND AND MOTIVATION
Sound absorption is a technique used in various fields to control noise pollution. A 
unique material is used as the absorbent material, a combination of solid and liquid 
phases, which is most often a porous material. Many examples can be found in the 
automation, building and industrial sectors, where certain materials play an essen￾tial role in controlling the noise pollution. Different environmental and economic 
constraints prompted designers and manufacturers to find a solution to increase their 
usage and potential. The efficiency of material combinations is considered. The bio￾based material polyurethane (PU) foam is developed and analysed to predict its effi￾ciency (Figure 16.1).
In the present scenario, the PU foam obtained from the polyol and isocyanate￾based mixer is used as an absorbent material in different areas. This type of foam, 
known as gasoline-based foam, affects human activities such as breathing and causes 
throat and lung problems. This motivated to spark a particular interest in develop￾ing bio-based PU foam, where polyol is derived from natural vegetable oils such as 
castor oil. Luffa fibre is a product obtained from the Luffa cylindrica plant, which is 
incorporated with bio-based PU foam in different percentages to form a composite 
material that contributes to enhanced sound absorption properties.
16.2 STATE OF THE ART IN ACOUSTICS ABSORPTION
16.2.1 Development of Acoustic Absorbing Material
Sound-absorbing material is widely used in various fields such as automobiles, indus￾trial environments and buildings. Efforts have been made accordingly concerning 
our work area. In cars, the material is used for sound absorption; it should be thin 
and light. In industry, materials are preferably made lightweight and cheap, as these 
FIGURE 16.1 Sound insulation material in an automobile.288 Polyester-Based Biocomposites
two parameters have major influence for increasing the efficiency of the automo￾bile. Therefore, improving the absorption performance of these materials is of great 
importance. PU foam is an absorbing material that meets all the above requirements 
and is enhanced and evolved by incorporating natural fibres in different percentages, 
resulting in a composite material. The main advantage of adding fibre particles is 
strengthening the porous medium, so flow resistance is an essential improved factor 
that provides a good value for the sound absorption coefficient. Another important 
motivating factor was a particular interest in chemically minimising the impact of 
PU foam on human health. Bio-based polyol is blended with isocyanate to produce 
eco-friendly PU foam.
16.2.2 Finite Element-Based Numerical Model
Various calculation methods are adopted to describe the acoustic behaviour of 
absorbent or porous materials at multiple frequencies. Delany–BezMiki and Joley–
Hanson–Champoux–Allard are the dconventional methods adopted to develop the 
drag factor model. Atala et al. [1] have developed a Finite Element Design based on a 
numerical model which explains the acoustic absorption coefficient of porous mate￾rial composed of porous reinforcements with different properties. One end of the 
impedance generates the incident plane wave, and a porous medium defines the other 
end. This domain is designed using the fundamentals of BIOT theory, which solves 
the solution for both pressure and displacements of the porous matrix. By adopting 
BIOT theory, many unknown properties and characteristics of absorbent material 
can be determined. As we consider five significant properties of any porous material: 
porosity, tortuosity, flow resistivity, viscous characteristics, and thermal characteris￾tics length, BIOTS theory gives a theoretical explanation as these parameters appear 
in the BIOT general model.
16.3 PROBLEM DEFINITION
Recent developments in PU foams relate to composite formation incorporated with 
various fibres such as glass fib, jute fibre and textile. This area is still being developed 
to exploit its full potential. The disadvantage of PU foam is its chemical formation 
of polyol and isocyanate derived from gasoline chemicals, which can harm human 
health. Therefore, to reduce the impact of these synthetic foams, the development 
of bio-based foam from vegetable oils to produce PU FOAM is being carried out. 
Luffa fruit, obtained from the L. cylindrica plant, is used as fibre to improve sound 
absorption properties.
16.4 OBJECTIVES
The main object of this present research is to fabricate a bio-based PU foam. 
Generally, PU is formed by two primary chemical components: isocyanate as pre￾polymer and polyol. This research attempts to incorporate bio fillers such as luffa 
fibres in various percentages in short fibres. Further, this material is experimentally Bio-Based Polyurethane Foam for Acoustical Applications 289
tested for acoustical properties to obtain a sound absorption coefficient (α), and as 
follows:
1. To determine the transfer of function method of two microphones which 
purely measures the sound pressure in an impedance tube at two flushed 
mounted microphones positions. This determines the acoustic parameters, 
such as the degree of absorption with a frequency range up to 6.3 kHz.
2. To determine sound absorption coefficient using numerical and analyti￾cal approach using finite element analysis using COMSOL Multiphysics 
software.
16.5 METHODOLOGY
Steps followed for the fabrication of bio-based PU foam incorporated with luffa fibre. 
The flowchart represented in Figure 16.2 gives a brief procedure involved in the fab￾rication process.
FIGURE 16.2 Fabrication flowchart of PU foam.290 Polyester-Based Biocomposites
16.6 LITERATURE SURVEY
Ju Hyuk Park et al. [2] have investigated the optimisation and modelling of low￾frequency sound absorption by controlling the cell size of the porous material. He 
also explained the modelling of acoustic and manipulating microstructural irradiat￾ing ultrasonic waves by mixing resin during the foaming process. This research also 
resulted in the numerical simulation to predict the effect of cell size on the perfor￾mance of acoustic properties using the multi-scale porous acoustical method. Jung 
Hyeun Kim et al. [3] investigated the sound absorption behaviour of flexible polyure￾thane foams (FPFs) with various cell structures. This research established the rela￾tionship between the cell structure and acoustic properties. The results revealed that 
voids and pores were controlled by two types of gelling catalysts, namely DBTDL, 
and DBTDL and water, which are directly influenced by the sound absorption prop￾erty of the flexible foams. Moises Pinto et al. [4] described the formulation, produc￾tion and characterisation of PU foams. The PU foam produced was explained using 
ratios and mixtures of chemicals. And the calculation of the bulk density of foams 
has been carried out. Bulent EKICI et al. [5] studied the sound absorption property 
of PU foams by adding tea-leaf fibres. This study explains the two-microphone trans￾fer function method and the effect of fibres on sound-absorbing properties. Sergio 
Mendez et al. [6] fabricated PU-based foams by incorporating “Waste” glycerol from 
transesterification synthesis into “Waste” Agricultural Residues (e.g., chopped rice 
hull fibres). The goal was to make hybrid foams with a substantial portion of plant￾based compounds that have mechanical properties comparable to those of traditional 
PU foam [7].
For the fabrication of bio-based PU foam, polyol is obtained from natural veg￾etable oils such as castor oil. Luffa fibre is a product derived from the L. cylindrica
plant that forms a composite material with bio-based PU foam in varying percent￾ages, contributing to enhanced sound absorption properties.
16.7 FABRICATION OF HYBRID POLYURETHANE FOAMS
There are two different PU foams, flexible (soft) and rigid (hard). The production 
of these foams varies in the chemical formation process. In general, the production 
of PU foams uses petrochemicals that can significantly impact human health. This 
study provides the production of hybrid PU foams where vegetable oils can replace 
the petrochemicals, and the addition of fibres plays a significant role in various noise 
control applications.
16.7.1 Materials and Methodology
In this study, PU foam is produced from two constituents, namely isocyanates and 
polyols. Isocyanate acts as prepolymers (WANNATE-8018). Modified MDI is a 
mixture of polyol-modified diphenylmethane diisocyanate and polyphenyl methane 
polyisocyanate. It is a brown liquid at room temperature. It can be mainly used in the 
production of high-resilience foam [8]. And the polyol is JAGROPOL-400. The spec￾ification of WANNATE-8018 and JAGROPOL-400 is given in Tables 16.1 and 16.2.Bio-Based Polyurethane Foam for Acoustical Applications 291
Isocyanates are considered the essential component in the synthesis of PU foam. 
Generally, isocyanates are di- or polyfunctional monomers containing two or more –
NCO groups per molecule [9–10]. TDI, MDI, xylene diisocyanate, 1,6-hexamethylene 
diisocyanate, 2,2,4-trimethyl hexamethylene diisocyanate, isophorone diisocyanate, 
4,4′-di-cyclohexyl methane diisocyanate and norbornane diisocyanate are 4,4′-dibenzyl 
diisocyanate are classified under aromatic isocyanates [11–13]. Figures 16.3 and 16.4 
show few examples of some typically used isocyanates in research and development.
Another component used for the synthesis of PU foams is polyols. Polyols play an 
essential role in the synthesis of PU foam industries as they are traditionally derived 
from petrochemicals. Concerning environmental aspects and sustainability, it has 
paved the way for producing polyols derived from vegetables such as soybeans, cas￾tor and palm oil [14–15]. This aspect grabbed a lot of interest and scope by vari￾ous researchers as they are economically affordable [16–18]. They can also satisfy 
multiple features like renewability, flexibility to the process, biodegradability with 
cost-effectiveness, and comparable performance with petrol-based polyols [19–20].
The Luffa fibre (pictured) is used to improve the acoustic properties of PU foam 
obtained from the L. cylindrica plant. These fibres are hollow and punctured and 
have a low specific gravity of 1.48 g/cm3. Luffa Loaf PU fruits are commercially 
available in the market for various purposes. Due to natural porous structures, these 
can be used as a suitable engineered material for sound absorption applications [21].
The pretreatment of the luffa fibres is done before the sample preparation as it is 
crucial to reduce the moisture content in the luffa fruit and improve the pore size.

Raw luffa is moist, and the pores are uneven. To overcome all these issues, luffa 
fibres are treated with a 5% NaOH solution at room temperature for 1 day, as shown 
in Figure 16.5. After the treatment, these fibres are washed with ordinary water and 
dried at room temperature for a day to improve the material’s properties. The effect 
of alkali treatment with 5% of NaOH improves the surface interactions and gets 
apparent homogenous voids, which is vital in the sound absorption process. The 
naked eye can observe the appearance change, as the colour of the luffa has changed

from dusky brown to pale yellow colour as shown in Figure 16.6. Luffa fibre consists 
of the inner core and outer shell, and once the pretreatment is done, the inner core 
is removed and the outer shell is made into mat forms, as shown in Figure 16.7. This 
study’s main interests are in short fibres and circular mats. The short fibres are of 
length 2–4mm, and the circular mat of a diameter of 33mm is made from the outer 
shell shown in Figure 16.8.
In this study, PU foam is produced from isocyanate (WANNATE-8018). Modified 
MDI is a mixture of polyol-modified diphenylmethane diisocyanate and polyphenyl 
methane polyisocyanate. It is a brown liquid at room temperature. It can be mainly 
used in the production of high-resilience foam. And the polyol is JAGROPOL-400. 
The specification of WANNATE-8018 and JAGROPOL-400 is given in Tables 16.1 
and 16.2, respectively.

16.7.2 Sample Preparation
The reaction between polyol (A) and isocyanate (B). The mixing ratio of A:B leads 
to the formation of PU foam. The mixing ratio of polyol and isocyanate varies by the 
foam phase. If the polyol content is higher than the isocyanate content, the result is 
a flexible foam. When the isocyanate weight ratio is higher than the polyol, the foam 
produced becomes very rigid, known as rigid polyurethane foam (RPF). A rectan￾gular mould is used to manufacture PU foam. Polyol and isocyanate with different 
wt% fibres are mixed in a beaker. A mixing tool at up to 2000 rpm was used to mix 
the composition to obtain a homogeneous composition. After mixing, the foam was 
allowed to rise freely at room temperature for 1 hour. The circular samples with a 
diameter of 33 and a height of 40mm are made for impedance tube tests.
FIGURE 16.8 Short form of luffa fibre and circular shape of luffa.
FIGURE 16.7 Separation of inner core from luffa fibre.Bio-Based Polyurethane Foam for Acoustical Applications 295
Flexible Foam: If polyol (A) is higher than isocyanate (B), the foam formed is 
soft and dimensionally unstable, as shown in Figure 16.9.
Rigid Foam: If polyol (A) is less than isocyanate (B), then the foam formed 
was rigid, as shown in Figure 16.10 (Table 16.3).
Both open-cell and closed-cell foams are incorporated with fibres to maintain bio￾based and improve noise reduction properties. Short fibres of 2mm are made from 
luffa fibre mat and combined with flexible and RPFs with three different percent￾ages like 5%, 10% and 15%. A total of eight samples of flexible and rigid foams 
will be prepared for testing experimental and numerical predictions, as shown in 
Figures 16.11 and 16.12.

16.8 EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATION
16.8.1 Impedance Tube Theory
There are two methods of sound absorption properties: the reverberation room test 
and the impedance tube test. Through these two methods, engineers and scientists 
can determine the absorption properties of the material in the early stages of the 
acoustic environment. These two methods can evaluate absorption properties such as 
sound absorbance, reflectance and surface impedance. The main disadvantage of the 
reverberation room test is that it requires a lot of space, an experienced acoustician 
and large samples to derive properties [22–23].
Therefore, due to all these problems, the reverberation room test was not consid￾ered and mainly, the impedance tube test was used for evaluation. The impedance 
tube is a circular, hollow, rigid tube of varying dimensions concerning frequency. 
The low-frequency impedance tube had a diameter of 96mm and a frequency of up 
to 4kHz. The high-frequency impedance tube had a diameter of 34mm and a fre￾quency range of up to 6.3 kHz.
Two methods for acoustic impedance measurement with an impedance tube are 
presented. The first uses continuous white noise with two microphones, and the other 
uses transient acoustic excitation to excite a single microphone. Acoustic theory can 
be used to derive equations for the two methods [24]. The first method, i.e., the two￾microphone method, is the most commonly used in this work. The acoustic sample 
is placed at one end of a tube, and a loudspeaker is mounted at the other end. The 
speaker creates sound, resulting in a forward-propagating sound wave. Some of the 
sounds are reflected, creating a backward-travelling sound wave [25]. The reflec￾tion coefficient is determined by measuring the impinging pressure on the reflected 
pressure. It can be interesting to find the absorption coefficient (fraction of energy 
dissipated by the porous material at total incidence) and the reflection coefficient R 
during the impedance measurement.
There are three types of sound field incidence angles: normal incidence, random 
incidence and oblique incidence. The absorption coefficient of the material increases 
up to a certain angle; beyond the rise, the drop in the absorption coefficient can be 
FIGURE 16.12 Rigid samples of PU foam with different luffa fibre percentages.298 Polyester-Based Biocomposites
observed. The average incidence absorption coefficient is slightly lower than that of 
random incidence. Obliquely incident waves are used to measure average surface 
impedance.
16.8.2 Impedance Experimental Procedure
The impedance tube is a straight, rigid and smooth speaker known as the sound 
source that creates the plane wave at the other end. At the other end is placed the 
sample of the required diameter for which the properties will be measured. Two 
microphones are placed away from the sound source to capture the incident and 
reflected waves in the impedance tube. The acoustic transfer function between the 
microphones is used to calculate the absorption coefficient, the reflection coefficient 
R and the test samples.
The frequency in impedance tube measurement depends on the diameter of the 
tube and the distance between the microphones’ impedance ratio. To increase the 
frequency, change the diameter and spacing. The experimental procedure at normal 
incidence depends entirely on the reflection factor r. The reflection factor r is deter￾mined using the transfer function H12 between two microphone distances on the 
impedance tube near the sample.
The incident pressure Pi
 and reflected pressure Pr
 produced from the sound source 
are given below:
P P e incident plane wave, i I j k0

And

where PI
 and PR are the magnitudes of the Pi

respectively, and k0=k0−jk0 is a complex wavenumber.

16.8.3 Experimental Procedure
The impedance tube is a straight hollow tube with a similar cross-section throughout 
the tube. The diameters of 35 and 96mm are chosen according to the frequency￾dependent diameter of the tube. The 35mm diameter is used to calibrate for the 
high-frequency range up to 6.3 kHz, and the 96mm diameter is used to calibrate 
for the low-frequency range up to 4kHz. As a rule, the length of the tube should be 
three times greater than the diameter of the tube. The thickness of the hose is recom￾mended as 5% of the diameter of the hose (Figure 16.13).
According to ISO standard, the material recommended for the tube is aluminium, 
which is used to avoid the vibrations caused due to frequency as well as to avoid the 
FIGURE 16.13 Schematic representation of impedance tube setup.300 Polyester-Based Biocomposites
cracks; there are no quench voids present on the aluminium tube due to its smooth 
surface. The microphones used in this project are selected according to the ISO stan￾dard 10534, and they are placed on the wall tightly to avoid the slightest escaping of 
pressure from the microphone walls. As per the literature reviews, microphones of 
length ½ or ¼ are generally referred in inches (Figure 16.14). 
16.8.4 Working Frequency Range
As mentioned above, the working frequency of the impedance tube is determined 
using the diameter of the tube. The lower frequency depends on the microphone 
spacing, like 150–300Hz. The upper frequency range depends on the diameter of 
the tube sequence.
F kc
d u < , (16.10)
where c is the speed of sound, d is the diameter of the tube and k is constant (0.586).
The lower frequency is considered because of better accuracy in signal processing 
equipment. The upper frequency is specified to maintain better plane wave genera￾tion without any occurrences of non-plane wave generation.
The working frequency range is Fl<F<Fu, where F is the operating frequency in 
hertz or kilohertz, Fl
 is the lower frequency range in hertz or kilohertz and Fu is the 
upper frequency range in hertz or kilohertz.
16.8.4.1 High-Frequency Limit [Fu]
There is the condition for higher frequency range calculation:
d 0.58 < λu (16.11)
d 0.58 < C / 0 u F (16.12)
F d 0.58 u 0 < C , (16.13)
where Fu is the upper frequency range, d is the diameter of the tube and C0 is the 
speed of sound.

16.9 DYNAMIC SIGNAL ANALYSIS
M+P analyser is an integrated method for finding noise and vibrations using dynamic 
signal measurement. It is used for analysis and advanced reporting of noise and vibra￾tion, acoustics and general dynamic signalling applications. Comprehensive time and 
frequency analyses are available with online and offline data processing. With the 
advanced application, M+P’s dynamic signal analyser makes it easy to collect data, 
view results, perform analysis and create customised reports, socialised all within 
one user interface. The M+P analyser is designed for noise and vibration applications 
in the field and in the laboratory.
M+P dynamic analyser is used to examine acoustic properties with the 4/8 chan￾nel. The M+P analyser collects time history data for fast Fourier transform (FFT) 
spectra. Real-time and triggered data acquisition modes with a 50Hz to 10,000Hz 
sampling frequency are recorded. Further FFT block sizes of up to 256k in the higher 
frequency range were noted. The data collected by the M+Panalyser is in excel for￾mat which is further converted to a CSV file analyser. Later MATLAB is used to 
determine the absorption coefficient and surface impedance.
16.10 MATLAB
MATLAB is a tool used in this work to plot the absorption coefficient value graphi￾cally. The algorithm developed is based on a transfer function and a few inputs as 
variables to define the accurate value.

16.10.1 Experimental Results
The absorption coefficient was determined for the two different types of flexible 
and rigid foams. PU foam is a bio-based material with three different percentages of 
Luffa fibres incorporated into it. The sample thickness is 40mm, and the diameter 
is 33mm. The measurements are carried out in a frequency range from 500Hz to 
6.3kHz. The plot of all samples is shown to understand the effects of different fibre 
percentages on the absorption coefficient.
16.10.2 Open-Cell Polyurethane Foam
The open-cell PU foam is also known as a flexible, lower-density foam. In general, 
open-cell foams are used in many applications because of their absorbent properties. 
Due to its overall structure, the observed percentage of porosity is higher than the 
standard material. To improve the porosity of the structure in this study, the short 
fibres are used to penetrate the structure to enlarge the pores further. The sample size 
for the experimental research is 33mm in diameter.
The absorption coefficient of the three samples of three different percentages 
of luffa with open-cell PU foam is represented in Figure 16.15. The percentage of 
luffa plays an essential role in improving the quality of absorption properties. Each 
sample has been calibrated a minimum of three times, and the average is considered 
as the final result. From Figure 16.16, it is clear that luffa fibre of 15% has a better 
absorption coefficient. The pore size will improve by adding the fibres, subsequently 
improving the alpha value with porous structure improvement.304 Polyester-Based Biocomposites
16.10.3 Closed-Cell Polyurethane Foam
Closed-cell PU foam is used for applications where the structures require thermal 
insulation. This work paper on closed-cell foam aims to predict the effect of fibres in 
closed-cell foam compared to open-cell foam. The density of the closed-cell foam is 
greater than that of the open-cell foam. The change in properties with fibre is inves￾tigated experimentally.

The absorption coefficient of the three samples with three different percentages 
of luffa with closed-cell PU foam is shown in Figure 16.17. The level of luffa plays a 
vital role in improving the quality of the absorption properties. Each sample is cali￾brated at least three times, and the average is considered the final result. It is clear 
from Figure 16.17 that luffa fibre of 15% has a better absorption coefficient. The 
effect of porous size will improve by adding fibres, which will improve the alpha 
value with porous structure improvement.
When comparing open-cell and closed-cell PU foams, it was observed that open￾cell foam has the highest absorption coefficient than closed-cell foam, which is due 
to the physical properties of foams.
16.11 SUMMARY
16.11.1 Experimental Observations
16.12 CONCLUSION
From the experimental investigations, it is clear that the overall comparison between 
FPF with 15% of luffa fibres has an alpha value of 0.93. And the lowest value of alpha 
is 0.61 for the RPF having 5% of luffa fibre. The varying importance of porosity, tor￾tuosity and flow resistivity also changes the value of the absorption coefficient value 
as well (Table 16.4).
