 About 
On Cooking,
Seventh Edition 
 The seventh edition of On Cooking follows the model established in previous editions, 
which have prepared thousands of students for successful careers in the culinary arts by 
building a strong foundation based on sound fundamental techniques. Students and 
instructors alike have praised On Cooking for its comprehensive yet accessible coverage of 
culinary skills and cooking procedures. Chapters focus on six areas that are essential to 
a well-rounded culinary professional: 
➊ Professionalism Background chapters introduce students to the field and feature 
material on food history, food safety and menu planning. Updated food safety informa￾tion reflects the most recent regulations. The chapter on nutrition ties nutrition basics to 
principles of healthy cooking and preparing food for guests who follow special diets. 
➋ Preparation Chapters cover the core subjects all culinary students should be famil￾iar with before stepping into the kitchen. Equipment, basic knife skills and mise en 
place concepts are explained and illustrated. Staple ingredients, such as dairy prod￾ucts, herbs and spices as well as flavor profiles are also presented in this section. 
➌ Cooking These chapters explain and then demonstrate fundamental cooking tech￾niques with a wide range of recipes. Individual chapters focus on different categories 
of key ingredients such as meats, poultry, fish, eggs and vegetables. 
➍ Garde Manger These chapters cover kitchen preparations including salads, sand￾wich making, charcuterie and hors d’oeuvre preparations. Material is of sufficient 
depth to support a complete unit on garde manger skills. 
➎ Baking These chapters cover a range of classic and contemporary breads and pas￾tries that every culinary student should know. The material is sufficient to support a 
 stand-alone unit on breads and dessert preparation. 
➏ Presentation Chapters on plate and buffet presentation demonstrate traditional and 
contemporary techniques for enhancing the visual presentation of food. The basics 
of buffet setup and management are also included in this section. 
 UPDATES 
 More than 325 new photographs and illustrations clearly show core techniques, equip￾ment and foods. 
 A revised Nutrition and Healthy Cooking chapter now includes expanded information 
on health-related and vegetarian diets. A new Plant-Based Cooking chapter as well as more 
vegetarian and vegan recipes throughout help inspire students to refocus their food choices. 
 Content updates, including more than 90 new recipes, plus dozens of recipe variations, 
reflect current trends with a focus on international cuisines and flavor profiles. Expanded 
coverage of fermenting, preserving and pickling shows students modern cooking tech￾niques widely used in professional kitchens. Expanded discussion of fabrication and yield 
testing helps students recognize the importance of tracking costs. 
 A greatly enhanced support package includes MyLab Culinary ® with Pearson eText￾book and Pearson Kitchen Manager, our online recipe management system. An online 
 instructors’ manual featuring performance-based learning activities, an improved test 
bank and lecture-based PowerPoint slides are also available.

today’s professional chef must exercise sound judgment and be committed to achieving 
excellence in all endeavors.

however, can provide taste, creativity, commitment and judgment. For these, chefs and other 
culinary professionals must rely on themselves. This chapter explores the rich history of the 
restaurant industry in the West and the individuals who influenced the development of the 
profession. It also outlines the attributes of the professional chef. As you begin your culinary 
studies, we hope that you find inspiration in the history of the Western food service industry 
as you learn about the qualities that will guide you in your chosen career. 
 TNEMPOLEVED LACIROTSIH 
 Cooks have produced food in quantity for as long as people have eaten together. For 
millennia, chefs, whether they be Asian, Native American, Aboriginal, European or 
African, have catered to the often elaborate dining needs of the wealthy and powerful; 
and for centuries, vendors in China, Europe and elsewhere have sold foods to the public 
that they prepared themselves or bought from others. 
 But in the West, the history of the professional chef is of relatively recent origin. Its 
cast is mostly French, and it is intertwined with the history of restaurants—for only with 
the development of restaurants in Europe and North America during the late 18th and 
early 19th centuries were chefs expected to produce, efficiently and economically, differ￾ent dishes at different times for different diners.

Classic Poultry 
Flavors
Ever versatile, chicken can be flavored 
with delicate herbs or robust, fiery spices. 
When roasted, chicken benefits from a 
simple grating of salt and pepper. Light 
sauces made from pan juices or velouté 
accented with tender herbs, lemon 
and white or black pepper are typical 
accompaniments that enhance the pure 
flavor of the poultry. But skin-on chicken 
pieces withstand marinating in wet or dry 
spice mixtures before grilling, roasting 
or stewing. Spice blends from adobo 
to garam masala can be used with any 
type of poultry. The versatility of poultry 
may account for its popularity. Dark 
meat from turkey legs can substitute for 
lamb or pork in kebabs or stews. And 
boneless skinless chicken or turkey breast, 
when sliced thinly and pounded, makes 
excellent cutlets.
Safety Alert
The Temperature Danger Zone
The temperature danger zone is a 
broad range of temperatures in which 
most of the bacteria that cause food￾borne illnesses multiply rapidly. The 
2022 Food Code of the U.S. Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA), indicates 
that the temperature danger zone 
begins at 41°F (5°C) and ends at 
135°F (57°C). Regulations in some 
localities and with some organizations 
may vary. This text uses the range 
recommended by the FDA.

➊ Roll the dough out and line the pan as 
specified in the previous procedure. Spoon or 
pour the filling into the dough-lined pan. Using 
a ruler as a guide, cut even strips of the desired 
width, typically ½ inch (1.2 centimeters). Position 
several strips of dough across the pie in one 
direction. For the traditional lattice shown here, 
the strips of dough should all be the same width 
and should be spaced evenly on top of the filling.
➋ Fold back every other strip of dough. Lay 
another strip of dough across the top of the 
pie, perpendicular to the first strips. Unfold the 
strips of dough, and then fold back the alternate 
strips. Lay another strip of dough perpendicular 
to the first strips. Unfold the folded strips and 
refold the alternate strips. Repeat the weaving 
process until the surface of the pie is covered 
with an attractive pattern of dough.
➌ Trim any overhanging dough and crimp 
the lattice strips to the bottom crust to seal. 
A small amount of water can be used to help 
attach the strips to the edge of bottom crust 
before crimping.

 Fragrant herbs are available fresh or dried. Because drying alters their flavors and aro￾mas, fresh herbs are generally preferred and should be used if possible. Micro herbs
are the first true leaves of virtually any edible herb, such as basil or chervil. Micro 
herbs are very fragile and must be handpicked and carefully packaged for 
delivery. They are bursting with intense flavor; chefs use them as garnishes, 
especially on entrées and canapés. 
Basil (Fr. basilic ) is one of the great culi￾nary herbs. It is available in a variety of 
“flavors”—cinnamon, garlic, lemon, 
even chocolate—but the most com￾mon is sweet basil. Sweet basil has 
light green, tender leaves and small 
white flowers. Its flavor isn’t actually 
sweet, but rather strong, warm and slightly pep￾pery, with a hint of anise and cloves. Basil is used in 
Mediterranean and some Southeast Asian cuisines and has a special 
affinity for garlic and tomatoes. When purchasing fresh basil, look for 
bright green leaves; avoid flower buds and wilted or rust-colored leaves. Dried sweet 
basil is readily available but has a decidedly weaker flavor than fresh. 
Opal basil is named for its vivid purple color. It has a 
tougher, crinkled leaf and a medium-strong flavor. Opal basil 
may be substituted for sweet basil in cooking, and its appear￾ance makes it a distinctive garnish.
Thai sweet basil (Th. bai horapha ) has a narrow leaf 
and purple stem. It has a slight licorice flavor and is used 
in both raw and cooked dishes in Southeast Asian cuisines.
Bay (Fr. laurier ), also known as sweet laurel, is a small 
tree that produces tough, glossy leaves with a sweet balsamic aroma 
and peppery flavor. In cooking, dried bay leaves are often preferred 
over the more bitter fresh leaves. Essential in French cuisine, bay 
leaves are part of the traditional bouquets garnis and court bouil￾lon. Whole dried bay leaves are usually added to a dish at the 
start of cooking, then removed when sufficient flavor has 
been extracted.
Chervil (Fr. cerfeuil ), also known as sweet cicely, 
is native to Russia and the Middle East. Its lacy, fern￾like leaves can be used as a garnish. Chervil’s flavor 
is delicate, similar to parsley but with the distinctive

 Preface 
 Learning to cook is much more than simply learning to follow a recipe. Consequently, 
On Cooking, Seventh Edition, is not a cookbook or a collection of recipes. It is a carefully 
designed text initially published 30 years ago and consistently designed and organized to 
teach you the fundamentals of the culinary arts and to prepare you for a rewarding 
career in the food service industry. 
 The goal of On Cooking is to focus your attention on general procedures, highlighting 
fundamental principles and skills, whether it be for preparing a yeast bread or grilling 
a piece of fish. Both the how and why of cooking are discussed, emphasizing culinary 
principles first, not recipes. Only after the principles are introduced and explained are 
sample recipes offered. This new edition includes many more recipes drawn from various 
international cuisines. Professional cooking no longer leans solely on French culinary tra￾ditions. Chefs now turn to the traditions of Asia, Africa and elsewhere for inspiration and 
ingredients. On Cooking , Seventh Edition recognizes this evolution and includes many 
recipes created in the style of popular dishes found throughout the world. 
 The content is extensively illustrated with photographs and line drawings to help you 
identify foods and equipment. Most recipes include photographs of the finished dish ready for 
service and many procedures are illustrated with step-by-step photographs. Tables and bul￾leted lists present information in a concise format to enhance your understanding of concepts. 
 To provide you with a sense of the rich traditions of cookery, informative sidebars on 
food history, chef biographies and other topics are located throughout the book. Side￾bars that relate to flavors and flavorings also appear throughout the material to enhance 
your understanding of ingredients and possible variations. Safety Alerts are shown in red, 
to remind you of conditions or situations that might pose a danger to you or to diners.

 A NOTE ON RECIPES 
 Recipes are important and useful as a means of standardizing food preparation 
and recording information. In On Cooking, Seventh Edition, recipes are designed 
primarily to reinforce and explain techniques and procedures presented in the 
text. Many recipe yields are intentionally low to be less intimidating to begin￾ning cooks and more useful in small schools and kitchens. 
 All ingredients are listed in both U.S. and metric measurements. The metric equivalents 
are rounded off to even, easily measured amounts. You should consider the ingredient 
lists as separate recipes or formulas; do not measure some ingredients according to the 
metric amounts and other ingredients according to the U.S. amounts or the proportions 
will not be accurate and the intended result will not be achieved. Throughout this book, 
unless otherwise noted: 
▪ mirepoix refers to a preparation of 2 parts onion, 1 part celery and 1 part carrot 
by weight 
▪ pepper refers to ground black pepper, preferably freshly ground 
▪ butter refers to whole unsalted butter 
▪ milk refers to whole or reduced fat (not nonfat) milk 
▪ egg refers to whole large eggs 
▪ yogurt refers to whole plain (unsweetened) yogurt 
▪ TT means “to taste” 
A01_LABE1163_07_SE_FM.indd 33 14/11/23 12:34 PMxxxiv PREFACE
 Detailed procedures for standard techniques are presented in the text and generally 
are not repeated in each recipe (e.g., in a recipe, the instruction will be simply “deglaze 
the pan” or “monté au beurre”). Notes and variations appear at the end of selected reci￾pes. These notes indicate ingredient substitutions for cost saving or to accommodate a 
 plant-based diet. Variations illustrate how one set of techniques or procedures can be 
used to prepare different dishes with only minor modifications. 
 A mise en place feature is included for recipes that appear in the front sections of each 
recipe chapter. Ingredients that require preparation before the recipe is begun are listed in 
the margin under the Mise en Place heading. Consult this brief checklist after you read the 
recipe but before you begin to cook. Some recipes also include headnotes that describe 
the cultural or historical background of a dish or the unique techniques used in its prepa￾ration. This short text will enhance your understanding of a cuisine or cooking technique. 
 No matter how detailed the written recipe, however, we assume that you are acquiring 
certain knowledge, skills and judgment. It becomes a judgment call to know, for example, 
when a loaf of bread or a fish fillet is properly cooked. Ovens and cookware may vary in 
efficiency. For these reasons, recipes and formulas describe alternate tests for doneness, 
requiring you to use your developing skills to determine when a dish is properly cooked. 
You should also rely upon the knowledge and skills of your instructor for guidance. 
Although some skills and an understanding of theory can be acquired through reading 
and study, no book can substitute for repeated hands-on preparation and observation. 
 A registered dietician analyzed all the recipes in this book using nutritional analysis 
software that incorporates data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, research labo￾ratories and food manufacturers. The nutrient information provided here should be used 
only as a reference, however. A margin of error of approximately 20 percent can be ex￾pected because of natural variations in ingredients. Preparation techniques and serving 
sizes may also significantly alter the values of many nutrients. For the nutritional analysis, 
if a recipe offers a choice of ingredients, the first-mentioned ingredient is the one used. 
Ingredients listed as “to taste” (TT) and “as needed” are omitted from the analysis. It is 
assumed that corn oil and whole milk are used when a recipe calls for “vegetable oil” and 
“milk,” respectively. In cases of a range of ingredient quantities or numbers of servings, 
the average is used. 
 Good Choice Throughout this book various recipes are marked with a Good Choice icon. This symbol 
identifies dishes that are particularly low in calories, fat, saturated fat or sodium; they 
may also be a good source of vitamins, protein, fiber or calcium. 
Vegetarian Recipes marked as vegetarian do not contain meat, fish, shellfish or poultry, but may con￾tain dairy products and/or eggs. (This symbol is not used in the baked goods recipes in 
 Chapters 31 – 35 , however, because none of them contains meat, fish, shellfish or poultry.) 
Vegan Vegan recipes do not contain any animal products. Vegetarian and vegan dishes are not 
necessarily low in calories, fat or sodium; nor are they necessarily good sources of vita￾mins, protein, fiber or calcium.

 After studying this chapter, 
you will be able to: 
1. 1 name key historical figures responsible for 
the development of the restaurant industry 
and describe the contributions of each 
1. 2 list and describe characteristics of modern 
food service operations 
1. 3 explain the organization of classic and 
modern kitchens 
1. 4 identify the attributes a student needs to 
become a successful culinary professional 
1. 5 describe the importance of professional 
ethics for chefs and list specific behaviors 
that all culinary professionals should follow 
1. 6 describe some of the culinary careers 
today’s student may pursue 
restaurant by offering a menu listing available dishes during fixed hours. (The date of its 
opening is debated, either 1782 or 1786.) Its owner, Antoine Beauvilliers (1754–1817), 
was the former steward (chief of the household staff) to the Comte de Provence, later 
King Louis XVIII of France. Beauvilliers’s impeccably trained wait staff served patrons at 
small, individual tables in an elegant setting. 
 The French Revolution (1789–1799) had a significant effect on the budding restaurant 
industry. Along with the aristocracy, the revolution generally abolished guilds and their 
monopolies. The revolution also allowed the public access to the skills and creativity of 
the well-trained, sophisticated chefs who previously had worked exclusively in the aris￾tocracy’s private kitchens. Although many of the aristocracy’s chefs either left the country 
or lost their jobs (and some their heads), a few opened restaurants catering to the grow￾ing urbanized middle class. 
 The Early 19th Century—Carême and Grande Cuisine 
 As the 19th century progressed, more restaurants opened, serving a greater selection of 
items and catering to a wider clientele. By midcentury, several large, grand restaurants 
in Paris were serving elaborate meals, reminiscent of the grande cuisine (also known 
as haute cuisine ) of the aristocracy. Grande cuisine , which arguably reached its peak 
of perfection in the hands of Antonin Carême, was characterized by meals consisting 
of dozens of courses of elaborately and intricately prepared, presented, garnished and 
sauced foods. Other restaurateurs blended the techniques and styles of grande cuisine
with the simpler foods and tastes of the middle class ( cuisine bourgeoise ) to create a new 
 professional cooking a system of cooking

ingredients and procedures

and adoption of strict culinary principles; by

itself from regional cuisines, which tend to 
emphasize the tradition of cooking 
 Like any fine art, great cookery requires taste and creativity, an appreciation of 
beauty and a mastery of technique. like the sciences, successful cookery demands 
knowledge and an understanding of basic principles, and like any successful leader, 
today’s professional chef must exercise sound judgment and be committed to achieving 
excellence in all endeavors. 
 This book describes foods and cooking equipment, explains culinary principles and 
cooking techniques and provides recipes using these principles and techniques. no book, 
however, can provide taste, creativity, commitment and judgment. for these, chefs and other 
culinary professionals must rely on themselves. This chapter explores the rich history of the 
restaurant industry in the West and the individuals who influenced the development of the 
profession. it also outlines the attributes of the professional chef. as you begin your culinary 
studies, we hope that you find inspiration in the history of the Western food service industry 
as you learn about the qualities that will guide you in your chosen career. 
 HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT 
OF THE RESTAURANT INDUSTRY 
 Cooks have produced food in quantity for as long as people have eaten together. For 
millennia, chefs, whether they be Asian, Native American, Aboriginal, European or 
African, have catered to the often elaborate dining needs of the wealthy and powerful; 
and for centuries, vendors in China, Europe and elsewhere have sold foods to the public 
that they prepared themselves or bought from others. 
 But in the West, the history of the professional chef is of relatively recent origin. Its 
cast is mostly French, and it is intertwined with the history of restaurants—for only with 
the development of restaurants in Europe and North America during the late 18th and 
early 19th centuries were chefs expected to produce, efficiently and economically, differ￾ent dishes at different times for different diners. 
 The 18th Century—The First Restaurants 
 The word restaurant is derived from the French word restaurer (“to restore”). Since the 
16th century, the word restorative had been used to describe rich and highly flavored 
soups or stews capable of restoring lost strength. Restoratives, like all other cooked 
foods offered and purchased outside the home during this period of history, were made 
by guild members. Each guild had a monopoly on preparing a category of food items. 
For example, during the reign of Henri IV of France (r. 1589–1610), there were separate 
guilds for rôtisseurs (who cooked the main cuts of meat), pâtissiers (who cooked poultry, 
pies and tarts), vinaigriers (who made sauces and some stews, including some restor￾atives) and traiteurs (who made meat stews). 
 The French claim that the first modern restaurant opened one day in 1765 when a 
Parisian tavern keeper, a Monsieur Boulanger, hung a sign advertising the sale of his 
special restorative, a dish of sheep feet in white sauce. Boulanger’s establishment dif￾fered from the inns and taverns that had existed throughout Europe for centuries. These 
inns and taverns served foods prepared (usually off premises) by the appropriate guild. 
The food offered by the inn or tavern was incidental to the establishment’s primary func￾tion: providing sleeping accommodations or drink. Customers were served the daily dish 
family style and ate at communal tables. Boulanger’s contribution to the food service 
industry was serving a variety of foods prepared on premises to customers whose pri￾mary interest was dining. 
 Among other restaurants that opened in Paris during the succeeding decades, the 
Grande Taverne de Londres is credited with advancing the development of the modern 
 cookery the art, practice or work of cooking 
 cooking (1) the transfer of energy from a heat 
source to a food; this energy alters the food’s 
molecular structure, changing its texture, flavor, 
aroma and appearance; (2) the preparation of 
food for consumption

itself from regional cuisines, which tend to

Marie-Antoine (Antonin) Carême (1783–1833)
antonin Carême, known as the “cook of kings 
and the king of cooks,” was an acknowledged 
master of french grande cuisine. abandoned on 
the streets of Paris as a child, he worked his way 
from cook’s helper in a working-class restaurant 
to become one of the most prestigious chefs 
of his (or, arguably, any other) time. During 
his career, he was chef to the famous french 
diplomat and gourmand Prince de Talleyrand, 
the Prince regent of england (who became 
King George iV), Tsar alexander i of russia and 
Baron de rothschild, among others.
Carême’s stated goal was to achieve lightness, 
grace, order and perspicuity in the preparation 
and presentation of food. as a pâtissier, he 
designed and prepared elaborate and elegant 
pastry and confectionery creations, many of 
which were based on architectural designs. 
(He wrote that “the fine arts are five in number, 
namely: painting, sculpture, poetry, music, 
architecture—the main branch of which is 
confectionery.”) as a showman, he garnished his 
dishes with ornamental hâtelets (skewers) threaded 
with colorful ingredients, such as crayfish and 
intricately carved vegetables, and presented his 
creations on elaborate socles (bases). as a saucier, 
he standardized the use of the flour and butter 
mixture called roux as a thickening agent, perfected 
recipes and devised a system for classifying sauces. 
as a garde-manger, Carême popularized cold 
cuisine, emphasizing molds and aspic dishes. as 
a culinary professional, he designed kitchen tools, 
equipment and uniforms.
as an author, Carême wrote and illustrated 
important texts on the culinary arts, including 
Le Maitre d’hotel français (c. 1822), describing the 
hundreds of dishes he personally created and 
cooked in the capitals of europe; Le Pâtissier 
royal parisien (c. 1825), containing fanciful 
designs for les pièces montées, the great decorative 
centerpieces that were the crowning glory of 
grand dinners; and his five-volume masterpiece 
on the state of his profession, L’Art de la cuisine 
française au XIXe siècle (1833), the last two 
volumes of which were completed after his death 
by his associate, Plumerey. Carême’s writings 
almost single-handedly refined and summarized 
five hundred years of culinary evolution. But his 
treatises were not mere cookbooks. rather he 
analyzed cooking, old and new, emphasizing 
procedure and order and covering every aspect 
of the art known as grande cuisine.
Carême died before age 50, burnt out, 
according to french poet and essayist laurent 
Tailhade, “by the flame of his genius and the 
coal of the spits.”

classic cuisine. He invented such dishes as Suprêmes de soles à l’aurore (or “fillet of 
sole at dawn”) in a blushing pink sauce and Pêche Melba (or “Peach Melba”), named 
after Australian singer Nellie Melba, a guest at the hotel. By doing so, he brought 
French cuisine into the 20th century.
The Mid-20th Century—Point and Nouvelle Cuisine
The mid-20th century witnessed a trend toward lighter, more naturally flavored and more 
simply prepared foods. Fernand Point was a master practitioner of this movement. But 
Point’s goal of simplicity and refinement was carried to even greater heights by a genera￾tion of French chefs Point trained: principally Paul Bocuse, Jean and Pierre Troisgros, 
Alain Chapel, François Bise and Louis Outhier. They, along with Michel Guérard and 
Roger Vergé, were the pioneers of nouvelle cuisine in the early 1970s. Their contempo￾rary, Gaston Lenôtre, modernized the classic pastries of grande cuisine, infusing them 
with the bright, fresh flavors of nouvelle cuisine.
Nouvelle cuisine rejected overly rich, needlessly complicated dishes and placed the 
emphasis on healthful eating. The ingredients must be absolutely fresh and of the high￾est possible quality; the cooking methods should be simple and direct whenever pos￾sible. The accompaniments and garnishes must be light and contribute to an overall 
 harmony; the completed plates must be elegantly designed and decorated. Following 
these guidelines, traditional cooking methods were applied to nontraditional ingredi￾ents, and ingredients were combined in new and previously unorthodox fashions.
 The Late 20th and Early 21st Centuries—An American 
Culinary Revolution
During the last 40–50 years, broad changes launched in the United States have affected 
the global culinary landscape. Two such trends are bold, international flavors and fresh 
food, simply prepared.
The popularity of international cuisine within the United States is due, in large part, 
to an unlikely source: the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965. Under its provisions, 
a large number of people from various Asian countries immigrated to the United States. 
They brought with them their rich culinary traditions and ignited America’s love affair 
with fiery hot cuisines. By the late 1970s many North Americans were no longer content 
with overly salty pseudo-Chinese dishes. They demanded authenticity and developed 
cravings for spicy dishes from the Szechuan and Hunan provinces of China, as well 
as Vietnam and Thailand. In the 1970s Mexican foods also became mainstream, and 
authentic regional Mexican dishes are now commonplace throughout the United States. 
Descendants of these and more recent immigrants are exploring the roots of their native 
cultures and cuisines, so the diverse ingredients and cooking of Brazil, Haiti, India, 
Korea, Nigeria, Somalia, Malaysia and Thailand, to name just a few countries, are readily 
available to the North American dining public.
During this same time period, restaurateurs and chefs began “Americanizing” the prin￾ciples of French nouvelle cuisine. When Alice Waters opened Chez Panisse in Berkeley, 
California, in 1971, her goal was to serve fresh food, simply prepared. Rejecting the grow￾ing popularity of processed and packaged foods, Waters used fresh, seasonal and locally 
grown produce in simple preparations that preserved and emphasized the foods’ natural 
flavors. Chez Panisse and the many chefs who passed through its kitchen launched 
a new style of American cuisine that became known as California or New American 
cuisine. As the culinary movement launched by Waters’s philosophy spread across the 
United States, farmers and chefs began working together to make fresh, locally grown 
foods available, and producers and suppliers began developing domestic sources for 
some of the high-quality ingredients that were once available only from overseas.
These chefs ushered in a period of bold experimentation. Chefs working in America 
began to combine ingredients and preparation methods from a variety of cuisines. Their 
work resulted in fusion cuisine. Fusion cuisine began with typical European techniques or 
dishes but added ingredients or preparation methods associated with one or more inter￾national or regional cuisines. A fillet of Norwegian salmon might be grilled over hickory 
wood and then served on a bed of Japanese soba noodles, for example, or a traditional 
classic cuisine a late 19th- and early 20th-century 
refinement and simplification of french grande 
cuisine. Classic (or classical) cuisine relies on the 
thorough exploration of culinary principles and 
techniques and emphasizes the refined preparation 
and presentation of superb ingredients.

Across the Atlantic, however, restaurant culture took on a very different look and 
purpose at this time, however. In the new United States, inexpensive dining facilities 
sprung up during the 19th century catering to the many working-class immigrants. 
People from Scandinavia, Ireland, Italy, China, Germany and elsewhere arrived on the 
promise of work, land and better futures. Many immigrants worked as transients along 
the new railroad lines, in western gold and silver mining, or as domestic servants or fac￾tory workers in urban centers. Street vendors and casual restaurants offering foods from 
home were welcomed by these immigrants, even though the dishes available gener￾ally lacked authentic ingredients. Gradually immigrant communities—such as the many 
Little Italy’s, Chinatowns and Greek villages—established food import systems still used 
today. Eventually these shops and cafes opened to anyone who found these previously 
unfamiliar foods appealing.
The Late 19th Century—Escoffier and Cuisine Classique
Following the lead set by the French in both culinary style and the restaurant business, res￾taurants opened in the United States and throughout Europe during the 19th century. Charles 
Ranhofer (1836–1899) was the first internationally renowned chef of an American restaurant—
Delmonico’s in New York City. In 1893, Ranhofer published his “Franco-American” encyclo￾pedia of cooking, The Epicurean, which contained more than 3500 recipes.
One of the finest restaurants outside France was the dining room at London’s Savoy 
Hotel, opened in 1898 under the directions of César Ritz (1850–1918) and Auguste 
Escoffier (1846–1935). There they created a restaurant that attracted royalty and aris￾tocratic women, a group rarely seen dining in public at the time. Escoffier is generally 
credited with refining the grande cuisine of Carême to create cuisine classique or 
Delmonico’s restaurant kitchen in new York 
City in 1902.
Auguste Escoffier (1846–1935)
auguste escoffier’s brilliant culinary career 
began at age 13 in his uncle’s restaurant and 
continued until his death at age 89. Called the 
“emperor of the world’s kitchens,” he is perhaps 
best known for defining french cuisine and dining 
during la Belle Époque (also referred to as the 
“Gay nineties”).
Unlike antonin Carême, escoffier never 
worked in an aristocratic household. rather he 
exhibited his culinary skills in the dining rooms 
of the finest hotels in europe, including the Place 
Vendôme in Paris and the savoy and Carlton 
hotels in london.
escoffier did much to enhance grande cuisine
as defined by Carême. Crediting Carême with 
providing the foundation for great—that is, 
french—cooking, escoffier simplified the 
profusion of flavors, dishes and garnishes 
typifying Carême’s work. for example, Carême 
would present elaborate displays of as many as 
150 dishes for guests at a private function. in 
contrast, escoffier would offer 11 dishes served 
tableside to each guest individually. escoffier also 
streamlined some of Carême’s overly elaborate 
and fussy procedures and classifications. for 
example, he reduced Carême’s elaborate system 
of classifying sauces into the five families of 
sauces still recognized today. escoffier sought 
simplicity and aimed for the perfect balance 
of a few superb ingredients. some consider his 
refinement of grande cuisine to have been so radical 
as to credit him with the development of a new 
cuisine referred to as cuisine classique (classic or 
classical cuisine).
escoffier’s many writings include Le Livre 
des menus (1912), in which, discussing the 
principles of a well-planned meal, he analogizes 
a great dinner to a symphony with contrasting 
movements that should be appropriate to the 
occasion, the guests and the season, and 
Ma cuisine (1934), surveying cuisine bourgeoise. 
But his most important contribution is a culinary 
treatise intended for the professional chef titled 
Le Guide culinaire (1903). still in use today, it 
is an astounding collection of more than 5000 
classic cuisine recipes and garnishes. in it, 
escoffier emphasizes the mastery of techniques, 
a thorough understanding of cooking principles 
and the appreciation of ingredients—attributes 
he considered to be the building blocks 
professional chefs should use to create 
great dishes.

classic cuisine. He invented such dishes as Suprêmes de soles à l’aurore (or “fillet of 
sole at dawn”) in a blushing pink sauce and Pêche Melba (or “Peach Melba”), named 
after Australian singer Nellie Melba, a guest at the hotel. By doing so, he brought 
French cuisine into the 20th century.
The Mid-20th Century—Point and Nouvelle Cuisine
The mid-20th century witnessed a trend toward lighter, more naturally flavored and more 
simply prepared foods. Fernand Point was a master practitioner of this movement. But 
Point’s goal of simplicity and refinement was carried to even greater heights by a genera￾tion of French chefs Point trained: principally Paul Bocuse, Jean and Pierre Troisgros, 
Alain Chapel, François Bise and Louis Outhier. They, along with Michel Guérard and 
Roger Vergé, were the pioneers of nouvelle cuisine in the early 1970s. Their contempo￾rary, Gaston Lenôtre, modernized the classic pastries of grande cuisine, infusing them 
with the bright, fresh flavors of nouvelle cuisine.
Nouvelle cuisine rejected overly rich, needlessly complicated dishes and placed the 
emphasis on healthful eating. The ingredients must be absolutely fresh and of the high￾est possible quality; the cooking methods should be simple and direct whenever pos￾sible. The accompaniments and garnishes must be light and contribute to an overall 
 harmony; the completed plates must be elegantly designed and decorated. Following 
these guidelines, traditional cooking methods were applied to nontraditional ingredi￾ents, and ingredients were combined in new and previously unorthodox fashions.
 The Late 20th and Early 21st Centuries—An American 
Culinary Revolution
During the last 40–50 years, broad changes launched in the United States have affected 
the global culinary landscape. Two such trends are bold, international flavors and fresh 
food, simply prepared.
The popularity of international cuisine within the United States is due, in large part, 
to an unlikely source: the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965. Under its provisions, 
a large number of people from various Asian countries immigrated to the United States.

French duck confit may be seasoned with lemongrass, ginger and chiles. Pizzas with untra￾ditional toppings, such as smoked salmon and caviar, launched Wolfgang Puck’s career 
in Los Angeles, California, in the early 1980s. Today such fusion is commonplace—from 
Chef Roy Choi’s Kogi BBQ Korean-Mexican tacos in Southern California to the subtle 
use of Asian seasonings in the classic sauces prepared by Jean-Georges Vongerichten at 
his restaurants throughout the country. But in the 1970s and 1980s, fusion represented a 
breakthrough in cooking that soon spread throughout the western culinary community.
In recent years, chefs have been instrumental in changing the way Americans dine 
by elevating the style and quality of the foods they serve. For example, the current pop￾ularity of sourdough and artisan bread can be traced directly to Chef Nancy Silverton
and her La Brea Bakery in Los Angeles. With degrees from Le Cordon Blue in London 
and Ecole Le Nôtre in France, Silverton settled in Los Angeles, joining Wolfgang Puck 
as the first pastry chef at Spago. Her cookbook Desserts, written during that time, is 
still considered a classic. Before opening La Brea Bakery, Silverton tested bread recipes 
using wild yeasts and various sourdough starters hundreds of times, finally settling on a 
dough made with wild yeast from grapes, then hand-shaped and given a slow two-day 
rise. Her attention to detail and consistency earned her business success and extensive 
industry recognition.
Chef Thomas Keller, who started cooking in restaurants in his teens, worked at 
renowned restaurants Guy Savoy and Le Taillevent in Paris before opening his own 
restaurant in 1994. Today experts regard Keller’s restaurants, The French Laundry in 
Yountville, California, and Per Se in New York City, as among the finest in the world. 
His cuisine, based on traditional French and modern cooking techniques, utilizes only 
foods in season, many grown on premises or sourced from local farmers. Known for 
producing lengthy tasting menus with clean flavors as well as his obsessive attention to 
detail, Keller develops professionalism in his staff, who are encouraged to be mindful, 
organized and “work clean.”
The focus of Chef Bryant Terry’s career is to create a “healthy, just and sustain￾able food system” for everyone. Now chef-in-residence at the Museum of the African 
Diaspora (MoAD) in San Francisco, he was born and raised in the American South, 
educated at NYU, then completed the Chef’s Training program at the Natural Gourmet 
Institute for Health and Culinary Arts in New York. Terry explains that his work cel￾ebrates the staples, flavor profiles and ingredients from the African continent, the 
Caribbean and the American South. He believes that what he celebrates can bring 
health and pleasure into people’s kitchens. Terry has published several acclaimed 
vegan cookbooks, including Afro-Vegan and Grub. Terry’s drive to encourage healthy 
eating stems from memories of his family’s small farms and gardens: “They didn’t call it 
local food, they didn’t call it the organic-local-seasonal-sustainable movement—it was 
just the way that they lived.”
Bayona restaurant, located in the heart of New Orleans’ French Quarter, has served 
award-winning cross-cultural cuisine for almost 35 years. Chef-owner Susan Spicer
uses fresh, locally grown ingredients in daily menus influenced by elements of European, 
Asian and Indian cuisine. Spicer is known for giving back to the community and feels 
her success is due to consistent hard work and her ability to “see the big picture” of the 
business and how “it all comes together on the plate.” While Bayona is an icon of the 
New Orleans culinary scene, Spicer has launched several other highly acclaimed restau￾rants in the area, often with former employees, whom she proudly mentors.
All the chefs mentioned in this text have received many awards for their work, 
including recognition from the James Beard Foundation. However, chefs of this caliber 
do not work for the awards and acclaim, they succeeded as professionals because they 
love the business, want to serve their customers well, care about their staff and find joy 
in always learning more.
Global Foods, Local Ingredients
The fluidity of international borders, the accessibility of global travel and the Internet 
have radically changed the way we cook and the foods we eat. During the first decades 
of the 21st century, chefs in the United States and other countries embraced simple

snacks, street food and home cooking from countries they visited online or in person. 
From tacos de birria (meat-stew filled tacos served hot in markets across Tijuana, Mexico) 
to Chinese xiaolongbao (steamed soup-filled buns), restaurant chefs have incorporated 
global flavors and street foods onto their menus. In addition, the signature flavors found 
in street food and other global cuisines are migrating onto menus in the form of dipping 
sauces, salad dressings, spicy rubs and humble sandwiches.
Today chefs are sourcing ingredients globally as well as working in tandem with 
farmers to supply their guests with fresh flavors while preserving local agriculture and 
heirloom varieties. As we discuss in detail later in this chapter, the concern for locally 
raised ingredients, referred to as the farm-to-table or locavore movement, has influ￾enced chefs to serve fresh seasonal foods, such as wild greens or shellfish from day boat 
clammers, that are grown or harvested within a few miles of their restaurants.
Modernist Cuisine
During the 1990s scientists, particularly in the United States, England, France and Spain, 
began to see food preparation as a distinct and worthy field of exploration. Chefs and scien￾tists wanted to understand why food behaved as it did, why traditional cooking techniques 
sometimes failed and how to improve culinary methods. They began seeking answers to 
these questions under the umbrella of molecular gastronomy, a term coined by the British 
physicist Nicholas Kurti and French chemist Hervé This in 1988. Inspired by the experi￾ments of molecular gastronomy, early 21st-century chefs reinvented the notion of cooking by 
employing ingredients and machinery more common in industrial food manufacturing than 
in restaurant kitchens. This offshoot of molecular gastronomy is now referred to as modern￾ist cuisine, first defined by Nathan Myhrvold (former Chief Technology Officer at Microsoft 
and the principal author of Modernist Cuisine, Modernist Bread and Modernist Pizza).
The founding chef of this movement is Ferran Adrià of elBulli, which operated in 
Roses, Spain, from 1987 to 2011. The food served at elBulli engaged all of one’s senses. 
Dinner was a tasting menu of up to 35 bite-sized dishes. What appeared to be cooked 
may actually have been flash frozen. An herb clipped to a spoon allowed guests to smell 
the aroma before tasting the herb in the dish. Warm foam tasted of carrots or mush￾rooms, hot gelatin encapsulated mango purée that resembled egg yolks and ravioli filled 
with liquid were some of the show-stopping techniques for which Adrià became known.
Current practitioners include Heston Blumenthal at The Fat Duck in Bray, England, 
Massimo Bottura at Osteria Francescana, Modena, Italy and Grant Achatz at Alinea in 
Chicago. The hallmarks of this high-tech haute cuisine include dehydrators, edible 
menus, gels and spheres, intensely flavored smoke and –30°F anti-griddles that “cook” 
liquefied food. These chefs produce foods that look like one thing, taste like something 
totally different and smell like childhood memories. Take Blumenthal’s bacon and egg 
ice cream as one example. It is a plated dessert consisting of ice cream made from a 
bacon-infused custard. All the elements of the savory breakfast appear on the plate 
including a cup of tea, served as a sweet jelly, and toast in the form of sweet, caramel￾ized brioche. As Blumenthal says, his goal is to make food exciting by overturning 
expectations. Although few restaurants are going to the extreme of replacing their cook￾tops with water baths and chemical freezers, many of the tools and techniques that these 
avant-garde chefs perfected are now being used and appreciated on a smaller scale by 
chefs who may add a gelled garnish or spheres of sauce to a traditional dish.
CHARACTERISTICS OF THE MODERN FOOD 
SERVICE OPERATION
From Monsieur Boulanger’s humble establishment, a great industry has grown. The 
growth and diversification of the food service industry in Europe and the Americas is 
due in part to the Industrial Revolution of the 19th century and the social and economic 
changes it brought, including the introduction of new culinary technologies, food sup￾plies and consumer concerns.

Culinary Technologies
Technology has always had a profound effect on cooking. For example, the development 
of clay and, later, metal vessels that could contain liquids and withstand and conduct 
heat offered prehistoric cooks the opportunity to stew, make soups and porridge, pickle 
and brine foods and control fermentation. But it was not until the rapid technological 
advances fostered by the Industrial Revolution that anything approaching the modern 
kitchen was possible.
One of the most important advancements was the introduction of the cast-iron stove. 
Prior to the 19th century, most cooking was done on spits or grills or in cauldrons or 
pots set on or in a wood- or coal-burning hearth. Hearthside cooking did not lend itself 
well to the simultaneous preparation of many items or to items requiring constant and 
delicate attention. With the introduction of cast-iron stoves during the 1800s, cooks could 
more comfortably and safely approach the heat source and control its temperatures. On 
the new cook stoves, they could also prepare foods in the small quantities needed to 
serve individual diners on demand.
Also of great importance were developments in food preservation and storage tech￾niques. For thousands of years food had been preserved by sun-drying, salting, smoking, 
pickling, sugar-curing or fermenting. Salt-cured codfish and salmon have been staples in 
Scandinavia for millennia, and the earliest household records and cookery manuscripts 
from medieval Britain include inventories of bacon and salted meats. Although useful, 
these ancient procedures dramatically change the appearance and flavor of most foods. 
By the early 19th century, preserving techniques began to emerge that had minimal 
effect on appearance and flavor. For example, by 1800 food could be “canned” by stor￾ing it in sterilized glass jars subjected to very high heat. An early mechanical refrigerator 
was developed by the mid-1800s; soon reliable iceboxes, refrigerators and, later, freezers 
were available. During the 20th century freeze-drying, vacuum-packing and irradiation 
became common preservation techniques.
Developments in transportation technology were also underway. During the 19th 
century steam-powered ships and railroads brought foods quickly to market from distant 
suppliers. Since the mid-20th century temperature-controlled cargo ships, trains, trucks 
and airplanes have all been used as part of an integrated worldwide food transporta￾tion network. Combined with dependable food preservation and storage techniques, 
improved transportation networks freed chefs from seasonal and geographic limitations 
in their choice of foods and expanded consumers’ culinary horizons.
Advancements in technology also facilitated or even eliminated much routine kitchen 
work. Since the 19th century chefs have relied increasingly on mechanical and motorized 
food processors, mixers and cutters as well as a wealth of sophisticated kitchen equip￾ment from high-carbon stainless steel knife blades to infrared thermometers and ultrasonic 
homogenizers. Foodservice operators faced with staff shortages are even turning towards 
robots to perform repetitive kitchen tasks such as preparing French fried potatoes.
Food Supplies
Modern food preservation, storage and transportation techniques have made both fresh 
and exotic foods regularly available to chefs and consumers. Because of advances in 
packaging and transportation, foodstuffs grown or made virtually anywhere in the world 
are now available to restaurants regardless of season or location.
Last century’s advancements in agriculture, such as the switch from organic to chemi￾cal fertilizers and the introduction of pesticides and drought- or pest-resistant strains, 
increased yields of healthy crops. Traditional hybridization techniques and, more 
recently, genetic engineering have produced new varieties of grains, such as soybeans, 
corn, rapeseeds and rice, which are resistant to herbicides or insects. Although scientists 
may argue that such engineering simply speeds up the process of natural selection, con￾sumers are often more concerned about the unforeseen impact on consumer health and 
unintended consequences to the environment. Governments around the world regulate, 
restrict or outright ban the sale of foodstuffs containing genetically modified organisms 
(GMOs) on a case-by-case basis.

Additionally, advancements in animal husbandry and aquaculture have led to a more reli￾able supply of leaner meat, poultry and fish. Foods found traditionally only in the wild (for 
example, game, wild rice and many mushrooms) are now being raised commercially and are 
routinely available. The commercialization of foodstuffs has created a backlash among some 
consumers and chefs, however. New concerns about sustainability and support for local 
farmers and food producers present the industry with new challenges and new opportunities 
for chefs to revise their menus and adopt ecologically based business practices.
Consumer Concerns
Consumer concerns about nutrition and diet have fueled changes in the food service 
industry. Obviously, what we eat affects our health. Adequate amounts of certain nutri￾ents promote good health by preventing deficiencies; studies show that good nutrition 
also helps prevent chronic diseases and increases longevity. Chefs must now understand 
human nutritional needs and the various special diets followed by customers. Beyond 
simply reducing fat and sugar for weight control, chefs must accommodate custom￾ers’ allergies, specialized diets due to illnesses and ethical or social dining concerns of 
groups such as vegetarians and locavores.
The public is also rightfully concerned about food safety. Federal, state and local 
governments help promote food safety by inspecting and grading meats and poultry, 
regulating label contents for packaged foods and setting sanitation standards. The last 
line of defense, however, are the restaurant workers who prepare and serve food. It is 
up to you, as a culinary professional, to follow sanitation and food safety guidelines to 
protect others from injury or illness.
Concerns about nutrition and food safety have also resulted in renewed interest in 
local and organically grown fruits and vegetables and free-range-raised animals. The 
local food movement and the concern for sustainable food production are leading chefs 
to find new sources for ingredients and expand their community involvement.
Local Production
Fresh foods travel from the producer to the consumer by two basic methods: (1) the 
industrial, commercial system, which operates huge, consolidated farms and global 
transportation networks and (2) small local or regional systems. One key difference is 
how far the food travels from where it is grown or produced to the end consumer. Local 
systems distribute food items over short distances. These local farms are often small fam￾ily farms, which are defined by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) as 
those operated by the people who own the land or the animals and have sales of less 
than $350,000 per year.
While the word local implies that the food item is being sold close to where it was 
grown or produced, there is no consistent definition for that term. Many consumers and 
organizations working in this field, such as farmer’s markets, cite a radius of 50–100 
miles (80–160 km) from production to point of sale as the determining factor. Weather 
conditions, urbanization and production capacity of the area also have an impact on the 
definition of local, sometimes extending the acceptable zone into a larger regional area. 
The USDA indicates that food can be marketed as local or regional if the total distance 
the product was transported is less than 400 miles (640 km) from where it originated.
Chefs are using the public’s interest in eating locally produced foods to create restau￾rant menus featuring such products. Some chefs, like their pre-industrial predecessors, 
now grow their own produce, raise their own pigs or chickens and forage from nearby 
forests for ingredients. They may contract with local farmers, beekeepers, cheese makers 
or seafood suppliers for products, building their menus according to product availability, 
rather than serving out-of-season items or those transported long distances. In its pur￾est version, farm-to-table means that the foods served come directly from a local farm, 
without passing through a market, distributor or grocery store. It implies a relationship 
between the chef and the farmer, with the chef serving the farm’s products at their peak 
of freshness, ripeness and flavor. Farm-to-table menus may change daily due to product 
availability, and preparation techniques focus on retaining nutrients and freshness.
A Very Big Business 
Indeed
The national restaurant association, 
which closely monitors the economic 
impact of the U.s. food service industry, 
issued the following statistics for 2021:
▪ There are nearly one million 
foodservice outlets in the United 
states; total annual sales were 
approximately $799 billion.
▪ more than 14.5 million people were 
employed in the restaurant industry.
▪ nearly half of all american adults have 
worked in the food service industry at 
some time during their lives.

Sustainability
It is important to keep in mind that coming from nearby or being produced on a small 
farm does not necessarily mean the foods themselves are healthier, organic or in any way 
more natural. Sustainable and local are related concepts, but not necessarily the same 
thing. Sustainability is a broad concept, referring to a variety of practices used to mini￾mize human impact on the environment and protect natural resources. Sustainability is 
an integrated and systematic approach to what and how we consume. Energy and water 
consumption, land use, building construction and waste disposal all have an impact on 
sustainability. In the realm of food service, sustainability refers to growing or harvesting 
foodstuffs in an environmentally and socially responsible manner.
Chefs are becoming more aware and concerned about how their products and busi￾nesses impact the environment. Experts such as Chef Jeong Kwan study sustainable 
farming practices, including avoiding the use of herbicides and pesticides and reducing 
consumption of fossil fuels. Reducing packaging, composting and selling directly to 
consumers all help farmers lessen their environmental impact. Such practices can also 
improve the socioeconomic conditions of the community and the health of farm workers.
For food service establishments, sustainability can begin with some of the following 
simple steps:
	▪ Minimize food miles—the distance food travels to reach the establishment—by 
purchasing locally grown foodstuffs.
	▪ Grow herbs and produce onsite to ensure freshness and reduce food miles.
	▪ Incorporate diverse, seasonal locally grown foods into your menu.
	▪ Educate your staff so that they can explain these sometimes–unfamiliar items to 
customers in a positive manner.
	▪ Compost vegetable trimmings and coffee grounds to share with a local farm that 
recycles waste into nourishment.
	▪ Install a water filtration system and replace bottled water with your own filtered 
water served to customers in reusable glass.
	▪ Eliminate single-use plastics whenever possible.
	▪ Use cleaning products certified as nonpolluting.
	▪ Use eco-friendly and biodegradable paper products and take-out containers.
	▪ Recycle cardboard, metal, glass and other trash.
Even without planting a restaurant garden, almost any chef can participate in these 
movements by buying as many seasonal, locally produced products as possible and 
using imported items, such as coffee, bananas and chocolate, that are fairtrade certified.
Chefs can also use the principles of sustainability to foster their creativity and values. 
Danish Chef René Redzepi and his colleagues have received worldwide renown for 
using only local products, many never–considered foodstuffs, to create an exciting new 
cuisine. At Noma and Restaurant 108 in Copenhagen, he and his staff spend months 
experimenting with such ingredients as forest onions, sea buckthorn and wood ants 
foraged from land and beaches around Copenhagen to create ever-changing, highly 
unusual seasonal menus. But his impact extends beyond haute cuisine. Following a set 
of principles that stress sustainability and a respect for the natural world, Redzepi, Claus 
Meyer and other Noma cofounders are having a global impact. Some programs under 
their direction include food training for the underserved, research and development for 
sustainable food production systems from farm to factory, documenting the culinary 
traditions of world cuisines and improving school meals in the United States. In 2011, 
Redzepi founded MAD, a think tank and conference whose mission is to “empower 
cooks, servers, and eaters to create sustainable change.”
Social Changes
Demographic and social changes have contributed to the diversification of 
the food service industry by creating or identifying new consumer groups that 
have their own desires or preferences. The needs of dual-income households,

single-parent families and an aging population, as well as other market segments, 
impact the places and ways in which foods are sold and consumed. By tailoring 
their menus, prices and décor accordingly, food service operators target consumer 
groups defined by age, type of household, income, education, geography and 
many other factors.
The number and types of institutions providing food services is also increasing. 
These include hospitals, schools, retirement centers, sports facilities, cruise ships, 
private clubs, grocery stores, hotels and resorts (which may in turn have fine dining, 
coffee shop, quick service, banquet and room service facilities), supermarkets, food 
trucks, factories and office buildings. Changes brought on by the global pandemic 
have reshaped many foodservice operations, pushing them into the take-out and 
delivery businesses. The lines between restaurant meals and at-home dining have 
blurred, as food is now prepared and consumed in a greater number of environments 
than ever before.
At the same time, consumers are becoming better educated and more sophisticated 
through travel or exposure to the many television programs, websites, books, blogs and 
videos about food. Educated consumers provide a market for new cuisines as well as 
appreciation for innovative quality food service.
Jeong Kwan (1957–)
Jeong Kwan grew up on a farm in Youngju, 
south Korea, but chose the path of an 
ascetic Buddhist nun as a teenager, joining 
the 7th-century Baekyangsa Temple nestled 
against a mountain in what is now naejangsan 
national Park. Kwan’s first work assignment 
as a novice was in the monastery’s kitchen 
where she prepared meals for temple members 
following strict Buddhist dietary guidelines but 
without the aid of recipes. fifty years later she 
is still there, growing and preparing food for the 
temple’s residents and sharing her philosophy 
with occasional visitors. Kwan has become the 
icon and guardian of Korean Buddhist temple 
cuisine. With neither formal culinary training 
nor experience working in a restaurant, she has 
nevertheless become an inspiration to some 
of the world’s top chefs, such as eric ripert 
(pictured with Kwan here), mingoo Kang and 
rene redzepi, who visit Korea to study with 
her. Kwan gained international prominence 
as a featured chef in the netflix documentary 
“Chef ’s Table.” in 2022, asia’s 50 Best 
restaurants honored her with its icon award.
Temple cuisine omits meat, poultry, 
dairy and seafood as well as pungent herbs, 
specifically garlic, onions, green onion, chives 
and leeks. By using a wide variety of fresh 
and fermented vegetables and other plants, 
a temple cuisine diet is highly nutritious 
and helps keep the mind calm. and in the 
hands of a master like Kwan, the cuisine is 
a visual delight and flavorful experience. at 
Baekyangsa, Kwan and the other nuns and 
monks grow or forage most of their own food. 
even condiments such as soy sauce, sesame oil, 
doenjang (soybean paste) and fruit syrups are 
made by hand and often aged for years.
Until recently she was not out in the world, 
and she has no interest in gourmet ingredients 
or fine dining. as Kwan explains, she is not 
a chef but a Buddhist nun whose practice 
is devoted to preparing and sharing food 
in ways that preserve the environment and 
benefit all sentient beings. she encourages 
people to get to know and understand food 
ingredients in the way they might get to know 
other people, by spending time with them. 
she urges everyone to think about how food is 
treated and the nature and purpose of eating. 
“You can’t just do whatever you want to do 
with foods,” she says. “You must understand 
their natural taste, flavors and textures. To do 
that, you must know yourself, which is part of 
Buddhist practice.”
Kwan uses the natural processes of 
fermentation and dehydration to develop flavors 
and aromas, applying time and air as cooking 
techniques. as a farmer she watches closely 
as fruits, vegetables and other plants mature, 
adjusting her preparation techniques and use 
of seasonings accordingly. at one stage, lightly 
salting a vegetable is best, but later the same 
vegetable benefits more from a splash of her 
aged homemade soy sauce or wild sesame oil.
according to Kwan, food is not something 
to be mastered; rather, the cook must bend 
to the will of the food and treat ingredients 
with respect. rarely working from recipes, her 
dishes differ each time she prepares them, 
depending on who she is cooking with or for 
whom she is cooking. she urges non-Buddhists 
and Buddhist practitioners alike to think 
about how food is treated and the nature and 
purpose of eating. “To me, cooking is not 
about being fancy or showing off difficult skills, 
but becoming one with the ingredients,” she 
explains. “What she does has nothing to do 
with what professional chefs do,” explains Chef 
ripert. “it’s not about ratings; there’s no ego 
involved. it’s just Zen practice, and her food 
happens to be amazing.”

ORGANIZATION OF CLASSIC 
AND MODERN KITCHENS
To function efficiently a food service operation must be well organized and staffed with 
appropriate personnel. This staff is traditionally called a brigade. Escoffier is credited 
with developing the classic kitchen brigade system used in large restaurant kitchens. 
From the chaos and redundancy found in the private kitchens of the 19th century’s aris￾tocracy, he created a distinct hierarchy of responsibilities and functions for food service 
operations. Modern kitchens use a simplified version of this brigade in order to reduce 
labor costs and streamline operations. Figure 1.1 lists the positions in a kitchen brigade.
Today’s food service operations are generally led by an executive chef, who coordi￾nates kitchen activities and directs the kitchen staff’s training and work efforts. Executive 
chefs plan menus and create recipes. They set and enforce nutrition, safety and sanitation 
standards and participate in (or at least observe) the preparation and presentation of menu 
items to ensure that quality standards are rigorously and consistently maintained. They are 
also responsible for purchasing food items and, often, equipment. In some food service 
operations, the executive chef may assist in designing the menu, dining room and kitchen. 
Executive chefs may also work with food purveyors, catering directors, equipment vendors, 
financial consultants, the media, sanitation inspectors and dietitians. In some operations a 
chef with some or all of these responsibilities may be referred to as a chef de cuisine.
The executive chef is assisted by a sous-chef or executive sous-chef, whose primary 
responsibility is to make sure that the food is prepared, portioned, garnished and presented 
according to the executive chef’s standards. The sous-chef may be the cook principally respon￾sible for producing menu items and supervising the kitchen and staff at different work stations.
Line cooks (or section cooks) are responsible for preparing menu items according 
to recipe specifications. They may be assigned to a specific area, such as the broiler or 
pantry station, as was common in a classic French kitchen brigade. A tournant or swing 
cook is cross-trained and capable of working several stations and is assigned to the 
area where the need is greatest during each shift.
Pastry chefs are responsible for developing recipes for and preparing desserts, pas￾tries, frozen desserts and breads. They are usually responsible for purchasing the food 
items used in the bakeshop.
Prep cooks, assistants and apprentices are employed as entry-level workers 
throughout modern kitchens.
New styles of dining have created new positions since Escoffier’s days. The most notable is 
the short-order cook, who is responsible for quickly preparing foods to order. A short-order 
cook will work the broiler, deep-fat fryer and griddle as well as make sandwiches and even 
some sautéed items. Another is the institutional cook, who generally works with large quan￾tities of packaged or prepared foods for a captive market, such as a school, hospital or prison.
A restaurant may employ a master chef (maître cuisinier), master pastry chef
(maître pâtissier) or master baker (maître boulanger, or bäckermeister in German). 
These titles recognize the highest level of achievement; only highly skilled and experi￾enced professionals who have demonstrated their expertise and knowledge in written 
and practical exams are entitled to use them. These titles recall the European guild 
tradition still alive in many countries today. In France and Germany, for example, a 
chef, pastry chef or baker must pursue many years of classroom and job training, work 
as an apprentice and pass numerous examinations before acquiring the right to the 
title “master.” In the United States, professional organizations administer programs that 
certify the professional experience of chefs, pastry chefs and bakers.
ATTRIBUTES OF SUCCESSFUL CULINARY 
PROFESSIONALS
Although there is no one recipe for producing a good professional chef, with knowledge, 
skill, taste, judgment, dedication and pride, a student chef will mature into someone who 
understands the importance of ethical, professional behavior in and out of the kitchen, and 
who is prepared to change jobs or career paths according to personal or industry needs.

Knowledge
Chefs must be able to identify, purchase, utilize and prepare a wide variety of foods. 
They should be able to train and supervise a safe, skilled and efficient staff. To do all this 
successfully, chefs must possess a body of knowledge and understand and apply cer￾tain scientific and business principles. Schooling helps. A professional culinary program 
should, at a minimum, provide the student chef with a basic knowledge of foods, food 
styles and the methods used to prepare foods. Student chefs should also understand 
sanitation, nutrition and business procedures such as food costing.
In this way we follow the trail blazed by Escoffier, who wrote in the introduction to 
Le Guide culinaire that his book is not intended to be a compendium of recipes slavishly 
followed, but rather a tool that leaves his colleagues “free to develop their own methods 
and follow their own inspiration; ... the art of cooking ... will evolve as a society evolves ... 
only basic rules remain unalterable.”
Skill
Culinary schooling alone does not turn a student into a chef. Nothing but practical, 
hands-on experience will provide even the most academically gifted student with the 
skills needed to produce, consistently and efficiently, quality foods or to organize, train, 
motivate and supervise a staff.
No one becomes a successful executive chef or restaurant owner overnight. New 
workers, even those who have graduated from culinary programs, need time and expe￾rience to develop and hone their skills. Therefore many graduates start in entry-level 
positions. Do not be discouraged; advancement will come, and the training pays off in 
the long run. Many highly regarded chefs, including Thomas Keller, Anthony Bourdain 
and Bobby Flay, began their careers as dishwashers. Moving up from dishwasher to prep 
cook or from line cook to sous-chef are natural steps in a beginner’s professional career.
Culinary styles and fashions change frequently. What does not go out of fashion are 
well-trained, skilled and knowledgeable chefs. They can adapt.
Taste
In addition to being knowledgeable or skilled, a chef must be able to produce foods that 
taste great, or the consumer will not return. Chefs can do this only if they are confident 
about their own perceptions of flavor and taste.
The human perception of taste is a complex combination of smell, taste, sight, 
sound and texture. All the senses are involved in the enjoyment of eating; all must be 
considered in creating or preparing a dish. The chef should develop a flavor memory 
by sampling foods, both familiar and unfamiliar. Chefs should also think about what 
they taste and the flavor they perceive, making notes and experimenting with flavor 
combinations and cooking methods. But a chef should not be inventive simply for the 
sake of invention. Rather a chef must consider how the flavors, appearances, textures 
and aromas of various foods will interact to create a total taste experience.
Judgment
Selecting menu items, determining how much of each item to purchase, deciding whether 
and how to combine ingredients and approving finished items for service are all matters of 
judgment. Although knowledge and skill play a role in developing judgment, sound judg￾ment comes only with experience, and real experience is often accompanied by failure. Do 
not be upset or surprised when a dish does not turn out as you expected. Learn from your 
mistakes as well as from your successes; this is the only way to develop sound judgment.
Dedication
Becoming a chef is hard work; so is being one. The work is often physically taxing, the hours 
are usually long and the pace is frequently hectic. As a new cook, you may be expected to 
work nights, weekends and holidays. In the world of restaurants and hotels, these are the 
busiest times that require the most staff. Work hours may include early mornings, late nights 
The Dining Room 
Brigade
like the back-of-the-house (kitchen) staff, 
the front-of-the-house (dining room) 
staff is also organized into a brigade. a 
traditional dining room brigade is led by 
the dining room manager (maître d’hotel or 
maître d’), who generally trains all service 
personnel, oversees wine selections and 
works with the chef to develop the menu. 
The dining room manager organizes the 
seating chart, seats guests and oversees 
the following subordinates:
▪ The wine steward (sommelier), who 
is responsible for the wine service, 
including purchasing wines, assisting 
guests in selecting wines and serving 
the wines
▪ The headwaiter (chef de salle), who is 
responsible for service throughout 
the dining room or a section of it; in 
smaller operations this role may be 
assumed by the maître d’ or a captain
▪ The captains (chefs d’étage), who are 
responsible for explaining the menu 
to guests and taking their orders; they 
are also responsible for any tableside 
preparations
▪ The front waiters (chefs de rang), who 
are responsible for assuring that the 
tables are set properly for each course, 
foods are delivered properly to the 
proper tables and the needs of the 
guests are met
▪ The back waiters (demi-chefs de rang
or commis de rang, also known as 
buspersons), who are responsible for 
clearing plates, refilling water glasses 
and other general tasks appropriate for 
new dining room workers
Whether a restaurant uses this entire 
array of staff depends on the nature and 
size of the restaurant and the type of 
service provided.
M01_LABE1163_07_SE_C01.indd 13 28/10/23 7:16 AM14 CHaPTer one
and back-to-back shifts. Depending on your personality, you may find the adrenalin rush of 
a hectic restaurant dinner service exciting, or you may prefer quiet, early morning bakery 
preparations. In either situation, cooks must generally perform in close quarters, stand for 
several hours at a time, lift heavy pans of food and work around hot stoves and deep fryers. 
Despite these pressures, the chef is expected to efficiently produce consistently good food 
that is properly prepared, seasoned, garnished and presented. To do so, the chef must be 
dedicated to the job and display their work ethic every day regardless of the circumstances.
The food service industry is competitive and depends on the continuing goodwill of an 
often fickle public. One bad dish or one off night can result in a disgruntled diner and lost 
business. Chefs should always be mindful of the food prepared and the customer served. Chefs 
must also be dedicated to their staff. Virtually all food service operations rely on teamwork to 
get the job done well. Good teamwork requires a positive attitude and dedication to a shared 
goal, which is as impressive to a prospective employer as well-honed technical skills.
Chefs should demonstrate their dedication to the profession itself and to their peers 
as well. Numerous regional, national and international organizations provide services, 
 educational seminars and networking opportunities for members. By joining and par￾ticipating in relevant associations, chefs may encounter new job opportunities, new 
 products and new ideas to expand their horizons.
 Pride
Not only is it important that the job be well done, but the professional chef should have 
a sense of pride in doing it well. Pride should also extend to personal appearance and 
behavior in and around the kitchen. The professional chef should be well-groomed and 
in a clean, well-maintained uniform when working.
The professional chef’s uniform consists of comfortable shoes, trousers (often solid 
black or black-and-white checked), a white double-breasted jacket and an apron. 
(Some establishments also require a neckerchief usually knotted or secured with a 
metal ring while the cut and color of a chef’s uniform may vary in less formal establish￾ments.) The uniform has certain utilitarian aspects: Checked trousers disguise stains; 
the double-breasted white jacket can be rebuttoned to hide dirt and the double layer of 
fabric protects from scalds and burns; and the apron protects the uniform and insulates 
the body. Regardless of its style, this uniform should be worn with pride. Shoes should 
be polished; trousers and jacket should be pressed. The crowning element of the uni￾form is the toque, the tall white hat worn by chefs almost everywhere.
PROFESSIONAL ETHICS
As a professional culinarian, you are expected to be honest, responsible and ethical. 
Professional organizations, such as the American Culinary Federation (ACF), the International 
Association of Culinary Professionals (IACP), the World Association of Chefs’ Societies 
(Worldchefs) and others, require their members to adhere to codes of ethics. Violations 
of these codes poison the work environment and your professional reputation. In many 
instances violations of these codes will result in termination from a job. These codes gener￾ally include specific behaviors that all professionals, in any industry, should follow, such as:
	▪ Conducting yourself with honesty, fairness and integrity
	▪ Avoiding conflicts of interest or misuse of monies
	▪ Not discriminating against others or engaging in sexual harassment
	▪ Accurately representing yourself, your work experiences and your education
	▪ Supporting the growth and professional activities of colleagues
	▪ Cooperating with coworkers in a fair, considerate manner
	▪ Acknowledging the contribution of other people and their cultures
	▪ Respecting team members and supervisors
	▪ Complying with local and national laws and regulations
work ethic a belief in the virtue of hard work, 
honesty, discipline and respect on the job

Bocuse and his staff. Bocuse earned the 
title of Un des Meilleurs Ouvriers de France,
his restaurant held three michelin stars for 
52 years, the longest any restaurant held

institute of america’s Chef of the Century.
La Toque Blanche
although the toque traces its origin to the 
monasteries of the 6th century, the style 
worn today was introduced at the end of 
the 19th century. most chefs now wear 
a standard 6- or 9-inch-high toque, but 
historically, a cook’s rank in the kitchen 
dictated the type of hat worn. Beginners 
wore flat-topped calottes; cooks with 
more advanced skills wore low toques and 
the master chefs wore high toques called 
dodin-bouffants. Culinary lore holds that 
the toque’s pleats—101 in all—represent 
the 101 ways its wearer can successfully 
prepare eggs.

CULINARY CAREERS
Young adults entering the working world now can look forward to several different 
careers during their working lifetimes. Luckily, the choices available to well-trained culi￾nary professionals now extend far beyond the kitchen. A culinary education prepares 
you for entry-level positions in hotel, catering and restaurant kitchens, but it can also 
lead to a wide range of other employment opportunities following graduation and for 
many years into the future. As a working chef, you may choose to focus in a specific area 
of food preparation, such as garde-manger, pastry, butchery, or you might prefer to be a 
generalist—a tournant or swing cook—able to work at virtually any station. After a few 
years of experience your career may change or go in a different direction, however. This 
is normal and can be exciting.
 Hospitality Groups
Multi-concept food service groups (hospitality groups) are a dynamic sector of the industry, 
offering many opportunities for employment and advancement. Unlike chain restaurants, 
which manage the same brand in many locations, multi-concept hospitality groups share 
management and values but operate a portfolio of different types and brands of operations. 
By working for a hospitality group, a cook can stay with one company while experiencing a 
variety of food service operations. Most provide training and mentorship to help employees 
advance along various career paths within the organization’s diverse businesses. Employees 
might transfer between properties for a promotion or to simply learn new skills.
Groups may include a combination of fine dining restaurants, bars, casual theme res￾taurants, food trucks, and cafes serving a variety of cuisines. They are often established 
under the umbrella of successful chefs who wish to expand their reach and recognition 
without copying their flagship restaurant. This variety allows the chef to explore differ￾ent cuisines and styles of service without forsaking their original success. Often privately 
owned, such groups understand marketing and are founded on the owner-managers’ 
entrepreneurial drive and creativity. Some come from a culinary background, others from 
hotels, business management or even real estate development. The chefs and managers 
at individual properties may eventually become owners themselves, and partnerships 
with entrepreneurial chefs can provide behind-the-scenes business and financial support 
for that chef’s existing concept.
A group’s strength lies in both operations and back-end management. As an opera￾tor, a group oversees chefs, wait staff, menus and the daily food service business. As a 
management company, a group can handle human resources, accounting, purchasing, 
marketing, building maintenance and other tasks simultaneously for all concepts in the 
group, resulting in lower costs and more efficiency.
Some multi-concept restaurant groups are chef-owned, such as the Marcus Samuelsson 
Group in New York and the Tom Douglas Seattle Kitchen group in Seattle. Not only 
do chef-owner groups operate restaurants, but they might also produce cookbooks and 
retail food products, offering staff opportunities to work in recipe and product devel￾opment, marketing and writing. Innovative groups share a work culture and business 
vision. Take Chef José Andrés’ ThinkFoodGroup for example. Those who work for any 
of its 28 restaurants across the United States and internationally are invited to share 
in the company’s mission “to change the world through the power of food,” which 
could involve preparing fast-food vegetarian cuisine or working at fundraising events 
for World Central Kitchen, the non-profit food relief organization founded by José and 
Patricia Andrés.
Alternative Careers
A culinary professional may enjoy cooking, developing recipes and producing food for 
others without working in a traditional kitchen, however. For example, personal chefs 
work in private homes cooking for a family or an individual. International cruise lines 
and private yachts also employ cooks and chefs, as do corporate office buildings, fac￾tories and college food service operations. Experienced culinary professionals may be

employed by food manufacturers, food distributors or large restaurant groups in test 
kitchens, product research and development, sensory evaluation labs and marketing 
departments. Grocery stores hire chefs to develop and prepare home-meal replacement 
foods and conduct in-store demonstrations. Hospitals and assisted-living residences need 
trained chefs, in addition to registered dietitians and nutrition specialists, to accommo￾date the needs and interests of their clients. 
 Alternative careers for culinary graduates include working for food publications, 
including books, magazines and digital media, which need culinarians as writers, crit￾ics, recipe developers, food stylists and editors. You might even move into restaurant 
consulting, or open your own culinary business as an entrepreneur . With the proper 
advanced education and experience, you may find opportunities to teach in a profes￾sional culinary school or for avocational or community classes. 
 Advanced education is available in gastronomy, hospitality, tourism, restaurant man￾agement, culinary entrepreneurship and related fields. Many non-degree programs offer 
specific training for cooks in subjects as diverse as international cuisines, wine and 
spirits, financial management and pâtisserie. A culinarian, even one with many years of 
experience, may work an entry-level stage or internship, lasting from a few days to a 
few months, in a world-class kitchen simply for the opportunity to increase knowledge 
and skills. Self-education should continue by reading industry publications, attending 
conferences and trade shows and traveling locally and abroad. International travel allows 
you to experience different cuisines firsthand, perhaps by taking classes in the local cui￾sine and food culture. 
 In short, graduation from culinary school is just the beginning of your education. 
Your specific occupation may change or evolve depending on personal desires and abili￾ties, family needs and unexpected opportunities. Wherever you work you must continue 
learning and developing your skills. A true professional never stops learning.

 The U.S. Centers for disease Control and Prevention (CdC) identifies more than 
250 diseases that can be transmitted through food. Many can cause serious illness; 
some are even deadly. Providing consumers with safe food is the food handler’s 
most important responsibility. Unfortunately food handlers are also the primary cause of 
 food-related illnesses. Understanding what causes food-borne illnesses and what can be done 
to prevent them will help you be better able to protect your customers. 
 This chapter is not meant to be a complete discussion about food safety and sanitation 
in food service operations. its primary goal is to alert you to practices that can result in 
 food-borne illnesses. Federal, state, county and municipal health, building and other codes 
are designed in part to ensure that food is handled in a safe manner and that the workplace 
itself is also safe. Chefs should consult their local health department for information and 
guidance and always be conscious of what they can do to create and maintain a safe product 
as well as a safe environment for their customers, their fellow employees and themselves. 
 SANITATION 
 Every food service business must take sanitation seriously. Sanitation refers to the cre￾ation and maintenance of conditions that will prevent any contamination that might lead 
to a food-borne illness. It involves removing or reducing harmful substances to a level 
that is deemed safe by government health agencies. Proper sanitation requires following 
time and temperature standards, avoiding cross-contamination and consistently following 
established safe food-handling protocols. Failure to do so can lead to a variety of injuries 
or illnesses. Even as few as two or three sick customers can be enough to cause major 
monetary loss, negative media attention, lawsuits and irreparable damage to a business’s 
reputation. Local government health inspectors are responsible for issuing licenses and 
conducting periodic inspections to ensure that regulations are being followed. It is your 
responsibility as a cook or food server to make sure that sanitation techniques are being 
followed properly to avoid contamination on behalf of every customer, every day. 
Contamination refers to the presence, generally unintended, of harmful organisms 
or substances, called contaminants . Contaminants can be biological, chemical or physi￾cal. When consumed in sufficient quantities, food-borne contaminants can cause illness 
or injury, long-lasting disease or even death. Contamination occurs in two ways: direct 
contamination and cross-contamination. 
Direct contamination is the contamination of raw foods or the plants or animals 
from which they come, in their natural settings or habitats. Chemical and biological con￾taminants, such as pesticides, bacteria and fungi, are present in the air, soil and water. 
This means that foods can be easily contaminated by their general exposure to the 
environment. For example, grains can be contaminated by soil fumigants in the field, or 
shellfish can become contaminated by ingesting toxic marine algae. 
 Chemicals and microorganisms generally cannot move on their own, however. 
Contaminants need to be transported, a process known as cross-contamination . The 
major cause of cross-contamination is people. Food handlers can transfer biological, 
chemical and physical contaminants to food while processing, preparing, cooking or 
serving. Sanitation is the correction of problems caused by direct contamination and the 
prevention of problems caused by cross-contamination during processing and service. 
 DIRECT BIOLOGICAL CONTAMINANTS 
 Several microorganisms , primarily bacteria, parasites, viruses and fungi, are biological 
hazards , contaminants that can cause biologically based food-borne illnesses. By under￾standing how these organisms live and reproduce, you can better understand how to 
protect food from them.

tiny plants and animals that can be seen only 
through a microscope 
 biological hazard a danger to the safety of food 
caused by disease-causing microorganisms such 
as bacteria, molds, yeasts, viruses or fungi 
 physical hazard a danger to the safety of food 
caused by particles such as glass chips, metal 
shavings, bits of wood or other foreign matter 
 chemical hazard a danger to the safety of food 
caused by chemical substances, especially 
cleaning agents, pesticides or toxic metals

 Bacteria 
 Bacteria, which are single-celled microorganisms, are the leading cause of food-borne 
illnesses. Figure  2. 1 shows the shapes of different bacteria. Some bacteria are beneficial, 
such as those that aid in digesting food or decomposing garbage. Certain beneficial bac￾teria are used to make cheese, yogurt and sauerkraut. Other bacteria spoil food without 
rendering it unfit for human consumption. These bacteria, called putrefactives , are 
not a sanitation concern. (Indeed, in some cultures, they are not even a culinary con￾cern. Cultures differ on what constitutes “bad” meat, for example. In some cultures for 
instance, game is sometimes hung for a time to allow bacteria to grow.) The bacteria 
that are dangerous when consumed by humans are pathogens . These bacteria must be 
destroyed or controlled in a food service operation. 
 Most bacteria reproduce by binary fission: Their genetic material is first duplicated, 
and the nucleus then splits, each new nucleus taking some of the cellular material with 
it, as shown in Figure  2. 2 . Under favorable conditions each bacterium can divide every 
15–30 minutes. Within 12 hours one bacterium can become a colony of 72 billion bacte￾ria, more than enough to cause serious illness. In instances when the bacterial count is 
high enough, a person may get sick within as little as 4 hours. 
 Most pathogenic bacteria will be destroyed by heat or other unfavorable condi￾tions. Some rod-shaped bacteria are capable of forming spores, however. Spores are 
 thick-walled structures used as protection against a hostile environment. The bacteria 
essentially hibernate within their spores, where the bacteria can survive extreme con￾ditions so that heating or sanitizing the cooking environment may not destroy them. 
When conditions become favorable, the bacteria return to a viable state. Common soil 
frequently contains bacterial spores. This is one reason why it is essential to wash fruit 
and produce thoroughly before use. 
 Bacterial Intoxications and Infections 
 Pathogenic bacteria can cause illnesses in humans in one of three ways: by intoxication, 
infection or toxin-mediated infection. (Consult Appendix III , “Top Causes of Food-Borne 
Illness,” for a list of the more common food-borne illnesses and their characteristics.)
 Botulism is a well-known example of an intoxication . Certain bacteria produce 
toxins as by-products of their life processes. People cannot smell, see or taste toxins. 
Ingesting these toxin-producing bacteria by themselves does not cause illness. But the 
toxins the bacteria produce can poison the consumer. Proper food-handling techniques 
 pathogens any organism that causes disease; 
usually refers to bacteria; undetectable by smell, 
sight or taste, pathogens are responsible for as 
many as 95 percent of all food-borne illnesses 
Figure 2. 1 Bacteria can be 
classified by shape: Rods are short, 
tubular structures; cocci are discs, 
some of which form clusters; and 
spirilla are corkscrews.

are critical to preventing an intoxication because, even if a food is cooked to a suf￾ficiently high temperature to kill all bacteria present, the toxins they leave behind are 
usually not destroyed.
The second type of bacterial illness is an infection. Salmonella is a well-known 
example. An infection occurs when live pathogenic bacteria (infectants) are ingested. 
The bacteria then live in the consumer’s intestinal tract. It is the living bacteria, not their 
waste products, that cause an illness. Infectants must be alive when eaten for them to do 
any harm. Fortunately these bacteria can be destroyed by cooking foods at sufficiently 
high temperatures, such as 165°F (74°C) or higher.
The third type of bacterial illness, which has characteristics of both an intoxication 
and an infection, is a toxin-mediated infection. Examples are Clostridium perfringens
and Escherichia coli O157:H7 (STEC). When these living organisms are ingested, they 
establish colonies in human or animal intestinal tracts, where they then produce toxins. 
These bacteria are particularly dangerous for young children, older adults and people 
with weakened immune systems.
Preventing Bacterial Intoxications and Infections
All bacteria need certain conditions in order to complete their life cycle. Like humans 
and other living things, they need food, a comfortable temperature, moisture, the proper 
pH, the proper atmosphere and time. The best way to prevent bacterial intoxications and 
infections is to attack the conditions that bacteria need to survive and multiply.
The following six conditions, which we will discuss in some detail in this section, 
affect the growth of bacteria:
	▪ Food
	▪ Acidity
	▪ Time
	▪ Temperature
	▪ Oxygen
	▪ Moisture
Food
Bacteria need food for energy and growth and thrive on foods that are referred to as 
time and temperature controlled for safety (TCS) foods. These foods are generally 
high in protein and include animal-based products, cooked grains and some raw and 
cooked vegetables. These foods, and items containing these foods, must be handled 
with great care.
Acidity
Bacteria thrive in an environment where the acidity and alkalinity are in balance. pH is a 
measurement of the acid or alkali content of a solution, expressed on a scale of 0–14.0. 
A pH of 7.0 is considered neutral or balanced. The lower the pH value, the more acidic 
the substance. The higher the pH value, the more alkaline the substance.
Although they can survive in a wider range, bacteria prefer a neutral environment 
with a pH of 6.6–7.5. Growth is usually halted if the pH is 4.6 or less. Acidic foods such 
as lemon juice, tomatoes and vinegar, which have lower pH values, create an unfavor￾able environment for bacteria. Simply adding an acidic ingredient to foods should not, 
however, be relied upon to destroy bacteria or preserve foods. The amount of acidity 
appropriate for flavoring is not sufficient to ensure the destruction of bacteria.
Time
Bacterial growth takes place in four phases. (See Figure 2.3.) When bacteria are moved 
from one place to another, they require time to adjust to new conditions. This resting 
period, during which very little growth occurs, is known as the lag phase and may last 
from 1 to 4 hours. The lag phase is followed by the log phase, a period of accelerated 
growth, and then by the stationary phase, which lasts until the bacteria begin to crowd 
pH a measurement of the acid or alkali content 
of a solution, expressed on a scale of 0–14.0. 
A pH of 7.0 is considered neutral or balanced. 
The lower the pH value, the more acidic the 
substance. The higher the pH value, the more 
alkaline the substance.

The words FAT TOM can be used to help 
you remember the six conditions that 
affect bacterial growth, as follows:

within their colony, creating competition for food, space and moisture. This crowding 
signals the beginning of the decline or negative-growth phase, during which bacteria 
die at an accelerated rate.
Because of the lag phase, foods can be in the temperature danger zone for very 
short periods during preparation before bacterial growth increases to an unacceptable 
level. Exposure to the temperature danger zone is cumulative, however, and should 
not exceed 4 hours total. The less time food is in the temperature danger zone, the less 
opportunity bacteria have to multiply.
Temperature
Temperature is the most important factor in the pathogenic bacteria’s environment 
because it is the factor that food service workers can most easily control. High tempera￾tures destroy most microorganisms. Refrigeration slows but does not stop growth, and 
neither refrigeration nor freezing destroys bacteria.
Most bacteria that cause food-borne illnesses multiply rapidly at temperatures between 
70°F and 125°F (21°C and 52°C). Therefore the broad range of temperatures between 
41°F and 135°F (5°C and 57°C) is referred to as the temperature danger zone. (See 
Figure 2.4.) To control the growth of any bacteria that may be present, it is important 
to maintain the internal temperature of food at 135°F (57°C) or above or 41°F (5°C) or 
below. Keeping foods out of the temperature danger zone reduces the bacteria’s ability 
to thrive and reproduce.
Simply stated: Keep hot foods hot and cold foods cold. Time and temperature 
controlled for safety (TCS) foods should be heated or cooled quickly so that they 
are within the temperature danger zone as briefly as possible. This is known as the 
time-and-temperature principle.
Keep hot foods hot. The high internal temperatures reached during proper cooking kill 
most of the bacteria that can cause food-borne illnesses. Foods must be cooked to spe￾cific internal temperatures and held there for the time specified in Table 2.1. When foods 
are reheated, the internal temperature should quickly reach or exceed 165°F (74°C) to 
kill any bacteria that may have grown during storage. Once properly heated, hot foods 
must be held at temperatures of 135°F (57°C) or higher. (Holding food at 140°F/60°C 
offers an additional safeguard.) Foods that are to be displayed or served hot must be 
heated rapidly to reduce the time within the temperature danger zone. To facilitate this, 
when heating or reheating foods:
	▪ Heat small quantities at a time.
	▪ Stir frequently.
	▪ Heat foods as close to service time as possible.
	▪ Use preheated ingredients whenever possible to prepare hot foods.
	▪ Never use a steam table for heating or reheating foods. Bring reheated food to 
an appropriate internal temperature (at least 165°F/74°C) before placing it in the 
steam table for holding.
Keep cold foods cold. Improperly cooled foods are a leading cause of the spread of 
foodborne illness. Foods that are to be displayed, stored or served cold must be cooled 
rapidly. Once properly chilled, cold foods must be held at temperatures of 41°F (5°C) or 
lower. When cooling foods:
	▪ Spread food into clean, shallow, metal containers, which change temperature 
quickly. Place container over ice and stir periodically during cooling to lower 
the temperature to 70°F (21°C) within 2 hours. Then cool to 41°F (5°C) or below 
within 4 additional hours.
	▪ Use frozen ice paddles designed to chill food to help quickly cool soup, stock 
and liquid foods.
	▪ Refrigerate semisolid foods at 41°F (5°C) or below in clean metal containers that 
are less than 2 inches deep. (Increased surface area decreases cooling time.)
	▪ Avoid crowding the refrigerator; allow air to circulate around foods.
Safety Alert
The Temperature Danger Zone
The temperature danger zone is a 
broad range of temperatures in which 
most of the bacteria that cause food￾borne illnesses multiply rapidly. The 
2022 Food Code of the U.S. Food and 
drug Administration (FdA), indicates 
that the temperature danger zone 
begins at 41°F (5°C) and ends at 
135°F (57°C). Regulations in some 
localities and with some organizations 
may vary. This text uses the range 
recommended by the FdA.

	▪ Vent hot foods in an ice-water bath, as illustrated in Chapter 11, Stocks and 
Sauces, page 229.
	▪ Prechill ingredients such as mayonnaise before preparing cold foods.
	▪ Refrigerate cooked foods above raw foods to prevent cross-contamination.
Keep frozen foods frozen. Freezing at 0°F (–18°C) or below essentially stops bacterial 
growth but will not kill the bacteria. Do not place hot foods in a standard freezer. This 
will not cool the food any faster, and the release of heat can raise the temperature of 
other foods in the freezer. Only a special blast freezer can be used for chilling hot items. 
If one is not available, cool hot foods as mentioned earlier before freezing them. When 
frozen foods thaw, bacteria that are present begin to grow. Therefore:
	▪ Never thaw foods at room temperature.
	▪ Thaw foods gradually under refrigeration to maintain the food’s temperature 
at 41°F (5°C) or less. Place thawing foods in a container to prevent cross￾contamination from dripping or leaking liquids.
	▪ Thaw foods completely submerged under running water at a temperature of 70°F 
(21°C) or cooler. Place thawing foods in a clean container and then in a clean, 
sanitized prep sink. Never allow the temperature of the food to exceed 41°F (5°C) 
for more than four hours.
	▪ Thaw foods in a microwave only if the food is being prepared and served immediately.
Oxygen
Bacteria and pathogens can grow with or without oxygen. Aerobic bacteria thrive on 
oxygen, whereas anaerobic bacteria cannot survive in its presence. Still other bacteria, 
known as facultative bacteria, can adapt and will survive with or without oxygen. 
Unfortunately most pathogenic bacteria are facultative.
Canning, which creates an anaerobic atmosphere, destroys bacteria that need oxygen, 
but it creates a favorable atmosphere for anaerobic and facultative bacteria. A complete

vacuum need not be formed for anaerobic bacteria to thrive. A tight foil covering, a com￾plete layer of fat or even a well-fitting lid can create an atmosphere sufficiently devoid of 
oxygen to permit the growth of anaerobic bacteria.
Moisture
Bacteria need a certain amount of moisture to grow. The moisture in food that is not 
bound to food molecules and is available for bacteria to grow is expressed as water 
activity or Aw. Water itself has an Aw of 1.0. Any food with an Aw of 0.85 or greater is 
considered TCS food. Bacteria cannot flourish where the Aw is too low, usually below 
0.85. This explains why dry foods such as flour, sugar and crackers are rarely subject to 
bacterial infestations. A low Aw only halts bacterial growth, however; it does not kill the 
microorganisms. When dried foods, such as beans or rice, are rehydrated, any bacteria 
present can flourish and the food becomes a TCS food, requiring time and temperature 
control for safety.
Parasites
Like bacteria, parasites can also contaminate foods. Parasites are tiny organisms that 
depend on nutrients from a living host to complete their life cycle. Animals, poul￾try, fish, shellfish and humans can all play host to parasites. Several types of very 
small parasitic organisms can enter an animal through contaminated feed, then settle 
in the host’s intestinal tract or muscles, where they grow and reproduce. Parasites 
can also be found in water that is used to irrigate produce. Although heating to 
149−179°F (60−75°C) generally destroys water-borne parasites, fruits and many 
vegetables are eaten raw or only lightly cooked. The most common food-borne 
parasites are explained below.
Anisakiasis is an illness caused by parasitic roundworms. Anisakis worms reside 
in the organs of fish, especially bottom feeders or those taken from contaminated 
waters. Raw or undercooked fish are most often implicated in anisakiasis. Fish 
should be thoroughly cleaned immediately after being caught so that the parasites 
do not have an opportunity to spread. If serving raw or undercooked fish, purchase 
sushi-grade products that were flash frozen to the correct time–temperature require￾ments. Thorough cooking to a minimum internal temperature of 135°F (57°C) is the 
only way to destroy the Anisakis larvae, as they can survive even in highly acidic 
marinades.
Cyclospora and Giardia infections are caused by a single-celled parasite found in 
water or food contaminated by infected feces. Produce from undeveloped countries is a 
common source of these parasites, as is untreated water. Food handlers are frequently 
the cause of cross-contamination, so anyone with diarrhea must be kept out of the work￾place. Proper hand washing and purchasing foods, especially produce, from approved 
vendors are the best prevention methods.
Cryptosporidiosis occurs most frequently in day-care and medical facilities and 
among immune-compromised individuals. The parasite is found in the intestines of herd 
animals such as cattle, sheep and goats and in contaminated water. As with other para￾sitic illnesses, the best prevention is proper handwashing, using only correctly treated 
water and keeping anyone with diarrhea away from the facility.
Viruses
Viruses cause other biologically based food-borne illnesses such as hepatitis A and noro￾virus and are the leading cause of food-borne illnesses. Viruses are among the smallest 
known forms of life. They invade the living cells of a host, take over those cells’ genetic 
material and cause the cells to produce more viruses. Unlike parasites, viruses do not 
require a host to survive, however. They can survive—but not multiply—while lying on 
any food or food contact surface. Unlike bacteria, viruses can be present on any food, 
not just a TCS food. The food or food contact surface simply becomes a means of trans￾portation between hosts.
Safety Alert
Time and Temperature Control for 
Safety (TCS) Food
Foods that may require time and 
temperature controls for safety are 
referred to as TCS foods. A TCS food 
is any food or food ingredient that will 
support the rapid growth of infectious or 
toxigenic microorganisms, or the slower 
growth of Clostridium botulinum. (TCS 
replaces the term potentially hazardous 
food.) TCS foods include the following:
	▪ Food from an animal source (e.g., meat, 
fish, shellfish, poultry, milk and eggs)
	▪ Food from a plant that has been heat 
treated (e.g., cooked rice, beans, 
potatoes, soy products, vegetables 
and pasta)
	▪ Raw seed sprouts
	▪ Cut melons
	▪ Cut leafy greens
	▪ Cut tomatoes or mixtures of cut 
tomatoes that are not acidified or 
otherwise appropriately modified at a 
processing plant
	▪ Garlic-in-oil mixtures that are not 
acidified or otherwise appropriately 
modified at a processing plant
	▪ Foods containing any of the 
preceding items (e.g., custards, 
sauces and casseroles)
The microscopic Giardia duodenalis parasite 
spreads easily from infected animals and 
humans, causing severe intestinal problems.
M02_LABE1163_07_SE_C02.indd 23 28/10/23 10:58 AM24 CHAPTER TWO
Also unlike bacteria, viruses are not affected by the water activity, pH or oxygen 
content of their environment. Freezing temperatures do not destroy viruses. Some 
viruses, however, can be destroyed by temperatures higher than 176°F (80°C). Even 
so, the only sure way to prevent food-borne viral illnesses is to prevent contamination 
in the first place. Viruses often find their way into foods because of human contact, so 
the foods most likely to transmit viral diseases are those that are not heated after han￾dling. These include salads, sandwiches, baked products, uncooked fish and shellfish 
and sliced meats. The best techniques for avoiding viral food-borne illnesses are to 
observe good personal hygiene habits, avoid cross-contamination and use foods only 
from reputable sources.
Hepatitis A enters the food supply through shellfish harvested from polluted 
waters. The virus is carried by humans, some of whom may never know they are 
infected, and is transmitted by poor personal hygiene and cross-contamination. The 
source of contamination may be hard to establish because it sometimes takes months 
for symptoms to appear.
Norovirus (formerly called the Norwalk virus) causes more than half of all food-borne 
illnesses in the United States. The virus is found in shellfish, human feces and contami￾nated water or vegetables fertilized by manure. Norovirus passes easily among infected 
people, contaminated food and contaminated work surfaces. It is spread almost entirely 
by poor personal hygiene among infected food handlers. The virus can be destroyed by 
high cooking temperatures, but not by sanitizing solutions, which reduce pathogens to 
safe levels, or freezing.
Because norovirus is highly contagious, it is important to recognize the symptoms. 
Diarrhea, vomiting, nausea and stomach pain are common, but fever, headache and 
body aches may also be present. The virus is passed through contact with very small 
amounts of stool or vomit. Contact may come directly from an infected person or 
through food contact surfaces that may be contaminated. If you are infected with 
norovirus, avoid contact with other people. Wait 3 days after you have stopped having 
symptoms before preparing food. Use proper handwashing techniques and wash fre￾quently. When the presence of norovirus is suspected, clean and sanitize all food con￾tact surfaces, floors, walls and equipment with a sanitizing solution that is registered 
as effective against norovirus. Wash napkins, table linens, side towels and uniforms 
thoroughly in hot water.
Fruits and vegetables may be contaminated with norovirus in the field. Shellfish can 
become contaminated from tainted water. Wash fruits and vegetables properly and cook 
shellfish thoroughly to prevent the spread of this illness.
Fungi
Fungi are spore-producing, filament-like organisms lacking chlorophyll and ranging 
from single-celled organisms to giant toadstools. The Fungi kingdom includes rust, yeast, 
smut, mold and mushrooms, which are everywhere in soil, air and water. Some fungi 
pose no problem if eaten and are widely consumed, such as the mold on certain cheese, 
mushrooms and the yeast used in bread baking. The toxins in toadstools (poisonous 
mushrooms) can cause illness or death if consumed, however, and some types of fungi 
are linked to food-borne illnesses.
Molds
Molds are algae-like fungi that form long filaments or strands. These filaments often 
extend into the air, appearing as cottony or velvety masses on food. Large colonies of 
mold are easily visible to the naked eye. Although many food molds are not dangerous, 
and some are even very beneficial, rare types known as mycotoxicoses form toxins that 
have been linked to food-borne illnesses. For the most part, however, molds affect only 
the appearance and flavor of foods. They cause discoloration, odors and off-flavors.
Unlike bacteria, molds can grow on almost any food at almost any temperature, 
moist or dry, acidic or alkaline. Although mold cells can be destroyed by heating to

Six Highly Contagious 
Food-Borne Illnesses That 
Cause Severe Symptoms
According to the FdA, the following six 
pathogens are both highly contagious 
and likely to cause severe illnesses with 
minute exposure. A food service worker 
diagnosed with any of these illnesses must 
not work while sick:
	▪ Shigella spp.
	▪ Salmonella Typhi.
	▪ nontyphoidal Salmonella (nTS)
	▪ Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli
(STEC)
	▪ Hepatitis A
	▪ norovirus

Filaments of mold can coat the surface of 
foods, making them unsuitable for eating.

135°F (57°C) for 10 minutes, their toxins are heat resistant and are not destroyed by nor￾mal cooking methods. Therefore foods that develop mold should be discarded, and any 
container or storage area cleaned and sanitized.

Yeasts require water and carbohydrates (sugar or starch) for survival. As the organisms 
consume carbohydrates, they expel alcohol and carbon dioxide gas through a process 
known as fermentation. Fermentation is very beneficial in making breads, alcoholic 
beverages and many other foods.
Although naturally occurring yeasts have not been proven to be harmful to humans, 
they can cause foods to spoil and develop off-flavors, odors and discoloration. Yeasts are 
killed at temperatures of 136°F (58°C) or above.
DIRECT CHEMICAL CONTAMINANTS
Contamination of foods by chemicals is a very real and serious danger in which the 
public has shown a strong interest. Chemical contamination is usually inadvertent 
and invisible, making it extremely difficult to detect. Chemical hazards include con￾tamination with (1) residual chemicals used in growing the food supply, (2) food 
service chemicals and (3) toxic metals. The only way to avoid such hazards is for 
everyone working to produce, grow, package and prepare food to follow proper 
procedures when handling chemicals.
Residual Chemicals
Chemicals such as antibiotics, fertilizers, insecticides and herbicides have brought 
about great progress in controlling plant, animal and human diseases, permitting 
greater crop yields and stimulating animal growth. The benefits derived from these 
chemicals, however, must be contrasted with the adverse effects when they are used 
indiscriminately or improperly.
The danger of these chemicals lies in the possible contamination of human foods, 
which occurs when chemical residues remain after the intended goal is achieved. 
Thoroughly washing and/or peeling fruits and vegetables can reduce the risk of consum￾ing residual chemicals from these items. However, chemicals that have been absorbed 
into the cells of animals or plants from their environment cannot be simply removed or 
destroyed. This is why some consumers seek out organically grown foods and foods 
produced without hormones, antibiotics or similar substances. Ensuring that foods enter￾ing your kitchen come from reputable producers and comply with government safety 
standards can help protect your customers.
 Food Service Chemicals
Another form of chemical contamination involves the common chemicals found in almost 
every food service operation. Cleaners, polishes, pesticides and abrasives are often poi￾sonous to humans. Illness and even death can result from ingesting foods contaminated 
by such common items as bug spray, drain cleaner, oven cleaner or silver polish. Food 
service chemicals must not be used or stored near food supplies. Even improperly wash￾ing or rinsing dishes and utensils can leave a soap residue that can be consumed by 
anyone eating from the item.
To avoid food service chemical contamination, make sure all cleaning chemicals are 
clearly labeled and stored well away from food preparation and storage areas. Never 
store cleaning solutions or chemicals in a container previously used for food, and never 
store food in a container previously used for such chemicals. Always use these products 
as directed by the manufacturer and properly wash, rinse and store all dishes used to 
prepare or serve food.
Food Safety of Fruits 
and Vegetables
nearly half of all food-borne illnesses are 
linked to fresh produce. The CdC estimates 
leafy greens are responsible for one in five 
cases of food-borne illness. Fruits and 
vegetables may be contaminated in the 
field from animal waste and harvesters, 
or during transportation, processing and 
packaging. Many large-scale produce 
farmers have adopted Good Agricultural 
Practices (GAPs) and Good Handling 
Practices (GHPs), general guidelines 
farms and food producers must follow 
to ensure food safety. Processors are also 
developing new produce washes to reduce 
surface contamination. There is no way to 
guarantee that produce will be pathogen￾free, and the fact that these foods are most 
often eaten uncooked increases the risk of 
them passing along a pathogenic organism.
That said, there are some things you 
can do to reduce the likelihood of serving 
contaminated produce. Wash all whole 
produce well before cutting it. Clean and 
sanitize your equipment frequently, taking 
care not to contaminate your cutting 
board with field soil that may cling to 
the box or plant. Refrigerate any produce 
immediately after washing and cutting it.
Cut vegetables deteriorate much 
faster than intact produce. Cutting 
breaks the plant’s cell walls, allowing 
microorganisms to invade the material. 
This accelerates spoilage and the 
growth of pathogenic organisms. Use 
cut produce as soon as possible. if you 
purchase prewashed bagged salad, mixed 
salad greens or fresh-cut produce, inspect 
the packages upon delivery. Reject any 
that are above 41°F (5°C) or those that 
show signs of decomposition. Always use 
bagged salad, mixed salad greens and 
fresh-cut produce by the “use by” date. 
discard any decomposed prewashed 
greens; rewashing increases the risk of 
spreading contamination.
M02_LABE1163_07_SE_C02.indd 25 28/10/23 10:58 AM26 CHAPTER TWO
Toxic Metals
Another type of chemical contamination occurs when metals such as lead, mercury, cop￾per, zinc and antimony are dispersed in food or water. For example:
	▪ Metals can accumulate in fish and shellfish living in polluted waters or in plants 
grown in soil contaminated by the metals.
	▪ Acidic foods, such as tomatoes or wine, can cause metal ions from zinc 
(galvanized) or unlined copper containers to be released into the food.
	▪ Antimony, which is used in bonding enamelware, can be released into food when 
the enamel is chipped or cracked. For this reason, the use of enamelware is 
prohibited in food service facilities.
	▪ Lead enters the water supply from lead pipes and solder, and it is found in the 
glaze on some imported ceramic items.
Consuming any of these metals can cause poisoning.
To prevent metal contamination, use only approved food service equipment and 
utensils and re-tin copper cookware as needed. Never serve fish or shellfish that was 
illegally harvested or obtained from uninspected sources.
PHYSICAL CONTAMINANTS
Physical contaminants are foreign objects that find their way into foods by mistake. 
Examples of these physical hazards include metal shavings created by a worn can 
opener, pieces of glass or plastic from a broken container, hair or dirt. Physical con￾taminants may be created by intentional tampering, but they are more often the result 
of poor safety and sanitation practices or a lack of training. To prevent direct physi￾cal contamination, observe good personal hygiene as described on pages 27–28. Upon 
delivery inspect all foods for foreign objects, such as insects, pebbles, stickers, rubber 
bands or twist ties. Keep small objects such as pens, pencils and paper clips out of 
kitchen work areas. Discard any food product that may have come into contact with 
broken china, glass or plastic.
PROCEDURES TO PREVENT CROSS-CONTAMINATION
Most microorganisms and other contaminants cannot move by themselves. Rather they 
are carried to foods and food contact surfaces by humans, rodents or insects. This trans￾fer is referred to as cross-contamination. Cross-contamination is the process by which 
one item, such as your finger, a towel or a cutting board, becomes contaminated and 
then contaminates another food or tool. For example, suppose a chef’s knife and cutting 
board are used in butchering a TCS food such as a chicken and the chicken was directly 
contaminated with salmonella at the hatchery. If the knife and board are not cleaned, 
washed, rinsed and sanitized properly, anything that touches them can also become 
contaminated. Even though cooking the chicken to an appropriate internal temperature 
may destroy the salmonella in the chicken, the uncooked salad greens cut on the same 
cutting board or with the same knife can contain live bacteria. You must properly clean, 
wash, rinse and sanitize all tools when preparing different types of foods and when 
switching from preparing raw to cooked foods. Preparing raw foods at a different time 
from cooked foods also helps prevent cross-contamination.
Many kitchens now use a system of color-coded cutting boards to help reduce the 
risk of cross-contamination. Different colored boards are only used for specific foods, 
such as green for fruits and vegetables, red for raw meats and white for bakery and dairy 
items. When properly followed this system ensures that raw chicken and salad greens, 
for example, never come in contact with the same cutting board, thus reducing the risk 
of cross-contamination.
Steps to Prevent 
Cross-Contamination
▪ Wash hands frequently:
Before and after touching raw food
After touching anything that may 
contaminate the hands (after 
removing the garbage, using the 
restroom, coughing, eating, smoking 
or touching electronic devices, dirty 
clothes or kitchen towels)
Before putting on single-use gloves and 
when changing to a new pair of gloves
▪ Properly wash, rinse, sanitize and 
air dry all knives, cutting boards and 
equipment after each task.
▪ Use color-coded cutting boards for 
poultry, meats and produce.
▪ discard soiled side towels. (don’t use 
kitchen side towels to wipe the floor, 
then your hands.)
▪ Use single-use gloves and change 
them frequently.
▪ Use clean tongs and bakery tissue 
paper when handling ready-to-eat 
foods for immediate service.
▪ Use the two-spoon method (see sidebar 
on page 27) when tasting foods.
Using a system of different colored cutting 
boards for meat, poultry, seafood, dairy and 
produce helps prevent cross-contamination.
M02_LABE1163_07_SE_C02.indd 26 28/10/23 10:58 AMFOOd SAFET y And SAniTATiOn 27
Side towels or kitchen towels are a common source of cross-contamination. If you 
use a side towel to wipe a spill off the floor and then use that same towel to dry your 
hands after visiting the restroom, you have recontaminated your hands with whatever 
bacteria or dirt was on the floor. Cross-contamination also occurs when raw foods 
come in contact with cooked foods. Never store cooked food below raw food in a 
refrigerator, and never return cooked food to the container that held the raw food. 
Cross-contamination also occurs easily from smoking, drinking or eating, because your 
hands come in contact with bacteria in your mouth. Therefore, proper handwashing is 
essential after any of these activities.
In addition to proper hand washing, food service workers should strive to mini￾mize direct contact with prepared food by using single-use gloves, clean tongs, tasting 
spoons, bakery tissue paper and other appropriate tools. Disposable gloves can prevent 
 cross-contamination only when used properly. Check your local regulations; some health 
departments require the use of disposable gloves when handling any ready-to-eat foods.
Cross-contamination can be reduced or even prevented by (1) personal cleanliness, 
(2) dish and equipment cleanliness, (3) proper food storage, (4) food labeling and (5) 
pest management.
Personal Cleanliness
To produce clean, sanitary food, all food handlers must maintain high standards of per￾sonal cleanliness and hygiene. This begins with good grooming. Humans provide the 
ideal environment for the growth of microorganisms. Everyone harbors bacteria in the 
nose and mouth. These bacteria are easily spread by sneezing or coughing, by not dis￾posing of tissues properly and by not washing hands frequently and properly. Touching 
your body and then touching food or utensils transfers bacteria.
Hands should be washed before and after handling raw food; after smoking, drink￾ing or eating; after coughing or sneezing; after removing the garbage; and after touching 
dirty clothes, side towels, electronic devices or anything that may contaminate the hands. 
Human waste carries many dangerous microorganisms, so it is especially important to 
wash your hands thoroughly after visiting the restroom. An employee who is ill should 
not be allowed in the kitchen. If during work you develop symptoms such as fever, diar￾rhea, vomiting, sore throat, cough or jaundice, you must report to a manager and request 
to be dismissed until you recover.
Research has established that the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the 
causative agent of AIDS, is not spread by food. According to the CDC, food ser￾vice workers infected with HIV should not be restricted from work unless there 
is another infection or illness. While there is no evidence to suggest that the 
SARS-associated coronavirus, which causes Covid-19, can be spread through food, 
infected food service workers should be restricted from work to avoid infecting a 
co-worker or guest.
You can do several things to decrease the risk of an illness being spread by poor 
personal hygiene:
	▪ Wash your hands frequently and thoroughly. Gloves are not a substitute for 
proper hand washing.
	▪ Keep your fingernails short, clean and neat. Do not bite your nails or wear nail 
polish or artificial nails.
	▪ Keep any cut or wound antiseptically bandaged. An injured hand should also be 
covered with a disposable glove.
	▪ Bathe daily, or more often if required.
	▪ Keep your hair clean and restrained. Wear approved head and beard coverings 
if required.
	▪ Wear work clothes that are clean and neat. Avoid wearing jewelry or watches.
	▪ Remove aprons before leaving the kitchen.
	▪ Do not eat, drink, smoke or chew gum in food preparation areas.
Safety Alert
Tasting Food
To avoid cross-contamination, use a two￾spoon tasting method when sampling in 
the professional kitchen. First, use a clean 
spoon to remove some food from the 
pan in which it was made or stored. Then 
pour that food into a second clean spoon 
before tasting from the second spoon. 
This prevents the soiled spoon from going 
back into the food being prepared. Keep 
a supply of clean spoons for this purpose 
near all cooking and preparation stations.
Safety Alert
Single-Use Gloves
Wearing the correct size single-use gloves 
can prevent cross-contamination only 
when used properly:
	▪ Wash hands before putting on 
single-use gloves.
	▪ Wear single-use gloves for only one task.
	▪ Change gloves after handling raw fish, 
meat or poultry.
	▪ Change gloves when switching tasks, 
when the gloves tear or after 4 hours of 
continual use.
	▪ To remove a glove, grab the cuff, peel 
the glove off inside out over the fingers 
and then throw it away.
	▪ Single-use gloves must be worn at all 
times when handling ready to-eat 
foods, such as sandwiches, or when 
garnishing or portioning foods for 
service, such as cookies or cakes.
	▪ Gloves, along with proper bandaging, 
must always be worn if there is a cut or 
infection on the hand.
M02_LABE1163_07_SE_C02.indd 27 28/10/23 10:58 AM28 CHAPTER TWO
Dish and Equipment Cleanliness
A requirement for any food service facility is cleanability. Note that there is an impor￾tant difference between clean and sanitary. Clean means that the item has no visible 
soil on it. Sanitary means that harmful substances are reduced to safe levels. Thus 
something may be clean without being sanitary. The visible dirt can be removed, but 
 disease-causing microorganisms can remain.
The cleaning of dishes, pots, pans and utensils in a food service operation involves 
both removing soil and sanitizing. Soil can be removed manually or by machine. Sanitizing 
can be accomplished with heat or chemical disinfectants. Heating to the proper tempera￾tures sterilizes food contact surfaces by killing microorganisms. To sterilize using heat, 
wash water in the sink must be kept at 171°F (77°C) or higher. Dishwasher water must 
reach at 180°F (82°C) or higher.
There are three types of chemicals commonly used to sanitize and disinfect: chlorine, 
iodine and quaternary ammonium compounds (quats). Each option has its pros 
clean to remove visible dirt and soil
sanitize to reduce pathogenic organisms on 
clean surfaces to safe levels
sterilize to destroy all living microorganisms
➋ Apply an antibacterial soap. ➌ Rub hands and arms briskly with soapy 
lather for at least 20 seconds.
➍ Scrub between fingers and clean nails with 
a clean nail brush.
Procedure for Proper Hand Washing
❺ Rinse thoroughly under hot running water. 
Reapply soap and scrub hands and forearms 
for another 5–10 seconds. Rinse again.
❻ dry hands and arms with a single-use 
towel or appropriate automatic hand dryer; 
use a clean towel to turn off the water. discard 
the towel in a trash receptacle.
➊ Use hot water (100°F/38°C) to wet hands 
and forearms.
M02_LABE1163_07_SE_C02.indd 28 28/10/23 10:58 AMFOOd SAFET y And SAniTATiOn 29
and cons. Food-grade chlorine bleach diluted in water is one commonly used sanitizing 
agent. It is inexpensive and kills a wide range of microorganisms. However bleach has 
a strong smell and is corrosive, unlike quats, which can be used on surfaces that may 
rust. Quats are colorless, odorless and non-irritating but are more expensive and are 
less effective in the presence of dirt than bleach. Iodine sanitizers are useful but may 
leave a brown stain on contact surfaces. Whichever sanitizing product you use, follow 
the manufacturer’s instructions for each product. Temperature, strength and contact 
time vary with each product. 
 When sanitizing tools, equipment and work surfaces, be sure to clean and remove 
all food and debris. Wash with detergent then rinse before applying sanitizing solu￾tion. Leave the solution undisturbed for the amount of time the manufacturer’s 
directions recommend. 
 Procedures for manually washing, rinsing and sanitizing dishes and equipment gener￾ally follow the three-compartment sink setup shown in Figure  2. 5 . Food service items, 
dishes, silverware and utensils should always be allowed to air-dry, as towel drying may 
recontaminate them. Any cracked or chipped china should be discarded, as it can harbor 
bacteria that pose a food safety hazard. 
1 Scrape and spray the item to remove soil. 
2 Wash the item in the first sink compartment using 110°F (43°C) water and an approved 
detergent. Use a brush or cloth to remove any remaining soil. 
3 Rinse or spray the item in the second sink compartment using clear, 110°F (43°C) water. 
4 Sanitize the item in the third sink compartment by either: 
a. immersing it in 171°F (77°C) water for at least 30 seconds, or 
b. immersing it in an approved chemical sanitizing solution according to the 
manufacturer’s directions. 
5 Empty, clean and refill each sink compartment as necessary, and check the water 
temperature regularly. 
6 Allow the items to air dry. 
 Procedure for Manually Washing, Rinsing and Sanitizing 
Dishes and Equipment 
Figure 2. 5 The three-compartment sink procedure: scrape, spray, wash, rinse, sanitize and air-dry each item. 
M02_LABE1163_07_SE_C02.indd 29 28/10/23 10:58 AM30 CHAPTER TWO
Machine-washing dishes or utensils follows a similar procedure. The person wash￾ing the dishes should first scrape and rinse items as needed, then load the items into 
dishwasher racks so that the spray of water will reach all surfaces. The machine cleans 
the items with a detergent, then sanitizes them with either a hot-water rinse (at least 
180°F/82°C) or a chemical disinfectant. When the machine cycle is complete, items 
should be inspected for residual soil, allowed to air-dry and stored in a clean area.
Worktables and stationary equipment must also be cleaned and sanitized properly. 
Equipment and surfaces, including floors, walls and worktables, should be easily exposed 
for inspection and cleaning and should be constructed so that soil can be removed effec￾tively and efficiently with normal cleaning procedures. A thorough cleaning schedule 
should be implemented and closely monitored. The following points are important for 
the safety and cleanliness of any food service facility:
	▪ Equipment should be disassembled for cleaning; any immersible pieces should be 
cleaned and sanitized like other items.
	▪ All worktables or other food contact surfaces should be cleaned with detergent, 
then sanitized with a clean cloth dipped in a sanitizing solution. (See sidebar.)
	▪ Surfaces, especially work surfaces with which food may come in contact, 
should be smooth and free of cracks, crevices or seams in which soil and 
microorganisms can hide.
	▪ Floors should be nonabsorbent and should not become slippery when wet.
	▪ Walls and ceilings should be smooth and light-colored so that soil is easier to see.
	▪ Light should be ample throughout food preparation and storage areas. All 
lightbulbs should be covered with a sleeve or globe to protect surroundings 
from shattered glass.
A kitchen’s design can also affect food safety and sanitation. Food prepara￾tion equipment should be arranged in such a way as to decrease the chances of 
 cross-contamination. The workflow should eliminate crisscrossing and backtracking. 
Employees should be able to reach storage, refrigeration and cleanup areas easily. 
Dish- and pot-washing areas and garbage facilities should be kept as far from food 
preparation and storage areas as possible. Cleaning supplies and other chemicals 
should be stored away from foods.
Proper Food Storage
Proper food storage prevents cross-contamination and ensures food safety. Freezers, 
refrigerators and dry goods storage facilities should have effective temperature, humid￾ity and light controls in order to properly and safely maintain the stored items. Not only 
must food be purchased from approved suppliers, it must be physically inspected when 
it arrives. Upon delivery, the condition and internal temperature of foods should be veri￾fied. Use a thermometer to check TCS foods. Reject and return any unacceptable foods. 
Save labels and origin tags for foods such as shellfish in case there is a recall or an issue 
arises with the product.
Dry goods, such as flour, sugar, dried legumes, crackers and rice, are foods that will 
not promote the growth of hazards at room temperature. They should be stored least 6 
inches (15 centimeters) off the floor and 6 inches (15 centimeters) away from walls on 
shelving or storage racks that are clean, sanitized and dry.
Store refrigerated foods appropriately to prevent cross-contamination and the growth 
of harmful bacteria. Foods must be kept at temperatures below the temperature danger 
zone (41°F/5°C).Wrap and cover food to prevent leakage. Store food in cleaned 
and sanitized food-grade containers. Raw meat, poultry and fish should be stored sepa￾rately from prepared foods and produce. Refrigerate produce on separate storage racks 
or in a separate refrigerator. Certain fruits and vegetables such as citrus, root vegetables 
and onions may be stored in cool dry areas.
Store refrigerated food in the order shown in Figure 2.6. This order is based on the 
minimum internal cooking temperature of each food. Refrigerated food should be stored 
Sanitizing Solution
Use a clean cloth dipped in sanitizing 
solution when wiping off your knives, 
utensils or cutting board during work. 
An acceptable solution can be made by 
combining 1 gallon (3.8 liters) lukewarm 
water with 1 tablespoon (15 milliliters) 
regular strength food-grade chlorine 
bleach. A designated container for 
sanitizing solution should be filled and 
placed at each work station. Cloths used 
to sanitize equipment should stay in 
the bucket of liquid when not in use. To 
sanitize, allow the solution to sit on the 
surface for 1 minute then wipe with clean 
paper towels. Store sanitizing solution 
below work areas to prevent accidentally 
spilling it onto food or food preparation 
areas. Replace solution when it becomes 
cloudy, dirty or after every 2 hours of use.
Safety Alert
Chemical Storage
	▪ never store cleaning supplies or other 
chemicals with or near foods.
	▪ never store chemicals in a container that 
originally held food; never store food in a 
container that once held a chemical.
	▪ Keep chemicals and cleaners in 
properly labeled containers.
M02_LABE1163_07_SE_C02.indd 30 28/10/23 10:58 AMFOOd SAFET y And SAniTATiOn 31
so that cooked foods are stored above raw foods to prevent cross contamination. Items 
that will be cooked to a lower internal temperature must be placed above foods that will 
be cooked to a higher internal temperature. 
 Food Labeling 
 Accurate food labeling and consistent record keeping are as important as safe 
 food-handling practices to prevent cross-contamination and food spoilage. Use 
food labels to identify and date all foods that are made for kitchen use as well as 
 leftovers. Systems for labeling foods vary but must be followed consistently to be 
effective. Once placed in clean, sanitized storage containers, food prepared for later 
use should be labeled with the product name and the date and time it was made. (See 
 Figure  2. 7 .) Ready-to-eat TCS food that will be held for longer than 24 hours must be 
labeled with the day or date by which the food must be consumed on premises, sold 
or discarded. Once labeled refrigerated or frozen products are easily identifiable by 
the entire kitchen staff. 
 Pest Management 
 Food can be contaminated by insects (e.g., roaches and flies) and rodents (e.g., mice 
and rats). These pests carry many harmful bacteria on their bodies and contaminate 
any surface with which they come in contact. An insect or rodent infestation is usually 
considered a serious health risk and should be dealt with immediately and thoroughly. 
The best defense against pests is to prevent infestations in the first place by building 
them out. Any crack—no matter how small—in door frames, walls or windowsills 
should be repaired immediately, and all drains, pipes and vents should be well sealed. 
Inspect all deliveries thoroughly, and reject any packages or containers found to 
 contain evidence of pests.

 Sustainable Food 
Safety 
 Lessening a restaurant’s environmental 
impact is of growing concern to chefs and 
their customers. Cleaning and sanitizing 
activities consume large quantities of 
water and chemicals. Systems can be 
put in place to reduce this consumption. 
Run dishwashers only when full. When 
feasible, replace older dishwashers with 
energy- and water-efficient models. To 
reduce the use of harsh chemicals, select 
cleaning products made from renewable 
plant-based ingredients such as corn or 
soybeans. Choose trash bags, single-use 
plates and utensils made from recycled 
and biodegradable materials. 
 Even without the latest technology, a 
restaurant can reduce its environmental 
impact by instituting a sustainable 
cleaning program. The Green Restaurant 
Association and the national Restaurant 
Association’s Conserve program provide 
resources to assist food service operations 
with implementing such plans.

Flies are a perfect vehicle for transporting bacteria because they feed and breed on 
human waste and garbage. Use screens or “fly fans” (also known as air curtains) to keep 
them out of food preparation areas. Controlling garbage is also essential because moist, 
warm, decaying organic material attracts flies and provides favorable conditions for eggs 
to hatch and larvae to grow.
Pest management also requires creating an inhospitable environment for pests: one 
in which they cannot find foods, water or shelter. Store all food and supplies at least 
6 inches (15 centimeters) off the floor and 6 inches (15 centimeters) away from walls. 
Remove products from cardboard boxes when delivered, if possible, and remove 
empty boxes from the premises promptly as pests can easily arrive through and hide 
in boxes. Rotate stock often to disrupt nesting places and breeding habits. Provide 
good ventilation in storerooms to remove humidity, airborne contaminants, grease 
and fumes. Do not allow water to stand in drains, sinks or buckets, as cockroaches 
are attracted to moisture. Clean up spills and crumbs immediately and completely to 
reduce pest food supply.
Even while making the best efforts to build pests out and maintain proper house￾keeping standards, it is still important to watch for the presence of pests. For example, 
cockroaches leave a strong, oily odor and feces that look like large grains of pepper. 
Cockroaches prefer to search for food and water in the dark, so seeing any cockroach on 
the move in the daylight is an indication of a large infestation.
Rodents (e.g., mice and rats) also tend to hide during the day, so an infes￾tation may be rather serious before any creature is actually seen. Rodent 
 droppings, which are shiny black to brownish gray, may be evident, however. 
Rodent nests made from scraps of paper, hair or other soft materials may be 
visible evidence of an infestation.
Should an infestation occur, consult a licensed pest control operator 
immediately. With early detection and proper treatment, infestations can 
be eliminated. Employees should be very careful in attempting to use pes￾ticides or insecticides themselves. These chemicals are toxic to humans as 
well as to pests. Great care must be taken to prevent contaminating food or 
exposing workers or customers to the chemicals.
HAZARD ANALYSIS CRITICAL CONTROL 
POINTS (HACCP) SYSTEMS
Now that you understand what contaminants are and how they can be 
destroyed or controlled, it is necessary to put this information into practice 
during day-to-day operations. Although local health departments regularly 
inspect all food service facilities, continual self-inspection and control are 
essential for maintaining sanitary conditions.
Food service operations regularly put into place food safety manage￾ment systems to prevent the spread of food-borne illnesses and to prevent 
cross-contamination from allergens. Hazard Analysis Critical Control 
Points (HACCP), which is one of these systems, is an effective and 
 efficient system for managing and maintaining sanitary conditions in all 
types of food service operations. HACCP [HASS-ip] is a rigorous system 
of self- inspection that must be in place in food manufacturing settings, 
although it is voluntary for most restaurants. It focuses on the flow of food 
through the food service facility, from the decision to include an item on 
the menu through service to the consumer. A critical control point (CCP)
in that flow is any step during the processing of a food when a mistake can 
result in the transmission, growth or survival of pathogenic bacteria. The 
seven principles of a HACCP plan are illustrated in Figure 2.8.
The HACCP process begins by identifying the steps and evaluating 
the type and severity of hazard that can occur when preparing food for 
rotate stock moving older product in front of 
new product, whether fresh, frozen, canned or 
dry, so that items are used in the order in which 
they were received, known as the first in, first 
out (FiFO) principle
critical control point (CCP) a point, step or 
procedure at which control can be applied 
and a food safety hazard can be prevented, 
eliminated or reduced to an acceptable level
Figure 2.8 A HACCP system flowchart.
Identify potential hazards and
evaluate their severity and risks.
Identify the critical control points, which are steps
where hazards can be reduced or eliminated.
Establish procedures for controlling
hazards and correcting problems.
Monitor the critical control points.
Correct problems as they arise.
Set up and use a record-keeping system.
Verify that the system is working
and adjust it as needed.

service. It then identifies what actions can be taken to reduce or prevent each risk. (See 
Table 2.2.) The activities that present the highest risk of hazard should be monitored 
most closely. For example, failure to wash your hands before handling cooked food 
presents a greater risk of hazard than a dirty floor. In other words, hazards must be 
 prioritized, and critical concerns take priority.
Note that the standards (or what some might call boundaries) applied in a formal 
HACCP system are no different from those that should be rigorously followed in any 
food service operation. HACCP does not impose new or different food safety standards; 
it is merely a system for ensuring that those standards are actually followed.
One way to ensure compliance is to frequently check and record the temperature of 
TCS foods during cooking, cooling and holding. Maintaining written or computerized 
time-and-temperature logs enables management to evaluate and adjust procedures as 
necessary. Whatever system is followed, all personnel must be constantly aware of and 
responsive to risks and problems associated with the safety of the food they serve.
Food service workers can be reminded of potential hazards by including detailed 
safety information in every recipe. Figure 2.9 is a recipe for Beef Stroganoff with all 
critical control points noted. Including this much detail in all standardized recipes 
is a constant reminder of both the specific actions necessary and the importance of 
food safety.

FOOD ALLERGIES AND INTOLERANCES
A food allergy occurs when the body’s immune system reacts to a substance in a 
food, usually a protein. This sets off a chain reaction within the body. Symptoms, 
which may occur within minutes, range in severity from mild to life-threatening. 
The only way to prevent an allergic reaction is to avoid the food and anything con￾taining that food. Protecting the allergic guest from exposure to allergens through 
direct contact or cross-contamination is the responsibility of every chef and food 
service worker.
According to the CDC, an estimated 4 – 6 percent of Americans have food aller￾gies. More than 160 foods are known to cause food allergies from spices and seeds 
to meats and fruit. However, the following nine foods account for 90 percent of all 
food-allergic reactions:
1 Milk and milk products
2 Eggs
3 Fish (e.g., bass, flounder, cod)
4 Crustacean shellfish (e.g., crab, lobster, shrimp)
5 Tree nuts (e.g., almonds, pecans, walnuts)
6 Peanuts
7 Wheat
8 Soybeans
9 Sesame
In the case of peanut, tree nut, sesame, milk, fish and shellfish allergies, the reactions 
can be severe. The consumption or contact with any of these ingredients can cause a 
potentially fatal allergic reaction called anaphylaxis.
Many allergy-causing ingredients or allergens hide in unexpected places. Eggs, for 
example, may be used in the topping on specialty coffee drinks. Even pastas that don’t 
contain eggs may be processed on equipment used for egg-containing pastas. Products 
made from soybeans are widely used in processed foods as well as vegetarian pre￾pared meals. Wheat may be used in glucose syrup, soy sauce and some modified food 
starches. The Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act (FALCPA)
requires food manufacturers to label food products that contain a major food allergen. 
FALCPA specifies that the type of tree nut (e.g., almonds, pecans, walnuts), the type of 
fish (e.g., bass, flounder, cod) and the type of crustacean shellfish (e.g., crab, lobster, 
shrimp) be declared. Labeling makes it easier for consumers and chefs to identify foods 
that contain major allergens.
A food intolerance is an abnormal response to a food or additive. An intolerance 
occurs when the body is unable to digest a certain component of a food. Though symp￾toms of intolerance may be unpleasant, including abdominal cramping or diarrhea, they 
are not life-threatening. The reaction to a food intolerance, unlike an allergic reaction, 
does not involve the immune system.
GUIDELINES FOR PROTECTING 
HYPERSENSITIVE GUESTS
Every food service establishment should provide food allergy training for its employ￾ees. Service staff should be able to provide hypersensitive customers (those with food 
allergies or intolerances) with a list of ingredients for each menu item. They should be 
food allergy an immune system response to 
a substance in food; the response may be 
digestive discomfort, breathing difficulties, 
rashes and other physical reactions, some of 
which may be fatal
allergens substances that may cause allergic 
reactions in some people
food intolerance an abnormal response to 
a food or food additive; intolerances are 
unpleasant but rarely life-threatening
M02_LABE1163_07_SE_C02.indd 35 28/10/23 10:58 AM36 CHAPTER TWO
trained to recommend ingredient substitutions. The kitchen must then follow strict con￾trols to avoid cross-contamination. Equipment and methods used when preparing food 
for an allergic guest must be analyzed to prevent allergenic food from coming into con￾tact with other food preparation surfaces.
Pans and utensils used to prepare foods for an allergic customer must be cleaned 
thoroughly between uses. Even a trace of food on a spoon, spatula or cutting board can 
cause an allergic reaction. Wash your hands and change your gloves before preparing 
food for a guest with allergies.
Segregate preparation of food for hypersensitive guests. When preparing several 
dishes at the same time, cook the allergen-free meal first. Then keep it covered 
and away from any splatter caused by other foods that are cooking. If you have 
handled an allergenic food, wash your hands with soap and warm water before 
serving the allergen-free meal. Some kitchens designate an allergen-free cooking 
station that is stocked with separate utensils and equipment. Many food service 
establishments use purple knives, cutting boards and cookware for this purpose. 
Treat any customer having an allergic reaction as an emergency. Call 911 and seek 
medical help immediately.
THE SAFE AND SANITARY WORK ENVIRONMENT
Kitchens are filled with objects that can cut, burn, break, electrocute, crush or sprain 
the human body. The best ways to prevent work-related injuries are proper training, 
good work habits and careful supervision. The federal government enacted legis￾lation designed to reduce hazards in the work area, thereby reducing accidents. The 
Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) covers a broad range of safety matters. 
Employers who fail to follow its rules can be severely fined. Unfortunately human error 
is the leading cause of accidents, and no amount of legislation can protect someone who 
doesn’t work in a safe manner.
Personal Safety
Safe behavior on the job reflects pride, professionalism and consideration for fellow 
workers. The following list of activities is aimed at preventing accidents and injuries:
	▪ Clean up spills as soon as they occur.
	▪ Learn to operate equipment properly; always use guards and safety devices. Turn 
off or unplug electrical equipment before cleaning.
	▪ Wear clothing that fits properly; avoid wearing jewelry or watches, which may get 
caught in equipment.
	▪ Knives may be the chef’s most important kitchen tool but they are also a 
potential source for serious personal injury. Observe the knife safety precautions 
listed on page 112.
	▪ Use knives and other equipment for their intended purposes only. When walking 
in the kitchen, carry knives close to your side with the point down.
	▪ Keep exits, aisles and stairs clear and unobstructed.
	▪ Always assume pots and pans are hot; handle them with dry towels.
	▪ Position pot and pan handles out of the aisles so that they do not get bumped.
	▪ Get help or use a cart when lifting or moving heavy objects.
	▪ Avoid back injury by lifting with your leg muscles; stoop, don’t bend, 
when lifting.
	▪ Use an appropriately placed ladder or stool for climbing; do not use a chair, box, 
drawer or shelf.
M02_LABE1163_07_SE_C02.indd 36 28/10/23 10:58 AMFOOd SAFET y And SAniTATiOn 37
	▪ Keep breakable items away from food storage or production areas. Never place 
knives or glassware in the pot sink.
	▪ Never leave a pan of oil unattended; hot fat can ignite when overheated.
	▪ Warn people when you must walk behind them, especially when carrying a 
hot pan.
All food service establishments should have procedures in place to ensure the safety 
of all workers and guests. When an unsafe situation arises, immediately report it to the 
manager on duty or appointed person in charge.
Fire Safety
From grease flare-ups on cooktops to major fires caused by dirty ventilation hoods, 
fires can develop into serious threats in busy professional kitchens. Understanding 
the danger posed by fires and having a proper fire safety program in place is of 
utmost importance in a professional kitchen. Fire extinguishers contain different 
types of chemicals that are effective for various types of fires. (See Chapter 5, Tools 
and Equipment, page 107.) Learn which type of fire extinguishers to use for specific 
 combustible materials. Regulations require that commercial kitchens be outfitted with 
 ventilation hoods and professional sprinkler systems. Grease fires in ventilation hoods 
are the primary cause of restaurant fires; thorough and regular cleaning prevents 
hazardous grease buildup. All fire suppression systems should be inspected regularly. 
When faced with a serious fire, do not waste time. Immediately call for help. Shut 
off all exhaust fans and turn off kitchen equipment if time permits. Close the kitchen 
doors and evacuate the premises.
Deep-fat fryers also pose a serious fire threat, and employee training should include 
instruction on the proper operation and cleaning of such equipment. In addition large 
quantities of hot fat can cause severe burns if not properly handled. When liquids 
come into contact with the heated fat, hot steam is released. Take care when adding 
food to a deep-fat fryer to prevent getting burned. The threat is most extreme when a 
large quantity of liquid hits the hot grease. Keep containers of liquids away from deep￾fat fryers to avoid accidentally spilling liquid into the hot fat and causing a hazardous 
steam explosion.
Chef uniforms were designed with comfort and safety in mind; the double front 
panels and long sleeves help prevent burns. Clothing and towels can catch on fire, 
however. If an employee’s garments catch on fire, use a safety blanket to wrap the 
person and smother the flames. Although it is generally best to use an appropriate 
fire extinguisher to douse kitchen fires, some simple measures can be useful for 
extinguishing a small flame in a pan. Immediately cover a pan in which a small 
oil flare-up occurs; lack of oxygen will extinguish the flame. To extinguish a small 
grease flare-up in a pan or on a cooktop, douse it quickly with a generous amount 
of baking soda or salt.
First Aid
Some accidents will inevitably occur, and it is important to act appropriately in the 
event of an injury or emergency. This may mean calling for help or providing first aid. 
Every food service operation should be equipped with a complete first aid kit. Municipal 
regulations may specify the exact contents of the kit. Be sure that the kit is conveniently 
located and well stocked at all times.
The American Red Cross and local public health departments offer training in first 
aid, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and the Heimlich maneuver used for choking 
victims. All employees should be trained in basic emergency procedures. A list of emer￾gency telephone numbers should be posted by each telephone.

 Food Safety Practices During a Pandemic 
 The recent global pandemic forced food service 
operators to adopt new practices. More space 
between diners, new outdoor dining areas, 
barriers between staff and guests and rigorous 
sanitization procedures help prevent the spread 
of coronaviruses. 
 Because the pandemic forced many 
restaurants to switch to a take-out and 
delivery business model, restaurants 
added specialized kitchen equipment 
and additional refrigeration systems for 
preparing quality food in a safe manner. 
While the fundamental kitchen practices for 
maintaining food safety have not changed, 
consumer concern for restaurant cleanliness 
and sanitation practices rose. According to 
Signaling Safety & Sanitation Multi-Client Study, 
a 2021 report by Technomic, consumers 
continue to expect high levels of cleanliness 
and visible sanitation practices. 
 The following are food safety practices 
that food service operators should continue 
to observe: 
▪ Provide online and contactless ordering and 
payment systems to minimize person-to￾person interaction. 
▪ Clean and sanitize tabletops and contact 
surfaces regularly. 
▪ Make alcohol-based hand sanitizer readily 
available to guests and staff. 
▪ Observe proper procedures in the advance 
preparation of foods to protect from the 
spread of food-borne pathogens. 
▪ Offer a dedicated pick-up area for take￾out foods. 
▪ Prepare foods that can be safely packaged 
for travel without loss in quality, flavor, 
texture and taste. 
▪ Provide instructions for safe storage and 
reheating of take-out foods.

 After studying this chapter, 
you will be able to: 
3. 1 understand nutrition basics by identifying 
the major nutrients and explaining their 
importance in a healthy diet 
3. 2 identify the essential nutrients 
3. 3 describe diet-planning tools for healthy 
eating available to consumers and chefs 
3. 4 understand principles of healthy cooking 
3. 5 use recipe modification techniques to 
achieve dietary goals 
3. 6 understand the requirements and ingredients 
used to accommodate special diets 
 Since the days of prehistoric hunters and gatherers, people have understood that 
some animals and plants are good to eat and others are not. For thousands of years, 
cultures worldwide have attributed medicinal and beneficial effects to certain foods, 
particularly plants, such as olives and olive oil, revered by ancient greeks. 
 Because of health concerns about over-consumption leading to obesity, cardiovascular 
disease and type 2 diabetes, many americans are interested in dining out in a healthier way. 
diners are increasingly concerned about how foods affect their health and which foods pro￾mote good health and longevity. at the same time people with certain health conditions that 
restrict or prohibit the intake of specific foodstuffs, such as sugar, fat or wheat, are looking 
for foods that will taste good and meet their dietary regimens. these concerns lead us to 
address the study of nutrition and the role nutrition plays in healthy eating habits. 
 this chapter sets forth basic information about nutrients and guidelines for planning a 
healthy diet. it also presents specific techniques for preparing foods for customers following 
special diets because of specific health concerns. 
 NUTRITION BASICS 
 The foundation of cooking is an understanding of ingredients, culinary techniques and 
the nutritive values of foods. All foods are composed of nutrients , the substances that 
promote the growth, maintenance and repair of the body. Some nutrients also provide 
energy (calories). 
 There are six categories of nutrients: carbohydrates, lipids (fats and cholesterol), pro￾teins, vitamins, minerals and water. Essential nutrients are those that must be provided 
by food because the body does not produce them in sufficient quantities to satisfy the 
needs of the body or cannot make them at all. (See Table  3. 1 .) Some nutritional com￾ponents are considered nonessential because healthy, well-nourished bodies can make 
them in sufficient quantities to satisfy their needs. Scientists, however, are beginning to 
understand that our bodies may need more of some nonessential nutrients such as cal￾cium, magnesium and potassium in order to provide protection against chronic diseases 
such as cancer, type 2 diabetes and heart disease. 
 The body depends on the various nutrients for different and multiple purposes, requir￾ing different amounts of each depending on age, gender and health status. In addition,

essential nutrients are those that must be provided in our diets because the human body does not 
produce them in sufficient quantities.
Carbohydrates Starches and sugars
Fats linoleic and linolenic acids
Proteins the amino acids: histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, 
phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan and valine
Vitamins Biotin, folate, vitamin B 6 , niacin, pantothenic acid, riboflavin, thiamine, 
vitamin a, vitamin B 12 , vitamin C, vitamin d, vitamin e and vitamin k
Minerals Major minerals: calcium, chloride, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, 
sodium and sulfur 
 trace minerals: chromium, cobalt, copper, fluoride, iodide, iron, 
manganese, molybdenum, selenium and zinc 
Water

some nutrients depend on one another for proper functioning. For example, calcium and 
vitamin D work together in the body: Vitamin D promotes the absorption of the calcium 
that the body utilizes for proper bone growth. A deficiency of one nutrient thus affects 
the working of the other. Because foods differ regarding their nutritional content, it is 
important to eat a variety of foods to achieve proper nutritional balance.
ESSENTIAL NUTRIENTS
Three of the essential nutrients provide energy needed in larger quantities than other 
nutrients. These three, known as essential macronutrients, are carbohydrates, certain 
lipids and proteins.
The calorie (often abbreviated as kcal) is the unit that describes the amount of energy 
in a food. Different nutrients supply different amounts of energy. One gram of pure fat 
supplies 9 kcal; one gram of pure carbohydrate supplies 4 kcal, as does one gram of 
pure protein. Most foods are a combination of carbohydrates, proteins and fats; hence 
their calorie content may not be easily determined unless we know how much of each 
nutrient the food contains. Calorie tables and nutritional labels on food products can 
provide that information. Foods that have a high proportion of nutrients in relation to 
their calories are considered nutrient dense. Such foods have a higher concentration of 
nutrients. Calories from some foods are considered empty calories because they have a 
low proportion of nutrients in relation to their calories. For example, refined white sugar 
supplies 4 calories per gram but these are considered empty calories because sugar does 
not contain any other nutrients. Consuming nutrient-dense foods and avoiding foods that 
provide empty calories is the foundation of healthy eating.
Vitamins and minerals are essential nutrients referred to as micronutrients because 
they are needed in small quantities. They must be provided through the diet because 
the body cannot manufacture vitamins or minerals in quantities adequate to ensure good 
health. Although they provide no calories, vitamins and minerals are important to the 
body because they allow the body to generate energy from the foods we eat.
Carbohydrates
Carbohydrates are the body’s major source of energy and are available from foods contain￾ing sugar, starch and fiber. Humans obtain carbohydrates primarily by consuming plant 
foods and the sugar in milk (lactose). Carbohydrates are classified as either simple or 
 complex depending on their molecular structure and how quickly they are digested to 
supply energy. Simple carbohydrates include monosaccharides (single sugars such as 
glucose, fructose and maltose) and disaccharides (double sugars such as sucrose, galactose 
and lactose), which provide a quick burst of energy. (See Table  3.2.) Simple carbohy￾drates are found in the naturally occurring sugars in fruit, vegetables and milk, as well 
as in sweeteners such as honey, corn syrup and table sugar. (See Figure 3.1.) Complex 
 carbohydrates are long chains of simple carbohydrates. Starch and fiber are complex car￾bohydrates that provide a slow, steady release of energy. Complex carbohydrates are found 
in fruits, vegetables and cereal grains, such as wheat, barley and oats. (See Figure 3.2.)
The body digests or breaks down sugars and starches into the single sugar, glucose. 
Glucose, also known as blood sugar, is an important source of energy for the body. 
A diet rich in complex carbohydrates provides energy as well as minerals, vitamins and 
calorie the unit of energy measured by the 
amount of heat required to raise 1000 grams 
of water 1 degree Celsius; also written as 
kilocalorie or kcal

as brown sugar, granulated sugar, 
powdered sugar and sugar cubes, 
as well as honey, corn syrup and 
other sweeteners.

and chickpeas.
fiber. The simple carbohydrates found in foods that are high in added sugar, such as 
candy, cookies and sweetened soft drinks as well as in refined flour, provide empty calo￾ries. Consuming them in excess may contribute to weight gain.
Dietary fiber, which generally comes from the seeds and cell walls of fruits, vegeta￾bles and cereal grains, also plays an important role in health. (See Figure 3.3.) There are 
two types of fiber: soluble and insoluble. Fiber-containing foods are usually composed 
of both kinds, with one kind predominating. Fiber is a unique carbohydrate because 
humans cannot digest fiber, so they do not get calories from it. Because the body cannot 
digest dietary fiber, it passes through the digestive system almost completely unchanged. 
This helps keep the digestive tract running smoothly. Insoluble fiber, such as that found 
in certain fruits and vegetables and whole grains, encourages proper elimination of 
waste products from the large intestines and helps prevent some forms of gastrointestinal 
distress. Soluble fiber, which forms a gel-type substance in the digestive tract, reduces 
serum cholesterol by helping to remove cholesterol from the body, thereby lessening 
the risk for heart disease.
Whole grains are considered good sources of dietary fiber. Whole grains are those that 
keep their bran, endosperm and germ. According to the Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA), in order to be labeled whole grain, a product must be composed of at least 51 per￾cent whole grain by weight. The grain may be cracked, flaked or ground. Whole wheat, 
oatmeal, whole-grain cornmeal, brown rice, whole-grain barley, whole rye and buckwheat 
are whole-grain foods. (See Figure 3.4.) Foods labeled with the words multi-grain, stone￾ground, 100% wheat, cracked wheat, seven-grain, or bran are not necessarily whole-grain 
products. Color does not indicate a product’s whole-grain content. Read the ingredient list 
to determine whether a product is indeed made with whole-grain ingredients.
Lipids
Fats and cholesterol are lipids. (See Figure 3.5.) Fats are found in both animal and plant 
foods, although fruits, vegetables and grains contain very little fat. Fats provide calories; 
pure fat provides more than twice as many calories by weight as carbohydrates or pro￾tein. Fats help our bodies process certain vitamins (called fat-soluble vitamins) and give 
food a creamy, pleasant mouth feel. A healthy diet contains a moderate amount of fat; in 
fact some forms of fat are considered essential.
Cholesterol, also a lipid, is found only in foods of animal origin, such as beef, pork, 
poultry, eggs, dairy products and fish. Cholesterol is not considered an essential nutrient; 
however, it is important to many body functions. It is not necessary to eat foods contain￾ing cholesterol because the body can manufacture all it needs from the fat in a normal 
healthy diet.
The fats in foods are classified as saturated or unsaturated depending on their 
chemical structure. Saturated fats are found mainly in animal products such as milk, 
eggs and meats, as well as in tropical oils such as coconut and palm. Monounsaturated 
fats come primarily from plants and plant foods such as avocados and olives and the oils 
made from them. Polyunsaturated fats are found in some plants (e.g., soy and corn) 
and fatty fish. Vegetable oils, such as rapeseed (canola) and olive, are high in monoun￾saturated fat. Cottonseed, sunflower, corn and safflower oils are high in polyunsaturated 
fat. All oils, however, are a combination of the three kinds of fat, and all vegetable oils 
are cholesterol-free because cholesterol is not found in plants.

Saturated fats such as butter, lard and other animal fats are usually solid at room tem￾perature. Monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats are usually soft or liquid at room 
temperature. Hydrogenation is a process by which a liquid fat is made more solid (or 
saturated) by the addition of hydrogen atoms. Hydrogenation also reduces the tendency 
to rancidity, thus increasing shelf life. Because the process results in these positive prop￾erties, hydrogenated fats are widely used in the food manufacturing industry.
Unfortunately the hydrogenation process also results in the formation of unsaturated 
fatty acids called trans fats. The FDA has banned the use of artificial trans fatty acids 
in processed food. Small amounts of natural trans fats occur in butter, cheese, milk and 
other animal products but these are not banned.
Research suggests that high-fat diets, especially diets high in saturated fat and trans 
fatty acids, are linked to heart disease, obesity and certain forms of cancer. Saturated fats 
are also linked to elevated levels of blood cholesterol, which is associated with arterio￾sclerosis (hardening of the arteries). A diet high in saturated fat and dietary cholesterol 
may increase the risk of heart disease.
Proteins
Proteins are found in both animal and plant foods. (See Figures 3.6 and 3.7.) Proteins 
are built from chains of amino acids. There are 20 amino acids, nine of which are 
essential but not produced by the human body. People need to consume these essential 
amino acids from protein-rich foods. Proteins are necessary for manufacturing, maintain￾ing and repairing body tissues. Hair and nails are composed of proteins, and proteins 
are essential for forming the outer layer of skin as well as for blood clotting and scar 
tissue formation. One special type of protein, known as enzymes, performs functions 
within cells such as assisting in the breakdown of foods to make them digestible. People 
who eat a varied diet with adequate calories and protein can easily get all the essential 
amino acids they need even if they do not eat animal products.
Vitamins
Vitamins are essential dietary substances needed for regulation of metabolism and for 
normal growth and body functions. They are noncaloric and needed by the body in 
small amounts.
There are 13 vitamins divided into two categories: fat-soluble and wat er-soluble. 
(See Table  3.3.) The fat-soluble vitamins are A, D, E and K and are found in foods 
hydrogenated fat unsaturated, liquid fats 
that are chemically altered to remain solid at 
room temperature, such as solid shortening 
or margarine
trans fats a type of fat created when vegetable 
oils are solidified through hydrogenation

physical processes that occur continuously in 
living cells and organisms

legumes, eggs and grains.
fiber. The simple carbohydrates found in foods that are high in added sugar, such as 
candy, cookies and sweetened soft drinks as well as in refined flour, provide empty calo￾ries. Consuming them in excess may contribute to weight gain.
Dietary fiber, which generally comes from the seeds and cell walls of fruits, vegeta￾bles and cereal grains, also plays an important role in health. (See Figure 3.3.) There are 
two types of fiber: soluble and insoluble. Fiber-containing foods are usually composed 
of both kinds, with one kind predominating. Fiber is a unique carbohydrate because 
humans cannot digest fiber, so they do not get calories from it. Because the body cannot 
digest dietary fiber, it passes through the digestive system almost completely unchanged. 
This helps keep the digestive tract running smoothly. Insoluble fiber, such as that found 
in certain fruits and vegetables and whole grains, encourages proper elimination of 
waste products from the large intestines and helps prevent some forms of gastrointestinal 
distress. Soluble fiber, which forms a gel-type substance in the digestive tract, reduces 
serum cholesterol by helping to remove cholesterol from the body, thereby lessening 
the risk for heart disease.
Whole grains are considered good sources of dietary fiber. Whole grains are those that 
keep their bran, endosperm and germ. According to the Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA), in order to be labeled whole grain, a product must be composed of at least 51 per￾cent whole grain by weight. The grain may be cracked, flaked or ground. Whole wheat, 
oatmeal, whole-grain cornmeal, brown rice, whole-grain barley, whole rye and buckwheat 
are whole-grain foods. (See Figure 3.4.) Foods labeled with the words multi-grain, stone￾ground, 100% wheat, cracked wheat, seven-grain, or bran are not necessarily whole-grain 
products. Color does not indicate a product’s whole-grain content. Read the ingredient list 
to determine whether a product is indeed made with whole-grain ingredients.
Lipids
Fats and cholesterol are lipids. (See Figure 3.5.) Fats are found in both animal and plant 
foods, although fruits, vegetables and grains contain very little fat. Fats provide calories; 
pure fat provides more than twice as many calories by weight as carbohydrates or pro￾tein. Fats help our bodies process certain vitamins (called fat-soluble vitamins) and give 
food a creamy, pleasant mouth feel. A healthy diet contains a moderate amount of fat; in 
fact some forms of fat are considered essential.
Cholesterol, also a lipid, is found only in foods of animal origin, such as beef, pork, 
poultry, eggs, dairy products and fish. Cholesterol is not considered an essential nutrient; 
however, it is important to many body functions. It is not necessary to eat foods contain￾ing cholesterol because the body can manufacture all it needs from the fat in a normal 
healthy diet.
The fats in foods are classified as saturated or unsaturated depending on their 
chemical structure. Saturated fats are found mainly in animal products such as milk, 
eggs and meats, as well as in tropical oils such as coconut and palm. Monounsaturated 
fats come primarily from plants and plant foods such as avocados and olives and the oils 
made from them. Polyunsaturated fats are found in some plants (e.g., soy and corn) 
and fatty fish. Vegetable oils, such as rapeseed (canola) and olive, are high in monoun￾saturated fat. Cottonseed, sunflower, corn and safflower oils are high in polyunsaturated 
fat. All oils, however, are a combination of the three kinds of fat, and all vegetable oils 
are cholesterol-free because cholesterol is not found in plants.

containing fat. Excess supplies of these vitamins may be stored by the body in fatty tis￾sues and the liver. Water-soluble vitamins are vitamin C and the B-complex vitamins, 
including thiamine (B1), riboflavin (B2), niacin (B3), B12, B6, pantothenic acid, biotin and 
folate. Water-soluble vitamins are not stored in the body to the extent that fat-soluble 
vitamins are, and excesses may be excreted in the urine. Because of these differences, 
deficiencies in water-soluble vitamins develop more rapidly when intake is not sufficient.
Virtually all foods contain some vitamins. Nuts, such as almonds, hazelnuts and 
p eanuts, and sunflower seeds are excellent sources of vitamin E, for example. In addition 
to citrus fruits, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, papayas and red bell peppers are good sources 
of vitamin C. Many factors contribute to a particular food’s vitamin concentration. An ani￾mal’s feed; the manner in which produce is harvested, stored or processed; and even the 
type of soil, sunlight, rainfall and temperature have significant effects on a food’s vitamin 
content. For example, tomatoes have a higher concentration of vitamin C when picked 
ripe from the vine than when picked green. Furthermore, different varieties of fruits 
and vegetables have different amounts of vitamins. A Wegener apple, for example, has 
19 milligrams of vitamin C, whereas a Red Delicious has only 6 milligrams. Because fresh￾ness has an impact on vitamin retention, many chefs prioritize purchasing organically 
farmed, locally grown ingredients and storing them properly.
Minerals
Our bodies cannot produce minerals. We obtain minerals by eating plants that have 
drawn minerals from the ground or by eating the flesh of animals that have consumed 
such plants. (See Figure  3.8.) Minerals are a critical component in hard and soft 
 tissues. For example, the minerals calcium, magnesium and phosphorus are present 
in bones and teeth. Minerals also regulate certain necessary body functions. Nerve 
impulses, for example, are transmitted through an exchange of sodium and potassium 
ions in nerve cells.
Minerals are divided into two categories: major minerals and trace minerals. (See 
Table 3.4.) Major minerals, such as calcium, are needed in relatively larger quantities. 
Trace minerals, such as iron, are needed in only very small amounts. As with vitamins, 
food processing and preparation can reduce a food’s mineral content. Soaking or cook￾ing in large amounts of water can leach out small quantities of minerals, which are 
water-soluble. Processing or refining grains, such as the wheat used to make white flour, 
also removes important minerals.
Water
The human body is approximately 60 percent water. Water is necessary for transport￾ing nutrients and waste throughout the body. It cushions the cells, lubricates the joints, 
maintains stable body temperatures and assists in waste elimination. Water also promotes 
functioning of the nervous system and muscles. Indeed, virtually every process of the 
human body uses water. Although the principal sources of water are beverages, water 
organic farming a method of farming that does 
not rely on synthetic pesticides, fungicides, 
herbicides or fertilizers; organic practices 
require that animals have access to outdoors, 
sunlight and clean water and that they are 
raised without antibiotics and hormones on 
organically grown feed.

 spinach and broccoli, as well as dairy and soy products, canned fish and almonds.

is also the predominant nutrient by weight in most foods. Some foods such as tomatoes, 
oranges, watermelon and iceberg lettuce are particularly high in water. Others such as 
dried fruits, nuts and seeds are lower, but even dried fruits and foods such as chicken 
and bread still contain some water. The body produces water when other nutrients are 
metabolized for energy.
Phytochemicals
Scientific research has identified nonnutritive components of plant foods called 
phytochemicals, which may be important in slowing down the aging process and 
preventing some forms of cancer, type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease, heart disease 
Figure 3.9 the phytochemicals 
called flavonoids in intensely 
colored fruits and vegetables such as 
blueberries and pomegranates may 
reduce the potential for developing 
debilitating diseases.

and other degenerative diseases. More than 10,000 dietary phytochemicals have been 
identified, including phytoestrogens, carotenoids and flavonoids. The health benefits of 
these substances appear to depend on consumption of a varied diet that includes plenty 
of grains, fruits and vegetables. The importance of phytochemicals to human health and 
 well-being should not be minimized even though they do not constitute a nutrient cat￾egory. Phytochemicals such as flavonoids and other compounds found in blueberries, 
pomegranates, green tea and cooked tomato products may act as antioxidants in the 
body to help eliminate unstable, potentially harmful substances known as free radicals, 
which are produced naturally by the body during metabolism. (See Figure 3.9.)
Controlling the Concentration and Retention of Vitamins, 
Minerals and Phytochemicals
In the kitchen a chef can control the concentration and retention of vitamins, minerals 
and phytochemicals through careful food preparation and storage:
	▪ Prepare vegetables as close to service time as possible; vegetables that are peeled 
or cut in advance lose more vitamins than those cut immediately before cooking.
	▪ The cooking method used, the temperatures to which foods are cooked 
and the length of cooking time may affect vitamin retention. Water-soluble 
vitamins are easily destroyed by preparation techniques involving high 
temperatures or submerging the food in water. Steaming and microwaving 
help retain nutrients, however.
	▪ In general, roasting and grilling meats, poultry, fish and shellfish will preserve 
more vitamins than stewing and braising, unless the cooking liquid will 
be consumed.
	▪ Storage affects vitamin retention. For example, long exposure to air may destroy 
vitamin C. Using airtight containers prevents some of this loss. Vitamin C is also 
lost when fruits or vegetables become shriveled from water loss during long or 
improper storage. Riboflavin (B2) is sensitive to light, so milk products, which are 
good sources of riboflavin, should be stored in opaque containers.
Cooking does not always make a food less nutritious. Besides making foods more 
palatable, cooking can help make foods more digestible, thereby making nutritious com￾ponents more readily available to the body. Heating foods to appropriate temperatures 
also makes them safer to eat by destroying harmful bacteria.
DIET-PLANNING TOOLS FOR HEALTHY EATING
A nutritious diet is a vital component of a healthy lifestyle. Diet and lifestyle planning 
is made simpler with recommendations from organizations such as the American Heart 
Association, the American Cancer Society, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), 
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the U.S. Department of Health and 
Human Services (HHS), to name a few. These organizations stress the importance of 
controlling the amount and type of fat in the diet; consuming plant foods, such as veg￾etables, fruits and whole grains, in greater quantities; and moderating the amount of salt, 
sugar and alcohol consumed.
 Dietary Guidelines for Americans
One useful diet planning tool is the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, jointly published 
every 5 years by the USDA and HHS. The 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans
emphasizes adopting healthy eating habits to prevent chronic diseases. The combination 
of foods that one eats are called “eating patterns,” which can adapt to one’s lifestyle, cul￾tural traditions, income level and flavor preferences. The most recent dietary guidelines 
take into account different eating patterns based on ethnicity and personal taste.
flavonoids plant pigments that dissolve readily 
in water; they are found in red, purple and 
white vegetables such as blueberries, red 
cabbage, onions and tea
antioxidants natural substances or food 
additives that inhibit or prevent a chemical 
reaction in fats and pigments in food causing 
rancidity, loss of vitamins and color; natural 
compounds that reduce presence of free 
radicals, harmful substances associated with 
premature aging and degenerative diseases
Healing Foods
those who first think of food as a 
pleasurable experience may not think of it 
as medicine or having medicinal powers, 
especially in the Western world. yet 
eastern cultures have considered foods 
to have healing properties for thousands 
of years and scientific evidence now 
supports that idea. interestingly, scientific 
findings suggest that positive benefits may 
be derived from many foods considered 
to be potentially harmful to the body. the 
findings, although preliminary, hold out 
some hope for those who do not want to 
give up the pleasures of the table. Some 
of the findings include the following:
▪ avocados, although very high in fat, 
are good sources of antioxidants.
▪ Beer consumption may increase 
bone density.
▪ dark chocolate contains antioxidants 
that may be beneficial in preventing 
heart disease.
▪ Coffee may offer some beneficial 
effects in reducing the risk of cancer 
and type 2 diabetes.
▪ eggs are a source of lutein, a 
phytochemical implicated in reducing 
the incidence of degenerative 
eye diseases.

M03_LABE1163_07_SE_C03.indd 47 31/10/23 7:15 PM48 CHaPter tHree
The 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans emphasizes four major goals 
for Americans:
1 Follow a healthy eating pattern that helps maintain a healthy body weight, 
reduces risk of disease and supports your nutritional needs throughout your life.
2 Choose nutrient-dense foods and beverages that reflect your personal preference, 
cultural tradition and budget.
3 Make nutrient-dense foods and beverages the main part of your diet. In order 
to stay within calorie limits, pay attention to portion size or the amount of food 
served at each meal. Consume a variety of nutrient-dense foods from all food 
groups including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, fat-free and low-fat dairy 
products, oils, lean meats and other protein-rich foods. Eat fruits, especially 
whole, unprocessed ones. Eat a variety of vegetables, from all groups: dark 
green, red and orange vegetables and beans and peas. Eat grains, half of which 
should be whole grains. Choose proteins from a variety of sources, including 
seafood, lean meat and poultry, eggs, beans and peas, soy products, and 
unsalted nuts and seeds.
4 Restrict the calories you consume from foods and beverages that contain sodium 
(salt), saturated fats, trans fats and added sugars.
The guidelines also encourage everyone to participate in regular physical activity as 
outlined in the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans, released by the HHS.
MyPlate
MyPlate is an educational tool developed by the Center for Nutrition Policy and 
Promotion (CNPP), a program area of the USDA. The MyPlate food guidance system is 
designed to promote the healthy eating recommendations from the 2020–2025 Dietary 
Guidelines for Americans. MyPlate uses the familiar image of a dinner plate to illustrate 
the five food groups considered the building blocks for a healthy diet: fruits, vegeta￾bles, grains, protein and dairy. (See Figure 3.10). Half of a plate of food should consist 
of fruit and vegetables, the other half grains and proteins. (See Figure 3.11.). Dairy is 
 represented as a smaller circle. The MyPlate guidance system encourages consumers 
to choose unprocessed, whole fruits and vegetables, whole grains and low-fat dairy 
products. It recommends that consumers vary the vegetables they eat and the sources of 
protein in their diets, and it recommends that consumers reduce the amount of sodium, 
saturated fats and added sugar in their diets. An interactive website helps consumers 
select foods and includes a diet and physical activity tracking program.
Nutrition Labeling
In an effort to provide consumers with greater information about the nutritional values of 
foods, the FDA requires that most prepared food products be clearly labeled. All pack￾aged food products must include the Nutrition Facts label. (See Figure 3.12.)
The FDA closely regulates the language used on all food labels. Terms such as low 
fat, lite or a good source of have specific legal definitions. The FDA also closely moni￾tors health claims on food labels. A breakfast cereal, for instance, may claim that its fiber 
content may reduce the incidence of heart disease only if it meets the criteria set forth by 
the FDA. The FDA has approved a number of qualified health claims that may legally be 
used on food labels and in the advertising of certain foods.
The FDA sets standards for the nutrition claims that can be made on restaurant 
menus too. The language for menus is the same as that for product labels. Restaurateurs, 
however, are required to supply nutrition information only if they make a claim about 
a specific dish. (Some jurisdictions such as New York City require that nutritional 
 information be supplied when a restaurant is part of a group of 15 or more restaurants 
bearing the same name.) For example, if a menu selection is described as “low fat,” the 
dish must have 3 grams or less of fat per serving and the nutrition information (nutrient 
analysis) must be available to anyone who requests it.

system.

 recommend obtaining half of one’s 
daily calories from whole fruits and 
vegetables.

Menu Labeling
Numerous health experts believe that menu labeling will promote better health and help 
stop the spread of obesity. The Affordable Care Act of 2010 requires that restaurants or 
similar retail food establishments with 20 or more locations doing business under the 
same name list calories on their menus. The regulations require that calories be listed 
on menus, menu boards and packaged foods on display. For self-service foods, such as 
a salad bar, calories must be listed per serving or per item on a sign next to the food. 
Menus are also required to contain the following statement concerning suggested daily 
caloric intake: “A 2,000-calorie diet is used as the basis for general nutrition advice; how￾ever, individual calorie needs may vary.” In addition, nutritional information for standard 
menus must be available to patrons in written form.
Government Oversight
In addition to helping consumers follow healthy eating patterns, the federal govern￾ment plays a key role in the way various foodstuffs are grown, raised, slaughtered, 
 processed, marketed, stored and transported. The principal agencies are the Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) 
and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).
The FDA’s activities are directed toward protecting the nation’s health against impure 
and unsafe foods, drugs, cosmetics, medical devices and similar products. It develops 
and administers programs addressing food safety. For example, the FDA must approve 
any new food additive before a manufacturer markets the additive to food producers and 
processors. The FDA also sets standards for labeling foods, including nutrition labels. 
Labeling regulations not only address the type of information that must be conveyed, but 
also the way it is presented.
The USDA’s principal responsibility is to make sure that food items are safe, whole￾some and accurately labeled. It attempts to meet these responsibilities through inspection 
Daily Calorie 
Requirements
Most adults need approximately 
1800–2500 calories each day to maintain 
weight. to lose one pound of body weight 
per week, calorie intake should be reduced 
by approximately 500 calories per day.
Here are the nutrients needed per day 
for weight maintenance:
Calories 1800–2500
Fat 60–80 g
Protein 70–100 g
Carbohydrate 250–375 g
Sodium less than 2300 mg
Cholesterol less than 300 mg
Fiber 25–30 g
a typical calorie breakdown might look 
like this:
Breakfast 400–600 calories
lunch 500–700 calories
dinner 700–1000 calories
Snacks Max. 200 calories 
per day
Serving Size: The FDA has defined standard 
serving sizes for approximately 150 food 
categories, making it easier for consumers to 
compare different brands. The serving sizes 
reflect the quantities people actually eat. (In 
the original version of the Nutrition Facts 
label, serving sizes reflected familiar units, 
which were not necessarily the quantities 
people consumed.)
% Daily Value: This section shows how the 
food fits into the daily diet. Most people are 
concerned about getting too much fat, 
saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, sodium 
and sugars added during processing in their 
daily diet. This section identifies the grams 
per serving for each of these nutrients and 
the percentage of the daily recommended 
amount of that nutrient each serving provides.
The footnote explains the meaning of the 
term % Daily Value (DV). It allows consumers 
to understand nutrition information in terms of

 Back to Basics: Organic Farming 
 great strides in agriculture and animal 
husbandry have been made during the past two 
centuries. Pesticides, fungicides and herbicides 
now eliminate or control pests that once 
would have devoured, ruined or choked crops. 
Chemical fertilizers increase yields of many 
of the world’s staples. But not everyone has 
greeted these developments with open arms. 
 during the past few decades, scientific 
and medical investigators have documented 
health risks associated with certain synthetic 
pesticides, fertilizers and other similar 
products. these findings have led to a renewed 
interest in a now multibillion-dollar-a-year 
back-to-the-basics approach to farming: 
organic farming. Specialty farms, orchards and 
wineries now offer organically grown products 
(or, in the case of wineries, wines made from 
organically grown grapes). these products 
come with few, if any, intentional additives 
and should be free of any incidental additives. 
Proponents argue that these products are 
better for you, better for the health of the farm 
workers and better for the environment. 
 the u.S. department of agriculture 
regulates the production and labeling 
of organically grown or raised foods. it 
requires that any natural food labeled 
“100 percent organic” must contain only 
organic ingredients—that is, those grown 
and manufactured without the use of added 
hormones, pesticides, synthetic fertilizers and 
so on; soil cannot have been treated with 
unapproved synthetics for 3 years before a 
crop can be labeled organic. organic practices 
require that animals have access to outdoors, 
sunlight and clean water, that they are raised 
without antibiotics or hormones and that 
they eat organically grown feed. to be labeled 
organic or to display the uSda organic 
seal, processed foods must contain at least 
95 percent organic ingredients by weight. 
Processed foods with 70–95 percent organic 
ingredients may be labeled “made with organic 
ingredients”; processed foods with less than 
70 percent organic ingredients may list those 
ingredients on the information panel but may 
not use the term organic anywhere on the front 
of the package. 
and grading procedures. For example, the U.S. Department of Agriculture regulates the 
production and labeling of organically grown or raised foods. The USDA also provides 
consumer services, conducts and publishes research on nutrition and assists those pro￾ducing our food to do so efficiently and effectively. 
 Other federal agencies that have a role in the nation’s health and food supply include 
the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) , which tracks illnesses, 
including those caused by food-borne pathogens; the National Institutes of Health 
(NIH) , which does basic biological and nutritional research; and the U.S. Department 
of the Interior (DOI) , which sets environmental and land-use standards. 
 PRINCIPLES OF HEALTHY COOKING 
 On a typical day, almost half of all American adults eat at least one meal in a food service 
establishment. Portion size and menu choices offered by many restaurants have been 
blamed for the epidemic of obesity in this country. Restaurant meals typically have more 
calories, sodium, fat and cholesterol but less fiber, vitamins and minerals than meals pre￾pared at home. Studies have found that people who eat out most often tend to weigh more 
than those who usually eat at home. By adapting their menus to feature more healthful 
options, chefs can accommodate all of their guests whether they are following eating plans 
to lose weight or address health concerns. Healthy cooking is based on sound culinary 
techniques that adhere to dietary guidelines established through nutritional research. The 
ingredients chefs offer their guests, the cooking techniques used and the amount of food 
served all impact customers’ health. Here we explore the ways you can adapt your think￾ing about portion size and ingredients to incorporate healthful eating into your menu. 
 Portion Size 
 Portion size refers to the amount of food served at a single occasion, such as a meal or 
a snack. The portions of food served in restaurants have gradually increased over the 
past few decades. Since the 1980s, calorie counts in popular items such as fast-food por￾tions of French fries or soft drinks has nearly tripled. The typical size of a soft drink has 
M03_LABE1163_07_SE_C03.indd 50 31/10/23 7:15 PMNutritioN aNd HealtHy CookiNg 51
increased from 8 ounces to 20 ounces for example. The weight of bagels, hamburgers, 
muffins and many other common foods has increased exponentially. According to a 
study by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, the average portion of spaghetti 
and meatballs served in restaurants has increased from 8 ounces (240 grams) to 16 
ounces (480 grams) in the past 20 years.
As a chef, you should be aware of the amount of food you are serving. The por￾tions actually served should be weighed or measured for consistency and food costing 
purposes. You can also benefit from learning to visually recognize an appropriate por￾tion size for various situations. Consider a comparison of the calories and nutrients in 
the three portions of chicken salad in Figure 3.13. Although the 2-ounce portion on the 
left may seem insufficient by itself for a luncheon plate, it may be suitable when served 
with a green or grain salad and sliced vegetables or a cup of hearty vegetable soup. The 
6-ounce portion to the right is triple its size and may provide too many calories and other 
nutrients for the average diner. The 4-ounce portion may be appropriate for a sandwich 
or a different dining situation. By presenting portion sizes that are appropriate to the dish 
and the occasion, a chef can help customers make healthier dining choices.
Rethinking the Center of the Plate
The center of the plate refers to the dominant foodstuff or the focal point of a dish. For 
too long, the first thing a chef or a diner considered was the meat or animal protein com￾ponent on the plate. Vegetables, salads, grains and fruits were seen as mere accompani￾ments, included for appearance or as a token nod to a balanced meal.
Vegetables, fruits, whole grains, beans, nuts and seeds, fish and seafood, lean meats, 
healthful oils and low-fat dairy products are the key ingredients of a healthful menu. 
They are rich in vitamins, minerals, phytochemicals and fiber, and they are relatively 
low in calories, fat and sodium. (See Figure 3.14.) Many chefs are now refocusing the 
center of the plate toward these healthful foods, all of which are high in beneficial fats, 
protein and other nutrients. This creates dishes that are better for customers’ health and 
the health and sustainability of our planet.
When creating new inherently healthful menu items, find inspiration in familiar dishes 
and menu items. The three chicken dishes shown in Figure  3.15 illustrate approaches 
a chef might use to adapt a recipe to produce a more healthful dish. Few meals are as 
satisfying and appealing as roast chicken served with puréed potatoes, asparagus and 
pan gravy shown below. The 10-ounce (300 gram) portion on the left features a skin-on 
chicken leg and thigh as well as a slice of the breast meat. Nutritional information for this 
dish is as follows: Calories 780, Total fat 45 g, Saturated fat 19 g, Cholesterol 255 mg. 
Equally delicious and more healthful options are available, however.

of chicken salad—2 ounces (60 grams),

Some of the flavors of roast chicken are captured by the dish shown in the center. 
Here the bone-in chicken has been replaced by a boneless skinless airline breast, which 
was sautéed to develop a golden color. The portion size was reduced to 6 ounces (180 
grams), and the skin was removed to reduce fat and cholesterol. Serving the chicken with 
puréed potatoes and root vegetables replicates the satisfying, traditional flavors associ￾ated with roasted poultry. Nutritional information for this dish is as follows: Calories
240, Total fat 14 g, Saturated fat 6 g, Cholesterol 95 mg.
The chicken preparation shown on the right in Figure 3.15 captures the rich flavors 
of roast chicken in a radically different dish. This gingered chicken broth still features 
chicken in a hot and aromatic preparation. In this version, however, only 4 ounces 
(120 grams) of boneless, skinless chicken breast is poached in a flavorful broth that is 
defatted and seasoned with fresh ginger. The broth, which contains squash and bitter 
greens, is filling without the calories, starchiness and fat of puréed potatoes. The cook￾ing method and leaner cut of poultry lowers the calories and saturated fat in the dish. 
Colorful, lightly cooked greens and steamed squash improve the dish’s nutrient content 
and appearance. Nutritional information for this dish is as follows: Calories 210, Total 
fat 1.4 g, Saturated fat 0.4 g, Cholesterol 90 mg.
Healthful Cooking Techniques and Menu Planning
Healthful cooking is based on the same principles employed in any fine professional 
kitchen: Use a variety of high quality, healthful ingredients and prepare them skillfully 
using sound techniques. Cook all foods with care to preserve their nutritional value, 
flavor, texture and visual appeal.
Healthful techniques are those that avoid adding fat, such as poaching, steaming, 
sous vide, broiling, grilling or roasting. Pan frying and deep frying should generally be 
avoided unless the portion size of the fried item is very small. For example, garnishing 
a vegetable-centered plate with a few crispy fried leeks can add both visual and tex￾tural appeal. Overcooking vegetables in water removes vitamins and minerals; sous vide, 
steaming and microwaving helps to retain nutrients.
Guidelines for preparing healthy meals and menus include the following:
	▪ Select fresh, minimally processed ingredients that are free from additives.
	▪ Use proper purchasing and storage techniques to preserve nutrients.
	▪ Offer a variety of foods so that customers have choices.
additives substances added to many foods 
to prevent spoilage or improve appearance, 
texture, flavor or nutritional value; they may 
be synthetic materials copied from nature 
(e.g., sugar substitutes) or naturally occurring 
substances (e.g., lecithin); some food additives 
may cause allergic reactions in certain people
a white bean salad with fresh vegetables 
and cheese provides a good balance of 
nutrient-dense foods.
Steaming is a healthy cooking method that 
does not require added fat.
Fresh fruit salad is a healthy dessert option.
M03_LABE1163_07_SE_C03.indd 52 31/10/23 7:15 PMNutritioN aNd HealtHy CookiNg 53
	▪ Offer entrées that feature healthful ingredients such as whole grains, vegetables, 
fruits, lean meats or poultry, fish, low-fat dairy products and vegetable oils. 
Emphasize plant instead of animal foods.
	▪ Use minimal amounts of fat, only the amount that is necessary to provide flavor 
and texture. Choose healthful fats such as olive oil, canola oil, nut oils and the fat 
from avocados. Minimize the use of saturated fats such as butter and cheese.
	▪ Serve modern sauces that are lighter in calories and fat. Build and intensify sauce 
flavors so that smaller portions are needed.
	▪ Use cooking procedures that remove or avoid the use of fat (e.g., stocks, sauces 
and soups can be cooled and the congealed fats removed; foods can be browned 
in the oven instead of being sautéed in hot fat). Use equipment that minimizes 
the need for added fat (e.g., non-stick pans).
	▪ Use minimal amounts of added sugar and replace refined sugar with 
natural sweeteners.
	▪ Use minimal amounts of sodium by reducing or replacing salt with other 
seasonings and avoiding the overuse of high sodium ingredients such as soy 
sauce or prepared condiments and flavorings.
	▪ Select cooking techniques that build flavor without using fat such as roasting, 
grilling, baking and poaching.
	▪ Serve appropriately sized portions.
	▪ Offer a selection of desserts that incorporate fresh fruit.
	▪ Train wait staff to respond properly to nutritional questions diners may have 
about menu items.
RECIPE MODIFICATION TO ACHIEVE 
DIETARY GOALS
To prepare healthy foods and cook for special diets, chefs must adapt recipes or create 
new ones that reduce, replace or eliminate specific ingredients as we have been discuss￾ing. This “reduce, replace or eliminate” process is referred to as recipe modification. 
When adapting and modifying dishes, chefs must review and test their recipes, consider￾ing the ingredients, cooking techniques, flavors and presentation.
Reduce, Replace or Eliminate
When modifying a recipe, first identify the ingredient(s) or cooking method(s) that need 
to be changed. Then use the following principles to make a dish more healthful or 
acceptable to the customer on a special diet:
	▪ Reduce the amounts of the ingredient(s) that need to be changed if doing 
so will not alter the structure, taste or appearance of the dish and make it 
unrecognizable to the original. In many recipes reducing the amount of oil, 
butter or other fat does not dramatically alter the dish. Note that this is not the 
case with baking formulas.
	▪ Replace the problematic ingredient(s) with a substitute that will result in the least 
change to the flavor and appearance of the dish.
	▪ Eliminate the ingredient(s) if doing so will not destroy the integrity of the dish. 
However, it may be necessary to make significant changes when serving a 
customer who is allergic to an ingredient for which there is no substitute. (Review 
the content on food allergies and intolerances in Chapter 2, Food Safety and 
Sanitation, for more information.)
intensely flavored sauces made without fats 
or starches are healthier alternatives to 
traditional sauces.
M03_LABE1163_07_SE_C03.indd 53 31/10/23 7:15 PM54 CHaPter tHree
In this text, we use the term ingredient substitute to mean replacing one ingredi￾ent with another that has similar—although not necessarily identical—flavor, texture, 
appearance and other sensory characteristics. In some cases the substitute ingredient 
may be more nutritious than the ingredient or preparation technique it replaces. For 
example, instead of thickening a soup with a roux, the chef may add puréed potatoes 
as a thickener or purée cooked vegetables to thicken the soup. In either case the soup 
thickened with potatoes or puréed vegetables is more nutritious than one made with a 
roux. Similarly those seeking to prepare dishes with less fat can use reduced-fat or nonfat 
sour cream in place of regular sour cream when baking quick breads. The differences in 
flavor, texture, appearance and baking quality should be minimal.
We use the term ingredient alternative to mean replacing one ingredient with 
another that has a different flavor, texture, appearance or another characteristic. An 
alternative does not compromise—although it may change—the flavor of the dish. 
As with ingredient substitutes, ingredient alternatives may be more nutritious. Lemon 
juice and herbs, for instance, can be used in place of salt; a salsa of fresh vegetables 
can replace a cream-based sauce. The dishes will not taste the same but they will still 
taste good.
Often ingredient substitutes and alternatives change the flavor, texture or appearance 
of a dish. Sometimes these changes are acceptable; sometimes they are not. Because 
some changes produce unsatisfactory results, many recipes are not suitable for substi￾tution or alteration. Use your judgment. Test your new recipes and evaluate whether 
the ingredient substitutions and cooking techniques used result in an appealing dish. 
Understanding the function of the ingredients in your recipe will help you to adapt the 
recipe to meet dietary needs. The quality of the final product must be as good as, if not 
better than, the original to meet the public’s expectations. If your reduced-fat, sugar-free 
lemon cheesecake has an unexpected flavor or texture that might disappoint a traditional 
cheesecake fan, consider renaming it. A name such as Lemon Cheese Soufflé Cake may 
establish more realistic customer expectations.
Modifying Recipes
When beginning the recipe modification process, the first step is to identify recipe 
ingredients and menu items that are good candidates for alteration. When develop￾ing a recipe for a low-fat diet, for example, start with recipes that are moderate 
in fat and do not rely heavily on fat for the dish’s flavor, moisture and structure. 
A fruit-based carrot or apple cake can tolerate the reduction of some of the fat from 
butter, oil or nuts. But a classic pound cake or shortbread that relies on butterfat for 
its characteristic taste and texture may not. Types of recipes that lend themselves 
to modification include bean and puréed soups; rice-based dishes; creamy dress￾ings and vinaigrettes; ground meat dishes, such as meat loaf or meatballs; and some 
 frozen desserts.
Carefully consider the flavors, textures and sensations of the original recipe when you 
are using substitute ingredients. You can replace fat-laden dairy products with low-fat 
counterparts. For example, use evaporated skim milk instead of heavy cream. Purée 
part-skim ricotta or cottage cheese to use as a substitute for full-fat cream cheese. Use 
lean meats in place of high-fat cuts or grades of beef.
Consider the wide array of cooking techniques available to you. Often it makes sense 
to apply alternative cooking techniques when modifying a recipe to make it more health￾ful or acceptable for a special diet. Use techniques that intensify flavor without adding 
fat, salt or ingredients that are unacceptable to your customer. Reductions, for example, 
intensify the flavor of sauces without adding caloric thickeners or fat. Toasting enhances 
the flavor of nuts and spices. The judicious use of herbs, spices, lemon juice, vine￾gar, onions, peppers and condiments can enhance flavor in place of salt. Oven-roast 
cut potatoes instead of deep-frying them. As you will see in Chapter 10, Principles of 
Cooking, different cooking methods can be used to achieve the desired color, flavor and 
texture of a dish.
roux [roo] a cooked mixture of equal parts 
flour and fat, by weight, used as a thickener 
for sauces and other dishes; cooking the flour 
in fat coats the starch granules with the fat 
and prevents them from lumping together or 
forming lumps when introduced into a liquid
Steamed fresh soy beans (edamame) served 
with salt is a satisfying and healthful appetizer.

Procedure for Modifying Recipes
1 identify the dish that needs to be modified, whether it is an hors d’oeuvre, appetizer, main 
course or dessert.
2 identify the goal of the recipe modification: improve healthfulness, reduce fat, reduce 
sodium, reduce sugar and/or eliminate allergens.
3 review the original recipe and note ingredients of concern. Consider the flavors and 
textures that are typical of the dish. identify which ingredients need to be changed to 
meet your goal.
4 decide on the ingredient substitutes or alternatives to use in the modified recipe. 
recipe testing will most likely be necessary to find the best modifications for 
your goals.
5 Note cooking techniques that are essential to the texture, flavor, body, appearance and 
identity of the original dish. Consider and select alternative cooking techniques to intensify 
flavors. Build flavor using cooking methods such as roasting, grilling, baking, poaching 
or steaming.
6 Balance the flavor desired with additional condiments, sauces or other preparations that 
complement the finished recipe.
7 Calculate and adjust the portion size with healthfulness or the special diet in mind.
8 Consider the balance of color and textures and plate the dish in an appealing manner.

ACCOMMODATING SPECIAL DIETS
While health-conscious consumers may simply want to cut down on certain foods, for 
other customers, specific physical conditions prevent them from eating specific foods, 
flavorings or beverages. In this section we discuss ingredient substitutes and alterna￾tives necessary for a variety of special diets, such as low-sodium, low-sugar, low-fat, 
 dairy-free, gluten-free, and allergen-free.
To accommodate such guests, chefs may be called on to make modifications to the 
dishes they serve. Patrons concerned with calories and fat may choose to order appe￾tizers in place of entrées to control quantity. They may request half-orders or split a 
full order with a companion. They may ask that dressings and sauces be served on the 
side or that a different cooking method be used—for instance, that a fish be broiled or 
baked instead of deep-fried or sautéed. A guest with celiac disease may become ill if 
they ingest any product containing the protein gluten, including bread, pasta, cereal 
or a roux-thickened sauce. Consumers with ingredient allergies may ask for detailed 
information on what a dish contains and how it is prepared. Service staff, cooks and 
other food service workers should take guests’ inquiries seriously. Failure to do so could 
result in severe illness or death. Chefs and restaurateurs should be flexible and willing 
to accommodate these patrons. Throughout this book we feature preparation techniques

and recipes that can be adapted for special requests, many of which are discussed in 
Chapter 26, Plant-Based Cooking.
 Low-Sodium Diets
Chefs are sometimes taught to use salt liberally to enhance flavors. Excessive consump￾tion of sodium, which is a major component of table salt (sodium chloride), is a dietary 
concern for many people, however. Excess sodium leads to the retention of fluids in the 
body. This can lead to hypertension (high blood pressure), heart failure, kidney diseases 
and strokes. The average American consumes 3000–7000 milligrams of sodium per day, 
far more than the recommended daily allowance of less than 2300 milligrams (about 
1 teaspoon [5 ml] of salt). A low-sodium food contains no more than 140 milligrams of 
sodium per serving.
Salt Substitutes and Alternatives
Salt substitutes look and measure like table salt and are readily available under various 
brand names. Most traditional salt substitutes are made from potassium chloride, which 
does not enhance flavors like salt. Some people feel that they add an “off” metallic taste 
to food. Newer salt substitutes contain seaweed granules or potassium lactate, sometimes 
with other chemicals added for flavor.
Modifying Recipes for Low-Sodium Diets
When your goal is reducing salt in the foods served, reduce the quantity of salt and 
sodium-containing ingredients used. The following suggestions can also help you to cre￾ate products that are lower in sodium or are salt-free:
	▪ Substitute lower-sodium alternatives such as reduced-sodium soy sauce whenever 
possible; often the quantity can be reduced without compromising quality.
	▪ Use naturally flavorful, low-sodium ingredients such as acids (vinegars, citrus, 
tomatoes), fresh herbs or spices, sweet and hot peppers or onions and garlic to 
develop flavor.
	▪ Add flavor to a dish by using a low-sodium marinade or rub, infusion 
or reduction.
	▪ Apply cooking methods that develop the flavor in foods such as grilling, roasting, 
smoking and poaching in a flavorful liquid.
	▪ Avoid using brined, cured and smoked fish and meats. They are high in sodium 
as are canned vegetables or tomato juice (unless they are low-sodium versions).
	▪ Prepare baked goods and snack foods in-house because commercially prepared 
baked goods and snack foods (such as potato chips and pretzels) are usually 
higher in sodium.
	▪ Use natural leaveners such as eggs or yeast in baked goods. Avoid baked 
goods made with chemical leaveners, discussed on page 934, because these 
contain sodium.
Low-Sugar Diets
Overconsumption of sugar leads to obesity and cardiovascular disease. Added sugars in 
sweetened soft drinks, salad dressings and most processed foods are contributing to a 
global obesity epidemic that should be of concern to chefs. Consumption of excess calo￾ries and sugar can lead to type 2 diabetes, a chronic condition that impacts the way the 
body processes glucose (sugar). For those with type 1 diabetes, a disease that prevents 
the body from producing the hormone insulin, consumption of carbohydrates includ￾ing sugar must be carefully managed. Many people who are seeking to lose weight for 
health and cosmetic reasons also limit their consumption of sugars and may appreciate 
low-sugar options in a restaurant or café.
M03_LABE1163_07_SE_C03.indd 57 31/10/23 7:15 PM58 CHaPter tHree
 Sugar Substitutes and Alternative Sweeteners 
 Sugar and other sweeteners add flavor and help promote browning and caramelization. 
In baked goods, sugar adds structure, texture and volume. Natural sweeteners, such as 
honey and agave, date or maple syrup, are suitable for those who prefer not to consume 
refined white sugar. The calorie content of these liquid sweeteners is just as high or even 
slightly higher than refined granulated sugar, however. Because natural sweeteners are 
usually in liquid form, appropriate adjustments should be made to recipes. 
 Several non-carbohydrate, low-calorie, artificial sweeteners suitable for those on a 
sugar-free diet are also readily available to consumers and food service operations. The 
sugar substitute saccharin (brand name Sweet’N Low, Sweet Twin or Necta Sweet), the 
oldest artificial sugar substitute, has been available for more than a century. It has no 
calories and tastes 200–700 times as sweet as table sugar. At one time, saccharin was 
linked to cancer in laboratory animals, but scientific evidence for safety in humans was 
convincing enough to permit the continued use of saccharin in food. Saccharin has a 
bitter aftertaste, however, and many people find it unpalatable. 
Aspartame (brand name NutraSweet, Equal or Sugar Twin) is 180–200 times as sweet 
as table sugar. Unlike saccharin, aspartame does not have an aftertaste. Aspartame breaks 
down when heated, so it cannot be used in cooked foods. It is widely used in soft drinks, 
frozen yogurts, fruit spreads, candies and similar products. According to the FDA, aspar￾tame is a safe substitute for sugar, although it is a risk for those people with the rare 
disorder phenylketonuria (PKU), who cannot metabolize the phenylalanine in aspartame. 
Monk fruit sweetener is extracted from the juice of monk fruit pulp. It is 100 times as 
sweet as table sugar and has no calories or carbohydrates. Monk fruit sweetener is heat 
resistant and works well in baked goods, beverages and as a replacement for table sugar. 
In baking do not replace sugar with an equal amount of granulated monk fruit as results 
will be far too sweet. Always check package labels as some brands blend monk fruit with 
other alternative sweeteners, which can affect their performance in cooking and baking. 
Stevia (Rebaudioside A; brand names Truvia and PureVia) is a sweet-tasting 
compound extracted from the stevia plant. It is not metabolized by the body so it is 
 non-caloric. Stevia is 200–300 times as sweet as table sugar and is used commercially as 
a sweetener for beverages in place of aspartame. Stevia can be heated or frozen without 
loss of flavor, but it will not replace the bulk provided by sugar in dessert products. 
Sucralose (brand name Splenda) is 600 times as sweet as table sugar and can be 
used like sugar in some baked goods. Sucralose, a derivative of table sugar, is virtu￾ally calorie-free because its sweetness is so intense that only tiny amounts are needed 
to replace the sweetness of sugar. Original Splenda cannot be used in baking but is 
appropriate in recipes that use sugar for sweetness. The granulated form is used measure 
for measure like regular table sugar. Splenda is also available blended with sugar in a 
product designed for baking. 
Sugar alcohols such as erythritol, isomalt , mannitol, sorbitol and xylitol are widely used 
in food manufacturing to make confections, cookies, gum, jams and frozen desserts. Derived 
from plant products, sugar alcohols contain some carbohydrates but may be used in baking 
applications. Powdered isomalt can be used measure for measure for granulated sugar. Taste 
receptors perceive sugar alcohols differently than glucose and sucrose; many consumers 
notice a cool aftertaste when eating foods prepared with them. Consumption of sugar alco￾hols can cause digestive discomfort, which limits the quantity one should use in a product. 
 Modifying Recipes for Low-Sugar Diets 
 When your goal is reducing sugar in the foods served, consider ingredients that provide 
a natural source of sweetness. The following suggestions can also help you to create 
products that are lower in sugar or are sugar-free: 
▪ Add a natural sweetness to sauces, stews, salads, marinades and glazes by 
incorporating ripe fresh fruits, berries, dates or dried fruit purées. 
▪ Substitute sweeteners derived from natural sources such as agave, maple syrup or 
honey in order to avoid refined sugar. Keep in mind, however, that these liquid 
sweeteners add their distinctive flavors to dishes, unlike refined sugar, which is 
simply sweet. 
 sugar alcohols carbohydrates extracted from 
plants that stimulate taste receptors to mimic 
the flavor of refined sugar but are not easily 
digested or absorbed by the body. With only 
2 kcal per gram, sugar alcohols are used in 
“sugar-free,” “diabetic-friendly” and 
“low-carb” products. 
 isomalt a type of sugar alcohol used as a 
sugar substitute and in sugar work. it is a 
disaccharide, composed of glucose and 
mannitol that is made from sugar beets.

	▪ Eliminate or reduce the sugar in any recipe where sugar is not absolutely 
necessary. Recipes that may not require sugar include salad dressing and sauces 
for savory foods or marinades.
	▪ Use fruit purées as sauces in place of caramel and sugar syrups.
	▪ Reduce the sugar in many formulas for muffins and cookies by 10–15 percent, 
which often has no effect on the final product.
	▪ Consider the sugar substitutes discussed above when cooking for people with 
diabetes. Use high-intensity sweeteners when a liquid sugar is called for in 
beverages, sauces or syrups. Note that liquid sugar substitutes are not suitable for 
baking without formula adjustments.
Low-Fat Diets
Although fats and lipids are essential nutrients in the human diet, consuming certain types 
of fats, or too many calories from fat has been linked to weight gain and an increased 
risk for cancer and heart disease. As discussed on page 42, all fats are nutrient-dense 
and high in calories. Recent studies suggest that it is the type of fat, not the calories 
from fat, that is of most concern. Some food ingredients are naturally high in fat, such as 
avocados, many cheeses and meat products. Customers on a low-fat diet may choose to 
avoid consuming such foods altogether. The fat added during preparation and cooking 
is most problematic for chefs because fat carries flavor and enhances the texture and 
consistency of many dishes.
Fat Substitutes and Alternatives
Fat adds flavor, texture and helps foods retain moisture. In baked goods, fat tenderizes, 
adds flavor, helps products retain moisture and assists in browning. Few true fat substi￾tutes exist. Substituting monounsaturated fats, such as those found in canola oil, olive oil, 
sunflower oil and avocados, for saturated fats will improve the health profile of a recipe 
but will neither reduce the total fat nor the calories in the dish.
Low-fat or fat-free dairy substitutes are generally good alternatives to full-fat products 
in most applications. Low-fat milk, cream cheese, sour cream and yogurt can be substi￾tuted for the full-fat counterparts in most applications.
To find an appropriate dairy substitute, first determine whether the dairy fat is neces￾sary for the success of the product. If it is, try a low-fat or fat-free substitute combined 
with additional ingredients to substitute for some of the fat you are removing. If the 
formula calls for whole milk, cream, sour cream, cream cheese or other cheese, a low-fat 
dairy alternative will usually work. Table  3.6 lists lower-fat or fat-free alternatives to 
some common dairy products.
Egg substitutes, discussed in Chapter 21, Eggs and Breakfast, can help those on a 
restricted diet enjoy breakfast foods, but egg substitutes have limited applications in

baking and general cooking. Two ounces (60 grams) or two large egg whites can sub￾stitute for one whole egg in some recipes. For dishes using a large quantity of eggs, it is 
best, however, to include at least a small portion of egg yolks for both color and texture. 
Pastry items made with whipped egg-white meringues are often used to create fat-free 
and low-fat desserts.
Modifying Recipes for Low-Fat Diets
When preparing fat-free foods, remove all fat from the dish. If your goal is reducing fat in 
the foods served, consider using ingredients that are naturally low in fat. The following 
suggestions can also help you to create products that are fat-free or lower in fat:
	▪ Substitute reduced or lower-fat dairy ingredients for full fat products or substitute 
one type of dairy product for another.
	▪ Replace vegetable oil with oils made from nuts including almonds, hazelnuts or 
walnuts. You may need less of these flavorful oils, thus reducing total fat, but 
remember that nuts are allergens for some consumers.
	▪ Eliminate or reduce the total fat in any recipe where it is not absolutely necessary. 
The fat in most soups, stews and roasted dishes can often be reduced by 
20–30 percent without any significant negative results.
	▪ Use cooking methods such as broiling, grilling, baking, poaching and steaming 
that do not require the addition of fat.
	▪ Choose lean cuts such as chicken breast and remove the excess fat and skin.
	▪ Reduce the quantity of red meat in a dish and cook with lean cuts of beef 
and pork.
	▪ Replace some of the fat in cakes and muffins with a fruit purée.
Dairy-Free Diets
Lactose is a natural sugar found in milk and dairy products. People who are lactose 
intolerant do not have the enzyme necessary to digest this milk sugar. For people who 
are lactose intolerant, consuming milk and dairy products can result in digestive problems 
and intestinal discomfort, but it is rarely life-threatening. In contrast, a serious allergy to 
casein, one of the proteins found in all types of milk, can cause life-threatening reactions 
if dairy products are eaten. If a customer reports that they cannot consume dairy products, 
be sure to remove any such items from their meal, no matter how small the amount.
Dairy Substitutes and Alternatives
Certain real dairy products are now commercially modified to be lactose-free and will 
work well in most culinary applications. Lactose-reduced and lactose-free dairy products 
may taste a bit sweeter than regular milk products, however.
Non-dairy milks and milk products such as yogurt and cheese are widely available 
and commonly used by people who are lactose intolerant or allergic to dairy. Dairy-like 
products made from tree nuts, grains and soybeans are suitable substitutes as they do 
not contain lactose or casein. (See page 59.) The many dairy alternatives on the market 
have different flavors and perform differently in culinary applications. Research the best 
alternative for your specific recipe needs.
Modifying Recipes for Dairy-Free Diets
When preparing dairy-free foods, avoid using all milk products as well as foods made 
from milk such as butter, cream, cheese, ice cream and yogurt. The following sugges￾tions can also help you create products that are dairy-free:
	▪ Replace butter with vegetable fats when pan frying or sautéing.
	▪ Select nut-, grain- or soy-based products in place of yogurt, ice cream, liquid milk 
and cheese.
	▪ Thicken soups with puréed vegetables, flour or starch in place of cream or milk.

	▪ Use nutritional yeast to add a rich cheese flavor to sauces and mashed potatoes.
	▪ Ask the guest whether they can eat certain types of cheese. Some lactose-intolerant 
customers may be able to eat cheese or other dairy products made from goat’s or 
sheep’s milk, but do not assume that this is the case for everyone.
Gluten-Free Diets
Celiac disease is an inherited autoimmune disease that causes damage to nutrient 
receptors (villi) in the small intestine when gluten is consumed. Gluten is composed of 
proteins found in wheat, rye, barley and products made from these grains such as malt 
and brewer’s yeast. Gluten allergies and intolerances affect as many as 18 million people 
in the United States; approximately 3 million (1 percent of the population) have true 
celiac disease; 2 million have wheat and gluten allergies and the remainder are sensitive 
to wheat products.
Unlike most diseases, celiac disease is treated exclusively with diet. By removing all 
sources of gluten from the diet, people with celiac disease can live a normal, healthy 
life. Consuming even small amounts of gluten can damage nutrient receptors in the small 
intestines, even without noticeable symptoms, however.
Gluten-Free Substitutes and Alternatives
Gluten-free substitutes for wheat flour include flours made from arrowroot, buckwheat, 
coconut, corn, potato, rice, tapioca, soy, amaranth, beans, flax meal, millet, quinoa, 
sorghum and ground nuts. (See Table 3.7.) Teff and oats can be substituted safely if 
they are manufactured without any wheat cross-contamination. Commercially available 
gluten-free baking flours ease the preparation of suitable high-quality products. Brands 
vary so be sure to follow each manufacturer’s directions for the best results.
Preparing dishes that are truly gluten-free requires that you educate yourself about 
suitable foods and ingredients. Because gluten hides in many prepared foods, such 
as sauces, soups, candy, cold cuts, processed meats, frozen French fries, surimi and 
even oatmeal, be certain to purchase and use only commercial products labeled as 
“ gluten-free.” It is then equally important to avoid cross-contamination with gluten 
sources in your kitchen. In addition to kitchen surfaces that come into contact with food, 
pasta cooking water and deep-fat fryer oil may harbor gluten. Segregate cooking vessels 
when preparing gluten-free foods.
buckwheat flour a dark, nutty-tasting 
gluten-free flour milled from the seeds of the 
buckwheat plant; used for centuries in Middle 
eastern and asian countries to make bread, 
cereals, noodles and baked goods
bean flour flour made by cooking, drying and 
grinding beans, typically chickpeas, soybeans 
and white beans, into a fine powder; often 
added to wheat flour or gluten-free grain 
mixtures to boost protein content
sorghum grain harvested from a plant that 
resembles corn, used primarily for animal 
feed and food processing applications; also 
called milo. When ground, sorghum may

 Modifying Recipes for Gluten-Free Diets
Finding gluten-free alternatives for basic ingredients is the best place to start when prepar￾ing gluten-free foods. Substituting rice flour noodles for pasta, thickening with arrowroot 
in place of roux and substituting mashed root vegetables for pasta or rice are some of the 
easier solutions.
The following suggestions can also help you create products that are gluten-free:
	▪ Select naturally gluten-free foods. Most meats, poultry, fish, dairy products, fruits 
and vegetables are safe for those with celiac disease.
	▪ Replace traditional accompaniments with gluten-free ones. Serve potato pancakes 
with smoked fish instead of blinis, for example. Or polenta in place of pasta. 
Polenta also makes an excellent crust for tartlets or pizza. (Verify that gluten-free 
ingredients such as cornmeal were processed in uncontaminated equipment and 
have not been susceptible to cross-contamination after the packaging is opened.)
	▪ Substitute nut flour, cornmeal or coconut flour when breading pan-fried foods.
	▪ Use eggplant or ribbon-cut zucchini in place of pasta for lasagna. Because a 
gluten-free diet lacks the beneficial dietary fiber found in many whole grains, 
incorporate fiber from beans, rice, vegetables and gluten-free whole grains.
Creating gluten-free baked goods requires several recipe adjustments, such as the following:
	▪ Substitute gluten-free flours and starches when making quick breads and 
cookies. Prepare a gluten-free blend with flours such as rice, sorghum, 
buckwheat or millet, with the addition of at least 30 percent starch from corn, 
potatoes or tapioca.
	▪ Add gums to gluten-free baked good recipes to help replace the elasticity of 
gluten in baked goods. Use 1 teaspoon (15 milliliters) of xanthan, guar or 
locust bean gum per cup of gluten-free flour blend when making pastries and 
1½–2 teaspoons (22–30 milliliters) per cup (240 milliliters) of gluten-free flour 
blend when making bread.
	▪ Add additional eggs to help build structure in gluten-free baked good recipes.
Allergen-Free Diets
Allergies to cow’s milk products, eggs, fish, shellfish, tree nuts, peanuts, wheat, soy 
and sesame are widespread, affecting millions of consumers. The consumption or 
contact with any of these ingredients can cause a potentially fatal allergic reaction 
or severe discomfort for the allergy sufferer. Review the material in Chapter 2, Food 
Keeping Halal
Many Muslims follow dietary laws based on 
the Qur’an (the revealed book), the Hadith 
(the sayings or traditions of the prophet 
Muhammad) and the collective wisdom of 
Muslim scholars. Halal, which means “allowed” 
or “lawful,” refers to foods and beverages that 
can be consumed by observant Muslims. Foods 
and beverages that are haram are not allowed, 
and those that are of a questionable or suspect 
nature are referred to as mushbooh.
as all fruits and vegetables are halal, most 
Muslim dietary laws address permitted and 
prohibited meats. Cooked (not raw) beef, lamb 
and chicken are halal, provided the animals are 
slaughtered and butchered according to certain 
rituals and methods. Fish and shellfish are 
also halal. Pork, game, carnivorous animals, 
birds of prey, carrion (the meat of animals that 
died of natural causes) and blood are haram, 
as are products derived from them. eggs 
and dairy products from permitted animals 
are halal, as are baked goods made with 
ingredients from permitted animals. any halal 
food contaminated with blood, pork or other 
haram product is deemed haram and cannot 
be eaten. alcohol, whether consumed as a 
beverage, used as a flavoring or even present 
in a cleaning solution for dishes, is haram. 
gelatin, emulsifiers, animal-based fats and 
certain dairy products are considered mushbooh
unless certified as halal. Halal certification is 
often denoted with the word halal in the logo or 
as a capital H inside a triangle.
in food service operations, it is best if 
equipment dedicated solely to halal cooking 
is used. if this is impractical and the same 
equipment is used to cook halal and haram 
foods, the equipment must be thoroughly 
sanitized before it can be used for halal 
products. Normally a careful visual inspection 
of the equipment suffices.

Safety and Sanitation, for a better understanding of the procedures to follow when 
preparing dishes for customers with food allergies. For example, in the case of a 
peanut allergy, any possible contact with peanuts or products made from peanuts, 
such as peanut oil or oil blends, must be avoided. Pans must be prepared with an 
alternative oil, and utensils untouched by peanut products must be used. It is never 
acceptable to simply “pick out” or remove the allergen from a prepared food or 
beverage.
Many consumers may be allergic to more than one ingredient. It might be pos￾sible to accommodate their needs by making a few simple ingredient switches. For 
example, if a customer who has celiac disease and is also allergic to nuts orders pan￾fried eggplant, use a gluten-free breading that does not contain any nut flour. If no 
suitable alternative is available, suggest a different dish rather than attempt to adapt 
one for a customer’s specific needs. If a customer who has celiac disease and is also 
lactose intolerant orders macaroni and cheese, recommend another dish with a similar 
flavor and consistency. Focus on the ingredients that are safe for the person to eat 
when crafting alternatives. When planning menus, anticipate customers with multiple 
allergies and intolerances. Include some dishes that are completely free from the most 
common allergens: cow’s milk products, eggs, fish, shellfish, tree nuts, peanuts, wheat, 
soybeans and sesame.
Nutritional Analysis of Recipes
A registered dietitian has analyzed all the recipes in this book using nutritional analysis 
software that incorporates data from the USDA, research laboratories and food manu￾facturers. The nutrient information provided here should be used only as a reference, 
 however. A margin of error of approximately 20 percent can be expected because of 
natural variations in ingredients. The government permits food manufacturers and sup￾pliers to use this same margin of error in their food labeling. Preparation techniques and 
serving sizes may also significantly alter the values of many nutrients. For the nutritional 
analysis, if a recipe offers a choice of ingredients, the first-mentioned ingredient was 
used. Ingredients listed as “to taste” (TT) and “as needed” as well as garnishes were 
omitted from the analysis. Corn oil and whole milk were used throughout for “vegetable 
oil” and “milk,” respectively. When given a range of ingredient quantities or numbers of 
servings, the average was used.
Throughout this book various recipes are marked with the symbol illustrated in 
Figure 3.16. This symbol identifies dishes that are particularly low in calories, fat, satu￾rated fat or sodium. These dishes may also be a good source of vitamins, protein, fiber 
or calcium as indicated in the nutritional information.

Keeping Kosher
Many observant Jews keep kosher following 
dietary laws rooted in the torah (the first five 
books of the old testament) and developed 
by Jewish scholars. these laws were designed 
to provide foods that are “fit or proper” (i.e., 
kosher) for use. Non-Jews may also keep kosher 
for their own religious or dietary reasons.
only certain types of animals are 
considered kosher, and those animals must 
be slaughtered and butchered using specific 
techniques. Meat must come from animals 
that chew their cud and have split hooves 
such as beef cattle, goat, lamb and venison; 
pigs, dogs and horses are never kosher. 
kosher poultry includes chicken, duck, goose 
and turkey, but birds of prey are forbidden. 
kosher fish must have both scales and gills, 
which eliminates catfish and eel. Crustaceans 
and shellfish are never kosher. dairy products 
are kosher if the milk came from a kosher 
species. Fruits, nuts and vegetables are 
kosher, as are baked goods made with kosher 
ingredients. Commercially prepared foods 
can be kosher if the manufacturing process 
is inspected and approved by any of several 
private rabbinical organizations. Packaging 
marked with U, K or a similar symbol 
indicates kosher certification.
additional rules require that meat and 
dairy foods cannot be cooked together or 
eaten during the same meal. People who keep 
kosher have two sets of cooking equipment and 
dishware, one for meat and another for dairy, 
to avoid accidental mixing. Pareve (parve) refers 
to neutral foods such as fruits, vegetables, 
breads, fish and eggs that can be eaten with 
either meat or dairy items. Not all Jews keep 
strictly kosher. those who do will only dine in 
kosher restaurants or facilities that have been 
approved by a rabbi for an event, such as a 
restaurant or catering hall used for a Jewish 
holiday or celebration.

Menus and Recipes 4
M04_LABE1163_07_SE_C04.indd 65 31/10/23 7:16 PM66
 After studying this chapter, 
you will be able to: 
4. 1 compare and contrast different types and 
styles of menus 
4. 2 explain the purpose of standardized recipes 
4. 3 measure correctly and convert from one 
measurement system to another 
4. 4 convert recipe yield and portion 
size amounts 
4. 5 calculate unit costs and perform yield tests 
4. 6 calculate recipe costs and selling prices 
4. 7 explain the need for and describe best 
practices for controlling food costs 
4. 8 describe the process for writing recipes 
for publication 
 Professional chefs must master more than the basics of béchamel, butchering and 
bread baking. They must be equally skilled in the business of food service. They must 
know what ingredients cost and how to control and maintain food costs. They must 
also understand how accurate measurements, portion control and proper food preparation 
directly affect the operation’s bottom line. This chapter introduces various types and styles of 
menus. it explains a standardized recipe format and presents information on measurements 
and techniques for changing or converting recipe yields. it describes methods for determining 
unit and recipe costs and includes a discussion of methods for controlling food costs. Because 
chefs are often asked to provide recipes for publication or may wish to publish their own 
cookbooks, an overview of recipe writing concludes the chapter. 
 TYPES AND STYLES OF MENUS 
 Whether it lists Spanish dishes, hamburgers, desserts or classic cuisine and whether the 
prices are inexpensive or exorbitant, the menu is the soul of every food service opera￾tion. The purposes of the menu are to identify for the consumer the foods and beverages 
the operation offers and to create consumer enthusiasm and increase sales. When com￾bined with good food and good service, a good menu helps ensure success. 
 Most menus offer diners sufficient selections to build an entire meal. A typical restau￾rant meal in the United States and Canada consists of three courses, which are served 
one at a time. The first course is usually a hot or cold appetizer, soup or a small salad. 
The second course is the entrée or main dish, usually meat, poultry, fish or shellfish 
accompanied by a vegetable and starch. The third course is dessert, either a sweet 
preparation or fruit and cheese. For a more formal meal, there may be a progression of 
first courses, including a hot or cold appetizer and soup, as well as a fish course served 
before the main dish. For a meal served in the European tradition, salad would be pre￾sented as a palate cleanser after the main dish and before the dessert. 
 Types of Menus 
 Menus are classified according to the regularity with which the foods are offered: 
Static or fixed menu: All patrons are offered the same foods every day. Once a 
static menu is developed and established, it rarely changes. Static menus are typi￾cally found in fast-food operations, casual family restaurants and those serving 
 international cuisines and steakhouses. Static menus can also be used in institutional 
settings. For example, a static menu at an elementary school could offer students the 
same luncheon choices every school day: a cheeseburger, fish sticks, chicken tacos, 
pizza slices or a sandwich, along with a vegetable and dessert. 
Cycle menu: A cycle menu is developed for a set period; at the end of that period, 
it repeats itself. For example, on a seven-day cycle, the same menu is used every 
Monday. Some cycle menus are written on a seasonal basis, with a new menu for 
each season to take advantage of product availability. Cycle menus are used com￾monly in schools, hospitals, summer camps, on cruise ships and in other institutions. 
Although cycle menus may be repetitious, the repetition is not necessarily noticeable 
to diners because of the length of the cycles. 
Market menu: A market menu is based on product availability during a specific 
period; it is written to feature foods when they are in peak season or readily avail￾able. Market menus are popular with chefs (and consumers) because they challenge 
the chef’s ingenuity in using fresh, seasonal products. Market menus often change 
daily because of limited product availability and perishability. Some use the term 
du jour , French for “daily.” Soup du jour refers to one served only on that day. 
Hybrid menu: A hybrid menu combines a static menu with a cycle menu or a market 
menu of specials. 
 entrée the main dish of a meal in the united 
states and canada, usually meat, poultry, 
fish or shellfish accompanied by a vegetable 
and starch; in France, the term entrée refers 
to the first course, served before the fish and 
meat courses 
M04_LABE1163_07_SE_C04.indd 66 31/10/23 7:16 PMMenus and Recipes 67
Food service operations may have separate menus for breakfast, lunch and dinner, often 
referred to as day parts. If all three meals are available all day and are listed on the same 
menu, the menu is known as a California menu; California menus are typically found in 
24-hour restaurants. Depending on the food service operation’s objectives, separate specialty 
menus for drinks, hors d’oeuvre, desserts, brunch or late-night options are used.
Whether the menu is static, cycle, market or hybrid, it can offer consumers the 
 opportunity to purchase their selections à la carte, semi à la carte, table d’hôte, menu 
dégustation or some combination of the three:
À la carte: Every food and beverage item is priced and ordered separately.
Semi à la carte: With this popular menu style, some food items (particularly appetiz￾ers and desserts) are priced and ordered separately, while the entrée is accompanied 
by and priced to include other items, such as a salad, starch and/or vegetable.
Table d’hôte or prix fixe: This menu offers a complete meal at a set price. (The term 
table d’hôte is French for “host’s table” and is derived from the innkeeper’s practice 
of seating all guests at a large communal table and serving them all the same meal.) 
A table d’hôte meal can range from very elegant to a diner’s blue-plate special. 
A prix fixe (fixed price) menu may offer limited choices at a fixed price, whereas a 
table d’hôte menu usually offers no choice.
Menu dégustation or tasting menu: It is increasingly common for restaurants to offer 
small portions served in four, five or more courses for a fixed price. This menu dégus￾tation or tasting menu allows diners the opportunity to sample a wider range of dishes 
than would normally be eaten in one meal. Chefs carefully craft such menus so that 
each dish complements the next dish served. Chefs frequently design tasting menus 
with a theme such as “spring asparagus” in which each course highlights an ingredient 
in a new guise. A selection of wines can accompany a tasting menu. For ease of 
service, restaurants usually require that the entire table order the tasting menu.
Many menus combine à la carte, semi à la carte and table d’hôte choices as well as a 
tasting menu. For example, appetizers, salads and desserts may be available à la carte; 
entrées may be offered semi à la carte (served with a salad, starch and vegetable); while 
the daily special is a complete (table d’hôte or prix fixe) meal.
Menu Language
The menu is the principal way in which the food service operation, including the 
chef, communicates with the consumer. A well-designed menu often reflects the input 
of design, marketing, art and other consultants as well as the chef and manage￾ment. The choice of folds, cover, artwork, layout, typefaces, colors and paper are all 
important considerations regardless of whether the menu is printed for guests or only 
appears online. The most important consideration for any menu is the vocabulary and 
terminology used.
A menu is the primary means by which a food service operation communicates with 
customers, so it should do more than merely list the foods sold. Descriptions includ￾ing the preparation method, essential ingredients and service method as well as the 
quality, cut and quantity of product are typical. For example, a menu might list simply 
“Porterhouse Steak” or “Wood-Grilled 16-oz. Angus Beef Porterhouse Steak” depending 
on the style of service, price point and type of customer.
Truth in Advertising
Federal as well as some state and local laws require that certain menu language be accurate. 
Areas of particular concern include statements about quantity, quality, grade and freshness. 
Accurate references to an item’s source are also important. If brand names are listed on the 
menu, those brands must be served. If the restaurant claims to be serving “Fresh Dover Sole,” it 
must be just that, not frozen sole from New England. (On the other hand, “Ukrainian borscht” or 
“English mint sauce” are generic names for styles of food, so using those geographical adjectives 
is appropriate even if the dishes are made in Arizona.) A reference to “our own fresh-baked” 
QR (quick response) codes are widely used to 
communicate with customers because of their 
lower cost and the ease with which changes can 
be made to menus.
M04_LABE1163_07_SE_C04.indd 67 31/10/23 7:16 PM68 cHapTeR FOuR
desserts means that the restaurant regularly bakes the desserts on premises, serves them soon 
after baking and does not substitute commercially prepared or pre-baked frozen goods.
Nutritional Statements
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) carefully regulates the language used on pack￾aged food labels. In 1997 the FDA extended its nutrition labeling regulations to restaurant 
menus. These regulations are intended to prevent restaurants from making misleading 
health or nutrition claims. For example, terms such as light, healthy and heart-healthy
must be accurate and documented. The standards for calculating and presenting that 
information on menus are far less stringent than the regulations for packaged foods, 
however. Restaurants may support their claims with data from any “reasonable” source 
and may present that information in any format, including verbally. As discussed in 
Chapter 3, Nutrition and Healthy Cooking, the federal government has passed legisla￾tion requiring that nutritional information be posted on menu boards and printed menus 
in chain restaurants with 20 or more locations. The regulations require that calories be 
listed on menus, menu boards and on packaged foods on display.
STANDARDIZED RECIPES
Menu writing and recipe development are mutually dependent activities. Once the menu 
is created, standardized recipes should be prepared for each item. A standardized recipe 
produces a known quality and quantity of food for a specific operation. It specifies 
(1) the type and amount of each ingredient, (2) the preparation and cooking procedures 
and (3) the yield and portion size.
Standardized recipes are not found in books or provided by manufacturers; they 
are recipes customized to a specific operation—cooking time, temperature and uten￾sils should be based on the equipment available. Yield should be adjusted to amounts 
appropriate for that operation. A recipe must be tested repeatedly and adjusted to fit the 
facility and the chef’s needs before it can be considered standardized.
Chefs and management use standardized recipes as tools to train cooks, educate ser￾vice staff and control finances. Standardized recipes help ensure that customers receive a 
consistent quality and quantity of product, and they are essential for accurate recipe cost￾ing and menu pricing. Each recipe should be complete, consistent and simple to read 
and follow; photos of plated dishes or finished items are often included. Standardized 
recipe forms should be stored in a readily accessible place. Index cards, notebook bind￾ers or a computerized database may be used, depending on the size and complexity of 
the operation.
MEASUREMENTS AND CONVERSIONS
The quantity of ingredients in each dish must be measured accurately to achieve the 
same results consistently. There are different ways of measuring food and different sys￾tems for recording such measurements. Chefs need to know how to measure correctly 
and how to convert from one system to another.
Measurement Formats
Accurate measurements are among the most important aspects of food production. The 
chef must be able to prepare a recipe the same way each time, and portion sizes must be 
the same from one order to the next. In a kitchen, measurements can be made in three 
ways: weight, volume and count.
Weight refers to the mass or heaviness of a substance. Weight is expressed in terms 
such as grams, ounces, pounds and tons. Weight may be used to measure liquid or dry 
recipe a set of written instructions for 
producing a specific food or beverage; also 
known as a formula
standardized recipe a recipe producing a 
known quality and quantity of food for a 
specific operation
 Safety Alert
Consumer Menu Advisories
Food safety laws dictate that all 
temperature controlled for safety (Tcs) 
foods must be cooked to the minimum 
internal temperature unless a customer 
requests otherwise. Restaurants are 
required to inform consumers of the risks 
associated with eating these foods at less 
than ideal cooking temperatures. Many 
restaurants include a reminder printed 
on their menu, such as “consuming raw 
or undercooked meats, poultry, seafood, 
shellfish or eggs may increase your risk of 
food-borne illness.”
in addition, food safety laws require 
that restaurants identify items that 
include Tcs foods that are not cooked, 
such as eggs or raw shellfish. Often these 
items are marked on the menu with an 
asterisk and a phrase such as “contains 
raw or undercooked ingredients.” check 
with local authorities to learn how these 
advisories must be conveyed to the 
consumers in your area.

ingredients (e.g., 2 pounds of eggs for a bread recipe) and portions (e.g., 4 ounces of sliced 
turkey for a sandwich). Because weight is generally the most accurate form of measurement, 
portion scales or electronic scales are commonly used to weigh ingredients in kitchens.
Volume refers to the space occupied by a substance. Volume is calculated mathemati￾cally as length X width X height. It is expressed in terms such as cups, quarts, gallons, 
teaspoons, milliliters, fluid ounces, bushels and liters. Volume is most commonly used to 
measure liquids. It may also be used for dry ingredients when the amount is too small 
to be weighed accurately (e.g., ¼ teaspoon of salt). Although measuring by volume is 
somewhat less accurate than measuring by weight, volume measurements are generally 
quicker to do.
Frequently mistakes are made in food preparation by chefs who assume wrongly 
that weight and volume are equal. Do not be fooled! Although 1 standard cup contains 
8 fluid ounces (volume), it is not true that the contents of that standard cup will weigh 
8 ounces. For example, the weight of 1 cup of diced apples will vary depending on the 
size of the apple pieces. Errors are commonly made in the bakeshop by cooks who 
assume that 8 ounces of flour is the same as 1 cup of flour. In fact, 1 cup of all-purpose 
flour weighs only approximately 4½ ounces. Furthermore, the weight of flour and other 
ingredients when measured by volume varies depending on the type of food and how it 
is placed in the measuring cup. (See Figure 4.1.)
It is not unusual to see both weight and volume measurements used in a single 
recipe. When a recipe ingredient is expressed in weight, weigh it. When it is expressed 
as a volume, measure its volume. Like most rules, however, there are exceptions to this 
one. The weight and volume of water, butter, eggs and milk are nearly identical. When 
measuring small quantities of these ingredients, you might prefer to use whichever 
measurement is most convenient. Some common abbreviations for weight and volume 
measurements are listed in Table 4.1.
Count refers to the number of individual items. Count is used in recipes (e.g., 
4 eggs) and in portion control (e.g., 2 fish fillets or 1 ear of corn). Count is also com￾monly used in purchasing to indicate the size of the individual items. For example, a 
96-count case of lemons means that a 40-pound case contains 96 individual lemons; 
a 115-count case means that the same 40-pound case contains 115 individual lemons. 
Each lemon in the 96-count case is larger than those in the 115-count case. Shrimp is 
another item commonly sold by count. One pound of shrimp may contain from eight 
to several hundred shrimp, depending on the size of the individual pieces. When plac￾ing an order, the chef specifies the desired count. For example, when ordering one 
pound of 21–25-count shrimp, the chef expects to receive at least 21 but not more than 
25 pieces.
Figure 4.1 The weight of many ingredients, such as flour, varies when measured by 
volume. These two photos illustrate how flour that is packed into a measuring cup 
(left) weighs significantly more than flour sifted then spooned into a measuring 
cup (right).

Measurement Systems
Weight, volume and count are used in both the U.S. and metric measurement systems. 
Both U.S. and metric systems are used in modern food service operations, so chefs 
should be able to prepare recipes written in either one.
The U.S. system is actually the more difficult system to understand. It uses pounds 
for weight and cups for volume. The metric system is the most commonly used system 
in the world. Developed in France during the late 18th century, it was intended to fill 
the need for a mathematically rational and uniform system of measurement. The met￾ric system is a decimal system in which the gram, liter and meter are the basic units of 
weight, volume and length, respectively. Adding a prefix to the words gram, liter and 
meter forms larger and smaller units of weight, volume and length. Some of the more 
commonly used prefixes in food service operations are deca- (10), kilo- (1000), deci-
(1⁄10) and milli- (1⁄1000). For example, a kilogram is 1000 grams; a decameter is 10 meters; 
a milliliter is 1⁄1000 of a liter. Because the metric system is based on multiples of 10, it is 
easy to increase or decrease amounts.
The most important thing for a chef to know about the metric system is that one does 
not need to convert between the metric system and the U.S. system in recipe prepara￾tion. If a recipe is written in metric units, use metric measuring equipment; if it is written 
in U.S. units, use U.S. measuring equipment. Luckily, most modern measuring equipment 
is calibrated in both U.S. and metric increments. The need to convert amounts arises only 
if the proper equipment is unavailable.
Converting Grams and Ounces
As you can see in Table 4.2, 1 ounce equals 28.35 grams and 1 fluid ounce equals 
29.57 milliliters. To convert ounces/fluid ounces to grams/milliliters, multiply the 
number of dry ounces by 28 or the number of fluid ounces by 29, using a number that 
is rounded for convenience.
8 oz. × 28 = 224 g
8 fl. oz. × 29 = 232 ml
Note on Measurements
all ingredients in this text are listed in 
both u.s. and metric measurements. The 
metric equivalents are rounded off to 
even, easily measured amounts. Treat the 
two ingredient lists as completely separate 
recipes or formulas. do not measure 
some ingredients according to the metric 
amounts and other ingredients according 
to the u.s. amounts or the ratio and 
proportions will not be accurate and the 
intended result will not be achieved.
Basic Mathematics
The same number may be written as a fraction, 
a decimal or a percentage.
a fraction shows the relationship 
between a part of something and its whole. 
an apple, for example, can be cut into four 
uniform pieces as shown here. One piece 
of the apple can also be expressed as the 
fraction 1⁄4 apple.
The top number (numerator) of the fraction 
represents how many pieces or slices of the 
apple you have: 1 out of 4. The bottom 
number (denominator) of the fraction represents 
how many pieces there are in the whole 
apple, 4 pieces.
a decimal is a type of fraction based on 
the number 10. You can convert a fraction 
to a decimal by dividing the top number 
(numerator) of the fraction by the bottom 
number (denominator) of the fraction.
To convert a fraction to a decimal, divide 
the top number by the bottom number:
1⁄4 apple = 1 ÷ 4 or 0.25 apple
3⁄4 apple = 3 ÷ 4 or 0.75 apple
a mixed number contains a whole number 
and a fraction. examples of mixed numbers are 
11⁄4 apples or 21⁄2 gallons of milk. To convert a 
mixed number to a decimal, first convert the 
fraction to a decimal. Then add this number to 
the whole number:
11⁄4 = 0.25 apples + 1 = 1.25 apples
21⁄2 gallons = 0.5 gallons + 2 = 2.5 gallons
another way to express a fraction is as a 
percentage. The word percent comes from the 
Latin phrase per centum, which means “by the 
hundred.” One percent means 1 part per 100 
or 1/100. One percent is written as 1%. For 
example, 20 percent means 20 parts per 100 or 
20/100 or 20%. and so on.
To convert a decimal to a percentage, move 
the decimal point to the right two places and 
use the percent symbol:
1⁄4 apple = 0.25 or 25% of the apple
note that when using a calculator, it is 
generally easier to enter the decimal form 
of a fraction or percentage, such as 0.75 
for 3⁄4. For example, to calculate 75% of 
32 ounces enter 32 × 0.75. The answer 
is 24 ounces.

TABLE 4.2
Fannie Merritt Farmer, an early proponent 
of scientific cooking, offers her student a 
measuring cup full of flour.
Fannie Merritt Farmer (1857–1915)
Fannie Farmer was an early, vigorous and 
influential proponent of scientific cooking, 
nutrition and academic training for culinary 
professionals. at age 30 Farmer enrolled in 
the Boston cooking school. The school’s 
curriculum was not designed to graduate chefs, 
but rather to produce cooking teachers. after 
graduating from the two-year course, Farmer 
stayed on, first as assistant principal and then 
as principal.
during her years there (and, indeed, for 
the rest of her career), Farmer was obsessed 
with accurate measurements. she waged a 
campaign to eliminate the use of imprecise 
measurements such as a “wineglass” of liquid, 
a “handful” of flour, a chunk of butter the “size 
of an egg” or a “heaping spoonful” of salt. For, 
as she once wrote, “correct measurements are 
absolutely necessary to insure the best results.” 
Farmer also sought to replace the european 
system of measuring ingredients by weight with 
what she considered to be a more scientific 
measurement system based on volume and 
level measures (e.g., a level tablespoon).
Farmer’s writings reflect her concern for 
accurate measurements. Her first book, 
The Boston Cooking School Cookbook (1896), 
includes clearly written recipes with precise 
measurements. Later editions included recipe 
yields, oven temperatures and baking times. 
Farmer wrote other cookbooks, including 
A New Book of Cookery (first published in 
1912 and republished in several revised 
versions). Her writings never address the joys 
of cooking and eating; rather, they reflect a 
scientific approach to cooking and rely on 
concisely, accurately measured recipes for 
good, solid food.
Likewise to convert grams/milliliters to ounces/fluid ounces, divide the number of 
grams/milliliters by 28 or 29 (rounded for convenience).
224 g ÷ 28 = 8 oz.
224 ml ÷ 29 = 7.72 fl. oz.

To help you develop a framework for judging conversions, remember that:
A kilogram is about 2.2 pounds.
A gram is about 1⁄30 ounce.
A pound is about 460 grams.
A liter is slightly more than a quart.
A centimeter is slightly less than ½ inch.
0°C (32°F) is the freezing point of water.
100°C (212°F) is the boiling point of water.
These approximations are not a substitute for accurate conversions, however. 
Appendix II contains additional information on equivalents and metric conversions. There 
is no substitute for knowing this information and it should become second nature to you.
CONVERTING RECIPE YIELDS AND PORTION SIZES
Whether it produces 6 servings or 60, every recipe is designed to produce or yield a 
specific amount of product. A recipe’s yield may be expressed in volume, weight or 
servings (e.g., 1 quart of sauce, 8 pounds of bread dough or 8 120-milliliter servings). 
If the yield in a standardized recipe does not meet your needs, you must convert (i.e., 
increase or decrease) the ingredient amounts. Recipe conversion is sometimes com￾plicated by portion size conversion. For example, it may be necessary to convert a 
recipe that initially produces 24 8-ounce servings of soup into a recipe that produces 62 
6-ounce servings.
You can change yields by uneven amounts just as you can double or halve recipes. 
The mathematical principle is the same: Each ingredient is multiplied by a conversion 
factor (C.F.). Do not take shortcuts by estimating recipe amounts or conversion fac￾tors. Inaccurate conversions lead to inedible foods, embarrassing shortages or wasteful 
excesses. Take the time to learn and apply proper conversion techniques.
Converting Total Yield
When portion size is unimportant or remains the same, recipe yield is converted by a 
two-step process:
Step 1 divide the desired (new) yield by the recipe (old) yield to obtain the conversion 
factor (c.F.):
new Yield ÷ Old Yield = conversion Factor
Step 2 Multiply each ingredient quantity by the conversion factor to obtain the 
new quantity:
Old Quantity × conversion Factor = new Quantity
EXAMPLE 4.1 Converting Total Yield
You need to convert a recipe for cauliflower soup that yields 1½ gallons. You want to make 
only ¾ gallon.
Step 1 determine the conversion factor:
0.75 gallon ÷ 1.5 gallons = 0.5
Note that any unit can be used, as long as the same unit is used with both the new and the 
old recipes. In this example, the same conversion factor is obtained if the recipe amounts are 
converted to fluid ounces:
96 fluid ounces ÷ 192 fluid ounces = 0.5
yield the total amount of a product made from 
a specific recipe; also, the amount of a food 
item remaining after cleaning or processing
conversion factor (C.F.) a number used to 
increase or decrease ingredient quantities and 
recipe yields

Old Yield = c.F.
Old Quantity × c.F. = new Quantity
M04_LABE1163_07_SE_C04.indd 72 31/10/23 7:16 PMMenus and Recipes 73
Step 2 apply the conversion factor to each ingredient in the soup recipe:
CAULIFLOWER SOUP
Old quantity × c.F. = new quantity
cauliflower, chopped 5 lb. × 0.5 = 2½ lb.
celery stalks 4 × 0.5 = 2
Onion 1 × 0.5 = ½
chicken stock 2 qt. × 0.5 = 1 qt.
Heavy cream 3 pt. × 0.5 = 1½ pt.
Converting Portion Size
Sometimes you need to change the amount of food served in one portion. For example, 
the new soup bowls at your café may hold less than the bowls now being used. You 
need to take a few additional steps to convert recipes when portion sizes are changed. 
This is easier to understand if you think in terms of the total amount of an item that is 
needed in relation to the total yield produced by the current recipe. The key is to find 
a common denominator for the new and old recipes: ounces, grams, cups, servings and 
so on. Again, any unit can be used, as long as the same unit is used with both the new 
and the old recipes.
Step 1 determine the total yield of the existing recipe by multiplying the number of portions 
by the portion size:
Original portions × Original portion size = Total (Old) Yield
Step 2 determine the total yield desired by multiplying the new number of portions by the 
new portion size:
desired portions × desired portion size = Total (new) Yield
Step 3 Obtain the conversion factor as described earlier:
Total new Yield ÷ Total Old Yield = conversion Factor
Step 4 Multiply each ingredient quantity by the conversion factor:
Old Quantity × conversion Factor = new Quantity
EXAMPLE 4.2 Converting Portion Size
For the cauliflower soup in Example 4.1, the original recipe produced 1½ or 48 4-ounce 
servings. Now you need 72 6-ounce servings.
Step 1 Total original yield is 48 × 4 = 192 ounces.
Step 2 Total desired yield is 72 × 6 = 432 ounces.
Step 3 The conversion factor is calculated by dividing total new yield by total old yield:
432 ÷ 192 = 2.25
Step 4 Old ingredient quantities are multiplied by the conversion factor to determine the 
new quantities.
CAULIFLOWER SOUP
Old quantity × c.F. = new quantity
cauliflower, chopped 5 lb. × 2.25 = 11.25 lb.
celery stalks 4 × 2.25 = 9
Onion 1 × 2.25 = 2.25
chicken stock 2 qt. × 2.25 = 4.5 qt.
Heavy cream 3 pt. × 2.25 = 6.75 pt.
no. of portions × portion size = Yield
new Yield
Old Yield = c.F.
Old Quantity × c.F. = new Quantity

Additional Conversion Problems
When making large recipe changes—for example, converting from 5 to 25 portions 
or 600 to 300 portions—you may encounter additional problems. The mathematical 
conversions described here do not consider changes in equipment, evaporation rates, 
 unforeseen recipe errors or cooking times. Chefs learn to use their judgment, knowledge 
of cooking principles and skills to compensate for these factors. In the material that fol￾lows these factors are discussed.
Equipment
When the size of a recipe changes, the equipment necessary to produce it must 
change as well. Problems arise when the production techniques previously used 
no longer work with the new quantity of ingredients. For example, a small muffin 
recipe can be mixed by hand, but an increased batch size may require the use of 
a mixer. But if you use the same mixing time for the small and large batches, the 
batter may become overmixed, resulting in poor-quality muffins. Trying to prepare 
a small amount of product in equipment that is too large for the task can also affect 
its quality.
Evaporation
Equipment changes can also affect product quality because of changes in evaporation 
rates. Increasing a soup recipe’s yield may require substituting a larger cooking vessel 
such as a tilt skillet for a saucepot. However, a tilt skillet provides more surface area for 
evaporation than does a saucepot. In other words when substituting a tilt skillet for a 
saucepot, the reduction time must be decreased to prevent over-thickening the soup. 
The increased evaporation caused by increased surface area may also alter the strength 
of the seasonings.
Recipe Errors
A recipe may contain errors in ingredients or techniques that are not obvious when it 
is prepared in small quantities. When yield is increased, however, small mistakes often 
become bigger (and more obvious) ones, and the final product suffers. The only way to 
prevent this is to test recipes carefully and rely on your knowledge of cooking principles 
to compensate for unexpected problems.
Time
Do not multiply time specifications given in a recipe by the conversion factor used with 
the recipe’s ingredients. All things being equal, cooking time will not change when 
recipe size changes. For example, a muffin requires the same amount of baking time 
whether you prepare 1 dozen or 14 dozen. Cooking time will be affected, however, by 
changes in evaporation rate or heat conduction caused by equipment changes, and an 
oven filled to capacity may lose more heat, thus slowing the baking time. Mixing time 
may also change when recipe size changes. Different equipment may perform mixing 
tasks more or less efficiently than previously used equipment. Again, rely on experience 
and good judgment.
CALCULATING UNIT COSTS AND PERFORMING 
YIELD TESTS
To ensure profitability, food service operations need accurate recipes that include 
ingredient costs. Some ingredients are sold in units, such as a can of tomato paste 
or a case of lemons, but are then used in smaller units, such as 2 tablespoons of 
tomato paste or 24 lemons. Some ingredients, such as meats, vegetables and fruits, 
require preparation that results in waste. The cost of the wasted peels and trim must 
M04_LABE1163_07_SE_C04.indd 74 31/10/23 7:16 PMMenus and Recipes 75
be accounted for in the final cost of the food item. Calculating the unit costs of ingre￾dients allows you to determine the cost to prepare a recipe and the price to charge for 
a finished dish.
Unit Costs
Food service operations purchase most foods from suppliers in bulk or in wholesale 
packages. For example, food service operations purchase canned goods by the case; 
produce by the flat, case or lug; and flour and sugar in 25- or 50-pound bags. The pur￾chased amount is rarely used for a single recipe. It must be broken down into smaller 
units such as pounds, cups, quarts, grams or ounces.
To allocate the proper ingredient costs to the recipe being prepared, it is necessary to 
convert as purchased (A.P.) costs to unit costs. To find the unit cost in a package con￾taining multiple units (e.g., 1 egg in a 30-dozen case), divide the A.P. cost of the package 
by the number of units in the package:
a.p. cost ÷ number of units = cost per unit
EXAMPLE 4.3 Calculating Unit Cost
A case of #10 cans contains 6 individual cans. If a case of tomato paste costs $33.50, you can 
use the formula just discussed to determine that each can costs $5.58:
$33.50 a.p. case cost ÷ 6 cans per case = $5.58 cost per can
If a recipe requires less than the total can, you must continue dividing the cost of the can 
until you arrive at the appropriate unit amount used in the specific recipe. If you need only 
1 cup of tomato paste, divide the can price ($5.58) by the total number of cups contained 
in the can to arrive at the cost per cup (unit). The list of canned-good sizes in Appendix II 
indicates that a #10 can contains approximately 13 cups. Using the same formula, you can 
determine that each cup costs $0.43:
$5.58 cost per can ÷ 13 cups per can = $0.43 cost per cup
The cost of 1 cup can be reduced even further if necessary. If the recipe uses only 1 table￾spoon of tomato paste, divide the cost per cup by the number of tablespoons in a cup. The 
cost for 1 tablespoon of this tomato paste is $0.027:
$0.43 cost per cup ÷ 16 tablespoons per cup = $0.027 cost per tablespoon
Therefore, when you calculate the total cost of a recipe containing 1 tablespoon of tomato 
paste, the unit cost is $0.027 or 2.7¢.
Cost information is usually provided to the chef or manager from purchase invoices. 
It may also be necessary to examine a product’s label or package to determine some 
information such as actual weight of the contents or number or size of items contained 
in a package.
Yield Tests
Computing ingredient costs is a simple matter if the foods are used the way they are 
received and there is no waste or trim as with canned tomato paste in the previous 
example. This is rarely the case, however. Chefs must often determine the yield, known 
as the edible portion (E.P.) of a product remaining after cleaning, trimming, cooking 
and portioning some food items. For example, yield refers to the amount of usable let￾tuce after a case of head lettuce is cleaned or the amount of meat that is available for 
service after trimming and cooking. To determine the actual cost of the edible portion 
of an ingredient, chefs conduct a yield test to determine the yield percentage, which is 
used when calculating both the as-purchased quantity (A.P.) needed for a recipe as well 
as the actual ingredient cost.

Yield Percentage
A yield percentage is the ratio of the usable quantity of an item to the purchased quantity. 
It is always less than 100%. The method of calculating yield percentage varies depend￾ing on whether the item’s trim is all waste (e.g., vegetable peelings) or whether the trim 
creates usable or sellable by-products (e.g., meat, fish and poultry). Both types of yield 
test are explained below.
To calculate any yield percentage, the edible portion (E.P.) is divided by the 
 as-purchased amount (A.P.). Note that E.P. and A.P. must be in the same measurement 
unit (gram, ounce, pound, etc.). Always begin by weighing the A.P. amount; do not sim￾ply rely on the quantity listed on an invoice or package.
e.p. Weight ÷ a.p. Weight = Yield percentage
To determine yield percentage, follow these steps:
Step 1 Weigh the ingredient as purchased before cleaning, trimming and peeling.
Step 2 peel, trim and clean the ingredient as required in the standardized recipe.
Step 3 Weigh the trimmed product to obtain the e.p.
Step 4 divide the e.p. weight by the a.p. weight to obtain the yield percentage.
EXAMPLE 4.4 Calculating Yield Percentage
The weight of 5 pounds of potatoes (A.P.) after peeling is 4 pounds (E.P.). By dividing 4 
pounds peeled potatoes (E.P.) by 5 pounds unpeeled potatoes (A.P.), you determine that the 
yield percentage is 80%:
4 pounds peeled potatoes (e.p.) ÷ 5 pounds unpeeled potatoes (a.p.) 
= 80% Yield
A percentage of .80 (80%) means that 80% of the amount purchased will be useable and 
20% will be discarded.
Yield Test Without By-Products
Many ingredients, such as fruit and vegetables, are cleaned and trimmed before use. For 
example, when you peel and slice apples for pie, the peels and cores are discarded. In 
this case there is no useable by-product, and all the trim is waste. This is common with 
fruits and vegetables and is the simplest situation. The percentage calculated using the 
method above is all that is needed to determine amounts to purchase or to adjust ingre￾dient prices for recipe costing.
Purchase specifications and fabrication techniques vary from one kitchen to 
another, so there are no universally standard yield percentages. Each kitchen should 
determine its own yields using its own cooks and its own cleaning and trimming stan￾dards. To be accurate, several tests should be conducted and the results averaged to 
arrive at a specific operation’s yield percentage for an item. That percentage can then 
be applied to future purchases and calculations. Lists of common yield percentages, 
such as those provided in Appendix III, are available as an indication of industry 
norms, however.
Yield Test with By-Products
With meats, poultry and some fish, only a small amount of trim will be discarded as waste. 
Much of the trim can be used and therefore has a value to the operation. Calculating 
yields on food items with usable or sellable by-products is a bit more complex than cal￾culating yields for food items when all trim is waste.
If the food service operation purchases only precut, portion-controlled meats and 
seafood and uses them just as they are received, A.P. and E.P. costs are the same. But if, 
as is often the case, the operation buys wholesale cuts of meat or whole fish or poultry 
and cuts them in-house, the chef must do a yield cost analysis or butcher’s yield test to 
butcher’s yield test calculations performed 
when fabricating meat, fish or poultry to 
determine accurate costs for the various usable 
parts of that item

determine the actual costs. (Although labor cost is a factor in purchasing decisions, here 
we are only concerned with actual food costs.)
EXAMPLE 4.5 Performing a Yield Test with By-Products
Your restaurant serves a boneless, skinless grilled chicken breast entrée. The restaurant buys 
whole fryers for $2.06 per pound. You must clean the chickens by removing the breast meat 
and skin and separating the wings, legs and thighs. You begin with a case of chickens weigh￾ing 35 lbs. After fabrication you have 10½ pounds of boneless, skinless breast meat. How do 
you calculate the cost per pound of this meat?
Calculations are simple if you discard all the trimmings, bones and scrapes. Divide the cost 
of the case (35 pounds × $2.06 per pound = $72.10) by the weight of the breast meat 
(10½ pounds) to find the cost per pound ($6.87). But most restaurants that fabricate their 
own meats do not throw away all of the trimmings. Bones are used for stock, wings are 
served on the happy hour buffet, and legs and thighs are used for chicken salad or fricassee. 
(See Figure 4.2.) Each of these secondary uses has a dollar value, which should be included 
in food cost calculations.
A typical method used for calculating yield is illustrated in Figure  4.3. It contains 
the results from the previously described chicken breast fabrication in a typical form 
used for yield testing. This form includes space for the by-products when fabricating 
Figure 4.2 Fabricating a chicken to

breasts and other useable cuts.

the chicken breasts. The values for the by-products should be what it would currently 
cost to purchase them. These prices can be obtained from recent invoices or purveyors. 
Some types of fat can be sold to a fat collection company, for example. If your operation 
sells its fat, this portion of the trim would also have a value and would be included as 
a by-product.
A new term appears on this form—cutting loss. Cutting loss is something that is not actu￾ally weighed. When you total the weights of the by-products and the tested item’s yield, you 
find that the total is 2½ pounds less than the A.P. weight (35 pounds). That 2½ pounds can be 
accounted for by particles of meat and fat sticking to the cutting board, blood and moisture 
loss and other discarded items. Cutting loss is unavoidable and has no value. It is included on 
the form in order to double-check other calculations.
After calculating the total value of all by-products, subtract that amount from the origi￾nal total A.P. cost of the chicken. This figure reflects the total net cost of the 10½ pounds 
of boneless, skinless breast meat:
$72.10 − $26.19 = $45.92
To find the cost per pound for the boneless, skinless breast meat, divide the total net 
cost by the tested item’s total yield weight. This is the figure you will use for costing 
recipes using the chicken breast meat:
$45.92 ÷ 10.5 pounds = $4.37 per pound
Using Yield Percentages
Yield percentages are used in two ways. First, yield percentages are used for 
accurate ingredient costing. Second, yield percentages are necessary for accurate 
 purchasing, especially of raw or unprocessed ingredients. Remember from earlier 
that yield charts available online or from vendors may be a good starting point, but 
they only provide averages and are not accurate for every operation. It is best to 
calculate yield percentages in-house periodically so that costs and quantities will 
be more accurate.
Using Yield Percentage to Calculate E.P. Cost
When a food product is cleaned or trimmed, a portion of what you paid for is 
discarded. The cost of the remainder of that food should be adjusted upward to 
account for the increase in its value. This revised price is then the accurate one to 
use in recipe costing. In other words, the price should be recalculated to account 
for waste. The A.P. unit cost must be converted to an E.P. unit cost. This is done by 
dividing A.P. cost by the yield percentage. Note that E.P. cost will always be greater 
than A.P. cost.
a.p. cost per pound ÷ Yield percentage = e.p. cost per pound
EXAMPLE 4.6 Using Yield Percentage to Calculate E.P. Cost 
per Pound
Carrots cost $12.50 per 10-pound bag ($1.25 per pound) and have a yield percentage of 78%. 
In other words, 22% of that 10-pound bag is waste. So, the bag of carrots has an E.P. cost of 
$16.02 and a unit cost of $1.60 per pound:
$12.50 (a.p.) ÷ 0.78 (Yield percentage) = $16.02 (e.p.)
$16.02 (e.p.) ÷ 10 pounds = $1.60 per pound
Alternatively, the cost per pound A.P. ($1.25) can be divided by the yield percentage (0.78) 
to arrive at the same E.P. cost of $1.60 per pound. With either calculation $1.60 per pound is 
the value to use when costing recipes.
cutting loss the unavoidable and unrecoverable 
loss of food during fabrication; the loss is 
usually the result of food particles sticking to 
the cutting board or the evaporation of liquids

Using Yield Percentage to Calculate A.P. Quantity for Purchasing
Yield percentages are useful in determining how much of a raw item to buy when 
you know how much of the cooked item you need. If the quantity of an ingredient 
listed in the recipe is ordered and then that item requires trimming, the amount of 
the ingredient used in the recipe will be inaccurate and the recipe will produce less 
than the desired amount. To find the A.P. quantity needed for a recipe, divide the 
E.P. quantity by the yield percentage. Note that A.P. quantity will always be greater 
than E.P. quantity when a food item must be fabricated or trimmed before use in 
a recipe.
e.p. Quantity ÷ Yield percentage = a.p. Quantity
EXAMPLE 4.7 Using Yield Percentage to Calculate A.P. Quantity
A recipe calls for 12 pounds of peeled potatoes with an 80% yield percentage. Using the for￾mula, you can determine that you should begin with 15 pounds of A.P. potatoes to produce 
12 pounds E.P.:
12 pounds (e.p.) ÷ 0.80 (Yield percentage) = 15 pounds (a.p.)
Calculating a pre-trimmed purchase quantity does not make it unnecessary to weigh the 
trimmed ingredient accurately when preparing a dish. Every time an ingredient is trimmed 
or fabricated, the actual amount produced may differ. The vast number of variables in 
culinary situations require accurate measurements with the ingredients actually being used 
every time.
Cooked Yield Tests
The final stage in calculating yield is done after a food is cooked, although this step 
is not always necessary. Most foods suffer additional loss of weight or volume in 
the cooking process. Loss also occurs when trimming fat or bones and slicing and 
 portioning foods after cooking. This type of loss is known as shrinkage. To accurately 
determine portion cost and purchasing quantities, these losses must be considered, 
especially if the food portion is determined by weight after cooking (e.g., sliced roast 
beef for sandwiches). The amount of that loss depends on cooking method, internal 
temperature, quality of meat and so forth. Thus if you need enough sliced roast beef for 
80 4-ounce sandwiches, you will need more than 320 ounces (80 × 4) of pre-cooked 
beef. This is something a cook must remember for purchasing and menu planning.
 RECIPE COSTS AND SELLING PRICES
Now that you know how to calculate the cost of ingredients, you can determine the cost 
to prepare a recipe or formula that contains multiple ingredients. You can also calculate 
the cost to prepare a complete menu item, which may include side items or separate reci￾pes for components of the dish. With that information, you can set profitable menu prices.
Recipe Cost
A standardized recipe, listing the ingredients and their amounts, as well as the number 
and size of the portions, must be established in order to determine the cost of a com￾pleted menu item. Once an accurate recipe is written, the total recipe cost is calculated 
with the following two-step process:
Step 1 determine the cost for the given quantity of each recipe ingredient with the unit 
costing procedures described earlier.
Step 2 add all the ingredient costs together to obtain the total recipe cost.
shrinkage the loss of weight or volume of a 
food due to evaporation of liquid or melting of 
fat during cooking

a particular recipe; total recipe cost does not

M04_LABE1163_07_SE_C04.indd 79 31/10/23 7:16 PM80 cHapTeR FOuR
The total recipe cost can then be broken down into the cost per portion, which is 
the most useful figure for food cost controls. (See Figure 4.4.) To arrive at cost per por￾tion, divide the total recipe cost by the total number of servings or portions produced 
by that recipe:
Total Recipe cost ÷ number of portions = cost per portion
The Recipe Costing Form in Figure 4.5 is useful for organizing recipe-costing informa￾tion. It provides space for listing each ingredient, the quantity of each ingredient needed, 
the cost of each unit (E.P.) and the total cost for the ingredient. Some ingredients such as 
salt, pepper and spices that are used as needed in small amounts may be accounted for 
by assigning a fixed cost to them in each recipe. Called the Q factor (for questionable 
ingredients), it is a percentage of the total recipe cost added in after all ingredients are 
calculated. The Q factor for an individual recipe may be as little as 1–5 percent and is 
established by management.
Total yield, portion size and cost per portion are listed at the bottom of the form. 
Note that there is no space for recipe procedures because these are generally irrelevant 
in recipe costing.
In the example in Figure 4.4, the recipe produces one sandwich, which is also the 
portion. Because there are no fabrication requirements when assembling the ingredi￾ents for this sandwich, there are no yield percentages to calculate. The Recipe Costing 
Form in Figure 4.5 shows the ingredients in a dish that serves more than one person.

parsley in this recipe requires an additional step. It is also necessary to calculate the final 
cost per portion based on the stated serving size.
 Selling Price
Portion cost is just one factor used to determine the selling price of a dish. Each item on 
the plate, such as the buttered noodles and green beans that may accompany the Beef 
Stroganoff in Figure 4.5, adds to the total plate cost, as shown in Figure 4.6. The por￾tion cost of several recipes may need to be calculated to determine what a finished dish 
costs. A meal may include a roll and butter as well as condiments such as mayonnaise 
or mustard. The cost of these items can be covered by using a Q factor in the total plate 
cost calculation as shown in this example. In addition, a food service operation incurs 
kitchen and dining room labor costs and numerous overhead costs in the preparation 
and service of a menu. Typically these include the cost of utilities, rent, supplies, linens, 
advertising and promotional expenses along with myriad other expenses necessary for 
the business to operate successfully. 
Working closely with its chef, restaurant management determines the food cost 
 percentage it needs to achieve to be profitable. This percentage represents the cost of 
all food used divided by the total sales in a restaurant. Kitchen waste, inefficient trim￾ming of meats and inconsistent portion sizes all contribute to increases in food cost and 
decreased profitability.

The food cost percentage is one of many methods used to determine selling prices of 
each individual menu item in the following manner:
Step 1 determine the total cost of all components in a finished plate.
Step 2 divide the total plate cost by the desired food cost percentage.
plate cost ÷ desired Food cost % = selling price
EXAMPLE 4.8 Calculating Selling Price
To determine the selling price for the Beef Stroganoff in Figure 4.6, if management wants to 
achieve a 35% food cost, divide the total plate cost of $5.37 by 35%:
$5.37 plate cost ÷ 35% (desired Food cost %) = $15.34 (proposed selling price)
Management may adjust calculated selling prices for consistency or for psychological 
impact. A restaurant may round all calculated prices to the nearest dollar or adjust menu 
prices up or down slightly to use certain numerals. For example, using a 9 or 7 as the last 
digit in a price creates the impression of a discount. Prices ending in a 9 or 7 appeal to 
 price-conscious customers. On the other hand prices ending in .00 and prices without any 
decimal amount are perceived as being of higher quality, so they are often used on fine￾dining menus. In addition, people do not like seeing a large spread in menu prices. Erratic 
pricing may cause confusion or make customers think something is wrong with one or more 
of the items. For example, a steak dinner for $38 may be a reasonable price mathematically, 
but it would be inappropriate on a menu where all other dinners cost less than $18.
Establishing menu prices is one of the most difficult yet most important things a chef or 
manager can do to affect an operation’s success. No single method is best for all operations, 
so careful study of several approaches is recommended.
 CONTROLLING FOOD COSTS
Chefs work closely with food service managers to keep the food cost percentage 
within established guidelines. Taking periodic physical inventory helps management 
verify that the proper quantities of food are being purchased and used. Many things 
inventory the listing and counting of all foods 
in the kitchen, storerooms and refrigerators

affect food costs in any given operation; most can be controlled by the 
chef or manager. These controls do not require mathematical calculations or 
formulas, just basic management skills and a good dose of common sense. 
Chefs tend to focus their control efforts in the area of kitchen preparation. 
Although this may seem logical, it is not adequate. A good chef is involved 
in all aspects of the operation to help prevent problems from arising or to 
correct those that may occur.
The menu, purchasing/ordering, receiving, storing, issuing, portion size, 
waste and sales and service all impact the operation’s bottom line.
Menu
A profitable menu is based on many variables, including customer desires, 
physical space and equipment, ingredient availability, cost of goods sold, 
employee skills and competition. All management personnel, including the 
chef, should be consulted when planning the menu. Menu changes, though 
possibly desirable, must be executed with as much care as was taken in plan￾ning the original menu.
Purchasing and Ordering
Purchasing techniques have a direct impact on cost controls. On the one hand 
parstock (par) must be adequate for efficient operations; on the other hand too 
much inventory wastes space and resources and may spoil. Before any items 
are ordered, purchasing specifications should be established and communicated 
to potential purveyors. Specifications (specs) should precisely describe the item, includ￾ing grade, quality, packaging and unit size. Each operation should design its own form to 
best meet its specific needs. A sample specification form is shown in Figure 4.7. The infor￾mation in the form can be used to obtain price quotes from several purveyors. Update 
quotes periodically to ensure that you are getting the best value for your money.
Receiving
Whether goods are received by a full-time clerk, as they are in a large hotel, or by the chef 
or kitchen manager, certain standards should be observed. The person signing for mer￾chandise should first confirm that the items were actually ordered. Second, confirm that 
the items listed on the invoice are the ones being delivered and that the price and quan￾tity listed are accurate. Third, the items, especially meats and produce, should be checked 
for quality, freshness and weight. The temperature of all perishable items should be care￾fully checked at the time of delivery to ensure compliance with food safety standards. 
Established purchase specifications should be made readily available for anyone respon￾sible for receiving goods. If an item does not meet any of these purchase specifications 
or is not within acceptable temperature ranges on arrival, the product should be refused.
Storing
Proper storage of foodstuffs is crucial in order to prevent spoilage, pilferage and waste. 
Stock must be rotated so that the older items are used first. Such a system for rotating 
stock is referred to as FIFO (first in, first out). Dry storage areas should be well venti￾lated and lit to prevent pest infestation and mold. Freezers and refrigerators should be 
easily accessible, operating properly and kept clean and organized.
Issuing
It may be necessary, particularly in larger operations, to limit storeroom access to specific 
personnel. Maintaining ongoing inventory records helps the ordering process. Controlling 
when products are issued or taken from storage to be used in the kitchen eliminates 
waste caused by multiple opened containers and ensures proper stock rotation.

Kitchen Procedures: Establishing Standard Portions
Standardizing portions is essential to controlling food costs. Unless portion quantity is 
uniform, it will be impossible to compute portion costs accurately. Portion discrepancies 
can also confuse or mislead customers. To determine if portion sizes are appropriate, 
chefs can check plates that have been cleared from the table. Large quantities of waste 
could suggest a serious and costly problem.
Actual portion sizes depend on the food service operation itself, the menu, the 
prices and the customers’ desires. Some items are generally purchased preportioned 
for convenience (e.g., steaks are sold in uniform cuts, baking potatoes are available in 
uniform sizes, butter comes in preportioned pats and sandwich bread comes sliced for 
service). Other items must be portioned by the establishment before service. Special 
equipment makes consistent portioning straightforward. There are machines to slice 
meats, cutting guides for cakes and pies and portion scales for weighing quantities. 
Standardized portion scoops and ladles are indispensable for serving vegetables, soups, 
stews, salads and similar foods. Many of these items are discussed and illustrated in 
Chapter 5, Tools and Equipment.
Once acceptable portion sizes are established, employees must be properly trained to 
prepare and present them. If each employee of a sandwich shop prepared sandwiches 
the way they would like to eat them, customers would probably never receive the same 
sandwich twice. Customers may become confused and decide not to risk a repeat visit. 
Obviously carelessness in portioning can also drastically affect food cost.
Kitchen Procedures: Managing Waste
The chef must control waste from overproduction or failure to use leftovers. With an 
adequate sales history, the chef can accurately estimate the quantity of food to prepare for 
each week, day or meal. An organized kitchen staff works from lists prepared by the head 
chef or station chefs, referred to as prep lists, stating the type and amount of each product 
to make. A well-planned prep list keeps workflow organized and waste to a minimum. 
The less waste generated in food preparation, the lower the overall food cost will be.
If the menu is designed properly, the chef can use leftovers and trim from product 
fabrication. When planning the menu, the chef should identify all trim and create uses 
for it before putting the menu into service. The chain muscle trimmed from beef tender￾loin, for example, can be used for kebabs. Food items should be purchased in the most 
efficient way. For example, whole chickens should not be purchased if the menu only 
features recipes that use boneless breasts. Unless other dishes using the legs and carcass 
are on the menu, boned chicken breasts should be purchased to reduce labor costs and 
waste. Anticipating uses for leftovers helps reduce waste. Leftover roast turkey from a 
holiday menu can be used on a turkey club sandwich at the next service. Including 
highly perishable items that have limited use on a menu or expensive garnishes such as 
edible flowers can also increase waste and overall costs.
Sales and Service
An improperly trained sales staff can undo even the most rigorous food cost controls. 
Front-of-the-house personnel are ultimately responsible for the sales portion of the food 
cost equation. Waiters and other sales staff must make sure that the business receives 
the correct amount of money as revenue. Prices charged must be accurate and complete. 
Waiters must record all orders correctly to ensure that everything served is paid for by 
the guest. Inattentive and impolite servers who provide poor service can lead to the need 
to “comp” (serve for free) food if customers are unhappy. Dropped or spilled foods do 
not generate revenues. Proper training is critical. The dining room manager and the chef 
should work together to educate servers about menu items and techniques for increasing 
sales and revenue. Waitstaff can help reduce food waste by reporting when customers 
leave food on their plates. Chefs should use the time before each service to introduce 
new menu items to the service staff. Regular tastings of new menu items and daily spe￾cials educate the dining room staff and build their enthusiasm.
Designing Menus to 
Prevent Food Waste
creative menu planning goes a long way 
toward reducing food waste.
▪ Limit the number of menu items to 
reduce the number of ingredients 
purchased and reduce spoilage.
▪ Offer dishes in different portion sizes 
such as appetizer or entrée portions to 
prevent wasteful leftovers.
▪ create a feedback loop between service 
and kitchen staff. Waitstaff should 
alert the kitchen when guests leave too 
much food on their plates or complain 
about food quality.
The nRa’s 86 Food Waste information 
services (available at www.restaurantkitchen.
org) provides these tips and more strategies 
to help support sustainability.
Front-of-the-house staff are responsible for 
sales and customer satisfaction.

WRITING RECIPES FOR PUBLICATION
Chefs are frequently called upon to craft recipes to share with the public and their 
customers. Unlike the standardized recipes used in a professional kitchen, recipes to 
share with the public, whether in print or for electronic publication on a website, have 
different conventions. Various publications use different formats for presenting recipes, 
depending on their own style and layout decisions, but the directions themselves—the 
actual recipe—should follow certain conventions. The goal with all recipe writing is to 
guide the user to produce a dish accurately, efficiently and consistently.
Elements of a Recipe Written for Publication
The primary parts of a recipe written for publication are its name, number of servings, a 
headnote, a list of ingredients and amounts and procedures. Each of these is described 
in the following material.
Name of the Recipe
Although some creativity is certainly permitted in naming a dish, be sure that the name 
is relevant and meaningful to potential users. “Chef’s Surprise” tells the reader nothing. 
“Uncle Dan’s Venison Sauce” may be slightly more meaningful but is still ambiguous. Is 
this a sauce made from venison or served with venison? Is the sauce spicy? Sweet? Fruity? 
Can it only be served on venison? And, unless the recipe is being written for family mem￾bers, “Uncle Dan” is irrelevant. In this case a title such as “Spicy Blackberry Sauce for 
Game” would be more informative and useful.
 Yield/Servings
Servings or yield, the term generally used in a professional context, refers to the total 
amount of the finished dish produced by the quantity of ingredients stated. This may be 
listed as “serves 8” or “makes 1 quart” or “one 9-inch pie.” Greater detail can be added 
by phrasing the yield as “36 4-oz. cookies” or “six 8-oz. servings.” Providing the total 
quantity produced by the recipe helps the reader know what to expect and clarifies the 
cooking experience.
Headnote
A headnote is an optional comment that explains the background or development of 
the dish. It could provide other information that might be nice to know but is not essen￾tial to preparing the recipe. Some publications require headnotes; others decline to use 
them entirely.
Ingredients
List ingredients in the order used. The quantity listed should be as specific as possible, 
with the exception of seasoning items, such as salt and pepper, which may be simply 
stated as “to taste.” The reason for listing an ingredient with a range of quantity (3–4 cups 
all-purpose flour) should be further explained in the recipe procedures. If the amount of 
flour needed to make a loaf of bread varies depending on the brand used, for example, 
explain this in the recipe instructions. If you are developing recipes for a food producer, 
be careful to list name-brand items accurately. Use standard measurement terms and 
abbreviations, as discussed on page 69 and shown throughout this text.
Procedures
Procedures provide step-by-step explanations for preparing, cooking and assembling 
the ingredients. List each step in the order in which it should be performed. Include 
as much detail as necessary to ensure that the reader understands what is to be done 
to obtain the desired results from each step. Procedures may offer more or less detail 
depending on your audience. Within your own restaurant kitchen, it may be sufficient 
to use culinary shorthand (e.g., sauté, deglaze and reduce au sec), but this professional 
M04_LABE1163_07_SE_C04.indd 85 31/10/23 7:16 PM86 cHapTeR FOuR
jargon would be inadequate in a recipe being published by your local newspaper. For a 
general audience, you might be more specific: “Sauté the minced shallots over medium 
heat for 5 to 6 minutes, until they are translucent and soft; add the wine and swirl to 
remove food particles from the pan. Reduce the heat and simmer until the wine is 
almost completely evaporated.” 
 Procedures should include times, temperatures and visual clues that the user can fol￾low. Offer as much information as necessary to make the reader feel comfortable and 
confident. Proofread written instructions carefully. Make sure that every ingredient listed 
is specifically used in the procedures and that every item mentioned in the procedures 
is listed with the ingredients. Double-check quantities and verify that they are stated 
clearly. Ensure that temperatures, cooking times and quantity produced are accurate. 
Does the recipe include enough detail to make the cooking experience a success, or will 
the new user end up frustrated and confused? 
 Other Considerations When Crafting a Recipe for Publication 
 When you think you have the written recipe finished, ask others to read and test the 
recipe in their own kitchens. Do they have any problems or questions? Is the final dish 
what they expected? Is it what you intended? Prepare the dish yourself, referring only 
to your written recipe, not your previous experience. Is the finished product what you 
intended? Did you encounter anything that needs to be changed? Do not assume that a 
newspaper, magazine or book publisher will test your recipe. In most cases, publications 
do not have the staff or the time to test and retest recipes. The obligation falls to you to 
produce a written recipe that is clear and accurate. 
 Finally a note about plagiarism : Don’t plagiarize. If you are submitting a recipe for 
publication or distributing it to your customers upon request and that recipe was derived 
from another source, say so and credit the original in writing on any printed or online 
materials you share as well. The maxim that changing three ingredients makes a recipe 
your own is false. While it is true that a recipe cannot be copyrighted, ethically you 
should acknowledge the original source, noting that the recipe “is adapted from so and 
so.” No one wants to see someone else taking credit for their hard work and creativity. 
 QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION 
1 describe the four types of menus. can each type of menu offer foods à la carte, semi à la 
carte and/or table d’hôte? explain your answer. 
2 chefs use standardized recipes to ensure that restaurants produce consistent results 
and that food costs are controlled. identify and explain the three features of a 
standardized recipe. 
3 explain how to convert the weight of an ingredient measured in ounces to grams. 
4 discuss three factors in food preparation that affect successful recipe yield or 
portion changes. 
5 a 25-pound bag of onions produces 22 pounds of edible weight after peeling and 
trimming. What is the yield percentage for the onions? 
6 calculate the recipe cost of the Mayonnaise recipe on page 752. Then calculate the selling 
price of the Turkey cheddar sandwich on page 80 using the cost of the mayonnaise you 
calculated and a food cost of 35%. 
7 List several factors, other than kitchen procedures, that a chef should examine when 
looking for ways to control food costs. 
8 describe the requirements when writing a recipe for publication. What must a chef 
consider when preparing a recipe to be used by home cooks?

 The proper tools and equipment for a particular task may mean the difference 
between a job well done and one done carelessly, incorrectly or even dangerously. 
­his chapter introduces the tools and equipment typically used in a professional 
kitchen. utems are divided into the following categories according to their functions: knives, 
hand tools (such as strainers and spatulas); measuring and portioning devices (such as scales 
and ladles); cookware (including materials used); strainers and sieves; processing equipment 
(such as mixers and blenders); heavy equipment (such as ovens and refrigerators); storage 
and buffet equipment and safety equipment and standards. ut concludes with notes on ways 
to conserve energy in the professional kitchen. 
 wide variety of specialized tools and equipment are available to today’s chef. For 
example, breading machines, croissant shapers and doughnut glazers are designed to speed 
 production by reducing handwork. Tther devices, such as a duck press or a couscoussier, are 
used only for unique tasks in preparing a few menu items. puch of this specialized equip￾ment is quite expensive and found only in food manufacturing operations or specialized 
kitchens; a discussion of it is beyond the scope of this chapter. Brief descriptions of some 
of these specialized devices are, however, found in the Glossary. Baking pans and tools are 
discussed briefly in Chapter  30 , irinciples of the Bakeshop.
 Before using any equipment, study the operator’s manual or have someone experienced 
with the particular item instruct you on proper procedures for its use and cleaning. nd 
remember, always put safety first. 
 KNIVES 
 Knives are the most important items in the chef’s tool kit. With a sharp knife, the 
skilled chef can accomplish a number of tasks more quickly and efficiently than any 
machine. Good-quality knives are expensive but will last for many years with proper 
care. Select easily sharpened, well-constructed knives that are comfortable and bal￾anced in your hand. Knife construction and commonly used knives are discussed 
here ; knife safety and care as well as cutting techniques are discussed in Chapter  6 , 
Knife Skills . 
 Knife Construction 
 A good knife begins with a single piece of metal, stamped, cut or—best of all—forged 
and tempered into a blade of the desired shape. The following metals are generally used 
for knife blades: 
Carbon steel: An alloy of carbon and iron, carbon steel is traditionally used for 
blades because it is soft enough to be sharpened easily. It corrodes and discolors 
easily, however, especially when used with acidic foods. 
Stainless steel: Stainless steel will not rust, corrode or discolor and is extremely dura￾ble. A stainless steel blade is much more difficult to sharpen than a carbon steel one, 
although once an edge is established on a stainless steel blade, it lasts longer than 
the edge on a carbon steel blade. 
High-carbon stainless steel: An alloy combining the best features of carbon steel and 
stainless steel, high-carbon stainless steel neither corrodes nor discolors and can be 
sharpened almost as easily as carbon steel. It is now the most frequently used metal 
for blades. 
 Manual or Electric 
Knife Sharpening? 
 ny knife, regardless of quality or price, is 
only as good as the sharpness of its blade. 
­he technique for sharpening knives with 
a whetstone is shown in Chapter  6 , Knife 
lskills. lectric sharpeners, although quick 
and easy to use, are not recommended 
for better quality knives. ­hese sharpeners 
lack versatility, and the sharpening wheels 
are impossible to observe in action. ­hey 
can easily remove too much of the blade, 
which shortens the knife’s life span. 
 lso, the angle of the wheels cannot be 
adjusted and many knives, particularly 
 sian-style knives, are only sharpened on 
one side, which cannot be done with an 
electric sharpener. When working with 
professional knives that should last a 
lifetime, steady and thorough wins out 
over quick and easy. 
M05_LABE1163_07_SE_C05.indd 88 31/10/23 7:18 PM­TTols and Equip a­ 89
Ceramic: A ceramic called zirconium oxide is now used to make knife blades that 
are extremely sharp, very easy to clean, rustproof and nonreactive. With proper 
care, ceramic blades will remain sharp for years, but when sharpening is needed, it 
must be done professionally on special diamond wheels. Although ceramic is highly 
durable, it does not have the flexibility of metal, so never use a ceramic knife to pry 
anything, to strike a hard surface (e.g., when crushing garlic or chopping through 
bones), to cut frozen food or to cut against a china or ceramic surface.
A portion of the blade, known as the tang, fits inside the handle, as shown in 
Figure  5.1. On most knives, pins or rivets hold the two sides of the handle to the 
tang. The best knives are constructed with a full tang running the length of the 
handle; they also have a bolster where the blade meets the handle (the bol￾ster is part of the blade, not a separate collar). Less expensive knives may have a 
¾-length tang or a thin “rattail” tang. Neither provides as much 
support, durability or balance as a full tang.
Knife handles are often made of hard woods infused with 
plastic and riveted to the tang. In contrast to wooden handles, 
molded polypropylene handles are permanently bonded to a 
tang without seams or rivets. Stainless steel handles welded 
directly to the blade are durable but very lightweight. Any han￾dle should be shaped for comfort and ground smooth to elimi￾nate crevices where bacteria can grow.
French or Chef ’s Knife
A French or chef’s knife is an all-purpose knife used for chop￾ping, slicing and mincing. Its rigid 8- to 14-inch (20- to 35-centimeter) 
blade is wide at the heel and tapers to a point at the tip.
Utility Knife
A utility knife is an all-purpose knife used for cutting fruits 
and vegetables and carving poultry. Its rigid 6- to 8-inch (15- to 
20-centimeter) blade is shaped like a chef’s knife but narrower.
Boning Knife
A boning knife is smaller with a thin blade used to separate meat 
from bone. The blade is usually 5–7 inches (12.5–17.5 centime￾ters) long and may be flexible or rigid.
Paring Knife
A paring knife is short and used for detail work or cutting 
fruits and vegetables. The rigid blade is from 2 to 4 inches (5 to 
10 centimeters) long. A bird’s-beak knife or tourné knife is 
similar to a paring knife but with a curved blade; it is used to 
cut curved surfaces or to turn vegetables.
Cleaver
A cleaver has a large, heavy rectangular blade used for chopping 
or cutting through bones.

Knife Shapes and Sharpening Equipment
Many knives have specialized functions not described here. This list includes only the 
most basic knives and sharpening equipment.
M05_LABE1163_07_SE_C05.indd 89 31/10/23 7:18 PM90 CH i­ R FuV 
 Butcher knife or scimitar 
 Slicer 
 A slicer has a long, thin blade used primarily for slicing cooked meat. The 
tip may be round or pointed, and the blade may be flexible or rigid. Because 
they are used for delicate slicing, slicers often have a granton edge with 
small indentations or dimples designed to prevent food from sticking to the 
blade. A similar knife with a serrated edge is used for slicing bread or pastry 
items. 
 Butcher Knife 
 Sometimes known as a scimitar because the rigid blade curves up in a 
25-degree angle at the tip, a butcher knife is used for fabricating raw 
meat and is available with 6- to 14-inch (15- to 35-centimeter) blades. 
 Oyster and Clam Knives 
 The short, rigid blades of oyster and clam knives are used to open oyster and 
clam shells. The tips are blunt; only the clam knife has a sharp edge. 
 Steel 
 A steel is a scored, slightly abrasive steel rod used to hone or straighten a blade 
immediately after and between sharpenings. 
 Sharpening Stone 
 Also known as a whetstone , a sharpening stone is a flat brick of synthetic 
abrasives that is used to put an edge on a dull blade. Various grit sizes are avail￾able. The most practical sets include both coarse- and fine-grit stones. 
 Japanese Knives 
 Specialized knives used in Japanese cooking are popular additions to a chef’s 
toolkit. Authentic Japanese knives are made from a very hard steel, so they are 
sharper than the European-style chef’s knife. This allows chefs to preform deli￾cate tasks with more precision. These knives also have an asymmetrical blade 
like a chisel, flat on one side and beveled to a sharp 15-degree edge on the 
other side, which facilitates precise cutting. 
 The usuba has a rectangular blade and is used to cut thin vegetable 
garnishes. The yanagiba has a thin 8- to 14-inch (20- to 35-centimeter) 
straight blade traditionally used to cut translucent slices of raw fish fillets 
for sashimi and sushi. The deba has a wide, sturdy 5- to 7-inch (12.5- to 
17.5- centimeter) wedge-shaped blade used for butchering and boning fish. 
The santoku resembles the deba in shape but it has a thinner symmetrical 
6- to 7-inch (15- to 17.5-centimeter) blade. This shape is popular with many 
knife manufacturers and is considered an all-purpose knife.

HAND TOOLS
Hand tools are designed to aid in cutting, shaping, moving or combining foods. They 
have few, if any, moving parts. Sturdiness, durability and safety are the watchwords 
when selecting hand tools. Choose tools, such as the ones illustrated here, that can with￾stand the heavy use of a professional kitchen and are easy to clean.

 MEASURING AND PORTIONING DEVICES 
 Ingredients must be measured precisely, especially in the bakeshop. Foods should also be 
measured when served to control portion size and cost. Most of the devices used to measure 
and portion foods are hand tools. These hand tools are designed to make food preparation 
and service easier and more precise. The accuracy they afford prevents costly mistakes. 
 Measurements may be based on weight (e.g., grams, ounces, pounds) or volume (e.g., 
teaspoons, cups, gallons). Therefore it is necessary to have available several measuring 
devices, including liquid and dry measuring cups and a variety of scales. Thermometers 
and timers are also measuring devices and are discussed here. When purchasing measur￾ing devices, look for quality construction and accurate markings. 
 Scales 
Scales measure the weight of an ingredient or a portion of food (e.g., the sliced meat 
for a sandwich). Portion scales feature a spring mechanism, round dial and single flat 
tray. They are available calibrated in grams, ounces or pounds. Electronic or digital 
scales also use a spring mechanism but provide digital readouts. Electronic scales are 
often required where foods are priced for sale by weight. An automatic tare feature 
conveniently allows the user to subtract the weight of the container used to hold loose 
ingredients on the scale. Balance scales (also known as baker’s scales) use a two-tray, 
free-weight counterbalance system. A balance scale allows more weight to be measured 
at one time because it is not limited by spring capacity. 
 To obtain an accurate reading, you must accurately use and maintain all scales. Never 
pick up a scale by its weighing platform, as this can damage the balancing mechanism. 
 Volume Measures 
 Use measuring spoons and measuring cups to measure the volume of ingredients. 
Measuring spoons sold as a set usually include ¼-teaspoon, ½-teaspoon, 1-teaspoon and 
1-tablespoon units (or the metric equivalent). Liquid measuring cups are available in 
capacities from 1 cup to 1 gallon. They have a lip or pour spout above the top line of 
measurement to prevent spills. Measuring cups for dry ingredients are usually sold in 
 tare weight of an empty container used when 
weighing an ingredient; feature on scale that 
automatically sets weight to zero 
M05_LABE1163_07_SE_C05.indd 92 31/10/23 7:18 PM­TTols and Equip a­ 93
sets of ¼-, ⅓-, ½- and 1-cup units. They do not have pour spouts, so the top of the cup is 
level with the top measurement specified. Glass measuring cups are not recommended 
because they can break. Avoid using bent or dented measuring cups, as the damage 
may distort the measurement capacity. 
 Ladles 
 Long-handled ladles are useful for portioning liquids such as stocks, sauces 
and soups. Ladle capacity, in ounces or milliliters, is stamped on the ladle 
handle. 
 Portion Scoops 
Portion scoops (also known as dishers) resemble ice cream scoops. They 
come in a range of standardized sizes and have a lever-operated blade for 
releasing their contents. Scoops are useful for portioning salads, vegetables, 
muffin batters or other soft foods. A number, stamped on either the handle or the 
release mechanism, indicates the number of level scoopfuls per quart. The higher the 
scoop number, the smaller the scoop’s capacity. (See Table  5. 1 .) 
 Thermometers 
 Various types of thermometers are used in the kitchen to check the temperature of 
foods and of equipment such as ovens, refrigerators and freezers. Stem-type thermom￾eters are inserted into foods to obtain temperature readings. Temperatures are shown 
on either a dial or a digital readout. An instant-read thermometer is a small st em-type 
model, designed to be carried in a pocket and used to provide quick temperature readings. 
An instant-read thermometer should not be left in foods that are cooking because doing 
so damages the thermometer. Sanitize the stem of any thermometer before use to avoid 
cross-contamination. 
 Candy and fat thermometers measure temperatures up to 400°F (204°C) using mer￾cury in a column of glass. A back clip attaches the thermometer to the pan, keeping the 
chef’s hands free. Be careful not to subject glass thermometers to quick temperature 
changes, as the glass may shatter. 
 Digital probe thermometers are reasonably priced and commonly used in food service 
facilities. These thermometers provide immediate, clear, digital readouts from a hand￾held unit attached to a metal probe (some are conveniently designed so that the probe 
is embedded in the tines of a long-handled fork or the bowl of a ladle). A detachable 
probe is especially useful inside an oven and for deep-frying and grilling. Digital probe

 How to Calibrate 
a Stem-Type 
Thermometer 
 ll stem-type thermometers should be 
calibrated at least weekly and whenever 
they are dropped. ­o calibrate a 
stem-type thermometer, fill a glass with 
shaved ice, then add water. ilace the 
thermometer in the ice slush and wait 
until the temperature reading stabilizes. 
Following the manufacturer’s directions, 
adjust the thermometer’s calibration nut 
until the temperature reads 32°F (0°C). 
Check the calibration by returning the 
thermometer to the slush. ­hen repeat 
the procedure, substituting boiling 
water for the ice slush, and calibrate the 
thermometer at 212°F (100°C).

thermometers with alarms are used when it is critical that steady temperatures be main￾tained (e.g., when smoking meats). 
Infrared thermometers employ infrared sensors with laser sightings to instantly 
monitor the surface temperature of foods during cooking or holding. They can also be 
useful to monitor the temperature of goods at receiving and in storage. These infrared 
thermometers allow staff to instantly monitor a wide range of temperatures without actu￾ally touching the food, thus avoiding any risk of cross-contamination. 
 Oven and refrigerator thermometers are also useful to ensure constant temperatures 
for holding and storing foods. Some thermometers are equipped with alarms to alert the 
user when the refrigerator temperature rises above levels that will ensure food safety. 
When choosing thermometers, select instruments with easy-to-read dials or clearly 
marked divisions on the column of mercury. 
 Timers 
 Portable kitchen timers are useful for any busy chef. Small digital timers can be carried in 
a pocket; some even time three functions at once. Select a timer with a loud alarm signal 
and long timing capability. 
 COOKWARE 
 Cookware includes the sauté pans and stockpots used on the stove top as well as the 
roasting pans, hotel pans and specialty molds used inside the oven. Select cookware for 
its size, shape, ability to conduct heat evenly and overall quality of construction. 
 Cookware Metals and Heat Conduction 
 Cookware that fails to distribute heat evenly may cause hot spots that burn foods. 
Because different metals conduct heat at different rates, and thicker layers of metal 
conduct heat more evenly than thinner layers, the most important considerations when 
choosing cookware are the type and thickness (known as the gauge ) of the material. No 
single cookware or material suits every process or need, however; always select the most 
appropriate material for the task at hand. 
 Copper 
 Copper is an excellent conductor: It heats rapidly and evenly and cools quickly. Unlined 
copper pots are unsurpassed for cooking sugar and fruit mixtures, but copper cookware 
is extremely expensive. It also requires a great deal of care and is often quite heavy. 
Because copper may react with some foods, traditional copper cookware usually has a 
tin lining, which is soft and easily scratched. Because of these problems, copper is now 
lined with stainless steel. Copper may also be sandwiched between layers of stainless 
steel or aluminum in the bottom of pots and pans to enhance their conductivity. 
 Aluminum 
 Aluminum is the metal used most commonly in commercial cookware. It is lightweight 
and, after copper, conducts heat best. Aluminum is a soft metal, though, so it should be 
treated with care to avoid dents. Do not use aluminum containers for storage or for cook￾ing acidic foods because aluminum reacts chemically with many foods. Light-colored 
foods, such as soups or sauces, may be discolored when cooked in aluminum, especially 
if stirred with a metal whisk or spoon. Anodized aluminum has a hard, dark, corrosion￾resistant surface that helps prevent sticking and discoloration. 
 Stainless Steel 
 Although stainless steel conducts and retains heat poorly, it is a hard, durable metal 
particularly useful for holding foods and for low-temperature cooking in which hot 
spots and scorching are not problems. Stainless steel pots and pans are available with 
 gauge the thickness of a material such as 
aluminum; the lower the gauge number, the 
thicker the material 
 ndigital infrared thermometer 
M05_LABE1163_07_SE_C05.indd 94 31/10/23 7:18 PM­TTols and Equip a­ 95
aluminum or copper bonded to the bottom or with an aluminum-layered core. Although 
expensive, such cookware combines the rapid, uniform heat conductivity of copper or 
aluminum with the strength, durability and nonreactivity of stainless steel. Stainless steel 
is also ideal for storage containers because it does not react with foods.
Cast Iron
Cast-iron cookware distributes heat evenly and holds high temperatures well. It is 
often used for griddles and large skillets. Although relatively inexpensive, cast iron is 
extremely heavy and brittle. It must be kept properly conditioned and dry to prevent rust 
and pitting.
Carbon Steel
A lighter weight cousin of cast iron, carbon steel is an alloy of iron and carbon that is an 
excellent conductor of heat. Because it heats rapidly, carbon steel is often used to make 
frying pans; such slope-sided pans are standard in France for sautéing and searing foods. 
Like cast iron, carbon steel must be kept conditioned and dry. But with proper season￾ing, carbon steel pans develop a nonstick surface.
Other Cookware Materials
Glass
Glass retains heat well but conducts it poorly. It does not react with foods. Tempered 
glass is suitable for microwave cooking provided it does not have any metal decoration. 
Commercial operations rarely use glass cookware because of the danger of breakage.
Ceramics
Ceramics, including earthenware, porcelain and stoneware, are used primarily for 
baking dishes, casseroles and baking stones, because they conduct heat uniformly 
and retain temperatures well. Ceramics are nonreactive, inexpensive and generally 
suitable for use in a microwave oven (provided there is no metal in the glaze). 
Ceramics are easily chipped or cracked, however, and should not be used over a 
direct flame. Also, quick temperature changes may cause ceramic cookware to crack 
or shatter.
Plastic
Plastic containers are frequently used in commercial kitchens for food storage or service, 
but they cannot be used for heating or cooking except in a microwave oven. Plastic 
microwave cookware is made of phenolic resin. It is easy to clean, relatively inexpensive 
and rigidly shaped, but its glasslike structure is brittle, and it can crack or shatter.
Enamelware
Pans lined with enamel should not be used for cooking; in many areas, their use in com￾mercial kitchens is prohibited by law. The enamel can chip or crack easily, providing 
good places for bacteria to grow. Also, the chemicals used to bond the enamel to the 
cookware can cause food poisoning if ingested.
Silicone
Silicone is a heat-resistant polymer (plastic) used to make flexible bakeware and 
kitchen tools. While it is a poor conductor of heat, this light material resists sticking 
and can withstand temperatures from freezing to 485°F (251°C). Baking pan lin￾ers made from silicone materials rarely require greasing and are useful for baking 
as well as making candy and chocolate work. Sheets of baking molds made from 
silicone are used to form individual cakes, petit fours and desserts, as well as ice 
cream and frozen desserts. Heat-resistant silicone spatulas and pot holders are also 
effective and popular. puffins baked in silicone molds

Nonstick Coatings
A polymer (plastic) known as polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), which is marketed under 
the trade names Teflon and Silverstone, is applied to many types of cookware. It does not 
affect a metal’s ability to conduct heat and it provides a slippery, nonreactive finish that 
prevents food from sticking and allows the use of less fat in cooking. (Newer nonstick 
coatings made from ceramic, silicone and titanium are also in use.) Cookware with non￾stick coatings requires a great deal of care, however, because the coatings can scratch, 
chip and blister. Do not use metal spoons or spatulas in cookware with nonstick coatings. 
To prevent the surface from deteriorating, do not use cookware with nonstick coatings 
over high heat. Such temperatures may cause the release of unhealthy or toxic vapors 
from the pans’ surface. Most cookware with nonstick coatings should be used below 
500°F (260°C). (Verify the temperature limits of your cookware with the manufacturer.)
Common Cookware
The most common cookware in the professional kitchen are the pots and pans used 
every day to cook and store foods. Shape, diameter and depth determine which pots or 
pans to choose for your cooking task.
Pots
Pots are large round vessels with straight sides and two loop handles. Available in a 
range of sizes based on volume, pots are used on the stove top for making stocks or 
soups, or for boiling or simmering foods, particularly when rapid evaporation is not 
desired. Flat or fitted lids are available.
Pans
Pans are round vessels with one long handle and straight or sloped sides. They are usually 
smaller and shallower than pots. Pans are available in a range of diameters and are used 
for general stove top cooking, especially sautéing, frying or reducing liquids rapidly.

Woks
Originally used to prepare Asian foods, woks are now found in many professional 
kitchens. Their round bottoms and curved sides diffuse heat and make it easy to toss or 
stir contents. Large domed lids retain heat for steaming vegetables. Woks are useful for 
quickly sautéing strips of meat, simmering a whole fish or deep-frying appetizers. Stove 
top woks range in diameter from 12 to 30 inches (30 to 75 centimeters); larger built-in 
gas or electric models are also available.
Hotel Pans
Hotel pans (also known as steam table pans) are rectangular stainless steel pans designed 
to hold food for service in steam tables. Hotel pans are also used for 
baking, roasting or poaching inside an oven. Perforated pans, 
which are useful for draining, steaming or icing down 
foods, are also available. The standard full-size hotel 
pan is 12 × 20 inches; pans one-half, one-third, one￾quarter, one-sixth and other fractions of this size are 
also available. Hotel pan depth is standardized at 2 inches 
(referred to as a “200 pan”), 4, 6 and 8 inches.
Molds
Molds of all shapes, sizes and materials are used to form foods for 
serving or as vessels in which foods will be served. Timbale molds
are small (about 4 ounces) metal or ceramic containers used for molding 
aspic or baking individual portions of mousse, custard or vegetables. Their slightly flared 
sides allow the contents to release cleanly when the mold is inverted. Small ceramic 
molds called ramekins (about 5–7 ounces) may be used for molding foods or for serv￾ing individual portions of mousse, custards and spreads. Molds used to form pâtés and 
terrines are discussed in Chapter 28, Charcuterie.
STRAINERS AND SIEVES
Strainers and sieves are used primarily to aerate and remove impurities from dry ingre￾dients and to drain or purée cooked foods. Strainers, colanders, drum sieves, china caps 
and chinois are each nonmechanical devices that have a stainless steel mesh or screen 
through which food passes. The size of the mesh or screen varies from extremely fine to 
several millimeters wide. Select the fineness best suited for the task at hand. Mechanical 
devices such as the food mill and flour sifter perform similar functions with the aid of a 
mechanical hand-crank.
Lead: From Roman Pots to Southern Stills
oead is poisonous. ungesting it can cause severe 
gastrointestinal pain, anemia and central 
nervous system disorders, including intelligence 
and memory deficits and behavioral changes.
­he unwitting and dangerous consumption 
of lead is not limited to children eating 
peeling paint chips. lsome historians suggest 
that the use of lead cookware and lead-lined 
storage vessels and water pipes may have 
caused pervasive lead poisoning among 
the elite of the Roman mpire and thus 
contributed to the empire’s decline. ­here 
is also ample evidence from ancient times 
until just a few hundred years ago that 
wine was heated in lead vessels to sweeten 
it. ­his had disastrous effects on drinkers 
and, for several centuries in countries 
throughout urope, on wine purveyors as 
well. ­he former could be poisoned, and 
the latter could be punished by death for 
selling adulterated wine. pore recently it was 
found that much of the moonshine whiskey 
produced in the merican lsouth contained 
lead in potentially toxic ranges. ­he source 
of the lead in moonshine was the lead solder 
used in homemade stills, some of which even 
included old repurposed lead-containing car 
radiators as condensers.
 lthough commercially available cookware 
does not contain lead, be careful of imported 
pottery and those lovely hand-thrown pots 
found at craft fairs—there may be lead in the 
glaze.

 Chinois and China Cap 
 Both the chinois and china cap are cone-shaped metal strainers. The conical shape 
allows liquids to filter through small openings. The body of a chinois is made from a 
very fine mesh screen. In contrast, a china cap has a perforated metal body. Both are 
used for straining stocks and sauces, with the chinois being particularly 
useful for consommé. A china cap can also be used with a pestle to 
purée soft foods. 
 Skimmer and Spider 
 Both the skimmer and spider are long-handled tools used to remove 
foods or impurities from liquids. The flat, perforated disk of a skimmer 
is used to skim stocks or remove foods from soups or stocks. The spider 
has a finer mesh disk, which makes it a better tool for retrieving items from 
hot fat. Wooden-handled spiders are available but are less sturdy and harder to 
clean than all-metal spiders. 
 Cheesecloth 
Cheesecloth is loosely woven cotton gauze used for straining stocks and sauces and 
wrapping poultry or fish for poaching. Cheesecloth is also indispensable for making 
sachets, packets of herbs and spices used to flavor soups, stocks and other liquids. 
Always rinse cheesecloth thoroughly before use; this removes lint and prevents the 
cheesecloth from absorbing other liquids. 
 Food Mill 
 A food mill purées and strains food at the same time. Food is placed in the hopper and 
a hand-crank mechanism turns a blade in the hopper against a perforated disk, forcing 
the food through the disk. Most models have interchangeable disks with various￾sized holes. Choose a mill that can be taken apart easily for cleaning.

 Flour Sifter 
 A sifter is used for aerating, blending and removing impurities from dry ingredients such 
as flour, cocoa and leavening agents. The 8-cup hand-crank sifter uses four curved rods 
to brush the contents through a curved mesh screen. Choose a sifter with a medium-fine 
screen and a comfortable handle. The French tamis is a drum-shaped sieve useful for 
sifting ingredients as well as for straining thick purées to remove lumps and seeds. 
 PROCESSING EQUIPMENT 
 Processing equipment includes both electrical and nonelectrical mechanical devices 
used to chop, purée, slice, grind or mix foods. Before using any such equipment, be 
sure to review its operating procedures and ask for assistance if necessary. All process￾ing equipment must be cleaned and sanitized after using. Always turn the equipment 
off and disconnect the power before disassembling, cleaning or moving the appliance. 
Report any problems or malfunctions immediately. Never place your hand into any 
machinery when the power is on. Processing equipment is powerful and can cause seri￾ous injury. 
 Slicer 
 An electric slicer cuts meat, bread, cheese or raw vegetables into uni￾form slices. It has a circular blade that rotates at high speed. Food is 
placed in a carrier, then passed (manually or by an electric motor) 
against the blade. Slice thickness is determined by the distance 
between the blade and the carrier. Because of the speed with 
which the blade rotates, foods can be cut into extremely thin slices 
very quickly. An electric slicer is convenient for preparing moder￾ate to large quantities of food, but the time required to disassemble and 
clean the equipment makes it impractical when slicing only a few items. 
 Mandoline 
 A mandoline is a manually operated slicer made of stainless steel with adjust￾able slicing blades. It is also used to make julienne and waffle-cut slices. Its 
narrow, rectangular body sits on the work counter at a 45-degree angle. Foods 
are passed against a blade to obtain uniform slices. It is useful for slicing small 
quantities of fruits or vegetables when using a large electric slicer would be 
unwarranted. To avoid injury, always use a hand guard or steel glove when 
using a mandoline. 
 Food Chopper or Buffalo Chopper 
 A food chopper is used to process moderate to large quantities of food to a 
uniform size, such as chopped onions or bread crumbs. The food is placed 
in a large bowl that rotates beneath a hood and curved blades chop the food 
in the bowl. The size of the cut depends on how long the food is left in the 
machine. Buffalo (food) choppers are available in floor or tabletop models. 
The motor of the chopper can usually be fitted with a variety of other tools 
such as a meat grinder or a slicer/shredder. 
 Food Processor 
 A food processor has a motor housing with a remov￾able bowl and S-shaped blade. It is used for many tasks, 
including puréeing cooked foods, chopping nuts, prepar￾ing compound butters and emulsifying sauces. Special 
disks can be added that slice, shred or julienne foods. 
Bowl capacity and motor power vary; select a model large 
enough for your most common tasks. 
M05_LABE1163_07_SE_C05.indd 99 31/10/23 7:18 PM100 CH i­ R FuV 
 Blender 
 Though similar in principle to a food processor, a blender has a tall, narrow food 
container and a four-pronged blade. Its design and whirlpool action are optimal for 
 processing liquids or liquefying foods quickly. A blender is used to prepare smooth 
drinks, purée soups and sauces, blend batters and chop ice. A vertical cutter/mixer 
(VCM) operates like a very large, powerful blender. A VCM is usually floor-mounted and 
has a capacity of 15–80 quarts (14–75 liters). 
 Immersion Blender 
 An immersion blender— like its household counterpart the hand blender or wand—
is a long shaft fitted with a rotating four-pronged blade at the bottom. An immersion 
blender is used to purée a soft food, soup or sauce directly in the container in which it 
was prepared, eliminating the need to transfer the food from the cooking container 
to a blender or food processor. This is especially useful when working with hot 
foods. Small cordless, rechargeable immersion blenders are convenient for 
puréeing or mixing small quantities or beverages, but larger heavy-duty 
electric models are more practical in commercial kitchens. 
 Mixer 
 A vertical mixer is indispensable in the bakeshop and most kitchens. The U-shaped arms 
hold a metal mixing bowl in place; the selected mixing attachment fits onto the rotating 
head. The three common mixing attachments are the whip (used for whipping eggs or 
cream), the paddle (used for general mixing) and the dough hook (used for kneading 
bread). Most mixers have several operating speeds. Bench or stand models range in capac￾ity from 4.5 to 20 quarts (3 to 20 liters), whereas floor mixers can hold 140 quarts (144 
liters) or more. To prevent injuries, larger mixers are fitted with a moveable metal or plastic 
safety guard that protects hands, clothing and other objects from coming into contact 
with the rotating head and mixer attachments. Some mixers can be fitted with shredder/
slicers, meat grinders, juicers or power strainers, making the equipment more versatile. 
 Juicer 
 Two types of juicers are available: reamers and extractors. Reamers , also known as citrus 
juicers, remove juice from citrus fruits. They can be manual or electric. Manual models use 
a lever arm to squeeze the fruit with greater pressure. They are most often used to prepare 
small to moderate amounts of juice for cooking or beverages. Juice extractors are electri￾cal devices that create juice by liquefying raw fruits, vegetables and herbs. Centrifugal 
extractors use centrifugal force to filter out fiber and pulp. Masticating juicers are a type 
of juice extractor that crushes then presses the fruits and vegetables to extract juice.

 Mortar and Pestle 
 One of the oldest and most widely used processing tools is the mortar and pestle. The 
mortar is a bowl-shaped vessel in which ingredients can be pulverized, ground, mashed 
or blended by hand with a club-shaped pestle . Herbs and spices, sauces such as gua￾camole and even meats can be prepared this way. The mortar and the pestle are usually 
made from the same material, although that material varies depending on the culture and 
geographic region. Marble, granite, volcanic stone, hardwood and ceramic mortar and 
pestles are available in a variety of sizes. 
 Butane Torch 
 Some foods such as caramel custard (page 1095) are often finished 
for service by browning using a handheld butane or propane fuel torch . 
These handheld torches use disposable fuel canisters and can also be used 
to quickly brown meringue or other food items. 
 Whipping Siphon 
 A whipping siphon is designed to aerate and dispense hot or cold 
liquids. It is composed of an insulated canister and a tight-fitting lid 
with a cartridge or charger of nitrous oxide gas. Once discharged into 
the canister, the gas dissolves into the liquid, creating pressure. When dispensed, the 
gas turns into air bubbles creating a foam. Siphons are used to whip cream to order for 
topping desserts or coffee, as well as creating foams from savory sauces or other liquids 
that are thick enough to hold air bubbles. 
 HEAVY EQUIPMENT 
 Heavy equipment includes the gas-, electric- or steam-operated appliances used for 
cooking, reheating or holding foods. It also includes dishwashers and refrigeration units. 
These items are usually installed in a fixed location determined by the kitchen’s traffic 
flow and space limitations. 
 Heavy equipment may be purchased or leased new or used. Used equipment is most 
often purchased in an effort to save money. Although the initial cost is generally less for used 
equipment, the buyer should also consider the lack of a manufacturer’s warranty or dealer￾ship guarantee and how the equipment was maintained by the prior owner. Functional used 
equipment is satisfactory for back-of-the-house areas, but it is usually better to purchase new 
equipment if it will be visible to the customer. Leasing equipment may be appropriate for 
some operations. The cost of leasing is less than purchasing, and if something goes wrong 
with the equipment, the operator is generally not responsible for repairs or service charges. 
 Stove Tops 
 Stove tops or ranges are often the most important cooking equipment in the kitchen. They 
have one or more burners powered by gas or electricity. The burners may be open or 
covered with a cast-iron or steel plate. Open burners supply quick, direct heat that is easy 
to regulate. A steel plate, known as a flat top , supplies even 
heat that is less intense. Although it takes longer to heat 
than a burner, the flat top supports heavier weights and 
makes a larger area available for cooking. Many stoves 
include both flat tops and open burner arrangements. 
Griddles are similar to flat tops except they are 
made of a thinner metal plate. Foods are usually 
cooked directly on the griddle’s surface, not in pots 
or pans, which can nick or scratch the surface. The griddle 
surface should be properly cleaned and conditioned after each use. 
Griddles are popular for short-order and fast-food-type operations. 
M05_LABE1163_07_SE_C05.indd 101 31/10/23 7:18 PM102 CH i­ R FuV 
Induction cooktops use special conductive coils, called inductors, that are below 
the stove top’s surface, in combination with flat-bottomed cookware made of cast iron 
or magnetic stainless steel. The coil generates a magnetic current so that the cookware 
is heated rapidly with magnetic friction. Heat energy is then transferred from the cook￾ware to the food by conduction. The cooking surface, which is made of a solid ceramic 
material, remains cool. Only the cookware and its contents get hot. Induction systems 
are extremely energy efficient and easy to clean. They feature instant response time 
because power is directed into the cooking utensil, not the surrounding air. 
 Portable induction burners are useful on buffets because they maintain a safer, 
cooler cooking environment and in the bakeshop, where there may be less need for 
direct-heat cooking. 
 Ovens 
 An oven is an enclosed space where food is cooked by being surrounded with hot, dry 
air. Conventional ovens are often located beneath the stove top. There is a heating ele￾ment at the unit’s bottom or floor, and pans are placed on adjustable wire racks inside 
the oven. (See Figure  5. 2 .) Conventional ovens may also be separate, freestanding units 
or decks stacked one on top of the other. In stack ovens , pans are placed directly on 
the deck or floor, not on wire racks. 
Convection ovens use internal fans to circulate the hot air. This tends to cook 
foods more quickly and evenly. Convection ovens, which are used in most com￾mercial kitchens, are almost always freestanding units, powered by either gas or 
electricity. Because convection ovens cook foods more quickly, temperatures may 
need to be reduced by 25–50°F (10–20°C) from those recommended for conven￾tional ovens. 
Combination or combi ovens combine steam and convection fans into one device. 
Such ovens perform several functions; they bake, poach, roast and steam. Programmable 
electronic controls precisely regulate oven temperatures. Foods such as bread can be 
baked with steam to develop a crisp crust. Roasts can be cooked in the oven then auto￾matically held at lower temperatures for service. 
 When preparing dishes from the Indian sub-continent and central Asia, a tandoor 
oven is commonly used. A tandoor is an ancient style of clay oven with a cylindrical, 
vertical shape and a circular opening at the top. Heat from the bottom reflects off the

curved sides so that the interior retains temperatures near 900°F (480°C). Meats, fish and 
vegetables are typically threaded on long skewers and lowered into the oven to roast 
while the inside wall is used to quickly bake flatbreads such as naan. Breads are slapped 
against the oven wall, to which the dough sticks while baking. Foods cooked in a tan￾door will have a flavorful charred surface but remain juicy and tender because of the 
extreme temperatures.
Wood-Burning Ovens
The ancient practice of baking in a retained-heat masonry oven has been revived in 
recent years, with many upscale restaurants and artisan bakeries installing adobe or 
brick ovens for baking pizzas and breads as well as for roasting fish, poultry and veg￾etables. These ovens have a curved interior chamber that is usually recessed into a wall. 
Although gas-fired models are available, wood-firing is more traditional and provides the 
aromas and flavors associated with brick ovens. A wood fire is built inside the oven to 
heat the brick chamber. The ashes are then swept out and the food is placed on the flat 
oven floor. Breads and pizzas baked in direct contact with the hot masonry rise better 
than in a conventional oven and develop a unique crisp crust. The combination of high 
heat and wood smoke adds distinctive flavors to foods.
Microwave Ovens
Microwave ovens are electrically powered ovens used to cook or reheat foods. They 
are available in a range of sizes and power settings. A microwave oven will not brown 
foods unless the oven is fitted with a special browning element. Microwave cooking is 
discussed in more detail in Chapter 10, Principles of Cooking.
Broilers and Grills
Broilers and grills are generally used to prepare meats, fish and poultry. In a grill, the 
heat source is beneath the rack on which the food is placed. In a broiler, the heat source 
is above the food. Most broilers are gas powered; grills may be gas or electric powered 
or may burn wood or charcoal. A salamander is a small overhead broiler primarily used 
to finish or top-brown foods. (See Figure 5.2.) A rotisserie is similar to a broiler except 
that the food is placed on a revolving spit in front of the heat source. The unit may be 
open or enclosed like an oven; it is most often used for cooking poultry or meats. An 
enclosed rotisserie with a solid door is generally more energy efficient to operate than 
its open counterpart.

Steam Tables
Steam tables are large counter-height tables where foods are kept hot at food safe 
temperatures. Hotel pans or other containers are set into a frame suspended over the 
heat source, which may be circulating steam or hot water. Steam tables ease the flow 
of meals from the kitchen to the guest. Hot soups, sauces and other moist foods are 
ready to be served at any time. Cafeterias and buffet restaurants are dependent on the 
use steam tables.
Tilting Skillets
Tilting skillets are large, freestanding, flat-bottomed 
pans about 6 inches (15 centimeters) deep with an 
internal heating element below the pan’s bottom. 
They are usually made of stainless steel with a cover 
and have a hand-crank mechanism that turns or tilts 
the pan to pour out the contents. Tilting skillets can 
be used as stockpots, braziers, fry pans, griddles or 
steam tables, making them one of the most versa￾tile of commercial appliances.
Steam Kettles
Steam kettles (also known as steam-jacketed 
kettles) are similar to stockpots except they are 
heated from the bottom and sides by steam circu￾lating between layers of stainless steel. The steam 
may be generated internally or from an outside 
source. Because steam heats the kettle’s sides, 
foods cook more quickly and evenly than they 
would in a pot sitting on the stove top. Steam kettles 
are most often used for making sauces, soups, custards and stocks in large quantities. 
Steam kettles are available in a range of sizes, from a 2-gallon (8-liter) tabletop model to a 
150-gallon (575-liter) floor model. Some models have a tilting mechanism that allows the 
contents to be poured out; others have a spigot near the bottom through which 
liquids can be drained.
Steamers
Pressure and convection steamers cook foods rapidly and evenly, using direct contact 
with steam. Pressure steamers heat water above the boiling point in sealed compart￾ments; the high temperature and sealed compartment increase the internal pressure in a 
range of 4–15 pounds per square inch. The increased pressure and temperature cook the 
foods rapidly. Convection steamers generate steam in an internal boiler, then release 
it over the foods in a cooking chamber. 
Both types of steamers are ideal for cook￾ing vegetables with minimal loss of flavor 
or nutrients.
Thermal Circulator
A thermal circulator is attached to a 
vessel of water, where pouched foods 
are cooked in a warm circulating water 
bath. The heating element and tempera￾ture controls on the circulator maintain 
the precise and constant temperatures 
required for sous vide cooking (see page 
349). A pump ensures that the heated 
water circulates continuously.

Deep-Fat Fryers
Deep-fat fryers cook foods in a large amount of hot fat. Fryers are sized by the 
amount of fat they hold. Most commercial fryers range between 15 and 82 pounds. 
Fryers can be either gas or electric and are thermostatically controlled for tempera￾tures between 200°F and 400°F (90°C and 200°C).
When choosing a fryer, look for a fry tank with curved, easy-to-clean sloping sides. 
Some fryers have a cold zone (an area of reduced temperature) at the bottom of the 
fry tank to trap particles. This prevents particles from burning, creating off-flavors and 
shortening the life of the fryer fat.
Deep-fryers use wire baskets to hold the food during cooking. Fryer baskets are 
lowered and raised manually or with automatic basket mechanisms. The most important 
 factor when choosing a deep-fryer is recovery time. Recovery time is the length of time 
it takes the fat to return to the desired cooking temperature after food is submerged. 
When food is submerged, heat is immediately transferred to the food from the fat, which 
lowers the fat’s temperature. The more food added at one time, the greater the drop 
in the fat’s temperature. Recovery time is important because if the temperature drops 
too much or does not return quickly to the proper cooking temperature, the food may 
absorb excess fat and become greasy.
Heat Lamps
Keeping foods hot between preparation and service requires special considerations. 
Steam tables, discussed above, are excellent for keeping bulk foods at the proper tem￾perature, but heat lamps are better for keeping plated foods warm. Heat lamps are also 
useful for maintaining the temperature of pizza or fried foods, which may become soggy 
if held in a steam table. Roast beef, turkey, ham and other large cuts of meat are some￾times carved on a buffet in front of guests. Heat lamps help maintain the temperature of 
these items for catered events or banquets.
Refrigerators and Freezers
Proper refrigeration space is an essential component of any kitchen. Many foods must be 
stored at low temperatures to maintain quality and safety. Most commercial refrigeration 
is either walk-in units or reach-in units.
A walk-in is a large, room-sized box capable of holding hundreds of pounds of food 
on adjustable shelves. A separate freezer walk-in may be positioned nearby or even 
inside a refrigerated walk-in.
Reach-ins may be individual units or parts of a bank of units, each with shelves 
approximately the size of a full sheet pan. Reach-in refrigerators and freezers are usu￾ally located throughout the kitchen to provide quick access to foods especially beneath 
work counters. Freezers and refrigerators are available in a wide range of sizes and door 
designs to suit any operation.
Other forms of commercial refrigeration include chilled drawers, which are located 
beneath a work area and are just large enough to accommodate a hotel pan, and display 
cases used to show foods to the customer. Blast chillers and blast freezers rapidly 
and uniformly reduce the temperature of foods below 40°F (4°C) by circulating cold air 
at high speeds. Also called shock chillers, these devices are important tools in produc￾tion kitchens where HACCP programs (see Chapter 2, Food Safety and Sanitation) are 
used to ensure food safety.
Dishwashers
Mechanical dishwashers wash, rinse and sanitize dishware, glassware, cookware 
and utensils. Small models clean one rack of items at a time. Larger models can 
handle several racks simultaneously on a conveyor belt. Sanitation is accomplished 
either with extremely hot water (180°F/82°C) or with chemicals automatically 
dispensed during the final rinse cycle. Any dishwashing area should be carefully 
organized for efficient use of equipment and employees and to prevent recontami￾nating clean items.
Specialized Equipment 
for High-Tech Cuisine
iroponents of the modernist cuisine 
movement incorporate tools more 
commonly found in a chemistry lab to 
produce refined foods. mong such tools 
are microscopically fine heat-resistant 
filters. With perforations a mere 
100 microns (0.004 inch) thick, these 
filters can be used for clarifying stock and 
making clear colorless consommé. ­he 
vacuum rotary evaporator, a costly lab 
instrument used to distill mixtures, has 
been adapted for kitchen use to reduce 
liquids without applying heat and to 
impregnate foods with flavors. nother 
device inspired by the science lab is the 
anti-griddle, which resembles a flat top 
on which food is frozen, not heated. ­he 
surface of the anti-griddle, chilled to 
−30°F (−34°C), “sears” food with cold. 
Hot purées and liquids can be sealed on 
the outside by freezing, yet still be warm 
or liquid inside.

Racks
Rolling racks are metal frames designed to hold a number of sheet trays in a space-saving 
manner. They are useful for storing trays of items waiting to be placed in the oven or for 
receiving hot pans directly from an oven.
STORAGE AND BUFFET EQUIPMENT
Proper storage systems and containers keep leftovers and opened packages of food 
safe for consumption. Food service operations that prepare buffets or cater off-premises 
events need a variety of specialized storage and hot and cold holding equipment to 
ensure that food is handled safely and efficiently and displayed appropriately.
Storage Equipment
Proper storage can reduce the costs incurred by waste or spoilage. Although stainless 
steel pans such as hotel pans are suitable and useful for some items, the expense of 
stainless steel and the lack of airtight lids makes these pans impractical for general 
storage purposes. Aluminum containers are not recommended because the metal 
can react with even mildly acidic items such as cut citrus fruits or salad dressing 
made with vinegar. Glass containers are generally not allowed in commercial kitch￾ens because of the hazards of broken glass. The most useful storage containers are 
those made of high-density plastic such as polyethylene and 
polypropylene.
Storage containers must have well-fitting lids and an 
operation must have a variety of sizes, including some that are 
small enough to hold even minimal quantities of food with￾out allowing too much exposure to oxygen. Round and square 
plastic containers are widely available. Flat, snap-on lids allow 
containers to be stacked for more efficient storage. Containers 
may be clear or opaque white, which helps protect light-sensitive 
foods. Larger containers may be fitted with handles and spigots, 
making them especially suited for storing stock. Some storage 
containers are marked with graduated measurements so that 
content quantity can be determined at a glance.
Large quantities of dry ingredients, such as flour and 
rice, can be stored in rolling bins. The bins should be seamless with rounded cor￾ners for easy cleaning. They should have well-fitting easy-to-open lids and should 
move easily on well-balanced casters.
The chamber vacuum machine allows solids and liquids to be packaged in 
 food-grade polyethylene bags without oxygen. The packaging seals in flavor and 
prevents spoilage. Vacuum sealing is useful for frozen storage of various leftovers and 
for storing small quantities of dry ingredients, such as beans and grains, conveniently. 
This type of packaging also keeps water from touching the food during moist-heat 
cooking and is used for specialized cooking processes discussed in Chapter  10, 
Principles of Cooking.
Buffet Equipment
Although many of these items can be rented, operations that regularly serve buffets may 
prefer to invest in their own transportation and serving equipment. Proper temperatures 
must be maintained during transportation, display and service.
Insulated carriers hold food at its current temperature for a time. They are 
designed to hold hotel pans or sheet pans and are available with wheels for easy 
movement. Some are available with a spigot for serving hot or cold beverages. Any 
carrier should be easy to clean and of a convenient size for the space available and the 
type of operation.
M05_LABE1163_07_SE_C05.indd 106 31/10/23 7:18 PM­TTols and Equip a­ 107
 Temperature remains a concern when arranging food on a buffet table. Chafing 
dishes are commonly used for keeping hot foods hot during service. In chafing dishes 
cans of solid fuel are placed under a deep hotel pan of hot water. Like a double boiler 
or bain marie , the hot water helps maintain the temperature of food placed in a sec￾ond hotel pan suspended over the first. Chafing dishes should never be used to heat 
food—only to maintain the temperature of already heated foods. Chafing dishes are 
available in several sizes and shapes, but the most convenient are those based on the 
size of a standard hotel pan. Round, deep chafing dishes are useful for serving soups 
or sauces. Exteriors can be plain or ornate and made of silver, copper or stainless steel. 
 SAFETY EQUIPMENT AND STANDARDS 
 Safety devices, many of which are required by federal, state or local law, are critical to 
the well-being of a food service operation although they are not used in food prepara￾tion. Failing to include safety equipment in a kitchen or failing to maintain it properly 
endangers workers and customers. All professional kitchen equipment is subjected to 
industry standards that ensure food and worker safety. 
 Safety Equipment 
 Because professional kitchens are full of hazards—sharp knives, hot equipment, scalding 
steam and grease that could easily injure—a great deal of attention is paid to ensuring 
the safety of workers and patrons. Equipment such as fire extinguishers, ventilation sys￾tems and protective gear help protect staff as does using equipment designed to meet 
the standards of a busy foodservice kitchen. 
 Fire Extinguishers 
 Fire extinguishers are canisters of foam, dry chemicals (such as sodium bicarbonate or 
potassium bicarbonate) or pressurized water used to extinguish small fires. They must 
be placed within sight of and easily reached from the work areas. Different classes of 
extinguishers use different chemicals to fight different types of fires. (See Table  5. 2 .) 
The appropriate class must be used for the specific fire type. Fire extinguishers must be

recharged and checked from time to time to ensure that they have not been discharged, 
tampered with or otherwise damaged.
Remember the acronym PASS for the four steps to follow when using any fire extinguisher:
Pull the safety pin on the extinguisher.
Aim the extinguisher hose at the base of the fire.
Squeeze the handle to discharge the material.
Sweep the hose from side to side across the base of the fire.
Ventilation Systems
Ventilation systems (also called ventilation hoods) are commonly installed over cooking 
equipment to remove vapors, heat and smoke. Some systems include fire extinguishing 
agents or sprinklers. A properly operating hood makes the kitchen more comfortable for 
the staff and reduces the danger of fire. The system should be designed, installed and 
inspected by professionals, then cleaned and maintained regularly.
First Aid Kits
First aid supplies should be stored in a clearly marked box, conspicuously located 
near food preparation areas. State and local laws may specify the kit’s exact contents. 
Generally they should include a first aid manual, bandages, gauze dressings, adhesive 
tape, antiseptics, scissors, cold packs and other supplies. The kit should be checked reg￾ularly and items replaced as needed. Cards with emergency telephone numbers should 
be placed inside the first aid kit and near a telephone.
Protective Gear
All kitchens should be equipped with high quality heat-resistant gloves or pot 
holders to be used when handling hot pans and other equipment. In kitchens 
where a large quantity of shellfish is opened or a meat slicer is used, steel-mesh 
safety gloves may be required. Made from stainless steel woven into a fine fiber, 
these gloves recall medieval armor and are effective at preventing puncture or 
slicing wounds.
Standards for Tools and Equipment
NSF International (NSF), previously known as the National Sanitation Foundation, pro￾motes and oversees consensus standards for the design, construction and installation of 
kitchen tools, cookware and equipment. Many states and municipalities require that food 
service operations use only NSF-certified equipment. Although NSF certification is volun￾tary, most manufacturers submit their designs to NSF for certification to show that they 
are suitable for use in professional food service operations. Certified equipment bears 
the NSF mark shown in Figure 5.3.
NSF standards reflect the following requirements:
1 Equipment must be easily cleaned.
2 All food contact surfaces must be nontoxic (under intended end-use conditions), 
nonabsorbent, corrosion resistant and nonreactive.
3 All food contact surfaces must be smooth (i.e., free of pits, cracks, crevices, 
ledges, rivet heads and bolts).
4 Internal corners and edges must be rounded and smooth; external corners and 
angles must be smooth and sealed.
5 Coating materials must be nontoxic and easily cleaned; coatings must resist 
chipping and cracking.

M05_LABE1163_07_SE_C05.indd 108 31/10/23 7:18 PM­TTols and Equip a­ 109
In general only commercial food service tools and equipment should be used in a 
professional kitchen. Look for tools that are well constructed. For example, joints should 
be welded, not bonded with solder; handles should be comfortable, with rounded bor￾ders; plastic and rubber parts should be seamless.
Before purchasing or leasing any equipment, you should ask the following questions:
1 Is this equipment necessary for producing menu items?
2 Will this equipment perform the job required in the space available?
3 Is this equipment the most economical for the operation’s specific needs?
4 Is this equipment easy to clean, maintain and repair?
5 Does the equipment operate efficiently and meet energy conservation standards?
CONSERVING ENERGY 
IN THE PROFESSIONAL KITCHEN
The kitchen is the heart of a food service operation. It also consumes an enormous 
amount of natural resources, including water, electricity, natural gas and propane. In one 
year, a single electric deep-fat fryer uses more kilowatts of electricity than the average 
U.S. home. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s ENERGY STAR®
Guide for Cafés, Restaurants, and Institutional Kitchens, 59 percent of the energy used 
in a food service operation comes from the kitchen: food preparation (35 percent), sani￾tation (18 percent), lighting (13 percent) and refrigeration (6 percent).
Energy conservation is of concern to food service operators because of the mon￾etary and environmental costs associated with wasteful practices. Although purchasing 
 energy-efficient equipment may be beyond your immediate responsibility, there are 
many things you can do to help conserve energy, including the following:
	▪ Keep ovens, refrigerators, dishwashers, ice machines, exhaust vents and other 
equipment clean and maintained.
	▪ Observe good water use practices. Thaw frozen food in the refrigerator instead of 
under running water. Repair leaky faucets and dishwashing equipment. Soak dirty 
cookware and dishes before washing under clean running water. Offer water to 
guests only when asked.
	▪ Preheat equipment only when necessary. Preheat ovens only long enough to 
reach the required temperature before they are needed.
	▪ To reduce heat loss during operation, open ovens only when needed. Reduce 
time when ovens are idle; turn off backup ovens when not in use.
	▪ Turn off gas burners when not in use.
	▪ Open freezer and refrigerator doors as infrequently as possible and ensure that 
these doors are tightly shut when not in use. Keep condenser coils clean.
	▪ Turn off interior oven lights when not needed.
	▪ Turn off exhaust hoods and kitchen fans as soon as it is safe to do so at the end 
of service.
	▪ Select the proper size and type of pot or pan for the task. A small pan placed 
over a large burner wastes gas. Select cookware that heats efficiently.
	▪ Select the right kind of cooking device for the job. Review your menu to 
determine whether the most efficient cooking methods are being used. Cooking 
over open burners for example may be more efficient than using a flat top griddle, 
which takes longer to heat. Induction cooktops use less energy than gas ranges.
	▪ Report maintenance problems when you see them. Leaking sinks and 
dishwashers, dripping faucets, and torn gaskets on refrigerators and ice machines 
waste water and energy.
	▪ Review energy conservation practices with your team.

Knife Skills 6
M06_LABE1163_07_SE_C06.indd 111 28/10/23 2:03 PM112
 After studying this chapter, 
you will be able to: 
6. 1 use knives safely 
6. 2 care for and sharpen knives properly 
6. 3 grip your knife 
6. 4 control your knife 
6. 5 use your knife while cutting foods into a 
variety of classic shapes 
6. 6 use specialized cutting tools 
 Because the knife is the most commonly used tool in the kitchen, good knife skills 
are critical to a chef ’s success. every chef spends countless hours slicing, dicing, 
mincing and chopping. learning to perform these tasks safely and efficiently is an 
essential part of a chef ’s training. 
 At first, professional knives may feel large and awkward and the techniques discussed in this 
chapter may not seem efficient. Some techniques help make precise cutting easier. Others help 
stabilize awkwardly shaped food items to help you cut efficiently. As you become familiar with 
knives and practice your knife skills, using knives correctly will become second nature. 
Knives are identified in Chapter  5 , Tools and equipment. Here we show how knives are 
used to cut vegetables. The techniques presented, however, can be used for almost any food 
that, like vegetables, holds their shape when cut. Knife skills for butchering and fabricating
meat, poultry, fish and shellfish are discussed in Chapter  13 , Principles of Meat Cookery, 
through Chapter  20 , fish and Shellfish.
 USING KNIVES SAFELY 
 The first rule of knife safety is to be mindful and focus on what you are doing. Other 
basic rules of knife safety are as follows: 
▪ Use the correct knife for the task at hand. 
▪ Always cut away from yourself. 
▪ Always cut on a cutting board. Do not cut on glass, marble or metal. 
▪ Place a damp towel underneath the cutting board to keep it from sliding as you cut. 
▪ Keep knives sharp; a dull knife is more dangerous than a sharp one. 
▪ When carrying a knife, hold it point down, parallel and close to your leg as you walk. 
▪ A falling knife has no handle. Do not attempt to catch a falling knife; step back 
and allow it to fall. 
▪ Never leave a knife in a sink of water; anyone reaching into the sink could be 
injured or the knife could be dented by pots or other utensils. 
 CARING FOR AND SHARPENING YOUR KNIVES 
 With proper care and storage, your professional knives will last 
many years. Proper sanitation of knives is essential to prevent cross￾contamination. Always sanitize, rinse and dry knives by hand immediately 
after each use. Do not wash knives in commercial dishwashers. The 
heat and harsh chemicals can damage the edge and the handle. 
 To prevent dulling, store knives so that their blades never touch 
other knives or tools. Slotted knife holders or magnetized strips can 
be wall-mounted near workstations. Portable knife kits, made from 
flexible washable material, are designed to hold each knife in an indi￾vidual protective sleeve. 
 A sharp knife cuts smoothly. When a knife is sharp, its edge is in align￾ment. The constant force of cutting with your knife causes its fine sharp 
edge to dull. On a microscopic level, the edge comes out of alignment, 
wears and bends. A sharpening stone called a whetstone is used to put 
an edge on a dull knife blade. During this process you are grinding min￾ute amounts of metal from the blade of your knife, one side at a time. 
 To use a whetstone, place the heel of the blade against the whetstone at a 15- to 
20-degree angle. (See Figure  6. 1 .) Maintaining this angle throughout the sharpening pro￾cess is key. With your fingers on top of the blade, press down on the blade while pushing 
 fabricate to cut a larger portion of raw meat 
(e.g., a primal or subprimal), poultry or fish 
into smaller portions

it away from you in one long arc, as if to slice off a thin piece of the stone. The entire 
length of the blade should come in contact with the stone during each sweep. Repeat the 
procedure on both sides of the blade until it is sufficiently sharp. With a triple-faced whet￾stone, such as the one shown in the nearby photo, progress from the coarsest to the finest 
surface. Any whetstone can be moistened with either water or mineral oil, but not both. 
Do not use vegetable oil on a whetstone because it will soon become rancid and gummy.
Procedure for Using a Sharpening Stone
➊ Place the heel of the knife blade against the 
whetstone at a 15- to 20-degree angle. With 
your fingers on top of the blade, press down on 
the blade while pushing it away from you.
➋ Press and push away so that the entire 
length of the blade comes into contact with 
the stone.
➌ Turn the knife over. Repeat the procedure 
on both sides of the blade until it is 
sufficiently sharp.
A steel does not sharpen a knife nor does it remove any metal from the blade. Rather 
it is used to straighten the edge of the blade immediately after and between sharpenings. 
This restores the cutting edge of the blade and maintains the knife’s sharpness. Using a 
steel on your knife every day before starting to use it should hold the knife’s edge with￾out the constant need for sharpening.
To use a steel, hold it in your non-dominant hand with your fingers behind the guard. 
Place the blade against the steel at a 15- to 20-degree angle. Draw the blade along the 
entire length of the steel using steady, even, light pressure and uniform strokes. Repeat 
the technique several times on each side of the blade. After using the steel, wash and 
sanitize the knife, then wipe off the blade with a clean towel before using.
➊ Place the base of the knife blade against 
the steel at a 15- to 20-degree angle.
➋ Using a steady, even, light pressure, draw 
the blade along the entire length of the steel in 
one smooth motion.
➌ Draw the entire knife blade, including the tip, 
across the steel. Repeat on the other side of the 
knife blade.

GRIPPING YOUR KNIFE
There are several different ways to grip a knife. Use the grip that is most comfortable for 
you or the one dictated by the job at hand. Whichever grip you use should be firm but 
not so tight that your hand becomes tired. Gripping styles are shown here.
The most common grip: Hold the handle 
with three fingers while gripping the blade 
between the thumb and index finger.
A variation on the most common grip: Grip the 
handle with four fingers and place the thumb 
on the front of the handle.
The underhand grip for a rigid boning 
knife: Grip the handle in a fist with 
four fingers and thumb. This grip 
allows you to use the knife tip to cut 
around joints and separate flesh from 
bone when boning meat and poultry.
CONTROLLING YOUR KNIFE
To safely produce even cuts, control your knife with one hand and hold the item being 
cut with the other. Use smooth, even strokes. Never force the blade through the item 
being cut; allow its sharp edge to do the cutting. Using a dull knife or excessive force 
with any knife produces poor results and a significant safety risk. Two safe methods for 
controlling your knife are shown here. The most common grip for holding a paring knife:
Grip the handle with four fingers and place the 
thumb on the front of the handle.
Procedure for Controlling Your Knife: Method A
➋ Using the second joint of your index finger 
as a guide, cut a slice using a smooth, even, 
downward stroke. Adjust the position of the 
guiding finger to produce even slices. After a few 
cuts, slide your fingertips and thumb down the 
length of the item and continue slicing. for this 
technique, the knife’s tip acts as the fulcrum, the 
point from which the knife moves up or down.
➊ Keeping your fingertips curled back, grip 
the item being cut with three fingertips and 
your thumb. Hold the knife in the other hand. 
While keeping the knife’s tip on the cutting 
board, lift the heel of the knife.
M06_LABE1163_07_SE_C06.indd 114 28/10/23 2:03 PMKnife SKillS 115
Procedure for Controlling Your Knife: Method B
USING YOUR KNIFE
Chefs use knives to shape items and reduce their size. Uniformity of size and shape ensures 
even cooking and enhances the appearance of the finished product. A knife can shape 
items by slicing, chopping, dicing, mincing and other special cutting techniques. Many of 
the classic cuts are known by their French names: julienne, for example. Although these 
words are nouns and entered the English language as nouns (e.g., a julienne of carrot), they 
are also used as verbs (to julienne a carrot) and adjectives (julienned carrots).
Scraps and trim produced when making classic knife cuts don’t go to waste. Use them 
in stock, soup and purées. They may be frozen and saved to use when needed.
Slicing
To slice is to cut an item into relatively broad, thin pieces. Slices may be either the fin￾ished cut or the first step in producing other cuts. Slicing is typically used to create three 
specialty cuts: chiffonade, rondelle and diag￾onal. Slicing skills are also used to produce 
oblique or roll cuts. For most applications, 
vegetables and fruit are peeled before slicing 
except when you seek a rustic appearance 
in a garnish or ingredient.
A chiffonade is a preparation of finely 
sliced or shredded leafy vegetables used as 
a garnish or a base under cold presentations. 
As shown here slicing spinach en chiffonade 
is a relatively simple process.
chiffonade [shif-uh-nAHD] to finely slice or 
shred leafy vegetables or herbs
➊ Grip the item as described in Method A. 
Using the second joint of your index finger as 
a guide, lift the knife’s tip and slice by drawing 
the knife slightly back toward you and down 
through the item, cutting the item to the 
desired thickness.
➋ The motion of the knife should come 
almost entirely from the wrist, not the elbow. 
Allow the weight of the knife to do most of the 
work; very little downward pressure needs to be 
applied to the knife. for this slicing technique, 
your wrist should act as the fulcrum, the point 
from which the knife pivots.
➊ Wash and destem the leaves if necessary. 
Stack several leaves on top of each other and 
roll them tightly like a cigar.
➋ Make fine slices moving the knife down 
and forward across the leaves while holding 
the leaf roll tightly.
Safety Alert
Handling Knives
Knives are perhaps the most dangerous 
of kitchen tools, both for the risk of 
cross-contamination they present and the 
inherent sharpness of their blades. Always 
clean, sanitize and dry knives by hand 
immediately after each use to prevent the 
transfer of pathogenic organisms (see 
Chapter 2, food Safety and Sanitation) 
from one product to the next. Do not 
wash knives in commercial dishwashers or 
leave them to soak underwater as the knife 
blade can be damaged by other tools or 
can injure an unsuspecting worker.
When walking with a knife, hold it by 
the handle, near your side, with the point 
facing downward. Store knives properly in 
slotted knife holders or on a wall-mounted 
magnetic strip, not in drawers or containers 
where the blades can be dulled by contact 
with other knives or tools.
M06_LABE1163_07_SE_C06.indd 115 28/10/23 2:03 PM116 CHAPTeR SiX
Rondelles or rounds are disk-shaped slices of cylindrical vegetables or fruits used in 
salads, side dishes, soups and stews.
Place the peeled item on a cutting board. Make even 
slices perpendicular to the item being cut.
Diagonals or bias cuts are elongated or oval-shaped slices of cylindrical vegetables or 
fruits. They are produced with a cut similar to that used to cut rondelles except that the 
knife is held at an angle to the item being cut. Because diagonals have more exposed cut 
sides, they cook more quickly than other cuts. They are used in Asian stir-fried dishes 
and for sautéed vegetables.
rondelles [ron-DellZ] disk-shaped slices
Oblique-cut or roll-cut items are small pieces with two angle-cut sides. It is a relatively 
simple cut most often used on carrots and parsnips in rustic dishes such as soups and stews.
diagonals oval-shaped slices
oblique cuts [oh-BleeK] small pieces with two

Place the peeled item on a cutting board. Holding the 
knife at a 45-degree angle, make the first cut. Roll the 
item a half turn, keeping the knife at the same angle, 
and make another cut. The result is a wedge-shaped 
piece with two angled sides.
Place the peeled item on a cutting board. Position the knife at the desired angle to the item being 
cut and slice it evenly.
M06_LABE1163_07_SE_C06.indd 116 28/10/23 2:03 PMKnife SKillS 117
Chopping
To chop is to cut an item into small pieces when uniformity of size and shape is neither 
necessary (e.g., coarsely chopped onions that will be strained out of a stock before ser￾vice) nor feasible (e.g., parsley).
Coarse chopping is a procedure using the technique for slicing but without the 
emphasis on consistency. Coarsely chopped refers to irregularly shaped pieces that are 
approximately ½ to ¾ inch (1.2 to 2 centimeter) in size.
Parsley and similar items are often fine chopped for use in recipes. As shown here 
the procedure for properly chopping fresh herbs and similar foods is quick and efficient 
and the fineness can be adjusted as needed.
Grip the knife as for slicing. Hold the item 
being chopped with your other hand. it may 
not be necessary to use your finger as a guide 
because uniformity is not crucial.
Procedure for Chopping Parsley and Similar Foods
➊ Wash the parsley in cold water; drain well. 
Remove the parsley sprigs from the stems.
➋ Grip the knife in one hand. With the other 
hand spread flat, hold the knife’s tip on the 
cutting board. Keeping the knife’s tip on the 
board, chop the parsley sprigs by rocking the 
curved blade of the knife up and down while 
moving the knife back and forth over the parsley.
➌ Place the chopped parsley in a clean 
kitchen towel or a double layer of cheesecloth. 
Rinse it under cold water and squeeze out as 
much water as possible. The chopped parsley 
should be dry and fluffy.
A daily chore in many food service facilities, peeling and chopping garlic is a simple 
job made easy with the procedure shown here. Garlic paste, which blends easily into 
sauces and marinades, can also be made from chopped garlic.
Procedure for Chopping Garlic
➊ Break the head of garlic into individual 
cloves with your hands. lightly crush the cloves 
using the flat edge of a chef ’s knife or a mallet. 
The cloves will break open and the peel can be 
separated easily from the garlic flesh.
➋ With a flat hand, hold the knife’s tip on the 
cutting board. Using a rocking motion, chop 
the garlic cloves to the desired size. Garlic is 
usually chopped very finely.
➌ To make garlic paste, first finely chop the 
garlic and then turn the knife on an angle and

 Cutting Sticks and Dicing
To dice is to cut an item into cubes with six equal-sized sides. The techniques described 
here are most often used when uniformity of size and shape is important (e.g., julienned 
carrots for a salad or brunoised vegetables for a garnish). Before an item can be diced, it 
must be cut into a uniform block then into sticks such as juliennes and bâtonnets. These 
sticks are then reduced through dicing into the classic cuts known as brunoise, small 
dice, medium dice, large dice and paysanne.
Although most cooks have some notion of what size and shape “small diced” pota￾toes or julienne carrots may be, classic French culinary principles dictate specific name, 
sizes and shapes for these cuts. The most commonly used cuts are shown here, although 
other cuts of various shapes and sizes are also part of the French lexicon and may be 
encountered throughout your career.
dice to cut into cubes with six equal-sized sides
Procedure for Cutting a Block
➊ Peel the item and square off the sides to 
create a block.
➋ Slice the item into long slices of the desired 
thickness. Then cut the slices into strips of the 
desired width.
Procedure for Cutting Julienne and Bâtonnet
➊ Cut even slices of the desired thickness from 
each block, ⅛ inch (3 millimeters) for julienne or 
¼ inch (6 millimeters) for bâtonnet.
➋ Stack the slices and cut them evenly into 
sticks that are the same thickness as the slices.

Brunoise [BROOn-wahz]: a cube-shaped 
item with dimensions of ⅛ inch × ⅛ inch ×
⅛ inch (3 mm × 3 mm × 3 mm). A 
1⁄16-inch (1.5-mm) cube is referred to as a 
fine brunoise.
Julienne [joo-lee-en]: a stick-shaped item with dimensions 
of ⅛ inch × ⅛ inch × 2 inches (3 mm × 3 mm × 5 cm). When 
used with potatoes, this cut is sometimes referred to as an 
allumette [al-yoo-MeT]. A fine julienne has dimensions of 
1⁄
16 inch × 1⁄
16 inch × 2 inches (1.5 mm × 1.5 mm × 5 cm).
Bâtonnet [bah-toh-nAY]: a stick-shaped item with dimensions of 
¼ inch × ¼ inch × 2 inches (6 mm × 6 mm × 5 cm).
Medium dice: a cube-shaped item with dimensions of ½ inch ×
½ inch × ½ inch (1.2 cm × 1.2 cm × 1.2 cm).
Small dice: a cube-shaped item with dimensions of 
¼ inch × ¼ inch × ¼ inch (6 mm × 6 mm × 6 mm).
M06_LABE1163_07_SE_C06.indd 119 28/10/23 2:03 PM120 CHAPTeR SiX
Brunoise as well as small, medium and large dice are made by first cutting the 
item into sticks following the procedure for cutting julienne or bâtonnet, then making 
cuts perpendicular to the length of the sticks to produce small cubes. Making a ⅛-inch 
(3-millimeter) cut perpendicular to the length of a julienne produces a brunoise. Similarly 
a fine julienne (1
⁄16 inch × 1
⁄16 inch × 2 inches) is used to produce a fine brunoise. 
Making a ¼-inch (6-millimeter) cut perpendicular to the length of a bâtonnet produces a 
small dice. A ½-inch (1.2-centimeter) cut from a ½-inch (1.2-centimeter) stick produces 
a medium dice, and a ¾-inch (1.8-centimeter) cut from a ¾-inch (1.8-centimeter) stick 
produces a large dice.
Paysanne is a classic vegetable cut for garnishing soups and other rustic-style 
dishes. It could be described as a very thin ½-inch (1.2-centimeter) cube. Paysanne is 
produced by following the procedures for dicing, but in the final step the ½-inch ×
½-inch (1.2-centimeter × 1.2-centimeter)sticks are cut into slices ⅛ inch (3 millimeters) 
thick. The terms paysanne and fermière, which mean “peasant” and “farmer” in French, 
are also used to refer to similarly sized round or triangular pieces. Regardless of the 
shape, when cutting paysanne and fermière, the pieces must be the same size.
Lozenges are diamond-shaped cuts prepared from firm vegetables such as carrots, 
turnips, rutabagas and potatoes used in salads, side dishes, soups and stews.
When cutting paysanne, peel the item and 
square off the sides to create a block. Cut it 
into ½-inch × ½-inch (6-millimeter × 
6-millimeter) sticks. Slice each stick into 
⅛-inch (3-millimeter) slices.
➊ Peel the item and square off the sides to 
create a block. Slice the item into long slices of 
the desired thickness. Then cut the slices into 
strips of the desired width.
➋ Cut the strips at an angle to produce 
diamond shapes.
Horizontal slicing is sometimes used to butterfly or make a pocket in meat, poultry 
or fish. It is also used to thinly slice soft vegetables, such as onions, for sautéeing.

➊ With your hand open and your fingertips 
arched upward slightly, hold the item to be cut 
firmly under your fingers.
➋ Holding the knife parallel to the table, slice 
a pocket to the desired depth, or cut through 
the item completely.
Procedure for Dicing an Onion
➊ Using a paring knife, remove the stem end. 
Trim the root end but leave it nearly intact (this 
helps prevent the onion from falling apart while 
dicing). Peel away the outer skin; be careful not 
to remove and waste too much.
➋ Cut the onion in half through the stem 
and root. Place the cut side down on the 
cutting board.
➌ Cut parallel slices of the desired thickness 
vertically through the onion from the 
root toward the stem end without cutting 
completely through the root end.
➍ Make a single horizontal cut on a small 
onion or two horizontal cuts on a large onion 
through the width of the onion, again without 
cutting through the root end.
➎ Turn the onion and cut slices perpendicular 
to the other slices to produce diced onion.

Turning Vegetables
Tourner, or turning vegetables, is a cutting technique that results in a football-shaped 
finished product with seven equal sides and flat ends. The term is derived from the 
French word tourner (meaning “to turn”). The size of the turned vegetable may vary; 
the most common, called Anglaise, is 2 inches (5 centimeters) long and 1 to 1½ inches 
(2.5 to 3.5 centimeters) in diameter. Cocotte refers to turned vegetables approximately 
1½ inches (3.5 centimeters) in length. Château refers to turned vegetables, often pota￾toes, that are approximately 2½ inches (5 centimeters) in length. Turning vegetables is a 
more complicated procedure than producing other cuts, and it takes considerable prac￾tice to produce good, consistent results. Turned carrots, parsnips, potatoes and zucchini 
are used as side dishes or to garnish entrées and stews.
Mincing
To mince is to cut an item into very small pieces. The terms finely chopped and minced
are often used interchangeably and are most often used when referring to garlic, shallots, 
herbs and other foods that do not have to be uniform in shape.
Procedure for Mincing Shallots
➊ Peel and dice the shallots, following the 
procedure for peeling and dicing an onion.
➋ With a flat hand, hold the knife’s tip on the 
cutting board. Using a rocking motion, mince 
the shallots with the heel of the knife.
Procedure for Turning Vegetables
➊ Cut the item being turned into pieces 
2 inches (5 centimeters) × 1 to 1½ inches 
(2.5 to 3.5 centimeters). each piece should 
have flat ends. Peeling is optional because in 
most cases the item’s entire surface area is 
trimmed away.
➋ Holding the item between the thumb and 
forefinger, use a curved or a bird’s beak paring 
knife to cut seven curved sides on the item, 
creating a flat-ended, football-shaped product.
Making Parisiennes
A melon ball cutter or Parisian scoop can be used to cut fruits and vegetables into 
uniform spheres. Small balls or spheres of fresh melon can be used in fruit salad, while 
tiny spheres of carrot, turnip, potatoes, squash and so on can be used as a side dish or 
to garnish soup or an entrée. Melon ball cutters are available in a range of sizes from 
⅜ inch (9 millimeter) to ¾ inch (2 centimeters).

USING SPECIALIZED CUTTING TOOLS
Chefs in professional kitchens employ a variety of specialized cutting tools to peel veg￾etables and cut them into unique shapes and forms. These tools increase efficiency and 
consistency. They do, however, have sharp blades that can cause an injury if safety pre￾cautions are not followed. Be sure to clean and sanitize them after each use to prevent 
cross-contamination as well.
 Using a Spiral Slicer
Specialized devices such as the spiral slicer shown here are used to make cuts that are 
difficult to produce with a knife. Firm fruits such as apples and pears and firm vegetables 
such as beets, carrots, parsnips, potatoes and zucchini can be sliced into spirals or 
ribbons using such devices. When using these tools, always follow manufacturer’s 
 directions. Use the guard or steel-mesh gloves to protect your hands.
Using a Mandoline
The mandoline is a nonmechanical cutting tool. It does jobs that can also be done with 
a chef’s knife, such as very thinly sliced apples or large quantities of julienned veg￾etables, quickly, easily and very accurately. It can also produce cuts such as a ridged 
slice or gaufrette, which a conventional chef’s knife cannot produce. Because of its 
sharp blades, the mandoline should be treated with caution. Always use the guard or a 
 steel-mesh glove to protect your hand and follow the procedure illustrated on page 124.

 Procedure for Using a Mandoline 
➊ To use a mandoline, position the legs and 
set the blade to the desired shape and thickness. 
➋ Slide the guard into place. 
➌ To slice, slide the item against the blade 
with a single, smooth stroke. 
➍ To cut gaufrette, select the ridged blade and 
set it to the desired thickness. Make the first 
slice, turn the item 60–90 degrees and make a 
second slice. Turn the item back to the original 
position and make another slice, and so on.

 I
t is the chef ’s role to consistently present well-flavored foods—to excite the diner’s 
brain and palate. This can be accomplished by simply sprinkling a bit of salt over a ripe 
watermelon to enhance the melon’s natural sweetness or by using a long-simmered 
stock made from wild mushrooms to enrich a sauce flavored with herbs and wine. In either 
case, the chef must be able to recognize flavoring ingredients and know how to use them. 
This chapter discusses the senses of taste and smell and the flavoring ingredients used in 
the professional kitchen to enhance foods. Flavorings—the herbs, spices, salt, oils, vinegars, 
condiments, wines and other alcoholic beverages typically used to create, enhance or alter 
the natural flavors of a dish—are featured. The flavorings that are used primarily for baked 
goods and desserts are discussed in Chapter 30 , Principles of the Bakeshop.
 This chapter concludes with a brief section on distinguishing and understanding the 
 flavor profiles of global and international cuisines. 
 THE SCIENCE OF FLAVOR AND TASTE 
 From the simplest grunt of pleasure upon biting into a chunk of grilled steak to the most 
sophisticated discourse on the fruity top notes of a full-bodied Cabernet Sauvignon, people 
have long attempted to describe the flavors of food. Often this is done by describing physi￾cal perceptions (“it tastes sugary” or “it feels greasy”) or the recognition of a flavor (“I can 
sense the rosemary” or “there is a hint of strawberries”). In either case, the terms taste and 
flavor are often confused. Although often used interchangeably, they are not synonymous. 
Taste is limited to sweet, sour, salty, bitter and umami, which are the sensations 
perceived when a substance triggers taste receptor cells in the mouth, called taste 
buds. These buds are located in bumps found primarily on the tongue called papillae. 
A human tongue is covered with thousands of these taste-sensitive papillae. Despite 
what you may have heard, specific areas of the tongue are not responsible for recogniz￾ing certain tastes. Scientists now know that all human papillae contain receptor cells for 
all five tastes. 
Aromas are the odors that enter the nose directly or float up through the back of the 
mouth to activate smell receptors in the nose. Humans have about 1000 aroma receptors, 
but some substances stimulate or irritate nerves on the tongue or embedded in the fleshy 
areas of the mouth. These nerves respond to feelings, such as pain, heat or cold, or sensa￾tions that our brain interprets as spiciness, pungency or astringency. Mouthfeel is simply 
the feelings created in the mouth by a food or beverage’s texture and temperature. 
Flavor refers to the combination of tastes, aromas and other sensations caused by the 
presence of a foreign substance in the mouth, as interpreted by the brain. Whenever we 
detect a particular taste, texture sensation and/or aroma, a set of neurons (specialized 
cells that transmit nerve impulses) in the brain is excited and, with experience, we learn 
to recognize the pattern of these sensations as the flavor of bananas, grilled lamb or sour 
cream. Each person has a unique ability to recognize and appreciate thousands of these 
patterns. An individual may dislike some flavors that another person finds pleasant. Even 
though they are tasting, smelling and feeling the same thing, how the brain combines 
these sensations based on past exposure or cultural conditioning becomes part of each 
individual’s flavor perception. This range of flavors and the ability to recognize them is 
sometimes referred to as the palate . 
 Tastes: Sweet, Sour, Salty, Bitter and Umami 
 Taste is the sensation we experience when substances come in contact with the taste 
buds. For many years western cultures only identified four tastes; umami was added to 
the list more recently. Still up for debate is whether fatty acids become the sixth taste or 
remain only a texture.

Sweet: For most people, sweetness is the most pleasurable and most often sought￾after taste. The fewer sweet-tasting foods we consume, the more enhanced our 
ability to recognize sweetness becomes. A food’s sweetness derives from naturally 
occurring sugars (e.g., sucrose and fructose) or sweeteners added to it. Chefs can 
enhance the natural sweetness in foods by adding a small amount of a sour, bitter or 
salty taste. Adding too much sourness, bitterness or saltiness, however, lessens our 
perception of the food’s sweetness. 
Sour: Considered the opposite of sweet, a sour taste is found in acidic foods. Like 
sweetness, sourness can vary greatly in intensity. Many foods with a dominant sour 
taste, such as red currants or sour cream, also contain a slight sweetness. A sour 
taste can sometimes be improved by adding a little sweetness or it can be negated 
by adding a large amount of a sweet ingredient. 
Salty: With the notable exception of shellfish and seaweed, the presence of a salty 
taste is the result of the cook’s decision to add the mineral sodium chloride, known 
as salt, or to use a previously salted ingredient such as salt-cured fish, salt-cured 
meat, soy sauce or certain cheeses. Salt helps finish a dish, heightening or enhancing 
its other flavors. Dishes that lack salt often taste flat. Adding a small amount of 
salt or something salty corrects something that is overly sweet. Like the taste of 
sweetness, if we consume less salt on a regular basis, we are more able to detect 
saltiness in foods. 
Bitter: Although the bitter taste caused by alkaloids and other organic substances may 
occasionally be appreciated in foods such as beer, dark chocolate, fermented cheese 
or coffee, most people dislike a bitter-flavored ingredient that is not balanced by sour 
or salty flavors. Bitter is an acquired taste in all cultures. The natural human aversion 
to bitterness is believed to function as a survival mechanism, warning us of inedible or 
toxic foods. Many foods that are good for us, such as herbs and vegetables, especially 
those in the cabbage family, are bitter. But when used as a side note in a dish, these 
foods go from mouth-puckering to delicious. The sour taste in citrus juice or vinegar 
can offset bitterness, as does the addition of salt or sugar. 
Umami: Long recognized as the fifth taste in Japanese cuisine, umami (from the 
Japanese word umai , meaning “delicious”) does not have a simple English translation. 
For some people it refers to a food’s savory characteristic, for others to the richness 
or fullness of a dish’s overall taste, and still others, the meatiness or meat taste of a 
dish. The umami sensation is caused by the naturally occurring amino acid glutamate 
and is abundant in aged or fermented foods and glutamate’s commercially produced 
counterpart, monosodium glutamate (MSG). Glutamate is present in many foods and 
in cheeses, meats, rich stocks, soy sauce, shellfish, fatty fish, mushrooms, tomatoes 
and wine, which are all high in this amino acid. 
 Scientists have recently discovered that fat , which has long been known to carry 
or enhance flavors, may be a sixth taste that can be detected by the human tongue. 
Research has established that receptors on taste buds can detect the presence of fat in 
foods. This finding is about more than just the creamy, juicy or silky texture associated 
with fat. Oleogustus refers to the actual taste of fatty acids, which although unpleasantly 
bitter in high concentrations can, in lower quantities, add an appealing contrast similar 
to the bitterness found in chocolate, wine, coffee or tea. Research is still ongoing, but 
the finding that some people are genetically more sensitive than others to the taste of fat 
may help us to better understand obesity and food cravings. 
 Often food professionals and others refer to tastes in addition to sweet, sour, salty, 
bitter, umami and fat. Typically they describe foods as pungent, hot, spicy or piquant 
or astringent, sharp or dry. None of these terms, however, fit the definition of a taste, as 
none are detected solely by taste buds. Rather these sensations are detected by nerve 
endings embedded in the fleshy part of the mouth. When irritated by the presence of 
compounds such as piperine (the active ingredient in black peppercorns) or capsaicin 
(the active ingredient in chiles), these nerves register a burning sensation that the brain 
translates as the hot and spicy “taste” of a dish.

Factors Affecting Perception of Flavors
The most important factors affecting the flavor of a dish are the amount, quality and con￾centration of the flavoring ingredients. (With practice, a chef gains a feel for the proper 
proportions.) Other factors that affect our perception of flavors include the following:
Temperature: The higher the temperature of the food, the stronger its taste. Hot tea 
expresses more flavor compounds than iced tea or room temperature tea. Heating 
foods releases volatile aroma compounds, which intensifies our perceptions of odors. 
Cold foods and beverages dull taste sensations by constricting protein channels within 
taste buds. Foods tend to lose their sour or sweet tastes both the colder and the hotter 
they become. Saltiness, however, is perceived differently at extreme cold temperatures; 
the same quantity of salt in a solution is perceived more strongly when very cold than 
when merely cool or warm. For these reasons it is best to adjust a dish’s final flavors 
at its serving temperature. Season food that will be served hot when it is hot and food 
that will be served cold when it is cold.
How We Experience Taste and Smell
The smallest functional unit of taste is the 
taste bud. These specialized sensory organs 
are found on the tongue within three different 
kinds of small bumps, known as papillae, as 
well as the back of the throat and the roof of 
the mouth. (See Figure 7.1.) Each taste bud 
contains several taste receptor cells. Taste 
compounds in the foods we eat interact with 
the tops of these specialized receptor cells, 
which transmit taste information through 
nerves to the brain. The process of tasting 
begins when a substance is placed in the mouth 
and the substance’s taste compounds begin to 
dissolve in saliva. Chewing further breaks down 
the substance and increases the concentration 
of taste compounds dissolved in the saliva. The 
taste compounds stimulate taste receptors and 
ultimately elicit taste sensations. Because taste 
compounds must dissolve in the saliva to reach 
the taste receptors, they must be water-soluble.
The process of smelling begins when odor 
compounds reach the olfactory neurons, the 
specialized sensing organs of smell. Olfactory 
neurons at the top of the nasal cavity are 
clustered together in the olfactory bulb. (See 
Figure 7.2.) One olfactory bulb rests at the 
bottom of each hemisphere of the brain and at 
the top of each nasal cavity. Odor compounds 
reach these receptors through two different 
pathways: orthonasally or retronasally. When 
we sniff or experience odors that are external 
to our bodies via our nostrils, we are smelling 
orthonasally. Once we place a substance in our 
mouth, the aromas are delivered through the 
retronasal path. Regardless of route, for odor 
compounds to reach the olfactory receptors 
they must be able to volatilize—to dissolve 
in—air. In contrast to taste compounds, odor 
compounds do not dissolve well in water; they 
dissolve better in oils.
A pervasive myth (based upon 
misinterpretation of an article written in German 
in the 1800s) is that you experience certain taste 
qualities on only certain areas of the tongue 
(sweet on the tip, bitter in the back, salt on the 
front sides and sour on the back sides). In fact 
you can taste all taste compounds everywhere 
on your tongue. You can prove this to yourself 
by placing various items representative of sweet, 
sour, salty, bitter and even umami on the tip of 
your tongue. You can immediately perceive any 
taste at the tongue tip (or anywhere else you have 
taste buds) and do not need to wait for bitter 
compounds to diffuse to the back, sour to the 
back sides, or salt to the sides.

Consistency: Consistency affects a food’s flavor. Two items with the same amount 
of taste and smell compounds that differ in texture differ in perceived flavor 
intensity; the thicker item will take longer to reach its peak intensity and will have a 
less intense flavor. For example, two batches of sweetened heavy cream made from 
the same ingredients in the same proportions may taste different if one is whipped 
and the other is unwhipped; the whipped cream has more volume and therefore a 
milder flavor.
Contrasting taste: Sweet and sour are considered opposites, and often the addition 
of one to a food dominated by the other will enhance the food’s overall flavor. For 
example, adding a little sugar to vinaigrette reduces the dressing’s sourness; adding 
a squeeze of lemon to a broiled lobster reduces the shellfish’s sweetness. Similarly, 
adding something sweet, sour or salty to a dish with a predominantly bitter flavor 
will cut the bitterness, but add too much contrasting flavor and the dominant taste 
will be negated.
Fat: Many of the chemical compounds that create tastes and aromas are dissolved 
in the fats that naturally occur in foods or are added to foods during preparation. 
As these fat compounds are slowly released by body heat or saliva, they provide 
a sustained taste sensation. If there is too little fat, the flavor compounds may 
not be released efficiently, resulting in a dish with little sustained flavor. This is 
one reason that low-fat and reduced-fat products, such as salad dressings, yogurt 
or sour cream, can seem tasteless. Too much fat poses another problem; it can 
coat the tongue and interfere with the ability of taste receptors to perceive flavor 
compounds.
Color: A food’s color affects how we perceive flavor before we even taste the 
food. When foods or beverages lack their customary color, we are less able 
to correctly identify them than when they are appropriately colored. As color 
level changes to match our expectations, our perception of taste and flavor 
intensity increases. A miscue created by color can have an adverse impact on 
the consumer’s appreciation of flavor. For example, if the predominant flavor 
of a dessert is lemon, the dessert or some component of the dessert should be 
yellow. A green color triggers an expectation of lime and possible disappointment 
of the consumer. Similarly, the dark ruby-red flesh of a blood orange looks 
different from the more common bright orange flesh of a Valencia orange. This 
color difference can create the expectation of a different, non-orangey flavor, 
even though the blood orange’s flavor is similar to that of other orange varieties. 
Likewise, a sliced apple that has turned brown may suggest an off-flavor, although 
there is none.
Of special note is the perception and appreciation of saltiness. What one person 
perceives as highly salted may taste ideal to someone else. And, over time, taste adapts 
to the level of saltiness in food. Continual exposure to highly salted foods increases salt 
tolerance. Similarly, a person can, over time, develop an appreciation for less salty food 
by decreasing the amount of salt consumed.
The sense of taste can be challenged by factors both within and beyond one’s 
control. Age and general health can diminish one’s perception of flavor, as can fatigue 
and stress. As we age, our sense of taste and smell naturally declines, although this 
varies from person to person. Overall health impacts our taste perceptions too. A 
head cold can suppress our ability to smell because mucus prevents the flow of aro￾mas to our nasal receptors but the ability to perceive basic tastes on the tongue may 
be unaffected. Some medications may interact with basic tastes, increasing or decreas￾ing one’s ability to taste salt or bitter compounds. Smoking has an immediate negative 
effect on one’s ability to taste and smell foods, but scientific evidence suggests that 
taste perception may be restored after a few hours. Chefs need to be aware of the 
age and health of their clientele, adjusting the seasoning of foods served according to 
their needs.
Supertasters, Medium 
Tasters and Nontasters
Recent research into the physiology of 
taste has shown that some people detect 
a greater degree of a taste in foods 
than others. labeled as supertasters by 
linda Bartoshuk, Phd of the University 
of Florida’s Center for Smell and Taste, 
these people may have more taste buds 
than average, possibly twice as many as 
other people. Supertasters perceive the 
compound 6-n-propylthiouracil (PROP), 
which is found in foods such as coffee, 
broccoli, Brussels sprouts, grapefruit 
juice and green tea, as intensely bitter. 
In addition, they detect strongly bitter 
flavors where other people (referred to 
as nontasters) do not. Supertasters also 
tend to perceive artificial sweeteners as 
sweeter than the rest of the population 
does and also note a bitter aftertaste 
that most people miss. Similarly, 
supertasters find the spicy heat generated 
by the capsaicin in chile peppers to be 
more pronounced, sometimes unbearably 
so. Being a supertaster is an inherited 
genetic trait; it cannot be changed by 
experience or effort. Nontasters do not 
carry these genes.
An individual’s responsiveness to 
tastes appears to influence food choices. 
Supertasters tend to avoid strong-tasting 
foods such as coffee, rich or very sweet 
desserts, greasy or spicy meats and green 
leafy vegetables. They also tend not to 
crave fats or sugars. Cooks who are not 
supertasters may not realize when a 
food would be too sweet or too bitter 
to medium tasters or supertasters who 
carry this genetic trait. Supertaster cooks 
may unconsciously avoid using foods that 
would be perfectly delicious to diners 
who are not supertasters. It is easy to 
determine your taste level with chemically 
treated tasting papers, known as PTC 
(phenylthiourea) test strips.

THE PRINCIPLES OF FLAVORING FOOD
The judicious use of flavorings and seasonings transforms raw ingredients such as beef 
chuck into the aromatic stew boeuf Bourguignon or plain noodles into a fragrant bowl 
of pasta with pesto sauce. Mastery of flavoring and seasoning foods is the hallmark of a 
true culinary professional.
Building a professional taste memory and understanding flavors begin with aromas. 
Aromas are processed by an area of the brain adjacent to the area responsible for stor￾ing long-term memories. That’s why a smell might trigger memories from your past. Use 
aroma to improve your palate by smelling everything as you are cooking. When you 
open a packaged spice or a bottle of oil, or cut into a vegetable or fruit, take a moment 
to close your eyes and breathe in the aromas. When eating, pause to allow the aromas 
in your nasal passages to combine with the tastes on your tongue so that your brain can 
store the experience. The following guidelines are also useful in building your palate:
	▪ Start with simple combinations of ingredients until you build your knowledge and 
understand how flavors and ingredients interact.
	▪ Whenever possible, select fresh foods that are in season. During transportation 
and storage, foods can lose moisture, nutrients and volatile aromas.
	▪ Match the flavoring used to both the ingredient and cooking technique. Cooking 
techniques affect the appearance, aroma, taste and texture of foods. Techniques 
such as roasting and caramelizing intensify flavors while boiling and blanching 
may dilute them.
	▪ Preparation techniques also impact the flavor of foods. The size of the cut affects 
the perception of the taste and texture of a vegetable, for example. Depending on 
how long they are cooked, vegetables cut into small pieces absorb more flavors 
in a dish than larger cuts.
Flavor Profiles
A food’s flavor profile describes its flavor from the moment guests get the first whiff of 
its aroma until they swallow that last morsel. It is a convenient way to articulate and 
evaluate a dish’s sensory characteristics as well as identify contrasting or complementing 
items that could be served with it. Chefs use the concept of flavor profiles as a tool to 
develop new dishes.
A food’s flavor profile consists of one or more of the following elements:
Top notes or high notes: The sharp, first flavors or aromas of foods such as citrus, 
herbs, spices and many condiments. These top notes provide instant impact and 
dissipate quickly.
Middle notes: The second wave of flavors and aromas. More subtle and more 
lingering than top notes, middle notes come from dairy products, poultry, some 
vegetables, fish and some meats.
Low notes or bass notes: The most dominant, lingering flavors. These flavors 
consist of the basic tastes (especially sweetness, sourness, saltiness and umami) and 
come from foods such as anchovies, beans, chocolate, dried mushrooms, fish sauce, 
tomatoes, most meats (especially beef and game) and garlic. Alternatively, low notes 
can be created by smoking or caramelizing a food’s sugars during grilling, broiling 
and other dry-heat cooking processes.
Aftertaste or finish: The final flavor that remains in the mouth after swallowing; 
for example, the lingering bitterness of coffee or chocolate or the pungency of black 
pepper or strong mustard.
Roundness: The unity of the dish’s various flavors achieved through the judicious 
use of butter, cream, coconut milk, reduced stocks, salt, sugar and the like; these 
ingredients cause the other flavorings to linger without necessarily adding their own 
dominant taste or flavor.
Depth of flavor: The broad range of flavor notes in a dish.

food and alters its natural flavors; flavorings 
include herbs, spices, vinegars and condiments; 
the terms seasoning and flavoring are often 
used interchangeably

flavors of a food without dramatically changing

experience of a food or dish that may be 
explained by the top, middle and bottom notes, 
(2) the taste and aroma of foods prepared in a

Food or German; created by the combination 
of ingredients and culinary techniques

These expressions can be applied to any dish to describe its sensory characteristics. 
For example, Lavender and Spice-Crusted Duck Breast with Apricot Compote (page 497) 
has a flavor profile with a top note of lavender, coriander and fennel. Its middle notes 
are the predominant flavors contributed by the duck breast, and its low notes are from 
the crisp skin. There is an aftertaste of the combined flavors. The sauce adds acidic and 
sweet notes to the duck, thus creating a dish with a fine depth of flavor.
An experienced chef is able to taste and evaluate a dish, adjusting flavorings, ingredi￾ents and cooking technique as needed to create an appealing balance of flavors.
Describing Aromas and Flavors in Food
Food scientists and professional tasters make their living describing the smell and taste of 
foods. Many have attempted to standardize the language used to describe both positive 
and negative aromas and flavors. Frequently they employ flavor wheels or other charts 
to identify and organize the flavors and tastes found in specific food items. For example, 
there are flavor wheels devoted to chocolate, wine, catfish, Italian cheese, coffee, citrus 
fruits and just about every other category of food and beverage. These charts are readily 
available online and help food scientists, product developers and culinarians to speak a 
common language when describing the flavors they encounter.
Table 7.1 is one list used by chemists to describe 16 broad categories of tastes and 
smells that correspond to the major chemicals found in aromas and tastes. Such a list is 
helpful when trying to analyze and describe the flavors in a dish.
Classic Flavor Combinations
Culinary tradition provides chefs with myriad flavor combinations to use when preparing 
dishes. What would apple pie be without cinnamon? Or a hot dog without mustard? The 
recipes in this text use classic and traditional flavor combinations as well as such modern 
flavor pairings as coffee in a sauce for beef. It is helpful, as you begin to cook, to learn 
some classic flavor combinations, those that have become well-regarded matches due to 
decades, even centuries, of development and service. (See Table 7.2.)

Foods from the same botanical family often complement each other. Chile peppers, 
eggplants, potatoes and tomatoes, members of the Solanaceae or nightshade family, are 
often combined. The French vegetable casserole called ratatouille is one example of a 
dish that brings members of this botanical family together; it consists of chile peppers, 
eggplants, tomatoes and zucchini with garlic, onions and thyme. Herbs, spices and fla￾vorings that enhance one member of a botanical family usually enhance another. For 
example, any combination of the ingredients and seasonings used in ratatouille would be 
delicious together. Similarly, herbs from one family are often interchangeable. Member 
of the Lamiaceae or mint family—basil, mint, oregano, sage, savory and thyme—share 
flavor characteristics that may make suitable substitutes. A pot of white beans or an 
aromatic vegetable or lamb stew could be simmered with any of the herbs in the group.

The section on flavor principles of international cuisines on page 156 provides more 
specific information on flavor combinations common in various regions of the world, as 
do the green sidebars throughout this text.
Amplifying Flavors
Chefs combine ingredients to enhance the flavor profile of the foods they prepare. Which 
ingredients they use and how they use them determine the effect on a dish. To intensify 
a particular taste or aroma in a dish, variations of the same flavoring or ingredient can 
be used. The addition of lemon rind, lemon juice and lemon basil to the dressing for 
a chicken salad, for example, layers the dish with flavors that amplify its lemony taste.
Chefs accent dishes, especially in the last moments before they are served, with herbs, 
spices, condiments, vinegars and other ingredients to add to the diner’s eating experi￾ence. Take, for example, the act of sprinkling a small amount of large flake salt on grilled 
meat or vegetables before serving. The guest experiences the light crunchy texture of the 
salt as well as a burst of salinity in their first bites. Similarly, chopped garlic, lemon zest 
and parsley scattered over the Italian braised veal dish osso buco enlivens the diner’s 
palate. The bold, raw garnish contrasts with the rich flavors of the long-braised stew. 
A splash of acid on something sweet enhances the sweet tastes in the dish. That’s why 
chefs squeeze lemon juice over fresh strawberries immediately before serving to high￾light the sweetness of the ripe fruit.
Often the use of an herb, spice, condiment, vinegar or other ingredients harmonize 
a dish, bringing disparate ingredients together into a pleasing whole. Adding a swirl of 
butter or other fat to a pan sauce stabilizes the liquids and blends the flavors. A creamy 
soup benefits from fresh pepper, which both seasons the liquid and balances the fatty, 
creamy notes with a burst of resinous, pine-like flavor.
When working to layer, accent or harmonize the flavors in a dish, also consider the 
other elements that will be served with it. The chicken salad with layered lemon fla￾vors described above requires an accompaniment that balances its tart assertive tastes. 
Serving it with a creamy potato salad would balance the acidic flavors but serving it with 
 vinegar-dressed coleslaw would not. Remember that all flavors on a plate must be agree￾able and in balance.
Experimenting with Flavor
Creating dishes with appealing and complex flavors comes with practice and a solid 
understanding and appreciation of flavoring ingredients. Although some flavoring com￾binations are timeless—rosemary with lamb, dill with salmon, nutmeg with spinach, 
caraway with rye bread—less common pairings can be equally delicious and excit￾ing. You must be willing and able to experiment with new flavors, but first you must 
become familiar with the distinctive flavors and aromas of various herbs, spices, con￾diments, vinegars and other ingredients. When considering a new flavor such as a 
different herb or spice combination in a dish, test it on a small portion of food. Then 
cook and taste this small portion before seasoning the entire dish. Even in a well-tested 
recipe, the quantity of flavorings may need to be adjusted because of a change in 
brands or the condition of the ingredients. Strive to develop your palate to recognize 
and correct subtle variances as necessary. When you experiment, always bear in mind 
the following guidelines:
	▪ Flavorings should not hide the taste or aroma of the primary ingredient.
	▪ Flavorings should be combined in balance, so as not to overwhelm the palate.
	▪ Flavorings should not be used to disguise poor quality or poorly prepared 
products.
	▪ Flavorings should be added sparingly when foods are to be cooked over an 
extended period of time. During cooking, flavorings can intensify and overpower 
a dish.
	▪ Add flavorings and seasonings a small amount at a time. Taste and season foods 
frequently during cooking.

 IDENTIFYING AND USING HERBS AND SPICES 
 The terms herbs and spices are often used to refer to the same category of things, but they 
are different. Herbs are members of the large group of aromatic plants whose leaves, 
stems or flowers are used in dried and fresh form to add flavors to other foods. Spices
are strongly flavored or aromatic portions of plants used as flavorings, condiments or 
aromatics. Spices are the bark, roots, seeds, buds or berries of plants that usually grow 
naturally only in tropical climates. Spices are almost always used in their dried form, 
rarely fresh, and can usually be purchased whole or ground. Some plants—dill, for 
example—can be used as both an herb (its leaves) and a spice (its seeds). Some herbs 
and spices are rich in aromatic oils that may easily overpower a dish. Know which herbs 
and spices may overwhelm and use them sparingly. 
 In the sections that follow, we present photos and discuss common herbs and spices 
to help familiarize you with them. This information is no substitute, however, for person￾ally smelling and tasting these items yourself. 
 Herbs 
 Fragrant herbs are available fresh or dried. Because drying alters their flavors and aro￾mas, fresh herbs are generally preferred and should be used if possible. Micro herbs
are the first true leaves of virtually any edible herb, such as basil or chervil. Micro 
herbs are very fragile and must be handpicked and carefully packaged for 
delivery. They are bursting with intense flavor; chefs use them as garnishes, 
especially on entrées and canapés. 
Basil (Fr. basilic ) is one of the great culi￾nary herbs. It is available in a variety of 
“flavors”—cinnamon, garlic, lemon, 
even chocolate—but the most com￾mon is sweet basil. Sweet basil has 
light green, tender leaves and small 
white flowers. Its flavor isn’t actually 
sweet, but rather strong, warm and slightly pep￾pery, with a hint of anise and cloves. Basil is used in 
Mediterranean and some Southeast Asian cuisines and has a special 
affinity for garlic and tomatoes. When purchasing fresh basil, look for 
bright green leaves; avoid flower buds and wilted or rust-colored leaves. Dried sweet 
basil is readily available but has a decidedly weaker flavor than fresh. 
Opal basil is named for its vivid purple color. It has a 
tougher, crinkled leaf and a medium-strong flavor. Opal basil 
may be substituted for sweet basil in cooking, and its appear￾ance makes it a distinctive garnish. 
Thai sweet basil (Th. bai horapha ) has a narrow leaf 
and purple stem. It has a slight licorice flavor and is used 
in both raw and cooked dishes in Southeast Asian cuisines. 
Bay (Fr. laurier ), also known as sweet laurel, is a small 
tree that produces tough, glossy leaves with a sweet balsamic aroma 
and peppery flavor. In cooking, dried bay leaves are often preferred 
over the more bitter fresh leaves. Essential in French cuisine, bay 
leaves are part of the traditional bouquets garnis and court bouil￾lon. Whole dried bay leaves are usually added to a dish at the 
start of cooking, then removed when sufficient flavor has 
been extracted. 
Chervil (Fr. cerfeuil ), also known as sweet cicely, 
is native to Russia and the Middle East. Its lacy, fern￾like leaves can be used as a garnish. Chervil’s flavor 
is delicate, similar to parsley but with the distinctive 
 herb any of a large group of aromatic plants 
whose leaves, stems or flowers are used as a 
flavoring; used either dried or fresh 
 aromatic (1) having a characteristic and 
pleasant odor or smell; (2) a food added to 
enhance the natural aromas of another food; 
aromatics include most flavorings, such as 
herbs and spices, as well as some vegetables, 
especially celery, carrots and onions 
 spice any of a large group of aromatic plants 
whose bark, roots, seeds, buds or berries are 
used as a flavoring; usually used in dried form, 
either whole or ground

aroma of anise. It should not be heated for long periods. Chervil is commonly used 
in French cuisine especially in fish dishes where its subtle flavor can be appreciated. 
Chervil is one of the traditional ingredients in fines herbes, a classic French blend that 
consists of chives, chervil, parsley and tarragon.
Chives (Fr. ciboulettes) are perhaps the most delicate and sophisticated members 
of the onion family. Their hollow, thin grass-green stems grow in clumps and produce 
round, pale purple flowers, which are used as a garnish. Chives may be purchased 
dried, quick-frozen or fresh. They have a mild onion flavor and bright green color. 
Chives make an excellent garnish when snipped with scissors or carefully chopped and 
sprinkled over finished soups or sauces. Chives complement eggs, poultry, potatoes, fish 
and shellfish. They should not be cooked for long periods or at 
high temperatures.
Garlic chives or Chinese chives have flat, 
solid (not hollow) stems and a mild 
garlic flavor. Although they belong 
to another plant species, they may be 
used in place of regular chives if their 
garlic flavor is desired.
Cilantro (Fr. coriandre; Sp. culan￾tro) is the green leafy portion of the plant 
that yields seeds known as coriander. The 
 flavors of the two portions of this plant are very 
 different and cannot be substituted for each other. Cilantro, 
also known as Chinese parsley, is sharp and tangy with a strong aroma 
and an almost citrus flavor. It is widely used in Asian, Mexican and South American cui￾sines, especially in salads and sauces. Cilantro should not be subjected to heat, and its 
flavor is destroyed by drying. Do not use yellow or discolored leaves or the tough base 
of the stems. Although some people are genetically predisposed to disliking cilantro, 
when used in excess, anyone might find that cilantro tastes soapy.
Curry leaves (Hindi kitha neem) are the distinctively fla￾vored leaves of a small tree that grows wild in the Himalayan 
foothills, in southern India and in Sri Lanka. These small 
shiny leaves have a strong curry-like fragrance and a 
 citrus-curry flavor. Often added to a preparation whole then 
removed before serving, they can also be minced or finely 
chopped for marinades and sauces. Choose fresh bright 
green leaves, if possible, or frozen leaves; dried leaves have 
virtually no flavor. Although used in making southern Indian 
and Thai dishes, curry leaves (also known as neem leaves) 
must not be confused with curry powder, which is 
discussed later.
Dill (Fr. aneth), a member of the parsley 
 family, has tiny, aromatic, yellow flowers and 
feathery, delicate blue-green leaves. The leaves 
taste similar to parsley, but sharper, with a touch 
of anise. Dill seeds are flat, oval and brown, 
with a bitter flavor similar to caraway. Both the 
seeds and the leaves of the dill plant are used in 
cooking. Dill is commonly used in Scandinavian 
and central European cuisines, particularly with 
fish and potatoes. Both leaves and seeds are used 
in pickling and sour dishes. Dill leaves are available fresh or dried but lose their 
aroma and flavor during cooking, so they should be added after the dish is removed 
from heat. Dill seeds are available whole or ground and are used in fish dishes, pick￾les and breads.

Oregano
lemongrass
Epazote, also known as wormseed or stinkweed, grows wild 
throughout the Americas. It has a strong aroma similar 
to kerosene and a wild flavor. Fresh epazote is 
used in salads and as a flavoring in Mexican and 
Southwestern cuisines. It is often cooked with 
beans to reduce their gaseousness. Dried epazote is 
brewed to make a beverage.
Lavender is an evergreen with thin leaves and tall stems 
bearing spikes of tiny purple flowers. Although lavender is known primarily for its 
aroma, which is widely used in perfumes, soaps and cosmetics, the flowers are also used 
as a flavoring, particularly in Middle Eastern and Provençal cuisines. These flowers have 
a sweet, lemony flavor and can be crystallized and used as a garnish. Lavender is also 
used in jams and preserves and to flavor teas.
Lemongrass (Fr. herbe de citron), also known as citronella grass, is a tropical grass 
with the strong aroma and flavor of lemon. It is similar to scallions in appearance but 
with a woody texture. Only the lower base and white leaf stalks are used. Available fresh 
or quick-frozen, lemongrass is widely used in Southeast Asian cuisines.
Lime leaves from a species of thorny lime trees (Citrus hystrix) are 
used much like bay leaves to flavor soups and stews 
in Thai and other Asian cuisines. These small, dark 
green leaves have a bright citrus floral aroma. The 
limes have very little juice and are rarely used in 
cooking. The fragrant lime leaves should be used 
fresh or frozen, not dried and are removed from 
dishes before serving.
Marjoram (Fr. marjolaine), sometimes known 
as sweet marjoram, is a flowering herb native to the Mediterranean and 
used since ancient times. It is closely related to oregano, and the two are often used 
interchangeably. Marjoram is used in many European cuisines and tends to have a 
piney sweet flavor that is milder than oregano. Although it is available 
fresh, marjoram is one of the few herbs whose flavor increases when 
dried.
Mint (Fr. menthe), a large family of herbs, includes 
many species and flavors (including lemon and chocolate). 
Spearmint is the most common garden and commercial vari￾ety. Mint has soft, bright green leaves and a tart aroma and 
flavor. It does not blend well with other herbs, so it is pri￾marily used in dishes with fruits or fatty meats such as lamb. 
Mint has an affinity for chocolate. It can also be brewed into 
a beverage or used as a garnish.
Peppermint has thin, stiff, pointed leaves and a sharper menthol 
flavor and aroma. Fresh peppermint is used less often in cooking or as a garnish than 
spearmint, but peppermint oil is a common 
flavoring in sweets and candies.
Oregano (Fr. origan), which is closely related 
to marjoram, is a pungent, peppery herb used in 
Mediterranean cuisines, particularly Greek and 
Italian, as well as in Mexican cuisine. Mexican vari￾eties of oregano tend to be mild with citrus aromas, 
while Mediterranean varieties are more pungent and 
peppery. Oregano’s thin, woody stalks bear clumps of 
tiny, dark green, rounded leaves, which are also available 
dried and crushed.
Parsley (Fr. persil) is probably the best known and most widely used herb in 
the world. It grows in almost all climates and is available in many varieties. The most 
common type in the United States and Northern Europe is curly parsley. It has small

curly leaves and a bright green color. Its flavor is tangy and clean. Other cuisines use a 
variety sometimes known as Italian parsley, which has flat leaves, a darker color and 
coarser flavor. Curly parsley is a ubiquitous garnish. Both curly and Italian types can be 
used in virtually any savory dish. Parsley stalks have a stronger flavor than the leaves 
and are part of standard bouquets garnis. Chopped parsley forms the basis of any fines 
herbes blend.
Rosemary (Fr. romarin) is an evergreen bush that grows wild in 
warm, dry climates worldwide. It has stiff, needlelike leaves; some 
varieties bear pale blue flowers. It is highly aromatic, with a 
slight odor of camphor or pine. Rosemary is best used 
fresh. When dried, it loses flavor and its leaves 
become very hard and unpleasant to chew. Whole 
rosemary stems may be added to a dish such as a 
stew and removed when enough flavor has been 
imparted. They may also be added to bouquets 
 garnis. Rosemary has a great affinity for roasted and grilled meats, 
especially lamb, but it must be used sparingly because its strong flavor 
can easily overwhelm.
Sage (Fr. sauge) was used as a medicine for centuries before it entered the kitchen as 
a culinary herb. Culinary sage has narrow, fuzzy, gray-green leaves and blue flowers. Its 
flavor is strong and balsamic, with notes of camphor. Sage is used in poultry dishes, with 
fatty meats or brewed as a beverage. It may be deep fried as a garnish in Italian cuisine. 
Sage’s strong flavor does not blend well with other herbs. It dries well and is available in 
whole or chopped leaves or rubbed (coarsely ground).
Savory (Fr. sariette) has also been used since ancient times. Its leaves are small and 
narrow, and it has a sharp, bitter flavor, vaguely like thyme. It dries well and is used 
in bean dishes, sausages and fines herbes blend. Although the variety called summer 
savory is most common and popular, a variety called winter savory is also available.
Tarragon (Fr. estragon), another of the great culinary herbs, 
is native to Siberia. It is a bushy plant with long, nar￾row, dark green leaves and tiny gray flowers. Tarragon 
goes well with fish, poultry and tomatoes and is essential 
in many French dishes such as béarnaise sauce and 
fines herbes blend. Its flavor is strong and diffuses 
quickly through foods. Tarragon is available dried, but 
drying may cause hay-like flavors to develop.
Thyme (Fr. thym) has been popular since 3500 bce, 
when Egyptians used it as a medicine and in embalming. 
Thyme is a small, bushy plant with woody stems, tiny 
green-gray leaves and purple flowers. Its flavor is 
strong but refined, with notes of sage. Thyme dries 
well and complements virtually all types of meat, 
poultry, fish, shellfish and vegetables. It is often 
included in bouquets garnis or added to stocks.
Spices
Aleppo pepper [ah-LEHP-oh] is made from bright red chiles 
grown in Turkey and northern Syria. The sun-dried Aleppo 
chiles are seeded and crushed, then used as a condiment. 
Also known as Halaby pepper, Aleppo pepper adds a 
Mediterranean flavor and fragrance to foods. It has a sharp, 
but sweet, fruity flavor, with only mild heat. Although it is a 
member of the Capsicum or hot chile pepper family, Aleppo

Allspice (Fr. quatre-épices), also known as Jamaican pepper, is the dried berry of 
a tree that flourishes in Jamaica. It is one of the few spices still grown exclusively in 
the Americas. Allspice is available whole, in berries that look like large, rough, brown 
peppercorns, and ground. Ground allspice is pure allspice not a mixture of spices, 
although it does taste like a blend of cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg. Allspice is now 
used throughout the world, in everything from cakes to curries, and is often included 
in peppercorn blends.
Anise (Fr. anis) is native to the eastern Mediterranean, where it was widely used 
by ancient civilizations. Today it is grown commercially in warm climates throughout 
India, North Africa and southern Europe. The tiny, gray-green egg-shaped seeds have a 
distinctively strong, sweet flavor, similar to licorice and fennel. When anise seeds turn 
brown, they are stale and should be discarded. Anise is used in pastries as well as fish, 
shellfish and vegetable dishes and is also commonly used in alcoholic beverages (e.g., 
Pernod and ouzo). The green leaves of the anise plant are occasionally used fresh as an 
herb or in salads.
Star anise, also known as Chinese anise, is the dried, star-shaped fruit of a Chinese 
magnolia tree. Although it is botanically unrelated, its flavor is similar to anise seeds but 
more bitter and pungent. Used both whole and ground, it is an essential flavor in many 
Chinese dishes and one of the components of Chinese five spice powder.
Annatto seeds are the small, brick-red triangular seeds of a shrub grown in South 
America and the Caribbean. Annatto seeds add a mild, peppery flavor to rice, fish and 
shellfish dishes and are crushed to make Mexican achiote paste. Because they impart a 
bright yellow-orange color to foods, annatto seeds are commonly used as a natural food 
coloring, especially in cheeses and margarine.
Asafetida [ah-sah-FEH-teh-dah; also spelled asafoetida] is a pale brown resin made 
from the sap of a giant fennel-like plant native to India and Iran. It has a garlicky flavor 
and a strong unpleasant fetid aroma (the aroma does not transfer to food being fla￾vored). Available powdered or in lump form, it is used—very sparingly—as a flavoring 
in Indian and Middle Eastern cuisines.
Capers (Fr. capres) come from a small bush that grows wild 
throughout the Mediterranean basin. The bushes’ unopened 
flower buds have been pickled and used as a condiment for 
thousands of years. Fresh capers are not used, as the desired 
sharp, salty-sour flavor develops only after curing in salt or 
strongly salted white vinegar. The finest capers are the smallest, 
known as nonpareils, which are produced in France’s Provence 
region. Capers are used in a variety of sauces (e.g., tartare,

The European Spice Trade
Spices have been used for many purposes for 
thousands of years. Egyptian documents dating 
back to 2800 bce identify several spices native 
to the Middle and Far East that were used by 
the ruling and priestly classes for therapeutic, 
cosmetic, medicinal, ritualistic and culinary 
purposes. By 300 ce the Romans were regularly 
importing spices for use as perfumes, medicines, 
preservatives and ingredients from China and 
India via long, difficult journeys over sea and 
land. Spices were extremely expensive and 
unavailable to all but the wealthiest citizens.
After Rome fell in the second half of the 
fifth century ce, much of the overland trade 
route through southern Europe became prey 
to bandits; after Constantinople fell in 1453, 
the Ottoman Turks controlled the spice routes 
through the Middle East. Spice costs soared 
and economies based on the spice trade, such 
as that of Venice, were at risk.
By then highly spiced food had become 
common, especially in wealthier households. 
In part to maintain their culinary norm, the 
Europeans set out to break the Ottoman Turk 
monopoly. These efforts led to Columbus’s 
exploration of the Americas and Vasco da Gama’s 
discovery of a sea route to India. Although the 
Americas contained none of the spices for which 
Columbus was searching, it did provide many 
previously unknown foods and flavorings that 
changed European tables forever, including chiles, 
vanilla, tomatoes, potatoes and chocolate.
Formation of the dutch East India Company 
in 1602 marked the start of the dutch colonial 
empire and made spices from what is now 
Indonesia, whose Molucca Islands were once 
referred to as the “Spice Islands,” widely 
available to the growing European middle 
classes. The transplantation and cultivation 
of spice plants eventually weakened the once￾powerful trading empires. By the 19th century, 
no European country monopolized the spice 
trade, and prices fell dramatically.

rémoulade) and are excellent with fish and game. Capers keep for long periods in their 
original curing liquid. Do not add or substitute vinegar, however, as this causes the 
capers to spoil. Soak salted capers in several changes of water before using.
Caraway (Fr. carvi) is perhaps the world’s oldest spice. Its use has been traced 
to the Stone Age, and seeds have been found in ancient Egyptian tombs. The cara￾way plant grows wild in Europe and temperate regions of Asia. It produces a small, 
 crescent-shaped brown seed with an earthy, peppery and anise-like flavor. Caraway 
seeds may be purchased whole or ground. (The leaves have a mild, bland flavor and are 
rarely used in cooking.) Caraway is used extensively in German and Austrian dishes, par￾ticularly breads, meats and cabbage. It is also used in alcoholic beverages and cheeses.
Cardamom (Fr. cardamome) is one of the most expensive spices, 
second only to saffron in cost. Cardamom seeds are encased in 
¼-inch- (6-millimeter-) long light green or brown pods. Cardamom 
is highly aromatic. Its flavor, lemony with notes of camphor, 
is quite strong and is used in both sweet and savory dishes. 
Cardamom is common in foods from India and the Middle 
East, where it is also used to flavor coffee. Scandinavians use 
cardamom to flavor breads and pastries. Ground cardamom loses 
its flavor rapidly and is easily adulterated, so it is best to purchase 
whole seeds and grind your own as needed.
Chiles, including paprika, chile peppers, bell peppers and cayenne, are members of 
the Capsicum plant family. Although cultivated for thousands of years in the West Indies 
and Americas, capsicum peppers were unknown in the rest of the world prior to Spanish 
explorations during the 15th century. Capsicum peppers come in all shapes and sizes, 
with a wide range of flavors, from sweet to extremely hot. Some capsicums are used as 
a vegetable; others are dried, ground and used as a spice. Fresh chiles and bell peppers 
are discussed in Chapter 22, Vegetables. Capsicums are botanically unrelated to Piper 
nigrum, the black peppercorns discussed on page 141.
Cayenne, sometimes simply labeled “red pepper,” is ground from a blend of several 
particularly hot types of dried red chile peppers. Its flavor is extremely hot and pungent; 
it has a bright orange-red color and fine texture.
Paprika, also known as Hungarian pepper, is a bright red powder ground from 
specific varieties of red-ripened and dried chiles. Paprika’s flavor ranges from sweet to 
pungent; its aroma is distinctive and strong. It is essential to many eastern European and 
Spanish dishes in which an oak-smoked version called pimentón is used. Mild paprika is 
often used generously and may be sprinkled on prepared foods as a garnish.
Chile powders are made from pure dried chiles that are simply roasted, ground and 
sieved. A wide variety of dried chile peppers are processed this way, creating powders 
that range from sweet and mild to extremely hot and pungent. Commercial chilli pow￾der, a North American invention, is actually a combination of spices—oregano, cumin, 
garlic and other flavorings—intended for use in stews and Mexican dishes. Each brand of 
commercial chilli powder is different and should be sampled before using.
Crushed chiles, also known as chile flakes, are blended from dried, crushed chiles. 
They are quite hot and are used in sauces, soups and meat dishes and sprinkled on pizza 
for an extra spiciness.
Cinnamon (Fr. cannelle) and its cousin cassia are among the oldest known spices: 
Cinnamon’s use is recorded in China as early as 2500 bce, and the Far East still produces 
most of the cinnamon and cassia consumed worldwide. Both cinnamon and cassia come 
from the bark of small evergreen trees, peeled from branches in thin layers and dried in 
the sun. High-quality cinnamon should be pale brown and thin, rolled up like paper into 
sticks known as quills. Cassia is coarser and has a stronger, less subtle flavor than cin￾namon. Consequently it is cheaper than true cinnamon. Cinnamon is usually purchased 
ground because it is difficult to grind. Cinnamon sticks are used when long cooking 
times allow for sufficient flavor to be extracted (e.g., in stews or curries). Cinnamon’s 
flavor is most often associated with pastries and sweets, but it also has a great affinity for 
lamb and spicy dishes.

Cloves (Fr. clous de girofle) are the unopened buds of evergreen trees that flourish in 
muggy tropical regions. When dried, whole cloves have hard, sharp prongs that can be 
pushed into other foods, such as onions or fruit, to provide flavor. Cloves are extremely 
pungent, with a sweet, astringent aroma. A small amount provides a great deal of flavor. 
Cloves are used in desserts, meat dishes, preserves and liquors. They 
may be purchased whole or ground.
Coriander (Fr. coriandre) seeds come from the same plant as the 
herb cilantro. They are round and beige, with a distinctive sweet, 
spicy flavor and strong aroma. Unlike other plants in which the 
seeds and the leaves share the same flavor and aroma, corian￾der and cilantro are very different. Coriander seeds are available 
whole or ground and are frequently used in Indian cuisine and 
pickling mixtures.
Cumin is the seed of a small delicate plant of the parsley family that originally grew 
in North Africa and the Middle East. The small seeds are available whole or ground and 
look (but do not taste) like caraway seeds. Cumin has a strong earthy flavor and tends to 
dominate any dish in which it is included. It is used in Indian, Middle Eastern, Mexican 
and Latin American cuisines, and also in some European sausages.
Fennel (Fr. fenouil) is a perennial plant with feathery leaves and tiny flowers long 
cultivated in India and China as a medicine and used in Medieval times to protect against 
evil spirits. Its seeds are greenish brown with prominent ridges and short, hairlike fibers. 
Their taste and aroma are similar to anise, though not as sweet. Whole fennel seeds are 
widely used in Italian stews and sausages; central European cuisines use fennel with fish, 
pork, pickles and vegetables. Ground seeds can also be used in breads, cakes and cook￾ies. The same plant produces a bulbous stalk used as a vegetable.
Fenugreek (Fr. fenugrec), grown in Mediterranean countries since ancient times, is 
a small, bean-like plant with a tiny flower. Fenugreek seeds, available whole or ground, 
are pebble shaped and transfer their pale orange color to the foods with which they are 
cooked. Their flavor is bittersweet, like burnt sugar or maple syrup with a bitter after￾taste. Fenugreek is a staple in Indian cuisines, especially curries and chutneys.
Filé powder [fee-LAY] is the dried, ground leaf of the sassafras plant. Long used by 
Choctaw Indians, it is now most commonly used as a thickener and flavoring in Cajun 
and Creole cuisines. Filé is also used as a table condiment to add a spicy note to stews, 
gumbo and the like. The powder forms strings if allowed to boil; to prevent this, it 
should be added during the last minutes of cooking.
Galangal [guh-LANG-guhl] is the rhizome of a plant native to India and Southeast 
Asia. The rhizome has a reddish skin, an orange or whitish flesh and a peppery, 
 ginger-like flavor and piney aroma. Also known as galanga root, Thai ginger and Laos 
ginger, it is peeled and crushed for use in Thai and Indonesian cuisines. Fresh ginger is 
an appropriate substitute.
Ginger (Fr. gingembre) is obtained from the rhizome of a tall, flowering tropical plant. 
Fresh ginger (also known as ginger root) is known as a “hand” because it looks vaguely like 
a group of knobby fingers. It has grayish-tan skin and a pale yellow, fibrous interior. Fresh 
ginger should be plump and firm with smooth skin. It should keep for about a month under 
refrigeration. Its flavor is fiery but sweet, with notes of lemon and rosemary. Fresh ginger 
is widely available and is used in Indian and Asian cuisines. It has a special affinity for 
chicken, beef and curries. Ginger is also available peeled and pickled in vinegar, candied in 
sugar or preserved in alcohol or syrup. Dried, ground ginger is a fine yellow powder widely 
used in pastries. Its flavor is spicier and not as sweet as fresh ginger.
Grains of paradise are the seeds of a perennial reedlike plant indigenous to the West 
African coast. Related to cardamom, grains of paradise have a spicy, warm and slightly 
bitter flavor, similar to peppercorns. Grains of paradise were traditionally used in place of 
black pepper and are also known as Guinea pepper or melegueta pepper. Now enjoying 
a resurgence in popularity and increased availability, they are ground and used primarily 
in West African and Maghreb dishes and in the spice blend known as ras el hanout.
Horseradish (Fr. raifort) is the large off-white taproot of a hardy perennial (unre￾lated to radishes) that flourishes in cool climates. Fresh roots should be firm and plump;

they do not have the distinctive horseradish aroma unless cut or bruised. The outer skin 
and inner core of a fresh horseradish root can have an unpleasant flavor and should 
be discarded. Typically used in Russian and central European cuisines, especially as 
an accompaniment to roasted meats and fish and shellfish dishes, horseradish is usu￾ally served grated, creamed into a sauce or as part of a compound butter or mustard 
 preparation. If horseradish is cooked, heat can destroy its flavor and pungency, so any 
horseradish should be added near the end of cooking.
Juniper (Fr. genièvre), an evergreen bush grown throughout the Northern Hemisphere, 
produces round purple berries with a sweet flavor similar to pine. Juniper berries are 
used for flavoring gin and other alcoholic beverages and are crushed and incorporated 
in game dishes, particularly venison and wild boar.
Mustard seeds (Fr. moutarde), available in black, brown and yellow, are the seeds 
of three different plants in the cabbage family. The small, hard seeds have no aroma, but 
their flavor is sharp and fiery hot. Yellow seeds have the mildest and black seeds the 
strongest flavor. All are sold whole and can be crushed for cooking. Mustard seeds are 
a standard component of pickling spices and are processed and blended for prepared 
mustards, which we discuss on page 149. Ground or dry mustard is a bright yellow pow￾der made from a blend of ground seeds, wheat flour and turmeric.
Nutmeg (Fr. muscade) and mace come from the yellow plum￾like fruit of a large tropical evergreen. These fruits are dried and 
opened to reveal the seed, which is known as nutmeg. A bright 
red lacy coating, or aril, surrounds the seed; the aril is the spice 
mace. Whole nutmegs are oval and look like a piece of smooth 
wood. The flavor and aroma of nutmeg are strong and sweet, 
and a small quantity provides a great deal of flavor. Nutmeg should 
be grated directly into a dish as needed; once grated, flavor loss is 
rapid. Nutmeg is used in many European cuisines, mainly in pastries 
and sweets, but is also important in meat and savory dishes.
Mace is an expensive spice, with a flavor similar to nutmeg but more refined. It is 
almost always purchased ground and retains its flavor longer than other ground spices. 
Mace is used primarily in pastry items.
Peppercorns (Fr. poivre) are the berries of a vine plant (Piper nigrum) native to 
tropical Asia. Peppercorns should not be confused with the chile (Capsicum) peppers 
discussed earlier. Peppercorns vary in size, color, pungency and flavor. Many of these 
differences are the result of variations in climate and growing conditions. Good-quality 
pepper is expensive and should be purchased whole and ground fresh in a peppermill 
as needed. Whole peppercorns will last indefinitely if kept dry. They should be stored 
well-covered in a cool, dark place.
Black and white peppercorns are produced from the same plant but are picked 
and processed differently. For black peppercorns, the berries are picked when green and 
simply dried whole in the sun. Black pepper has a warm, pungent flavor and aroma. 
Tellicherry peppercorns from the southwest coast of India are generally considered the 
finest black peppercorns in the world and are priced accordingly. For white pepper￾corns, the berries are allowed to ripen until they turn red. The ripened berries are 
allowed to ferment, then the outer layer of skin is washed off. Alternatively white pepper 
may be produced by mechanically removing the outer skin from black peppercorns. This 
is not true white pepper, and the resulting product should be labeled “decorticated.” 
White pepper has fewer aromas than black pepper but is useful in white sauces or when 
the appearance of black speckles is undesirable.
Green peppercorns are unripened peppercorn berries that are either freeze-dried or 
pickled in brine or vinegar. Pickled green peppercorns are soft, with a fresh, sour flavor 
similar to capers. They are excellent in spiced butters and sauces or with fish.
Pink peppercorns (Fr. baies roses) are the berries of a South American tree in the 
cashew nut family, not a true peppercorn. Consequently people with tree nut allergies 
may also have an allergic reaction to pink peppercorns. Pink peppercorns are available 
dried or pickled in vinegar. They are attractive in peppercorn blends and their flavor is 
sweet and pine-like, with less spiciness than true pepper.

Szechuan pepper, also spelled Szechwan and Sichuan, is made from the dried red 
berries of the prickly ash tree native to China. Also known as anise pepper and Chinese 
pepper, the berries have a numbing effect on the tongue and an extremely hot, pep￾pery, spicy flavor with citrus overtones. They are used in Chinese cuisines and as part of 
Chinese five-spice powder. In Japanese cuisine, a green variety called sancho is used to 
season grilled fish and meats.
Poppy seeds (Fr. pavot) are the ripened seeds of the opium poppy, which flour￾ishes in the Middle East and India. (When ripe, the seeds do not contain any of the 
 pain-relieving medicinal properties found elsewhere in the plant.) The tiny blue-gray 
seeds are round and hard with a sweet, nutty flavor. Poppy seeds are used in pastries 
and breads.
Saffron (Fr. safran) comes from the dried stigmas of the saffron crocus. Each flower 
bears only three threadlike stigmas, and each must be picked by hand. It takes about 
250,000 flowers to produce 1 pound of saffron, making it the most expensive spice in the 
world. Beware of bargains; there is no such thing as cheap saffron. Luckily a tiny pinch 
is enough to color and flavor a large quantity of food. Good saffron should be a brilliant 
orange color, not yellow, with a strong aroma and a bitter, honey-like taste. Saffron pro￾duces a yellow dye that diffuses through any warm liquid. Valencia or Spanish saffron 
is considered the finest. It is commonly used in fish and shellfish dishes, such as bouil￾labaisse, and rice dishes, such as paella and risotto. When using saffron threads, first 
crush them gently, then soak them in hot liquid from the recipe. Powdered saffron may 
be added directly to the other ingredients when cooking. It is less expensive but more 
easily adulterated.
Sesame seeds, also known as benne seeds, are native to India. They are small, flat 
ovals, with a creamy white color. Their taste is nutty and earthy, with a pronounced 
aroma when roasted or ground into a paste (known as tahini). Sesame seeds are the 
source of sesame oil, which has a mild, nutty flavor and turns rancid easily. Sesame 
seeds are roasted and used in or as a garnish for breads and meat dishes. They are popu￾lar in Indian and Asian cuisines. A black variety of seeds is particularly popular in Korean 
and Japanese cuisines.
Sumac is a red powder made from the dried petals and berries of a 
shrub native to Turkey. It has a sour, citric flavor and is used through￾out the Middle East, especially in the spice blend known as za’atar. 
Early colonists made a beverage similar to lemonade from a variety 
of sumac they found in North America. The poisonous form of sumac is 
unrelated to the variety used as a seasoning.
Tamarind (Fr. tamarin; Sp. and It. tamarindo), also known as an Indian date, is the 
brown, bean-shaped pod of the tamarind tree, which is native to Africa. Although natu￾rally sweet, tamarind also contains 12 percent tartaric acid, which makes it extremely tart. 
It is commonly used in Indian curries and Mediterranean cooking as a souring agent and 
in the West Indies in fruit drinks. Tamarind is sold as a concentrate or in sticky blocks 
of crushed pods, pulp and seeds, which should be soaked in warm water for about 5 
minutes, then squeezed through a sieve. Tamarind’s high pectin content is useful in 
chutneys and jams, and it is often included in barbecue sauces and marinades. It is a key 
ingredient in Worcestershire sauce.
Turmeric (Fr. curcuma), also known as Indian saffron, is produced from the rhizome 
of a flowering tropical plant related to ginger. It has a mild, woodsy aroma. It is most 
often available dried and usually ground although fresh turmeric is becoming more 
widely available. Turmeric is renowned for its vibrant yellow color and is used as a food 
coloring and dye. Turmeric’s flavor is distinctive and strong; it should not be substituted 
for saffron. Turmeric is a traditional ingredient in Indian curries, to which it imparts color 
as well as flavor.
Wasabi is a pale green root similar, but unrelated, to horseradish. It has a strong 
aroma and a sharp, cleansing flavor with herbal overtones that is a bit hotter than that of 
horseradish. Fresh wasabi is rarely found outside Japan, but tins of powder and tubes of 
paste are readily available. It is commonly served with sushi and sashimi and can be used 
to add a spicy Asian note to other dishes, such as mashed potatoes or a compound butter.

Storing Herbs and Spices
Fresh herbs should be kept refrigerated at 34–40°F (2–4°C). Large bouquets can be 
stored upright, their leaves loosely covered with plastic wrap and their stems submerged 
in water. Smaller bunches should be stored loosely covered with a damp towel. Excess 
fresh herbs can be dried in an electric dehydrator or spread out on baking sheets in a 
100°F (38°C) oven.
Dried herbs and spices should be stored in airtight, opaque containers in a cool, dry 
place. Avoid light and heat, both of which destroy delicate flavors. If stored properly, 
dried herbs should last for 2 to 3 months.
Spices are generally available either whole or ground. Once ground, they lose their 
flavors rapidly, however. Whole spices should keep their flavors for at least 6–9 months 
if stored properly. To evaluate the freshness of spices, smell and taste them. Fresh spices 
should have a pronounced fresh scent. The flavor may be harsh or even unpleasant but 
it will be easily discernible. Stale spices lose their spicy aroma and develop a bitter or 
musty aftertaste. Discard them.
Using Herbs and Spices
Herbs and spices are a simple, inexpensive way to bring individuality and variety to 
foods. They add neither fat nor sodium and virtually no calories to foods; most contain 
only 3–10 calories per teaspoon. Table 7.3 lists just a few uses for some of the more com￾mon herbs and spices.

Although the flavors and aromas of fresh herbs are generally preferred, dried herbs are 
widely used because they are readily available and convenient. Use less dried herb than 
you would fresh herb. The loss of moisture strengthens and concentrates the flavor in 
dried herbs. The delicate aroma and flavors of fresh herbs is volatile. Most fresh herbs such 
as chives, parsley, cilantro, basil and tarragon are best when added at the end of cooking.
Most dried spices need to be added early in order for their flavor to develop during 
cooking. Whole spices take the longest; ground spices release their flavor more quickly. 
In some preparations, Indian curries, for example, ground spices are first bloomed by 
heating in oil to release their aromas before being added to a dish. Some dried spices 
such as black pepper may become bitter when cooked for an extended period of time, 
however. In uncooked dishes that call for ground spices (e.g., salad dressings), the mix￾ture should be allowed to stand for several hours to develop good flavor.
IDENTIFYING AND USING SALTS
Salt (Fr. sel) is the most basic seasoning, and its use is universal. It preserves foods, 
heightens their flavors and provides the distinctive taste of saltiness. The presence of 
salt can be tasted easily but not smelled. Salt suppresses bitter flavors, making the sweet 
and sour ones more prominent. The flavor of salt does not evaporate or dissipate dur￾ing cooking, so it should be added to foods carefully, in small amounts, according to 
taste. Remember, more salt can always be added to a dish, but too much salt cannot 
be removed nor can its flavor be hidden. Vegetables cooked in overly salted water may 
be improved by simmering them longer in fresh unsalted water but in most instances, 
excess salt cannot be removed from a food.
Be deliberate in your use of salt and consider the following:
	▪ Salt does not evaporate during cooking. But, as liquids reduce, salt becomes more 
concentrated. Salt foods sparingly to start.
	▪ Salt foods in small increments as you cook.
	▪ Be aware of the saltiness some ingredients contribute to a dish before adding 
additional salt. Flavorings such as soy sauce, capers, Worcestershire sauce and 
miso, as well as cured meat and fish, certain cheeses and salted butter naturally 
increase the salty flavor of a dish.
	▪ Cooks can perspire in the kitchen and therefore need more salt. Beware of this 
and do not add too much salt to a dish to satisfy your own craving for salt. 
Customers can add more salt at the table.
	▪ The temperature of food changes its perceived saltiness. A dish served cold tastes 
less salty than the same dish served hot. Adjust seasoning with the dish at the 
temperature at which it will be served.
Culinary or table salt is sodium chloride (NaCl), one of the minerals essential to 
human life. Salt contains no calories, proteins, fats or carbohydrates. It is available from 
several sources, each with its own flavor and degree of saltiness.
Rock salt, mined from underground deposits, is available in both edible and noned￾ible forms. It is used in ice cream churns, for thawing frozen sidewalks and, in edible 
form, in salt mills.
Common kitchen salt—often referred to as table salt—is produced by pumping 
water through underground salt deposits, then bringing the brine to the surface to 
evaporate. This process leaves behind crystals. Chemicals are usually added to prevent 
table salt from absorbing moisture and keep it free-flowing. Iodized salt is commonly 
used in the United States. The iodine has no effect on the salt’s flavor or use; it is added 
as an easily available source of iodine, an important nutrient that the body requires in 
small amounts.
Kosher salt has large, irregular crystals and is used in “koshering” or curing meats. 
It is purified rock salt that contains no iodine or additives. It can be substituted for com￾mon kitchen salt in recipes. Some chefs prefer it to table salt because they prefer its 
flavor and it dissolves more easily than other salts.
Substituting Dried 
Herbs for Fresh Herbs
In general, use only one-half to one-third
as much dried herb as fresh in any given 
recipe. For example, if a recipe calls for 
1 tablespoon of fresh basil, substitute 
only 1 teaspoon of dried basil. More can 
usually be added later if necessary.

Seasoned salts are commercially blended products containing salt and one or more 
flavoring ingredients such as garlic, spices or seeds and, sometimes, monosodium gluta￾mate (MSG). Chefs also create their own seasoned salt blends from sea salt and spices to 
consistently give restaurant dishes the desired flavor profile.
Sea salt is obtained by evaporating seawater. The evaporation can be done by dry￾ing the salt in the sun (unrefined sea salt) or by boiling the salty liquid (refined sea 
salt). Unlike other table salts, unrefined sea salt contains additional mineral salts such as 
magnesium, calcium and potassium, which give it a stronger, more complex flavor and a 
grayish-brown color. The region where unrefined sea salt is produced can also affect its 
flavor and color. For example, salt from the Mediterranean Sea tastes different from salt 
from the Indian Ocean or the English Channel. Sea salt is considerably more expensive 
than other table salts and is often reserved for finishing a dish or used as a condiment.
Sel gris is a sea salt harvested off the coast of Normandy, France. It is slightly wet 
and takes its gray color from minerals in the clay from which it is collected. Fleur de sel, 
which means “flower of salt,” is salt that collects on rocks in the sel gris marshes. It forms 
delicate crystals and has little color because it has not come into contact with the clay.
Some specialty salts are mined from the earth, such as that from the foothills of the 
Himalayan Mountains. The presence of iron and copper along with other minerals gives 
Himalayan salt a pink hue and distinct flavor. Black salt (kala namak), common in 
traditional Indian recipes, is mined rock salt; minerals and other components in the salt 
impart a dark color and sulfurous taste. Smoked salt is a flavored salt made by smoking 
the salt over a smoldering fire. It can also be made by adding liquid smoke to a salt solu￾tion. With their distinctive appearance and texture, specialty salts are often used to finish 
dishes before serving and may be referred to as finishing salts.
Salt keeps indefinitely. It will, however, absorb moisture from the atmosphere, which 
prevents it from flowing properly. Salt is a powerful preservative. Its presence stops or 
greatly slows down the growth of many undesirable microorganisms, and it is used to 
preserve meats, vegetables and fish. It is also used to develop desirable flavors in bacon, 
ham, cheeses and fish products, as well as pickled vegetables.
IDENTIFYING AND USING OILS
Oils (Fr. huiles) are fats that remains liquid at room temperature. Cooking oils are refined 
from various seeds, plants and vegetables. (Other fats, such as butter and margarine, are 
discussed in Chapter 8, Dairy Products; fats for deep-frying are discussed in Chapter 10, 
Principles of Cooking.) They are included here as flavorings because each oil, along with 
its cooking properties, has specific flavor and aroma characteristics that should be con￾sidered when choosing an oil as a cooking medium or as an ingredient.
Cooking fats, including oils and shortenings, are manufactured for specific purposes 
such as deep-frying, cake baking, dressing salads and sautéing. Most food service oper￾ations purchase different fats for each of these needs. Fats break down at different 
 temperatures. When fats break down, their chemical structure is altered; the molecules 
that make up fat are converted into individual fatty acids. These acids add undesirable 
flavors to the fat and can ruin the flavor of the food being cooked. The temperature at 
which a given fat begins to break down and smoke is known as its smoke point. When 
purchasing oils, consider their use, smoke point and cost. Choose fats with higher smoke 
points for high-temperature cooking such as deep-frying and sautéing.
In addition to its smoke point, the flavor and cost of each oil must be considered. For 
example, both corn oil and walnut oil can be used in a salad dressing. Their selection 
may depend on balancing cost (corn oil is less expensive) against flavor (walnut oil has 
a stronger, more distinctive flavor).
When fats spoil, they are said to go rancid. Rancidity is a chemical change caused 
by exposure to oxygen. It results in objectionable flavors and odors, but will not, by 
itself, cause illness. Different fats deteriorate and become rancid at different rates, but 
all fats benefit from refrigerated storage away from heat, light and oxygen. (Some oils 
are packaged in colored glass containers because certain tints of green and yellow block 
shortening (1) a white, flavorless, solid fat 
formulated for baking or deep-frying; (2) any 
fat used in baking to tenderize doughs by

damaging light rays.) Although oils may become thick and cloudy under refrigeration, 
this is not a cause for concern. The oils will return to their clear, liquid state at room tem￾perature. Stored fats should also be well covered to prevent them from absorbing odors.
Vegetable oils are extracted from a variety of plants, including corn, cottonseed, 
peanuts, grape seeds and soybeans, by pressure or chemical solvents. The oil is 
refined—cleaned to remove unwanted colors, odors or flavors. Vegetable oils are virtu￾ally odorless and have a neutral flavor. Because they contain no animal products, they 
are cholesterol-free. If a commercial product contains only one type of oil, it is labeled 
“pure” (as in “pure corn oil”). Products labeled “vegetable oil” are blended from several 
sources. Products labeled “salad oil” are highly refined blends of vegetable oil.
Canola oil is processed from rapeseeds. It is a healthful cooking oil because it con￾tains no cholesterol and has a high percentage of monounsaturated fat. Canola oil is 
useful for frying and general cooking because it has no flavor and a high smoke point.
Nut oils are extracted from a variety of nuts and are almost always 
packaged as “pure” products, never blended. A nut oil should have 
the strong flavor and aroma of the nut from which it was processed. 
Popular examples are walnut and hazelnut oils. These oils are used 
to give flavor to salad dressings, marinades and other dishes. Heat 
diminishes their flavor, so nut oils are not recommended for fry￾ing or baking. Nut oils tend to go rancid quickly and therefore are 
usually packaged in small containers. Peanut oil is an exception to 
these statements, however. Peanut oil is virtually tasteless and its high 
smoke point makes it a good choice for frying. Peanut oil can trigger allergic reactions 
for anyone with a sensitivity to peanuts as discussed in Chapter 3, Nutrition and Healthy 
Cooking, and its use must be noted on product labels.
Olive oil (Fr. huile d’olive) is extracted from olive fruits and is produced primarily in 
Spain, Italy, France, Greece and North Africa; California produces a relatively minor 
amount of olive oil. Olive oils vary in color and flavor according to the variety of 
tree, the ripeness of the fruit, the type of soil, the climate and the producer’s pref￾erences. Colors range from dark green to almost clear, depending on the ripeness 
of the olives at the time of pressing and the amount of subsequent refining. Color 
is not a good indication of flavor, however. Flavor is ultimately a matter of per￾sonal preference. Stronger-flavored oil may be desired for some foods, whereas 
milder oil is better for others. Good olive oil should be thicker than refined veg￾etable oils, but not so thick that it has a fatty texture.
The label designations—extra virgin, virgin and pure—refer to the percentage of free 
fatty acid in the oil (a low acid content is preferable) and the extent of processing used 
to extract the oil. The first cold-pressing of the olives results in virgin oil. (The designa￾tion “virgin” is used only when the oil is 100 percent unadulterated olive oil, unheated 
and without any chemical processing.) Virgin oil may still vary in quality depending on 
the amount of free fatty oleic acid present. Extra virgin olive oil is virgin oil with less than 
0.8 percent acidity; virgin oil may have up to 2 percent acidity. Olive oil labelled “pure” 
is processed from the pulp left after the first pressing using heat and chemicals. Pure 
oil is lighter in flavor and less expensive than virgin oil. Light olive oil has been further 
refined with heat to give it a lighter color and a more neutral flavor, but it is not lighter 
in calories or fat. It has a slightly higher smoke point than other olive oils, but some 
nutrients are lost during refinement.
Sesame oil is produced from the seeds of a large annual herb native to India. The 
tiny seeds range from white to tan to black, depending on the variety. The oil has a 
nutty, slightly bitter flavor, which becomes even more pronounced when the seeds are 
toasted prior to pressing for oil. Toasted sesame oil is used as a condiment or flavoring 
oil in China, Japan and Korea. The milder oil pressed from raw seeds is used for baking 
and cooking in Mediterranean, Jewish and Indian cuisine.
Flavored oils, also known as infused oils, are popular condiments used as a dip 
for breads, a cooking medium or a flavoring accent in marinades, dressings, sauces or 
other dishes. Flavors used include garlic, citrus, basil and other herbs. Flavored oils

are generally prepared with olive oil or canola oil, which are both considered more 
healthful than other fats. Top-quality flavored oils are prepared by extracting aromatic 
oils from the flavoring ingredients and then blending them with a high-grade oil. 
Aromatic oils yield a more intense flavor than oils in which a flavoring ingredient is 
simply steeped.
Another category of flavored oils is the spicy chile oil used in Asian cuisines. It is 
made by infusing crushed dried chiles into an oil such as canola or soybean. The chiles 
may be strained out or left with the oil, in which case they will settle to the bottom of 
the container. Chile crisps are thicker, crunchy oils originally offered in restaurants as 
a house-made condiment. First marketed commercially by the Chinese company Lao 
Gan Ma in 1997, these oil-based sauces contain a high ratio of dried chiles and other 
crunchy, savory ingredients such as sesame seeds, peppercorns, dried mushrooms, fried 
garlic and fried onion. Chile oils and crisps are used to add a Sichuan flavor profile to 
both Asian and non-Asian dishes.
IDENTIFYING AND USING VINEGARS
Vinegar (Fr. vinaigre) is a thin, sour liquid used for thousands of years as a preservative, 
cooking ingredient, condiment and cleaning solution. Vinegar is obtained through the 
fermentation of wine, beer, fruits or grains. Bacteria attack the alcohol in the solution, 
turning it into acetic acid. No alcohol remains when the transformation is complete. The 
quality of vinegar depends on the quality of the wine or other fermented liquid. Vinegar 
flavors are as varied as the liquids from which they are made.
Vinegars should be clear and clean looking, although unfiltered, unpasteurized cider 
vinegar may appear cloudy. Commercial vinegars are pasteurized, so an unopened bottle 
should last indefinitely in a cool, dark place. Once opened, vinegars should last about 
3 months if tightly capped. Any sediment that develops can be strained out, but if mold 
develops, discard the vinegar. The acid in vinegar reacts with metal. When cooking with 
vinegar, use nonreactive cookware lined with stainless steel. Store foods made with vin￾egar in stainless steel, glass, enamel or plastic containers.
Wine vinegars may be made from white or red wine, sherry or even Champagne 
and should have the color and flavor hallmarks of the wine used. Wine vinegars are pre￾ferred in French and Mediterranean cuisines.
Malt vinegar is produced from malted barley. It has a slightly sweet, mild flavor and 
is used as a condiment, especially with fried foods.
Distilled vinegar, made from grain alcohol, is completely clear with a stronger 
vinegary flavor and higher acid content than other vinegars. It is preferred for pickling 
and preserving.
Cider vinegar is produced from unpasteurized apple juice or cider. It is pale brown 
in color with a mild acidity and fruity aroma. Cider vinegar is particularly popular in the 
United States for salad dressings and pickling.
Rice vinegar is a clear, slightly sweet product brewed from rice wine. Its flavor is 
clean and elegant, making it useful in a variety of dishes, especially in Asian cuisines.
Flavored vinegars are vinegars in which herbs, spices, fruits or other foods are 
steeped. Flavored vinegars are easily produced from commercial wine or distilled 
 vinegars, using any desired herb, spice or fruit. Inferior flavored vinegars are made by 
adding flavoring to low-grade vinegar.
Balsamic vinegar (It. aceto balsamico) has been produced in Italy for more than 
800 years. To produce traditional balsamic vinegar, red or white wine made from 
specially cultivated grapes (white Trebbiano and red Lambrusco grapes among oth￾ers) is reduced, then aged in a succession of wooden barrels made from a variety of 
woods—oak, cherry, locust, ash, mulberry and juniper—for at least 4 years. The best 
quality traditional balsamic is aged for at least 12, but sometimes up to 50, years. The 
resulting liquid is dark reddish-brown and sweet. Balsamic vinegar has a high acid 
level, but the sweetness covers the tart flavor, making it very mellow. True balsamic

is extremely expensive because of the long aging process and the small quantities 
available. Most of the commercial products imported from Italy are now made by a 
quick caramelization and flavoring process. (White balsamic vinegar is cooked under 
pressure and aged for a shorter time to retain a light color and flavor.) Balsamic is 
excellent as a condiment or seasoning and has a remarkable affinity for tomatoes 
and strawberries.
IDENTIFYING AND USING CONDIMENTS
Strictly speaking, a condiment is any food added to a dish for flavor, including 
herbs, spices and vinegars. Today, however, condiments more often refer to cooked 
or prepared flavorings, such as prepared mustards, relishes, bottled sauces and 
pickles served to accompany foods. These staples may be used to alter or enhance 
the flavor of a dish during cooking or added to a completed dish 
at the table by the diner.
Chipotle in adobo is a Latin American seasoning made from 
smoked jalapeño peppers (chipotles) cooked in a tomato, onion 
and spice purée. It is used as a rub or as an ingredient in sauces.
Chutney (from the Hindi word for “catnip”) is a pungent relish
made from fruits, spices and herbs that is frequently used in Indian 
cuisine.

From Your Grocer’s Shelf
Even the most sophisticated food service 
operation occasionally uses some prepared 
condiments or flavorings. The products 
listed here are widely available from grocery 
stores or wholesale purveyors. Some are 
brand-name items that have become almost 
synonymous with the product itself; others 
are available from several manufacturers. 
When there is a choice, select brands with 
all natural ingredients, few thickeners and 
no preservatives.
Barbecue sauce: Commercial barbecue sauce 
is a mixture of tomatoes, vinegar and 
spices used primarily for marinating or 
basting meat, poultry or fish. A tremendous 
variety of barbecue sauces are available, 
with various flavors, textures and aromas. 
Sample several before selecting the most 
appropriate for your specific needs.
Chile sauce: Asian chile sauce, also known 
as sambal or sambal oelek, varies depending 
on the country of origin or style, but all 
are thick, reddish-orange and extremely 
pungent and spicy. They usually contain 
ground chiles with garlic or onion. Asian 
cuisines use these bottled sauces in 
curries, soups, stews and other dishes 
and as table condiments. One of the most 
popular and widely available brands is 
the Vietnamese-style chile garlic sauce 
with a rooster logo on its label, made in 
California by Huy Fong Foods. Various 
imported Sriracha sauces, named for a 
port town in southern Thailand, are also 
widely available.
Hoisin sauce: Hoisin sauce is a dark, thick, 
salty-sweet sauce made from fermented 
soybeans, vinegar, garlic and caramel. It 
is used in Chinese dishes or served as a 
dipping sauce.
Old Bay Seasoning: Old Bay is a dry spice 
blend containing celery salt, dry mustard, 
paprika and other flavorings. It is widely 
used in shellfish preparations, especially 
boiled shrimp and crab.
Oyster sauce: Oyster sauce is a thick, dark 
sauce made from oyster extract. It has a 
salty-sweet flavor and a rich aroma. Oyster 
sauce is often used with stir-fried meats and 
poultry in Chinese cuisine.
Pickapeppa brand sauce: Pickapeppa sauce is 
a dark, thick, sweet-hot blend of tomatoes, 
onions, sugar, vinegar, mango, raisins, tamarind 
and spices. Produced in Jamaica, it is used as 
a condiment for meat, game or fish and as a 
seasoning in sauces, soups and dressings.
Tabasco brand sauce: Tabasco sauce is a thin, 
bright-red liquid blended from vinegar, 
chiles and salt. Its fiery flavor is widely used 
in sauces, soups and prepared dishes; it is a 
popular condiment for Mexican, southern 
and southwestern cuisines. Tabasco sauce has 
been produced in louisiana since 1868. Other 
“louisiana-style” hot sauces (containing only 
peppers, vinegar and salt) may be substituted.
Worcestershire sauce: Worcestershire sauce 
is a thin, dark brown liquid made from a 
variety of fermented ingredients including 
anchovies, malt vinegar, tamarind, molasses 
and spices. It is used as a condiment for 
beef and as a seasoning for sauces, soups, 
stews and prepared dishes. Its flavor should 
be rich and full, but not salty. Vegetarian 
and kosher versions made without 
anchovies are also available.

Gochujang
Fermented black bean sauce is a Chinese condiment and flavoring ingredient made 
from black soybeans that have been heavily salted, then fermented and either slightly 
mashed (whole bean sauce) or puréed (paste). Both versions usually include hoisin, 
chile sauce or minced garlic and feature an intense, pungent, salty flavor. Yellow bean 
sauces are similar, but milder and sweeter.
Fish sauce (Viet. nuoc mam; Th. nam pla) is the liquid drained from fermenting 
salted anchovy-like fish. It is a thin, golden to light brown liquid with a very pungent 
odor and salty flavor. There is no substitute for the savory richness that it adds to food, 
and it is considered an essential flavoring and condiment throughout Southeast Asia, 
where it is used in and served with most every sort of dish.
Gochujang [go-choo-JANG] is a paste made from finely ground dried Korean red 
peppers (gochugaru), glutinous (sticky) rice flour, fermented soybean flour, salt and a 
bit of sugar or honey. It is used in stews, in marinades, as a condiment 
for simple rice and noodle dishes and as a dipping sauce, sometimes 
mixed with Korean fermented bean paste (doenjang), for grilled 
meats. Considered one of the primary flavors of Korean cuisine, 
gochujang is fiery hot with sweet, rich, mildly fermented notes. 
No other chile paste can be substituted for its distinctive flavor. 
Many commercial brands are widely available; the best do not 
contain any artificial colors, MSG, cornstarch or other thickeners.
Tomato ketchup (also known as catsup or catchup) originally referred to any salty 
extract from fish, fruits or vegetables. Prepared tomato ketchup is a sauce created in the 
United States and used worldwide as a flavoring ingredient or condiment. It is bright red 
and thick, with a tangy, sweet-sour flavor. Ketchup can be stored either in the refrigerator 
or at room temperature; it should keep well for up to 4 months after opening. Ketchup 
does not turn rancid or develop mold, but it does darken and lose flavor as it ages.
Prepared mustard is a mixture of crushed mustard seeds, vinegar or wine and salt 
or spices. It can be flavored in many ways—with herbs, onions, peppers and even citrus 
zest. It can be a smooth paste or coarse and chunky, depending on how finely the seeds 
are ground and whether the skins are strained out. Prepared mustard gets its tangy flavor 
from an essential oil that forms only when the seeds are crushed and mixed with water. 
Prepared mustard is used as a condiment, particularly with meat and charcuterie items, 
and as a flavoring ingredient in sauces, stews and marinades.
Dijon mustard takes its name from a town and the surrounding region in France that 
produces about half of the world’s mustard. French mustard labeled “Dijon” must, by 
law, be produced only in that region. Dijon and Dijon-style mustards are smooth with a 
rich, complex flavor.
English and Chinese mustards are made from mustard flour and cool water. They are 
extremely hot and powerful. The United States’ common “ballpark” mustard is mild and 
vinegary with a bright yellow color. Unless it contains a high percentage of oil, mustard 
never really spoils; its flavor just fades away. Because of its high acid content, mustard 
is not prone to rancidity, but it does oxidize and develop a dark surface crust. Once 
opened, mustard should be kept well-covered and refrigerated.
Soy sauce is a thin, dark brown liquid fermented from cooked soybeans, wheat 
and salt. Available in several flavors and strengths, it is ubiquitous in most Asian cui￾sines. Light soy sauce is thin, with a light brown color and a very salty flavor. Dark soy 
sauce is thicker and dark brown, with a sweet, less salty flavor. Tamari is a Japanese￾style soy sauce made without wheat, although its name may be applied to a variety 
of Japanese-style soy sauces. Essential in many Asian dishes, soy sauce is also used in 
marinades and sauces and as an all-purpose condiment. Other common soy-based con￾diments include teriyaki sauce and fermented bean paste (miso), made by fermenting 
soybeans with a grain such as rice or barley.
Tahini is a thick, oily paste made of ground sesame seeds. It is slightly grainy, with 
an ivory to grayish-tan color. Tahini can be bland or salty, depending on the manufac￾turer. Its toasted, nutty flavor is common in Middle Eastern and Mediterranean cuisine, 
especially in sauces and spreads such as hummus. Tahini is also useful in vegetarian 
dishes and is relatively high in protein and vitamins.

 IDENTIFYING AND COOKING WITH WINES, BEERS 
AND DISTILLED SPIRITS 
Wines , beers , brandies , liquors and liqueurs are frequently used in the kitchen as fla￾vorings or as a primary ingredient. In some dishes, an alcoholic beverage even serves as 
a cooking medium (e.g., pears poached in red wine). All alcoholic beverages begin with 
fermentation. Fermentation is a natural process in which yeasts consume sugars and, in 
the absence of oxygen, produce carbon dioxide and ethyl alcohol. (See Figure 7. 3 .) This 
process also creates many of the flavors and aromas associated with these beverages. 
Fermented beverages—wines and beers—are often used to flavor and tenderize foods 
in marinades, to add flavor during or at the end of cooking, and to deglaze a sauté pan 
for a sauce. 
 Distilled spirits are made by heating a fermented liquid (made from grain or fruit) 
to evaporate water and remove impurities, thus distilling or concentrating the alcohol 
content. Distilled liquors such as rum, brandy and whiskey, can be used in cooking for 
their own distinctive flavors or to blend with other flavors such as chocolate and cof￾fee. Liqueurs, which are distilled and sweetened, are selected for their specific flavors: 
amaretto for almond, Kahlúa for coffee, crème de cassis for black currant. They are used 
either to add flavors or to enhance other flavors in a dish. For example, brandy, espe￾cially the classic, orange-flavored Grand Marnier, is a common bakeshop flavoring that 
can complement fruit and round off the flavors of custards and creams. 
 Because alcoholic beverages are used as flavorings, general information about them 
is included here. Brief guidelines for choosing appropriate alcoholic beverages as flavor￾ings, as well as guidelines on how to use them in the kitchen, are also included. The 
art of pairing wine and beer with food or creating beverages with spirits is beyond the 
scope of this text. As with other flavoring ingredients, patience, research, experimenta￾tion and practice will help develop an understanding for which beverage—and how 
much—will best enhance a specific dish. 
 Wines 
 Wine is naturally fermented fruit juice. Its history spans over 8000 years and its produc￾tion and consumption affected ancient and modern cultures around the world. Most wine 
is made from one or more of the many varieties in the Vitis vinifera family of grapes. 
The most popular red wine varietals, or types, of grapes are Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, 
Pinot Noir, Syrah and Sangiovese. Popular white wine varietals include Chardonnay, 
Riesling, Pinot Grigio and Sauvignon Blanc. Other fruits and honey are used for making 
wine as well; however, these wines are generally sweeter and are not as popular today 
as those made from the classic wine grapes. 
 To make wine, freshly harvested grapes are gently crushed to release their juices. If 
the wine maker is making a red wine , the crushed red or black grapes and their juice 
are allowed to ferment together. As the grape juice ferments, the grape skins color it, 
 wine an alcoholic beverage made from the 
fermented juice of grapes or other fruits; 
may be sparkling (effervescent) or still (non￾effervescent) or fortified with additional 
alcohol; wine’s alcohol content is 10–15% 
 beer an alcoholic beverage made from water, 
hops and malted barley, fermented by yeast; 
beer’s alcohol content is 3–12% 
 brandy an alcoholic beverage made by distilling 
wine or the fermented mash of grapes or other 
fruits; brandy’s alcohol content is 35–60% 
 liquor an alcoholic beverage made by distilling 
grains, fruits, vegetables or other foods; 
includes rum, whiskey and vodka; most distilled 
spirits’ alcohol content is 40–60% 
 liqueur a strong, sweet, syrupy alcoholic 
beverage made by mixing or redistilling neutral 
spirits with fruits, flowers, herbs, spices or 
other flavorings; also known as a cordial; 
liqueur’s alcohol content is 15–30% 
 fermentation the metabolic process by which 
certain bacteria and yeasts (fungi) convert 
carbohydrates into enzymes, carbon dioxide 
and ethyl alcohol 
 distillation the separation of alcohol from a 
liquid (or, during the production of alcoholic 
beverages, from a fermented mash); it is 
accomplished by heating the liquid or mash, 
creating a gas that contains alcohol vapors; 
this vapor is then condensed into the desired 
alcoholic liquid (beverage) 
Figure 7. 3 The process of fermentation. Yeasts consume sugars and, in the 
absence of oxygen, produce carbon dioxide and ethyl alcohol.

providing complex fruity flavors and releasing tannins , which give red wines their dis￾tinctive astringent characteristic and slightly bitter taste. 
 If the wine maker is making a white wine , the grape skins are removed and only the 
juice is fermented. If a rosé wine [ro-ZAY] or a blush wine is being made, red grape skins 
are left in contact with the juice just long enough to add the desired amount of color. 
 Once fermentation is complete, the wines are filtered and stored in either stainless 
steel tanks or oak barrels for aging. Although more expensive, aging wines in oak bar￾rels mellows the wine and adds vanilla, butter, caramel and oak flavors. When the wine 
maker determines that the wine has aged sufficiently, it is bottled and labeled for sale. 
 Sparkling Wines 
Sparkling wines are wines that undergo a second fermentation to generate carbon 
dioxide, which creates effervescence or bubbles. Sparkling wines such as Champagne, 
prosecco and cava are often served for special occasions. Only a sparkling wine from the 
Champagne region of France can legally be called Champagne. Sparkling wines also find 
their way into sorbet, mousse, custard and other pastry products. Heating or flambéing 
removes the carbonation and may destroy some of the more delicate aromas that are 
distinctive to these wines, however. 
 Fortified Wines 
 Wines typically have an alcohol content of 10–15%. Fortified wines have an alcohol 
content of 18–22% because of the addition of neutral grape spirits or grape brandy. If 
the brandy is added before fermentation is complete, the fortified wine will be sweet 
because the extra alcohol stops the fermentation process before the yeast can digest all 
the sugars. If the brandy is added after fermentation is complete, the fortified wine will 
be drier. The best-known fortified wines—and the ones most often used in cooking—are 
port, sherry, Madeira and marsala. 
Port, traditionally produced in the Duoro valley of Portugal, is divided into three 
categories. Vintage ports have a deep, dark brick or burgundy color and a rich, sweet 
flavor. They are aged 15–18 months in wood, then bottled and aged further, sometimes 
as long as several decades, before being consumed. They are considered the finest of 
ports and are too rare and expensive to use in cooking. Tawny ports are pale brown 
and mellow, with a less fruity flavor than other ports. They are aged for many years in 
wooden casks before bottling. Ruby ports are blends of younger, lesser quality wines. 
They have a bright, almost crimson color and a sweet, fruity flavor that is used in sauces 
for rich meats and for poaching fruit. Reasonably priced domestic ports suitable for 
kitchen use are widely available. 
Sherry is traditionally from the Jerez region of southern Spain. Sherries range from 
pale golden yellow and very dry to amber colored, thick and sweet with a pronounced 
nutty or dried fruit flavor. True aged Spanish sherries can be extremely expensive, but 
several domestic producers make both dry and sweet (also known as cream sherry) 
versions that are suitable for cooking use. Products labeled “cooking sherry” should be 
avoided as these are inferior-quality, highly salted products. 
Madeira , from the Portuguese island of Madeira, has a light brown color and a 
 toffee-caramel flavor that is produced when the developing wine is placed in wooden bar￾rels and heated. Madeira is sometimes used in desserts and in several classic meat dishes. 
Marsala , from western Sicily, is made from grapes that are dried prior to fermenta￾tion. Drying increases the grape’s sugar content. Marsala is aged in wooden barrels to 
mellow its distinctive aromas and flavors. It is brown-colored and available in two styles, 
dry and sweet; both styles are used in baked goods, pastries and veal and chicken dishes. 
 Wine Labeling 
 Most wines sold in the United States are labeled according to the grape varieties from 
which they are made. For example, if a wine is made from at least 75 percent Chardonnay 
grapes, then its label can simply say “Chardonnay.” This makes it easy for buyers to 
select the type of wine that they prefer.

European wines are often labeled by the specific location where the wine is pro￾duced. For example, Chablis, a popular white wine from the district of Chablis in France, 
is made from Chardonnay grapes. Likewise, Chianti is an area in Italy’s Tuscany region 
and refers to wine produced there from Sangiovese grapes.
Tasting Wines
Each grape varietal has certain hallmark aroma and flavor characteristics. This does not 
mean, however, that all wines made from the same grape varietal have exactly the same 
aromas and flavors. For example, a Merlot wine from Australia and one from California 
may share a certain smooth, juicy, mellow flavor with strong plum, black currant, black 
cherry and herbal or minty notes, but they are not identical beverages. Differences in the 
conditions under which the grapes are grown or the techniques the wine makers use 
create noticeable differences. Often two or more grape varietals are blended to create 
a wine with the best attributes of different grapes. The infinite possible combinations 
account for the wide number of wines available and the vast differences between them.
When tasting wine, three basic attributes should be considered: aroma, taste and body.
Aroma is the collection of different scents detected by the nose. With practice, indi￾vidual scents can often be distinguished from a complex aroma. A wine’s aroma should 
remind you of some other scent, usually that of a fruit, flower, herb, spice or other easily 
recognized item. For example, when evaluating the characteristic aroma of a wine made 
with Cabernet Sauvignon grapes, many people recognize the scents of black currants, 
chocolate, mint, cedar or fruit jam. Likewise, the hallmark aromas of a Sauvignon Blanc 
include notes of cut grass, fresh green herbs, asparagus and other vegetables. Remember, 
wine is not made with these other items; grapes and the wine making process produce 
aroma molecules that remind us of these scents.
Taste refers to the balance between the sugars and acids in the wine. Sugars and 
acids interact, exciting the taste buds to recognize a wine as sweet, dry or somewhere 
in between. The resulting taste is usually described with words based on a sweet/sour 
continuum (e.g., syrupy, sweet, crisp, tart or dry) or a reference to mouthfeel such as 
smooth, velvety, silky and so on. Finish is how long the aromas and tastes last after the 
wine is swallowed.
Body refers to the weight of the wine in the mouth and is generally related to the 
amount of alcohol it contains. A wine’s body is usually described as light, medium 
or full.
Selecting Wines to Use as Flavorings
For cooking purposes, choose good-quality wines at cost-effective prices. As with any 
other flavoring, you should evaluate wines before using them. Wines that are not suit￾able for drinking are also not suitable for cooking purposes. Here are some suggestions 
for when a recipe calls for only a general type of wine:
	▪ White wine or dry white wine: Try a simple, fruity Chardonnay or a dry, herby 
Sauvignon Blanc. Avoid wines with a sharp, acidic flavor and those with an 
excessive oaky or woody flavor.
	▪ Sweet or slightly sweet white wine: Try a Riesling or Chenin Blanc. When a dessert 
recipe calls for white wine, such as for poached pears, a slightly sweet wine 
is appropriate.
	▪ Red wine or dry red wine: Try a simple, fruity red wine with a low tannin content. 
A Pinot Noir or a medium-bodied Merlot or red Zinfandel is usually a good 
choice.
	▪ Sweet red wine: Try the rich flavor of a ruby port or possibly a red Zinfandel.
	▪ Sparkling wine: Try a sweet, fruity option as more delicate flavors (and the 
carbonation) may be destroyed by heat.
	▪ Dessert wine: Try one labeled “Late Harvest” as the grapes will have a higher 
sugar content.

 Beers 
 Beer is an alcoholic beverage containing 3–12 percent alcohol by volume. It is made 
from water, hops and malted barley or other grains and fermented by yeast (like wine) 
to produce alcohol and carbon dioxide. 
 Beers may be divided into two broad groups: ales and lagers. Ales are made with 
yeast that rises to the top during a warm fermentation process, producing an aromatic, 
amber-colored brew; porter and stout are the darkest ales. Lagers are made with yeast 
that falls to the bottom during a cool fermentation process and are characteristically light 
in color, clear and crisp. Pilsner is a popular style of pale, light lager associated with 
the ancient brewing center of Plzen in the Czech Republic. Most of the mass-market 
beer produced in the United States today is lager, but small local breweries and micro￾breweries often specialize in ales. The current popularity of artisan craft beers in the 
United States has led to a wave of microbreweries and brewpubs, often with attached 
restaurants. Menus promote beer and food pairings, and the cuisine offered may include 
dishes made with the brewery’s product. 
 Brewing Beers 
 To brew beer, the barley or other grain is first malted by steeping it in cool water until 
it germinates, producing the enzymes required for fermentation. The grain is then dried 
with warm air to establish color and flavor. A slow, gentle drying produces pale malts 
and a light-colored and light-bodied brew, whereas more intense heat develops dark 
malts that may be described as “caramelized,” “chocolate” or “toasted.” In the next stage, 
the ground malt is “mashed,” which means it is soaked in hot water, producing a brown 
liquid called the wort. Hops, the cone-shaped flowers 
of the vine Humulus lupulus , are added to the brew to 
provide bitterness and aroma. 
 Fermentation yeasts, selected according to the 
type of beer produced, are then added to the cooled 
wort and hops mixture. When fermentation is com￾plete, the beer is transferred to storage vats for 
conditioning, a process that removes unwanted 
flavors and develops natural carbonation. This 
stage can last from a few days to a few months 
before the beer is filtered and bottled. 
 Beer does not improve with age and is best con￾sumed as soon as possible after production. Light and 
heat both adversely alter beer’s flavor. Colored glass 
bottles or aluminum cans are generally used to block damaging 
light. Beer is best stored between 50°F and 55°F (10°C and 13°C). 
 Selecting Beers to Use as Flavorings 
 Beer is frequently used as a flavoring in the cuisines of northern France and Belgium, 
where it appears in such dishes as carbonnade, a stew flavored with beer. Because of 
beer’s slight bitterness, sugar or brown sugar is often added to the dish to balance the 
flavor. Beer can also be used in marinades and to deglaze and prepare sauces in the 
same manner as wine. Beer is frequently used in batters for deep-fried fish or vegetables 
such as Beer-Battered Onion Rings (page 657 ) . Beer can even be used to leaven and 
flavor breads. As with wine, do not cook with any beer that is not of drinkable quality. 
 Distilled Spirits 
 Distilled spirits include all types of brandy, liquor and liqueur, which are made by distill￾ing or concentrating the ethyl alcohol (ethanol) from a fermented liquid such as wine or 
beer made from grains, vegetables or other plants. By boiling the fermented liquid in a 
special cooking vessel known as a still , alcohol vapors condense and the liquid is col￾lected and converted into a beverage. Distilled spirits contain at least 20 percent alcohol 
 malting steeping barley or other grain until 
it germinates then drying it with warm air to 
develop its color and flavor

by volume, although most are at least 40 percent. Spirits are used to add flavors to all 
types of food and are especially popular in bakeshop products.
Brandy
Brandy is made by distilling fermented wine or fruit pulp. Brandies are divided into two 
general categories: grape brandy or fruit brandy.
Grape brandy is distilled from white wine or fermented grape pulp and skins. 
It is aged in wooden casks, which contributes to its rich, amber-brown colors and 
imparts additional mellowing flavors and aromas. Cognac, one of the best-known 
grape brandies, is made in France’s Cognac region (and only brandy made there 
can be called Cognac). Cognac is twice distilled and aged in oak casks. Traditionally 
Cognacs are labeled according to their age. Some common grades are V.S. (Very 
Special, at least 2½ years old), V.S.O.P. (Very Superior Old Pale, at least 4½ years old) 
and XO, Napoleon or Extra, (at least 6 years old). Armagnac is another well-known 
French grape brandy from southwestern France; it is slightly drier and heavier than 
Cognac and is traditionally used in dishes containing pork or game birds, and with 
dried fruits, especially plums.
Fruit brandy is made from fermented fruits other than grapes. Do not confuse fruit 
brandy with fruit-flavored brandy, which is grape brandy that has been flavored with 
the extract of another fruit. Well-known true fruit brandies include Calvados, an apple 
brandy from Normandy, France; Kirschwasser, a cherry brandy from Bavaria, Germany; 
Framboise, a raspberry brandy from Alsace, France; Poire, a pear brandy from Alsace, 
France; and Slivovitz, a plum brandy from eastern Europe and the Balkans.
When choosing a brandy for culinary purposes, do not skimp on quality. The brandy 
does not have to be the most expensive brand, but it should have a rich, full, mellow 
flavor. Try, for example, an inexpensive but genuine Cognac (one that is graded V.S.). If 
the recipe calls for a fruit brandy, do not use a fruit brandy with added artificial flavors, 
a fruit-flavored brandy or a fruit-flavored liqueur. The flavor, body, degrees of sweetness 
and alcohol content will be different from true fruit brandies.
Liquors
Liquors are alcoholic beverages distilled from fermented grains, vegetables or other 
plants. After distillation the resulting clear liquid can be colored and flavored by aging 
in wood barrels. The alcohol content of liquors ranges from 20 to 75 percent by volume, 
which is also expressed as “proof.” Proof is double the amount of alcohol by volume 
(abv); for example, a vodka that is 80 proof is 40% abv. Because of this higher alcohol 
content, liquors can be used to flambé a dish with a splash of flaming alcohol. Rum, 
tequila and whiskey are used to flavor dessert items, especially mousse, ice cream, cus￾tards and confections, while gin adds interest to meat and game marinades. Flavorless 
vodka is used less often in the kitchen but is still essential to some cream-based pasta 
sauces and cured seafood dishes.
Gin is a clear spirit distilled from grains and flavored with juniper berries, citrus peels, 
spices and other botanicals.
Rum is distilled from fermented sugar cane juice or molasses. Its character varies 
according to its color: White rums, which are clear and colorless, are relatively dry and 
light; amber or gold rums have a slightly stronger flavor and a pale golden color; dark 
rums have a strong molasses flavor, a dark brown color and a heavier body; spiced 
rums are dark and flavored with an infusion of various spices. Rum is often used in 
cakes, fruit breads and sweet products and combines especially well with tropical fruits. 
Generally white and gold rums can be used interchangeably, while very dark and spiced 
rums have a more distinctive flavor.
Tequila is a clear to amber-colored spirit made in the Tequila region of Mexico from 
the fermented sap of blue agave bulbs (piñas). Tequila pairs well with citrus fruits and is 
used in sauces, marinades and any dish with a “margarita” flavor profile.
Vodka is traditionally a flavorless and colorless liquor distilled from potatoes, fruits, 
grains and other plant products. Most of the world’s vodka is now made from wheat, but 
flambé [flahm-BAY] food served flaming; 
produced by igniting brandy, rum or other liquor

the distillation process renders it gluten free. Flavored vodka, currently a large segment 
of the market, is flavored either by including flavorings in the mash during distillation or 
by adding natural or artificial flavor extracts afterward.
Whiskey (the English, Scots and Canadians spell it without the e) is distilled from 
various fermented grains (essentially an unfinished beer). After distillation, whiskey is 
aged in oak barrels until the flavors are mellow and smooth. There are many types of 
whiskies. Scotch whisky is distilled from malted barley and has a range of flavors from 
sweet and nutty to smoky or peaty. Irish whiskey resembles Scotch, but without the 
smoky flavor. Bourbon is distilled from a combination of grains (mash) containing at 
least 51 percent corn and then aged in charred new oak barrels. Rye whiskey is made 
with a high percentage of rye grain.
Liqueurs
Liqueurs are traditionally made from herbs, fruits, nuts, spices, flowers or other fla￾vorings infused into an alcohol base and sweetened with sugar. The base might be 
neutral spirits, brandy, rum or whiskey. Many newer liqueurs, especially less expen￾sive products, are made with flavoring extracts, essential oils and even artificial flavors. 
Crea m liqueurs are liqueurs blended with cream for a mild, rich flavor. They do not 
keep well once opened, so they need to be stored in the refrigerator. Oddly enough, 
crème liqueurs, such as crème de cacao, crème de menthe and crème de cassis, contain 
no cream. Rather additional sugar gives them a thick, syrupy, creamy texture and a very 
sweet flavor.
When using a liqueur as a flavoring, look for products with rich, true, natural flavors. 
Also keep in mind that a liqueur and a crème liqueur of the same flavor are not the same 
products and should not be used interchangeably. If a recipe calls for the coffee-flavored 
liqueur Kahlúa, use it, not a crème de café product; the latter tastes sweeter with a 
syrupier texture. Similarly if a recipe calls for a proprietary brand such as Cointreau or 
Chambord, do not skimp on some lesser-quality generic product; customers may discern 
the difference. Some liqueurs commonly used as flavorings are listed in Table 7.4.

Guidelines for Cooking with Alcoholic Beverages
	▪ Use quality products: Heating a mediocre wine, beer, liqueur or liquor tends to 
bring out the worst characteristics of the product, especially its acidic properties. 
Do not use “cooking” wines or liquors as these products contain a large amount 
of added salt, which can ruin the finished dish.
	▪ Pay attention to cooking time: The longer a dish cooks, the more alcohol 
evaporates, thus concentrating its flavors, especially acidic flavors. Because 
alcohol evaporates at a lower temperature than water (172°F/86°C), the flavorings 
suspended in the alcohol concentrate faster than flavorings suspended in water.
	▪ Brown foods before adding wine or other alcoholic beverages: Especially in 
dishes such as pan sauces or stews, browning allows the surface of the foods to 
caramelize before liquid is added. As the liquid reduces, all of the flavors 
blend together.
	▪ Do not pour alcohol directly from the bottle into a hot pan: When the alcohol 
ignites, the flame may enter the bottle and cause an explosion or fire. 
Pour the necessary amount of wine or spirit into a container first, then into 
the hot pan.
	▪ Use nonreactive cookware: Alcohol and acids in wine may react with aluminum or 
cast-iron, so it is best to use nonreactive cookware when working with wine or 
other alcoholic beverages.
FLAVOR PRINCIPLES OF INTERNATIONAL 
CUISINES
To study world cuisines requires many years of reading, traveling and tasting. It is sim￾ply impossible to be an expert in any cuisine unless you have lived in the culture for 
an extended period of time. That does not mean, however, that chefs cannot recognize, 
appreciate and even recreate the flavor profiles, appearance and meals of regions far 
from their own homeland. In Ethnic Cuisine: The Flavor Principle Cookbook, Elisabeth 
Rozin writes: “Every culture tends to combine a small number of flavoring ingredients so 
frequently and so consistently that they become definitive of that particular cuisine” (page 
xiv). She calls these defining flavors “flavor principles” and notes that they are “designed 
to abstract what is absolutely fundamental about a cuisine and, thus, to serve as a guide 
in cooking and developing new recipes” (page xvii). The essence of the world’s many 
cuisines can be distilled into an evaluation of five components: primary staple ingredients 
(proteins and starches), religious influences, typical cooking methods, cooking fats and 
liquids and flavorings such as aromatics, herbs and spices. (See Table 7.5.) These compo￾nents describe the framework upon which every cuisine evolved over time. By examining 
a cuisine through this framework, we can begin to understand why a culture has and 
enjoys its unique cuisine.
The staple ingredients of a cuisine are the result of climate and geography, which 
dictate growing conditions and the availability of animals for food. Are there rivers, 
oceans, forests, flat farmable land or rocky hills; long dry seasons or consistent rainfall; 
cold winters or tropical heat? These conditions determined which foodstuffs were found 
in the wild or could be successfully cultivated. For example, the climate and landscape 
of northern Italy is good for grazing cattle, so beef, veal, butter and dairy products 
are more common there than in southern Italy, where seafood and olive oil prevail. 
Seafood is a staple food for the residents of the Malaysian islands, as very little land 
is available for grazing cattle and, as it is now a primarily Muslim nation, pork is not 
widely consumed.
Cooking with Alcohol
The amount of alcohol left in a dish 
that includes an alcoholic beverage as a 
flavoring depends on cooking method 
and time. A sauce with Cognac that is 
ignited (flambéed) and allowed to burn 
out completely before being served, for 
example, may retain very little of the 
alcohol content. In contrast, a chicken 
breast that was marinated in white wine 
and then quickly sautéed could retain 
as much as 75 percent of the alcohol 
from the marinade. If, however, the same 
chicken breast is cooked over medium 
heat for 15 minutes, as little as 40 percent 
of the alcohol will remain. Simmering 
the same chicken breast over low heat 
for approximately 2 hours or more can 
reduce the alcohol content to 10 percent 
or even less. If you wish to avoid the 
use of alcoholic beverages entirely, try 
substituting an appropriate natural fruit 
juice, or even water, for the same volume 
of liquid in the recipe.

The types of starches are significant to a cuisine because grains (e.g., rice, corn, wheat, 
millet, rye), pulses (e.g., dry beans, lentils and peas) or tubers (e.g., potatoes, cassava, 
yams) are the primary daily source of nutrients and energy for people throughout the 
world. Grains and pulses are preserved for long periods by drying and tubers can be left 
underground, away from invaders or trespassers until needed. All have many culinary 
uses and can even be converted to alcoholic beverages should the need arise. Again, cli￾mate often determines which starches dominate in any region. Staples do not change with 
economic status or social class. These foods are the foundational elements of a cuisine.
Some religions ask followers to abstain from consuming certain foods, such as meats, 
or drinking alcoholic beverages. Such restrictions obviously impact the cuisine in a cul￾ture that follows such a religion. Even if a food is available, a religion-based prohibition 
means that people will not consume it. Religion can influence the dining style of a single 
household, a neighborhood or an entire region. See the information on Kosher and Halal 
diets in Chapter 3, Nutrition and Healthy Cooking.
The preferred cooking methods used in a region evolved based on fuel availability. 
If forests were abundant, then firewood was plentiful and long, slow cooking methods 
could be used. If fuel sources were scarce, however, quick cooking techniques such as 
stir-frying or temporary in-ground ovens made with heated stones evolved. Examples are 
seen in the slow-cooked stewed and braised dishes of Eastern Europe compared with 
the quick-cooked stir-fries of China or kalua pig buried with hot stones in Hawaii’s imu 
ovens.
Fats and liquids are used to moisten, flavor and change the texture of ingredients. 
As with other foodstuffs, liquids differ according to availability and cultural preferences. 
In a geographic region that raises cattle, milk, butter and other dairy products will be 
available to use in cooking. A region that grows olives, corn, or coconuts will rely of 
those plants for cooking fat as well. In areas with a history of producing wines, wine is 
an integral part of the cuisine. Elsewhere, if soybeans or fish are preserved by fermenta￾tion then the liquids produced during fermentation, such as soy sauce and fish sauce, 
will be used in the cuisine.
The ultimate difference among cuisines is found in the aromatics, herbs and spices
used to flavor and enhance the other ingredients. Whether a cuisine utilizes tomatoes, 
chiles, saffron, basil or sumac may be the result of indigenous foodstuffs or may linger 
from exposure to long-ago trade routes or colonization. Herbs grow wild throughout 
the world and could be easily transported, grown in small kitchen gardens and dried 
for future use. Spices, on the other hand, were much more difficult to acquire as they 
only grow in tropical climates and come from a plant’s seeds, roots or bark, which can 
be difficult to harvest. People living along a spice trade route a thousand years ago had 
access to these seasonings, however, so spices often became incorporated into cuisines 
in unexpected places.
While this five-part framework offers an almost stereotypically broad description of 
a cuisine, it does present a flavor profile that most diners would recognize on their 
plate. This approach can also be useful in deconstructing dishes as you explore cuisines 
that are new to you, or in adding global flavors to your own recipes. For example, the 
primary ingredients of a Thai dish might be seafood, rice and vegetables. These items 
would generally be cooked quickly by sautéing or stir-frying. Thai cuisine relies on 
palm or coconut oil, rather than butter or olive oil, which affects that cuisine’s distinc￾tive flavor as well. Flavoring ingredients such as chiles (from the Americas), fresh herbs, 
lemongrass, limes, fish sauce or curry-like spice blends (from Thailand’s neighbor India) 
complete the picture, and result in a dish that is recognizably Thai. 
Consult Table 7.6 for an overview of the elements of many global cuisines. In each 
list of seasonings, the combination of items shown in italics form the typical flavor base of 
that region. It is also important to recognize that regional cuisines and flavor profiles 
are determined by culture and geographic conditions, which do not always align 
with political boundaries.

Culinary Migrations and Authenticity
Like music, clothing, architecture, language and religious beliefs, food is a deeply 
ingrained element in the culture for any group of people. Unfortunately for emigrants, 
going to a new country often meant that ingredients they were accustomed to were not 
available. Purveyors and markets had no incentive to import cardamom or fenugreek, for 
example, until there was a large enough demand for those products. So, emigrants had 
to make do with substitutes, which altered the traditional flavor profile of their cuisine. 
This blending and merging of the original with the available led to new flavor profiles 
that continued to be prepared and enjoyed even after traditional ingredients became 
widely available. These cultural shifts all contributed to the formation of cuisines now 
considered authentic to Oaxaca, Xi’an, Marrakesh, New Orleans or elsewhere. Cooking 
begun in homes out of necessity eventually inspired professional cooks and continues to 
influence the development of cuisines today.
Virtually all cooking skills and ingredients in use today are appropriations and 
adaptions from elsewhere. Thousands of years of trade along the Silk Road and the 
spice routes between Asia and the West, along with the Columbian Exchange of 
the late 15th century, brought tropical spices, tea, coffee, chocolate and new fruits 
and vegetables to Europe and the Mediterranean world. The enslavement of Africans 
throughout the Americas created an exchange of foods, cooking techniques and flavor 
profiles among those continents. Political and economic problems led to a massive 
migration of Europeans to North America in the 19th century. Irish, German, Dutch, 
Eastern European and Russian immigrants brought farming, brewing and cheese- making 
skills to the newly opened North American frontier. Asian migrations both within 
Asia and to Australia, Europe, and the Americas increased dramatically after World 
War II. These and many, many other migrations and exchanges—large and small—of 
foodstuffs, farming skills and cooking techniques contributed to the variety of global 
 culinary cultures and cuisines enjoyed today. Seasonings and ingredients rarely avail￾able in North America 20 years ago are now commonplace. Chefs can prepare kimchi 
with authentic Korean gochugaru flakes or paella with real Spanish saffron, which is 
good news for those wanting to cook more authentically and for expats and immigrants 
longing for a taste of home.
Modern transportation and worldwide marketing and distribution of both fresh 
and prepared foods, concern for nutrition and the impact of wealth has radically 
altered the global availability of foods. The fact that tofu, a key protein staple 
invented in ancient China, is now consumed in Scandinavia does not mean that

tofu is one of the flavor principles of Scandinavian cuisine. We might, however, say 
that tofu, like hamburgers, pizza and pasta, has become part of today’s global cui￾sine. Because of modern access to the world’s ingredients and increased travel and 
migration, today’s cooks are exposed to a greater variety of cuisines than at any time 
in history. But exposure is not expertise. Culinarians should strive to understand 
the heritage and history of cuisines that are different from their own and should 
work with various cooking methods, ingredients and presentations in a thoughtful, 
respectful manner.
Authenticity is an elusive concept. Japanese curry, Thai curry and curries from 
the various provinces of India are very different dishes, but all are authentic curries 
within their home cultures. In fact, dishes change from region to region and family 
to family within a culture. Today’s emphasis on culinary authenticity and accuracy 
may be, in part, a backlash against the fusion cuisine trend of the recent past. (See 
Chapter 1, Professionalism.) The mislabeling of dishes and misuse of ingredients may 
generate hard feelings or confusion. The flavor principles framework can provide an 
objective window into understanding, appreciating and respectfully preparing the 
world’s many cuisines.
International Seasoning Blends
Flavors that define a cuisine are generally the result of a combination of herbs and spices 
that are widely used in various dishes. Cooking with a mixture of spices—cumin, cin￾namon, paprika and coriander in Morocco, for example—developed as a way to balance 
tastes in a dish. It didn’t take ancient Silk Road spice traders long to realize that mixtures 
of spices could be popular and profitable products. Although these flavor combinations 
are widely available now as convenience products, most can be mixed by the chef as 
needed. This can also be a healthier option as commercial herb and spice blends may 
contain large amounts of salt. A few herb and spice blends based on international cui￾sines are described here.
Berbere [baer-bur-RAY] is a peppery hot blend essential to Ethiopian and Eritrea cui￾sines. Although every household has its preferred combination, typical ingredients include 
The Columbian Exchange
The year 1493 marked the beginning of 
an unprecedented exchange of foodstuffs 
throughout the world. The so-called “New 
World” of the Americas produced many wild 
and cultivated foods that were unknown 
elsewhere. And vice versa. Indigenous peoples 
of North, Central and South America enjoyed 
corn, beans, chocolate, chile peppers, turkeys 
and tomatoes, among many other foodstuffs, 
which had never been seen previously by 
anyone in Europe, Africa or Asia. likewise, the 
European colonists brought with them pigs, 
chickens, sugar cane, citrus fruit and other 
agricultural products previously unknown in 
the Americas.
Europe, Africa and Asia had been trading 
all manner of foodstuffs, textiles, metal 
crafts and people for centuries, both over 
land routes and by long, especially dangerous 
sea routes. So, items from India or China, 
for example, were already available, but 
expensive, in Europe and parts of Africa. 
Christopher Columbus, a sailor from the port 
city of Genoa, in what is now Italy, sailed 
on behalf of Spain searching for a quick 
route to the Indian sub-continent. The goal 
was to find less expensive peppercorns and 
other spices. Columbus and the explorers 
who soon followed failed in that mission. 
But his second voyage in 1493 began what 
is now called the Columbian Exchange—the 
unprecedented spread of plant and animal 
foodstuffs, ideas and diseases between 
Europe, western Africa and the Americas. 
Naturally, it wasn’t long before these new 
culinary treasures found their way to Asia, 
resulting in the vast variety of global cuisines 
enjoyed today.
The following are just a few of the foods 
indigenous to the two areas:

Curry powder
Chinese five-spice 
powder
Herbes de Provence
Garam masala
dried chiles, ginger, cumin, allspice, cloves, cinnamon and fenugreek. Berbere 
adds heat, plus sweet, citrusy flavors and a bright red color to stews, lentils and 
grain dishes.
Chinese five-spice powder is a combination of equal parts finely ground 
Szechuan pepper, star anise, cloves, cinnamon and fennel seeds. This blend 
is widely used in Chinese and some Vietnamese foods and is excellent with 
pork and in pâtés.
Curry powder is a European invention that probably took its name from 
the Tamil word kari, meaning “sauce.” Created by 19th-century Britons return￾ing from colonial India, it was meant to be the complete spicing for a “curry” dish. 
There are as many different formulas for curry powder as there are manufacturers, 
some mild and sweet (Bombay or Chinese style), others hot and pungent (Madras style). 
Typical ingredients in curry powder are black pepper, cinnamon, cloves, coriander, 
cumin, ginger, mace and turmeric.
Fines herbes [feenz AIRB] is a combination of parsley, tarragon, chervil and chives 
widely used in French cuisine. Its delicate, bright flavors work well with chicken, egg 
preparations and in salads. The mixture, which translates to “fine herbs” in English, can 
be prepared from either dry or fresh herbs.
Jamaican jerk seasoning is a powdered or wet mixture from the 
Caribbean island of Jamaica. It is a combination of ground spices that 
typically includes thyme, allspice, cinnamon, cloves, and ginger, as well 
as onions and garlic. Chicken and pork are rubbed or marinated in the 
blend, then grilled.
Herbes de Provence [airb duh pro-VAWNS] is a blend of dried herbs 
commonly grown and used in southern France. Commercial blends usu￾ally begin with lavender flowers from Provence, combined with thyme, 
rosemary, bay leaf, basil, fennel seeds and savory. It is used with grilled or 
roasted meat, fish or chicken; in vegetable dishes; on pizza; and even in steamed 
rice and yeast breads.
Masala [mah-SAH-lah] is a flavorful, aromatic blend of roasted and ground spices 
used in Indian cuisines. A garam masala [gah-RAHM] is a masala made with hot spices 
(garam means warm or hot). A dry garam masala usually contains peppercorns, carda￾mom, cinnamon, cloves, coriander, nutmeg, turmeric, bay leaves and fennel seeds and 
is added toward the end of cooking or sprinkled on the food just before service. Adding 
coconut milk, oil or sometimes tamarind water to a dry garam masala makes a wet garam 
masala. A wet garam masala is typically added at the start of cooking.
Quatre-épices [kah-tray-PEES] literally “four spices” in French, is a peppery mix￾ture of black peppercorns with lesser amounts of nutmeg, cloves and dried ginger. 
Sometimes cinnamon or allspice is included. Quatre-épices is used in charcuterie and 
long-simmered stews.
Ras el hanout [rass al ha-NOOT] is an ancient Moroccan spice blend that typically 
contains 20 or more spices, such as turmeric, cinnamon, cloves, grains of paradise, 
coriander, cumin, cardamom, peppercorns, dried chiles, dried flower petals and, until 
it became illegal, hashish and Spanish fly. It is sold whole or ground and used to flavor 
stews, rice, couscous and game dishes.
Shichimi toˉgarashi [SHEE-chee-me tow-ger-aa-shee] is a chile pepper-based blend 
used as a condiment in Japanese cuisine. In addition to chile flakes, it usually contains 
six other seasonings (shichimi means “seven tastes”), depending on brand and regional 
preference. White sesame seeds, nori (seaweed) flakes, dried citrus peel, garlic, ginger, 
sansho pepper and white poppy seeds are typical ingredients. Hot, medium or mild 
versions are available.
Za’atar [ZAH-tar] is a blend of dried thyme, wild oregano, Aleppo pepper, sumac, 
hyssop and sesame seeds used throughout the Middle East since Medieval times. It is 
baked on flatbreads or mixed with olive oil as a condiment. The flavor pairs well with 
hummus, yogurt, eggs, fish, meats and cheese.

 After studying this chapter, 
you will be able to: 
8. 1 identify, store and cook with a variety of 
milk and milk products 
8. 2 describe basic cheese-making processes 
8. 3 classify cheese varieties and categories: 
fresh or unripened, soft, semisoft, firm, 
hard and goat 
8. 4 explain the types of processed cheeses 
8. 5 serve, store and cook with cheeses 
8. 6 describe analog milk products 
 Dairy products include cow’s milk and foods produced from cow’s milk such as 
butter, yogurt, sour cream and cheese. the milk of other mammals, namely, 
goats, sheep (ewe) and buffalo, is also made into dairy products that are widely 
available and used in commercial food service operations. Products made with goat’s milk 
and sheep’s milk are especially helpful for people who have difficulty digesting cow’s milk 
products. Dairy products are extremely versatile and are commonly served both alone and as 
ingredients in dishes such as soups, salads, sauces, breads and desserts. analog dairy prod￾ucts, which include plant-derived milks, cheeses and other dairy replacement foods, are also 
covered in this chapter. 
 MILK AND MILK PRODUCTS 
 Milk is not only a popular beverage, it is also an ingredient in many dishes. Milk and 
products derived from milk provide texture, flavor, color and nutritional value to cooked 
and baked items. Milk is one of the most nutritious foods available, providing proteins, 
vitamins and minerals (particularly calcium). Because milk, cream, cultured dairy products 
and butter are animal products, they do contain cholesterol. Overall fat content varies 
among dairy products and depends on the amount of milkfat left after processing. Milk is 
also highly perishable and an excellent bacterial breeding ground. Care must be exercised 
when handling and storing milk and other dairy products. Whole milk—that is, milk as it 
comes from the cow—consists primarily of water (about 88%). It contains approximately 
3.5% milkfat and 8.5% other milk solids (proteins, milk sugar [lactose] and minerals). 
 Because of its relatively low fat content, milk will curdle in the presence of an acid 
or when heated. This means that the proteins solidify or coagulate and separate from the 
liquid. Coagulation of the milk proteins is beneficial in cheese making, discussed later, 
but it ruins custards, sauces and other dishes. 
 Milk-Processing Techniques 
 Whole milk is graded A, B or C according to standards recommended by the U.S. Public 
Health Service. Grades are assigned based on bacterial count, with Grade A products 
having the lowest count. Grades B and C, though still safe and wholesome, are rarely 
available for retail or commercial use. Milk must be processed before consumers can 
purchase it. By law, all Grade A milk must be pasteurized prior to retail sale. 
Pasteurization is the process of heating milk to a sufficiently high temperature for a 
sufficient length of time to destroy pathogenic bacteria. Pasteurization typically involves 
holding milk at a temperature of 161°F (72°C) for 15 seconds. In addition to eliminat￾ing bacteria, the pasteurization process also destroys enzymes that cause spoilage, thus 
increasing shelf life. Although milk’s nutritional value is not significantly affected by 
pasteurization, milk is often fortified with additional vitamins and minerals, especially 
vitamins A and D, during processing. 
Raw milk , which is not pasteurized, may host disease-causing organisms that can cause 
food-borne illness. Certified milk is milk, pasteurized or unpasteurized, produced in dair￾ies that operate under the rules and regulations of an authorized medical milk commission. 
Though certified raw milk may be sold to consumers in some states, its use in food service 
establishments violates the FDA’s 2022 Food Code, which requires that food service operations 
use Grade A milk. The FDA does, however, permit food service operations to use raw milk in 
cheeses that are then aged at least 60 days at not less than 35°F (2°C). 
Ultra-pasteurization is a process in which milk is heated to a very high temperature 
(280°F/135°C) for a very short time (2–4 seconds) to destroy virtually all bacteria. The 
process may give the milk a noticeable cooked flavor. Ultra-pasteurization is most often 
used with whipping cream and individual creamers. Although the process may reduce 
cream’s whipping properties, it extends its shelf life dramatically. 
 Imitation and Artificial 
Dairy Products 
 coffee whiteners, imitation sour cream, 
whipped-topping mixes and some whipped 
toppings in pressurized cans are made 
from nondairy products. these products 
usually consist of corn syrup, binding 
agents, vegetable fats, coloring agents 
and artificial flavors. these products are 
generally less expensive and have a longer 
shelf life than the real dairy products 
they replace, but their flavors are no 
match. imitation and artificial products 
may be useful, however, for people who 
have allergies or are on a restricted diet. 
if you choose to use these products, you 
cannot legally claim to be using real dairy 
products on menus or labels.

milkfat, 10.3% milk solids and 82.2% water 
 sheep’s milk produced by a female sheep; it has 
approximately 7.9% milkfat, 11.4% milk solids 
and 80.7% water 
 goat’s milk produced by a female goat; it has 
approximately 4.1% milkfat, 8.9% milk solids 
and 87% water 
M08_LABE1163_07_SE_C08.indd 166 31/10/23 7:37 PMDairy ProDucts 167
Ultra-high-temperature (UHT) processing is a form of ultra-pasteurization in 
which milk is held at a temperature of 280−300°F (138−150°C) for 2–6 seconds. It is 
then packed in sterile containers under sterile conditions and sealed to prevent bacteria 
from entering the container. Unopened UHT milk can be stored without refrigeration for 
at least 3 months. Although UHT milk can be stored unrefrigerated, it should be chilled 
before serving and stored like fresh milk once opened. UHT processing may give milk a 
slightly cooked taste, but it has no significant effect on milk’s nutritional value.
Homogenization is a process in which the fat globules in whole milk are reduced in 
size and permanently dispersed throughout the liquid. This prevents the fat from clump￾ing together and rising to the surface as a layer of cream. Although homogenization is 
not required, milk sold commercially is generally homogenized because the process 
ensures a uniform consistency, a whiter color and a richer taste.
Whole milk can be processed in a centrifuge to remove all or a portion of the milkfat, 
resulting in reduced-fat, low-fat and nonfat milks. According to the FDA, all reduced-fat 
milks must be nutritionally equivalent to full-fat milk and must provide at least the same 
amounts of the fat-soluble vitamins A and D as full-fat milk. Reduced-fat or less-fat milk 
is whole milk from which sufficient milkfat has been removed to produce a liquid with 
2% milkfat. Low-fat or little-fat milk contains 1% milkfat. In nonfat milk, also referred 
to as fat-free, no-fat or skim milk, as much milkfat has been removed as possible. To be 
sold as nonfat milk, its fat content must be below 0.5%.
Concentrated Milks
Concentrated or condensed milk products are produced by removing all or part of the 
water from whole milk with a vacuum. The resulting products have a high concentration 
of milkfat and milk solids and an extended shelf life.
Evaporated milk is produced by removing approximately 60% of the water from 
whole, homogenized milk. The concentrated liquid is canned and heat-sterilized. This 
results in a cooked flavor and darker color. Evaporated skim milk, with a milkfat content 
of 0.5%, is also available. A can of evaporated milk requires no refrigeration until opened, 
although the can should be stored in a cool place. Evaporated milk can be reconstituted 
with an equal amount of water and used like whole milk for cooking or drinking.
Sweetened condensed milk is similar to evaporated milk in that 60% of the water 
has been removed. But unlike evaporated milk, sweetened condensed milk contains 
large amounts of sugar (40–45%). Sweetened condensed milk is also canned; the can￾ning process darkens the color and adds a caramel flavor. Sweetened condensed milk 
cannot be substituted for whole milk or evaporated milk because of its sugar content. 
Its distinctive flavor is most often found in desserts and confections such as fudge.
Dry milk powder is made by removing virtually all the moisture from pasteurized 
milk. Dry whole milk, nonfat milk and buttermilk are available. The lack of moisture 
prevents the growth of microorganisms and allows dry milk powders to be stored for 
extended periods without refrigeration. Powdered milks can be reconstituted with water 
and used like fresh milk. Milk powder may also be added to foods directly, with addi￾tional liquid included in the recipe. This procedure is typical in bread making and does 
not alter the effect milk has on the dough or the flavor in the finished product.
Cream
Cream is a rich, liquid milk product containing at least 18% fat. Like milk, cream must 
be pasteurized or ultra-pasteurized and may be homogenized. Cream has a slight yel￾low or ivory color and is thicker and stickier than milk. Cream gives flavor and body to 
sauces, soups and desserts. Whipping cream, containing not less than 30% milkfat, can 
be whipped into a stiff foam and used in pastries and desserts. Cream is marketed in 
several forms with different fat contents.
Half-and-half contains between 10% and 18% milkfat, which is higher than milk but 
lower than cream. It is often served with cereal or coffee, but it does not contain enough 
fat to whip into a foam.
Evaporated milk

M08_LABE1163_07_SE_C08.indd 167 31/10/23 7:37 PM168 cHaPtEr EiGHt
Light cream, coffee cream and table cream are all products with more than 18% 
but less than 30% milkfat. These products are used in baked goods or soups as well as 
served with coffee, fruit and cereal.
Light whipping cream or, simply, whipping cream, contains between 30% and 
36% milkfat. It is generally used for thickening and enriching sauces and making ice 
cream. It is whipped into a foam and used as a dessert topping or folded into custards or 
mousses to add flavor and lightness.
Heavy whipping cream or, simply, heavy cream, contains not less than 36% milk￾fat. It whips easily and holds its whipped texture longer than other creams. It must be 
pasteurized but is rarely homogenized. Heavy cream is used in the same ways as light 
whipping cream. Both light and heavy creams, when heated gently, can withstand boil￾ing. Milk on the other hand will separate into congealed curds and liquid.
Cultured Dairy Products
Cultured dairy products, such as yogurt, buttermilk and sour cream, are produced by 
adding specific bacterial cultures to fluid dairy products. The bacteria convert the milk 
sugar lactose into lactic acid, giving these products their body and tangy, unique flavors. 
The acid content also retards the growth of undesirable microorganisms; cultured prod￾ucts have been used for centuries to preserve milk.
Buttermilk originally referred to the liquid remaining after cream was churned into 
butter. Today buttermilk is produced by adding a culture (Streptococcus lactis) to fresh, 
pasteurized skim or low-fat milk. This results in tart milk with a thick texture. Buttermilk 
is most often used as a beverage or in baked goods.
Sour cream is produced by adding the same culture used to make buttermilk to pas￾teurized, homogenized light cream. The resulting product is a white, tangy gel. It is used 
as a condiment or to enrich soups and sauces or give baked goods a distinctive flavor. 
Sour cream must have a milkfat content of not less than 18% although reduced fat and 
nonfat versions are available.
Crème fraîche is a cultured cream popular in French cuisine. Although thinner and richer 
than sour cream, it has a similar tart, tangy flavor. It is used in soups and sauces, especially with 
poultry, rabbit and lamb dishes. Crème fraîche is easily prepared from the following recipe.

mammalian milk; milk sugar

Thinner than sour cream and crème fraîche, Mexican crema is a slightly salty and 
tangy cultured cream used in Mexican and Latin cooking. Crème fraîche and crema have 
a high fat content and can be boiled without curdling.
Yogurt is a thick, tart, custard-like product made from milk (either whole, low-fat or 
nonfat) cultured with Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus. Though 
touted as a health or diet food, yogurt is not necessarily low in fat or calories; it contains the 
same amount of milkfat as the milk from which it is made. Yogurt may also contain a variety 
of sweeteners, flavorings and fruits. Greek yogurt is a creamier and denser style of yogurt 
made by straining additional whey from the product or by adding additional milk protein 
solids. (True Greek yogurt is often made with sheep’s milk.) Yogurt is generally eaten alone 
but is also used in baked products, salad dressings and frozen desserts.
whey the watery liquid remaining after milk 
proteins coagulate into curds during the cheese 
making process. it contains vitamins, minerals, 
proteins and trace amounts of fat and is used 
in making whey cheese, such as ricotta, and as 
a substitute for non-fat milk.
M08_LABE1163_07_SE_C08.indd 168 31/10/23 7:37 PMDairy ProDucts 169
Chefs who make yogurt and other fresh cheese in-house often reserve the whey for 
other uses such as a liquid in which to cook fish, meat or vegetables. Whey’s acidity and 
tangy flavor make it a good option to use in place of a squeeze of lemon when finishing 
sauces or on top of seafood.
Butter
Butter is a fatty substance produced by agitating or churning cream. The flavor butter 
adds to sauces, breads and pastries is unequaled. Butter contains at least 80% milkfat, not 
more than 16% water and 2–4% milk solids. It may or may not contain added salt. Butter 
is firm when chilled and soft at room temperature. It melts into a liquid at approximately 
93°F (33°C) and reaches the smoke point at 260°F (127°C).
Sweet butter is another name for unsalted butter. Salted butter, as the name implies, 
is butter with salt added, although exact amounts vary from producer to producer. Salt 
not only changes the butter’s flavor, it also extends its shelf life. When using salted butter 
in cooking or baking, the salt content must be considered in the total recipe.
European-style butter contains more milkfat than regular butter, usually 82–86%, 
and very little or no added salt. It is often churned from cultured cream, giving it a more 
intense, buttery flavor. It may be used in lieu of any regular butter in cooking or baking.
Whipped butter is made by incorporating air into the butter. This increases its vol￾ume and spreadability but also shortens its shelf life. Because of the change in density, 
whipped butter should not be substituted in recipes calling for regular butter.
Clarified butter is butter that is melted so that the water and milk solids can be 
removed by a process called clarification. Ghee is a form of clarified butter in which the 
milk solids remain with the fat and are heated until light brown. It originated in India but 
is now used worldwide as an ingredient and cooking medium. Although whole b utter
can be used for cooking or sauce making, sometimes a more stable and consistent prod￾uct will be achieved by using clarified butter. The clarification process is described in 
Chapter 9, Mise en Place.
Margarine
Margarine is not a dairy product but is included in this section because it is frequently 
substituted for butter in cooking, baking and table service. Margarine is manufactured 
from vegetable fats and may contain milk products. Flavorings, colorings, emulsifiers, 
preservatives and vitamins are added, and the mixture is firmed or solidified by expo￾sure to hydrogen gas at very high temperatures, a process known as hydrogenation. 
Generally the firmer the margarine, the greater the degree of hydrogenation and the 
longer its shelf life. Like butter, margarine is approximately 80% fat and 16% water, but 
even the finest margarine cannot match the flavor of butter.
Margarine packaged in tubs is softer and more spreadable than solid products because 
it contains more water and air. For example, diet margarine is approximately 50% water. 
Because they are less dense, these soft products should not be substituted for regular 
butter or margarine in cooking or baking.
Specially formulated and blended margarine is available for commercial use in mak￾ing puff pastry, croissant doughs, frostings and related products.

emulsifier a substance added to a mixture to 
assist in the binding of unmixable liquids such 
as oil and water. chemicals may be used as 
emulsifiers, but naturally occurring soy and egg 
lecithin are commonly used in processed foods.
Grading Butter
although government grading is not 
mandatory for butter, most processors 
submit their butters for testing. the usDa 
label on the package assures the buyer 
that the butter meets federal standards 
for the grade indicated:
▪ USDA Grade AA: Butter of superior 
quality, made from sweet cream with 
low natural acid and a highly pleasing 
buttery flavor, smooth, creamy texture 
and good spreadability.
▪ USDA Grade A: Butter of very good 
quality, with a pleasing flavor and fairly 
smooth texture.
▪ USDA Grade B: Butter of standard 
quality, made from sour cream; has 
an acceptable flavor but lacks the 
flavor, texture and body of Grades aa 
and a. Grade B is most often used in 
industrial food manufacturing.
Margarine: From Laboratory Bench to Dinner Table
Margarine was invented by a French chemist 
in 1869 after Napoleon iii offered a prize for 
the development of an inexpensive synthetic 
edible fat that could be supplied to his military 
forces. originally produced from beef fat and 
milk, margarine is now made almost exclusively 
from vegetable fats.
in On Food and Cooking: The Science and Lore of 
the Kitchen, Harold McGee recounts the history 
of margarine. He explains that margarine 
caught on quickly in Europe and america, 
with large-scale production underway by 
1880, but the american dairy industry and 
the u.s. government put up fierce resistance. 
under federal law it was taxed and its 
sale restricted to licensed stores. the u.s. 
government refused to purchase it for use by 
the armed forces. and, in an attempt to hold 
it to its true colors, some states did not allow 
margarine to be dyed yellow (animal fats and 
vegetable oils are much paler than butter); the 
dye was sold separately and mixed in by the 
consumer. World War ii, which brought butter 
rationing, probably did the most to establish 
margarine’s respectability. However, it was 
not until 1967 that yellow margarine could be 
sold in Wisconsin.

Storage of Milk and Milk Products
Fluid milk and cultured dairy products require time and temperature control for safety 
(TCS) and should be kept refrigerated at or below 41°F (5°C). The shelf life of fluid milk 
is reduced by half for every 5-degree rise in temperature above 41°F (5°C). Keep milk 
containers closed to prevent absorption of odors and flavors. Freezing is not recom￾mended, although whole milk that has been frozen can be used to make simple cheeses, 
such as ricotta. Ultra-pasteurized cream will keep for 6 to 8 weeks if refrigerated at or 
below 41°F (5°C). Unwhipped cream should not be frozen. Keep cream away from 
strong odors and bright lights, as they can adversely affect its flavor. Under proper con￾ditions, sour cream will last up to 4 weeks, yogurt up to 3 weeks and buttermilk up to 
2 weeks. Freezing is not recommended for these products; however, dishes prepared 
with cultured products generally can be frozen.
Due to its high fat content, butter is extremely prone to rancidity. Butter that is rancid 
develops a harsh bitter taste and deep yellow to brown color. To preserve its freshness, 
butter should be well wrapped and stored at temperatures between 32°F and 35°F (0°C 
and 2°C). Unsalted butter keeps well when frozen. If well wrapped, frozen butter will 
keep for up to 9 months at a temperature of 0°F (−18°C).
Unlike butter, margarine is not prone to rancidity, but like butter it should be kept 
refrigerated at or below 41°F (5°C). Wrap it well to prevent it from absorbing odors. 
Well-wrapped frozen margarine will keep for up to 9 months at a temperature of 
0°F (−18°C).
CHEESE AND THE CHEESE-MAKING PROCESS
Cheese (Fr. fromage; It. formaggio) is one of the oldest and most widely used foods 
known to humankind. It is served alone or as a principal ingredient in or an accom￾paniment to countless dishes such as cheese fondue and soufflé. In cultures with 
 dairy-producing livestock, cheese is commonly used in everything from breakfast to 
snacks to desserts.
Hundreds of natural, unprocessed cheeses are produced worldwide. Although their 
shapes, ages and flavors vary according to local preferences and traditions, all natural 
cheeses are produced in the same basic fashion that has been used for centuries. Each 
starts with a mammal’s milk; cow’s, goat’s and sheep’s milk are the most commonly 
used. The milk proteins (known as casein) are coagulated with the addition of an 
enzyme, usually rennet, which is found in calves’ stomachs. As the milk coagulates, it 
separates into solid (curds) and liquid (whey). After draining off the whey, either the 
curds are made into fresh cheese, such as ricotta or cottage cheese, or the curds are 
further processed by cutting, kneading and cooking. The resulting substance, known 
as “green cheese,” is packed into molds to drain. Salt or special bacteria may be added 
to the molded cheeses, which are then allowed to ripen (age) under controlled con￾ditions. The method used to ripen a cheese, the location where the ripening takes 
place—whether in a cave or temperature-controlled chamber, for example—and the 
length of time a cheese is allowed to ripen determine the texture, color and flavor of 
the final product.
Cheeses are a product of their environment, which is why most fine cheeses cannot 
be accurately reproduced outside their native locale. The breed and feed of the milk 
animal, the wild spores and molds in the air and even the wind currents in a storage area 
can affect the manner in which a cheese develops. (Roquefort, for example, develops its 
distinctive flavor from aging in particular caves that are filled with crosscurrents of cool, 
moist air.) The interior, referred to as the paste, of a cheese changes texture as it ages, 
becoming creamy and flowing or firm and sometimes crunchy depending on the type of 
cheese being made.
Some cheeses develop a natural downy white surface called a bloomy rind because 
of the application of mold and/or yeast that grows into a coating during aging. These are 
known as soft-ripened cheeses. Repeated washing with brine, beer, brandy or wine also 
rancidity the decomposition of fats by 
exposure to oxygen, resulting in off-flavors and 
destruction of nutritive components
Safety Alert
Milk Storage
canned milks, aseptically packaged milks 
and dry milk powders are shelf-stable 
products needing no refrigeration. after 
the can or box is opened or the powder is 
reconstituted with water, however, these 
require time and temperature control for 
safety (tcs) and must be handled just as 
carefully as fresh milk. Do not store an 
open can of milk in its original container, 
and keep all milk products refrigerated at 
or below 41°F (5°c).
M08_LABE1163_07_SE_C08.indd 170 31/10/23 7:37 PMDairy ProDucts 171
encourages the formation of surface mold on some types of cheese, known as washed 
rind. The pronounced aroma on washed rind cheese gives their paste distinctive flavors. 
Both soft-ripened and washed rind cheeses ripen from the outside in towards the center. 
Most natural rinds may be eaten if desired. Other cheeses are coated with an inedible 
wax rind to prevent moisture loss. (Smoked cheeses are frequently coated with a brown 
wax rind.) Fresh cheeses do not have rinds.
Most cheeses contain high percentages of fat and protein. Cheese is also rich in 
 calcium, phosphorus and vitamin A. As animal products, natural cheeses contain choles￾terol. Today many low-fat and nonfat processed cheeses are available. Sodium has also 
been reduced or eliminated from some products, and vegan cheese, made without ren￾net from nuts and other plant-based proteins and thickeners, are now available.
Moisture and fat contents are good indicators of a cheese’s texture and shelf life. 
The higher the moisture content, the softer the product and the more perishable it 
will be. Low-moisture cheeses may be used for grating and keep for several weeks if 
properly stored. (Reduced water levels prohibit bacterial growth.) Fat content ranges 
from low fat (less than 20% fat) to double cream (at least 60% fat) and triple cream (at 
least 72% fat). Cheeses with a high fat content are creamier and have a richer flavor 
and texture than low-fat products.
CHEESE VARIETIES AND CATEGORIES
Cheeses can be classified in many ways, such as by country of origin, type of milk, rip￾ening method, fermentation method, moisture or fat content or texture. Here we classify 
the varieties of natural cheeses by texture and have adopted five categories: fresh or 
unripened, soft, semisoft, firm and hard. Separate sections on goat’s-milk cheeses and 
processed cheeses are also included.
Many of the finest cheeses originated in European countries. Government regula￾tions in those countries and in the European Union protect certain cheeses by ensuring 
that they are made only in specific locations using traditional methods and by pro￾tecting their names (e.g., Roquefort, Parmigiano-Reggiano, Cabrales) from imitation or 
misuse. Cheese makers in the United States and elsewhere may succeed in producing 
a high-quality cheese similar to the original, but they cannot use the legally protected 
name. Hence there are many Emmental cheeses, but only one Emmentaler Switzerland 
AOP. Large commercial cheese producers worldwide may approximate the general char￾acteristics of a style of cheese to produce less expensive substitutes. This accounts for 
the wide variety of cheddars, mozzarellas, Goudas and Parmesans on the market. The 
cheese descriptions here explain the original source and method of production, unless 
otherwise noted, and indicate cheese names that are legally protected.
Fresh or Unripened Cheeses
Fresh cheeses are uncooked and unripened. They are generally mild and creamy with a 
tart tanginess. A good fresh cheese does not taste acidic or bitter. Fresh cheeses have a 
moisture content of 40–80% and are highly perishable. A number of fresh cheeses can be 
easily made in a food service kitchen. When space and time permit, making fresh cheese 
ensures a quality product and may offer cost savings as well.
Cream cheese is a soft cow’s-milk cheese containing approximately 35% fat. It is 
available in solid white blocks or whipped and sometimes flavored. It is used in baking, 
dips, dressings and confections and is popular as a spread for bagels. Fromage blanc
and fromage frais are unripened soft cheeses from France made from cultured cow’s 
milk. Mildly acidic and tangy, their fat content ranges from 0% to 40%. The texture of 
fromage blanc resembles yogurt although it can be purchased in molds that drain off 
some of the whey and firm the cheese. Fromage frais, which must contain live cultures, 
tends to be firmer than fromage blanc. Both cheeses are served at breakfast, as dessert or 
in sauces. Fromage frais is often blended with herbs and spices to make a cheese spread 
that is sold commercially or can be made from the following recipe.

Making Mozzarella
in italy, mozzarella is made every day; it 
is meant to be consumed just as often. 
Before there was refrigeration, the balls 
of mozzarella were stored in well water 
to keep them cool, which is where the 
tradition originated of storing fresh 
mozzarella in liquid.
once the milk coagulates and the 
curds are cut, the mass is slowly stirred to 
enhance the whey’s expulsion. a few hours 
later, when the curds are mature, they 
are removed from the whey, chopped or 
shredded and then mixed with hot water.
to test the exact amount of maturity, a 
handful of curds is dipped into a bucket of 
hot water for 10 seconds. When the curds 
are removed, they should be kneaded 
briefly and then, holding the mass with 
two hands, it should be pulled and 
stretched out to determine its maturity. 
When it can be stretched as thin and 
opaque as tissue paper, it is exactly ready 
to be strung. at this point, small amounts 
of curd are dumped into a small vat and 
stirred with hot water using a paddle. 
this is known as “stringing” the cheese 
because as the curds are mixed with water, 
they begin to melt somewhat and become 
stringy. the more the cheese is stirred, the 
longer the strings are stretched. Eventually 
all the strings come together to make a 
large mass of satiny-smooth cheese. in 
italian the word filare means “to string”; 
therefore all cheeses that are strung are 
members of the pasta filata family.
When stringing is complete, the 
cheese is ready to be shaped and hand￾formed into balls. the balls are tossed 
immediately into vats of cool water so 
they will maintain the desired shapes. 
When cool, the balls are immersed in 
brine solution and then wrapped in 
parchment paper.

Company in Dallas, Texas.

Feta is a semisoft cheese popular in Mediterranean cuisines. Traditionally made from 
sheep’s and/or goat’s milk, it is a white, flaky cheese that is pickled (but not ripened) 
and stored in brine water, giving it a shelf life of 4–6 weeks. Feta’s flavor becomes 
sharper and saltier with age. Feta is ideal for snacking and in salads 
and fillings for breads, pastries and other foods.
Mascarpone [mas-cahr-POHN-ay] is a soft cow’s-milk 
cheese originally from Italy’s Lombard region. It contains 
70–75% fat and is extremely smooth and creamy. Mascarpone 
is highly perishable and is available in bulk or in 8- or 16-ounce 
tubs. It has a characteristic pale ivory color and a rich, sweet 
flavor and is incorporated into both sweet and savory sauces as 
well as desserts. It is also eaten plain, with fresh fruit or spread on 
bread and sprinkled with cocoa or sugar.
Mozzarella [maht-suh-REHL-lah] is a semisoft to firm Italian cheese traditionally 
made with water buffalo’s milk (today cow’s milk is more common) and contain￾ing 40–45% fat. Mozzarella becomes elastic when melted and is 
well known as “pizza cheese.” Fresh mozzarella is excellent in 
salads or topped simply with olive oil and herbs. It is a very 
mild white cheese best eaten fresh. When fresh mozzarella is 
still pliable, it may be filled with cream, butter or another 
soft cheese to make burrata. This highly perishable semi￾soft cheese is served with tomatoes, salad greens or fresh 
fruit. Factory-made mozzarella is rather bland and rub￾bery and is best reserved for cooking, for which it may be 
purchased already shredded.
Paneer [puh-NEAR] is semi-soft with a flavor like cottage cheese. It is made by cur￾dling cow or buffalo milk with fruit or vegetable juice and is sold in blocks or wheels, 
then cut into bite-sized pieces or grated. Paneer does not melt so it is typically included 
in hot stews and vegetable dishes and appears throughout the Indian subcontinent in 
everything from savory snacks to sweet desserts.

Ricotta [rih-COH-tah] is a soft Italian cheese, similar to American cottage cheese, 
traditionally made from the whey leftover after other cow’s-milk cheeses are produced. 
It contains only 4–10% fat. It is white or ivory in color and fluffy, with a small grain and 
sweet flavor. Ricotta is an important ingredient in many pasta dishes and desserts. Ricotta 
is best when freshly made; it can be made easily with the following recipe.
1 combine the milk and cream in a container with a cover. cover and allow the milk and cream mix￾ture to reach room temperature.
2 in a stainless steel saucepan, slowly heat the milk and cream to 180°F (82°c), stirring often. Hold 
the heated milk at 180°F (82°c) for 5 minutes.
3 remove the milk from the heat and gently stir it while adding the lemon juice or vinegar. continue 
to stir gently until curds begin to form. stop stirring and allow the milk mixture to sit at room tem￾perature, uncovered, until a solid mass of curds forms, approximately 20 minutes.
4 Gently pour or ladle the curds into a strainer or china cap lined with new, rinsed cheesecloth. allow 
the whey (liquid) to separate and drain away from the curds (solids). Discard the whey or reserve 
it for another use.
5 allow the cheese to rest covered and undisturbed for 30 minutes to an hour.
6 unwrap the cheese. season it with salt if desired. use the cheese as you would use commercially 
produced ricotta.
Variation:
For a firm, dry ricotta, in step 4 lift the corners of the cheesecloth and tie them together with twine. 
suspend the bag in a tall, covered container, place it in the refrigerator and allow the cheese to 
drain for 4 hours or overnight. (or line perforated cheese molds with cheesecloth. Pack the cheese 
into the molds. Fold up the cheesecloth, then top them with weights. refrigerate overnight.)

Brie
Soft Cheeses
Soft cheeses are characterized by their thin skins and creamy centers. They are among 
the most delicious and popular of cheeses. They ripen quickly, from the rind toward the 
center, and are at their peak for only a few days, sometimes less. Moisture content of soft 
cheeses ranges from 50% to 75%.
Brie [bree] is a soft-ripened French cheese made with cow’s milk and containing 
about 60% fat. Brie is made in round, flat disks weighing 2 or 4 pounds (1 or 2 kilo￾grams) coated with a bloomy white rind and has a texture that oozes. 
Brie de Meaux is a legally protected version made with unpasteur￾ized milk in the town of Meaux. Selecting a properly ripened 
Brie is a matter of judgment and experience. Select a cheese 
that is bulging a bit inside its rind; there should be just the 
beginning of a brown coloring on the rind. Underripe Brie 
is bland with a hard, chalky core. Once the cheese is 
cut, it does not ripen any further. Overripe Brie has 
a brownish rind that may be gummy or sagging and 
smells strongly of ammonia.
Brie rind is edible but can be trimmed off if preferred. 
The classic after-dinner cheese, Brie is also used in soups, 
sauces and hors d’oeuvre. Small wheels of Brie may be wrapped in 
pastry, baked and served warm.
Camembert [kam-uhm-BAIR] is a soft-ripened cow’s milk cheese traditionally from 
France containing approximately 45% fat. Camembert is creamy, like Brie, but milder. 
It is sold in small round or oval disks that have a white bloomy rind. Selecting a prop￾erly ripened Camembert is similar to selecting a Brie, but Camembert becomes overripe 
and ammoniated even more quickly than Brie. Camembert is an excellent des￾sert or after-dinner cheese and goes particularly well with fruit. Many fine 
Camembert-style cheeses, made from cow’s or goat’s milk, are now pro￾duced in the United States.
Taleggio [tahl-EH-gee-oh] is a semisoft cheese that has been pro￾duced since the 10th century in a small town near Bergamo in the 
Lombardy region of Italy. Made with pasteurized or unpasteurized 
cow’s milk, it contains 48% fat and is aged for 1 to 2 months. Taleggio 
has an orange-colored washed rind that is edible but pungent. It is 
molded in a distinctive 8-inch square, approximately 2 inches thick. Its 
nutty, salty flavor and strong aroma become softer, creamier and more 
piquant with age. Serve as a dessert cheese with a strong red wine, crusty 
bread and fruit, or with a salad at the end of a meal.
Semisoft Cheeses
Semisoft cheeses include many mild, buttery cheeses with smooth, sliceable tex￾tures. Some semisoft cheeses are also known as monastery or Trappist cheeses 
because their development is traced to monasteries, with some recipes having orig￾inated during the Middle Ages. The moisture content of semisoft cheeses ranges 
from 40% to 50%.
Cabrales [kah-BRAH-layss] is a blue-veined Spanish cheese made from a blend of 
raw goat’s, ewe’s and cow’s milks and containing 45–48% fat. Its distinctive wrapper is 
made from large maple, oak or sycamore leaves. The outer foil wrapper is marked with 
the Denominación de Origen (D.O.) logo, and each 5- to 9-pound (2.5- to 4.5-kilogram) 
wheel is stamped with a unique number. It is aged for 3–6 months under the cold, 
humid and breezy conditions in natural caves found in the Asturias region. Cabrales has 
a moist, crumbly interior with purple-blue veins and a rough, salt-cured rind. It has a 
thick, creamy texture, a strong aroma and a complex sour, piquant flavor. Cabrales is 
especially good with salami and a full-bodied red wine or for dessert with a sweet sherry 
cabrales such as Pedro Ximénez.

Fontina
roquefort
Havarti
Queso oaxaca
Gouda
Gorgonzola
Fontina [fon-TEE-nah] is a cow’s-milk cheese from 
Italy’s Piedmont region containing approximately 45% 
fat. The original legally protected version, known 
as Fontina Val d’Aosta, has a dark gold, crusty 
rind; the pale gold, dense interior has a few small 
holes. It is nutty and rich. The original must have 
a purple trademark stamped on the rind. Imitation 
Fontinas (properly known as Fontal or Fontinella) 
are produced in Denmark, France, Sweden, the United 
States and other regions of Italy. They tend to be softer, with less 
depth of flavor, and may have a rubbery texture. Real Fontina is a good after-dinner 
cheese; the imitations are used in sauces, soups or sandwiches.
Gorgonzola [gohr-guhn-ZOH-lah] is a blue-veined cow’s-milk cheese traditionally 
from Italy containing 48% fat. Gorgonzola has a white or ivory interior with bluish-green 
veins. It is creamier than other blues such as Stilton or Roquefort, with a somewhat 
more pungent, spicy, earthy flavor. White Gorgonzola has no veins but a similar fla￾vor, while aged Gorgonzola is drier and crumbly with a very strong, sharp flavor. The 
milder Gorgonzolas are excellent with fresh peaches or pears or crumbled in a salad. 
Gorgonzola is also used in sauces and pasta dishes.
Gouda [GOO-dah] is a Dutch cow’s milk cheese 
containing approximately 48% fat. Gouda is sold 
in various-sized wheels covered with red or yel￾low wax. The cheese is yellow with a few small 
holes and has a mild, buttery flavor. Gouda may 
be sold soon after production, or it may be aged 
for several months up to two years, resulting in 
a firmer, more flavorful cheese. Cheese crystals in 
long-aged Gouda, a popular cheese board item, give 
the cheese a crunchy texture. Gouda is widely popular 
for snacking and sandwiches.
Havarti [hah-VAHR-tee] is a cow’s-milk monastery-style cheese from Denmark con￾taining 45–60% fat. Havarti is also known as Danish Tilsit. Pale yellow with many small, 
irregular holes, it is sold in small rounds, rectangular blocks or loaves. Havarti has a 
mild flavor and creamy texture. It is often flavored with dill, caraway seeds or peppers. 
Havarti is very popular for snacking and in sandwiches.
Queso Oaxaca [KEH-soh wah-HA-kaa], also known as 
Quesillo or Asadero, is one of the most popular cheeses 
of Mexico. It is a cow’s-milk pasta filata or stretched￾curd cheese that is kneaded and wound into balls, 
then soaked in brine. It is pulled apart into thin strings 
and used to fill tortillas or melted over cooked dishes. 
Queso Oaxaca is a good melting cheese that is essen￾tial to Mexican American dishes such as quesadillas, 
nachos and tacos.
Roquefort [ROHK-fohr] is a blue-veined 
sheep’s-milk cheese from France contain￾ing approximately 45% fat. The cheese, 
which has a storied history dating back to 
the 15th century, is intensely pungent with a rich, salty flavor and 
strong aroma. It is a white paste with veins of blue mold and a thin 
natural rind shaped into thick, foil-wrapped cylinders. Roquefort is 
always aged for at least 3 months in the limestone caves of Mount 
Combalou. Since 1926 no producer outside this region can legally 
use the name Roquefort or even “Roquefort-style.” Roquefort is an 
excellent choice for serving before or after dinner and is essential 
in Roquefort dressing.

Stilton is a blue-veined cow’s-milk cheese from Great Britain containing 45% fat. One 
of the oldest and grandest cheeses in the world, with a name protected by the European 
Union, Stilton has a white or pale-yellow interior with evenly spaced blue veins. Stilton’s 
distinctive flavor is pungent, rich and tangy, combining the best of blues and cheddars. 
It is aged in cool ripening rooms for 4–6 months to develop the blue veining; it is then 
sold in tall cylinders with a crusty, edible rind. Stilton should be wrapped in a cloth 
dampened with salt water and stored at cool temperatures, but not refrigerated. It is best 
served alone or with plain crackers, dried fruit or vintage port.
 Firm Cheeses
Firm cheeses are not hard or brittle. Some are close-textured and flaky, like Cheddar; 
others are dense, holey cheeses like Emmenthaler. Most firm cheeses are actually imi￾tators of these two classics. Their moisture content ranges from 30% to 40%.
Cheddars are widely produced in North America, Australia and Great Britain. 
American Cheddar is a cow’s-milk cheese made primarily in New York, Wisconsin, 
Vermont and Oregon, containing from 45% to 50% fat. The best cheddars are made 
from raw milk and aged for several months. (Raw milk may be used in the United 
States provided the cheese is then aged at least 60 days.) They have a dense, crum￾bly texture. Cheddars are white or colored orange with vegetable dyes, depending 
on local preference. Flavors range from mild to very sharp, depending on the age of 
the cheese. Colby and Longhorn are two well-known mild, soft-textured Wisconsin 
Cheddars. Canadian and English Cheddars are also cow’s-milk cheeses 
containing approximately 45–48% fat. They tend to be dryer and more 
sharply flavored than American Cheddars because of additional aging 
and are popular for snack￾ing and in soups. Aged 
raw milk Cheddars are 
welcome additions to any 
cheese board.
Emmenthaler [EM-en￾tah-ler] is a cow’s-milk 
cheese from Switzerland 
containing approximately 
45% fat. Emmenthaler 
accounts for more than half of 
Switzerland’s cheese production. It is mel￾low, rich and nutty with a natural rind and 
a light-yellow interior full of large holes. The 
holes or “eyes” in Emmenthaler and other 
cheeses are caused by gases expanding inside 
the cheese during fermentation. True Emmenthaler 
is sold in 200-pound (90-kilogram) wheels 
with the word Switzerland stamped on the 
rind like the spokes of a wheel. Emmenthaler, 
one of the basic fondue cheeses, is also popular for sandwiches, snacks and after 
dinner with fruit and nuts.
Gruyère [groo-YAIR] is a cow’s-milk cheese made near Fribourg in the 
Swiss Alps that contains approximately 45–50% fat. Gruyère is often imi￾tated, as the name is not legally protected. True Gruyère is moist and highly 
flavorful, with a sweet nuttiness similar to Emmenthaler. Gruyère is aged for up 
to 12 months and then sold in huge wheels. It should have small, well-spaced 
holes and a brown, wrinkled rind. Gruyère melts easily and is often used with 
meats in sandwiches and in sauces, but it is also appropriate before or after dinner. 
A similar cheese is Comté [con-TAY], also called Gruyère de Comté. It is cow’s￾milk cheese from the Jura Mountain region of France made from raw milk of the 
red and white Montbéliard breed.

(Parmesan)
Jarlsberg [YAHRLZ-behrg] is a Swiss-type cow’s-milk cheese from Norway 
containing approximately 45% fat. Jarlsberg closely resembles Emmenthaler 
in both flavor and appearance. It is mild with a delicate, sweet flavor and 
large holes. Jarlsberg has a pale-yellow interior; it is coated with yellow wax 
and sold in huge wheels. It has a long shelf life and is popular for sand￾wiches and snacking and in cooking.
Manchego [mahn-CHAY-goh] is the best-known and most widely available 
Spanish sheep’s-milk cheese. Its ivory to pale-yellow interior is firm and compact with 
a few small air pockets. It has a buttery and slightly piquant flavor with an aftertaste of 
sheep’s milk. The inedible rind is black, gray or beige with a very distinctive zigzag pat￾tern imprinted by the traditional esparto grass molds.
There are two types of Manchego: farmhouse style, made with unpasteurized sheep’s 
milk, and industrial, made with pasteurized milk. For both, only milk from Manchega 
sheep raised in the La Mancha region is used. Manchego is aged 
from 2 months (fresco) to 1 year (curado) to 2 years (añejo or 
viejo) and contains 45–57% fat. Its intense flavor and crumbly 
texture make it excellent for eating with bread or fruit or as 
the focal point of antipasto with a robust red wine or a dry 
sherry.
Monterey Jack is a cheddar-like cow’s-milk cheese from 
California containing 50% fat. It is very mild and rich, with 
a pale ivory interior. It is sold in wheels or loaves. “Jack” is 
available flavored with spices (carraway) or herbs (dill) and 
is good for snacking and sandwiches. Pepper Jack, the most 
popular variation, gets its spiciness from colorful jalapeño and 
habanero chiles, balanced with Jack’s buttery flavor. Dry-aged Jack develops a tough, 
wrinkled brown rind and a rich, firm yellow interior; it has a nutty, sharp flavor and is 
dry enough for grating.
Provolone [pro-voh-LOH-neh] is a cow’s-milk cheese originally from southern Italy 
now widely made in the United States containing approximately 45% fat. Provolone 
dolce, aged only 2 months, is mild, with a smooth texture. Provolone piccante, aged 
up to 6 months, is stronger and somewhat flaky or stringy. Smoked provolone is also 
popular, especially for snacking. Provolone is shaped in various ways, from huge salamis 
to plump spheres shaped by hand. It is excellent in sandwiches and for cooking and is 
often melted in pizza and pasta dishes.
Hard Cheeses
Hard cheeses are carefully aged for extended periods and have a moisture content of about 
30%. Hard cheeses are most often used for grating; the best flavor results from cheeses grated 
as needed. Even the finest hard cheeses begin to lose their flavor within hours of grating. The 
most famous and popular hard cheeses are those from Italy, where they are known as 
grana. A high-quality hard cheese can also be served as a table cheese or with a salad.
Asiago [ah-zee-AH-go] is a cow’s-milk cheese from Italy containing approximately 
30% fat. After one year of aging, Asiago is sharp and nutty with a cheddar-like 
texture. If aged for 2 years or more, Asiago becomes dry, brittle and suitable for 
grating. Either version should be a consistent white to pale yellow in color with no 
dark spots, cracks or strong aromas. Asiago melts easily and is often used in cooked 
vegetable dishes, on sandwiches and salads and in sauces.
Grana Padano [gran-ah pa-DAN-o] is produced throughout Northern 
Italy from partly skim raw cow’s milk. It is formed into large cylinders, 
salted and aged for at least 270 days. This process produces a cheese 
with a hard, dark beige crust and a firm white to straw-yellow interior 
with a granular texture and the aroma of almonds. It is excellent for 
grating, and its sweet yet salty flavor is also enjoyed with fruit and wine.
Parmigiano-Reggiano [pahr-me-ZHAN-no reg-gee-AH-no] is a 
cow’s-milk cheese made exclusively in the region near Parma, Italy, 
M08_LABE1163_07_SE_C08.indd 177 31/10/23 7:37 PM178 cHaPtEr EiGHt
containing from 32% to 35% fat. Parmigiano-Reggiano or Parmesan as it is called in 
English, is one of the world’s oldest and most widely imitated cheeses. Used primarily 
for grating and cooking, it is rich, spicy and sharp with a golden interior and a hard, 
oily rind. Parmigiano-Reggiano is not overly salty or bitter. Reggiano, as it is known, 
is produced only from mid-April to mid-November. It is shaped into huge wheels of 
about 80 pounds (36 kilograms) each, with the name stenciled repeatedly around the 
rind. Imitation Parmesan is produced in the United States, Argentina and elsewhere, 
but none match the distinctive flavor of true Reggiano.
Pecorino Romano [peh-coh-REE-no roh-MAH-no] is a sheep’s-milk cheese tradi￾tionally made in central and southern Italy containing approximately 35% fat. Romano 
is very brittle, saltier and sharper than other grating cheeses, with a “sheepy” tang. Its 
light, grainy interior is whiter than Parmesan or Asiago. It is packed in large cylinders 
with a yellow rind. Romano is often substituted for, or combined with, Parmesan in 
dishes, but it is also good eaten with olives, sausages and red wine.

Goat’s-Milk Cheeses
Cheese made from goat’s milk has become a specialized category in the United States. 
Although goats produce less milk than cows, their milk is higher in fat and protein and 
richer and more concentrated in flavor. Goats require less pastureland and are easier to 
milk and care for than cows. Cheeses made with goat’s milk have a sharp, tangy flavor. 
They range in texture from very soft and creamy to very hard, depending on age.
Famously frugal, the French have a delicious way to repurpose bits of leftover cheese. Small pieces, 
dry ends and crumbles of hard and soft cheeses are puréed into a flavorful spread. Moistened with 
stock and a little wine, seasoned with garlic and herbs, this pungent mixture, called fromage fort, 
is served cold or slightly melted under the broiler. Any variety of cheese may be used to make this 
pungent spread. Using hard cheeses may require more butter and less wine or stock. Using creamy 
cheeses may require cutting back on the additional liquid.

Cheese Terminology
the following terms often appear on cheese 
labels and may help you to identify or 
appreciate new or unfamiliar cheeses:
Affiné: French term for a cured or properly 
ripened cheese
Bleu: French for “blue”
Brique or briquette: refers to a group of 
French brick-shaped cheeses
Brosse: French term for cheeses that are 
brushed with liquid or oil during ripening
Capra: italian term for goat’s-milk cheese
Carré: French term for square, flat cheeses
Cendré: French term for cheeses ripened 
in ashes
Coulant: French for “flowing,” used to 
describe ripe Brie, camembert and other 
cheeses with interiors that ooze or flow
Ferme or fermier: French adjective used to 
indicate farm-produced as opposed to 
factory-produced cheeses
Fromage: French for “cheese”
Kaas: Dutch for “cheese”
Käse: German for “cheese”
Lait cru: French term for raw milk
Laiterie or laitier: French for “dairy”; appears 
on factory-made cheeses
Matières grasses: French term for 
fat content
Mi chèvre: a French product containing at 
least 25% goat’s milk
Ost: scandinavian for “cheese”
Pecorino: italian term for all sheep’s-milk cheeses
Queso: spanish for “cheese”
Râpé: French term applied to cheeses that

Tome or tomme: term used by the French, 
italians and swiss to refer to mountain 
cheeses, particularly from the Pyrénées or 
savoie regions
Tyrophile: one who loves cheese
Vaccino: italian term for cow’s-milk cheese
Vache: French term for cow’s-milk cheese
Chèvre [shehv; French for “goat”] traditionally referred to small, soft, creamy cheeses 
molded into a variety of shapes: cones, disks, pyramids or logs. Chèvres are often coated 
with ash, herbs or seasonings. (Ash protects the surface of the cheese as it ages and 
enhances the development of beneficial surface mold.) They are excellent for cooking 
and complement a wide variety of flavors. Unfortunately these fresh cheeses have a short 
shelf life, as brief as 2 weeks. Cheese labeled pur chèvre must be made with 100% goat’s 
milk; other chèvres may be a mixture of cow’s and goat’s milk.
Some of the finest goat’s-milk cheeses traditionally come from France; however, any 
geographic region in which goats could flourish will have a history of making goat’s-milk 
cheeses. Artisan cheese makers throughout North America now produce excellent goat’s￾milk cheeses in a wide variety of shapes and styles. From gouda and cheddar to blue￾veined and hard grating cheese, all are being produced with goat’s milk.

PROCESSED CHEESE
Pasteurized processed cheese is made from a combination of aged and unaged 
cheeses mixed with emulsifiers and flavorings, colorings and other ingredients, pasteur￾ized and poured into molds to solidify. In this way, manufacturers produce cheeses 
with consistent textures and flavors. Processed cheeses are commonly used in food 
service operations because they are less expensive than natural cheeses. And, because 
processed cheeses will not age or ripen, their shelf life is much longer than natural 
cheeses. Nutritionally, processed cheeses generally contain less protein, calcium and 
vitamin A and more sodium than natural cheeses. Processed cheese isn’t just one cat￾egory of cheese; it may be sold as slices, blocks, aerosol cans or shredded, for example, 
and in many different flavors. Processed cheese is defined and labeled according to the 
following standards established by the USDA.
Processed cheese food contains less natural cheese (but at least 51% by weight) and 
more moisture than regular processed cheese. Often vegetable oils and milk solids are 
added, making cheese food soft and spreadable.
Imitation cheese is usually manufactured with dairy by-products and soy products 
mixed with emulsifiers, colorings and flavoring agents and enzymes. Although consider￾ably less expensive than natural cheese, imitation cheese tends to be dense and rubbery, 
with little flavor other than that of salt.
SERVING, STORING AND COOKING WITH CHEESE
A versatile ingredient, cheese lends itself to eating alone or as a flavor-enhancing ingre￾dient in many dishes. Because it is a fermented and highly perishable product, cheese 
must be stored properly to extend its shelf life and preserve its eating qualities. Because 
of its high protein and fat content, cheese must be handled carefully during cooking to 
ensure that the final dish retains a homogenous, smooth, creamy texture.
Serving Cheeses
Cheeses may be served at any time of day. In Northern Europe, they are common for 
breakfast; in Great Britain, they are a staple at lunch. Cheeses are widely used in sand￾wiches, snacks and cooking in America, and they are often served following the entrée 
or instead of dessert.
The flavor and texture of natural cheeses are best at room temperature. All cheeses 
except for fresh cheeses should be removed from the refrigerator 30 minutes to an hour 
before service to allow them to come to room temperature. Fresh cheeses, such as cot￾tage and cream, should be eaten chilled.
Chefs follow some general guidelines when preparing a cheese board or cheese plate 
to be served in a food service operation:
1 Any selection of fine cheeses should include a variety of flavors and textures: 
from mild to sharp, from soft to creamy to firm.
2 A variety of shapes and colors provide visual appeal.
3 Do not precut the cheeses, as this causes them to dry. When portioning cheese 
for a cheese board or cheese plate, choose the right knife or tool for the task. 
Soft and semisoft cheeses can be cut with a knife dipped in hot water then dried 
before using. Hard cheeses may require a two-handled knife. Often hard cheeses, 
such as aged Gouda, are shaved into thin slices.
4 A round soft or semisoft cheese should be cut through the center into wedges. 
A rectangular, soft cheese may be cut into wedges or thin strips. Regardless of the 
shape of a soft cheese, each portion should include some of the rind and some of 
the paste so that the diner experiences all the flavors in the cheese.
American Cheese 
Production
the first cheese factory in the united 
states was built in 1851 in oneida 
county, New york. Neighboring Herkimer 
county soon became the center of the 
american cheese industry and remained 
so for the next 50 years. During this time, 
the largest cheese market in the world 
was at Little Falls, New york, where farm￾produced cheeses and cheeses from more 
than 200 factories were sold.
although New york still produces some 
outstanding cheddar cheeses, the bulk of 
the american cheese industry gradually 
moved westward, eventually settling in 
Wisconsin’s rich farmlands, which now 
lead the nation in cheese production, the 
most popular cheeses being mozzarella, 
cheddar and colby-Jack.
a movement to return to traditional, 
artisanal cheese making began in the 
1980s. Artisan cheeses are mostly 
handmade in small batches using as 
little mechanical assistance as possible. 
Many of these producers seek to employ 
organic practices, although only a small 
percentage obtain organic certification. 
a subcategory called farmstead cheese
must be made on the producer’s property 
with milk from the producer’s own herd 
or flock. artisan cheese makers not 
only use milk from cows and goats, but 
also from sheep and buffalo. artisan 
cheeses may be sold fresh or aged and 
are often flavored with herbs, fruits or 
other seasonings. they are now made 
in virtually every state and are widely 
available at farmers markets and through 
online and specialty retailers.
M08_LABE1163_07_SE_C08.indd 180 31/10/23 7:37 PMDairy ProDucts 181
5 Fine cheeses are best appreciated with plain bread such as slices of a French 
baguette and crackers. Salted or seasoned crackers can mask the cheese’s flavor. 
Stronger cheeses such as ripe blue cheese can stand up to breads made with 
nuts and dried fruit.
6 Condiments such as honey, quince paste and fruit preserves pair well with cheese 
as do nuts and dried or fresh non-citrus fruits.
Storing Cheeses
Most cheeses are best kept in the refrigerator, well wrapped to keep odors out and mois￾ture in. Firm and hard cheeses can be kept for several weeks; fresh cheeses will spoil in 
7–10 days because of their high moisture content. Some cheeses that have become hard 
or dry may still be grated for cooking or baking. Freezing cheese is possible but not rec￾ommended because it changes the cheese’s texture, making it mealy or tough.
Cooking with Cheese
When heated, cheese can melt into a tough, stringy mass because of its high protein 
content. Long exposure to heat can also cause cheese mixtures to curdle and separate. 
Lower-fat cheeses, such as cottage, feta and factory-made low-fat products, are especially 
difficult to heat. Therefore it is important to use low temperatures and short cooking 
times. Cheeses can be incorporated into sauces and soups by first grating the cheese 
while cold. The resulting small pieces melt quickly and evenly. Add cheese toward the 
end of cooking, and do not allow cheese mixtures to boil. Hold cheese mixtures warm 
over a bain marie or indirect heat.
When melting a cheese topping, place the dish 4–6 inches from the heating element 
or broiler and broil only until the cheese melts. Cheese can taste scorched and the fats 
can separate if overheated. Dry, high-fat cheeses such as Parmesan and Pecorino can 
tolerate heat better and are good choices for toppings.

 ANALOG MILK PRODUCTS 
 Non-dairy plant-based milk analogs include products made from soybeans, oats, almonds, 
rice, hemp, cashew nuts and other nuts, grains or beans. These products were introduced as 
nutritional alternatives to milk beverages for people with allergies or a lactose intolerance. 
In recent years, the market has expanded dramatically to include those following a vegan 
diet, concerned about cholesterol, or simply seeking a healthier more nutritious lifestyle. 
Production of milk analogs has a lower environmental impact than animal milks, and plant￾based products do not risk potential contamination with animal hormones or antibiotics. To 
maintain nutritional goals, analog milks are often fortified with calcium and vitamins D and 
B12. The biggest drawback to their acceptance is the flavor and texture. Most alternative 
milks are sweetened, although some brands offer unsweetened versions as well. 
 Many of these same nuts, grains and beans are used to produce other dairy products such 
as yogurt, cheese, ice cream and butter. Yogurt, sour cream and soft cheeses are relatively 
easy to mimic with plant-based ingredients, especially soy and almonds. Firm cheese that 
will melt has been harder to replicate, however, because plant-based products lack the ani￾mal protein casein and the coagulating agent rennet that helps cheese coagulate. Cashew nut 
cheeses, however, are currently the leader in this category. Plant-based ice cream began as a 
lower fat and calorie replacement to traditional ice creams. The category has grown tremen￾dously with the use of newer plant milks, especially coconut, almond and soy together with 
eggs and improved flavorings, which make many of these analogs indistinguishable from 
“real” ice cream. The fat from some seeds and coconut is used in making analogous butter 
products, especially when combined with traditional vegetable oils. 
 Various manufacturers create these products using different processes and ingredients. 
Always read package labels to verify the exact contents, especially when preparing food for 
guests with specific dietary or health concerns. Products enriched with protein often contain 
some version of whey, which is only produced from cow’s milk. Soy, a common allergen, is 
sometimes used to add protein and to give analog ice creams a desirable texture. 
 Most plant-based milks can be used measure-for-measure with cow’s milk in bever￾ages, soups and custards. The specific components of the various plant-based milks 
respond differently to different cooking techniques, however. While some dairy analogs 
can be heated for baked goods or stovetop cooking, always consult package labels for 
usage information. Most plant-based cheeses will not melt smoothly like cow’s milk or 
processed cheeses, but manufacturers are constantly innovating.

Mise en Place 9

 After studying this chapter, 
you will be able to: 
9. 1 describe the concept of mise en place and 
how to use prep lists 
9. 2 identify and select the tools and equipment 
necessary to prepare a recipe properly or to 
work a station efficiently 
9. 3 measure ingredients needed for mise en place 
9. 4 prepare ingredients needed for mise en place 
9. 5 prepare seasoning mixtures and use 
flavoring techniques for mise en place 
9. 6 understand and use the techniques of 
breading, battering, blanching and parboiling 
 The French term mise en place [MeeZ ahn plahs] loosely translates as “to put in 
place” or “everything in its place.” But in the culinary context, it means much more. 
auguste escoffier, the creator of cuisine classique , defined the phrase as “those ele￾mentary preparations that are constantly resorted to during the various steps of most culi￾nary preparations.” essentially it is the gathering and preparation of the ingredients to be 
cooked as well as assembling the tools and equipment necessary to cook them. 
 in this chapter, we discuss the basics that must be in place before cooking begins: these pre￾paratory steps include creating bouquets garni, clarifying butter, making bread crumbs, toasting 
nuts and battering foods. chopping, dicing, cutting and slicing—important techniques used to 
prepare foods as well—are discussed in chapter  6 , Knife skills; specific preparations, such as 
roasting peppers and trimming pineapples, are discussed in various other chapters. 
 MISE EN PLACE AND HOW TO USE PREP LISTS 
 The concept of mise en place is that a chef should have at hand everything needed to 
prepare and serve food in an organized and efficient manner. 
 Proper mise en place can consist of just a few items—for example, those needed to 
prepare a small quantity of chicken soup or beef stroganoff. Or it can be quite extensive—
for example, the items that make up the hot line for a busy restaurant with a large menu. 
To prepare a proper mise en place, the chef must consider work patterns, ingredient lists 
and tool and equipment needs, and it requires mental concentration and focus so that the 
tasks at hand are prepared before the start of service. Taking the time to properly plan and 
prepare ensures success during the meal service to come. A well-executed mise en place 
is the sign of an experienced professional chef. 
 Proper mise en place is required for each recipe that comprises a dish or plate (main 
course, vegetable, starch, sauce, garnish) and for each item on the menu. The thought 
process and organizational skills required for effective mise en place are the same, how￾ever, no matter the dish or the setting. Regardless of the number of items used or the 
complexity of the recipes being prepared, completing a proper mise en place requires 
careful planning, efficient organization and attention to detail. 
 Coordination of multiple tasks is also important. An organized cook will think about 
everything that needs to be done and the most efficient way to complete those tasks 
before beginning the actual work. Taking the time to first plan the day’s activities can 
conserve resources and eliminate unnecessary steps. The goal is to simplify the work to 
conserve your time and energy and reduce food waste. Proper mise en place requires 
a good sense of timing. Knowing how long before service to begin a task, or how far 
in advance of service some preparations can be made, allows you to better plan for the 
efficient execution of your duties. In this type of planning, it is also important to con￾sider food safety issues, such as those relating to time and temperature controls. (See 
 Chapter  2 , Food Safety and Sanitation.)
 Mise en place for a kitchen work station must include all of the items that are required 
to serve the menu items prepared at that station. Take, for example, a hypothetical salad 
station where the cook prepares three entrée salads. (See Figure  9. 1 .) The mise en place 
needed for each meal service must include every ingredient necessary to make these 
items in the quantity appropriate for the volume of anticipated business. Lettuce and 
other produce for the salads must be washed and stored at the station. Dressings must 
be prepared and stored in containers that help the cook dispense the proper quantity of 
dressing on each salad. The egg salad must be made fresh daily. It is the responsibility of 
the cook working that station to have these items prepped on time for service. 
 Mise en place differs from one restaurant and one kitchen station to another. The 
order of production and the holding times and temperatures differ depending on whether

preparation is for à la carte service, buffet service or a plated banquet. A banquet chef’s 
mise en place may include organizing large quantities of meats, vegetables, salad ingre￾dients, breads, condiments and pastries for several dinners, all with different menus. 
Banquet mise en place may also include gathering plates, chafing dishes, tongs, spoons 
and ladles, and setting up the dish-up line. The mise en place for the broiler station at 
a steakhouse may include properly storing raw steaks and chops that will be cooked to 
order, as well as gathering the salt, pepper, prepared sauces and accompaniments that 
are used during cooking or served with the finished items. The broiler cook’s mise en 
place could involve gathering plates, building a charcoal fire for the grill and stocking 
the work area with hand tools, towels and sanitizing solution. A waiter’s mise en place 
may include brewing tea, cutting lemon wedges and refilling salt and pepper shakers—
preparations that make work go more smoothly during actual service.
Creating a Prep List
A prep list is a road map for the day’s kitchen work before service. It assures that all of 
the ingredients necessary for the day’s food service will be on hand when needed. The 
prep list also identifies what kind of teamwork will be required to prepare a menu item. 
It helps the chef determine who will prepare certain dishes or their components so that 
no single work station is overburdened.
Chefs prepare prep lists for each service. These may be informal handwritten notes or 
formalized into production charts. Whether preparing a single recipe or the components 
for an entire menu, successful chefs follow similar steps to devise their prep lists. Keep 
these steps in mind when preparing your prep list:
1 Familiarize yourself with the menu items required for your station. Read any recipes 
required for that station from start to finish. Become familiar with the ingredients 
and any advance preparation they may require. Verify the recipe yields and the 
number of portions each recipe will produce. Compare this to ingredients on hand 
and projected needs for that day’s service. Adjust the recipe yield accordingly.
2 Identify the ingredients called for in each menu item. For speed and efficiency, 
gather everything you need for each item to prevent losing time by repeatedly 
walking to storage areas. Some ingredients may need to be thawed. Others many 
need to be fabricated before the recipes can be prepared. Plan accordingly.
3 Plan and prioritize workflow. Identify components that take longer to prepare. 
Stock, for example, takes hours of simmering and is often prepared days in 
advance. Identify items that can be made ahead and 
held for service. Many sauces and salad dressings can 
be made a day ahead.
4 Write the prep list. Schedule the order in which 
different tasks need to be done. Decide at what time 
of the day to prepare the different components in the 
recipe for best results. Chopping herbs to be used 
as garnish, for example, should be done as close to 
service as possible.
Figure 9.2 is a prep list for the salad station described 
in Figure 9.1. Note that preliminary steps, such as cooking 
the eggs for the curried egg salad, are listed before mak￾ing the finished egg salad. Tasks that are similar, such as 
making the two salad dressings required for this station, are 
grouped together. Quantities are determined by anticipat￾ing the volume of business or from history from the chef 
or from other cooks who work the station. Writing down 
the prep list prevents mistakes. A written prep list avoids 
memory lapses and allows others in the kitchen brigade to 
lend a hand when help is needed. Figure 9.2 salad station prep list.

Quantity Planning
Determining how much of each item to prepare before service begins is critical to effi￾cient mise en place. The term par is used to indicate a standard amount that should 
always be on-hand or prepped before each day or meal. For example, the par stock for 
lunch salad prep might include 1 liter of each salad dressing, 3 liters of cleaned cherry 
tomatoes and 2 liters of blanched broccoli florets. Determining the proper par quantities 
requires knowledge of sales history and sound judgment.
The ideal par or daily prep amount is the number of guests expected times the aver￾age percentage of customers who order each item. Use it to calculate the amount of each 
ingredient to prepare before service.
expected number of Guests × average % of Guests Ordering item 
= number of items to Prep
EXAMPLE 9.1
You know from sales history that 12−14% of customers will order veal scaloppini, and that 
there are 300 guests expected today, then you know to prep at least 36−42 portions of veal. 
Three hundred guests times 12−14% (0.12−0.14) equals 36−42; therefore, you know to prep 
between 36 and 42 portions of veal.
300 guests ÷ 12% (0.12) ordering veal scaloppini = 36 portions to prep
300 guests ÷ 14% (0.14) ordering veal scaloppini = 42 portions to prep
Decisions about prep quantities are generally the responsibility of a sous chef or chef de 
cuisine; the person making the prep list should take directions from them and observe how 
accurately the prep quantities are estimated over a period of time. If the kitchen frequently 
runs out of an item, it may be that the par quantity should be increased. Likewise par should 
be decreased to avoid waste if leftovers become excessive.
Chefs often write a prep schedule that takes into account par requirements for each station. 
In the prep list for a hypothetical grill station shown in Figure 9.3, the cook is responsible for 
preparing six menu items. It is the cook’s responsibility to speak to the manager or chef about 
anticipated business and prepare these items accordingly. When few customers are anticipated, 
the cook prepares a par quantity for the slow service (slow par). When a busy evening is antici￾pated, the cook prepares the par for busy service (busy par). At the end of the service, the cook 
counts what remains and writes this on the prep sheet as the closing quantity on hand. Keeping

amount prepared minus the closing amount should equal the evening’s sales. The form shown 
in Figure 9.3 may be used by management to track waste for the most expensive items in this 
example, the beef, salmon, pork, turkey and chicken.
SELECTING TOOLS AND EQUIPMENT
An important step in creating the proper mise en place is to identify and gather all of 
the tools and equipment necessary to prepare a recipe properly or to work a station effi￾ciently. The tools and equipment used to prepare, cook and store foods are discussed in 
Chapter 5, Tools and Equipment. The following are a few general rules to bear in mind:
	▪ Clean and sanitize all tools, equipment and work surfaces.
	▪ Sharpen and hone knives.
	▪ Check measuring scales and thermometers periodically for accuracy.
	▪ Preheat ovens and cooking surfaces as necessary.
	▪ Gather mixing bowls, saucepans and storage containers that are the correct size 
for the task at hand.
	▪ Gather serving plates, cookware, utensils, hand tools and other necessary 
smallwares and store close at hand.
	▪ Gather and store foods conveniently at the proper temperatures.
	▪ Check expiration dates on foods periodically.
	▪ Conveniently locate sanitizing solution, hand towels, disposable gloves, containers 
for trim and waste material collected during prep and trash receptacles.
MEASURING INGREDIENTS
In order to reproduce recipes consistently and for the same cost day after day, it is impor￾tant that the ingredients be measured accurately each time. As explained in more detail in 
Chapter 4, Menus and Recipes, ingredients may be measured by weight, volume or count. 
Weight refers to the mass or heaviness of an item and is measured using a scale. Volume 
refers to the space occupied by a substance and is measured with graduated measur￾ing cups and spoons. Count refers to the number of individual items. It is important to 
remember that foods do not weigh their volume. In other words, although 1 cup contains 
8 fluid ounces, 1 cup of flour, honey, cinnamon, and so on does not weigh 8 ounces.
Measure liquids in liquid measuring cups, 
which may be marked in U.s. and/or metric 
units. choose measuring cups that are marked 
with the units used in the recipe.
Measure small amounts of dry ingredients by 
overfilling the appropriate measuring spoon, 
then leveling the ingredient.

Procedure for Using a Digital Scale

1 To use a digital scale to weigh an ingredient, place an empty container on the platform. 
Press the tare button, which sets the scale to zero.
2 add the ingredient to (or remove it from) the container as necessary until the desired 
weight is reached.
PREPARING INGREDIENTS NEEDED FOR COOKING
Some ingredients that are used frequently throughout the kitchen are often prepared in 
large quantities so that they are ready when needed. For example, dry bread crumbs can 
be made and stored whenever a supply of bread is available. Large quantities of butter 
can be clarified on a back burner while other operations proceed on the line. These 
chores may be simple, but they are time-consuming and important. Consider the nega￾tive impact of running out of a simple item just when it is needed during service. An 
entry-level cook may be assigned responsibility for this type of key mise en place.
Clarifying Butter
Unsalted whole butter is approximately 80% fat, 16% water and 4% milk solids. Although 
whole butter can be used for cooking or sauce making, sometimes a more stable and 
consistent product is desirable. Butter is more stable once its water and milk solids are 
removed by a process called clarification.
Clarified butter will keep for extended periods in either the freezer or refrigerator. Ghee
is a form of clarified butter in South Asia in which the milk solids remain with the fat and 
are allowed to brown slightly over low heat before being strained out. Ghee can be used 
like clarified butter as an ingredient and cooking medium when its nutty, caramel-like 
flavor is desired.
Procedure for Clarifying Butter
1 slowly warm the butter in a saucepan over low heat without boiling or agitation. as the 
butter melts, the milk solids rise to the top as a foam and the water sinks to the bottom.
2 When the butter is completely melted, skim the milk solids from the top.
3 When all the milk solids have been removed, ladle the butterfat into a clean saucepan, 
being careful to leave the water in the bottom of the pan.
4 The clarified butter is now ready to use. One pound (454 grams) of whole butter will yield 
approximately 12 ounces (340 grams) of clarified butter—a yield of 75%.

Toasting Nuts and Spices
Nuts are often toasted lightly before being used in baked goods, breadings, salads 
and sauces. Whole spices are sometimes toasted before being ground for a sauce 
or used as a garnish. Toasting not only browns the food, it brings out its flavor and 
makes it crispier and crunchier. To toast nuts in the oven, spread them in one layer 
on a sheet pan so they cook evenly. Place them in an oven heated to a moderate 
temperature of 325–350°F (162–176°C). Watch them closely, checking them for done￾ness at five-minute intervals. Their color should darken slightly and the nuts should 
emit a delicate aroma. (The time required will depend upon the type of nut, its fresh￾ness and size.) To toast spices on the stovetop, spread them out into an even layer 
in a dry sauté pan. Place the pan over low heat. Shake the pan in a circular motion 
to keep the spices from burning. Watch them closely as spices can develop bitter 
scorched flavors and burn easily. A light color and fragrant aroma indicate spices that 
are toasted not burnt.
Making Bread Crumbs
Almost any bread can be used to make crumbs; the choice depends on how the crumbs 
will be used. Fresh bread crumbs are made from fresh bread that is slightly dried out, 
approximately 2–4 days old. If the bread is too fresh, the crumbs will be gummy and 
stick together; if the bread is too stale, the crumbs will taste stale as well. Dry bread 
crumbs are made from bread that has been lightly toasted in a warm oven. Do not make 
crumbs from stale or molding bread, as these undesirable flavors are apparent when the 
crumbs are used.
To make crumbs, cube or tear the bread into pieces and grind in a food processor. 
Dried bread can be processed to a finer consistency than fresh bread. After processing, 
the crumbs should be passed through a drum sieve (tamis) and stored in a tightly closed 
plastic container in a cool, dry place. For additional flavors, dried herbs and spices may 
be mixed into the crumbs.

Convenience Products
convenience products have now replaced 
many of the chores that were typically 
part of a cook’s routine mise en place. For 
example, stock and sauce bases eliminate 
the time and labor necessary to make 
these products from scratch. Fresh onions 
and garlic can be purchased peeled, 
chopped and ready to use. Bread crumbs 
are available in bulk, and ready-to-use 
clarified butter is sold in refrigerated tubs. 
all this convenience comes at a price, of 
course. a chef must carefully consider 
whether the savings in employee time, 
along with the quality and consistency of 
available products, justify the higher cost 
of some of the convenience products now 
on the market.

➋ Pass the crumbs through a drum sieve or 
tamis so that they are uniform in size.
PREPARING SEASONING MIXTURES 
AND USING FLAVORING TECHNIQUES
Foods are often flavored with herbs or spices, marinades or rubs before they are cooked. 
The chef may prepare and apply various flavoring or seasoning mixtures and wait for a 
period of time between steps in a recipe.
M09_LABE1163_07_SE_C09.indd 189 28/10/23 2:02 PM190 cHaPTeR nine
Bouquets Garnis and Sachets
Bouquets garnis and sachets introduce flavorings, seasonings and aromatics into stocks, 
sauces, soups and stews.
A bouquet garni is a selection of herbs (usually fresh) and vegetables tied into a 
bundle with twine. A standard bouquet garni consists of parsley stems, celery, thyme, 
leeks and carrots.
A sachet (also known as a sachet d’épices) is seasonings tied together in cheesecloth. 
A standard sachet consists of peppercorns, bay leaves, parsley stems, thyme, cloves and, 
optionally, garlic. The exact quantity of these ingredients is determined by the amount of 
liquid the sachet is meant to flavor.
Bouquet garni sachet
Onion piqué
Bouquets garnis and sachets can be easily removed 
from a dish when their flavors have been extracted. 
A similar technique, although less commonly used, 
is an onion piqué (also known as an oignon 
piqué). To prepare an onion piqué, peel the onion 
and trim off the root end. Attach one or two dried 
bay leaves to the onion using whole cloves as 
pins. Simmer the onion piqué in milk or stock to 
extract flavors.
An onion brûlé (also known as oignon brûlé, 
French for “burnt onion”) is used to flavor and color stocks, 
sauces and soups such as consommé. To prepare an onion brûlé, peel the onion, trim off 
the root end and cut it in half. Place the onion halves cut sides down in a dry skillet over 
medium-high heat. Cook until the onion halves char and darken. Simmered in stocks or 
soups, the onion brûlé imparts a clear caramel color.
Marinades
Marinating is the process of soaking meat or poultry in a seasoned liquid to flavor and 
tenderize. Marinades can be a simple blend (herbs, seasonings and oil) or a complicated 
cooked recipe (red wine, fruit and other ingredients). Mild marinades should be used 
on more delicate meats, such as veal. Game and beef require strongly flavored mari￾nades. Salt, salty ingredients such as soy sauce and mildly acidic dairy products such 
as buttermilk or yogurt tenderize meat proteins. Highly acidic marinades, such as those 
containing lemon juice, vinegar or wine, also alter animal proteins and can toughen the 
surface of foods that marinate for too long. Certain fruits such as raw papayas and pine￾apples contain enzymes that also break down animal proteins. These fruits are effective 
Onion brûlé
M09_LABE1163_07_SE_C09.indd 190 28/10/23 2:02 PMMise en Place 191
tenderizers, but leaving foods in enzyme-based marinades for too long can make 
them unpleasantly soft and pulpy.
Poultry, veal and pork generally require less time to marinate than 
game, beef and lamb. Smaller pieces of meat take less time than 
larger pieces. More tender cuts of meat require less marinat￾ing time than tougher cuts of meat. When marinating, be 
sure to cover the meat or poultry completely and keep 
it refrigerated. The quantity of marinade needed varies 
depending on the size and form of the product; 2 pounds of 
boneless chicken breasts require less marinade to cover than 
2 pounds of whole Cornish game hens. Stir or turn foods fre￾quently so that the marinade can penetrate evenly.
Brines
Brines are salty marinades used on meats such as ham or bacon 
that will be smoked for long preservation; this process is discussed in 
Chapter 28, Charcuterie. Lean cuts of pork or poultry can also benefit from a light brin￾ing before grilling, roasting or sautéing. Soaking the cuts in a 3–5% brine solution for a 
few hours or overnight increases moisture retention and tenderizes the meat. Because 
the meat and pan drippings can become salty after brining, never salt brined meat before 
cooking. Avoid making pan gravy from brined meats. Most brine recipes include sweet￾eners and other seasonings to counterbalance the saltiness. The ratios of salt to water for 
light brine are as follows:
3% solution: 0.5 oz. (15 g) salt per 16 fl. oz. (480 ml) water
5% solution: 0.8 oz. (24 g) salt per 16 fl. oz. (480 ml) water
Rubs and Pastes
Additional flavors can be added to meat, fish and poultry by rubbing them with a mix￾ture of fresh or dried herbs and spices ground together with a mortar and pestle or in a 
spice grinder. The flavoring blend, called a rub, can be used dried, or it can be mixed 
with a little oil, lemon juice, prepared mustard or ground fresh garlic or ginger to make a 
paste (also known as a wet rub). Rubs and pastes add flavor and, often, a bit of crispy 
crust. They do not, however, generally act as a tenderizer unless they contain salt. They 
are most often used on foods that will be cooked with dry heat, especially by grilling, 
broiling, baking or roasting.
To apply a rub or paste, slather the mixture over the entire surface of the food to be 
flavored. Use enough pressure to make sure that the rub or paste adheres. (Pastes tend 
to adhere better than rubs.) It is best to wear disposable gloves when applying a rub or 
paste. Some spices can irritate or stain the skin, and cross-contamination can occur from 
handling raw meats. The thicker the covering or the longer it remains on the food before 
cooking, the more pronounced the flavor. If the rubbed food is to be left for some time 
so that the flavors can be absorbed, it should be covered, refrigerated and turned from 
time to time.
Steeping
Steeping is the process of soaking dry ingredients in a liquid (usually hot) to either 
soften a food or infuse its flavor into the liquid. The steeping mixture is generally cov￾ered and removed from the heat to avoid evaporation or reduction of the liquid.
Spices, coffee beans and nuts are often steeped in hot milk to extract their flavors. 
The milk is then used to flavor other foods during cooking. For example, coffee beans 
can be steeped in hot milk and then strained out with the coffee-flavored milk used to 
make a custard sauce or ice cream.

Steeping is also used to rehydrate dried fruits and vegetables, such as raisins and 
mushrooms. Typically the softened fruits or vegetables will be used in a recipe and the 
liquid discarded. Additional flavors can be achieved by using wine, spirits, stock or other 
flavored liquids as the rehydrating liquid.

BREADING, BATTERING, BLANCHING 
AND PARBOILING
Some mise en place techniques are completed very close to or almost as a part of the 
final preparation of a dish. However, the ingredients used in these techniques must still 
be prepared in advance as part of standard mise en place.
Breading
A breaded item is any food that is coated with bread crumbs, crushed crackers, cornmeal 
or other dry meal to protect it during cooking and add flavor and texture. Breaded foods 
can be seasoned before the breading is applied, or seasonings may be added to the flour, 
bread crumbs or meal before the food is coated. Breaded foods are generally cooked by 
deep-frying or pan-frying. The breading makes a solid coating that seals during cooking and 
prevents the fat from coming in direct contact with the food, which would make it greasy.
meal (1) the coarsely ground seeds of any 
edible grain such as corn or oats; (2) any dried, 
ground or powdery substance, such as cracker 
meal or almond meal
Standard Breading Procedure
For breading meats, poultry, fish, shellfish or vegetables, a three-step process is typically used. 
called the standard breading procedure, it gives foods a relatively thick, crisp coating.
1 Pat the food dry and dredge it in seasoned flour. The flour adds seasoning to the food, 
helps seal it and allows the egg wash to adhere.
2 Dip the floured food in an egg wash. The egg wash should contain whole eggs whisked 
together with approximately 1 tablespoon (15 milliliters) milk or water per egg. The egg 
wash allows the crumbs or meal to completely coat the item and form a tight seal.
3 coat the food with bread crumbs, cracker crumbs or other dry meal. shake off excess 
crumbs and place the breaded item in a pan. as additional breaded items are added to the 
pan, align them in a single layer; do not stack them or the breading will get soggy and the 
foods will stick together.
4 To ensure that breading adheres after cooking, refrigerate breaded foods for at least 
30 minutes before frying.
M09_LABE1163_07_SE_C09.indd 192 28/10/23 2:02 PMMise en Place 193
 Figure  9. 4 illustrates the proper mise en place setup for the standard breading procedure. 
The key to efficient breading is using one hand for the liquid ingredients and the other hand 
for the dry ingredients. This prevents your fingers from becoming coated with layer after 
layer of breading. The following process will help you to bread foods more efficiently: 
1 Assemble the mise en place as shown in Figure  9. 4 . 
2 With your left hand, place the food to be breaded in the flour and coat it evenly. 
With the same hand, remove the floured item, shake off the excess flour and 
place it in the egg wash. 
3 With your right hand, remove the item from the egg wash and place it in the 
bread crumbs or meal. 
4 With your left hand, cover the item with crumbs or meal and press lightly to 
make sure the item is completely and evenly coated. 
5 With your left hand, shake off the excess crumbs or meal and place the breaded 
food in the empty pan for finished product. 
 Battering 
 Batters, like breading, coat the food being cooked, giving it flavor and texture while keeping 
it moist and preventing it from becoming excessively greasy. Batters consist of a liquid, such 
as water, milk or beer, combined with a starch, such as flour or cornstarch. Many batters 
also contain baking powder or whipped egg whites to give them a light texture after frying. 
Two common batters are beer batter, which uses beer for leavening as well as for flavor and 
is illustrated in the recipe for Beer Battered Onion Rings (page 657) , and tempura batter , 
which is used in Tempura Vegetables with Dipping Sauce (page 678) . Items coated with a 
batter are cooked immediately, usually by deep-frying or pan-frying. Figure  9. 5 shows the 
proper mise en place setup for the standard battering procedure. 
 Safety Alert 
 Batters and Breading 
 Batters and breading are time and 
temperature control for safety (Tcs) 
foods when eggs or milk are used in their 
preparation. Make small batches of 
batter, then discard after each use. 
store fresh batter at or below 41°F (5°c). 
Discard crumbs, flour and eggs after 
each use. To prevent cross-contamination 
when coating different foods, such as 
vegetables and poultry, use separate 
batter or breading for each product. 
Figure 9. 5 setup for the standard battering procedure. 
 Procedure for Battering Foods 
1 Prepare the batter. 
2 Pat the food dry and dredge in flour if desired. (chopped fruits, vegetables or other 
chopped ingredients being battered do not need to be dredged.) 
3 Dip the item in the batter. 
4 Place the battered item directly in the hot fat. 
 Blanching and Parboiling 
 Some foods, especially vegetables, are blanched or parboiled before being used in a recipe. 
Items to be blanched or parboiled are immersed in a large quantity of a boiling or simmer￾ing liquid—oil or water—and partially cooked. This parcooking assists preparation (e.g., it

food in boiling water or hot fat; used to assist

loosens peels from vegetables), removes undesirable flavors, softens firm foods, sets colors 
and shortens final cooking times. The only difference between blanching and parboiling is 
cooking time. Blanching is done quickly, usually only a few seconds. Parboiling lasts lon￾ger, usually several minutes. Foods that are blanched or parboiled in water (rather than fat) 
are often shocked or refreshed in ice water to halt the cooking process.

 Procedure for Blanching and Parboiling 
 Making an Ice Bath 
 Because of the risk of food-borne illness (see Chapter  2 , Food Safety and Sanitation) , it 
is important to cool hot foods quickly to a temperature below 41°F (5°C) before storing 
them in the refrigerator. An ice bath is an easy, efficient way to do so. An ice bath is also 
necessary for shocking or refreshing blanched or parcooked vegetables and for stopping 
the cooking of delicate mixtures such as custards. 
 An ice bath is equal parts ice cubes and cold water. The combination of ice and water 
chills foods more rapidly than a container of only ice. Adding a generous amount of 
salt to the ice bath will lower its temperature further as salt lowers the freezing point of 
water. The food being chilled will also cool faster if it is in a metal container, rather than 
one made of plastic or glass. The container of items to be chilled should be submerged 
into the ice bath so that the level of ingredients is at or below the level of liquid in the 
ice bath. Constant stirring speeds the cooling process.

 Cooking is the transfer of energy from a heat source to a food. The energy alters the 
food’s molecular structure, changing its texture, flavor, aroma and appearance. 
But why is food cooked at all? The obvious answer is that cooking makes food 
taste better. Cooking also destroys undesirable microorganisms and makes foods easier to 
ingest and digest. 
 Understanding the ways in which heat is transferred—conduction, convection and 
radiation—helps you to cook food successfully. it is also helpful to understand what heat 
does to the proteins, starches, sugars, water and fats in foods. 
 To be a chef, you must master the cooking methods used to transfer heat: broiling, grilling, 
roasting, baking, barbecuing, smoking, sautéing, stir-frying, pan-frying, deep-frying, poach￾ing, simmering, boiling, steaming, braising, stewing and cooking sous vide . Each method is 
used for many types of food, so you apply one or more of them every time you cook. The 
cooking method you select gives the finished product a specific texture, appearance, aroma 
and flavor. A thorough understanding of the basic procedures of each cooking method helps 
you produce consistent, high-quality products. 
 HEAT TRANSFER THROUGH CONDUCTION, 
CONVECTION AND RADIATION 
 Heat is a type of energy. When a substance gets hot, its molecules absorb energy. This 
causes the molecules to vibrate rapidly, expand and bounce off one another. As the mol￾ecules move, they collide with nearby molecules, transferring heat energy. The faster the 
molecules within a substance move, the higher its temperature. This is true whether the 
substance is air, water, an aluminum pot or a sirloin steak. 
 Heat energy may be transferred to foods via conduction, convection or radiation 
as shown in Figure 10. 1 . Heat then travels through foods by conduction. Only heat is 
transferred—cold is simply the absence of heat, so cold cannot be transferred from one 
substance to another. 
 Conduction 
Conduction is the most straightforward means of heat transfer. It is the movement of 
heat from one item to another through direct contact. For example, when the flame of a 
gas burner touches the bottom of a sauté pan, heat is conducted to the pan. The metal 
of the pan then conducts heat to the surface of the food in the pan. 
 Some materials conduct heat better than others. Water is a better conductor of heat 
than air. This explains why a potato cooks much faster in boiling water than in an oven, 
and why you cannot place your hand in boiling water at a temperature of 212°F (100°C), 
but can place your hand, at least very briefly, into a 400°F (200°C) oven. Generally met￾als are good conductors ( as discussed in Chapter 5 , Tools and Equipment, copper and 
aluminum are the best conductors), and liquids and gases are poor conductors. 
 Conduction is a relatively slow method of heat transfer because physical contact must 
occur to transfer energy from one molecule to adjacent molecules. Consider what hap￾pens when a metal spoon is placed in a pot of simmering soup. At first the spoon handle 
remains cool. Gradually, however, heat travels up the handle, making it warmer and 
warmer, until it becomes too hot to touch. 
 Conduction is important in all cooking methods because it is responsible for the 
movement of heat from the surface of a food to its interior. As the molecules near the 
food’s exterior gather energy, they move more and more rapidly. As they move, they 
conduct heat to the molecules nearby, transferring heat through the food (from the exte￾rior of the item to the interior). 
 conduction the transfer of heat (energy) from 
one item to another through direct contact 
M10_LABE1163_07_SE_C10.indd 196 31/10/23 7:41 PMPRiNCiPlES oF CookiNg 197
 In conventional (nonmicrowave) heating methods, food cooks from the surface 
inward so that layers of molecules heat in succession. This produces a range of tempera￾tures within the food, which means that the outside may brown and form a crust long 
before the interior is noticeably warmer. That is why a steak can be fully cooked on the 
outside but still rare on the inside. 
 Convection 
Convection refers to the transfer of heat through a fluid, which may be a liquid or gas. 
Convection is actually a combination of conduction and circulation of energy. During 
convection, the molecules in a fluid (whether air, water or fat) move from a warmer area 
to a cooler one. There are two types of convection: natural and mechanical. 
Natural convection occurs because of the tendency of warm liquids and gases to 
rise while cooler ones fall. This tendency causes a constant natural circulation of heat. 
For example, when a pot of stock is placed over a gas burner, the molecules at the bot￾tom of the pot are warmed. These molecules rise while cooler, heavier molecules sink. 
Upon reaching the pot’s bottom, the cooler molecules are warmed and begin to rise in 
turn. Meanwhile the molecules that rose to the top are cool enough to sink again. This 
ongoing cycle creates currents within the stock, and these currents distribute the heat 
throughout the stock. 
Mechanical convection relies on fans or stirring to circulate heat more quickly and 
evenly. This explains why foods heat faster and more evenly when stirred. Convection 
ovens are equipped with fans to increase the circulation of air currents, thus speeding up 
the cooking process. But even conventional ovens (i.e., not convection ovens) rely on 
the natural circulation patterns of heated air to transfer heat energy. 
 Radiation 
 Unlike conduction and convection, radiation does not require physical contact 
between the heat source and the food being cooked. Instead energy is transferred by 
 convection the transfer of heat (energy) 
through a fluid (such as water or air) by natural 
or mechanical circulation 
 radiation the transfer of heat (energy) by 
electromagnetic waves of energy or light 
spreading out from a central source, such as 
a ceramic toaster element or a magnetron in a 
microwave oven

(clockwise from top left): conduction to the pan from a heated gas burner;

liquid; radiation from microwaves; radiation from a heated broiler. 
M10_LABE1163_07_SE_C10.indd 197 31/10/23 7:41 PM198 CHAPTER TEN
electromagnetic waves of energy or light striking the food. Two kinds of radiant heat are 
used in the kitchen: infrared and microwave.
Infrared cooking uses an electric or ceramic element heated to such a high tem￾perature that it gives off waves of radiant heat that cook the food. Radiant heat waves 
travel at the speed of light in any direction (unlike convection heat, which only rises) 
until they are absorbed by a food. Infrared cooking is commonly used with toasters and 
broilers. The glowing coals of a fire are another example of radiant heat.
Microwave cooking relies on radiation that is generated by a special oven. The 
radiation penetrates the food, where it agitates the water molecules contained within 
the food, creating friction and heat. This energy then spreads throughout the food by 
conduction (and by convection in liquids). Microwave cooking is much faster than other 
methods because energy penetrates the food up to a depth of several millimeters, set￾ting all water molecules in the food in motion at the same time. Less energy is wasted in 
microwave cooking because the oven space itself is not heated. Instead heat is generated 
quickly and uniformly throughout the food. Microwave cooking does not brown foods 
and often gives meats a dry, mushy texture, making microwave ovens unacceptable as a 
sole replacement for traditional ovens. Microwave ovens are useful, however, for melting 
fats or chocolate and for quickly reheating foods.
Because microwave radiation affects only water molecules, a completely waterless 
material (such as a plate) does not get hot in a microwave. Any warmth felt in a plate 
used for microwaving food results from heat being conducted from the food to the plate.
Microwave cooking requires the use of certain types of utensils, usually heat-resistant 
glass or microwavable paper or plastic. But even heat-resistant glass can shatter in a 
microwave and is not recommended for professional use. Most of the aluminum and 
stainless steel utensils common in professional kitchens cannot be used in microwave 
ovens because metal deflects the microwave radiation, which can damage the oven.
HOW HEAT AFFECTS FOOD
Foods are composed of proteins, carbohydrates (starches and sugars), water and fats, 
plus small amounts of minerals and vitamins. Changes in the shape, texture, color and 
flavor of foods occurs when heat is applied to each of these nutrients. (See Table 10.1.) 
The rate at which a substance changes when cooled or heated varies according to its 
composition. By understanding these changes and learning to control them, you will be 
able to prepare foods with the characteristics desired.
Proteins Coagulate
The heating of protein during cooking changes its structure, causing it to coagulate
(change from a semiliquid state to a solid state). Proteins are large, complex molecules 
found in every living cell, plant as well as animal. They are formed from amino acids 
coagulation the irreversible transformation of 
proteins from a liquid or semiliquid state to a 
solid state

that are chemically bonded into long, loosely folded chains. In the presence of heat, the 
protein chains unfold (or denature). As they are heated, the protein chains then rebond 
and solidify into a solid mass. In other words, as proteins cook, they lose moisture, 
shrink and become firm. (See Figure 10.2.) Common examples of protein coagulation 
are the firming of meat fibers during cooking, egg whites changing from a clear liquid 
to a white solid when heated and the setting of the structure of wheat proteins in bread 
during baking. The process of coagulation begins as proteins are heated to 140°F (60°C). 
Most proteins complete coagulation at 160–185°F (71–85°C). When heated for too long, 
or above 185°F (85°C), most proteins dry out and toughen. Proteins also denature in the 
presence of an acid or salt. When an acid such as citrus juice, vinegar or wine is added 
to proteins, as in a marinade or cooking liquid, it helps to tenderize them.
Starches Gelatinize
Gelatinization is the term for the cooking of starches. Starches are complex carbohydrates 
present in plants and grains such as potatoes, wheat, rice and corn. When a mixture of 
starch and liquid is heated, remarkable changes occur. The starch granules absorb water, 
causing them to swell, soften and clarify (become slightly clear). The liquid visibly thickens 
because of the water being absorbed into the starch granules and the granules themselves 
swell and occupy more space.
Gelatinization occurs gradually over a range of temperatures—150–212°F (66–100°C)—
depending on the type of starch. Starch gelatinization affects not only sauces or liquids 
to which starches are added for the express purpose of thickening, but also any mix￾ture of starch and liquid that is heated. For example, the flour (a starch) in cake batter 
gelatinizes by absorbing the water from eggs, milk or other ingredients as the batter 
bakes. This causes part of the firming and drying associated with baked goods. (See 
Figure 10.3.) Gelatinization of starch also takes place when beans or pasta absorb water, 
swell and soften during cooking.

granules are cooked; they absorb moisture

Sugars Caramelize
The process of cooking sugars is caramelization. As sugars cook, they gradually darken 
from golden to deep brown and change flavor. Caramelized sugar is used in many 
sauces, candies and desserts. But caramelized sugars are also partly responsible for the 
flavor and color of bread crusts and the browning of meats and vegetables. In fact, the 
process of caramelization is responsible for most flavors we associate with cooking. 
The Maillard reaction, named for the French scientist who discovered this principle, 
describes the process of sugar breaking down in the presence of protein. Maillard 
browning occurs when proteins and carbohydrates are heated to 250°F (121°C) and 
above. The product darkens and develops complex, meaty and baked flavors. (Higher 
alkaline foods and certain foods such as eggs, when cooked for a long period of time, 
will brown at lower temperatures.) Some of the aromas and flavors of roasted nuts, 
chocolate and coffee derive from Maillard browning. When we talk about browning, we 
are referring to this process of caramelization.
Sucrose (common table sugar) begins to decompose and brown starting at 290°F (143°C) 
or at higher temperatures when heated more quickly. The naturally occurring sugars in 
other foods, such as maltose, lactose and fructose, also caramelize, but at varying tempera￾tures. Because high temperatures are required for browning (i.e., caramelizing), most foods 
brown only on the outside and only through the application of dry heat. Foods cooked 
with dry-heat methods, including those using fats, reach the high temperatures at which 
browning occurs. Because water cannot be heated above 212°F (100°C), foods cooked with 
moist-heat methods do not get hot enough to caramelize.
Water Evaporates
All foods contain some water. Some foods, especially eggs, milk and leafy vegetables, 
are almost entirely water. As much as 75 percent of raw meat is water. As the internal 
temperature of a food increases, water molecules move faster and faster until the water 
turns into a gas (steam) and vaporizes. This evaporation of water is responsible for the 
drying of foods during cooking.
Fats Melt
Fat is an energy source for the plant or animal in which it is stored. Fats are smooth, 
greasy substances that do not dissolve in water. Their texture varies from very firm to 
liquid. Oils are simply fats that remain liquid at room temperature. Fats melt when 
heated; that is, they gradually soften, then liquefy. Butter begins to melt at temperatures 
as low as 70°F (21°C). Fats will not evaporate. Most fats can be heated to very high tem￾peratures without burning, so they can be used as a dry-heat cooking medium to fry or 
brown (caramelize) foods.
DETERMINING DONENESS
When heated, foods undergo a complex set of chemical and physical reactions that 
result in improved flavor, aroma, texture and digestibility. Knowing when a food is 
cooked appropriately and ready to serve is determined by many factors. Observing the 
physical changes that take place during cooking will help you determine when a food 
is done. For example, you may use your sense of touch to feel that a baked potato has 
softened or use a fork to test the tenderness of a piece of stewed meat. Doneness may be 
determined by specific visual clues such as clear juices running from poultry. Fish firms, 
becoming opaque, and flakes. The surface of a loaf of bread develops a crisp crust and 
turns an appealing brown color from caramelization. With experience, you will learn to 
control the application of heat and the length of time it takes to cook foods.
The internal temperature of food is another way to gauge doneness. Some foods, 
particularly animal proteins cooked using dry-heat cooking methods, must be cooked 
to specific internal temperatures to ensure food safety. (See Chapter 2, Food Safety 
and Sanitation.) Chicken, for example should be cooked to 165°F (74°C) to destroy 
caramelization the process of cooking sugars; 
the browning of sugar enhances the flavor and 
appearance of foods
Maillard reaction the process whereby sugar 
breaks down in the presence of protein
Enzymatic Browning
A different type of browning occurs when 
some fruits and vegetables are cut or 
bruised. A molecular reaction between 
enzymes and natural acids (antioxidants) 
takes place, releasing a dark pigment 
called melanin. known as enzymatic 
browning, this molecular reaction is 
undesirable in a sliced apple or potato, 
but it is desirable for creating the flavor 
in black tea. To prevent it from occurring, 
many sliced fruits or vegetables are tossed 
with lemon juice or soaked in acidulated 
water after cutting.
M10_LABE1163_07_SE_C10.indd 200 31/10/23 7:41 PMPRiNCiPlES oF CookiNg 201
pathogenic bacteria. Internal temperature also correlates to desirable flavor characteris￾tics in meats such as grilled steak or lamb. The difference between a medium rare lamb 
chop and a well done one is only 25°F (14°C), but that difference has a huge impact on 
the texture and flavor of the finished dish.
The speed of heat transfer affects the time it takes for food to reach the desired degree 
of doneness. Carrots cooked in boiling water will be tender in a few minutes. They may 
take two or three times longer to become tender when roasted in an oven, however, 
because water conducts heat more efficiently than air. Boiled carrots do not have the 
same dry, crisp exterior as roasted carrots, which is a factor to consider when choosing 
cooking methods.
The equipment used to prepare food, from the size and metal of a saucepan to the 
type of oven, also affects cooking time. As described in Chapter 5, Tools and Equipment, 
a copper pan heats more quickly than an aluminum one. Variables in cookware from 
different manufacturers also affect cooking efficiency and heat transfer. The size and 
temperature of the food itself affect the speed with which it cooks. A 3-pound chicken 
cooks more quickly than a 5-pound chicken. Food at room temperature cooks more 
quickly than chilled items.
Foods continue to cook after they are removed from a heat source. This carryover 
cooking is accomplished by the residual heat remaining in the food. When applying any 
cooking method, cook the foods to the appropriate temperature but keep in mind that 
the internal temperature of the food may rise 5–25 degrees after cooking, depending on 
the size of the item and the temperature used. Because food absorbs more heat when 
cooked at a higher temperature, carryover cooking is greater in an item cooked at 450°F 
(232°C) than one cooked at 325°F (163°C).
Timing alone is insufficient for determine doneness. In the sections that follow and 
in subsequent chapters, we include doneness characteristics to help you determine by 
sight, smell and touch when a food is correctly cooked.
INTRODUCTION TO THE BASIC COOKING METHODS
Foods can be cooked in air, fat, water or steam, which are collectively known as cook￾ing media. There are two general types of cooking methods: dry heat and moist heat. 
(See Table 10.2.)
Dry-heat cooking methods use air or fat. They are broiling, grilling, roasting, bak￾ing, barbecuing, smoking, sautéing, stir-frying, pan-frying and deep-frying. Foods cooked 
using dry-heat cooking methods have a rich flavor caused by the browning that occurs 
when moisture on the surface of the food evaporates and sugars caramelize.
Moist-heat cooking methods use water or steam. They are poaching, simmering, 
boiling and steaming. Moist-heat cooking methods tenderize and emphasize the natural 
flavors of food.
Other cooking methods employ a combination of dry- and moist-heat cooking methods. 
The two most significant combination cooking methods are braising and stewing. A third 
combination cooking method, called sous vide, resembles both braising and poaching.
Each cooking method can be applied to a wide variety of foods—meats, fish, fruits, 
vegetables and even pastries. In the following material, we describe and show each of 
the cooking methods. Detailed procedures and recipes applying these methods to spe￾cific foods are found in later chapters.
DRY-HEAT COOKING METHODS
Cooking by dry heat involves applying heat either directly, by subjecting the food to the 
heat of a flame, or indirectly, by surrounding the food with heated air or heated fat. Even 
though fat is used in some of these techniques, they are dry-heat cooking techniques 
because liquid fat does not contain water. Fat can be used to cook at higher tempera￾tures than water-based liquids, resulting in differences in the final product’s taste, color 
and texture.
carryover cooking the cooking that continues 
to occur after a food is removed from a 
heat source; it is caused by the residual heat 
remaining in the food
sous vide a cooking technique that uses low 
temperature, moist-heat cooking methods 
similar to braising or poaching; the food item

 Broiling
Broiling uses infrared radiant heat from an overhead source such as an overhead broiler 
or salamander to cook foods. The temperature at the heat source can be as high as 2000°F 
(1093°C). The food to be broiled is placed on a preheated metal grate. Radiant heat from 
overhead cooks the food, while the hot grate below creates attractive crosshatch marks. 
Broiled shrimp, for example, displays the crosshatch marks from the broiler on the pre￾sentation side, the surface that faces up when the plate is served to the guest.
Delicate foods that may be damaged by being placed directly on a metal grate or foods 
on which crosshatch marks are not desirable may be placed on a preheated heatproof plat￾ter and then placed under the broiler. For example, fillets of tender fish such as flounder, 
which could fall apart during cooking, are broiled on a heatproof platter. Only relatively 
firm and dry fruits and vegetables are suitable for broiling. Cooking takes place through 
indirect heat from the preheated platter as well as by direct heat from the broiler’s over￾head heat source. Broiling is considered a healthy cooking method when used to prepare 
leans cuts of meat, poultry or fish, fruits and vegetables as long as little or no fat is added.
Procedure for Broiling Foods
1 Heat the overhead broiler or salamander to its highest setting.
2 if necessary, use a wire brush to remove any charred or burnt particles stuck to the broiler 
grate. The grate can be wiped with a lightly oiled towel to remove any remaining particles 
and to help season it.
3 Cut, trim or otherwise prepare the food to be broiled. (Foods should be cut to an even 
thickness. Thicker pieces of food take longer to cook.) Marinate, rub or season food, as 
desired. Many foods can be brushed lightly with oil to keep them from sticking to the grate.
4 Pull out the broiler grate and place the food on it, presentation side down. Slide the grate 
back under the broiler. if necessary, use a chef ’s fork or tongs to turn or flip the item 
without piercing its surface.
5 Cook the food to the desired degree of doneness while developing the proper surface 
color. To do so, adjust the position of the item on the broiler grate, or adjust the distance 
between the grate and heat source. if practical, rotate the food 90 degrees to produce 
attractive crosshatch marks. Doneness is often determined by touch, internal temperature 
or specific visual cues (e.g., clear juices running from poultry).

Equipment: overhead broiler or salamander
Method: Uses high temperatures and radiant heat 
from overhead source. Place food on a pre-heated 
grate or heatproof platter.
Use: Quick browning, melting and cooking.
➊ Preheat and clean the broiler grate. Place 
the food on the hot grate presentation side 
down. Slide the grate back under the broiler 
and cook until the food develops the proper 
color where it touches the grate.
➋ Pull the grate out to turn the food over as 
necessary in order to cook it evenly. Note the 
handle visible on the right, which can be used 
to adjust the distance between the food and 
the heat source. Smaller pieces of food can 
often be cooked closer to the source of heat.
➌ Remove the cooked item from the 
broiler grate.

 Grilling
Although similar to broiling, grilling uses a heat source located below the cooking 
surface. Heat is transferred to the food through infrared radiant heat and conduction 
between the food and the grill rack itself. Grills may be electric or gas, or they can burn 
wood or charcoal. (Solid metal pans with ridged surfaces may also be used to pan-grill 
foods.) Grilled foods are characterized by their crusty exterior and aromatic flavors, 
and are often identified by crosshatch markings on the presentation side. With a gas or 
electric grill, the cooking temperature is controlled by adjusting a dial. The flame and 
heat decrease or increase almost immediately when the dial is turned. With a charcoal or 
wood-burning grill, you must control the fire itself to change the cooking temperature. 
There is a delay in the time it takes for the fire to die down (or build up) when cooking 
over a live fire. Grilling is considered a healthy cooking method when used to prepare 
leans cuts of meat, poultry or fish and vegetables if little or no fat is added. Griddling is 
a dry heat cooking method closely related to grilling in which foods are cooked on the 
heated surface of a flat solid metal griddle (Sp. plancha). Techniques and procedures for 
griddling are discussed further in Chapter 21, Eggs and Breakfast.
BASIC PROCEDURE
Equipment: Electric, gas, charcoal or 
wood-burning grill
Method: Uses radiant heat generated below the food
Use: Achieving crusty exterior, grill marks and 
aromatic flavors.
➊ Decide which side of the grilled food will 
be presented face up to the customer. Place the 
food on the hot grill with this side facing down. 
if the item is oblong, place it at a 45-degree 
angle to the bars on the cooking grate. Cook 
long enough for the food to develop dark 
charred lines where it touches the grate.
➋ Rotate the food 90 degrees and allow it to 
cook long enough for the grates to char it to 
the same extent as in Step 1.
Procedure for Grilling Foods
1 Heat the grill.
2 if necessary, use a wire brush to remove any charred or burnt particles stuck to the grill 
grate. The grate can be wiped with a lightly oiled towel to remove any remaining particles 
and to help season it.
3 Cut, trim or otherwise prepare the food to be grilled. Marinate, rub or season it, as desired. 
Many foods can be brushed lightly with oil to keep them from sticking to the grate.
4 Place the food on the grill, presentation side down. if practical, rotate the food 90 degrees 
to produce the attractive crosshatch marks associated with grilling. Then use a fork or 
tongs to turn or flip the item without piercing its surface.
5 Cook the food to the desired degree of doneness while developing the proper surface color. 
To do so, adjust the position of the item on the grill, or adjust the distance between the 
grate and heat source. Doneness is often determined by touch, internal temperature or 
specific visual cues (e.g., clear juices running from poultry).
➌ Turn the food over and finish cooking it. it 
is usually unnecessary to create the crosshatch 
markings on the reverse side because the 
customer will not see this side.

Roasting and Baking
During roasting and baking, a food is surrounded with dry, heated air in a closed 
environment such as an oven. The term roasting is usually applied to meats, poultry 
and vegetables whereas baking applies to fish, fruits, starches, breads and pastry items. 
Heat is transferred by convection to the food’s surface and then penetrates the food by 
conduction. The surface dehydrates and the food browns from caramelization, complet￾ing the cooking process.
During roasting, foods may be basted or moistened with melted fat, pan drippings, 
wine or other liquids to improve the surface appearance and texture. Lean meats, such as 
chickens and turkeys, which may dry out, are usually basted while they roast. Drippings 
that collect in the pan during roasting are the basis for gravy and sauces that are served 
with the food and are discussed in Chapter 11, Stocks and Sauces. Roasting and baking 
are considered healthy cooking methods when used to prepare lean cuts of meat, poul￾try or fish and vegetables if little or no fat is added.
Procedure for Roasting or Baking Foods
1 Preheat the oven.
2 Cut, trim or otherwise prepare the food to be roasted or baked. Marinate or season as 
desired. Brush with oil or butter, as appropriate.
3 Place the food on a rack or directly in a roasting pan or baking dish.
4 Roast the food, generally uncovered, at the desired temperature. Baste as necessary.
5 Cook to the desired internal temperature or doneness, remembering that many foods will 
undergo carryover cooking after they are removed from the oven.
6 Allow the food to rest for anywhere from 10 to 30 minutes before carving or serving to 
allow the internal juices to redistribute themselves.
BASIC PROCEDURE
Equipment: oven
Method: Food is placed in a closed chamber filled 
with hot dry air.
Use: Cooking and caramelizing meats, poultry, veg￾etables, bread, fish, starches and pastry items.

grilling, broiling or roasting) with melted fat, 
pan drippings, a sauce or other liquids to 
prevent drying and to add flavor
➊ Season the item to be roasted, arrange it 
in an uncovered roasting pan and place it in a 
preheated oven.
➋ Use a thermometer to check the internal 
temperature of the item being roasted.
M10_LABE1163_07_SE_C10.indd 205 31/10/23 7:42 PM206 CHAPTER TEN
Barbecue
Barbecue is a dry-heat cooking method related to baking or roasting. In traditional 
barbecue, large, usually tough, cuts of meat are cooked by natural convection in a 
 semi-enclosed oven (called a pit) with the smoke from a hardwood fire kept at low 
temperatures, generally below 225°F (107°C). True barbecue is a slow process, requir￾ing many hours of low temperature heat and smoke to tenderize tough cuts or whole 
carcasses. Doneness is not determined by internal temperature but by tenderness and 
feel. The meat should be fall-off-the-bone tender. In the case of pork, the meat is torn or 
shredded rather than sliced when served.
Although many grilled foods are referred to as “barbecue,” real barbecue is never 
produced over gas or electric grills. Hardwood charcoal and embers are required for 
the long, slow burn necessary. Because authentic barbecue relies on fatty cuts of meat 
and poultry, it is not usually considered a healthy cooking method. Techniques and 
procedures for barbecue cooking are discussed further in Chapter 13, Principles of 
Meat Cookery.
Smoking
Smoking is a dry-heat cooking method used to cook, color and flavor foods for imme￾diate service or to preserve foods for later use. When smoking, heat is transferred by 
convection to the food’s surface and then penetrates the food by conduction. Smoking 
involves burning wood or wood chips to create smoke vapors, which contain com￾pounds that help preserve and flavor foods. Smokey flavors can also be added to 
uncooked items such as cheese and nuts by exposing them to smoke without heat. 
Techniques and procedures for hot and cold smoking are discussed further in Chapter 
28, Charcuterie.
Sautéing
Sautéing is a dry-heat cooking method that uses conduction to transfer heat from a hot 
sauté pan to food. Heat then penetrates the food through conduction. High temperatures 
are used to sauté, and the foods are usually cut thinly or into small pieces to promote 
even cooking.
To sauté foods properly, begin by heating a sauté pan on the stove top, then add 
a small amount of fat. The fat should just cover the bottom of the pan. Heat the fat 
to the point just before it begins to smoke. The food to be cooked should be as dry 
as possible when it is added to the pan to promote browning and to prevent exces￾sive spattering. Remove excess surface moisture from food using clean paper towels. 
Moist foods such as fillets of fish or pieces of chicken are dredged in flour before 
BASIC PROCEDURE
Equipment: oven, covered grill or pit
Method: Food is placed in a closed or semi-enclosed 
chamber (pit) and cooked over a hardwood fire at

Cooking with Fire
grilling over a charcoal or wood fire requires 
experience building and tending a live fire and 
its embers. The radiant heat given off by glowing 
embers cooks the food, not the flames. Food 
burns quickly when in contact with flames. 
oxygen in the air ignites, causing the fire to burn. 
To lower the cooking temperature, decrease 
the amount of available oxygen. Controlling 
the flow of air to the heat source controls the 
fire. To burn fast and hot, increase the air flow 
under the charcoal or wood. Dampening or 
reducing the air flow reduces the flame, creating 
the kind of steady heat used to prepare properly 
grilled items. Chefs often set a grill or build a 
fire so that different sections will be at different 
temperatures. They can then move foods from a 
hotter to a cooler section as needed to control 
the cooking temperature. on some equipment, 
temperature is adjusted by opening or closing a 
vent near the base of the fire. You can also use 
tongs to reposition burning coals or wood to 
improve air circulation.
When cooking over a gas, electric or charcoal 
grill, juice and fat from the meat drips onto 
the heat source, burning and sending flavor 
compounds into the smoke that surrounds the 
food. When wood is used, aroma molecules 
in the wood also contribute unique flavors to 
the smoke. Specific woods such as mesquite, 
hickory or vine clippings create special flavors. 
You can add wood flavor notes to grilled foods 
by tossing wood chips into a charcoal fire. 
Some electric and gas grills allow wood or wood 
chips to be added for flavor. Electric smoker 
boxes can also be used to burn wood chips in 
order to add smoke to a conventional oven.
M10_LABE1163_07_SE_C10.indd 206 31/10/23 7:42 PMPRiNCiPlES oF CookiNg 207
sautéing. Place the food in the pan in a single layer. (The pan should be just large 
enough to hold the food in a single layer; a pan that is too large may cause the fat 
to burn.) Adjust the heat so that the food cooks thoroughly; it should not be so hot 
that the outside of the food burns before the inside is cooked. The pan should be hot 
enough so that any surface moisture on the food evaporates quickly. The food should 
be turned or tossed periodically to develop the proper color. Larger items should be 
turned using a chef’s fork or tongs that won’t pierce the surface. Smaller items can be 
turned by shaking the sauté pan and using the pan’s sloped sides to flip items back on 
top of themselves. When tossing sautéed foods, keep the pan in contact with the heat 
source as much as possible to prevent it from cooling. Sautéing sometimes includes 
the preparation of a sauce directly in the pan after the main item has been removed. 
(See Chapter 11, Stocks and Sauces.)
When a small amount of fat is used as the cooking medium, sautéing can be a 
healthy way to prepare lean cuts of meat, poultry and fish and vegetables. Using 
nonstick or well-seasoned cast iron cookware to sauté foods reduces the need for 
added fat.
Sweating is related to sautéing. It is used to cook food in a pan (usually covered), 
without browning, over low heat until the item softens and releases moisture. Sweating 
allows the food to release its flavor more quickly when cooked with other foods. Diced 
vegetables such as carrots, celery, mushrooms or onions are often sweated before they 
are browned or added to soups and stews for further cooking.
Procedure for Sautéing Foods
1 Cut, pound or otherwise prepare the food to be sautéed. Season it and dredge it in flour, 
if desired.
2 Heat a sauté pan and add enough fat (typically oil or clarified butter) to just cover the 
pan’s bottom.
3 Add the food to the sauté pan in a single layer, presentation side down. Do not crowd 
the pan.
4 Adjust the temperature so that the food’s exterior browns properly without burning and the 
interior cooks. The heat should be high enough to complete the cooking process before the 
food begins to stew in its own juices.
5 Turn or toss the food as needed. Avoid burns by not splashing hot fat.
6 Cook until done. Doneness is usually determined by timing or touch.
 Safety Alert
Flambéing: Cooking with Alcohol
Some dishes, often those that are prepared 
by sautéing, require flaming or flambéing, 
which means igniting brandy, rum or other 
liquor so that the alcohol burns off and 
the flavor of the liquor is retained. When 
alcohol comes into contact with a flame, 
it can ignite. To avoid singed eyebrows and 
kitchen fires, be careful when adding wine, 
brandy, liqueurs or liquor to a dish on or 
near the stove.
When a dish calls for flambéing, stand 
away from the pan being flamed. Never 
pour alcohol directly from a bottle into a 
hot pan because the flames can travel up 
into the bottle, causing it to explode. Heat 
the liquor until warm before flambéing. 
This can be done in the pan in which the 
food is cooking, such as for Pepper Steaks 
(page 370). Tilt the pan away from you 
before igniting the liquor to avoid having 
the flames leap from the pan. The flame 
from a gas burner or match will ignite the 
alcohol. Allow the flame to subside before 
finishing the preparation.
➊ Heat a sauté pan and then heat a small 
amount of fat in the sauté pan before adding 
the food.
➋ The sloped edge of the sauté pan can be 
used to toss the food.
➌ items being sautéed should be 
cooked quickly.
M10_LABE1163_07_SE_C10.indd 207 31/10/23 7:42 PM208 CHAPTER TEN
Stir-Frying
Stir-frying is an ancient Chinese cooking technique that resembles sautéing. A wok is 
used instead of a sauté pan; the curved sides and rounded bottom of the wok diffuse 
heat efficiently and facilitate the near-constant tossing and stirring required for this cook￾ing method. When stir-frying, the heat is kept at a constant high temperature. The wok 
must be heated until it appears to smoke. When the wok is properly heated, a few drops 
of water will evaporate immediately when added to the pan. The fats used for stir-frying 
must have a high smoke point, such as peanut oil. The combination high temperature 
and hot oil in a well-seasoned wok creates the desirable aroma known a wok hei. This 
Cantonese expression, frequently translated as “breath of the wok,” refers to the smoky 
flavor and aroma produced by droplets of fat that spark in mid-air as the food is tossed 
about in wok stir-frying.
The foods for stir-frying are usually cut thinly or into small pieces to promote quick, 
even cooking. When different foods are cooked together, such as shredded carrots, cab￾bage and snow peas, those that require the longest cooking time are added first. The 
ingredients should not be too wet when added to the pan. As when sautéing, a sauce is 
often made in the pan when stir-frying foods. Use a flat metal spatula to move the food 
up the sides of the pan before adding the sauce ingredients then stir and toss the foods 
into the sauce. Because of the high temperatures and rapid cooking of stir frying, it is 
important to have all ingredients measured and fully prepared before cooking begins.
When a small amount of fat is used to stir-fry lean meats, poultry and fish or veg￾etables, stir-frying is considered a healthy cooking technique.
BASIC PROCEDURE
Equipment: Wok on stove top
Method: Small pieces of food are browned and 
cooked in a moderate amount of fat while tossing 
over high heat.
Use: Quickly browning and cooking tender cuts of 
meat, fish and vegetables.
Procedure for Stir-Frying Foods
1 Cut the food to be stir-fried into pieces as called for in the recipe.
2 Heat a wok over high heat until it is so hot that a few drops of water will evaporate within a 
few seconds when added to the pan.
3 Add enough fat (typically oil) to just cover the pan’s bottom. Carefully swirl the fat around 
the wok.
4 Add any aromatics to the pan and fry, tossing the ingredients in the oil, to release their 
aromas for approximately 15–30 seconds.
5 Add the main ingredients; those requiring the longest cooking first. Cook, tossing the food 
with a metal spatula continuously. The constant motion keeps the foods from burning.
6 Cook until done. Doneness is usually determined by timing or touch.
7 Add sauce ingredients and thickeners. Cook while stirring until the sauce thickens. 
Serve immediately.
➊ Heat a wok over high heat. Add fat and stir 
so that the fat coats the bottom and halfway 
up the sides of the pan. Add items to the pan 
and cook while constantly stirring and tossing 
the food against the sides of the wok.
➋ Cook, tossing the food with a metal 
spatula continuously.
➌ When the items being stir fried are 
tender, add sauce ingredients, cooking 
until thickened.

 Pan-Frying 
Pan-frying shares characteristics with both sautéing and deep-frying. It is a dry-heat 
cooking method in which heat is transferred by conduction from the pan to the food, 
using a moderate amount of fat (i.e., more than sautéing; less than deep-frying). Heat 
is also transferred to the food from the hot fat by convection. Foods to be pan-fried, 
such as slices of eggplant or pieces of bone-in chicken, are usually coated in breading. 
This forms a seal that keeps the food moist and prevents the hot fat from penetrat￾ing the food and causing it to become greasy. (Breading procedures are explained in 
 Chapter 9 , Mise en Place.) 
 To pan-fry foods properly, first heat the fat in a sauté pan. Use enough fat so that 
when the food to be cooked is added, the fat comes one-third to halfway up the item 
being cooked. The fat should be at a temperature somewhat lower than that used for 
sautéing; it should not smoke but should be hot enough so that when the food is added 
it crackles and spatters from the rapid vaporization of moisture. If the temperature is too 
low, the food will absorb excessive amounts of fat; if it is too high, the food will burn on 
the outside before the interior is fully cooked. When the food is properly browned on 
one side, use a fork or tongs to turn it without piercing. Always turn the food away from 
you to prevent being burned by any fat that may splash. When the food is fully cooked, 
remove it from the pan, drain it on absorbent paper and serve it immediately. Pan-frying 
adds a significant amount of fat to foods. Healthy alternatives to pan-frying include roast￾ing and oven-frying. 
 Procedure for Pan-Frying Foods 
1 Cut, pound or otherwise prepare the food to be pan-fried; then bread, batter or flour it 
as desired. 
2 Heat a moderate amount of fat or oil in a heavy pan—usually enough to cover the item one￾third to halfway up its sides. 
3 Add the food to the pan, being careful not to splash the hot fat. 
4 Fry the food on one side until brown. Using tongs, turn and brown the other side. generally 
pan-fried foods are fully cooked when they are well browned on both sides. 
5 Remove the food from the pan and drain it on absorbent paper before serving.

Pan-basting is a variation of pan-frying and sautéing. Portions of meat, poultry or 
fish are cooked in a generous amount of butter, oil or a combination of fats. Fresh 
herbs and spices may be added to the melted fat for flavor. Once the portion of food is 
seared, the hot fat in the pan is spooned over it repeatedly, a technique known as bast￾ing. Although labor intensive, pan-basting enhances the appearance, flavor and surface 
texture of foods cooked in this manner. Like pan-frying, pan-basting (also known as 
butter-basting) adds a significant amount of fat to foods.
 Deep-Frying
Deep-frying is a dry-heat cooking method that uses conduction and convection to 
transfer heat to food submerged in hot fat. Although conceptually similar to boiling, 
deep-frying is not a moist-heat cooking method because the fat used contains no water. 
A key difference between boiling and deep-frying is the temperature of the cooking 
medium. The boiling point, 212°F (100°C), is the hottest temperature at which food can 
be cooked in water. At this temperature, most foods require a long cooking period and 
surface sugars cannot caramelize. With deep-frying, temperatures up to 400°F (204°C) 
can be used. These high temperatures cook food more quickly and allow the food’s 
surface to brown. In contrast to the partially submerged method of pan-frying, foods are 
completely submerged in hot fat when they are deep-fried. Unlike sautéing, foods are 
not moved as they cook and are left undisturbed in the hot fat when deep-frying.
Foods to be deep-fried are usually first coated in batter or breading. This preserves 
moisture and prevents the food from absorbing excessive quantities of fat. Foods to 
be deep-fried should be of a size and shape that allows them to float freely in the fat. 
Foods that are to be deep-fried together should be of uniform size and shape. Delicately 
flavored foods should not be deep-fried in the same fat used for more strongly fla￾vored ones. The former could develop an odd taste from residual flavors left in the fat. 
 Deep-fried foods should cook thoroughly while developing an attractive deep golden￾brown color.
Today, most deep-frying is done in specially designed commercial fryers. These 
 deep-fat fryers have built-in thermostats, making temperature control more precise. 
 Deep-frying foods in a saucepan on the stove top is discouraged because it is both dif￾ficult and dangerous. The fat can spill easily, leading to injuries or creating a fire hazard. 
Recovery time is usually very slow, and temperatures are difficult to control.
To deep-fry food, first heat the fat or oil to a temperature between 325°F and 375°F 
(163°C and 191°C). The cooking medium’s temperature can be adjusted within this 
range to allow the interior of thicker foods or frozen foods to cook before their surfaces 
become too dark. The fat must be hot enough to quickly seal the surface of the food so 
that it does not become excessively greasy, yet it should not be so hot that the food’s 
surface burns before the interior is cooked.
There are two methods of deep-frying: the basket method and the swimming method. 
The basket method uses a basket to hold foods that will not tend to stick together dur￾ing cooking. Typically these foods are breaded or are individually quick-frozen. The bas￾ket is removed from the fryer and filled as much as two-thirds full of product. (Do not fill 
the basket while it is hanging over the fat, as this allows excess salt and food particles to 
fall into the fat, shortening the usable life of the fat.) The filled basket is then submerged 
in the hot fat. When cooking is completed, the basket is used to remove the foods from 
the fat and hold them while excess fat drains off.
A variation on this procedure is the double-basket method. It is used because many 
foods float as they deep-fry. This may produce undesirable results because the portion 
of the food not submerged may not cook. To prevent this and to promote even cook￾ing, a second basket is placed over the food held in the first basket, keeping the food 
submerged in the fat.
Most battered foods initially sink to the bottom when placed in hot fat, then rise to the 
top as they cook. Because they would stick to a basket, the swimming method is used 
for battered foods. With the swimming method, battered foods are carefully dropped 
directly into the hot fat. (Baskets are not used.) They rise to the top as they cook. When

5 Remove the deep-fried food from the fryer and hold it over the cooking fat, allowing the 
excess fat to drain off.

Choosing Fats for Deep-Frying
Many types of fats can be used for deep-frying. Although animal fats, such as rendered 
beef or duck fat, are sometimes used to impart their specific flavors to deep-fried foods, 
their low smoke points generally make them unsuitable for deep-frying unless they are 
blended with vegetable fats. Such fats will solidify as they cool, leaving a greasy coating 
on the palate. By far the most common fats used for deep-frying are vegetable oils, such 
as soybean, peanut and canola oil, all of which have high smoke points and are rela￾tively inexpensive. Quality olive oil, although more costly than some oils, adds its health 
benefits to foods deep-fried in it. (See Table 10.3.)
Specially formulated deep-frying compounds are also available. These are usually 
composed of a vegetable oil or oils to which antifoaming agents, antioxidants and pre￾servatives have been added. These additives increase the oil’s usable life and raise its 
smoke point.
Deep-fryer fats may also be hydrogenated. Hydrogenation is a chemical process that 
adds hydrogen to oil, turning the liquid oil into a solid (margarine is hydrogenated veg￾etable oil). Hydrogenated fats are more resistant to oxidation, development of off flavors 
and foaming, all indications of chemical breakdown of the fat.
To choose the right fat, consider flavor, smoke point and resistance to chemical break￾down. High-quality frying fat should have a clean or natural flavor and a high smoke 
point and, when properly maintained, should be resistant to chemical breakdown

Handling Fats for Deep-Frying
Properly maintaining deep-fryer fat greatly extends its useful life. (See Figure 10.4 and 
Table 10.4.) To do so:
1 Store fat in tightly sealed containers away from strong light; cover the deep fryer 
when not in use. Prolonged exposure to air and light turns fat rancid.
2 Skim and remove food particles from fat’s surface during frying. Food particles 
cause fat to break down; if they are not removed, they accumulate in the fryer 
and burn.
3 Do not salt food over fat. Salt causes fat to break down chemically.
4 Prevent excessive water from coming into contact with fat; pat-dry moist foods as 
much as possible before cooking and dry the fryer, baskets and utensils well after 
cleaning. Water, like salt, causes fat to break down.
5 Do not overheat fat (turn the fryer down or off if not in use). High temperatures 
break down fat.
6 Filter fat each day or after each shift if the fryer is heavily used. Best results are 
obtained by using a filtering machine designed specifically for this purpose. Many 
large commercial fryers even have built-in filter systems. Less well-equipped 
operations can simply pour the hot fat through a paper filter.
The fat used to cook fish or shellfish should not be used to cook vegetables, meat or

MOIST-HEAT COOKING METHODS
Cooking with moist heat involves applying heat to food by submerging it directly into 
a hot water-based liquid or by exposing it to steam. The liquid may be plain water, but 
stock, wine or a seasoned liquid is often chosen to add flavor to the item being cooked. 
When heating liquids for moist-heat cooking methods, cover the pot to prevent heat loss 
and evaporation. During cooking, keep the lid on or remove it as directed in the recipe. 
Each of the following moist-heat cooking methods can be applied to a variety of foods. 
(See Table 10.5.)
Poaching
Poaching is a moist-heat cooking method that uses convection to transfer heat from 
a water-based liquid to a food. It is most often associated with delicately flavored 
foods that do not require lengthy cooking times to tenderize them, such as eggs, fruit 
or fish.
For poaching, the food is placed in a liquid held at temperatures between 160°F 
and 180°F (71°C and 82°C). The surface should show only slight movement, but there 
should be no bubbles. It is important to maintain the desired temperature throughout 
the cooking process. Do not allow the liquid to reach a boil; the resulting agitation will 
cause meats to become tough and stringy and will destroy tender foods such as fresh 
fruit or fish.
The flavor of the poaching liquid strongly affects the ultimate flavor of the finished 
product, so stock, court bouillon or broth is generally used. The liquid used to poach a 
food is sometimes used to make an accompanying sauce.
BASIC PROCEDURE
Equipment: Stove top, oven, steam kettle, tilting 
skillet, thermal bath
Method: Food is submerged in a water-based liquid 
at 160–180°F (71–82°C).
Use: For delicate foods; flavor of liquid affects 
finished product.

There are two methods of poaching: submersion poaching and shallow poaching. For 
submersion poaching, the food is completely covered with the cooking liquid. There 
should not be too much excess liquid, however, as additional liquid can leach away 
much of the food’s flavor. Nor should there be too little liquid, as that could leave a por￾tion of the food exposed, preventing it from cooking.
For shallow poaching, the food is placed in just enough liquid to come approxi￾mately halfway up its sides. The liquid for shallow poaching, called a cuisson, is brought 
to a simmer on the stove top. The pan is then covered with a piece of buttered parch￾ment paper or a lid, and cooking is completed either on the stove top or in the oven. 
Shallow poaching combines aspects of poaching and steaming.
Both submersion and shallow poaching are healthy cooking methods as no fat is 
added. Any fat that is released into the cooking liquid from meat or fish during poaching 
should be removed if the cooking liquid will be used to make a sauce served with the 
dish. Any time food is submerged in water or other liquids during cooking, vitamins and 
minerals are removed by leaching into the liquid, which may be reserved for use as a 
sauce or stock.

shallow poaching
Procedure for Poaching Foods
1 Cut, trim or otherwise prepare the food to be poached.
2 Bring an adequate amount of cooking liquid to the desired starting temperature. (For some 
items, such as eggs, the cooking liquid is first brought to a boil and then reduced to the 
poaching temperature.) Place the food in the liquid.
3 For submersion poaching, the liquid should completely cover the food.
4 For shallow poaching, the liquid should come approximately halfway up the side of the 
food. if shallow poaching, cover the pan with a piece of buttered parchment paper or a lid.
5 Maintaining the proper temperature, poach the food to the desired doneness in the oven or 
on the stove top. Doneness is generally determined by timing, internal temperature 
or tenderness.
6 Remove the food and hold it for service in a portion of the cooking liquid or, using an ice 
bath, cool it in the cooking liquid.
7 The cooking liquid can sometimes be used to prepare an accompanying sauce or reserved 
for poaching other foods.
➊ Season the poaching liquid as desired and 
bring it to the correct temperature.
➋ Carefully place the food item into the 
poaching liquid.
➌ Remove the cooked food from the 
poaching liquid.
M10_LABE1163_07_SE_C10.indd 214 31/10/23 7:42 PMPRiNCiPlES oF CookiNg 215
 Simmering 
Simmering is another moist-heat cooking method that uses convection to transfer heat 
from a water-based liquid to a food. It is often associated with foods that need to be 
tenderized through long, slow, moist cooking, such as less tender cuts of meat. Properly 
simmered foods should be moist and very tender. For simmering, the food is submerged 
in a liquid held between 185°F and 205°F (85°C and 96°C). Because simmering tempera￾tures are slightly higher than those used for poaching, there should be more action on 
the liquid’s surface, with a few air bubbles breaking through (see photo on page 213 ) . 
 As with poaching, the liquid used for simmering has a great effect on the food’s fla￾vor. Be sure to use a well-flavored stock or broth and to add mirepoix (see page 225 ) , 
herbs and seasonings as needed. Simmering is a healthy cooking method as no fat is 
added. Any fat that is released into the cooking liquid from meat or fish during simmer￾ing should be removed if the liquid will be used to make a sauce served with the dish. 
Any time food is submerged in water or other liquids during cooking, vitamins and min￾erals are leached into the liquid. 
 Procedure for Simmering Foods 
1 Cut, trim or otherwise prepare the food to be simmered. 
2 Bring an adequate amount of the cooking liquid to the appropriate temperature (some 
foods, especially smoked or cured items, are started in a cold liquid). There should be 
enough liquid to cover the food completely. 
3 Add the food to the simmering liquid. 
4 Maintaining the proper cooking temperature throughout the process, simmer the food to 
the desired doneness. Doneness is generally determined by timing or tenderness. 
5 Remove the item and hold it for service in a portion of the cooking liquid or, using an ice 
bath, cool the food in its cooking liquid. 
 B A S I C P R O C E D U R E 
 Equipment: Stove top, steam kettle, tilting skillet, 
thermal bath 
 Method: Food is submerged in a water-based liquid 
at 185–205°F (85–96°C). 
 Use: Used for poultry, beef, fish, pork, fruit, 
grains and vegetables; flavor of liquid affects 
finished product. 
➊ Fully submerge the item being simmered in 
the seasoned liquid. 
➋ Remove the cooked item from the liquid. 
 Boiling 
Boiling is another moist-heat cooking method that uses the process of convection to transfer 
heat from a water-based liquid to a food. Boiling relies on large amounts of rapidly bubbling 
liquid to cook foods. The turbulent waters and the relatively high temperatures cook foods 
more quickly than do poaching or simmering. Few foods, however, are cooked by true 
boiling. Most “boiled” meats are actually simmered. Even “hard-boiled” eggs are really only 
simmered. Blanching and par boiling, discussed in Chapter 9 , Mise en Place, rely on boiling 
water to partially cook foods to assist in their preparation. Starches such as pasta and pota￾toes are among the only types of food that are truly boiled. 
 B A S I C P R O C E D U R E 
 Equipment: Stove top, steam kettle, tilting skillet 
 Method: Food is submerged in a water-based liquid 
kept at a full boil, 212°F (100°C). 
 Use: For starchy foods such as pasta and potatoes; 
flavor of liquid affects finished product. 
M10_LABE1163_07_SE_C10.indd 215 31/10/23 7:42 PM216 CHAPTER TEN
 At sea level, water boils at 212°F (100°C). As altitude increases, the boiling point 
decreases because of the drop in atmospheric pressure. For every 1000 feet above sea 
level, the boiling point of water drops 2°F (1°C). In the mile-high city of Denver, water 
boils at 203°F (95°C). Because the boiling temperature is lower, it takes longer to cook 
foods in Denver than in sea-level Miami. 
 The addition of alcohol also lowers the boiling point of water because alcohol boils 
at about 175°F (79°C). In contrast, the addition of salt, sugar or other substances raises 
water’s boiling point slightly. This means that foods cooked in salted water cook faster 
because the boiling point is one or two degrees higher. 
 Use as much water as practical when boiling food. Whenever food is added to boiling 
water, it lowers the water’s temperature. The greater the amount of water, however, the 
faster it returns to a boil. Boiling is a healthy cooking method as no fat is used. Any time 
food is submerged in water or other liquids during cooking, vitamins and minerals are 
leached into the liquid. Liquid in which food has been boiled may be reserved for cook￾ing other foods as long as it has not picked up strong flavors. 
➊ Bring the cooking liquid to a full boil. 
When the item being cooked is added to the 
liquid, the temperature of the liquid decreases. 
 Procedure for Boiling Foods 
1 Bring an appropriate amount of a water-based liquid to a boil over high heat. Add 
seasonings as desired. 
2 Add the food to be boiled to the rapidly boiling liquid. Bring the liquid back to a boil and 
adjust the temperature to maintain the boil. 
3 Cook until done. Doneness is usually determined by timing or texture. 
4 Remove the boiled food from the cooking liquid, draining any excess liquid. 
5 Serve the boiled food immediately. Some boiled foods can be refreshed in cold water and 
held for later service. 
➋ After a boiled item, such as pasta, is 
cooked, it may be drained through a colander. 
 Steaming 
Steaming is a moist-heat cooking method that uses the process of convection to transfer 
heat from the steam to the food being cooked. It is most often associated with tender, 
delicately flavored foods, such as fish and vegetables, which do not require long cook￾ing times. Steaming can enhance a food’s natural flavor and help to retain its nutrients. 
Properly steamed foods should be moist and tender. Additional flavor can be introduced 
by adding wine, stock, aromatics, spices or herbs to the liquid used as the steaming 
medium. The steaming liquid can also be used to make a sauce to be served with the 
steamed food. 
 B A S I C P R O C E D U R E 
 Equipment: Stove top, convection steamer 
 Method: Food is surrounded and cooked by steam 
only; it is not in contact with boiling liquids. 
 Use: For delicate foods, vegetables; helps 
retain nutrients. 
M10_LABE1163_07_SE_C10.indd 216 31/10/23 7:42 PMPRiNCiPlES oF CookiNg 217
Anytime food is enclosed and steam is created, such as when a potato is wrapped 
in foil before baking, steaming is part of the cooking method. Most often, however, the 
food to be steamed is placed in a basket or rack above a boiling liquid. In general, the 
food should not touch the liquid; it should be positioned so that the steam can circulate 
around it. Some foods, such as shellfish and ears of corn, however, can be placed directly 
in a shallow pool of boiling water. A lid should be placed on the steaming pot to trap the 
steam and also create a slight pressure within the pot, which speeds the cooking process.
Another type of steaming uses a convection steamer. Convection steamers use pres￾surized steam to cook food very quickly in an enclosed chamber. Convection steamer 
cooking does not produce a flavored liquid that can be used to make a sauce.
Steamed foods should be served immediately. If held for later service, they should be 
refreshed in ice water and refrigerated, then reheated for service. Steaming is considered 
a healthy cooking method as it uses no fats and vitamins and minerals do not leach into 
the cooking liquid.
Procedure for Steaming Foods
1 Cut, trim or otherwise prepare the food to be steamed.
2 if a convection steamer is not being used, prepare a steaming liquid and bring it to a boil in 
a covered pan or double boiler.
3 Place the food to be steamed on a rack, in a basket or on a perforated hotel pan in a single 
layer. Do not crowd the items. Place the rack, basket or pan over the boiling liquid.
4 Alternatively, place the food in a shallow pool of the cooking liquid.
5 Cover the cooking assemblage and cook to the desired doneness. Doneness is usually 
determined by timing, color or tenderness.
➊ Trim items before steaming them so that 
they cook evenly.
➋ A perforated hotel pan can be set over a 
deeper pan of boiling water, covered and used 
as a steamer.
COMBINATION COOKING METHODS
Some cooking methods employ both dry-heat and moist-heat cooking techniques. The 
two most common combination methods are braising and stewing. In both methods, the 
first step is usually to brown the main item using dry heat. The second step is to complete 
cooking by simmering the food in a liquid. Combination methods are often used for less 
tender but flavorful cuts of meat as well as for poultry and some vegetables. Depending 
upon the cuts of meat, fish or poultry used, and the accompanying sauce ingredients, 
braising can be a healthy cooking technique. Stews that include a starch-thickened cook￾ing liquid are considered less healthy.
M10_LABE1163_07_SE_C10.indd 217 31/10/23 7:42 PM218 CHAPTER TEN
Braising
Braising uses a combination of dry- and moist-heat cooking methods to provide the 
best aspects of both methods. Foods to be braised are usually large pieces that are first 
browned in a small amount of fat at high temperatures. As with sautéing, heat is trans￾ferred from the pan to the food mainly by the process of conduction. Vegetables and 
seasonings are added, and enough sauce or liquid is added to come one-third to halfway 
up the item being cooked. The pan is covered, and the heat is reduced. The food is then 
cooked at low heat, using a combination of simmering and steaming to transfer heat from 
the liquid (conduction) and the air (convection) to the food. This can be done on the 
stove top, in a tilting skillet or in the oven. A long, slow cooking period helps tenderize 
the item. Braised foods are usually served with a sauce made from the cooking liquid.
BASIC PROCEDURE
Equipment: Stove top, oven, tilting skillet
Method: large pieces of food are browned in fat; 
liquid is added, then food is covered and cooked 
at low heat.
Use: Tenderizes tough cuts of meat or poultry 
or softens firm fruits and vegetables after 
surface browning.
➊ Sear the item in fat. ➋ Add cooking liquid to the pan. ➌ Baste the item with liquid during cooking.
Procedure for Braising Foods
1 Cut, trim or otherwise prepare the food to be braised. Dredge it in flour, if desired.
2 Heat a small amount of fat in a heavy pan or tilting skillet.
3 Sear the food on all sides. Some foods—notably meats—should be removed from the pan 
and kept warm after they are seared.
4 Add vegetables, seasonings or any other ingredients and sauté.
5 Add flour or thickener, if desired, to thicken the sauce.
6 Add cooking liquid to partially cover the food being braised.
7 Add aromatics and seasonings.
8 if the principal item was removed, return it to the pan.
9 Cover the pan and bring the cooking liquid to a simmer. Cook slowly, either on the stove 
top or in an oven at 250–300°F (120–150°C). Baste and turn the food as needed.
10 Doneness is usually determined by texture and tenderness. When the principal item is 
cooked, remove it from the pan and hold it in a warm place.
11 Prepare a sauce from the braising liquid if desired. This may be done by cooking the liquid 
on the stove top to intensify its flavors. if the food was braised in an unthickened stock, the 
stock may now be thickened using a roux, arrowroot or cornstarch. Strain the sauce or, if 
desired, purée the mirepoix and other ingredients and return them to the sauce. Adjust the 
sauce’s consistency as desired.

usually done as a preparatory step for 
combination cooking methods
Stewing
Stewing also uses a combination of dry- and moist-heat cooking methods. Stewing 
is most often associated with smaller pieces of food that are first browned in a small 
amount of fat or oil or blanched in a liquid. Cooking is then finished in a liquid or sauce, 
which is served as part of the finished dish. Stewed foods have enough liquid added 
to cover them completely and are simmered at a constant temperature until tender. 
Cooking time is generally shorter for stewing than for braising because the items are 
smaller. When stewing most plants, which lack tough muscle fibers, cooking time tends 
to be shorter than for animal products.
BASIC PROCEDURE
Equipment: Stove top, oven, tilting skillet, 
thermal bath
Method: Small pieces of food are browned in fat; liq￾uid is added, then food is covered and simmered.
Use: Tenderizes tough cuts of meat, poultry or fish, 
softens fruits and vegetables; liquid becomes sauce.
M10_LABE1163_07_SE_C10.indd 218 31/10/23 7:42 PMPRiNCiPlES oF CookiNg 219
Procedure for Stewing Foods
1 Trim and cut the food to be stewed into small, uniform-sized pieces. Dredge the pieces in 
flour, if desired.
2 Heat a small amount of fat in a heavy pan. Sear the food on all sides, developing color 
as desired.
3 Add vegetables, seasonings or any other ingredients and sauté.
4 Add flour or roux to thicken the liquid during cooking.
5 gradually add the cooking liquid, stirring to prevent lumps. The liquid should completely 
cover the principal items.
6 Bring the stew to the appropriate temperature. Cover and place in the oven at 250–300°F 
(120–150°C) or continue to simmer on the stove top until the principal items of meat, fish, 
fruit or vegetables are tender. Doneness is usually determined by texture and tenderness.
7 Remove the principal items and hold them in a warm place.
8 Thicken the sauce as desired.
9 Return the principal items to the stew. if not added during the cooking process, vegetables 
and other garnishes may be cooked separately and added to the finished stew. Degrease the 
stew as necessary. ➊ Brown food in a small amount of fat.
➋ Add flour to make a roux. ➌ gradually add cooking liquid to the pan. ➍ Degrease the finished stew as necessary.
Sous Vide
Sous vide, a French term that means “under vacuum,” is a low-temperature, combination 
cooking method that resembles braising or poaching. Foods are vacuum sealed in heavy￾gauge plastic pouches and cooked in a temperature-controlled water bath. The reduced 
oxygen environment of foods packaged under vacuum concentrates flavors and extends 
shelf life. In addition, the temperatures for sous vide cooking, which range from 125°F 
(51°C) to 195°F (90°C), rarely exceed the desired temperature of the finished dish, resulting 
in foods that are precisely cooked but not overcooked. Food safety is ensured by cook￾ing the foods the proper length of time at a constant temperature. This cooking method, 
which uses conduction to convey heat from the hot water bath to the food, has been in 
use for several decades in commercial food production. Chefs have discovered that this 
method produces tender, flavorful fresh meat, fish and seafood. Sous vide techniques are 
also useful for preparing delicate sauces, eggs and vegetables. It is of increasing interest to 
restaurant chefs for its precise and specific results.
To prepare foods sous vide in the restaurant kitchen, individual portions or small 
quantities of meat, poultry, fish, vegetables or other foods are trimmed and seasoned 
and placed in food grade, heat-resistant plastic pouches. The pouches are then sealed 
in a chamber vacuum machine. The chamber vacuum machine, which removes air and 
increases the pressure on the food, ensures that heat transfers efficiently from the water 
to the food in the pouch during cooking. Removing most of the oxygen also increases 
the shelf life of the food, both before and after it is cooked sous vide. (Once packaged, 
the food may be chilled below the temperature danger zone in a water bath, refrigerator 
BASIC PROCEDURE
Equipment: Chamber vacuum machine or 
thermal bath
Method: Vacuum-sealed pouch of seasoned food is 
submerged in temperature-controlled water bath.
Use: Cooking at a precise, steady temperature for 
tenderness and uniformity without carameliza￾tion. Food may be browned after cooking.
M10_LABE1163_07_SE_C10.indd 219 31/10/23 7:42 PM220 CHAPTER TEN
or blast chiller to be cooked later.) Pressure is adjusted according to the food being 
cooked; firmer cuts of meat with low moisture content are packed at a higher pressure 
than fragile, moist cuts, for example.
Sous vide is used to cook fish, vegetables and tender cuts of poultry and meat, such 
as beef tenderloin. Tougher cuts of beef, veal, lamb and other meats that benefit from 
braising are also ideal for sous vide cooking. Meats for stews or braises that would con￾ventionally be browned before simmering may be browned before sealing in a pouch.
Sous vide cooking takes place in a precisely regulated hot water bath at temperatures 
between 122°F (50°C) and 185°F (90°C) for anywhere from 1 to 72 hours. Fish, tender 
cuts of meat and vegetables cook more quickly than tough cuts of meat that have more 
connective tissue. The temperature and the length of time in the water bath vary depend￾ing upon the type of food being cooked and the desired results. (Because of the many 
variables when cooking sous vide, follow the recommended cooking temperatures and 
times in the recipes provided in the book.) When cooking tender cuts of fish, poultry or 
meat such as beef tenderloin, the temperature is determined by the desired core tem￾perature of the finished food item. When roasted conventionally, a beef tenderloin, for 
example, is seared and then roasted at 375–450°F (190–230°C) until its internal tempera￾ture reaches the desired degree of doneness. During the conventional dry-heat cooking 
process, the exterior layers of the meat cook more than the center and the final product 
may be overcooked and dry around the edges. When cooking beef tenderloin sous vide,
the meat is vacuum packed then cooked in a water bath set to the desired final tempera￾ture (e.g., 125°F/51°C for rare meat). Sous vide cooking achieves a uniformly rare piece 
of meat with less shrinkage. To add the flavor and eye appeal of a browned surface, the 
surface of the meat may be seared at the time of service.
When braising tougher cuts of meats or poultry, cooking for several hours at a tem￾perature from 148°F (64°C) to 160°F (71°C) may be recommended. This temperature 
range is hot enough to dissolve connective tissues and collagen without squeezing all 
the moisture and fat from the meat. The cooking temperature and the length of time 
used for braising foods sous vide depends on the desired results. A briefer cooking time 
at a higher temperature may be all that is needed to produce fork-tender meat as with a 
conventional braise. But cooking the food longer at a lower temperature may result in 
meat that retains its shape and pink color resembling rare meat yet is fully cooked and 
juicy. One benefit chefs cite for sous vide cooking is precision. Once food cooked sous 
vide reaches the temperature of the water bath, it cannot overcook and it can be held 
at the desired temperature for several hours in the water bath before service. Although 
holding a food in the water bath for too long does not alter its temperature, it may soften 
its texture. Foods cooked sous vide may also be chilled below the temperature danger 
zone (41°F/5°C) then held under refrigeration or frozen for later service. When refrigerat￾ing pouches of food cooked sous vide, store them covered with ice.
Food safety is of utmost concern when using sous vide techniques because of the low 
cooking temperatures and low oxygen atmosphere in the vacuum-sealed pouches. Such 
pathogens as Clostridium botulinum, Escherichia coli (E. coli), Listeria monocytogenes
and Salmonella can multiply in the low cooking temperatures used. The 2022 Food Code 
requires that a detailed HACCP program, including time and temperature monitoring, be in 
place in any food service operation using sous vide cooking methods. Before using sous vide
techniques, consult local health authorities to learn what technical training, licensing and 
recordkeeping are required. Some communities may prohibit the use of sous vide cooking 
entirely. Equipment for sous vide cooking is discussed in Chapter 5, Tools and Equipment.
 Safety Alert
Cooking Foods Sous Vide
When preparing foods to be packaged 
in plastic pouches for sous vide cooking, 
observe the following food safety practices:
1 learn and follow the local health 
codes and requirements for preparing 
foods sous vide. Prepare a detailed 
HACCP plan for each sous vide item. 
(See page 32.)
2 Work in a clean and sanitized 
environment using professional 
vacuum packaging machinery. 
Wear clean single-use gloves and 
change them as needed during food 
preparation. To take the internal 
temperature of meat in a sous vide 
pouch, apply a piece of closed cell 
foam tape to the top of a bag. Then 
pierce the tape with a needle probe 
thermometer designed for use with 
sous vide bags. The tape will seal itself 
after the probe is removed.
3 To prevent the growth of 
microorganisms, chill any food to be 
cooked sous vide below the temperature 
danger zone (41°F/5°C) before 
cooking. Thoroughly chill any pre￾cooked foods, such as meat that is 
browned for a stew, before sealing 
them in the pouches.
4 Be mindful of the temperature 
danger zone 41–135°F (5–57°C) 
when cooking sous vide. if the 
cooking temperatures are within the 
temperature danger zone, food cannot 
be held in the water bath for longer 
than 4 hours.
5 Foods prepared sous vide but not 
intended for immediate service must be 
chilled below the temperature danger 
zone (41°F/5°C) before refrigerating. 
Chilling the packages in a salted ice 
bath can lower the temperature to 
32°F (0°C) or below rapidly.
Procedure for Preparing Foods Sous Vide
1 Assemble the proper equipment—single-use gloves, digital thermometer, ice and water 
bath with salt and sanitizing solution—for preparing the food in a sanitary manner. Use an 
immersion circulator to bring a thermal bath to the desired temperature.
2 Cut, trim or otherwise prepare food to be cooked sous vide. immediately chill the food 
in a refrigerator or blast chiller. it must be chilled below the temperature danger zone 
(41°F/5°C) within 4 hours before proceeding.

3 Wearing single-use gloves, place the chilled foods to be cooked sous vide in a single layer in 
plastic pouches. Add fat, seasonings and cooking liquids as desired.
4 Vacuum seal the pouches using a chamber vacuum machine adjusted to the proper setting 
for the food. At this point, the pouches of food may be chilled below the temperature 
danger zone to be cooked later.
5 When ready to cook, place the pouches in the thermal bath heated to the desired cooking 
temperature of the food, allowing enough space for the water to flow freely around them 
without overcrowding. Doneness is determined by temperature or texture of the food. 
Check the temperature with a pointed-tip digital probe thermometer. (Reseal the bag 
before returning it to the circulator if necessary.)
6 Serve the food immediately or transfer the pouches of cooked food to an ice bath with salt 
added to reduce its temperature. The food must be chilled to below 41°F/5°C or lower 
within 4 hours.
7 To serve food previously cooked and chilled, reheat the pouch in a thermal bath set to the 
desired temperature. Check the temperature with a pointed-tip digital probe thermometer. 
(Reseal the bag before returning it to the circulator if necessary.) Reheating a ½-inch- 
(1.25-centimeter-) thick steak may take 30 minutes while a 2-inch- (5-centimeter-) thick one 
may take 2 or more hours to reheat. Plate the food. For a browned surface on foods cooked 
sous vide, reheat the item, remove it from the pouch, then sear it quickly and serve immediately.
➊ Assemble the safety equipment—single￾use gloves, digital probe thermometer with 
pointed tip, ice and water bath with salt and

Astock is a flavored liquid. a good stock is the key to a great soup, sauce or braised 
dish. the French appropriately call a stock fond (“base”), as stocks are the basis 
for many classic and modern dishes. 
 a sauce is a thickened liquid used to flavor and enhance other foods. a good sauce adds 
flavor, moisture, richness and visual appeal. a sauce should complement food; it should 
never disguise it. a sauce can be hot or cold, sweet or savory, smooth or chunky. 
 although the thought of preparing stocks and sauces may be intimidating, the proce￾dures are straightforward. carefully follow the basic procedures outlined in this chapter, use 
high-quality ingredients and, with practice and experience, you will soon be producing fine 
stocks and sauces. 
 this chapter addresses traditional hot sauces as well as coulis, contemporary broths, 
foams, flavored oils, salsas and relishes. cold sauces, generally based on mayonnaise and 
vinaigrettes, are discussed in chapter 24 , Salads and Salad dressings; dessert sauces are dis￾cussed in chapter 35 , custards, creams, Frozen desserts and dessert Sauces.
 CLASSIFICATIONS OF STOCKS 
 There are several types of stocks. Although all stocks are made from a combination of 
bones, vegetables, seasonings and liquids, each type is made using specific procedures 
to give it distinctive characteristics. 
 A white stock is made by simmering chicken, veal or beef bones in water with 
vegetables and seasonings. The stock remains relatively colorless during the cook￾ing process. A brown stock is made from chicken, veal, beef or game bones and 
vegetables, all of which are caramelized before being simmered in water with season￾ings. The stock has a rich, dark color. Both a fish stock and a fumet are made by 
slowly cooking fish bones or crustacean shells and vegetables without coloring them, 
then simmering them in water with seasonings for a short time. For a fumet, wine 
and lemon juice are also added. The resulting stock or fumet is a strongly flavored, 
relatively colorless liquid. A  court bouillon is made by simmering vegetables and 
 seasonings in water and an acidic liquid such as vinegar or wine. It is used to poach 
fish or vegetables. 
 The quality of a stock is judged by four characteristics: body, flavor, clarity and color. 
Body develops when collagen proteins dissolve in protein-based stock. Vegetable stocks 
have less body than meat stocks because they lack animal protein. Aromatic vegetables, 
herb sachets and the proper ratios of ingredients to liquid give stocks their flavor. Clarity 
is achieved by removing impurities during stock making. Many ingredients contribute 
to a stock’s color. Vegetables such as leeks and carrots give white stock a light color. 
Browned bones and tomato paste color dark stocks. Improper uses of coloring ingredi￾ents can overwhelm the color and flavor of a stock. 
 Quality stock is made using the proper ingredients in the right ratios. To ensure that a 
stock has a consistent flavor each time it is prepared, do not use random pieces of meat, 
poultry, fish and vegetables. Instead use any random meat, poultry, fish and vegetable 
trimmings you have on hand to make one-of-a kind soups or liquids for cooking beans 
or grains. 
 fond (1) French for “stock” or “base”; (2) the 
concentrated juices, drippings and bits of food 
left in a pan after a food is roasted or sautéed; 
fond is used to flavor sauces made directly in the 
pans in which foods were cooked 
M11_LABE1163_07_SE_C11.indd 224 28/10/23 1:18 PMStockS and SauceS 225
 INGREDIENTS FOR STOCKS
The basic ingredients of any stock are bones, mirepoix (a mixture of coarsely chopped 
onions, carrots and celery used to flavor stocks discussed below), seasonings and water.
Bones
Bones are the most important ingredient in protein-based stock; they add flavor, rich￾ness and color. Traditionally the kitchen or butcher shop saved the day’s bones to make 
stock. But because food service operations now buy meats and poultry items precut or 
portioned, bones are purchased specifically for stock making.
Different bones release their flavor at different rates. Even though the bones are cut 
into 3- to 4-inch (8- to 10-centimeter) pieces, a stock made entirely of beef and/or veal 
bones requires 6–8 hours of cooking time, whereas a stock made entirely from chicken 
bones requires only 5–6 hours.
Beef and Veal Bones
The best bones for beef and veal stock are from younger animals. They contain a higher 
percentage of cartilage and other connective tissue than do bones from more mature 
animals. Connective tissue has a high collagen content. Through the cooking process, 
the collagen is converted into gelatin and water. Gelatin adds richness and body to 
 finished stock.
The best beef and veal bones are back, neck and shank bones, as they have a high 
collagen content. Beef and veal bones should be cut with a meat saw into small pieces, 
approximately 3–4 inches (8–10 centimeters) long, so that they can release as much 
 flavor as possible while the stock cooks.
Chicken Bones
The best bones for chicken stock are from the neck and back, which contain the most col￾lagen. If a whole chicken carcass or larger bones are used, they should be broken up or 
chopped with a cleaver or the heel or a heavy chef’s knife to release flavor and collagen.
Fish Bones
The best bones for fish stock are from lean fish such as sole, flounder, whiting or turbot. 
Bones from fatty fish (e.g., salmon, tuna and swordfish) do not produce good stock 
because of their high fat content and distinctive flavors. The entire fish carcass can be 
used, but it should be cut up with a cleaver or heavy knife for easy handling and even 
extraction of flavors. After cutting, rinse the pieces in cold water to remove blood, loose 
scales and other impurities.
Other Bones
Lamb, turkey, game and ham bones can be used for white or brown stocks. Although 
mixing bones is generally acceptable, be careful of blending strongly flavored bones, 
such as those from lamb or game, with beef, veal or chicken bones. The former’s strong 
flavors may not be appropriate or desirable in the finished product.
Mirepoix
A mirepoix is a mixture of chopped onions, carrots and celery added to a stock to 
enhance its flavor and aroma. Although chefs differ on the ratio of vegetables, generally 
a mixture of 50 percent onions, 25 percent carrots and 25 percent celery, by weight, is 
used. (Unless otherwise noted, any reference to mirepoix in this text refers to this ratio.) 
For a brown stock, onion skins may be used in mirepoix to add color. Although washing 
is essential, it is not necessary to peel the carrots or celery because flavor, not aesthetics, 
is important.
cartilage also known as gristle; a tough, 
elastic, whitish connective tissue that helps give 
structure to an animal’s body
connective tissue tissue found throughout an 
animal’s body that binds together and supports 
other tissues such as muscles
collagen a protein found in nearly all 
connective tissue; collagen dissolves when 
cooked with moisture
gelatin a tasteless and odorless mixture of 
proteins (especially collagen) extracted from 
simmering bones, connective tissue and other 
animal parts; when dissolved in a hot liquid 
and then cooled, gelatin forms a jellylike 
substance used as a thickener and stabilizer
mirepoix [meer-pwa] a mixture of chopped 
onions, carrots and celery used to flavor stocks, 
stews and other foods; generally, a mixture

25 percent celery, by weight, is used
matignon a standard mirepoix plus diced 
smoked bacon or smoked ham and, depending 
on the dish, mushrooms and herbs; sometimes 
called an edible mirepoix, it is usually cut more 
uniformly than a standard mirepoix and left in 
the finished dish as a garnish

The size into which the mirepoix is chopped is determined by the stock’s cooking 
time: The shorter the cooking time, the smaller the vegetables must be chopped to 
ensure that all possible flavor is extracted. For white or brown stocks made from beef or 
veal bones, the vegetables should be coarsely chopped into large, 1- to 2-inch (2.5- to 
5-centimeter) pieces. For chicken and fish stocks, the vegetables should be more finely 
chopped into ½-inch (1.2-centimeter) pieces.
A white mirepoix is made by replacing the carrots in a standard mirepoix with pars￾nips and adding mushrooms and leeks. Some chefs prefer to use a white mirepoix when 
making a white stock, as it produces a lighter product. Sometimes parsnips, mushrooms 
and leeks are added to a standard mirepoix for additional flavors.
The uses for mirepoix extend beyond stock making. Many braised dishes, sauces, 
soups and stews begin with gently sautéed mirepoix. Cuisines throughout the world 
have their own variations of this flavor base. The “holy trinity” in Cajun cooking, for 
example, is a mixture of diced onions, celery and green bell peppers that is gently sau￾téed as a base for many dishes such as gumbo and jambalaya. Similarly Asian cuisines 
often start with a mixture of chopped garlic, ginger and spring onions to flavor stir-fried 
and simmered dishes. (See Table 11.1.)
Seasonings
Principal stock seasonings are peppercorns, bay leaves, thyme, parsley stems and, 
optionally, garlic. These seasonings generally can be left whole. A stock is cooked long 
enough for all of their flavors to be extracted, so there is no reason to chop or grind 
them. Seasonings generally are added to the stock at the start of cooking. Some chefs 
do not add seasonings to beef or veal stock until midway through the cooking process, 
however, because of the extended cooking times. Seasonings can be added as a sachet 
d’épices or a bouquet garni. (See Chapter 9, Mise en Place.)

Salt, an otherwise important seasoning, is not added to stock. Because a stock has 
a variety of uses, it is impossible to know how much salt to add when preparing it. If, 
for example, the stock was seasoned to taste with salt, you could not reduce it later; 
salt is not lost through reduction, and the concentrated product would taste too salty. 
Similarly seasoning the stock to taste with salt could prevent you from adding other 
ingredients that are high in salt when finishing a recipe. Unlike the flavor of many 
seasonings, which must be incorporated into a product through lengthy cooking 
periods, salt can be added at any time during the cooking process and affect flavor 
in the same way.
PRINCIPLES OF STOCK MAKING
Quality stocks are made using the proper ingredients and by taking the proper steps. 
The principles of making stocks described here and outlined in Figure 11.1 apply to all 
stocks. Follow them in order to achieve the highest-quality stocks possible. Consult 
Table 11.2 when problems arise.
Always start the stock in cold water. When bones are covered with cold water, blood 
and other impurities dissolve. As the water heats, the impurities coagulate and rise to 
the surface, where they can be removed easily by skimming. If the bones were covered 
with hot water, the impurities would coagulate more quickly and remain dispersed in the 
stock without rising to the top, making the stock cloudy. Stocks made from vegetables 
should also be started in cold water so that the vegetables cook slowly. Gentle simmer￾ing allows their flavors to be fully extracted. If the water level falls below the bones or 
vegetables during cooking, add cold water to cover them. Flavor cannot be extracted 
from bones that are not under water, and bones exposed to the air will darken and dis￾color a white stock.
The stock should be brought to a boil and then reduced to a simmer, a temperature 
of approximately 185°F (85°C). Gentle simmering allows the ingredients to release their 
flavors into the liquid. If kept at a simmer, the liquid will remain clear as it reduces and 
the stock develops. Never boil a stock for any length of time. Rapid boiling of a stock, 
even for a few minutes, causes impurities and fats to blend with the liquid, making it 
cloudy. A stock should be skimmed often to remove the fat and impurities that rise to 
Figure 11.1 Principles of stock making.

the surface during cooking. If they are not removed, fat and impurities may make the 
stock cloudy. Even vegetable stocks should be skimmed should any fat or impurities rise 
to the surface.
Once a stock is fully cooked, the liquid must be separated from the bones, vegetables 
and other solid ingredients. To keep the liquid clear, it is important not to disturb the 
solid ingredients when removing the liquid. This is easily accomplished if the stock 
is cooked in a steam kettle or stockpot with a spigot at the bottom. Open the spigot 
and allow the stock to drain through a mesh strainer lined with several layers of damp 
cheesecloth. Dampening the cheesecloth with clean water helps prevent it from absorb￾ing the stock.
If the stock is cooked in a standard stockpot, follow these steps to strain it:
1 Skim as much fat and as many impurities from the surface as possible before 
removing the stockpot from the heat.
2 After removing the pot from the heat, carefully ladle the stock from the pot 
without stirring it.
3 Strain the stock through a china cap lined with several layers of damp cheesecloth.
➊ covering bones with cold water. ➋ Skimming the fat and the impurities from 
stock as it simmers.
➌ Straining stock through a cheesecloth-lined 
china cap.
Procedure for Making Stock
1 Start the stock in cold water. Place the bones for the stock in a large stock pot. cover the 
bones with cold water, making certain that all bones are completely submerged.
2 Simmer the stock gently. Bring the stock to a boil and then reduce to a simmer, a 
temperature of approximately 185°F (85°c), for the time specified in the recipe for 
the particular type of stock you are making. (Fish stock may simmer for as little as 
30 minutes while brown beef stock may require 8 hours of gentle simmering.) do not 
allow the stock to boil. If the water level falls below the bones during cooking, add cold 
water to cover them.
3 Skim the stock frequently. While the stock simmers, skim off the fat and impurities that rise 
to the surface of the stock.
4 once the stock finishes cooking, carefully strain out the bones, vegetables and other 
solid ingredients, then strain the stock through a china cap lined with several layers of 
damp cheesecloth.
M11_LABE1163_07_SE_C11.indd 228 28/10/23 1:18 PMStockS and SauceS 229
 Most stocks are prepared in large quantities, cooled and held for later use. Great care 
must be taken when cooling a stock to prevent food-borne illnesses or the develop￾ment of a sour, off-taste. To cool a stock below the temperature danger zone quickly 
and safely, several steps must be followed. One critical step is venting the stockpot by 
elevating it in a deep sink then filling the sink with cold water. The water circulates on 
all sides of the pot speeding cooling. (See Figure 11. 2 .) 
 In addition to this venting procedure, cooling wands can be used to speed the cooling 
of stocks, soups, sauces and other liquids. These wands (also known as ice paddles) are hol￾low plastic containers that can be filled with water or ice, sealed, frozen and then used to stir 
and cool liquids. Clean and sanitize the wand after each use to prevent cross-contamination. 
 Safety Alert 
 Cooling and Handling Stocks 
 a two-stage cooling method is 
recommended for keeping stock out of 
the temperature danger zone. First cool 
the stock to 70°F (21°c) within 2 hours 
and from 70°F to below 41°F (21°c to 
below 5°c) in an additional 4 hours, for 
a total of 6 hours. to prevent bacterial 
growth if these temperatures have not 
been met, the stock must be reheated 
to 165°F (74°c) for 15 seconds within 
2 hours and then cooled using the 
two-stage method.

 Procedure for Cooling Stock Quickly 
1 keep the stock in a metal container. a plastic container is a poor choice because it insulates 
the stock and delays cooling. 
2 Vent the stockpot in an empty sink by placing it on blocks or a rack. this allows water to 
circulate on all sides and below the pot when the sink is filled with water. (See Figure 11. 2 .) 
3 Install an overflow pipe in the drain and fill the sink with cold water or a combination of cold 
water and ice. Make sure that the weight of the stockpot is adequate to keep it from tipping over. 
4 Let cold water run into the sink and drain out the overflow pipe. Stir the stock frequently to 
facilitate even, quick cooling. 
 Once the stock is cooled, transfer it to a sanitized covered container (either plastic or 
metal) and store it in the refrigerator. As the stock chills, fat rises to its surface and solidi￾fies. If left intact, this layer of fat helps preserve the stock. Stocks can be stored for up to 
1 week under refrigeration or frozen for several months. 
 Before the stock can be used, the fat that has solidified on its surface must be removed. 
This is referred to as degreasing a stock. To degrease the stock, remove the congealed 
fat from the surface of the stock using a spoon. Discard the fat. 
 White Stock 
 A white or neutral stock is made from beef, veal or chicken bones. The finished stock 
should have a good flavor, good clarity, high gelatin content and little or no color. Veal 
bones are most often used, but any combination of beef, veal or chicken bones may 
be used. Chefs disagree on whether the bones for a white stock should be blanched to 
remove impurities. Some chefs argue that blanching keeps the stock as clear and color￾less as possible; others argue that blanching removes nutrients and flavor.

Brown Stock
A brown stock is made from chicken, veal, beef or game bones. The finished stock 
should have a good flavor, rich dark brown color, good body and high gelatin content. 
The primary differences between a brown stock and a white stock are that for a brown 
stock, the bones and mirepoix are caramelized before being simmered and a tomato 
product is added. These extra steps provide the finished stock with a rich, dark color and 
a more intense flavor. Recall from Chapter 10, Principles of Cooking, that caramelization 
is the process of browning the sugars found on the surface of most foods. Caramelization 
gives brown stock its characteristic flavor and color.
Procedure for Caramelizing Bones
If caramelizing bones, do not wash or blanch them as this delays browning. to caramelize:
1 Place the cut-up bones in a roasting pan one layer deep. It is better to roast several pans of 
bones than to overfill one pan.
2 Roast the bones for approximately 1 hour in a hot oven (375°F/190°c). Stirring occasion￾ally, brown the bones thoroughly, but do not allow them to burn.
3 transfer the roasted bones from the pan to the stockpot.
After the bones are caramelized, the excess fat should be removed and reserved for 
future use. The caramelized and coagulated proteins remaining in the roasting pan are 
very flavorful. To utilize them, deglaze the pan.
deglaze to swirl or stir a liquid (usually wine 
or stock) in a pan to dissolve cooked food 
particles remaining on the bottom; the resulting 
mixture often becomes the base for a sauce
Procedure for Deglazing the Pan
1 Place the roasting pan on the stove top over medium heat and add enough water to cover 
the bottom of the pan approximately ½ inch (1.2 centimeters) deep.
2 Stir and scrape the pan bottom to dissolve and remove all the caramelized materials while 
the water heats.
3 Pour the deglazing liquid (also known as the deglazing liquor) over the bones in 
the stockpot.
Caramelizing the mirepoix used in brown stock gives it a rich flavor and color. The 
mirepoix may be caramelized along with the bones in the oven or it may be caramelized 
using the following procedure.
Procedure for Caramelizing Mirepoix
1 add a little of the reserved fat from the roasted bones to the roasting pan after it has been 
deglazed (or use a sautoir large enough to contain all the mirepoix without crowding).
2 Sauté the mirepoix, browning all the vegetables well and evenly without burning.
3 add the caramelized mirepoix to the stockpot.
Almost any tomato product can be used in a brown stock: fresh tomatoes, canned 
whole tomatoes, crushed tomatoes, tomato purée or paste. If using a concentrated 
tomato product such as paste or purée, use approximately half the amount by weight of 
fresh or canned tomatoes. It is traditional to brown the tomato paste with the mirepoix to 
reduce any acidity and bitterness, although this step is often omitted. When using fresh

Remouillage
Remouillage is a French term for “rewetting” that refers to a second batch of stock made 
by reusing the bones from making your first batch of stock. After draining the original 
stock from the stockpot, add fresh mirepoix, a new sachet and enough water to cover 
the bones and mirepoix, to make a second stock. A remouillage is treated like the origi￾nal stock; allow it to simmer for 4–5 hours before straining. A remouillage is not as clear 
or as flavorful as the original stock, however. It is often used to make glazes or in place 
of water when making stocks.
Fish Stock and Fish Fumet
A fish stock and a fish fumet [foo-MAY] are similar and can be used interchangeably in 
most recipes. Both are clear with a pronounced fish flavor and very light body. A fumet, 
however, is more strongly flavored and aromatic than a fish stock and contains an acidic 
ingredient such as white wine and/or lemon juice.
Only the bones and head of lean fish and crustacean shells are used to make fish 
stock. Oily fish such as mackerel, salmon or tuna are not used because their pronounced 
flavor would overwhelm the stock. The fish bones and shells used to make a fish stock 
or fumet should be washed but never blanched. Blanching removes too much flavor. 
They may be sweated without browning if desired, however. Because of the size and 
structure of fish bones and crustacean shells, stocks and fumets made from them require 
much less cooking time than even a chicken stock; 30–45 minutes is usually sufficient to 
extract full flavor. Mirepoix or other vegetables should be finely chopped so that all of 
their flavors can be extracted during the short cooking time.
The procedure for making a fish stock is very similar to that for making a white stock.

Vegetable Stock
A good vegetable stock should be clear and light-colored. Because it contains no animal 
products, vegetable stock has no gelatin content and little body. A vegetable stock can 
be used instead of a meat-based stock in most recipes. This substitution is useful when 
preparing vegetarian dishes. Vegetable stock is also a lighter, more healthful alternative 
to use when preparing sauces and soups.
Although almost any combination of vegetables can be used for stock making, 
more variety is not always better. Sometimes a vegetable stock made with one or two 
vegetables that complement the finished dish particularly well produces better results 
than a stock made with many vegetables. Strongly flavored vegetables such as aspara￾gus, broccoli and other cruciferous vegetables, spinach and bitter greens should be 
avoided when making an all-purpose vegetable stock. Potatoes and other starchy 
vegetables cloud the stock and should not be used unless clarity is not a concern. 
Vegetables used to make the stock can be roasted to develop caramelization and give 
the stock a darker color.
As with meat or fish stocks, vegetable stock should be started with cold water to 
extract all of the flavor from the ingredients used. Any fat or impurities that rise to the 
surface should be skimmed off. A recipe for basic vegetable stock follows. A recipe for a 
more boldly flavored Rich Brown Vegetable Stock appears on page 269.

Court Bouillon
A court bouillon [bool-yawn] is not actually a stock. However, it is prepared in much the 
same manner as stocks, so we include it here. A court bouillon (French for “short broth”) 
is a flavored liquid, usually water and wine or vinegar, in which vegetables and season￾ings have been simmered to impart their flavors and aromas.
Court bouillon is most commonly used to poach foods such as fish and shellfish. 
Recipes vary depending on the foods to be poached. Although a court bouillon can be 
made in advance and refrigerated for later use, its simplicity lends itself to fresh prepara￾tion whenever needed.

Nage
An aromatic court bouillon is sometimes served as a light sauce or broth with fish or 
shellfish. This sauce or broth accompaniment is known as a nage [nahj], and dishes 
served in this manner are described as à la nage (French for “swimming”). After the fish 
or shellfish is cooked in court bouillon, additional herbs and aromatic vegetables are 
added to the cooking liquid, which is then reduced slightly and strained.
Glaze
A glaze (Fr. glace) is the dramatic reduction and concentration of a stock. One gallon 
(4 liters) of stock produces only 8–16 fluid ounces (240–480 milliliters) of glaze. Meat 
glaze (Fr. glace de viande) is made from brown stock, reduced until it becomes dark and 
syrupy. Poultry glaze (Fr. glace de volaille) is reduced chicken stock, and fish glaze (Fr. 
glace de poisson) is reduced fish stock. Glazes are added to soups or sauces to increase 
and intensify flavors. They are also used as a source of intense flavoring for several of 
the small sauces discussed in the following section.
Procedure for Reducing a Stock to a Glaze
1 Simmer the stock over very low heat. Be careful not to let it burn, and skim it often.
2 as it reduces and the volume decreases, transfer the stock into progressively smaller sauce￾pans. Strain the liquid each time it is transferred into a smaller saucepan.
3 Strain the glaze a final time, cool and refrigerate. a properly made glaze keeps for several 
months under refrigeration.

Commercial Bases
commercially produced flavor (or convenience) 
bases are widely used in food service operations. 
they are powdered or paste flavorings added to 
water to create stocks or, when used in smaller 
amounts, to enhance the flavor of sauces and 
soups. these products are also sold as bouillon 
cubes or granules. although inferior to well-made 
stocks, flavor bases do reduce the labor involved 
in the production of stocks, sauces and soups. 
used properly they also ensure a consistent 
product. Because most bases do not contain 
gelatin, stocks and sauces made from them do 
not benefit from reduction. (Frozen glace de viande
and demi-glace are increasingly available from 
meat and other food service suppliers.)
Bases vary greatly in quality and price. Sodium 
(salt) is the main ingredient in many bases. 
Better bases are made primarily of meat, poultry 
or fish extracts but vegetarian and vegan bases 
are available. to judge the quality of a flavor 
base, prepare it according to package directions 
and compare the flavor to that of a well￾made stock. a flavor base can be improved by 
adding a mirepoix, a standard sachet and a few 
appropriate bones to the mixture, then simmering 
for 1 or 2 hours. It can then be strained, 
stored and used like a regular stock. although 
convenience bases are widely used in the industry, 
it is important to remember that even the best 
base is a poor substitute for a well-made stock.
Nage: Flavor Profiles
aromatic nage lends itself to a variety 
of flavorings customized to the dish in 
which it is being used. adding fragrant 
lime leaves, lemon grass or fresh ginger 
gives it a flavor profile suitable for asian 
fish dishes. Likewise adding a mixture 
of mild dried chiles and cilantro to the 
preparation brings a Latin flair to the 
broth. Whole butter or cream may be 
added to a nage for richness. alternatively 
the used nage (court bouillon) can be 
strained, chilled and clarified with egg 
whites and aromatic vegetables in the 
same manner as a consommé, discussed 
in chapter 12, Soups.
M11_LABE1163_07_SE_C11.indd 236 28/10/23 1:18 PMStockS and SauceS 237
Infusion
An infusion is a light flavorful stock made from dried fruits or vegetables, herbs, spices 
or other ingredients steeped in very hot water. Infusing is similar to the method used to 
make tea or coffee. Perhaps the most well-known culinary infusion is dashi, the tradi￾tional Japanese broth made from dried fish and dried seaweed that is used to make miso 
and other soups (see recipe below). Almost any aromatic ingredient can be steeped in 
water to make an infusion. Umami-rich dried mushrooms, dried shrimp or dried toma￾toes make especially flavorful infusions, as do dried anchovies and the rind of hard aged 
cheese such as Parmesan and Romano.
A well-made infusion has an appealing color and the concentrated flavor of the ingre￾dients used to prepare it. Some infusions, such as saffron infusion, are clear while others, 
like Parmesan cheese infusion, are cloudy. Although most lack the intensity of flavor of 
a traditional meat, fish or vegetable stock, infusions can be used in much the same way 
as stock. Chefs treat infusions as lighter, more healthful alternatives to stock for cooking 
and flavoring foods.

PREPARING SAUCES USING THICKENING 
AND FINISHING TECHNIQUES
With few exceptions, a sauce is a liquid plus thickening agent plus seasonings. Thickening 
agents, usually made with wheat flour, cornstarch, arrowroot or egg yolks, thicken the 
liquids in a sauce so that they will cling to food and provide a rich mouthfeel. Finishing 
techniques are the final steps chefs use to add shine or improve the texture or consis￾tency of a sauce shortly before service. Some cooks may feel that these finishing steps 
are not essential but completing them properly enhances the diners’ experience and 
demonstrates culinary skill.
Any chef can produce fine sauces by learning to do the following:
1 Make good stocks.
2 Use thickening agents properly to achieve the desired texture, flavor 
and appearance.
3 Use seasonings properly to achieve desired flavors.

In the following sections, we first discuss thickening and finishing techniques that 
work with a number of sauces. We then describe classic leading and small sauces in 
more detail as well as introduce and discuss traditional sauces and contemporary sauces. 
We also include and discuss recipes for a variety of common sauces.
Thickening Agents for Sauces
One of the most traditional and commonly used methods for thickening sauces is the 
gelatinization of starches. As discussed in Chapter 10, Principles of Cooking, gelatiniza￾tion is the process by which starch granules absorb moisture when placed in a liquid and 
heated. As the starch granules absorb moisture, the product thickens. Starches used to 
thicken sauces include flour, cornstarch and arrowroot. Gelatinization may sound easy, 
but it takes practice to produce a good sauce that:
	▪ is lump-free
	▪ has a good clean flavor that is not pasty or floury
	▪ has a consistency that coats the back of a spoon (the French call this nappé)
	▪ does not separate or break when the sauce is kept warm for service or reduced
 Roux
Adding a roux [roo] is the principal way of thickening classic sauces. A roux is a com￾bination of equal parts, by weight, of flour and fat, cooked together to form a paste. 
Cooking the flour in fat coats the starch granules with the fat and prevents them from 
lumping together or forming lumps when introduced into a liquid. In large production 
kitchens, large amounts of roux are prepared and held for use as needed. Smaller opera￾tions may make roux as required for each recipe.
There are three types of roux:
	▪ White roux is cooked only briefly and should be removed from the heat as soon 
as it develops a frothy, bubbly appearance. It is used in white sauces, such as 
béchamel, or in dishes where little or no color is desired.
	▪ Blond roux is cooked slightly longer than white roux and should begin to take 
on a little color as the flour caramelizes. It is used in ivory-colored sauces, such 
as velouté, or where a richer flavor is desired.
	▪ Brown roux is cooked until it develops a darker color and a nutty aroma and 
flavor. Brown roux is used in brown sauces and dishes where a dark color is 
desired. It is important to remember that cooking a starch before adding a liquid 
breaks down the starch granules and prevents gelatinization. Therefore, because 
brown roux is cooked longer than white roux, more brown roux is required to 
thicken a given quantity of liquid.
nappé [nap-ay] the consistency of a liquid, 
usually a sauce, that will coat the back of a 
spoon; from the verb naper in French or nap in 
english, meaning to coat a food with sauce
White roux Blond roux Brown roux
M11_LABE1163_07_SE_C11.indd 238 28/10/23 1:18 PMStockS and SauceS 239
Procedure for Preparing Roux
Whether it is white, blond or brown, the procedure for making a roux is the same:
1 using a heavy saucepan to prevent scorching, heat the clarified butter or other fat.
2 add all the flour and stir to form a paste. although all-purpose flour can be used, it is bet￾ter to use cake or pastry flour because they contain a higher percentage of starch. do not 
use high-gluten flour because of its greatly reduced starch content. (Flours are discussed in 
chapter 30, Principles of the Bakeshop.) a gluten-free roux can be made using rice flour in 
place of wheat flour. Sauces made using gluten-free roux may be somewhat grainy.
3 cook the paste over medium heat until the desired color is achieved. Stir the roux often to 
avoid burning. Burnt roux will not thicken a liquid; it will simply add dark specks and an 
undesirable flavor.
The temperature and amount of roux being prepared determine the exact length of 
cooking time. Generally, however, a white roux needs to cook for only a few minutes, 
long enough to minimize the raw flour taste. Blond roux is cooked longer, until the paste 
begins to become a slightly darker color. Brown roux requires a much longer cooking time 
to develop its characteristic color and aroma. A good roux is stiff, not runny or pourable.
Incorporating Roux into a Liquid
There are two ways to incorporate roux into a liquid without causing lumps. (See Figure 11.3.):
1 Cold stock can be added to the hot roux while stirring vigorously with a whisk.
2 Room-temperature roux can be added to a hot stock while stirring vigorously 
with a whisk.
When the roux and the liquid are completely incorporated and the sauce begins to 
boil, the sauce must be cooked for a time to remove any raw flour taste that may remain. 
Most chefs feel a minimum of 20 minutes is necessary.
Using Roux
General guidelines for making and using roux include the following:
	▪ Do not use aluminum pots. The scraping action of the whisk turns light sauces 
gray and imparts a metallic flavor.
	▪ Use sufficiently heavy pots to prevent sauces from scorching or burning during 
extended cooking times.
	▪ Avoid extreme temperatures. Roux should be no colder than room temperature 
when used so that the fat is not fully solidified. Extremely hot roux is dangerous 
and can spatter when combined with a liquid. Stocks should not be ice cold 
when combined with roux; the roux will become very cold, and the solidified 
pieces may be difficult to work out with a whisk.
	▪ Do not overthicken. (See Table 11.3.) Roux does not begin to thicken a sauce 
until the sauce is almost at the boiling point; the thickening action continues for 
several minutes while the sauce simmers. If a sauce is to cook for a long time, it 
will also thicken by reduction.

Variables: the starch content of a flour determines its thickening power. cake flour, being lowest in protein and highest in starch, has more thickening power 
than bread flour, which is high in protein and low in starch. In addition, a dark roux has less thickening power than a lighter one, so more will be needed to 
thicken an equal amount of liquid.
TABLE 11.3
M11_LABE1163_07_SE_C11.indd 239 28/10/23 1:18 PM240 cHaPteR eLeVen
Cornstarch
Cornstarch, a very fine white powder, is a pure starch derived from corn. It is used 
widely as a thickening agent for hot and cold sauces and is used extensively in Asian 
cuisines to thicken sauces and soups. Liquids thickened with cornstarch have a glossy 
sheen that may or may not be desirable.
One unit of cornstarch thickens about twice as much liquid as an equal unit of flour. 
Sauces thickened with cornstarch are less stable than those thickened with roux because 
cornstarch can break down and lose its thickening power after prolonged heating. 
Products thickened with cornstarch should not be reheated. Cornstarch can also break 
down when products thickened with it are frozen. Choose a different thickening method 
when making a sauce that will be frozen.
Cornstarch must be mixed with a cool liquid before it is introduced into a hot one. 
The cool liquid separates the grains of starch and allows them to begin absorbing liquid 
without lumping. A solution of a starch and a cool liquid is a slurry.
The starch slurry may be added to either a hot or cold liquid. If added to a hot liquid, 
it must be stirred continuously during incorporation. Unlike roux, cornstarch begins to 
thicken almost immediately if the liquid is hot. Sauces thickened with cornstarch must be 
cooked gently until the raw starch flavor disappears, usually about 5 minutes.
Arrowroot
Arrowroot, derived from the roots of several tropical plants, is similar in texture, appear￾ance and thickening power to cornstarch and is used in exactly the same manner. 
Arrowroot does not break down as quickly as cornstarch, and it produces a slightly 
clearer finished product although it is much more expensive than cornstarch.
Beurre Manié
Beurre manié [burr mahn-YAY] is a combination of equal amounts, by weight, of flour 
and soft whole butter. Beurre manié is used for quick thickening at the end of the cook￾ing process. Beurre manié adds shine and flavor to the sauce as it melts.

Liaison
Unlike the thickeners already described in this chapter, a liaison [lee-yeh-ZON] does not 
thicken a sauce through gelatinization. A liaison is a mixture of egg yolks and heavy 
cream; it adds richness and smoothness with minimal thickening. Special care must be 
taken to prevent the yolks from coagulating when they are added to a hot liquid because 
this could curdle the sauce.
M11_LABE1163_07_SE_C11.indd 240 28/10/23 1:18 PMStockS and SauceS 241
Procedure for Using a Liaison
1 Whisk together one part egg yolk and three parts whipping cream. combining the yolk with 
cream raises the temperature at which the yolk’s proteins coagulate, making it easier to 
incorporate them into a sauce without lumping or curdling.
2 Temper the egg yolk and cream mixture by slowly adding a small amount of the hot liquid 
while stirring continuously.
3 When enough of the hot liquid has been added to the liaison to warm it thoroughly, begin 
adding the warmed liaison to the remaining hot liquid. Be sure to stir the mixture carefully 
to prevent the yolk from overcooking or lumping. Plain egg yolks coagulate at temperatures 
between 149°F and 158°F (65°c and 70°c). Mixing them with cream raises the tempera￾tures at which they coagulate to approximately 180–185°F (82–85°c). temperatures over 
185°F (85°c) will cause the yolks to curdle. Great care must be taken to hold the sauce 
above 135°F (57°c) for food safety and sanitation reasons, yet below 185°F (85°c) to 
prevent curdling.

➋ adding the tempered egg yolk and cream

Emulsification
Sauces can also be thickened by the process of emulsification. Emulsification takes 
place when ingredients that are normally unmixable, such as fat and water, are forced 
into a creamy state through the action of beating, blending, shaking, stirring or whisking. 
The agitation breaks the fat into microscopic droplets that are dispersed in the water. 
Usually an emulsifying agent, such as mustard, milk solids or the lecithin found in egg 
yolks, must be present to aid in the process.
In scientific terms, this is called a fat-in-water emulsion, where the fat (the dispersed 
phase) is dispersed into water (the continuous phase). Cream and milk are examples of 
fat-in-water emulsions created during the process of homogenization. Butter whisked 
into vinegar and egg yolks for hollandaise sauce is another example of a fat-in-water 
emulsion. The microscopic droplets of fat suspended in the liquid give the emulsion its 
creamy, cloudy appearance. (See Figure 11.4.)
The action of stirring or whisking a sauce to incorporate the ingredients produces 
one of three types of emulsion: permanent, semipermanent or temporary. A perma￾nent emulsion, such as that formed when making mayonnaise, will last for several days. 
A semipermanent emulsion will last for a few hours. Hollandaise sauce, discussed on 
page 254, is an example of a semipermanent emulsion. A temporary emulsion lasts very 
briefly and may not contain an emulsifying agent. Instead, vigorous whisking aerates the 
mixture, causing the temporary suspension of liquids. Beurre blanc and beurre rouge 
sauces, discussed on pages 256–257, are examples of temporary emulsions. Additional 
emulsified sauces and dressings, such as aioli, and vinaigrette dressings are discussed in 
detail in Chapter 24, Salads and Salad Dressings.

Troubleshooting for Thickened Sauces
Thickened sauces are used in many recipes in this text and in the professional 
kitchen. Table 11.4 is a troubleshooting chart to be used when problems arise with 
sauce preparation.
Finishing Techniques for Sauces
Several techniques can be used to finish sauces. Among these are reduction, straining and 
monter au beurre. Each of these techniques is briefly described in the following sections.

Reduction
As sauces cook, moisture is released in the form of steam. As steam escapes, the remain￾ing ingredients concentrate, thickening the sauce and strengthening its flavors. This 
 process, known as reduction, is commonly used to thicken sauces because no starches 
or other flavor-altering ingredients are needed. Sauces are often finished by allowing 
them to reduce until the desired consistency is reached.
Straining
Smoothness is an important quality that contributes to the success of most sauces. To 
smooth a sauce, strain it through either a china cap lined with several layers of damp 
cheesecloth or a fine-mesh chinois. As discussed later, often vegetables, herbs, spices 
and other seasonings are added to a sauce for flavor. Straining removes these ingredients 
as well as any lumps of roux or thickener remaining in the sauce.
Monter au Beurre
Monter au beurre [mohn-TAY oh burr] is the process of swirling or whisking whole 
butter into a sauce to impart shine, flavor and richness. Compound or flavored butters, 
discussed later, can be used in place of whole butter to add specific flavors. Monter au 
beurre is widely used to enrich and finish small sauces.
 CLASSIC FRENCH MOTHER SAUCES
In classic French cuisine, sauces that are served warm are divided into two groups: lead￾ing sauces, which are also sometime referred to as grand or mother sauces (Fr. sauce 
mère) and small or compound sauces. The five classic mother sauces are béchamel, 
velouté, espagnole (brown), tomato and hollandaise. Except for hollandaise, a leading 
sauce is rarely served as is; more often leading sauces are used to create the many small 
sauces. These five leading sauces are the foundation for the classic repertoire and can 
be seasoned and garnished to create a wide variety of small or compound sauces. These 
five leading sauces are distinguished principally by the liquids and thickeners used to 
create them. (See Table 11.5.)
Small or compound sauces are grouped into families based on their leading sauce. 
Some small sauces have a variety of uses; others are traditional accompaniments for spe￾cific foods. A small sauce may be named for its ingredients, place of origin or creator. 
Although there are many classic small sauces, we have included only a few of the more 
popular ones following each of the leading sauce recipes. Table 11.6 lists some popular 
uses for the classic sauces discussed in this section.

The Béchamel Family
Among the oldest sauces in the classic repertoire is béchamel. Béchamel [bay-shah-mel] is 
one of two sauces also known as white sauce. Traditionally béchamel was made by add￾ing heavy cream to a thick veal velouté, which is the other sauce known as white sauce 
(and is discussed on page 246). Although some chefs still believe a béchamel should 
contain veal stock, today the sauce is almost always made by thickening scalded milk 
with a white roux and adding seasonings. Béchamel is often used for vegetable, egg and 
gratin dishes. Cheese sauce made from béchamel is often used when making macaroni 
and cheese.
A properly made béchamel is rich, creamy and absolutely smooth with no hint of 
graininess. The flavors of the onion and clove used to season it should be apparent but 
M11_LABE1163_07_SE_C11.indd 244 28/10/23 1:18 PMStockS and SauceS 245
should not overwhelm the sauce’s clean, milky taste. Béchamel sauce should be the 
color of heavy cream and have a deep luster. It should be thick enough to coat foods 
lightly but should not taste like the roux used to thicken it.
When making these cream sauces, it is important to simmer them gently and to 
stir to prevent the mixtures from overheating and sticking to the pan. Cream sauces 
such as béchamel are susceptible to scorching. Scorching takes place when egg or 
milk proteins are overheated then coagulate and stick to the pan before burning. 
Scorching changes the aroma, color and taste of the product. A scorched sauce must 
be discarded.

Small Béchamel Sauces
With a good béchamel, producing the small sauces in its family is quite straightforward. 
The quantities given in the following recipes are appropriate to add to 1 quart (approxi￾mately 1 liter) of béchamel. The final step for each recipe is to season to taste with salt 
and pepper.
CHEESE Add to béchamel 8 ounces (240 grams) grated Cheddar or American 
cheese, a dash of Worcestershire sauce and 1 tablespoon (15 milliliters) dry mustard.
CREAM SAUCE Add to béchamel 8–12 fluid ounces (240–360 milliliters) scalded 
cream and a few drops of lemon juice.
MORNAY Add to béchamel 4 ounces (120 grams) grated Gruyère and 1 ounce 
(30 grams) grated Parmesan. Thin as desired with scalded cream. Remove the sauce 
from the heat and swirl in 2 ounces (60 grams) whole butter.

color. Garnish the finished sauce with diced crayfish meat.
SOUBISE (MODERN) Sweat 1 pound (480 grams) diced onions in 1 ounce (30 
grams) whole butter without browning. Add béchamel and simmer until the onions 
are fully cooked. Strain through a fine chinois.
The Velouté Family
Velouté [veh-loo-TAY] sauces are made by thickening a white stock or fish stock with 
roux. The white stock can be made from veal or chicken bones. A properly made velouté 
should be rich, smooth and lump-free. If made from chicken or fish stock, it should taste 
of chicken or fish. A velouté made from veal stock should have a more neutral flavor. 
The sauce should be ivory-colored, with a deep luster. It should be thick enough to cling 
to foods without tasting like the roux used to thicken it.
A velouté sauce made from veal or chicken stock is usually used to make one of 
two intermediary sauces—allemande and suprême—from which many small sauces are 
derived. Table 11.7 is a guide to different types of velouté sauces.

IVORY Add to suprême sauce 3 fluid ounces (90 milliliters) glace de volaille.
The Espagnole Family
The mother sauce of the espagnole [ess-spah-NYOL] or brown sauce family is full￾bodied and rich. It is made from a brown stock to which brown roux, mirepoix and 
tomato purée have been added although modern kitchens often prepare a modified 
version of this sauce made without roux. Most often this sauce is used to produce 
demi-glac e [deh-mee glass]. Brown stock is also used to make jus lié [ZHOO lee￾AY]. Demi-glace and jus lié are intermediary sauces used to create the small sauces of 
the espagnole family.
HORSERADISH Add to allemande 4 fluid ounces (120 milliliters) heavy cream and 
1 teaspoon (5 milliliters) dry mustard. Just before service add 2 ounces (60 grams) 
freshly grated horseradish to the warm sauce. The horseradish should not be cooked 
with the sauce.

Demi-Glace
Espagnole sauce can be made into demi-glace, which in turn is used to make the small 
sauces of the espagnole family. Demi-glace is half brown sauce, half brown stock, 
reduced by half. It is usually finished with a small amount of Madeira or sherry. Because 
demi-glace creates a richer, more flavorful base, it produces finer small sauces than those 
made directly from a brown sauce.
A properly made demi-glace is rich, smooth and lump-free. Its prominent roasted fla￾vor comes from the bones used for the brown stock. There should be no taste of roux in 
demi-glace. The caramelized bones and mirepoix as well as the tomato product contrib￾ute to its glossy dark brown, almost chocolate, color. Demi-glace should be thick enough 
to cling to food without being pasty or heavy.

Jus Lié
Jus lié, also known as fond lié, is used like a demi-glace to produce small sauces. Jus 
lié is lighter and easier to make than a demi-glace, however, and it is more common in 
modern kitchens than demi-glace. A properly made jus lié is very rich and smooth. It 
shares many flavor characteristics with demi-glace. Its color should be dark brown and 
glossy from the concentrated gelatin content. Its consistency is somewhat lighter than 
demi-glace, but it should still cling lightly to foods.
Jus lié is made in one of two ways:
1 A rich brown stock is thickened with cornstarch or arrowroot and seasoned.
2 A rich brown stock is simmered and reduced so that it thickens naturally because 
of the concentrated amounts of gelatin and other proteins.
The starch-thickened method is a quick alternative to the long-simmering method. But 
because jus lié made with the starch-thickened method is simply a brown stock thickened 
with cornstarch or arrowroot, it is only as good as the stock with which it was begun. 
Sauces made from reduced stock usually have a better flavor but can be expensive to 
produce because of high ingredient costs and lengthy reduction time. A vegetarian jus lié 
can be made from deeply browned aromatic vegetables that give the sauce a rich flavor.

The Tomato Sauce Family
Classic tomato sauce is made from tomatoes, vegetables, seasonings and white stock 
and thickened with a blond or brown roux. In today’s kitchens, however, most tomato 
sauces are not thickened with roux. Rather they are created from tomatoes, herbs, spices, 
vegetables and other flavoring ingredients simmered together and puréed. They are 
thickened by reduction, not roux.
A gastrique is sometimes added to reduce the acidity of a tomato sauce. To prepare 
a gastrique, caramelize a small amount of sugar, then thin or deglaze with vinegar. This 
mixture is used to finish the tomato sauce.

M11_LABE1163_07_SE_C11.indd 251 28/10/23 1:18 PM252 cHaPteR eLeVen
A properly made tomato sauce is thick, rich and full-flavored. Its texture should be 
grainier than most other classic sauces, but it should still be smooth. The vegetables and 
other seasonings should add flavor, but none should be pronounced. Tomato sauce 
should not be bitter, acidic or overly sweet. It should be deep red and thick enough to 
cling to foods.

Tomato Sauce
Unlike the other mother sauces, there are many variations of tomato sauce depending on the intended 
use. This contemporary tomato sauce retains the bright fresh taste of tomatoes, garlic and fresh basil. 
It is made without a mirepoix, which could be substituted for the onions in this recipe, giving the sauce 
a sweeter flavor. Simmering pork or ham bones with the tomatoes enriches the sauce, but it is optional.

Small Tomato Sauces
The following small sauces are made by adding the listed ingredients to 1 quart (1 liter) 
tomato sauce. The final step for each recipe is to season to taste with salt and pepper.
CREOLE Sauté 6 ounces (180 grams) finely diced onion, 4 ounces (120 grams)

(15 grams) whole butter. Add tomato sauce and then stir in 5 ounces (150 grams) 
cooked ham (julienne) and 5 ounces (150 grams) cooked tongue (julienne). 
Bring to a simmer.
The Hollandaise Family
Hollandaise and the small sauces derived from it are emulsified sauces. Egg yolks, 
which contain large amounts of lecithin, a natural emulsifier, are used to emul￾sify warm butter and a small amount of water, lemon juice or vinegar. When the 
egg yolks are vigorously whipped with the liquid while the warm butter is slowly 
added, the lecithin coats the individual fat droplets and holds them in suspension 
in the liquid.
A properly made hollandaise is smooth, buttery, pale lemon-yellow-colored and very 
rich. It is lump-free and does not exhibit any signs of separation. The buttery flavor 
dominates but does not mask the flavors of the egg, lemon and vinegar. Hollandaise 
sauce should be frothy and light, not heavy like a mayonnaise.
Temperatures and Sanitation Concerns
Temperature plays an important role in the proper production of a hollandaise sauce. 
As the egg yolks and liquid are whisked together, they are cooked over a bain marie 
until they thicken to the consistency of slightly whipped cream. Do not overheat this 
mixture, because even slightly cooked eggs lose their ability to emulsify. For this reason, 
the clarified butter used to make the sauce should be warm but not so hot as to further 
cook the egg yolks. Although hollandaise sauce can be made from whole butter, a more 
stable and consistent product is achieved by using clarified butter. (Clarification of butter 
is described in Chapter 9, Mise en Place.)
Rescuing a Broken Hollandaise
Occasionally a hollandaise will break or separate and appear thin, grainy or even lumpy. 
A sauce breaks when the emulsion has not formed or the emulsified butter, eggs and liq￾uid have separated. This may happen for several reasons: The temperature of the eggs or 
butter may have been too high or too low; the butter may have been added too quickly; 
the egg yolks may have been overcooked; too much butter may have been added or the 
sauce may not have been whipped vigorously enough.
To rescue and re-emulsify broken hollandaise you must first determine whether it is 
too hot or too cold. If it is too hot, allow the sauce to cool. If it is too cold, reheat the 
sauce over a double boiler before attempting to rescue it.
For 1 quart (approximately 1 liter) of broken sauce, place 1 tablespoon (15 milliliters) 
water in a clean stainless steel bowl and slowly beat in the broken sauce. If the problem 
seems to be that the eggs were overcooked or too much butter was added, add a yolk to 
the water before incorporating the broken sauce.
 Safety Alert
Handling Emulsified Butter Sauces
emulsified butter sauces must be held at 
the specific temperatures most conducive 
to bacterial growth: 41–135°F (5–57°c). 
If the sauce is heated above 150°F 
(65°c), the eggs will cook and the sauce 
will break and become grainy. If the sauce 
temperature falls below 45°F (7°c), 
the butter will solidify, making the sauce 
unusable. to minimize the risk of food￾borne illnesses:
	◾ always use clean, sanitized utensils.
	◾ Schedule sauce production as close to 
the time of service as possible. never 
hold hollandaise-based sauces more 
than 1½ hours.
	◾ Make small batches of sauce.
	◾ never mix an old batch of sauce with a 
new one.
Broken hollandaise separates, appearing thin 
and curdled.

cream until stiff. Fold it into the hollandaise just before service. Mousseline sauce is 
also used as a glaçage coating.
TRADITIONAL SAUCES
Not all sauces fit into the classic French system of sauce families. Other sauces made 
with long-used techniques are referred to here as traditional sauces. Four categories of 
traditional sauces are defined as follows: Compound butters that melt when placed on 
top of hot food are made from whole butter flavored with herbs or other seasonings. 
Beurre blanc (French for “white butter”) and beurre rouge (“red butter”) are temporary 
emulsions made by whisking whole butter into a wine reduction. Pan gravy and pan 
sauces made with the fond left from cooking meat, fish or poultry are common in both 
professional and household kitchens throughout North America and France. Broths are 
light sauces derived from the liquid in which the main item was cooked.
Compound Butters
A compound butter is made by incorporating various seasonings into softened whole 
butter. These butters, also known as beurres composés, give flavor and color to small 
sauces or may be used as sauces on their own. For example, a slice of maître d’hôtel 
butter (parsley butter) is often placed on a hot grilled steak or piece of fish at the time of 
service. The butter quickly melts, creating a sauce for the beef or fish.
Butter and flavoring ingredients can be combined with a blender, food processor or 
mixer. Using parchment paper or plastic wrap, the butter is rolled into a cylinder, chilled 
glaçage [glah-SaHGe] browning or glazing a 
food, usually under a salamander or broiler

M11_LABE1163_07_SE_C11.indd 255 28/10/23 1:18 PM256 cHaPteR eLeVen
and sliced as needed. A compound butter can be piped into rosettes and refrigerated 
until firm. Most compound butters keep for 2–3 days in the refrigerator, or they can be 
frozen for longer storage.
Recipes for Compound Butters
For each of the following butters, add the listed ingredients to 1 pound (480 grams) of soft￾ened, unsalted butter. The compound butter should be seasoned with salt and pepper to taste.
BASIL BUTTER Mince 2 ounces (60 grams) fresh basil and 2 ounces (60 grams) 
shallots; add to the butter with 2 teaspoons (10 milliliters) lemon juice.
HERB BUTTER Add to the butter up to 1 cup (240 milliliters) mixed chopped fresh 
herbs such as parsley, dill, chives, tarragon or chervil.
CHILE LIME BUTTER Add to the butter 2 tablespoons (30 milliliters) minced red 
chile pepper, 2 teaspoons (10 milliliters) minced garlic, 1 teaspoon (5 milliliters) grated 
lime zest, 2 teaspoons (10 milliliters) lime juice and ½ teaspoon (2 milliliters) hot sauce.
LOBSTER OR CRAYFISH BUTTER Grind 8 ounces (240 grams) cooked lobster 
or crayfish meat, shells and/or coral with 1 pound (480 grams) butter. Place in 
a saucepan and clarify. Strain the butter through a fine chinois lined with damp 
cheesecloth. Refrigerate, then remove the butterfat when firm.
MAÎTRE D’HÔTEL BUTTER Mix into the butter 4 tablespoons (60 milliliters) 
finely chopped fresh parsley, 3 tablespoons (45 milliliters) lemon juice and a dash of 
white pepper.
RED PEPPER BUTTER Purée 8 ounces (240 grams) roasted, peeled red bell 
peppers until liquid, then add to the butter.
SHALLOT BUTTER Blanch 8 ounces (240 grams) peeled shallots in boiling water. 
Dry and finely dice them and mix with the butter.
Beurre Blanc and Beurre Rouge
Beurre blanc [burr blahnk] and beurre rouge [burr rooge] are emulsified butter sauces 
made without egg yolks. The small amounts of casein (the protein in milk), lecithin and 
other emulsifiers naturally found in butter form an oil-in-water emulsion. Although similar 
to hollandaise in concept, these emulsified butter sauces are not considered classic lead￾ing nor compound sauces. Beurre blanc and beurre rouge are thinner and lighter than 
hollandaise and béarnaise. They should be smooth and slightly thicker than heavy cream.
Beurre blanc and beurre rouge are made from three main ingredients: shallots, white 
(Fr. blanc) wine or red (Fr. rouge) wine and whole butter (not clarified). The shallots 
and wine provide flavor, while the butter becomes the base of the sauce. A good beurre 
blanc or beurre rouge is rich and buttery, with a neutral flavor that responds well to other 
 seasonings and flavorings, thereby lending itself to the addition of herbs, spices and veg￾etable purées to complement the dish with which it is served. The pale color of beurre 
blanc or beurre rouge changes depending on the flavorings added. Beurre blanc or beurre 
rouge should be light and airy yet still liquid, while thick enough to cling to food.
beurre fondu [burr fon-doo] French for 
“melted butter”; often served over steamed 
vegetables such as asparagus or poached 
white fish
beurre noir [burr nWaR] French for “black 
butter”; whole butter cooked until dark brown 
(not black) sometimes flavored with vinegar or 
lemon juice, capers and parsley and served over 
fish, eggs and vegetables
beurre noisette [burr nwah-ZeHt] French for 
“brown butter”; butter cooked until it is a light 
brown color that is flavored and used in much 
the same manner as beurre noir
Procedure for Preparing Beurre Blanc or Beurre Rouge
1 use a nonaluminum pan to prevent discoloring the sauce. do not use a thin-walled or non￾stick pan, as heat is not evenly distributed in a thin-walled pan and a nonstick pan makes it 
difficult for an emulsion to set.
2 over medium heat, reduce the wine, shallots and herbs or other seasonings, if used, until au 
sec (i.e., nearly dry). Some chefs add a small amount of heavy cream at this point and reduce 
the mixture. although not necessary, the added cream helps stabilize the finished sauce.
3 Whisk in cold butter a small amount at a time. the butter should be well chilled, as this 
allows the butterfat, water and milk solids to be gradually incorporated into the sauce as 
the butter melts and the mixture is whisked.
4 When all the butter is incorporated, strain the sauce and hold in a bain marie.
M11_LABE1163_07_SE_C11.indd 256 28/10/23 1:18 PMStockS and SauceS 257
There are some important temperature considerations to keep in mind when mak￾ing beurre blanc or beurre rouge. Do not let the sauce become too hot. At 136°F (58°C) 
some of the emulsifying proteins begin to break down and release the butterfat they 
hold in emulsion. Extended periods at temperatures over 136°F (58°C) will cause the 
sauce to separate. If the sauce separates, it can be corrected by cooling to approximately 
110–120°F (43–49°C) and whisking to reincorporate the butterfat.
If the sauce is allowed to cool below 85°F (30°C), the butterfat will solidify. If the 
sauce is reheated, it will separate into butterfat and water; whisking will not re-emulsify 
it. Cold beurre blanc can be used as a soft, flavored butter, however. Whisk it at room 
temperature until it smooths out to the consistency of mayonnaise.

1 combine the white wine vinegar, white wine, salt, white pepper and shallot in a small saucepan. 
Reduce the mixture until approximately 2 tablespoons (30 milliliters) of liquid remain. If more than 
2 tablespoons of liquid are allowed to remain, the resulting sauce will be too thin. For a thicker 
sauce, reduce the mixture au sec.
2 cut the butter into pieces approximately 1 ounce (30 grams) in weight. over low heat, whisk in the 
butter a few pieces at a time, using the chilled butter to keep the sauce between 100°F and 120°F 
(38°c and 49°c).
3 once all the butter has been incorporated, remove the saucepan from the heat. Strain through a 
chinois and hold the sauce at a temperature between 100°F and 130°F (38°c and 54°c) for service.

Pan Gravy
Pan gravy is aptly named: It is made directly in the pan used to roast the poultry, beef, 
lamb or pork that the gravy will accompany. Pan gravy is still a sauce: a liquid thickened 
with a roux. Pan gravy gains additional flavors from the drippings left in the roasting 
pan; a portion of the fat rendered during the roasting process is used to make the roux. 
This technique is used in the recipe for Roast Turkey with Chestnut Dressing and Giblet 
Gravy (page 466).
A properly made pan gravy should have all the characteristics of any brown sauce. 
However, pan gravy typically has a meatier flavor than simple brown sauce because pan 
gravy is made with pan drippings.

Pan Sauces
Sauces served with sautéed meats, poultry or fish are often made directly in the 
sauté pan in which the dish was cooked. Once the food is sautéed, it is removed 
from the pan and kept warm while the sauce is prepared for immediate service or 
à la minute. Stock, jus lié or other liquid is added to deglaze the pan. Like pan 
gravy, these pan sauces gain flavor from the drippings left in the pan. Unlike pan 
à la minute [al lah MI nute] a dish made to 
order not in advance of service
 Procedure for Preparing Pan Gravy
1 Remove the cooked meat or poultry from the roasting pan.
2 If mirepoix was not added during the roasting process, add it to the pan containing the 
drippings and fat.
3 Place the roasting pan on the stove top and clarify the fat by cooking off any remaining moisture.
4 Pour off the fat, reserving it to make the roux.
5 deglaze the pan using an appropriate stock. the deglazing liquid may be transferred to a 
saucepan for easier handling, or the gravy may be finished directly in the roasting pan.
6 add enough stock or water to the deglazing liquid to yield the desired amount of finished gravy.
7 determine the amount of roux needed to thicken the amount of liquid being used (see 
table 11.3) and prepare the roux in a separate pan, using a portion of the reserved fat.
8 add the roux to the liquid and bring the mixture to a simmer. Simmer until the mirepoix is 
well cooked, the flavor is extracted and the flour taste is cooked out.
9 Strain the gravy and adjust the seasonings.
M11_LABE1163_07_SE_C11.indd 258 28/10/23 1:18 PMStockS and SauceS 259
gravy, pan sauces are usually thickened by reduction, not with a starch. Many chefs 
prefer the intense flavor that comes from reducing liquids in a pan sauce over 
sauces thickened with roux, and because there is no added fat and starch, pan 
sauces usually are lower in calories than other sauces. Pan sauces are discussed in 
Chapter 13, Principles of Meat Cookery.
Broths
Broth, which also appears on menus as a tea, au jus, essence or nage, is a thin, flavorful 
liquid served in a pool beneath the main food. The broth should not be so abundant as 
to turn an entrée into a soup, but it should provide moisture and flavor. The essence, 
broth or nage is often made by simply reducing and straining the liquid in which the 
main food was cooked. Alternatively, a specifically flavored infusion or stock—tomato, 
for example—can be prepared, then clarified like consommé to create a broth or essence 
to accompany an appetizer or entrée.
 VEGETABLE AND FRUIT SAUCES
Many contemporary chefs rely less on classic and traditional sauces and more on flavor￾ful accompaniments called salsas, relishes, green sauces, coulis, vegetable juice 
sauces, foams and flavored oils. Unlike classic sauces, these accompaniments do not 
rely on meat-based stocks and starch thickeners, but rather on fresh vegetables, fruits, 
herbs, juices and intensely flavored oils. Their use in fine dining and professional food 
service is a relatively recent change, but some of these types of sauces first appeared 
in ancient times. The names for these sauces are not codified, as are those in the clas￾sic sauce repertoire. Chefs apply various terms freely, using whatever name best fits 
the dish and the overall menu. Most of these sauces can be prepared more quickly 
than their classic counterparts, and the use of fresh fruits and vegetables enhances the 
healthfulness of the dish. These so-called modern sauces may have a lighter body and 
less fat than classic sauces, but classic principles still apply. They should always have 
a well-balanced flavor, be appropriate in texture and appearance and complement, not

Salsa and Relish
Many people think of salsa (Spanish for “sauce”) as a chunky mixture of raw vegetables 
and chiles eaten with corn chips or ladled over Mexican food. Similarly people might 
think of relish as only a sweet green condiment for hot dogs. But salsas and relishes—
generally, cold coarse or chunky mixtures of herbs, spices, fruits and/or vegetables—can 
be used as sauces for many meat, poultry, fish and shellfish items. They can include 
ingredients such as oranges, pineapple, papaya, black beans, jicama, tomatillos or an 
array of other vegetables.
Although not members of any classic sauce family, salsas, relishes and their close 
cousin cooked chutneys (see page 148) are popular because of their intense fresh fla￾vors, ease of preparation and low fat and calorie content. Salsas and relishes are often a 
riot of colors, textures and flavors, simultaneously cool and hot, spicy and sweet.
Procedure for Preparing a Salsa or Relish
1 cut or chop the ingredients.
2 Precook and chill items as directed in the recipe.
3 toss all ingredients together and refrigerate, allowing the flavors to combine for at least 
30 minutes before service.

Green Sauces
Green sauces are mixtures of fresh herbs used in many cuisines worldwide. Made from 
tender green herbs such as basil, cilantro and parsley, these vibrant sauces are often sea￾soned with garlic and chiles. Contemporary green sauces might also include vegetable 
greens such as arugula, kale and spinach. Citrus juice or vinegar lends acidity and oil 
adds fluidity and mellowness. These sauces are uncooked, which adds to their bright fla￾vor that compliments grilled meats, poultry, fish or vegetables. Or use these herb sauces 
on sandwiches, omelets or steamed vegetables. They work well as a marinade and a 
quick sauce for grains, beans and pasta.
Green sauces should be made with only the freshest herbs and high-quality oils. They 
are served either at room temperature or chilled. Keep these sauces tightly covered to 
prevent oxidation and consume within one or two days. Some like pesto may be frozen 
then thawed before using.
Vibrant Green Sauces
Simple sauces made with an uncooked puree of 
fresh herbs have been prepared around the world 
since ancient Roman times. unlike spices, herbs 
grew quickly and easily in a wide range of climates 
and could be transplanted from place to place as 
people moved about. all that was needed were 
fresh herbs, some oil, an acidic ingredient such 
as vinegar, wine or citrus juice, salt and a mortar 
and pestle for grinding the ingredients into a 
paste. other flavors, such as chile peppers, garlic, 
ground nuts or dairy ingredients, might be added 
depending on what was readily available. Flavor 
profiles evolved alongside regional cuisines and 
specific green sauces became integral to those 
cuisines. Green sauces are now served with grilled 
or roasted meat, fish and vegetables, tossed 
with pasta or potatoes, and served as a dip or 
a salad dressing. Well-known examples include 
chimichurri of argentina (page 277), Basil Pesto 
of southern Italy (page 261), cilantro-mint chutney 
of India, fiery thai green-chile dipping sauce, 
Mexican-style Salsa Verde (page 276), Moroccan￾style chermoula (page 276) and spicy Middle 
eastern zhoug. More recently, green sauces that 
blend fresh herbs into mayonnaise, such as green 
goddess dressing and tartar Sauce (page 768), 
have become popular.
Procedure for Preparing Green Herb Sauces
1 Select, clean and dry herbs for the sauce. Some herbs and vegetable greens can be 
blanched, then dried to preserve their bright green color, if desired.
2 Place the herbs, nuts, if using, and other seasonings into a mortar, blender or bowl of a food 
processor fitted with the metal blade. Pound or chop the mixture into a coarse or smooth 
paste. or combine some of the oil and the herbs then blend the mixture into a smooth paste.
3 add additional flavorings, acidic ingredients and oil as needed.

Basil Pesto Sauce
Taken from the word that means “paste” in Italian, pesto is traditionally made using basil and pine 
nuts pounded by hand with a heavy pestle in a mortar. The nuts bind with the herbs and oil and act as a 
thickener in the sauce. Other herbs and nuts can be substituted; blanched almonds or walnuts work well, 
as does cilantro, mint or parsley.

Coulis
The term coulis most often refers to a sauce made from a purée of vegetables and/or 
fruit that is strained before serving. A vegetable coulis can be served as either a hot or 
a cold accompaniment to other vegetables, starches, meat, poultry, fish or shellfish. It is 
often made from a single vegetable base (popular examples include broccoli, tomatoes 
and sweet red peppers), cooked with flavoring ingredients such as onions, garlic, shal￾lots, herbs and spices and then puréed. An appropriate liquid (stock, water or cream) 
may be added to thin the purée if necessary. Vegetable coulis are often prepared with 
very little fat and served as healthy alternatives to heavier, classic sauces.
Typically, both vegetable and fruit coulis have a texture similar to that of a thin tomato 
sauce, but their textures can range from slightly grainy to almost lumpy, depending on their 
intended use. The flavor and color of a coulis should be that of the main ingredient. The flavors 
of herbs, spices and other flavoring ingredients should complement, not dominate, the coulis.

Foams
Contemporary chefs also create light sauces using whipping siphons to aerate liquids 
and purées. These sauces offer unusual texture and flavors. Frequently the base for such 
sauces, called foams, is thickened with gums, stabilizers and other products more com￾monly found in industrial kitchens.
Aeration takes place when a gas, usually air, is incorporated into a mixture. This is what 
happens, for example, when heavy cream or egg whites are beaten with a wire whisk. Air 
becomes trapped in bubbles that form in the mixture, causing it to expand in volume and 
transform into a foam. In scientific terms, a foam is a gas-in-water emulsion, where the gas 
(the dispersed phase) is dispersed into water (the continuous phase). As with an oil-in￾water emulsion discussed on page 241, a foam requires a stabilizing agent. For example, fat 
in heavy cream coats the air bubbles formed when cream is whipped. The fat helps stabi￾lize the mixture into a semipermanent foam. When egg whites are whipped, egg proteins 
unfold into a network that traps the air into a semipermanent foam. Foams that are stable 
enough to serve on a plated dish require a liquid that will trap air bubbles without bursting.
A variety of modern thickeners such as hydrocolloids or gums alter the texture and 
viscosity of liquids and sauces. Such products, which bind water, help to stabilize sauce 
bases when whipped. The choice of which product to use depends on a number of factors 
including the intended use and serving temperature. Xanthan gum is widely available and 
among the more popular choices for stabilizing foam mixtures because it can be used in hot 
or cold liquids and is freezer stable. Follow manufacturer’s directions when working with 
such thickeners. Because of their power, these ingredients are used in very small quantities.
Light foams, which have a consistency like the froth on a cup of cappuccino, can be 
made by hand using a wire whisk or hand blender but they must be made to order and 
will deflate quickly. Whipping siphons (see page 101) discharge CO2 gas into a liquid. 
The foam made in a whipping siphon holds up well on the plate. The sauce base can 
be kept warm for service and discharged to order. The Wild Mushroom Foam recipe that 
follows calls for a whipping siphon to make a foam sauce. Other techniques for making 
foam sauce appear throughout this text.

 Safety Alert
Handling Flavored Oils
Flavored oils must be stored under 
refrigeration. Raw garlic, fresh herbs or 
other fresh ingredients can become time 
and temperature control for safety (tcS) 
foods when added to oil. Serve them 
within 2 days of preparation.
Flavored Oils
Small amounts of intensely flavored oils can dress or garnish a variety of dishes. Salads, 
soups, vegetable and starch dishes and entrées can be enhanced with a drizzle of color￾ful, appropriately flavored oil. Because such small quantities are used, these oils provide 
flavor and moisture without adding too many calories or much fat.
Unless the flavoring ingredient goes especially well with olive oil (e.g., basil), select 
a high-quality but neutral oil such as peanut, safflower or canola. Although flavoring 
ingredients can be simply steeped in oil for a time, a better way to flavor oil is to crush, 
purée or cook the flavoring ingredients first. Warming the oil before infusing it with dry 
herbs or spices is recommended, as is decanting the oil to remove solids before using. 
A well-prepared flavored oil is clear with the bright color and fresh flavor of the herbs, 
spices or seasonings used to make it.
Chefs also use vinaigrettes, a combination of oil and vinegar, citrus or other 
acidic liquid, as quick light sauces. Vinaigrettes give the illusion of lightness that 
many health-conscious customers are demanding, although the oil in vinaigrettes can 
add to fat and calorie content. Vinaigrettes are discussed in Chapter 24, Salads and 
Salad Dressings.
Procedure for Preparing a Flavored Oil
1 Purée or chop fresh herbs, fruits or vegetables if required. Sweat dry spices or seeds in a 
small amount of oil to form a paste.
2 Place the selected oil and the flavoring ingredients in a jar or other tightly lidded container.
3 allow the mixture to stand at room temperature until sufficient flavor is extracted or warm 
the selected oil and flavoring ingredients gently over low heat then cool to room tempera￾ture. If a mixture is left at room temperature and not heated, it may take from 1 to 24 hours 
to extract the flavor. Shake the jar periodically. do not allow the flavoring ingredients to 
remain in the oil indefinitely, as the flavor may become harsh or bitter.
4 Strain the oil through a chinois lined with a coffee filter, which will trap any sediment from 
the spices or seeds used to flavor the oil.
5 Store the flavored oil in a covered container in the refrigerator.

USING SAUCES
Sauces provide chefs with many ways to build upon the flavors in a dish. This enhances 
a dish’s visual appeal and the diner’s taste experience when eating it. As you will learn 
in your culinary career, many sauces are integral to classic dishes. You cannot make 
Eggs Benedict without hollandaise sauce, for example. The flavor of that hollandaise 
sauce can be adjusted, say with a different citrus juice, Cajun spices or puréed ginger, to 
alter the flavor profile, however. Often, in addition to being called upon to make clas￾sic sauces for classic dishes, you may need to select sauces to accompany foods using 
your training and instinct. For more information on presenting foods using sauce and 
garnishes, see Chapter 36, Plate Presentation. Follow these guidelines to help you in 
this process:
	▪ Select the appropriate sauce based on the cooking method used to prepare 
the dish.
Grilled foods develop a crisp exterior flavored with smoke from the cooking fire. 
Select a sauce that stands up to the robust grilled flavor such as a chunky salsa or 
chimichurri with seared beef.
When serving finger foods to be dipped into a sauce, choose a sauce that is thick 
enough to cling to the food.
	▪ Select the appropriate sauce based on the richness of the main ingredient.
Lean cuts of meat, fish or poultry and many vegetable dishes are enhanced with 
sauces made with butter, cream or oil. Grilled chicken breasts, for example, are 
enhanced with maître d’hôtel butter. The butter melts over the chicken, adding 
moisture and richness to the poultry.
Sauces with some acidity such as those made with capers, tangy fruit, lemon juice 
or wine contrast with fatty cuts of duck, lamb or pork.
	▪ Consider the overall flavor profile of the foods being served.
Amplify flavors by selecting an appropriate sauce. Use lamb stock in a brown 
sauce to accompany braised or roasted lamb, for example.
Use sauce to introduce a global flavor profile. White sauce, for example, takes on 
a Scandinavian flavor profile when fresh dill and white pepper are used to season 
it. When chile peppers, diced tomatoes and cumin are added instead, the white 
sauce takes on a Latin American flavor.
Because of its viscosity, hollandaise sauce clings 
to poached eggs for eggs Benedict.
the acidity in a tangy, berry coulis offsets the 
richness of crisp roasted duck leg, which is also 
garnished with dots of reduced balsamic vinegar.
Poached salmon takes on a Scandinavian flavor 
profile when served with a dill herb cream sauce.
M11_LABE1163_07_SE_C11.indd 267 28/10/23 1:18 PM268 cHaPteR eLeVen
▪ Consider the visual appearance of the dish. 
 Flavored oils made with fresh herbs such as basil, or a vegetable coulis made 
from red peppers add bright color and intense flavor to the foods they accom￾pany. Wine reductions and pan sauces add a sheen to the plate. 
 Use two or more sauces on the same plate to offer contrasting or complimentary 
flavors, but resist the urge to over-embellish a dish. 
 Create visual contrast when choosing a sauce. Consider the contrast of a creamy 
velouté or beurre blanc over rosy-fleshed salmon. The texture of a sauce is also a 
source of visual contrast such as when a chunky tomato sauce is served over a 
pan-fried fish filet.

smoked salmon salad.

Bolognese sauce is named for the city of Bologna in Italy’s culinary heartland. The mirepoix that gives 
this sauce its characteristic flavor is called soffritto in Italian. The length of cooking time and the 
degree to which the mirepoix is cooked alters the taste and texture of the finished sauce. Serve this 
sauce over spaghetti, any wide noodle or large tubular pasta.

 After studying this chapter, 
you will be able to: 
12. 1 describe the different classifications 
of soup 
12. 2 prepare a variety of clear broths 
12. 3 prepare consommés 
12. 4 prepare cream soups 
12. 5 prepare purée soups 
12. 6 prepare bisques and chowders 
12. 7 prepare cold soups 
12. 8 garnish soups appropriately 
12. 9 serve soups appropriately 
 The variety of ingredients, seasonings and garnishes you can use for soups is virtually 
endless, provided you understand the basic procedures for making different kinds 
of soup. Great soups can be made from the finest and most expensive ingredients 
or from leftovers from the previous evening’s dinner service and trimmings from the day’s 
production. Soups are universally recognized as comfort foods in which seasonal ingredients 
can shine. Although fresh ingredients are preferable, the wise use of leftovers means a daily 
soup special can be an economical, practical menu item. 
This chapter applies to soups the skills and knowledge learned in Chapter  11 , Stocks 
and Sauces. In Chapter  11 , we discussed making stocks, thickening liquids, using a liaison 
and skimming impurities, techniques that apply to soup making as well. Here we discuss 
techniques such as clarifying consommés and thickening soups with vegetable purées. This 
chapter also covers guidelines for preparing, garnishing and serving a variety of soups. 
 CLASSIFICATIONS OF SOUP 
 Most soups can be classified by cooking technique and appearance as either clear or 
thick. Clear soups include broths (Fr. bouillon ) made from meat, poultry, game, fish 
or vegetables as well as consommés , which are broths clarified to remove impurities. 
Thick soups include cream soups and purée soups. The most common cream soups
are those made from vegetables cooked in a liquid that is thickened with a starch and 
puréed; cream is then incorporated to add richness and flavor. Purée soups are gener￾ally made from starchy vegetables or legumes. After the main ingredient is simmered in 
a liquid, the mixture—or a portion of it—is puréed. 
 Some soups discussed in this chapter (notably bisques and chowders as well as

A soup’s quality is determined by its flavor, appearance and texture. A good soup 
should be full-flavored, with no off or sour tastes. Flavors from each of the soup’s 
ingredients should blend and complement, with no one flavor overpowering another. 
Consommés should be crystal clear. The vegetables in vegetable soups should be 
brightly colored, not gray. Ingredients added to enhance the soup’s appearance and 
flavor should be attractive and uniform in size and shape. The soup’s texture should be 
very precise. If it is supposed to be smooth, then it should be very smooth and lump￾free. If the soft and crisp textures of certain ingredients are supposed to contrast, the 
soup should not be overcooked, as this causes all the ingredients to become mushy 
and soft.
Garnishing is an important consideration when preparing soups. When applied to 
soups, the word garnish has two meanings. The first is the one more typically associated 
with the word. It refers to foods added to the soup as decoration—for example, a broc￾coli floret floated on a bowl of cream of broccoli soup. The second refers to foods that 
may serve not only as decorations but also as critical components of the final product—
for example, noodles in a bowl of chicken noodle soup. In this context, the noodles are 
not ingredients because they are not used to make the chicken soup. Rather they are 
added to chicken soup to create a different dish. These additional items are still referred 
to as garnishes, however.
BROTHS
Broths are a type of clear soup. Broths may be served as finished items, used as the base 
for other soups or clarified into consommés as discussed on page 284.
The techniques for making broths are identical to those used for making stocks, cov￾ered in Chapter 11, Stocks and Sauces. Like stocks, broths are prepared by simmering 
flavoring ingredients in a liquid for a long time. Broths and stocks differ, however, in 
two ways. First, broths are made with meat instead of just bones. Second, broths (often 
with a garnish) can be served as finished dishes, whereas stocks are generally used as an 
ingredient in the preparation of other items.
Broths are made from meat, poultry, fish or vegetables cooked in a liquid. An espe￾cially full-flavored broth results when a stock and not just water is used as the liquid. 
Cuts of meat from the shank, neck or shoulder result in more flavorful broths, as does 
the flesh of mature poultry. Proper temperature, skimming and straining help produce 
well-flavored, clear broths.
Procedure for Preparing Broths
1 Truss or cut the main ingredient.
2 Brown (caramelize) the meat; brown (caramelize) or sweat the mirepoix or vegetables 
as necessary.
3 place the main ingredient and mirepoix or vegetables in an appropriate stockpot 
and add enough cold water or stock to cover. Add a bouquet garni or sachet d’épices 
if desired.
4 Bring the liquid slowly to a boil; reduce to a simmer and cook, skimming occasionally, until 
the main ingredient is tender and the flavor is fully developed.
5 Carefully strain the broth through a china cap lined with damp cheesecloth; try to disturb 
the flavoring ingredients as little as possible to preserve the broth’s clarity.
6 Cool and store following the procedures for cooling stocks discussed in Chapter 11, Stocks 
and Sauces, or bring to a boil, garnish as desired and hold for service.

Broth-Based Soups
Broths are often used as bases for familiar soups such as vegetable, chicken noodle 
and beef barley. Transforming a broth into a broth-based vegetable soup, for example, 
is quite simple. Although a broth may be served with a vegetable (or meat) garnish, a 
broth-based vegetable soup is a soup in which the vegetables (and meats) are cooked 
directly in the broth, adding flavor, body and texture to the finished product. Any num￾ber of vegetables can be used to make a vegetable soup; it could be a single vegetable 
as in onion soup or a dozen different vegetables as in a hearty minestrone.
When making broth-based vegetable soups, each ingredient must be added at the 
proper time so that all ingredients are cooked when the soup is finished. The ingredients 
must cook long enough to add their flavors and soften sufficiently but not so long that 
they lose their identity and become too soft or mushy. Soups that simmer too long can 
reduce in volume, concentrating seasonings, especially salt. Add additional plain broth to 
adjust the seasonings. Chunks of raw potato or carrot can also be added to a salty broth 
and simmered, then removed, to absorb some of the excess saltiness.
Broth-based vegetable soups made by simmering ingredients directly in the broth are 
generally not as clear as plain broths. But appearance is still important. When cutting 
ingredients for the soup, pay particular attention so that the pieces are uniform and visu￾ally appealing. Small dice, julienne, bâtonnet or paysanne cuts are recommended. Broth 
and broth-based soups are naturally low in calories and fat, so they often make ideal 
healthy menu options.
Procedure for Preparing Broth-Based Vegetable Soups
1 Sweat long-cooking vegetables in butter or fat.
2 Add the appropriate stock or broth and bring to a simmer.
3 Add seasonings, such as bay leaves, dried thyme, crushed peppercorns, parsley stems and 
garlic, in a bouquet garni or sachet, allowing enough time for the seasonings to fully flavor 
the soup.
4 Add additional ingredients according to their cooking times.
5 Simmer the soup to blend all the flavors.
6 If the soup is not going to be served immediately, cool and refrigerate it.
7 Just before service, add any garnishes that were prepared separately or that do not 
require cooking.
Noodle Bowls
In Asian cuisines many hearty noodle soups 
serve as stand-alone meals. A well-prepared 
broth and the type of noodle distinguish 
the best of these one-pot meals. Diners are 
encouraged to season these broths with 
such condiments as chiles, citrus juice, green 
onions, chopped nori and soy or fish sauce. 
Japanese noodle soups may brim with a 
cornucopia of vegetables garnished with thin 
soba noodles made from buckwheat flour or 
thick udon noodles made from wheat flour. 
Tempura-fried shrimp or vegetables are a 
welcome addition. In Vietnam, noodle soups 
are simply called phô [fuh], a word that refers 
to a soup made with beef and rice noodles as 
well as to the noodles themselves. The broth, 
usually flavored with star anise, may be spiked 
by the diner with lime juice, hot chili paste 
and fresh cilantro. Korean kalguksu presents 
fresh knife-cut wheat noodles in a rich broth 
often made from dried fish or other seafood. 
Chinese or Mongolian hot pot is an interactive 
meal centered on a simmering pot of water 
or light broth. Diners plunge pieces of beef, 
seafood, mushrooms, tofu and vegetables into 
the pot, eating them when they are cooked to 
their taste. Any of a variety of Asian noodles 
may be added at the end to make a hearty 
soup richly flavored with any leftover bits of 
food, sliced scallions and condiments.

 CONSOMMÉS
A consommé is a stock or broth that has been clarified to remove impurities so that it is 
crystal clear. Traditionally all clear broths were referred to as consommés. A clear broth 
further refined, using the process we describe in the following material, was referred to 
as a double consommé. The term double consommé is still used occasionally to describe 
any strongly flavored consommé.

M12_LABE1163_07_SE_C12.indd 284 28/10/23 1:21 PMSoupS 285
Well-prepared consommés should be rich in the flavor of the main ingredient. Beef 
and game consommés should be dark in color; consommés made from poultry should 
have a golden to light amber color. All consommés should have substantial body as a 
result of their high gelatin content and should be perfectly clear with no trace of fat. 
Because a consommé is a refined broth, it is absolutely essential that the broth or stock 
used be of the highest quality. Although the clarification process adds some flavor to 
the consommé, the finished consommé will be only as good as the stock or broth from 
which it was made.
Clarifying Consommés
To make a consommé, a stock or broth is clarified. The stock or broth must be cold and 
grease-free before beginning. During clarification, the cold degreased stock or broth is 
combined with a mixture known as a clearmeat or clarification. A clearmeat is a mixture 
of egg whites; ground meat, poultry or fish; mirepoix, herbs and spices; and an acidic 
product, usually tomatoes, lemon juice or wine. (An onion brûlé, also known as an 
oignon brûlé, is also often added to help flavor and color the consommé. See Chapter 9, 
Mise en Place.)
In the next step of clarification, the stock or broth and clearmeat are slowly brought 
to a simmer. As the albumen in the egg whites and meat begins to coagulate at 120°F 
(48°C), it traps impurities suspended in the liquid. As coagulation continues, the albumen￾containing items combine with the other clearmeat ingredients and rise to the surface, 
forming a raft. As the mixture simmers, the raft ingredients release their flavors, further 
enriching the consommé.
After simmering, the consommé is carefully strained through several layers of damp 
cheesecloth to remove any trace of impurities. It is then completely degreased, either by 
cooling and refrigerating, then removing the solidified fat, or by carefully ladling the fat 
from the surface. The result is a rich, flavorful, crystal-clear consommé.
Procedure for Preparing Consommés
1 prepare the clearmeat. Whip the egg whites until frothy. In a suitable stockpot (if available, 
one with a spigot makes it much easier to strain the consommé when it is finished), com￾bine the ground meat, lightly whipped egg whites and other clearmeat ingredients.
2 Add the cold stock or broth and stir to combine with the clearmeat ingredients, onion brûlé 
and sachet d’épices.
3 over medium heat, slowly bring the mixture to a simmer, stirring occasionally. Stop stirring 
once the raft begins to form.
4 As the raft forms, make a hole in its center so that the liquid can bubble through. This 
will allow the raft to cook completely and will extract as much flavor as possible from the 
raft ingredients.
5 Simmer the consommé until full flavor develops, approximately 1 to 1½ hours.
6 Carefully strain the consommé through several layers of damp cheesecloth and 
degrease completely.
7 If the consommé will not be used immediately, it should be cooled and refrigerated, 
following the procedures for cooling stocks discussed in Chapter 11, Stocks and Sauces. 
When the consommé is completely cold, remove any remaining fat that solidifies on 
its surface.
8 If, after reheating the consommé, small dots of fat appear on the surface, remove them by 
blotting with a small piece of paper towel.

Correcting a Poorly Clarified Consommé
A clarification may fail for a variety of reasons. For example, if the consommé is allowed 
to boil or if it is stirred after the raft has formed, a cloudy consommé can result. If the 
consommé is insufficiently clear, a second clarification can be performed using the fol￾lowing procedure. This second clarification should be performed only once, however, 
and only if absolutely necessary, because the eggs remove not only impurities but also 
some of the consommé’s flavor and richness.
1 Thoroughly chill and degrease the consommé.
2 Lightly beat together four egg whites for each gallon (approximately 4 liters) of 
consommé. Stir the whites into the cold degreased consommé.
3 Slowly bring the consommé to a simmer, stirring occasionally. Stop stirring when 
the egg whites begin to coagulate.
4 When the egg whites are completely coagulated, carefully strain the consommé 
through damp cheesecloth.
CREAM SOUPS
Cream soups are enriched soups. (See Table 12.1.) They are generally thickened with 
roux or another starch. (See Table 12.2.) Most cream soups are made by simmering the 
main flavoring ingredient (e.g., broccoli for cream of broccoli soup) in a white stock 
or thin velouté sauce to which seasonings are added. The mixture is then puréed and 
strained. After the consistency has been adjusted, the soup is finished by adding cream. 
In classic cuisine, thin béchamel sauce is often used as the base for cream soups and 
can be substituted for velouté in many cream soup recipes if desired. Properly made 
cream soups should have a silken texture and the thickness of heavy cream. The flavor 
of the soups’ main ingredient should be dominant.
Both firm vegetables (e.g., carrots, celery and squash) and soft or leafy vegetables 
(e.g., spinach, corn, broccoli, mushrooms and asparagus) are used in cream soups. Firm 
vegetables are generally sweated in butter without browning before the liquid is added. 
Soft and leafy vegetables are generally added to the soup after the liquid is brought to a 
boil. Because cream soups are puréed, it is important to cook the flavoring ingredients 
until they are soft and can be passed through a food mill easily.
All cream soups are finished with milk or cream. Milk thins the soup while adding 
richness; the same amount of cream adds much more richness without the same thinning 
effect. Cold milk and cream curdle easily if added directly to a hot or acidic soup.
To prevent curdling:
1 Never add cold milk or cream to hot soup. Bring the milk or cream to a simmer 
before adding it to the soup, or temper the milk or cream by gradually adding 
some hot soup to it and then incorporating the warmed mixture into the rest of 
the soup.
2 Add the milk or cream to the soup just before service, if possible.
3 Do not boil the soup after the milk or cream has been added.
4 Use béchamel or cream sauce instead of milk or cream to finish cream soups; the 
roux or other starch helps prevent curdling.

PURÉE SOUPS
Purée soups are hearty soups made by cooking starchy vegetables or legumes in a stock 
or broth, then puréeing all or a portion of them to thicken the soup. Purée soups are 
similar to cream soups in that they both consist of a main ingredient that is first cooked 
in a liquid, then puréed. The primary difference is that unlike cream soups, which are 
thickened with starch, purée soups generally do not use additional starch for thickening. 
Rather, purée soups depend on the starch content of the main ingredient for thickening. 
Also purée soups are generally coarser than cream soups and are typically not strained 
after puréeing. (See Table  12.1.) When finishing purée soups with cream, follow the 
guidelines discussed for adding cream to cream soups.
Purée soups can be made with dried or fresh legumes such as peas, lentils and beans, 
or with any number of vegetables, including cauliflower, carrots, turnips and potatoes. 
Potato or rice can be used to help thicken vegetable purée soups. Purée pea, bean or 
vegetable soups, when not enriched with dairy products, are good sources of dietary 
fiber and considered healthy alternatives to cream soups.
Procedure for Preparing Purée Soups
1 Sweat the mirepoix in butter or other fat without browning.
2 Add the cooking liquid.
3 Add the main ingredients and a sachet or bouquet garni.
4 Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer and cook until all the ingredients are soft enough to 
purée easily. Remove and discard the sachet or bouquet garni.
5 Reserve a portion of the liquid, if available, to adjust the soup’s consistency. purée the 
rest of the soup by passing it through a food mill or by using a blender, food processor 
or VCM.
6 Add enough of the reserved liquid or hot stock to bring the soup to the desired consistency.
7 Return the soup to a simmer and adjust the seasonings.
8 Add hot cream to the soup if desired.

BISQUES AND CHOWDERS
Traditional bisques are shellfish soups thickened with cooked rice. Today bisques are 
prepared using a combination of cream and purée soup procedures. They are generally 
made from shrimp, lobster or crayfish and are thickened with a roux instead of rice for 
better stability and consistency.
Much of a bisque’s flavor comes from crustacean shells, which are simmered in the 
cooking liquid, puréed (along with the mirepoix), returned to the cooking liquid and 
strained after further cooking. Puréeing the shells and returning them to the soup also 
adds the thickness and grainy texture associated with bisques.
Bisques are enriched with cream, following the procedures for cream soups, and can 
be finished with butter for additional richness. The garnish usually includes pieces of the 
appropriate shellfish.
Although chowders are usually associated with the eastern United States where fish 
and clams are plentiful, they are of French origin. Undoubtedly the word chowder is 
derived from the Breton phrase faire chaudière, which means to make a fish stew in a 
caldron. The procedure was probably brought to Nova Scotia by French settlers and later 
introduced to New England.
Chowders are hearty soups with chunks of the main ingredients (including, virtually 
always, diced potatoes) and garnishes. With some exceptions (notably Manhattan clam chow￾der), chowders contain milk or cream. Although there are thin chowders, most chowders are 
thickened with roux. The procedures for making chowders are similar to those for making 
cream soups except chowders are not puréed and strained before the cream is added.
To add even more richness to bisque, whole butter or a compound butter such as shrimp 
or lobster butter may be added just before the soup is served. Also, if desired, add 3 ounces 
(90 milliliters) sherry to each gallon (approximately 4 liters) of soup just before service.
Procedure for Preparing Bisques
1 Caramelize the mirepoix and main flavoring ingredient in fat.
2 Add a tomato product. Flavor with brandy if desired and deglaze with wine.
3 Add the cooking liquid (stock or velouté sauce).
4 Incorporate roux if needed.
5 Simmer, skimming as needed.
6 Strain the soup, reserving the solids and liquid if desired. (If called for, purée the solids in a 
food mill, blender or food processor and return them to the liquid.) Return to a simmer.
7 Strain the soup through a fine chinois or a china cap lined with damp cheesecloth.
8 Return the soup to a simmer and finish with hot cream.

COLD SOUPS
Cold soups can be as simple as a chilled version of a cream soup or as creative as a 
cold fruit soup blended with yogurt. Cold fruit soups often appear on contemporary 
dessert menus. Cold soups tend to use unique or combination preparation methods. 
They are divided here into two categories: cold soups that require cooking and those 
that do not.
The finished chowder has a creamy, silken 
texture with the rich flavor of clams.

Cooked Cold Soups
Many cold soups are simply a chilled version of a hot soup. For example, consommé 
madrilène and consommé portugaise are prepared hot and served cold. Vichyssoise is 
a cold version of puréed potato-leek soup. When serving a hot soup cold, there are 
several considerations:
	▪ If the soup is to be creamed, add the cream at the last minute. Although curdling 
is not as much of a problem as it is with hot soups, adding the cream at the last 
minute helps extend the soup’s shelf life.
	▪ Cold soups should have a thinner consistency than hot soups. To achieve the 
proper consistency, use less of any starch thickener, or use a higher ratio of 
liquid if the soup is thickened by puréeing. Check and adjust consistency at 
service time.
	▪ Cold dulls the sense of taste, so cold soups require more seasoning than hot 
ones. Taste the soup just before service and adjust the seasonings as needed.
	▪ Always serve cold soups as cold as possible, using chilled bowls.
 Safety Alert
Cooked Cold Soup
Cooked cold soups, especially those made 
with potatoes, beans, dairy products or 
other high-protein foods, require time 
and temperature control for safety (TCS). 
They must be chilled quickly and held 
at or below 41°F (5°C). Because these 
soups will not be reheated for service, 
cross-contamination is also a concern. 
Keep the soup covered and store it above 
any raw meat, poultry or seafood in the 
cooler.

Many cooked cold soups use fruit juice (typically apple, grape or orange) as a base 
and are thickened with cornstarch or arrowroot as well as with puréed fruit. For addi￾tional flavor, wine is sometimes used in the place of a portion of the fruit juice. Cooked 
cold soups may be based on a cooked fruit that is puréed. Cinnamon, ginger and other 
spices that complement fruit are commonly added, as is lemon juice, lime juice or vin￾egar, which add acidity as well as flavor. Buttermilk, crème fraîche, yogurt or sour cream 
can be used as an ingredient or garnish to add richness.

 Uncooked Cold Soups
Some cold soups are not cooked at all. Rather they rely only on puréed fruits or veg￾etables for thickness, body and flavor. Cold stock is sometimes used to adjust the soup’s 
consistency. Dairy products such as cream, sour cream and crème fraîche may also be 
added to enrich and flavor the soup.

Uncooked Cold Soup
Because uncooked cold soups are never 
heated, enzymes and bacteria are not 
destroyed and the soup can spoil quickly. 
Many cold soups also contain dairy 
products, which makes them a time and

GARNISHING SOUPS
Garnishes and toppings can range from a simple sprinkle of chopped parsley on a bowl 
of cream soup to tiny profiteroles stuffed with foie gras adorning a crystal-clear bowl 
of consommé. Some soups are so full of attractive, flavorful and colorful foods that are 
integral parts of the soup (e.g., vegetables and chicken in chicken vegetable soup) that 
no additional garnishes are necessary. In others, the garnish determines the type of soup. 
For example, a beef broth garnished with cooked barley and diced beef becomes beef 
barley soup.
Guidelines for Garnishing Soups
Although some soups (particularly consommés) have traditional garnishes, many soups 
depend on the chef’s imagination and the kitchen’s inventory for the finishing garnish. 
The only rules are as follows:
1 The garnish should be attractive.
2 The meats and vegetables used should be neatly cut into an appropriate and 
uniform shape and size. This is particularly important when garnishing a clear 
soup such as a consommé, as the consommé’s clarity highlights the precise 
(or imprecise) cuts.
3 The garnish’s texture and flavor should complement the soup.
4 Starches and vegetables used as garnishes should be cooked separately, reheated 
and placed in the soup bowl before the hot soup is added. If they are cooked 
in the soup, they may cloud or thicken the soup or alter its flavor, texture and 
seasoning.
5 Garnishes should be cooked just until done; meat and poultry should be tender 
but not falling apart, vegetables should be firm but not mushy, and pasta and rice 
should maintain their identity. These types of garnishes are usually held on the 
side and added to the hot soup at the last minute to prevent overcooking.
 Garnishing Suggestions
Some garnishes are used to add texture, as well as flavor and visual interest, to soups. 
Items such as crunchy croutons or oyster crackers, crispy crumbled bacon on a cream 
soup or diced meat in a clear broth soup add a textural variety that makes the final prod￾uct more appealing.
Clear soups: Any combination of julienne cuts of the same meat, poultry, fish or veg￾etable that provides the dominant flavor in the stock or broth; vegetables (cut uniformly 
into any shape), pasta (flat, small tortellini or tiny ravioli), gnocchi, quenelles, barley, 
spaetzle, white or wild rice, croutons, crepes, tortillas or wontons.
Cream soups, hot or cold: Toasted slivered almonds, sour cream or crème fraîche, 
croutons, grated cheese or baked puff pastry cut-outs; cream vegetable soups are usu￾ally garnished with slices or florets of the main ingredient.
Purée soups: Julienne cuts of poultry or ham, sliced sausage, croutons, grated cheese 
or bacon bits.
Any soup: Finely chopped fresh herbs, snipped chives, edible flowers, parsley 
or watercress.
SERVING SOUP
Soups must be served at the proper consistency, temperature and portion size. Most 
soups can be made ahead of time, cooled down rapidly to ensure food safety and refrig￾erated until needed. When reheated for service, the flavor and consistency of soups may 
need adjusting.
Seasonings for 
Soups
The addition of herbs and spices ensures 
memorable soups. Tender, mild fresh 
herbs such as chervil, chives, cilantro, 
dill and parsley add a bright, clean 
taste to broth, starch and vegetable 
combinations, especially when added 
just before serving. Many thick purée 
soups, when made without milk or cream, 
benefit from a splash of citrus juice or 
vinegar immediately before serving. The 
piney flavors of fresh basil or mint work 
well in hearty vegetable or bean soups 
such as minestrone. pungent herbs such 
as rosemary and thyme or strong spices 
should be used judiciously if at all in 
soups, although a delicate grating of 
nutmeg complements most cream and 
puréed potato soups.
M12_LABE1163_07_SE_C12.indd 296 28/10/23 1:21 PMSoupS 297
Reheating Soups for Service
To preserve freshness and quality, small batches of soup should be reheated as needed 
throughout the meal service. Always taste the soup after reheating and adjust the sea￾sonings as needed. Clear soups are quite easy to reheat because there is little danger 
of scorching. If garnishes are already added to a clear soup, care should be taken not 
to overcook them when reheating the soup. All traces of fat should be removed from a 
consommé’s surface before reheating.
Thick soups present more of a challenge. To increase shelf life and reduce the risk 
of spoilage, cool and refrigerate a thick soup when it is still a base (i.e., before it is fin￾ished with milk or cream). Just before service, carefully reheat the soup base using a 
 heavy-gauge pot over low heat. Because cream and purée soups tend to thicken when 
made in advance and refrigerated, their consistency may need to be adjusted before 
serving. To dilute a portion being reheated, add hot stock, broth, water or milk to the hot 
soup as needed. Stir often to prevent scorching.
If the soup is too thin, additional roux, beurre manié or cornstarch mixed with cool 
stock or water can be used to thicken it. If additional starch is added to thicken the soup, 
it should be used sparingly, and the soup should be simmered a few minutes to cook out 
the starchy flavor. A liaison of egg yolks and heavy cream can be used to thicken cream 
soups when added richness is also desired. Remember, the soup must not boil after the 
liaison is added or it may curdle. Table 12.3 lists common problems that can occur when 
making soups and some solutions.
Temperatures
The rule is simple: Serve hot soup hot and cold soup cold. Hot clear soups should be 
served near boiling; 210°F (99°C) is ideal. Hot cream soups should be served at slightly 
lower temperatures; 190–200°F (88–93°C) is acceptable. Cold soups should be served 
at a temperature of 41°F (5°C) or below and can be presented in special serving pieces 
surrounded by ice.
A cold cream soup served in small glasses as a 
passed hors d’oeuvre.

 Portion Sizes 
 Soup portion sizes vary depending on the meal course. When offered as an hors d’oeuvre 
on trays passed by the service staff, 2–3 fluid ounces (60–90 milliliters) of soup may be 
adequate. Appetizer portions of soup are customarily 6–9 fluid ounces (180–270 milliliters), 
but this can vary. Rich bisque made from costly shellfish, for example, may be served in 
a smaller portion size. When serving soup as a main course, plan on 10–14 fluid ounces 
(300–420 milliliters) per portion, and accompany it with bread, breadsticks, crackers and 
the kind of garnish that will satisfy a hungry guest.

West African–Style Groundnut Soup
Groundnuts, also known a peanuts, are native to western Africa. They give this soup a rich, earthiness 
that has made it a staple of the region for hundreds of years. One secret to this soup is in the layering 
of flavors accomplished by adding aromatics at different times and simmering in multiple stages. The 
meats and vegetables used, the final consistency and the level of spice depend on availability and local 
preference. The chicken in this version can be replaced by beef ribs, lamb, fish or pork and the spice 
level can be increased depending on personal taste. Unsweetened peanut butter may be substituted for 
the raw peanuts, and the ground crayfish, a common umami-rich seasoning of the region, can be omit￾ted. This soup is typically served with steamed rice or potatoes.

meat in the form that best suits your needs and how to store it. We also discuss several 
of the dry-heat, moist-heat and combination cooking methods, introduced in chapter  10 , 
Principles of cooking, and how they can best be used so that a finished meat item is appeal￾ing to both the eye and palate. although each of the cooking methods is illustrated with a 
single beef, veal, lamb or pork recipe, the analysis is intended to apply to all meats. 
in chapters  14 – 17 , you will learn about the specific cuts of beef, veal, lamb and pork typi￾cally used in food service operations, as well as some basic butchering procedures. recipes 
using these cuts and applying the various cooking methods are included at the end of each 
of those chapters.
 MUSCLE COMPOSITION OF MEATS 
 The carcasses of cattle, sheep, hogs and furred game animals consist mainly of edible 
lean muscular tissue, fat, connective tissue and bones. Carcasses are divided into large 
cuts called primals . Primal cuts are rarely cooked. They are usually reduced to subprimal 
cuts , which are cooked as is or used to produce fabricated cuts . For example, the beef 
primal known as a short loin is divided into subprimals, including the strip loin. The strip 
loin can be fabricated into other cuts, including New York steaks. The primals, subpri￾mals and fabricated cuts of beef, veal, lamb and pork are discussed in Chapters  14 – 17 , 
respectively; game is discussed in Chapter  19 , Game.
 Muscle tissue gives meat its characteristic appearance; the amount of connective tis￾sue determines the meat’s tenderness. Muscle tissue is approximately 72 percent water, 
20 percent protein, 7 percent fat and 1 percent minerals. The protein myoglobin , found 
in muscle tissue, gives meat its color, darker in beef than in pork and veal, in older ani￾mals and in active muscles. Meat shrinks during cooking as water evaporates and fats 
melt. Proper cooking helps prevent excessive shrinkage , which can cause the loss of 
finished weight and irregularly shaped meats after cooking. 
 A single muscle is composed of many bundles of muscle cells or fibers held together 
by connective tissue. (See Figures  13. 1 and 13. 2 .) The thickness of the muscle cells, the 
size of the cell bundles and the connective tissues holding them together form the grain
of the meat and determine the meat’s texture. If the fiber bundles are small, the meat will 
have a fine grain and texture. Grain also refers to the direction in which the muscle fibers

 grain refers to the direction in which bundles 
of muscle fibers run in a piece of meat. these 
fibers appear as parallel lines within the meat. 
cutting against the grain means to cut the 
meat perpendicular to the length of the lines of 
bundles, which makes the meat more tender by 
shortening the muscle fibers.

travel. When an animal fattens, some of the water and proteins in the lean muscle tissue 
are replaced with fat, which appears as marbling. Marbling adds tenderness and flavor 
to meat and is a principal factor in determining meat quality. A different type of fat builds 
up in layers between the animal’s hide and muscles. This subcutaneous fat is generally 
removed during butchering and fabrication.
Connective tissue binds long muscle cells into bundles. It surrounds the muscle as a 
membrane and also appears as the tendons and ligaments that attach the muscles to the 
bone. Most connective tissue consists of either collagen or elastin. When cooked using 
moist heat, collagen becomes more tender and breaks down into gelatin and water. 
Elastin does not break down under normal cooking conditions. Because elastin remains 
stringy and tough, tendons and ligaments should be trimmed away before meat is cooked.
Connective tissue develops primarily in the frequently used muscles. Therefore cuts 
of meat from the shoulder (the chuck), which the animal uses constantly, tend to be 
tougher than those from the back (the loin), which are used less frequently. As an animal 
ages, the collagen present within the muscles becomes more resistant to breaking down 
through moist-heat cooking, so the meat of an older animal tends to be tougher than that 
of a younger one. Generally the tougher the meat, the more flavorful it is, however.
The way that meat is fabricated also affects its tenderness. Cutting raw meat against 
the grain, pounding thinly sliced raw meat or grinding raw meat before cooking tenderizes 
tougher cuts. Butchering techniques can maximize the usability of primal cuts.
MEAT INSPECTION AND GRADING PRACTICES
All meat produced for public consumption in the United States is subject to United States 
Department of Agriculture (USDA) inspection. Inspections ensure that products are 
processed under strict sanitary guidelines and are wholesome and fit for human con￾sumption. Inspections do not indicate a meat’s quality or tenderness, however. Whole 
carcasses of beef, pork, lamb and veal are labeled with a round stamp identifying the 
slaughterhouse. (See Figure 13.3.) The stamp shown in Figure 13.4 is used for fabricated 
or processed meats and is found on either the product or its packaging.
USDA grading provides a voluntary, uniform system by which producers, distributors 
and consumers can compare the quality and price of meats. There are two parts to the 
USDA grading system: quality grades and yield grades.
Quality grades, established in 1927, are a guide to the eating qualities of meat: its 
tenderness, juiciness and flavor. Based on an animal’s age and the meat’s color, texture 
and degree of marbling, the USDA quality grades, listed from highest quality to lowest, 
are as follows:
	▪ Beef: USDA Prime, Choice, Select, Standard, Commercial, Utility, Cutter and 
Canner
	▪ Veal: USDA Prime, Choice, Good, Standard, Utility
	▪ Lamb: USDA Prime, Choice, Good, Utility
	▪ Pork: USDA No. 1, No. 2, No. 3, Utility
marbling whitish streaks of inter- and 
intramuscular fat
collagen a protein found in connective tissue; 
it is converted into gelatin when cooked 
with moisture
elastin a protein found in connective tissues, 
particularly ligaments and tendons; it often 
appears as the white or silver covering on meats 
known as silverskin
subcutaneous fat also known as exterior fat; 
the fat layer between the hide and muscles
fabricate to cut a larger portion of raw meat 
(e.g., a primal or subprimal), poultry or fish

Domestication of 
Animals
early humans were hunter-gatherers, 
dependent on what their immediate 
environment offered for food. as 
“opportunistic” meat eaters, they ate 
meat when they could obtain it.
anthropologists believe that the 
cultivation of grains and the birth of 
agriculture, which took place sometime 
around 9000 Bce, led directly to the 
domestication of animals. Wild sheep 
and goats were attracted to the fields 
of grain, and wild dogs and pigs to the 
garbage heaps of the new communities. 
rather than allow these animals to 
interfere with food production, people 
tamed them, thus providing a steadier 
supply of meat. the first animals to be 
domesticated were most likely sheep, 
soon followed by goats. these animals—
ruminants—can digest cellulose (humans 
cannot), so they could feed on stalks 
instead of valuable grains. Dogs and pigs, 
which prefer the same foods as humans, 
were tamed later, once there were more 
certain food supplies. cattle were the 
most recently domesticated food animal, 
probably coming under control between 
6100 and 5800 Bce.

USDA Prime meats are produced in limited quantities for use in the finest restaurants, 
hotels and gourmet markets. They are well marbled and have thick coverings of firm fat. 
(See Figure 13.5.) USDA Choice meat is the most commonly used grade in quality food 
service operations and retail markets. Choice meat is well marbled (but with less fat than 
Prime) and produces a tender and juicy product.
Although lacking the flavor and tenderness of the higher grades, beef graded USDA 
Select or USDA Standard, and lamb and veal graded USDA Good, are also used in food 
service operations and retail outlets. The term “no roll” refers to beef that has not been 
grade-stamped (rolled) by a USDA inspector. Much of the beef sold in the United States 
is no roll but would have been USDA Select if graded. The lower grades of beef, lamb 
and veal are usually used for processed, ground or manufactured items such as meat pat￾ties or canned meat products.
Figure 13.6 illustrates the three quality grades in a cut of beef. Note the moderately 
abundant marbling in the Prime New York strip shown on the bottom compared to only 
slight marbling in the Choice strip in the center.
Yield grades, established in 1965, measure the amount of usable meat (as opposed 
to fat and bones) on a carcass and provide a uniform method of identifying cutability 
differences among carcasses. Yield grades apply only to beef and lamb and appear in a 
shield similar to that used for the quality grade stamp. The shields are numbered from 
1 to 5, with number 1 representing the greatest yield and number 5 the smallest. (See 
Figure 13.7.) Beef and lamb can be graded for quality or yield or both.
Grading is a voluntary program. Many processors, purveyors and retailers (especially 
pork and veal producers) develop and use their own labeling systems to indicate quality. 
These private systems do not necessarily apply the USDA’s standards. In fact, some pork 
inspection programs apply more stringent quality standards.
 AGING MEATS
When animals are slaughtered, their muscles are soft and flabby. Within 6–24 hours, 
rigor mortis sets in, causing the muscles to contract and stiffen. Rigor mortis begins to 
disappear within 48–72 hours under refrigerated conditions. All meats should be allowed 
to rest, or age, long enough for rigor mortis to disappear completely. Meats that have not 
been aged long enough for rigor mortis to dissipate, or that have been frozen during this 
period, are known as “green meats.” They are very tough and flavorless when cooked.
Typically initial aging takes place while the meat is being transported from the slaugh￾terhouse to the supplier or food service operation. As meat continues to rest, natural 
enzymes begin to break down the muscle into more tender meat. Beef and lamb are 
sometimes aged for longer periods to increase their tenderness and flavor characteristics. 
Pork is not aged further because its high fat content turns rancid easily. Veal is not aged 
as it does not have enough fat to protect it during an extended aging period.
Wet Aging
Most preportioned or precut meats are packaged and shipped in vacuum-sealed plastic 
packages (sometimes referred to generically by the manufacturer’s trade name, Cryovac). 
Wet aging is the process of storing vacuum-packaged meats under refrigeration for up to 
6 weeks. This allows the natural enzymes and microorganisms enough time 
to break down connective tissue, which tenderizes and flavors the meat. 
As this chemical process takes place, the meat develops an unpleasant 
odor that is released when the package is opened; the odor dis￾sipates in a few minutes. If the odor persists, rinse the meat, 
dry it with clean paper towels and let it rest, refrigerated. 
Discard if the meat is discolored and retains its odor 
after 30 minutes. Exercise great care when wet aging 
meats to prevent spoilage. Of all types of meat, beef 
can be wet aged for the longest period—6 weeks. Other 
meats must be consumed sooner. The shelf life for vacuum￾sealed refrigerated pork is approximately 3 weeks.
vacuum packaging a food preservation method 
in which fresh or cooked food is placed in an 
airtight container (usually plastic). Virtually all 
air is removed from the container through a 
vacuum process before it is sealed.
M13_LABE1163_07_SE_C13.indd 320 30/10/23 11:37 AMPrinciPles of Meat cookery 321
Dry Aging
Dry aging is the process of storing fresh meats in an environment of controlled tempera￾ture, humidity and air flow for up to 6 weeks. This allows enzymes and microorganisms 
to break down connective tissues. Dry aging is actually the beginning of the natural 
decomposition process. Dry-aged meats can lose from 5 to 20 percent of their weight 
through moisture evaporation. They can also develop mold, which adds flavor but must 
be trimmed off later. Moisture loss combined with the need for additional trimming can 
substantially increase the cost of serving dry-aged meats. Dry-aged meats are prized for 
their rich beefy flavor, however. They are generally available only through smaller dis￾tributors and specialty butchers.
PURCHASING MEATS
Several factors determine the cuts of meat your food service operation should use:
	▪ Cooking Method: The menu identifies the types of cooking methods used. If 
meats are going to be broiled, grilled, roasted, sautéed or fried, more expensive 
tender cuts should be used. If they are going to be stewed or braised, flavorful 
cuts, which are less costly but have more connective tissue, can be used.
	▪ Menu price: Cost constraints determined by your market may prevent an 
operation from using the best-quality meats available. Generally the more tender 
the meat, the more expensive it is. But the most expensive cuts are not always 
the best choice for a particular cooking method. For example, a beef tenderloin 
is one of the most expensive cuts of beef. Although excellent grilled, it does not 
produce a better braised dish than the tougher, fattier brisket.
	▪ Quality: Often, several different cuts or grades of meat can be used for a specific 
dish. Each food service operation should develop its own quality specifications. 
Be mindful, however, of serving only the grade specified on a menu (e.g., if the 
menu says you are serving USDA Prime beef tenderloin, you are obligated to 
serve only Prime grade beef).
	▪ Portion size: Meat portion sizes refer to weight before cooking and affect menu 
costs and food waste. Select the portion size required to create a satisfying dish 
at the necessary price point. To reduce waste and menu price, consider offering 
different portion sizes of the same cut of meat, such as an 8-ounce and a 11-ounce 
portion of beef tenderloin. This satisfies a range of customer preferences.
Once you have identified the cuts of meat your operation needs, you must determine 
the forms in which these cuts will be bought. Meats are purchased in a variety of forms: 
as large as an entire carcass that must be further fabricated in-house or as small as an 
individual cut (known as portion control or P.C.) that is ready to cook and serve. 
Consider the following when deciding how to purchase meats:
Employee skills: Do your employees have the skills necessary to reduce large pieces 
of meat to the desired cuts?
Menu: Can you use the variety of bones, meat and trimmings that result from 
fabricating large cuts into individual portions?
Storage: Do you have ample refrigeration and freezer space so that you can be 
flexible in the way you purchase your meats?
Cost: Considering labor costs and trim usage, is it more economical to buy larger 
cuts of meat or pre-portioned units?
IMPS/NAMP
The USDA publishes Institutional Meat Purchase Specifications (IMPS) describing prod￾ucts customarily purchased in the food service industry. IMPS identifications are illustrated 
and described in The Meat Buyers Guide, published by the National Association of Meat 
Purveyors (NAMP). The IMPS/NAMP system is a widely accepted and useful tool in 
Dry-aged beef short loin
M13_LABE1163_07_SE_C13.indd 321 30/10/23 11:37 AM322 cHaPter tHirteen
preventing miscommunications between purchasers and purveyors. Meats are indexed 
by a numerical system: Beef cuts are designated by the 100 series, lamb by the 200 
series, veal by the 300 series, pork by the 400 series and portion cuts by the 1000 series. 
Commonly used cuts of beef, veal, lamb and pork and their IMPS numbers, as well as 
applicable cooking methods and serving suggestions, are discussed in Chapters 14–17.
Grass-Fed Meats
Most domestic cattle, sheep and hogs are fed grains while they are confined in large pens 
known as feedlots before slaughter. This practice results in meat that has a milder flavor 
and higher fat content than the meat of purely grass-fed animals. Meat from grass-fed 
ruminants, however, is high in the powerful antioxidant conjugated linoleic acid, which 
has been identified as a cancer preventative. Advocates for consuming grass-fed live￾stock also cite the greater environmental impact of animal farming in enclosed feedlots 
as a reason to choose grass-fed meat.
Most meat animals consume grains for some part of their lives. Even cattle that graze 
on grassland are finished on grains for 4–8 months in feedlots before slaughter. The 
Agricultural Marketing Service of the USDA has published voluntary standards for the 
labeling of purely grass-fed meat. The standards state that grass and forage shall be the 
only feed source consumed for the lifetime of the animal except for the milk consumed 
prior to weaning. Free-range, range-fed, pastured and pasture-raised are some of the 
terms used to describe meat raised without grain-based feeds, but none of these terms 
are regulated. Should you be interested in serving grass-fed meats, speak to your suppli￾ers about the source of their livestock.
The meat from grass-fed animals tends to be leaner because the animals are allowed 
to wander over large grazing areas. Consequently meat from grass-fed animals requires 
less cooking time. When broiled or grilled, grass-fed beef is best served rare to medium 
rare because longer cooking toughens and dries out the meat. When cooking meat 
from grass-fed animals, brush it with oil to prevent it from sticking to the pan or grill. 
Marinating tenderizes leaner cuts before dry-heat cooking. Some grass-fed meats may be 
best suited to moist-heat cooking methods.
STORING MEATS
Meat products are highly perishable and require time and temperature control for safety 
(TCS). Temperature control is the most important thing to remember when storing meats. 
Fresh meats should be stored at temperatures between 30°F and 35°F (−1°C and 2°C). 
Vacuum-packed meats should be left in their packaging until they are needed. Under 
proper refrigeration, vacuum-packed meats with unbroken seals have a shelf life of 3–4 
weeks. If the seal is broken, shelf life is reduced to only a few days. Ground meats have 
a shorter shelf life than whole-muscle meats and should be consumed within 1 or 2 days. 
Meats that are not vacuum packed should be wrapped tightly in air-permeable paper. 
Do not wrap meats tightly in plastic wrap, as this creates a good breeding ground for 
bacteria and significantly shortens shelf life. Store meats on trays and away from other 
foods to prevent cross-contamination.
When freezing meats, the faster the better. Slow freezing produces large ice crystals 
that tend to rupture the muscle tissues, allowing water and nutrients to drip out when the 
meat is thawed. Most commercially packaged meats are frozen by blast freezing, which 
quickly cools by blasting −40°F (−40°C) air across the meat. Tabletop and under-counter 
blast freezers are available for any kitchen, but many smaller food service operations 
still use the slower conventional method known as still-air freezing. Still-air freezing 
involves placing meat in a standard freezer at about 0°F (−18°C) until it is frozen.
The ideal temperature for maintaining frozen meat is −50°F (−45°C). Frozen meat 
should not be maintained at any temperature warmer than 0°F (−18°C). Moisture- and

vaporproof packaging help prevent freezer burn. (See Figure 13.8.) The length of frozen 
storage life varies with the species and type of meat. As a general rule, properly handled 
meats can be frozen for 6 months. Frozen meats should be thawed at refrigerator tem￾peratures, not at room temperature or in warm water.
Fresh and frozen beef, lamb, pork, shellfish, poultry and other foods may be irradiated 
to control the presence of microorganisms, such as E. coli and Salmonella, which can 
cause food-borne illnesses. Although the permitted dose of ionizing radiation kills sig￾nificant numbers of insects, pathogenic bacteria and organisms that can cause spoilage, 
it does not make food radioactive or compromise the food’s nutritional value. Nor does 
radiation noticeably alter a food’s flavor, texture or appearance. Radiation of foodstuffs 
is approved by the World Health Organization (WHO), the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention (CDC) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).
The FDA requires that any packaged food subjected to radiation for preservation be 
labeled “treated with radiation” or “treated by irradiation” and display the internationally 
used radura symbol shown in Figure 13.9. Note that irradiated food must still be handled 
and stored with care, as it can become contaminated after irradiation if basic food safely 
rules are not followed.
PREPARING MEATS FOR COOKING
Certain procedures are often applied to meats before cooking to shape, tenderize or 
add flavor and/or moisture. These include brining, marinating and seasoning with rubs. 
Brines, marinades and rubs, which may contain acids and salts that break down cell 
walls and collagen, also help to tenderize meats before cooking. These methods are 
discussed in Chapter 9, Mise en Place. Trussing, barding and larding are described here.
Tying and Trussing
Some meats, especially roasts and whole birds, require tying or trussing before cook￾ing. Tying larger roasts with butcher’s twine holds loose pieces of meat together during 
cooking and ensures that the meat retains its shape. (Meat suppliers will sell large cuts of 
meat such as oven-ready rib roast wrapped in netting, which serves the same purpose as 
freezer burn the surface dehydration and 
discoloration of food that results from moisture 
loss at below-freezing temperatures

butcher’s twine.) Trussing involves using butcher’s twine to tie up the legs and wings 
of poultry. Poultry is often trussed to protect the more delicate white breast meat during 
cooking. Tying and trussing techniques are discussed along with specific cuts and types 
of meat and poultry in Chapters 14–18.
Barding
Barding is the process of covering the surface of meat or poultry with thin slices of 
pork fatback and tying them in place with butcher’s twine. Barded meat or poultry is 
usually roasted. As the item cooks, the fatback continuously bastes it, adding flavor and 
moisture. A drawback to barding is that the fatback prevents the meat or poultry from 
developing the crusty exterior associated with roasting.
Larding
Larding is the process of inserting small strips of pork fat into meat with a lard￾ing needle. Larded meat is usually cooked by braising. During cooking, the added 
fat contributes moisture and flavor. Although once popular, larding is rarely used 
today because advances in selective breeding now produce consistently tender, well￾marbled meat.
 DRY-HEAT COOKING METHODS FOR MEATS
In Chapter 10, Principles of Cooking, you learned the basic cooking methods of broiling, 
grilling, roasting, sautéing, pan-frying, deep-frying, poaching, simmering, braising, stew￾ing and cooking sous vide. In Chapters 14–17, you will learn more about applying these 
techniques to beef, veal, lamb and pork. In this chapter we examine these methods in 
relation to meat cookery in general.
Dry-heat cooking methods subject food directly to the heat of a flame (broiling and 
grilling), hot air (roasting) or heated fat (sautéing and pan-frying). These cooking meth￾ods firm proteins without breaking down connective tissue. They are not recommended 
for tougher cuts or cuts that are high in connective tissue.
Broiling and Grilling
The broiling or grilling process adds flavor by caramelizing the exterior of the meat dur￾ing cooking; additional flavors are added from the seasonings used. The broiler or grill 
should be hot enough to brown the exterior of the meat, while keeping the interior juicy. 
The grill should leave attractive crosshatch marks on the meat’s surface.
Only the most tender cuts, such as those from the loin or rib, should be broiled or 
grilled because direct heat does not tenderize. Because fat adds flavor as the meat cooks, 
choose well-marbled meat with some external fat. Too much fat, however, will cause 
the broiler or grill to flare up, which can burn or discolor the meat and add objection￾able flavors. Connective tissue toughens when meat is broiled or grilled, so trim away as 
much of it as possible.
Seasoning Meats to Broil or Grill
Meats that have not been marinated should be well seasoned with salt and pepper 
just before being placed on the broiler or grill. If they are preseasoned and allowed to 
rest, the salt will dissolve and draw out moisture, making it difficult to brown the meat 
properly. Some chefs feel so strongly about this that they season broiled or grilled meats 
only after they are cooked. Dry off any meat, especially those that have been mari￾nated, with clean paper towels before broiling or grilling. Pork and veal, which tend to 
dry out when cooked, should be basted with seasoned butter or oil during cooking to 
fatback fresh pork fat from the back of a pig, 
used for barding lean meats and poultry and 
for seasoning vegetables or other dishes

help keep them moist. (Some cuts of pork benefit from a light brining before cooking, 
discussed in Chapter 17, Pork.) Meats can be glazed or basted with barbecue sauce as 
they cook.
Cooking Temperatures for Broiled and Grilled Meats
Red meats should be cooked at sufficiently high temperatures to caramelize their surface, 
making them more attractive and flavorful. At the same time, the broiler or grill cannot 
be too hot, or the meat’s exterior will burn before the interior is cooked.
Because veal and pork are normally cooked to higher internal temperatures than 
beef and lamb, they should be cooked at slightly lower temperatures so that their 
exteriors are not overcooked when their interiors are cooked properly. The exterior of 
white meats, those with a lighter color because they contain less myoglobin in their 
muscles such as pork and veal, should be a deep golden color when properly broiled 
or grilled.
Doneness of Broiled and Grilled Meats
Consumers request and expect meats to be properly cooked to specific degrees of done￾ness. It is the chef’s responsibility to understand and comply with these requests. Meats 
can be cooked very rare (also known as au bleu or blue), rare, medium rare, medium, 
medium well or well done. Figure  13.10 shows the proper color for some of these 
degrees of doneness. Use this guide for red meats cooked by any method.
Larger cuts of meat, such as a châteaubriand or thick chops, are often started on 
the broiler or grill to develop color and flavor and then finished to temperature in the 
oven to ensure complete, even cooking. Broiled and grilled meats that are cooked 
well done tend to be dry. Finishing them in the oven may help preserve some of the 
meat’s moisture.
Broiling or grilling meat to the proper degree of doneness is an art. Larger pieces 
of meat take longer to cook than smaller ones, but how quickly a piece of meat cooks 
is determined by many other factors: the temperature of the broiler or grill, the tem￾perature of the piece of meat when placed on the broiler or grill, the type of meat and 
the thickness of the cut. Because of these variables, timing alone is not a useful tool 
in determining doneness. Grilling is further complicated because often grills may have 
some sections that are hotter than others. To master grilling techniques, it is best to gain 
experience cooking on different pieces of equipment.
The most accurate way to test a meat’s doneness is by checking its inter￾nal temperature with an instant-read thermometer. (See Table 13.1.) For small 
pieces of meat such as steaks or chops, insert the thermometer from the side 
into the center of the meat. Another method of determining doneness of a small 
piece of meat is by pressing the piece of meat with a finger and gauging the 
amount of resistance it yields. Very rare (bleu) meat will offer almost no resis￾tance and feel almost the same as raw meat. Meat cooked rare will feel spongy 
and offer slight resistance to pressure. Meat cooked medium will feel slightly 
firm and springy to the touch. Meat cooked well done will feel quite firm and 
spring back quickly when pressed. Allowing broiled and grilled meats to rest 
for 3–4 minutes before serving helps preserve juiciness. While resting, the sur￾face of the meat cools and the muscle fibers shrink slightly, allowing the juices 
to redistribute themselves.
Accompaniments to Broiled and Grilled Meats
A broiler or grill cannot be deglazed to form the base for a sauce. For this 
reason, compound butters, salsas, vinaigrettes or sauces such as béarnaise are 
often served with broiled or grilled meats. Brown sauces such as bordelaise, 
chasseur, périgueux or brown mushroom sauce also complement many broiled 
or grilled items.
 Safety Alert
Serving Meat
the food safety and inspection service 
of the UsDa recommends the following 
as safe internal temperatures for 
serving various meats. note that these 
temperatures are approximately 10–15°f 
(5–8°c) higher than the temperatures 
generally preferred by chefs and diners. 
Most diners would find the UsDa’s 
recommended 160°f unacceptably 
overcooked for a “medium” steak. 
each chef or meat cook must decide for 
themselves whether it is more important to 
their clientele to cook meat to the UsDa’s 
safety standards or to diners’ requests.

Procedure for Broiling or Grilling Meats
1 Heat the overhead broiler, salamander or grill.
2 Use a wire brush to remove any charred or burnt particles that may be stuck to the broiler 
or grill grate. the grate can be wiped with a lightly oiled towel to remove any remaining 
particles and to help season it.
3 Prepare the item to be broiled or grilled by trimming off any excess fat and connective tissue 
and marinating or seasoning it as desired. the meat may be brushed lightly with oil to help 
protect it and prevent it from sticking to the grate.
4 Place the item in the broiler or on the grill presentation side down. following the method 
introduced in chapter 10, Principles of cooking, rotate the meat 90 degrees to produce the 
attractive crosshatch marks associated with grilling. Use a chef ’s fork or tongs to turn or 
flip the meat without piercing the surface (this prevents valuable juices from escaping).
5 cook the meat to the desired doneness while developing the proper surface color. to do 
so, adjust the position of the meat on the broiler or grill, or adjust the distance between the 
grate and heat source. allow the meat to rest 3–5 minutes before serving.

TABLE 13.1
Roasting
Properly roasted meats should be tender, juicy and evenly cooked to the appropriate 
degree of doneness. They should have a pleasant appearance when whole as well as 
when sliced and plated. Because roasting is a dry-heat cooking method and does not 
tenderize the finished product, meats that are to be roasted should be tender and well 
marbled. Good roasting options are cut from the rib, loin or leg sections.
Seasoning Meats to Roast
Seasonings are especially important with smaller roasts and roasts with little or no fat 
covering. With these roasts, some of the seasonings penetrate the meat while the remain￾der help create the highly seasoned crust associated with a good roast. A large roast with 
heavy fat covering (e.g., a steamship round or prime rib) does not benefit from being 
seasoned on the surface because the seasoning does not penetrate the fat layer, which is 
trimmed away before service.
When practical, excess fat should be trimmed from a roast. Leaving just a thin fat layer 
allows the roast to baste itself while cooking. A lean roast can be barded or larded before 
cooking to add richness and moisture. Lamb legs are sometimes studded with garlic cloves 
by piercing the meat with a paring knife and then pressing slivers of raw garlic into the holes.
A roast is sometimes cooked on a bed of mirepoix, or mirepoix is added to the roast￾ing pan as the roast cooks. The mirepoix raises the roast off the bottom of the roasting 
pan, preventing the bottom from overcooking. This mirepoix, however, does not add 
any flavor to the roast. Rather it combines with the drippings to add flavor to the jus, 
sauce or gravy that is made with the drippings.
Cooking Temperatures for Roasted Meats
Small roasts such as a rack of lamb or a beef tenderloin should be cooked at high tem￾peratures, 375–450°F (190–232°C), so that they develop good color during their short 
cooking times. Traditionally large roasts were started at high temperatures to sear the 
meat and seal in the juices; they were then finished at lower temperatures. Studies have 
shown, however, that searing does not seal in juices and that roasts cooked at constant, 
low temperatures provide a better yield with less shrinkage than roasts that have been 
seared. Temperatures between 275°F and 325°F (135°C and 163°C) are ideal for large 
roasts. These temperatures produce a large, evenly cooked pink center portion.
 Safety Alert
Grill Flare-Ups
fat dripping onto a grill can cause flames to 
flare up and burn foods. Prevent flames by 
trimming excess fat from foods before cooking. 
control the flame by moving the food to 
another section of the grill. the fat should burn 
off the coals within a few seconds. should the 
flare-up become uncontrollable, suppress the 
flame with a lid or sheet tray.
M13_LABE1163_07_SE_C13.indd 327 30/10/23 11:37 AM328 cHaPter tHirteen
Doneness of Roasted Meats
The doneness of small roasts such as a rack of lamb is determined in much the same way 
as broiled or grilled meats. With experience, the chef develops a sense of timing as well 
as a feel for gauging the amount of resistance by touching the meat. These techniques, 
however, are not infallible, especially with large roasts.
Bear in mind that the shape, thickness and weight of a roast affect cooking time. 
A roast with a thinner shape cooks more quickly than a squat thick one even if both 
roasts weigh the same. A long thin 5-pound (2.2-kilogram) tenderloin of beef cooks 
more quickly than a square 5-pound (2.2-kilogram) sirloin roast. A bone-in roast cooks 
more quickly than a boneless roast because bones conduct heat quickly. Also the tem￾perature of the meat before cooking affects cooking time. A piece of meat at room 
temperature before roasting cooks more quickly than a chilled one. Although timing is 
useful as a general guide for determining doneness, there are too many variables for it to 
be relied on exclusively. With this caution in mind, Table 13.2 lists general cooking times 
and the proper finished temperatures for roasted meats.
The best way to determine the doneness of a large roast is to use an instant-read ther￾mometer, as illustrated in Figure 13.11. Insert the thermometer into the center or thickest 
part of the roast and away from any bones.
Carryover Cooking and Resting for Roasted Meats
Cooking does not stop the moment a roast is removed from the oven. Through conduc￾tion, the heat applied to the outside of the roast continues to penetrate, cooking the center 
for several more minutes. The internal temperature of a small roast can rise by as much as 
5–10°F (3–6°C) after being removed from the oven. With a larger roast, such as a 50-pound 
steamship round, it can rise by as much as 25°F (14°C). Remove roasted meats before they 
reach the desired degree of doneness, and allow carryover cooking to complete the cook￾ing process. Remove small (4–15-pound/1.8–6.8-kilogram) roasts from the oven when their 
internal temperature has reached 10–15°F (6–8°C) below the desired final internal tempera￾ture. Remove large (16 or more pounds/7.25 or more kilogram) roasts when their internal 
temperature has reached 15–25°F (8–14°C) below the desired final internal temperature. 
Table 13.2 lists final desired internal temperatures after carryover cooking.

after a food is removed from a heat source; it

As meat cooks, its juices flow toward the center. If the roast is carved immediately 
after it is removed from the oven, its juices will run from the meat, causing it to lose its 
color and become dry. Letting the meat rest, uncovered, before slicing allows carryover 
cooking to take place and allows the juices to redistribute themselves evenly throughout 
the roast so that the flesh retains more juices when carved. Small roasts, such as a rack 
of lamb, need to rest only 10–20 minutes; larger roasts such as a leg of lamb or a sirloin 
roast need to rest an hour and a steamship round of beef may require as much as 2 
hours of resting time. The size, shape and weight of the roast determine the ideal resting 
time as does the temperature in the kitchen. As a rule of thumb, allow small 2-pound 
(1-kilogram) roasts to rest a minimum of 10 minutes. For larger roasts, calculate 3–5 min￾utes of resting time per pound of meat.
Accompaniments to Roasted Meats
Roasts may be served with a sauce based on their natural juices (called au jus), as 
described in the following recipe for Roast Prime Rib of Beef au Jus or with a pan gravy

Carving Roasts
All the efforts that went into selecting and cooking a perfect roast will be wasted if the 
roast is not carved properly. Roasts are always carved against the grain; carving with the 
grain produces long stringy, tough slices. Cutting across the muscle fibers produces a 
more attractive and tender portion. Portions may be cut in a single thick slice, as with 
Roast Prime Rib of Beef, or in many thin slices. The following procedures and photo￾graphs illustrate several different carving methods.
1 Pull back the netting, fold back the thick layer of surface fat or fat cap and season the roast well with 
the salt, pepper and garlic. replace the fat cap and netting; place the roast in an appropriate-sized 
roasting pan. roast at 300–325°f (150–160°c).
2 add the mirepoix to the pan around the roast approximately 45 minutes before the roast is finished 
cooking. continue cooking until the internal temperature reaches 125°f (52°c), approximately 
3–4 hours. carryover cooking will raise the internal temperature of the roast to approximately 
138°f (59°c).
3 remove the roast from the pan and allow it to rest in a warm place for 30 minutes.
4 Drain the excess fat from the roasting pan, reserving the mirepoix and any drippings in the 
roasting pan.
5 caramelize the mirepoix on the stove top; allow the liquids to evaporate, leaving only brown drip￾pings in the pan.
6 Deglaze the pan with the brown stock to create the jus. stir to loosen all the drippings.
7 simmer the jus, reducing it slightly and allowing the mirepoix to release its flavor; season with salt 
and pepper if necessary.
8 strain the jus through a china cap lined with damp cheesecloth. skim any remaining fat from the 
surface with a ladle.
9 remove the netting from the roast. trim and slice the roast as described on page 331 and serve 
with approximately 1–2 ounces (30–60 milliliters) jus per person.

eye muscle. Use a long slicer and completely 
remove the ribeye from the rib bones, being 
careful to stay as close as possible to the bones 
to avoid wasting any meat.
➋ Place the rib on the slicing machine and set 
the machine to the desired thickness. the blade 
will have to be adjusted often because a roast’s 
thickness fluctuates.

Barbecue
Barbecue is a dry-heat cooking method that resembles roasting. The term barbeque has 
various meanings in different parts of the world and is generally used to refer to foods 
that are cooked slowly at relatively low temperatures over a hardwood charcoal or wood 
fire. When food is barbecued, heat from the fire cooks through natural convection while 
smoke flavors the food.
In traditional barbecue, meats are cooked directly over the glowing embers of a wood 
fire in a partially covered pit. Other types of equipment such as smoker ovens may 
be used to prepare barbecue, however. Some smoker ovens contain two chambers, one 
for a wood fire and one for the meat. In these two-chambered smoker ovens, the meat 
cooks through indirect convection while smoke flavors it. Single-chamber smoker ovens 
heated with gas or electricity are common in restaurant kitchens. A small compartment 
with a heating element within the oven holds wood chips, which burn to release smoke.
Tougher cuts of well-marbled beef and pork are ideal for traditional barbecue because 
the long slow cooking tenderizes their connective tissues. Well-marbled cuts with ample 
fat such as beef brisket, beef ribs, pork shoulder and pork ribs produce moist finished 
products. Poultry and sausages may also be barbecued. Cooking hamburgers and hot 
dogs on a grill over a gas or charcoal fire uses the technique of grilling, not barbecuing.
Seasoning Meats to Barbecue
Seasoning is done in stages with wet or dry rubs, marinades, injections and mops. 
Often a spice mixture or rub is massaged into the meat, which then sits overnight before 
cooking. The mixture may be made from dry spices, seasonings and sugar (dry rub) or 
dry spices and seasonings blended with honey, chopped chiles, garlic and other ingre￾dients into a wet paste (wet rub). Precise flavor combinations are often closely guarded 
secrets of experienced barbecue cooks known as pitmasters. Meats may be marinated or 
injected with seasoning solutions or brine before smoking. During cooking, a vinegary 
basting liquid called a mop may be applied to enhance flavor. The liquid also helps 
smoke adhere to the surface of the meat as it cooks.
Cooking Temperatures for Barbecue
Cooking temperatures for barbecue depend on the meat and type of equipment. When 
cooking over the indirect heat of a wood fire, prepare the fire and allow the wood to 
burn until the flames subside and only glowing embers remain. Maintain embers by 
feeding the fire with wood to keep the cooking temperature between 200°F (93°C) and 
325°F (162°C) depending on the wood and type of equipment being used and the meat 
being cooked. For cooking in a smoker oven, preheat to the desired temperature, which 
is usually between 225°F (107°C) and 250°F (120°C).
Doneness of Barbecued Meats
Doneness is not determined by internal temperature, although meats must reach safe 
food temperatures, but by tenderness and feel. The finished meat should have a uniform 
exterior color from the slow cooking, the smoke and the rub mixture. The meat should 
fall off the bone and be moist and tender enough to cut with a fork or to be torn and 
shredded. When cut, barbecued meats have a noticeable pink edge called a smoke ring
that is caused by a reaction between meat proteins and chemicals in the smoke. Properly 
cooked barbecued meat should have a pronounced and pleasant smoke flavor.
Accompaniments to Barbecued Meats
Barbecued meats may be served plain or with any number of traditional barbecue 
sauces depending on the regional style of the barbecue. Tart, vinegary or sweet accom￾paniments such as coleslaw, pickles or pickled vegetables complement barbecue. 
Mashed white or sweet potatoes and white bread may be served to absorb the meat 
juices and sauce.

Barbecue Basics
Barbecue is many techniques and many 
flavors; it is a noun, a verb and an adjective. it 
is entertainment, a party, a competition and 
fellowship. Barbecue (BBQ, Bar-B-Que or simply 
Que) is the history of a region and its people 
reflected on a plate.
the word springs from barbacoa, the 
spanish term for cooking meat in a pit dug 
into the ground and filled with logs burned 
down to charcoal, a technique observed in the 
caribbean islands by early explorers. smoke 
served as both a preservative and a tenderizer. 
along the U.s. atlantic coast, early settlers 
cooked venison and turkey with this technique. 
spanish explorers brought pigs to the new 
World and native americans introduced those 
pigs to the smoky pits.
Barbecue is not grilling, which is a high￾temperature process, nor is it merely outdoor 
cooking. true barbecue is a slow process, 
requiring many hours of low temperature heat 
and smoke to tenderize tough cuts or whole 
carcasses. a world of nuances are created by 
regional preferences based on meat, wood 
and finishing:
Meat: Pork and beef are the most common 
meats for barbecue, but mutton, goat and 
chicken are also used. the preferred meat 
depends on availability, so the deep south 
focuses on pigs while texas prefers beef, 
especially the tougher cuts such as brisket. 
sausage is part of barbecue tradition in 
locales settled by Germans and eastern 
europeans, where smoked sausages 
were common.
Wood: Barbecue requires smoke and 
smoke arises from wood. real barbecue 
is never produced over gas or electric 
grills. Hardwood charcoal and embers are 
required for the long, slow burn necessary to 
tenderize and flavor tougher cuts of meat. 
the preferred wood again traditionally 
depends on availability—pecan in 
Mississippi, hickory in tennessee, fruitwoods 
and oak throughout the southeast, 
mesquite in the southwest. conifers (pine, 
fir, cedar) should never be used, nor should 
old lumber, moldy wood or green wood. 
some pitmasters use whole logs, but this 
requires great skill as the logs burn at higher 
temperatures. More commonly, logs are 
preburned into embers that are added 
to the pit as needed to maintain the 
correct temperature.
Finishing: four general styles of sauces are 
found in authentic barbecue. the oldest 
and simplest is vinegar and pepper. it is still 
popular in parts of the carolinas, Virginia, 
Georgia and kentucky, generally where scots 
settled. Mustard-based sauces originated 
in south carolina, developed by German 
immigrants of the early 1700s. this style is the 
most distinctly regional, known worldwide as 
south carolina upcountry barbecue.
light tomato sauce is a sweetened tomato 
ketchup–enhanced version of the vinegar￾pepper sauce. it became popular in tennessee 
(Memphis) and north carolina beginning 
in the early 1900s. More recently, a heavy 
tomato sauce developed in western and 
Midwestern areas and has been widely 
promoted by commercial manufacturers. it 
is thick and sweet; even spicy-hot versions 
have an underlying sweetness. Unfortunately, 
commercially bottled tomato sauces now 
represent “barbecue” for those who know 
little about american barbecue traditions.
other regional styles of sauce exist, such as 
the white sauce of northwest alabama made 
with sour cream, and the spicy au jus–style 
mop sauce served with beef brisket in parts 
of texas.

Sautéing
Sautéing is a dry-heat cooking method in which heat is conducted by a small amount of 
fat. Sautéed meats should be tender and of good color and have a good overall flavor. 
Tenderness is a reflection of the quality of the raw product and color is determined by 
proper cooking temperatures. Cuts from the rib, loin and leg, slices that have been cut into 
cutlets or scallops and meat pounded thin for tenderness are preferred for sautéing. The 
cuts should be uniform in size, shape and thickness to promote even cooking. Any accom￾panying sauce should be well seasoned and complement the meat without overpowering it.
Seasoning Meats to Sauté
The sauces that almost always accompany sautéed meats provide much of the seasoning. 
Alternatively the meat can be marinated or simply seasoned with salt and pepper. If mar￾inated, the meat must be patted dry before cooking to ensure proper browning. Some 
meats are dusted with flour before cooking to seal in juices and promote even browning.
Doneness of Sautéed Meats
As with broiled and grilled meats, the doneness of sautéed meats is determined by 
checking internal temperature, by touch and by timing. The surface of red meats should 
be well browned with a crisp surface; veal and pork should be somewhat lighter.
Accompaniments to Sautéed Meats
Sauces served with sautéed meats are usually made directly in the sauté pan, using the 
fond. They may incorporate a previously thickened sauce, such as demi-glace.
fond (1) french for “stock” or “base”; (2) the 
concentrated juices, drippings and bits of food 
left in pans after foods are roasted or sautéed; 
it is used to flavor sauces made directly in the 
pans in which the foods were cooked
Procedure for Sautéing Meats
1 cut the meat into cutlets, scallops, émincés, medallions, mignonettes, noisettes, 
paillards, chops or small even-sized pieces.
2 Heat a sauté pan and add enough oil or clarified butter to just cover the bottom. the pan 
should be large enough to hold the meat in a single layer. an overcrowded pan will cool 
quickly and cook slowly overcooking the meat before it browns. a pan that is too large may 
cause the fat or meat to burn.
3 remove any excess surface moisture from the meat with clean paper towels. season the meat and 
dredge in flour if desired. add the meat to the sauté pan in a single layer. Do not crowd the pan.
4 adjust the temperature so that the meat’s exterior browns properly without burning and 
the interior cooks. the heat should be high enough to complete the cooking process before 
the meat begins to stew in its own juices.
5 small items may be tossed using the sauté pan’s sloped sides to flip them back on top of 
themselves. Do not toss the meat more than necessary, however. the pan should remain in 
contact with the heat source as much as possible to maintain proper temperatures. larger 
items should be turned using tongs or a kitchen fork. avoid burns by not splashing hot fat.
6 larger items such as chops and thick steaks can be finished in an oven. either place the 
sauté pan in the oven or transfer the meat to another pan to cook in the oven. the latter 
procedure allows a sauce to be made in the original pan as the meat continues to cook.

 Procedure for Preparing a Sauce in the Sauté Pan
1 if a sauce is to be made in the pan, hold the meat on a warm platter in a warm spot while prepar￾ing the sauce. When the meat is removed from the pan, leave a small amount of fat as well as the 
fond. if there is excessive fat, degrease the pan, leaving just enough to cover its bottom. add ingre￾dients such as garlic, shallots and mushrooms as garnishes and sauce flavorings; sauté them.
2 Deglaze the pan with wine or stock. scrape the pan, loosening the fond and allowing it to 
dissolve in the liquid. reduce the deglazing liquid by approximately three-fourths.

Pan-Frying
Pan-frying uses more fat than sautéing to conduct heat. Pan-fried meats should be 
tender and of good color and have a good overall flavor. As with other dry-heat cook￾ing methods, pan-frying requires tender cuts of meat that are usually cut into cutlets 
or scallops and often breaded. In addition to providing flavor, breading seals the 
meat. The breading should be free from breaks, thus preventing the fat from coming 
into direct contact with the meat or collecting in a pocket formed between the meat 
and the breading. Pan-fried items should be golden in color, and the breading should 
not be soggy.
Seasoning Meats to Pan-Fry
Pan-fried meats are usually seasoned lightly with salt and pepper. Either apply salt and 
pepper directly to the meat or add them to the flour or bread crumbs used to bread the 
meat. Spices, dry herbs and ground nuts are often added to the breading mixture for 
additional flavor as well.
Doneness of Pan-Fried Meats
The most accurate way to determine the doneness of a pan-fried item is by timing and 
surface color. The touch method is difficult to use because of the large amounts of hot 
fat. The thinness of the meat means that thermometer readings may not be accurate and 
makes the touch method less accurate than it is with broiled or grilled meats.
Accompaniments to Pan-Fried Meats
Sauces served with pan-fried meats are usually made separately because no fond is cre￾ated during the pan-frying process. Although cream sauces may be served with pan-fried 
meats, sauces with some acidity and sweetness help cut the fattiness. For this reason, 
lemon wedges are frequently served with pan-fried meats.
Procedure for Pan-Frying Meats
1 slice and pound the meat into scallops, as described in chapter 15, Veal. season 
the scallops.
2 Bread the meat using the standard breading procedure detailed in chapter 9, Mise 
en Place.
3 Heat a moderate amount of fat or oil in a heavy pan. there should be enough fat so that 
it comes one-third to halfway up the side of the meat. the temperature should be slightly 
lower than that used to sauté so that the breading will be nicely browned when the item is 
fully cooked.
4 Place the meat in the pan, being careful not to splash the hot fat. fry until brown. turn and 
brown the other side. ideally pan-fried meats should be cut or pounded to a thickness so 
that they are fully cooked when they are well browned on both sides.

Deep-Frying
Deep-frying quickly cooks foods submerged in hot fat. This cooking method does not 
have a tenderizing effect. As even the choicest cuts of meat can always benefit from 
some tenderizing, deep-frying is not usually used for beef, veal, lamb or pork. There are 
exceptions, however. For example, commercially available frozen breaded meat cutlets 
are often deep-fried, and some Asian dishes involve deep-frying small pieces of beef or 
pork before finishing the meat in a sauce.
MOIST-HEAT COOKING METHODS FOR MEAT
Moist-heat cooking methods subject food to heat and moisture. Moist heat is often, 
but not always, used to tenderize tougher cuts of meat through long, slow cooking. 
Simmering is the only moist-heat cooking method discussed here, as it is the only one 
frequently used with meat.
 Simmering
Simmering is usually associated with specific tougher cuts of meat that need to be ten￾derized through long, slow, moist cooking. Meats such as fresh or corned beef brisket, 
fresh or cured hams and beef tongue are often simmered. Beef briskets and tongues, 
pork butts and hams are often simmered whole. Quality simmered meats have good 
flavor and texture. The flavor is determined by the type and seasoning of the cooking 
liquid; the texture is a result of proper cooking temperatures and time.
Seasoning Meats to Simmer
The seasonings and type of cooking liquid used flavors simmered meats. If the meat to 
be simmered was cured by either smoking (as with cured hams, ham hocks and smoked 
pork butt) or pickling (as with corned beef), the cooking liquid will not be used to make 
a sauce and should not be seasoned. Simmering cured meats helps leach out some of the 
excess salt, making the finished dish more palatable.
Cooking Temperatures for Simmered Meats
Moist-heat cooking methods generally use lower temperatures than dry-heat cooking 
methods. Meats are normally simmered at temperatures between 185°F and 205°F (85°C 
and 96°C). In some food service operations, meats such as hams and corned beef are 
cooked at temperatures as low as 150°F (66°C) for up to 12 hours. Although lower 
cooking temperatures result in less shrinkage and a more tender finished product, the 
required cooking times may be increased to the point that very low cooking tempera￾tures may not be practical.
Doneness of Simmered Meats
Simmered meats are always cooked well done, which is determined by tenderness. The 
size and quality of the raw product determines the cooking time. Undercooked meats 
will be tough and chewy. Overcooked meats will be stringy and may fall apart. When 
testing large cuts of meat for doneness, a kitchen fork should be easily inserted into the 
meat and the meat should slide off the fork. Smaller pieces of meat should be tender to 
the bite or easily cut with a fork.
Accompaniments to Simmered Meats
Simmered meats are often served with boiled or steamed vegetables, as in the case of 
corned beef and cabbage. Pickled meats are usually served with mustard or horseradish 
sauce on the side.

Procedure for Simmering Meats
1 cut, trim or tie the meat according to the recipe.
2 Bring enough liquid to cover the meat completely to a boil. too much liquid will leach off 
much of the meat’s flavor; too little will leave a portion of the meat exposed, preventing it from 
cooking. Because the dish’s final flavor is determined by the flavor of the liquid, add plenty of 
mirepoix, flavorings and seasonings to the liquid. (When simmering smoked or cured items, 
start them in cold water. this helps draw off some of the strong smoked or pickled flavors.)
3 add the meat to the liquid.
4 reduce the heat to the desired temperature and cook until the meat is tender. Do not allow 
the cooking liquid to boil. Boiling results in a tough or overcooked and stringy product. if the 
simmered meat is to be served cold, a moister and juicier product can be achieved by remov￾ing the pot from the stove before the meat is fully cooked. the meat and the liquid can be 
cooled in a water bath (such as the one used for a stock, as described in chapter 11, stocks 
and sauces). this allows the residual heat in the cooking liquid to finish cooking the meat.

COMBINATION COOKING METHODS FOR MEATS
Braising, stewing and sous vide cooking are referred to as combination cooking methods 
because both dry heat and moist heat are used to achieve the desired results. Braising 
and stewing are very similar techniques in that the meat is first browned using dry heat, 
then cooked in a liquid that becomes a sauce for the meat. In both cases, the result is a 
product with the flavor of the meat in the sauce and the moisture and flavor of the sauce 
in the meat.
Sous vide cooking uses moist heat first by cooking meat inside sealed plastic bags that 
are submerged in a hot water bath. Then the meat may be browned using dry heat to 
develop surface color and add flavor.
Braising
Braising refers to applying combination cooking techniques to large cuts of meat. 
Braising is often used with tougher cuts that are tenderized by the long, moist cooking 
process. Tough cuts from the chuck, brisket and shank are popular choices, as they are 
very flavorful and contain relatively large amounts of collagen, which adds richness to 
the finished product. Any meat to be braised should be well marbled with an ample fat 
content to produce a moist finished product.
Large pieces of braised meat can be carved like a roast. These cuts should be fork 
tender but not falling apart. Braised meats should have an attractive color from the ini￾tial browning and final glazing. Portion control cuts such as chops can also be braised. 
If tender cuts such as veal chops or pork chops are braised, the finished dish will have 
a different flavor and texture than if these cuts were cooked by a dry-heat method. 
Remember that tender cuts require shorter cooking times because there is less connec￾tive tissue to break down with moist heat.
Seasoning Meats to Braise
The seasoning and overall flavor of a braised dish is largely due to the quality of the 
cooking liquid and the mirepoix, vegetables, herbs, spices and other ingredients that 
season the meat as it cooks. Braised meats can also be marinated before cooking to 
tenderize them and add flavor. The marinade is then sometimes incorporated into the 
braising liquid. Salt and pepper may be added to the flour if the meat is dredged before 
it is browned, or the meat may be seasoned directly (although the salt may draw out 
moisture, wetting the surface of the meat and thereby inhibiting browning).
A standard herb sachet and a tomato product are usually added along with the cook￾ing liquid. The tomato product adds flavor and color to the finished sauce as well as acid 
to tenderize the meat during the cooking process. Final seasoning should not take place 
until cooking is complete and the sauce will not be reduced further.
Cooking Temperatures for Braised Meats
Braised meats are always browned before simmering. As a general rule, smaller cuts are 
floured before browning; larger cuts are not. Flour seals the meat, promotes even brown￾ing and adds body to the sauce that accompanies the meat. Whether floured or not, the 
meat is browned in fat. After browning, white meats should be golden to amber in color; 
red meats should be dark brown. Do not brown the meat too quickly at too high a tem￾perature because it is important to develop a well-caramelized surface. The caramelized 
surface adds color and flavor to the final product.
After the meat is browned, the braising liquid is added and brought to a boil over 
direct heat. The temperature is reduced to a simmer and the pot is covered. Cooking can 
be finished in the oven or on the stove top. The oven provides gentle, even heat with￾out the risk of scorching. If braising is finished on the stove top, proper temperatures 
must be maintained throughout the cooking process, and care must be taken to prevent 
scorching or burning. Lower temperatures and longer cooking times result in more even 
cooking and absorption of the cooking liquid, providing a more flavorful final product.
Properly browned meat to be braised or stewed 
is evenly well-caramelized.
M13_LABE1163_07_SE_C13.indd 342 30/10/23 11:37 AMPrinciPles of Meat cookery 343
Finishing Braised Meats
Near the end of the cooking process, the lid may be removed from oven-braised meats. 
Finishing braised meats without a cover makes it easier to baste the meat. Frequent bast￾ing produces an attractive glaze. As the basting liquid evaporates, the meat is browned 
and a strongly flavored glaze forms. Removing the lid also allows the cooking liquid to 
reduce, thickening it and concentrating its flavors for use as a sauce.
Doneness of Braised Meats
Braised meats are done when they are tender. A fork inserted into the meat should meet 
little resistance. Properly braised meats should remain intact and not fall apart when 
handled gently. Braised meats that fall apart or are stringy are overcooked. If the finished 
braised product is tough, it was probably undercooked or cooked at too high a tempera￾ture. If the entire dish lacks flavor, the meat may not have been properly browned or the 
cooking liquid may have been poorly seasoned.
Accompaniments to Braised Meats
Large braised items are often carved against the grain in thin slices and served with their 
sauce. Vegetables can be cooked with the braised meat, cooked separately and added 
when the main item has finished cooking or added at service. If the vegetables are 
cooked with the main item, they should be added to the pan at intervals based on their 
individual cooking times to prevent overcooking.
Procedure for Braising Meats
the liquid used for braising is usually thickened in one of three ways:
	▪ With a roux added at the start of the cooking process; the roux thickens the sauce as the 
meat cooks.
	▪ Prethickened before the meat is added by cooking the liquid with starch or roux until it 
coats the back of a spoon.
	▪ thickened after the meat is cooked either by puréeing the mirepoix or by using roux, 
arrowroot, cornstarch or other thickener.
the procedure for braising meats includes variations for whichever thickening method is selected.
1 Heat a small amount of oil in a heavy pan.
2 Dredge the meat to be braised in seasoned flour, if desired, and add meat to the oil.
3 Brown the meat well on all sides and remove from the pan.
4 add a mirepoix or the appropriate vegetables to the pan and caramelize well. if using roux, 
it should be added at this time.
5 add the appropriate stock or sauce so that when the meat is returned to the pan the liquid 
comes approximately one-third of the way up the side of the meat.
6 add aromatics and seasonings.
7 return the meat to the sauce. tightly cover the pot and bring it to a simmer. cook slowly 
either on the stove top or by placing the covered pot directly in an oven at 250–300°f 
(120–150°c).
8 cook the item, basting or turning it often so that all sides of the meat benefit from the 
moisture and flavor of the sauce.
9 When the meat is tender, remove it from the pan and hold it in a warm place while the 
sauce is finished.
10 Degrease the sauce. the sauce may be reduced on the stove top to intensify its flavors. if 
the meat was braised in a stock, the stock may be thickened using a roux, arrowroot or 
cornstarch. strain the sauce or, if desired, purée the mirepoix and other ingredients and 
return them to the sauce. adjust the sauce’s consistency and seasonings as desired.

Stewing
Stewing is associated with small or bite-sized pieces of meat, generally 1- to 2-inch 
(2.5- to 5-centimeter) cubes. Stewing uses moist heat to tenderize meat just as braising 
does; therefore many of the same cuts can be used for stewing and braising. When 
cutting meats into cubes for stewing they should be trimmed of excess fat and connec￾tive tissue.
There are two main types of stews: brown stews and white stews. When making 
brown stews, the meat is first browned in fat, then a cooking liquid is added. The ini￾tial browning adds flavor and color to the finished product. The meat in a brown stew 
should be fork tender and have an attractive color and rich flavor. There are two types 
of white stews: fricassees, in which the meat is first cooked in a small amount of fat 
without coloring, then combined with a cooking liquid; and blanquettes, in which the 
meat is first blanched, then rinsed and then added to a cooking liquid. Any type of white 
stew should have the same flavor and texture characteristics as a brown stew but should 
be white or ivory in color.

Seasoning Meats to Stew
Stews, like braised meats, derive much of their flavor from their cooking liquid. A stew’s 
seasoning and overall flavor is a direct result of the quality of the cooking liquid and the 
vegetables, herbs, spices and other ingredients added during cooking.
Cooking Temperatures for Stewed Meats
Meats for brown stews are first cooked at high temperatures over direct heat until well 
browned. Meats for fricassees are first sautéed at low temperatures so that they do not 
develop color.
Once the cooking liquid has been added and the moist-heat cooking process has 
begun, do not allow the stew to boil. Stews benefit from low-temperature cooking. 
When oven space and time permits, stews can be covered and finished in the oven.
Doneness of Stewed Meats
Stewed meats are done when they are fork tender. Test by removing a piece of meat to a 
plate and cutting it with a fork. Any vegetables that are cooked with the meat should be 
added at the proper times so that they and the meat are completely cooked at the same 
time. Many firm vegetables such as carrots, potatoes and turnips will cook in fifteen min￾utes. String beans, tender greens and leafy vegetables may take as little as five minutes. 
(See Chapter 22, Vegetables.)
Accompaniments to Stewed Meats
Stews are often complete meals in themselves, containing meat, vegetables and potatoes 
in one dish. Stews that do not contain a starch are often served with pasta or rice. An 
appropriate bread, whether crusty baguette, pita or garlic toast, may be the only accom￾paniment needed.
Procedure for Stewing Meats—Brown Stews
red meats, lamb and game are used in brown stews. the procedure for making a brown 
stew is very similar to braising.
1 trim the meat of excess fat and silverskin and cut into 1- to 2-inch (2.5- to 5-centimeter) pieces.
2 Dredge the meat in flour, if desired. Heat an appropriate-sized pan and add enough oil to 
cover the bottom. cook the meat in the oil, browning it well on all sides. onions and garlic 
can be added at this time and browned.
3 add flour to the meat and fat and cook to make a roux, if desired.
4 Gradually add the liquid to the roux, stirring to prevent lumps. Bring the stew to a boil and 
reduce to a simmer.
5 add a tomato product and an herb sachet or a bouquet garni. cover and place in the oven 
at 250–300°f (120–150°c) or continue to simmer on the stove top until the meat is ten￾der. add other ingredients such as vegetables or potatoes at the proper time so that they 
will be done when the meat is tender.
6 When the meat is tender, remove the sachet or bouquet garni. Degrease the sauce. 
the meat may be strained out and the sauce thickened with roux, cornstarch or arrowroot 
or reduced to concentrate its flavors.
7 if not added during the cooking process, vegetables and other garnishes may be cooked 
separately and added to the finished stew. (When cooked separately, vegetables and 
garnishes will retain their color, shape and texture.)
Stew Terminology
Ragoût: [ra-Goo] a general term that 
refers to white or brown stews in which 
the meat is cooked by dry heat before a 
liquid is added. in french, ragoût means 
“to bring back the appetite.”
Fricassee: [friHk-uh-see] a white ragoût 
usually made from white meat or 
small game, seared without browning 
and garnished with small onions and 
mushrooms.
Navarin: [nah-veh-raHnG] a brown 
ragoût generally made with turnips, 
other root vegetables, onions, peas and 
lamb.
Blanquette: [blahn-keHt] a white stew 
in which the meat is first blanched, then 
added to a stock or sauce to complete 
the cooking and tenderizing process. 
Blanquettes are finished with a liaison of 
egg yolks and heavy cream.
Chili con carne: a ragoût of ground or 
diced meat cooked with onions, chile 
peppers, cumin and other spices. Despite 
the objections of purists, chili sometimes 
contains beans.
Goulash: a beef stew with Hungarian 
origins made with onions and paprika 
and garnished with potatoes.
Tagine: [tah-Jean] a north african stew 
in which meat, poultry, fish or vegetables 
are flavored with onions, cilantro, spices 
and aromatics and then braised over a 
fire in a covered earthenware vessel of the 
same name.
Adobo: a stew of spanish origin in which 
meats are simmered with onions and 
spices in a savory red chili sauce. in the 
Philippines, adobo refers to a stew in 
which ingredients such as meats, poultry 
or fish are pickled in vinegar, oil and 
spices before cooking.

 Procedure for Stewing Meats—Simmered White Stews (Blanquettes)
Procedure for Stewing Meats—Braised White Stews (Fricassees)
➍ adding the red wine. ➎ adding the tomato purée and sachet. ❻ Degreasing the stew.
the procedure for making fricassees is similar to the procedure for brown stews. the pri￾mary difference is that the meat is sautéed but not allowed to brown. the braised white 
stew (fricassee) procedure outlined here is the basis for Veal fricassee (page 402).
1 trim the meat of excess fat and silverskin and cut into 1- to 2-inch (2.5- to 5-centimeter) pieces.
2 Heat a pan that is large enough to accommodate the meat without crowding, and add 
enough oil to cover the bottom. add the meat (and often an onion) to the pan and cook 
without browning.
3 sprinkle the meat (and onion) with flour and cook to make a blond roux.
4 Gradually add the liquid, stirring to prevent lumps. Bring the stew to a boil and reduce 
to a simmer.
5 add a bouquet garni and seasonings. cover the stew and place in the oven or continue to 
simmer on the stove top, being careful not to burn or scorch the stew.
6 continue to cook until the meat is tender. if the sauce is too thin, remove the meat from the 
sauce and hold the meat in a warm place. reduce the sauce to the proper consistency on the 
stove top or thicken it by adding a small amount of blond roux, cornstarch or arrowroot.
Unlike fricassees, blanquettes contain meat that is blanched, not sautéed. (Because the meat is 
cooked only by moist heat and never by dry heat, the blanquette cooking process is not a true 
combination cooking method; nevertheless, because of its striking similarities to stewing, it is 
included here.) the most common blanquette is made with veal and is known as blanquette de 
veau, but any white meat or lamb can be prepared in this manner using a variety of garnishes.
1 trim the meat of excess fat and silverskin and cut into 1- to 2-inch (2.5- to 5-centimeter) pieces.
2 Blanch the cubed meat by placing the meat in an appropriate pot, covering with cool 
water, adding salt, and bringing it rapidly to a boil. Drain the water. rinse the meat to 
remove any impurities.
3 return the meat to the pot and add enough stock to cover. add a bouquet garni, salt and 
pepper. simmer until the meat is tender, approximately 1–1½ hours.
4 strain the meat from the stock. Discard the bouquet garni. Bring the stock to a boil, 
thicken it with a blond roux and simmer for 15 minutes.
5 return the meat to the thickened stock. add a liaison of cream and egg yolks, as explained 
in chapter 11, stocks and sauces, to enrich and thicken the stew. Heat the stew to a 
simmer. Do not boil or the egg yolks will curdle.
6 if any vegetables are to be added, they should be cooked separately and added to the thick￾ened stock with the meat.
7 adjust the seasonings with a few drops of lemon juice, nutmeg or salt and pepper as needed.

Cooking Sous Vide
Sous vide is a combination cooking method that involves cooking meats sealed in food 
grade plastic pouches at precise temperatures. Tough cuts of meat may be cooked sous 
vide to become tender while retaining flavor. Tender cuts of meat may be cooked evenly 
and to precise temperatures with little shrinkage. Browning the meat after sous vide
cooking develops flavor and a surface color and texture.
Like braising, sous vide can be used to cook tougher cuts of meat such those from 
the chuck or shank. Because they are cooked in a sealed environment, these tough cuts 
retain more moisture and shrink less when cooked sous vide than when conventionally 
braised or stewed. As when braising or stewing, when cooking sous vide select cuts that 
are well-marbled to produce a tender finished product. Except in industrial food produc￾tion, unlike braising, sous vide is not generally used with large cuts of meat, however. 
To ensure that the meat reaches safe internal temperatures quickly, cut the meat into 
individual portions or small pieces of a uniform size and thickness. Package the meat in 
a single layer in individual pouches.
Tender cuts of meat suitable for broiling, grilling or sautéing such as cuts from the 
loin and rib or poultry may also be cooked sous vide. These cuts are cooked to pre￾cise temperatures that preserve their moistness without drying out. Tender cuts of meat 
cooked sous vide will cook evenly from the center to the edge.
 Seasoning Meats to Cook Sous Vide
Adding aromatics, herbs and oil to the pouches before cooking meat sous vide enhances 
the flavor of the finished dish. When preparing tough cuts of meat that will be cooked 
for an extended period in the water bath, add salt after the meat is cooked. This prevents 
the meat from developing a tough cured texture.
Temperatures for Cooking Sous Vide
When cooking tougher cuts of meat sous vide, the optimal temperature range of the 
water bath is between 148°F (64°C) and 185°F (90°C). When tough meats are cooked 
at the lower temperatures in this range, they retain a pink color unlike conventionally 
simmered or braised meats. But due to the long holding time at that temperature, from 
8 to 48 hours, the collagen will soften and the meat will be tender. Small changes in the 
temperatures and cooking times affect the texture of the cooked meat.
For tender cuts of meat such as steaks, cook to the desired internal temperature corre￾sponding to the degree of doneness—rare, medium rare, medium or well done—making 
certain that the meat is not in the temperature danger zone (41–135°F/5–57°C) for more 
than 4 hours. (See Figure 2.4.)
Doneness of Meat Cooked Sous Vide
The temperature of the water bath and the time in the water bath determine when the 
meat is done. Tougher cuts of meat cooked sous vide may be tender enough to cook 
with a fork or they may have a firmer texture depending on the temperature of the water 
bath and the time. Once the meat reaches the desired temperature, it can be held in the 
heated water bath, at its cooking temperature, for 2–3 hours.
Tender cuts of meat cooked sous vide are done when they reach the desired internal 
temperature. To take the internal temperature of meat in a sous vide pouch, apply a 
piece of closed cell foam tape to the top of the pouch. Then pierce the tape with 
a needle probe thermometer designed for use with sous vide bags. The tape will 
seal itself after the probe is removed. Individual cuts of meat approximately 1-inch 
(2.5-centimeters) thick should be fully cooked in 1–2 hours. Meats cooked sous vide do 
not overcook because the internal temperature will not exceed the precise temperature 
of the water bath. (Although the meat will not overcook, it may soften and become 
mushy if left for too long.) To ensure that the meat stays out of the temperature danger 
zone, tender cuts of meats and poultry cooked sous vide should be finished and served 
immediately.
 Safety Alert
Sous Vide Sanitation
food safety is of utmost concern when 
using sous vide techniques because of the 
low cooking temperatures. to prevent the 
growth of microorganisms, any food to 
be cooked sous vide must be chilled below 
the temperature danger zone (41°f/5°c) 
before cooking. keep all cutting boards, 
knives and food contact surfaces clean 
and sanitary and wear clean disposable 
gloves. Use only the freshest unblemished 
ingredients. 
foods packaged in plastic pouches 
and cooked sous vide are highly susceptible 
to bacterial contamination. although 
a range of cooking temperatures and 
times may be used to prepare foods sous 
vide, to ensure food safety, follow the 
temperatures and cooking times exactly 
as outlined in the recipes provided. 
consult your local health department for 
regulations for preparing food sous vide. 
special permission and a HaccP plan 
may be required.

 Finishing Meat Cooked Sous Vide
Because there is no Maillard browning when cooking sous vide, the meats should be 
quickly browned in a sauté pan, on a grill, under a broiler or salamander or with a pro￾pane torch before serving. This final browning adds the caramelized flavors and colors 
associated with many meat preparations.

Cooking liquids collect in the sous vide pouch but rarely in sufficient quantity to properly 
garnish the meat. Generally any accompanying sauce is prepared separately. A wide 
variety of sauces are suitable for foods cooked sous vide depending on the type of meat 
and flavor profile.
Procedure for Preparing Foods Sous Vide
1 assemble sanitizing equipment, single-use gloves and thermometer. Use a water oven or an 
immersion circulator to bring a water bath to the desired temperature.
2 cut, trim or otherwise prepare meat to be cooked sous vide. sear meat to add flavor to the 
meat as it cooks, if desired. (Quickly chill any seared meat in the refrigerator below the 
 temperature danger zone [41°f/5°c] before proceeding.)
3 Wearing single-use gloves to prevent cross-contamination with microorganisms, place 
the meat in a single layer in plastic pouches. add fat, seasonings and cooking liquids 
as desired.
4 Vacuum seal the pouches using a chamber vacuum machine.
5 Place the pouches in the heated water bath or water oven allowing enough space for 
the water to flow freely around them without overcrowding. Doneness is determined by 
 temperature or texture of the food.
6 season, sear and serve the meat immediately. or, for later service, prepare an ice and water 
bath with salt. transfer the pouches of cooked food to the ice and water bath. leave them 
in the ice and water bath for at least 30 minutes. Pouches of cooked food must be chilled 
to below 41°f/5°c or lower in 2 hours or less. label the pouches with the date, the time of 
production and the use-by date, then refrigerate.
7 to serve meat previously cooked and chilled, reheat the pouch in a water bath until the 
meat reaches the desired temperature. remove the meat from the pouch then season and 
sear it quickly before serving.

 Beef is the meat of domesticated cattle. Most of the beef people in the United States 
eat comes from steers, which are male cattle castrated as calves and specifically 
raised for beef. Although U.S. diners are consuming less beef today than before, 
Americans still consume far more beef than any other meat. The beef in the U.S. is leaner 
than that of years past, thanks to advances in animal husbandry and closer trimming of exte￾rior fat. Cattle ranchers and small regional farmers are rediscovering older breeds of livestock 
and new ways to fabricate beef, bringing excitement to the assortment of beef products 
available to chefs and consumers. 
 PRIMAL AND SUBPRIMAL CUTS OF BEEF 
 After the steer is slaughtered, the carcass is cut into four pieces (called quarters ) for 
easy handling. This is done by first splitting the carcass down the backbone into two 
bilateral halves called sides of beef. Each half is divided into the forequarter (the front 
portion) and the hindquarter (the rear portion) by cutting along the natural curvature 
between the 12th and 13th ribs. The quartered carcass is then further reduced into the 
primal cuts and the subprimal and fabricated cuts. 
 The eight primal cuts of beef are the chuck, brisket and shank, rib, short plate, short 
loin, sirloin, flank and round. Figure 14. 1 illustrates the relationship between a steer’s 
bone structure and the eight primal cuts. It is important to know the location of bones 
when cutting or working with meats. This makes meat fabrication and carving easier 
and aids in identifying cuts. Figure 14. 2 shows the primal cuts of beef and their location 
on the carcass. An entire beef carcass can range in weight from 500 to more than 800 
pounds (240 to 380 kg). 
 FOREQUARTER PRIMAL CUTS OF BEEF 
 The forequarter consists of four primal cuts: the chuck, the brisket and shank, the 
rib and the short plate. The forequarter represents approximately 55 percent of the 
carcass weight. 
 Chuck 
 The primal chuck is the animal’s shoulder; it accounts for approximately 28 percent of 
carcass weight. It contains a portion of the backbone, five rib bones and portions of the 
blade and arm bones. 
 Because an animal constantly uses its shoulder 
muscles, chuck contains a high percentage of con￾nective tissue and is quite tough. This tough cut 
of beef, however, is one of the most flavorful 
and least costly. 
 The primal chuck is used less frequently 
than other primal cuts in food service opera￾tions. If cooked whole, the chuck is difficult to 
cut or carve because of the large number of bones 
and relatively small muscle groups that travel in dif￾ferent directions. When fabricating their own meats, 
chefs often purchase beef chuck as chuck square 
cut , which is a two-piece cut. The smaller of the two 
pieces, both of which are shown here, is referred to as the 
shoulder or shoulder clod . Chuck square cut (two pieces) 
M14_LABE1163_07_SE_C14.indd 354 31/10/23 7:45 PMBeef 355
 The primal chuck produces several fabricated cuts: cross rib pot roast, chuck short 
ribs, cubed or tenderized steaks, stew meat and ground chuck used to make hamburg￾ers, meatloaf and related items. Because chuck meat is less 
tender, these fabricated cuts usually benefit from moist￾heat cooking or combination cooking methods such as 
stewing and braising. There are exceptions, however. The 
beef industry is developing new products from affordable 
and underutilized cuts of meat. The 
shoulder top blade , cut from the 
shoulder clod of the chuck can be cut 
into blade steaks (flat iron) . This cut 
is gaining popularity as an alternative 
and less costly steak suitable for dry-heat cooking. The 
whole shoulder clod is a popular cut for traditional barbe￾cue. The slow cooking of the barbeque method tenderizes the 
tough cut.

M14_LABE1163_07_SE_C14.indd 355 31/10/23 7:46 PM356 CHAPTeR fOURTeeN
 Brisket and Shank 
 The brisket and shank are located beneath the primal chuck on the front half of the 
carcass. Together they form a single primal that accounts for approximately 8 percent 
of carcass weight. This primal consists of the steer’s breast (the brisket), which contains 
the ribs and breast bone, and its arm (the foreshank ), which contains the shank meat 
and bone. 
 The ribs and breast bone are always removed from the brisket before cook￾ing. The boneless brisket is very tough and contains a substantial percentage 
of fat, both intermuscular and subcutaneous. It is well suited for moist-heat 
and combination cooking methods such as simmering or braising. It is often 
pickled (or corned ) to produce corned beef brisket, or cured and peppered 
to make pastrami. 
 Beef foreshanks are very flavorful and high in collagen. Because collagen 
converts to gelatin when cooked using moist heat, foreshanks are excellent for making 
soups and stocks. Ground shank meat is often used to help clarify and flavor consom￾més because of its rich flavor and high collagen content. Marrow , the soft tissue in the 
center of the foreshank and hindshank bones, is considered a delicacy when cooked and 
added to sauces or spread on toast. (The hindshank is the animal’s leg; the term shank
generally is used to refer to either the foreshank or the hindshank.) 
 Rib 
 The primal beef rib accounts for approximately 10 percent of carcass weight. It consists 
of ribs 6 through 12 as well as a portion of the backbone. 
 This primal is best known for yielding roast prime rib of beef. Prime rib is not named 
after the quality grade USDA Prime. Rather its name reflects the fact that it constitutes 
the majority of the primal cut. The eye meat of the rib (the center muscle portion) is not 
a well-exercised muscle and therefore is quite tender. The eye meat also contains large 
amounts of marbling compared to the rest of the carcass and produces rich, full-flavored 
roasts and steaks. 
 Rib roasts are available in a variety of styles. 
The oven-ready rib roast contains rib bones, 
the short feather bones and a thick layer of 
fat called a fat cap . The export style rib 
roast contains only rib bones and a thin layer 
of fat. And the beef rib eye is boneless. 
The rib eye can be cut into boneless rib eye 
steaks (also called entrecôtes). The rib bones 
that are separated from the rib eye meat are 
quite meaty and flavorful and can be served as 
barbecued beef ribs. (The ends of the rib bones 
that are trimmed off the primal rib to produce the 
rib roast are known as beef short ribs. This is one 
of several sources for beef short ribs; beef short ribs 
are also cut from the primal short plate as discussed in the 
following section as well as from the primal chuck.) 
 Short Plate 
 The short plate is located directly below the primal rib; it accounts for 
approximately 9 percent of the overall weight of the carcass. The 
short plate contains rib bones and cartilage and is the source 
for short ribs and skirt steak. Beef short ribs are meaty, yet 
high in connective tissue, and are best when braised. Skirt 
steak , which is the animal’s diaphragm muscle, is often 
marinated and grilled as fajitas. Other, less meaty portions 
of the short plate are trimmed and ground for hamburger 
and related uses.

HINDQUARTER PRIMAL CUTS OF BEEF
The hindquarter consists of four primal cuts: the short loin, sirloin, flank and round. It 
represents approximately 45 percent of the carcass weight.
Short Loin
The primal short loin is the anterior (front) portion of the beef loin. The short loin is 
located just behind the rib and is the first primal cut of the hindquarter when the side 
of beef is divided into a forequarter and hindquarter. It accounts for approximately 8 
percent of carcass weight.
The short loin contains a single rib, the 13th, and a portion of the backbone. With 
careful butchering, this small primal can yield several subprimal and fabricated cuts, 
which are among the most tender, popular and expensive cuts of beef.
The short loin eye muscle, a continuation of the rib eye muscle, runs along the top of 
the T-shaped bones that form the backbone. Beneath the loin eye muscle on the other 
side of the backbone is the tenderloin, the most tender beef cut of all.
When the short loin is cut in cross-sections with the bone in, it produces—starting 
with the rib end of the short loin—club steaks (which do not contain any tenderloin), 
T-bone steaks (which contain only a small portion of tenderloin) and porterhouse
steaks (which are cut from the sirloin end of the short loin and contain a large portion 
of tenderloin).
The whole tenderloin can also be removed 
and cut into châteaubriand, filet 
mignon and tournedos. A portion of 
the tenderloin is located in the sirloin 
portion of the loin. When the entire beef 
loin is divided into the primal short loin 
and primal sirloin, the large end of the ten￾derloin (the butt tenderloin) is separated from 
the remainder of the tenderloin and remains in the 
sirloin; the smaller end of the tenderloin (the short ten￾derloin) remains in the short loin. If the tenderloin is to be 
kept whole, it must be removed before the short loin and sir￾loin are separated. The loin eye meat can be removed from the bones, producing a bone￾less strip loin, which is very tender and can be roasted or cut into boneless strip steaks.
Another cut is found between the flank and the plate near the kidneys. The hang￾ing tender is close to the backbone between the 12th and 13th ribs. It is a pair of lean 
V-shaped muscles approximately 7 inches (17 centimeters) long. Each hanger steak
weighs about 8–12 ounces (250–360 grams). Also known as bistro steaks or butcher’s 
tenderloins, hanger steaks are highly flavorful and popular with chefs. The hanger steak 
benefits from being marinated and should be seared, grilled or broiled rare to medium 
rare, then sliced on the bias for service.
Sirloin
The primal sirloin is located in the hindquarter, between the short 
loin and the round. It accounts for approximately 7 percent of carcass 
weight and contains part of the backbone as well as a portion of the 
hip bone.
The sirloin produces bone-in or boneless roasts such as the top sirloin 
butt and the bottom sirloin butt tri tip, steaks that are flavorful and tender. 
With the exception of the tenderloin portion, however, the subprimals and fabricated 
cuts from the sirloin are not as tender as those from the strip loin. (A portion of the 
tenderloin called the butt tenderloin is located in the sirloin portion of the loin.)
Cuts from the sirloin are cooked using dry-heat methods such as broiling, grilling 
or roasting.

 Flank 
 The flank is located directly beneath the loin, posterior to (behind) the short plate. The 
flank accounts for approximately 6 percent of carcass weight. It contains no bones. 
 Although quite flavorful, it is a less tender cut with a good deal of fat and connec￾tive tissue. Flank meat is usually trimmed and ground, with the exception of the flank 
steak , which is often marinated, broiled and sliced thinly to prepare a dish known as 
London broil . 
 Round 
 The primal round is very large, weighing as much as 100 pounds (45 kilograms) and 
accounting for approximately 24 percent of carcass weight. It is the hind leg of the ani￾mal and contains the round bone, aitch bone, shank bone and tail bones. 
 Meat from the round is flavorful, fairly tender and reasonably priced. The round 
yields a wide variety of subprimal and fabricated cuts: the inside (top) round, eye 
round, outside round (the outside round and the eye round together are called 
the bottom round ), knuckle and hindshank with the leg bone. (See Figure 14. 3 .) 
Steaks cut from the round are less tender, but because they have large muscles 
and limited intermuscular fat, the top round and knuckle make good roasts 
when cooked rare and sliced thin to preserve tenderness. The bottom round 
is best when braised. The steamship round is very large roast weighing 
as much as 70 pounds (30 kilograms), comprising nearly the entire primal 
round. It is usually roasted whole and carved to order for special events 
or buffets.

BEEF ORGAN MEATS
Several organ meats are used in food service operations. This group of products is 
known as offal. It includes cuts that come from either a gland or a muscle. Glandular 
meats, which are tender with no connective tissue, are the brain, kidney and liver. 
They are best when cooked briefly using dry-heat cooking methods although brains 
can be poached before pan frying. Muscle meats are the heart, tongue, tripe (stomach 
lining) and oxtails. With the exception of the heart, which 
can be grilled or sautéed, these muscle cuts benefit from 
moist-heat cooking and are often used in soup, stew or 
braised dishes. Beef tongue is a fatty meat that should 
be cooked gently by poaching. After cooking, the tough 
outer membrane of the tongue can be peeled away easily 
and the rich, flavorful flesh sliced for sandwiches, or paired with 
a sauce made from the poaching liquid.
Tripe is the lining of a cow’s stomach. It is usually blanched then cut 
into strips and simmered in a highly seasoned liquid until tender. Despite 
the name, oxtails refers to any bovine tail. Oxtails are usually cut into 
short lengths for stewing.
NUTRITIONAL INFORMATION FOR BEEF
Beef is a major source of protein and the primary food source of zinc as well as B vita￾mins, trace minerals and other nutrients. Although well-marbled beef does contain a high 
percentage of saturated fat, lean cuts of beef such as eye round and top round roasts, top 
sirloin and shoulder pot roast have less fat than chicken thighs, a standard level of com￾parison. Excess fat should be trimmed as much as possible before cooking and serving.
BASIC BUTCHERING PROCEDURES FOR BEEF
Although many food service operations buy their beef previously cut and portioned, it 
is still important for a cook to be able to fabricate cuts of beef and perform basic butch￾ering tasks. Performing some basic fabrication procedures in the kitchen saves money 
and allows chefs to cut the meat to their exact specifications. Knowledge of portioning 
a whole beef tenderloin, for example, allows a chef to produce cuts used for many dif￾ferent preparations. (See Figure 14.4.) Given the growing interest in purchasing locally 
grown ingredients, the ability to break down larger cuts of beef is even more essential 
because smaller producers usually sell beef split or quartered.

Tongue

Beef Sustainability
The increasing rate of global beef consumption 
concerns many people because of the land, water 
and feed required to raise animals for human 
consumption. Transporting beef to kitchens 
and storing it under refrigeration requires 
energy in the form of gas, oil and electricity. 
Cattle are also the number one producer of the 
greenhouse gasses carbon dioxide and methane. 
One step chefs can take to mitigate these issues 
is to choose suppliers committed to raising 
animals sustainably. Local farms may be a good 
alternative to national and international meat 
suppliers. Buying locally also reduces the energy 
used for deliveries.
A number of leaders in the food industry 
recommend that chefs also work to reduce the 
amount of beef and other animal products that 
diners consume because overconsumption of 
meat can lead to obesity and chronic diseases. 
Decreasing the amount of meat consumed 
each week, for example, may go a long way 
toward improving the environment and 
preserving our health.
Here are some additional steps you 
can take to reduce the amount of meat, 
particularly beef, you serve while still 
providing your customers with appealing 
menu options:
	▪ Reduce the portion size of the meat served 
when possible. In many instances, the 
difference between a 7- and an 8-ounce 
steak may be imperceptible.
	▪ Balance items served on each plate between 
animal products and beans, whole grains, 
vegetables and greens.
	▪ Use beef as a condiment rather than the 
star attraction in dishes where this is 
appropriate. The recipe for Seared Beef 
Salad with Nuoc Cham, Greens and Herbs 
on page 372, for example, emphasizes 
a small portion of flavorful strip steak 
accompanied by cucumbers, julienned 
carrots and fresh greens.

➊ Cut and pull the excess fat from the entire 
tenderloin to expose the meat.
➋ Remove the chain muscle from the side 
of the tenderloin. Although it contains much 
connective tissue, the chain muscle may be 
trimmed and the meat used in soups, stews 
or ground.
➌ Trim away all of the fat and silverskin. Do 
so by loosening a small piece of silverskin; then, 
holding the loosened silverskin tightly with one 
hand, cut it away in long strips, angling the knife 
up toward the silverskin slightly so that only the 
silverskin is removed and no meat is wasted.

Procedure for Butterflying Meats
Many cuts of boneless meats such as tenderloin steaks and boneless pork chops can be butter￾flied to create a thinner cut that has a greater surface area and cooks more quickly.
➊ Make the first cut nearly all the way 
through the meat, keeping it attached by leav￾ing approximately ¼ inch (6 millimeters) uncut.
➋ Make a second cut, this time cutting all the 
way through, completely removing the steak 
from the tenderloin.
Procedure for Cutting a New York Steak from a Boneless Strip Loin
➊ Square up the strip loin by trimming off the 
lip so it extends 1–2 inches (2.5–5 centimeters) 
from the eye muscle.
➋ Turn the strip over and trim off any fat or 
connective tissue.
➌ Turn the strip back over and trim the fat 
covering to a uniform thickness of ¼ inch 
(6 millimeters).
➍ Cut the steaks to the thickness or 
weight desired.
➎ The eye meat of steaks located on the 
sirloin end of the strip is divided by a strip of 
connective tissue. Steaks cut from this area are 
called vein steaks and are inferior to steaks 
cut from the rib end of the strip.

 QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION 
1 List each beef primal cut and describe its location on the carcass. for each primal cut, 
identify two subprimal or fabricated cuts taken from it. 
2 Most steaks are cut from the hindquarter. What popular steak is cut from the forequarter? 
Why is it tender when other cuts from the forequarter are relatively tough? 
3 Which fabricated cuts contain a portion of the tenderloin? explain which cooking methods 
are best suited for these cuts. 
4 List some of the beef organ meats used in western cuisines and suggest ways of preparing them. 
5 Use the Internet to find websites sponsored by the beef industry to learn more. Does 
cooking method affect the fat and cholesterol content of a beef steak? How has consumer 
demand for beef products changed over the past few years? 
6 Learn about the breeds of cattle being raised for beef around the world. Describe how the 
breeds differ in terms of fat content and finished weight. Do countries outside the United 
States have different techniques for fabricating beef? 
7 Would it be better to use the chuck for grilling or stewing? explain your answer. 
 Wagyu Beef 
 Wagyu beef has captured the interest of beef 
eaters worldwide, but what is it exactly? 
The word literally means Japanese beef, but 
American grown and processed Wagyu is 
now well respected also. Wagyu breeds of 
cattle produce flesh with extremely high 
levels of uniform marbling composed of a 
high percentage of monounsaturated fat. 
This results from good genetics and a two￾year growth cycle that includes low stress 
living conditions and a specialized diet. The 
meat is velvety tender with a rich, buttery 
flavor. Crossbreeding Wagyu with traditional 
American beef cattle results in the same 
tenderness but with a more robust flavor 
profile that appeals to North American palates. 
 Kobe is an ultra-premium type of Wagyu 
cattle that must be bred and raised in the area 
surrounding the city of Kobe, Japan. Kobe 
cattle are given a special diet and frequent 
massages to produce the ultimate in tenderness 
and expense. Beware of less costly offerings and 
packages marked “Kobe-style,” two clear signs 
you are not getting the real thing.

Classic Flavor 
Combinations for Beef
Antonin Carême once said that “beef is 
the soul of cooking.” Beef ’s flavor stands 
up well to most any sauce and seasoning. 
from tangy chimichurri on grilled strip 
steak to the assertive flavors of chilli in a 
hearty stew and peppercorns in steak au 
poivre, beef shines in robust preparations. 
Yet tender cuts, such as the loin, marry 
well with rich, subtle sauces such as 
tarragon-scented hollandaise or red 
wine reductions.

Korean-Style Beef Bulgogi
Bulgogi is a marinated beef and onion dish traditionally cooked on a grill over a hardwood fire, 
although a hot wok with a bit of oil can be used instead. Either way the beef should develop a nicely 
seared exterior but remain moist and tender. If possible, use authentic brewed Korean soy sauce 
(yangjo ganjang) in the marinade as it is less salty with a slightly sweet finish.

Châteaubriand
French chefs of the late 19th century began referring to the classic filet de boeuf (a very thick steak 
cut from the best part of the filet) as Châteaubriand in reference to the 19th-century diplomat and 
author of the same name. As traditionally prepared by his chef, the dish is served with béarnaise sauce, 
 château potatoes (page 722) and a bouquetière of vegetables.

1 Trim 3–4 inches (7.5–10 centimeters) of the tail from the tenderloin. (The small tail portion can be 
used in a stir-fry or other preparation.) Season the tenderloin with salt and pepper and sear in a 
small amount of oil in a large rondeau. Remove from the pan and cool.
2 Spread the surface of the tenderloin with the pâté de foie gras. Sprinkle the truffles over the pâté.
3 Roll the puff pastry dough into a rectangle approximately 3 ∕
16 inch (5 millimeters) thick and large 
enough to wrap around the entire tenderloin.
4 Turn the tenderloin over and place it lengthwise, pâté side down, in the center of the pastry. fold 
the pastry ends over the meat and wrap the pastry around the tenderloin, sealing it with egg wash 
and trimming off any excess.
5 Transfer the Wellington to a baking sheet, placing the seam side down. Brush the surface with 
egg wash.
6 Bake the Wellington in a 350°f (180°C) oven until the center reaches 125–130°f (52–54°C), 
approximately 40 minutes. Do not overcook; the crust holds in steam and heat, thus enhancing the 
effects of carryover cooking.
7 Allow the meat to rest 5 minutes after baking. Carve the Wellington tableside or on a buffet with 
Madeira sauce served on the side.
Variation:
Individual Wellingtons can be made by cutting the tenderloin into 4- to 5-ounce (120- to 150-gram) 
filet mignons, using smaller pieces of puff pastry and reducing the cooking time to approximately 
20 minutes.

Meatballs: A Blank 
Slate for Culinary 
Creativity
When making meatballs, the 
combination of meat used affects the 
final flavor; ground beef, lamb, pork and 
veal work well alone or in combination. 
Select meat that is 20% fat and 80% lean 
to ensure a juicy product. Dry bread 
crumbs give the meatball a firm texture; 
moist fresh bread crumbs produce a 
soft, tender meatball. fresh herbs, such 
as cilantro, dill, mint, rosemary, sage 
and tarragon, and spices, such as curry 
powder and Cajun seasoning, provide 
the flavor profile desired. form the meat 
mixture into miniature sizes for soups 
or larger sizes for main course portions. 
Chill thoroughly before baking, pan￾frying or simmering so that the meatballs 
hold their shape while cooking.

 Safety Alert
Cooking with Alcohol
When alcohol comes into contact with 
a flame, it can ignite. To avoid singed 
eyebrows and kitchen fires, observe care 
when adding wine, liqueurs or liquor to 
a dish near the stove. When a dish calls 
for flambéing, follow these procedures. 
Stand away from the pan being flamed. 
Tilt the pan away from you, allowing the 
fumes to be ignited by the open flame. 
Be careful, as the flames can leap from 
the pan.

 Safety Alert
Sous Vide Sanitation
food safety is of utmost concern when 
using sous vide techniques because of the 
low cooking temperatures. To prevent the 
growth of microorganisms, any food to be 
cooked sous vide must be chilled below 
the temperature danger zone (41°f/5°C) 
before cooking. Keep all cutting boards, 
knives and food contact surfaces clean 
and sanitary and wear clean disposable 
gloves. Use only the freshest unblemished 
ingredients. Consult your local health 
department for regulations for preparing 
food sous vide. Special permission and a 
HACCP plan may be required.

 Safety Alert
Serving Raw Beef
Although culturally appropriate in the 
cuisines of many countries, raw beef 
is a potentially hazardous food that 
requires time and temperature controls 
for safety (TCS). It may carry harmful 
bacteria including Salmonella, Listeria, 
Campylobacter and e. coli. According 
to the 2022 food Code of the fDA, 
uncooked meat may be served as long 
as a consumer advisory is printed on 
the menu. (It may not be offered on 
menus serving at-risk communities such 
as children or older adults.) Observe 
the strictest sanitary standards when 
preparing raw meat dishes to prevent 
cross-contamination. Serve only fresh 
beef from the most reliable suppliers. 
Keep it chilled below 41°f (5°C). Always 
wear clean disposable gloves when 
preparing meat that is to be consumed 
without cooking. Check local regulations 
for the most accurate information for 
your area.
Carpaccio
Carpaccio is paper-thin slices of raw beef often served drizzled with olive oil and garnished with 
shaved Parmesan cheese. The dish takes its name from that of the Italian Renaissance artist Vittore 
Carpaccio, known for his lavish use of rich red colors in his paintings. A salad of pungent greens such 
as arugula or watercress is a traditional accompaniment.

 Veal is the meat of young, usually male, calves that are by-products of the dairy 
industry. The majority are Holstein, though other breeds can be used. Dairy cows 
must calve before they begin to give milk. A few of the bull calves (males) that 
aren’t used in the dairy herds are used in today’s veal industry. Veal is lighter in color than 
beef, has a more delicate flavor and is generally more tender. Young formula-fed veal has a 
firm texture, light pink color and very little fat. As soon as a calf starts eating solid food, the 
iron in the food begins to turn the young animal’s meat a deeper red, with some marbling 
and external fat. Although veal may come from any calf under the age of 9 months, most veal 
calves are typically slaughtered at approximately 450 pounds or 5 to 6 months old, the same 
age at which pigs are slaughtered. 
 Veal’s mild flavor and low fat content makes it a popular meat, especially among 
Europeans and those looking for an alternative to beef. Its delicate flavor is complemented 
by both classic and modern sauces. 
 PRIMAL AND SUBPRIMAL CUTS OF VEAL 
 After slaughter, a calf carcass can be split down the backbone into two bilateral halves 
or, more typically, cut along the natural curvature between the eleventh and twelfth ribs 
into a foresaddle (front portion) and a hindsaddle (rear portion). The veal carcass yields 
five primal cuts: three from the foresaddle (the shoulder, foreshank and breast and rib) 
and two from the hindsaddle (the loin and leg). The veal shoulder, rib and loin primals 
contain both bilateral portions; that is, a veal loin contains both sides of the animal’s loin. 
 Figure 15. 1 illustrates the relationship between the calf’s bone structure and the pri￾mal cuts. Knowing the location of bones when cutting or working with veal (as well as 
all other types of meats) makes fabrication and carving easier and aids in identifying 
cuts. Figure 15. 2 shows the primal cuts of veal and their location. A veal carcass weighs 
in a range of 60–245 pounds (27–110 kg). 
 FORESADDLE PRIMAL CUTS OF VEAL 
 The foresaddle of veal consists of the shoulder, foreshank and breast and rib. It may be 
purchased whole or divided into the primal or subprimal cuts. 
 Veal Shoulder 
 Similar to the beef shoulder or chuck, the veal shoulder accounts for 21 percent of the 
carcass weight. It contains four rib bones (as opposed to five in the beef chuck) and por￾tions of the backbone, blade and arm bones. 
 In veal, the backbone, blade and arm bones are sometimes removed and the meat 
roasted or stuffed and roasted. Although veal shoulder chops and steaks can be fabri￾cated, they are inferior to the chops cut from more tender areas such as the loin or rib. 
Often the shoulder and neck meat are ground or cubed for stew. Because of the rela￾tively large amount of connective tissue it contains, meat from the shoulder is relatively 
tough and best braised or stewed. 
 Veal Foreshank and Breast 
 The veal foreshank and veal breast are located beneath the shoulder and rib sections 
on the front half of the carcass. They are considered one primal cut. Combined, they 
account for approximately 16 percent of the carcass weight. This primal contains rib 
M15_LABE1163_07_SE_C15.indd 382 31/10/23 7:50 PMVEAl 383
bones and rib cartilage, breast bones and shank bones. Because the calf is slaughtered 
young, many of the breast bones are cartilaginous rather than bony. 
 This cartilage, as well as the ample fat and connective tissue present in the 
breast, breaks down during long moist cooking, thus making the flavorful breast 
a good choice for braising. Veal breast can also be cubed for stews such as veal 
fricassee and veal blanquette, rolled and stuffed or trimmed and ground. 
 The foreshank is also very flavorful but tough. It can be braised whole or 
sliced perpendicular to the shank bone and braised to produce osso buco . 
 Veal Rib 
 The veal double rib , also known as a veal hotel rack , is a very tender, relatively 
small primal cut accounting for approximately 9 percent of the carcass weight. It is very 
popular and very expensive. The double rack consists of two racks , each with seven rib 
bones and a portion of the backbone.

 Classic Flavor 
Combinations 
for Veal 
 Veal is much more delicately flavored 
than beef, with a finer texture and lighter 
color. Its flavor blends well with a variety 
of sauces and other ingredients but 
should not be overpowered by them. Veal 
is often paired with light cream sauces 
flavored with fresh, mild herbs such as 
chervil, chives, parsley and tarragon, with 
mustard or with paprika. Sautéed veal 
scallops or grilled veal chops are often 
finished with a simple squeeze of fresh 
lemon before serving. The acidity in fresh 
apples, sorrel or tomatoes also enhances 
the flavor of many classic veal dishes. 
M15_LABE1163_07_SE_C15.indd 383 31/10/23 7:51 PM384 CHAPTER FIFTEEN
Veal racks can be roasted whole, but 
more often, veal racks are trimmed and cut 
into chops, which can also be bone-in or 
boneless, to be grilled, sautéed or braised. The 
bones of the racks or individual chops are trimmed of 
excess fat, a technique called frenching. (See Chapter 16, 
Lamb, page 410.)
HINDSADDLE PRIMAL CUTS OF VEAL
The hindsaddle consists of the loin and leg. It may be purchased whole or divided into 
the primal or subprimal cuts.
Veal Loin
The veal loin is posterior to the primal rib, contains two ribs (num￾bers 12 and 13) and accounts for approximately 10 percent of the 
carcass weight. The loin consists of the loin eye muscle on top 
of the rib bones and the tenderloin under them.
The veal loin eye is very tender, and the veal 
tenderloin is, without a doubt, the most tender 
cut of veal. If the primal veal loin is separated 
from the primal leg before the tenderloin is 
removed, the tenderloin will be cut into 
two pieces. The small portion (short 
tenderloin) remains in the primal 
loin, and the large portion (butt 
tenderloin) remains in the sirloin 
portion of the primal leg. The ten￾derloin is sometimes removed and 
cut into medallions. The veal loin is 
often cut into chops, bone-in or boneless. 
A boneless veal loin is called a boneless strip loin. Veal loin meat is usually cooked 
using dry-heat methods such as broiling, grilling, roasting or sautéing.
Veal Leg
The primal veal leg consists of both the sirloin and the leg. Together they account 
for approximately 42 percent of the carcass weight. The primal leg is separated from 
the loin by a cut perpendicular to the backbone immediately anterior to the hip bone. 
The leg contains portions of the backbone, tail bone, hip bone, aitch bone, round bone 
and hindshank.
Although it is tender enough to be roasted whole, the veal leg is typically fabricated 
into cutlets and scallops for scallopine or schnitzel. As shown on pages 386–388, 
to fabricate these cuts, the veal leg is first broken down into its major muscles: 
the top round, eye round, knuckle, sirloin, bottom round (which 
includes the sirloin) and butt tenderloin. Each 
of these muscles can be reduced to scal￾lops by trimming all fat and visible 
connective tissue and slicing against 
the grain to the desired thickness. 
The scallops then should be pounded 
carefully to tenderize them further and to

VEAL ORGAN MEATS
Several veal organ meats (offal) are used in food service operations. Calf organ meats are 
more tender with a milder flavor than those from beef.
Sweetbreads
Sweetbreads are the thymus glands of veal (Fr. ris de veau) and lamb (Fr. ris d’agneau). As 
an animal ages, its thymus gland shrinks; therefore sweetbreads are not available from older 
cattle or sheep. Veal sweetbreads are much more popular than lamb sweetbreads in the 
United States. Good-quality sweetbreads should be plump and firm, with the exterior mem￾brane intact. Delicately flavored and tender, they are usually blanched before being sautéed 
or pan-fried, although sweetbreads can be prepared by almost any cooking method.
Calves’ Liver
Calves’ liver is much more popular than beef liver because of its tenderness and mild 
flavor. Good-quality calves’ liver should be firm and moist, with a shiny appearance 
and without any off-odor. It is most often sliced and sautéed or broiled and served 
with a sauce.
 Veal Kidneys
Veal kidneys are more popular in other parts of the world than in the United States. 
Good-quality kidneys should be plump, firm and encased in a shiny membrane. 
Properly prepared kidneys have a rich flavor and firm texture; they are best prepared by 
 moist-heat cooking methods and are sometimes used in stew or kidney pie. The hard, 
flavorful fat (suet) that collects on veal kidneys can be used in forcemeats, for barding 
and, when rendered, for deep-frying.
PURCHASING VEAL
Veal meat should be moist and fresh looking with a pale color. A large quantity of out￾side fat, marbling and fat that is yellow in color indicates that the calf was too old when 
slaughtered and the meat may be tough. Purchase veal only from reputable companies 
to ensure receiving a consistently high-quality product.
Because a veal carcass is small enough to be handled easily, it is sometimes pur￾chased in forms larger than the primal cuts described in this chapter. Depending on 
employee skill, available equipment, storage space and ability to utilize fully all the cuts 
and trimmings that fabricating meat produces, a chef may want to purchase veal in one 
of the following forms:
	▪ Foresaddle: The anterior (front) portion of the carcass after it is severed from the 
hindsaddle by a cut following the natural curvature between the eleventh and 
twelfth ribs. The foresaddle contains the primal shoulder, foreshank and breast 
and rib.
	▪ Hindsaddle: The posterior portion of the carcass after it is severed from the 
foresaddle. The hindsaddle contains the primal loin and leg.
	▪ Back: The trimmed rib and loin sections in one piece. The back is particularly 
useful when producing large quantities of veal chops.
	▪ Veal side: A single bilateral half of the carcass, produced by cutting lengthwise 
through the backbone.
NUTRITIONAL INFORMATION FOR VEAL
Like beef, veal is a major source of protein as well as niacin, zinc and B vitamins. Veal 
has less marbling than beef. When trimmed of any visible fat, veal is lower in fat and 
calories than comparable beef cuts. And it is leaner than many cuts of pork and poultry.

BASIC BUTCHERING PROCEDURES FOR VEAL
As noted earlier, because veal carcasses are relatively small, they are sometimes purchased as 
primal or other large cuts and fabricated in-house to the operation’s own specifications. See 
Table 15.1 for a list of standard fabricated veal cuts. Whole legs of veal can be easily broken 
down into a top round, eye round, knuckle, shank meat, butt tenderloin, sirloin, bottom 
round, bones and trimmings shown in Figure 15.3. A chef should master several important 
veal fabrication and butchering techniques such as boning a leg of veal and tying veal roasts.

Butt tenderloin

Bottom round
Figure 15.3 The completely boned-out veal leg produces a top round, eye round, 
knuckle, shank meat, butt tenderloin, sirloin, bottom round, bones and trimmings.
Procedure for Boning a Leg of Veal
➋ Remove the butt tenderloin from the inside 
of the pelvic bone.
➌ Remove the pelvic bone by carefully cutting 
around the bone, separating it from the meat. 
Continue until the bone is completely freed 
from the meat.
➊ Remove the shank by cutting through 
the knee joint. Remove the excess fat and 
flank meat.
Formula-Fed Veal 
versus Free-Range Veal
Most commercially produced veal is 
formula-fed veal. Formula-fed calves are 
fed primarily nutrient-rich liquids. Most 
farmers today house the calves, either 
alone or with a few others, in open pens 
with access to fresh air. Indeed, the use 
of crates and restricted confinement has 
been banned among producers since 
2018. To keep their flesh white, formula￾fed calves do not eat grasses and other 
foods containing iron. Free-range veal is 
produced from calves that are allowed 
to roam freely alongside their mothers, 
consuming milk, grasses and other 
natural foods. Because they consume 
iron, their flesh is a reddish pink and has 
a substantially different flavor than meat 
from formula-fed calves of the same age. 
This product is often marketed as rose 
veal or red veal.
Opinions differ on which type of veal 
has the better flavor. Some chefs prefer 
the consistently mild, sweet taste of 
formula-fed veal. Others prefer the more 
substantial flavor of free-range veal. The 
two are interchangeable in recipes. Cost, 
however, may be the deciding factor when 
determining which to use. Free-range veal 
is more expensive than formula-fed veal 
because of the higher cost of production.

Procedure for Cutting and Pounding Scallops
➍ With the inside of the leg up, remove the 
top round by cutting along the natural seam.
➎ Remove the shank meat. (It is the round 
piece of meat lying between the eye round and 
the bone, on the shank end of the leg.)
❻ Remove the round bone and the knuckle 
together by cutting around the bone and 
through the natural seams separating the 
knuckle from the other muscles. Separate the 
knuckle meat from the bone.
➐ Remove the sirloin. ➑ Remove the eye round from the bottom round.
➊ Veal scallops are cut from relatively large 
pieces of veal (in these photos, we begin with 
a portion of the top round). Trim all fat and 
silverskin. Going against the grain, cut slices 
approximately ¼ inch (3 millimeters) thick; cut 
on the bias to produce larger pieces.
➋ Place the scallops between two pieces of 
plastic wrap and pound lightly with a spreading 
motion to flatten and tenderize the meat. Be 
careful not to tear or pound holes in the meat.
M15_LABE1163_07_SE_C15.indd 387 31/10/23 7:51 PM388 CHAPTER FIFTEEN
Procedure for Cutting Émincé
Émincé is cut from relatively small, lean pieces 
of meat. Here veal is cut across the grain into 
small, thin slices.
Procedure for Boning a Veal Loin and Cutting It into Boneless Veal Chops
➊ Remove the tenderloin in a single piece from 
the inside of the loin by following the vertebrae 
and cutting completely around the tenderloin.
➋ From the backbone side, cut along the 
natural curve of the backbone, separating the 
loin meat from the backbone.
➌ Trim any excess fat from the loin, and trim 
the flank to create a 3-inch (7.5-centimeter) 
lip. Tightly roll up the loin with the flank on 
the outside.
➍ Tie the loin, using the procedure described 
next, at 1-inch (2.5-centimeter) intervals. Cut 
between the pieces of twine for individual 
boneless loin chops.
M15_LABE1163_07_SE_C15.indd 388 31/10/23 7:51 PMVEAl 389
Procedure for Tying Meats
➊ Cut a piece of string long enough to wrap 
completely around the loin. Holding one end 
between the thumb and forefinger, pass the 
other end around it and across the strings. loop 
the loose end of the string around your finger.
➋ Wrap the string around itself and pass the 
loose end back through the hole.
➌ Pull to tighten the knot. Adjust the string 
so it is snug against the meat.
➍ loop one end of the string around your 
thumb and forefinger. Reach through with your 
thumb and forefinger and pull the other string 
back through the loop. Pull both strings to 
tighten the knot, thus preventing the first knot 
from loosening. Trim the ends of the strings.
➎ Continue in this fashion until the entire loin 
is tied. The strings should be tied at even inter￾vals, just snug enough to hold the shape of the 
loin; they should not dig into or cut the meat.
Here we apply the tying procedure to a boneless veal loin; the same procedure can be used on 
any type of meat.
M15_LABE1163_07_SE_C15.indd 389 31/10/23 7:51 PM390 CHAPTER FIFTEEN
➊ Remove the sweetbreads from the court 
bouillon and allow them to cool.
➋ Using your hands, pull off any sinew or 
membranes that may be present on the surface 
of the sweetbreads.
➌ Wrap the sweetbreads in cheesecloth.
➍ Tie the ends with butcher’s twine. ➎ Place the wrapped sweetbreads in a half￾size hotel pan or similar container.
❻ Place another half-size hotel pan on top of 
the sweetbreads; place a weight in the pan to 
press the sweetbreads. Pressing sweetbreads in 
this manner improves their texture.
Procedure for Cleaning and Pressing Sweetbreads
Before fabrication, submerge the sweetbreads in cold milk or water, cover them and place in the 
refrigerator overnight to soak out any blood. Then poach them in a court bouillon for 20 minutes.
M15_LABE1163_07_SE_C15.indd 390 31/10/23 7:51 PMVEAl 391
Procedure for Cleaning Calves’ Liver
➊ Trim the large sinew and outer membrane 
from the bottom of the liver.
➋ Turn the liver over and peel the membrane 
off with your hands.
➌ The liver can be cut into thick or thin slices 
as needed.
➊ Split the kidneys lengthwise, exposing the 
fat and sinew.
➋ With a sharp knife, trim away the fat; the 
kidney is now ready for cooking.

 Safety Alert
Cooking with Alcohol
When alcohol comes into contact with 
a flame, it can ignite. To avoid singed 
eyebrows and kitchen fires, observe care 
when adding wine, liqueurs or liquor to 
a dish near the stove. When a dish calls 
for flambéing, stand away from the pan 
being flamed. Tilt the pan away from you, 
allowing the fumes to be ignited by the 
open flame. Be careful, as the flames can 
leap from the pan.

 After studying this chapter, 
you will be able to: 
16. 1 identify and characterize the primal and 
subprimal cuts of lamb 
16. 2 purchase lamb appropriate for your needs 
16. 3 describe nutritional information for lamb 
16. 4 describe and perform basic butchering 
procedures for lamb 
16. 5 explain appropriate cooking methods for 
common cuts of lamb 
L amb is the meat of sheep slaughtered when they are less than one year old. Both 
the meat and the animal, whether male or female, are referred to as lamb. meat 
from sheep slaughtered after 12 months of age is generally called mutton, although in 
some regions of Asia mutton refers to goat meat. 
 Even though lamb accounts for a small percentage of the meat consumed in the United 
States, many people who do not prepare lamb at home will order it in a restaurant. Because 
of its age, lamb meat is tender and can be prepared by almost any cooking method. Its 
strong, distinctive flavor allows chefs to offer bold, robust sauces and accompaniments that 
might mask the flavors of other meats. 
 PRIMAL AND SUBPRIMAL CUTS OF LAMB 
 After the young sheep is slaughtered, it is usually reduced to the five primal cuts: shoul￾der, breast, rack, loin and leg. Like some veal primals, lamb primals are crosscut sections 
and contain both bilateral halves (e.g., the primal leg contains both hind legs). 
 Figure  16. 1 illustrates the relationship between the lamb’s bone structure and the 
primal cuts. Knowing the location of bones when cutting or working with lamb (as well 
as all other types of meats) makes fabrication and carving easier and aids in identifying 
cuts. Figure  16. 2 shows the primal cuts of lamb and their location on the carcass. A lamb 
carcass generally weighs between 41 and 75 pounds (20 and 35 kilograms). 
 Lamb Shoulder 
 The primal lamb shoulder is a relatively large cut accounting 
for 36 percent of the carcass weight. The lamb shoulder 
contains the first four rib bones and the arm, blade and 
neck bones as well as many small, tough muscles 
whose grains travel in different directions. 
 All these bones and muscle groups make it nearly 
impossible to cook and carve a whole lamb shoulder. 
Although lamb shoulder may be cut into chops or boned 
and then roasted or braised, with or without stuffing, it is 
more commonly diced for stew or ground for patties. 
 Lamb Breast 
 The primal lamb breast contains the lamb breast and lamb foreshank portions of the car￾cass. Together they account for approximately 17 percent of the carcass weight and contain 
the rib, breast and shank bones. The primal lamb breast is located beneath the primal rack 
and contains the rib tips, which are cut off to produce the rack. When separated from the 
rest of the breast, these small ribs are called Denver ribs and can be substituted for pork 
ribs when desired. Although the breast is not used extensively in food service operations, it 
can be stuffed and braised, either bone-in or boneless. Lamb foreshanks are quite meaty 
and may be braised and served as an entrée, used for broths or ground. 
 Lamb Rack 
 The primal lamb rack is also known as the hotel rack . It is located between the 
primal shoulder and loin. Containing eight bilateral ribs (ribs 5–12) and portions of 
the backbone, it accounts for approximately 8 percent of the carcass weight. 
 The lamb rack is valued for its tender rib eye muscle. The hotel rack is usually split 
in half and trimmed before cooking so that each set of ribs can be easily cut into chops. 
The split racks can then be grilled, broiled or roasted as racks or cut into single or 
 Lamb shoulder

M16_LABE1163_07_SE_C16.indd 404 28/10/23 2:00 PMLAmB 405
double rib chops before cooking. Often the bones of the racks or individual chops are 
trimmed of excess fat, a technique called frenching . 
 Lamb Loin 
 The lamb loin is located between the primal rib and leg. It contains rib number 13 
and portions of the backbone as well as the loin eye muscle, tenderloin and flank. It 
accounts for approximately 13 percent of the carcass weight. 
 Except for the flank, lamb loin meat is very tender and is invariably cooked using a 
dry-heat method such as broiling, grilling or roasting. The loin may be boned to pro￾duce boneless roasts or chops or cut into chops with the bone in. The loin eye may be 
removed and cut into lamb medallions or noisettes, which may be prepared in the same 
manner as filet mignon and tenderloin of beef. 
 Lamb Leg 
 The primal lamb leg is a large section accounting for approximately 34 percent of the car￾cass weight. It is the posterior portion of the carcass, separated from the loin by a straight 
cut anterior to the hip bone cartilage. The primal includes both of an animal’s hind legs. 
As with veal, the cut of meat that would be the sirloin on a beef carcass is separated from 
the lamb loin by this cut and becomes part of the primal leg. The lamb leg contains several 
bones: the back bone, tail bone, aitch bone, hip bone, round bone and shank bones.

 Classic Lamb Flavors 
 Lamb and its fat have a pronounced 
flavor, which lends itself to pairing with 
garlic and resinous herbs such as mint, 
oregano and rosemary. many world 
cuisines incorporate some acid in their 
lamb preparations to balance fattiness; 
vinegar is the basic ingredient in mint 
sauce served with roasted lamb in 
Australia, Great Britain and New Zealand. 
Citrus juice, wine and yogurt are also 
used to brighten the flavor in lamb stews 
and sauces served with lamb. In North 
African tagine, Indian curry and classic 
French lamb navarin, the sweetness of 
dried fruits and root vegetables balances 
the fattiness of lamb.

Domestic (left) and New Zealand lamb chops (right)
The primal leg of lamb is rarely used as is. More 
often, it is split into two legs and partially or 
fully boned. Lamb legs are quite tender—
the sirloin end more so than the shank 
end—and are well suited to a variety 
of cooking methods. A bone-in leg of 
lamb is often roasted for buffet service 
or braised with vegetables or beans for a 
hearty dish. Lamb steaks can also be cut from the 
bone-in leg, with the sirloin end producing the most 
tender cuts. A boneless leg can be tied and roasted, with 
or without stuffing, or trimmed and cut into scallops. The 
shank end can be cut crosswise into sections containing a por￾tion of bone, with its marrow, and the muscles alongside the bone. Lamb shanks may be 
cut from the foreleg or the larger, meatier hind leg. Because they are relatively lean, lamb 
shanks are best prepared using moist heat, such as by braising. The shank meat can also be 
removed from the bone and diced for stew or ground for patties.
PURCHASING LAMB
When purchasing lamb, look for fine-textured, firm and red flesh. The meat should show 
some signs of marbling with white fat. Because lamb carcasses are so easily handled, 
purveyors often sell them whole or cut in a variety of ways to better meet their custom￾ers’ needs. As well as whole-carcass, primal and fabricated cuts, lamb can be purchased 
in the following forms:
	▪ Foresaddle: The anterior (front) portion of the carcass after it is severed from 
the hindsaddle by a cut following the natural curvature between the twelfth and 
thirteenth ribs. The lamb foresaddle contains the primal shoulder, breast and 
foreshank and rack.
	▪ Hindsaddle: The posterior portion of the carcass after it is severed from the foresaddle. 
The lamb hindsaddle contains the primal loin and legs together with 
the kidneys.
	▪ Back: The trimmed rack and loin sections in one piece. The back is particularly 
useful when producing large quantities of lamb chops.
	▪ Bracelet: The primal hotel rack with the connecting breast sections.
Domestic vs. Imported Lamb
Technologies that increase shelf life have made imported fresh lamb 
commonplace. Lamb imported from Australia and New Zealand 
accounts for nearly 50 percent of the lamb meat sold in the United 
States. Domestic lamb differs from imported lamb in a few ways. 
Domestic lamb is primarily grain fed and has a milder flavor than 
its grass-fed imported counterparts. And domestic lamb is raised to 
approximately 135 pounds, larger than imported lamb, resulting in 
larger cut sizes. Be aware that the cooking time may take twice as 
long for domestic rack of lamb as when cooking Australian or New 
Zealand rack of lamb.
Goat
Closely related to lamb is goat of the species Capra hircus. One of 
the first animals domesticated, this ruminant thrives in rocky moun￾tainous terrains, preferring scrub and bark to grass. Tender young 
suckling lamb young lamb that has never been 
fed any grass or grains
agneau pre-salé distinctively flavored lamb that 
grazes on salt marshes in France
spring lamb young lamb born in the early 
spring and slaughtered when 3 to 5 months 
old; spring lamb is often served roasted whole
M16_LABE1163_07_SE_C16.indd 406 28/10/23 2:00 PMLAmB 407
goat under one year of age is called kid. Most goats are bred for milk and cheese pro￾duction although goat meat is consumed in 75 percent of the world. In Mediterranean 
countries as well as in the West Indies, kid or goat is served whole and spit-roasted or in 
stews and curries. Commercially available kid and goat carcasses weigh between 15 and 
75 pounds (6.8 and 34 kilograms). Goat is available whole and in fabricated cuts. All goat 
meat sold in the United States is USDA inspected, but it is not graded for quality or yield.
Young kid or goat may be cooked using dry- or moist-heat cooking methods. 
Mature goat is best when prepared using moist-heat methods such as braising 
and stewing.
 NUTRITIONAL INFORMATION FOR LAMB
Lamb, a high-quality protein, may be purchased in subprimal cuts to be fabricated 
 on-site. Lean and lower in cholesterol than other red meat proteins, lamb is a good 
source of iron as compared with chicken, fish or poultry. Lamb has less marbling than 
other red meats. Its excess fat appears on the outside of many cuts and can easily be 
trimmed before cooking. Grass-fed lamb, like meat from other grass-fed ruminants, is 
high in the powerful antioxidant conjugated linoleic acid, identified as a cancer pre￾ventative. Goat meat is paler in color than lamb with little marbling. It has a nutritional 
profile comparable to chicken.
BUTCHERING PROCEDURES FOR LAMB
Lamb is unique among the common meat animals in that it is small enough to be han￾dled easily in its carcass form. Thus food service operations sometimes purchase lamb 
whole and fabricate the desired cuts themselves. This is practical if the operation has 
the necessary employee skills, equipment and storage space as well as a need for all the 
various cuts and trimmings that butchering a whole carcass produces.
Goat shank
Procedure for Cutting Lamb Noisettes (Medallions) from a Loin
➊ Remove the loin eye muscle by cutting 
down along the backbone and along the 
 vertebrae. Trim the eye muscle, leaving a thin 
layer of fat, which may be desirable if the meat 
will be grilled.
➋ Cut the eye meat into noisettes of the 
desired thickness.
M16_LABE1163_07_SE_C16.indd 407 28/10/23 2:00 PM408 CHAPTER SIXTEEN
Procedure for Trimming and Boning a Lamb Leg
➊ With the tip of the knife, trim around the 
pelvic bone; stay close to the bone to avoid 
wasting any meat. Cut the sinew inside the 
socket and remove the bone.
➋ Trim away most of the exterior fat.
➌ Cut off the meat from the shank portion 
and scrape the bone clean with the back of 
a knife. This makes a handle to hold while 
 carving the lamb.
➍ Fold the flap of the sirloin over on top of 
the ball of the leg bone and tie with butcher’s 
twine. This helps the leg cook evenly.
M16_LABE1163_07_SE_C16.indd 408 28/10/23 2:00 PMLAmB 409
Procedure for Boning a Lamb Loin
➊ Start with a trimmed lamb loin (double). 
With the skin side up, trim the thin layer of 
connective tissue called the fell from the 
loin’s surface.
➋ Turn the loin over and trim the fat from 
around the tenderloins.
➌ Starting in the middle of the backbone, 
cut between the tenderloin and the vertebrae, 
separating the tenderloin from the vertebrae 
but leaving the tenderloin attached to the 
flank. Continue until you reach the end of the 
vertebrae. Repeat on the other side.
➍ Slide the knife under the vertebrae and the 
rib and cut back all the way to the backbone, 
separating the eye muscle from the vertebrae.
➎ Pull the backbone out with your hands, 
keeping the loins intact.
➏ Turn the loins over and trim the surface fat 
to ¼ inch (6 millimeters).
➐ Roll the flank flaps under from each side. ➑ Tie the roast with butcher’s twine at 
even intervals.

Procedure for Frenching a Rack of Lamb
➊ With a meat saw, trim the ribs to approxi￾mately 3 inches (7.5 centimeters), measuring 
from the rib eye on each side of the rack.
➋ Turn the rack over and cut down both sides 
of the feather bones, completely separating the 
meat from the bone.
➌ Turn the rack back over. Using a meat saw, 
cut between the ribs and the chine bone (back￾bone or spine) at a 45-degree angle, exposing 
the lean meat between the ribs and the bones 
that run along the spine.
➎ make an even cut through the fat, perpen￾dicular to the ribs, 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) 
from the rib eye. Trim away all meat and fat 
from the rib ends. The ribs should be com￾pletely clean.
➏ Trim away the fat covering the rib eye 
leaving a thin layer to protect the meat during 
cooking. The rack can be roasted whole or cut 
into chops.
➍ By pulling and cutting along the natural 
seam, remove the thick layers of fat and the 
meat between the fat layers from the rack’s 
surface leaving an even layer of fat on the eye 
muscle.

Stuffing
many flavors of stuffing would work for 
a leg of lamb. Avoid raw meat, however, 
because it would not cook completely 
in the time it takes to roast the lamb 
to medium rare. For a more traditional 
flavor profile, use a simple mirepoix, or 
use fresh mint, oregano and lemon zest 
for a Greek version. A stuffing seasoned 
with Spanish paprika and diced cured 
chorizo offers an Iberian flavor.

 After studying this chapter, 
you will be able to: 
17. 1 identify and characterize the primal and 
subprimal cuts of pork 
17. 2 purchase pork appropriate for your needs 
17. 3 describe nutritional information for pork 
17. 4 describe and perform basic butchering 
procedures for pork 
17. 5 explain appropriate cooking methods for 
common cuts of pork 
 Pork is the meat of hogs, usually butchered before they are one year old. With the 
exception of beef, Americans consume more pork than any other meat. The pork 
we eat is leaner and healthier than it once was because of advances in breeding and 
feeding techniques. 
 Because hogs are butchered at a young age, their meat is generally very tender with a 
delicate flavor. Pork can be enjoyed cured, processed or fresh. The mild flavor of fresh pork 
blends well with many seasonings, making it a popular menu item. Pork is naturally tender 
and can be prepared by almost any dry-heat, moist-heat or combination cooking method. 
More than two-thirds of the pork marketed in the United States is cured (preserved) to pro￾duce products such as smoked hams and smoked bacon. Cured pork products are discussed 
in Chapter  28 , Charcuterie.
 PRIMAL AND SUBPRIMAL CUTS OF PORK 
 After a hog is slaughtered, it is generally split down the backbone. This divides the carcass 
into bilateral halves. Like the beef carcass, each side of the hog carcass is then further 
broken down into the primal cuts: shoulder, Boston butt, belly, loin and fresh ham. 
 Hogs are bred specifically to produce long loins. The loin contains the highest-quality 
meat and is the most expensive cut of pork. Pork is unique among meats in that the 
ribs and loin are considered a single primal. They are not separated into two different 
primals, as are the ribs and loin of beef, veal and lamb. 
 Figure  17. 1 illustrates the relationship between the hog’s bone structure and the pri￾mal cuts. Knowing the location of bones when cutting or working with pork (as well 
as all other types of meats) makes fabrication and carving easier and aids in identifying 
cuts. Figure  17. 2 shows the primal cuts of pork and their location on the carcass. A hog 
carcass generally weighs between 120 and 210 pounds (55 and 110 kilograms). 
 Pork Shoulder 
 The primal pork shoulder is the lower portion of the hog’s foreleg; it accounts for 
approximately 20  percent of the carcass weight. The shoulder contains the arm and 
shank bones and has a relatively high ratio of bone to lean meat. 
 Because all pork comes from hogs slaughtered at a young age, the shoulder is tender 
enough to be cooked by any method. It is, however, one of the least tender cuts of pork 
with a high percentage of connective tissue that requires long cooking. Pork shoulder is 
available smoked or fresh. The shoulder is fairly inexpensive and, when purchased fresh, 
it can be cut into shoulder butt steaks or boned and cut into smaller pieces for sauté￾ing or stewing. Whole pork shoulder is the cut preferred by many barbecue pit masters 
throughout the American South. 
 The pork foreshank is called the shoulder hock and is almost always smoked. 
Shoulder hocks are often simmered for long periods in soups, stews and braised dishes 
to add flavor and richness. When a pork shoulder includes the foreshank it is referred to 
as a picnic shoulder or picnic ham . 
 Boston Butt 
 The primal Boston butt is a square cut located just above the primal pork shoulder. It 
accounts for approximately 7 percent of the carcass weight. The Boston butt is very meaty 
and tender, with a good percentage of fat to lean meat. Containing only a small portion 
of the blade bone, the Boston butt is a good choice when a recipe calls for a solid piece 
of lean pork. The fresh Boston butt is sometimes cut into steaks or chops to be broiled or 
sautéed. When the Boston butt is smoked, it is usually boneless and called a cottage ham .

poultry with brine, dry air, salt, smoke or a 
combination of these methods 
 Boston butt 
M17_LABE1163_07_SE_C17.indd 424 28/10/23 1:56 PMPork 425
 Pork Belly 
 The primal pork belly is located below the loin. Accounting for approximately 16 per￾cent of the carcass weight, it is very fatty with only streaks of lean meat. It contains the 
spareribs, which are always separated from the rest 
of the belly before cooking. Pork spareribs
usually are sold fresh but can also be smoked. 
Containing less meat than back ribs from the 
loin, discussed later, and a generous amount 
of fat, which makes them tender, spareribs 
are simmered and then grilled or baked while 
being basted with a spicy barbecue sauce. The 
remainder of the boneless pork belly can be 
cured and smoked to produce bacon or it can 
be slow cooked by braising or roasting.

 Classic Pork Flavors 
 With a heavy layer of fat and many 
well-marbled cuts, pork benefits from 
robust seasonings that penetrate the 
meat. Pork shoulder and fresh leg roasts 
can be studded with garlic and strong 
herbs such as marjoram, oregano, 
rosemary or thyme before slow roasting. 
These cuts also lend themselves to the 
flavors of American barbecue (smoke, 
whiskey, sugar and salt curing) as well 
as spices used in Asian-style grilling 
(lemongrass, star anise, ginger, sesame oil 
and soy sauce). Lean cuts such as pork 
loin pair well with mild cream sauces 
flavored with mustard or herbs such as 
tarragon, as well as richer brown sauces 
and caramelized apples, fresh or dried 
stone fruits or mushrooms.

 Pork loin 
 Pork Loin 
 The pork loin is cut from directly behind the Boston butt and includes the entire rib 
section as well as the loin and a portion of the sirloin area. The primal loin accounts for 
approximately 20 percent of the carcass weight. It contains a portion of the 
blade bone on the shoulder end, a portion of the hip bone on the ham 
end, all of the ribs and most of the backbone. 
 The primal pork loin is the only primal cut of pork not typically 
smoked or cured. Most of the loin is a single, very tender pork eye 
muscle . A whole boneless pork loin weighs from 8 to 10 pounds 
(3.6 to 4.5 kilograms) and is covered on one side by a solid layer of 
fat, which can be trimmed away. Boneless pork loin is quite lean but 
contains enough intramuscular and subcutaneous fat to make it an excel￾lent choice for a combination cooking method such as braising, or it can be prepared 
with dry-heat cooking methods such as roasting or sautéing. 
 The most popular cut from the loin is the pork loin chop . 
Chops can be cut from the entire loin. The choicest chops are 
center-cut chops , which are cut from the primal loin after 
the blade bone and sirloin portions at the front and rear 
of the loin are removed. Double rib chops have the 
thickness of two ribs and may include two rib bones. 
The pork loin can be purchased boneless or boned 
and tied as a roast. A boneless pork loin is 
smoked to produce Canadian bacon . The 
rib bones, when trimmed from the loin, can 
be served as barbecued pork back ribs . 
Although smaller than spareribs, pork back 
ribs are meatier. 
 The loin also contains the pork tender￾loin, located on the inside of the rib bones 
 Pork Rib Identification 
 Consumers and chefs might be better informed 
about meat if the names used for various cuts 
were the same from one animal to another, and 
from one region or country to another. ribs are 
an especially confusing cut, which can come 
from either the primal pork loin or the primal 
pork belly. The following definitions can be 
helpful in identifying pork ribs: 
Baby back ribs: Lean, tender pork ribs cut from 
the top (spine) end of the ribs closest to, and 
often including a portion of, the loin meat. 
The word baby is used because they are small, 
only 3 to 6 inches (7.5 to 15 centimeters) long. 
Back ribs: Another name for baby back ribs 
or loin ribs. 
Country-style ribs: Meaty cuts from the loin 
near the shoulder; available either boneless 
or with a portion of the blade bone 
attached. These are not actual ribs. 
Rack: An entire row of ribs held together by 
meat, fat and cartilage; should contain at 
least 10 of the animal’s 13 rib bones. 
A rack of lamb ribs also includes loin 
meat and is the same cut as a pork rib 
roast or a standing rib roast of beef. 
Rib chops: Individual pork loin chops with 
the bone attached. The bone is often 
frenched for a nicer presentation. 
Riblets: Small, flat ribs made by cutting 
a full rack of pork or lamb ribs so that 
the bones are only about 2 inches 
(5 centimeters) long; often served as an 
appetizer. 
Rib tips: A narrow strip (1- to 3-inch [2.5- to 
7.5-centimeter]) cut from the lower end of 
the rib cage when producing St. Louis-style 
pork ribs. rib tips contain a good amount 
of cartilage, which makes them tougher. 
They are sometimes mistakenly called 
riblets. 
Short ribs: A term used for beef ribs only; not 
accurate when referring to pork spareribs. 
Slab: Slang term used to refer to a rack of 
pork ribs, especially on menus. Some chefs 
use the term slab to refer to an entire row of 
untrimmed ribs. 
Spareribs: A large portion of a rack of pork 
ribs including the St. Louis ribs and the rib 
tips, Spareribs are the whole rack without 
the baby back ribs. This term is not used for 
beef or lamb ribs. 
St. Louis-style ribs: Spareribs with the tougher 
rib tips removed; the meat is squared off so 
the rack is a more uniform rectangular shape.

Pork tenderloin
Fresh ham
Ham hocks
Pig’s feet (trotters)
on the sirloin end of the loin. The pork tenderloin is rather small, weighing only 
1–1½ pounds (450–680 grams). It is the most tender cut of pork with a mild flavor. 
The tenderloin is very versatile and can be trimmed, cut into medallions 
and sautéed, or the whole tenderloin can be roasted or braised.
Although not actually part of the primal loin, fatback is the thick 
layer of pork fat—sometimes more than 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) 
thick—between the skin and the lean eye muscle. It has a variety of 
uses in the kitchen, especially in the preparation of charcuterie items.
 Fresh Ham
The primal fresh ham is the hog’s hind leg. It is a rather large cut, 
accounting for approximately 24  percent of the carcass weight. 
The ham contains the aitch bone, leg bone and hindshank bones. 
Fresh ham, like the legs of other meat animals, contains large 
muscles with relatively small amounts of connective tis￾sue. Like many other cuts of pork, hams are often cured 
and smoked. But fresh hams also produce great roasts 
and can be prepared using almost any cooking method. 
When cured and smoked, hams are available in a variety 
of styles; they can be purchased bone-in, shankless or 
boneless and partially or fully cooked. Fully cooked hams 
are also available canned. There is a specific ham for nearly 
every use and desired degree of convenience.
Hocks and Trotters
Fresh ham hocks and pig’s feet (trotters) are not primal portions but are inexpensive, 
flavorful cuts that are gaining popularity among chefs. Ham hocks are round cross-cuts 
from the lower end of the rear leg (the ham) just above the foot. Cuts from the hog’s 
front legs may also be referred to as hocks, although they have less meat than those 
from the hind legs. Bone-in hocks are available fresh or cured and smoked for added 
flavor and a longer shelf life. Smoked hocks are used as a seasoning for stews and 
braised dishes.
Trotters are pig’s feet or hooves, made up of bone, connective tissue and a thick 
skin. Trotters are generally used to make gelatinous pork stock or added to dishes to 
flavor slow-cooked beans or vegetables, then removed and discarded. Trotters may also 
be cooked then pickled in brine and eaten as a snack. The meaty bits from hocks and 
trotters are used in rustic terrines such as Pennsylvania Dutch scrapple, and other pot￾ted meats.
PURCHASING PORK
When purchasing pork, look for firm, bright pink colored flesh. It should appear moist 
but not watery. Pale or gray coloration indicates lack of freshness. Meat from pork shoul￾ders and legs will be reddish pink in color and should display even fat marbling.
The farm-to-table movement has spawned an interest in chefs purchasing whole ani￾mals from local farms. Relatively small in size, thus easy to break down, pigs lend 
themselves to many uses on a restaurant’s menu. The challenge chefs face comes once 
the popular cuts—the loin, the shoulder roasts and ribs—have been served. Here some 
culinary ingenuity and experience are helpful. Pork trotters may be brined or pickled. 
Gelatin-rich trotters and pigs’ head enrich stocks. Fatty sections of pig skin can be ren￾dered to make crisp cracklings used as a garnish. And trim from any cut of pork may be 
used to make meatballs, rillettes, sausages and terrines.

Fresh and frozen pork is a time and temperature control for safety (TCS) food because 
it is both highly perishable and easily susceptible to contamination by pathogens. 
Therefore, proper storage is essential. Whole pigs or sides are generally less expensive 
than precut fresh or frozen products. But as with other foodstuffs, you should consider 
the menu, labor costs, storage facilities and employee skills when deciding which forms 
to purchase.
NUTRITIONAL INFORMATION FOR PORK
Like other meats, pork is a good source of protein, B vitamins, iron and other 
essential nutrients, but it is also high in fat, especially saturated fats. Through new 
breeding and feeding techniques, the fat content of pork has been reduced by 
16%, and saturated fat levels have decreased by 27%, over the past 30 years. Cuts 
from the loin, such as the tenderloin and boneless loin chops, meet government 
standards for “lean” or “extra lean” labeling. The sodium content of smoked and 
preserved pork products, such as bacon, ham and sausage, which are discussed in 
Chapter 28, Charcuterie, is high, but reduced-sodium preserved and smoked prod￾ucts are increasingly available.
BUTCHERING PROCEDURES FOR PORK
Other than suckling pigs and heritage breeds of pork produced on small-scale farms, 
pork products generally are not purchased in forms larger than the primal cuts described 
earlier. Chefs should master a few important pork fabrication and butchering techniques 
even though fabricated cuts are available.
Whole pork loins are broken down into cartilage, the tenderloin, boneless loin and 
loin bones as shown in Figure 17.4. From these cuts, roasts, chops, ribs, tenderloin and 
trim are fabricated.

Heritage Breeds
Heritage or heirloom breeds of pork 
form a special market segment that is 
gaining popularity in the United States. 
These breeds are based on older genetic 
strains from Europe, which are rarely 
used in commercial livestock production. 
The hogs vary considerably in flavor and 
fat content. For example, Berkshire hogs 
produce pork that is well marbled, moist 
and tender. Durocs have a bright pink flesh 
that is tender with a high pH, and red 
Wattles yield a moist but very lean flesh. 
Many farmers believe that protecting a 
genetically diverse population of livestock 
by raising and consuming such animals is 
important both culturally and scientifically. 
Consumers often find the taste of this type 
of pork more desirable. For example, the 
once obscure Mangalitsa is a wooly pig 
developed in Hungary over 200 years ago. 
The well-marbled meat of Mangalitsas is 
considered the pork equivalent of kobe beef 
because of its texture and the way it melts 
on the tongue. other rare breeds produced 
primarily for their fat include the Mulefoot 
and Guinea Hog. Because of their high 
fat content, such hogs are desirable for 
charcuterie products.
Scarcity and the longer time required for 
these heritage breeds to mature makes such 
hogs costly. Producers of niche pork, another 
term used to refer to these specialty breeds, 
generally use sustainable and organic farming 
practices. They often raise their hogs on free￾roaming farms and feed them vegetarian diets 
without hormones or antibiotics. Although 
the quantity of niche pork sold is miniscule, 
heirloom pork products have found a market 
with chefs and consumers who care more 
about taste and quality than cost.

 Procedure for Boning a Pork Loin 
➊ Starting on the sirloin end of a full pork 
loin, remove the tenderloin in one piece by 
making smooth cuts against the inside of 
the rib bones. Pull gently on the tenderloin 
as you cut. 
➋ Turn the loin over and cut between the 
ribs and the eye meat. Continue separating the 
meat from the bones, following the contours 
of the bones, until the loin is completely 
separated from the bones. 
➌ Trim around the blade bone on the 
shoulder end of the loin and remove it.

➊ Wrap the loose end of the string around 
the pork loin and tie it with a double knot.
➋ rotate the roast 180°. Make a loop and 
slide it down over the roast to approximately 
1 inch (2.5 centimeters) from the first knot.
➌ Make another loop and slide it down. 
Continue in this fashion until the whole roast 
has been tied.

➍ Turn the roast over and cut the string, 
leaving enough to wrap lengthwise around the 
roast to the original knot.
➎ Wrap the string around the end of the 
roast, then around the string that formed 
the last loop. Continue in this fashion for the 
length of the roast, pulling the string tight after 
wrapping it around each loop.
➏ Turn the roast back over. Wrap the string 
around the front end of the roast and secure it 
to the first loop at the point where you tied the 
first knot.
➐ The tied roast. Note the even intervals at 
which the strings are tied. They should be just 
snug enough to hold the shape of the roast; 
they should not dig in or cut the meat.

Procedure for Cutting a Pocket in a Pork Chop
Procedure for Cutting a Center-Cut Pork Chop
➊ Cut through the meat with the knife. ➋ Use the cleaver to chop through the chine 
bone.
➌ To produce a cleaner chop, trim the meat 
from the end of the rib bone. Then with the 
boning knife, separate the loin meat from the 
chine bones and separate the chine bone from 
the rib with the cleaver.
To make a pocket in a pork chop for stuffing, 
start with a thick chop or a double rib chop. 
Use the tip of a boning knife to cut a pocket. 
Cut the pocket deep enough to hold ample 
stuffing, but be careful not to puncture either 
surface of the chop.
Trim the fat and silverskin from the tenderloin 
following the procedures outlined in Chapter 14, 
Beef, for trimming a beef tenderloin. Use a 
 boning knife to remove the silverskin from a 
pork tenderloin.
A center-cut pork chop can be cut from the center portion of a bone-in pork loin without the 
aid of a saw by using a boning knife and a heavy cleaver. Trim the excess fat from the loin, 
leaving a ¼-inch (6-millimeter) layer to protect the meat during cooking.

Kebab
The term kebab (also known as kabob, 
shish kabab, shashlik and brochette) refers 
to grilling small pieces of meat on a 
skewer. Historians reason that in urban 
centers in the Middle East and Persia, 
where this style of cooking is thought 
to originate, fuel was in short supply. 
Therefore smaller cuts of meats were 
preferred because they could be cooked 
quickly and easily over portable charcoal 
grills or braziers. Threading the meat on 
skewers made turning the meat to cook 
it evenly feasible. Meat, poultry, fish and 
vegetables all lend themselves to this style 
of cooking. Because of the short cooking 
time, tender cuts should be used for 
kebabs. Marinating preserves moisture 
and adds flavor. When using bamboo 
skewers, soak them in water first to keep 
them from burning on the grill.
Pork Chimichurri Kebabs
YIELD 8 Servings of pork, 4 oz. (120 g) each,

approximately three-fourths of the Chimichurri Sauce and stir thoroughly. Cover and refrigerate for 
4 to 6 hours. reserve the remaining sauce to serve with the kebabs.
2 remove the pork from the marinade, discarding any marinade left in the pan. Arrange the pork on 
eight skewers. Cook on a hot grill, turning as necessary to cook thoroughly and brown evenly. Serve 
with black beans and rice and the reserved Chimichurri Sauce.
Note Boneless, skinless chicken or cubes of lamb shoulder meat can be used in place of the pork.

Jambalaya
A centerpiece of Louisiana Creole cooking, jambalaya is a rich stew of crab, shrimp, duck, chicken, 
pork, beef and vegetables in myriad combinations. Some historians claim that its name derives from 
the word jamón, Spanish for “ham,” because ham and rice are the two key ingredients that are 
found in all such stews. Tasso ham is made from lean pork, flavored with seasonings characteristic of 
Louisiana cooking, then heavily smoked. Use Canadian bacon or smoked ham if tasso is unavailable.

Sous Vide Sanitation
Food safety is of utmost concern when 
using sous vide techniques because of the 
low cooking temperatures. To prevent the 
growth of microorganisms, any food to 
be cooked sous vide must be chilled below 
the temperature danger zone (41°F/5°C) 
before cooking. keep all cutting boards, 
knives and food contact surfaces clean 
and sanitary and wear clean disposable 
gloves. Use only the freshest unblemished 
ingredients. Consult your local health 
department for regulations for preparing 
food sous vide. Special permission and a 
HACCP plan may be required.

Poultry is the collective term for domesticated birds bred for eating, including chick￾ens, ducks, geese, guineas, pigeons and turkeys. (Game birds such as pheasant, 
quail and partridge are described in Chapter  19 , Game; farm-raised ratites—
ostrich, emu and rhea—are discussed here.) The renowned French gastronome and author 
Jean-Anthelme Brillat-Savarin (1755–1826) once observed that “poultry is for the cook what 
canvas is for the painter.” Poultry can be cooked by almost any method, and its mild flavor 
goes well with a wide variety of sauces and accompaniments. Poultry is generally the least 
expensive and most versatile of all center-of-the-plate meats. 
 In this chapter we discuss the different kinds and classes of poultry and how to choose 
those that best suit your needs. In addition, we discuss how to store poultry properly to 
prevent food-borne illnesses and spoilage, how to butcher birds to produce specific cuts and 
how to apply a variety of cooking methods properly. 
 Many of the cooking methods discussed here have been applied previously to red meats. 
Although there are similarities with these methods, there are also many distinct differences. 
As you study this chapter, review the corresponding cooking methods for meats and note the 
similarities and differences. 
 MUSCLE COMPOSITION AND STRUCTURE 
OF POULTRY 
 The muscle tissue of poultry is similar to that of mammals in that it contains approxi￾mately 72 percent water, 20 percent protein, 7 percent fat and 1 percent minerals and it 
consists of bundles of muscle cells or fibers held together by connective tissue. Unlike 
red meat, poultry does not contain the intramuscular fat known as marbling. Instead, 
a bird stores fat in its skin, its abdominal cavity and the fat pad near its tail. Poultry 
fat is softer and has a lower melting point than other animal fats. It is easily rendered 
during cooking. 
 As with red meats, poultry muscles that are used more often tend to be tougher than 
those used less frequently. Also the muscles of an older bird tend to be tougher than 
those of a younger one. Because the majority of poultry is marketed at a young age, 
however, it is generally very tender. 
 The breast and wing flesh of chickens and turkeys is lighter in color than the flesh of 
their thighs and legs. For this reason, it is often referred to as “white meat.” This color 
difference is due to a higher concentration of the protein myoglobin in the thigh and 
leg muscles. Myoglobin is the protein that stores oxygen for the muscle tissues to use. 
More-active muscles require more myoglobin and tend to be darker than less-active 
ones. Because chickens and turkeys generally do not fly, their breast and wing muscles 
contain little myoglobin and are therefore a light color. Birds that do fly, such as ducks, 
have only dark meat. Dark meat also contains more fat and connective tissue than light 
meat and it takes longer to cook. 
 Skin color may vary from white to golden yellow, depending on what the bird 
was fed. Such color differences are not an indication of overall quality. Figure  18. 1 
illustrates the skeletal structure of a chicken, which is similar for other classes of 
poultry. Figure  18. 2 shows the relationship between the whole chicken and the parts 
cut from it.

IDENTIFYING CATEGORIES AND CLASSES 
OF POULTRY
The USDA recognizes six categories or kinds of poultry: chicken, duck, goose, guinea, 
pigeon and turkey. Each poultry category is divided into classes based predominantly 
on the bird’s age and tenderness. The sex of young birds is not significant for culinary 
purposes. The bird’s sex does matter, however, with older birds; older male birds are 
tough and stringy and have less flavor than older female birds. Tables 18.1 and 18.2 list 
identifying characteristics and suggested cooking methods for each of the categories and 
classes of poultry.
Chicken
Chicken (Fr. poulet; Sp. pollo) is the most popular and widely eaten poultry in the world. 
A chicken contains both light and dark meat and has relatively little fat. A young, tender 
chicken can be cooked by almost any method; an older bird is best stewed or braised. 
Chicken is extremely versatile and may be seasoned, stuffed, basted or garnished with 
almost anything. Chicken is also an economical substitute in many veal dishes. (See 
Chapter 15, Veal, for suggestions.) Chicken is inexpensive and readily available, fresh or 
frozen, in a variety of forms. Poussin is a French term for a small, immature chicken; in 
the United States, poussin is another name for a small chicken such as a Rock Cornish 
game hen.
The French poulet de Bresse is a special category of chicken, frequently touted as 
the world’s finest. The only Protected Designation of Origin (PDO)-certified chicken in 
the world, it is a blue-legged variety raised near the village of Bresse in southeastern 
Burgundy. These free-range birds are fed a special diet of grains and milk products. An 
identifying leg band is attached to each young chick, and authentic birds are sold with 
the banded leg attached. They are exported around the world by specialty food com￾panies and are now being grown in the United States on small farms and marketed as 
American Bresse.

Roaster duckling
Young goose
Turkey
Duck
The ducks (Fr. canard) used most often in commercial food service 
operations are roaster ducklings of the Pekin or Long Island 
breed. These ducks contain only dark meat and large 
amounts of fat. To make the fatty skin palatable, it is 
important to render as much fat as possible. Duck 
fat can be reserved to use for flavor when sautéing 
potatoes or mirepoix, or for making Duck Confit 
(page 495). Duck has a high percentage of bone 
and fat to meat; therefore, a 4-pound duck serves 
only two people, whereas a 4-pound roasting 
chicken serves four to six people.
For a larger duck breast with a richer, meatier flavor, 
chefs prefer the Moulard, also known as Mullard, a hybrid of the Pekin 
and Muscovy breeds. (The Muscovy is a lean, thin-skinned 
South American breed with a strong, musky flavor.) The 
Moulard’s large breast, called a magret, has a rich fla￾vor and a texture similar to beef. The magret may 
be smoked whole or cooked by grilling, roasting 
or pan-searing. Moulards are also the source 
for foie gras [fwah grah]. (See page 453.)
Goose
A goose (Fr. oie) contains only dark 
meat and has very fatty skin. It is usually 
roasted at high temperatures to render the 
fat. Roasted goose is popular at holidays and 
is often served with an acidic fruit-based sauce to 
offset the fattiness.
Guinea Fowl
A guinea or guinea fowl (Fr. pintade) is the domesticated descendant of a large African 
game bird. It has both light and dark meat and a flavor similar to pheasant. Guinea is 
tender enough to sauté. Because it contains little fat, a guinea is usually barded (covered 
with thin slices of pork fatback as shown on page 871) before roasting. Guinea, which is 
relatively expensive, is not as popular in the United States as it is in Europe.
Pigeon
The young pigeon (Fr. pigeon) used in commercial food service operations is referred to 
as squab. Its meat is dark, tender and well suited for broiling, sautéing or roasting. Squab 
has very little fat and benefits from barding. (See page 324.)
Turkey
Turkey (Fr. dinde) is the second most popu￾lar category of poultry in the United States. It 
has both light and dark meat and a relatively 
small amount of fat. Younger turkey is an 
economical option and can be prepared 
with almost any cooking method.
Ratites
Ratites are a family of flightless birds with 
small wings and flat breastbones. They include 
the ostrich (which is native to Africa), the emu
(native to Australia) and the rhea (native to South 
roaster duckling a duck of either sex 
slaughtered before it is sixteen weeks old. Fryer 
and broiler ducklings are slaughtered before 
eight weeks of age and still retain their soft bill 
and windpipe.

America). Ratite meat, which is classified as red meat even though it is poultry, is a dark, 
cherry-red color with a flavor similar to beef; it is a little sweeter and has a soft texture. 
Ratite meat is low in fat and calories. Popular cuts generally come from the back (which 
contains the very tender tenderloin), the thigh (also known as the fan) and the leg and 
are available as steaks, filets, medallions, roasts, cubes or ground.
The more tender cuts, such as those from the back or thigh, can be marinated and 
then cooked by dry-heat cooking methods, especially broiling, grilling, roasting and 
pan-frying. Because it has little fat, care must be taken to avoid overcooking, and these 
products are usually served medium rare to medium. Allowing these products to rest 
after cooking helps to ensure tenderness. Tougher cuts, such as those from the leg, are 
best ground or prepared with combination cooking methods.
Livers, Gizzards, Hearts and Necks
Poultry livers, gizzards, hearts and necks are commonly referred to as giblets and can 
be used in a variety of ways. Gizzards (a bird’s second stomach), hearts and necks are 
often used to make giblet gravy. Gizzards are sometimes trimmed and deep-fried; hearts 
are sometimes served sautéed and creamed. Necks are very flavorful and can be added 
to stocks for richness. In contrast, livers, hearts and gizzards are not added to stocks 
because of their strong flavors. Chicken livers are often made into pâtés or sautéed or 
broiled with onions and served as an entrée.
Foie Gras
Foie gras is the enlarged liver of a duck or goose. Considered a delicacy since Roman 
times, foie gras is produced by methodically fattening the birds by force-feeding them 
specially prepared corn while limiting their activity. Fresh foie gras consists of two 
lobes that must be separated, split and deveined. Good foie gras is smooth, round and 
 putty-colored. It should not be yellow or grainy. Goose foie gras is lighter in color and 
more delicate in flavor than that of duck. Duck foie gras has a deeper, winy flavor and is 
more widely available than goose foie gras. Fresh foie gras can be grilled, roasted, sau￾téed or made into pâtés or terrines. No matter which cooking method is used, be careful 
not to overcook the liver. Foie gras is so high in fat that overcooking results in the liver 
literally melting away. Most foie gras is pasteurized or canned and may consist of solid 
liver or small pieces of liver compacted to form a block.
NUTRITIONAL INFORMATION FOR POULTRY
Poultry is an economical source of high-quality, easily digestible protein. Poultry’s nutri￾tional values are similar to those of other meats, except that chicken and turkey breast 
meat are higher in mono- and poly-unsaturated fats than other lean meats. Poultry is a 
good source of vitamins A, C and the B complex group. Generally, dark meat contains 
more niacin and riboflavin than white meat. Much of the fat in poultry is found in the 
skin, which can be easily removed before cooking for a leaner dish.
INSPECTION AND GRADING OF POULTRY
All poultry produced for public consumption in the United States is subject to USDA 
inspection. Inspections ensure that products are processed under strict sanitary guide￾lines and are wholesome and fit for human consumption. Inspections do not indicate a 
product’s quality or tenderness. The round inspection stamp illustrated in Figure 18.3 is 
found either on a tag attached to the wing or on the package label.
Grading poultry is voluntary but virtually universal. Birds are graded according to 
their overall quality, with the grade (USDA A, B or C) shown on a shield-shaped tag 
affixed to the bird or on a processed product’s packaging. (See Figure 18.4.)

M18_LABE1163_07_SE_C18.indd 453 03/11/23 5:47 PM454 CHAPTER EIGHTEEN
According to the USDA, Grade A poultry is free from deformities, with thick flesh and 
a well-developed fat layer; free of pinfeathers, cuts or tears and broken bones; free from 
discoloration and, if it is frozen, free from defects that can occur during handling or stor￾age of frozen foods. Nearly all poultry used in wholesale and retail outlets is Grade A. 
Grade B and C birds are used primarily for processed poultry products.
Quality grades have no bearing on the product’s tenderness or flavor. A bird’s tender￾ness is usually indicated by its class (e.g., a young turkey is younger and more tender 
than a yearling).
PURCHASING AND STORING POULTRY
Poultry can be purchased in many forms: fresh or frozen, whole or cut up, bone-in 
or boneless, skin-on or skinless, ground, portion controlled (P.C.) or individually 
 quick-frozen (IQF). Chicken and turkey are also widely used in prepared and conve￾nience items and are available fully cooked and vacuum-sealed or boned and canned. 
Although purchasing poultry in a ready-to-use form is convenient, it is not always nec￾essary; poultry products are easy to fabricate and portion. Fresh and frozen poultry is 
a time and temperature control for safety (TCS) item because it is both highly perish￾able and easily susceptible to contamination by pathogens. Therefore, proper storage 
is essential.
Whole poultry items are generally less expensive than precut fresh or frozen prod￾ucts. But as with other foodstuffs, you should consider the menu, labor costs, storage 
facilities and employee skills when deciding which forms to purchase. In addition to 
economics, other considerations when purchasing poultry include the variety and how 
the birds are raised and processed, as discussed here.
Free-Range Poultry
Chicken has become increasingly popular in recent years, in part because it is less 
expensive, more versatile and considered healthier than red meat. To meet an increas￾ing demand, chickens are raised indoors in huge houses that may contain as many as 
30,000 birds. They are fed a specially formulated mixture composed primarily of corn 
and soybean meal. Animal protein, vitamins, minerals and small amounts of antibiotics 
are added to produce quick-growing, healthy birds.
Many consumers feel that the flavor of chickens and other poultry raised this way is 
not as good as the flavor of poultry that is allowed to move freely and forage for food. In 
addition some consumers are concerned about the birds’ harsh living conditions and the 
residual effects of the vitamins, minerals and antibiotics added to the chicken feed. To 
meet the demand for chickens and poultry raised the more traditional way, some farmers 
now specialize in free-range and pasture-raised poultry.
Although the USDA has not standardized regulations for free-range poultry, gen￾erally birds that are allowed access to an area outside the chicken house can be 
labeled for sale as “free-range.” In some cases this means simply that they were raised 
without cages with limited access to the outdoors. The term pasture-raised generally 
refers to birds that have been raised outdoors with access to fresh vegetation, although 
this term is not standardized. Some poultry farms go beyond government require￾ments and raise birds without antibiotics, feeding them a vegetarian diet (no animal 
fat or by-products), allowing them to forage for food, employing more humane 
 growing methods, and processing them without preservatives. True free-range chick￾ens are marketed at 9–10 weeks old and weigh 4½–5 pounds (2–2½ kilograms), 
which is considerably more mature and heavier than conventional broilers. They 
may be sold with heads and feet intact and are more expensive than conventionally 
raised chickens.
 Safety Alert
Sanitation and Cross￾Contamination
Review the information in Chapter 2, 
Food Safety and Sanitation, before 
handling any poultry. All work surfaces, 
cutting boards, knives, hands and other 
equipment used to prepare poultry 
products must be clean and sanitary. 
Make sure that juices and trimmings from 
poultry do not come in contact with other 
foods. Anything that comes in contact 
with raw poultry should be cleaned and 
sanitized before it comes in contact 
with any other food. Cooked foods 
should never be placed in containers 
that were used to hold the raw product. 
Kitchen towels used to handle poultry 
or clean up after butchering must be 
sanitized before being reused to prevent 
cross-contamination.

Air-Chilled Poultry
After poultry is slaughtered, it must be cleaned then chilled. To do so, the carcasses 
are typically submerged in a series of iced water baths to reduce the core temperature 
to safe temperatures below 40°F (4°C) within 4 hours of death. During processing 
the poultry absorbs moisture, particularly in its skin, and may be subjected to cross￾contamination from the water bath. An alternative method, called air chilling, uses 
cold purified air to reduce the core temperature of the birds. The poultry carcasses are 
suspended in chambers where circulating cold air rapidly cools them. Proponents of air 
chilling, which is more costly and time consuming than water chilling, praise the flavor 
and crisp skin of poultry processed using this method. Because air chilling reduces both 
water consumption and the risk of cross-contamination during processing, it is viewed 
as better for consumers and the environment.
Storing Poultry
Poultry requires time and temperature control for safety (TCS). Because it is highly perish￾able and particularly susceptible to contamination by salmonella bacteria, poultry must 
be stored at the correct temperatures. Fresh chickens and other small birds can be stored 
on ice or at 32–34°F (0–2°C) for up to 2 days; larger birds can be stored up to 4 days at 
these temperatures. Frozen poultry should be kept at 0°F (–18°C) or below (the colder 
the better) and can be held for up to 6 months. Whole birds should be thawed gradually 
under refrigeration, allowing 2 days for chickens and as long as 4 days for larger birds. 
Store uncooked poultry on the lowest refrigerator shelves to avoid having it drip onto 
other foods. (See Figure 2.8, page 32.)
Never attempt to cook poultry that is still partially frozen; it will be impossible to 
cook the product evenly, and the areas that were still frozen may not reach the tem￾peratures necessary to destroy harmful bacteria. Never partially cook poultry one day 
and finish cooking it later; pathogenic bacteria are more likely to grow under such 
conditions.
BUTCHERING PROCEDURES FOR POULTRY
Poultry is easier to butcher than meats and is often processed on-site. You should 
be able to perform the following commonly encountered procedures. Because the 
different kinds of poultry are similar in structure, these procedures apply to a variety 
of birds.
Heritage Breed Poultry
Chicken breeders and farmers are trying to 
bring back breeds of poultry that fell out of 
favor when meaty, quick-growing hybrids 
that are suitable to mass production were 
introduced. Rhode Island Red, Wyandotte 
and Jersey Giant chickens are among 
the American heritage breeds regaining 
popularity. To bring attention to these 
varieties, the livestock Conservancy has 
defined heritage poultry as breeds with the 
following traits: The breeds must have been 
on the American Poultry Association’s list 
prior to 1950; they must mate naturally; they 
must be slow-growing (taking no less than 16 
weeks to mature); and they must have a long, 
productive outdoor life.
The main reason for cooking with heritage 
breeds is their flavor, which is rich and 
intense. These breeds generally have thicker 
skin and darker meat than commercial 
chickens. Many breeds yield very lean meat 
that is not suitable for every cooking method. 
When deciding how to best serve heritage 
chicken, purchase and prepare a few to test 
which cooking method is suitable. Moist￾heat cooking methods such as braising may 
be preferable to grilling. When roasting a 
heritage chicken, consider barding the bird 
with fat or bacon and trussing the bird to 
compensate for its leanness.

Procedure for Cutting a Bird in Half
➊ Square up the bird by placing it on its back 
and pressing on the legs and breast to create a 
more uniform appearance.
➋ Place the bird on its breast and hold the 
tail tightly with the thumb and forefinger of one 
hand. using a rigid boning knife and in a single 
swift movement, cut along the backbone from 
the bird’s tail to the head.
➌ lay the bird flat on the cutting board 
and remove the backbone by cutting through 
the ribs connecting it to the breast using a 
chef ’s knife.
Often the first step in preparing poultry is to cut the bird in half. Broiler and fryer chickens are 
split to make two portions. This procedure removes the backbone and breastbone (also known 
as the keel bone) for a neater finished product.
➍ Bend the bird back, breaking the 
breastbone free.
➎ Run your fingers along the breastbone to 
separate the breast meat from the bone; pull 
the bone free. Be sure to remove the flexible 
cartilage completely.
❻ Cut through the skin to separate the bird 
into two halves. The halves are ready to be 
cooked; for a more attractive presentation, 
follow Steps 7 and 8.
❼ Trim off the wing tips and the ends of the 
leg bone.
❽ Make a slit in the skin below the leg and 
tuck the leg bone into the slit.

Procedure for Cutting a Bird into Pieces
Cutting a bird into pieces is one of the most common butchering procedures. Reviewing the 
bird’s structure in Figures 18.1 and 18.2 will help you find each joint and simplify the process of 
cutting poultry.
➊ Remove the leg by pulling the leg and thigh 
away from the breast and cutting through the 
skin and flesh toward the thigh joint using a 
rigid boning knife.
➋ Cut down to the thigh joint, twist the leg 
to break the joint and cut the thigh and leg 
from the carcass. Be careful to trim around 
the oyster meat (the tender morsel of meat 
located next to the backbone); leave it attached 
to the thigh. Repeat with the other leg.
➌ To split the breast, follow Steps 2 through 
5 in the procedure for cutting a bird in half. Cut 
the breast into two halves.
➍ The bird is now cut into four quarters. ➎ To cut the bird into six pieces, separate the 
thigh from the leg by making a cut along the 
line of fat on the inside of the thigh and leg.
❻ To cut the bird into eight pieces, separate 
the wing from the breast by cutting the joint, or 
split the breast, leaving a portion of the breast 
meat attached to the wing.

Procedure for Preparing a Suprême or Airline Breast
A chicken suprême or airline breast is half of a boneless chicken breast with the first wing 
bone attached. The tip of the wing bone is removed, yielding a neat and attractive portion that 
can be prepared by a variety of cooking methods. The skin can be left on or removed.
➊ Remove the legs following Steps 1 and 2 
in the procedure for cutting a bird into pieces. 
Place the chicken on its back. locate the 
wishbone, trim around it and remove it.
➋ Cut along one side of the breastbone, 
separating the meat from the bone.
➌ Following the natural curvature of the ribs, 
continue cutting to remove the meat from the 
bones.
➍ When you reach the wing joint, cut 
through the joint, keeping the wing attached 
to the breast portion. Cut the breast free from 
the carcass.
➎ Make a cut on the back of the joint 
between the first and second wing bones.
❻ Break the joint and pull the meat and 
skin back to expose a clean bone. Trim the 
wing bone.
❼ The suprême can be prepared skin-on 
or skinless.

Procedure for Preparing a Boneless Breast
A boneless chicken breast is one of the most versatile and popular poultry cuts. It can be broiled, 
grilled, baked, sautéed, pan-fried or poached. Boneless turkey breast can be roasted or sliced 
and sautéed as a substitute for veal. The skin can be removed or left intact. The breast can be left 
in one piece, known as a double breast, or cut into two pieces.
➊ Place the chicken on its back. Remove 
the legs and the backbone following Steps 1 
and 2 in the procedure for cutting a bird 
into pieces. Remove the keel bone from the 
bone-in breast, following Steps 2–5 in the 
procedure for cutting a bird in half.
➋ With the chicken breast lying skin side down, 
separate the rib bones, wing and wishbone from the 
breast. leave the two tender pieces of meat known 
as the tenderloins attached to the breast. Repeat 
the procedure on the other side, being sure to 
remove the small wishbone pieces from the front of 
the breast.
➌ Cut through the meat and skin to separate 
the chicken breast into two pieces. The skin 
may be left intact or removed to produce a 
skinless boneless breast.
➊ Carefully cut through the skin, meat and 
tendons at the base of the leg. Be sure to cut 
through to the bone.
➋ Pull the skin off the leg with your hands, 
then break the joint between the leg and thigh. 
Twist and pull out the leg bone.
➌ Working from the inside of the thigh bone, 
separate the bone from the meat.
➍ Cut around the cartilage at the joint 
between the leg and thigh and remove the thigh 
bone and cartilage.
Procedure for Boning a Chicken Leg and Thigh
Chicken legs and thighs are economical and often used in stews and braised dishes. Boneless 
legs and thighs can be stuffed or used for ballotines. ballotine [bahl-lo-TEEN]; classic French 
preparation made by stuffing a deboned 
poultry leg with forcemeat; it is poached or 
braised and served hot; similar to a galantine, 
which is served cold

DRY-HEAT COOKING METHODS FOR POULTRY
The cooking methods discussed in Chapter 10, Principles of Cooking, and applied to meats 
in previous chapters also apply to poultry. Cooking poultry with dry-heat methods—
broiling, grilling, roasting, sautéing, pan-frying and deep-frying—presents some unique 
challenges. Large birds such as turkeys benefit from low-heat cooking but are better 
when served with the crispy skin produced by higher temperatures. Duck and goose 
skins contain a great deal of fat that must be rendered during cooking. Small birds such 
as squab must be cooked at sufficiently high temperatures to crisp their skins but can 
be easily overcooked. Boneless chicken breasts, particularly flavorful and popular when 
broiled or grilled, are easily overcooked and become dry because they are lean and do 
not retain moisture during cooking in the absence of bones. Chicken legs, although fat￾tier than breast meat, require longer cooking time to tenderize them. Proper application 
of the dry-heat cooking methods described in this chapter will help meet these chal￾lenges and ensure a good-quality finished product.
Marinating Poultry
Most poultry is quite mild in flavor. A marinade or brine adds flavor and moisture, espe￾cially to poultry that will be cooked with dry-heat methods. Brines, which are discussed 
in Chapter 9, Mise en Place, are commonly used to flavor whole birds, such as roast 
turkey or chicken. Typical poultry marinades are often flavorful mixtures of white wine 
or citrus juice, oil, salt, pepper, herbs and spices used to prepare pieces of poultry for 
grilling or baking.
Classic Poultry 
Flavors
Ever versatile, chicken can be flavored 
with delicate herbs or robust, fiery spices. 
When roasted, chicken benefits from a 
simple grating of salt and pepper. light 
sauces made from pan juices or velouté 
accented with tender herbs, lemon 
and white or black pepper are typical 
accompaniments that enhance the pure 
flavor of the poultry. But skin-on chicken 
pieces withstand marinating in wet or dry 
spice mixtures before grilling, roasting 
or stewing. Spice blends from adobo 
to garam masala can be used with any 
type of poultry. The versatility of poultry 
may account for its popularity. Dark 
meat from turkey legs can substitute for 
lamb or pork in kebabs or stews. And 
boneless skinless chicken or turkey breast, 
when sliced thinly and pounded, makes 
excellent cutlets.

Poultry absorbs flavors quickly, so if pieces are left too long in an acidic marinade, 
they may take on undesirable flavors. Two hours is often sufficient. Smaller pieces 
require less time in the marinade than larger ones. The texture of the protein will be 
affected by the acid in the marinade; marinating for more than a few hours can make 
poultry flesh mushy. Avoid using excess marinade because it becomes contaminated and 
must be discarded after use. To help calculate the quantity of marinade to make, expect 
to use approximately 8 fluid ounces (240 milliliters) marinade for each double breast of 
chicken. When brining a whole bird, it must be fully submerged in the liquid, so a large 
plastic container is typically used.

If the marinade contains oil, drain the poultry well to avoid flare-up when the item is 
placed on the broiler or grill. Use a clean kitchen towel or a paper towel to wipe excess 
moisture from the poultry’s surface so that it browns more easily. The marinade can 
be used to baste the item during cooking, but leftover marinade should not be served 
uncooked or reused because of the danger of contamination from the raw poultry.
Broiling and Grilling Poultry
Broiled and grilled poultry should have a well-browned surface and show crosshatched 
grill marks. It should be moist, tender and juicy throughout. It may be seasoned to 
enhance its natural flavors or marinated or basted with any number of flavored butters 
or sauces.
Selecting Poultry to Broil or Grill
Smaller birds such as Cornish game hens, chickens and squab are especially well suited 
for broiling or grilling. Whole birds should be split or cut into smaller pieces before 
cooking; their joints may be broken so that they lie flat. Quail and other small birds can 
be skewered before being broiled to help them cook evenly and retain their shape. Be 
especially careful when cooking breast portions or boneless pieces; the direct heat of the 
broiler or grill can overcook items very quickly.
Seasoning Poultry to Broil or Grill
Poultry is fairly neutral in flavor and responds well to marinating. Poultry may also be 
basted periodically during the cooking process with flavored butter, oil or barbecue 
sauce. At the very least, broiled or grilled poultry should be well seasoned with salt and 
pepper just before cooking.
Determining Doneness of Broiled and Grilled Poultry
With the exception of duck breasts and squab, which are sometimes left pink, broiled 
or grilled poultry is cooked well done. This makes the poultry particularly susceptible 
to becoming dry and tough because it contains little fat and is cooked at very high tem￾peratures. Particular care must be taken to ensure that items do not become overcooked.
Four methods are used to determine the doneness of broiled or grilled poultry:
	▪ Touch: When poultry is done, it will have a firm texture, resist pressure and 
spring back quickly when pressed with a finger.
	▪ Temperature: Use an instant-read thermometer to determine the item’s internal 
temperature. This may be difficult because of the item’s size and the heat from 
the broiler or grill. Insert the thermometer in the thickest part of the item away 
from any bones. It should read 165–170°F (74–77°C) at the coolest point.
	▪ Looseness of the joints: When bone-in poultry is done, the leg moves freely in its 
socket.
	▪ Color of the juices: Poultry is done when its juices run clear or show just a trace of 
pink. This degree of doneness is known in French as à point.
Accompaniments to Broiled and Grilled Poultry
If the item was basted with an herb butter, it can be served with additional butter; if 
the item was basted with barbecue sauce, it should be served with the same sauce. Be 
careful, however, that any marinade or sauce that came in contact with the raw poultry 
is not served unless it is cooked thoroughly to destroy harmful bacteria. A wide variety 
of sauces are suitable for broiled and grilled poultry. Sauce suggestions are listed in 
Table 11.6 on page 244.
Broiled or grilled poultry is versatile and goes well with almost any side dish. Seasoned 
and grilled vegetables are a natural accompaniment, and deep-fried potatoes are com￾monly served.

Procedure for Broiling or Grilling Poultry
like red meats, broiled or grilled poultry can be prepared by placing items directly on the grate. 
Poultry is also often broiled using a rotisserie.
1 Heat the broiler or grill.
2 use a wire brush to remove any charred or burnt particles that may be stuck to the broiler 
or grill grate. The grate can be wiped with a lightly oiled towel to remove any remaining 
particles and help season it.
3 Prepare the item to be broiled or grilled by marinating or seasoning as desired; it may be 
brushed lightly with oil to keep it from sticking to the grate.
4 Place the item on the grate, presentation side (skin side) down. Following the example 
in Chapter 10, Principles of Cooking, turn the item to produce the attractive crosshatch 
marks associated with grilling. Baste the item often. use tongs to turn or flip the item 
without piercing the surface so that juices do not escape.
5 Develop the proper surface color while cooking the item until it is done à point. To do so, 
adjust the position of the item on the broiler or grill, or adjust the distance between the 
grate and heat source. large pieces and bone-in pieces that are difficult to cook completely 
on the broiler or grill can be finished in the oven.
A commonly used procedure to cook a large volume of poultry is to place the 
seasoned items in a broiler pan or other shallow pan and place the pan directly under 
the broiler. Baste the items periodically, turning them once when they are halfway 
done. Items begun this way can be easily finished by transferring the entire pan to 
the oven.

 Roasting Poultry
Properly roasted (or baked) poultry is attractively browned on the surface and tender 
and juicy throughout. Proper cooking temperatures ensure a crisp exterior and juicy inte￾rior. Most roasted poultry is cooked until the juices run clear. Squab and duck breasts are 
exceptions; they are often served medium rare or pink.
Selecting Poultry to Roast
Almost every kind of poultry is suitable for roasting, but younger birds produce a more 
tender finished product. Because of variations in fat content, different kinds of poultry 
require different roasting temperatures and procedures.
Seasoning Poultry to Roast
Although the mild flavor of most poultry is enhanced by a wide variety of herbs and 
spices, roasted poultry is often only lightly seasoned with salt and pepper. Whole birds 
may be soaked in light brine for 2–8 hours before roasting to retain moisture and tender￾ize the meat. (See Chapter 9, Mise en Place.) Poultry that is roasted at high temperatures 
should never be seasoned with herbs on its surface because the high cooking tempera￾tures will burn them. If herbs or additional spices are used, they should be stuffed into 
the cavity. A mirepoix or a bouquet garni may also be added to the cavity for additional 
flavor. The cavities of dark-fleshed birds such as ducks and geese are often stuffed with 
fresh or dried fruits.

45-degree angle to the grates.

Chicken Wisdom
“To know how to cook is to understand 
a recipe so that it can be expressed in 
different terms, at changing levels of 
sophistication for different occasions,” 
writes Chef Jacques Pépin of preparing 
roast chicken. When served with a plain 
green salad, he calls a roast chicken cuisine 
bourgeoise, home-style cooking. Garnished 
with a sauce made from its pan juices, the 
chicken is casual dinner fare. When the 
roasting pan is deglazed with cognac and 
sautéed mushrooms and cream are added, 
the bird is transformed into haute cuisine, 
for more formal occasions. “This ability 
to extend or vary a basic dish is essential 
to the work of good cooks and enables 
them to change the cost of a meal or alter 
the calorie count at will,” he writes. What 
does not vary is the skill needed to properly 
roast a chicken, a technique by which chefs 
are often judged.
M18_LABE1163_07_SE_C18.indd 463 03/11/23 5:47 PM464 CHAPTER EIGHTEEN
Procedure for Trussing Poultry
➊ Square up the bird by pressing it firmly 
with both hands. Tuck the first joint of the wing 
behind the back or trim off the first and second 
joints as shown.
➋ Cut a piece of butcher’s twine 
approximately three times the bird’s length. 
With the breast up and the neck toward you, 
pass the twine under the bird approximately 
1 inch (2.5 centimeters) in front of the tail.
➌ Bring the twine up around the legs and 
cross the ends, creating an X between the legs. 
Pass the ends of the twine below the legs.
➍ Pull the ends of the twine tightly across the 
leg and thigh joints and across the wings if the 
first and second joints are trimmed off, or just 
above the wings if they are intact.
Trussing is tying a bird into a more compact shape with thread or butcher’s twine. Trussing 
allows the bird to cook more evenly, helps the bird retain moisture and improves the appearance 
of the finished product. When a bird is trussed before roasting, the lean breast meat is kept from 
drying out in the time it takes the darker leg meat to cook. There are many methods for trussing 
poultry, some of which require a special tool called a trussing needle. Here we show a simple 
method using butcher’s twine.
➎ Pull the string tight and tie it securely just 
above the neck.
❻ Two examples of properly trussed birds: one 
with the wings intact (top) and one with the 
first and second wing joints removed (bottom).
Barding a pheasant.
Barding Poultry to Roast
Guineas, squab or any skinless birds without an adequate fat covering to protect them 
from drying out during roasting can be barded. Bard the bird by covering its entire sur￾face with thin slices of fatback, securing them with butcher’s twine.
Cooking Temperatures for Roasted Poultry
Small birds such as squab and Cornish game hens should be roasted at relatively high tem￾peratures of 375–400°F (190–200°C). These temperatures produce crisp, well-colored skin 
without overcooking the flesh. Whole chickens are best roasted between 350°F and 375°F 
(180°C and 190°C). This temperature range allows the skin to crisp and the flesh to cook 
without causing the bird to stew in its own juices. (Some chefs prefer to roast small unstuffed 
squab, Cornish game hens or chickens at higher temperatures, between 450°F and 500°F 
[230°C and 260°C]. These temperatures crisp the skin and cook the meat quickly before the 
lean meat dries out, but finishing the cooking at a lower temperature may be necessary.)
Large birds such as capons and turkeys are started at high temperatures of 400–425°F 
(200–220°C) to brown the skin, then finished at lower temperatures of 275–325°F 
(135–160°C) to promote even cooking and produce a moister product. Ducks and geese, 
M18_LABE1163_07_SE_C18.indd 464 03/11/23 5:47 PMPOulTRY 465
which are very high in fat, must be roasted at the high temperatures of 375–425°F (190–220°C) 
to render as much fat from the skin as possible. Duck and goose skins are often pricked with 
a fork before roasting so that the rendered fat can escape; this helps create a crispy skin.
Pieces of chicken are best roasted at higher temperatures between 400°F and 450°F 
(200°C and 230°C). This temperature range crisps the skin and cooks the meat quickly 
before the lean meat dries out.
Basting Roasted Poultry
With the exception of fatty birds such as ducks and geese, all poultry items should be 
basted while they roast in order to help retain moisture. To baste a bird, spoon or ladle 
the fat that collects in the bottom of the roasting pan over the bird at 15-to-20-minute 
intervals. Lean birds that are not barded will not produce enough fat for basting and may 
be brushed with butter or oil.
Determining Doneness of Roasted Poultry
Four methods are used to determine the doneness of roasted poultry. It is best to use a 
combination of these methods:
	▪ Temperature: Test the internal temperature of the bird with an instant-read 
thermometer. The thermometer should be inserted in the thickest part of the 
bird’s thigh, which is the last part to be fully cooked. The thermometer should be 
inserted into the meat between the thigh and breast without touching the bone. 
The temperature should read 165–170°F (74–77°C). This method works best with 
large birds such as capons and turkeys. Large birds are subject to some degree of 
carryover cooking. This is not as much of a concern with poultry as it is with red 
meat because large birds are always cooked well done.
	▪ Looseness of the joints: The thigh and leg begin to move freely in their sockets 
when the bird is done.
	▪ Color of juices: This method is used with birds that are not stuffed. Use a kitchen 
fork to tilt the bird, allowing some of the juices that have collected in the cavity 
to run out. Clear juices indicate that the bird is done. If the juices are cloudy or 
pink, the bird is undercooked.
	▪ Time: Because there are so many variables, timing alone is less reliable than other 
methods. It is useful, however, for planning production when large quantities are 
roasted and as a general guideline when used with other methods. Table 18.3 lists 
general timing guidelines for roasting several kinds of poultry.
Accompaniments to Roasted Poultry
The most common accompaniments to roasted poultry are bread stuffing or dressing
and gravy. Large birds, such as capons and turkeys, produce adequate drippings for 
sauce or pan gravy. Small birds, such as squab and Cornish game hens, are often stuffed 
with wild rice or other ingredients and served with a sauce that is made separately.
Ducks and geese are complemented by stuffings containing rice, fruits, berries and 
nuts. These birds are very fatty, and if stuffed, they should be roasted on a rack or mire￾poix bed to ensure that the fat that collects in the pan during roasting does not penetrate 
the cavity, making the stuffing greasy. Ducks and geese are often served with a citrus-or 
fruit-based sauce. Its high acid content complements these rich, fatty birds.

Procedure for Stuffing Poultry
 Safety Alert
Handling Stuffed Poultry
Stuffing requires time and temperature 
control for safety (TCS). All ingredients 
used to make stuffing must be cold and 
stay below 45°F (7°C) when mixing 
and stuffing into poultry. Stuff a bird as 
close to cooking time as possible to keep 
it out of the temperature danger zone. 
Observe proper cooking temperatures 
and roast until the bird reaches an 
internal temperature of 165°F (74°C) as 
indicated by an instant-read thermometer 
placed deep into the stuffing. Remove all 
stuffing from the bird’s cavity promptly. If 
left in the cavity, stuffing will not cool and 
will become a potential breeding ground 
for bacteria.
Small birds such as Cornish game hens, small chickens and squab can be stuffed successfully. 
Stuffing larger birds, especially for volume production, is impractical and can be dangerous for 
the following reasons:
	▪ Stuffing is a bacterial breeding ground, and because it is difficult to control temperatures 
inside a stuffed bird, there is a risk of food-borne illness.
	▪ Stuffing poultry is labor intensive.
	▪ Stuffed poultry must be cooked longer to cook the stuffing properly; this may cause the 
meat to be overcooked, becoming dry and tough.
When stuffing any bird, use the following guidelines:
1 Always be aware of temperatures when mixing the raw ingredients. All ingredients should 
be cold when they are mixed together, and the mixture’s temperature should never be 
allowed to rise above 45°F (7°C).
2 Stuff the raw bird as close to roasting time as possible.
3 The neck and main body cavities should be loosely stuffed. The stuffing will expand 
during cooking.
4 After the cavities are filled, their openings should be secured with skewers and butcher’s 
twine or by trussing.
5 After cooking, remove the stuffing from the bird and store separately.
Procedure for Roasting Poultry
1 Season, bard, stuff and/or truss the bird as desired.
2 Place the bird in a roasting pan. It may be placed on a rack or a bed of mirepoix to prevent 
scorching and promote even cooking.
3 Roast uncovered, basting every 15 minutes.
4 Allow the bird to rest before carving to allow even distribution of juices. As the bird rests, 
prepare the pan gravy or sauce.

1 Remove the giblets (neck, heat and gizzard) from the turkey’s cavity. While preparing the turkey, 
simmer them in 2 quarts (2 liters) stock until tender and the liquid is reduced by half, approxi￾mately 1½ hours. Cool and refrigerate promptly.
2 Season the turkey inside and out with salt and pepper. Truss the turkey.
3 Place the turkey in a roasting pan. Roast at 400°F (200°C) for 30 minutes. Reduce the temper￾ature to 325°F (160°C) and continue cooking the turkey to an internal temperature of 165°F 
(74°C), approximately 2½–3 hours. Baste the turkey often during cooking. Approximately 45 min￾utes before the turkey is done, add the mirepoix to the roasting pan. If the turkey begins to over￾brown, cover it loosely with aluminum foil.
4 To make the dressing, sauté the onions and celery in the butter until tender.
5 In a large bowl, toss together the bread cubes, salt, pepper, eggs, parsley, sautéed onions and 
celery, 24 fluid ounces (720 milliliters) stock and the chestnuts.
6 Place the dressing in a buttered hotel pan and cover with aluminum foil or buttered parchment 
paper. Bake at 350°F (180°C) until done, approximately 45 minutes.
7 When the turkey is done, remove it from the roasting pan and set it aside to rest. Degrease the 
roasting pan, reserving 3 fluid ounces (90 milliliters) of the fat to make a roux.
8 Place the roasting pan on the stove top and brown the mirepoix.
9 Deglaze the pan with a small amount of stock. Transfer the mirepoix and stock to a saucepot and 
add the remaining stock and the broth from the giblets. Bring to a simmer and degrease.

Carving Roasted Poultry
Poultry can be carved in the kitchen, at tableside or on a buffet in a variety of manners. 
The carving methods described next produce slices of both light and dark meat.
➊ After roasting, allow the turkey to stand for 
20 minutes so that the juices can redistribute 
themselves. Holding the turkey firmly with a 
carving fork, pry a leg outward and locate the 
joint. Remove the leg and thigh in one piece by 
cutting through the joint with the tip of a knife.
➋ Repeat the procedure on the other side. 
Once both legs and thighs have been removed, 
slice the meat from the thigh by holding the 
leg firmly with one hand and slicing parallel to 
the bone.

 Poêléing Poultry
Poêléing [pwah-LAY-ing] is a cooking method similar to roasting and braising. The 
item is cooked in the oven in a covered pot so that it cooks in its own juices and steam. 
Although this is a moist-heat cooking technique (because the item steams in its own 
juices), it is used only for tender cuts, not those that need long, slow braising. The cook￾ing time is usually less than that needed for dry roasting.
The item to be poêléed can first be browned in hot fat and then laid on a bed of 
matignon, covered and cooked in the oven. (Recall from Chapter 11, Stock and Sauces, 
that a matignon is a standard mirepoix plus diced smoked bacon or smoked ham and, 
depending on the dish, mushrooms and herbs. A matignon is usually cut more uniformly 
than a standard mirepoix and left in the finished dish as a garnish.) If the item was not 
first browned in hot fat, it can later be browned by removing the lid toward the end of 
cooking. Doneness is determined using the techniques for determining the doneness of 
roasted poultry.
Vegetables to be served with the dish can be added to the poêlé as it cooks or cooked 
separately and plated with the finished item.
The sauce for a poêlé is made from the flavorful cooking juices left in the pan. They 
are mixed with a liquid (stock, jus lié or demi-glace) and finished using the same tech￾niques as those for a braised dish. The matignon can be left in the finished sauce or

1 Sear the main item in hot butter or oil, if desired.
2 Place the main item on a bed of matignon. Add vegetables or other ingredients as called for 
in the recipe.
3 Cover and cook in the oven, basting periodically with pan juices or with additional butter.
4 If the main item was not first browned in hot fat, brown it by removing the lid toward the 
end of the cooking period. Remove the poultry when done.
5 To make a sauce, add a liquid to the matignon and cooking juices in the pan and reduce. 
Remove the matignon, if desired, and add flavorings as directed in the recipe.

Sautéing Poultry
Sautéed poultry should be tender and juicy, its flavor developed by proper browning. 
Additional flavors come from a sauce made by deglazing the pan, usually with wine, 
and adding garnishes, seasonings and liquids. Stir-frying is a popular method of sautéing 
poultry; boneless pieces are cut into cubes or strips and quickly cooked with assorted 
vegetables and seasonings.
Selecting Poultry to Sauté
Most poultry is quite tender and well suited for sautéing. Although small birds such as 
squab can be sautéed bone-in, large pieces and bone-in cuts from larger birds should 
not be sautéed. Boneless breasts, suprêmes, scallops and cutlets are the most common 
and practical cuts for sautéing. Because of the fat layer beneath the skin, boneless duck 
breasts can be sautéed without additional fat.
Seasoning Poultry to Sauté
Poultry can be enhanced by a wide variety of herbs, spices, condiments and marinades. 
Flavor combinations are limited only by your imagination. When poultry items are dusted 
with flour before sautéing, seasonings may be added to the flour.
M18_LABE1163_07_SE_C18.indd 471 03/11/23 5:47 PM472 CHAPTER EIGHTEEN
Cooking Temperatures for Sautéed Poultry
The sauté pan and the cooking fat must be hot before the poultry is added. The tempera￾ture at which the poultry is then sautéed is determined by its thickness and the desired 
color of the finished product. A thin, boneless slice requires relatively high temperatures 
so that its surface is browned before the center is overcooked. A thicker cut such as a 
suprême requires lower temperatures so that neither its surface nor the fond are burned 
before the item is fully cooked. Adjust the temperature throughout the cooking process 
to achieve the desired results, never letting the pan become too cool. If the pan is over￾crowded or otherwise allowed to cool, the poultry will cook in its own juices and absorb 
oil from the pan, resulting in a poor-quality product.
Determining Doneness of Sautéed Poultry
Thin cuts of poultry cook very quickly and, with them, timing is a useful tool. Timing is 
less useful with thicker cuts. Experienced cooks can tell the doneness of an item by judg￾ing the temperature of the sauté pan and the color of the item being cooked.
A more practical method is to press the item with your gloved finger and judge 
the resistance. Very undercooked poultry will offer little resistance and feel mushy. 
Slightly underdone poultry will feel spongy and will not spring back when your finger is 
removed. Properly cooked poultry will feel firm to the touch and will spring back when 
your finger is removed. Overcooked poultry will feel very firm, almost hard, and will 
spring back quickly when your finger is removed.
Accompaniments to Sautéed Poultry
Sautéed poultry is usually served with a sauce made directly in the pan in which the item 
was cooked. The sauce uses the fond for added flavor. A wide variety of ingredients, 
including garlic, onions, shallots, mushrooms and tomatoes, are commonly added to the 
pan as well as wine and stock. Sautéed poultry items are often served with a starch such 
as pasta, rice, cooked grains or potatoes.
Procedure for Sautéing Poultry
1 Heat a sauté pan and add enough fat or oil to just cover the bottom.
2 Add the poultry item, presentation side down, and cook until browned.
3 Turn the item with a chef ’s fork or tongs or by tossing the item back on itself using the 
pan’s sloped sides.
4 larger items can be finished in an oven. Either place the sauté pan in the oven or transfer 
the poultry to another pan. The latter procedure allows a sauce to be made in the original 
pan while the poultry cooks in the oven. Hold smaller pieces that are thoroughly cooked in 
a warm place so that the pan can be used for making the sauce.
Procedure for Preparing a Sauce à la Minute in the Sauté Pan
1 Pour off any excess fat or oil from the sauté pan, leaving enough to sauté the sauce ingredients.
2 Add and sauté ingredients such as garlic, shallots and mushrooms that will be used as 
garnishes and sauce flavorings.
3 Deglaze the pan with wine, stock or other liquids. Scrape the pan, loosening the fond and 
allowing it to dissolve in the liquid. Reduce the liquid.
4 Add any ingredients that do not require long cooking times such as herbs and spices. 
Adjust the sauce’s consistency and seasonings.
5 For service, the poultry can be returned to the pan for a moment to reheat it and to coat it 
with the sauce. The poultry should remain in the sauce just long enough to reheat. Do not 
attempt to cook the poultry in the sauce.
6 Serve the poultry with the accompanying sauce.

Pan-Frying Poultry
Pan-fried poultry should be juicy. Its coating or batter should be crispy, golden brown, 
not excessively oily and free from any breaks that allow fat to penetrate. Both the poultry 
and the coating should be well seasoned.
Selecting Poultry to Pan-Fry
The most common pan-fried poultry is fried chicken. Young tender birds cut into small 
pieces produce the best results. Other cuts commonly pan-fried are boneless portions 
such as chicken breasts and turkey scallops.
Seasoning Poultry to Pan-Fry
Pan-fried poultry is usually floured, breaded or battered before cooking. (Breadings and 
batters are discussed in Chapter 9, Mise en Place.) Typically the seasonings are added 
to the flour, breading or batter before the poultry is coated. Seasonings can be a blend 
of any number of dried herbs and spices. Sometimes only salt and pepper are required 
because the poultry will be served with a sauce or other accompaniments for additional 
flavors. Many of the pan-fried recipes for veal found in Chapter 15, Veal, can also be 
prepared with chicken breast or turkey scallops.
Cooking Temperatures for Pan-Fried Poultry
The fat should be hot before the poultry is added. The temperature at which poultry is 
cooked is determined by the length of time required to cook it thoroughly. Pan-frying 
generally requires slightly lower temperatures than those used for sautéing. Within this 
range, thinner items require higher temperatures to produce good color in a relatively 
short time. Thicker items and those containing bones require lower cooking tempera￾tures and longer cooking times.
Determining Doneness of Pan-Fried Poultry
Even the largest pan-fried items may be too small to be accurately tested with an 
 instant-read thermometer and using the touch method can be difficult and dangerous 
because of the amount of fat used in pan-frying. So timing and experience are the best 
tools to determine doneness. Thin scallops cook very quickly, so it is relatively easy to 
judge their doneness. On the other hand, fried chicken can take as long as 30–45 minutes 
to cook, requiring skill and experience to determine doneness.
Accompaniments to Pan-Fried Poultry
Because pan-frying does not produce fond or drippings that can be used to make a 
sauce, pan-fried poultry is usually served with lemon wedges, a vegetable garnish or 
a separately made sauce. Fried chicken is an exception; it is sometimes served with a 
country gravy made by degreasing the pan, making a roux with a portion of the fat and 
adding milk or stock and seasonings.
Pan-Basting Poultry
Pan-basting is a variation of pan-frying 
and sautéing. lean cuts of poultry that 
cook quickly, such as a boneless breast, 
are well suited to this method. The 
poultry is seared in a generous amount of 
butter, oil or a combination. Fresh herbs, 
flavorings and spices such as thyme and 
lemon may be added to the melted fat 
for flavor. Once the poultry is seared, hot 
butter from the pan is spooned over it 
frequently during cooking to enhance the 
appearance, flavor and surface texture of 
the meat.
Procedure for Pan-Frying Poultry
1 Heat enough fat in a heavy sauté pan to cover the item to be cooked one-fourth to halfway 
up its side. The fat should be at approximately 325°F (160°C).
2 Add the floured, breaded or battered item to the hot fat, being careful not to splash. The 
fat must be hot enough to sizzle and bubble when the item is added.
3 Turn the item when the first side is the proper color; it should be half cooked at this point. 
larger items may need to be turned more than once to brown them properly on all sides.
4 Remove the browned poultry from the pan and drain it on absorbent paper.

Deep-Frying Poultry
Young, tender poultry is an excellent and popular choice for deep-frying. The pieces 
may be boneless or bone-in but should be golden brown on the outside and moist and 
tender on the inside. They should be neither greasy nor tough. Chopped cooked poultry 
can also be mixed with a heavy béchamel or velouté sauce and seasonings, breaded and 
deep-fried as croquettes, which are discussed in Chapter 20, Fish and Shellfish.
Portioned chickens and whole small birds, such as quail or Rock Cornish game hen, are 
best for deep-frying. Although they can be marinated or seasoned directly, it is more com￾mon to season the batter or breading that will coat them. Additional flavors come from the 
sauces and accompaniments served with the deep-fried poultry. Lemon wedges, sweet and 
sour sauce and tangy barbecue sauces are popular accompaniments to deep-fried poultry.

1 Cut, trim or otherwise prepare the poultry to be deep-fried. Season and bread or batter it, 
as desired.
2 Heat the fat to the desired temperature, usually around 350°F (177°C). Breaded or 
battered poultry cooks quickly, and the fat must be cool enough to cook the food’s interior 
without burning its surface.
3 Carefully place the poultry in the hot fat using the basket method. Deep-fry the food until 
done. It should have a crispy, golden-brown surface.
4 Remove the deep-fried poultry from the fat and hold it over the fat, allowing the excess fat 
to drain. Transfer the food to a hotel pan either lined with absorbent paper or fitted with a 
rack. Season with salt, if desired.

MOIST-HEAT AND COMBINATION COOKING 
METHODS FOR POULTRY
The moist-heat cooking methods most often used with poultry are poaching and sim￾mering. Poaching is appropriate for cooking tender birds for short periods. Simmering 
is appropriate for cooking older, tougher birds for longer periods to tenderize them. 
Poaching and simmering are similar procedures, the principal differences being the tem￾perature of the cooking liquid and the cooking time. Combination cooking methods for 
poultry employ dry-heat cooking techniques such as sautéing to brown poultry before 
it is simmered.
Moist-Heat Cooking Methods: Poaching 
and Simmering Poultry
Poached or simmered poultry should be moist, tender and delicately flavored. Although 
the poultry is cooked in water, overcooking will cause it to become dry and tough. 
During cooking, some of the poultry’s flavor is transferred to the cooking liquid, which 
can be used to make a sauce for the finished product. Poultry may be packaged under 
vacuum in plastic pouches and cooked sous vide in a temperature-controlled water bath. 
(See Chapter 10, Principles of Cooking.) Poultry prepared using this technique is moist 
and retains more juices than poultry that is poached directly in a liquid.
Selecting Poultry to Poach or Simmer
Young birds are best for poaching; boneless chicken breast pieces are the most com￾monly used parts. Older, tougher birds are usually simmered. Duck and geese are rarely 
poached or simmered because of their high fat content. (Dry-heat cooking methods such 
as grilling and roasting are preferred to render their fat.)
Seasoning Poultry to Poach or Simmer
When poaching poultry, use a well-seasoned and highly flavored liquid to infuse as 
much flavor as possible into the item being cooked. Either strong stock with a sachet 
or a mixture of stock or water and white wine with a bouquet garni or onion piqué 
produces good results. The poultry should be completely covered with liquid so that it 
cooks evenly. However, if too much liquid is used and it is not strongly flavored, flavors 
may leach out of the poultry, resulting in a bland finished product.
Poultry is often simmered in water instead of stock. A sachet and a generous amount 
of mirepoix should be added to help flavor the water. Typically simmering birds creates 
a strong broth that may be used to complete the recipe or may be reserved for other 
uses, such as in sauces or soup.
Cooking Temperatures for Poached or Simmered Poultry
For best results, poultry should be poached in liquids at low temperatures, between 
160°F and 175°F (71°C and 79°C). Cooking poultry to the proper doneness at these tem￾peratures produces a moist and tender product.
Simmering is done at slightly higher temperatures, between 185°F (85°C) and the boil￾ing point of the chosen liquid. When simmering, do not allow the liquid to boil, as this 
may result in a dry, tough and stringy finished product.
Determining Doneness of Poached or Simmered Poultry
Poached poultry, whether whole or boneless, is cooked just until done. An instant-read 
thermometer inserted in the thigh or thicker part of the bird should read 165°F (74°C). 
Any juices that run from the bird should be clear or show only a trace of pink.
Simmered poultry is usually cooked for longer periods to allow the moist heat to ten￾derize the meat. A chicken that weighs 3 pounds 8 ounces (1.5 kilograms), for example, 
may take 2½ hours to cook.
M18_LABE1163_07_SE_C18.indd 477 03/11/23 5:47 PM478 CHAPTER EIGHTEEN
Accompaniments to Poached or Simmered Poultry
Poached or simmered poultry can be served hot or cold. The meat from these birds 
can be served cold in salads, served hot in casseroles or used in any dish that calls for 
cooked poultry.
Poached items are typically served with a flavored mayonnaise or a sauce made from 
the reduced poaching liquid, such as Sauce Suprême (page 248). Poultry is also often 
poached as a means of producing a low-calorie dish. If so, a vegetable coulis makes a 
good sauce, or the poultry can be served with a portion of its cooking liquid and a veg￾etable garnish.
Simmered poultry to be served cold will be moister and more flavorful if it is cooled 
in its cooking liquid. To do so, remove the pot containing the bird and the cooking liq￾uid from the heat when the bird is still slightly undercooked. Cool the meat in the broth 
in a water bath following the procedure in Chapter 11, Stocks and Sauces. Once cooled, 
remove the meat and wipe off any congealed broth before proceeding with the recipe.
Procedure for Poaching or Simmering Poultry
1 Cut or truss the item to be cooked as directed in the recipe.
2 Prepare the cooking liquid and bring it to a simmer. Submerge the poultry in the cooking 
liquid or arrange the items to be poached in an appropriate pan and add the poaching 
liquid to the pan.
3 Poach or simmer the item to the desired doneness in the oven or on the stove top. Maintain 
the proper cooking temperature throughout the process.
4 Remove the poultry and hold it for service in a portion of the cooking liquid or, using an ice 
bath, cool the item in its cooking liquid.
5 The cooking liquid may be used to prepare an accompanying sauce or reserved for use in 
other dishes.

 Combination Cooking Methods: Braising and Stewing Poultry
Braising and stewing use both dry and moist heat to produce a moist, flavorful prod￾uct. The principal difference between braising and stewing is the size of the cut being 
cooked: Large cuts are braised; smaller ones are stewed. Because most poultry is rela￾tively small, this distinction does not readily apply in poultry cookery; therefore the two 
cooking methods are discussed together here.
Braised or stewed poultry should be moist and fork tender. The poultry is always 
served with the liquid in which it was cooked. Ducks and geese are braised or stewed 
in much the same way as red meats. Chicken cacciatore, Coq au Vin (page 492) and 
Chicken Fricassee (page 481) are examples of braised or stewed chicken dishes.
M18_LABE1163_07_SE_C18.indd 479 03/11/23 5:47 PM480 CHAPTER EIGHTEEN
Selecting Poultry to Braise or Stew
Braising and stewing, which involve slow, moist cooking processes, are often thought of 
as methods to tenderize tough red meats. Although they can be used to tenderize older, 
tougher birds, these cooking methods are more often selected as a means of adding 
moisture and flavor to poultry that is inherently tender, such as young ducks and chick￾ens. Typically, the birds are cut into pieces and cooked bone-in, just until done, so that 
they retain their juiciness.
Seasoning Poultry to Braise or Stew
Braised or stewed items obtain much of their flavor from the cooking liquid and other 
ingredients added during the cooking process. The main item and the cooking liquid 
should be well seasoned. If additional seasonings such as an onion piqué, sachet, 
 bouquet garni or dried herbs and spices are required, they should be added at the 
beginning of the cooking process rather than at the end. This allows the flavors to 
blend and penetrate the larger pieces of poultry. If the poultry is dredged in flour 
before browning, seasonings may be added directly to the flour. The finished dish 
should have the flavor of the poultry in the sauce and the moisture and flavor of the 
sauce in the poultry.
Cooking Temperatures for Braised or Stewed Poultry
Some recipes, such as chicken cacciatore and Coq au Vin (page 492), require the main 
item to be thoroughly browned during the initial stages; others, such as Chicken Fricassee 
(page 481), do not. In either case, after the liquid is added, it is important to maintain a 
slow simmer rather than a rapid boil. This can be done on the stove top or in the oven. 
Low temperatures control the cooking and produce a tender, juicy finished product.
Determining Doneness of Braised or Stewed Poultry
Tenderness is the key to determining doneness. It can be determined by inserting a 
kitchen fork into the poultry. There should be little resistance, and the poultry should 
freely fall off the fork. The pieces should retain their shape, however; if they fall 
apart, they are overdone. Small boneless pieces can be tested by cutting into them 
with a fork.
Accompaniments to Braised or Stewed Poultry
All braises and stews are cooked in a liquid that results in a sauce or broth served as part 
of the finished dish. Rice, pasta, cooked grains and boiled potatoes are natural accom￾paniments to almost any braised or stewed dish, as are boiled or steamed vegetables.
Procedure for Braising or Stewing Poultry
1 Sear the main item in butter or oil, developing color as desired.
2 Add vegetables and other ingredients as called for in the recipe and sauté.
3 Add flour or roux if used.
4 Add the appropriate liquid.
5 Cover and simmer on the stove top or in the oven until done.
6 Add seasonings and garnishes at the appropriate times during the cooking process.
7 Finish the dish by adding cream or a liaison to the sauce or by adjusting its consistency. 
Adjust the seasonings.
8 Serve a portion of the poultry with the sauce and appropriate garnish.

 Safety Alert
Sous Vide Sanitation
Food safety is of utmost 
concern when using sous vide
techniques because of the 
low cooking temperatures. 
To prevent the growth of 
microorganisms, any food to 
be cooked sous vide must be 
chilled below the temperature 
danger zone (41°F/5°C) 
before cooking. Keep all 
cutting boards, knives and 
food contact surfaces clean 
and sanitary and wear clean 
disposable gloves. use only 
the freshest unblemished 
ingredients. Consult your 
local health department for 
regulations for preparing 
food sous vide. Special 
permission and a HACCP 
plan may be required.

 Safety Alert
Sous Vide Sanitation
Food safety is of utmost concern when 
using sous vide techniques because of the 
low cooking temperatures. To prevent the 
growth of microorganisms, any food to 
be cooked sous vide must be chilled below 
the temperature danger zone (41°F/5°C) 
before cooking. Keep all cutting boards, 
knives and food contact surfaces clean 
and sanitary and wear clean disposable 
gloves. use only the freshest unblemished 
ingredients. Consult your local health 
department for regulations for preparing 
food sous vide. Special permission and a 
HACCP plan may be required.

 After studying this chapter, 
you will be able to: 
19. 1 identify furred and ground game 
19. 2 identify feathered or winged game 
19. 3 describe nutritional information for game 
19. 4 purchase and store game appropriate for 
your needs 
19. 5 prepare game for cooking by marinating 
19. 6 explain appropriate cooking methods for 
different types and cuts of game 
Game (Fr. gibier ) are animals hunted for sport or food. Traditionally game supplies 
depended on the season and the hunter’s success. But game’s popularity in food 
service operations has led to farm-raising and animal husbandry techniques. as 
a result, pheasant, quail, deer, rabbit and other animals, although still considered game, are 
now farm- or ranch-raised and commercially available throughout the year. 
 The life of game creatures is reflected in their flesh’s appearance, aroma, flavor and tex￾ture. Generally game flesh has a dark color and a strong but not unpleasant aroma. It has 
a robust flavor and less fat than other meats or poultry and is more compact. The flesh 
becomes quite tough in older animals. 
 The best cooking method for game depends on the animal’s age and the particular cut 
of flesh. Younger animals are more tender than older ones. Flesh from the loin or less-used 
muscles is tender and therefore can be prepared with dry-heat cooking methods. Flesh from 
much-used muscles, such as the leg and shoulder, is tougher and should be prepared with 
combination cooking methods. Less-tender cuts can also be used in sausages, pâtés and 
forcemeats , as discussed in Chapter  28 , Charcuterie . 
 Game appeals to consumers who seek leaner, healthier meats and to chefs, hunters 
and consumers who seek to know the source of their food. Only farm-raised game can be 
used in food service operations. Luckily many popular game items are now farm-raised, 
 government-inspected and readily available. 
 FURRED OR GROUND GAME 
 Furred game includes large animals such as deer, moose, bear, wild boar and elk as 
well as the small ground game animals such as rabbit, squirrel, raccoon and opossum. 
Although these animals (and many others) are hunted for sport and food, only a few 
species are widely available to U.S. food service operations. 
 Although consuming venison, boar and elk may seem unusual to many Americans, 
even rarer meats are available to the daring diner. Zebra, bear, wildebeest and other “big 
game” animals are sometimes available through specialty game purveyors. Most often 
these meats are grilled, roasted or stewed. Reptiles, particularly rattlesnake and alligator, 
are also being raised on farms to meet increased demand. Reptiles are usually braised or 
sliced and deep-fried. They have a mild flavor with a texture similar to lobster. 
 Large game animals are rarely sold whole or in primal portions. Instead the meat is 
marketed precut in subprimals or portions. Therefore the only butchering technique 
included in this chapter is for rabbit. 
 Antelope 
 The blackbuck antelope , about half the size of a large deer, is ranch-raised in the 
United States. Although it has almost no body fat, antelope meat retains a high amount 
of moisture. The meat is fine-grained, with a flavor that is only slightly stronger than 
that of deer meat. Antelope should be butchered and cooked in a manner similar to 
other venison animals. 
 Bison (American Buffalo) 
 Once found in huge herds roaming the plains states, bison or buffalo were hunted into 
near-extinction during the 19th century. Buffalo now live on reservations or ranches, 
where they are raised like beef cattle. Their meat is juicy and flavorful and may be 
 venison flesh from any member of the deer 
family, including antelope, elk, moose, reindeer, 
red-tailed deer, white-tailed deer, mule deer and 
axis deer 
 Game Flavors 
 The tart sweetness of fruit such as 
apricots, blueberries, cranberries, 
peaches, pears, plums or raspberries 
balances the assertive flavor of furred 
game. Spiced fruit compotes , discussed 
in Chapter  25 , Fruits, are a great foil 
for game preparations. Some acidity in 
the form of citrus juice or rind, other 
acidic fruit juices, vinegar or wine 
tames the flavor of most furred game, 
whether used in the marinade, sauce 
or accompaniment. 
 Buffalo steak 
M19_LABE1163_07_SE_C19.indd 500 28/10/23 6:15 PMGame 501
prepared in the same manner as lean beef. Beefalo is a cross between a bison and a 
domestic beef animal that looks and tastes much like modern beef. Because bison and 
beefalo have a low fat content, they are lower in cholesterol and calories than beef and 
poultry. The fine-grained meat cooks in one-third to one-half the time of beef and is best 
when prepared rare to medium rare.
Deer
The deer family includes elk, moose, reindeer, red-tailed deer, white-tailed deer 
(Fr. chevreuil) and mule deer. Meat from any of these animals is known as venison 
(Fr. venaisan). Farm-raised venison, particularly from the Scottish red deer, which is 
bred in New Zealand and the United States, is commercially available all year. Axis 
deer, a species originally from India and Nepal, provides some of the finest-quality 
venison. Like cattle, axis deer graze on grass, so their meat is especially mild 
and tender. Venison is typically dark red with a mild aroma. It is leaner than 
other meats, having almost no intramuscular fat or marbling.
The most popular commercial venison cuts are the loin, leg and rack. 
The loin is tender enough to roast, sauté or grill to medium rare. It 
is often barded with bacon before roasting. It can be left attached 
along the backbone to form a cut known as the saddle. The 
leg is often marinated in red wine and prepared with combination 
cooking methods. Other cuts can also be stewed or braised or used in sausages 
and pâtés. Butchering procedures for venison are similar to those for lamb, discussed 
in Chapter 16, Lamb.
Wild Boar
A close relative of the domesticated hog, wild boar (Fr. sanglier) is leaner, with a dark 
red color and a stronger flavor. Wild boars are plentiful throughout Europe and parts 
of North Africa, Asia and the Americas, where they are considered an invasive species. 
A good supply of farm- or ranch-raised wild boar is available from specialty purveyors 
for food service use in the United States.
Tender baby boar (under 6 months old) is considered a delicacy, but mature animals 
(1–2 years old) have the best flavor. Wild boar meat is most often roasted and may be 
used in sausages or terrines. The bones in a boar loin saddle protect the lean meat 
from drying out during roasting. Boar can often be substituted in recipes for venison or 
pork but in this case larding may be helpful because wild boar meat contains less mar￾bling than domestic pork.
Rabbit
Rabbits (Fr. lapin) are small burrowing animals that have long been raised for 
food. Rabbits have mild, lean and relatively tender flesh, the flavor and texture of 
which are similar to chicken. Ranch-raised rabbit is available all year, either whole 
(full carcass) or cut, fresh or frozen. The average weight of a whole dressed rabbit is 
2 pounds 8 ounces to 3 pounds (1.2 to 1.4 kilograms). Hare (Fr. lièvre) are a spe￾cies of larger rabbits weighing up to 14 pounds (6.4 kilograms) with lean, dark and 
strongly flavored meat. Although hare have not been domesticated, they are avail￾able from importers of wild game. Young rabbit can be roasted, pan-fried, stewed 
or braised and is popular in rustic “country-style” dishes, especially casseroles and 
pâtés. Hare are usually marinated with vinegar or wine before stewing with aromat￾ics and spices. Squirrel and other small ground game animals are not available for 
food service use in the United States, but they can be fabricated in the same manner 
as rabbit.
Venison saddle
 Game (Fr. gibier) are animals hunted for sport or food. Traditionally game supplies 
depended on the season and the hunter’s success. But game’s popularity in food 
service operations has led to farm-raising and animal husbandry techniques. as 
a result, pheasant, quail, deer, rabbit and other animals, although still considered game, are 
now farm- or ranch-raised and commercially available throughout the year.
The life of game creatures is reflected in their flesh’s appearance, aroma, flavor and tex￾ture. Generally game flesh has a dark color and a strong but not unpleasant aroma. It has 
a robust flavor and less fat than other meats or poultry and is more compact. The flesh 
becomes quite tough in older animals.
The best cooking method for game depends on the animal’s age and the particular cut 
of flesh. Younger animals are more tender than older ones. Flesh from the loin or less-used 
muscles is tender and therefore can be prepared with dry-heat cooking methods. Flesh from 
much-used muscles, such as the leg and shoulder, is tougher and should be prepared with 
combination cooking methods. Less-tender cuts can also be used in sausages, pâtés and 
forcemeats, as discussed in Chapter 28, Charcuterie.
Game appeals to consumers who seek leaner, healthier meats and to chefs, hunters 
and consumers who seek to know the source of their food. Only farm-raised game can be 
used in food service operations. Luckily many popular game items are now farm-raised, 
 government-inspected and readily available.
FURRED OR GROUND GAME
Furred game includes large animals such as deer, moose, bear, wild boar and elk as 
well as the small ground game animals such as rabbit, squirrel, raccoon and opossum. 
Although these animals (and many others) are hunted for sport and food, only a few 
species are widely available to U.S. food service operations.
Although consuming venison, boar and elk may seem unusual to many Americans, 
even rarer meats are available to the daring diner. Zebra, bear, wildebeest and other “big 
game” animals are sometimes available through specialty game purveyors. Most often 
these meats are grilled, roasted or stewed. Reptiles, particularly rattlesnake and alligator, 
are also being raised on farms to meet increased demand. Reptiles are usually braised or 
sliced and deep-fried. They have a mild flavor with a texture similar to lobster.
Large game animals are rarely sold whole or in primal portions. Instead the meat is 
marketed precut in subprimals or portions. Therefore the only butchering technique 
included in this chapter is for rabbit.
Antelope
The blackbuck antelope, about half the size of a large deer, is ranch-raised in the 
United States. Although it has almost no body fat, antelope meat retains a high amount 
of moisture. The meat is fine-grained, with a flavor that is only slightly stronger than 
that of deer meat. Antelope should be butchered and cooked in a manner similar to 
other venison animals.
Bison (American Buffalo)
Once found in huge herds roaming the plains states, bison or buffalo were hunted into 
near-extinction during the 19th century. Buffalo now live on reservations or ranches, 
where they are raised like beef cattle. Their meat is juicy and flavorful and may be 
venison flesh from any member of the deer 
family, including antelope, elk, moose, reindeer, 
red-tailed deer, white-tailed deer, mule deer and 
axis deer

FEATHERED OR WINGED GAME
Feathered game includes upland birds, such as wild turkeys, pheasants, quails, doves 
and woodcocks; songbirds, such as larks; and waterfowl, such as wild geese and ducks. 
Wild birds cannot be sold for food service use in the United States. These birds are 
 farm-raised to meet consumer demand, however.
Game birds are available whole or precut into pieces, fresh or frozen. Butchering 
techniques are not shown in this chapter, as they are the same as those for domesticated 
poultry, discussed in Chapter 18. Because game birds tend to have less fat than other 
poultry, they are often barded with fat and cooked to medium rare. If cooked well done, 
game birds become dry and stringy.
Partridge
Two types of game partridges, the Hungarian or gray partridge and the chukar 
 partridge (Fr. perdrix), were introduced into the United States and Canada from Europe 
during the 19th century. Now found principally in the prairie and western mountain 
states, partridges are widely raised on game preserves and farms, producing a good 
commercial supply. The flavor of both breeds of partridge is less delicate than that of 
pheasant, and the meat tends to be tougher. During the autumn hunting season, wild red￾legged partridge are imported from Europe for use in food service and domestic kitchens. 
They have a richer flavor than the farmed breeds. Partridge may be roasted or cut into 
pieces and sautéed or braised. Each bird weighs about 1 pound (450 grams) dressed. Chukar partridge
waterfowl bird species (e.g., duck, swans, 
geese) that swim and breed and raise chicks 
near or on bodies of water, including marshes, 
lakes and rivers
upland birds bird species (e.g., pheasant, quail, 
dove, grouse) that do not swim and do not 
need to live near water (e.g., rivers, marshes, 
lakes) in order to breed and raise chicks
Procedure for Butchering a Rabbit
➊ Place the rabbit on its back. Remove the 
hind legs by cutting close to the backbone and 
through the joint on each side. each thigh and 
leg can be separated by cutting through the joint.
➋ Remove the forelegs by cutting beneath the 
shoulder blades.
➌ Cut through the breast bone and spread 
open the rib cage. Using a boning knife, 
separate the flesh from the rib bones and 
remove the bones.

Pheasant
The most popular of game birds, the pheasant (Fr. faisan) was introduced into Europe from 
Asia during the Middle Ages. The mild flavor of pheasant makes it excellent for roasting, 
stewing or braising. The hen is smaller and more tender than the cock. Both have less flesh 
than a chicken of comparable weight. Stock made from the carcass is often used for con￾sommé or sauce. Farm-raised birds are available fresh or frozen. A dressed bird weighs about 
1 pound 8 ounces to 2 pounds 4 ounces (680 grams to 1 kilogram) and serves two people.
Quail
The quail (Fr. caille) is a migratory game bird related to the pheasant. The more popular 
European and Californian species are farm-raised and available all year. Quail are very small, 
with only about 1–2 ounces (30–60 grams) of breast meat each. Quail may be grilled (espe￾cially on skewers), roasted, broiled or sautéed and are often boned and served whole with a 
stuffing of forcemeat or rice. Because they are so lean, roasted quail benefit from barding.
NUTRITIONAL INFORMATION FOR GAME
Although they are more protected and managed than wild game, ranch-raised game 
animals live in the wild and are generally active and must forage for food. This life￾style produces animals whose meat has less fat than that of domesticated livestock. The 
meat of large game animals is also lower in cholesterol, especially saturated fats, and 
has approximately one-third fewer calories than beef. Game is also generally high in 
 good-quality protein and minerals such as iron and zinc.
PURCHASING AND STORING GAME
The USDA and most states restrict the sale of wild game. As noted earlier in the chapter, 
only farm-raised game can be served in food service operations. Truly wild game can be 
served only by those who hunt and share their kill without charge.
Unlike meat and poultry from domesticated animals, game is not graded for quality. 
Farm- or ranch-raised game is subject only to voluntary inspections for wholesomeness. 
Generally, however, game is processed under the same federal inspection requirements 
as domesticated meats and poultry. State regulations vary and are constantly being 
expanded and improved in response to consumer demands.
Game may be imported from other countries. Only USDA-approved countries are 
permitted to export game to the United States. On arrival in this country, game ship￾ments are subject to USDA spot inspections. Game birds and furred game meats are 
available fresh or frozen. Use the same criteria to determine the freshness of game as you 
would any other meat or poultry: The flesh should be firm, without slime or an off-odor. 
Commercially available game is generally fully aged and ready to use when sold. It does 
not need, nor will it benefit from, additional aging.
As with any fresh or frozen meat, game should be well wrapped and stored under 
refrigeration at temperatures below 41°F (5°C). Because the flesh is generally dry and 
lean, frozen game should be used within 4 months. Thaw frozen game slowly under 
refrigeration to prevent moisture loss.
MARINATING FURRED GAME
Traditionally game, particularly furred game, is marinated in strong mixtures of red wine, herbs 
and spices. Commercially raised game does not have to be marinated. Modern animal hus￾bandry techniques used at game ranches assure that the meat is from young, tender animals. 
Farm-raised game animals also have a naturally milder flavor than their truly wild cousins.

COOKING METHODS FOR DIFFERENT TYPES 
AND CUTS OF GAME
Table 19.1 lists some common types and cuts of game discussed in this chapter and 
recommended cooking methods. Further details appear in the previous material. This 
knowledge is then reinforced by the chapter’s recipes, which you should review to aid 
your understanding.
The following Red Wine Marinade is suitable for most game, such as antelope, elk, 
rabbit, deer or wild boar. After the meat is removed, the marinade may be added to the 
cooking liquid or reduced and used in a sauce. Do not serve uncooked marinade.

 Entomophagy—Edible Insects 
Entomophagy , the consumption of insects 
as food, has been practiced for millennia, 
especially in asia, South and Central america 
and africa. From ancient Greece to modern￾day mexico, various bugs, larvae and worms 
have been regularly consumed, sometimes 
raw, other times fried, steamed, boiled 
or baked. The practice has never been as 
popular in western europe or North america. 
even in countries where the tradition of 
consuming insects exists, fewer people are 
consuming them as they adapt to a Western 
diet. Nevertheless a 2017 study included in 
a report from the United Nations Food and 
agriculture Organization (FaO) notes that 
insects are consumed to some extent in about 
140 countries. Over 2000 species of insects 
are edible by humans, but only 2% of those are 
currently being farmed. 
 according to the FaO and entomophagy 
proponents, insects are high in protein, 
minerals and fiber, yet low in fat and calories. 
They do not emit greenhouse gases and are 
easily farmed in small spaces. Insects are also 
good recyclers, living on animal manure and 
food waste, without consuming additional 
water. In addition, ground or powdered 
insect meal or worm meal can be used to feed 
livestock, lowering the cost of beef, lamb or 
chicken, while simultaneously making more 
land available for cultivating food crops. 
 as many diners also know, some bugs 
taste great. Grasshoppers, the most widely 
consumed insects, have a neutral flavor that 
blends well with sauces and seasonings. They 
are often fried (Sp. chapulines ) as a crunchy 
snack or added to tacos. Waxworms taste like 
bacon, and beetle larvae have a flavor similar 
to shrimp. Other insects can only be described 
as tasting like nothing else you’ve ever tasted, 
yet good. Cricket meal is already used to add 
protein and a nutty crunch to chips and protein 
bars marketed in the United States. 
 Some chefs are working to give insects 
a culinary identity; René Redzepi, marcus 
Samuelsson and José andrès have experimented 
with ants, crickets and grasshoppers on 
their menus. Brooklyn, New York-based 
chef Joseph Yoon, who runs Brooklyn Bugs, 
raises awareness of edible insects through 
presentations, cooking demonstrations and 
educational programming at universities 
and cultural institutions. These chefs and 
researchers know that eating bugs will not be a 
cure-all for meeting global food needs, but it 
is one way to diversify our sources of nutrition. 
 The environmental benefits derived 
from insect cuisine may be moot if they are 
farmed in large industrial operations and fed 
traditional grains, however. and according 
to a 2015 study published by the University 
of California, Davis, the protein conversion 
rate for crickets varies widely depending on 
what they are fed. Insects that are fed high￾quality grains grow the best and produced 
the most usable protein. Crickets fed solely 
on organic waste and by-products show very 
little potential to supplement the global need 
for dietary protein. In other words, for crickets 
(and presumably other bugs) to convert the 
protein they ingest into protein that humans 
can ingest, they must be fed a diet very similar 
to that given to commercially raised chickens, 
creating an increased need for feed grains. 
 even producing insect meal as food for 
livestock will not completely replace current 
agricultural stock feeding methods. While 
insect farms can be smaller in size than animal 
farms, they require more energy than it takes 
to produce the fish and soy meal currently 
used in livestock feed. Current european Union 
(eU) policies ban using waste products to feed 
“farmed animals,” including insects. The eU 
also bans feeding livestock “processed animal 
proteins” such as insect meal. So, for now 
at least, these potential uses are off limits 
in europe.

Fish are aquatic vertebrates with fins for swimming and gills for breathing. 
Of the more than 30,000 species of fish known, most live in the seas and oceans; 
freshwater species are far less numerous. Shellfish are aquatic invertebrates with 
shells or carapaces. They are found in both fresh and salt water. 
 Always an important food source, fish and shellfish have become increasingly popular in 
recent years, due in part to demand from health-conscious consumers. Because of increased 
demand and improved preservation and transportation techniques, good-quality fish and 
shellfish, once found only along seacoasts and lakes, are now readily available to almost 
every food service operation. 
 Many fish and shellfish species are very expensive; all are highly perishable. Because fish 
and shellfish cooking times are generally shorter and their flavors more delicate than meat 
or poultry, special attention must be given to prevent spoilage and to produce high-quality 
finished products. 
 in this chapter, you will learn how to identify a large assortment of fish and shellfish as 
well as how to properly purchase and store them, fabricate or prepare them for cooking and 
cook them by a variety of dry-heat and moist-heat cooking methods. This chapter presents 
many of the cooking methods applied to meats and poultry in the previous chapters . Review 
the corresponding procedures for meats and poultry and note the similarities and differ￾ences. The preparation and service of raw fish and seafood is also discussed. 
 STRUCTURE AND MUSCLE COMPOSITION 
OF FISH AND SHELLFISH 
 The fish and shellfish used in food service operations can be divided into three catego￾ries: fish, mollusks and crustaceans. 
Fish (Fr. poisson ) include both fresh- and saltwater varieties. Fish have fins and an internal 
skeleton of bone and cartilage. Based on shape and skeletal structure, they can be divided 
into two groups: round fish and flatfish. Round fish swim in a vertical position and have 
eyes on both sides of their heads. See Figure  20. 1 . Their bodies may be truly round, oval or 
compressed. Flatfish have asymmetrical, compressed bodies, swim in a horizontal position 
and have both eyes on top of their heads. See Figure  20. 2 . Flatfish are bottom dwellers and 
begin life in coastal saltwater areas. They move to deeper water as adults, which is where 
most commercial fishing occurs. The skin on top of their bodies is dark, to camouflage 
flatfish from predators, and can sometimes change color according to their surroundings. 
Flatfish have small scales and their dorsal and anal fins run the length of their bodies. 
Mollusks (Fr. mollusque ) are shellfish characterized by soft, unsegmented bodies with 
no internal skeleton. Most mollusks have hard outer shells. Single-shelled mollusks, such 
as abalone, are known as univalves . Those with two shells, such as clams, oysters and 
mussels, are known as bivalves . Unlike mollusks, squid and octopus, which are known 
as cephalopods , do not have a hard outer shell. Rather cephalopods have a single thin 
internal shell called a pen or cuttlebone . Crustaceans (Fr. crustacés ) are also shellfish. They 
have hard outer skeletons or shells and jointed appendages. Crustaceans include lobsters, 
crabs and shrimp. 
 The flesh of fish and shellfish consists primarily of water, protein, fat and minerals. 
Fish flesh is composed of short muscle fibers, pleated in shape and separated by delicate 
sheets of connective tissue. See Figure  20. 3 . Unlike the connective tissue in meat, the 
connective tissue in fish is weak and does not require long cooking to break it down. 
Fish, as well as most shellfish, are naturally tender, so the purpose of cooking is to firm 
proteins and enhance flavor. The absence of the oxygen-carrying protein myoglobin 
makes fish flesh very light or white in color. (The orange color of salmon and some trout 
comes from pigments found in their food.)

 Compared to meats, fish do not contain large amounts of intermuscular fat. But the 
amount of fat a fish does contain affects the way it responds to cooking. Fish containing 
a relatively large amount of fat, such as salmon and mackerel, are known as fatty or oily 
fish. Fish containing very little fat, such as cod and haddock, are referred to as lean fish. 
Shellfish are also very lean.

IDENTIFYING FISH
Identifying fish properly can be difficult because of the vast number of similar-appearing 
fish that are separate species within each family. Adding confusion are the various col￾loquial names given to the same fish or the same name used for different fish in different 
localities. Fish with an unappealing name may also have been given a catchier name or 
the name of a similar but more popular item for marketing purposes.
In an effort to avoid confusion and fraud, the U.S. FDA maintains a list of acceptable 
market names for many fish and shellfish sold in the United States. The Seafood List: 
FDA’s Guide to Acceptable Market Names for Seafood Sold in Interstate Commerce (2022) 
can be searched or downloaded from the FDA’s website. Deviations from this list are 
strongly discouraged but difficult to enforce. We attempt to use the most common names 
for seafood items in this text, even though those common names may deviate from the 
scientific names.
Round Fish
Bass (Fr. bar) commonly refers to a number of unrelated spiny-finned fish. The 
 better-known freshwater bass varieties (largemouth, smallmouth, redeye and black) are 
members of the sunfish family. They are lean and delicate but, as game, not commer￾cially available in the United States. The saltwater bass varieties (black sea bass and 
striped bass) are popular commercial items.
Black sea bass are sometimes referred to as rock sea bass. They have a lean, firm 
white flesh with a mild flavor and flaky texture. They usually weigh from 1½ to 3 pounds 
(720 to 1360 grams) and are most prevalent in the Atlantic Ocean between New York 
and North Carolina. Black sea bass can be prepared by almost any cooking method and 
are often served whole in Chinese and Italian cuisines.
Striped bass, often erroneously referred to as rockfish, are anadromous. True striped 
bass cannot be marketed because pollution and overfishing have damaged the sup￾ply. A hybrid of striped bass and either white bass or white 
perch is aquafarmed for commercial use, however. It is 
this hybrid that food service operations receive as striped 
bass. (A European relative of striped bass called bran￾zino in Italian and loup de mer in French is also widely 
available to chefs in the United States.) Whole fish weigh from 
1 to 5 pounds (450 grams to 2.2 kilograms). Striped bass have a rich, sweet flavor and 
firm texture. They can be steamed, baked, poached or broiled.
Bluefish are sustainable game fish that migrate in schools along the U.S. Atlantic 
coast seeking warm waters. They have a long blue-green body and a mouth filled with 
razor-sharp teeth. Their fatty flesh is brown or blueish grey when raw and similar to the 
flesh of mackerel. Bluefish can be unpleasant tasting and oily if not extremely fresh, 
however. Because bluefish is firm and flavorful, it is good smoked, grilled or broiled and 
can stand up to strongly flavored marinades and sauces. The sweetest flesh is found in 
small 2–4-pound (1–2-kilogram) fish, but even 25-pound (11-kilogram) bluefish can be 
caught in season.
Catfish are scaleless freshwater fish common in southern lakes and rivers and exten￾sively aquafarmed. Aquafarming eliminates the “muddy” flavor once associated with 
 catfish and ensures a year-round supply. Their flesh is pure white with a moderate fat 
content; a mild, sweet flavor; and a firm texture. Channel catfish are the most important 
commercially available catfish. They usually weigh from 1½ to 5 pounds (720 grams to 
2.2 kilograms). The smaller of these fish are known as fiddlers; they are often deep-fried 
and served whole. Catfish may be prepared by almost any cooking method but are espe￾cially well suited to frying. Note that other species are often imported to the United States 
under the generic name catfish. Only products labeled “U.S. Farm-Raised Catfish” provide 
the consistent high quality and flavor that consumers have come to expect, however.
The cod (Fr. cabillaud) family includes Atlantic and Pacific cod as well as pollock, 
haddock, whiting and hake. Cod have a mild, delicate flavor and lean, firm white flesh 
that flakes apart easily. Cod can be prepared by most cooking methods, although grilling 
is not recommended because the flesh is too flaky.

Sustainable Seafood
in the past 50 years, the supply of seafood has 
declined precipitously due to damaged habitats, 
overfishing, specific fishing practices and increased 
demand. Certain fish, especially slow-growing 
species, face extinction. There are choices, 
however, that may help ensure future supplies, 
including sourcing farmed fish, preparing specific 
types of fish or catching fish in certain ways.
Sustainable fish farming operations 
protect the habitat and the spread of disease. 
Regulations and management practices vary 
widely, affecting the sustainability of different 
aquaculture farms. More than 55% of the 
shrimp sold is farmed, yet there are few places 
where the farming practices are considered 
sustainable. Gulf Coast and West Coast wild 
shrimp are among the better choices when 
looking for sustainably harvested products, 
for example.
Before writing a menu, chefs should learn 
about the species they use. Bluefin tuna, shark, 
orange roughy and freshwater eel (unagi) are 
among the fish species to avoid. Bluefin tuna 
and orange roughy are seriously overfished, 
threatening these species’ ability to restore their 
numbers. The fishing methods used to catch 
bluefin tuna result in excessive by-catch of 
other species, including endangered sea turtles, 
sharks and sea birds. Orange roughy are caught 
using bottom trawling, which destroys coral 
and the seabed. Freshwater eels, although 
raised in farms, put pressure on the wild fish 
population because juvenile eels are taken from 
the wild to stock the farms.
Suggestions to consider when purchasing 
seafood include:
▪ Work with suppliers committed to sustainable 
practices. Ask suppliers where seafood is 
from, how it is caught and/or farmed.
▪ Find species of fish that replicate the texture 
of an endangered fish such as shark.
▪ Serve lesser-known species of fish, which may 
offer a new flavor profile to your customers.
▪ learn about sustainable species and 
production methods for fish and shellfish. 
Consult the websites of organizations 
such as The Safina Center, the National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s 
FishWatch and the Monterey Bay Aquarium 
Seafood Watch Program to inform your 
seafood purchasing decisions.
Atlantic cod
Pollock
Cobia
Atlantic cod are available 
fresh or frozen, whole or drawn 
or cut into fillets or steaks. 
Smoked cod and dried salt cod 
(Sp. bacalao) are also available. Most 
of the cod marketed today comes from 
the North Atlantic, especially Iceland, as U.S. 
and Canadian cod has been overfished, almost to the point of extinction. 
Although individual cod may reach 200 pounds (90 kilograms), most market cod 
weigh 10 pounds (4.4 kilograms) or less. Scrod is a marketing term for cod or 
haddock that weighs less than 2½ pounds (1.1 kilograms) or measures less than 
20 inches (50 centimeters) in length.
Haddock look like thin, small Atlantic cod and weigh about 2–5 pounds (900 grams 
to 2.3 kilograms). They have a stronger flavor and more delicate texture than Atlantic cod.
Pacific cod, also known as gray cod, are found in the northern Pacific Ocean. 
Weighing from 5 to 10 pounds (2.3 to 4.6 kilograms) on average, they are most often 
available frozen. Pacific cod should be distinguished from rock cod and black cod, 
which are unrelated.
Pollock, also known as Boston bluefish 
or blue cod, are found in the northern 
Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Their flesh is 
gray-pink when raw, turning white when 
cooked. Pollock, which weigh from 1 to 2 
pounds (450 to 900 grams), are often frozen at sea, then reprocessed into surimi. They 
can also be salted or smoked.
Cobia is a quick-growing sustainable fish 
found in warm waters of the Atlantic 
Ocean, in the Caribbean and off the 
coast of Australia. Although a popu￾lar sport fish, cobia also easily adapts 
to open-ocean farming and is often 
imported from farms in Mexico, Panama 
and Taiwan. Also known as black salmon, ling or black bonito, the cobia has an elon￾gated silver body and a protruding lower jaw. Farmed cobia typically weigh from 13 to 22 
pounds (6 to 10 kilograms) although wild-caught cobia are much larger. The flesh is lean, 
firm and pinkish-white with a sweet, nutty flavor. You may grill, bake, smoke or sauté 
cobia fillets; frying can hide its natural flavor. Cobia is also used in sushi and sashimi.

viscera (internal organs) are removed
Surimi
Surimi is made from a highly processed 
fish paste colored, flavored and shaped 
to resemble shrimp, lobster, crab or other 
shellfish. Most surimi is based on Alaskan 
pollock, but some blends include varying 
amounts of real crab, shrimp or other 
items. Available chilled or frozen, surimi 
is already fully cooked and ready to add 
to salads, pasta, sauces or other dishes. 
Surimi is very low in fat and relatively 
high in protein. Because of processing 
techniques, however, it has more sodium 
and fewer vitamins and minerals than 
the actual fish or shellfish it replaces. 
Americans now consume more than 
100 million pounds of surimi each year, 
and its popularity continues to grow. The 
FdA no longer requires that all surimi 
products be labeled “imitation.”

Mahi-mahi
Grouper
Eels (Fr. anguilles) are long, snakelike freshwater fish with dorsal and anal fins run￾ning the length of their bodies. (The conger eel, used in Japanese cooking, is from a dif￾ferent family.) American and European eels are available live, whole, gutted or as fillets. 
Although wild stocks have been severely depleted in recent years, farmed eels are plenti￾ful. Eels have a high fat content and firm flesh; they are sweet and mildly flavored. They 
are marketed in a variety of sizes and ages, from babies the size of linguine to giants the 
size of a beef tenderloin. The tough skin of larger mature eels should be removed before 
cooking. Eels may be steamed, baked, fried or used in stews. Baby eels are a springtime 
delicacy, especially in Spain, where they are pan-fried in olive oil and garlic with hot red 
peppers. Smoked eels are also available.
The grouper family includes almost four hundred varieties found in temperate waters 
worldwide. The more common Atlantic Ocean varieties are the yellowfin grou￾per, black grouper, red grouper and gag. The Pacific Ocean varieties are the sea 
bass, which is different from the black sea bass, and spotted cabrilla. Although 
some species can reach 800 pounds or more, most commercial varieties are sold 
in the 5- to 20-pound (2.2- to 9-kilogram) range. Grouper have lean white flesh 
with a mild to sweet flavor and very firm texture. Their skin, which is tough and 
strongly flavored, is generally removed before cooking. Grouper fillets may be baked, 
deep-fried, broiled or grilled.
Herring (Fr. hareng) are long, silvery-blue fish found in both the northern Atlantic 
and Pacific Oceans. Their strongly flavored flesh has a moderate to high fat content. 
Whole herring weigh up to 8 ounces (225 grams). Fresh herring may be butterflied or 
filleted and roasted, broiled or grilled. But because herring are very soft and tend to spoil 
quickly, they are rarely available fresh in the United States. More often they are smoked 
(and known as kippers) or cured in brine.
Very young, small herring, weighing from 5 to 6 ounces (140 to 170 grams) on aver￾age, are known as sardines (Fr. sardine). They have fatty, oily flesh with a flaky texture. 
Small sardines are usually sold canned, whole or as skinned and boned fillets, or fried or 
smoked and packed in oil or sauce. Canned sardines are used primarily for sandwiches 
and salads.
Mackerel (Fr. maquereau) of culinary importance include king and Spanish mack￾erel which are sustainably managed wild-caught varieties found along the Atlantic 
coast and in the Gulf of Mexico. Typical market size is from 1 to 3 pounds (500 gram to 
1.5 kilograms), although they commonly reach as much as 12 pounds (5.5 kilograms). 
(The species known as Atlantic and Pacific mackerel are not generally used for food 
because of their small size and high fat content.) Mackerel flesh has a high fat content 
that is rich in Omega-3 fatty acids. The flesh is gray to pink colored, becoming off￾white when cooked. Mackerel flavor ranges from mild to strong and rich. Mackerel is 
best broiled, grilled, smoked or baked.
Mahi-mahi is the more commonly used name for dolphin or dolphinfish. The 
Hawaiian name mahi-mahi is used to distinguish them from the marine mammal of 
the same name. (Dolphins and porpoises are marine mammals.) Also known by their 
Spanish name, dorado, mahi-mahi are brilliantly colored fish found in 
tropical seas. Mahi-mahi weigh about 15 pounds (6.6 kilograms) 
and are sold whole or as fillets. Their flesh is off-white to pink, 
lean and firm with a sweet flavor. Dolphinfish can be broiled, 
grilled or baked. The meat may become dry when cooked, how￾ever, so a sauce or marinade is recommended.
Monkfish are also known as angler fish, goosefish, rape and lotte. These extraor￾dinarily ugly fish are rarely seen whole, for the large head is usually discarded before 
reaching market. Only the tail is edible; it is available whole or in fillets and steaks, fresh 
or frozen. The scaleless skin must be removed. The flesh is lean, pearly white, very firm 
and not flaky. Its texture and flavor have earned monkfish the nickname of “poor man’s 
lobster.” Monkfish absorb flavors easily and are baked, steamed, fried, grilled or broiled. 
They are also used in stews and soups.

Red snapper is also known as the American or northern red snapper. Although there 
are many members of the snapper family, only one is the true red snapper, most of 
which is found in the Gulf of Mexico. Once severely overfished, wild populations 
of red snapper are growing, but harvest quantities are still limited. Red-skinned 
rockfish are often mislabeled as the more popular red snapper or Pacific snap￾per, a practice that is currently legal only in California. True red snapper have 
red skin and eyes and lean, pink flesh that becomes white when cooked and is 
sweet-flavored and flaky. Red snapper are sold whole or as fillets with the skin left on 
for identification. A fish may reach 35 pounds, but most are marketed at only 4–6 pounds 
(1.8–2.7 kilograms) or as 1- to 3-pound (450-gram to 1.3-kilogram) fillets. Red snapper 
can be prepared using almost any cooking method. The head and bones are excellent 
for stock.
Salmon (Fr. saumon) live in both the northern Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, returning 
to the freshwater rivers and streams of their birth to spawn. Salmon flesh gets its dis￾tinctive pink-red color from fat-soluble carotenoids found in the crustaceans on which 
they feed.
Atlantic salmon is the most important commercially, accounting for one￾fourth of all salmon produced worldwide. Extensive aquafarms in 
Chile, Norway, Canada and Scotland produce a steady supply of 
Atlantic salmon, although the farming methods have been asso￾ciated with environmental problems. For marketing purposes, 
the salmon’s point of origin is often added to the name (e.g., 
Norwegian, Scottish or Shetland Atlantic salmon). Atlantic salmon 
have a rich, pink color and moist, fatty flesh. Their average weight is from 4 to 
12 pounds (1.8 to 5.4 kilograms). Fishing for wild Atlantic salmon is prohibited in 
U.S. waters.
Chinook or king salmon from the Pacific are also highly desirable. They 
average from 5 to 30 pounds (2.2 to 13.2 kilograms) and have red-orange 
flesh with a high fat content and rich, buttery flavor. Like other salmon, 
their flesh separates into large flakes when cooked. Chinooks are often mar￾keted by the name of the river from which they are harvested (e.g., Columbia, 
Yukon or Copper Chinook salmon). They are distinguished by the black interior of 
their mouth.
Coho or silver salmon have a fatty, reddish-orange flesh and are available 
fresh or frozen, wild or from aquafarms. Wild coho average from 3 to 12 pounds 
(1.3 to 5.4 kilograms), whereas aquafarmed coho are much smaller, usually less than 
1 pound (450 grams). Other varieties, such as chum, sockeye, red, blueback and pink 
salmon, are usually canned but may be available fresh or frozen.
Salmon can be prepared by many cooking methods: broiling, grilling, poaching, 
steaming or baking. Frying is not recommended, however, because of their high fat con￾tent. Salmon fillets are often cured or smoked. Gravlax is salmon that has been cured for 
one to three days with salt, sugar and dill. Lox is salmon that has been cured in a salted 
brine and then, typically, cold-smoked. The term nova is used in the eastern United 
States to refer to a less-salty, cold-smoked salmon.
Sea bream is the name of a large family of fish found in the Mediterranean 
( gilt-head bream), the Caribbean (porgy), the Atlantic (black sea bream) and the 
Indo-Pacific (emperor and snapper). Because the marketing term bream is applied 
to so many different fish, it is difficult to generalize about their characteristics. Some 
bream have very few bones, others have quite a few; some have a rich flavor, others 
are very mild; some weigh up to 20 pounds (9.6 kilograms), others rarely exceed 
5 pounds (2.2 kilograms). Black sea bream, for example, is a good pan fish, reaching 
only 35 centimeters in length and weighing less than 6 pounds (2.9 kilograms). Their 
flesh is firm, mild and lean. Also marketed as Thai snapper, they are good for baking, 
grilling or frying.

Swordfish take their name from the long, swordlike bill extending from their 
upper jaw. These popular fish average about 250 pounds (112.5 kilograms). Their 
flesh is sweet with a very firm, meatlike texture; it may be gray, pink or off-white 
when raw, becoming white when cooked. Swordfish from the North Atlantic have a 
moderate fat content; those from the Pacific are fattier. Swordfish are most often avail￾able cut into cross-sections called wheels or portioned into steaks perfect for grilling 
or broiling.
Tilapia is the name given to several species of freshwater, aquafarm-raised fish 
bred worldwide. They grow quickly in warm water and are marketed at about 3 pounds 
(1.4 kilograms). Tilapia is widely available whole or filleted, 
fresh or frozen. The lean flesh is similar to catfish—
white and sweet, with a firm texture that can be used 
in almost any culinary preparation. Tilapia are some￾times marketed as cherry snapper or sunshine snapper, 
even though they are not members of the snapper family.
Trout (Fr. truite) are members of the salmon family. Most of the freshwater trout 
commercially available are aquafarm-raised rainbow trout, although brown trout and 
brook trout are also being aquafarmed. Some trout species 
spend part of their lives at sea, returning to fresh water 
to spawn. On the West Coast, these are called salmon 
trout or steelhead. Trout have a low to moderate fat con￾tent, a flaky texture and a delicate flavor that can be easily 
overwhelmed by strong sauces. The flesh may be white, 
orange or pink. Trout are usually marketed at 8–10 ounces 
(225–280 grams) each, just right for an individual portion. 
Lake trout resemble trout and salmon. They are fresh or 
saltwater fish and are widely aquafarmed. Trout and char 
can be baked, pan-fried, smoked or steamed.
Arctic char (Fr. alose), also known as alpine trout, is a member of the salmon family, 
with similarly pink-colored flesh and silvery skin. Market weight averages from 2 to 8 
pounds (1 to 4 kilograms), although much larger fish can be found in the wild. Char are 
anadromous and are found throughout the Arctic Ocean and in the rivers and lakes of 
Northern Canada, Iceland and Scandinavia. Line-caught free-running char are considered 
to have the finest flavor and texture. Arctic char is currently considered a good choice 
for sustainability with a low environmental impact. Like salmon, char is high in fat but 
with a thinner, tender skin. Char is best prepared by baking, grilling or smoking and is 
also used in sushi.
Tuna (Fr. thon) varieties include the bluefin, yellowfin, bonito, bigeye and blackfin. 
Ahi is the popular market name for either yellowfin or bigeye tuna. All are members of 
the mackerel family and are found in tropical and subtropical waters around the world. 
Tuna are large fish, weighing up to several hundred pounds each. Bluefin, with its fatty 
belly flesh (Jp: o-toro), which is highly desirable for sashimi, is seriously 
endangered because of overfishing. Most canned tuna is prepared from 
yellowfin or skipjack; canned white tuna is prepared from albacore, also 
known as longfin tuna. Any of these species may be found fresh or frozen. 
Tuna are usually cut into four boneless loins for market. The loins are then 
cut into steaks, cubes or chunks. The flesh has a low to moderate fat 
content (a higher fat content is preferred for sashimi) and a deep red 
color. The dark, reddish-brown muscle that runs along the lateral line is 
very fatty and can be removed. Tuna flesh turns light gray when cooked 
and is very firm, with a mild flavor. Tuna work well for grilling or broiling and may 
be marinated or brushed with seasoned oil during cooking. Tuna are often prepared 
medium rare to prevent dryness.

Wahoo, also known as ono, are found throughout tropical and subtropical waters but 
are particularly associated with Hawaii (ono means “good to eat” in Hawaiian). 
They are actually a type of mackerel with a leaner pink to grey flesh. 
Wahoo are a popular game fish, generally marketed between 
8 to 30 pounds (17 to 66 kilograms) in weight. Prepare wahoo 
using any technique suitable for lean fish.
Whitefish species inhabit the freshwater lakes and streams of 
North America. Lake whitefish, the most important commercially, are related to salmon. 
They are marketed at 7 pounds (3.2 kilograms) or less and are available whole or fil￾leted. The flesh is firm and white, with a moderate amount of fat and a sweet flavor. 
Whitefish may be baked, broiled, grilled or smoked and are often used in processed fish 
products such as breaded fish fillets or sticks.
Flatfish
Flounder (Fr. flet) have lean, firm flesh that is pearly or pinkish-white with a sweet, mild 
flavor. Flounder can grow to more than 30 inches (76 centimeters) in length and weigh 
more than 20 pounds (9 kilograms), but 1- to 3-pound (450-gram to 1.3-kilogram) fish 
are more typical. Although they are easily boned, most flounder are deheaded and gut￾ted at sea and sold as fresh or frozen fillets. These fillets are very thin and can dry out 
or spoil easily, so extra care should be taken in handling, preparing and storing them. 
Recipes that preserve moisture work best with flounder; poaching, steaming and frying 
are recommended.
Many types of flounder are marketed under the more popular name “sole,” a practice 
permitted by the FDA. Some common flounder often labeled as sole include lemon 
sole, which is the most popular variety from the United States East Coast and is har￾vested only during winter months. The West Coast of the 
United States supplies the generic English sole, 
an average quality fish often labeled simply 
“fillet of sole.” Petrale sole, another West 
Coast flounder, is generally considered the 
finest of the domestic “soles.” They are 
most often available as fillets, which tend to 
be thicker and firmer than other sole fillets.

Note that the FdA allows many flatfish to be called “sole” for marketing purposes. No true sole 
is commercially harvested in U.S. waters, however. Any flatfish harvested in U.S. waters and 
marketed as sole is actually in the flounder family.

Halibut are among the largest flatfish; a halibut can often 
weigh up to 300 pounds (135 kilograms). The FDA 
recognizes only two halibut species: Atlantic (east￾ern) and Pacific (northern, Alaskan, western) halibut. 
Both have lean, firm flesh that is snow-white with a 
sweet, mild flavor. California halibut, which are actu￾ally flounder, are similar in taste and texture but average 
only 12 pounds (5.4 kilograms) each. Halibut may be cut 
into boneless steaks or skewered on brochettes. The flesh, 
which dries out easily, can be poached, baked, grilled or 
broiled and is good with a variety of sauces.
Skate wings are the large pectoral fins of a ray￾type fish in the shark family. The wings are usually sold in triangles weighing from 
1 to 2 pounds (450 to 960 grams), with each fish yielding four such triangles. There are 
no bones in skate wings, but the rough skin must be peeled off and the fillets separated 
from a central plate of cartilage before cooking. The flesh is sweet and tender but gelati￾nous with deep corrugated grooves. Skate wings are often pan-fried and served with a 
sauce containing capers, lemon or another acidic element to create a balance of flavors. 
Poaching and baking are also suitable cooking techniques. Look for skate from New 
England or the U.S. West Coast; avoid purchasing products from British Columbia for 
environmental reasons.
Sole (Fr. sole) are probably the most flavorful and finely textured flatfish. Indeed 
because of the connotations of quality associated with the name, “sole” is widely used 
for many species that are not members of the Soleidae family. As noted previously, even 
though the FDA allows many species of flatfish to be called “sole” for marketing pur￾poses, no true sole is commercially harvested in U.S. waters. Any flatfish harvested in 
U.S. waters and marketed as sole is actually flounder.
True Dover sole, a staple of classic cuisine, is a lean fish with firm, pearly white flesh 
and a delicate flavor that can stand up to a variety of sauces and seasonings. They are a 
member of the Soleidae family and come only from the waters off the coasts of England, 
Africa and Europe. They are imported into the United States as fresh whole fish weighing 
from 1 to 2½ pounds (450 to 1200 grams), or as fresh or frozen fillets. Skin Dover sole 
after it is filleted.
In North America, turbot are a Pacific flatfish of no great culinary distinction. In 
Europe, however, the species known as turbot (Fr. turbot) are large diamond-shaped fish 
highly prized for their delicate flavor and lean, firm, white flesh. European turbot (some￾times marketed as brill) can reach 55 pounds (25 kilograms) and 40 inches (1 meter) 
in length. Their bodies are scaleless but covered with small bumps (tubercles). Turbot 
are traditionally roasted whole in specially shaped pans, but fillets are also prepared by 
poaching, pan-frying and grilling.
IDENTIFYING SHELLFISH
Mollusks are invertebrate shellfish with soft bodies covered by a shell of one or more 
pieces. They live in both freshwater and saltwater habitats, and many varieties are now 
farmed around the world. Mollusks are further classified as univalves, bivalves or cepha￾lopods. Univalves are mollusks with a single shell in which the soft-bodied animal 
resides. They are actually marine snails with a single foot, used to attach the creature 
to fixed objects such as rocks. The most common species for culinary use are abalone, 
conch and sea snails, such as periwinkles and whelks. Univalves are most popular in 
their native locales where they are available fresh. Univalves must be prepared with 
care to prevent the flesh from becoming tough or rubbery. Bivalves are mollusks with 
two shells attached by a central hinge, including numerous varieties of clams, mussels, 
oysters and scallops.
Cephalopods are marine mollusks with distinct heads, well-developed eyes, a num￾ber of arms that attach to the head near the mouth and a saclike, fin-bearing mantle.

They do not have an outer shell; instead there is a thin internal shell called a pen or 
cuttlebone. Octopus and squid are cephalopods.
Mollusks
Abalone (Jp. awapi; Kr. jeonbok) is a univalve mol￾lusk with an oval shell lined in mother of pearl. 
Considered one of the most valuable shellfish 
worldwide, wild-grown abalone is harvested 
by hand and can cost hundreds of dollars 
per pound. Aquafarms for abalone are consid￾ered sustainable and are becoming more com￾mon in the waters around New Zealand and 
Australia, off the U.S. Pacific coast and in north￾east Asia. The flavor is very mild but the texture—firm to the bite, but still tender—is the 
source of abalone’s popularity. When fresh, the flesh might be served raw as sushi or 
lightly steamed or pan-fried in butter. Most is sold frozen, dried, smoked or canned and 
used in soup, porridge or poached in well-seasoned sauce.
Clams (Fr. palourdes) are harvested along both the U.S. East and West Coasts, 
with Atlantic clams being more significant commercially. Atlantic Coast clams include 
 hard-shell (quahogs), soft-shell and surf clams. Fresh clams are available all year, either 
live in the shell or fresh-shucked (meat removed from the shell). Canned clams, whether 
minced, chopped or whole, are also available.
The chewy meat of quahogs is not as sweet as other clam meat and has a briny, 
mild flavor. Quahogs have different names, depending on 
their size, the smaller sizes being more expensive than 
the larger ones. (See Table  20.1.) Littlenecks, the 
smallest, are usually served raw on the half shell or 
steamed. Topnecks are sometimes eaten raw but 
are more often cooked. Cherrystones are usually 
cooked and often used for stuffed clams. Chowders, 
the largest, are always cooked, usually 
minced, for chowder or soup.
Soft-shell Atlantic clams, also known as 
Ipswich, steamer and long-necked clams, have thin, brittle shells 
that do not completely close because of the clam’s protruding 
black-tipped siphon. Their meat is tender and sweet. They are 
sometimes fried but are more often served steamed.
Surf clams are deep-water clams from the Atlantic that 
reach sizes of 8 inches (20 centimeters) across. They are most

Land Snails
Although snails (more politely known 
by their French name, escargots) are 
univalve land animals, they share many 
characteristics with their marine cousins. 
They can be poached in court bouillon 
or removed from their shells and boiled 
or baked briefly with a seasoned butter 
or sauce. They should be firm but tender; 
overcooking makes snails tough and 
chewy. The most popular varieties are the 
large, white, Burgundy snail and the small 
garden variety called petit gris. Fresh snails 
are available from snail ranches through 
specialty suppliers. The great majority of 
snails, however, are purchased canned; 
most canned snails are produced in 
France or Taiwan.

European flat oysters
Manila clams
often cut into strips for frying or are minced, chopped, processed and canned. The flesh 
is sweet and yellow to orange colored.
The most common Pacific clam is the Manila clam, which resembles a quahog 
but with a ridged shell. Manila clams can be served steamed or raw on the half shell. 
Geoducks are the largest Pacific clam, sometimes weighing up to 10 pounds (4.5 kilo￾grams) each. They look like huge soft-shell clams with a large, 
protruding siphon. Their tender, rich bodies and briny flavor are 
popular in Asian cuisines.
Razor clams, also known as hamaguri, are a long, narrow 
variety farmed worldwide or harvested along the Pacific Ocean 
shoreline from California to Alaska. They are typically 3–6 inches 
(8–15 centimeters) in length. The meat is firm and white with a deli￾cate, sweet flavor. Generally prepared by steaming or grilling in the 
shell, the meat can also be pan-fried or used in chowders.
Mussels (Fr. moules) are found in waters worldwide. They are excellent steamed in 
wine or seasoned broth and can be fried or used in soups or pasta dishes. Blue mussels
are the most common edible mussel. They are found in the wild along the Atlantic Coast 
and are sustainably farmed on both U.S. coasts. Their meat is plump and sweet with a 
firm, muscular texture. The orangish-yellow meat of cultivated mussels tends to be much 
larger than that of wild mussels and therefore worth the added cost.
Greenshell (or greenlip) mussels from New Zealand and Thailand are much larger 
than blue mussels, averaging 8–12 mussels per pound. Their shells are paler gray, with a 
distinctive bright-green edge.
Oysters (Fr. huitres) have a rough gray shell. Their soft, gray, 
briny flesh can be eaten raw directly from the shell. They can 
also be steamed or baked in the shell, shucked and fried, sautéed 
or added to stews or chowders. Most oysters available in 
the United States are commercially farmed and sold 
either live in the shell or shucked. There are four main 
domestic species.
Atlantic oysters, also called American or Eastern 
oysters, have darker, flatter shells than other oysters. 
European flat oysters are often incorrectly called 
Belon (true Belon oysters live only in the Belon river of 
France); they are very round and flat and look like giant 
brownish-green Olympias.
Olympias are native to Washington state’s Pacific Coast, which is the only 
place they are currently produced. Olympias are so tiny (about 
the size of a half dollar) that a pint of meat requires approxi￾mately 250 of these sweet, intensely flavored clams.
Pacific oysters, also called Japanese oysters, are farmed 
along the Pacific Coasts of Canada, Australia, Korea, Japan 
and the United States. They have curly, thick striated shells 
and silvery-gray to gold to almost-white meat.
Although it may seem as though hundreds of oyster species 
are available, only two are commercially significant: the Atlantic oyster 
and the Pacific oyster. These two species yield dozens of differ￾ent varieties, however, depending on their origin. For example, 
Atlantic oysters may be referred to as bluepoints, Chesapeake 
Bay, Florida Gulf, Long Island and so on, whereas Pacific oys￾ters include Penn Cove Select, Westcott Bay, Hamma-Hamma, 
Kumamoto and Portuguese, among others. An oyster’s flavor 
reflects the minerals, nutrients and salts in its water and mud 
bed, so a Bristol from Maine and an Apalachicola from Florida taste 
very different, even though they are the same Atlantic species.

Scallops (Fr. coquilles Saint Jacques) contain an edible 
white adductor muscle that holds together the fan-shaped 
shells. Because they die quickly, they are almost always 
shucked and cleaned on board the ship. The sea scal￾lop and the bay scallop, both cold-water varieties, and 
the calico scallop, a warm-water variety, are the most 
important commercially. Sea scallops are the largest, with 
an average count of 20–30 per pound. Larger sea scallops 
are also available. Bay scallops average 70–90 per pound; 
calico scallops average 70–110 per pound.
Fresh or frozen shucked, cleaned scallops are the most 
common market form, but live scallops in the shell and 
shucked scallops with roe attached (very popular in Europe) are also available. Diver 
scallops are harvested from the ocean by divers who hand-pick each one. They tend to 
be less gritty than those harvested by dragging, and hand-harvesting is more ecologically 
friendly. Scallops are sweet, with a tender texture. Raw scallops should be a translu￾cent ivory color, asymmetrically round and feel springy. They can be steamed, broiled, 
grilled, fried, sautéed or baked. When overcooked, scallops quickly become chewy and 
dry. Only extremely fresh scallops should be eaten raw.
Cephalopods
Octopus is a saltwater dweller with a rounded head and eight tentacles. It is found in 
tropical and subtropical waters worldwide, but commercial farming is not yet practical. 
Most octopus available in the United States is imported, though fresh octopus is found on 
the East Coast during the winter. Octopus is marketed live, fresh or frozen, in sizes rang￾ing from 8 ounces to 60 pounds (250 grams to 27 kilograms). 
With larger species, the meat is generally quite tough and 
requires mechanical tenderization or long, moist-heat cook￾ing. Octopus skin is gray when raw, turning purple 
when cooked. The interior flesh is white, lean, 
firm and flavorful.
Squid, also known by their Italian name, 
calamari, have elongated bodies, each with 
two tentacles and eight arms. They are har￾vested along both U.S. coasts and elsewhere 
around the world. They range in size from an 
average of 8–10 per pound to the giant South 
American squid, which is sold as tenderized steaks. 
Most market squid are less than 10 inches (25 centime￾ters) in length. The squid’s tentacles, mantle (body tube) and fins as 
well as their briny ink sacs are edible. Squid meat is white to ivory 
in color, turning darker with age. It is moderately lean, slightly 
sweet, firm and tender, but it toughens quickly if overcooked. 
Squid are available either fresh or cleaned, cut-up and frozen.
Crustaceans
Crustaceans are found in both fresh and salt water. They have a 
hard outer shell and jointed appendages, and they breathe through 
gills.
Crabs (Fr. crabes) are found along both North American coasts in great numbers and 
are shipped throughout the world in fresh, frozen and canned forms. Crab meat varies 
in flavor and texture and can be used in a range of prepared dishes, from chowders to 
curries to casseroles. Crabs purchased live should stay alive up to five days with proper 
storage; dead crabs should not be used.

Crayfish
King crabs are the largest crabs, usually around 10 pounds (4.5 kilograms). They are 
caught in the very cold waters of the northern Pacific and are synonymous with Alaska. 
Unfortunately, the Alaskan fishery for red king crab has been closed because of a serious 
decline in the population. Some other species may be available. Consult the organiza￾tions listed on page 515 to inform purchasing decision.
Dungeness crabs are only found in the Pacific Ocean along the West Coast of the United 
States and Canada. They weigh 1½–4 pounds (680 grams to 
1.8 kilograms) and have delicate, sweet meat. They are 
sold live, precooked and frozen, or as picked meat, usu￾ally in 5-pound (2.2-kilogram) vacuum-packed cans. 
Dungeness crab is often used in crab cakes, sauces and 
prepared dishes or served whole after being quickly 
steamed.
Blue crabs are found along the entire eastern sea￾board and account for approximately 50 percent of the 
total weight of all crab species harvested in the United 
States. Their meat is rich and sweet. Blue crabs are avail￾able as hard-shell or soft-shell. Hard-shell crabs are sold 
live, precooked and frozen, or as picked meat. Soft-shell 
crabs are those harvested within 6 hours after shedding 
their shells (molting) and are available live or frozen. They are often steamed 
and served whole. Soft-shell crabs can be sautéed, fried, broiled or added 
to soups or stews. Blue crabs are sold by size, with an average diameter of 
4–7 inches (10–18 centimeters).
The Jonah crab is popular as a less-expensive alternative to other crab 
species. They are harvested year-round along the Atlantic coast from Florida to 
Newfoundland. Although related to the Pacific Dungeness crab, Atlantic Jonah crabs are 
slightly larger, averaging 7 inches (17.5 centimeters) in width, with larger claws. Their 
mild, white flesh can be used in virtually any crab recipe, and their claws can be substi￾tuted for stone crab claws.
Snow or queen crabs, also known as opie, are an abundant species, most often 
used as a substitute for the scarcer and more expensive king crab. They are harvested 
from Alaskan waters and along the eastern coast of Canada. Whole snow crabs are 
marketed at 1.5–2.5 pounds (720–1200 grams). Snow crab is usually sold precooked, 
canned or frozen. The delicate, flaky meat can be used in soups, salads, omelets or 
other prepared dishes.
Stone crabs live in the Atlantic Ocean from Connecticut to the Caribbean and in the 
Gulf of Mexico; however, over 95 percent of those commercially harvested in the United 
States come from Florida. Stone crabs are generally available only as cooked claws, 
either fresh or frozen (the claws cannot be frozen raw because the meat sticks to the 
shell). In stone crab fisheries only the claw is harvested. After the claw is removed, the 
crab is returned to the water, where in approximately 18 months it regenerates a new 
claw. Claws average 2½–5½ ounces (75–155 grams) each. The meat is firm, with a sweet 
flavor similar to lobster. Cracked claws are served hot or cold, usually with cocktail sauce 
or lemon butter.
Crayfish (Fr. écrevisses), generally called crayfish in the Northern United States and 
crawfish or crawdad in the Southern United States, are freshwater creatures that look like 
miniature lobsters. They are harvested from the wild or aquafarmed 
in Louisiana and the Pacific Northwest. They are from 3½ to 7 
inches (8 to 17.5 centimeters) in length when marketed and 
may be purchased live or precooked and frozen. The 
lean meat, found mostly in the tail, is sweet and tender. 
Crayfish can be boiled whole and served hot or cold. 
The tail meat can be deep-fried or used in soups, bisque 
or sauces. Crayfish are a staple of Cajun cuisine, often used 
in gumbo, étouffée and jambalaya. Whole crayfish turn brilliant

Head-on shrimp
red when cooked and have been used as a luxurious garnish since the days of French 
grande cuisine.
Lobsters have brown to blue-black outer shells and firm, white meat with a rich, 
sweet flavor. Lobster shells turn red when cooked. They are usually poached, steamed, 
simmered, baked or grilled and can be served hot or cold. Picked meat can be used in 
prepared dishes, soups or sautés. Lobsters must be kept alive until just before cooking. 
Do not eat lobsters that have died before cooking. The Maine, also known as American 
or clawed lobster, and the spiny lobster are the most commonly marketed species.
Maine lobsters have edible meat in both their tails and claws. Considered supe￾rior in flavor to all other lobsters, they come from the cold waters along the northeast 
coast of the United States and are purchased by weight (e.g., 1¼ pounds [525 grams], 
1½ pounds [650 grams] or 2 pounds [900 grams] each), or as chix (weighing less than 
1 pound [450 grams]). Frozen lobster is available in numerous forms, as raw lobster tails 
or as cooked, picked meat. Maine lobsters may also be purchased as culls (lobsters with 
only one claw) or bullets (lobsters with no claws).
Figure  20.4 shows a cross-section of a Maine lobster and identifies the stomach, 
tomalley (the olive-green liver) and coral (the roe or fish egg sacs). The stomach is not 
eaten; the tomalley and coral are very flavorful and are often used in the preparation of 
sauces and other items.
Spiny lobsters, harvested in many parts of the world, have very small claws and 
are valuable only for their meaty tails. Nearly all spiny lobsters marketed in the United 
States are sold as frozen tails weighing 1–5 pounds (450 grams to 2.4 kilograms), often 
identified as rock lobster. Those found off Florida and Brazil and in the Caribbean are 
marketed as warm-water tails; those found off South Africa, Australia and New Zealand 
are called cold-water tails. Cold-water spiny tails are considered superior in flavor and 
texture to their warm-water cousins.
Shrimp (Fr. crevettes) are found worldwide and are widely 
popular. Gulf whites, pinks, browns and black tigers are 
just a few of the dozens of shrimp varieties used in food 
 service operations. Although fresh, head-on shrimp are 
available, the most commonly sold form is raw, head-off 
(also called green headless) shrimp with the shell on. Most 
shrimp are deheaded and frozen at sea. Shrimp 
are available in many forms: raw, peeled and 
deveined; cooked, peeled and deveined; 
and individually quick-frozen, as well as in 
a variety of processed, breaded or canned 
products. Shrimp are graded by size, which 
can range from 400 per pound (titi) to 8 per pound (extra- colossal) 
and are sold in counts per pound. For example, shrimp marketed as

“21–26 count” means that there is an average of 21–26 shrimp per pound; shrimp mar￾keted as “U-10” means that there are fewer than 10 shrimp per pound.
Prawn is often used interchangeably with the word shrimp in English-speaking coun￾tries. Although it is perhaps more accurate to refer to freshwater species as prawns and 
saltwater species as shrimp, in commercial practice, prawn refers to any large shrimp. 
Equally confusing, scampi is the Italian name for the Dublin Bay prawn (which is actu￾ally a species of miniature lobster), but in the United States scampi refers to a dish of 
shrimp sautéed in garlic butter.
NUTRITIONAL INFORMATION FOR FISH 
AND SHELLFISH
Fish and shellfish are low in calories, fat and sodium and are high in protein and 
 vitamins A, B and D. Fish and shellfish are also high in minerals, especially calcium 
(particularly in canned fish with edible bones), phosphorus, potassium and iron (espe￾cially mollusks). Fish are high in a group of polyunsaturated fatty acids called Omega-3, 
which may help combat high blood cholesterol levels and aid in preventing some heart 
disease. Shellfish are not as high in cholesterol as was once thought. Crustaceans are 
higher in cholesterol than mollusks, but both have considerably lower levels than red 
meat or eggs.
Ocean and Waterway Invaders
An invasive species refers to any living 
organism—fish, plant, amphibian, bacteria, 
insect, mammal—that is not indigenous 
(native) to an area in which it is now causing 
damage. invasive species are usually brought 
into the new area by humans, intentionally 
or unintentionally. in its native environment, 
the organism may be a well-controlled 
part of the food chain, but unleashed in a 
new environment, it can reproduce rapidly 
without natural predators and will overwhelm 
native plants and animals by eating them or 
competing with them for food and habitat. 
An invasive species can destroy diversity, 
change soil and water chemistry and clog 
lakes, streams and sewage pipes, causing long￾term financial and environmental damage. 
Eradication efforts are generally unsuccessful, 
meaning that humans must learn to control 
or prevent the spread of an invasion as best 
they can.
Varieties of invasive fish and crustaceans 
making new homes for themselves in North 
American waterways include several species 
of Asian carp, zebra mussels, green crabs 
and sea squirts. One of the most well-known 
recent invaders is the tropical lionfish with 
its beautiful but toxic fins. lionfish were 
unintentionally transplanted from their native 
western Pacific waters to the Caribbean, 
Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic when they 
were dumped into waterways from home 
aquariums. Because lionfish reproduce rapidly, 
grow quickly and have no natural predators 
in these oceans, they quickly became a multi￾billion-dollar problem. lionfish eat small 
crustaceans and the young of commercially 
important fish, especially grouper and snapper. 
The huge appetite of the lionfish is destroying 
reef habitats. When other options failed, 
scientists turned to chefs for help.
lionfish fins have venomous spikes that 
serve as protection against predators, but 
the toxin does not affect its flesh or internal 
organs. The venom is also destroyed by the 
heat of cooking. lionfish must be caught by 
spearfishing divers, but once brought ashore 
they are cleaned and prepped like any other 
fish, yielding small, firm, white fillets with a 
mild flavor. Chefs throughout the Caribbean 
and eastern latin America initially offered wild￾caught lionfish as a local delicacy for tourists. 
Because the fish works well with a wide range 
of cooking techniques, from deep-frying to 
seviche and sashimi, it can be used in different 
cuisines and with different flavor profiles.
it turns out that lionfish are also healthy; 
they are high in Omega-3 fatty acids and 
low in saturated fat and heavy metals. 
Wild-caught lionfish are listed as a “Best 
Choice” sustainable fish by the Monterey Bay 
Aquarium. Restaurants and grocery chains in 
affected areas of the United States now sell 
fresh lionfish fillets. Scientists hope that the 
culinary interest will spread, helping to reduce 
the lionfish population to manageable levels.
lionfish is not the only invasive species 
that might be controlled by human predators. 
Tiny Asian shore crabs, several varieties of 
Asian carp, sea squirts, cannibalistic tiger 
shrimp and other aquatic creatures that are 
foodstuffs in their native regions could be 
delicious menu additions. All chefs need is an 
increase in consumer demand. Scientists hope 
that food writers and chefs working to educate 
consumers about these unusual, but tasty, 
invaders may generate the demand necessary 
to reduce their environmental impact.

PURCHASING AND STORING FISH AND SHELLFISH
High-quality fish and shellfish are some of the most expensive, and most perishable, 
food items on a restaurant’s menu. It is extremely important to purchase these products 
at the peak of freshness and to ensure that frozen items were not mishandled during 
shipping or storage. They are subject to voluntary grading, which is one indication of 
freshness. You must be able to judge the freshness of fish and shellfish for yourself and 
determine which market form is best for the needs of your operation. Once received, 
proper storage is essential to the shelf life of the product and to the health and safety of 
your customers.
 Purchasing Fish and Shellfish
Unlike mandatory meat and poultry inspections, fish and shellfish inspections are vol￾untary. They are performed in a fee-for-service program supervised by the United States 
Department of Commerce (USDC). Type 1 inspection services cover plant, product and 
processing methods from the raw material to the final product. The Processed Under 
Federal Inspection (PUFI) mark or statement shown in Figure 20.5 can be used only on 
product labels processed under Type 1 inspection services. It signifies that the product is 
safe and wholesome, is properly labeled, has reasonably good flavor and odor and was 
produced under inspection in an approved establishment.
Type 2 inspection services are usually performed in a warehouse, processing plant 
or cold storage facility on specific product lots. A lot inspection determines whether the 
product complies with purchase agreement criteria (usually defined in a spec sheet) such 
as condition, weight, labeling and packaging integrity. Figure 20.6 shows a product lot 
inspection stamp.
Type 3 inspection services are for sanitation only. Fishing vessels or plants that meet 
the requirements are recognized as official establishments and are included in the USDC 
Approved List of the NOAA seafood inspection program. The list is useful for purchasing 
agents and seafood buyers. Updated copies of the list are published online.
Only fish processed under Type 1 inspection services are eligible for grading. Each 
type of fish has its own grading criteria, but because of the great variety of fish and 
shellfish, the USDC has been able to set grading criteria for only the most common 
types. The grades assigned to fish are A, B or C. Grade A products are top quality 
and must have good flavor and odor and be practically free of physical blemishes or 
defects. The great majority of fresh and frozen fish and shellfish consumed in restau￾rants is Grade A. Figure 20.7 shows a Grade A stamp. Grade B indicates good quality; 
Grade C indicates fairly good quality. Grade B and C products are most often canned 
or processed.

How Fresh Is Frozen 
Fish?
Fresh: The item is not and has never 
been frozen.
Chilled: Now used by some in the 
industry to replace the more ambiguous 
“fresh”; indicates that the item was 
refrigerated—that is, held at 30–34°F 
(–1–1°C).
Flash-frozen: The item was rapidly flash￾frozen at extreme low temperatures on 
board the ship or at a processing plant 
within hours of being caught.
Fresh-frozen: The item was quick-frozen
while still fresh but not as quickly as 
flash-frozen.
Frozen: The item was subjected to 
temperatures of 0°F (–18°C) or lower 
to preserve its inherent quality.
Glazed: A frozen product dipped in 
water; the ice forms a glaze that 
protects the item from freezer burn.
Fancy: Marketing term used to indicate 
the product was previously frozen.
Fish fillets, whole fish and shellfish, such 
as shrimp, may be coated with water 
or glazed during the freezing process to 
help protect them from dehydrating. The 
addition of water-retaining agents and 
antioxidants to help preserve the fish 
is permitted.

Farming the Seas
Aquaculture or fish farming has been practiced 
in Asia for thousands of years. As wild fish and 
shellfish have been depleted by overfishing, 
aquaculture has grown into a major industry 
in the United States and many other non￾Asian countries. Just over 60 percent of the 
seafood consumed in the United States today is 
imported, and more than half of this imported 
seafood is farm-raised.
Aquaculture can take place in closed 
environments, where water is constantly 
circulated through tanks and ponds. Net pens 
or cages employed offshore can also hold vast 
numbers of fish. Mollusks (clams, oysters and 
mussels) are farmed in near-shore beds or, 
sometimes in the case of mussels, on long lines 
or even on the bases of offshore oil rigs. Catfish 
and trout have long been farm-raised in the 
United States, but now salmon, tilapia, hybrid 
striped bass, abalone, crayfish, freshwater 
prawns, shrimp and sturgeon are also farmed. 
Constant experimentation is taking place with 
different varieties: Norwegian scientists are 
working to raise halibut in aquafarms, and in 
California, sturgeon are being raised for their 
caviar with the help of Russian experts.
For the food service industry, aquaculture 
can mean that many fish are no longer 
seasonal; there is a constant supply, less 
price fluctuation and more standardized 
quality. As with all industries involved in 
food production, aquaculture is subject to 
federal and state regulation for both domestic 
and imported products. Fish farming is not 
without its critics, however, as environmental 
damage can result from poor management 
practices. Concerns have been raised regarding 
the use of chemicals and antibiotics. The 
food given to aquafarmed species also raises 
concerns. The feed may contain genetically 
modified ingredients or excessive amounts of 
soy and corn and requires large quantities of 
other fish. in response to such concerns, an 
organic movement is growing (although still 
unregulated) within the industry.
Determining Freshness of Fish and Shellfish
Because fish and shellfish are highly perishable, an inspection stamp does not necessar￾ily ensure top quality or freshness. A few hours at the wrong temperature or a couple 
of days in the refrigerator can turn high-quality inspected fish or shellfish into garbage. 
Freshness should be checked before purchasing and again just before cooking.
Determine freshness with the following criteria:
Smell: This is by far the easiest way to determine freshness. Fresh fish should have a 
slight sea smell or no odor at all. Any off-odors or ammonia odors are a sure sign of 
aged or improperly handled fish.
Eyes: The eyes should be clear and full. Sunken eyes mean that the fish is drying out 
and is probably not fresh.
Gills: The gills should be intact and bright red. Brown gills are a sign of age.
Texture: Generally the flesh of fresh fish should be firm. Mushy flesh or flesh that 
does not spring back when pressed with a finger is a sign of poor quality or age.
Fins and scales: Fins and scales should be moist and full without excessive drying 
on the outer edges. Dry fins or scales are a sign of age; damaged fins or scales may 
be a sign of mishandling.
Moistness: Fish cuts should be moist and glistening, without bruises or dark spots. 
Edges should not be brown or dry.
Movement: Shellfish should be purchased live and should show movement. 
Lobsters and other crustaceans should be active. Clams, mussels and oysters that 
are partially opened should snap shut when tapped with a finger. (Exceptions are 
geoduck, razor and steamer clams whose siphons protrude, preventing the shell 
from closing completely.) Ones that do not close are dead and should not be 
used. Avoid mollusks with broken shells or heavy shells that may be filled with 
mud or sand. inspect the gills for freshness.

 Market Forms of Fish and Shellfish 
 Fish are available from wholesalers in a variety of market forms: 
▪ Whole or round: As caught, intact. 
▪ Drawn: Viscera (internal organs) are removed; most whole fish are purchased 
this way. 
▪ Dressed: Viscera, gills, fins and scales are removed. 
▪ Pan-dressed: Viscera and gills are removed; fish is scaled and fins and tail are 
trimmed. The head is usually removed, although small fish, such as trout, may 
be pan-dressed with the head still attached. Pan-dressed fish are ready to be 
pan-fried. 
▪ Butterflied: A pan-dressed fish or fillet, boned and opened flat like a book. The 
two sides remain attached by the back or belly skin. 
▪ Fillet: The side of a fish removed intact, boneless or semiboneless, with or 
without skin. 
▪ Steak: A cross-section slice, with a small section of backbone attached 
known as darne in French; usually prepared from large round fish such 
as salmon, swordfish or tuna. 
▪ Wheel or center-cut: Used for swordfish and sharks, which are cut into large 
boneless pieces from which steaks are then cut.

Chefs purchase fish in the market forms most practical for each operation. Although 
fish fabrication is a relatively simple chore requiring little specialized equipment, before 
deciding to cut fish on premises, consider the following:
	▪ The food service operation’s ability to utilize the bones and trim that cutting 
whole fish produces; yield after fabrication can vary depending on a chef’s skill
	▪ Employees’ ability to fabricate fillets, steaks or portions as needed
	▪ Storage facilities
	▪ The product’s intended use
Most shellfish can be purchased live in the shell, shucked (the meat removed from 
the shell) or processed. Both live and shucked shellfish are usually purchased by counts 
(i.e., the number per volume). For example, standard live Eastern oysters are packed 
200–250 (the count) per bushel (the unit of volume); standard Eastern shucked oyster 
meats are packed 350 per gallon. Crustaceans are sometimes packed by size based 
on the number of pieces per pound; for example, crab legs or shrimp are often sold 
in counts per pound. Crustaceans are also sold either by grades based on size (whole 
crabs) or by weight (lobsters).
Storing Fish and Shellfish
The most important concern when storing fish and shellfish is temperature. All fresh fish 
should be stored at temperatures between 30°F and 34°F (–1°C and 1°C). Fish stored in 
a refrigerator at 41°F (5°C) will have approximately half the shelf life of fish stored at 
32°F (0°C).
Most fish are shipped on ice and should be stored on ice in the refrigerator as soon 
as possible after receipt. Whole fish should be layered directly in crushed or shaved 
ice in a perforated pan so that the melted ice water drains away. If crushed or shaved 
ice is not available, cubed ice may be used provided it is put in plastic bags and gently 
placed on top of the fish to prevent bruising and denting. Fabricated and portioned 
fish may be wrapped in moisture-proof packaging before icing to prevent the ice and 
water from damaging the exposed flesh. Fish stored on ice should be drained and re￾iced daily.
Fresh scallops, fish fillets that are purchased in plastic trays and oyster and clam meats 
should be set on or packed in ice. Do not let scallops, fillets or meats come into direct 
contact with the ice.
Clams, mussels and oysters should be stored at 41°F (5°C), at high humidity and left 
in the boxes or net bags in which they were shipped. Under ideal conditions, shellfish 
can be kept alive for up to 1 week. Never store live shellfish in plastic bags, and do not 
ice them.
If a saltwater tank is not available, live lobsters, crabs and other crustaceans 
should be kept in boxes with seaweed or damp newspaper to keep them moist. Most 
crustaceans circulate salt water over their gills; icing them or placing them in fresh 
water will kill them. Lobsters and crabs will live for several days after purchase under 
ideal conditions.
Like most frozen foods, frozen fish should be kept at temperatures of 0°F (–18°C) 
or colder. Colder temperatures greatly increase shelf life. Frozen fish should be thawed 
in the refrigerator; once thawed, it should be treated like fresh fish. Reduced oxygen 
packaged fish that is labeled to keep frozen until time of use must be removed from its 
packaging before thawing.
 Whole fish properly stored in a perforated 
pan and covered with crushed ice.

 FABRICATING PROCEDURES FOR FISH 
AND SHELLFISH 
 As discussed, fish and shellfish can be purchased in many forms. Despite the availability 
of portioned fish, a chef should master several important fish fabrication techniques. 
Purchasing whole fish saves money and allows chefs to cut it to their exact specifica￾tions. Here we present several procedures for cutting, cleaning and otherwise fabricating 
or preparing fish and shellfish for cooking and serving. 
 Procedure for Scaling Fish 
 This procedure is used to remove the scales from fish that will be cooked with the skin on. 
 Place the fish on a work surface or in a large 
sink. Grip the fish by the tail and, working 
from the tail toward the head, scrape the 
scales off with a fish scaler or the back of 
a knife. Be careful not to damage the flesh 
by pushing too hard. Turn the fish over and 
remove the scales from the other side. Rinse 
the fish under cool water. 
 Procedure for Pan-Dressing Flatfish 
➊ Place the scaled fish on a cutting board 
and remove the head by making a V-shaped 
cut around it with a chef ’s knife. Pull the head 
away and remove the viscera. 
➋ Rinse the fish under cold water, removing 
all traces of blood and viscera from the cavity. 
➌ Using a pair of kitchen shears, trim off the 
tail and all of the fins. 
M20_LABE1163_07_SE_C20.indd 531 14/11/23 11:55 AM532 CHAPTER TWENTY
 Procedure for Filleting Round Fish 
➋ Turn the knife toward the tail; using smooth strokes, cut from head to tail, 
parallel to the backbone. The knife should bump against the backbone so that 
no flesh is wasted; you will feel the knife cutting through the small pin bones. 
Cut the fillet completely free from the bones. Repeat on the other side. 
➌ Trim the rib bones from the fillet with a 
flexible boning knife. 
➍ The finished fillet. 
 Round fish produce two fillets, one from either side. 
 Procedure for Filleting Flatfish 
 Flatfish produce four fillets: two large bilateral fillets from the top and two smaller bilateral fil￾lets from the bottom. if the fish fillets are going to be cooked with the skin on, the fish should be 
scaled before cooking (it is easier to scale the fish before it is filleted). if the skin is going to be 
removed before cooking, it is not necessary to scale the fish. 
➊ With the dark side of the fish facing up, cut 
along the backbone from head to tail with the 
tip of a flexible boning knife. 
➋ Turn the knife and, using smooth strokes, 
cut between the flesh and the rib bones, keep￾ing the flexible blade against the bone. Cut the 
fillet completely free from the fish. Remove the 
second fillet, following the same procedure. 
➌ Turn the fish over and remove the fillets 
from the bottom half of the fish, following the 
same procedure. 
➊ Using a chef ’s knife, cut down to the 
backbone just behind the gills. do not remove 
the head. 
M20_LABE1163_07_SE_C20.indd 532 14/11/23 11:55 AMFiSH ANd SHEllFiSH 533
Procedure for Skinning Fish Fillets
We use a salmon fillet in the photos to demonstrate the procedure for skinning fish fillets. Use 
the same procedure to skin all types of fish fillets.
Place the fillet on a cutting board with the skin 
side down. Starting at the tail, use a meat slicer 
or a chef ’s knife to cut between the flesh and skin. 
Angle the knife down toward the skin, grip the skin 
tightly with one hand and use a smooth sawing 
motion to cut the skin cleanly away from the flesh.
Place the fillet (either skinless or not) on the cut￾ting board, skin side down. Starting at the front or 
head end of the fillet, use your fingertips to locate 
the bones and use the pliers to pull them out one 
by one.
Place the fillet on the cutting board, skin side 
down. Using a slicer or chef ’s knife, cut slices of 
the desired weight. The tranche can be cut to the 
desired size by adjusting the angle of the knife. 
The greater the angle, the larger the surface area 
of the tranche.
Procedure for Pulling Pin Bones from Salmon Fillets
Round fish fillets contain a row of intramuscular bones running the length of the fillet. Known as 
pin bones, they are usually cut out with a knife to produce boneless fillets. in the case of salmon, 
they can be removed with salmon tweezers or small needle-nose pliers.
Procedure for Cutting Tranches
A tranche is a slice cut from fillets of large flat or round fish. Usually cut on an angle, tranches 
look large and increase plate coverage.
M20_LABE1163_07_SE_C20.indd 533 14/11/23 11:55 AM534 CHAPTER TWENTY
Procedure for Cutting Steaks from Salmon and Similarly Sized Round Fish
Using a chef ’s knife, cut through the fish, slicing 
steaks of the desired thickness. The steaks will con￾tain some bones that are not necessarily removed.
➊ Pull the tentacles (left) and mantle or body 
(right) apart.
➋ Pull the transparent quill (left) from the 
mantle and discard.
➌ Peel off the brown skin and discard.
➍ Cut the tentacles from the head, inserting 
the knife just below the eyes. Reserve the ink 
sac if desired and discard the remaining organs.
➎ Open the tentacles to expose the beak. Pull 
the beak out and discard.
❻ Rinse the squid in cold water. if desired the 
squid may be cut into strips for cooking.
Steaks are produced from salmon and similarly sized round fish by making crosscuts of the 
whole fish. First scale, gut and remove the fins from the fish. Then:

Procedure for Cleaning Soft-Shell Crab
➊ Using kitchen shears, cut off the front of 
the crab about ½ inch (1.2 centimeters) behind 
the eyes and mouth. Squeeze out the contents 
of the sac located behind the crab face.
➋ lift one of the pointed ends of the 
shell and remove the gills and discard 
them. Repeat on the other side.
➌ Turn the crab over and snip off the flap 
(known as the apron). Rinse the crab in cold water 
and pat dry.
➊ Grip the shrimp’s tail between your thumb 
and forefinger. Use your other thumb and fore￾finger to grip the legs and the edge of the shell.
➋ Pull the legs and shell away from the flesh, 
leaving the tail and first joint of the shell in 
place if desired.
➌ Place the shrimp on a cutting board and 
use a paring knife to make a shallow cut down 
the back of the shrimp, exposing the digestive 
tract or “vein.”
Procedure for Peeling and Deveining Shrimp
Peeling and deveining shrimp is a simple procedure done in most commercial kitchens. The tail 
portion of the shell is often left on the peeled shrimp to give it an attractive appearance or make it 
easier to eat. This procedure can be used on both cooked and uncooked shrimp.
➍ Pull out the vein while rinsing the shrimp 
under cold water.
M20_LABE1163_07_SE_C20.indd 535 14/11/23 11:55 AM536 CHAPTER TWENTY
Procedure for Butterflying Shrimp
instead of making a shallow cut to expose the vein, 
make a deeper cut that nearly slices the shrimp 
into two bilateral halves. Pull out the vein while 
rinsing the shrimp under cold water.
➊ Place the live lobster on its back on a 
cutting board and pierce its head with the point 
of a chef ’s knife. Then, in one smooth stroke, 
bring the knife down and cut through the body 
and tail without splitting it completely in half.
➋ Use your hands to crack the lobster’s back 
so that it lies flat. Crack the claws with the 
back of a chef ’s knife.
➌ Cut through the tail and curl each 
half of the tail to the side. Remove and 
discard the stomach. The tomalley (the 
olive-green liver) and if present the coral 
(the roe) can be removed and saved for 
a sauce or other preparation.
Butterflying raw shrimp improves their appearance and increases their surface area for even 
cooking. To butterfly shrimp, first peel them using the procedure just outlined. Then:
Procedure for Preparing Live Lobsters for Broiling
A whole lobster can be partially cooked by plunging it into boiling water or court bouillon for 
2 – 3 minutes. Then before broiling, it must be split lengthwise before cooking.
M20_LABE1163_07_SE_C20.indd 536 14/11/23 11:55 AMFiSH ANd SHEllFiSH 537
Procedure for Preparing Live Lobsters for Sautéing
A whole live lobster may also be cut into smaller pieces for sautéing or other preparations.
➊ Using the point of a chef ’s knife, pierce the 
lobster’s head.
➋ Cut off the claws and arms. ➌ Cut the tail into cross-sections.
➍ Split the head and thorax in half. The tomal￾ley and coral (if present) can be removed and 
saved for further use. The head and legs may be 
added to the recipe for flavor, but there is very 
little meat in them.
➎ Crack the claws with a firm blow, using the 
back of a chef ’s knife.
Procedure for Removing Cooked Lobster Meat from the Shell
Many recipes call for cooked lobster meat. Cook the live lobster by plunging it into a boiling 
court bouillon, then cooking at a low boil (205–210°F [96–98°C]) for 6–8 minutes per pound. 
Remove the lobster and allow it to cool until it can be easily handled. Then:
➊ Pull the claws and large legs away from the 
body. Break the claw away from the leg. Split 
the legs with a chef ’s knife and remove the 
meat, using your fingers or a pick.
➋ Carefully crack the claw with a mallet or 
the back of a chef ’s knife without damaging the 
meat. Pull out the claw meat in one piece.
M20_LABE1163_07_SE_C20.indd 537 14/11/23 11:55 AM538 CHAPTER TWENTY
Procedure for Opening Clams
Opening raw clams efficiently requires practice. like all mollusks, clams should be cleaned under 
cold running water with a brush to remove all mud, silt and sand that may be stuck to their 
shells. A knife is more easily inserted into a clam if the clam is washed and allowed to relax in the 
refrigerator for at least 1 hour.
➌ Pull the lobster’s tail away from its body 
and use kitchen shears to trim away the soft 
membrane on the underside of the tail.
➍ Pull the meat out of the shell in one piece.
➊ Wearing a mesh safety glove, hold the 
cleaned clam in the palm of your hand; the 
notch in the edge of the shell should be toward 
your thumb. With the fingers of the same hand, 
squeeze and pull the blade of the clam knife 
between the clamshells. do not push on the 
knife handle with your other hand; you will not 
be able to control the knife if it slips and you 
can cut yourself.
➋ Pull the knife between the shells until it 
cuts the muscle. Twist the knife to pry the shells 
apart. Slide the knife tip along the top shell 
and cut through the muscle. Twist the top shell, 
breaking it free at the hinge; discard it.
➌ Use the knife tip to release the clam from 
the bottom shell.
M20_LABE1163_07_SE_C20.indd 538 14/11/23 11:55 AMFiSH ANd SHEllFiSH 539
Procedure for Opening Oysters
➊ Clean the oyster by brushing it under 
running water.
➋ Wearing a mesh safety glove, hold the 
cleaned oyster firmly in the palm of your hand. 
insert the tip of an oyster knife in the hinge and 
use a twisting motion to pop the hinge apart. 
do not put too much forward pressure on the 
knife; it can slip and you could stab yourself.
➌ Slide the knife along the top of the shell to 
release the oyster from the shell. discard the 
top shell.
➍ Use the knife tip to release the oyster from 
the bottom shell.
➎ Fresh raw oysters on the half shell with 
seaweed garnish.
Procedure for Cleaning and Debearding Mussels
Mussels are not normally eaten raw. Before cooking, a clump of dark threads called the beard
must be removed. Because this could kill the mussel, cleaning and debearding must be done as 
close to cooking time as possible.
➊ Clean the mussel with a brush under cold 
running water to remove sand and grit.
➋ Pull the beard away from the mussel with 
your fingers or a small pair of pliers.

COOKING METHODS FOR FISH AND SHELLFISH
Fish and shellfish can be prepared by the dry-heat cooking methods of broiling and 
grilling, roasting (baking), sautéing, pan-frying and deep-frying as well as the moist-heat 
cooking methods of steaming, poaching and simmering. Because there are so many vari￾eties of fish in different regions of the world, selecting the type of fish to use depends on 
the types of fish available and the preferred cooking method. All fish and shellfish can 
be easily overcooked, regardless of the method used. Learning to determine doneness, 
discussed here, is an essential skill.
When selecting fish for a particular recipe, consult Table 20.2 to find the appropriate 
fish substitute. The fish listed within a category of characteristics can serve as substitutes 
for each other. The fish listed here are not endangered and are mentioned in this text.

 Determining Doneness 
 Unlike most meats and poultry, nearly all fish and shellfish are inherently tender and 
should be cooked just until done. Overcooking is the most common mistake made when 
preparing fish and shellfish. The Canadian Department of Fisheries recommends that all 
fish be cooked 10 minutes for every inch (2.5 centimeters) of thickness, regardless of 
cooking method. Although this may be a good general policy, variables such as the type 
and form of fish and the exact cooking method used suggest that one or more of the 
following methods of determining doneness are more appropriate for professional food 
service operations: 
▪ Translucent flesh becomes opaque: The raw flesh of most fish and shellfish 
appears somewhat translucent. As the proteins coagulate during cooking, the 
flesh becomes opaque. 
▪ Flesh becomes firm: The flesh of most fish and shellfish firms as it cooks. 
Doneness can be tested by judging the resistance of the flesh when pressed with 
a finger. Raw or undercooked fish or shellfish are mushy and soft. As it cooks, the 
flesh offers more resistance and springs back quickly. 
▪ Flesh separates from the bones easily: The flesh of raw fish remains firmly attached 
to the bones. As the fish cooks, the flesh and bones separate easily. 
▪ Flesh begins to flake: Fish flesh consists of short muscle fibers separated by thin 
connective tissue. As the fish cooks, the connective tissue breaks down and the 
groups of muscle fibers begin to flake (i.e., separate from one another). Fish is 
done when the flesh begins to flake. If the flesh flakes easily, the fish will be 
overdone and dry. 
 Like other foods, fish and shellfish are subject to carryover cooking. Because they 
cook quickly and at low temperatures, it is better to undercook fish and shellfish and 
allow carryover cooking or residual heat to finish the cooking process. 
 DRY-HEAT COOKING METHODS FOR FISH 
AND SHELLFISH 
 Dry-heat cooking methods are those that do not require additional moisture at any time 
during the cooking process. The dry-heat cooking methods used with fish and shellfish 
are broiling and grilling, roasting (usually referred to as baking when used with fish and 
shellfish), sautéing, pan-frying and deep-frying. 
 Broiling and Grilling 
 After brushing with oil or butter, fish can be grilled directly on the grate or placed on 
a heated platter under the broiler. Broiled or grilled fish should have a lightly charred 
surface and a slightly smoky flavor as a result of the intense radiant heat of the broiler or 
grill. The interior should be moist and juicy. Broiled or grilled shellfish meat should be 
moist and tender with only slight coloration from the grill or broiler. 
 Selecting Fish and Shellfish to Broil or Grill 
 Nearly all types of fish and shellfish can be successfully broiled or grilled. Salmon, trout, 
swordfish and other oily fish are especially well suited to grilling. Lean fish such as bass 
and snapper will also hold their shape when grilled. It is better to broil fillets of lean 
flatfish with delicate textures, such as flounder and sole, than place them directly on a 
grill grate. These fillets should be placed on a preheated broiler (sizzler) platter before 
being placed under the broiler. 
 Oysters and clams are often broiled on the half shell with flavored butters, bread 
crumbs or other garnishes and served sizzling hot. Squid can be stuffed, secured with 
a toothpick and broiled or grilled. Split lobsters, king crabs and snow crabs are often 
broiled or grilled after being brushed with butter. Whole lobsters can be split and broiled 
or grilled, or their tails can be removed, split and cooked separately. Large crab legs can 
 Properly cooked fish remains moist and 
just begins to show flakiness between the 
muscle fibers. 
 Overcooked fish looks dry and falls apart 
when cut. White coagulated protein is visible 
between the muscle fibers. 
M20_LABE1163_07_SE_C20.indd 541 14/11/23 11:55 AM542 CHAPTER TWENTY
also be split and broiled or grilled. Shrimp and scallops are often broiled in flavored but￾ters or grilled on skewers for easy handling.
Seasoning Fish and Shellfish to Broil or Grill
All fish should be brushed lightly with butter or oil before being placed on the grill 
or under the broiler. The butter or oil prevents sticking and helps leaner fish retain 
moisture. For most fish, a simple seasoning of salt and pepper suffices. But some fish 
respond well to marinades, especially marinades made with white wine and lemon juice. 
Delicately flavored fish should be marinated for only a brief time. (Even marinated fish 
should be brushed with butter or oil before cooking.) Herbs should be avoided because 
they will burn from the intense heat of the broiler or grill, although the smoke from 
herbs such as fennel, lavender or thyme can impart flavor to the outside of fish when it 
is grilled whole.
Clams, oysters and other shellfish that are stuffed or cooked with butters, vegetables, 
bacon or other accompaniments or garnishes gain flavor from these ingredients. Be care￾ful, however, not to overpower the delicate flavors of the shellfish by adding too many 
strong flavorings.
Accompaniments to Broiled and Grilled Fish and Shellfish
Lemon wedges are the traditional accompaniment to broiled or grilled fish and shell￾fish. Lemon wedges can be served as the only accompaniments or with sauces made 
separately. Butter sauces such as Beurre Blanc (page 257) are popular, as their richness 
complements the lean fish. Vegetable coulis are a good choice for a healthier, lower-fat 
accompaniment. If an item is cooked on a broiler platter with a seasoned butter, it is 
often served with that butter.
Almost any side dish goes well with broiled or grilled fish or shellfish. Fried or boiled 
potatoes, pasta and rice are all good choices. Grilled vegetables are a natural choice.
Procedure for Broiling or Grilling Fish and Shellfish
Fish is delicate and must be carefully handled to achieve an attractive finished product. When 
broiling whole fish or fillets with their skin still on, score the skin by making several diagonal 
slashes approximately ¼ inch (6 millimeters) deep at even intervals. This prevents the fish from 
curling during cooking, promotes even cooking and creates a more attractive finished product. 
Pat the skin dry because moisture will prevent it from browning. Be especially careful 
not to overcook the item. it should be served as hot as possible as soon as it is removed 
from the broiler or grill.
1 Heat the broiler or grill.
2 Use a wire brush to remove any charred or burnt particles that may be stuck to the broiler 
or grill grate. Wipe the grate with a lightly oiled towel to remove any remaining particles 
and help season it.
3 Prepare the item to be broiled or grilled. For example, cut the fish into steaks or tranches 
of even thickness; split the lobster; peel and/or skewer the shrimp. Season or marinate the 
item as desired. Brush the item with oil or butter.
4 Place the item on a grill, presentation side down. if using a broiler, place the item directly 
on the grate or on a preheated broiler platter. Tender fish are usually broiled presentation 
side up on a broiler platter and are not turned during cooking.
5 if practical, turn the item to produce the attractive crosshatch marks associated with 
grilling that are discussed in Chapter 10, Principles of Cooking. items less than ½ inch 
(1.2 centimeters) thick when cooked on a preheated broiler platter do not have to be turned.
6 Cook the item to the desired doneness and serve immediately.

Baking
The terms baking and roasting are used interchangeably when applied to fish and shell￾fish. One disadvantage of baking fish is that the short baking time does not allow the 
surface of the fish to caramelize. To help address this concern, fish can be browned in 
a sauté pan with a small amount of oil to achieve the added flavor and appearance of a 
browned surface and then finished in an oven.
Selecting Fish and Shellfish to Bake
Fatty fish produce the best baked fish. Fish fillets and steaks are the best market forms to 
bake, as they cook quickly and evenly and are easily portioned. Although lean fish can 
be baked, it tends to become dry and must be basted often.
Seasoning Fish and Shellfish to Bake
The most popular seasonings for baked fish are lemon, butter, salt and pepper. Fish can 
also be marinated before baking for added flavor. But baked fish usually depend on the 
accompanying sauce for much of their flavor.
Shellfish are often stuffed or mixed with other ingredients before baking. For exam￾ple, raw oysters on the half shell can be topped with spinach, watercress and Pernod 
M20_LABE1163_07_SE_C20.indd 543 14/11/23 11:55 AM544 CHAPTER TWENTY
(Oysters Rockefeller, page 570) and baked. Shrimp are often butterflied, stuffed and 
baked; lobsters are split, stuffed and baked. Many food service operations remove clams 
from their shells; mix them with bread crumbs, seasonings or other ingredients; refill the 
shells and bake the mixture.
Accompaniments to Baked Fish and Shellfish
Baked fish is often served with a flavorful sauce such as Creole Sauce (page 253) or 
Beurre Blanc (page 257). Almost any type of rice, pasta or potato is a good accompani￾ment, as is any variety of sautéed vegetable.

Sautéing
Sautéing is a very popular cooking method for fish and shellfish that lightly caramelizes 
the food’s surface, giving it additional flavor. Typically other ingredients such as garlic, 
onions, vegetables, wine and lemon juice are added to the fond to make a sauce.
Selecting Fish and Shellfish to Sauté
Both fatty and lean fish may be sautéed. Flatfish are sometimes dressed and sautéed 
whole, as are small round fish such as trout. To sauté larger fish such as salmon, choose 
steaks, fillets or tranches. The portions should be relatively uniform in size and thickness 
and fairly thin to promote even cooking. Although clams, mussels and oysters are not 
often sautéed, scallops and crustaceans are popular sauté items.
Seasoning Fish and Shellfish to Sauté
Many types of fish—especially sole, flounder and other delicate, lean fish fillets—are 
often dredged in plain or seasoned flour before sautéing. Seasoned butter is used to 
sauté some items, such as scampi-style shrimp. These items derive their flavor from the 
butter; additional seasonings should not be necessary.
Cooking Temperatures for Sautéing
The sauté pan and cooking fat must be hot before the fish or shellfish are added. Do 
not add too much fish or shellfish to the pan at one time, or the pan and fat will cool. 
This will allow the foods to simmer in their own juices and cook the fish before it 
browns. See Figure  20.8. Thin slices and small pieces of fish and shellfish require a 
short cooking time; use high temperatures to caramelize their surfaces without over￾cooking. Slightly lower cooking temperatures may be better for large, thick pieces of 
fish or shellfish being cooked in the shell. This ensures that they are cooked without 
overbrowning their surfaces.
Accompaniments to Sautéed Fish and Shellfish
Sautéed fish and shellfish are nearly always served with a sauce made directly in the 
sauté pan. This sauce may be as simple as browned butter (beurre noisette) or a compli￾cated sauce flavored with the fond. In some cases, seasoned butter is used to sauté the 
fish or shellfish and the butter is then served with the main item. Mildly flavored rice and 
pasta are good choices to serve with sautéed fish or shellfish.
Figure 20.8 A properly sautéed fish fillet (left) is lightly brown and holds its shape 
without sticking to the pan. An improperly sautéed fish fillet (right) is pale, falls 
apart and sticks to the pan.

Procedure for Sautéing Fish and Shellfish
1 Cut or portion the fish or shellfish.
2 Season the fish or shellfish and dredge in seasoned flour if desired.
3 Heat a suitable sauté pan over medium heat; add enough oil or clarified butter to cover the 
bottom to a depth of about ⅛ inch (3 millimeters).
4 Add the fish or shellfish to the pan (fish should be placed presentation side down); cook 
until done, turning once halfway through the cooking process. Add other items as called for 
in the recipe.
5 Remove the fish or shellfish. if a sauce is to be made in the sauté pan, follow the procedures

Pan-Frying
Pan-frying is very similar to sautéing, but more fat is used to cook the main item when 
pan-frying. Pan-fried fish is always coated with flour, batter or breading to help seal 
the surface and prevent the flesh from coming into direct contact with the cooking fat. 
Properly prepared pan-fried fish and shellfish should be moist and tender with a crisp 
surface. If fish is battered or breaded, the coating should be intact with no breaks.
Selecting Fish and Shellfish to Pan-Fry
Both fatty and lean fish may be pan-fried. Trout and other small fish are ideal for 
 pan-frying, as are portioned fillets of lean fish such as halibut. Fish and shellfish for 
 pan-frying should be uniform in size and relatively thin so that they cook quickly 
and evenly.
Seasoning Fish and Shellfish to Pan-Fry
Although fish and shellfish can be marinated or seasoned directly, it is more common 
to season the flour, batter or breading that will coat them. Batters, for example, can 
contain cheese, and breadings can contain nuts and other ingredients to add various 
flavors to the fish or shellfish. Review the battering and breading procedures discussed 
in Chapter 9, Mise en Place. Additional seasonings are provided by sauces and other 
accompaniments served with the pan-fried fish or shellfish.
Cooking Temperatures for Pan-Frying
The fat should always be hot before the fish or shellfish are added. Breaded or battered 
fish fillets cook very quickly, and the fat should be hot enough to brown the coating 
without overcooking the interior. Whole pan-fried fish take longer to cook and therefore 
require a slightly lower cooking temperature so that the surface does not become too 
dark before the interior is cooked.
Accompaniments to Pan-Fried Fish and Shellfish
Lemon wedges are the classic accompaniment to pan-fried fish and shellfish. Sauces 
that accompany pan-fried items are made separately. Mayonnaise-based sauces such as 
Tartar Sauce (page 768) and Rémoulade Sauce (page 770) are especially popular; rich, 
wine-based sauces should be avoided. Vegetable coulis, such as tomato, also comple￾ment many pan-fried items.
Procedure for Pan-Frying Fish and Shellfish
1 Heat enough clarified butter or oil in a heavy sauté pan so that it is one-third to halfway up 
the side of the item. The fat should be between 325°F and 350°F (163°C and 177°C).
2 Add the floured, breaded or battered item to the pan, being careful not to splash the hot 
fat. Cook until done, turning once halfway through the cooking process.
3 Remove the fish or shellfish and drain on absorbent paper.
4 Serve promptly with an appropriate sauce.

Deep-Frying
Deep-frying is the process of cooking foods by submerging them in hot fat. Typically fish 
or shellfish are breaded or battered before deep-frying. Alternatively they can be formed 
into croquettes or fritters. Properly deep-fried fish and shellfish should be moist and ten￾der, not greasy or tough. Their coating should be crispy and golden brown.
Selecting Fish and Shellfish to Deep-Fry
Whole small fish and fillets of lean fish such as catfish or halibut are excellent for 
 deep-frying. The fillets should be of uniform size and relatively thin so that they cook 
quickly and evenly. Fatty fish, such as salmon, are ideal for croquettes. Peeled shrimp 
and shucked mollusks, especially clams and oysters, can be breaded, battered or formed 
into fritters and deep-fried. Deep-fried breaded or battered sliced squid or octopus 
served with a dipping sauce make excellent hors d’oeuvre.
M20_LABE1163_07_SE_C20.indd 548 14/11/23 11:55 AMFiSH ANd SHEllFiSH 549
Seasoning Fish and Shellfish to Deep-Fry
Typically seasonings used for deep-fried fish or shellfish are added to the breading or 
batter. In contrast, salt and pepper should be added after frying. Additional flavors come 
from sauces or accompaniments.
Accompaniments to Deep-Fried Fish and Shellfish
As with pan-fried fish and shellfish, lemon wedges and mayonnaise-based sauces such 
as Tartar Sauce (page 768) and Creole Rémoulade Sauce (page 770) are popular accom￾paniments to deep-fried fish and shellfish. Spicy tomato- or soy-based dipping sauces 
are also excellent choices. Malt vinegar is served with traditional English fish and chips.
Procedure for Deep-Frying Fish and Shellfish
1 Shuck, peel, cut, trim or otherwise prepare the fish or shellfish to be deep-fried. Season, 
bread or batter it as desired.
2 Heat the fat to the desired temperature, usually around 350°F (177°C). Breaded or bat￾tered fish or shellfish cook quickly; the fat must be hot enough to cook the food’s interior 
without burning its surface.
3 Carefully place the food in the hot fat using either the basket method or the swimming 
method as described in Chapter 10, Principles of Cooking.
4 deep-fry the fish or shellfish until done. determine doneness by color, timing or sampling.
5 Remove the deep-fried food from the fat and hold it over the fryer, allowing the excess fat 
to drain off. Transfer the food to a hotel pan either lined with absorbent paper or fitted 
with a rack. Season with salt if desired.
6 if the deep-fried fish or shellfish is to be held for later service, place it under a heat lamp.

MOIST-HEAT COOKING METHODS FOR FISH 
AND SHELLFISH
Fish and shellfish lend themselves well to moist-heat cooking methods, especially steam￾ing and poaching. Steaming best preserves the food’s natural flavors and cooks without 
adding fat. Poaching is also popular, especially for fish. Poached fish can be served hot 
or cold, whole or as steaks, fillets or portions. Some shellfish, such as oysters, shrimp, 
clams, scallops and abalone, are often removed from their shells before cooking, in 
which case they should be handled as you would any delicate seafood. The meat of 
lobster, crab and crawfish is almost impossible to remove from the shell raw, however, 
so they are cooked first, then shelled. Special techniques are used with these crustaceans 
that are not removed from their shells before cooking.
Steaming
As explained in Chapter 10, Principles of Cooking, steaming uses the process of convec￾tion to transfer heat to food from the steam rising off a heated liquid. Fish and shellfish 
are steamed by suspending them over a boiling liquid in a covered pan. The steam 
trapped in the cooking vessel circulates to gently cook the food while preserving natural 
flavors and most nutrients. A bamboo steamer or a rack placed inside a covered pan is 
typically used for steaming. Steaming can also take place in a smaller container, such as 
a paper or leaf wrapper or inside the natural shell of a crustacean or mollusk, using the 
moisture trapped inside the wrapper. This way fish and shellfish can be cooked without 
adding fat.
The liquid used to steam fish and shellfish is usually water or a court bouillon with 
herbs, spices, aromatics or wine added to infuse the item with additional flavors. Mussels 
and clams can be steamed by placing them directly in a covered pan with a small 
amount of wine or other liquid. Their shells hold them above the liquid as they cook. 
Fish can also be steamed by wrapping it in portion-size packets of parchment paper 
together with herbs, vegetables, compound butters or sauces and baking the packets in a 
hot oven. This method of steaming is called en papillote. In many cuisines, banana leaves 
were traditionally used, and are still used today, as natural wrappers in which to steam 
fish and shellfish along with vegetables and seasonings.
Properly steamed fish and shellfish should be moist and tender with clean and deli￾cate flavors. Any accompaniments or sauces should complement the main item without 
masking its flavor. Fish cooked en papillote should be served piping hot so that the aro￾matic steam trapped by the paper escapes as the paper is cut open tableside.
Selecting Fish and Shellfish to Steam
Both fatty fish (e.g., salmon and sea bass) and lean fish (e.g., sole) produce good results 
when steamed. Portions should be of uniform thickness and no more than 1 inch (2.5 
centimeters) thick to promote even cooking. Mollusks (e.g., clams and mussels) and 
some crustaceans (e.g., prawns and shrimp) can be steamed either in their shells or after 
being shucked or peeled.
Seasoning Fish and Shellfish to Steam
The natural flavors of steamed fish and shellfish are highlighted by this cooking method 
and often require very little seasoning. Nevertheless salt, pepper, herbs and spices can 
be applied directly to the raw food before steaming. Clams and mussels, however, often 
do not require additional salt, as the liquid released when they open during cooking is 
sufficiently salty. Flavored liquids used to steam fish and shellfish also contribute addi￾tional flavors. If the steaming liquid is to be served as a broth or used to make a sauce to 
en papillote [awn pa-pee-YOTE] a cooking 
method in which food is wrapped in paper or 
foil and heated so that the food steams in its 
own moisture
M20_LABE1163_07_SE_C20.indd 550 14/11/23 11:55 AMFiSH ANd SHEllFiSH 551
accompany the item, it is especially important that the liquid be well seasoned. Lemons, 
limes, herbs and other aromatics can also be cooked with the fish or shellfish to add 
flavors. A sachet of pickling spice, Cajun seasonings or Old Bay Seasoning is sometimes 
used with shell-on products to add popular flavors.
Accompaniments to Steamed Fish and Shellfish
Steamed fish and shellfish are popular partly because they are low in fat. A low or nonfat 
sauce or a simple squeeze of lemon and steamed fresh vegetables are good accompa￾niments. If fat is not a concern, then an emulsified butter sauce, such as Beurre Blanc 
(page 257) or Hollandaise (page 254), may be a good choice.
Classic New England steamed clams are served with a portion of the steaming liquid; 
steamed mussels are served with a sauce that is created from the wine and other ingre￾dients used to steam them. The standard accompaniments to steamed crustaceans served 
hot in the shell are lemon wedges and clarified (also known as drawn) butter. If they will 
be eaten cold, the traditional sauce is a tangy tomato-based cocktail sauce. Nearly any 
type of vegetable or starch goes well with steamed crustaceans, common choices being 
fresh corn on the cob and boiled potatoes.
Procedure for Steaming Fish or Shellfish
1 Portion the fish to an appropriate size or clean the shellfish.
2 Prepare the cooking liquid. Add seasoning and flavoring ingredients as desired and bring to 
a boil.
3 Place the fish or shellfish in the steamer on a rack or in a perforated pan and cover tightly. 
Crustaceans such as lobster and crab are steamed in the shell by being fully submerged in 
boiling water that is then brought back to a simmer.
4 Steam the fish or shellfish until done.
5 Serve the fish or shellfish immediately with the steaming liquid or an appropriate sauce.
 Procedure for Simmering or Boiling Shellfish
1 Bring water to a boil. Add seasonings as desired. The amount of liquid must be sufficient 
to cover the shellfish completely. Place crabs, lobster, prawns, crayfish or other in-shell 
products directly in the cooking liquid.
2 Cover the pot, bring the liquid back to a boil as quickly as possible. Then immediately 
reduce heat to a simmer.
3 Cook until done. Timing is the best method for determining the doneness of steamed 
shellfish. This varies depending on the size of the shellfish and the water temperature. 
Shrimp cook in as little as 3–5 minutes; crabs cook in 5–10 minutes. A 1-pound 
(450-gram) lobster can cook in 6–8 minutes; a 2½-pound (1.1-kilogram) lobster should 
cook in 15–20 minutes.
4 Remove the shellfish from the liquid and serve immediately, or cool shellfish by dropping 
into ice water if they are to be eaten cold.
Simmer, Don’t Boil
The hard shells of lobsters, clams, crabs, 
crayfish and other shellfish create an 
enclosed chamber in which the delicate 
flesh will steam in its own moisture 
regardless of the external cooking method 
used. Even oysters or crab legs cooked 
on a charcoal grill are actually being 
steamed, while also absorbing flavor 
from the wood smoke. When these 
hard-shelled products are cooked by 
submerging in a simmering liquid, it is 
generally called “boiling” even though 
cooking temperatures should remain 
below the boiling point. do not be 
confused by phrases such as “boiled 
shrimp” or “a crab boil.” As a chef 
you should understand that the actual 
cooking technique is to submerge the 
shellfish in a simmering liquid. The heat 
from an external liquid then causes 
moisture inside the shell to steam the 
flesh. Although they are not as delicate as 
fish or other shellfish, these crustaceans 
will become tough and are easily 
overcooked if the liquid is allowed to 
boil. For smaller items, such as shrimp, 
crawfish and small crabs, seasonings are 
typically added to the water and will cling 
to the cooked item.

 Poaching
Poaching is a versatile and popular method for cooking fish. Shellfish are rarely poached, 
however. The exception is squid, which can be quickly poached and chilled for use in 
salads and other preparations.
There are two distinct poaching methods. The first is the submersion method, 
also referred to as deep poaching, in which the fish is completely covered with a 
liquid, usually a court bouillon, fish stock or fish fumet. It is cooked until just done 
and has an internal temperature of 145°F (63°C). The poached fish is then served 
(either hot or cold) with a sauce sometimes made from a portion of the cooking liq￾uid but more often made separately. Whole fish (wrapped in cheesecloth to preserve 
its shape during cooking), tranches and steaks can all be cooked by submersion 
poaching.
Shallow poaching, the second method, combines poaching and steaming to achieve 
the desired results. The main item, usually a fillet, tranche or steak, is placed on a bed 
of aromatic vegetables in enough liquid to come approximately halfway up its sides. 
The liquid, called a cuisson, is brought to a simmer on the stove top. The pan is then 
covered with a piece of buttered parchment paper or a lid, which creates the envi￾ronment for steaming. Cooking is completed either on the stove top or in the oven. 
 Shallow-poached fish is usually served with a sauce made with the reduced cooking 
liquid. (Sometimes the main item is sautéed lightly before the cooking liquid is added. If 
so, the cooking method is more accurately described as braising, as both dry- and moist￾heat cooking methods are used.)
Selecting Fish to Poach
Lean white fish, such as turbot, bass and sole, are excellent for poaching. Some fatty fish, 
such as salmon and trout, are also excellent choices.
Seasoning Fish to Poach
Fish poached by either submersion or shallow poaching gain all of their seasonings 
from the liquid in which they are cooked and the sauce with which they are served. 
Therefore it is very important to use a properly prepared court bouillon, fish fumet 
or good-quality fish stock well-seasoned with vegetables such as shallots, onions or 
carrots as well as herbs, spices and other seasonings. Citrus, especially lemon, is a 
popular seasoning; lemon juice or zest may be added to the poaching liquid, the 
sauce or the finished dish. Many poached fish recipes call for wine. When using 
wine in either the cooking liquid or the sauce, be sure to choose a high-quality wine. 
Most fish are very delicately flavored, and poor-quality wine may ruin an otherwise 
excellent dish.
Accompaniments to Poached Fish
Poached fish cooked by submersion go well with rich sauces such as Beurre Blanc 
(page 257) or Hollandaise (page 254). Once coated with either sauce, the fish may 
be broiled briefly to lightly brown or glaze before serving. If fat is a concern, a better 
choice may be a vegetable coulis (e.g., broccoli or red pepper). Cold poached fish are 
commonly served with mayonnaise-based sauces such as sauce verte or Rémoulade 
Sauce (page 770). Shallow-poached fish are served with sauces such as a white wine 
sauce made from a reduction of the liquids in which the fish were poached. Poached 
fish are often served with rice or pasta and steamed or boiled vegetables.

➊ Preparing the fumet. ➋ lowering the salmon into the fumet. ➌ Poaching the salmon fillets. 
 Procedure for Submersion Poaching 
1 Prepare the cooking liquid. Whole fish should be started in a cold liquid; gradually 
increasing the liquid’s temperature helps preserve the appearance of the fish. Portioned 
fish should be started in a simmering liquid to preserve their flavor and more accurately 
estimate cooking time. Cover only to bring liquid to the proper temperature but uncover to 
prevent overcooking. 
2 Use a spatula, spider or other hand tool to lower the fish into the cooking liquid. Be sure 
the fish is completely submerged without overcrowding so that it cooks evenly and there is 
room to skim the surface of impurities. 
3 Poach the fish at 175–185°F (79–85°C) until done. Cooking time will depend on the 
thickness of the fillets and the temperature of the poaching liquid. When done, the fillets 
will feel firm when pressed with a finger in the thickest part. 
4 Remove the fish from the poaching liquid, moisten with a portion of the liquid and hold in 
a warm place for service. Or remove the fish from the poaching liquid, cover it to prevent 
drying and allow it to cool, then refrigerate. 
5 Serve the poached fish with an appropriate sauce.

Combination Cooking Methods
Combination cooking methods are used to cook meats, game and poultry in part to 
tenderize them. Because fish and shellfish are inherently tender, they do not necessarily 
benefit from such procedures. As noted in the section on shallow poaching, fish can, 
on occasion, be lightly sautéed or browned and then poached or simmered. Although 
this procedure is a combination cooking method, it is used to enhance flavors and not 
to tenderize the product. Some fish or shellfish recipes include the word braised or stew
in the title. Note, however, that these recipes rarely follow the traditional combination 
cooking methods discussed in this text.
Sous Vide
Fish and shellfish may be packaged under vacuum in plastic pouches and cooked 
sous vide in a temperature-controlled water bath. See Chapter  10, Principles of 
Cooking. This sous vide technique, which resembles poaching, produces soft and 
moist fish and shellfish that is cooked through but not overcooked. For service, sous 
vide fish and shellfish may be seared to produce an attractive browned appearance 
and surface texture.
When cooking fish using this sous vide method, select species with relatively 
firm flesh. The sous vide cooking temperatures and times are much shorter for fish 
than for tough cuts of meat or poultry. Shellfish such as clams, shrimp or lobster 
cook more quickly than fin fish and may benefit from the addition of oil in the 
cooking pouch.
Procedure for Preparing Fish and Shellfish Sous Vide
1 Assemble the safety equipment—single-use gloves, digital probe thermometer with 
pointed tip, ice and water bath with salt and sanitizing solution—for preparing 
food sous vide.
2 Wearing clean single-use gloves, place the fish and seasonings in a single layer into plastic 
pouches.
3 Vacuum-seal the pouches of food in a chamber vacuum machine.
4 Place sealed pouches in a preheated thermal bath with a circulator. Cook until fish reaches 
the desired internal temperature.
5 Unless the fish is being served immediately, use an ice bath to quickly chill pouches below 
the temperature danger zone.
6 For service, open sous vide pouches and drain the fish on paper towels. Sear the fish in a pre￾heated pan until crisp. Serve with the appropriate garnishes.

Vacuum seal the pouches. Once sealed, the portioned fish can be held in the refrigerator for up to 
48 hours before serving.
3 For service, sous vide the fish in a thermal circulator heated to 122°F (50°C) until the core tempera￾ture of the fish reaches 122°F (50°C) when checked with a digital probe thermometer, approxi￾mately 30 minutes. (Reseal bags before returning to the circulator if necessary.) The fish may be 
held for up to 1 hour in the thermal circulator until ready to serve.
4 Remove each portion of fish from the bags. drain fish on clean paper towels.
5 Heat a medium size sauté pan over medium-high heat. Add the olive oil then place the fish, pre￾sentation side down, in the pan, leaving some space between fillets so that they will cook properly. 
Cook the fish undisturbed until lightly browned and crisp, approximately 1 minute.
6 Remove the fish from the pan. drain any excess oil from the fish on a paper towel. Serve each por￾tion of fish on 3 ounces (90 grams) of Red Rice Pilaf accompanied by Citrus Beurre Blanc, orange

SERVING RAW FISH AND SHELLFISH
For centuries, people have consumed uncooked fresh fish and shellfish. The coastal cui￾sines of Japan, Sicily and South America include numerous raw fish dishes, for example. 
And clams and shellfish served raw on the half shell figure prominently in the classi￾cal culinary traditions in Europe and the United States. Now that chefs worldwide are 
exploring lighter preparations and the cuisines of Asia, serving raw fish and shellfish 
is common. Raw fish requires time and temperature control for safety (TCS). Check 
local health department regulations for recommendations on properly serving raw fish. 
Sourcing the freshest products from licensed suppliers is essential. The products must be 
kept very cold from the moment they arrive until the moment they are prepared. Wear 
clean disposable gloves and observe stringent sanitary conditions when handling raw 
fish and shellfish.

 Safety Alert
Sous Vide Sanitation
Food safety is of utmost concern when 
using sous vide techniques because of the 
low cooking temperatures. To prevent the 
growth of microorganisms, any food to 
be cooked sous vide must be chilled below 
the temperature danger zone (41°F/5°C) 
before cooking. Keep all cutting boards, 
knives and food contact surfaces clean 
and sanitary and wear clean disposable 
gloves. Use only the freshest unblemished 
ingredients. Consult your local health 
department for regulations for preparing 
food sous vide. Special permission and a 
HACCP plan may be required.

Raw Fish and Shellfish Dishes
Raw fish and shellfish dishes are about texture as much as flavor. Citrus, especially 
lemon and lime, fresh delicate herbs and oils are popular additions to raw fish dishes. 
Raw fish dishes often include crisp accompaniments such as raw vegetables for textural 
contrast. The recipes for Fin Fish Carpaccio with Lemon Thyme Vinaigrette (page 581), 
Seviche (page 918), Tuna Poke (page 581) and Tuna Tartar (page 918) are examples of 
raw fish preparations.
Sushi and Sashimi
Generally sushi refers to cooked or raw fish and shellfish rolled in or served on 
seasoned rice. Sashimi is raw fish eaten without rice. In Japan, the word sushi (or 
zushi) refers only to the flavored rice. Each combination of rice and another ingre￾dient or ingredients has a specific name. These include nigiri zushi (rice with raw 
fish), norimaki zushi (rice rolled in seaweed), fukusa zushi (rice wrapped in omelet), 
inari zushi (rice in fried bean curd) and chirashi zushi (rice with fish, shellfish and 
vegetables). Although a Japanese sushi master spends years perfecting style and tech￾nique, many types of sushi can be produced in any professional kitchen with very 
little specialized equipment.
Fish for Sushi and Sashimi
The key to good sushi and sashimi is the freshness and high quality of the fish. Purchase 
from a reputable fish vendor that knows how to properly handle, process and freeze fish 
as required to maintain food safety. A wide range of fish are used to prepare sushi and 
sashimi. Among them are saltwater varieties including ahi and yellowfin tuna, salmon, 
flounder and sea bass. Freshwater varieties are uncommon because they may contain 
parasites that make them unsuitable for raw consumption. For this reason, eel is cooked 
before using to make sushi. Because raw octopus and shrimp can be somewhat tough, 
they are also cooked before using.
Rice for Sushi
Sushi rice is prepared by adding seasonings such as vinegar, sugar, salt and rice wine 
(sake or mirin) to steamed short-grain white rice. The consistency of the rice is very 
important. It must be sticky enough to stay together when formed into finger-shaped 
oblongs, but not too soft.
Accompaniments to Sushi and Sashimi
Accompaniments to sushi and sashimi include the following:
Shoyu: Japanese soy sauce, which is lighter and more delicate than the 
Chinese variety.
Wasabi: A strong aromatic root, purchased as a green powder. It is sometimes 
called green horseradish, although it is not actually related to common horseradish.
Pickled ginger: Fresh ginger pickled in vinegar, which gives it a pink color.
Nori: A dried seaweed purchased in sheets; nori adds flavor and is sometimes used 
to contain rolled rice and other ingredients.
The procedure for making sushi and sashimi is illustrated by the recipe for Nigiri Sushi.
mirin a Japanese rice wine; low in alcohol and 
naturally sweet, mirin is used as a condiment
 Safety Alert
Raw Fish
Raw fish requires time and temperature 
control for safety (TCS). Many health 
departments enforce strict regulations to 
ensure that raw fish, shellfish and sashimi 
are properly prepared and served. Many 
species of fin fish carry parasites that are 
harmless to the fish but can cause illness 
in humans. To destroy these parasites, 
such fish should be frozen before service 
according to procedures outlined in the 
2022 Food Code of the U.S. Food and 
drug Administration (FdA). in the United 
States, most “sushi grade” fish will have 
been frozen for at least 15 hours at –31°F 
(–35°C). Observe the strictest sanitation 
standards when preparing raw fish dishes 
to prevent cross-contamination. Check 
local regulations for the most accurate 
information for your area.

Paella
Paella [pah-AY-lyah] is one of the classic dishes of Spain. The word paella refers to both a shallow, 
black steel pan and the dish made in it; paella is a combination of poultry, meats, shellfish, game, 
chorizo, vegetables and short-grain rice with saffron. Traditionally this dish is cooked over an open 
wood fire. The most well-known paella is from Valencia and consists of a colorful mixture of shellfish, 
poultry and saffron rice.

1 To make the terrine, line a 6⅜ × 10⅞ × 2½-inch (16 × 27 × 6-centimeter) quarter-size hotel pan 
with plastic wrap. Cut a cardboard cake board or a piece of heavy plastic to make a template the 
same size as the interior of the hotel pan.
2 Trim the salmon fillet of any skin, bone, imperfections or blemishes. Cut the fillet in half, then trim 
each piece the same length as the quarter-size hotel pan. (Reserve trim for other uses.)
3 Trim two pieces of the salmon to fit into the bottom of the hotel pan. lay one piece of salmon in 
the bottom of the pan. Evenly sprinkle some of the transglutaminase, if using, over the edge of the 
fish. Place another piece of the salmon with its thinnest edge overlapping the salmon in the pan. 
Evenly sprinkle the seam where the pieces of salmon overlap with more transglutaminase. Season 
to taste with salt and pepper.
4 Cover the salmon with four sheets of the nori. lay out the slices of smoked salmon overlapping in 
one even layer to cover the nori. Cover the smoked salmon with another layer of nori. Then cover 
the nori with the remaining pieces of salmon fillet.
5 Evenly sprinkle the seam where the pieces of salmon overlap with the remaining transglutaminase. 
Season to taste.
6 Fold the plastic wrap over the salmon. Place the template on top of the terrine. Slide the pan into a 
large vacuum bag. Vacuum-seal on high to help the terrine keep its shape. Once sealed, the terrine 
can be held in the refrigerator for up to 36 hours before preparing for service.
7 Remove the terrine from the bag and unmold it onto a cutting board. Slice it lengthwise into two 
3 × 10-inch (7.5 × 22-centimeter) strips. Cut each strip into five uniform portions.
8 For each portion, add 1 tablespoon (15 milliliters) of the olive oil to a vacuum bag. Slide a portion 
of salmon into each bag. Vacuum-seal. Once sealed, the portioned salmon can be held in the refrig￾erator for up to 48 hours before serving.
9 For service, cook the salmon in a thermal circulator heated to 122.5°F (50°C) until the core tem￾perature of the fish reaches 122.5°F (50°C) when checked with a digital probe thermometer, 
approximately 12 minutes. (Reseal the bag before returning it to the circulator if necessary.) The 
salmon may be held in the thermal circulator until ready to serve.
10 Whip the Pernod into the Beurre Blanc. Keep warm.
11 Remove the portions of salmon from the bags. drain on clean paper towels.
12 Heat the remaining olive oil in a sauté pan over high heat. Sear the salmon, presentation side down,

fish remains hot, each portion is seared on one side 
immediately before plating.
 Safety Alert
Sous Vide Sanitation
Food safety is of utmost concern when 
using sous vide techniques because of the 
low cooking temperatures. To prevent the 
growth of microorganisms, any food to be 
cooked sous vide must be chilled below 
the temperature danger zone (41°F/5°C) 
before cooking. Keep all cutting boards, 
knives and food contact surfaces clean 
and sanitary and wear clean disposable 
gloves. Use only the freshest unblemished 
ingredients. Consult your local health 
department for regulations for preparing 
food sous vide. Special permission and a 
HACCP plan may be required.

 Safety Alert 
 Raw Fish 
 Raw fish requires time and temperature 
control for safety (TCS). Many health 
departments enforce strict regulations to 
ensure that raw fish, shellfish and sashimi 
are properly prepared and served. Many 
species of fin fish carry parasites that are 
harmless to the fish but can cause illness 
in humans. To destroy these parasites, 
such fish should be frozen before service 
according to procedures outlined in the 
2022 Food Code of the U.S. Food and 
drug Administration (FdA). in the United 
States, most “sushi grade” fish will have 
been frozen for at least 15 hours at –31°F 
(–35°C). Observe the strictest sanitation 
standards when preparing raw fish dishes 
to prevent cross-contamination. Check 
local regulations for the most accurate 
information for your area.

 Eggs, particularly chicken eggs, are an excellent food for humans because of their high 
protein content, low cost and ready availability. They are extremely versatile and are 
used throughout the kitchen, either served alone or as ingredients in a prepared dish. 
Cooked eggs and egg dishes are often associated with breakfast and brunch. In addition to 
eggs, food service operations must offer a variety of other breakfast options to appeal to a 
wide range of consumers. 
 Breakfast cookery is often one of the first line positions a new cook will be offered. This 
important duty requires speed, timing and precision and can help an apprentice or begin￾ning cook develop organized, efficient work habits. 
 This chapter discusses cooking methods for eggs as well as breakfast meats, griddlecakes, 
crêpes, cereals and the beverages coffee and tea. Other foods typically served at breakfast, 
such as quick breads, fruit, fruit beverages and cheese, are discussed elsewhere in this text.
 COMPOSITION OF EGGS 
 Eggs provide texture, flavor, structure, moisture and nutrition to a variety of foods, from 
soups and sauces to breads and pastries. Eggs leaven and thicken bakery items and bind 
ingredients such as crumbs on breaded foods or ingredients in a dough or sauce. Eggs 
enrich and tenderize breads and extend the shelf life of some baked goods. 
 Chicken eggs are most common, but quail, duck, goose and other poultry eggs are 
also suitable for culinary use. Unless otherwise stated, all of the recipes in this text use 
large chicken eggs, and information is based on chicken eggs only. 
 The primary parts of an egg are the shell, yolk and albumen. (See Figure  21. 1 .) The 
shell , composed of calcium carbonate, is the outermost covering of the egg. It prevents 
microbes from entering and moisture from escaping and also protects the egg during 
handling and transport. The breed of the hen determines shell color; for chickens, it can 
range from bright white to brown. Shell color has no effect on quality, flavor or nutrition. 
 The yolk is the yellow portion of the egg. It constitutes just over one-third of the 
egg and contains three-fourths of the calories, most of the minerals and vitamins 
and all the fat. The yolk also contains lecithin, the compound responsible for emul￾sification in products such as hollandaise sauce and mayonnaise. Egg yolk solidifies

(coagulates) at temperatures between 149°F and 158°F (65°C and 70°C). Although the 
color of a yolk may vary depending on the hen’s feed, color does not affect quality 
or nutritional content. 
 The albumen , often referred to as the egg white , is the clear portion of the egg. It 
constitutes about two-thirds of the egg and contains more than half of the protein and 
riboflavin. Egg white coagulates, becoming firm and opaque, at temperatures between 
144°F and 149°F (62°C and 65°C). 
 An often-misunderstood portion of the egg are the two chalazae cords . These thick, 
twisted strands of egg white called chalaza , anchor the yolk in place. They are neither 
imperfections nor embryos. The more prominent the chalazae cords, the fresher the egg. 
Chalazae cords do not interfere with cooking or with whipping egg whites. 
 Eggs are sold in Jumbo, Extra Large, Large, Medium, Small and Peewee sizes, as deter￾mined by weight per dozen. (See Figure  21. 2 .) Food service operations generally use 
Large eggs, which weigh 24 ounces per dozen. Other sizes are based on plus or minus 3 
ounces per dozen; Medium eggs weigh 21 ounces per dozen, whereas Extra Large eggs 
weigh 27 ounces per dozen. 
 Eggs are graded by the USDA or a state agency following USDA guidelines. The grade 
AA, A or B is given to an egg based on interior and exterior quality, not size. Table  21. 1 
describes the qualities for each grade. Grade has no effect on nutritional values. 
 PURCHASING AND STORING EGGS 
 Improper handling quickly diminishes egg quality. Eggs should be stored at temperatures 
below 45°F (7°C) and at a relative humidity of 70–80 percent. Eggs age more during 1 day 
at room temperature than they do during 1 week under proper refrigeration. As eggs age, 
the white becomes thinner and the yolk becomes flatter. This changes the appearance

of poached or fried eggs, making it important to use very fresh eggs for these cooking 
techniques. Older eggs, however, should be used for hard-cooking, as their shells will be 
easier to remove.
Cartons of fresh, uncooked eggs will keep for at least 4–5 weeks beyond the pack 
date if kept refrigerated at 36°F (2°C). Hard-cooked eggs left in their shells and refriger￾ated should be used within 1 week.
Store eggs away from strongly flavored foods to reduce odor absorption. Rotate egg 
stock to maintain freshness. Do not use dirty, cracked or broken eggs, as they may con￾tain bacteria or other contaminants. Frozen eggs should be thawed in the refrigerator 
and used only in dishes that will be thoroughly cooked, such as baked products.
Eggs require time and temperature control for safety (TCS). Rich in protein, eggs are 
an excellent breeding ground for bacteria. Salmonella is of particular concern with eggs 
and egg products because the bacteria are commonly found in a chicken’s intestinal 
tract. Although egg shells are cleaned at packinghouses, some bacteria may remain. 
Therefore, to prevent contamination, it is best to avoid mixing a shell with the liquid egg.
Inadequately cooking or improperly storing dishes containing eggs may lead to 
 food-borne illnesses. Hold egg dishes below 41°F (5°C) or above 135°F (57°C). Never 
leave an egg dish at room temperature for more than 1 hour, including preparation and 
service time. Never reuse a container after it has held raw eggs without thoroughly clean￾ing and sanitizing it.
Pasteurized eggs are required to safely prepare mayonnaise, mousse or other dishes 
that will not be cooked. USDA guidelines state that pasteurization is achieved and 
harmful bacteria such as Salmonella enteritidis are destroyed when the whole egg stays 
at a temperature of 140°F (60°C) for 3½ minutes. By law, all egg products (defined as 
eggs removed from the shell for further processing) must be pasteurized before sale. To 
pasteurize fresh raw eggs in their shells, place fresh room temperature eggs in a sauce￾pan. Cover them with cool water and heat the water to 140°F (60°C). Maintain the water 
at this temperature, monitoring it with an instant read thermometer for 3–5 minutes. 
Immediately chill the eggs in an ice and water bath. Then the eggs can be refrigerated 
for up to four days before use.
Pasteurized eggs with their shells on are also available for purchase. While these 
cost more than unpasteurized eggs, the convenience of using eggs without risking sal￾monella may outweigh the increased cost for some operations. Pasteurized eggs are a 
good option for environments where sanitation is a particular concern, such as schools 
or hospitals.
Egg Products
Food service operations often want the convenience of buying eggs out of the shell in 
the exact form needed: whole eggs, yolks only or whites only. These processed items are 
called egg products and are subject to strict pasteurization standards and USDA inspec￾tions. Egg products are available refrigerated, frozen or dried. Frozen egg products are 
useful when making batters for French toast, omelets or scrambled eggs as well as in 
baking. Dried egg products are often used in baking but are not recommended for 
breakfast cookery.
Concerns about the cholesterol content of eggs have increased the popularity of egg 
substitutes. There are two general types of substitutes. The first is a complete substi￾tute made from soy or milk proteins. The second contains real albumen, but the egg 
yolk has been replaced with vegetable or milk products. Check the ingredient label; 
unless lecithin is added, an egg substitute cannot be used for emulsifying or thickening. 
Powdered egg substitutes are useful in baked goods but will not work for scrambled 
eggs. Generally the higher the ratio of eggs in a recipe or formula, the less likely that any 
egg substitute will be acceptable. The flavor of egg substitutes differs from real eggs, but 
they are useful for people on a restricted diet.
For vegans or anyone with an egg allergy, egg replacements, such as applesauce, 
chia or flaxseeds, bananas or silken tofu, are the best option as they do not contain any 
egg product but can be used for texture or thickening in many dishes.

 Safety Alert
Eggs
Never leave a dish containing eggs at 
room temperature for more than 1 hour, 
including preparation and service time. 
Never reuse a container after it has held 
raw eggs without thoroughly cleaning and 
sanitizing it.
Roaming Poultry
Free range refers to chickens that are 
allowed to roam freely in the farmyard 
as opposed to living in cages. Free-range 
eggs are produced from such chickens. 
The USDA requires that producers 
demonstrate that the chickens have 
access to the outdoors, but the amount 
and quality of that access is not defined. 
Some producers may add the term 
cage-free, which indicates that the birds 
were not confined to cages but were kept 
indoors, usually in large barns. Although 
this term is regulated (companies must 
apply to the Food Safety and Inspection 
Service of the USDA for permission to use 
this term), egg laying operations are not 
actually inspected.

NUTRITIONAL INFORMATION FOR EGGS
Eggs contain vitamins A, D, E and K and the B-complex vitamins. They are rich in miner￾als and contain all essential amino acids. One large egg supplies 6 grams of protein and 
70 calories. Egg yolks do contain cholesterol, but current research shows no evidence 
of a link between consuming eggs and the risk of heart disease or stroke. In fact, the 
American Heart Association now includes eggs as part of a healthy, well-balanced diet. 
Egg whites do not contain cholesterol and are often added to egg dishes such as omelets 
to reduce total calories and fat content.
WHIPPED EGG WHITES
Egg whites are often whipped into a foam that is then incorporated into cakes, custards, 
soufflés, pancakes and other products. The air beaten into the egg foam gives products 
lightness and assists with leavening. For the best volume, allow egg whites to come to 
room temperature before whipping and make sure that no trace of egg yolk (or any 
other fat) is present. Adding an acid ingredient, such as cream of tartar or lemon juice, 
helps stabilize the egg foam. For every 8 ounces (240 milliliters) of egg whites from shell 
eggs, add 1 teaspoon (5 milliliters) cream of tartar or lemon juice. (If using pasteurized 
fresh egg whites, reduce the amount of cream of tartar or lemon juice by half.) Add the 
acid when the egg whites begin to foam. The proper addition of sugar also acts as a 
foam stabilizer, but sugar is not used in savory dishes. Add salt, which disrupts the egg 
whites’ ability to foam, only after the egg whites have begun to foam.
Procedure for Whipping Egg Whites
1 Use fresh egg whites that are completely free of egg yolk and other impurities. Warm the 
egg whites to room temperature before whipping; this helps to form a better foam.
2 Use a clean bowl and whisk. Even a tiny amount of fat can prevent the egg whites from 
foaming properly.
3 Whip the whites until very foamy, then add cream of tartar, lemon juice or other acid 
as directed.
4 Continue whipping until soft peaks form, then gradually add granulated sugar and/or salt 
as directed.
5 Whip until stiff peaks form. Properly whipped egg whites should be moist and shiny; over 
whipped egg whites appear dry and spongy or curdled.
6 Use the whipped egg whites immediately. If liquid begins to separate from the whipped egg 
whites, discard them; they cannot be rewhipped successfully.
COOKING METHODS FOR EGGS
Eggs can be cooked by almost any method and served with a wide array of seasonings, 
accompaniments and garnishes. Whatever cooking method is selected, be sure to pre￾pare the eggs carefully: Overcooked eggs and those cooked at too high a temperature 
will be tough and rubbery. Undercooked eggs may transmit pathogenic bacteria and 
pose a risk of food-borne illness.
The cooking methods discussed in this chapter are those most used for eggs and 
 egg-based dishes. They include dry-heat cooking methods (baking, sautéing and pan￾frying) and moist-heat cooking methods (in-shell cooking and poaching). Regardless of 
the cooking method used, always crack eggs into a small ramekin or cup. If a piece of 
shell falls into the egg, it can easily be removed. If the yolk breaks, the egg can be set 
aside for some other use.
➊ Egg whites whipped to soft peaks.
➋ Egg whites whipped to stiff peaks.
➌ Spongy, over whipped egg whites.
M21_LABE1163_07_SE_C21.indd 587 03/11/23 5:52 PM588 CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE
DRY-HEAT COOKING METHODS FOR EGGS
As with other protein foods, dry-heat cooking methods are used to apply heat to eggs by 
surrounding them with hot air (oven) or hot fat (sautéing and pan-frying). Some foods 
that are prepared using eggs for binding ingredients or breading may be deep-fried, 
but eggs themselves are not cooked by deep-frying. Because egg proteins coagulate at 
relatively low temperatures, dry-heat cooking methods are usually completed quickly to 
avoid overcooking or making eggs rubbery.
Baking
Eggs are baked together with other ingredients in egg-based dishes, such as shirred 
eggs and quiche. Eggs are also essential to baked items, such as soufflés and custards. 
The procedure for making these types of baked egg dishes is described in Chapter 35, 
Custards, Creams, Frozen Desserts and Dessert Sauces. A recipe for a Cheese Soufflé suit￾able for breakfast or brunch appears on page 614.
Shirred Eggs
Baked eggs, also referred to as shirred eggs, are normally prepared in individual rame￾kins or baking dishes. The ramekins can be lined or partially filled with ingredients such 
as bread, ham, creamed spinach or artichokes. The eggs are often topped with grated 
cheese, fresh herbs or a sauce. When properly cooked, the egg whites of baked eggs 
should be set while the yolks are soft and creamy.

Quiche
Quiche is a classic breakfast and brunch entrée. It consists of an egg custard (eggs, 
cream or milk and seasonings) and fillings baked in a crust. The filling usually includes 
at least one type of cheese and can also include any number of other ingredients, such as

cooked, diced meats or blanched vegetables. The flavor and texture of these ingredients 
should complement one another without overpowering the delicate egg custard. Quiche 
is a good way of using leftovers, but ingredients must still be fresh and of good quality. 
A recipe for quiche dough is given on page 1030.
Procedure for Preparing Quiche
1 Prepare and bake a pie shell.
2 Prepare the garnishes and flavoring ingredients and add them to the pie shell.
3 Prepare a custard and add it to the pie shell. Ratios of eggs to milk or heavy cream vary 
depending on the specific recipe, but 6 to 8 eggs to 1 quart (1 liter) of liquid is usually 
sufficient to bind the custard.
4 Bake the quiche until set and it reaches 160°F (71°C) on an instant-read thermometer; 
allow it to cool slightly before cutting.

Sautéing
Eggs may be sautéed in a small amount of fat in a slope-sided sauté pan or on a flat 
top griddle (as explained on page 594). Sautéing is also the basic cooking method used 
when making omelets and frittatas. Egg proteins coagulate at relatively low tempera￾tures, so care must be used to avoid overcooking or making the eggs rubbery.
Scrambled Eggs
Scrambled eggs are lightly beaten to break up the egg yolk, whisked with seasonings and 
then sautéed. They are stirred nearly constantly during cooking. The finished eggs should 
be light and fluffy with a tender, creamy texture. A small amount of milk or cream may be 
added to the eggs before cooking to provide a more delicate finished product. Overcooking 
or cooking at too high a temperature causes the eggs to become tough and rubbery.
Scrambled eggs are often flavored by sautéing other foods (e.g., onions, mushrooms 
or diced ham) in the pan before adding the eggs or by adding other foods (e.g., grated 
cheeses or herbs) to the eggs just before cooking is complete.
Scrambled eggs can also be prepared using only egg whites. Because all of an egg’s 
fat is stored in the yolk, scrambled egg white dishes are lower in fat, cholesterol and 
calories. Water or nonfat milk can be used in place of whole milk or cream to further 
reduce the fat and calorie content of the finished dish. Remember that egg whites

The Versatile Egg
For versatility, the egg has few rivals. 
Poached eggs work in breakfast and 
brunch dishes but also complement tender 
green salads. When stuffed, hard-boiled 
eggs become simple hors d’oeuvre. Finely 
chopped and bound with mayonnaise, 
hard-boiled eggs fill sandwiches and 
canapés. An omelet, frittata, quiche 
or scrambled egg can be flavored and 
enhanced with countless additions, 
including finely diced bell peppers, onions, 
mushrooms, zucchini or tomatoes; cottage 
cheese, creamy goat cheese or any variety 
of shredded firm cheese; crumbled bacon 
or pancetta; diced ham, turkey or beef; 
bits of smoked salmon, cooked shrimp or 
cooked sausage and fresh herbs.

coagulate at a lower temperature than yolks, so adjust the cooking time and tempera￾ture accordingly.
Procedure for Preparing Scrambled Eggs
1 Break the eggs into a mixing bowl. Season lightly with salt and pepper. Add 1 scant 
tablespoon (12 milliliters) milk or cream per egg and whisk everything together.
2 Heat a sauté pan, add clarified butter or oil and heat until the fat begins to sizzle.
3 Sauté any additional ingredients in the hot fat.
4 Pour the eggs into the pan all at once. As the eggs begin to set, slowly stir the mixture with a 
spatula. Lift cooked portions to allow uncooked egg to flow underneath.

Omelets
Omelets are usually prepared as individual servings using two or three whole eggs. 
They begin as scrambled eggs and are either folded around or filled with a warm savory 
mixture. The filling may contain vegetables, cheeses and/or meats. Any filling ingredi￾ent that needs cooking should be cooked before being added to the omelet. A shallow, 
 well-seasoned or nonstick pan with gently sloping sides is used for cooking omelets. 
Should an omelet stick to the pan, run a spatula under the omelet to loosen it.

To reduce fat, omelets can also be made using egg whites only. Use three egg 
whites per serving. Before cooking, whisk the egg whites until foamy. This helps to 
reduce their tendency to toughen during cooking. To prevent egg whites from stick￾ing, use a well-seasoned pan. To enhance the bland flavor of the egg whites, season 
the omelet with minced fresh herbs, such as chives or parsley, or aged cheese, such 
as Parmesan.
French-style omelets are similar to the omelets in the procedure for folded omelets, 
but the eggs are cooked while constantly shaking the pan to keep them light and fluffy. 
French omelets are tightly rolled onto a plate for service. For an elegant presentation, the 
filling may be added after cooking. A cut is made into the finished omelet and the filling 
is spooned in.

Frittatas
Frittatas are essentially open-faced omelets of Spanish-Italian heritage. They may be 
cooked in small pans as individual portions or in large pans, then cut into wedges for 
service. A relatively large amount of hearty ingredients is mixed directly into the eggs. 
The frittata is first cooked on the stove top, then the pan is transferred to an oven or 
placed under a salamander or broiler to finish cooking.

Pan-Frying
Pan-fried eggs are commonly referred to as sunny side up or over easy, over medium 
or over hard. These are visibly different products produced with proper timing and tech￾nique. Very fresh eggs are best for pan-frying, as the yolk holds its shape better and the 
white spreads less.
Sunny-side-up eggs are not turned during cooking; their yellow yolks remain vis￾ible. They should be cooked over medium-low heat long enough to firm the whites and 
partially firm the yolks: approximately 4 minutes if cooked on a 250°F (120°C) cooking 
surface. The edges should not be brown or crisp.
Sunny-side-up eggs
M21_LABE1163_07_SE_C21.indd 593 03/11/23 5:53 PM594 CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE
For “over” eggs, the egg is partially cooked on one side, then gently flipped and 
cooked on the other side until done. The egg white should be firm, and its edges should 
not be brown. The yolk should never be broken regardless of the degree of doneness. 
Not only is a broken yolk unattractive, but the spilled yolk will coagulate on contact with 
the hot pan, making it difficult to serve.
For over-easy eggs, the yolk should remain very runny; on a 250°F (120°C) cooking 
surface, the egg should cook for about 3 minutes on the first side and 2 minutes on the 
other. Over-medium eggs should be cooked slightly longer, until the yolk is partially 
set. For over-hard eggs, the yolk should be completely cooked.
Procedure for Pan-Frying Eggs
1 Select a sauté pan just large enough to accommodate the number of eggs being cooked. 
(An 8-inch[20-centimeter] pan is appropriate for up to three eggs.)
2 Add a small amount of clarified butter and heat until the fat just begins to sizzle.
3 Carefully break the eggs into a bowl. Use the bowl to carefully slide the eggs into the pan.
4 Cook over medium-low heat until the eggs reach the appropriate degree of firmness. Sunny-side￾up eggs are not flipped during cooking; “over” eggs are flipped once during cooking.
5 When done, gently flip the “over” eggs once again so that the first side is up. Lift the pan by 
its handle so that the eggs slide to the opposite side. Using a swift forward motion, gently 
flip the eggs up and over. Then gently slide the cooked eggs out of the pan onto the serving 
plate. Serve immediately.
 Safety Alert
Cooking Eggs
Because of the risk of food-borne 
illnesses, especially salmonella, 
from undercooked eggs, the USDA 
recommends cooking shell eggs for 
immediate service to a minimum internal 
temperature of 145°F (63°C) for 
15 seconds. Fried or poached eggs should 
be cooked until the whites are firm and 
the yolks begin to thicken. Cook eggs that 
will be held for later service to a minimum 
internal temperature of 155°F (68°C) for 
17 seconds.
➊ Sliding the eggs from a bowl into the 
sauté pan.
➋ Flipping the eggs. ➌ Sliding the over eggs onto a plate 
for service.
Frying eggs on a griddle.
Basted eggs are a variation of sunny-side-up eggs. Basted eggs are cooked over low 
heat with the hot butter from the pan spooned over them as they cook. Another version 
of basted eggs is made by adding 1–2 teaspoons (5–10 milliliters) water to the sauté pan 
and then covering the pan. The steam cooks the top of the eggs.
Griddling
Griddling resembles pan-frying or sautéing without the confinement of a pan. Instead, 
food is cooked directly on the heated surface of a flat top griddle. The heating elements 
in a griddle are usually set with warmer and cooler zones to allow various foods to be 
cooked or held warm at the same time. Meats such as bacon, sausage and hamburgers, 
breads such as pancakes and buns and vegetables are frequently prepared on a flat top 
griddle in quick service restaurants. Scrambled and fried eggs can also be cooked on a 
griddle, making the griddle an extremely versatile piece of kitchen equipment
When cooking fried eggs on a flat top, the griddle should be heated to 250°F (120°C) and 
the procedures for turning eggs at the correct time, as described above, should be followed.

MOIST-HEAT COOKING METHODS FOR EGGS
Moist-heat cooking methods are used to apply heat to food by submerging it directly into 
a hot liquid. When cooking eggs, the liquid is water because you are not using the cook￾ing liquid to flavor the eggs. In-shell eggs are cooked by simmering; unshelled eggs are 
cooked by poaching. In both methods, it is essential that the water not be too hot and 
that the eggs not be overcooked.
In-Shell Cooking (Simmering)
The difference between soft-cooked eggs (also called soft-boiled) and hard-cooked 
eggs (also called hard-boiled) is time. Both styles refer to eggs cooked in their shells 
in hot water. Despite the word boiled in their names, an egg cooked in the shell should 
never be boiled. Boiling toughens eggs and causes a green discoloration, which results 
from sulfur in the whites reacting with iron in the yolks. (See Figure 21.3.)
Instead of boiling, the eggs should be simmered. Soft-cooked eggs are usually sim￾mered for 4–6 minutes; hard-cooked eggs may be simmered for as long as 12–15 minutes. 
In either case, running the eggs under water immediately after simmering helps stop car￾ryover cooking.
Sometimes it is difficult to remove the shell from very fresh eggs. Eggs that are a few 
days old are better for cooking in the shell.
Procedure for Preparing Soft-Cooked Eggs
1 Fill a saucepan or stockpot with sufficient water to cover the eggs. Bring the water to a 
simmer.
2 gently stir the water in a circular motion. Carefully lower each egg into the simmering 
water. Simmer uncovered for 3–5 minutes, depending on the firmness desired.
3 Lift each egg out of the water with a slotted spoon or spider. Crack the large end of the 
shell carefully and serve immediately.
Figure 21.3 Properly hard-boiled eggs 
(top) are uniformly cooked through 
and gold colored. A green discolor￾ation covers the yolk when in-shell 
eggs are overcooked (bottom).
Procedure for Preparing Hard-Cooked Eggs
1 Repeat Steps 1 and 2 for soft-cooked eggs but simmer the eggs for 12–15 minutes.
2 Lift each egg out of the water with a slotted spoon or spider and place in an ice bath. When 
the eggs are cool enough to handle, peel them and use as desired or cover and refrigerate 
for up to 5 days.
Poaching
Eggs that are to be poached should always be very fresh. They should also be kept 
very cold until used, as a cold egg white will hold its shape better when dropped into 
hot water. The water for poaching eggs is held at a gentle simmer, approximately 200°F 
(90°C). Properly poached eggs are soft and moist; the whites should be firm enough to 
encase the yolk completely, but the yolk should still be runny.
Some chefs add salt to the poaching water for flavor; others believe that the salt 
causes the egg whites to separate. To help the egg whites cling together, add 2 table￾spoons (30 milliliters) white vinegar per quart (liter) of water.
M21_LABE1163_07_SE_C21.indd 595 03/11/23 5:53 PM596 CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE
1 Fill a saucepan or stockpot with at least 3 inches (7.5 centimeters) water. Add salt and vinegar if 
desired. Bring the water to a simmer and hold at a temperature of approximately 200°F (90°C).
2 One at a time, crack the eggs into a small ramekin or cup. If a piece of shell falls into the 
egg, it should be removed; if the yolk breaks, set aside the egg for some other use.
3 gently slide each egg into the simmering water and cook for 3–5 minutes.
4 Lift the poached egg out of the water with a slotted spoon. Trim any ragged edges with a 
paring knife. Serve immediately.
For quantity service, eggs can be poached in advance and held for up to 1 day. To 
do so, cook the eggs as described. As each egg is removed from the hot water, set it in a 
hotel pan filled with ice water to stop the cooking process. The eggs can then be stored 
in the ice water until needed. For banquet-style service, all the eggs can be reheated at 
once by placing the entire pan on the stove top. Or the eggs can be reheated one or two 
at a time by placing them in a pan of barely simmering water until they are hot.

BREAKFAST AND BRUNCH
In the United States, breakfast is often an on-the-go, rushed experience; hence the popu￾larity of breakfast sandwiches, jumbo muffins and disposable coffee cups. Brunch, on 
the other hand, is a leisurely experience, combining breakfast and lunch into a social 
occasion. Brunch menus include traditional breakfast foods along with almost anything 
else. Unlike breakfast, brunch may be accompanied by champagne or other alcoholic 
beverages and concludes with a pastry or dessert.
Food service operations must offer a variety of breakfast options to appeal to a wide 
range of consumers. Hotels and resorts may offer a continental-style breakfast of coffee, 
juice and sweet rolls; a full-service à la carte dining room; a room service menu and a 
casual snack bar. The grand hotel Sunday and holiday brunch buffet is an American insti￾tution for celebrations and special occasions.
The foods served at breakfast include most of the foods served at other times during 
the day. A diner’s perceptions of a proper breakfast depend on their cultural, ethnic, eco￾nomic and geographic background as well as sleep patterns and work schedule.
Western breakfast menus typically include the following items:
	▪ Coffee, tea or other hot beverages
	▪ Fruits and fruit juices
	▪ Eggs
	▪ Breads, including sweet breads
	▪ Cereals and grains
	▪ Potatoes
M21_LABE1163_07_SE_C21.indd 596 03/11/23 5:53 PM EggS AND BREAkFAST 597
	▪ Pancakes, waffles and French toast
	▪ Meats and fish
	▪ Dairy products, including milk, cheese and yogurt
Although few people could sit down to a breakfast including all of these components 
even occasionally, most food service operations find it necessary to offer some items 
from each category to meet customer expectations.
Breakfast Meats
At other meals meat might be the principal food, but at breakfast it is usually an accom￾paniment. A hearty breakfast menu may include a small beef steak (usually sirloin and 
often pan-fried) or pork chop. Corned beef, roast beef or roast turkey can be diced or 
shredded, then sautéed with potatoes and other ingredients for a breakfast hash. Fish, 
particularly smoked products, are also served at breakfast.
Breakfast meats in the United States tend to be spicy or highly flavored. The most popular 
options are bacon (including Canadian-style bacon), ham and sausages, which are all dis￾cussed in Chapter 28, Charcuterie. Bacon can be cooked on a flat top griddle or in a heavy 
skillet or baked on a sheet pan. Regardless of the method used, the cooked bacon should 
be drained on absorbent paper towels to remove excess fat. Canadian-style bacon is very 
lean and requires little cooking, although slices are usually sautéed briefly before serving. 
The round slices may be served like ham and are essential for Eggs Benedict (page 610). 
A ham steak is simply a thick slice ideal for breakfast. Fully cooked ham needs to be heated 
only briefly on a griddle or in a sauté pan before service. The most popular breakfast sau￾sages are made from uncured, uncooked meats. They can be mild to spicy, slightly sweet 
or strongly seasoned with sage. Recipes for country-style and other sausages are found in 
Chapter 28, Charcuterie. Breakfast sausage is available in bulk, links or preformed patties. 
Link sausage is often partially cooked by steam, then browned by sautéing at service time. It 
should be drained on absorbent paper towels to remove excess fat before service.
 Griddlecakes
Pancakes and waffles are types of griddlecakes or griddle breads, which refers to any 
batter or dough baked on a heated flat metal surface or griddle. They are usually leavened 
with baking soda or baking powder and are quickly cooked with very little fat on a hot 
griddle or in a waffle iron. These griddlecakes should be more than just a vehicle for butter 
and maple syrup, however; they should have a rich flavor and a light, tender, moist interior.
Pancake and waffle batters may be flavored with tangy buckwheat flour, fruits, whole 
grains, nuts or even chocolate chips. Both pancakes and waffles are usually served with 
plain or flavored butter, fruit compote or syrup. Waffles must be cooked in a special waf￾fle iron, which gives them distinctive grid-like pockets and a crisp texture. Electric waffle 
irons should be seasoned well following the manufacturer’s directions. Belgian waffles
are especially light and crisp because whipped egg whites and/or yeast is incorporated. 
They are often made in a waffle iron with extra deep grids and are served for breakfast 
or dessert, topped with fresh fruit, whipped cream or ice cream.

Procedure for Making Pancakes
1 Prepare the batter.
2 Heat a flat griddle or large sauté pan over moderately high heat. Add clarified butter.
3 Portion the pancake batter onto the hot griddle using a portion scoop, ladle or adjustable 
batter dispenser. Pour the portioned batter in one spot; it should spread into an even circle. 
Pour the batter so that no two pancakes will touch after the batter spreads.
4 Cook until bubbles appear on the surface and the bottom of the cake is set and golden 
brown. Flip the pancake using an offset spatula.
5 Cook the pancake until the second side is golden brown. Avoid flipping the pancake more 
than once, as this causes it to deflate.

Crêpes
Crêpes are thin, delicate, unleavened pancakes. They are made with a very liquid egg 
batter cooked in a small, very hot sauté pan or crêpe pan. Crêpe batter can be flavored 
with buckwheat flour, cornmeal or other grains. Refrigerating crêpe batter after mixing is 
recommended to allow the moisture to evenly distribute through the mixture. Crêpes are 
not eaten plain but are usually filled and garnished with sautéed fruits, scrambled eggs, 
cheese or vegetables. Crêpes can be prepared in advance, then filled and reheated in 
the oven. Blintzes are crêpes that are cooked on only one side, then filled with cheese, 
browned in butter and served with sour cream, fruit compote or preserves.
Procedure for Preparing Crêpes
1 Prepare the batter at least 1 hour before using and keep refrigerated.
2 Heat a well-seasoned crêpe pan or small sauté pan over moderately high heat. Add a small 
amount of clarified butter.
3 Ladle a small amount of batter into the pan. Tilt the pan so that the batter spreads and 
coats the bottom evenly.
4 Cook until the crêpe is set and the bottom begins to brown, approximately 1 minute. Flip 
the crêpe over in the pan with a quick flick of the wrist or by lifting it carefully with a spatula.
5 Cook the crêpe for an additional 30 seconds. Slide the finished crêpe from the pan. Crêpes 
can be stacked between layers of parchment paper for storage.

Cooked white grits
Cereals and Grains
Oats, rice, corn and wheat are widely eaten breakfast foods in the United States. 
Processed breakfast cereals are ready-to-eat products made from these grains. Most U.S. 
consumers now think of breakfast cereal as a cold food, but not so long ago only hot 
grains were breakfast staples. Oatmeal served as a hot porridge is popular, especially 
with health-conscious diners. Oatmeal is often topped with cream, brown sugar, nuts, 
fresh or dried fruit or fruit preserves for a more appealing presentation. (See Oatmeal 
with Bananas and Almond Butter, page 615.) Grits, made from ground hominy 
corn, are another grain product served hot at breakfast. Grits may be topped 
with butter and presented as a starch side dish or served in a bowl as a por￾ridge with cream and brown sugar. Oats and oatmeal, grits and other grains 
are discussed in Chapter 23, Potatoes, Grains and Pasta.
Ready-to-eat (cold) cereal is usually topped with milk or light 
cream and sugar. Creative cooks can avoid overly sweet, artificially 
flavored commercial products by making their own ready-to-eat break￾fast cereals such as muesli or granola, a toasted blend of whole grains, 
nuts and dried fruits. The results are less expensive, more nutritious and 
far more interesting.
Contemporary tastes are influencing what constitutes breakfast. Breakfast 
bowls and breakfast salads offer the chef an opportunity to incorporate several ele￾ments in one dish. (See Avocado, Bacon and Red Rice Breakfast Salad, page 611.) 
Breakfast bowls consist of a base such as cooked oatmeal, rice or grains or cold 
cereal or granola garnished with sliced avocadoes, berries, citrus fruit, nuts, and 
seeds. The flavor profile may be savory or sweet with complimenting garnishes. 
A poached or fried egg can be added to many fresh green salads or stewed veg￾etables to create a breakfast or brunch item, and the traditional Asian breakfast of 
Cantonese-Style Congee (page 616) or seasoned rice topped with a fried egg is pop￾ular among some western diners, too. The Spinach and Edamame Salad on page 771 
and the Mango, Pineapple and Strawberry Salad with Coconut Cream on page 810 
are suitable for breakfast.

From Health Food to Sugar Snack
The multibillion-dollar-a-year American 
breakfast cereal industry, unlike any other in 
the world, is rooted in health foods. During 
the 1890s, Dr. John Harvey kellogg directed a 
sanitarium in Battle Creek, Michigan. Among 
the healthful foods prescribed for his patients 
was his special mixture of whole grains called 
“granula.” John, along with his brother Will, 
next created and began marketing wheat flakes 
as a nutritious breakfast food. They were 
not an immediate success, however; initially 
people found a cold breakfast unappealing. 
Undeterred, Will continued toying with cold 
cereals, eventually creating flakes made from 
toasted corn and malt. Thanks to a massive 
advertising campaign, the American public 
finally embraced corn flakes and a financial 
empire was born.
Charles W. Post was a patient of 
Dr. kellogg’s Battle Creek Sanitarium in 1891. 
He adopted the principles of healthful eating 
espoused by the kellogg brothers and soon 
opened his own spa, complete with a factory 
producing his “Post Toasties” and “grape￾Nuts.” He promoted them as a cure for 
appendicitis, consumption and malaria.
Soon Battle Creek became a boomtown, 
home to more than 40 breakfast cereal 
companies. Unfortunately for the consumer, 
not all manufacturers—then and now—were as 
concerned about health as John, Will and C. W. 
The addition of sugar, sometimes totaling 
more than half the cereal’s weight, makes some 
of today’s breakfast products more sugary 
than candy bars. Even some of the granola 
cereals touted as healthier alternatives to other 
breakfast cereals and snacks contain 20 percent 
sugar or more. But at least they no longer claim 
to cure malaria.

IDENTIFY AND PREPARE COFFEE, TEA AND TISANES
Most restaurant beverage menus feature coffee and tea. Despite the relatively low cost to 
prepare these beverages, they can be extremely valuable to customers and important to 
their impression of the entire food service operation. Coffee and tea can also be found 
in the kitchen, where coffee beans, tea leaves and beverages made from them are used 
in brines, marinades, sweet and savory sauces and as flavorings in pastries and desserts. 
Chefs should, therefore, be familiar with these items as ingredients, as well as know how 
to prepare and serve these beverages.
Coffee
Coffee (Fr. café) begins as the fruit of a small tree grown in tropical and subtropical 
regions throughout the world. The fruit, referred to as a cherry, is bright red with trans￾lucent flesh surrounding two flat-sided seeds. These seeds are the coffee beans. When 
ripe, the cherries are harvested by hand, cleaned, fermented and hulled, leaving the 
green coffee beans. The beans are then roasted, blended, ground and brewed. Note that 
any coffee bean can be roasted to any degree of darkness, ground to any degree of fine￾ness and brewed by any number of methods.
Two species of coffee bean are the most widely used: arabica and robusta. Arabica 
beans are the most important commercially and the ones from which the finest coffees 
are produced. Robusta beans do not produce as flavorful a drink as arabica. Nevertheless, 
robusta beans are significant commercially because robusta trees are heartier and pro￾duce more fruit than arabica trees. Coffee takes much of its flavor and character from 
the soil, sunlight and air, so the beans’ origin is critical to quality. Each valley and 
mountain produces coffee distinct from all others, so geographic names are used to 
identify the beans. Thus purveyors offer beans known as Colombian Supremo, Ethiopian 
Yirgacheffe, Yemen Mocha, Jamaican Blue Mountain, Indonesian Java and Hawaiian 
Kona to name just a few.
Roasting Coffee
Roasting releases and enhances the flavors in coffee beans. It also darkens the beans and brings 
natural oils to the surface. In general, roasts fall into categories based on color as follows:
City roast: Also called American or brown roast, city roast is medium brown in color. 
It produces a beverage that may lack brilliance or be a bit flat, yet it is the roast most 
often used in mass-market blends.
Brazilian: Somewhat darker than a city roast, Brazilian roast begins to show a hint of 
dark-roast flavor. The beans show a trace of oil.
French roast: French roast, also called New Orleans or dark roast, approaches espresso 
in flavor without sacrificing smoothness. French roasted beans are the color of semi￾sweet chocolate, with apparent oiliness on the surface.
Espresso roast: Espresso roast, also called Italian roast, is the darkest of all. The beans 
are black with a shiny, oily surface.
Grinding Coffee
Unlike roasting, which is best left to the experts, the grinding of coffee beans is best left 
to the consumer or food service operation. Whole coffee beans stay fresh longer than 
ground coffee. Ground coffee kept in an airtight container away from heat and light will 
stay fresh for 3 or 4 days. Whole beans stay fresh for a few weeks, even longer if they 
are vacuum sealed.
The grind determines the length of time it takes to achieve the best flavor extraction 
from the beans. The proper grind is whichever grind allows this to happen in the time it 
takes a specific coffee maker to complete its brewing cycle. As a general rule, finer grinds 
are used for espresso, while coarser grinds are used for drip or filter brewing. Follow the 
directions for your coffee maker or ask your specialty coffee purveyor for guidance.

 Brewing Coffee 
 Coffee is brewed by one of two methods: decoction or infusion. Decoction is boiling 
a substance until its flavor is removed. Boiling is the oldest method of making coffee, 
but is no longer used except in preparing extremely strong Turkish coffee. Infusion
involves the extraction of flavors at temperatures below boiling. Infusion techniques 
include steeping (mixing hot water with ground coffee), filtering (slowly pouring hot 
water over ground coffee held in a filter) and dripping (pouring hot water over ground 
coffee and passing the liquid through a strainer). Commercially made cold-brew cof￾fee is made by steeping grounds in room temperature water for several hours and then 
straining out the grounds. The use of cool water is said to prevent bitterness and create 
a strong, smooth coffee. 
 Drip Brewing 
 Drip or filtered coffee is the most common style served in the United States. It is typi￾cally prepared with a machine that operates on the principle of gravity. Water is placed 
in a reservoir, heated and released slowly over the coffee grounds, which are held 
in a filter. 
 For drip coffee, the best results are achieved by using 2 level tablespoons 
(30 milliliters) of ground coffee per 6 fluid ounces (180 milliliters) of water. Note that 
a standard “cup” of coffee is smaller than a standard measuring cup; 1 pound (454 
grams) of coffee yields approximately 80 level tablespoons, enough for 40 cups of 
coffee. If stronger coffee is desired, use more coffee per cup of water, not a longer 
brewing time. For weaker coffee, prepare regular-strength coffee and dilute it with 
hot water. Never reuse coffee grounds. 
 Drip-coffee is used in the following popular drinks: 
Café au lait: Strong drip coffee (instead of espresso) and hot, not steamed, milk. 
French press: Ground coffee is combined with very hot water in a lidded carafe and 
allowed to infuse for several minutes. A plunger is then used to push the grounds to 
the bottom of the carafe, separating them from the coffee. 
Iced coffee: Strong drip coffee served over ice. Cold leftover coffee should not be 
used to make iced coffee. 
 Espresso Brewing 
 Espresso refers to a brewing method in which hot water is forced through finely ground 
and tightly packed coffee under high pressure. Espresso can only be made with a prop￾erly calibrated espresso maker in order to achieve the desired flavor and appearance. 
Properly made espresso is strong, rich and smooth, not bitter or acidic. As the coffee 
drains into the cup, it is golden brown, forming a crema or foam that lies on top of the 
black coffee. Espresso is often used in making iced and flavored coffee beverages, but 
plain espresso is not served iced. 
 Coffee beans used in making espresso should be finely ground immediately before 
brewing. A single serving of espresso uses about ¼ ounce (7 grams) of ground beans to 
1½ fluid ounces (45 milliliters) water. North Americans tend to prefer a larger portion, 
known as espresso lungo , made with 2–3 fluid ounces (60–90 milliliters) water. 
 Espresso is used in the following popular drinks:

 Milk is steamed and frothed for beverages with the steaming 
rod on espresso machines. Any type of milk can be used to make 
espresso beverages. Whole, skim, almond, oat and soy milk are 
commonly offered. A higher fat milk produces a creamier tasting 
beverage but is more difficult to froth with steam. 
 Conditions That Affect the Quality of Coffee 
 Water quality can alter flavors and cause mineral deposits to build 
up in coffee machines. Therefore many commercial establish￾ments install in-line water filters or purifiers for their equipment. 
Oils from coffee beans form an invisible film on the inside of 
coffee makers and pots, imparting a rancid or stale flavor to later 
batches. Brew pots and carafes should be cleaned well with hot 
water between each use; coffee makers should be periodically 
disassembled and cleaned according to the manufacturer’s direc￾tions, a process also known as descaling. 
 Finally, coffee should be served as soon as it is brewed. One acceptable holding 
method, however, is to use a thermal carafe. Never attempt to reheat cold coffee, as 
drastic temperature changes can destroy flavor. 
 Tasting Coffee 
 Coffee is judged on four characteristics: aroma, acidity, body and flavor. Cupping is 
a traditional method used worldwide by professional coffee buyers and merchants to 
evaluate beans and produce consistent, desirable products. 
Aroma refers to the way a coffee smells. Hundreds of aromatic compounds are found 
in coffee, and aroma is a very important element for judging quality. 
Acidity , also called wininess , refers to the tartness of the coffee. Balanced acidity is a 
desirable characteristic that adds a bright liveliness to the coffee. 
Body refers to the feeling of heaviness or thickness that coffee has on the palate. 
Aftertaste or finish is one aspect of body. 
Flavor is the most important characteristic. Terms such as mellow, harsh, grassy and 
earthy are used to describe the subjective characteristics of flavor. 
 Flavored Coffees 
 Dried, ground chicory root has long been added to coffee by those who enjoy its bit￾ter flavor. Toasted barley and spices are mixed with coffee in various cultures. Coffees 
flavored with chocolate, liqueurs, spices and nuts are now widely popular. These flavors 
are added to roasted coffee beans by tumbling them with flavoring oils. The results are 
strongly aromatic flavors such as vanilla hazelnut, tiramisu or maple walnut. Coffee bev￾erages are also flavored with sweet syrups available in dozens of flavors, from almond 
 cupping testing coffee or tea for taste and 
quality, often performed by a professional 
taster trained to identify key coffee or tea 
characteristics and test for problems or faults

 A Cup of Coffee History 
 A hot beverage made from berries of the 
tropical coffee tree ( coffea ) was probably 
first consumed sometime during the ninth 
century C.E. in Persia. Although the drink 
was probably very thick and acrid, by the year 
1000, the elite of the Arab world were regularly 
drinking a decoction of dried coffee beans and 
enjoying the effects of caffeine. The beans were 
harvested in Abyssinia (Ethiopia) and brought 
to market by Egyptian merchants. Within 
a century or so, kahwa became immensely 
popular within Arab society and coffeehouses 
opened throughout the Eastern Mediterranean. 
 Coffee did not become popular in Europe 
until the 17th century, its popularity due 
in great part to Suleiman Aga, the grand 
Panjandrum of the Ottoman Empire. In 1669 
he met king Louis XIV of France, bringing with 
him many imported treasures, including coffee. 
Coffee soon became the drink of choice for the 
French aristocracy. 
 Coffee was exorbitantly expensive in Europe 
due to trade monopolies on the beans. But 
by the end of the 17th century, the Dutch had 
stolen coffee plants from Arabia and began 
cultivating them in their Indonesian colonies, 
especially on the island of Java. By the early 
18th century, the French had transported 
seedlings to the West Indies; from there coffee 
plantations spread throughout South and 
Central America and the Caribbean islands. 
A French Catholic missionary planted the 
first coffee tree in Vietnam in 1857. During 
the French colonization of southeast Asia 
(Indochina) in the 20th century, coffee 
production expanded in the region. Today, 
coffee is produced commercially in over 70 
countries; Brazil, Vietnam and Columbia are 
the world’s top producers. 
M21_LABE1163_07_SE_C21.indd 604 03/11/23 5:53 PM EggS AND BREAkFAST 605
to pumpkin spice and salted caramel. Baristas blend these syrups with coffee, steamed 
milk and other ingredients to create seasonal or trendy flavor profiles.
Decaffeinated Coffee
Caffeine is a water-soluble alkaloid found in coffee beans (and in tea leaves and cocoa 
beans). It is a stimulant that can improve alertness. In excess, however, caffeine can 
cause some people to suffer palpitations or insomnia. Regular filtered coffee contains 
85–100 milligrams of caffeine per cup. Robusta beans contain more caffeine than arabica 
beans. To remove the caffeine, unroasted coffee beans are treated with water and liquid 
carbon dioxide, activated charcoal or chemicals. The resulting beans (with only 1–3 per￾cent caffeine) are roasted and processed like any other beans.
Tea and Tisanes
Tea and tisanes are beverages made from dried leaves, herbs, spices, flowers or fruits 
that are prepared by infusion, that is, steeping in freshly boiled hot water. Tea (Fr. Thé,
Ch. Cha) is the name given to the leaves of Camellia sinensis, a shrub that grows at high 
altitudes in tropical regions. Drinks made from tea leaves contain caffeine and are con￾sumed by more than half the world’s population, both hot and cold. Tisanes are herbal 
infusions, which do not contain any true tea leaves. Tisanes have long been popular in 
Asia for their perceived health benefits. As customers became familiar with the endless 
varieties of caffeine-free herbal teas, worldwide consumption of tisanes increased.
Tea Varieties
Although tea comes from only one species of plant, there are three general categories: black, 
green and oolong. The differences among the three result from the amount of oxidation after 
harvest. Just as apples turn brown when cut, tea leaves also brown, or oxidize, when broken. 
To stop this browning, the leaves are gently heated or roasted. The amount of browning per￾mitted before roasting determines the category. Black tea is completely oxidized, green tea 
is roasted quickly to prevent browning and oolong falls anywhere between these extremes. 
The term fermentation was previously used in the west to refer to this browning due to a 
mistranslation from Chinese terminology. No microbial fermentation occurs in this process.
As with coffee, tea takes much of its flavor from the geographic conditions in which 
it is grown. Teas are named for their place of origin—for example, Darjeeling or Assam 
(India), Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) or Yunnan (China). Other commercially packaged teas 
are blends of leaves from various sources. Flavored tea refers to those blended with 
essential oils, dried fruit, spices, flowers or herbs before brewing. Chai is a black tea and 
milk beverage that is sweetened and flavored with cinnamon, cardamom, vanilla or other 
spices. It may be served hot or iced and takes its name from the Chinese word for tea.
Black Tea
Black tea is amber-brown and strongly flavored. Its color and flavor result from fully 
oxidizing the leaves. Because larger leaves brew more slowly than smaller ones, black 
teas are sorted by leaf size for efficient brewing. Souchong denotes large leaves, pekoe
denotes medium-sized leaves and orange pekoe denotes the smallest whole leaves. (Note 
that orange pekoe does not refer to any type of orange flavor.) Pieces of broken tea 
leaves result in a darker, quicker brew and are used in tea bags. Black teas may be 
served hot or iced and are usually accompanied by lemon or milk and sweeteners. 
Eighty-five percent of the tea consumed in the United States is iced, a uniquely American 
preference. Some popular types of black teas include the following:
Assam: A rich black tea from northeastern India with a reddish color; a popular 
breakfast tea.
Darjeeling: The champagne of teas, grown in the foothills of the Himalayas; full￾bodied, black tea with a muscat flavor.
Earl Grey: A blend of black teas flavored with oil of bergamot; popular for afternoon tea.
English Breakfast: An English blend of Indian and Sri Lankan black teas; full-bodied 
with a rich color.

oxygen; often causes a change in color

Tea Bags
The invention of the tea bag was 
apparently inadvertent. According 
to the Tea Association of America, in 
1904 Thomas Sullivan, a New York tea 
merchant, sent potential customers 
samples of tea in small muslin or silk 
bags. Finding that they could make tea 
by simply pouring boiling water over 
the bags, Sullivan’s new customers 
clamored for more.

 Green Tea 
Green tea is yellowish-green in color with a grassy, earthy flavor and a slight bitterness. 
The leaves are not oxidized. Green tea is considered to be especially healthy due to its 
high antioxidant content. Japanese green tea, known as sencha , is steamed rather than 
roasted and is prized for its green color and umami flavor. Green tea is also made into 
a powder known as matcha , which is used in traditional tea ceremonies. Lesser grades 
of green tea powder are used to flavor and color foods from ice cream to bread. Green 
teas should be brewed at lower temperatures than black teas and are often served cool, 
rather than hot. Some popular types of green teas include the following: 
Gunpowder: A Chinese green tea with a tightly curled leaf and 
gray-green color. The brewed tea has a pungent flavor and a 
light straw color; often served after the evening meal. 
Sencha (common): A delicate Japanese green tea that has a 
light color with a pronounced aroma and a bright, grassy taste. 
White tea: A delicate green tea with a subtle flavor made from 
young buds picked before they open and allowed to wither so 
that moisture evaporates naturally; dried to a pale silvery color. 
 Oolong Tea 
Oolong tea is partially oxidized to combine the characteristics of black and green teas. 
Oolong is popular in China and Japan, often flavored with jasmine flowers. It is typically 
served hot, without milk or lemon. 
 Tisane (Herbal Tea) Varieties 
 Tisanes are infusions or decoctions commonly called herbal teas. They are made 
from fresh or dried flowers, fruits, herbs, seeds or roots; chamomile, mint, ginseng, 
ginger and hibiscus are popular varieties. Many flavors are marketed as pre- packaged 
blends ready for brewing. Rooibos tea , made from the leaves of a bush indigenous 
to southern Africa, is popular brewed alone or used in tisane blends. Also known 
as red tea, rooibos tastes and looks very similar to black tea but is naturally caf￾feine free. Tisanes may be served after meals to aid digestion or drunk before bed 
as a sleep aid. (Herbal teas and tisanes usually contain no caffeine.) Restaurants 
and coffee shops typically offer these teas as an option for customers who prefer to 
avoid caffeine. 
 Storing and Brewing Tea and Tisanes 
 For proper storage, keep tea and tisanes in opaque containers away from heat, light and 
moisture. Do not freeze or refrigerate tea leaves or tea bags as the moisture can lead 
to spoilage. 
 Hot tea and tisanes may be brewed by the cup or the pot. In either case, it is impor￾tant to use the following procedure: 
1 Begin with clean equipment and fresh cold water. Water that has been sitting in a 
kettle or hot water tank contains less air and will taste flat or stale. 
2 Warm the teapot by rinsing its interior with hot water. This relaxes the tea leaves 
and ensures that the water stays hot when poured into the tea pot. 
3 Place 1 teaspoon (5 milliliters) loose tea or one tea bag per cup (6 fluid 
ounces/180 milliliters) of water capacity in the warmed teapot. 
4 As soon as the water comes to the recommended temperature (see Table  21. 2 ), 
remove it from the heat and pour the appropriate amount over the tea. Do 
not allow the water to continue boiling before pouring as boiling removes the 
oxygen, leaving a flat taste.

Tasting Tea and Tisanes
Tea is described according to three key characteristics: astringency or briskness, body 
and aroma. Astringency refers to a sharp, dry feeling on the tongue that contributes to 
the refreshing taste of a tea. It is caused by tannins, a type of antioxidant compound 
extracted from tea leaves. Body refers to the feeling of weight on the tongue. Teas range 
from light to full bodied. Aroma is the smell of the brewed tea, which may naturally 
include fruity, woody or vegetal notes.
Tisanes may have a strong aroma from a single herb or spice or a more subtle aroma 
from a blend of complementary fruits and flowers. Tisanes rarely have the astringency of 
tea, however, as tannin is usually absent.
5 Replace the lid on the teapot and allow the tea to infuse for the recommended 
time. Color is not a reliable indication of brewing time; tea leaves release 
color before flavor, and different types of tea will be different colors when 
properly brewed.
6 Remove the tea bags or strain out the loose tea from the water when brewing 
is complete.
7 Serve immediately, accompanied with sugar, lemon, milk (not cream, which may 
curdle) and honey as desired. A cup of tea can be diluted with additional hot 
water if desired.
8 Do not reuse tea leaves. One pound of tea yields 200 cups, making it extremely 
inexpensive.
For iced tea, prepare regular brewed tea using 50 percent more tea. Cool to room 
temperature, then pour the tea over ice. The stronger brew will hold its flavor better as 
the ice melts. For clarity and flavor, freshly brewed tea is best, but if iced tea will not be 
used immediately, it can be brewed slowly at room temperature or in a refrigerator for 
several hours to prevent cloudiness.

TABLE 21.2
Southern Sweet Tea 
Sweet tea is an iced beverage traditionally 
offered in the American South. It is now 
making its way into many bottled tea 
drinks, fast-food menus and even vodka 
flavorings and cocktails. Sweet tea is not 
merely iced tea plus sugar. To achieve 
the desired flavor, which most closely 
resembles a tea-flavored soft drink, a large 
quantity of granulated sugar is dissolved 
in strong, hot black tea—typically 1½ to 
2 cups of sugar per gallon of tea. The tea 
must be brewed very strong to compensate 
for the dilution caused by melting ice. 
Adding sugar to chilled tea will not 
produce the famed “sweet tea” flavor.

 A Cup of Tea History 
 Legend holds that the Chinese emperor Shen 
Nung discovered tea drinking in 2737 B.C.E. 
 Supposedly he was boiling his drinking water 
beneath a tree when some leaves fell into the 
pot. Enchanted with the drink, he began to 
cultivate the plant. Whether true or not, it is 
known that a hot drink made from powdered 
dried tea leaves whipped into hot water 
was regularly consumed in China beginning 
sometime after the fourth century C.E. 
 By the ninth century C.E., tea drinking had 
spread to Japan. In both cultures, tea drinking 
developed into a ritual. For the Chinese, a cup 
of tea became the mirror of the soul. For the 
Japanese, it was the drink of immortality. 
 Tea was first transported from China 
to Europe by Dutch merchants during the 
early 1600s, soon reaching England. In 
1600 Queen Elizabeth I granted the British 
East India Company exclusive rights to 
trade goods (including tea) with the East 
Indies, a monopoly it held until the 1830s. 
To ensure a steady supply, the English 
surreptitiously procured plants from China 
and started plantations throughout the Indian 
subcontinent, as did the Dutch. 
 Tea drinking became fashionable in England, 
at least in court circles, through Charles II 
(who reigned from 1660 to 1685) and his 
Portuguese wife, Catherine of Braganza. 
 The social custom of afternoon tea began 
in the late 1700s, thanks to Anna, Duchess 
of Bedford. She developed the late-afternoon 
ritual of snacking on sandwiches and pastries 
accompanied by tea to quell her hunger pangs 
between breakfast and dinner. 
 Eventually two distinct types of teatime 
evolved. Low tea was aristocratic in origin 
and consisted of pastries and sandwiches 
served with tea in the late afternoon before the 
evening meal. High tea was bourgeois in origin, 
consisting of leftovers from the large middle￾class lunch, such as cold meats, bread and 
cheeses. High tea became a substitute for the 
evening meal.

Cinnamon French Toast Vegetarian
French toast is known in France as pain perdu, meaning “lost bread,” probably because it provided a 
way to use day-old bread that would otherwise have been discarded. French bread, sourdough bread, 
raisin bread, challah, whole-wheat bread and even croissants can be used. The bread is dipped into a 
batter of eggs, sugar, milk or cream and flavorings, then sautéed in butter and served very hot. It may 
be topped with powdered sugar, fresh fruit, fruit compote or maple syrup as desired.

 Cantonese-Style Congee 
 Congee refers to a large category of porridge or soup-type rice dishes eaten throughout the world, but 
especially associated with Asian cuisines. Congee is a breakfast staple in China and southeast Asia 
and a comfort food for anyone who is ill. It is also served during Lunar New Year celebrations as a 
promise of good fortune.
Begin by boiling rice slowly in a large quantity of water or stock until it forms a smooth, viscous 
soup. Then add pieces of meat, seafood, vegetables, eggs and condiments to each bowl as desired. 
Although this seems simple, congee is difficult to master. The balance of water to rice, the type of rice 
used and the cooking time and temperature must all be in balance to create the correct sleek, silky 
texture. This recipe uses medium-grain rice, but any Japonica-type rice can be used. Basmati, brown 
and arborio rice are not recommended. The ratio of liquid to rice ranges from 8 to 15 times as much 
liquid as rice.
 YIELD 6 Servings, 12 fl. oz. (360 ml) each METHOD Simmering
Medium-grain white rice 6 oz. 180 g
Vegetable stock or water 2½ qt. 2½ lt
Fresh ginger, 2-inch (5-centimeter) 1 1
pieces, crushed
Salt and white pepper TT TT
Fresh ginger, peeled, julienne as needed for garnish
Green onions, cut thin on the bias as needed for garnish
1 Rinse the rice under cold running water. Soak the rice in water for at least 30 minutes, or overnight, 
under refrigeration. 
2 Add the stock to an 8-quart (8-liter) saucepot. Drain the rice and stir it into the stock. Bring to a 
boil over medium heat, stirring occasionally and skimming the surface periodically to remove 
impurities. Reduce to a simmer and add the ginger. 
3 Cover and simmer until the rice is tender and the liquid has become silky smooth and thick enough 
to coat a spoon, approximately 2 hours. Stir frequently to prevent the rice from sticking to the bot￾tom of the pot. Add more stock if the congee gets too thick. 
4 Season to taste with salt and white pepper. Serve in warm bowls garnished with the fresh ginger 
and green onions. 
Note Cantonese-style Congee is traditionally served with a variety of accompaniments, such as shred￾ded meat, seafood, eggs or fried dough, along with toppings including soy sauce, celery, fried shallots, 
fresh ginger, dried shrimp, garlic chives or tangerine peel. 
 Variation: 
Chicken or Pork Congee —Use chicken broth or a combination of broth and water to prepare the congee. 
Top each portion with 1 ounce (30 grams) shredded roasted chicken meat, chopped Asian-Style 
Pork Belly (page 444) or cooked, shredded pork rib meat. Add other garnishes as desired.

22. 8 explain various ways of 
preserving vegetables 
 Fresh, properly prepared vegetables can add flavor, color and variety to almost any 
dish. by reducing the use of animal products and shifting the focus onto vegetable 
preparations, contemporary chefs are making plant-based dishes the center of atten￾tion. Vegetables are no longer an afterthought or merely added to a plate for color. Chefs 
and consumers now understand the important role plant-centered meals play in personal 
health and the health of our planet. Many restaurants routinely offer vegetarian entrées, an 
extensive selection of vegetable side dishes or an entire vegetarian menu. this reflects the 
demands of knowledgeable and health-conscious consumers as well as the increased avail￾ability of high-quality fresh produce. (Cooking with vegetables and other ingredients in meat￾less diets is discussed in Chapter 26 , Plant-based Cooking.)
 In this chapter, we identify many vegetables typically used in food service operations. 
(Potatoes are discussed in Chapter 23 , Potatoes, grains and Pasta; greens and ingredients for 
salads are discussed in Chapter 24 , salads and salad Dressings.) We also discuss how to pur￾chase, store and prepare fresh and preserved vegetables for service or cooking and how to apply 
many of the cooking methods introduced in Chapter 10 , Principles of Cooking, to vegetables. 
 the term vegetable refers to any herbaceous plant that can be partially or wholly eaten. 
an herbaceous plant is one with little or no woody tissue. the portions of these plants that 
humans consume may include the leaves, stems, roots, tubers, seeds and flowers. Vegetables 
contain more starch and less sugar than fruits. therefore vegetables tend to be savory, not 
sweet. also in contrast to fruits, vegetables are often eaten cooked, not raw. because they 
are generally high in dietary fiber and complex carbohydrates, low in fat or fat-free and good 
sources of vitamins, minerals and phytochemicals, vegetables are considered a vital part of 
a balanced diet. Refer to the discussion of essential nutrients in Chapter 3 , Nutrition and 
Healthy Cooking, for more detailed information on the healthful properties of vegetables.
 IDENTIFYING VEGETABLES 
 This book presents fruits and vegetables according to the ways most people view 
them and use them, rather than by rigid botanical classifications. Although produce 
such as tomatoes, peppers and eggplants are botanically fruits, they are prepared 
and served like vegetables so we include them here under the category “fruit veg￾etables.” Potatoes, although botanically vegetables, are discussed with other starches 
in Chapter 23 , Potatoes, Grains and Pasta. 
 We sort vegetables into nine categories based on either botanical relationship or 
edible part: cabbages, fruit vegetables, gourds and squashes, greens, mushrooms and 
truffles, onions, pods and seeds, roots and tubers, and stalk vegetables. Some vegetables 
have several names that vary from region to region or on a purveyor’s whim. The names 
used here follow generally accepted custom and usage. 
 Cabbages 
 The Brassica or cabbage family includes a wide range of vegetables used for their heads, 
flowers or leaves. They are part of a group of vegetables referred to as cruciferous , 
widely recognized for their health-promoting properties. Brassicas are high in vitamins 
C and K, folate, potassium and other minerals as well as phytochemicals that constitute 
important components of a healthy diet. Brassicas also contain sulfur compounds that 
give these vegetables a strong aroma and bitter flavor when overcooked. 
 Members of this family are generally quick-growing, cool-weather crops. Many are 
ancient plants with unknown origins. Cabbages are inexpensive, readily available and 
easy to prepare. 
 fiber also known as dietary fiber; indigestible 
carbohydrates found in grains, fruits and 
vegetables; fiber aids digestion 
 cruciferous plants from the cabbage family 
including broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, kale, 
rutabaga and turnip; also called brassicas

Bok Choy
Bok choy is a white-stemmed variety of southern Chinese cabbage. The relatively tightly 
packed leaves are dark green, with long white ribs attached at a bulbous stem. The 
stems are crisp and mild with a flavor similar to romaine lettuce. Although bok choy 
may be eaten raw, it is most often stir-fried or used in soups. Choose heads of bok choy 
with bright white stems and dark green leaves; avoid those with brown, moist spots.
Broccoli
Broccoli has a thick central stalk with grayish￾green leaves topped with heads of green 
florets. Broccoli is eaten raw or steamed, 
microwaved or sautéed and served warm or 
cold. Broccoli stalks are extremely firm and ben￾efit from blanching. Stems are often slow-cooked 
for soups. Generally broccoli leaves are not eaten. 
Choose broccoli with firm stalks and compact clusters 
of tightly closed dark green florets. Avoid stalks with 
yellow florets.
bok choy

Procedure for Cutting Broccoli Spears
Cut off the thick, woody portion of the stalk, then 
cut the florets and stems into spears. Peel the 
stems if using.
Broccoli Rabe
Broccoli rabe, also known as raab [rob] and rapini [rah-PEE-nee] (It. broccoli di rape, 
cime di rapa), is a leafy green with small florets that look similar to broccoli florets. The 
entire plant is eaten, although some prefer to separate the spiky leaves and green florets 
from the more bitter stems. Broccoli rabe may be boiled, steamed, roasted or sautéed, 
and its peppery, bitter flavor is a popular ingredient in both Chinese and Mediterranean, 
especially Italian, cuisine. Select rabe with bright green leaves and unopened buds; 
avoid plants with wilted or yellow leaves.
Brussels Sprouts
Brussels sprouts (Fr. choux de Bruxelles) consist of numerous small heads arranged in 
neat rows along a thick stalk. The tender young sprouts look like baby cabbages and are 
usually steamed or roasted. Brussels sprouts have a strong, nutty flavor that blends well 
with game, ham, duck, rich meats or tree nuts. Choose small, firm sprouts that are com￾pact and heavy. The best size is ¾–1½ inches (2–4 centimeters) in diameter. They should 
be bright green and free of blemishes. Brussels sprouts last longer when purchased on 
the stem. The flavor of Brussels sprouts intensifies with longer storage.

Romanesco Fioretto
Purple, green and yellow cauliflower
Cauliflower
Cauliflower (Fr. chou-fleur) like broccoli grows on a thick stalk. Each stalk produces one 
flower, called a head, surrounded by large green leaves. The head, composed of creamy 
white florets, can be cooked whole or cut into separate florets for roasting, steaming, 
blanching or stir-frying. Choose firm, compact cauliflower heads. Any attached leaves 
should be bright green and crisp. A yellow color or spreading florets indicate that the 
vegetable is overly mature.
Visually distinctive varieties of cauliflower are now available, allowing chefs to add 
color to plate presentations. Purple, bright green and orange cauliflower have vibrant, 
naturally colored florets, with the same flavor and nutritional value as white cauli￾flower. Romanesco is an Italian heirloom variety with a head of bright green 
spiraling florets and a flavor closest to that of broccoli. All can be eaten raw 
or prepared in the same ways as common white cauliflower.
Fioretto is a hybrid brassica with small cream-colored florets atop slender 
 broccoli-like stems. Known as karifurore in Japan where it was developed, its 
unique shape and naturally tender texture make fioretto excellent for eating 
raw. Its delicate, slightly sweet flavor also benefits from being lightly sea￾soned in a quick stir fry, gently roasted or fried in tempura batter.
Cauliflower
Procedure for Cutting Cauliflower Florets
➊ Cut off the stem and leaves. ➋ Cut the florets off the core.
gai lan
Gai Lan
Gai lan, also known as Chinese broccoli, flowering kale or kai rô, has long stems 
with large, flat leaves and tiny florets, all of which are eaten. Its appearance and fla￾vor are similar to broccoli but with a slight bitterness that combines well with garlic, 
ginger and oyster sauce. Gai lan is typically cooked in soups, steamed or stir-fried in 
Southeast Asian and Chinese cuisines.

Napa cabbage
savoy cabbage
Kohlrabi
baby kale
 Kale
green and red cabbages
Head Cabbages (Green and Red)
Cabbage (Fr. chou) has been a staple of northern European cuisine for centuries. 
The familiar green cabbage has a large, firm, round head with tightly packed pale 
green leaves. Flat and cone-shaped heads are also available. Red (or purple) 
cabbage is a different strain and may be tougher than green cabbage. Cabbage 
can be eaten raw (as in coleslaw) or used in soups or stews; it can be braised, 
steamed or stir-fried. The large, waxy leaves can also be steamed until soft, 
then wrapped around a filling of seasoned meat. Choose firm cabbage heads 
without dried cores.
Kale
Kale has large ruffled, curly or bumpy leaves. 
Its rather bitter flavor goes well with beans and 
rich meats such as game, pork or ham. Kale 
is typically boiled, stuffed or used in soups. 
Tender baby kale suitable for eating raw is 
also popular in salads. Ornamental or flower￾ing kale, sometimes marketed as “savoy,” is 
edible but bitter and tough; its pink, purple, 
yellow or white-and-green variegated leaves 
are best used for decoration and garnish. 
Choose leaves that are crisp, with a grayish￾green color.
Kohlrabi
Although it looks rather like a round root, kohlrabi is actually a bulbous stem 
vegetable created by crossbreeding cabbages and turnips. Both the leaves 
(which are attached directly to the bulbous stem) and the roots are gener￾ally removed before sale. Depending on the variety, kohlrabi skin may be 
light green, purple or green with a hint of red. The interior flesh is white, 
with a sweet flavor similar to that of turnips. (Kohlrabi can be substituted for 
turnip in many recipes.) Younger plants are milder and more tender than 
large, mature ones. The outer skin must be removed from mature stems; 
young stems only need to be well scrubbed before cooking. Kohlrabi can 
be eaten raw, or it can be cooked (whole, sliced or diced) with moist-heat 
cooking methods such as boiling and steaming. Kohlrabi may also be hol￾lowed out and stuffed with meat or vegetable mixtures. Choose small, tender kohl￾rabi with fresh, green leaves.
Napa Cabbage
Napa cabbage, also known as Chinese cabbage, has a stout, elongated head 
with relatively tightly packed, firm, pale green leaves. It is moister and more 
tender than common green and red cabbages, with a milder, more delicate 
flavor. Napa cabbage may be eaten raw but is particularly well suited for stir￾frying or steaming. Choose Napa cabbage heads with crisp 
leaves that are free of blemishes.
Savoy Cabbage
Savoy cabbage has curly or ruffled leaves, often in variegated 
shades of green and purple. Savoy cabbage tends to be milder 
and more tender than regular cabbages and can be substituted 
for them, cooked or uncooked. Savoy leaves also make an attrac￾tive garnish. Savoy cabbage heads can be loose or tight depending 
on the variety. Choose heads with tender, unblemished leaves.

 Western eggplants 
 Fruit Vegetables 
 Botanists classify avocados, eggplants, peppers and tomatoes as fruits because they 
develop from the ovary of flowering plants and contain one or more seeds. Chefs, how￾ever, prepare and serve them like vegetables; therefore they are discussed here. 
 Avocados 
 Avocados include several varieties of pear-shaped fruits with rich, high-fat flesh. This light 
golden-green flesh surrounds a large, inedible, oval-shaped seed (pit). Some avocado vari￾eties such as Fuerte have smooth, green skin; others such as the Haas, the most prolific 
variety grown in the United States, have pebbly, almost black skin. Avocados should be 
used at their peak of ripeness, a condition that lasts only briefly. Firm avocados lack the 
desired flavor and creamy texture. Ripe avocados are soft to the touch but not mushy. Firm 
avocados can be left at room temperature to ripen and can be refrigerated for 1 or 2 days 
once they are ripe. Avocados are used raw to garnish salads, mashed or puréed for 
sauces, sliced for sandwiches or diced for omelets. Avocado halves are popular containers 
for chilled meat, fish, shellfish or poultry salads. Because avocado flesh turns brown very 
quickly once cut, dip avocado halves or slices in lemon juice and keep unused portions 
tightly covered with plastic wrap. Choose avocados that are free of blemishes or moist 
spots. The flesh should be free of dark spots or streaks. Avocados are available all year. 
 Hass avocados 
 Japanese eggplants 
➊ Cut the avocado in half lengthwise. 
separate the two halves with a twisting motion. 
➋ Insert a chef ’s knife into the pit and twist 
to remove. 
➌ scoop the flesh out of the skin with a 
large spoon. 
 Procedure for Cutting and Pitting Avocados 
 Indian eggplants 
 Eggplants 
 Two types of eggplants (Fr. aubergine ) are commonly 
available: Asian and western. Asian varieties, such as 
the long, thin Japanese eggplant, the tiny round 
Indian eggplant and the egg-shaped Thai 
eggplant, have skin colors of creamy white, 
green or deep purple. Western eggplants, 
also known as Italian eggplants, tend to be 
shaped like a plump pear with a shiny lavender 
to purple-black skin. 
 Both Asian and western types have a dense, 
khaki-colored flesh with a rather bland flavor 
that absorbs other flavors well during cooking. 
Eggplants can be grilled, baked, steamed, fried or 
sautéed. They are commonly used in Mediterranean, 
Thai and Indian cuisines, especially in vegetarian 
dishes. The skin may be left intact or removed before or 
M22_LABE1163_07_SE_C22.indd 622 03/11/23 5:55 PM Vegetables 623
after cooking as desired. Sliced eggplants may be salted and left to drain for 30 minutes 
to remove moisture and bitterness before cooking. (They will also absorb less oil when 
fried.) Choose plump, heavy eggplants with a smooth, shiny skin that is not blemished 
or wrinkled. Asian varieties tend to be softer than western.
Peppers
Members of the Capsicum family are native to the Americas. When encountered by 
Christopher Columbus, he called them “peppers” because of their sometimes-fiery flavor. 
These peppers, which include sweet peppers and hot peppers (chiles), are unrelated to 
peppercorns, the Asian spice for which Columbus was searching. Interestingly, peppers 
from the Americas were readily accepted in Indian and Asian cuisines, in which they are 
now considered staples.
Fresh peppers are found in a wide range of colors—green, red, yellow, orange, pur￾ple and white—as well as shapes, from tiny teardrops to cones to spheres. They have 
dense flesh and a hollow central cavity. Pepper flesh is lined with placental ribs (the 
white internal veins), to which tiny yellowish-white seeds are attached. A core of seeds 
is also attached to the stem end of each pepper.
Chile peppers get their heat from capsaicin, which is found not in the flesh or seeds 
but in the placental ribs. A pepper’s heat can be greatly reduced by carefully removing 
the ribs and attached seeds. Generally the smaller the chile, the hotter it is. The searing 
heat of a Scotch bonnet or habanero can burn. Wearing gloves is recommended when 
working with these hot peppers. The amount of heat varies from variety to variety, how￾ever, and even from one pepper to another depending on growing conditions. Hot, dry 
conditions result in hotter peppers than do cool, moist conditions. Choose peppers that 
are plump and brilliantly colored with smooth, unblemished skins. Avoid wrinkled, pit￾ted or blistered peppers. A bright green stem indicates freshness.
Sweet Peppers
Common sweet peppers, known as bell peppers, are thick-walled 
fruits available in green, red, yellow, purple, orange and other colors. 
They are heart-shaped or boxy, with a short stem and crisp flesh. 
Their flavor is warm, sweet (red peppers tend to be the sweetest) 
and relatively mild. Raw bell peppers may be sliced or diced and 
used in salads or sandwiches. Bell peppers can also be stuffed and 
baked, grilled, fried, sautéed or puréed for soups, sauces or condiments. Red and yellow bell peppers
green bell peppers
Procedure for Cutting Peppers Julienne
➊ trim off the ends of the pepper; cut away 
the seeds and core.
➋ Cut away the pale ribs, trimming the flesh 
to the desired thickness.
➌ slice the flesh in julienne.

Chile Pepper Pungency
a pepper’s heat can be measured by 
scoville heat units, a subjective rating 
created to measure the perception of 
capsaicin when tasting chile peppers. the 
higher the scoville rating, the larger the 
concentration of capsaicin and the hotter 
the pepper will taste. some of the ranges 
of heat of common chile peppers as 
measured in this system are listed here.

Procedure for Coring Jalapeños
Cut the jalapeño in half lengthwise. Push the core 
and seeds out with your thumb. You can avoid 
burning your fingers by wearing gloves when 
working with hot chiles.
Dried chiles are widely used in East Asian, Mexican, Central American and southwestern 
U.S. cuisines. They can be ground and used in a powdered spice blend called chilli or 
soaked in a liquid and then puréed for sauces or condiments. Drying radically alters the 
flavor of chiles, making them stronger and more pungent. Just as one type of fresh chile 
cannot be substituted for another without altering a dish’s flavor, dried chiles cannot be 
substituted without flavor changes. Choose dried chiles that are clean and unbroken, 
with some flexibility. Avoid any with white spots or a stale aroma.

Hot Peppers
Hot peppers, also known as chiles, are also 
members of the Capsicum family. Although a 
chile’s most characteristic attribute is its pun￾gency, each chile actually has a distinctive fla￾vor, from mild and rich to spicy and sweet to 
fiery hot. (And some such as the padrón and 
shishito can be either mild or hot depending 
on growing conditions.) Plant breeders continue 
to develop chile pepper varieties with increas￾ingly punishing heat.
Chiles are commonly used in Asian and Latin 
American cuisines. The larger (and milder) of the 
hot peppers, such as Anaheim and poblano, can 
be stuffed and baked 
or sautéed as a side 
dish. Most chiles, 
however, are used 
to add flavor and seasoning 
to sauces and other dishes. 
Chiles are available fresh and are 
also available canned in a variety 
of processed forms such as whole or 
diced, roasted, pickled or marinated.

A Pepper by Any 
Other Name
the popularity of southwestern cuisine, 
hot condiments and salsas has brought 
with it an appreciation and respect 
for chiles. Diners and chefs may find 
the names given to the various chiles 
confusing, however. Most chiles can be 
used either fresh or dried; drying changes 
not only the pepper’s flavor, but also its 
name. Regional variations in chile names 
also add to the confusion. several of the 
more frequently encountered chiles are 
listed here according to the names most 
commonly used for both their fresh and 
dried forms.

Heirloom tomato varieties
Tomatillos
Tomatillos, also known as Mexican or husk tomatoes, grow on small, weedy 
bushes. They are bright green, about the size of a small tomato and 
covered with a thin, papery husk. Tomatillos have a tart, lemony 
flavor and crisp, moist flesh. Although they are an important ingre￾dient in southwestern and northern Mexican cuisines, tomatil￾los may not be readily available in other areas. Tomatillos can 
be used raw in salads, puréed for salsa or cooked in soups, stews 
or vegetable dishes. Choose tomatillos with husks that are split but 
still look fresh. The skin should be plump, shiny and slightly sticky.
Tomatoes
Tomatoes (Fr. tomate or pomme d’amour; It. pomodoro) are available in a wide variety 
of colors and shapes. They vary from green (unripe) to golden yellow to ruby red; from 
tiny spheres (currant tomatoes) to huge, squat ovals (beefsteak). Some, such as the plum 
tomato, have lots of meaty flesh with only a few seeds; others, such as the slicing tomato, 
have lots of seeds and juice, but only a few meaty membranes. Heirloom varieties, such 
as Brandywine, German Green and Golden Queen, are irregularly shaped and may be 
prone to cracking. All tomatoes have a similar flavor, but the levels of sweetness and 
acidity vary depending on the species, growing conditions and ripeness at harvest. Ripe 
tomatoes are a natural source of glutamate and add umami flavor to foods.
Because tomatoes are highly perishable, they are usually harvested when mature but 
still green (unripe), then shipped to wholesalers who ripen them in temperature- and 
humidity-controlled rooms. The effect on flavor and texture is unfortunate. Tomatoes 
should be stored at room temperature to preserve their flavor and texture.
Tomatoes are used widely in salads, soups, sauces and baked dishes. Tomato concassée
is one common preparation of peeled, seeded and diced tomato used in 
many recipes. They are most often eaten raw but can be grilled, pickled, 
pan-fried, roasted or sautéed as a side dish. Choose fresh tomatoes that 
are plump with a smooth, shiny skin. The color should be uniform 
and true for the variety. Many canned tomato products are also avail￾able (e.g., purée, paste, sauce or stewed whole). Sun-dried and air￾dried tomatoes are available in crumbs, pieces, slivers or halves, 
dry or packed in oil. The dry-pack version can be soaked in oil or 
steeped in hot water to soften before use.
M22_LABE1163_07_SE_C22.indd 625 03/11/23 5:56 PMThree Treasures of the Americas
In lieu of spices, gold and gems, early spanish 
explorers returned from the americas with 
items of much greater significance: tomatoes, 
potatoes and corn.
the spanish and the Italians hailed the tomato 
(whose name comes from the aztec name 
tomatl) as an aphrodisiac—perhaps because of its 
resemblance to the human heart—when it arrived 
from the americas during the 16th century. but 
even though tomatoes soon became part of 
spanish and Italian cuisines, other europeans 
and, later, North american colonists considered 
tomatoes poisonous. (tomato vines and leaves 
do contain tomatine, an alkaloid that can cause 
health problems.) thus for many years only the 
adventurous ate tomatoes.
the potato, first delivered to europe from 
its native Peru in the 16th century, did not 
win wide acceptance until antoine-augustin 
Parmentier (1737–1813), a French army 
pharmacist, induced King louis XVI of France 
to try one. the king and his courtiers liked 
them so much they even began wearing 
potato blossom boutonnières. Parmentier 
was ultimately honored for his starchy 
contribution to French cuisine by having 
several potato dishes named for him, including 
potage Parmentier (potato soup). Not only 
did Parmentier lobby for the acceptance of 
the potato as a food fit for a king, he also 
prophesied that the potato would make 
starvation impossible. Potatoes ultimately 
did become a staple of many diets. but, sadly, 
over reliance on potatoes led to starvation 
during the Irish potato famine of 1846–1848, 
when a blight destroyed the Irish potato crop. 
Nearly 1.5 million people died, and an equal 
number emigrated to the United states. they 
brought with them a cuisine that incorporated 
potatoes, and an appreciation of the common 
potato was reintroduced to its native land.
When returning from his second voyage to 
the americas, Columbus took corn with him. 
Called mahiz or maize, corn had been a staple 
of Central american diets for at least 5000 
years. although europeans did not actively 
shun corn as they did tomatoes and potatoes, 
corn never really caught on in most of europe. 
grown for human consumption mostly in 
Italy, spain and southwestern France, most 
corn was and still is usually eaten ground and 
boiled as polenta. Despite the unenthusiastic 
european reception, corn’s popularity quickly 
spread: Within 50 years of Columbus’s 
journey, corn was being cultivated in lands as 
distant from the americas as China, India and 
sub-saharan africa.
Procedure for Preparing Tomato Concassée
tomato concassée is peeled, seeded and diced tomato.
➊ With a paring knife, cut an X on the bottom 
of the tomatoes to penetrate the skin.
➋ blanch the tomatoes in boiling water for 
20 seconds; refresh in ice water.
➌ Cut out the cores and peel the tomatoes 
using a paring knife.
➍ Cut the tomatoes in half horizontally and 
squeeze out the seeds and juice.
➎ Chop or dice the tomatoes as desired for 
the recipe.

left: Kirby for pickling, english 
hothouse and green cucumbers
Procedure for Seeding a Cucumber
Remove the seeds from a cucumber by slicing it in 
half lengthwise, then scrape out the seeds with a 
spoon or melon ball cutter.
 Gourds and Squashes
The Cucurbitaceae or gourd family includes almost 750 species; its mem￾bers are found in warm regions worldwide. Gourds are characterized by 
large, complex root systems with quick-growing, trailing vines and large 
leaves. Their flowers are often attractive and edible. Although some members 
of the gourd family originated in Africa, most squashes are native to the 
Americas.
Cucumbers
Cucumbers can be divided into two categories: pickling and slic￾ing. The two types are not interchangeable. Cucumbers are valued 
for their refreshing cool taste and astringency. Slicing cucumbers are usually 
served raw, in salads or mixed with yogurt and dill or mint as a side dish, espe￾cially for spicy dishes. Pickling cucumbers are generally served pickled, with no 
further processing. Pickling cucumbers include the cornichon, Kirby and gherkin. 
They are recognizable by their sharp black or white spines and are quite bitter when 
raw. Slicing cucumbers include the burpless, the seedless English (or hothouse), the 
seedless Persian cucumber (which is small and smooth-skinned), the lemon (which 
is round and yellow) and the common green market 
cucumber. Most cucumber varieties have relatively thin 
skins and may be marketed with a wax coating to pre￾vent moisture loss and improve appearance. Waxed skins 
should be peeled unless the cucumbers will be pickled. 
Choose cucumbers that are firm but not hard. Avoid those that 
are limp or yellowed or have soft spots.

Squashes
Squashes are the fleshy fruits of a large number of plants in 
the gourd family. Many varieties are available in a range of 
colors, shapes and sizes. Squashes are classified as winter 
or summer based on their peak season and skin type. All 
squashes have a center cavity filled with many seeds, 
although in winter varieties the cavity is more 
pronounced. Squash blossoms are also edible; 
blossoms may be added to salads raw, dipped 
in batter and deep-fried or filled with cheese or 
meat and baked. Choose squashes with unbroken 
skins and good color for the variety. Avoid any with 
soft, moist spots.
Use a zester or fork to score the rind of a 
cucumber before slicing.

Winter squashes include acorn, butternut, Hubbard, pumpkin, 
Japanese kabocha and spaghetti varieties. They have hard skins (shells) 
and seeds, neither of which is generally eaten. The flesh, which may be 
removed from the shell before or after cook￾ing, tends to be sweeter and more strongly 
flavored than that of summer squashes. 
Winter squashes are rarely eaten raw; 
they can be baked, 
steamed or sautéed and 
some varieties are pop￾ular fried tempura-style. 
Most winter squashes 
can also be puréed for 
soups or pie fillings. 
Summer squashes include pattypan, yellow crookneck and 
zucchini varieties. They have soft, edible skins and seeds that 
are generally not removed before cooking. Most summer squashes 
may be eaten raw but are also suitable for grilling, sautéing, steaming 
or baking. 
 Greens 
 The term greens refers to a variety of leafy green vegetables that may be served raw 
but are usually cooked. Greens have long been used in the cuisines of Asia and the 
Mediterranean and are an important part of regional cuisine in the southern United 
States. Most greens have strong, spicy flavors. Milder varieties are almost always eaten 
raw and include the lettuces discussed in Chapter 24 , Salads and Salad Dressings . 
 Greens have an extremely high water content, which means that cooking causes dras￾tic shrinkage. As a general rule, allow 8 ounces (240 grams) per portion before cooking. 
Choose young, tender greens that have good color and are not limp. Avoid greens with 
dry-looking stems or yellow leaves. 
 Collard Greens 
 Collard greens, often simply referred to as collards, are a type of wild cabbage with 
loose, leafy heads of bright green leaves. Collards have a sharp, tangy flavor and look 
like a cross between mustard greens and kale. Considered a staple ingredient in cooking 
of the American South, collards are typically slow-simmered with ham hocks or bacon 
until very tender, then served with their cooking liquid. Collards are high in iron and 
vitamins A and C and are best if picked young or after the first frost of autumn. 
 Mustard Greens 
 Mustard, a member of the cabbage family, was brought to America by early European 
immigrants. Mustard has large, dark green leaves with frilly edges and is known for its 
assertive, bitter flavor. Mustard greens can be served raw in salads or used as garnish. 
They can also be cooked, often with white wine, vinegar and herbs. Choose crisp, bright 
green leaves without discoloration. 
 Sorrel 
 Sorrel is a wild member of the buckwheat family. Its 
tartness and sour flavor are used in soups and 
sauces and to accent other vegetables. It is 
particularly good with fatty fish or rich meats. 
Sorrel leaves naturally become the texture of a 
purée after only a few minutes of moist-heat cook￾ing. Choose sorrel leaves that are fully formed, with no 
yellow blemishes.

Spinach
Spinach (Fr. épinard) is a versatile green that grows rapidly in cool climates. It has 
smooth, bright green leaves attached to thin stems. Spinach may be eaten raw in salads, 
cooked by almost any moist-heat method, microwaved or sautéed. It can be used in 
stuffings, baked or creamed dishes, soups or stews. Spinach grows in sandy soil and 
must be rinsed repeatedly in cold water to remove all traces of grit from the leaves. It 
bruises easily and should be handled gently during washing. Stems and large midribs 
should be removed. Choose bunches with crisp, tender, deep green leaves; avoid yellow 
leaves or those with blemishes.
Swiss Chard
Chard—the reference to “Swiss” is inexplicable—is a type of 
beet that does not produce a tuberous root. The wide, flat, 
dark green leaves are consumed. (Golden-, orange- and pink￾stemmed varieties are also available.) Chard can be steamed, 
sautéed or used in soups. Chard’s tart, spinachlike flavor blends 
well with sweet ingredients such as fruit. Choose chard leaves that 
are crisp, with some curliness. Ribs should be unblemished and uni￾form in color.
Turnip Greens
The leaves of the turnip root have a pleasantly bitter flavor, similar to peppery mustard 
greens. The dark green turnip leaves are long, slender and deeply indented. Turnip 
greens are best eaten steamed, sautéed, baked or microwaved.
Water Spinach
Water spinach, also known as morning glory, ong 
choy and pak boong, is a semi-aquatic plant with 
the flavor of spinach but with long, hollow stems 
and narrow, pointed leaves, both of which are 
typically stir-fried either alone or with other 
vegetables. The highly nutritious leaves are 
also served raw in salads. Popular through￾out East and South Asia, especially in China’s 
Cantonese cuisine, it flourishes in the wild and is 
considered an invasive species in the United States.
Mushrooms and Truffles
Mushrooms and truffles are fungi, which have no seeds, stems 
or flowers; they reproduce through microscopic spores. 
Cultivated mushrooms are grown above ground on a 
moist substrate of wood, wood chips, straw or sawdust. 
In the wild, mushrooms are often found growing around 
trees or on decaying fallen trees and limbs, where the 
fungal spores sprout from the soil. Mushrooms do not need 
light; they grow best in dark, cool, humid conditions. 
Mushrooms are valuable for the nutrition they offer; they 
are high in certain vitamins, low in calories and contain 
no fat. Some varieties of mushrooms have a meaty texture that makes them popular in 
vegetarian dishes or as a meat substitute.
Truffles are a variety of fungus that grows like a tuber attached to tree roots just 
below ground. Truffles have a strong preference for the chalky soil around oak, hazel￾nut and beech trees. They can only be cultivated by planting groves of such trees and 
waiting, sometimes for many years. Once a grove becomes productive, truffles will

Oyster mushrooms
appear annually, but to be harvested they must be located and rooted 
out by animals (originally pigs, but trained dogs are now preferred) 
that are attracted to the fungus’ distinctive aroma.
Mushrooms
Mushrooms (Fr. champignons; It. funghi) have a stalk with 
an umbrellalike top. Although not actually a vegetable, 
mushrooms are used and served in much the same man￾ner as vegetables.
Several types of cultivated mushroom are available. 
They include the common (or white), shiitake, cremini 
(also known as the Italian brown), beech, straw, enoki￾dake (also called enoki), king oyster, and cloud ear (also known as 
wood ear). Button mushrooms are the smallest, most immature form 
of the common mushroom. The largest cultivated mush￾room is the portabella, an overgrown cremini that can be 
up to 6 inches (15 centimeters) in diameter.
Many wild mushrooms are gathered and sold by 
specialty purveyors. Because wild mushroom spores are 
spread around the world by air currents, the same item may 
be found in several areas, each with a different common name. Wild 
mushrooms have a stronger earthy or nutty flavor than culti￾vated mushrooms and should be cooked before eating.
Mushrooms, whether cultivated or gathered from the 
wild, are available fresh, canned or dried. Because mushrooms are composed of 
up to 80 percent water, dried products are often the most economical, even though 
they may cost hundreds of dollars per pound. Dried mushrooms can be stored in 
a cool, dry place for months. When needed, they are rehydrated by soaking in a 
warm liquid until soft, approximately 10–20 minutes. Dried mushrooms can also 
be ground into a flavoring powder that is added to sauces, soups and stews during 
cooking.
Choose fresh mushrooms that are clean and without soft or moist spots or blemishes. 
Cultivated mushrooms with exposed gills (the ridges on the underside of the umbrel￾lalike top) are old and should be avoided. Fresh mushrooms can be refrigerated in an 
open container for up to 5 days. Normally it is not necessary to peel mushrooms; if they 
are dirty, they should be quickly rinsed (not soaked) in cool water just before use. Peel 
mushrooms when the skin is discolored or when a more uniform color is desired.

 Safety Alert
Mushroom Safety
some mushrooms are deadly; others 
can cause severe illness. Picking edible 
mushrooms in the wild is not simply 
a process of comparing specimens 
with photographs or illustrations in a 
guidebook. Do not gather mushrooms 
from the wild unless you are accompanied 
by a well-trained, experienced mycologist 
or guide. always purchase wild 
mushrooms from reputable purveyors.
Procedure for Fluting Mushrooms
Use the sharp edge of a straight paring knife to 
cut thin curves into the mushroom cap. Fluted 
mushrooms may be baked or poached, then 
used as garnish.

White onions
Truffles
Two principal varieties of European truffles are the Périgord (black) and the Piedmontese 
(white). Fresh truffles are gathered in the fall and should be used promptly. Truffles 
have a strong aroma, requiring only a small amount to add their special flavor to soups, 
sauces, pasta and other items. Black truffles are often used as a garnish or to flavor pâtés, 
terrines or egg dishes. Because fresh truffles can cost hundreds of dollars per pound, 
most kitchens purchase truffles canned, dried or processed. Avoid imitation truffles as 
the flavor and aroma is inferior. True truffles are never inexpensive.
Onions
Onions are strongly flavored, aromatic members of the lily family. Most have edible 
grasslike or tubular leaves. Almost every culture incorporates onions into its cuisine as a 
vegetable and for flavoring.
Bulb Onions
Common or bulb onions (Fr. oignons) may be white, yellow (Bermuda or Spanish) or 
red (purple). Medium-sized yellow and white onions are the most strongly flavored. 
Larger onions tend to be sweeter and milder. Indispensable in mirepoix, onions are also 
prepared as side dishes by deep-frying, roasting, grilling, steaming or boiling.
 Pearl onions are small, about ½ inch (1.25 centimeters) in diam￾eter, with yellow or white skins. They have a mild flavor and can 
be grilled, boiled, roasted or sautéed whole as a side dish or 
used in soups or stews. Cipollini, Italian for small onions, are a 
small, slightly flat, mild bulb onion variety that can be pickled, 
roasted or stewed.
Sweet onion varieties include the Vidalia, Maui, Walla Walla 
and Texas 1015 SuperSweet. Sweet bulb onions have a higher 
water content, more sugar and less sulfuric compounds than 
other onions. They are best for eating raw, making them good choices 
for sandwiches, salads, hamburgers and the like. Cooking destroys much of the 
perceived sweetness and special flavor. All sweet onions have a very short shelf life 
and should not be stored more than a few weeks.
 Choose onions that are firm and dry and feel heavy. The outer skins should be 
dry and brittle. Avoid onions that have begun to sprout. Store onions in a cool, dry, 
 well-ventilated area. Do not refrigerate onions until they are cut.
Garlic
Like onions, garlic (Fr. ail; It. aglio; Sp. ajo) is used in almost all the world’s cuisines. 
A head or bulb of garlic is composed of many small cloves. The entire head is encased in 
several thin layers of papery husk; each clove is wrapped in a thin husk or peel. Of the 
300 or so types of garlic known, only three are commercially significant. The most com￾mon is pure white, with a sharp flavor. A Mexican variety is pale pink and more strongly 
flavored. Elephant garlic is apple-sized and particularly mild.
Although whole heads of fresh garlic can be baked or roasted, garlic is most often 
separated into cloves, peeled, sliced, minced or crushed and used to flavor a wide 
variety of dishes. When using garlic, remember that the more finely the cloves are 
crushed, the stronger the flavor is. Cooking reduces garlic’s pungency; the longer garlic 
is cooked, the milder it becomes. (Allicin, responsible for raw garlic’s pungent flavor, 
is associated with cardiovascular health benefits that may be reduced when garlic is 
cooked.) Choose firm, dry garlic bulbs with tightly closed cloves and smooth skins. 
Avoid bulbs with green sprouts. Store fresh garlic in a cool, well-ventilated place; do 
not refrigerate.
Black garlic is made by fermenting heads of fresh, unpeeled common white garlic 
for weeks in controlled, hot, humid conditions. Aged this way, the cloves turn black

and develop a complex, sweet, smoky flavor and a soft, chewy texture. Black garlic 
cloves can be puréed and used raw or cooked to add umami to sauces and dress￾ings. Black garlic powder is also available. Used in the cuisines of Northeast Asia and 
Thailand for hundreds of years, black garlic is also excellent with lamb, creamy sauces, 
cheeses and pizza.
Leeks
Leeks (Fr. poireaux) look like large, overgrown scallions with a fat white tip and wide 
green leaves. Their flavor is sweeter and stronger than scallions but milder than common 
bulb onions. Leeks must be carefully washed to remove the sandy soil that gets between 
the leaves. Leeks can be baked, braised or grilled as a side dish or used to season stocks, 
soups or sauces. Choose leeks that are firm, with stiff roots and stems. Avoid those with 
dry leaves, soft spots or browning.
Procedure for Cleaning Leeks
➊ trim the root end from the leek. ➋ Cut away the dark green top and slice the 
white portion in half lengthwise.
➌ Rinse the cut leek thoroughly 
under running water to remove soil.
The Olive
Olives (Olea europaea) are the fruit of a tree 
native to the Mediterranean area. green olives 
are harvested unripened; black olives are fully 
ripened. the fruit is inedibly bitter and must 
be washed, soaked and cured or pickled before 
eating. green olives should have a smooth, 
tight skin. Ripe olives are glossy but softer, with 
a slightly wrinkled skin. Many varieties and 
flavors of olives are available, from the tiny 
black French Niçoise to the large purplish greek 
Kalamata. black olives are packaged in a range 
of seven sizes, from small to supercolossal. 
green olives are available in 11 sizes, from 
subpetite to supercolossal. both black and 
green olives are available whole (with the pit), 
pitted, sliced, halved or in pieces. Pitted green 
olives are often stuffed with strips of pimento, 
jalapeño pepper, almonds or other foods for 
flavor and appearance.
Olives are served as a finger food for snacks 
or hors d’oeuvre or are added to salads, pastas, 
breads, soups, sauces, stews and casseroles. 
a paste made of minced ripe olives, known as 
tapenade, is used as a dip or condiment.

Negi
Scallions
Scallions, also known as green onions or bunch onions, are the immature green 
stalks of bulb onions. The leaves are bright green with either a long and 
slender or slightly bulbous white base. Scallions are used in stir-fries 
and as a flavoring in other dishes. The green tops can also be sliced 
in small rings and used as a garnish. Choose scallions with bright 
green tops and clean white bulbs. Avoid those with limp or 
slimy leaves.
Negi is a type of green onion with a longer 
white portion and hollow green stems. Popular 
in Japanese cuisine, their thicker texture and 
savory flavor makes them suitable for cooking in 
broths, sautéing and grilling.
Spring onions, also known as Mexican green onions, have oval to round bulbs in 
stark white to reddish hues and deep green stems. With a crisp texture and a sweet, mel￾low flavor, they are used raw or cooked and are excellent for grilling whole.
Shallots
Shallots (Fr. échalotes) are shaped like small bulb onions with one flat side. When peeled, 
a shallot separates into multiple cloves, similar to garlic. Shallots have a mild yet rich and 
complex flavor. Shallots are the basis of many classic sauces and meat preparations; they 
can also be sautéed or baked as a side dish. Choose shallots that are plump, symmetrical 
and heavy for their size. Avoid those that appear dry or have sprouted. Store shallots in 
a cool, dry, unrefrigerated place.
Pods and Seeds
Pod and seed vegetables include corn, legumes and okra. We group them together 
here because the parts consumed are the seeds of their respective plants. In some 
cases only the seeds are eaten; in others the pod containing the seeds is eaten as well. 
Seeds are generally higher in protein and carbohydrates (starch and dietary fiber) than

Sweet corn (Fr. maïs; Sp. maíz) is a grain, a type of grass. Corn kernels, like peas, 
are plant seeds. (Dried corn products are discussed in Chapter 23, Potatoes, Grains 
and Pasta.) Corn kernels, which may be white or yellow, are attached to a woody, 
inedible cob. The cob is encased by strands of hairlike fibers called silks and covered 
in layers of thin leaves called husks. Shuck the ears (remove the silks and husks) 
before cooking; the husks may be left on for roasting or grilling, however. Shucked 
corn on the cob can be grilled, boiled, microwaved or steamed. The kernels can be 
cut off the cob before or after cooking. Corn on the cob is available fresh or frozen; 
corn kernels are available canned or frozen. Choose freshly picked ears with firm, 
small kernels. Avoid those with mold or decay at the tip of the cob or brownish silks. 
Seek out the freshest corn on the cob and serve it promptly because its sugar turns 
to starch once it is picked.

Legumes
Beans (Fr. haricots; It. fagioli) and peas (Fr. pois) are members of the legume family, a 
large group of vegetables with double-seamed pods containing a single row of seeds. 
Of the hundreds of varieties of beans, some are used for their edible pods, others are 
removed from the pod fresh and some are used for their dried seeds. Dried beans are 
seeds or peas left in the pod until mature, then shelled and dried.
Fresh Beans
Beans with edible pods, commonly referred to as green beans, 
string beans, runner beans or snap beans, are picked when 
immature. Except for the stem, the entire pod can be eaten. 
This category includes the American green bean, the yel￾low wax bean, the broad bean and the French haricot 
vert, a long, slender pod with an intense flavor and ten￾der texture. Any strings along the pod’s seams should 
be pulled off before cooking. Beans may be left whole, cut 
lengthwise into thin slivers (referred to as French cut) or cut crosswise 
on the diagonal.
Shelling beans are grown primarily for the edible seeds inside the pod. Common 
examples are flageolets, lima beans and fava (broad) beans. Their tough pods 
are not usually eaten.
All fresh beans can be prepared by steaming, microwaving or sautéing. 
They can be added to soups or stews, and they blend well with a variety of fla￾vors, from coconut milk to garlic and olive oil. Cooked beans can be chilled and 
served as a salad or crudité. Choose fresh beans that have a bright color without 
brown or soft spots. Large pods may be tough or bitter. Most fresh bean varieties are 
available frozen or canned, including pickled and seasoned products.
Dried Beans
For thousands of years, cultures around the world have preserved certain 
legumes by drying. Common dried beans include kidney beans, pinto 
beans, chickpeas, lentils, black beans, black-eyed peas and split 
green peas. Shape is the clearest distinction among these products: 
Beans are oval or kidney-shaped; lentils are small, flat disks; peas 
are round.
Beans and peas destined for drying are left on the 
vine until they are fully matured and just beginning to dry. 
They are then harvested, shelled and quickly dried with 
warm air currents. Some dried legumes are sold split, which

means the skin is removed, causing the seed’s two halves to 
separate.
Most dried beans need to be soaked in water before cooking. 
Soaking softens and rehydrates the beans, thus reducing cook￾ing time. Lentils and split peas generally do not require soaking, 
however, and cook faster than dried beans. After soaking, dried 
beans are most often simmered or baked in a liquid until soft and 
tender. Most types of dried beans may be substituted for one another 
in most recipes, although variations in color, starch content and flavor should be 
considered.
Dried beans and peas are available in bulk or in 1-pound (450-gram) poly bags. 
They should be stored in a cool, dry place but not refrigerated. Many types of dried 
beans are also available fully cooked, then canned or frozen. Some dried beans are 
fermented or processed into flour, oil, bean curd or sauce.

Procedure for Soaking Dried Beans
1 Pick through the dried beans and remove any grit, pebbles or debris.
2 Place the beans in a bowl and cover with cold water; remove any skins or other items that 
float to the surface.
3 Drain the beans in a colander, then rinse under cold running water.
4 Return the beans to a bowl and cover with fresh cold water. allow approximately 3 cups 
(720 milliliters) water for each cup of beans.
5 soak the beans in the cold water for the time specified in the recipe, usually several hours or 
overnight. Drain through a colander, discarding the water.
Procedure for Quick-Soaking Dried Beans
the soaking procedure can be accelerated by the following technique:
1 Rinse and pick through the beans.
2 Place the beans in a saucepan and add enough cool water to cover them by 2 inches 
(5 centimeters).
3 bring to a boil and simmer for 2 minutes.
4 Remove from the heat, cover and soak for 1 hour.
5 Drain and discard the soaking liquid. Proceed with the recipe.
Fresh Shelling Peas
Of the shelling peas that are prepared fresh, the most common are green garden 
peas (English peas) and the French petit pois. Because they lose flavor rapidly after 
harvest, most shelling peas are sold frozen or canned. Shelling peas have a delicate, 
sweet flavor best presented by simply steaming until tender without overcooking. 
Peas may also be braised with rich meats such as ham or used in soups. Cooked 
peas are attractive in salads or as garnish. Choose small fresh pea pods that are 
plump and moist.
Fresh green soybeans (soya) (Ja. edamame) are a type of shelling pea picked 
before maturity. Fresh soybeans have a light green, fuzzy pod and a tender, sweet pea. 
They are steamed in the pod, then popped open and eaten out of hand as a snack 
and are often served this way in sushi restaurants. When allowed to mature and then 
prepared like other dried beans, however, soybeans become extremely tough, hard to 
digest and bitter. Mature soybeans are best used for processing into oil, tofu, soy sauce 
and other foodstuffs.

Okra
Edible Pea Pods
Snow peas, also known as Chinese pea pods, are a common variety of edible pea pod. 
They are flat with only a few very small green peas. Snow peas have a string along their 
seams that can be removed by holding the leafy stem and pulling from end to end. 
Edible pea pods can be served raw, lightly blanched or steamed, or stir-fried.
snow peas
Pea shoots
Use a paring knife to grab the leafy stem and then 
pull the string from snow peas.
Procedure for Preparing Snow Peas
Another variety of edible pea pod is the sugar snap pea, a cross between the garden 
pea and snow pea. Sugar snap peas are plump, juicy pods filled with small, tender peas. 
The entire pod is eaten; do not shell the peas before cooking. Choose pea pods that are 
firm, bright green and crisp. Avoid those with brown spots or a shriveled appearance.
Pea shoots are the delicate tendrils that form before the plant bears pods. In Chinese 
cuisine, the shoots are harvested and stir-fried like spinach or other leafy greens. Tendrils 
are also used raw as a garnish.
Okra
Okra, a common ingredient in African and Arab cuisines, was brought to the United 
States by enslaved Africans and by French settlers. It is now integral to Creole, 
Cajun, southern and southwestern cuisines. Its mild flavor is similar 
to asparagus. Okra is not eaten raw; it is best pick￾led, boiled, steamed or deep-fried. Okra develops a 
gelatinous texture when cooked for long periods, so 
it is used to thicken gumbos and stews. To avoid the 
slimy texture that some people find objectionable, do 
not wash okra until ready to cook, then trim the stem 
end only. Cook okra in stainless steel because other 
metals cause discoloration. Choose small to medium 
pods (1½–2 inches/3.75–5 centimeters) that are deep 
green, without soft spots. Pale spears with stiff tips tend to 
be tough. Frozen okra is widely available.
Roots and Tubers
Taproots (more commonly referred to as roots) are single roots that extend deep into the 
soil to supply the plant with nutrients. Tubers are fat underground stems. Most roots and 
tubers can be used interchangeably. All store well at cool temperatures, without refrigeration. 
Potatoes, the most popular tuber, are discussed in Chapter 23, Potatoes, Grains and Pasta.

Beets
Although history suggests that they were first eaten in ancient Greece, beets are associated 
with cold northern climates, where they grow most of the year. Both the beet root and the 
green leaves are eaten. Common beets have a deep reddish-purple flesh and are cooked by 
boiling, steaming or roasting; the last two cooking methods preserve more of their health￾ful compounds. Cooked beets are then peeled and used in soups, salads or as a side dish. 
Pickling is a traditional preservation method still used for beets. Golden beets have orange, 
yellow or variegated flesh and are prepared in the 
same manner. Beet leaves, called greens, are high 
in vitamins, potassium and iron. Beet greens can 
be cooked by boiling, sautéing or slow simmer￾ing. Choose medium-sized beets that are firm, 
with smooth skins. Avoid 
beets with hairy root tips, 
as they may be tough. Small and baby￾sized beets are often used for garnish 
or in salads.
Carrots
Carrots (Fr. carottes), among the most versatile of vege￾tables, are large taproots. Although several kinds of carrots 
exist, the Imperator is the most common. It is long and pointed, 
with a medium to dark orange color and a mild, sweet flavor. Carrots 
can be cut into a variety of shapes and eaten raw, used in mirepoix 
or prepared by moist-heat cooking methods, grilling, microwaving or 
roasting. They are also grated raw and used in baked goods, particularly 
cakes and muffins. Choose firm carrots that are smooth and well-shaped, with a 
bright orange color. If the tops are still attached, they should be fresh-looking and 
bright green.
Celery Root
Celery root, also known as celeriac, is a large, round root, long popular in northern 
European cuisines. It is a different plant from stalk celery, and its stalks and leaves 
are not eaten. Celery root has a knobby brown exterior; a creamy 
white, crunchy flesh; and a mild, celerylike flavor. Its 
thick outer skin must be peeled off; the flesh is then 
cut as desired. Often eaten raw, celery root can also 
be baked, steamed or boiled. It is used in soups, 
stews or salads and goes well with game and rich 
meats. Place raw celery root in acidulated water 
to prevent browning. Choose small to medium-sized 
celery roots that are firm and relatively clean, with a 
pungent smell.
Jicama
Jicama is a legume that grows underground as a tuber. 
Jicama is popular because of its sweet, moist flavor; crisp 
texture; low calorie content and long shelf life. After its 
thick brown skin is peeled off, the crisp, moist white 
flesh can be cut as desired. Jicama is often eaten raw 
in salads, with salsa or as a crudité. It is also used in 
stir-fried dishes. Choose firm, well-shaped jicamas 
that are free of blemishes. Size is not an indication 
of quality or maturity.

Parsnips
Parsnips
Parsnips (Fr. panais) are taproots that look and taste like white carrots and have the tex￾ture of sweet potatoes. Parsnips should be 5–10 inches (12.5–25 centimeters) in length, 
with smooth skins and tapering tips. Parsnips, peeled like carrots, can be eaten raw or 
cooked by almost any method. When steamed until very soft, they can be mashed like 
potatoes. Choose small to medium-sized parsnips that are firm, smooth and well-shaped; 
avoid large, woody ones.
Radishes
Radishes (Fr. radis) have a peppery flavor and crisp tex￾ture. Radishes are available in many colors, includ￾ing white, black and all shades of red; most have a 
creamy to pure white interior. Asian radishes, known as 
daikons, produce roots 2–4 inches (5–10 centimeters) 
in diameter and 6–20 inches (15–20 centimeters) 
long. Radishes can be braised, steamed or stir-fried 
but most often are eaten raw or in salads or used as 
garnish. Radish leaves can be used in salads or cooked 
as greens. Choose radishes that are firm, not limp. Their 
interior should not be dry or hollow.
Rutabagas
Rutabagas are a root vegetable and a member of the cabbage 
family. Their skin is purple to yellow, and their flesh 
is yellow with a distinctive starchy, cabbage-like fla￾vor. Rutabagas and turnips are similar in flavor and 
texture when cooked and may be used interchange￾ably. Rutabaga leaves are not eaten. Peel rutabagas 
with a vegetable peeler or chef’s knife, then cut into 
quarters, slices or cubes. They are often baked, boiled 
and then puréed, or sliced and sautéed. Rutabagas are 
especially flavorful when seasoned with caraway seeds, dill or 
lemon juice. Choose small to medium-sized rutabagas that are smooth and firm and 
feel heavy.
Sunchokes
Sunchokes, which is a marketing term for Jerusalem artichokes, are tubers from a variety 
of sunflower unrelated to artichokes. Their lumpy brown skin is usually peeled off (even 
though the skin is edible) to reveal a crisp, white interior with a slightly nutty flavor. 
Although they may be eaten raw, cooking them before serving makes them easier to 
digest. Jerusalem artichokes are eaten chopped or grated into salads or boiled, roasted or 
steamed for a side dish or soup.
Taro Root
The starchy root of the taro plant is a dietary staple in India, Southeast Asia, the 
Caribbean, parts of Africa, and Hawaii. Poisonous when raw, taro is perfectly safe once 
cooked. Even peeling it can cause skin irritation from the oxalic acid present. Wear 
gloves when working with raw taro and use a sharp knife or y-shaped peeler. Small 
pieces can be boiled first, then peeled, which reduces the risk of injury. Cooked taro 
is used in much the same way as potatoes, although its texture is best fried or baked. 
Smaller varieties of taro have a sweet nutty flavor and light purple color so the purée is 
popular in pastries, bread and custards.

Turnips
Also a root vegetable from the cabbage family, turnips have white skin with a rosy-red 
or purple blush and a white interior. Their flavor, similar to that of a radish, can be 
rather hot. Turnips should be peeled, then diced, sliced or julienned for cooking. They 
may be baked or cooked with moist-heat cooking methods and are often puréed like 
potatoes. Choose small to medium-sized turnips that have smooth skin and feel heavy. 
They should be firm, not rubbery or limp. Any attached leaves should be bright green 
and tender.
Water Chestnuts
Water chestnuts are the tuber of an Asian plant that thrives in water. The brownish-black 
skin is peeled away to reveal a moist, crisp, white interior, which can be eaten raw or 
cooked. When cooked, water chestnuts retain their crunchy texture, making them a pop￾ular addition to stir-fried dishes. They are also used in salads and casseroles or wrapped 
in bacon for hors d’oeuvre.
Stalk Vegetables
Stalk vegetables are plant stems with a high percentage of cellulose, a type of insoluble 
dietary fiber. These vegetables should be picked while still young and tender, and any 
tough outer layers or peel should be removed or trimmed before cooking.
Artichokes
Artichokes (Fr. artichauts) are the immature flowers of a thistle plant introduced to 
America by Italian and Spanish settlers. Young, tender artichokes can be cooked whole, 
but more mature plants need to have the fuzzy center (known as the choke) removed 
first. Whole artichokes can be simmered, steamed or microwaved; they are often served 
with lemon juice, garlic butter or hollandaise sauce. The heart may be cooked separately, 
then served in salads, puréed as a filling or served as a side dish. Place raw trimmed 
artichokes in acidulated water to prevent browning. Choose fresh artichokes with tight, 
compact heads that feel heavy. Their color should be solid green to gray-green. Brown 
spots on the surface caused by frost are harmless. Artichoke hearts and leafless artichoke 
bottoms are both available canned.

Asparagus
Asparagus (Fr. aspèrges), a member of the lily family, has bright green spears with a ruf￾fle of tiny leaves at the tip. Larger spears tend to be tough and woody but can be used 
in soups or for purée. Asparagus is eaten raw or steamed briefly, stir-fried, microwaved 
or grilled. Fresh spring asparagus is excellent with nothing more than lemon juice or 
clarified butter; asparagus with hollandaise sauce is a classic preparation.
Choose firm, plump spears with tightly closed tips and a bright green color run￾ning the full length of the spear. Asparagus should be stored refrigerated at 40°F (4°C), 
upright in ½ inch (1.25 centimeters) of water or with the ends wrapped in moist paper 
towels. The stalks should not be washed until just before use. Canned and frozen aspara￾gus are also available.
A European variety of white asparagus is sometimes available fresh or readily available 
canned. White asparagus has a milder flavor and a soft, tender texture. It is produced by 
covering the asparagus stalks with soil as they grow; this prevents sunlight from reaching 
the plant and retards the development of chlorophyll, the green-colored natural chemical 
that plants produce. asparagus

Bamboo Shoots
Stripped of their tough brown outer skins, the tender young

shoots make excellent additions to stir-fried dishes, 
or they can be served like asparagus. Although 
fresh shoots are available in Asia, canned peeled 
shoots packed in brine or water are more com￾mon in the United States. Canned shoots should be 
rinsed well before use.
Celery
Once a medicinal herb, stalk celery (Fr. céleri) is now a common sight in kitchens world￾wide. Stalk celery is pale green with stringy curved stalks. Often eaten raw in salads or 
as a snack, celery can be braised or steamed as a side dish. Celery is also a mirepoix 
component. Choose stalks that are crisp, without any sign of dryness.
Procedure for Peeling Celery
 Use a paring knife to grasp strings from the 
outside of a piece of celery, and then gently pull 
them away.

Fennel
Fennel
Fennel (Fr. fenouil, It. finocchio) is a Mediterranean favorite used for 
thousands of years as a vegetable (the bulb), an herb (the leaves) and 
a spice (the seeds). The fennel bulb (often incorrectly referred to as 
sweet anise) has short, tight, overlapping celerylike stalks with feath￾ery leaves. The flavor is similar to that of anise or licorice, becoming 
milder when cooked. Fennel bulbs may be eaten raw or grilled, steamed, 
sautéed, baked or microwaved. Choose a fairly 
large, bright white bulb on which the cut edges 
appear fresh, without dryness or brown￾ing. The bulb should be compact, not 
spreading.
Baby Vegetables
Many restaurants serve baby vegetables: tiny turnips, 
finger-length squashes, miniature carrots and petite 
heads of cauliflower. Baby vegetables include both 
hybrids bred to be true miniatures as well as regular 
varieties picked before maturity. Baby vegetables 
are often marketed with blossoms or greens still 
attached. They tend to be easily bruised 
and are highly perishable. Many baby 
vegetables can be eaten raw, but they 
are usually left whole, then steamed 
or lightly sautéed and attractively pre￾sented as an accompaniment to meat, 
fish or poultry entrées.
NUTRITIONAL INFORMATION FOR VEGETABLES
Most vegetables are more than 80 percent water; the remaining portions consist of car￾bohydrates (primarily starches) and small amounts of protein and fat. The relative lack of 
protein and fat makes most vegetables especially low in calories.
Much of a vegetable’s physical structure is provided by generally indigestible substances, 
specifically two types of dietary fiber: cellulose and lignin. The dietary fiber in vegetables 
produces the characteristic stringy, crisp or fibrous textures associated with vegetables.
Vegetables are also a good source of vitamins and minerals. They are important 
dietary sources of vitamins A, C and the B group, folate and potassium. Brassicas and 
legumes are good sources of Omega-3, a fatty acid tied to reduced risk of heart disease. 
Care must be taken during preparation to preserve the nutritional content of vegetables, 
however. Once peeled or cut, vegetables lose nutrients to the air or to any liquid in 
which they are allowed to soak. Water-soluble vitamins and folate are sensitive to air and 
heat. Prepare vegetables by steaming and reserve their cooking liquid to use in a sauce, 
soup or other preparations when possible. Many vitamins are concentrated just under 
the skin, so peel vegetables thinly, if at all.
PURCHASING AND STORING FRESH VEGETABLES
Fresh vegetables should be selected according to seasonal availability. Using a veg￾etable at the peak of its season has several advantages: Price is at its lowest, selection is 
at its greatest and the vegetable’s color, flavor and texture are at their best. The prime 
lignin organic substance that binds together the 
cells in wood and woody vegetables
M22_LABE1163_07_SE_C22.indd 643 03/11/23 5:56 PM644 CHaPteR tWeNtY-tWO
growing season for each vegetable depends on the region of the country where it is 
grown. Speak to your produce supplier and local farmers to learn what is available sea￾sonally in your location.
Grading Vegetables
The USDA has a voluntary grading system for fresh vegetables traded on wholesale 
markets. The system is based on appearance, condition and other factors affecting waste 
or eating quality. Grades for all vegetables include, in descending order of quality, U.S. 
Extra Fancy, U.S. Fancy, U.S. Extra No. 1 and U.S. No. 1. There are also grades that apply 
only to specific vegetables (e.g., U.S. No. 1 Boilers for onions).
Consumer or retail grading is currently required only for a few products, such as 
potatoes, carrots and onions. This grading system uses alphabetical listings, with Grade A 
being the finest.
Purchasing Vegetables
Fresh vegetables are sold by weight or count. They are packed in cartons referred to as 
cases, lugs, bushels, flats or crates. The weight or count packed in each of these con￾tainers varies depending on the size and type of vegetable as well as the packer. For 
example, celery is packed in 50- to 60-pound cartons containing 18–48 heads, depending 
on the size of each head.
Some of the more common fresh vegetables (e.g., onions, carrots, celery and let￾tuces) can be purchased from wholesalers trimmed, cleaned and cut according to 
your specifications. Although the unit price will be higher for diced onions than for 
whole onions, for example, the savings in time, labor, yield loss and storage space 
can be substantial. Processed vegetables may suffer a loss of nutrients, moisture and 
flavor, however.
Ripening Vegetables
Although vegetables do not ripen in the same manner as fruits, they do continue to 
breathe (respire) after harvesting. The faster the respiration rate, the faster the produce 
ages or decays. This decay results in wilted leaves and dry, tough or woody stems and 
stalks. Respiration rates vary according to the vegetable variety, its maturity at harvest 
and its storage conditions after harvest.
Ripening proceeds more rapidly in the presence of ethylene gas. Ethylene gas is emit￾ted naturally by fruits and vegetables and can be used to encourage further ripening in 
some produce, especially fruit vegetables such as tomatoes. Items harvested and shipped 
when mature but green (unripe) can be exposed to ethylene gas to induce color devel￾opment (ripening) just before sale.
Storing Vegetables
When storing fresh vegetables, always ensure there is good airflow and the proper tem￾perature to prevent spoilage. Some fresh vegetables are best stored at cool temperatures, 
between 50°F and 60°F (10°C and 16°C), ideally in a separate produce refrigerator. These 
include winter squashes, potatoes, onions, shallots and garlic. If a produce refrigerator 
is not available, store these vegetables at room temperature in a dry area with good 
ventilation. Do not store them in a refrigerator set at conventional temperatures. Colder 
temperatures convert the starches in these vegetables to sugars, changing their texture 
and flavor.
Most other vegetables benefit from cold storage at temperatures between 34°F and 
40°F (2°C and 4°C) with relatively high levels of humidity. Greens and other delicate 
vegetables should be stored away from apples, tomatoes, bananas and melons, as the 
latter give off a great deal of ethylene gas. Avocadoes and tomatoes continue to ripen 
when stored at room temperature. Tomato cells break down in colder temperatures, 
Farm-Fresh Flavor
Produce bought directly from the farm is 
appealing to chefs and diners. Farmer’s 
markets offer highly perishable items 
that are too fragile to ship, produce that 
has exceptionally short growing seasons 
as well as specialties such as fiddlehead 
ferns or fresh wild blueberries. Many chefs 
and consumers want to know the origins 
of their food and feel that buying locally 
protects farming traditions and the local 
economy. the limited supply of locally 
grown produce may make it insufficient 
for every restaurant’s needs, however. and 
fruits and vegetables may be costlier if the 
farmer does not sell wholesale, although 
a bumper crop may bring bargains and 
allow restaurants to supplement foods 
provided by traditional distributors.
to find local farmers, check with the 
department of agriculture in your state, 
which may offer farm-to-chef programs. 
Referral services in your area may exist 
to help you discover regional markets or 
distributors that carry local products. 
always consult your local department 
of health regarding what foods and 
sources of foods may be served. HaCCP 
standards make it important to know the 
farmer and the source of the produce to 
establish a chain of traceability.
M22_LABE1163_07_SE_C22.indd 644 03/11/23 5:56 PM Vegetables 645
altering their texture. Tomatoes should be stored at room temperature and used 
quickly. When buying root vegetables with the greens attached, remove the greens, 
which can leech moisture from the root, before refrigerating. (Use the greens as soon 
as possible.) As noted earlier, Brussels sprouts last longer on the stem, but their flavor 
intensifies with age.
Clean produce immediately before use. Moisture from washing may cause bacterial 
growth and spoilage.
PURCHASING AND STORING 
PRESERVED VEGETABLES
Preservation techniques, including irradiation, canning, freezing and drying, extend the 
shelf life of vegetables. Except for drying, these techniques do not substantially change 
the vegetable’s texture or flavor. Canning and freezing can also be used to preserve 
cooked vegetables.
Irradiated Vegetables
The irradiation process uses ionizing radiation (usually gamma rays of cobalt 60 or 
cesium 137) to sterilize foods. When foods are subjected to radiation, parasites, insects 
and bacteria are destroyed, ripening is slowed and sprouting is prevented. Irradiation 
works without a noticeable increase in temperature; consequently the flavor and texture 
of fresh foods are not affected. Some nutrients, however, may be destroyed. Irradiated 
vegetables do not need to be sprayed with post-harvest pesticides, and they have an 
extended shelf life.
The FDA classifies irradiation as a food additive. Although irradiation is not yet 
approved for all foods, grains, fruits and vegetables may be treated with low-dose radia￾tion. Irradiated foods must be labeled “Treated with radiation” or “Treated by irradiation.” 
The symbol shown in Figure 22.1 may also be used. Irradiated produce is purchased, 
stored and used like fresh produce.
Canned Vegetables
Canned vegetables are the backbone of menu planning for many food service 
 operations. In commercial canning, raw vegetables are cleaned and placed in a sealed 
container, then subjected to high temperatures for a specific period. Heating destroys 
the microorganisms that cause spoilage, and the sealed environment created by the can 
eliminates oxidation and retards decomposition. But the heat required by the canning 
process also softens the texture of most vegetables and alters their nutritional content; 
many vitamins and minerals may be lost through the canning process. Green vegetables 
may also suffer color loss, becoming a drab olive color.
Canned vegetables are graded by the USDA as U.S. Grade A or Fancy, U.S. Grade B 
or Extra-Select, and U.S. Grade C or Standard. U.S. Grade A vegetables must be of top 
quality, tender and free of blemishes. U.S. Grade C vegetables may lack uniformity or 
flavor but can be used in casseroles or soups when cost is a concern.
Combinations of vegetables as well as vegetables with seasonings and sauces are 
available canned. For example, corn kernels are available canned in water, in seasonings 
and sauces, combined with other vegetables or creamed. Canned vegetables are easy to 
serve because they are essentially fully cooked during the canning process.
Canned vegetables are purchased in cases of standard-sized cans. (See “Canned Good 
Sizes” in Appendix I: Measurement and Conversion Charts.) They may also be packaged 
in vacuum-sealed foil packages. Canned vegetables can be stored almost indefinitely at 
room temperature. Once a can is opened, any unused contents should be transferred 
to an appropriate storage container and refrigerated. Cans with bulges—a sign of the 
growth of harmful toxins—should be discarded immediately, without opening.

Hydroponics: 
Working Water
Hydroponics is the science of growing plants 
in water without soil in an inert medium 
such as gravel, peat, sand or other sterile 
material. Nutrients are distributed in water 
that is circulated over the plant’s roots. In 
a hydroponic farm, temperature and light 
are controlled to maximize production. 
because hydroponic farms are indoors, 
plants can be grown in any climate; both 
Canada and Holland are major producers of 
hydroponically grown vegetables.

Frozen Vegetables
Frozen vegetables are almost as convenient to use as canned. However they often 
require some cooking as well as expensive freezer space. Regardless, freezing is a 
highly effective method for preserving vegetables. It severely inhibits the growth of 
microorganisms that cause spoilage without destroying many nutrients. Generally fro￾zen green vegetables retain their color, although the appearance and texture of most 
frozen vegetables is somewhat altered by freezing. Because of the high water content in 
vegetables, ice crystals form from the water in the cells and burst the cells’ walls during 
the freezing process.
Some vegetables are available individually quick frozen (IQF). This method 
employs blasts of cold air, refrigerated plates, liquid nitrogen, liquid air or other tech￾niques to chill the vegetables quickly. Speeding the freezing process can greatly reduce 
the formation of ice crystals.
Combinations of vegetables as well as vegetables with seasonings and sauces are 
available frozen. Vegetable may be chopped or sliced before freezing. Some frozen veg￾etables are raw when frozen; others are blanched before freezing so that final cooking 
time is reduced and color is preserved. Others are fully cooked before freezing and only 
need to be thawed or heated for service. Frozen vegetables generally do not need to 
be thawed before being heated. Once thawed or cooked, frozen vegetables should be 
stored in the refrigerator and reheated in the same manner as fresh vegetables. Do not 
refreeze previously frozen vegetables.
Frozen vegetables are graded in the same manner as canned vegetables. They are 
usually packed in cases containing 1- to 5-pound (450-gram to 2.5-kilogram) boxes or 
bags. All frozen vegetables should be sealed in moisture-proof wrapping and kept at a 
constant temperature of 0°F (−18°C) or below. Temperature fluctuations can draw mois￾ture from the vegetables, causing poor texture and flavor loss. Adequate packaging also 
prevents freezer burn, which results in an irreversible change in the color, texture and 
flavor of frozen foods.
Dried Vegetables
Except for beans, peas, peppers, mushrooms and tomatoes, few vegetables are com￾monly preserved by drying. Unlike other preservation methods, drying dramatically 
alters flavor, texture and appearance. The loss of moisture concentrates flavors and 
sugars and greatly extends shelf life. Sun-drying is an ancient but time-consuming 
technique dependent on the weather. Alternatively, vegetables can now be dried 
quickly with warm, dry circulating air. Professional kitchens are often equipped with 
small dehydrators for preparing dried vegetable garnishes or for preserving vegetables 
for later use.
COOKING METHODS FOR VEGETABLES
Vegetables are cooked to break down their cellulose and gelatinize their starches. 
Cooking gives vegetables a pleasant flavor; creates a softer, more tender texture; and 
makes them easier to digest. Ideally most vegetables should be cooked as briefly as pos￾sible to preserve their flavor, nutrients and texture. Unfortunately, sometimes you must 
choose between emphasizing appearance and maintaining nutrition because cooking 
methods that preserve color and texture often remove nutrients.
Fiber Content and Vegetable Cookery
Although fiber in the diet is beneficial, we need to tenderize it to make some vegetables 
palatable. The best choice of cooking method and the length of cooking time is deter￾mined by the fiber content of the vegetable. Cooking affects the structure of vegetables 
by breaking down plant fiber, such as cellulose and pectin.
freezer burn surface dehydration and 
discoloration of food that results from moisture 
loss at below-freezing temperatures
pectin a water-soluble fiber found primarily 
in fruits; also a major component in some 
vegetables, such as carrots, fresh peas, 
parsnips, potatoes and green beans
 Safety Alert
Proper Washing of Vegetables
surface contaminants from pesticides, soil, 
water and handling must be removed from 
all vegetables to avoid the spread of food￾borne illnesses. First remove all labels, 
tags and ties. Wash whole produce under 
cold, running water. Water temperature 
should be only slightly warmer than 
the produce being washed; cold water 
causes the surface of the vegetable to 
contract, creating a vacuum that can 
draw contaminated water into the plant. 
soaking is not recommended because it 
can extract nutrients, nor is the use of soap 
or detergents. Potatoes, turnips and other 
root vegetables may be scrubbed with a 
clean brush to remove dirt. Refrigerate 
clean vegetables promptly and prevent 
cross-contamination during storage.
M22_LABE1163_07_SE_C22.indd 646 03/11/23 5:56 PM Vegetables 647
Water-soluble pectin can be broken down by moist-heat cooking methods such as 
steaming or boiling, while vegetables containing a higher amount of cellulose (e.g., 
cabbage, turnips and legumes) retain their shape even when cooked with moist heat. 
The amount of fiber varies by type of vegetable and age. Brassicas and stalk vegetables 
contain a high percentage of cellulose fiber; they should be picked when young and 
prepared in ways to reduce the fiber. Asparagus stems are peeled, for example, so that 
the tender tips cook in the same amount of time as the stems, which can be woody 
and tough. Older vegetables are more fibrous than younger ones. Older vegetables 
may require a longer cooking time and will cook more quickly if cut or diced first. 
Vegetables that are low in fiber, such as mushrooms and spinach, cook quickly regard￾less of their age.
Acid/Alkali Reactions and Vegetable Cookery
The acid or alkali content of the cooking liquid affects the texture and color of many 
vegetables such as asparagus, broccoli, green beans and red cabbage. Discoloration of 
vegetables during cooking is of greater concern with moist-heat cooking methods, but it 
is also a consideration with dry-heat cooking methods, as they often call for blanched or 
parboiled vegetables.
Texture
The acidity or alkalinity of the vegetable’s cooking liquid influences the finished prod￾uct’s texture. If an acid such as lemon juice, vinegar or wine is added to the liquid for 
flavoring, the vegetable will resist softening and will require a longer cooking time. On 
the other hand, an alkaline cooking medium, such as water with baking soda added, will 
quickly soften the vegetable’s texture and may cause it to become mushy. Alkalinity also 
causes nutrient (especially thiamin) loss and may impart a bitter flavor. Alkalinity can 
be caused by tap water, detergent residue on utensils or the addition of baking soda (a 
base) to the cooking liquid. (For example, adding 1∕8 teaspoon/0.6 milliliter baking soda 
per cup/225 milliliters of dried beans speeds softening.)
Color
The acidity or alkalinity of cooking liquid can also affect the plant’s pigments, causing 
both desirable and undesirable color changes. There are three principal pigment cat￾egories in plants: chlorophyll, carotenoid and flavonoid. A plant’s unique color is the 
result of a combination of these pigments. Chlorophyll pigments predominate in green 
vegetables such as spinach, green beans and broccoli. Carotenoid pigments predomi￾nate in orange and yellow vegetables such as carrots, tomatoes, red peppers and winter 
squashes. Flavonoid pigments predominate in red, purple and white vegetables such as 
red cabbage, beets and cauliflower.
Initially, as vegetables are cooked, their original colors intensify. Exposure to heat 
makes pigments, especially chlorophyll, appear brighter. Exposure to acids and bases 
affects both chlorophyll and flavonoid pigments. Acids gradually turn green vegetables 
an olive-drab color, whereas a slight alkalinity promotes chlorophyll retention. The 
opposite occurs with vegetables containing flavonoids: They retain desirable colors in 
a slightly acidic environment but lose colors in an alkaline one. (Carotenoids are not 
affected by either acidity or alkalinity.) Color changes alone do not affect flavor, but the 
altered appearance can make the product visually unappealing. (See Table 22.1.)
Colors also change as the naturally occurring acids in vegetables are released during 
cooking. If the cooking pan is kept covered, the acids can concentrate, creating richer 
flavonoid pigments but destroying chlorophyll pigments.
Therefore, if color is the only concern, vegetables with a high amount of chloro￾phyll such as spinach should be cooked in an alkaline liquid, and vegetables with a 
high amount of flavonoids such as red cabbage should be cooked in an acidic liquid.
But remember, the improvement in color usually comes at the expense of texture
and nutrients.

Guidelines for Vegetable Cookery
The following general guidelines for vegetable cookery should be considered regardless 
of the cooking method used:
	▪ Carefully cut vegetables into uniform shapes and sizes to promote even cooking 
and provide an attractive finished product.
	▪ Peel the tough outer skin on vegetables such as squashes and turnips, and trim 
any tough leaves or woody stems as needed to ensure tenderness after cooking.
	▪ Cook vegetables for as short a time as possible to preserve texture, color 
and nutrients.
	▪ Cook vegetables as close to service time as possible so that they retain nutrients 
and look appetizing. Pre-cooked vegetables held in a steam table or sauté pan 
near the stovetop soon become overcooked.
	▪ When necessary, vegetables may be blanched in advance, refreshed in ice water 
and refrigerated. They can then be reheated as needed.
	▪ To help retain their color, cook white and red vegetables (those with 
flavonoid pigments) with a small amount of acid such as lemon juice, vinegar 
or white wine.
	▪ When preparing an assortment of vegetables, cook each type separately, then 
combine them. If cooked together, some vegetables become overcooked in the 
time required to properly cook others.
Determining Doneness of Vegetables
Chefs find vegetables exciting to prepare because of the variety of colors, flavors and 
textures they provide. Because there are so many types of vegetables, with such varied 
responses to cooking, no one standard for doneness is appropriate. Generally, most 
cooked vegetables are done when they are just tender when pierced with a fork or the 
➊ spinach cooked with an alkali (left) and an 
acid (right).
➋ Cauliflower cooked with an alkali (left) and 
an acid (right).
➌ Red cabbage cooked with an alkali (left) 
and an acid (right).

tip of a paring knife. Starchy vegetables should hold their shape but yield to a fork. 
Green vegetables should be tender yet retain their color. Leafy vegetables should be 
wilted but still have a bright color and be tender with no stringiness.
Avoid overcooking vegetables by remembering that some carryover cooking will 
occur through the residual heat contained in the foods. Always rely on subjective tests—
sight, feel, taste and aroma—rather than the clock.
Preserving Nutritional Qualities in Vegetables
Just as cooking alters the physical properties of vegetables, it also affects vitamin, min￾eral and antioxidant properties. Raw vegetables have more vitamins and minerals than 
cooked vegetables. The fiber content of raw vegetables enhances the feeling of fullness 
after eating them, a help for those looking to reduce calorie consumption. To preserve 
the nutrients in vegetables, pay attention to the cooking time, the temperature and the 
cooking method used.
To retain vitamins when preparing vegetables consider the following guidelines:
	▪ Cook vegetables only as long as required to alter their texture.
	▪ Dry-heat cooking methods generally preserve vitamins better than moist-heat 
cooking methods.
	▪ Steaming vegetables reduces the amount of vitamin and mineral loss 
compared to boiling.
	▪ When boiling vegetables, reserve cooking liquid, which is rich in vitamins, for 
another use, such as for stocks or soups.
Conversely, cooking also can make some nutrients more digestible. Lycopene, the 
cancer-fighting antioxidant found in tomatoes and red peppers, is released when plant 
cell walls are broken down during cooking. Beta-carotene, a pigment associated with 
eye and skin health, gives carrots and pumpkins their orange color. Cooking makes 
 beta-carotene in vegetables easier to absorb. Iron in spinach becomes more available to 
the body when it is cooked. Serve vegetables prepared in a variety of ways, both raw 
and cooked, to ensure that diners benefit from all their nutrients.
DRY-HEAT COOKING METHODS FOR VEGETABLES
Dry-heat cooking methods used to cook vegetables include broiling, grilling, roasting, 
baking, sautéing, stir-frying, pan-frying, pan-roasting and deep-frying. These techniques 
concentrate flavors and bring out the natural sugars present in most vegetables. 
Vegetables contain very little, if any, fat, so butter, oil or another fat is added when using 
dry-heat cooking methods.
Broiling and Grilling
Broiling and grilling use high heat to cook vegetables quickly. This preserves nutri￾tional content and natural flavors. The radiant heat of the broiler or grill caramelizes 
vegetables, creating a pleasant flavor that is not generally achieved when vegetables are 
cooked by other methods.
Selecting and Preparing Vegetables to Broil or Grill
Broiling is often used to cook soft vegetables such as tomatoes or items that might not 
rest easily on a grill rack. Broiling is also used to warm and brown items just before ser￾vice. If necessary the vegetables can be basted to prevent them from drying out under 
the broiler’s direct heat. Sometimes a cooked vegetable is napped with sauce or clarified 
butter and placed briefly under the broiler as a finishing touch at service time.
A large range of vegetables can be grilled. Carrots, peppers, squashes, eggplants and 
similar vegetables should be cut into broad, thin slices. They can then be placed on the 
grill in the same manner as a portion of meat or fish to create attractive crosshatchings. 
M22_LABE1163_07_SE_C22.indd 649 03/11/23 5:56 PM650 CHaPteR tWeNtY-tWO
Root-to-Stem Cooking
More than one third of the food grown in the 
United states is wasted each year. the ePa 
estimates that discarded food from farms, food 
manufacturers, restaurants and home kitchens 
constitutes the largest percentage of waste in 
landfills and trash incinerators. Chefs and their 
guests have good reason to be concerned.
Chefs concerned with sustainability can 
use their skills and ingenuity to find more uses 
for the foods they purchase. One of the most 
effective ways to reduce food waste is to prevent 
it from happening in the first place. a good 
place to start is by purchasing produce wisely, 
anticipating needs for just 2 or 3 days at a time. 
this ensures freshness and therefore allows 
all parts of a vegetable or fruit to be used. 
For example, some chefs assert that broccoli 
stems taste like asparagus and are well suited 
to roasting whole or slicing and sautéing. Fresh 
young carrot, fennel and radish tops and stems 
of soft herbs such as cilantro and parsley can 
be chopped or puréed with other herbs to use 
as seasonings, in spreads such as pesto, or in 
vinaigrettes. Clean potato, sweet potato or 
turnip peels can be tossed in oil and baked into 
crisp garnishes or chips for dips and spreads. 
scraps from non-cruciferous vegetables such 
as green beans can be used to make vegetable 
stock and soup base. some peels, scraps and 
stems can be pickled and served as relish.
another way to prevent waste is to use less￾than-perfect produce. add it to purées, sauces 
and soups. Instead of tossing out an entire 
head of wilted and blemished greens or lettuce, 
remove discolored or wilted leaves and sauté 
with garlic and onions to use as a side dish, or 
cook and purée for a sauce. Mushroom stems 
and the dark green tops from leeks often land 
in the compost. egg dishes such as frittatas 
and quiche can be enhanced with these cooked 
scraps. Remove and discard soft spots from 
firm vegetables such as zucchini instead of 
discarding the entire vegetable. Use the rest of 
the vegetable in a stew or other preparation 
where the appearance is less important.
(See Chapter 10, Principles of Cooking.) Thread smaller vegetables such as mushrooms, 
cherry tomatoes and pearl onions onto skewers for easy handling. (Bamboo or wooden 
skewers should be soaked in cold water for 15 minutes before using to help prevent 
them from burning on the grill.)
Seasoning Vegetables to Broil or Grill
Vegetables contain little fat and therefore benefit greatly from added fat when being 
broiled or grilled. The added fat can be clarified butter or a marinade such as one made 
from olive oil and herbs. Some vegetables may be brushed with butter or oil and coated 
with bread crumbs or Parmesan before broiling.
Techniques used to season and prepare meat for grilling may also be used to prepare 
vegetables. Brining works well on firm vegetables such as beets, carrots and radishes 
that may otherwise burn under the broiler or on the grill before they soften. Brine adds 
flavor and allows the vegetables to be kept on the grill longer. (See Chapter 9, Mise en 
Place.) Salting achieves similar results and is one way to prepare firm cabbage leaves 
for grilling. Dry rubs such as those used to season steak amp up the flavor of vegetables 
such as grilled mushrooms. Oil the vegetables first so that the rub adheres and the veg￾etables don’t stick to the grill. Slices of eggplant, squash and zucchini as well as leafy 
greens benefit from marinating before broiling or grilling. After the vegetables absorb 
some of the marinade, brush with oil before cooking.
Procedure for Broiling or Grilling Vegetables
1 Heat the grill or broiler.
2 Use a wire brush to remove any charred or burnt particles that may be stuck to the broiler 
or grill grate. the grate may be wiped with a lightly oiled towel to remove any remaining 
particles and help season it.
3 Prepare the vegetables to be broiled or grilled by cutting them into appropriate shapes and sizes, 
then seasoning, marinating or otherwise preparing them as desired or directed in the recipe.
4 Place the vegetables on the broiler grate, broiler platter or grill grate and cook to the 
desired doneness while developing the proper surface color.

Roasting and Baking
The terms roasting and baking are used interchangeably when referring to vegetables. 
Roasting or baking brings out the natural sweetness of many vegetables while preserving 
their nutritional values. The procedures are basically the same as those for roasting meats.
Selecting and Preparing Vegetables to Roast or Bake
Hearty vegetables such as winter squashes and eggplant are especially well suited for 
roasting or baking. Vegetables such as onions, carrots and turnips are sometimes cooked 
alongside roasting meats or poultry. The vegetables add flavor to the finished roast and 
accompanying sauce, and the fats and juices released from the cooking roast add fla￾vor to the vegetables. Vegetables can be baked whole or cut into uniform-sized pieces. 
Squash, for example, is usually cut into large pieces. Vegetables may be peeled or left 
unpeeled, depending on the desired finished product.
 Seasoning Vegetables to Roast or Bake
Vegetables may be seasoned with salt and pepper and rubbed with butter or oil before 
baking, or they may be seasoned afterward with a wide variety of herbs and spices. Oiling 
the vegetables helps them brown and crisp in the hot oven. Some vegetables, such as 
winter squashes and sweet potatoes, may be seasoned with brown sugar or honey as well.

Sautéing
Sautéed vegetables should be brightly colored and slightly crisp when done and show 
little moisture loss. When sautéing vegetables, complete all preparation before cooking 
begins as timing is important and cooking progresses rapidly. Have all vegetables, herbs, 
spices, seasonings and sauces ready in advance.
 Selecting and Preparing Vegetables to Sauté
A wide variety of vegetables can be sautéed. Whatever vegetables are used, they should 
be cut into uniform-sized pieces to ensure even cooking.
Quick-cooking vegetables such as summer squashes, onions, greens, stalks, fruit veg￾etables and mushrooms can be sautéed without any preparation except washing and cut￾ting. Other vegetables such as Brussels sprouts, green beans, winter squashes, broccoli, 
cauliflower and most root vegetables are typically first blanched or otherwise partially 
cooked by baking, steaming or simmering. They are then sautéed to reheat and finish. 
Carrots, squashes and other vegetables are sometimes finished by sautéing in butter or 
oil and adding a small amount of honey or maple syrup to glaze them. Some cooked 
vegetables are reheated by simply sautéing them in a small amount of stock or sauce.
Seasoning Vegetables to Sauté
Sautéed vegetables can be seasoned with a great variety of herbs and spices. Seasonings 
should be added toward the end of the cooking process after all other ingredients have 
been incorporated to accurately evaluate the flavor of the finished dish.

Because sautéing vegetables is done at slightly lower temperatures than sautéing meats 
and poultry, usually whole butter can be used instead of clarified butter. For additional fla￾vors, fats such as bacon fat, olive oil, nut oils or sesame oil can be used in place of butter.
Procedure for Sautéing Vegetables
1 Wash the vegetables and cut into uniform shapes and sizes.
2 Heat a sauté pan and add enough fat to just cover the bottom. the pan should be large 
enough to hold the vegetables without overcrowding.
3 When preparing an assortment of vegetables, add the ingredients according to their 
cooking times (adding the vegetables that take the longest to cook first). Plan carefully so 
that all vegetables will be done at the same time. Do not overcrowd the pan; maintain high 
enough heat so that the vegetables do not cook in their own juices.
4 toss the vegetables using the sloped sides of the sauté pan to flip them back on top of 
themselves. Do not toss more than necessary. the pan should remain in contact with the 
heat source as much as possible to maintain proper temperatures.
5 add any sauces or vegetables with high water content, such as tomatoes, last.
6 season the vegetables as desired with herbs or spices, or add ingredients for a glaze.

Stir-Frying
Stir-frying is a form of sautéing that uses a wok or deeply curved sauté pan and high 
heat. Vegetables are cut into uniform-sized small pieces to ensure even cooking. They 
are then tossed with a moderate amount of fat over high heat. Although often associated 
with Chinese dishes, stir-frying can be used with many other flavor profiles and types 
of cuisine. The procedure for stir-frying is illustrated with the recipe for Stir-Fried Baby

 Pan-Frying
Pan-fried vegetables are cooked in a generous amount of fat in a frying pan or on 
a hot griddle. Vegetables to be pan-fried are usually sliced uniformly then seasoned 
and floured. Green tomatoes, eggplants and zucchini are examples of popular veg￾etables to pan-fry. When pan-frying vegetables, follow the procedures outlined in 
Chapter 10, Principles of Cooking. Maintaining the proper temperature so that the 
vegetables cook through without burning is essential when pan-frying. The recipe for 
Fried Green Tomatoes with Shrimp and Creole Rémoulade illustrates the techniques 
for pan-frying vegetables.

Pan-Roasting
Pan-roasting is a dry-heat cooking method that combines sautéing and roasting tech￾niques. Pan-roasted vegetables are first sautéed in a pan then finished in the oven. 
Sautéing browns the vegetables and begins the cooking process that is finished in the 
oven. Pan-roasted vegetables should be evenly browned and cooked through when 
done. Almost any vegetable is suitable for pan-roasting except for greens and watery 
vegetables such as cucumbers. When pan-roasting vegetables, cut them uniformly 
to ensure they cook thoroughly. Finish pan-roasted vegetables with chopped fresh 
herbs, seasoned butter or oil, rich stock or a splash of an acidic liquid such as lemon 
juice. The recipe for Pan-Roasted Brussels Sprouts illustrates the techniques for pan￾roasting vegetables.

Deep-Frying
Deep-frying is a popular method of preparing vegetables such as potatoes, squashes and 
onions. Deep-fried vegetables can be served as hors d’oeuvre, appetizers or accompani￾ments to a main dish. Vegetables can also be grated or chopped and incorporated into 
fritters or croquettes and deep-fried. Any deep-fried item should have a crisp, golden 
exterior with a tender, nongreasy center.
Except for potatoes (see Chapter 23, Potatoes, Grains and Pasta), most vegetables are 
breaded, battered or floured before deep-frying. Slow-cooking vegetables such as broc￾coli and cauliflower should be blanched in boiling water before breading or battering. 
Blanching speeds cooking and allows the interior to cook completely before the surface 
burns. Cutting firm vegetables, such as beets, carrots and squashes, into thin slices or 
strips helps speed their cooking.
Although vegetables that will be deep-fried can be marinated or seasoned directly, it is 
more common to season the batter, flour or breading that will coat them. Additional flavors are 
provided by the sauces and accompaniments served with the deep-fried vegetables. Creamy 
herb dressings or spicy tomato or soy-based dipping sauces are popular accompaniments.
Procedure for Deep-Frying Vegetables
1 slice, trim or otherwise prepare the vegetables to be deep-fried. Cut into uniform shapes 
and sizes to ensure even frying. blanch if necessary. season and bread or batter vegetables 
as desired.
2 Heat the fat to the desired temperature, usually between 325°F and 350°F (160°C and 
180°C). breaded, battered or floured vegetables cook quickly and the fat must be hot 
enough to cook the food’s interior without burning its surface.
3 Carefully place the vegetables in the hot fat without overcrowding using either the basket 
method or swimming method as appropriate.
4 Deep-fry the vegetables until done. they should have a crispy, golden-brown surface and 
should be tender.
5 Remove the deep-fried vegetables from the fat and hold them over the fryer, allowing the 
excess fat to drain off. transfer the food to a hotel pan either lined with absorbent paper or 
fitted with a rack. season with salt if desired.
6 If the deep-fried vegetables are to be held for later service, place them under a heat lamp.

MOIST-HEAT COOKING METHODS FOR VEGETABLES
Moist-heat cooking methods, especially boiling and steaming, work well with most veg￾etables. Fiber and starches in the vegetables break down more easily with moist heat, 
which makes those foods softer and their nutrients more accessible. Steaming makes 
green vegetables brighter by making chlorophyll more visible. Overcooking, however, 
turns green vegetables a dull, unappealing grey-green.
Blanching, Parboiling and Boiling
Blanching, parboiling and boiling are variations on cooking food submerged in boiling 
water; the difference between them is the length of cooking time. Blanched or parboiled 
vegetables are often finished by other cooking methods such as sautéing.
Blanching is the partial cooking of foods in a large amount of unseasoned boiling 
water for a very short time, often only a few seconds. Besides preparing vegetables for 
further cooking, blanching is used to remove strong or bitter flavors, soften firm foods, 
set colors or loosen skins for peeling. Kale, chard, snow peas and tomatoes are examples 
of vegetables that are sometimes blanched for purposes other than preparation for fur￾ther cooking.
Parboiling is the same as blanching, but the cooking time is longer, usually sev￾eral minutes. Parboiling is used to soften vegetables and shorten final cooking times. 
Parboiling is commonly used for preparing root vegetables, cauliflower, broccoli and 
winter squashes.
Boiling is used to fully cook vegetables and typically involves longer cooking times. 
Boiled vegetables can be served as is or they can be further prepared by quickly sauté￾ing with other ingredients, puréeing or mashing. Boiled vegetables can also be chilled 
and used in salads. Starchy root vegetables are better if not boiled but rather simmered 
slowly so that the heat penetrates to the interiors and cooks them evenly. Green veg￾etables should be boiled quickly in a large amount of salted water to retain their color 
and flavor.
Refreshing
Unless boiled, blanched or parboiled vegetables will be eaten immediately, they must be 
quickly chilled in ice water after they are removed from the cooking liquid. This prevents 
further cooking and helps to preserve their colors. This process is known as refreshing
or shocking the vegetables. The vegetables are removed from the ice water as soon as 
they are cold. Never soak or hold the vegetables in the water longer than necessary, or 
valuable nutrients and flavor will be leached away.

Procedure for Refreshing Vegetables
M22_LABE1163_07_SE_C22.indd 658 03/11/23 5:56 PM Vegetables 659
Selecting and Preparing Vegetables to Boil
Nearly any type of vegetable can be boiled. Carrots, cabbages, green beans, turnips and 
red beets are just a few of the most common ones. Vegetables should be uniform in size 
to ensure even cooking. Some vegetables are cooked whole and require only washing 
before boiling. Others must be washed, peeled and trimmed or cut into smaller or more 
manageable sizes. Cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli, Brussels sprouts and turnips 
release unpleasant odors when boiled for too long.
Seasoning Vegetables to Boil
Boiled vegetables may be cooked in salted water, stock, court bouillon or other liquid. 
There should be enough water so that the vegetables float freely. If too densely packed, 
green vegetables may take longer to cook and will discolor. Lemon juice, citrus zest, 
wine and other acidic ingredients are sometimes added to white and red vegetables; 
if so, they should be added to the liquid before the vegetables. Herbs and spices in a 
sachet or a bouquet garni add flavor to boiled vegetables and should be added accord￾ing to the recipe. After boiling, vegetables are sometimes finished with herbs, spices, 
butter, cream or sauces.
 Procedure for Boiling Vegetables
1 Wash, peel and trim the vegetables and cut into uniform shapes and sizes.
2 bring an adequate amount of liquid to a boil. be sure the liquid covers the vegetables, 
which should be able to move around freely without overcrowding.
3 add seasonings if desired or directed in the recipe.
4 add the vegetables to the boiling liquid. If more than one vegetable is to be cooked and 
they have different cooking times, they should be cooked separately to ensure that all are 
cooked to the proper doneness. the pot may be covered if cooking white, red or yellow 
vegetables. Do not cover the pot when boiling green vegetables.
5 Cook the vegetables to the desired doneness. Vegetables to be reheated before serving 
should be slightly undercooked and firm.
6 Remove the vegetables from the water with a slotted spoon or a spider or drain 
through a colander.
7 Refresh the vegetables in ice water, drain and refrigerate until needed or finish the hot 
boiled vegetables as desired and serve immediately.

Procedure for Cooking Dried Beans
Dried beans require a two-step moist-heat cooking technique. they are best rehydrated by 
soaking, as discussed earlier on page 636, and then cooking in a boiling (actually simmering) 
liquid. after rehydration and cooking, the beans can be served or further cooked in baked, 
sautéed or puréed dishes.
1 after soaking, place the drained beans in a heavy saucepan and cover with cold water or 
stock. allow approximately three times as much liquid as there are beans. add flavoring 
ingredients as directed in the recipe, but do not add acids or salt until the beans have 
reached the desired tenderness. acids and salt cause the exterior of beans to toughen and 
resist any further efforts at tenderizing.
2 slowly bring the liquid to a boil. boil uncovered for 10 minutes or as directed in the recipe. 
Use a ladle to remove any impurities that rise to the surface.
3 Cover and reduce the heat. simmer until the beans are tender. Whole beans generally 
require 1–2½ hours, lentils 20–35 minutes and split peas 30–60 minutes. add additional 
hot liquid if necessary to keep the beans adequately covered. Do not stir the beans 
during cooking.
4 Drain the cooked beans through a colander.

 Steaming
Vegetables can be steamed in a convection steamer or by placing them in a basket or 
on a rack and suspending them over boiling liquid in a wok, saucepan or hotel pan. 
Vegetables can also be pan-steamed by cooking them in a covered pan with a small 
amount of liquid; most of the cooking is done by steam because only a small portion 
of the food is submerged in the liquid. Steamed vegetables can be eaten plain, partially 
cooked and sautéed lightly to finish, incorporated into casseroles or puréed. If they are 
not served immediately, refresh and refrigerate until used.
M22_LABE1163_07_SE_C22.indd 661 03/11/23 5:56 PM662 CHaPteR tWeNtY-tWO
Properly steamed vegetables should be moist and tender. They generally retain their 
shape better than boiled vegetables. Vegetables cook very rapidly in steam, and over￾cooking is a common mistake.
Selecting and Preparing Vegetables to Steam
Nearly any vegetable that can be boiled can also be steamed successfully. All vegetables 
should be washed, peeled and trimmed if appropriate and cut into uniform-sized pieces. 
Pan-steaming is appropriate for vegetables that are small or cut into fairly small pieces 
such as peas and beans or broccoli and cauliflower florets.
Seasoning Vegetables to Steam
Steaming produces vegetables with clean, natural flavors. Foods cooked in convection 
steamers can be seasoned with herbs and spices; convection steamers use plain water 
to produce steam, so the foods being cooked do not gain flavor from the cooking liq￾uid. Vegetables steamed over liquids or pan-steamed in small amounts of liquids can be 
flavored by using stocks or court bouillon as the cooking liquid. Add herbs, spices and 
aromatic vegetables to any liquid for additional flavor.
Procedure for Steaming Vegetables
1 Wash, peel and trim the vegetables and cut into uniform shapes and sizes.
2 If a convection steamer is not being used, prepare a steaming liquid and bring it to a boil in 
a covered pan or double boiler.
3 Place the vegetables in a perforated pan in a single layer; do not crowd the pan. Place the 
pan over the boiling liquid or add the vegetables to the liquid.
4 Cover the pan and cook to the desired doneness.
5 Remove the vegetables from the steamer and serve, or refresh and refrigerate until needed.

Microwaving
Fresh vegetables are among the few foods that can be consistently well prepared in a 
microwave oven. Often microwave cooking can be accomplished without any addi￾tional liquid, thus preserving nutrients. With microwaving, colors and flavors stay true, 
and textures remain crisp.
Microwave cooking is actually a form of steaming. As explained in Chapter 10, 
Principles of Cooking, microwaves agitate water molecules, thus creating steam. The 
water may be the moisture found naturally in the food or may be added specifically to 
create the steam. Cooking time depends on the type of microwave oven as well as on 
the freshness, moisture content, maturity and quantity of vegetables being prepared.
Selecting and Preparing Vegetables to Microwave
Any vegetable that can be steamed successfully can be microwaved with good results. 
Because typical microwave ovens are relatively small, they are impractical for producing 
large quantities of food. They are most useful for reheating small portions of vegetables 
that have been blanched or partially cooked using another cooking method.
Seasoning Vegetables to Microwave
Microwaving, like steaming, brings out the natural flavors of food. Herbs and spices can 
be added to the vegetables before they are microwaved. Or after microwaving, the veg￾etables can be tossed with butter, herbs and spices or combined with a sauce.
Procedure for Microwaving Vegetables
1 Wash, peel and trim the vegetables and cut into uniform shapes and sizes.
2 Place the vegetables in a steamer designed for microwave use or arrange the vegetables in 
a microwavable dish. Cover the vegetables with a lid or plastic wrap. If using plastic wrap, 
puncture it to allow some steam to escape during cooking.
3 Cook the vegetables to the desired doneness, allowing for some carryover cooking, or 
reheat previously cooked vegetables until hot. stir or turn the vegetables as necessary to 
promote even cooking.
4 serve the vegetables or refresh and refrigerate until needed.

Combination Cooking Methods: Braising and 
Stewing Vegetables
Classic combination cooking methods of braising and stewing can be used with veg￾etables to soften fibers and create a flavorful sauce in which the main ingredient will 
be served. In contrast to the tougher cuts of meat or poultry generally associated with 
combination cooking methods, vegetables are braised or stewed at lower temperatures 
for shorter times, and less cooking liquid is usually added. The braising liquid, including 
any given off by the vegetables, is reduced to a light sauce, becoming part of the finished 
product. Generally a braised dish is prepared with only one vegetable; a stew is a mix￾ture of several vegetables. The main ingredients are sometimes browned in fat before the 
liquid is added to enhance flavor and color.
Both braises and stews can be exceptionally flavorful because they are served with 
all of their cooking liquid. (Boiled vegetables, in contrast, lose some of their flavor to 
the cooking liquid.) Braised and stewed vegetables generally can be held hot for service 
longer than vegetables prepared by other cooking methods. Vegetables may be braised 
using the sous vide method described in Chapter 10, Principles of Cooking. The flavor of 
sous vide vegetables is intensified because the juices are retained when cooking in the 
plastic pouch. (See Butter-Braised Honey Carrots, page 686.)
Selecting and Preparing Vegetables to Braise or Stew
Various lettuces, especially romaine and Boston, are often braised. Cabbages, Belgian 
endive, leeks and many other vegetables are also commonly braised. Stews may con￾tain a wide variety of vegetables such as summer or winter squashes, eggplant, onions, 
peppers, tomatoes, carrots, celery and garlic. Leafy green vegetables are less commonly 
braised or stewed.
The vegetables should be washed and peeled or trimmed if appropriate. Vegetables 
to be braised may be left whole, cut into uniform pieces or shredded as desired. Heads 
of lettuce are usually cut into halves or quarters; cabbage is often shredded. Strongly 
flavored vegetables such as celery root and turnips are usually parboiled first to soften 
their flavors.
Seasoning Vegetables to Braise or Stew
Both braises and stews may include flavoring ingredients such as garlic, herbs, bacon or 
mirepoix. The liquid can be water, wine, stock or tomato juice. Vegetables can even be 
braised in butter and sugar or honey to create a glazed dish.
Both braises and stews can be seasoned with a variety of herbs and spices. Add the 
seasonings before covering the pot to finish the cooking process.
Procedure for Braising and Stewing Vegetables
1 Wash, peel, trim and cut the vegetables.
2 sauté or sweat the flavoring ingredients in fat to release their flavors. Or sauté or sweat the 
main ingredients in fat.
3 For a braise, add the main ingredient in a single layer. For a stew, add the ingredients 
according to their cooking times or as directed in the recipe.
4 add the cooking liquid; it should partially cover the vegetables. bring the liquid to a boil, 
reduce to a simmer, cover and cook in the oven or on the stove top until done.
5 If desired, remove the main ingredients from the pan and reduce the sauce or thicken it with 
beurre manié, cornstarch or arrowroot. then return the main ingredients to the sauce.

Puréeing Vegetables
Vegetables may be puréed into a smooth paste after being fully cooked. Cooked vegeta￾ble purées can be served as is, or they can be used as an ingredient in other preparations 
such as pumpkin pie, mashed potatoes or vegetable soufflés. Purées can also be bound 
with eggs, seasoned and used to make vegetable timbales and terrines. Modernist culi￾nary presentations may employ smears, drops or splashes of intensely flavored vegetable 
purées to add color and contrast to plated dishes.
Puréed vegetables are generally first cooked by baking, boiling, steaming or micro￾waving. White, red and yellow vegetables should be cooked until quite soft. They are 
more easily puréed when hot or warm; this also helps ensure a smooth finished purée. 
For most preparations, green vegetables must be refreshed after cooking and puréed 
while cold, or they will overcook and become discolored.
Seasoning Vegetables to Purée
Vegetables for purées can be seasoned before they are puréed following the guidelines 
for the cooking procedure used. They can also be seasoned after they are puréed with 
a wide variety of ingredients such as herbs, spices, alcoholic spirits, cheese, honey or 
brown sugar.
Finishing Puréed Vegetables
Purées can be finished with stocks, sauces, butter or cream to add richness and 
flavor. First purée the main ingredient, then add additional liquids to obtain the 
desired consistency.

 Procedure for Puréeing Vegetables
1 Cook the vegetables. White, red and yellow vegetables should be cooked until very soft. 
green vegetables should be cooked until tender but not overcooked to the point of being 
discolored. If cooking the vegetables in a liquid, drain them well.
2 Purée the vegetables in a food processor or blender or by passing them through a food mill.
3 season or finish the puréed vegetables as desired or directed in the recipe, or use them in 
another recipe.

PRESERVING VEGETABLES
For millennia people have preserved vegetables in times of plenty in order to have food 
available in times of need. Modern preservation techniques of canning and freezing 
aim to maintain vegetables in a state as close to fresh as possible. Ancient preservation 
techniques, such as drying, pickling and fermenting, alter the flavor and texture of veg￾etables dramatically and are used today to add complex flavors to vegetables as well as 
to preserve them.
 Drying
Drying, also known as dehydration, uses air and gentle heat to remove moisture from 
foods, so that bacteria can no longer cause spoilage or decay. As the food item 
loses water, sugars and flavors become more concentrated. Its nutrients 
also become more concentrated, except for vitamins A and C, which 
are destroyed by the process. Drying intensifies the glutamate con￾tent of mushrooms and tomatoes, making them a good source of 
umami taste. (See page 127.) Foods such as dried mushrooms and 
sun-dried tomatoes are rehydrated in water or a flavorful liquid 
before use. Most dried vegetables can be added to soups or 
stews during cooking without rehydrating them first, however.
Pickling
Pickling refers to soaking the fresh food in a very hot vinegar￾based brine. The heat and acetic acid destroy microorganisms 
on the food, preventing fermentation and bacterial deterioration 
and making the item somewhat less nutritious than it would be raw. 
Herbs, spices, citrus juice and sugar may be added to the vinegar brine 
for additional flavor. See page 191 for information on brines. Pickling is 
faster than fermentation, and the final flavors are not as deep or complex. Popular 
examples include a wide variety of pickled cucumbers and other fruits and vegetables, 
such as okra, watermelon rind, green beans, peaches and carrots. For longer storage, 
jars of pickled vegetables may be canned or processed in a water bath. (Consult your 
local health department for regulations about preparing and serving restaurant-canned 
products in your area.)
For convenience, pickling spice blends are available to season cucumber and other 
vegetable pickles. Most pickling spice blends are based on black peppercorns and red 
chiles, with some or all of the following added: dill, allspice, cloves, ginger, mustard 
seeds, coriander seeds and bay leaves. Using primarily dill seeds and pods in the brine 
creates the popular sour dill (kosher) pickles.
Fermented and pickled vegetables (from 
left): kosher (sour) dill pickles, sauerkraut 
and kimchi
Procedure for Pickling Vegetables
1 Wash, trim and cut vegetables as desired. blanch or cook vegetables if necessary. Drain and 
dry them.
2 Prepare the vinegar pickling brine and seasoning mixture. bring to a boil.
3 Pack vegetables in sterilized non-reactive containers, layering or arranging according to 
the recipe.
4 Cover the vegetables with the pickling brine. Cool to room temperature.
5 Cover the containers tightly, refrigerate and let the vegetables cure in the brine for the 
time specified.

Fermenting
Fermentation is perhaps the oldest form of food preservation, and some one third of all 
food consumed by humans today is prepared with fermentation. To the scientist, fer￾mented foods are those that have been transformed by the metabolism of microorganisms, 
specifically fungi and bacteria. (Fermentation with yeast [a fungi] is discussed in the mate￾rial on alcoholic beverages in Chapter 7, Flavors and Flavorings, and in Chapter 32, Yeast 
Breads.) Vinegar, yogurt, tempeh, kombucha and other foods are created by aerobic (with 
oxygen) fermentation involving various molds (another fungi) and bacteria. Vegetables 
and some fruits are often fermented from their raw state by lactobacillus bacteria, which 
M22_LABE1163_07_SE_C22.indd 668 03/11/23 5:56 PM Vegetables 669
naturally lives on all plants. These bacteria convert plant sugars into lactic acid and pre￾serve vitamin C in a process known as lacto-fermentation. This creates complex flavors 
and improves the nutritional value of fruits and vegetables. Lactobacillus bacteria are also 
probiotic organisms, those that form beneficial colonies in the digestive tract when eaten.
Lacto-fermentation is an invisible multistep process that inhibits the growth of the 
microorganisms that can produce pathogens or cause plants to decompose. Lactobacillus 
bacteria require an anerobic (oxygen-free) environment and work best in a tempera￾ture range of 45–65°F (7.5–18°C). Traditionally, fruits and vegetables were fermented 
in tightly sealed earthenware crocks, sometimes stored underground to maintain the 
desired temperature. Examples include kimchi and sauerkraut, both of which are made 
with cabbage, as well as olives and umeboshi, Japanese preserved plums. Cucumbers are 
also fermented in a flavored salt brine to create traditional deli-style pickles. Fermented 
cucumber “pickles” should be kept refrigerated, although cucumbers pickled in the acidic 
acid of vinegar may be stored at room temperature because that technique destroys all 
microorganisms.
Fermentation with lactic acid bacteria begins by coating raw fruits or vegetables with 
either dry salt or a strong brine, which breaks down the plant’s cell structure and draws 
out water. The food is submerged in this liquid, preventing contact with oxygen. Herbs, 
spices, sugar and similar flavorings may be added. Left undisturbed at the appropriate 
temperature, the food will be protected from harmful organisms as it evolves. The appro￾priate combination of salt, time and temperature along with the impact of lactic acid 
determines the final flavor and texture of vegetables preserved by fermentation.
Illustration of Lactobacillus plantarum from the final stages of vegetable 
fermentation.
Koji
Koji is a culture made by growing fungi 
(especially Aspergillus oryzae) on steamed 
grains (usually rice, barley, soybeans or 
wheat). this culture produces enzymes 
that convert carbohydrates and proteins 
into less complex fermentable sugars. 
these simple sugars then provide 
nutrition for other types of yeasts and 
bacteria that come into play during later 
fermentation stages. the production 
of koji is a strictly defined aerobic 
fermentation requiring precise control of 
moisture and temperature.
Koji and similar fungal cultures such 
as Chinese qu and Korean nurukgyan are 
used throughout asia to produce a variety 
of fermented food products, including soy 
sauce, miso, fermented soybeans, mirin 
and grain-based alcoholic beverages such 
as sake, amazake, makgeolli and others.
Pickles
Note that the word pickles is commonly 
used in the United states for both 
fermented and pickled fruits and 
vegetables, especially cucumbers. 
Remember that these techniques are not 
the same, however. Pickling uses a hot 
liquid containing acidic acid to destroy 
microorganisms quickly; fermenting 
employs salt and natural lactobacillus 
bacteria in an anerobic environment to 
produce lactic acid over time.
Procedure for Fermenting Vegetables
1 Wash, trim and cut vegetables as desired. Do not blanch or cook, as this will destroy the 
essential bacteria. Prepare any seasoning mixture required.
2 Combine the vegetables with dry salt or brine as directed. let the vegetables sit to allow the 
salt to pull moisture from the vegetables.
3 Pack vegetables in sterilized nonreactive containers, layering or arranging with seasonings 
as directed.
4 Cover the vegetables with the extracted liquid brine (with additional filtered water as 
needed), to create an oxygen-free environment.
5 Place a weight on top of the vegetables so they stay submerged even when carbon dioxide is 
released. Cover and store at a constant temperature of 45–65°F (7.5–18°C), or as directed.
6 When fermentation is complete, store as directed and refrigerate.

Good Choice Baechu-Kimchi (Korean Spicy Cabbage)
Although there are close to 200 recognized varieties of kimchi in Korea, the most common and popular 
version is made from large napa cabbages. During the autumn kimjang season, families gather to preserve 
enough cabbages to last through the winter. The cabbages are soaked in brine and then coated with a pungent 
seasoning paste applied by hand. The seasonings vary by region and family tradition. The seasoned cabbage is 
stored in a cool place to ferment, then appears as a side dish at every meal. It is also incorporated into stews 
and soups, sautéed with rice, stuffed into dumplings and fried in pancakes. When fermenting cabbage, always 
wear gloves to prevent cross-contamination. Store the finished cabbage in plastic or ceramic containers with

1 Remove the tough outer leaves from the cabbage and trim the root, leaving enough root to hold the 
head together. Rinse the cabbage and cut it in half lengthwise. Rinse the halves again and drain.
2 Place the cabbage halves in a large non-reactive bowl, cut side up. add enough water to cover the 
cabbage. sprinkle a generous amount of coarse salt over the cabbage and stir enough salt into the 
water to create a 10-percent salt solution. soak at room temperature for approximately 5 hours, 
turning the cabbage once halfway through.
3 Remove the cabbage from the brine when it is softened but still crisp. Do not discard the brine. 
Rinse the cabbage carefully under cool running water and place it, cut side down, on a cooling rack 
or in a large colander to drain.
4 to prepare the seasoning paste, moisten the rice flour with 2 fluid ounces (60 milliliters) of 
the fresh water. In a small saucepan, combine the wet rice flour and remaining 2 fluid ounces 
(60 milliliters) of fresh water; bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook, stirring constantly, 
until a thick paste is formed. Remove from the heat and pour into a bowl to cool.
5 Combine the remaining seasoning ingredients with the flour paste. adjust the amount of chile 
powder used depending on the flavor desired.
6 Wearing gloves, lay each portion of cabbage on a work surface, cut side up. starting with the outer 
leaves and working in, spread some of the seasoning mixture between each leaf, being careful not 
to break the leaves off from the root. the outer leaves will be very soft and can be wrapped tightly 
around the cabbage to hold it together during aging.
7 Place the cabbage in an airtight plastic or glass container. Pour about 2 cups (480 milliliters) of the 
brine water into the bowl that held the seasoning paste. stir to clean the remaining seasonings 
from the bowl, and then pour this mixture over the cabbage. Cover and leave at room temperature 
for 24 hours, then refrigerate. the kimchi will keep for up to 5 months but will become more 
strongly flavored due to fermentation as it ages.
* You may grind short-grain rice by hand with a mortar and pestle to make the flour.

 Potatoes, grains (corn, rice, wheat and others) and pastas are collectively known as 
starches. some of these foods are vegetables, others are grasses, and pastas are pre￾pared products made from grains. starches are staple foods: foods that define a 
cuisine and give meals substance. all these foods are high in starchy carbohydrates, low in 
fat and commonly part of well-balanced meals. 
 today’s chefs are rediscovering traditional and global dishes that rely on grains seldom 
used in typical american food service operations. Farinaceous dishes made from the world’s 
variety of grains now regularly appear on menus in addition to the familiar potato. 
 IDENTIFYING, PURCHASING AND STORING POTATOES 
 Potatoes (Fr. pommes de terre ) are one of the vegetables native to the Americas, probably 
originating in the South American Andes. Botanically, potatoes are succulent, nonwoody 
annual plants. The portion consumed is the tuber, the swollen fleshy part of the under￾ground stem. Potatoes are hardy and easy to grow, making them inexpensive and widely 
available. The average person in the United States eats nearly 50 pounds of potatoes each 
year, 40% of which are frozen. Potatoes are one of the top five vegetable crops in the 
United States and the fourth-most consumed crop in the world, after rice, wheat and corn. 
 Identifying Potatoes 
 In this chapter we discuss some of the more commonly used types of potatoes. Other 
potato varieties are regularly being developed or rediscovered and now appear in mar￾kets and on menus. 
 One of the most important considerations in selecting potatoes is choosing between 
the mealy (starchy) and waxy varieties. It is important to understand the differences and 
choose the type of potatoes best suited to the type of dish being prepared. 
Mealy potatoes (also known as starchy potatoes) have a high starch content and thick 
skin. They are best for baking and are often referred to simply as “bakers” when ordered 
from suppliers. The low sugar content of mealy potatoes allows them to be deep-fried long 
enough to fully cook the interior without burning the exterior. Mealy potatoes tend to fall 
apart when boiled, making them a good choice for whipped or puréed potatoes. 
All-purpose potatoes have a medium starch content somewhere between mealy 
and waxy potatoes, which makes them suitable for most cooking methods, although 
they may fall apart when boiled. 
Waxy potatoes have a low starch content and thin skin. They are best for boil￾ing and will hold their shape better when used in soups or potato salad. They do not 
develop the desired fluffy texture when baked. Waxy potatoes tend to become limp and 
soggy when deep-fried because of their high moisture content. 
 A comparison of mealy and waxy potatoes and their uses is presented in Table 23. 1 . 
The cooking characteristics of each type of potato are discussed below. 
 farinaceous a food made from flour or meal, or 
having a starchy, mealy texture; from the Latin 
farina meaning a flour made from cereal grains 
or nuts; refers to food that is high in starch, 
especially pasta, noodles, rice and polenta

Fingerlings
Fingerling potatoes are typically heirloom varieties, related to the original potato varieties 
from the Andes. They are generally small, long or oblong and have good flavors. The 
Russian Banana looks like a small banana and has a firm texture and rich, buttery flavor. 
The red-streaked French fingerling has a nutty flavor; the red Ruby Crescent has a strong, 
earthy flavor. Fingerling varieties tend to be low in starch and are good for roasting and 
in potato salads.
New Potatoes
New potatoes are small, immature potatoes (of any variety) that are harvested before 
their starches develop. Although red potatoes, discussed below, can be “new,” not all 
new potatoes are red-skinned. Conversely, not all red-skinned pota￾toes are new. True new potatoes are waxy with a high moisture 
content and a thin, delicate skin.
Purple Potatoes
Purple (or blue) potatoes have a deep purple skin. The flesh is 
bright purple, becoming lighter when cooked. They are mealy, 
with a flavor and texture similar to russets. The most common 
varieties are All Blue and Caribe, which were also quite popular 
in the mid-19th century.
Red Potatoes
Red potatoes have a thin, red skin and crisp, white, waxy flesh that 
is best suited to boiling or steaming. They do not have the dry, 
mealy texture that successful baking requires. Red potatoes are 
round, instead of long or oblong; popular varieties are Red Bliss, 
Red Pontiac and Norland.
Russet Potatoes
Russet potatoes, commonly referred to as Idaho potatoes, are the standard baking 
potato. They are long with rough, reddish-brown skin and mealy flesh. Russets are 
excellent baked and are the best potatoes for frying. They tend to fall apart when 
boiled. There are over a dozen varieties of russet potato, the most widely planted is 
the Burbank (named for its developer, the agriculture scientist Luther Burbank). They 
are marketed in several size categories. Select those in the size most appropriate for 
their intended use.
Sweet Potatoes
Sweet potatoes are from a different botanical family than other potatoes, although they 
are also tubers that originated in the Americas. Two types of sweet potatoes are com￾monly available. One has pale yellow to white flesh, reddish-purple skin, and a dry, 
mealy texture; it is known as a boniato, Asian or Cuban sweet potato. The other has a 
darker orange, moister flesh and is high in sugar; it is known as a red sweet potato. Both 
types have thick skins ranging in color from light tan to brownish red. (Sometimes dark￾skinned sweet potatoes are erroneously labeled 
yams.) Sweet potatoes, which have a high 
moisture content, should be chosen accord￾ing to the desired degree of sweetness. 
They are best suited for boiling, baking and 
puréeing, although the less sweet varieties 
can also be deep-fried. The cooked flesh can 
be used in breads, pies and puddings. Sweet 
potatoes are available canned, often in a spiced or 
sugary sauce.

White Potatoes
White potatoes are available in round or long varieties. They 
have a thin, tender skin with a tender, waxy yellow or white 
flesh. Round white potatoes are also referred to as chef or all￾purpose potatoes. White potatoes are usually cooked with moist 
heat or used for sautéing. White Rose and Finnish Yellow (or Yellow 
Finn) are popular varieties.
Another variety of white potato known as the Yukon Gold is a medium-sized, 
slightly flattened, oval potato. Yukon Golds have a delicate pale-yellow skin with 
shallow pink eyes. Their pale-yellow flesh has a creamy texture and rich, buttery, 
nutty flavor. They are an all-purpose potato suitable for most cooking methods and 
will retain their yellow color when baked, boiled or fried. First bred by botanists in 
Canada, Yukon Golds are now grown throughout the United States. Other lesser￾known, gold-fleshed white potato varieties include Michigold, Carola, Delta Gold, 
Banana fingerlings and Saginaw Gold.
Yams
Yams are a third type of tuber that is botanically different from other potatoes. 
Yams are less sweet than sweet potatoes, but yams and sweet potatoes can be used 
interchangeably. The flesh of yams ranges from creamy white to deep red. Yams 
are Asian in origin and are now found in Africa, South America and the southern 
United States.
Nutritional Information for Potatoes
Potatoes contain a high percentage of complex carbohydrates and little or no fat. 
Easily digested, potatoes contribute to feelings of fullness or satiety; adding them to 
a dish helps make it more filling. They are a good source for minerals and vitamins, 
especially vitamin B6, vitamin C and potassium, although much of the vitamin C 
can be destroyed when potatoes are cooked in liquid. The more deeply colored the 
potato, the better the source of antioxidants. Purple potatoes, for example, are high 
in anthocyanins, which are associated with regulating blood pressure and cancer 
prevention. Potato skins are rich in insoluble fiber, often lacking in the average diet. 
Avoid loading potatoes with high-fat dairy products such as butter, cheese and sour 
cream; instead use low-fat dairy products, fresh herbs and spices to maintain their 
health benefits.
Purchasing and Storing Potatoes
Choose potatoes that are heavy and very firm with clean skin. Avoid those with many 
eyes, sprouts, green streaks, soft spots, cracks or cut edges. Most varieties are available 
all year. When ordering potatoes, note that size A is larger than size B. Size B must 
be between 1½ and 2¼ inches (3.75 and 5.5 centimeters) in diameter. Size C potatoes, 
referred to as creamers, are the smallest, measuring ¾–15∕8 inches (2–4 centimeters) 
in diameter.
Grading
Like other vegetables, potatoes are subject to the voluntary USDA grading system. Select 
U.S. No. 1 potatoes, the top grade, when perfect appearance is required. U.S. Commercial 
or U.S. No. 2 potatoes work in applications involving peeling and cutting.
 Purchasing
Potatoes are usually packed in 50-pound cartons. Counts vary depending on average 
potato size. For example, in a 100-count carton, each potato weighs an average of 
8 ounces. Eighty-, 90- and 100-count cartons are the most common. Generally larger-sized 
White potatoes

potatoes (i.e., lower counts) are more expensive. Their higher price does not reflect 
higher quality, however, so select the size according to their intended use.
Storing
Temperatures between 50°F and 65°F (10°C and 18°C) are best for storing potatoes. 
Do not store raw potatoes in the refrigerator. At temperatures below 40°F (4°C), potato 
starch turns to sugar, making the prepared product too sweet and increasing the risk that 
the potato will develop gray-colored streaks when cooked. Potatoes with a high sugar 
content also burn more easily when fried.
Potatoes should be stored in a dark room, as light promotes chlorophyll production, 
turning the potatoes green and bitter. A green patch indicates the possible presence of 
solanine, a toxin harmful if eaten in large amounts. Any green patches should be peeled 
away. Solanine is also present in the eyes and sprouts, and they, too, should be removed 
and discarded before cooking.
Under proper conditions, fresh baking or general-purpose potatoes should last for 
2 months; new potatoes will keep for several weeks. Do not wash potatoes until ready 
to use, as washing promotes spoilage. Once peeled, potatoes should be stored covered 
in water and refrigerated to prevent enzymatic browning.
COOKING METHODS FOR POTATOES
Potatoes have a relatively neutral flavor, making them a perfect accompaniment to many 
savory dishes. They can be prepared with almost any dry- or moist-heat cooking method: 
baking, sautéing, pan-frying, deep-frying, boiling or steaming. They can be combined 
with other ingredients in braises and stews. Potatoes are used in soups (vichyssoise), 
dumplings (gnocchi), breads, pancakes (latkes), puddings, salads and even vodka.
Many potato dishes, both classic and modern, employ more than one cooking method. 
For example, Lorette Potatoes (page 727) require boiling, then deep-frying; hash browns 
require parboiling, then sautéing. Even French fries are best when first blanched in hot 
oil before final deep frying.
Regardless of cooking method, potatoes are generally considered done when they 
are soft and tender or offer little resistance when pierced with a knife tip. Fried potatoes 
should have a crisp, golden-brown surface; the interior should be moist and tender.
Roasting and Baking
Potatoes are often roasted along with meat or poultry. As they roast, they become coated 
with the fat and drippings released from the meat as it cooks. Either mealy or waxy pota￾toes, peeled or unpeeled, can be roasted successfully.
Mealy potatoes such as russets are ideal for baking. The skin is left intact, although it 
may be pierced with a fork to allow steam to escape. A true baked potato should not be 
wrapped in foil or cooked in a microwave; this changes the cooking method to steaming 
and prevents a crisp skin from forming. A properly baked potato should be white and 
fluffy, not yellowish or soggy. Once baked, potatoes can be eaten plain or with various 
garnishes or used in other recipes.
Procedure for Baking Potatoes
1 scrub the potatoes well.
2 Using a fork, pierce potato skins if desired.
3 rub the potatoes with oil and salt if desired. do not wrap them in foil.
4 Bake the potatoes until done. a paring knife should penetrate them easily.
 Safety Alert
Cooked Potatoes
Cooked potato dishes, especially those 
with cream, butter or custard, require 
time and temperature control for safety 
(tCs). they must be held for service at 
135°F (57°C) or higher. Be sure to reheat 
potato dishes to 165°F (74°C) or higher 
before serving.

Many classic potato dishes require baking either raw or parboiled potatoes with sauce, 
cheese, meat or other seasonings as a casserole in a hotel pan. Well-known examples 
include scalloped potatoes, which are baked in béchamel sauce, and potatoes au gra￾tin, which are topped with cheese and baked. These dishes usually develop a crisp, 
brown crust, which is part of their appeal. A potato casserole should hold its shape 
when cut; the potatoes should be tender, and the sauce should be smooth, not grainy. 
Potato casseroles can be fully baked, then held loosely covered in a steam table for 
service. Portions can be reheated or browned briefly under a broiler or salamander at 
service time.

Sautéing and Pan-Frying
Waxy potatoes, such as red- and white-skinned varieties, are best for sautéing or 
 pan-frying. Often they are first parboiled or even fully cooked. This is a convenient way 
to use leftover boiled potatoes. They are then cooked in fat following the general proce￾dures for sautéing and pan-frying discussed in Chapter 10, Principles of Cooking.
The fat can be clarified butter, oil, bacon fat, duck fat, ghee or lard, depending on the 
desired flavor of the finished dish. The fat must be hot before the potatoes are added so 
that the potatoes will develop a crust without absorbing too much fat. Sautéed potatoes 
should have a crisp, well-browned crust and tender interior. They should be neither 
soggy nor greasy.
Potatoes can be sautéed or pan-fried by two methods: tossing and still-frying. The 
tossing method is used to cook relatively small pieces of potatoes in a small amount of 
fat. The potatoes are tossed using the pan’s sloped sides so that they brown evenly on all 
sides. The still-frying method is used to create a disc-shaped potato product. Shredded 
or sliced potatoes are added to the pan, usually covering the pan’s bottom, and allowed 
to cook without stirring or flipping until they are well browned on the first side. The 
entire mass is then turned and cooked on the second side. When the potatoes are done, 
they can be cut into wedges for service.
Procedure for Sautéing and Pan-Frying Potatoes
1 Wash, trim, peel, cut and/or cook the potatoes as desired or as directed in the recipe.
2 Heat the pan, add the fat and heat the fat. add the potatoes to the hot fat. do not 
overcrowd the pan. Use enough fat to prevent the potatoes from sticking to the pan. 
depending on the recipe, use either the tossing method or the still-frying method.
3 add garnishes, seasonings and other ingredients as desired or as directed in the recipe.
4 Cook the potatoes until done.

Deep-Frying
Potato chips and French fries (Fr. pommes frîtes) are extremely popular in a variety of 
shapes, sizes and seasonings. Although a wide range of frozen products is available, 
fresh fried potatoes can be a delicious, economical menu item.
Top-quality russet potatoes are recommended for deep-frying. The peel may be 
removed or left attached. If peeled, the potatoes should be soaked in clear, cold water 
until ready to cut and cook. This keeps them crisp and white by leaching some of the 
starch that might otherwise make the potatoes gummy or cause smaller cuts to stick 
together when cooked. The soaked potatoes must be drained and dried thoroughly with 
clean towels before deep-frying.
Deep-fried potatoes are usually blanched in oil ranging in temperature from 300–325°F 
(149–163°C) until tender and translucent. They are then drained and held for service, at 
which time they are finished in hotter oil, usually at a temperature between 350°F and 
375°F (177°C and 191°C) until they are uniformly golden brown.
Deep-frying is also used to finish cooking several classic potato dishes such as cro￾quettes and dauphine, in which fully cooked potatoes are puréed, seasoned, shaped 
and fried. Deep-fried potatoes should be drained on absorbent paper briefly and 
served immediately. See Table 23.2 for solutions to common problems when deep￾frying potatoes.
Procedure for Deep-Frying Potatoes
1 Wash, peel or trim the potatoes as desired. Cut the potatoes into uniform-sized pieces. 
rinse, drain and dry the cut potatoes.
2 Using the basket method, blanch the potatoes in deep fat at 300–325°F (149–163°C) for 
2–3 minutes, depending on the size of the pieces.
3 drain the potatoes and spread them out in a single layer on a baking sheet or in a 
hotel pan.
4 Just before service, submerge the potatoes in deep fat at 350–375°F (177–191°C), using 
the basket method, shaking the basket occasionally while the potatoes cook.
5 Cook until golden brown. remove from the fat, drain, salt to taste and serve immediately.

Boiling
Waxy potatoes are best for all moist-heat cooking methods because they hold their 
shape. Boiled potatoes (which are actually simmered) may be served as is or used 
in purées, salads, soups and baked casseroles. Potatoes are usually boiled in water, 
although stock may be used for flavor. Always begin cooking potatoes in cold liquid to 
ensure even cooking. Unlike other vegetables, potatoes should not be refreshed in cold 
water after boiling; it makes them soggy.
Procedure for Boiling Potatoes
1 Wash, peel or trim the potatoes as desired. Cut into uniform-sized pieces to promote even 
cooking. the pieces should not be too small, or they will absorb a large amount of water as 
they cook, making the final product soggy.
2 add the potatoes to enough cool liquid to cover them by several inches. Bring to a boil, 
reduce to a simmer and cook until done. if a slightly firm finished product is desired, 
remove and drain the potatoes when they are slightly underdone and allow carryover 
cooking to finish cooking them.
3 drain the potatoes in a colander and serve or use for further preparation.
4 When making mashed or puréed potatoes, the drained potatoes should be spread out on 
sheet pans and oven-dried briefly at 250°F (120°C).

IDENTIFYING, PURCHASING AND STORING GRAINS
Botanically, grains are grasses that bear edible seeds. Corn, rice and wheat are the most 
significant grasses in our diets. The fruit (i.e., the seed or kernel) and the plant of these 
common grasses are both referred to as a grain.
Most grain kernels are protected by a hull or husk. All kernels are composed of three 
distinct parts: the bran, endosperm and germ. (See Figure 23.1.) The bran is the tough outer 
layer covering the endosperm. Bran is a good source of fiber and B-complex vitamins. The 
endosperm is the largest part of the kernel and is a source of protein and carbohydrates 
(starch). It is the part used primarily in products such as flour. The germ is the smallest por￾tion of the grain and is the only part that contains fat. The germ is also rich in thiamin. The 
bran, endosperm and germ can be separated by milling. If parts of the grains have not been 
separated or removed that product is known as whole or unrefined grain.
Milling is the process of modifying a grain from its natural state to make it more 
palatable and useful for humans to consume. Milling is a repetitive process of grinding 
and sifting grains to separate the bran, endosperm and germ. Commercial grinding is 
generally done with large stainless steel rollers. Some grain products, however, are also 
available in traditional stone-ground form. This means that the grains are ground with 
a stone mill rather than by the steel rollers typically used. Stone grinders are gentler and 
more precise, so they are less likely to overgrind the grain. Stone-ground products are 
always labeled as such and are usually more expensive than steel-ground ones.
The milling stages known as cracking, hulling, grinding and pearling create different 
products with different uses and different cooking requirements.
Identifying Grains
This section presents information on corn, rice and wheat, as well as several minor 
grains that are nutritionally significant and gaining in culinary popularity.
pearling a milling process in which all or part of 
the hull, bran and germ are removed from grains
grinding a milling process in which grains 
are reduced to powder; the powder can be of 
differing degrees of fineness or coarseness
hulling a milling process in which the hull or 
husk is removed from grains
cracking a milling process in which grains are 
broken open and cut into smaller pieces

Corn
Corn (Sp. Maíz; It. Granturco) is the only grain that is also eaten fresh as a vegetable. (Fresh 
corn is discussed in Chapter 22, Vegetables.) The use of corn as a dried grain dates back 
several thousand years in Central America, long preceding its consumption as a vegetable.
Cornmeal is made by drying and grinding a special type of corn known as dent, 
which may be yellow, white or blue. Cornmeal is used in breads, as a coating for fried 
foods or cooked as polenta or mush. Products made with cornmeal have a gritty texture 
and a sweet but starchy flavor.
Hominy, also known as posole or samp, is dried corn that has been soaked in 
hydrated lime or lye. This preparation, known as nixtamalization, causes the kernels to 
swell, loosening the hulls. The hulls and germs are removed and the kernels dried. These 
white or yellow kernels resemble popcorn, but they have a soft, chewy texture and 
smoky-sour flavor. Hominy is available dried or cooked and canned. It may be served 
as a side dish or used in stews or soups. Masa harina, a finely ground flour made from 
dried hominy, is used to make breads, tortillas, tamales and other Latin American dishes.
Like masa harina, grits are traditionally made by grinding dried hominy. These small 
granules may be used in baked dishes but are most often served as a hot breakfast cereal, 
usually topped with butter or cheese. Quick-cooking and instant grits are available.
Rice
Rice (Fr. Riz; It. Riso; Sp. Arroz) is the starchy seed of a semiaquatic grass. Probably 
indigenous to the Indian subcontinent or Southeast Asia, rice is a dietary staple for more 
than half the world’s population.
Rice can be incorporated into almost any cuisine, from Asian to Spanish to classic 
French. Its flavor adapts to the foods and seasonings with which the rice is cooked 
or served. Its texture adds an appealing chewiness to meat and poultry dishes, salads, 
breads and puddings. Rice is not limited to side dishes and may be used in stews or cur￾ries; for stuffing vegetables or game birds; and in puddings, salads, beverages (such as 
Mexican horchata) and breads.
Rice is divided into three types based on seed size: long-grain, medium-grain and short￾grain. Long-grain rice is the most versatile and popular worldwide. The grains remain 
firm, fluffy and separate when cooked. (Long-grain rice can, however, become sticky if 
overcooked or stirred frequently during cooking.) Short-grain rice has more starch and 
becomes quite tender and sticky when cooked. Italian risotto, Japanese sushi and Spanish 
paella are all traditionally made with short-grain rice. The appearance and starch content of 
medium-grain rice falls somewhere in between the other two types. Medium-grain rice 
becomes sticky when cool, so it is best eaten freshly made and piping hot.
Long-grain, medium-grain and short-grain rice are available in different processed 
forms. All rice is originally brown. If the grains can be left whole, with the bran attached, 
the rice is sold as brown rice. If the grains are pearled, they are sold as white rice. 
Brown rice has a nutty flavor and chewy texture caused by the high-fiber bran. Brown 
rice absorbs more water and takes longer to cook than white rice. Both brown rice and 
white rice can be processed into converted rice and instant rice.
Converted rice is parboiled to remove the surface starch. This procedure also forces 
nutrients from the bran into the grain’s endosperm. Therefore converted rice retains 
more nutrients than regular white rice, although the flavor is the same. Converted rice 
is neither precooked nor instant; in fact, it cooks more slowly than regular white rice.
Instant or quick-cooking rice is widely available and useful if time is a concern. 
Instant rice is created by fully cooking and then flash-freezing milled rice. Unfortunately 
this processing removes some of the nutrients and flavor.
Varieties of Rice
Just as there are botanically different varieties of apples, grapes and cabbage and dif￾ferent breeds of beef cattle, many different varieties of rice are grown throughout the 
world. Flavor, texture and color differences among rice varieties are obvious, and cook￾ing time or preparation procedures may also vary according to the type of rice.
Arborio rice is a variety of rice with round, short grains. It is used primarily in Italian 
dishes such as risotto. It is very starchy or sticky, with a white color and mild flavor.

 Safety Alert
Cooked Rice
once cooked, rice is highly perishable. 
Because of its neutral pH and high protein 
content, cooked rice requires time and 
temperature control for safety (tCs). to 
avoid the risk of food-borne illnesses, be sure 
to hold hot rice at 135°F (57°C) or higher. 
Leftover rice must be quickly cooled and 
stored at 41°F (5°C) or below. Leftover rice 
can be stored for only 3 to 4 days and must 
be reheated to 165°F (74°C) or higher.
Basmati rice is one of the finest types of long-grain rice 
in the world. It grows in the Himalayan foothills and is pre￾ferred in Indian cuisine. It is highly aromatic, with a sweet, 
delicate flavor and a creamy yellow color. Basmati rice is 
usually aged at least 12 months to dry the grains so they 
stay separate and less sticky when cooked. Imported 
basmati rice should be washed well before cooking to 
remove surface starch and talc that might be used in pro￾cessing. Jasmine rice is another aromatic long-grain rice. It 
is grown in Thailand and used throughout Southeast Asia.
Bhutanese red rice, native to the Himalayan region of Bhutan, is a medium-grain rice 
with the outer deep-red bran still attached. This variety of rice has a bold, earthy flavor; 
it cooks more quickly than brown rice and should be served very moist. Its intense color 
works well in rice blends or it can be cooked alone in desserts and puddings. A traditional 
Bhutanese preparation mixes red rice with hot chiles and wild mushrooms. Other varieties 
of red rice are widely available, but this special grain is still quite rare in the United States.
Black rice refers to a number of varieties of rice high in the antioxidant anthocy￾anin, which gives it a striking black color. (The same antioxidant gives blueberries and 
eggplants their purple skins.) There are long-grain, short-grain and glutinous varieties 
of black rice, which is grown in China, India, Indonesia and Thailand. Also known as 
“forbidden rice” or emperor’s rice, black rice has a distinctive chewy texture.
Sticky rice is a short-grain rice used in many Asian cuisines. The short grains are 
fat and round with a high starch (amylopectin) content, which makes them sticky, and 
a pearly white color. When cooked, the grains tend to clump together, forming a sticky 
mass. Sticky rice must be soaked for several hours before being cooked. Also known as 
sweet rice or glutinous rice (it does not contain gluten; the term refers to its texture), sticky 
rice can be ground into flour and used for dumplings and pastries. Japanese sake and 
mirin and Chinese Shaoxing wine are made from fermented sticky rice, as is rice vinegar.
Wild rice is prepared in the same manner as traditional rice, although wild rice is actu￾ally the seed of a reedlike aquatic plant indigenous to North America and unrelated to rice. 
Wild rice has long, slender grains with a dark brown to black color. It has a nuttier flavor 
and chewier texture than traditional rice. Three grades of wild rice are avail￾able: giant (the best quality, with very long grains), fancy (a medium-sized 
grain, suitable for most purposes) and select (a short grain, suitable for 
soups, pancakes or baked goods). Wild-grown wild rice is sacred to 
Indigenous peoples and legally it may only be harvested by members 
of the Ojibwe tribe using traditional methods. Cultivated wild rice is 
now produced in California, Canada, Minnesota and Washington. It 
is often served with game, used as a stuffing for poultry or combined 
with regular rice for a side dish. Wild rice is expensive, but small quantities 
are usually sufficient.
Guidelines for Cooking Rice
Rice may be rinsed before cooking to remove surface starch, dirt and debris, but doing 
so also removes some of its nutrients. Rice may also be soaked before cooking. Soaking 
softens the grains, removes some starch and speeds cooking.
The standard ratio for cooking rice is two parts liquid to one part rice. The actual ratio 
varies, however, depending on the type of rice. Guidelines for cooking rice are found 
in Table 23.3.
Wheat
Wheat (Fr. blé) is most often milled into the wide range of flours discussed in Chapter 30, 
Principles of the Bakeshop. But wheat and products derived from it are also used as starchy 
side dishes or as ingredients in soups, salads, ground meat dishes and breads. These prod￾ucts include wheat berries, cracked wheat, bulgur and couscous. When cooked, they are 
slightly chewy with a mild flavor. All should be fluffy, not soggy or sticky.
Wheat germ and wheat bran are highly touted for their nutritional values. Bran and 
germ are not generally used plain but may be added to bread or other cooked dishes.

israeli couscous (ptitim)
Wheat berries refers to complete wheat kernels. The berries are high in starch, 
fiber and vitamins but require soaking followed by long cooking, usually by boiling, 
before they are tender enough to eat in side dishes and salads. Cracked wheat is the 
 whole-wheat kernel broken into varying degrees of coarseness. The kernels’ white inte￾riors should be visible in cracked wheat. The bran and germ are still intact, so cracked 
wheat has a great deal of fiber but a short shelf life because the bran is perishable. 
Cracked wheat must be soaked for several hours before it can be fully cooked by long, 
gentle simmering. Neither wheat berries nor cracked wheat are precooked.
Bulgur is wheat berries with their bran removed then steam-cooked, dried and ground 
into varying degrees of coarseness. Bulgur has a nutlike flavor and texture; it is a uni￾form golden-brown color (uncooked cracked wheat is not) and cooks more quickly than 
cracked wheat. Generally cracked wheat and bulgur cannot be substituted for one another 
in recipes.
Bulgur can be mixed with boiling hot water, covered and left to soak for 10–15 minutes, 
then drained for use in salads. Bulgur can be briefly cooked when used in stews or 
pilafs. Bulgur is good as an accompaniment to grilled meats and as an alternative to rice 
in stuffings and other dishes. The fine grind is most often used in packaged products 
such as those for tabouli; the medium grind is most often available in bulk.
Couscous is made from coarsely ground semolina flour from hard durum wheat ber￾ries. The semolina is moistened and rolled until small pellets form, then dried. Couscous 
is available in varying degrees of coarseness and is prepared by steaming over water or 
stock in a pot called a couscoussier. Couscous, traditionally served with North African 
stews, can be used or served like rice.
Israeli couscous, more accurately known as ptitim, is a toasted wheat pasta usually 
shaped as small spheres or large grains of rice. It was developed under the direction 
of the Israeli government during the 1950s as a substitute for rice, which was scarce. 
Today’s ptitim is available in various colors and extruded into shapes such as stars, rings 
or hearts. The individual pieces are relatively large and cooked by boiling until al dente, 
rather than the steaming method used for North African couscous. Ptitim is often pre￾pared like rice pilaf; first sautéed in butter or olive oil, then simmered in water or stock 
and seasoned with herbs as a side dish or used in cold vegetable salads.
Other Grains
Many types of grain are consumed throughout the 
world. Although some grains such as barley and oats 
are commonly prepared in the United States, oth￾ers such as amaranth and teff are just beginning 
to gain popularity for the flavor, texture and 
nutritional value they add to dishes.
Amaranth is the tiny oval seeds of a type of 
annual plant native to South America. These high￾protein seeds are consumed as a cooked grain or 
ground into flour. When cooked, amaranth remains pleasantly 
durum wheat a species of very hard wheat with 
a particularly high amount of protein; it is used 
to make couscous or milled into semolina flour, 
which is used for making pasta
al dente [al den-tay] italian for “to the tooth”; 
used to describe a food, usually pasta, that 
is cooked only until it gives a slight resistance 
when one bites into it

crunchy. Because of its high starch content, amaranth should be cooked in a generous 
amount of water then rinsed before using.
Barley is one of the oldest culinary grains, eaten by humans since prehistoric times. 
Barley is extremely hardy and is cultivated in climates from the tropics to the near-Arctic. 
Although much of the barley crop is used to make beer or feed animals, some does find 
its way into soups, stews and stuffings. The most common type is pearled to produce a 
small, round white nugget of endosperm. Barley has a sweet, earthy flavor similar to oats 
and goes well with onions, garlic and strong herbs. Barley’s texture ranges from chewy 
to soft, depending on the amount of water in which it is cooked. Its starchiness can be 
used to thicken soups or stews.
Buckwheat is not a type of wheat; it is not even a grain. Rather it is the fruit of a 
plant distantly related to rhubarb. We include buckwheat here, however, because it is 
prepared and served in the same manner as grains.
The whole buckwheat kernel is known as a groat. The product most often sold as 
buckwheat is actually kasha, which is hulled, roasted buckwheat groats. Kasha is red￾dish brown with a strong, nutty, almost scorched flavor. It is available whole or ground 
to varying degrees of coarseness. Whole kasha grains remain separate after cooking, but 
finer grinds become rather sticky. Kasha can be served as a side dish, usually combined 
with pasta or vegetables, or it can be chilled and used in salads.
Raw buckwheat groats are ground into flour used in pasta, blini and other pancakes. 
Buckwheat flour contains no gluten-forming proteins, and it tends to remain grainy, with 
a sandy texture. Therefore it should not be substituted for all the wheat flour in breads 
or baked goods.
Flax is a grain plant also known as linseed. When flax hulls and seeds are crushed 
into a meal or flour, they release beneficial compounds, such as Omega-3 fatty acids, a 
compound also found in oily fish, purported to promote heart and arterial health. Flax 
seeds can be incorporated in bread products to add flavor, crunchiness and nutrition. 
Because of their high fat content, flax seeds are generally stored under refrigeration.
Millet is a high-protein cereal grain with a bland, slightly nutty flavor and a white 
color. Used principally as animal feed in the United States, millet can be cooked and 
eaten like rice or toasted like buckwheat and cooked like groats. It can also be ground for 
flour. Millet is usually sold with its extremely hard husk removed. The variety known as 
fonio is widely used in Western Africa as a side dish (see West African-Style Groundnut 
Soup, page 310) or a hot breakfast porridge. Fonio grows quickly in poor soil or drought 
conditions. Its tiny kernels are gluten-free but high in iron, protein and B vitamins.
After rice, oats are probably the most widely accepted whole-grain product in the 
North American diet. Oats are consumed as a hot breakfast cereal (oatmeal) and are used 
in breads, muffins, cookies and other baked goods.
An oat groat is the whole oat kernel with only the husk removed. It contains both 
the bran and germ. Steel-cut oats, sometimes known as Irish oats, are groats that are 
toasted and then cut into small pieces with steel blades. Rolled oats, marketed as 
“ old-fashioned oats,” are groats that have been steamed, then rolled into flat flakes. 
Quick-cooking oats are rolled oats cut into smaller pieces to reduce cooking time. 
Instant oats are partially cooked and dried before rolling so that they need only 
to be rehydrated in boiling water. Rolled oats and quick-cooking oats can be used 
interchangeably, but instant oats should not be substituted for them in most recipes.
Oat bran is the outer covering of a hulled oat. It is available 
as a separate product, although rolled and cut oats do contain 
some oat bran.
The processed groats known as oatmeal are a gray-white 
color with a starchy texture and sweet flavor. They cook into 
the soft, thick porridge with a robust flavor also called oatmeal.
Quinoa [KEEN-wa] is native to the South American 
Andes and was a common food of the Incas, who referred 
to it as the “mother grain.” Although not botanically a true grain, 
quinoa’s tiny seeds can be prepared like a grain. The grains (seeds) are small, flattened 
spheres, approximately 1
⁄16 inch (1.5 millimeters) in diameter, ringed with the germ. 
They become translucent when cooked and have a slightly smoky or sesamelike flavor.

teff flour
Several varieties are available, but larger, whiter varieties are most common and are con￾sidered superior.
Quinoa seeds have a natural, bitter-tasting coating. They should be placed in a 
 fine-meshed colander and rinsed well with cool water for several minutes before use. 
Quinoa is cooked like rice and will absorb about twice its volume of water. For a nut￾tier taste, toast the grain in a hot dry pan for about 5 minutes before adding the liquid. 
Quinoa is gluten free and can be eaten as a hot breakfast cereal, served in lieu of rice, 
used as a thickener for soups or stews and in salads, casseroles, breads and desserts. 
Quinoa flour, ground from whole seeds, has a delicate nutty flavor.
Quinoa is marketed as the world’s “supergrain” because the seeds form a complete 
protein (with all of the essential amino acids) and contain important vitamins and minerals 
as well as carbohydrates and fat. Quinoa should be kept in the refrigerator or freezer for 
long-term storage.
Teff is the seed of a species of grass native to North Africa. Teff is a staple in the tra￾ditional Eritrean and Ethiopian cultures. The feather-light grains resemble poppy seeds. 
When ground into flour, teff is used to make the sourdough flatbread call injera served with 
Ethiopian stews. Featuring a distinctive nutty flavor, teff is high in calcium, iron and protein.
Nutritional Information for Grains
Grains are an excellent source of vitamins, minerals, proteins and fiber. The amount 
of milling or refining and the method of preparation affect their nutritional values, 
however. Unrefined or whole grains are excellent sources of dietary fiber because the 
bran is still attached. The bran is also rich in B vitamins, iron, zinc and antioxidants. 
Whole unrefined grains contain the germ, which is the source of healthy fats, along 
with vitamin E, B vitamins, phytochemicals and antioxidants. Rice is also quite nutri￾tious: It is low in sodium and calories and contains all the essential amino acids. Some 
grains, especially white rice and oats, are usually enriched with calcium, iron and 
B-complex vitamins.
Purchasing and Storing Grains
When buying grains, look for fresh, plump kernels with a bright, even color. Fresh grains 
should not be shriveled or crumbly; there should be no sour or musty odors.
All grains should be stored in airtight containers placed in a dark, cool, dry place. 
Airtight containers prevent dust and insects from entering. Airtight containers and darkness 
also reduce nutrient loss caused by oxidation or light. Coolness inhibits insect infestation; 
dryness prevents mold. Grains in vacuum-sealed packages will last for extended periods. 
Whole grains, which contain the oily germ, can be refrigerated to prevent rancidity.
COOKING METHODS FOR GRAINS
Three basic cooking methods are used to prepare grains: simmering, risotto and pilaf. 
Unlike simmered grains, those cooked by either the risotto or pilaf method are first 
coated with hot fat. The primary distinction between the pilaf and risotto methods is the 
manner in which the liquid is then added to the grains. (See Figure 23.2.) When grains 
are used in puddings, breads, stuffings and baked casseroles, they are almost always first 
fully cooked by one of these methods.
Most grains should be cooked until tender, although a chewier product is preferred for 
some dishes. Doneness can usually be determined by cooking time and the amount of liquid 
remaining in the pan. Some grains, such as wild rice, are fully cooked when they puff open.
Farro
Ancient Grains 
for Modern Times
as an awareness of the nutritional benefits 
of eating whole grains grows, long￾neglected grains are regaining popularity 
with chefs and consumers. Farro (Triticum 
dicoccum) is one of the oldest forms of 
wheat. also known as emmer, it was 
a staple in the diet of ancient roman 
armies. Farro is still eaten cooked as a 
whole grain in tuscany, where it is prized 
for its chewy, nutty flavor. Spelt (Triticum 
aestivum var. spelta), a related subspecies of 
common wheat, is also prized for its taste 
and consistency. spelt must be soaked 
like beans before cooking, whereas farro 
may be cooked without soaking. (Milled 
or pearled versions are available and will 
cook more quickly.) treat these grains like 
barley. Use them to add texture to soups 
or cook them to add a meaty texture to 
salads and vegetable dishes.

In general grains are fully cooked when almost all the cooking liquid has been 
absorbed. This is indicated by the appearance of tunnel-like holes between the grains. 
Grains can be cooked until almost all of the liquid is absorbed, then removed from 
the heat and left to stand, covered, for 5–10 minutes. This allows the cooked grains to 
absorb the remaining moisture without burning. Consult Table 23.4 for guidelines on 
cooking grains. Yields from cooked rice and grains differ because grains absorb different 
quantities of liquid. Most grain serving sizes in recipes in this text are calculated based 
on ¾-cup (180-milliliter) servings. In the case of rice and many other cooked grains, a 
¾-cup (180-milliliter) serving weighs 4 ounces (120 grams).
Simmering
The most common method for preparing grains is simmering in water on the stove top. 
The grains can be flavored by using stock as the cooking liquid. Herbs and spices can 
also be added during simmering. Simmering is used to prepare grains such as rice served 
as a side dish. Simmering is also the method used to cook grains such as oatmeal or other 
porridge served for breakfast. (The procedure for simmering grains for porridge or break￾fast is illustrated with the recipe for Oatmeal with Bananas and Almond Butter, page 615.)

Risotto Method
Risotto is a classic northern Italian rice dish in which the grains remain firm but merge 
with the cooking liquid to become a creamy, almost pudding-like dish. True risotto is 
made with a short-grain starchy rice such as Arborio, but the risotto method can also be 
used to cook other grains such as barley and oats.
The grains are not rinsed before cooking, as this removes the starches needed to 
achieve the desired consistency. The grains are coated, but not cooked, in a hot fat 
such as butter or oil. A hot liquid is gradually added to the grains so that the mixture 
is kept at a constant simmer. The cooking liquid should be a rich, flavorful stock. 
Unlike simmering and the pilaf method, the risotto method requires frequent, some￾times constant, stirring.
When finished, the grains should be creamy and tender, but still al dente (firm but 
tender) in the center. Grated cheese, heavy cream, cooked meat, poultry, fish, shellfish, 
herbs and vegetables can be added to create a flavorful side dish or a complete meal.
Procedure for Preparing Grains by the Risotto Method
1 Bring the cooking liquid (usually a stock) to a simmer.
2 Heat the fat in a heavy saucepan over medium heat. add any onions, garlic or other 
flavoring ingredients and sauté for 1–2 minutes without browning.
3 add the grains to the saucepan. stir well to make sure the grains are well coated with fat. 
do not allow the grains to brown.
4 add any wine and cook until it is fully absorbed.
5 Begin to add the simmering stock, 4 fluid ounces (120 milliliters) at a time, stirring frequently. 
Wait until each portion of cooking liquid is almost fully absorbed before adding the next.
6 test for doneness after the grains have cooked for approximately 18–20 minutes.
7 remove from the heat and stir in butter, grated cheese, herbs or other flavoring ingredients 
as directed. Garnish and serve immediately.

Risotto Milanese
In Italy, risotto and pasta dishes are usually served as a separate course (primo piatto) preceding the main 
dish (secondo piatto) and following the appetizer (antipasto). Like pasta, risotto is a vehicle for many 
flavors; it can be made with lemon juice or red wine and include bitter greens, seafood or wild mushrooms. 
This saffron-flavored risotto is often paired with Osso Buco (page 401), rich stewed veal shank.

Pilaf Method
For the pilaf method, raw grains are lightly sautéed in oil or butter, usually with onions 
or seasonings for additional flavor. A measured amount of hot liquid, often a stock, is 
then added. The pan is covered and the mixture is left to simmer without stirring until 
the liquid is absorbed and the grains are tender.

Stir-Fried Rice
Stir-fried or simply fried rice is a technique applied in many cuisines for using cold left￾over rice. Thoroughly chilling the rice separates the grains and keeps the fried rice from 
becoming sticky during cooking.
Procedure for Preparing Fried Rice

for safety (tCs) procedures.
2 Heat a wok over medium heat. sauté any meat or fish in oil or butter as directed. add 
aromatics and vegetables. stir-fry until the vegetables are nearly tender. remove from 
the pan.
3 add the rice to the pan and stir-fry until warmed through.
4 Make a well in the center of the rice and pour in the eggs, if using. Cook the eggs until 
almost set before mixing them into the rice
5 add the reserved aromatics, meats, fish and vegetables along with any additional 
seasonings. stir-fry over high heat to an internal temperature of 165°F (74°C).

IDENTIFYING, PURCHASING AND STORING PASTA
Pasta is made from an unleavened dough of flour mixed with a liquid. The liquid is usu￾ally egg and/or water. The flour can be from almost any grain: wheat, buckwheat, rice or 
a combination of grains. The dough can be colored and flavored with puréed vegetables, 
herbs or other ingredients, and it can be rolled and cut or extruded, that is, pressed 
through metal dyes by machine, into a wide variety of shapes and sizes.
Pasta can be cooked fresh while the dough is still moist and pliable, or the dough can 
be allowed to dry completely before cooking. Pasta can be filled or sauced in an endless 
variety of ways. It can stand alone or be used in salads, desserts, soups or casseroles.
Pasta is common in the cuisines of Asia, North America and Europe. In Italy, pasta 
dishes are usually served as a separate course, often referred to as the minestra or primo 
piatto (first course). In other European countries, Asia and the United States, pasta dishes 
are served as appetizers, entrées or side dishes.
Identifying Pasta
The pastas that are most familiar in western cuisines are based on the Italian tradition of 
kneading wheat flour with water and eggs to form a smooth, resilient dough. This dough 
is rolled very thin and cut into ribbons or shaped before being boiled in water or dried 
for longer storage.
Commercially prepared dried pasta products are usually made with semolina flour. 
Semolina flour, ground from hard durum wheat, has a rich golden color and a high protein 
content that produces a very durable dough. Semolina dough requires a great deal of knead￾ing, however, and bread flour is an acceptable substitute when preparing pasta by hand.
Asian pasta, generally known as noodles, is made from wheat, rice, bean or buck￾wheat flour. Asian noodles can be used when fresh or dried.
Italian-Style Pasta
The finest Italian-style pastas made commercially are those made with pure semolina 
flour, which gives the dough a rich, yellow color. Pasta dough that is gray or streaked 
probably was made from softer flours. Dried pasta should be very hard and break with a 
clean snap. The surface should be lightly pitted or dull. (A smooth or glossy surface will 
not hold or absorb sauces as well.)
Dried pasta is available in a wide range of flavors and shapes. In addition to the tra￾ditional white (plain), green (spinach) and red (tomato) pastas, manufacturers also offer 
flavor combinations such as lemon-peppercorn, whole-wheat–basil and carrot-ginger.

The Macaroni Myth
the popular myth holds that noodles were first 
invented in China and introduced to italy (and 
from there the rest of europe) by the Venetian 
explorer Marco Polo during the 13th century. 
although there is little doubt that the Chinese 
were making noodles by the first century 
Ce, it is now equally clear that they were not 
alone. Middle eastern and italian cooks were 
preparing macaroni long before Marco Polo’s 
adventures. a clear reference to boiled noodles 
appears in the Jerusalem Talmud of the fifth 
century BCe. there rabbis debated whether 
noodles violated Jewish dietary laws (they do, 
but only during Passover). tenth-century arabic 
writings refer to dried noodles purchased from 
vendors. Literary references establish that 
dishes called lasagna, macaroni and ravioli were 
all well known (and costly) in italy by the mid￾13th century.
Pasta’s more recent popularity dates from 
the 18th century, when mass production 
by machine began in naples, italy. english 
gentlemen on their “grand tours” of the 
european continent developed a fondness 
for pasta. Macaroni arrived in america 
with english colonists, who preferred it 
with cream sauce and cheese or in a sweet 
custard. domestic factories soon opened 
in the United states, and by the Civil War 
(1861–1865), macaroni was available to 
the working class. Pasta became a staple of 
the american middle-class diet following 
the wave of italian immigrants in the late 
19th century.
during the 1980s pasta became ubiquitous. 
restaurants began serving it in ways previously 
unimagined. Corner grocery stores and local 
supermarkets began offering at least a dozen 
different shapes, often fresh and sometimes 
flavored. dedicated cooks began to make 
pasta from scratch, though they sometimes 
tossed it with bottled sauce. Many also became 
interested in asian noodles. Chinese, Japanese, 
Korean and thai restaurants expanded their 
menu offerings to include traditional noodle 
dishes. Pasta’s popularity continues to grow as 
chefs continue to explore the versatility of this 
inexpensive, nutritious food.

 There are hundreds of recognized shapes of pasta. When experiment￾ing with unusual flavors and shapes, be sure to consider the taste and 
appearance of the final dish after the sauce and any garnishes are added. 
 Italian-style pasta can be divided into three groups based on shape: 
ribbons, tubes and shapes. There is no consistent English nomenclature 
for these pastas; the Italian names are recognized and applied virtually 
worldwide. (A specific shape or size may be given different 
names in different regions of Italy, 
however. These distinctions are 
beyond the scope of this text.) 
 Pasta dough can be extruded or 
rolled very thin and cut into strips 
or ribbons of various widths, from 
large strips used for lasagna to 
very thin ribbons of spaghetti and 
linguine . All ribbon shapes work well 
with smooth sauces made with cheese or 
puréed tomatoes as well as fish and shellfish 
sauces. Wider ribbons, such as fettuccine , are preferred with smooth, silky 
cream or cheese sauces. 
 Cylindrical forms or tubes of pasta are made by extrusion. The hollow tubes 
can be curved or straight, fluted or smooth and are produced in many sizes. 
Short tubes such as rigatoni and penne are preferred for chunky meat and 
vegetable sauces and are often used in baked casseroles. Larger tubes such as 
manicotti can be cooked, then stuffed with meat or cheese fillings and baked 
or served as a casserole. 
 Whole wheat spaghetti 
 Farfalle 
 ditalini stars or stelline 
 The extrusion process can also be used to shape pasta dough in countless ways. The 
curves and textures produced provide nooks and crevices that hold sauces well. Shaped 
pastas, such as conchiglie, farfalle and fusilli, are preferred with meat sauces and 
 oil-based sauces such as pesto. Very small pasta shapes, such as ditalini and stelline , 
are typically used in soups.

orzo
rice vermicelli
Orzo is a specialty pasta made from semolina flour. It is often mistaken for rice 
because of its small oval shape. It is cooked like other pastas and can be used in soups 
and pasta salads, as well as seasoned and served as a side dish.
Asian Noodles
Asian noodles are not cut into the same variety of shapes and sizes as Italian-style 
pasta, nor are they flavored or colored with vegetable purées, herbs or other ingredients. 
Differences arise because of the type of flour used for the dough.
Virtually all Asian noodles are ribbons—some thin, some thick—folded into bundles 
and sold fresh or dried.
Most dried Asian noodles benefit by soaking in hot water for several minutes before 
further preparation. The water softens the noodle strands; the bundles separate and the 
noodles cook more evenly.
Wheat noodles, also known as egg noodles, are the most widely 
available of the Asian-style noodles. They are thin, flat 
noodles with a springy texture; they are available fresh or 
dried. Dried egg noodles can be deep-fried after 
boiling to create crisp golden noodles (chow 
mein) used primarily as a garnish. Japanese 
wheat noodles, known as somen (if thin) 
and udon (if thick), may be round, square 
or flat. They are eaten in broth or with a dip￾ping sauce.
Rice noodles are thin dried noodles made 
with rice flour. They should be soaked in hot 
water before cooking and rinsed in cool running water 
after boiling to remove excess starch and prevent sticking. Rice noodles are often 
served in soups or sautéed.
Rice vermicelli, which has very fine strands, can be fried in hot oil without presoak￾ing. In only a few seconds, the strands turn white, puff up and become crunchy. Mounds 
of crunchy rice noodles can be used as a base for sautéed dishes or for presenting hors 
d’oeuvre.
Bean starch noodles, also known as spring rain noodles, bean threads or cel￾lophane noodles, are thin, transparent noodles made from mung beans. Dried bean 
noodles can be fried in the same manner as rice vermicelli. If not fried, they must be 
soaked in hot water before using in soups, stir-fries or braised dishes.
Buckwheat noodles are traditional in the cooler climates of northern Asia where 
buckwheat grows well. Buckwheat flour is used in northern Japan and the Tokyo region, 
where buckwheat noodles are known as soba noodles. Soba noodles are available fresh 
or dried and do not need soaking before cooking. They are traditionally served in broth 
or with a dipping sauce but may be substituted for Italian-style pasta if desired. A thinner, 
chewier buckwheat noodle is used in Korean cuisine for the popular naengmyeon, a bowl 
of noodles in an icy broth with various toppings, such as thin slices of beef and julienned 
fresh vegetables.

Nutritional Information for Pasta
Pastas are a healthy choice in a balanced diet because they are very low in sodium and fat 
(and cholesterol free if made without eggs). Wheat pasta is a good source of B vitamins, 
minerals, proteins and carbohydrates. Purchased pastas and noodles are sometimes enriched 
with additional nutrients, such as folate and vitamin D. In addition to the wheat flour-based 
pastas discussed in this text, manufacturers now offer Italian-style pastas made from other 
flours such as rice, potato, bean or lentil flour. These alternatives may be gluten free and suit￾able for those with a wheat protein allergy and can provide other nutritional benefits.
Purchasing and Storing Pasta
Pasta products are purchased by weight, either fresh or dried. Tubes and shapes are not 
generally available fresh. Dried products, by far the most common, are available in boxes 
or bags that can be stored in a cool, dry place for several months. Fresh pasta can be stored 
in an airtight wrapping in the refrigerator for a few days or in the freezer for a few weeks.
MAKING FRESH PASTA
Fresh pasta is easy to make, requiring almost no special equipment and only a few staples. 
The dough can be mixed by hand for small batches or in a mixer. Mixing by hand allows 
the chef to get a feel for the dough, adjusting the amount of flour added as needed.
➊ Mound the flour on a workbench. Make a 
well in the center. Place the eggs in the well and

YIELD 4 lb. (1.9 kg)
Eggs 15 15
Olive oil 1 fl. oz. 30 ml
Salt 1 Tbsp. 15 ml
Bread flour* 2 lb. 8 oz. 1.2 kg
1 Place the eggs, oil and salt in a large mixer bowl. Use the paddle attachment to combine.
2 add one-third of the flour and stir until the mixture begins to form a soft dough. remove the 
paddle attachment and attach the dough hook.
3 Gradually add more flour until the dough is dry and cannot absorb any more flour.
4 remove the finished dough from the mixer, wrap it well with plastic wrap and set it aside at room 
temperature for 20–30 minutes.
5 after the dough has rested, roll it into flat sheets by hand or with a pasta machine. Work with only 
a small portion at a time, keeping the remainder well covered to prevent it from drying out.
6 While the sheets of dough are pliable, cut them into the desired width with a chef ’s knife or pasta 
machine. sheets can also be used for making ravioli, as illustrated next.
*semolina flour can be substituted for all or part of the bread flour in this recipe, although it makes a 
stronger dough that is more difficult to work with by hand.

Dumplings
a dumpling is a small mound of dough 
steamed or simmered in a flavorful liquid. 
dumplings are found in many cuisines: 
Chinese wontons, German spaetzle, 
italian gnocchi, Jewish matzo balls, Polish 
pierogi and russian pelmeni. dumplings 
can be sweet or savory, plain or filled.
Plain or drop dumplings are made 
with breadlike dough, often leavened 
with yeast or chemical leavening agents. 
they should be light and tender but firm 
enough to hold their shape when cooked. 
drop dumplings may be served with stews 
or broths or coated with butter or sauce 
as an appetizer or side dish.
Filled dumplings are made by 
wrapping noodle dough around seasoned 
meat, vegetables, cheese or fruit. these 
parcels are then steamed, fried or baked 
and served as a snack food, appetizer or 
side dish. a recipe for deep-fried wontons 
is included in Chapter 29, Hors d’oeuvre.

The basic form for pasta dough is the sfoglia, a thin, flat sheet of dough that is cut 
into ribbons, circles or squares. Sheets of fresh pasta dough can be filled and shaped to 
create ravioli, cappelletti and tortellini. Filled pasta is usually served with a light cream or 
tomato sauce that complements the filling’s flavors.
Although pasta dough can be kneaded by hand, stretched and rolled with a rolling 
pin and cut with a chef’s knife, pasta machines make these tasks easier. Pasta machines 
are either electric or manual. Some electric models mix and knead the dough, then 
extrude it through a cutting disk. These electric extrusion machines are most practical 
in a food service operation that regularly serves large quantities of pasta. Small pasta 
machines are operated manually with a hand crank. Their two rollers knead, press and 
push the dough into a thin, uniform sheet. Adjacent cutting rollers slice the thin dough 
into various widths for fettuccine, spaghetti, capellini and the like.
Procedure for Rolling and Cutting Pasta Dough
1 Work with a small portion of the dough. Leave the rest covered with plastic wrap to prevent 
it from drying out.
2 Flatten the dough with the heel of your hand.
3 set the pasta machine rollers to their widest setting. insert the dough and turn the handle 
with one hand while supporting the dough with the other hand. Pass the entire piece of 
dough through the rollers.
4 dust the dough with flour, fold it in thirds and pass it through the pasta machine again.
5 repeat the folding and rolling procedure until the dough is smooth. this may require four 
to six passes.
6 tighten the rollers one or two marks, then pass the dough through the machine. Without 
folding it in thirds, pass the dough through the machine repeatedly, tightening the rollers 
one or two marks each time.
7 When the dough is thin enough to see your hand through it, but not so thin that it begins 
to tear, it is ready to use or cut into ribbons. this sheet is the sfoglia.
8 to cut the sfoglia into ribbons, gently feed a manageable length of dough through the 
desired cutting blades.
9 Lay out the pasta in a single layer on a sheet pan dusted with flour to dry. Layers of pasta 
ribbons can be separated with parchment paper.
➊ Pass the entire piece of dough through the 
pasta machine.
➋ Fold the dough in thirds. ➌ Pass the dough through the pasta machine 
to achieve the desired thickness.
➍ Use the pasta machine to cut the dough to 
the desired width.

tortellini
Filling Pasta
Sheets of raw pasta dough can be filled or folded to create ravioli (circles or squares), 
tortellini (round “hats” with a brim of dough), mezzelune (circles of dough folded into 
half-moons), agnolotti (squares of dough folded into rectangles), cappelletti (squares 
of dough folded and shaped into rings) and other shapes. The filled pieces of dough are 
cooked in boiling water using the procedure for cooking pasta ribbons discussed later. 
The filling can include almost anything—cheese, herbs, vegetables, fish, shellfish, meat 
or poultry. It can be uncooked or precooked. Any meat filling should be fully cooked 
before the pasta is assembled, as the time it takes for the dough to cook may not be suf￾ficient to cook the filling.
Some pasta shapes are cooked first, then filled. Cannelloni is a large square of cooked 
dough that is wrapped around a meat or cheese filling and baked. Lasagna are wide, flat 
sheets of pasta that are cooked and then layered with cheese, tomato sauce and meat or 
vegetables as desired. The finished casserole is baked and cut into portions.
Some of the larger, commercially prepared pasta shapes such as large shells (conchi￾glioni or rigate) or large tubes (manicotti) can be partially cooked in boiling water, then 
filled, sauced and baked as a casserole.
Asian noodle dough is also made into filled items such as dumplings, wontons, egg 
rolls (made with egg noodle dough) and spring rolls (made with rice paper). These items 
are usually steamed, pan-fried or deep-fried. When making filled pasta, consider the 
flavors and textures of the filling, dough and sauce. Each should complement the others.

Procedure for Preparing Ravioli
1 Prepare a basic pasta dough.
2 Prepare and chill the desired filling.
3 roll out two thin sheets of dough between the rollers of a pasta machine. Gently lay the 
dough flat on the work surface.
4 Using a piping bag or a small portion scoop, place small mounds of filling on one of the 
dough pieces. space the filling evenly, allowing approximately 2 inches (5 centimeters) 
between each mound.
5 Brush the exposed areas of dough with water.
6 Gently place the second sheet of dough over the mounds and press firmly around each 
mound to remove air pockets and seal the dough.
7 Cut between the mounds with a chef ’s knife, pastry wheel or circular cutter.

COOKING METHODS FOR PASTA
Italian-style pastas are properly cooked when they are al dente, firm but tender. Cooking 
times vary depending on the shape and quantity of pasta, the amount of water used, 
the hardness of the water and even the altitude. Fresh pasta cooks rapidly, sometimes 
in seconds. Noodles and dried pasta may require several minutes to cook. Unlike Italian 
pasta, Asian noodles are not served al dente. Rather, they are either boiled until very soft 
or stir-fried until very crisp.
Although package or recipe directions offer some guidance, the only way to accu￾rately test doneness is to bite into a piece. When the pasta is slightly firmer than desired, 
remove it from the stove and drain. It will continue to cook through residual heat.
Boiling
All Italian-style pasta and most Asian noodles are cooked by boiling. The secret to boil￾ing pasta successfully is to use plenty of water. Allow 1 gallon (4 liters) of water for each 
pound (450 grams) of pasta.
Use a saucepan or stockpot large enough to allow the pasta to move freely in the 
boiling water; otherwise the starch released by the dough makes the pasta gummy and 
sticky. Bring water to a rapid boil, add enough salt to give the water a distinct saltiness. 
A salinity from 1% to 2% is recommended. This means that for every quart (liter) of 
water, add from 1½ teaspoons to 1 Tablespoon (0.3 to 0.6 ounce/10 to 20 grams) of salt. 
Pasta absorbs water and salt during cooking. Adding salt to the pasta after it is cooked 
will not provide the same seasoning effect. After adding salt to the water, add all the 
pasta at once.
Chefs disagree on whether to add oil to the cooking water. Purists argue against add￾ing oil, on the theory that it makes the dough absorb water unevenly. Others think oil 
should be added to reduce surface foam. Another theory is that oil keeps the pasta from 
sticking, although this works only when added to cooked, drained pasta.
Asian noodles may be prepared by boiling until fully cooked, or they may be par￾boiled and then stir-fried with other ingredients to finish cooking.
 Procedure for Cooking Pasta to Order
1 Bring the appropriate amount of water to a boil over high heat.
2 add the salt and pasta to the rapidly boiling water. add oil to the water if desired.
3 stir the pasta to prevent it from sticking together. Bring the water back to a boil and cook 
until the pasta is done.
4 When the pasta is properly cooked, immediately drain it through a colander. a small amount 
of oil may be gently tossed into the pasta if desired to prevent it from sticking together.
5 serve hot pasta immediately or refresh it in cold water for later use in salads or other 
dishes. (do not rinse pasta that is being served immediately and hot.)
Procedure for Cooking Dried Pasta in Advance
Fresh pasta is so delicate and cooks so rapidly (sometimes in as little as 15 seconds) that it 
should be cooked to order. dried pasta, however, can be cooked in advance for quantity service.
1 Follow the preceding directions for cooking pasta but stop the cooking process when the 
pasta is about two-thirds done.
2 drain the pasta, rinse it lightly and toss it in a small amount of oil.
3 divide the pasta into appropriate-sized portions. individual portions can be wrapped in 
plastic or laid on a sheet pan and covered. refrigerate until needed.
4 When needed, place a portion in a pasta-cooking basket or china cap and immerse in 
boiling water to reheat. drain, add sauce and serve immediately.

 Accompaniments to Pasta 
 Pasta is popular with diners and easily incorporated in a variety of cuisines—from Italian 
and Chinese to Eastern European. It can be served in broths; as a bed for stews, fish, 
shellfish, poultry or meat; or tossed with sauce. Creative chefs are constantly developing 
nontraditional but delicious ways of serving pasta. 
 Cooked pasta is best eaten with some form of sauce or liquid accompaniment. There 
are hundreds of traditional Italian pasta sauces as well as modern sauces for Italian-style 
pasta, but most can be divided into six categories: ragus, seafood sauces, vegetable 
sauces, cream sauces, garlic-oil sauces and uncooked sauces. Recipes for a selection of 
pasta sauces are included in Chapter 11 , Stocks and Sauces.
 Small pasta shapes can be cooked in a broth with which they will be served, or the 
pasta can be cooked separately, then added to the hot broth at service time. Soups such 
as cappelletti in brodo and chicken noodle are examples. 
 Although there are no firm rules governing the combinations of sauces and pasta, 
 Table 23. 5 offers some of the more common combinations.

More than 
a French Fry
thanks to the genius of Carême, escoffier 
and others, few vegetables have as 
extensive a classic repertoire as potatoes. 
some of these dishes begin with the 
duchesse [duh-sHees] potatoes mixture; 
in this regard, duchesse potatoes can be 
considered the mother of many classic 
potato preparations. For example:
duchesse + tomato concassée =
Marquis
duchesse + Chopped truffles +
almond coating + deep-frying = Berny
duchesse + shaping + Breading +
deep-frying = Croquettes
duchesse + Pâte à choux = Dauphine
dauphine + Grated Parmesan + Piped 
shape + deep-frying = Lorette

1 Cut the potatoes into uniform-sized pieces. Cover with water. add the salt and simmer the pota￾toes until tender. drain the potatoes well and spread on a sheet pan. Place the pan in a 300°F 
(150°C) oven for 5 minutes to dry the potatoes well. remove the potatoes from the oven and 
immediately pass them through a ricer or food mill into a stainless steel bowl.
2 add the beaten egg and yolks, salt, pepper, clarified butter and nutmeg to the potatoes and mix 
until incorporated. add half the flour to the bowl and mix well.
3 spread a portion of the remaining flour on a work surface. Place the dough on the work surface 
and knead additional flour into the dough until it is firm and workable. divide the dough into eight 
equal pieces. roll each piece into a cylinder approximately 2 feet (60 centimeters) long. With a 
dough knife, cut the dough into ¼- to ½-ounce (7- to 15-gram) pieces. round each piece into a 
ball. Flour the tines of a dinner fork and draw the fork firmly across each ball to form ridges around 
the surface of the gnocchi and create an indentation on one side. Place the formed gnocchi on a 
floured sheet pan. Cover and refrigerate until service.
4 Boil the gnocchi in salted water for 2–3 minutes. a few seconds after they begin to float, remove 
the gnocchi from the water with a spider or slotted spoon and drain well.
5 sauté the gnocchi in small batches in whole butter, browning them slightly. Portion them into serv￾ing dishes, top with grated Parmesan and Fontina slices and place under the broiler for 1–2 minutes 
to melt the cheese. serve immediately.

Polenta vs. Grits
Polenta and grits are both types of cornmeal 
mush, made by stirring the ground grain into a 
hot liquid and cooking on the stovetop. Both 
require almost constant stirring to prevent 
lumps and both can be chilled into a firm mass, 
then cut into portions and sautéed or grilled. 
Both began as peasant foods; grits shares 
its history with the american south, while 
polenta developed in northern italy. there 
are some differences with the way the corn is 
milled for the two products, however. Grits are 
coarser and generally made from white corn, 
while polenta is made with a smoother meal 
ground from yellow corn. the wide availability 
of coarse-ground whole-grain cornmeal blurs 
these lines nowadays. shrimp and grits and 
similar entrées may be made with the finer 
polenta cornmeal, while grits can be cooked 
into a mush and referred to as polenta. it’s now 
a matter of “chef ’s choice” based on taste and 
texture preferences.

 After studying this chapter, 
you will be able to: 
24. 1 characterize and identify a variety of salad 
greens 
24. 2 describe nutritional information for 
salads 
24. 3 purchase and store salad greens 
24. 4 prepare salad greens for service 
24. 5 prepare salad dressings 
24. 6 explain the procedures for preparing 
tossed and composed salads 
24. 7 explain the procedures for preparing 
bound salads 
24. 8 explain the procedures for preparing fruit 
and gelatin salads 
 The term salad is used to cover a broad range of dishes including the small plate of 
crisp iceberg lettuce with tomato wedges, cucumber slices and ranch dressing; the 
dinner plate of sautéed duck breast fanned across bright-red grilled radicchio and 
toothy green arugula, sprayed with a vinaigrette dressing; the scoop of shredded chicken, 
mango chutney and seasonings, bound with mayonnaise; and the bowl of cooked grains, 
green beans and mushrooms marinated in olive oil and lemon juice. 
 each of these dishes fits the definition of a salad : a single food or a mix of different foods 
accompanied or bound by a dressing. a salad can contain meat, grains, fruits, vegetables, 
nuts or cheese and absolutely no lettuce. it can be an appetizer, a second course served after 
the appetizer, an entrée (especially at lunch), a course following the entrée in the european 
manner or even a breakfast or dessert. 
 Harmony is critical to a salad’s success—no matter what type of salad is being prepared. 
The color, texture and flavor of each salad ingredient should complement those of the oth￾ers, and the dressing should complement all the ingredients. 
 This chapter opens with sections about identifying and preparing greens commonly used 
in salads. a discussion of salad dressings follows. Finally techniques for making green salads 
(both tossed and composed); bound salads; bean, grain and pasta salads; vegetable salads 
and fruit and gelatin salads are discussed. 
 IDENTIFYING SALAD GREENS 
 Salad greens are not necessarily green: Some are red, yellow, white or brown. They are 
all, however, fresh leafy vegetables typically served uncooked. Many are members of the 
lettuce or chicory family. Some of the greens identified here are also used as vegetables 
in cooked side dishes, notably spinach and radicchio, while some vegetable greens, such 
as kale and cabbage, also show up uncooked in salads. 
 Lettuce 
 Lettuce (Fr. laitue ; It. lattuga ) has been consumed for nearly as long as people have kept 
records of their dining habits. Archaeologists found that Persian royalty were served let￾tuce at their banquets more than 2500 years ago. Grown and served worldwide, lettuces 
are members of the genus Lactuca . The most common types of lettuce are butterhead, 
crisp head (iceberg), leaf and romaine. 
 Boston 
 Boston and bibb are two of the most popular butterhead lettuces. Their soft, pliable, pale 
green leaves have a buttery texture and flavor. Boston is larger and paler than bibb. Both 
Boston and bibb lettuce leaves form cups when separated from the heads; these cups 
make convenient bases for holding other foods on cold plates. 
 Iceberg 
 Iceberg lettuce is one of the most popular lettuce varieties in the United States; it out￾sells all other varieties combined, although its appeal is declining now that other types 
of greens are widely available. Iceberg’s tightly packed spherical head is composed of 
crisp, pale green leaves that have a very mild flavor. Iceberg lettuce remains crisp for a 
relatively long time after being cut or prepared. Select heads that are firm but not hard 
and leaves that are free of burnt or rusty tips.

Mixed micro greens
Leaf
Leaf lettuce grows in bunches. It has separate, ruffle-edged leaves branching from a 
stalk. Because it does not grow into a firm head, it is easily damaged when handled. 
Both red and green leaf lettuce have mild flavors and tender leaves; both are often 
used in sandwiches. Good-quality leaf lettuce should have nicely shaped 
leaves free of bruises, breaks or brown spots.
Romaine
Romaine lettuce, also known as cos, is a loosely packed head lettuce 
with elongated leaves and thick midribs. Its outer leaves are dark 
green and although they look coarse, they are crisp, tender and tasty 
without being bitter. The core leaves are paler and more tender 
but still crisp. Romaine has enough flavor to stand up to strongly 
flavored dressings such as the garlic and Parmesan cheese used in 
a Caesar salad. Small heads can be grilled. A good-quality head of 
romaine has dark green outer leaves that are free of blemishes or 
yellowing.
Baby Lettuces
Baby greens have similar but more subtle flavors than their mature versions. They are 
often less bitter and are always more tender and delicate. Because of their size and 
variety, baby lettuces are perfect for composed salads and as delicate garnish on light 
entrées. Mesclun is a mixture of several kinds of baby lettuces.

Chicory
Chicories come in a variety of colors, shapes and sizes; most are slightly bitter. Chicories 
are quite hearty and can also be cooked, usually grilled or braised. Kale micro greens
Micro greens are even smaller than baby lettuces. They are the first true leaves of 
virtually any edible greens, such as lettuce, spinach, kale and so on. Micro greens are 
very fragile and must be handpicked and carefully packaged for shipping. Chefs use 
them as garnish, especially on entrée and appetizer plates.

radicchio
Belgian Endive
Belgian endive grows in small, tight heads with pointed leaves. It is actually the shoot of 
a chicory root. The small sturdy leaves are white at the base with yellow fringes and tips. 
(A purple-tipped variety is also available.) Whole Belgian endive leaves can be separated, 
trimmed and filled with soft butters, cheeses or spreads and served as an hors d’oeuvre, or 
they can be used for composed salads. The leaves, cut or whole, can also be added to cold 
salads. Heads of Belgian endive are often braised or grilled and served with meat or poultry.
Curly Endive
In the United States, curly endive is often called by its family name, chicory, or its French 
name, frisée [free-ZAY]. The dark green outer leaves are pointed, sturdy and slightly bit￾ter. The yellow inner leaves are more tender and less bitter. Curly endive has a strong 
flavor that goes well with strong cheeses, game and citrus. It is mixed with other greens 
to add texture and flavor.
Escarole
Escarole [es-kah-ROLE], sometimes called broadleaf endive, has thick leaves and a slightly 
bitter flavor. It has green outer leaves and pale green or yellow center leaves. Escarole is very 
sturdy and is mixed with other salad greens for added texture. Its strong flavor stands up to 
full-flavored dressings and is a good accompaniment to grilled meats and poultry. Escarole 
leaves may also be cooked in soups and pasta dishes, or lightly sautéed as a side dish.
Radicchio
Radicchio [rah-DEE-kee-oh] resembles a small red cabbage. 
It retains its bright reddish color when cooked and is popular 
braised or grilled and served as a vegetable side dish. Because 
of its attractive color, radicchio is popular in cold salads, but 
it has a very bitter flavor and should be used sparingly and 
mixed with other greens in tossed salads. Radicchio leaves 
form cups when separated and can be used to hold other 
ingredients when preparing composed salads.
Other Salad Greens and Ingredients
Leafy vegetables besides lettuce and chicory as well as other ingredients are used to add 
texture, flavor and color to green salads. A partial list follows.
Arugula
Arugula [ah-ROO-guh-lah], also known as rocket, is a mem￾ber of the cabbage family. Arugula leaves are somewhat 
similar to broad dandelion leaves in size and shape. 
They are best when 2–4 inches (5–10 centimeters) 
long. Arugula has a very strong, spicy, peppery flavor. 
It is used to add zip to salads by combining it with other 
greens and as a fresh topping on cheesy pizza.
Dandelion
Dandelion grows as a weed throughout most of the United States. It has long, thin, toothed 
leaves with a prominent midrib. Small, young leaves are best for use in salads as they are 
more tender and less bitter. Older, tougher leaves can be cooked and served as a vegetable.
Mâche
Mâche [mahsh] or lamb’s lettuce is very tender and very delicately flavored. Its 
small, curved, pale to dark green leaves have a slightly nutty flavor. Because its

flavor is so delicate, mâche should be combined only with other delicately flavored 
greens such as Boston or bibb lettuce and dressed sparingly with a light vinaigrette 
dressing.
 Sorrel
Sorrel, sometimes called sourgrass, has leaves 
similar to spinach in color and shape. Sorrel has 
a very tart, lemony flavor that goes well with 
fish and shellfish. It should be used sparingly 
and combined with other greens in salads. 
Sorrel can also be made into soups, sauces and 
purées.
Spinach
Like sorrel, spinach can be cooked or used as a salad 
green. As a salad green, it is traditionally served tossed with hot bacon dress￾ing or combined with a mesclun blend. Spinach is deep green with a rich flavor and tender 
texture. Good-quality spinach should be fairly crisp. Avoid wilted or yellowed bunches.
Sprouts
Sprouts are alfalfa, daikon, mustard or other vegetable seeds grown in water until they 
form young, tender plants. They are not salad greens but are often used as such in salads 
and sandwiches. Alfalfa sprouts are very mild and sweet. Daikon and mustard sprouts 
are quite peppery.
Watercress
Watercress has tiny, dime-sized leaves and substantial 
stems. It has a peppery flavor and adds spice to sal￾ads. Good-quality fresh watercress is dark green 
with no yellowing. To preserve its freshness, water￾cress must be kept very cold and moist. Individual 
leaves are plucked from the stems and rinsed just 
before service.
Edible Flowers
Many specialty produce growers offer edible, pesticide-free blossoms. They are 
used for salads and as garnishes wherever a splash of color is appreciated. Some 
flowers such as nasturtiums, calendulas and pansies are grown and picked spe￾cifically for eating. Others, such as yellow cucumber flowers and squash blossoms, 
are by-products of the vegetable industry.
Squash blossoms and other very large flowers should be cut in julienne strips before 
being added to salads. Pick petals from large and medium-sized flowers. Smaller, whole 
flowers can be tossed in a salad or used as a garnish. Very small flowers or petals should 
be sprinkled on top of a salad so that they are not hidden by the greens.
Fresh Herbs
Basil, thyme, tarragon, oregano, dill, cilantro, marjoram, mint, sage, savory and even 
rosemary are used to add interesting flavors to salads. Because many herbs have strong 
flavors, use them sparingly so that the delicate flavors of the greens are not overpow￾ered. Leafy herbs such as basil and sage can be cut chiffonade. Other herbs can be 
picked from their stems and added directly to salads or chopped before being tossed 
with the salad greens. Flowering herbs such as chive blossoms are used like other edi￾ble flowers to add color, flavor and aroma. Refer to Chapter 7, Flavors and Flavorings, 
for more information on herbs.
 Safety Alert
Flowers
Many flowers and blossoms are toxic, 
especially those grown from bulbs. 
even flowers that would otherwise 
be edible may contain pesticides that 
can be harmful if ingested. Use only 
flowers grown specifically for use as 
food; purchase edible flowers only from 
reputable purveyors.

 NUTRITIONAL INFORMATION FOR SALADS 
 Salad greens are an especially healthful food. Greens contain virtually no fat and few cal￾ories and are high in vitamins A, K and C, folate, iron and dietary fiber. Darker, loose-leaf 
greens, such as spinach, kale and romaine, contain more nutrients and antioxidants than 
lighter colored head lettuces. But if greens are served in salads garnished with too much 
meat and cheese and tossed with dressing (many of which are oil based), fat and calories 
quickly add up. In an attempt to maintain the health benefits of salads, low-fat or fat-free 
dressings should be made available to customers. House-prepared salad dressings pre￾pared with fruit juice, spices (e.g., ginger, cardamom, cracked pepper), herbs (e.g., basil, 
lavender, thyme) and oils high in monounsaturated fats (e.g., olive, peanut, canola) are 
healthy, flavorful and distinctive options. 
 The nutritional value of fresh salads can be enhanced by adding dried or fresh fruit, 
seeds or nuts, cooked grains, legumes or a variety of fresh or blanched vegetables. Lean 
proteins, such as grilled fish or chicken breast, cooked egg whites, water-packed canned 
tuna and tofu, also improve the nutritional value and boost the feeling of fullness provided 
by salads. Reduce or avoid the use of high-fat meats and cheeses, buttery croutons, fried 
tortillas or refined wheat pastas in salads. 
 PURCHASING AND STORING SALAD GREENS 
 Lettuces are grown in nearly every part of the United States; nearly all types are available 
year-round because of national distribution systems. Other important salad greens such 
as spinach and kale are available all year; many of the specialty greens are seasonal. 
 Lettuce is generally packed in cases of 24 heads with varying weights. Other salad 
greens are packed in trays or boxes of various sizes and weights. 
 Because salad greens are simply washed and eaten, it is extremely important that they 
be as fresh and blemish-free as possible. Many foodservice operators purchase salad 
greens daily. All greens should be fresh looking, with no yellowing. Heads should be 
heavy, with little or no damage to the outer leaves. Do not wash greens until needed as 
excess water causes them to deteriorate quickly. 
 Many types of salad greens are available precut and prewashed. These greens 
are often packed with nitrogen to increase shelf life, although delicate greens are 
sometimes loosely packaged in 5- to 10-pound (2- to 5-kilogram) boxes. Precut and 
prewashed greens are relatively expensive but can reduce labor costs dramatically. 
Although it is important to visually inspect and remove wilted leaves, do not rinse or 
wash packaged greens that are labeled “ready to eat” or “pre-washed.” These prod￾ucts are treated with food-safe levels of hydrogen peroxide or chlorine and are truly 
ready to serve. Handling the greens creates an opportunity for cross-contamination 
from hands, sinks, cutting boards and other sources. Furthermore a standard kitchen 
rinse-and-dry will not remove or destroy pathogenic bacteria that survived commercial 
sanitation procedures. 
 Although some types of salad greens are hearty enough to keep for a week or 
more under proper conditions, all salad greens are highly perishable. Generally 
softer-leaved varieties such as Boston and bibb tend to perish more quickly than the 
crisper-leaved varieties such as iceberg and romaine. Frequently greens that have 
wilted slightly can be revived by soaking them in chilled water for up to an hour. The 
greens should then be drained and refrigerated until crisp. Although not useable raw 
in salads, wilted greens can be cleaned and used in cooked dishes such as gratins, 
purées and soups. 
 Greens should be stored in their original protective cartons in a specifically desig￾nated refrigerator at temperatures between 34°F and 38°F (1°C and 3°C). (Most other 
vegetables should be stored at warmer temperatures of 40–50°F [4–10°C].) Greens should 
not be stored with tomatoes, apples or other fruits that emit ethylene gas, which causes 
greens to wilt and accelerates spoilage. 
 Safety Alert 
 Handling Salad Greens 
 Because salads are not cooked, it is 
especially important to be careful about 
proper hand washing when preparing 
them. Most health departments prohibit 
bare hand contact with foods that are 
ready to eat (i.e., food that will not be 
heated again before service). Bare hand 
contact can be avoided by proper use of 
long gloves, deli tissues, napkins, tongs, 
spatulas or other utensils. 
 remove wilted leaves and trim discolorations 
on lettuce before using.

PREPARING SALAD GREENS
Salad greens that are not pre-rinsed with sanitizing solution need to be prepared before 
service. Preparation principally involves tearing, cutting, washing and drying.
Tearing and Cutting Salad Greens
Some chefs want all salad greens torn by hand. Delicate greens such as butterhead and 
baby lettuces look nicer, and it is less likely that they will be bruised if hand-torn. But 
often it is not practical to hand-tear all greens. It is perfectly acceptable to cut hardy 
greens with a knife. And it can be more practical to snip small lettuce leaves and fresh 
herbs with kitchen scissors than to tear them by hand.
Procedure for Cutting Romaine Lettuce
➊ To cut romaine lettuce, trim the outer 
leaves and damaged tips with a chef ’s knife and 
split the head lengthwise.
➋ Make one or two cuts along the length 
of the head, leaving the root intact, then cut 
across the width of the head.
➌ alternative method: Trim the outer leaves 
and damaged tips with a chef ’s knife. Pull the 
leaves from the core and cut the rib out of each 
leaf. The leaf can then be cut to the desired size.
➊ loosen the core by gripping the head and 
smacking the core on the cutting board. (do not 
use too much force or you may bruise the lettuce.)
➋ remove the core and cut the lettuce as 
desired.

Washing Salad Greens
All lettuces and other salad greens that are not pre-rinsed with sanitizing solution should be 
washed before use. Even when they look clean, greens may harbor hidden insects, sand, soil 
and pesticides. Pay special attention to greens sourced from small farms, which may not have 
facilities to pre-clean their produce. All greens should be washed after they are torn or cut. 
Although whole heads can be washed by repeatedly dipping them in cold water and allow￾ing them to drain, washing whole heads is not recommended. It will not remove anything 
trapped near the head’s center, and water trapped in the leaves can accelerate spoilage.
➊ Clean and sanitize a sink, then fill it with 
cold water that is slightly warmer than the tem￾perature of the greens. Place cut or torn greens 
in the water.
➋ gently stir the water and greens with your 
hands and remove the greens. do not allow 
the greens to soak. Using fresh water each 
time, repeat the procedure until no grit can be 
detected on the bottom of the sink after the 
greens are removed.

Procedure for Washing Salad Greens
Drying Salad Greens
Salad greens should be dried after washing. Wet greens do not stay as crisp as thor￾oughly dried ones. Also wet greens tend to repel oil-based dressings and dilute the 
flavors of the dressing. Greens may be dried by draining them well in a colander and 
blotting them with clean absorbent cloth or paper towels, or, preferably, they can be 
dried in a salad spinner, which uses centrifugal force to remove the water. Place washed 
greens in the basket of a salad spinner and spin for approximately 30 seconds. Sanitize 
the spinner before each use; wash, rinse, sanitize and air dry it after use.
SALAD DRESSINGS
A dressing is a sauce for a salad. Just as sauces for hot foods should complement rather 
than mask the flavor of the principal food, dressing for salads should complement rather 
than mask the flavors of the other ingredients. Although a great many ingredients can be 
used to make salad dressings, most dressings are based on either a mixture of oil and 
vinegar, called a vinaigrette, or a mayonnaise or other emulsified product. To reduce 
the fat content, vinaigrette-style dressings can be made without oil; creamy dressings 
similar to mayonnaise-based dressings can be made with sour cream, yogurt or butter￾milk instead of mayonnaise. Nevertheless, for all practical purposes, these dressings are 
still prepared like vinaigrettes and mayonnaise-based dressings, and they are treated that 
way here. Review the material on oils and vinegars in Chapter 7, Flavors and Flavorings, 
for more information on specific ingredients.
M24_LABE1163_07_SE_C24.indd 748 31/10/23 8:45 PMSaladS and Salad dreSSingS 749
Vinaigrette Dressings
The simple vinaigrette, also known as basic French dressing, is a temporary emulsion 
of oil and vinegar seasoned with salt and pepper. The standard vinaigrette ratio is three 
parts oil to one part vinegar. The ratio can vary, however, depending upon the flavor 
and quality of these key ingredients. When using strongly flavored oils, less than three 
parts oil generally suffices. In some recipes, all or part of the vinegar is replaced with 
citrus juice, in which case it may take more than one part vinegar and citrus juice to 
achieve the proper acidity level. Mild or sweet vinegars, such as balsamic, may require 
less oil to balance the flavors in the dressing. The best way to determine the correct ratio 
of oil to vinegar is to taste the oil and vinegar before preparing the dressing and adjust 
the ratio of oil and vinegar accordingly.
Oils and vinegars have unique flavors that can be mixed and matched to achieve 
the correct balance for a particular salad. Extra virgin olive oil goes well with red wine 
vinegar; nut oils go well with white wine or sherry vinegars. Neutral-flavored oils such 
as canola, corn or safflower can be mixed with a flavored vinegar. See Table 24.1 for 
general guidelines for preparing vinaigrettes.
Oil and vinegar repel each other and separate almost immediately when mixed. For 
this reason, they must be whisked together immediately before use.
Oils
Many types of oil can be used to make salad dressings. Light, neutral-flavored vegetable 
oils such as canola, corn, cottonseed, soybean and safflower are relatively low priced 
and used extensively for dressings. Other oils can be used to add flavor. Olive oil is 
very popular; both mild-flavored pure olive oil and full-flavored extra virgin olive oil 
are used. Nut oils such as hazelnut and walnut are expensive, but they add unique and 
interesting flavors to dressings. Oils infused with herbs, garlic or spices add additional 
layers of flavor to vinaigrette dressing. (See page 146.)
Vinegars
Many different vinegars can be used in salad dressings. Red wine vinegar is commonly 
used, because it is inexpensive and its flavor blends well with many foods. But other 
vinegars such as cider, balsamic, sherry and white wine are also used as well as vinegars 
made from varietal wines such as cabernet or zinfandel. The acidity of vinegars varies by 
type and manufacturer; it is usually between 4–8 percent acetic acid. In general, wine vin￾egars are required by law to have at least 6 percent acetic acid. Rice vinegar, made from 
fermented rice wine, has a mild acidity (4 percent acetic acid) and is popular when making 
Asian-inspired salad dressings. Malt vinegar made from fermented barley has a sweeter 
and more complex flavor than white wine vinegar. Fruit-flavored vinegars, such as fig or 
lemon, are popular and widely available, as are herb- and garlic-flavored ones.
French dressing classically, a vinaigrette 
dressing made from oil, vinegar, salt and 
pepper; in the United States, the term also 
refers to a commercially prepared dressing that 
is creamy, tartly sweet and red-orange in color
Not Just for Salads
With its light taste and texture, vinaigrette 
dressing makes an appealing sauce where 
a delicate touch is desired. it is quick to 
make and versatile; changing the taste of 
a vinaigrette is only a matter of switching 
the type of oil and vinegar used. its 
balanced acidity makes vinaigrette a good 
foil for fish dishes, as shown in Fin Fish 
Carpaccio with lemon Thyme Vinaigrette. 
(See page 581.)
acetic acid organic compound produced during 
fermentation; acetic acid bacteria consume 
glucose in a liquid and convert it to ethanol 
(alcohol) then acetic acid; vinegar consists of 
acetic acid diluted to 3–20 percent

Flavored vinegars are easy to make. Fruit, herbs or garlic are added to a wine vinegar 
(either red or white) and left for several days for the flavors to blend. The vinegar is then 
strained and used as desired.
Juices from acidic fruit, such as lemon, orange and lime, are sometimes substituted for 
all or part of the vinegar in a salad dressing.
Other Flavoring Ingredients
Herbs, spices, shallots, garlic, mustard and sugar are only a few of the many flavoring 
ingredients used to enhance vinaigrette dressings. These flavoring ingredients should 
be considered accents that help balance the acidity of the vinegar and the flavors of 
the salad greens. Items such as herbs, shallots and garlic should be minced or chopped 
before they are added to the dressing. If dried herbs are used, add them to the vinegar 
before adding the oil then let the dressing rest for at least 1 hour to allow the flavors 
to develop. Other ingredients such as grated cheese, olives and conditioned dried fruits 
may be added at any time.
Convenience Products
a great many prepared and dry-mix 
salad dressings are available. although 
they vary greatly in quality, they can be 
very economical; they offer consistency, 
reduced labor costs and, sometimes, 
reduced food costs. Some of these 
products use stabilizers, artificial 
flavorings and colors; nearly all contain 
preservatives. When considering the 
advantages of prepared or dry-mix salad 
dressings, always keep quality in mind.
Procedure for Preparing a Vinaigrette
1 Choose an oil and vinegar that complement each other as well as the foods they will dress.
2 Combine the vinegar, seasonings and any other flavorings in a bowl.
3 Whisk in the oil gradually.
4 allow the finished dressing to rest a few hours at room temperature before using so that 
the flavors can blend.
5 rewhisk immediately before use.

 Mayonnaise-Based Dressings
Mayonnaise-based salad dressings use mayonnaise as a base with other ingredi￾ents added for flavor, color and texture. Other ingredients include dairy products 
(especially buttermilk and sour cream), vinegar, fruit juice, vegetables (puréed or 
minced), tomato paste, garlic, onions, herbs, spices, condiments, capers, anchovies 
and boiled eggs. Recipes for several mayonnaise-based salad dressings appear at the 
end of this chapter.

Preparing Mayonnaise
Although most food service operations buy commercially prepared mayonnaise, every 
chef should know how mayonnaise is made to more fully understand how to use it and 
why it reacts the way it does when used. Knowing how to make mayonnaise also allows 
the chef to create a mayonnaise with the exact flavor desired.
Mayonnaise is an emulsion. Recall that an emulsion, or emulsified sauce, is formed 
when two liquids that would not ordinarily form a stable mixture are forced together 
and held in suspension, as discussed in Chapter 11, Stocks and Sauces. To make may￾onnaise, oil is whisked together with a very small amount of vinegar. (It is the water 
in the vinegar that does not normally mix with oil.) As the oil and vinegar are whisked 
together, the oil breaks into microscopic droplets that are separated from each other by a 
thin barrier of vinegar. If left alone, the droplets would quickly regroup, forming a large 
puddle of oil and a small puddle of vinegar. To prevent the oil droplets from regrouping, 
an emulsifier is added. For mayonnaise, the emulsifier is lecithin, a protein in egg yolks. 
(The acid in the vinegar also helps form the emulsion.) Lecithin has the unique ability 
to combine with both oil and water. It surrounds the oil droplets, preventing them from 
coming in contact with each other and regrouping.
The balance of vinegar, oil, lecithin and agitation (whipping) is crucial to achieve a 
proper emulsion. The higher the proportion of oil to vinegar, the thicker the sauce will 
be. The higher the proportion of vinegar to oil, the thinner the sauce will be. Some chefs 
add ½ fluid ounce (15 milliliters) boiling water to each 7 fluid ounces (210 milliliters) 
finished mayonnaise to help maintain the emulsion.
Mayonnaise Ingredients
A neutral-flavored vegetable oil is most often used for a standard mayonnaise. Other 
oils are used to contribute their special flavors. For example, olive oil is used to make a 
strong garlic mayonnaise called aïoli. (See page 769.)
White wine vinegar is used for a standard mayonnaise. Flavored vinegars, such as 
tarragon vinegar, can be used to create unique flavors. Seasonings vary according to the 
intended use but typically include dry mustard, salt, pepper and lemon juice.
emulsion a uniform mixture of two unmixable 
liquids; it is often temporary (e.g., oil in water)

Mayonnaise vs. 
Salad Dressing
Commercially prepared salad dressing 
is often used as a substitute for “real” 
mayonnaise. although it may look, 
smell and spread like the real thing, 
salad dressing tends to be sweeter than 
mayonnaise. Salad dressing costs less 
than real mayonnaise because it is made 
without egg yolks, relying instead on 
chemical thickening agents. The cost is 
reduced further because the Fda requires 
salad dressing to contain only 30 percent 
oil, whereas mayonnaise must contain at 
least 65 percent oil.
Procedure for Preparing Mayonnaise
1 gather all ingredients and allow the eggs to sit at room temperature for 30 minutes. 
room-temperature ingredients emulsify more easily than cold ones.
2 Whip the egg yolks vigorously by hand with a whisk or in an electric mixer or food processor 
until frothy.
3 add the seasonings to the yolks and whip to combine. Salt and other seasonings 
will dissolve or blend more easily when added at this point rather than to the 
finished mayonnaise.
4 add a small amount of the liquid (e.g., vinegar) from the recipe and whip to combine.
5 With the mixer on high or whisking vigorously by hand, begin to add the oil very slowly until 
the mixture begins to thicken and an emulsion forms.
6 after the emulsion forms, the oil can be added a little more quickly but still in a slow, 
steady stream. The mayonnaise can now be whipped at a slightly slower speed.
7 The mayonnaise will become very thick as more oil is added. a small amount of liquid can 
be added if it becomes too thick. alternate between adding oil and liquid two or three 
times until all the oil is added and the correct consistency is reached. note that a large egg 
yolk can emulsify up to 7 fluid ounces (210 milliliters) of oil; adding more oil may cause the 
mayonnaise to break.
8 adjust the seasonings and refrigerate immediately.
 Safety Alert
Mayonnaise
The raw eggs in freshly prepared 
mayonnaise make it a time and 
temperature control for safety (TCS) 
food. Use pasteurized eggs if possible, 
and keep the finished mayonnaise at 
41°F (5°C) or below. Freshly prepared 
mayonnaise will keep for 2–4 days, if 
properly refrigerated. Commercially 
prepared mayonnaise may be stored at 
room temperature before opening but 
should also be refrigerated at 41°F (5°C) 
or below after the package is opened. 
if held at the proper temperature, 
commercial mayonnaise will last 
2–3 months after opening.

 Repairing Broken Mayonnaise
There is a limit to how much oil each egg yolk can emulsify. One yolk contains enough 
lecithin to emulsify approximately 7 fluid ounces (210 milliliters) of oil. If more than that 
amount of oil per egg yolk is added, the sauce may break; that is, the oil and vinegar will 
separate, and the mayonnaise will become very thin. Often mayonnaise that has broken 
can be repaired by beating the broken mayonnaise into additional egg yolks until the emul￾sion re-forms. To repair a broken mayonnaise, slowly beat 7 fluid ounces (210 milliliters) 
broken mayonnaise into one egg yolk. Adjust the amount of egg yolk to be used according 
to the size of the batch that has broken. Table 24.2 lists common problems that can occur 
when making mayonnaise and some solutions.
Emulsified Vinaigrette Dressings
An emulsified vinaigrette is a standard vinaigrette dressing emulsified with whole eggs. 
An emulsified vinaigrette dressing is thinner and lighter than a mayonnaise-based dress￾ing and heavier than a basic vinaigrette. The flavor of an emulsified vinaigrette is similar 
to a basic vinaigrette, but an emulsified vinaigrette will not separate and it clings to 
greens quite easily.
Procedure for Preparing an Emulsified Vinaigrette Dressing
Broken mayonnaise is thin and separated 
or curdled.
1 gather all ingredients and hold at room temperature. room-temperature ingredients 
emulsify more easily than cold ones.
2 Whip the eggs until frothy.
3 add the dry ingredients and any flavorings such as garlic, shallots and herbs.
4 add a small amount of the liquid called for in the recipe and whip to incorporate the 
ingredients.
5 With the mixer on high or whisking vigorously by hand or with an immersion blender, begin 
adding the oil very slowly until the emulsion forms.
6 after the emulsion is formed, add the oil a little more quickly, but still in a slow, steady 
stream.
7 alternate between oil and liquid two or three times until all the oil is added. The dressing 
should be much thinner than mayonnaise. if it is too thick, it can be thinned with a little 
water, vinegar or lemon juice. determine which to add by first tasting the dressing.

TOSSED AND COMPOSED SALADS
There are two types of green salads: tossed and composed. The more informal tossed 
salad is prepared by placing the greens, garnishes and dressing in a large bowl and 
gently tossing to combine. A composed salad usually has a more elegant look. It is pre￾pared by arranging each of the ingredients on plates in an attractive fashion.
M24_LABE1163_07_SE_C24.indd 754 31/10/23 8:45 PMSaladS and Salad dreSSingS 755
Tossed Green Salads
Tossed salads are made from leafy vegetables such as lettuce, spinach, watercress, aru￾gula or dandelion greens. They may consist only of greens and dressing, or they can be 
garnished with fruits, vegetables, nuts or cheese. They can be dressed with a variety of 
dressings, from light oil and vinegar to hearty hot bacon. It is important that salad dress￾ings be added at the last possible moment before service. Acidic dressings cause most 
greens to wilt and become soggy. Salting greens lightly before dressing with vinaigrette 
helps keep them crisp.
Matching Dressings and Salad Greens
A simple rule to follow when choosing dressings for salads: The more delicate the texture 
and flavor of the greens or other ingredients, the lighter and more subtle the dressing 
should be. Vinaigrette-based dressings are much lighter than mayonnaise-based or similar 
dressings and are a good choice for butterhead lettuces, mâche or other delicate greens. 
Crisp head lettuce such as iceberg and hardy lettuce such as romaine or greens such as 
kale can stand up to heavier, mayonnaise-based or similar dressings. Vinaigrette dress￾ings coat greens evenly, whereas thicker dressings tend to clump. When making a tossed 
salad, begin with a portion of the dressing, adding additional dressing only as needed, 
in order to prevent the greens from wilting. Table 24.3 lists some successful greens and 
dressing combinations.

TABLE 24.3
Croutons
a crouton is simply a piece of bread that 
is toasted, sautéed or dried. Two types are 
often used.
The more familiar ones are small 
seasoned cubes of bread that are baked or 
toasted and sprinkled over soups or salads.
a more classic variety is made by 
sautéing slices of bread in clarified 
butter or olive oil until brown and crisp. 
The bread may be rough slices from a 
baguette, or shapes (such as hearts, 
diamonds or circles) cut from larger slices. 
Sautéed croutons have two advantages 
over the toasted variety: They stay crisp 
longer after coming in contact with moist 
foods and they gain flavor from the butter 
or olive oil in which they are cooked. 
Sautéed croutons can be used to decorate 
the border of a serving dish, as a base for 
canapés, as a garnish for soups, as an 
accompaniment to spreads or caviar or as 
a base under some meat and game dishes.
Procedure for Making Tossed Green Salads
1 Select greens with various colors, textures and flavors.
2 Carefully cut or tear, wash and dry the greens.
3 Prepare the garnishes as directed or desired.
4 Prepare the dressing.
5 Combine the greens, garnishes and dressing by tossing them together, or toss the greens 
and garnishes and, using a spray bottle, spray the greens with the dressing.
6 Serve the salads on chilled plates.

Composed Green Salads
In composed green salads, a green is usually the base. The salads are built by attractively 
arranging other ingredients on the plate. There are usually four components: the base, 
body, garnish and dressing.
The base is typically a layer of salad greens that line the plate on which the salad will 
be served. Depending on the desired effect, the leaves can be cup-shaped or flat.
The body is the main ingredient. It can be lettuce or other greens, or another salad 
made from cooked or blended ingredients, such as chicken salad or fruit.
The garnish is added to the salad for color, texture and flavor. It can be as substantial 
as a grilled, sliced duck breast or as simple as a sprinkling of chopped herbs. Garnishes 
can be warm or cold. The choice is unlimited, but whatever is used should always 
complement and balance the flavor of the body.
The dressing should complement rather than mask the other flavors in the salad. If 
the body already contains a dressing, as a bound salad does, additional dressing may not 
be necessary.
Composed green salads are usually dressed by ladling the dressing over the salad 
after it is plated. Alternatively the individual ingredients can be dressed before they are 
arranged on the plate. A third method that may be limited by the intricacy of the salad 
but will save precious time during a busy period is to prepare individual salads on a 
sheet pan. Just before service, mist them with dressing using a spray bottle designated 
for this purpose; then transfer them to chilled plates using a spatula.
Procedure for Making Composed Salads
1 gather all ingredients for the salad and wash, trim, cut, cook, chill or otherwise prepare 
them as necessary or as called for in the recipe.
2 arrange all ingredients attractively on the plates, dressing each ingredient as desired or as 
directed in the recipe.
3 at service time, heat or cook any items that are being served hot and add them to the 
salad.

Garnishing Salads
Simple garnishes add color, texture and flavor to tossed and composed salads. Examples 
include slivered almonds or edible flowers. Garnishes may also be important compo￾nents in the final product—for example, julienned turkey, crumbled blue cheese and 
crispy bacon on a bed of lettuce for a Cobb Salad (page 773). Although there are some 
traditional garnishes such as croutons on Caesar Salad (page 754), the final choice 
depends on the chef’s imagination and ingredients at hand. The following is a partial list 
of garnishes that can be combined with salad greens for a tossed or composed salad:
	▪ Vegetables: Nearly any vegetable (raw, blanched or fully cooked) cut into 
appropriate sizes and uniform shapes
	▪ Fruits: Citrus segments, apples or pears; dried fruits such as raisins, currants or 
apricots
	▪ Eggs, meats, poultry, fish and shellfish: Poached or hard-boiled eggs; cooked 
meats and poultry sliced or diced neatly and uniformly; poached, grilled or cured 
fish, diced or flaked; small, whole cooked shellfish such as shrimp and scallops; 
lobster or crab sliced, diced or chopped

BOUND SALADS
A creative chef can prepare a wide variety of salads by combining cooked meats, poul￾try, fish, shellfish, potatoes, pasta, beans and/or grains with a dressing and garnishes. 
Although the combinations vary greatly in these types of salads, they are grouped here 
because their ingredients are all bound together with a dressing. That is, the ingredients 
of a bound salad are held together in a cohesive mass. The binding agent is either a vin￾aigrette or a mayonnaise-based or similar dressing, which is most commonly associated 
with the term. The ingredients should be evenly distributed throughout. The degree of 
cohesiveness can range from tightly packed to flaky and easily separated.
The foods that can be used to produce bound salads are so varied that it is impossible 
to list them all. Generalizing preparation techniques is also difficult. There are as many 
ways to prepare a bound salad as there are ingredients, dressings and garnishes.
Bound salads can be used as the body of a composed salad (e.g., a serving of egg 
salad on a bed of greens). Some bound salads (e.g., tuna or chicken salad) are used in 
sandwiches, but they are not ordinarily served as side dishes. Other bound salads (e.g., 
coleslaw and potato or pasta salad) are served as side dishes but not in sandwiches. 
Follow specific recipes and traditional uses for each salad to build confidence. Then use 
these skills and imagination to create enticing new salad combinations.
General guidelines for making bound salads include the following:
	▪ Preparing a salad from cooked foods is a good opportunity to use leftovers if they 
are fresh and of good quality. The finished salad can be only as good as each of 
its ingredients.
	▪ When making a bound salad, choose ingredients whose flavors blend well and 
complement each other.
	▪ Choose ingredients for color; a few colorful ingredients turn a plain salad into a 
spectacular one.
	▪ To improve appearance, cut all ingredients in similar sizes that are small enough 
to be eaten easily with a fork.
	▪ Be sure all meats, poultry, fish and shellfish are properly cooked before using 
them. Improperly cooked foods can cause food-borne illness and spoilage.
	▪ Always chill cooked ingredients well before combining them. Warm ingredients 
promote bacterial growth, especially in mayonnaise-based salads.
	▪ Use dressings sparingly. They should enhance the flavors of the other ingredients, 
not mask them.

Bean, Grain and Pasta Salads
Cooked beans, grains and pasta are popular main ingredients for bound salads. They are 
flavorful and filling and can be prepared without any animal products for people who 
prefer not to eat meat. The beans, grains and pasta may be used alone as in White Bean 
Salad (page 661) or in combination to create a range of tastes and textures. The texture 
of cooked beans, grains and pasta, which ranges from soft and tender to crunchy and 
chewy, adds to the salad’s appeal. Most of these salads are combined with such ingredi￾ents as cooked meats, fish, vegetables and greens, nuts, cheese and dried or fresh fruits 
and are bound with a vinaigrette.
The dressing selected for these salads should enhance the flavor of the main ingredi￾ent without overwhelming it. Cooked wheat berries can stand up to the pungent flavor of 
blue cheese dressing while a light citrus vinaigrette may be more appropriate for an orzo 
or quinoa salad. Add visual interest to these salads by combining cooked beans, grains or 
pasta with brightly colored raw or cooked vegetables such as bell peppers or carrots or 
greens such as arugula, kale or spinach. Strongly flavored garnishes such as cheese, diced 
onions or pomegranate seeds add bursts of flavor that contribute to their eating pleasure. 
Table 24.4 lists general guidelines for creating bean, grain and pasta salads.

TABLE 24.4
Cooked beans, grains and pasta are highly perishable TCS foods. Bound salads made from them should be kept well chilled and served promptly. Because beans and grains take time to cook, 
make large batches, then chill and freeze them for use when needed for a salad.

Vegetable Salads
Vegetable salads are made from cooked or raw vegetables or a combination of both. 
They can be served on buffets, as an appetizer or as a salad course. Like other salads, 
a successful vegetable salad combines color, texture and flavor. Some vegetable salads, 
such as coleslaw and carrot raisin salad, are bound with mayonnaise. Most vegetable 
salads, however, are made by either marinating the vegetables or tossing them with a 
vinaigrette dressing.
Almost any vegetable can be successfully marinated. The amount of time depends 
on the vegetable and the marinade, but several hours to overnight is usually sufficient 
for flavors to blend. Soft vegetables, such as mushrooms, zucchini and cucumbers, can 
be added directly to a cold marinade. Hard vegetables, such as carrots and cauliflower, 
should be blanched in salted water, refreshed, drained and then added to a cold mari￾nade. Carrots, artichokes, mushrooms, cauliflower, zucchini, pearl onions and the like 
are sometimes simmered quickly in a marinade flavored with lemon juice and olive oil 
and served cold. This style is called à la grecque.
Many marinated salads last several days under proper refrigeration. As the salads 
age in the marinade, they change in appearance and texture. This may or may not be 
desirable. For example, mushrooms and artichokes become more flavorful, whereas 
green vegetables become discolored by the acids in the marinade. If marinated salads 
are prepared in advance, check their appearance as well as their seasonings carefully 
at service time.

FRUIT AND GELATIN SALADS
Vibrant fruit and gelatin salads are popular dishes especially on breakfast, brunch and 
buffet menus. Most any type of fruit can be cut and tossed with an appropriate dressing. 
Fruit, vegetables, nuts and other ingredients may be bound in a liquid that is set with 
gelatin. When unmolded, the colorful ingredients are suspended in the flavorful liquid.
Fruit Salads
There are so many different fruits with beautiful bright colors and sweet, delicious fla￾vors that preparing fruit salads is easy work. Fruit salads are a refreshing addition to 
buffets and can be served as the first course of a lunch or at the conclusion of a dinner. 
A more elaborate fruit salad can be served as a light meal.
Always prepare fruit salads as close to service time as possible. The flesh of many 
types of fruit becomes soft and translucent if cut too long before service. Other fruits, 
such as apples, bananas and peaches, turn brown in a matter of minutes after cutting. 
Refer to Chapter 25, Fruits, for more information on this browning reaction and for 
information on specific fruits. (Sliced apples and pears, for example, can be tossed with 
lemon juice to prevent enzymatic browning.)
If a fruit salad is dressed at all, the dressing is usually sweet and typically made with 
honey or yogurt mixed with fruit juices or purées. Alternatively Grand Marnier, crème 
de menthe or other liqueurs sprinkled over the salad can serve as a dressing. Fruit sal￾ads can be tossed or composed and should offer the diner a pleasing blend of colors, 
shapes, sizes, flavors and textures.
Gelatin Salads
Gelatin salads are made from diced or sliced fresh fruits, drained canned fruits, cooked 
vegetables, cooked meat, poultry or fish, dried fruits or nuts coated with a flavorful liq￾uid into which gelatin has been dissolved. Gelatin binds or gels these ingredients into a 
firm yet tender mixture that melts in the mouth when eaten. Gelatin salads are closely 
related to aspic jelly, discussed in Chapter 28, Charcuterie. These cool, refreshing salads 
are served as a first course or accompaniment to main dishes. Gelatin salads, also known 
as congealed or gelled salads, are often prepared in decorative molds, then unmolded 
for service. Before beginning to make such dishes, familiarize yourself with gelatin, 
which is discussed in Chapter 30, Principles of the Bakeshop.
The ingredients added to gelatin salads must be chopped, diced, grated or sliced into 
uniform pieces so that each bite contains a taste of each ingredient in the salad. Almost 
any type of fresh fruit is suitable for gelatin salad; however, certain enzymes in raw figs, 
kiwi, mango, guava, pineapple and papaya interfere with gelatin’s ability to set. These 
fruits should not be used unless they are cooked or canned, as the heating process 
destroys this enzyme. Canned fruits or vegetables must be well drained before using.
The quantity of gelatin required to set a liquid varies depending on the ingredients 
used. One ounce (30 grams) of unflavored granulated gelatin sets 2 quarts (1.9 liters) of 
liquid into a firm mixture that is still tender and will melt in the mouth when eaten. (See 
Chapter 30, Principles of the Bakeshop.) But the addition of acids in the form of lemon 
juice, vinegar and acidic fruit juice will require more gelatin for the mixture to set. As 
much as 3 total ounces (90 grams) of gelatin may be needed to set the same quantity 
of an acidic liquid. Granulated gelatin must first be softened (bloomed) in cold liquid. 
The amount of liquid should be approximately four times the weight of the granulated 
gelatin (e.g., 2 tablespoons [30 milliliters] cold liquid to ¼ ounce [7 grams] granulated 
gelatin). Note that one envelope of granulated gelatin is ¼ ounce (7 grams).
Allow the gelatin mixture to set and thicken to the consistency of unwhipped egg 
whites in the refrigerator before adding the main ingredients. This step ensures that the 
pieces of food are evenly distributed in the gelatin. To create different layers in a gelatin 
salad, partially fill the mold with one mixture, then allow it to set until firm before add￾ing a different mixture. Note that the first mixture used will become the top layer of the 
unmolded dish.
M24_LABE1163_07_SE_C24.indd 761 31/10/23 8:45 PM762 CHaPTer TWenTY-FOUr
Always prepare gelatin salads in advance to ensure that the ingredients set properly in 
time for service. To speed the setting of gelatin, dissolve the gelatin in half of the heated 
liquid called for in the recipe. After the hot liquid is added, incorporate chilled liquid or 
crushed ice cubes equal to the remaining volume of cold liquid. As the ice melts, it chills 
the gelatin mixture so that it sets more quickly.
Flavored gelatin, which contains sugar and flavoring agents, is also a popular and 
convenient medium used to make gelatin salads. Commercially available in 5-pound 
(2.2-kilogram) bags, flavored gelatin is suitable for sweet fruit-based salads.
Gelatin salads are often accompanied by an emulsified dressing or savory cream 
sauce. Sweetened gelatin salads with fruits may be accompanied by sour cream, whipped 
cream or yogurt.
Procedure for Making Gelatin Salad
1 Prepare the ingredients for the gelatin salad. Peel, chop or dice and prepare all fruits and 
vegetables as required. Cook and thoroughly chill any ingredients such as meats, poultry, 
fish and vegetables.
2 Measure the quantity of gelatin. Soften the gelatin in cold water as described on page 761. 
Make sure that granulated gelatin is completely softened at this stage.
3 Combine the softened gelatin with the hot liquid, stirring to ensure that the gelatin is 
completely dissolved.
4 Chill the gelatin mixture in the refrigerator until slightly set and syrupy, approximately 
30–45 minutes.
5 For a layered salad, pour enough gelatin in the mold to anchor the first layer of ingredients.
6 For a blended salad, cool the gelatin until it is as thick as unwhipped egg whites before 
adding any prepared fruits, vegetables, nuts or other ingredients. Fold in additional 
ingredients then pour into one large mold or portion into timbales, decorative glasses or 
bowls for service. Chill until set.
7 To unmold, dip the bottom of the mold into a hot water bath for a few seconds. remove 
the mold from the water bath. dry the bottom of the mold then invert it onto a sheet tray 
or serving platter. gently lift off the mold and garnish the salad for service.

 After studying this chapter, 
you will be able to: 
25. 1 characterize and identify fruits 
25. 2 describe nutritional information for fruits 
25. 3 purchase and store fresh fruits 
appropriate for your needs

25. 5 understand and apply methods for juicing 
fruits 
25. 6 apply various cooking methods to fruits 
 Botanically, a fruit is an organ that develops from the ovary of a flowering plant and 
contains one or more seeds. Culinarily, a fruit is the perfect snack food, the basis 
of a dessert, colorful sauce or soup or an accompaniment to meat, fish, shellfish 
or poultry. No food group offers a greater variety of colors, flavors and textures than fruit. 
 this chapter identifies many of the fruits typically used by food service operations. it then 
addresses general considerations in purchasing fresh and preserved fruits. A discussion fol￾lows about some of the cooking methods presented in Chapter 10 , Principles of Cooking, 
as they apply to fruits. recipes in which fruit is the primary ingredient are presented at the 
chapter’s end. 
 IDENTIFYING FRUITS 
 This book presents fruits according to the ways most people view them and use them, 
rather than by rigid botanical classifications. Fruits are divided here into eight categories: 
berries, citrus, specialty fruits, grapes, melons, pomes, stone fruits and tropicals, accord￾ing to either their shape, seed structure or natural habitat. Botanically, tomatoes, beans, 
eggplant, capsicum peppers and other produce are fruits. But in ordinary thinking, they 
are not; they are vegetables and are discussed in Chapter 22 , Vegetables . 
 A fruit may have several names, varying from region to region or on a purveyor’s 
whim. Botanists are also constantly reclassifying items to fit new findings. The names we 
use in this chapter follow generally accepted custom and usage. 
 Berries 
 Berries are small, juicy fruits that grow on vines and bushes worldwide. Berries are char￾acterized by thin skins and many tiny seeds that are often so small they go unnoticed. 
Some of the fruits discussed in this section do not fit the botanical definition of berries 
(e.g., raspberries and strawberries) and we cover some fruits that are classified as berries 
botanically (e.g., bananas and grapes) elsewhere in the chapter. 
 Berries may be eaten plain or used in everything from beer to bread, soup to sorbet. 
They make especially fine jams and compotes. Berries must be fully ripened on the vine, 
as they will not ripen further after harvesting. Select berries that are plump and fully 
colored. Avoid juice-stained containers and berries with whitish-gray or black spots of 
mold. All berries should be refrigerated and used promptly. Do not wash berries until 
just before they are needed, as washing removes some of their aroma and softens them. 
 Blackberries 
 Blackberries are large and shiny berries, with a deep purple to black color. Thorny black￾berry vines are readily found in the wild; commercial production is limited. Loganberries, 
marionberries, olallieberries and boysenberries are blackberry hybrids. 
 Blueberries 
 Blueberries (Fr. myrtilles ) are small and firm, with a true blue to almost black skin and 
a juicy, light gray-blue interior. Cultivated berries (high-bush varieties) tend to be larger 
than wild (low-bush) ones. Blueberries are native to North America and are grown com￾mercially from Maine to Oregon and along the Atlantic seaboard. 
 Cranberries 
 Cranberries, another native North American food, are tart, firm fruit with a mottled red 
skin. They grow on low vines in cultivated bogs (swamps) throughout Massachusetts, 
Oregon, Washington State, Wisconsin and New Jersey. Rarely eaten raw, they are made 
 ripe fully grown and developed; a ripe fruit’s 
flavor, texture and appearance are at their 
peak, and the fruit is ready to use as food

into juice, sauce or relish or are used in breads, pies or pastries. Cranberries are available 
fresh, frozen and dried or made into a canned jelly-type sauce. Color does not indicate 
ripeness. Cranberries should be picked over before cooking and those that are soft or 
bruised should be discarded.
Currants
Currants are tiny, tart fruits that grow on shrubs in grapelike clusters. The most com￾mon currants are almost translucent red, but black and golden (or white) varieties also 
exist. All varieties are used for jams, jellies and sauces, and black currants are made into 
a liqueur, crème de cassis. Although rarely grown in the United States, currants are very 
popular and widely available in Europe, with a peak season during the late summer. 
(The dried fruit called currants are not produced from these berries; they are a special 
variety of dried grapes.)
Gooseberries
Several varieties of gooseberry are cultivated for culinary purposes. The European 
gooseberry is a member of the currant family that grows on spiny bushes in cool, 
moist regions. Its tart berries, which contain many seeds, are usually less than 1 inch 
(2.5 centimeters) in diameter. The skin, which is firm and smooth or only slightly hairy, 
can be green, white (actually gray-green), yellow or red. They are eaten fresh or used 
for preserves, desserts or as a traditional accompaniment to rich or fatty dishes, such as 
goose and mackerel. North American gooseberry varieties are smaller, perfectly round, 
and pink to deep red at maturity. Although more prolific, these varietals are generally 
considered inferior to European gooseberries.
Cape gooseberries, also known as physalis, are unrelated to European and American 
gooseberries. Native to Peru, cape gooseberries became popular during the 19th century 
along the African Cape of Good Hope, for which they are named. Indonesia and the 
Philippines are currently the largest producers. Cape gooseberries are covered with a 
paper-thin husk or calyx. About the size of cherries, they have a waxy, bright orange 
skin and many tiny seeds. Their flavor is similar to coconut and oranges, but tarter. Cape 
gooseberries may be eaten raw, made into jam or used in desserts. Fresh, they are an 
especially striking garnish.
Raspberries
Raspberries (Fr. framboises) are perhaps the most delicate of all fruits. They have a tart 
flavor and velvety texture. Red raspberries are the most common, although black, purple 
and golden berries are available. When ripe, the berry pulls away easily from its white 
core, leaving the characteristic hollow center. Because they can be easily crushed and 
are susceptible to mold, most of the raspberries grown are marketed frozen. Raspberries 
grow on thorny vines in cool climates, especially in the Pacific Northwest, throughout 
the Russian Federation and in Mexico.
Strawberries
Strawberries (Fr. fraises) are brilliant red, heart-shaped fruits that grow on vines. The 
strawberry plant is actually a perennial herb; the berry’s flesh is covered by tiny black 
seeds called achenes, which are the plant’s true fruits. Select berries with a good red 
color and intact green leafy hull. (The hulls can be easily removed with a paring knife.) 
Avoid berries with soft or brown spots.
The tiny wild or Alpine strawberries, known by their French name fraises des bois, 
have a particularly intense flavor and aroma. White strawberries originated in South 
America and are becoming popular because of their unusual appearance. They are very 
aromatic and sweet, with hints of pineapple and grape. A large white variety developed 
in Japan, known as hatsukoi no kaori, are especially flavorful and are highly prized in 
the specialty fruit market.

Limes
Valencia oranges Navel oranges
red grapefruits
Citrus
Citrus fruits include grapefruits, kumquats, lemons, limes, oranges, tangerines, yuzu and 
several hybrids. They are characterized by a thick rind, most of which is a bitter white 
pith (albedo) with a thin exterior layer of colored skin known as the zest. Their flesh is 
segmented and juicy. Citrus fruits are acidic, with a strong aroma; their flavors vary from 
bitter to tart to sweet.
Citrus fruits grow on trees and shrubs in tropical and subtropical climates worldwide. 
All citrus fruits are fully ripened on the tree and will not ripen further after harvesting. 
They should be refrigerated for longest storage.
Select fruits that feel heavy and have thin, smooth skins. Avoid those with large 
blemishes or moist spots.
Grapefruits
Grapefruits (Fr. pamplemousses) are large and round with a yellow 
skin, thick rind and tart flesh. They are an 18th-century hybrid 
of the orange and pummelo (a large, coarse fruit used 
mostly in Middle and Far Eastern cuisines). Two varieties 
of grapefruit are widely available all year: white-fleshed 
and pink- or ruby-fleshed. White grapefruits produce 
the finest juice, although pink grapefruits are sweeter. 
Fresh grapefruits are best eaten uncooked or topped 
with brown sugar and lightly broiled.
Kumquats
Kumquats are very small, oval-shaped, orange-colored fruits with a soft, sweet skin and 
slightly bitter flesh. They are eaten whole, either raw or preserved in syrup or jam.
Lemons
Lemons (Fr. citrons) are oval-shaped, bright yellow fruits with a strongly acidic flavor 
that makes them unpleasant to eat raw but perfect for flavoring desserts and confec￾tions. Lemon juice is also widely used in sauces, especially for fish, shellfish and 
poultry. Lemon zest is candied or used as garnish. The round, smooth-skinned and 
juicy Meyer lemon has a sweet, less acidic flavor and strong aroma. It may be used 
in place of common lemons, especially in desserts and sauces where lemon is the 
dominant flavor.
Limes
Limes (Fr. limons) are small fruits with thin skins ranging from 
yellow-green to dark green. Limes are too tart to eat raw and 
are often substituted for lemons in prepared dishes. They are 
also juiced or used in cocktails, curries or desserts. Lime zest 
can be grated and used to give color and flavor to a variety of 
dishes. The key lime is a small tart lime variety native to South Florida 
used to make key lime pie.
Oranges
Oranges (Sp. naranjas) are round fruits with a juicy, orange-colored 
flesh and a thin, orange skin. They can be either sweet or bitter.
Valencia oranges and navel oranges (a seedless variety) 
are the most popular sweet oranges in the United States. 
They can be juiced for beverages or sauces, and the flesh 
may be eaten raw, added to salads, cooked in desserts or 
used as a garnish. Orange zest may be grated or julienned 
for sauces or garnish.

tangerines
Blood oranges are also sweet but are small, with a rough, reddish skin. Their flesh is 
streaked with a blood-red color. Blood oranges are available primarily during the winter 
months and are eaten raw, juiced or used in salads or sauces.
When selecting sweet oranges, look for fruits that feel plump and heavy, with unblem￾ished skin. The color of the skin depends on weather conditions; a green rind does not 
affect the flavor of the flesh.
Bitter oranges include the Seville and bergamot. They are used primarily for the 
essential oils found in their zest. Oil of bergamot gives Earl Grey tea its distinctive flavor; 
oil of Seville is essential to curaçao, Grand Marnier and orange flower water. Seville 
oranges are also used in marmalades and sauces for meats and poultry.
Mandarin Oranges
Mandarin oranges are a group of small citrus characterized by their thin loose peels, 
intense flavor and perishability. Clementines, satsuma mandarins and tangerines are 
among the most popular mandarin varieties available. They are small with dark orange 
to red-orange skin. Their rind is loose and easily removed to reveal sweet, juicy, aro￾matic segments, which may or may not contain seeds. Mandarin oranges are most often 
eaten fresh out of hand but are available canned.
Tangelos are a hybrid of tangerines and grapefruits. They are the size of a medium 
orange with a bulbous stem end and few to no seeds.
Procedure for Segmenting Citrus Fruits
Blood oranges
Citrus segments, known as supremes, are 
made by first carefully cutting off the entire peel 
(including the bitter white pith) in even slices.
individual segments are then removed by gently 
cutting alongside each membrane.
Hybrids and Varieties
A number of fruits are extremely 
responsive to selective breeding 
and crossbreeding and have been 
experimented with by botanists and 
growers since at least the time of 
ancient rome. two distinct products 
are recognized: hybrids and varieties. 
Hybrids result from crossbreeding fruits 
from different species that are genetically 
unalike. By crossbreeding apricots and 
Japanese plums the result is a unique 
product marketed as a pluot. Citrus is 
particularly responsive to hybridization; 
for example, tangelos result from a cross 
between tangerines and grapefruits. 
Varieties result from breeding fruits of the 
same species that have different qualities 
or characteristics. Breeding two varieties 
of peaches, for instance, produces a third 
variety with the best qualities of both 
parents. For example, nectarines are a 
peach variety with smooth skin that are 
easier to eat than fuzzy peach varieties.

A five-hole zester, left, or a rasp grater, right, 
is used to remove paper-thin strips of the

Procedure for Zesting Citrus Fruits
Procedure for Cutting Citrus Peels
remove the zest using a peeler. Large strips of 
citrus zest may be used as a garnish or to flavor 
soups or sauces. Or cut the strips of zest into 
fine julienne to use as a flavoring or garnish.
Yuzu
Yuzu [YOO-zoo] is a sour citrus fruit from Japan. Its aromatic rind is used as a garnish 
and flavor enhancer. Tart yuzu juice is used by pastry chefs in confections and creams. 
Although the fresh fruit is rarely available in the United States, both the bottled juice and 
dried rind are available from specialty producers.
Specialty Fruits
Improved transportation has led to the increasing availability (although sporadic in some 
areas) of seasonal or unusual fresh fruits such as figs, persimmons, pomegranates, rhu￾barb and star fruits. Other specialty fruits, such as breadfruit, durian, feijoa, loquat and 
prickly pear, are still also available only on a limited basis from specialty purveyors but 
are not discussed here.

Persimmons
Figs
Figs (Fr. figues) are the fruit of ficus trees. They are small, soft, pear-shaped fruits with an 
intensely sweet flavor and rich, moist texture made crunchy by a multitude of tiny seeds. 
Fresh figs can be sliced and served in salads or with cured meats such as prosciutto. Figs 
can also be baked, poached or used in jams, preserves or compotes.
Dark-skinned figs, known as Mission figs, are a variety originally planted at Pacific Coast 
missions during the 18th century. They have a thin skin and small seeds and are available 
fresh, canned or dried. White-skinned figs grown commercially include the White Adriatic, 
used principally for drying and baking, and the all-purpose Kadota. The most important 
domestic fig variety, however, is the Calimyrna fig. These large figs have a rich greenish 
yellow skin and nutty-flavored flesh. Fresh Calimyrna figs are the finest for eating out of 
hand; they are also available dried. For the best flavor, figs should be fully ripened on the 
tree. Unfortunately fully ripened figs are very delicate and difficult to transport.
Guava
Guava [GWAH-vah] are small, oval or pear-shaped fruits with a strong fragrance and a mild, 
slightly grainy flesh. They are excellent in jams and preserves, and guava juice is available 
plain or blended with other tropical fruit juices. Guava paste (Sp. pasta de guayaba), a 
thick, sliceable gel, is a popular treat throughout Central America and the Caribbean. Guava, 
which will ripen if stored at room temperature, is best when slightly soft and fully ripened.
Lychees
The lychee [LEE-chee], also spelled litchi or leechee, is the fruit of a large tree native to 
southern China and Southeast Asia. The fruit, which grows in clusters, is oval to round, 
red and about 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) in diameter. The tough outer skin encloses juicy, 
white, almost translucent flesh and one large seed. Neither the skin nor the seed is 
edible. The fruit travels well and is now cultivated in Florida and Hawaii, so supplies are 
relatively stable. Lychees are eaten fresh out of hand or juiced and are widely available 
canned or dried. Fresh lychees are mild but sweet with a pleasant aroma.
Mangosteens
The mangosteen, another native of Southeast Asia, is cultivated in Java, Sumatra and 
the Philippines. Mangosteens (no relation to mangos) are the size of small oranges and 
have flattened ends. They have a thick, hard, deep reddish-purple rind with hard, white, 
 petal-shaped protrusions at the stem end. The interior flesh is snow-white and seg￾mented, looking something like a mandarin orange. The texture is juicy and delicate 
with a slightly astringent flavor. Because the fruit must ripen on the tree and keeps 
only a short time after harvest, it is rarely found fresh except in outdoor local markets. 
Mangosteens are usually eaten fresh, although canned fruit and juice is available.
Persimmons
Persimmons, sometimes referred to as kaki or Sharon fruits, are a bright orange, round 
or acorn-shaped fruit, roughly the same size as apples, with glossy skin and large papery 
blossoms. The flesh is bright orange and jellylike, with a mild but rich flavor similar to 
honey and plums. Persimmons should be peeled before use; any seeds should be dis￾carded. Select bright orange fruits and refrigerate only after they are completely 
ripe. When ripe, persimmons are very soft, and the skin has an almost 
translucent appearance.
Ripe persimmons are delicious eaten raw; halved and topped 
with cream or soft cheese; or peeled, sliced and added to fruit 
salads. Persimmon bread, muffins, cakes and pies are also popu￾lar. Underripe persimmons are almost inedible, however. They 
are strongly tannic with a chalky or cottony texture. Persimmons 
are tree fruits grown in subtropical areas worldwide, although the Asian 
varieties—now also grown in California—are the most common.

Pomegranates
An ancient fruit native to Persia (now Iran), pomegranates [POM-uh-gran-uhtz] have 
long been a subject of poetry and a symbol of fertility. Pomegranates are round, about 
the size of large oranges, with pronounced calyx. The skin forms a hard shell with a 
 pinkish-red color. The interior is filled with hundreds of small, red seeds (which are, 
botanically, the actual fruits) surrounded by juicy, red pulp (also referred to as pome￾granate arils). An inedible yellow membrane separates the seeds into compartments. 
Pomegranates are sweet-sour, and the seeds are pleasantly crunchy. The bright-red seeds 
make an attractive garnish and are a good source of antioxidants. Pomegranate juice is a 
popular beverage in Mediterranean cuisines, and grenadine syrup is made from concen￾trated pomegranate juice.
Select heavy fruits that are not rock-hard, cracked or heavily bruised. Whole pome￾granates can be refrigerated for several weeks.
Rambutans
Rambutans [ram-BOOT-enz], the fruit of a tree in the 
soapberry family, are closely related to lychees. 
Native to Malaysia, they are now cultivated 
throughout Southeast Asia. The bright-red, 
oval fruit is about the size of a small hen’s 
egg and is covered with long, soft spines. 
The interior has a white, lightly acidic pulp. 
Rambutans darken with age, so select brightly 
colored fruit with soft, fleshy spines. Rambutans 
are eaten fresh and used in preserves and ice 
cream; they are also available canned.
Rhubarb
Although botanically a vegetable, rhubarb [ROO-barb] is most often prepared as a fruit. It 
is a perennial plant that grows well in temperate and cold climates. Only the pinkish-red 
stems are edible; the leaves contain high amounts of oxalic acid, which is toxic.
Rhubarb stems are extremely acidic, requiring the addition of large amounts of sugar 
to create the desired sweet-sour taste. They are excellent for pies, cobblers, preserves or 
stewing. Cinnamon, ginger, orange and strawberry are particularly compatible with rhu￾barb. Young, tender stalks do not need to be peeled. When cooked, rhubarb becomes 
very soft and turns a beautiful light-pink color.
Fresh rhubarb is sold as whole stalks, with the leaves removed. Select crisp, unblem￾ished stalks. Frozen rhubarb pieces are readily available and work well for pies, tarts 
or jams.
Star Fruits
Star fruits, also known as carambola, are oval, up to 5 inches (12.5 centimeters) long, 
with five prominent ribs or wings running their length. A cross-section cut is shaped like 
a star. The edible skin is a waxy orange-yellow; it covers a dry, paler yellow flesh. The 
flavor is similar to that of plums, sweet but bland. Star fruits do not need to be peeled or 
seeded. They are most often sliced unpeeled and added to fruit salad or 
used as a garnish. Unripe fruits can be cooked in stews 
or chutneys.
Color and aroma are the best indicators of ripe￾ness. Star fruits should be a deep golden-yellow, and 
there should be brown along the edge of the ribs. 
The aroma should be full and floral. Green fruits can 
be kept at room temperature to ripen, then refrigerated 
for up to 2 weeks. Star fruits are cultivated in Hawaii, 
Florida and California, though some are still imported from 
the Caribbean.

Grapes
Grapes (Fr. raisins; Sp. uvas) are the single largest fruit crop in the world, due to their use 
in wine making. This section, however, discusses only table grapes, those grown for eat￾ing. Grapes are berries that grow on vines in large clusters. California is among the world’s 
larger producers, with more than a dozen varieties grown for table use. Grapes are classi￾fied by color as white (which are actually green) or black (which are actually red). White 
grapes are generally blander than black ones, with a thinner skin and firmer flesh.
The grape’s color and most of its flavor are found in the skin. Grapes are usually 
eaten raw, either alone or in fruit salads. They are also used as a garnish or accompani￾ment to desserts and cheeses. Dried grapes are known as raisins (Fr. raisins sec; dried 
Thompson Seedless or muscat grapes), currants (dried Black Corinth grapes labeled 
Zante currants) or sultanas (dried sultana grapes).
Grapes are available all year because the many varieties have different harvesting 
schedules. Look for firm, unblemished fruits that are firmly attached to the stem. A surface 
bloom or dusty appearance is caused by yeasts and indicates recent harvesting. Wrinkled 
grapes or those with brown spots around the stem are past their prime. All grapes should 
be rinsed and drained before use. Red Flame grapes are a seedless California hybrid. 
They are large and round with a slightly tart flavor and variegated red color.
The most commercially important table grapes are the Thompson Seedless variety, 
which are pale green with a crisp texture and sweet flavor. Many are dried in the hot desert 
sun of California’s San Joaquin Valley to produce dark raisins. For golden raisins, Thompson 
Seedless grapes are treated with sulfur dioxide to prevent browning, then dried mechanically.
Of the table grapes containing seeds, the most important varieties are the Concord, 
Ribier and Emperor. These varieties range from light red to deep black. Concord grapes, 
one of the few grape varieties native to North America, are especially important for mak￾ing juices and jellies.
Virtually all the fine wine made in the world comes from varieties of a single grape 
species, Vitis vinifera. It is grown in the United States, Europe, South Africa, South 
America, the Middle East, Australia and wherever fine wine is made. The variety of 
grapes used in any given wine determines the wine’s character, as discussed in Chapter 7, 
Flavor and Flavorings.
 Melons
Like pumpkins and cucumbers, melons are members of the gourd family (Cucurbitaceae). 
The dozens of melon varieties can be divided into two general types: muskmelons, also 
known as sweet (or dessert) melons, and watermelons. Muskmelons have a tan, green or 
yellow netted or furrowed rind and dense, fragrant flesh. Watermelons have a thick, dark 
green rind surrounding crisp, watery flesh.
Melons are almost 90 percent water, so cooking destroys their texture, quickly turning 
the flesh to mush. Most melons are served simply sliced, perhaps with a bit of lemon 
or lime juice. They also work well in fruit salads or with rich, cured meats such as pro￾sciutto. Melons may be puréed and made into sorbet or a chilled, uncooked soup.
Although they will continue to soften once picked, melons do not develop additional 
sweetness after harvest and should be vine-ripened. A ripe melon should have a strong 
aroma and yield slightly and spring back when pressed at the blossom end (opposite the 
stem). Avoid melons that are very soft or feel damp at the stem end. Ripe melons may be 
stored in the refrigerator, although the flavor is better at room temperature. Slightly under￾ripe melons can be stored at room temperature to allow flavor and aroma to develop.
Muskmelons
American cantaloupes, which are a type of muskmelon, have a thick, yellow-green 
netted rind, a sweet, moist, orange flesh and a strong aroma. (European cantaloupes are 
craggier and more furrowed in appearance.) As with all sweet melons, the many small 
seeds are found in a central cavity. Cantaloupes are excellent for eating alone and are 
especially good with ham or rich meats. Avoid cantaloupes with the pronounced yellow 
color or moldy aroma that indicates overripeness.

Watermelon
Green honeydews
Crenshaw melons Casaba melons
Gold honeydews
Gold watermelon
The casaba melon is a teardrop-shaped sweet melon. It has 
a coarse, yellow skin and a thick, ridged rind; its flesh is 
creamy-white to yellow. Casaba melons do 
not have an aroma. Look for an intense 
golden skin color and the absence of 
dark or moist patches.
Crenshaw (or cranshaw) mel￾ons have a mottled, green-yellow, 
ridged rind and orange-pink flesh. 
They are large, pear-shaped, sweet 
melons with a strong aroma. The flesh 
has a rich, spicy flavor and may be used 
like cantaloupe.
Honeydew melons are large, oval, sweet 
melons with a smooth rind that ranges from 
white to pale green. Although honeydew 
flesh is generally pale green, with a mild, 
sweet flavor, pink- or gold-fleshed hon￾eydews are also available. Like casaba 
melons, honeydew melons have little 
to no aroma.
Watermelons
Watermelons are large—up to 30 pounds (13.5 kilograms)—round or oval-shaped 
melons with a thick rind. The skin may be solid green, green-striped or mottled with 
white. The flesh is crisp and extremely juicy with small, hard, black seeds through￾out. Seedless hybrids are available. Most watermelons have pink to red flesh, although 
golden-fleshed varieties are available. They are native to tropical Africa and are grown 
commercially in several southern states.

Pomes
Pomes are tree fruits with thin skin and firm flesh surrounding a central core containing 
many small seeds called pips or carpels. Pomes include apples, pears and quince.
Apples
Apples (Fr. pommes), perhaps the most common and commonly appreciated of all fruits, 
grow on trees in temperate zones worldwide. They are popular because of their conve￾nience, flavor, variety and availability. Apples can be eaten out of hand, or they can be 
used in a wide variety of cooked or baked dishes. They can be incorporated in breads, 
desserts or vegetable dishes and go well with game, pork and poultry. Classic dishes pre￾pared with apples are often referred to as à la Normande, a reference to the Normandy 
region of France where apples flourish. Apple juice (cider) can be made into alcoholic 
and nonalcoholic beverages and cider vinegar.
Of the hundreds of known apple varieties, only 20 or so are commercially significant 
in the United States. Several varieties and their characteristics are noted in Table 25.1. 
Most apples have a moist, creamy-white flesh with a thin skin of yellow, green or red. 
They range in flavor from very sweet to very tart, with an equally broad range of tex￾tures, from firm and crisp to soft and mealy.
In Europe apples are divided into distinct cooking and eating varieties. Cooking variet￾ies are those that disintegrate to a purée when cooked. American varieties are less rigidly 
classified. Nevertheless not all apples are appropriate for all types of cooking. Firm apples 
that retain their shape better during cooking are the best choices when slices or appear￾ance are important. Apple varieties with a higher malic acid content break down easily, 
making them more appropriate for applesauce or juicing. Any type of apples may be 
eaten out of hand, depending on personal preference.
Although not native to North America, apples are now grown commercially in 
32 states, with Washington, New York and Michigan leading in production. Apples are 
harvested when still slightly underripe, then stored in a controlled atmosphere (in which 
temperature and oxygen are greatly reduced) for extended periods until ready for sale.
When selecting apples, look for smooth, unbroken skins and firm fruits, without 
soft spots or bruises. Badly bruised or rotting apples should be discarded immediately 
because they emit ethylene gas that speeds spoilage of nearby fruits. (Remember the say￾ing that “one bad apple spoils the barrel.”) Store apples chilled for up to 6 weeks. Apple 
peels (the skin) may be eaten or removed as desired, but all peeled and unpeeled apples 
should be washed just before use to remove pesticides and any wax that was applied to 
improve appearance. Apple slices can be frozen (often with sugar or citric acid added to 
slow spoilage) or dried.

Pears
Pears (Fr. poires) are an ancient tree fruit grown 
in temperate areas throughout the world. Most of 
the pears marketed in the United States are grown 
in California, Washington and Oregon. Although 
thousands of pear varieties have been identified, only 
a dozen or so are commercially significant. Several variet￾ies and their characteristics are noted in Table 25.2. Pear 
varieties vary widely in size, color and flavor. They are 
most often eaten out of hand but can be baked or poached. 
Pears are delicious with cheese, especially blue cheeses, and can be used in fruit salads, 
compotes or preserves.
Asian pears, also known as Chinese pears or apple-pears, are a different species 
than western pears. They have the moist, sweet flavor of a pear and the round shape 
and crisp texture of an apple. Asian pears are increasingly popular in the United States, 
particularly the Twentieth Century or Nijisseiki varieties.
When selecting pears, look for fruits with smooth, unbroken 
skin and intact stems. Pears do not ripen properly on the tree, so 
they are picked while still firm and should be allowed to soften 
before use. Underripe pears may be left at room temperature to 
ripen. A properly ripened pear has a good fragrance and yields 
to gentle pressure at the stem end. Pears can be prepared or 
stored in the same ways as apples.

Quince
Common quince [kwince; Fr. coing] resemble large, lumpy, yellow 
pears. Their flesh is hard, with many pips or seeds, and they have 
a wonderful fragrance. Too astringent to eat raw, quince develop a 
sweet flavor and pink color when cooked with sugar. Quince are 
used in meat stews, jellies, marmalades and pies. They have a high 
pectin content and may be added to other fruit jams or preserves to 
encourage gelling.
Select firm fruits with a uniform yellow color. Small blemishes may be cut away 
before cooking. Quince will keep for up to a month under refrigeration.
Stone Fruits
Stone fruits, also known as drupes, include apricots, cherries, nectarines, peaches and 
plums. They are characterized by a thin skin, soft flesh and single, woody stones or pits. 
Although most originated in China, the shrubs and trees that produce stone fruits are 
now grown in temperate climates worldwide.
North American varieties of stone fruits are in season from late spring through summer. 
They tend to be fragile fruits, are easily bruised and difficult to transport, and have a short 
shelf life. Do not wash stone fruits until ready to use, as moisture can cause deterioration. 
Stone fruits are excellent dried and are often used to make liqueurs and brandies. (The 
kernel inside the pits of many stone fruits contains amygdalin, a compound that has a 
bitter almond flavor. Eating the raw kernel can cause digestive discomfort or more seri￾ous side effects and should be avoided. When cooked it is harmless and can add flavor 
to jams and creams.)
Apricots
Apricots (Fr. abricots) are small, round stone fruits with velvety skin. They vary in color 
from deep yellow to vivid orange. The juicy, orange flesh of apricots surrounds a dark, 
almond-shaped pit. Apricots can be eaten out of hand, poached, stewed, baked or can￾died. They are often used in fruit compotes or savory sauces for meat or poultry and are 
also popular in quick breads and fruit tarts or puréed for dessert sauces, jams, custards 
or mousses.
Apricots have a short season and do not travel well. Select apricots that are well 
shaped, plump and fairly firm. Avoid greenish-yellow or mushy fruit. Fresh apricots last 
for several days under refrigeration, but their flavor is best at room temperature. If fresh 
fruits are unavailable, canned apricots are usually an acceptable substitute. Dried apri￾cots and apricot juice (known as nectar) are readily available.
Cherries
The two most important types of cherries in North America are sweet cherries, grown pri￾marily in Michigan, and sour (or tart) cherries, grown primarily in Oregon and New York.
Sweet cherries (Fr. cerises) are round to heart-shaped, about 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) 
in diameter, with skin that ranges from yellow to deep red to nearly black. The flesh, 
which is sweet and juicy, may vary from yellow to dark red. The most common and 
popular sweet cherries are the dark-red Bing cherries, followed by the yellow-red 
Royal Ann and Rainier cherries.
Sweet cherries are marketed fresh, frozen, canned and dried, made into bright red, 
sweet maraschino cherries or candied for use in baked goods. Cherries do not ripen fur￾ther after harvesting. Select fruits that are firm and plump with a green stem still attached. 
There should not be any brown spots around the stem. A dry or brown stem indicates 
that the cherry is less than fresh. Once the stem is removed, the cherry will deteriorate 
rapidly. Store fresh cherries in the refrigerator and do not wash them until ready to use.
Sour cherries are light to dark red and are so acidic they are rarely eaten uncooked. 
The most common sour cherries are the Montmorency and Morello. Most sour cherries 
are canned or frozen, or cooked with sugar and starch (usually cornstarch or tapioca) and 
sold as prepared pastry and pie fillings. Both sweet and sour cherries are available dried.

 Peaches and Nectarines 
Peaches (Fr. pêches ) are round fruits with a juicy, sweet flesh. Nectarines are a variety 
of peach. The main difference between peaches and nectarines are their skins. Peaches 
have a thin skin covered with fuzz, whereas nectarines have a thin, smooth skin. The 
flesh of either fruit ranges from white to pale orange. Although their flavors are some￾what different, they may be substituted for each other in most recipes. 
 Peaches and nectarines are excellent for eating out of hand or in dessert tarts or 
pastries. They are also used in jams, chutneys, preserves and savory relishes, having a 
particular affinity for Asian and Indian dishes. Although the skin is edible, peaches are 
generally peeled before being used. (Peaches are easily peeled if blanched first.) 
 Peaches and nectarines are either freestones or clingstones. In freestones, the flesh 
separates easily from the stone; freestone fruits are commonly eaten out of hand. The 
flesh of clingstones adheres firmly to the stone; they hold their shape better when cooked 
and are the type most often canned. 
 Select fruits with a good aroma; an overall creamy, yellow or yellow-orange color; 
and unwrinkled skin free of blemishes. Red patches are not an indication of ripeness; 
a green skin indicates that the fruit was picked too early and it will not ripen further. 
Peaches and nectarines soften but do not become sweeter after they are harvested. 
 California is the largest producer of peaches and nectarines in the United States, fol￾lowed by South Carolina and Georgia. Canned and frozen peaches are readily available. 
 Plums 
 Plums (Fr. prunes ) are round to oval-shaped fruits that grow on trees or bushes. Dozens 
of plum varieties are known, although only a few are commercially significant. Plums 
vary in size from very small to 3 inches (7.5 centimeters) in diameter. Their thin skins can 
be green, red, yellow or various shades of blue-purple. 
 Plums are excellent for eating out of hand. Plums can also be baked, poached or used 
in pies, cobblers or tarts; they are often used in jams or preserves, and fresh slices can 
be used in salads or compotes. 
 When selecting plums, look for plump, smooth fruits with unblemished skin. 
Generally they should yield to gentle pressure, although the green and yellow varieties 
remain quite firm. Avoid plums with moist, brown spots near the stem. Plums may be left 
at room temperature to ripen, then stored in the refrigerator. Prunes, discussed later, are 
produced by drying special plum varieties, usually the French Agen. 
 Tropical Fruits 
 Tropical fruits are native to the world’s hot, tropical or subtropical regions. Most are 
readily available throughout the United States thanks to rapid transportation and distri￾bution methods. All can be eaten fresh, without cooking. The flavors of tropical fruits 
complement each other and go well with rich or spicy meat, fish and poultry dishes.

Bananas
Common yellow bananas (Fr. bananes) are actually the berries of a large tropical herb. 
Grown in bunches called hands, bananas are about 7–9 inches (17.5–22.5 centimeters) long, 
with a sticky, soft, sweet flesh. Their inedible yellow skin is easily removed. Small “baby” 
bananas (Niño, Lady Finger or finger bananas) measure 4–5 inches (10–12.5 centimeters) 
long and have yellow or red skin. Their flesh is denser and sweeter than most larger banana 
varieties, and their size makes them ideal for many dessert applications.
Properly ripened bananas are excellent eaten out of hand or in salads. Lightly bruised 
or overripe fruits are best for breads or muffins. Their unique flavor is also comple￾mented by curry, cinnamon, ginger, honey and chocolate.
Fresh bananas are available all year. Bananas are always harvested when still green, 
because the texture and flavor is adversely affected if the fruits are allowed to turn 
yellow on the tree. Unripe bananas are hard, dry and starchy. Because bananas ripen 
after harvesting, it is acceptable to purchase green bananas if there is sufficient time for 
final ripening before use. Bananas should be left at room temperature to ripen. A prop￾erly ripened banana has a yellow peel with brown flecks. The tip of a ripe banana 
should not have any remaining green coloring. As bananas continue to age, the peel 
darkens and the starches turn to sugar, giving the fruits a sweeter flavor. Avoid 
bananas that have large brown bruises or a gray cast (a sign of cold damage).
Plantains, also referred to as cooking bananas, are larger than but not 
as sweet as common bananas. They are frequently cooked as a starchy veg￾etable in tropical cuisines.
Dates
Dates (Fr. dattes) are the fruits of the date palm tree, 
which has been cultivated since ancient times. Dates are 
about 1–2 inches (2.5–5 centimeters) long, with a paper￾thin skin and single grooved seed. Most dates are golden to dark 
brown when ripe.
Heirloom Varieties and Genetic Diversity
David Mas Masumoto, a third-generation 
Japanese American peach farmer, writes 
eloquently of an old variety of peaches grown 
in his orchards. the sun Crest peach, he 
claims, melts in the mouth with “the message 
of summer” in every bite. Because it doesn’t 
keep well when picked fully ripe, this variety 
is less suited to the demands of commercial 
agriculture. in his book Epitaph for a Peach, 
Masumoto writes of the challenges faced by a 
small family farmer and trying to find a market 
for these unique peaches.
Many chefs and home gardeners seek 
out older or heirloom varieties like those that 
Masumoto and his daughter, Nikiko, grow. 
Despite the fact that they may bruise easily or 
be irregular in size and appearance, heirloom 
fruits and vegetables are appealing because of 
their unique flavor and suitability to specific 
growing conditions. According to botanists 
and farmers, these neglected varieties are 
also essential to ensuring a continued food 
supply. the intensive agriculture on which the 
world’s food supply increasingly depends 
means less genetic diversity. With less 
diversity, crops become more vulnerable to 
insect and environmental stress. recognizing 
the need to protect all species, the usDA has 
organized the National Plant Germplasm 
system (NPGs), a collection of state, 
federal and private farms where genetically 
diverse assortments of plants are grown and 
distributed. More than 30 such repositories 
or farms exist across the country. there, 
countless species of stone fruits, berries, 
legumes, nuts and all manner of plants are 
grown to enhance breeding for future fruit 
and vegetable crops. seeds of wild species are 
stored for future propagation.
Organizations such as slow Food usA are 
good resources for more information about 
fruits, vegetables and other food products for 
which cultivation is in jeopardy. slow Food’s 
Ark of taste is a catalog of more than 3500 
cherished and delicious foods in danger of 
extinction, including the Blenheim apricot, the 
Hatcher mango and Masumoto’s beloved 
sun Crest peach.

Kiwis
Mangoes
Although dates appear to be dried, they are actually fresh fruits. They have a 
 sticky-sweet, almost candied texture and rich flavor. Dates provide flavor and moisture 
to breads, muffins, cookies and tarts. They can also be served with fresh or dried fruits 
or stuffed with meat or cheese as an appetizer.
Pitted dates are available in several packaged forms: whole, chopped or extruded (for 
use in baking). Whole unpitted dates are available in bulk. Date juice is also available 
for use as a beverage and date syrup is a natural sweetener used in baked goods. When 
selecting dates, look for those that are plump, glossy and moist.
Dragon Fruit
Dragon fruit are any of several species of the Cactaceae family native to South America 
now widely grown in tropical climates. About the size of eggplants with a flavor that 
resembles a kiwi or melon, the fruit is eaten raw and made into a refreshing juice. The 
waxy peel should be removed with a paring knife before serving.
Kiwis
Kiwis, sometimes known as kiwifruits or Chinese gooseberries, 
are small oval fruits, about the size of large eggs, with thin, fuzzy, 
brown skin. The flesh is bright green or golden yellow with a 
white core surrounded by hundreds of tiny black seeds.
Kiwis are sweet, but somewhat bland. They are best used 
raw, peeled and eaten out of hand or sliced for fruit salads 
or garnish. Although kiwis are not recommended for cooking, 
they are a perfect addition to glazed fruit tarts and can be puréed 
for sorbets, sauces or mousses. Kiwis contain an enzyme similar to 
that in fresh pineapple and papaya, which has a tenderizing effect on meat and prevents 
gelling. They should not be used in salads bound with gelatin.
Mangoes
Mangoes (Fr. mangues) are oval or kidney-shaped fruits that normally weigh between 
6 ounces and 1 pound (180 and 480 grams) each. Their skin is smooth and thin but 
tough, varying from yellow to orange-red, with patches of green, red or purple. As man￾goes ripen, the green disappears. The juicy, bright-orange flesh clings to a large, flat pit.
Dragon fruit
➊ Cut along each side of the pit to remove 
two sections.
➋ Cube each section using the “hedgehog” 
technique: Make crosswise cuts through the 
flesh, just to the skin; press up on the skin side 
of the section, exposing the cubes.
➌ serve the mango “hedgehog” whole or cut 
off the cubes to use in salads or other dishes.

Pineapples
A mango’s unique flavor is spicy-sweet, with an acidic tang. Mangoes can be puréed for 
use in drinks or sauces, or the flesh can be sliced or cubed for use in salads, pickles, chut￾neys or desserts. Mangoes go well with spicy foods such as curry and with barbecued meats.
Although Florida produces some mangoes, most of those available in the United States 
are from Mexico and Central America. Select fruits with good color that are firm and free of 
blemishes. Ripe mangoes should have a good aroma and should not be too soft or shriveled. 
Allow mangoes to ripen completely at room temperature, then refrigerate for up to 1 week.
Papayas
The papaya [puh-PIE-yuh] is a greenish-yellow fruit shaped rather like a large pear and 
weighing 1–2 pounds (500–1000 grams). When halved, a papaya resembles a melon. The 
flesh is golden to reddish-pink; its center cavity is filled with round, silver-black seeds 
resembling caviar. Ripe papayas can be eaten raw, with only a squirt of lemon or lime 
juice. They can also be puréed for sweet or spicy sauces, chilled soups or sorbets.
Papayas contain papain, which breaks down proteins and makes them an excellent 
meat tenderizer. Meats can be marinated with papaya juice or slices before cooking. The 
papain in fresh papayas, however, makes them unsuitable for use in gelatins because it 
inhibits gelling. Unripe (green) papayas are often used in pickles or chutneys and can be 
baked or stewed with meat or poultry.
Papaya seeds are edible, with a peppery flavor and slight crunch. They are occasion￾ally used to garnish fruit salads or add flavor to fruit salsas and compotes.
Papayas are grown in tropical and subtropical areas worldwide. Select papayas that 
are plump, with a smooth, unblemished skin. Color is a better determinant of ripeness 
than is softness: The greater the proportion of yellow to green skin color, the riper the 
fruit. Papayas may be held at room temperature until completely ripe, then refrigerated 
for up to 1 week.
Passion Fruits
Passion fruits (Fr. fruits de la passion) have a firm, almost shell-like purple skin with 
orange-yellow pulp surrounding large, black, edible seeds. They are about the size 
and shape of large hen eggs, with a sweet, rich and unmistakable citrusy flavor. 
The pulp can be eaten fresh directly from the shell and is 
used in custards, sauces and ice creams.
Ripe passion fruits are heavy with well-wrinkled 
skin that is dark purple or yellowish orange. Allow 
them to ripen at room temperature if necessary, 
then refrigerate. Passion fruits are grown in 
New Zealand, Florida, Hawaii and Puerto Rico. 
Frozen packs of purée are readily available and pro￾vide a strong, true flavor.
Pineapples
Pineapples (Fr. ananas) are the fruits of a shrub with sharp, 
spear-shaped leaves. Each fruit is covered with rough, brown 
eyes, giving it the appearance of a pinecone. The pale-yellow 
flesh, which is sweet and very juicy, surrounds a cylindrical, 
woody core that is edible but too tough for most uses. Most pineap￾ples weigh approximately 2 pounds (1 kilogram), but dwarf varieties 
are also available.
Pineapples are excellent eaten raw, alone or in salads. Slices 
can be baked or grilled to accompany pork or ham. The cuisines of 
Southeast Asia incorporate pineapple into various curries, soups and 
stews. Pineapple juice is a popular beverage, often used in punch or 
cocktails. Canned or cooked pineapple can be added to gelatin mix￾tures, but avoid using fresh pineapple; an enzyme (bromelain) found in 
fresh pineapple breaks down gelatin.

Pineapples do not ripen after harvesting although they will continue to soften once 
picked. They must be left on the stem until completely ripe, at which time they are 
extremely perishable. Pineapples are indigenous to Latin America; most of the world’s 
production now comes from Central America, the Philippines and Indonesia. Select 
heavy fruits with a strong, sweet aroma and rich color. Avoid those with dried leaves or 
soft spots. Pineapples should be used as soon as possible after purchase. Pineapples are 
also available canned in slices, cubes or crushed, dried or candied.
Procedure for Trimming and Slicing Pineapples
➊ slice off the leaves and stem end. stand 
the fruit upright and cut the peel off in vertical 
strips.
➋ Cut the peeled fruit in quarters, then cut 
away the woody core.
➌ Cut the flesh as desired.
NUTRITIONAL INFORMATION FOR FRUITS
Most fruits are quite nutritious. They have a high water content (usually 75–95 percent) 
and low protein and fat contents, all of which makes them low in calories. They are also 
excellent sources of dietary fiber, much of which is found in the edible peels of such 
fruit as apples, mangoes and pears. The sugar content of ripe fruits is a good source of 
energy. Some fruits, such as citrus, melons and strawberries, contain large amounts of 
vitamin C (which may be destroyed, however, by cooking or processing). Deep yellow 
and green fruits, such as apricots, mangoes and kiwis, are high in vitamin A; bananas, 
raisins and figs are a good source of potassium.
PURCHASING AND STORING FRESH FRUITS
Fresh fruits have not been subjected to any processing (e.g., canning, freezing or dry￾ing). Fresh fruits may be ripe or unripe, depending on their condition when harvested 
or the conditions under which they have been stored. To use fresh fruits to their best 
advantage, it is important to make careful purchasing decisions. Pay attention to the size 
of each piece of fruit, its grade or quality, its ripeness on delivery and how it is stored in 
order to serve fruit in an appropriate and cost-effective manner. The prime growing sea￾sons for each fruit depend on the region of the country where it is grown. Speak to your 
produce supplier and local farmers to learn what is available seasonally in your location.
 Grading
Fresh fruits may be graded under the USDA’s voluntary program. The grades, based on size 
and uniformity of shape, color and texture as well as the absence of defects, are U.S. Fancy, 
U.S. No. 1, U.S. No. 2 and U.S. No. 3. Most fruits purchased for food service operations are 
U.S. Fancy. Lower grades are suitable for processing into sauces, jams, jellies or preserves.
M25_LABE1163_07_SE_C25.indd 798 31/10/23 8:50 PMFruits 799
Ripening
Several important changes take place in a fruit as it ripens. The fruit reaches its full size; 
its pulp or flesh becomes soft and tender; and its color changes. In addition, the fruit’s 
acid content declines, making it less tart, and its starch content converts into the sugars 
fructose and glucose, which provide sweetness, flavor and aroma.
Unfortunately these changes do not stop when the fruit reaches its peak of ripeness. 
Rather they continue, deteriorating the fruit’s texture and flavor and eventually causing 
spoilage.
Depending on the species, fresh fruits can be purchased either fully ripened or unrip￾ened. (See Table 25.3.) Figs and pineapples, for example, ripen only on the plant and 
are harvested at or just before their peak of ripeness, then rushed to market. These fruits 
should not be purchased unripened as they will never attain full flavor or texture after 
harvesting. On the other hand, some fruits, including bananas and pears, continue to 
ripen after harvesting and can be purchased unripened.
With most harvested fruits, the ripening time as well as the time during which the fruits 
remain at their peak of ripeness can be manipulated. For instance, ripening can be delayed 
by chilling. Chilling slows the fruit’s respiration rate (fruits, like animals, consume oxygen 
and expel carbon dioxide). The slower the respiration rate, the slower the conversion of 
starch to sugar. For quicker ripening, fruit can be stored at room temperature.
Ripening is also affected by ethylene gas, a colorless, odorless hydrocarbon gas. 
Ethylene gas is naturally emitted by ripening fruits and can be used to encourage further 
ripening in most fruits. Apples, tomatoes, melons and bananas give off the most ethylene 
and should be stored away from delicate fruits and vegetables, especially greens. Fruits 
that are picked and shipped unripened can be exposed to ethylene gas to induce ripen￾ing just before sale. Conversely, to extend the life of ripe fruits a day or two, isolate them 
from other fruits and keep them well chilled.
Fresh fruits will not ripen further once they are cooked or processed. The cooking or 
processing method applied, however, may soften the fruits or add flavor.
Purchasing
Fresh fruits are sold by weight or by count. They are packed in containers referred to as 
crates, bushels, cartons, cases, lugs or flats. The weight or count packed in each of these 
containers varies depending on the type of fruit, the purveyor and the state in which 
the fruits were packed. For instance, Texas citrus is packed in cartons equal to 7
10 of a 
bushel; Florida citrus is packed in cartons equal to 4 5 of a bushel. Sometimes fruit size 
must be specified when ordering. A 30-pound case of lemons, for example, may contain 
96, 112 or 144 individual lemons, depending on the size of the fruit. The higher the 
count number, the smaller each piece will be.
Some fresh fruits, especially melons, pineapples, peaches and berries, are available 
trimmed, cleaned, peeled or cut. Sugar and preservatives are sometimes added. They 
are sold in bulk containers, sometimes packed in water. These items offer a consistent 
product with a significant reduction in labor costs. However the purchase price may be 
greater than that of fresh fruits, and flavor, freshness and nutritional qualities may suffer 
somewhat from the processing.
Storing
Like vegetables, fruit must be stored in a way that ensures airflow at the proper tempera￾tures to prevent spoilage. Fresh fruit should be stored at 34–40°F (2–4°C) with relatively 
high levels of humidity. Citrus fruit, melons, papayas and pineapples benefit from slightly 
warmer storage temperatures of 40–50°F (4–10°C). Store bananas and unripe mangoes 
in a dry area with good ventilation at 56–60°F (13–15°C). Bananas will turn a grey color 
if refrigerated. Although unsuitable for eating out of hand, brown bananas may still be 
used in baked goods and smoothie drinks. Pay particular attention to the storage condi￾tions for ripe berries, which are especially perishable. They require good ventilation and 
cold conditions. If you purchase more than needed, immediately wash the berries, dry 
them and freeze them for use in baked goods, fillings and sauces.

PRESERVING FRUITS
Preservation techniques are designed to extend the shelf life of fruits. These methods 
include irradiation, acidulation, canning, freezing and drying. Except for drying, these 
techniques do not substantially change the fruits’ texture or flavor. Canning and freezing 
can also be used to preserve cooked fruits.
Fruit preserves, such as jellies and jams, are cooked products and are discussed later 
in this chapter.
Irradiation
As described in Chapter 22, Vegetables, some fruits can be subjected to ionizing radia￾tion to destroy parasites, insects and bacteria. The treatment also slows ripening without 
a noticeable effect on the fruits’ flavor and texture. Irradiated fruits must be labeled 
“treated with radiation,” “treated by irradiation” or with the symbol shown in Figure 25.1.
Acidulation
Apples, pears, bananas, peaches and other fruits turn brown when cut. Although this 
browning is commonly attributed to exposure to oxygen, it is actually caused by the 
reaction of enzymes. Enzymatic browning can be retarded by immersing cut fruits in an 
acidic solution such as lemon or orange juice. This simple technique is referred to as 
acidulation. Soaking fruits in water or lemon juice and water (called acidulated water) 
is not recommended. Unless a sufficient amount of salt or sugar is added to the water, 
the fruits become mushy and if enough salt or sugar is added to retain texture, the flavor 
is adversely affected.
Canning
Almost any type of fruit can be canned successfully; pineapple and peaches are espe￾cially popular types of canned fruit. In commercial canning, raw fruits are cleaned and 
placed in a sealed container, then subjected to high temperatures for a specific amount 
of time. Heating destroys the microorganisms that cause spoilage, and the sealed envi￾ronment created by the can eliminates oxidation and retards decomposition. But the heat 
required by the canning process also softens the texture of most fruits. Canning has little 
or no effect on vitamins A, B, C and D. Canning also has no practical effect on proteins, 
fats or carbohydrates.
In solid-pack cans, little or no water is added. The only liquid is from the fruits’ natu￾ral moisture. Water-pack cans have water or fruit juice added, which must be taken into 
account when determining costs. Syrup-pack cans have a sugar syrup—light, medium 
or heavy—added. The syrup should also be taken into account when determining food 
costs, and the additional sweetness should be considered when using syrup-packed 
fruits. Cooked fruit products such as pie fillings are also available canned.
Canned fruits are purchased in cases of standard-sized cans (see Appendix I, Canned 
Good Sizes). Once a can is opened, any unused contents should be transferred to an 
appropriate storage container and refrigerated. Cans with bulges should be discarded 
immediately, without opening.
Freezing
Freezing is a highly effective method for preserving fruits. It severely inhibits the growth of 
microorganisms that cause fruits to spoil. Freezing does not destroy nutrients, although the 
appearance or texture of most fruits can be affected because of their high water content. This 
occurs when ice crystals formed from the water in the cells cause the cells’ walls to burst.
Many fruits, especially berries and apple and pear slices, are now individually quick 
frozen (IQF). This method employs blasts of cold air, refrigerated plates, liquid nitrogen, 
liquid air or other techniques to chill the produce quickly. Speeding the freezing process 
greatly reduces the formation of ice crystals.

Savory Fruit
Fruits, whether fresh or preserved, impart 
a natural sweetness to savory or spicy 
dishes. turkey with cranberries, duck and 
orange sauce, roast pork with apples and 
curried lamb with mango chutney are a 
few examples of successful fruit and meat 
pairings. using fruit in savory dishes is 
nothing new. During the Middle Ages, 
Europeans often paired fruit with savory 
meat or vegetables to add the longed￾for taste of sugar, which was otherwise 
difficult and expensive to obtain.
throughout the world tangy, sweet 
fruit is used to contrast with the rich, 
fattiness of meats and poultry to create 
balance. Fruit and meat or poultry 
combinations are abundant in Asian 
and Middle Eastern cuisines, in which a 
variety of tastes are presented throughout 
the meal. Dates and dried fruits are 
common in the dishes of North Africa 
and the Middle East. tropical fruits such 
as mangos and bananas often appear in 
spicy indian and southeast Asian dishes 
and condiments. Fruit adds a complexity 
of aromas and flavors beyond mere 
sugary sweetness to savory dishes.

Dried pears
Dried apricots
Fruits can be trimmed and sliced before freezing and are also available frozen in sugar 
syrup, which adds flavor and prevents browning. Berries are frozen whole, whereas 
stone fruits are usually peeled, pitted and sliced. Fruit purées are also available frozen.
Frozen fruits are graded as U.S. Grade A (Fancy), U.S. Grade B (Choice or Extra 
Standard), or U.S. Grade C (Standard). The “U.S.” indicates that a government inspector 
has graded the product, but packers may use grade names without an actual inspection 
if the contents meet the standards of the grade indicated.
IQF fruits can be purchased in bulk by the case. All frozen fruits should be sealed in 
moisture-proof wrapping and kept at a constant temperature of 0°F (–18°C) or below. 
Temperature fluctuations can cause freezer burn. Frozen berries such as blueberries and 
blackberries should not be thawed before adding to batters because their juice can easily 
discolor the batter.
Drying
Drying is the oldest known technique for preserving fruits, having 
been used for more than 5000 years. When ripe fruits are dried, 
they lose most of their moisture. This concentrates their flavors 
and sugars and dramatically extends shelf life. Although most 
fruits can be dried, apricots, cranberries, figs, grapes (raisins, sul￾tanas and currants) and plums (prunes) are the most commonly 
dried fruits. The drying method can be as simple as leaving ripe 
fruits in the sun to dry naturally or the more cost-efficient technique of passing fruits 
through a compartment of hot, dry air to quickly extract moisture.
Conventional dried fruits actually retain from 16 to 26 percent residual moisture, which 
leaves them moist and soft. They are often treated with sulfur dioxide to prevent browning 
(oxidation) and to extend shelf life. Dried fruits may be eaten out of hand; added to cereals 
or salads; baked in muffins, breads, pies or tarts; stewed for chutneys or com￾potes; or used as a stuffing for roasted meats or poultry. Before use, dried 
fruits may be softened by steeping them for a short time in a hot liquid 
such as water, wine, rum, brandy or other liquor. Some dried fruits 
should be simmered in a small amount of water before use.
Freeze-drying is a commercial process used to remove moisture 
from fruits and vegetables. Sliced fruits (or vegetables) are frozen 
then put under vacuum pressure, which extracts up to 98% of the 
moisture. Freeze-dried fruits can be reconstituted in water; added dry 
to soups, stews and other liquids; or ground into a flavorful powder.
Store dried fruits in airtight containers to prevent further moisture loss; 
keep in a dry, cool area away from sunlight. Conventionally dried fruits may mold if exposed 
to both air and high humidity. Freeze-dried fruits may soften if exposed to high humidity.
JUICING FRUITS
Fruit juice is consumed as a beverage, alone or mixed with other ingredients. Fruit juice 
also serves as the liquid ingredient in other preparations. Juice can be extracted from 
fruits (and some vegetables) in two ways: pressure and blending.
Pressure is used to extract juice from fruits such as citrus that have a high water con￾tent. Pressure is applied by hand-squeezing or with a manual or electric reamer. All ream￾ers work on the same principle: A ribbed cone is pressed against the fruit to break down 
its flesh and release the juice. Always strain juices to remove seeds, pulp or fibrous pieces.
A blender or an electric juice extractor can liquefy less-juicy fruits and vegetables 
such as apples, carrots, tomatoes, beets and cabbage. The extractor pulverizes the fruit 
or vegetable, then separates and strains the liquid from the pulp with centrifugal force.
Interesting and delicious beverages can be made by combining the juices of one or 
more fruits or vegetables, such as pineapple with orange, apple with cranberry, straw￾berry with tangerine and papaya with orange. Color should be considered when creating 
juice the liquid extracted from any fruit or 
vegetable

mixed-juice beverages, however. Although yellow and orange juices are not a problem, 
those containing red and blue flavonoid pigments (such as Concord grapes, cherries, 
strawberries, raspberries and blueberries) can create unappetizing colors. Adding an acid 
such as lemon juice helps retain the correct red and blue hues.
COOKING METHODS FOR FRUITS
Although most fruits are edible raw and typically served that way, some fruits can also 
be cooked. Commonly used cooking methods are broiling and grilling, baking, sautéing, 
deep-frying, poaching, simmering and preserving.
When cooking fruits, proper care and attention are critical. Even minimal cooking 
can render fruits overly soft or mushy. To combat this irreversible process, sugar can 
be added. When fruits are cooked with sugar, the sugar is absorbed slowly into the 
cells, firming the fruits. Acids (notably lemon juice) also help fruits retain their structure. 
(Alkalis, such as baking soda, cause the cells to break down more quickly, reducing the 
fruits to mush.)
Determining Doneness
There are so many different fruits with such varied responses to cooking that no one stan￾dard for doneness is appropriate. Each item should be evaluated on a recipe-by-recipe basis. 
As a general rule, however, most cooked fruits are done when they are just tender when 
pierced with a fork or the tip of a paring knife. Simmered fruits, such as compotes, should 
be softer, cooked just to the point of disintegration. To avoid overcooking fruits, remember 
that some carryover cooking will occur through the residual heat contained in the foods. 
Always rely on subjective tests—sight, feel, taste and aroma—rather than the clock.
Dry-Heat Cooking Methods for Fruits
Using dry-heat cooking methods to prepare fruit concentrates their flavors by reducing 
moisture. Select the dry-heat cooking method suitable for the fruit being used. Small 
delicate fruits such as berries, for example, may not be suitable for grilling. although they 
can be sautéed to release their juices and extract flavor.
 Broiling and Grilling
Fruits are usually broiled or grilled just long enough to caramelize sugars; cooking must 
be done quickly to avoid breaking down the fruits’ structure. Good fruits to broil or grill 
are pineapples, apples, grapefruits, bananas, persimmons and peaches. The fruits may 
be cut into slices, chunks or halves as appropriate. Sugar, honey or liqueur add flavor, as 
do lemon juice, cinnamon and ginger.
When broiling fruits, use a sheet pan or broiling platter. When grilling fruits, place on 
a clean grill grate or thread the pieces onto skewers. Only thick fruit slices need to be 
turned or rotated to heat fully. Broiled or grilled fruits can be served alone; as an accom￾paniment to meat, fish or poultry; or as topping for ice creams or custards.
 Safety Alert
Fruit Sanitation
remove any labels and wash fruits 
thoroughly before using, even if they are 
to be peeled or juiced. Because fruits 
are often served uncooked, proper 
hand-washing is especially important 
when preparing them. remember that 
some health departments require single￾use gloves to be worn—and changed 
frequently—whenever working with 
products that are not cooked before 
service.
Procedure for Broiling or Grilling Fruits
1 select ripe fruits and peel, core or slice as necessary. Cut fruit into pieces that are large 
enough so that they do not fall through the grill grate or arrange pieces on skewers for grilling.
2 top with sugar or honey to add flavor and aid caramelization.
3 Place the fruits in a heatproof serving dish or on a broiler platter, sheet pan or grill grate.
4 Broil or grill at high temperatures, turning as necessary to heat the fruits thoroughly 
but quickly.

Baking
After washing, peeling, coring or pitting, most pomes, stone fruits and tropicals can be baked. 
Baked fruits are hot, flavorful desserts. Fruits with sturdy skins (peels), particularly apples and 
pears, are excellent for baking alone, as their skins hold in moisture and flavor. To use them 
as edible containers, fill the cavity left by coring with a variety of sweet or savory mixtures.
Combinations of fruits can also be baked successfully; try mixing fruits for a balance 
of sweetness and tartness (e.g., strawberries with rhubarb or apples with plums).
Several baked desserts are simply fruits (fresh, frozen or canned) topped with a crust 
or biscuit dough (cobbler), streusel (crumple or crisp) or batter (buckle). Fruits, some￾times poached first, can also be baked in a wrapper of puff pastry, flaky dough or phyllo 
dough to produce an elegant dessert.

Sautéing
Fruits develop a rich, syrupy flavor when sautéed briefly in butter, sugar and, if desired, 
spices or liqueur. Cherries, bananas, apples, pears and pineapples are good choices. 
Peel, core and seed as necessary and cut into uniform-size pieces before sautéing.
For dessert, sauté fruits with sugar to create a caramelized glaze or syrup. The fruits 
and syrup can be used to fill crêpes or top spongecakes or ice creams. Liquor may be 
added and the mixture flamed (flambéed) in front of diners. For savory mixtures, onions, 
shallots or garlic are often added.
In both sweet and savory fruit sautés, the fat used should be the most appropriate for 
the finished product. Butter and bacon fat (for savory dishes) are typical choices.
 Procedure for Sautéing Fruits
1 Peel, pit and core the fruits as necessary and cut into uniform-sized pieces.
2 Melt the fat in a hot sauté pan.
3 Add the fruit pieces and any flavoring ingredients. Do not crowd the pan, as this will cause 
the fruit to stew in its own juices.

Deep-Frying
Only a few fruits are suitable for deep-frying. Apples, bananas, pears, pineapples and 
firm peaches mixed in or coated with batter produce fine results. These fruits should be 
peeled, cored, seeded and cut into evenly sized slices or chunks. They may also need to 
be dried with paper towels so that the batter or coating can adhere.
Fruit fritters are also popular snacks or dessert items. Fritters contain diced or 
chopped fish, shellfish, vegetables or fruits bound together with a thick batter and 
 deep-fried. Because frying time is very short, the main ingredient may be precooked. 
Fritters are spooned or dropped directly into the hot fat; they form a crust as they cook. 
Popular examples are banana fritters and apple fritters.

Moist-Heat Cooking Methods for Fruits
Moist heat cooking methods are used to soften, tenderize and flavor fruits by submerging 
them directly into a hot liquid. Whether poaching a whole fruit such as a peeled pear 
or simmering a mixture of cut fruit for a compote, the liquid used should enhance the 
flavor of the fruit.
Poaching
A popular cooking method for preparing fruits is poaching. Poaching softens and tender￾izes fruits and infuses them with additional flavors such as spices or wine. Poached fruits 
can be served hot or cold and used in tarts or pastries or as an accompaniment to meat 
or poultry dishes.
The poaching liquid can be water, wine, liquor or sugar syrup. (As noted earlier, 
sugar helps fruits keep their shape, although it takes longer to tenderize fruits poached 
in sugar syrup.) The low poaching temperature (185°F/85°C) allows fruits to soften grad￾ually. The agitation created at higher temperatures would damage them.
Cooked fruits should be allowed to cool in the flavored poaching liquid or syrup. 
Most poaching liquids can be used repeatedly. If they contain sufficient sugar, they can 
be reduced to a sauce or glaze to accompany the poached fruits.
Procedure for Poaching Fruits
1 Peel, core and slice the fruits as necessary.
2 in a sufficiently deep, nonreactive saucepan, combine the poaching liquid (usually water or 
wine) with sugar, spices, citrus zest and other ingredients as desired or as directed in the recipe.
3 submerge the fruits in the liquid. Place a circle of parchment paper over the fruits to help 
them stay submerged.
4 Place the saucepan on the stove top over a medium-high flame; bring to a boil.
5 As soon as the liquid boils, reduce the temperature. simmer gently.
6 Poach until the fruits are tender enough for the tip of a small knife to be easily inserted. 
Cooking time depends on the type and variety of fruit used, its ripeness and the cooking liquid.
7 remove the saucepan from the stove top and allow the liquid and fruits to cool.
8 remove the fruits from the liquid and then refrigerate. the liquid can be returned to the stove 
top and reduced until thick enough to use as a sauce or glaze or refrigerated for further use.

Making Fruit Preserves
Fresh fruits can be preserved with sugar if the fruit-and-sugar mixture is concentrated 
by evaporation to the point that microbial spoilage cannot occur. The added sugar also 
slows the growth of, but does not destroy, microorganisms.
Pectin, a substance present in varying amounts in all fruits, can cause cooked fruits to 
form a semisolid mass known as a gel. Fruits that are visually unattractive but otherwise 
of high quality can be made into gels, which are more commonly known as jams, jellies, 
marmalades and preserves.
concentrate also known as a fruit paste or 
compound; a reduced fruit purée, without a gel 
structure, used as a flavoring
jam a fruit gel made from fruit pulp and sugar
jelly a fruit gel made from fruit juice and sugar
marmalade a citrus jelly that also contains 
unpeeled slices of citrus fruit
preserve a fruit gel that contains large pieces or 
whole fruits
Apple jelly Apricot jam Orange marmalade
The essential ingredients of a fruit gel are fruit, pectin, acid (usually lemon juice) 
and sugar. These ingredients must be carefully combined in the correct ratio for the gel 
to form. For fruits with a low pectin content (such as strawberries) to form a gel, pec￾tin must be added, either by adding a fruit with a high pectin content (e.g., apples or 
quinces) or by adding packaged pectin.
Fruit and sugar must be cooked long enough and to the proper temperature for 
sugar to form a gel that bonds with pectin and natural acid in the fruit and lemon juice, 
which is often added. The set point or temperature at which the sugar gel forms is 
220°F (104°C). At this temperature the pectin and fruit create a natural bond creating a 
thick, spreadable mixture. Preserves can burn if cooked too long, however, so use an 
instant-read or candy thermometer to verify the temperature. A wide, heavy pan is rec￾ommended to increase the surface area and speed evaporation. As the mixture begins to 
thicken, it will simmer vigorously. In the absence of a thermometer, the plate test can be 
used to gauge the preserves’ consistency. Spoon a small amount on a cold plate and run 
a spoon through the mixture; it will hold its shape as it reaches set point.
To ensure an accurate temperature reading when making preserves, calibrate the 
thermometer before use. Be sure to submerge the tip of the thermometer to the 
proper depth.
Procedure for Making Fruit Preserves
1 Peel, core, pit and slice the fruits as necessary.
2 Combine fruit and sugar.
3 Bring the mixture to a vigorous boil and cook for several minutes to release pectin from the

1 rinse the berries in cold water and drain well. 
2 Place the berries in a wide nonreactive saucepan. Add the sugar and heat on medium-high, mash￾ing the berries to extract juice. stir frequently until all the sugar has dissolved. Bring to a rolling boil 
and boil for 2 minutes. 
3 reduce the heat to a strong simmer. skim foam from the surface as necessary. 
4 stir in the lemon juice and zest. Continue cooking, stirring frequently, until the mixture is syrupy 
and thick. it should register 220°F (104°C) on a candy thermometer. the cooled mixture should 
hold its shape when a spoon is run through it. Cooking may take 20–35 minutes depending on the 
amount of water in the fruit and the rate of evaporation. 
5 Pack the hot preserves into lidded containers. Cool at room temperature, then refrigerate for up 
to 3 weeks. 
Note if fruit is frozen, combine it with the sugar in a non-reactive pan and set aside at room tem￾perature until the fruit is thawed and soft. this helps break down the berry skins.

 Safety Alert
Cooking with Alcohol
When alcohol comes into contact with 
a flame, it can ignite. to avoid singed 
eyebrows and kitchen fires, observe care 
when adding wine, liqueurs or liquor to a 
dish near the stove. When a dish calls for 
flambéing, follow these procedures: stand 
away from the pan being flamed. tilt the 
pan away from you, allowing the fumes to 
be ignited by the open flame. Be careful, 
as the flames can leap from the pan.

 Many restaurant guests seek to incorporate more plant-based foods into their 
diets. some are motivated by specific health or environmental concerns. 
others, looking for ways to promote better health through food, might skip 
eating meat occasionally. and others may have religious beliefs or other personal reasons to 
avoid eating animal products. Whatever the reason, today’s chef must learn ways to properly 
prepare appealing plant-based foods and to incorporate them into their menus. 
 this chapter discusses plant-based eating patterns in detail, including vegetarian and 
vegan diets. Building on the information in Chapter 3 , nutrition and Healthy Cooking, this 
 chapter offers a framework for understanding ingredient substitutions and alternatives for 
those following plant-based eating patterns. guidelines for chefs seeking to incorporate 
plant-based dishes into their menus are included, along with procedures for preparing dishes 
suitable for vegan and vegetarian diets. a selection of healthy, plant-based recipes concludes 
this chapter. 
 PLANT-BASED EATING 
 Approximately 16 million people in the United States are choosing to forgo some or 
all animal products in their diets. According to a 2018 Gallup Poll of adults, 4 percent 
of men and 6 percent of women follow a vegetarian or vegan diet. The highest per￾centages of survey respondents identifying as vegetarian or vegan are in eastern states. 
Respondents who identify as vegetarian or vegan are highest in the 18–34 age group. 
About half of vegetarians identify as vegan. 
 The Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2020–2025, as well as recommendations 
from major health groups (including the American Cancer Society, the American 
Heart Association, and the American Dietetic Association), stress the importance of 
eating fruits, vegetables, legumes and whole grains, which are the foundation of a 
plant-based diet. Studies have shown that the incidence of chronic diseases such 
as obesity, cardiovascular disease, cancer and type 2 diabetes are lower for veg￾etarians than for nonvegetarians. It is important to note that other healthy lifestyle 
factors (including not smoking, regular exercise and moderate use or abstinence 
from alcohol), which some vegetarians follow may also be responsible for the 
lower disease rates. 
 The vegetarian diet has many variations. A person who follows a vegetarian diet can 
be any (or a combination) of the following: 
▪ Flexitarian: A vegan who may occasionally eat animal products including fish, 
meat and poultry. 
▪ Fructarian or fruitarian: A person who eats only fruits, nuts, seeds and other 
plant products that can be gathered without harming the plant. Some fructarians 
eat only plant matter that has already fallen off the plant. 
▪ Lacto-vegetarian: A vegetarian who eats dairy products but not eggs. 
▪ Ovo-lacto-vegetarian or lacto-ovo-vegetarian: A person who eats only plant 
products, but will also consume dairy products and eggs (although some may 
not eat cheeses made with animal-based enzymes such as rennet, or eggs 
produced by factory farms). This diet is one of the most typical vegetarian diets, 
and the terms ovo-lacto-vegetarian and lacto-ovo-vegetarian are often used 
interchangeably with the term vegetarian . 
▪ Ovo-vegetarian: A vegetarian who eats eggs but not dairy products. 
▪ Raw foodist: Typically a vegan who eats only raw or slightly warmed plant 
products (adherents believe that cooking foods to a temperature of 116°F/47°C 
 a colorful grain salad made with farro, white 
beans and cucumber seasoned with a warm 
spice dressing. 
M26_LABE1163_07_SE_C26.indd 818 31/10/23 8:57 PMPlant-Based Cooking 819
or higher destroys enzymes and nutrients). A person on a raw food diet, also 
referred to as a living foodist, may soak certain foods such as nuts and sprouts 
to soften them and increase nutrient absorption.
	▪ Vegan [VEE-gun]: A person who eats no meat, fish or poultry or any products 
derived from animals such as milk, cheese, eggs, honey or gelatin; also referred 
to as a strict or pure vegetarian.
People following a vegetarian or vegan eating pattern must consume the same types 
of nutrients, in the same quantities, as other healthy humans, adjusting for age, sex and 
any illness or physical condition. Legumes, whole grains, nuts, seeds and certain veg￾etables provide protein in vegetarian and vegan eating patterns. Research shows that 
a well-balanced vegetarian or vegan diet supplies adequate amounts of protein and 
contains less saturated fat and cholesterol than diets including meats and other animal 
products. Vegetarian diets likely include more than the minimum daily recommendation 
for five servings of fruits and vegetables and more fiber, folic acid, antioxidants, vitamins 
and minerals than other diets. Note that a lack of balanced food sources or a reliance 
on processed foods, especially those high in sodium or sugar, is unhealthful even if the 
overall diet is vegetarian or vegan.
INGREDIENTS FOR PLANT-BASED COOKING
Flavorful, visually stimulating plant-based dishes can be prepared with the traditional 
range of ingredients available in most restaurant kitchens. Potatoes, grains, starches, veg￾etables and fruits form the foundation of vegetarian and vegan cooking. (See Chapter 22, 
Vegetables; Chapter 23, Potatoes, Grains and Pasta; Chapter 24, Salads and Salad 
Dressings; and Chapter 25, Fruits.) To help chefs in planning vegetarian and vegan 
dishes, Table 26.1 lists common ingredients and substitutes that are free of dairy, fish, 
meat and poultry products.
Some foods that replace the protein found in animal products as well as other ingre￾dients that may mimic more traditional animal-based foods are discussed in the material 
that follows.
Soybean-Based Ingredients
The versatile and protein-rich soybean forms the basis for a wide range of products 
used in vegetarian, vegan and traditional cuisines worldwide. Soy-based foods are one 
of the most important sources of protein in the vegetarian diet and have been favor￾ites in Asian cuisines for centuries. Although brown, black and green varieties exist, 
most commercially grown soybeans are yellow. According to the United Soybean 
Board, soy protein is the only plant protein that is equivalent to animal protein; it is 
a rich source of phytochemicals, making soy an ideal ingredient for vegetarian and 
vegan cooking. Soybeans can be made into a diverse range of foods, including flour, 
milk, cheese and oil.
Edamame is the Japanese name for fresh immature soybeans that are steamed or 
blanched in their inedible pods. High in protein and fiber but low in fat, with a crisp 
texture and rich vegetal umami flavor, edamame is a popular snack food and addition 
to salads.
Soy milk is made from dried soybeans that are soaked and then finely ground and 
pressed to extract a milky liquid. Soy milk comes in liquid or powdered form. Like other 
analog milk products (see page 182), liquid soy milk resembles skim milk and has a 
slightly nutty flavor. Most liquid soy milk is sold in aseptic packaging and has a one-year 
shelf life if unopened. Like dairy milk, once opened, liquid soy milk requires refrigera￾tion and lasts approximately 5–7 days. Powdered soy milk is shelf-stable and lasts for a 
year at room temperature. Soy cheese, soy yogurt and flavored soy beverages are dairy 
substitutes made from soy milk. Fresh edamame
M26_LABE1163_07_SE_C26.indd 819 31/10/23 8:57 PM820 CHaPteR tWentY-siX
Use soy milk measure for measure in any recipe that calls for dairy milk. Manufacturing 
technologies have evolved to produce soy milk products with a richer texture and flavor, 
more suitable for enriching sauces. However at high temperatures soy milk can separate 
and brown; simmer foods with soy milk gently and add the soy milk near the end of the 
cooking time to prevent it from separating and scorching.
Tofu or bean curd (Fr. fromage de soja) is a staple of Japanese and Chinese cuisines 
that is appreciated internationally for its high nutritional value, low cost and flavor adapt￾ability. Tofu is made by processing soybeans into soy milk that is coagulated and formed 
into a cake. The result is a soft, creamy-white substance similar to cheese. Tofu is easy to 
digest and is a good source of protein, low in fat and sodium with no cholesterol.
Tofu may be eaten fresh; added to soup, broth or noodle dishes; tossed in cold salads; 
grilled, deep-fried or sautéed; or puréed to make a creamy spread. Its flavor is bland, but 
it readily absorbs flavors from other ingredients. Two types of tofu are widely available: 
cotton (or traditional) and silken.
Cotton tofu is the most common type of tofu in the United States. It is solid, with 
an irregular surface caused by the weave of the cotton fabric in which it is wrapped for 
pressing. This traditional tofu comes in three styles—soft, firm and extra firm—each style 
being progressively drier and firmer. Select the style of tofu suited to the preparation. 
Firmer tofu is solid enough to be grilled or sautéed. It absorbs the flavors of rubs and 
marinades. Softer tofu may be scrambled like eggs or processed to form a smooth spread.
Silken tofu (Ja. kinugoshi) has a silky-smooth appearance and texture and a somewhat 
more delicate flavor than cotton tofu. Silken tofu is made in a process that is similar to the 
silken tofu

 Safety Alert
Fresh Tofu
Fresh unpasteurized tofu packed in 
water requires time and temperature 
control for safety (tCs). exercise 
care when handling this product; use 
clean sanitized equipment and avoid 
cross-contamination when handling 
unpasteurized tofu. store it below 41°F 
(5°C). When fresh unpasteurized tofu 
packed in water is served to at-risk 
populations, it should be precooked 
and held at 165°F (74°C) for 3 minutes 
before using.

way yogurt is cultured. No curds are formed, nor is whey produced. This makes a tofu 
with a custard-like texture suitable for use as a base for dips or in spreads or smoothies. 
Because the water has not been pressed out of silken tofu, it should not be cooked at high 
temperatures or for a long time, as it falls apart easily. Silken tofu can also be drained to 
make a thicker spread with a consistency resembling that of mascarpone or cream cheese.
Fresh tofu is usually packaged in water. It should be refrigerated and kept in water 
until used. If the water is drained and changed daily, the tofu should last for 1 week. 
Tofu can be frozen for several months, though its texture will be drier after thawing. 
Weight down frozen tofu while it is thawing to create a denser, firmer product, suitable 
for grilling.
Miso [MEE-so] is a thick paste made by salting and fermenting 
soybeans with rice or barley. After soaking, the soybeans are 
steamed, then crushed. The mixture is blended with water. Rice 
or barley is added along with salt before the mixture is inocu￾lated with a living culture (either koji or Aspergillus mold). 
After fermenting and aging, the paste is ready to use. In Japan, 
where the manufacture of miso is a fine art akin to cheese 
making, there are countless styles of miso ranging in color 
from pale to rust and in taste from sweet to salty. In the United 
States two types of miso are commonly available: white (sweet) 
miso and red (dark) miso. Creamy-colored white miso contains a high 
percentage of rice and has a mild, somewhat sweet flavor. Red or dark miso, which con￾tains a higher percentage of soybeans, is aged longer and has a stronger, saltier flavor.
Miso can be used in cold and warm preparations but should never be boiled; it 
contains beneficial enzymes and bacteria that can be killed at high temperatures. 
Miso can be used to enhance the flavor in sauces, soups, stews and marinades, 
where it will impart a rich full-bodied flavor to vegetarian and vegan foods. White 
miso is now showing up more frequently in baked products such as breads, cookies 
and cakes, where it replaces salt, adding complex umami flavors and providing a 
contrast to sugary sweetness. A pungent seasoning, miso should be used judiciously 
so as not to overpower a dish. As little as 1 teaspoon (5 milliliters) per portion can 
be adequate to flavor a simple broth. Due to its high salt content, miso will keep 
indefinitely under refrigeration.
Tempeh [TEHM-pay] is a type of bean cake made from fermented whole soybeans 
mixed with a grain such as rice or millet. The mixture is inoculated with Rhizopus mold, 
which binds the grains into a firm cake. A traditional food of Indonesia, tempeh has a 
chewy consistency and a yeasty, nutty flavor.
With its chunky texture, tempeh makes a pleasant meat substitute. It can be mari￾nated for grilling or sautéing. When crumbled, tempeh can be added to soups or stews 
to replace ground beef, poultry or pork. A firm cake, tempeh is easily sliced or cut into 
cubes. Because of the type of live culture used to make it, tempeh should be cooked 
before eating. Proper cooking also tempers its pronounced flavor. Tempeh is sold both 
fresh and frozen. It lasts for approximately 1 week in the refrigerator or several months 
when frozen.
Textured vegetable protein (TVP), also known as tex￾tured soy protein (TSP), is made from soy flour and other 
dehydrated proteins that are compressed into granules 
or chunks or extruded into shapes. Food manufacturers 
use it as a meat extender and in commercially produced 
meat replacements. Granulated textured vegetable pro￾tein must be rehydrated before cooking, which causes 
it to take on a texture like that of meat and makes it 
easy to use as a substitute for ground beef or pork. Larger 
forms of TVP benefit from simmering after rehydration. 
Adding some vinegar or lemon juice to the simmering liquid helps 
speed rehydration. A shelf-stable dry product, TVP can be stored for up to a year when 
tightly sealed at room temperature. Once it has been rehydrated, it must be refrigerated 
and should be used within a few days.

Other Popular Ingredients in Plant-Based Cooking
Vegetarian and vegan diets can lack the umami-rich flavors found in meats and cheese. 
Marine vegetables such as kombu, a type of seaweed, provide natural salinity and 
glutamic acid, the main compound providing the umami taste. Liquid amino acids, a 
product made from soybeans and water, acts as a flavor enhancer and is a good sub￾stitute for soy sauce. A powdered form of deactivated yeast called nutritional yeast is 
another popular ingredient in vegetarian and vegan diets for the nutty, creamy flavor 
it provides. When sprinkled into or on top of dishes, nutritional yeast adds a cheese￾like flavor.
Seitan [SAY-tan], often referred to as “wheat meat,” is a form of wheat gluten, the 
insoluble protein in wheat. A staple in the diets of Buddhist monks for centuries, seitan 
has a firm, chewy texture and a bland flavor. Seitan is made by preparing a dough from 
wheat gluten or wheat flour and water. The dough is repeatedly rinsed to remove any 
remaining starch or bran. The spongy pieces of seitan are then simmered in a broth of 
soy sauce or tamari with ginger, garlic and kombu (seaweed). Cooking tenderizes seitan 
and imbues it with the flavors of the cooking liquid. Because it is made from wheat, sei￾tan is not suitable for those following a gluten-free diet.
Because it absorbs flavors readily, seitan can be flavored to mimic many foods. Using 
seasonings associated with poultry such as thyme and sage brings out a chicken-like 
flavor in the seitan, whereas using dark soy sauce and meaty mushrooms can give it a 
meaty flavor. Fully cooked fresh seitan is sold refrigerated in irregularly sized chunks. 
Seitan should be added to a dish near the end of cooking, as it is already fully cooked. 
Once opened, it should be consumed within a few days. Powdered seitan mix, which 
can be used to make seitan dough, is also available.
Jackfruit are enormous tropical fruits grown throughout India and southeast Asia. 
A thick crenelated rind contains their stringy pale-yellow flesh that weighs between 10 
and 40 pounds making them the largest tree fruit in the world. Young green jackfruit 
have a mild flavor and firm shreadable texture. Mature jackfruit are sweeter with tropical 
flavors. High in fiber, vitamin C, potassium, calcium and iron, jackfruit is sold fresh or 
peeled, cut and canned. The neutral flavor and stringy texture of unripe, green jackfruit 
makes it a good meat substitute in vegan dishes such as barbecue, curry or stews. Select 
products labelled “unripe” or “packed in brine” for savory preparations.
Analog Foods
Numerous products made from soy, wheat, grains or other plant materials are designed 
to mimic the appearance and texture of popular animal-based products. Analog milk 
products that resemble dairy cream and milk, discussed in Chapter 8, Dairy Products, 
can be used in place of stock or liquid dairy products, for example. These ingredients 
tend to be lower in fat but higher in carbohydrates than their dairy counterparts—and 
they are cholesterol-free. (See Cashew Cream, page 827.)
Other processed analog food products are designed to mimic fish, meat or poultry. 
They offer a texture and appearance like that of their animal-protein-based counterparts. 
Although their flavors are less successful in imitating the actual flavor of their fish, meat 
or poultry counterparts, they are improving. Many offer vegetarian and vegan consumers 
the pleasure of eating familiar foods in traditional dishes. Plant-based products are avail￾able in the form of “nuggets,” “burgers,” “sausage,” “hot dogs,” “ground meat,” “bacon,” 
“strips,” “cold cuts” and even “pastrami.” Soy protein extract and judicious use of appro￾priate seasonings, such as sage in a breakfast sausage analog, mimic the flavor of their 
meat counterparts.
In most cases analog food products may be prepared in the same way as their 
meat, poultry or fish counterparts. Steaming, sautéing, simmering, grilling and bak￾ing work well. Follow the manufacturer’s directions, keeping in mind that these 
products are usually fully cooked, requiring only crisping or heating, and may suffer 
if overcooked.

PRINCIPLES OF PLANT-BASED COOKING
The principles of plant-based cooking are no different from those of the classic kitchen. 
When creating an appetizing and satisfying vegetarian or vegan dish, chefs use the same 
professional judgment as when preparing a roast or steak. Flavors must be in balance. 
Ingredients must be thoughtfully selected and skillfully prepared. Only the ingredients 
themselves vary. Apply the basic principles of cooking and work with the textures and 
flavors offered by plant-based ingredients.
Chefs also need to understand the unique role played by animal products in specific 
recipes when adapting dishes for a vegetarian or vegan diner. As discussed in Chapter 13, 
Principles of Meat Cookery, the muscle fibers in different cuts of meat, poultry and game 
yield foods with a chewy texture not easily mimicked by vegetable or soy or analog 
food products.
Well-marbled meat has fat throughout. When cooked, this fat melts, adding tender￾ness and flavor to the finished dish. It may be necessary to add fat to enhance flavor and 
add moisture to dishes cooked without meats. Replacing animal protein in a main dish 
with an equal amount of tofu, texturized soy protein, grain, bean purée or plant food 
may not result in a dish with the same appearance and depth of flavor as the original 
made with meat. Appropriate use of seasonings enhances the appeal of vegetarian and 
vegan dishes. Flavors of traditional foods such as barbecue, chili or curry can be applied 
to vegetarian dishes.
Chefs must carefully choose the ingredients they use in vegetarian and vegan dishes. 
Vegetables should be chosen for their flavor and texture. The mouthfeel each ingredient 
contributes to a finished dish should also be considered. Ripe avocados, for example, 
have a rich, creamy texture that can mimic the mouthfeel of a soft cream cheese. 
Replacing some fat with coconut oil can also contribute to a rich mouthfeel.
Without the base flavor notes created by rich meat, poultry or fish stocks, dishes pre￾pared with vegetarian and vegan stock can lack depth of flavor. Other ingredients can 
enhance flavors in plant-based dishes such as the following:
	▪ Varieties of fresh and dried mushrooms help enrich stocks, soups and stews.
	▪ Dried seaweed such as kombu (sea kelp) adds a briny flavor, mimicking 
seafood stock.
	▪ Soy sauce, miso and nutritional yeast can give vegetable broth a savory taste and 
appealing dark color, as can wine reductions.
	▪ Richly flavored nut oils, such as sesame, hazelnut and walnut oil, can add 
complex flavors to dishes prepared without rich meat stocks or butter.
	▪ Olives and dried fruits have intense flavors and pleasing textures that can add 
variety to a vegetarian dish.
	▪ Toasted sesame and other seeds and nuts add bursts of flavor and a textural 
contrast to a dish.
Baking without eggs poses several challenges because of the many functions eggs 
perform in baked goods. Liquid vegan egg replacements that mimic the binding, leaven￾ing and moistening qualities of eggs are available. Applesauce, chia or flaxseeds, bananas 
or silken tofu can be used in place of eggs in many cookie and quickbread formulas.
Suggestions for Preparing Plant-Based Dishes
With these considerations in mind, the following are some suggestions on how to plan 
and prepare to add plant-based dishes to a restaurant menu:
	▪ Use or adapt items from the regular menu. Many items on existing menus may 
be vegetarian or vegan or can easily be adapted for a vegetarian or vegan diner. 
Soups, salads, stir-fried vegetables and pasta dishes lend themselves to vegetarian 
and vegan ingredients.
this classic wedge salad features iceberg let￾tuce dressed with herb buttermilk-style dressing 
made with cashew cream. it is garnished with 
diced ripe tomatoes and tiny flatbread crisps 
spiced with smoked paprika to mimic the taste 
and texture of bacon.
M26_LABE1163_07_SE_C26.indd 823 31/10/23 8:57 PM824 CHaPteR tWentY-siX
	▪ Seek inspiration from cuisines in which vegetarian food is traditional. Asian, 
Ethiopian, Indian, Mexican, Middle Eastern and South American cuisines offer 
many exciting vegetarian and vegan options. Cuisines influenced by religions that 
prohibit meat eating, such as Buddhism, Hinduism and Jainism, are rich sources 
of inspiration.
	▪ Include starches that add texture and a feeling of fullness. Versatile starches 
such as grains and beans offer textural appeal that can be lacking in vegetable￾based dishes. Chewy grains such as cooked bulgur, barley and millet provide 
carbohydrates and fiber that also create a feeling of fullness and satiety. Ensuring 
that a customer feels sufficiently fed is another consideration, something that a 
plate of steamed vegetables may not provide.
	▪ Feature meaty vegetables and soy products in a vegetarian dish. Eggplant, 
mushrooms (especially portabellas), okra, sweet potatoes and parsnips have 
flavor and body that mimics that of meat. Pan-fried breaded eggplant slices or 
grilled whole portabella mushroom caps offer hearty vegetable alternatives to a 
slice of chicken or beef.
	▪ Compose dishes with an eye to balancing color. We eat with our eyes as well as 
our taste buds. When combining grains and beans on a plate, consider using 
different colors, such as black beans and red rice or yellow lentils and black￾eyed peas.
	▪ Balance textures on the same plate. As when planning any plate composition, 
include complementary and contrasting textures. When serving a creamy 
purée, such as mashed sweet potatoes, balance that texture with something 
crunchy or crisp, such as fried zucchini or a risotto cake. A crisp garnish such 
as toasted nuts, crumbled nori or oven-dried onions adds texture and a burst 
of flavor.
	▪ Layer flavors for complexity of taste. A dish prepared with few ingredients need 
not be bland or boring. Combine cooking methods in one dish to enhance flavor 
and complexity. Sun-dried tomatoes blended into a fresh tomato sauce add a 
richness that might otherwise be lacking. Brown vegetables to develop rich 
caramelized flavor notes. Capture smoky flavors through charring and grilling. 
Fermented flavors from vegan kimchi or pickles add complexity and enhance 
umami notes.
Modifying a Recipe for Vegetarian and Vegan Diets
A chef can use various approaches to modify an existing recipe for a vegetarian prep￾aration. Techniques used to prepare chicken, fish or meat can also be applied to 
 plant-derived ingredients. Consider vegetables that are locally grown or in season. Look 
for flavors and cooking methods to best highlight them, such as a pot pie made with 
spring vegetables. An international flavor profile might inspire a vegetable-focused ver￾sion of the same dish, such as Couscous with Seven Vegetables (page 832), which is 
inspired by a Moroccan dish typically made with lamb.
Often classic meat or seafood dishes can inspire a plant-based version. In the recipe 
for Vegan Stroganoff, which follows, we use the Beef Stroganoff recipe on page 376 as 
a starting point to create a satisfying vegan entrée. This recipe illustrates the Procedure 
for Modifying a Recipe for Vegetarian and Vegan Diets below. Recipe modifications are 
listed in red type in the margin and highlighted in the list of ingredients. Review Table 3.5 
on page 55, which compares the nutritional profile of the three versions of this recipe. 
(The recipe for Mushroom Bolognese on page 830 also includes recipe modifications to a 
meat-based version of this sauce.)
Miso-glazed eggplant is the focal point in this 
Japanese-inspired dish paired with creamy 
coconut rice and sautéed baby bok choy.
a hearty plant-based meal centers around a crisp 
pan-fried vegan rösti potato cake served with 
a bean and vegetable ragout. Using a variety of 
dried beans creates visual appeal and adds tex￾tural contrast. the garnish of sautéed mushrooms 
adds meaty textures and rich umami flavors.
the vibrant colors and contrasting textures in 
this composition of grilled and raw vegetables 
attract the eye and stimulate the palate.

Procedure for Modifying a Recipe for Vegetarian and Vegan Diets
1 Review the original recipe and note all the ingredients that might not be acceptable for 
vegetarian or vegan diners. Remember that dairy and eggs are animal products. keep 
in mind that many vegans also avoid honey. Be mindful of products that might contain 
animal ingredients, such as gelatin, fish sauce and Worcestershire sauce, which is made 
with fish.
2 Consider what role each of those ingredients plays in the finished dish’s texture, flavor 
and appearance.
3 decide which ingredients can be used as alternatives to the noted ingredients in a modified 
recipe. Consider satiety or fullness and diners’ satisfaction and ensure that the plate offers 
a balance of carbohydrates, proteins, vegetables and fats. When selecting the vegetables, 
grains and starches, keep your diners’ protein needs in mind.
4 Consider the cooking techniques that will be needed for all ingredients on the plate.
5 ensure the dish is plated and garnished appropriately and with attention to eye appeal. Pay 
attention to contrasting textures and colors.

 PLANT-FORWARD COOKING 
 Many people celebrate plant-based cooking but also occasionally eat animal products. 
They may enjoy vegetarian dishes with small amounts of fish or meat added, such as 
bits of shredded chicken in an otherwise vegetarian soup. Such guests may prefer strictly 
vegan dishes but occasionally eat a meat dish. Chefs need to consider these guests when 
creating menus. 
 Some things to consider when creating plant-forward menus include the following: 
▪ Include vegan appetizers, salads, entrées, side dishes and desserts on every menu. 
▪ Rethink the center of the plate options as discussed on page 51 . Reduce the 
portion sizes of chicken, fish or meat. Supplement with more vegetable, grain and 
starch garnishes. 
▪ Create menu items based on seasonal fruits and vegetables, adding meat as a 
condiment. 
▪ Offer chicken, fish or meat as an optional add-on to plant-based items. For 
example, grilled chicken or shrimp can be offered with a Caesar salad for an 
additional charge. 
 The recipes at the end of this chapter are suitable for most vegetarian diets as they do 
not include animal proteins or eggs. Many are suitable for vegan diets. Vegetarian reci￾pes appear throughout this book, indicated with the symbol shown in Figure 26. 1 . These 
recipes do not contain any meat, fish, shellfish or poultry but may contain dairy products 
and/or eggs. Vegetarian dishes are not necessarily low in calories, fat or sodium, nor 
are they automatically good sources of vitamins, protein, fiber or calcium, as defined by 
government standards. Vegan recipes appear throughout this book, indicated with the 
symbol shown in Figure 26. 2 .

Chia Bumbleberry Preserves Vegan
Bumbleberries aren’t found in any grocery or market. The word is simply the Canadian term for a 
mixture of three or more berries used in pies, preserves or other sweets. Here, high fiber chia seeds
are used to thicken the fruit into a spreadable paste, so the large amount of sugar normally required in 
jams and preserves is no longer necessary. Chia seeds will still be visible in the final product but will lose 
their crunchiness by absorbing liquid.

 After studying this chapter, 
you will be able to: 
27. 1 identify and describe key 
sandwich ingredients 
27. 2 prepare a variety of hot and 
cold sandwiches 
27. 3 prepare mise en place for assembling 
sandwiches made to order 
27. 4 present and garnish sandwiches 
 A sandwich is often the first dish a person learns to prepare. even those who claim 
that they cannot cook often make delicious hot and cold sandwiches without con￾sidering it cooking. Mastering a grilled cheese or assembling the quintessential 
BLT may not require a degree in the culinary arts, but it does require the ability to select and 
use ingredients wisely. 
 Sandwiches, which are usually quick and easy to assemble, lend themselves well to a chef ’s 
creativity. imaginative sandwiches can become sensational menu additions in even the most 
formal restaurants, and amazing sandwiches can keep lunch customers visiting regularly. 
They may be the focal point of a menu, or a smaller part of the pantry cook’s responsibilities. 
Sandwiches offer larger food service operations economical uses for leftovers, and they offer 
customers less expensive, quickly prepared meal options. Thus the ability to correctly prepare 
hot and cold sandwiches to order is a fundamental skill in many food service operations. 
 SANDWICH INGREDIENTS 
 Sandwiches are constructed from bread, a spread and one or more fillings. These com￾ponents should be intentionally selected and combined carefully so that the finished 
sandwich is flavorful and visually appealing. Sandwiches may be served hot, cold 
or with a combination of hot and cold fillings. An understanding of proper timing, 
efficient assembly skills and correct holding temperatures is essential for successful 
sandwich service. 
 Sandwich Breads 
 Bread holds or contains the spread and fillings and gives the sandwich its shape. Bread 
also adds flavor, texture, nutrition and color, and often determines the appearance of the 
finished product. Virtually any bread can be used in sandwich making. Rectangular sand￾wich or Pullman loaves are used to make classic club sandwiches and tea sandwiches, 
but rolls, biscuits, bagels, croissants, fruit and nut breads, whole-grain breads and savory 
breads as well as flatbreads such as naan, lavash and tortillas; pocket breads such as 
pitas; and flavorful breads such as focaccia and Swedish limpa are all good choices. 
 Whatever bread is used and whether its flavor is mild or intense, the bread should 
complement the fillings and not overpower them. Breads with dried fruit, nuts or seeds 
give a sandwich added flavor and textures. Boldly flavored dark breads such as dark rye 
and pumpernickel can be used with strongly flavored fillings, such as cured or smoked 
meat or fish. Any sandwich bread should be fresh (although day-old bread is easier to 
slice and is excellent toasted). Texture should also be considered when choosing bread 
for a sandwich. A coarse, open-grained loaf is unsuitable for moist, loose fillings such 
as a bound chicken salad. A bread’s texture should be able to withstand moisture from 
the spread and fillings without becoming soggy or pasty. An overly hard or crusty bread, 
however, may make a sandwich difficult to eat. 
 Sandwich Spreads 
 A spread adds flavor, moisture and richness to the sandwich, and sometimes helps to hold 
or bind the bread and fillings together. Some spreads, especially plain or flavored butters, 
also act as barriers to prevent the moisture in the filling from soaking into the bread. 
 There are three principal types of spreads: butter and soft cheese, mayonnaise and 
vegetable and bean purées. Generally only one spread is used on a sandwich, although 
other condiments such as mustard, ketchup or hot pepper sauce should be available to 
accommodate customers’ requests. 
 Pullman a long rectangular loaf of bread 
for slicing; also, the lidded pan in which this 
bread is baked 
 lavash a thin flatbread made from wheat, 
baked in a tandoor oven; commonly served in 
afghanistan, iran, Turkey and eurasian countries 
 a fine-grained sliced Pullman loaf is suitable for 
club and tea sandwiches. 
 crusty rolls, challah and whole-grain loaves 
and rolls are good options for sandwiches. 
M27_LABE1163_07_SE_C27.indd 838 28/10/23 5:10 PMSandwicheS 839
Butter and Soft Cheeses
One of the most common spreads, plain butter adds flavor and richness; it is also an 
effective moisture barrier. Flavored or compound butters, discussed in Chapter 11, Stocks 
and Sauces, make excellent sandwich spreads, adding flavor dimensions to the finished 
product. For example, try caper butter on a Cajun-style blackened beef sandwich or red 
chile and honey butter on a smoked turkey sandwich. Any butter spread should be soft￾ened or whipped so that it spreads easily without tearing the bread.
Like butter, cream cheese and soft cheese spreads such as flavored ricotta or Herb 
Cheese Spread (page 172) add richness and serve as a moisture barrier. Cream cheese 
can be flavored with herbs, condiments or minced vegetables to represent many interna￾tional flavor profiles, while still serving as a classic sandwich spread.
Mayonnaise
Mayonnaise, perhaps the most popular sandwich spread, adds moisture, richness and flavor 
and complements most meat, poultry, fish, shellfish, vegetable, egg and cheese fillings. Like 
butter, mayonnaise can be enhanced by adding flavoring ingredients such as garlic for Aïoli 
(page 769). Condiments (e.g., coarse-grained mustard or grated horseradish), herbs, spices 
and spice blends (e.g., curry or za’atar) and other ingredients such as anchovy paste and pesto 
sauce can be stirred into fresh or commercially prepared mayonnaise. Fresh mayonnaise can 
also be prepared with flavorful oils, such as olive oil, walnut oil or chile oil. See Chapter 24, 
Salads and Salad Dressings, for recipes and additional information on mayonnaise.
Vegetable and Bean Purées
Puréed vegetables or beans make healthy, flavorful, plant-based sandwich spreads. 
Options include roasted red pepper purée for a sandwich of Italian meats and cheeses, 
or a well-seasoned chickpea purée, guacamole or tofu sauce for a vegetarian sandwich 
such as Falafel (page 828). Unlike butter, vegetable and bean purées usually do not pro￾vide a moisture barrier between the bread and the fillings, although roasted nut butters 
and peanut butter prevent bread from becoming soggy.
Sandwich Fillings
The filling is the body of the sandwich, providing most of its flavor. A sandwich often 
contains more than one filling. For example, the filling in a Reuben sandwich is corned 
beef, cheese and sauerkraut, whereas in a BLT it is bacon, lettuce and tomato. Fillings 
for cold sandwiches must be precooked and properly chilled. Some hot sandwich fillings 
may be cooked or reheated to order.
When choosing fillings, be sure that the flavors complement each other. Their textures 
may be similar or contrasting. If an ingredient, such as lettuce, is supposed to be crisp, 
it should be very crisp, not limp. If an ingredient is supposed to be tender and moist, 
make sure it is tender and moist. Improperly prepared, poor-quality or mishandled filling 
ingredients can ruin an otherwise wonderful sandwich. The following material discusses 
popular sandwich fillings in more detail.
 Meats and Poultry
Almost any type of meat or poultry can be used as a sandwich filling. The only limitation 
is the creativity of the chef. Although the classic hot beef sandwich is the hamburger, other 
hot or cold beef products are also commonly used. For example, small steaks, slices of 
larger steak cuts such as the tenderloin, thin slices of roast beef and so on make excellent 
fillings. Also popular are sliced cured beef products, including corned beef, pastrami and 
smoked tongue as well as beef sausages such as salami, bologna and hot dogs. Lamb and 
pork are equally popular sandwich fillings whether the meat is ground and cooked like a 
hamburger patty or sliced from a well-seasoned roast. Lamb or pork loin and tenderloin are 
leaner meats that adapt well to various flavor combinations and cooking methods.
Cured meats, especially various ham and bacon products, served either hot or cold, are 
perennially popular sandwich fillings. Barbecued pork, pork sausages and pork hot dogs 
Mashed avocado makes a healthy, colorful 
spread for an open-faced sandwich.
M27_LABE1163_07_SE_C27.indd 839 28/10/23 5:10 PM840 chaPTeR TwenTY-SeVen
work well in sandwiches. Sliced turkey breast, either roasted or smoked, and processed 
turkey and ground turkey patties are commonly served in hot and cold sandwiches. 
Turkey bologna, turkey pastrami, turkey hot dogs and turkey ham may be chosen by 
customers because they generally have a lower fat content than the beef or pork options. 
Boneless chicken breast, either sliced or whole, can be prepared by a variety of methods 
and complements a broad range of sandwich flavors. A cold chicken or turkey salad 
bound with mayonnaise and incorporating fruit, nuts, celery, pickles or seasonings is 
another old-fashioned, but still beloved, option. Crispy fried chicken breasts, especially 
when well-seasoned, can also be served in lieu of ground beef in burger-like sandwiches.
Fish and Shellfish
Fried and grilled fish fillets are sandwich standards, and the fried oyster, shrimp and craw￾fish po’boys of New Orleans (page 856) have evolved from a lunch for dock workers to 
gourmet entrées. Canned fish products, particularly tuna and salmon, are also widely used 
as is smoked fish. Often fish and shellfish, especially tuna, shrimp, lobster or crab, serve as 
the foundation for mayonnaise-based bound salads. Sardines, anchovies and pickled herring 
are sometimes mixed into bound salads or arranged artistically on open-faced sandwiches.
Vegetables
Vegetables add texture, moisture, flavor and nutrition to sandwiches. Lettuce, onions and 
tomatoes are commonly used in combination with meat, cheese and other fillings. Celery or 
bell peppers add a nice crunchy texture to mayonnaise-based bound salad fillings. Vegetables 
can also stand on their own as sandwich fillings. Marinated, grilled or roasted vegetables can 
be featured in hot or cold sandwiches, and a combination of sliced, fresh vegetables and a 
flavorful dressing wrapped in soft pita bread, lavash or a tortilla becomes a portable salad.
Eggs
Hard-cooked eggs often appear as an ingredient in mayonnaise-based salads, where they 
are chopped and combined with seasonings. Hard-cooked eggs can also be sliced thin and 
used as an attractive garnish on open-faced sandwiches. Fried or scrambled eggs can be lay￾ered between pieces of bread or rolled in a tortilla for a breakfast sandwich or burrito. Fried 
eggs also top hamburgers or other meat and cheese sandwiches in regional specialties.
Cheeses
Cheese is available in such a variety of textures, flavors, colors and styles that it is a 
welcome addition to nearly any sandwich. Sliced cheese can fill hot or cold sandwiches, 
and melted cheese or a cheese sauce makes an excellent topping for hot open-faced 
sandwiches. Flavored cream cheese is a popular filling, particularly with bagels and fruit 
or nut breads. Semi-soft and firm cheese can be sliced, while rind-ripened cheese such 
as brie can be incorporated like a spread.
Bound Salads
Chicken, tuna, egg and ham salads bound with mayonnaise or salad dressing work well 
alone in sandwiches as well as in combination with other ingredients. Thin slices of apple 
or pear complement curried chicken or tuna salad sandwiches. Smoked fish is a natural 
pairing with egg salad. And thin-sliced pickled vegetables are always a welcome addition 
to bound salad sandwiches. Bound bean and grain salads are often the main element in a 
vegetarian sandwich. Bound salads are discussed in Chapter 24, Salads and Salad Dressings.
HOT AND COLD SANDWICHES
Sandwiches can be served hot or cold, closed or open-faced, depending on the way in 
which the ingredients are assembled and presented. In each case, sandwiches must be pre￾pared with care using suitable bread and fillings appropriate for the type of presentation.
History of Sandwiches
The term sandwich came into use 
approximately 200 years ago. The 
fourth earl of Sandwich, John 
Montagu (1718–1792), is credited 
with popularizing the concept of eating 
meats and cheeses between two slices of 
bread. apparently the earl, not wanting 
to leave the gaming tables that he 
loved so much, would demand that his 
servants bring him meat and bread. he 
combined the two and ate them with 
one hand, allowing him a free hand to 
continue playing. Some historians argue 
that a more likely scenario is that, as 
the head of defense, the earl was kept 
busy planning British strategy for the 
Revolutionary war underway in the 
american colonies. whichever the case, 
the name stuck.

Hot Sandwiches
Hot sandwiches may be served closed between two or more slices of bread or open-faced. 
They may be constructed so that they can be eaten in hand, such as a hot grilled cheese 
sandwich. Or such sandwiches may be constructed to be eaten with a knife and fork.
Hot Closed Sandwiches
Hot closed sandwiches include those in which the filling ingredients are served hot, 
such as a hamburger or hot dog, and those where the entire sandwich is heated for ser￾vice, such as a grilled cheese or Monte Cristo. Hot closed sandwiches can be categorized 
as basic, grilled or deep-fried.
Basic hot closed sandwiches are generally those in which the principal filling is 
served hot between two pieces of bread. These sandwiches may also include fillings 
that are not hot, such as tomato slices and lettuce leaves. Variations of the basic hot 
closed sandwich include tacos, quesadillas, burritos (or burros) and wraps, in which 
the fillings are folded or wrapped in a tortilla or other supple flatbread as shown in
the procedure on page 843.
Sliders are basic hot closed sandwiches prepared on small buns. These small two￾bite portions are said to slide down easily, hence their name. Popular fillings for sliders 
are miniature hamburger patties, grilled sausages, meatballs, miniature crab cakes, fried 
oysters or smaller quantities of spreads or other fillings.
Grilled sandwiches are those in which the filling is placed between two pieces 
of bread, which are buttered on the outside and then browned on a griddle or in a 
sauté pan. In grilled sandwiches, the fillings are warmed during this procedure but 
do not cook. Therefore fillings such as bacon or sliced meat should be fully cooked 
before the sandwich is assembled and grilled. Avoid overfilling the bread for grilled 
sandwiches.
When preparing grilled cheese sandwiches for production, for each sandwich place 
two slices of buttered bread on a hot griddle. Position the cheese so that when it melts, 
it covers the bread evenly. When the cheese has melted and the bread has browned, 
close the sandwich.
1 Butter bread for grilled sandwich. Precook ingredients as required. assemble sandwich.
2 Place the closed sandwich into a pre-heated buttered pan over medium heat.
3 when the bread is evenly browned, flip the sandwich over and brown on the other side.

A sandwich grill, also known as a panini grill, with a heated hinged lid, makes quick 
work of grilling sandwiches because it allows them to be toasted on both sides without 
flipping. The weight of the heated lid presses on the sandwich, flattening it slightly and 
leaving decorative grill marks. If a panini grill is not available, a grill weight may be 
placed on top of a sandwich to flatten it during cooking.
➊ Place filled sandwiches on a preheated 
panini grill, then close the lid.
➋ Remove sandwiches when heated 
through and visibly browned.
Procedure for Preparing Sandwiches on a Panini Grill
Deep-fried sandwiches are made by dipping a closed sandwich in egg batter and then 
pan-frying or deep-frying it. The most common example is the Monte Cristo (page 855), 
which is white bread filled with sliced ham, Swiss cheese and Dijon mustard.
Hot Open-Faced Sandwiches
Not all sandwiches are eaten by hand, as the hot open-faced turkey or steak sandwich 
proved long ago. In the typical hot open-faced sandwich, bread (grilled, toasted or 
fresh) is placed on a serving plate, covered with hot meat or other filling and topped 
with an appropriate gravy, sauce or cheese. The completed dish is often browned under 
a broiler immediately before service. Condiments and garnishes are usually served on the 
side. Figure 27.1 illustrates one method for preparing a hot open-faced sandwich.
Cold Sandwiches
Cold sandwiches are made with raw ingredients that are not intended to be cooked, such 
as vegetables and cheese, or with meat, poultry, fish or shellfish that is precooked and 
chilled before use as a filling. Cold sandwiches may be closed or open-faced.
Cold Closed Sandwiches
Cold closed sandwiches contain two or more pieces of bread with one or more fillings 
and one or more spreads. Cold closed sandwiches are usually eaten with the hands and 
come in three basic styles: basic, multidecker and tea.
Basic cold sandwiches are made with two pieces of bread (or one split roll), one 
spread and one or more fillings. A tuna salad sandwich and an Italian-style submarine 
are examples of basic cold closed sandwiches. A variation of the basic cold sandwich is a 
wrap with cold fillings—for example, an herb-flavored tortilla spread with peanut sauce 
wrapped around spinach leaves, diced grilled chicken and cold cooked rice. (See Grilled 
Chicken, Avocado and Vegetable Wrap, page 852.)
Multidecker cold sandwiches are made with three or more pieces of bread, one or 
more spreads and two or more fillings. The club sandwich, in which sliced turkey, 
bacon, lettuce and tomato are layered with three slices of toasted bread, is a classic 
example of a multidecker sandwich. (See Club Sandwich, page 852.)

 Procedure for Preparing Wrap Sandwiches 
➊ Top the flatbread or tortilla with a 
spread or dressing. 
➋ Mound the vegetables and meat, fish or 
poultry items across the flatbread or tortilla. 
➌ Roll the flatbread or tortilla tightly 
around the filling. 
 Procedure for Preparing Cold Multidecker Sandwiches 
➊ Spread the first slice of toasted bread with 
butter or mayonnaise, then top with lettuce, 
vegetables and meat. 
➋ add the second slice of bread and spread 
with mayonnaise. 
➌ add a second layer of lettuce, vegetables 
and meat. 
➍ cut the finished sandwich into quarters 
for service.

Tea sandwiches are small, fancy constructions made with light, soft, trimmed breads 
and delicate fillings and spreads. The name derives from their service at afternoon tea. 
They are usually cut or rolled into shapes such as diamonds, circles or pinwheels and 
served as a finger food at parties and receptions; on these occasions they may also be 
called finger sandwiches. Bound chicken, ham, shrimp or tuna salad are popular fillings 
for tea sandwiches as are thin slices of cucumber on buttered bread.
Smørbrød featuring smoked salmon (top), roast beef (middle) 
and shrimp (bottom) are attractively garnished with items that 
complement the principal ingredient.
Cold Open-Faced Sandwiches
Cold open-faced sandwiches are larger versions of canapés, which are discussed in 
Chapter 29, Hors d’Oeuvre. Popular styles are the open-faced Norwegian sandwich 
known as smørbrød and the French open-faced sandwich known as tartine. As with 
canapés, much emphasis is placed on visual appeal. A single slice of bread is coated 
with a spread, then covered with thin slices of meat, poultry or fish, or a thin layer of 
a bound salad. Carefully cut and arranged garnishes, such as hard-cooked eggs, fresh 
herbs, grilled vegetables, pickles, onions and radishes, are used to complete the pre￾sentation. A simple version of an open-faced cold sandwich is a delicatessen classic—a 
bagel with lox and cream cheese.
smørbrød [SMURR-bruh] norwegian cold 
open-faced sandwiches; the related Swedish 
term smörgåsbord [SMORe-guhs-bohrd] 
refers to a buffet table of bread and butter, 
salads, open-faced sandwiches, pickled or 
marinated fish, sliced meats and cheeses
tartine fresh or toasted bread spread with 
butter, jam or savory spreads and toppings
assorted tea sandwiches
MISE EN PLACE FOR ASSEMBLING SANDWICHES 
MADE TO ORDER
Sandwiches are often prepared to order and their preparation requires a great deal of 
mise en place. The goal is to assemble all ingredients and equipment within easy reach to 
minimize movement and ensure efficiency at the time of final assembly. Many sandwich 
ingredients are highly perishable: lettuce wilts, bread goes stale and cheese dries out. Therefore, 
the ingredients need to be selected, prepared and stored in a way that preserves freshness 
and flavor. The process of building sandwiches can easily cause cross-contamination. Cooks 
must observe the strictest sanitation standards in this environment.
Because each menu and food service operation has its own requirements, there is no 
one correct way to set up a sandwich station, but there are a few basic guidelines:
M27_LABE1163_07_SE_C27.indd 844 28/10/23 5:10 PMSandwicheS 845
	▪ Prepare ingredients. All sandwich ingredients should be cooked, 
mixed, sliced and prepared ahead of service to facilitate quick, 
efficient assembly at service time. Before service, slice meats, 
cheeses and vegetables; clean and dry lettuce and other fresh 
vegetable ingredients; blend flavored spreads; mix bound salads; 
slice bread and buns; and so on. Consider how far in advance 
ingredients can be prepared. For example, sauces such as hummus 
or aïoli may be prepared 1–2 days in advance, but fresh vegetables 
and bound salads may need to be prepared fresh daily.
	▪ Arrange and store ingredients. Arrange all sandwich ingredients 
within easy reach of the work area. Cold items must be properly 
refrigerated at all times. A sandwich bar (pictured here) is 
similar to a steam table but with refrigerated compartments. 
They are used to hold ingredients at the proper temperature, 
while still allowing the cook to have ready access. Sliced meats, 
cheeses and vegetables are stored in small hotel pans that fit 
into a recessed space on top of the bar. These pans keep foods 
separated and can be easily replenished with fresh containers as ingredients are 
used. Ingredients are always arranged in the same locations. This organization 
makes it easy to reach for whatever is needed without searching. Under￾counter refrigeration can be used for backup supplies and less frequently used 
ingredients. Keep all foodstuffs well covered to prevent them from drying out or 
being contaminated.
	▪ Select and arrange equipment. The heavy equipment needed for making 
sandwiches might include preparation equipment such as meat slicers, 
griddles, toasters, grills, fryers and broilers as well as storage equipment such 
as refrigerated sandwich bars for cold ingredients and steam tables for hot 
ingredients. Even the simplest sandwich menu requires the use of basic hand 
tools such as spatulas, spreaders, portion scoops, scales, knives and cutting 
boards. Be sure that the supply of such items is adequate to permit quick 
handwork and to avoid delays.
	▪ Control Food Cost. To prevent waste, use prep lists (page 184) and verify 
ingredient inventory at the sandwich station before each shift. The goal is to 
prepare only what is needed for a shift, while still having enough back-up of 
ingredients to avoid running out during service. Some operations prefer to pre￾portion ingredients, either by weight or count, and wrap individual portions 
for storage. This not only saves time during service, it also ensures consistent 
products and is a simple step in controlling food costs.
PRESENTING AND GARNISHING SANDWICHES
Sandwiches, especially cold closed sandwiches, are usually cut into halves, thirds or 
 quarters for service. Cutting makes a sandwich easier to handle and allows for a more 
attractive presentation; the sandwich wedges can be arranged to add height to the plate 
and to expose the fillings’ colors and textures. For sit-down service, hot closed sandwiches 
such as hamburgers are often presented open-faced. Condiments, such as mustard and 
 mayonnaise, and garnishes, such as sliced tomatoes, onions, pickles and lettuce leaves, 
are served on the side or on one of the open bun halves. This attractive presentation 
allows the customer to assemble and add ingredients to the sandwich as desired.
Although a sandwich can be a meal unto itself, it may be served with a salad or 
starch accompaniment. These accompaniments can serve as functional garnishes that are 
more than decorative and enhance the foods on the plate. Potato chips or French-fried 
potatoes are standard fare, perhaps because they are also finger foods and they provide 
a crunchy texture. Bound salads, such as potato and macaroni, are also common starch 
accompaniments. Plated sandwiches have long been served with coleslaw, fruit salad or 
a small mixed green salad as side dishes. The standard soup-and-sandwich combo—half 
a sandwich with a cup of soup—is a lunch menu standard.
 Safety Alert
Sandwich Sanitation
Sandwiches, whether hot or cold, present 
a particularly dangerous environment for 
the spread of food-borne illnesses. They 
are often served at room temperature 
using time and temperature controlled for 
safety (TcS) foods. The use of uncooked 
lettuce and other vegetables, the use of 
high-protein foods such as meat and 
poultry, the combination of hot and cold 
ingredients and the presence of uncooked 
eggs in spreads such as homemade 
mayonnaise offer an environment that is 
attractive to bacteria. cross-contamination 
is an especially common problem 
because of the repeated use of spatulas, 
spreaders, scales, knives, cutting boards 
and, deadliest of all, human hands. Take 
extra care to wash hands frequently and 
to use disposable gloves properly; clean 
work surfaces and tools with a sanitizer 
frequently during service. The cardinal 
rule for proper food handling applies as 
well: Keep hot foods hot; keep cold foods 
cold. Review chapter 2, Food Safety and 
Sanitation, for further information.

 Greatest Hits from the Sandwich Counter 
 writing in Le Guide culinaire in 1903, auguste 
escoffier describes just two types of sandwiches: 
those “with two slices of buttered bread ... 
covering a slice of ham or tongue, etc.” and “the 
kind served at elaborate functions,” which are 
much smaller, and in which the “sandwiched 
product (whatever this be)” is diced. among his 
list of common sandwich ingredients are ham, 
beef, chicken, foie gras, caviar and watercress. 
 Today’s cook must recognize a somewhat 
wider variety of sandwiches, however. and, as the 
following list shows, often a sandwich’s popular 
name bears no connection to its ingredients. 
Bao: chinese steamed yeast bun traditionally 
filled with braised pork. Such buns are now 
filled with everything from spicy fried chicken 
to kimchi and roast duck. 
Croque Monsieur: ham and cheese sandwich 
dipped in beaten egg and grilled; made 
popular by bars and bistros throughout Paris. 
Fluffernutter: Peanut butter and marshmallow 
fluff spread on—what else?—white bread; 
popular during the 1960s. 
French Dip: Thin slices of roast beef in a 
crusty French-bread roll served au jus. 
Gyro: well-seasoned rotisserie-roasted lamb, 
thinly sliced and served wrapped in pita 
bread with onions and cucumber-yogurt 
dressing. a Greek american creation, the 
gyro [YeaR-o] sandwich became popular at 
Greek lunch counters in chicago and new 
York city during the 1970s. 
Panino: a crusty roll layered with cold 
cuts and cheese such as salami, ham, 
prosciutto and fontina; usually grilled 
and served warm. The plural form, 
panini , is often used when referring to 
this italian specialty. 
Patty Melt: Thin hamburger patty on rye 
bread with cheddar, Swiss or emmenthaler 
cheese and sautéed onions griddled in 
butter. Many claim the sandwich 
originated in the 1950s in hollywood at 
Tiny naylor’s drive-in. 
Pimento Cheese: a spread made with 
shredded cheddar cheese, mayonnaise 
and roasted red peppers (pimentos) 
served on sliced white bread. Popular 
in the Southeastern United States, the 
sandwich is often embellished with 
jalapeños, ham or sliced pickles. 
Po’ Boy: French bread loaf split and 
filled with various ingredients, 
especially fried oysters or shrimp and 
rémoulade sauce. created during the 
1920s, it is new Orleans’ version of a 
submarine sandwich. 
Reuben: corned beef, Swiss or emmenthaler 
cheese, sauerkraut and mustard or 
Thousand island dressing grilled between 
two slices of rye bread. The Reuben was 
probably created during the early 1900s by 
arnold Reuben, owner of new York city’s 
Reuben’s Restaurant. 
Taco al Pastor: chile-marinated rotisserie 
pork shoulder and pineapple, similar to the 
gyro. The meat and fruit are shaved onto 
warm corn tortillas, served with salsa and 
onions in a dish that migrated from taco 
trucks into the dining room.

Hamburger Boom
Recognizing the undisputed popularity of 
the hamburger, chefs are responding with 
burgers from humble to haute. Smothered 
with pulled pork or studded with foie 
gras, hamburgers lend themselves to 
customization. consider the following 
to inspire your creativity. combine 
different cuts of beef to enhance flavor. 
Make burgers from ground chicken, 
chorizo sausage, lamb, salmon, tuna or 
grilled vegetables. incorporate flavors 
from diverse cuisines such as German 
(sauerkraut), Korean (gochujang sauce 
and kimchi) or Peruvian (aji chile 
mayonnaise). add texture by layering 
julienne vegetables or fries under the bun. 
explore the world of fine cheese when 
choosing a topping. and reconsider the 
bun. Use portabella mushroom caps, 
rosti potato cakes or miniature waffles in 
place of a standard bread product.

Sabich (Israeli-Style Vegetable Sandwich)
This iconic Israeli sandwich was first sold at Sabich Zvi’s food stall in an industrial area of Tel Aviv in 
the early 1960s. As an Iraqi Jew, Sabich assembled these hearty vegetarian sandwiches from foods 
typically eaten for breakfast in Iraq. Filling fresh pita bread with tomatoes, cucumbers, fried eggplant, 
boiled eggs, tahini and a smear of sour mango amba, created something greater than the sum of its 
parts. The name Sabich soon came to represent the sandwich itself as popularity grew and competing 
stands appeared throughout Israel.

 Charcuterie [shar-COO-tuhr-ree] is the classic art of preparing meat products—
especially pork—into pâtés, galantines, sausages and hams. Over the years, how￾ever, the term has also come to refer to similar products made with game, poultry, 
fish, shellfish and vegetables. Charcuterie also encompasses food preservation by curing and 
smoking. it has regained popularity as chefs look to prevent food waste and use every cut of 
meat, poultry or fish in flavorful and economical ways. 
 Charcuterie is an art and science in itself, an important set of skills of the chef garde man￾ger. this chapter is not intended to be a complete guide to the charcutier’s art. instead this 
chapter focuses on procedures for making common charcuterie items that can be prepared 
easily in most kitchens. We first introduce and describe forcemeats. We then discuss sausage 
preparation and curing methods, including salt curing, brining and both cold and hot smok￾ing. the chapter ends with information about several cured pork and meat products. 
 FORCEMEATS 
 Forcemeats are uncooked meat, poultry, fish, shellfish or vegetables combined with 
binders, seasonings and, sometimes, garnishes. The ingredients are emulsified with fat. 
Chefs can use various combinations of these basic ingredients to prepare a wide array of 
forcemeats. Forcemeats then become the primary ingredient in pâtés, terrines, galantines 
and sausages. 
 The word forcemeat is derived from the French word farce , meaning “stuffing.” 
Depending on the preparation method, a forcemeat can be very smooth and velvety, 
well-textured and coarse, or anything in between. Regardless of its intended use, force￾meat has a glossy appearance when raw and slices cleanly when cooked. 
 Forcemeats are emulsified products. Emulsification is the process of binding two ingre￾dients that ordinarily do not combine. (Emulsified sauces are discussed in Chapter 11 , 
Stocks and Sauces; emulsified salad dressings are discussed in Chapter 24 , Salads and 
Salad Dressings.) Proteins present in meat, poultry, fish and shellfish combine easily with 
both fat and liquids. In forcemeats, these proteins act as stabilizers that allow the fat and 
liquids, which ordinarily would not combine, to bind. A properly emulsified forcemeat 
provides a rich flavor and a comforting texture on the palate. When improperly emulsi￾fied forcemeats are cooked, they lose their fat, shrink and become dry and grainy. To 
ensure proper emulsification of a forcemeat: 
▪ the ratio of fat to other ingredients must be precise 
▪ the temperature must be maintained below 40°F (4°C) 
▪ the ingredients must be mixed properly 
 EQUIPMENT FOR PREPARING FORCEMEATS 
 A food chopper or food processor and a heavy-duty drum sieve with a metal band are 
essential for forcemeat preparation. A standard meat grinder or meat-grinding attach￾ment with various-sized grinding dies is also useful, especially when preparing meats for 
coarse pâtés and sausage. The meat-grinding attachment is affixed to the front hub of a 
stand mixer or may be a stand-alone unit. 
 To use a meat grinder, cubes of cold meat and fat are pushed through the feed tube 
of the grinder’s hopper. (See Figure 28. 1 .) If the meat is properly chilled, it will be fed 
by the screw (worm feed) to the blade. The sharp-edged X-blade cuts the meat while 
forcing it through the holes in the die (grinding plate). The size of the holes in the die 
determines the texture of the grind. The cover (ring) holds the die and X-blade in place.

FORCEMEAT INGREDIENTS
Forcemeats are made by combining meats, fats, binders, seasonings and garnishes to cre￾ate various flavor profiles and textures. All ingredients should be of the finest quality and 
used in the correct ratios following proper safe food-handling procedures.
Meats
The dominant meat or dominant ingredient is the meat, poultry, vegetable, fish or 
shellfish that gives the forcemeat its name and essential flavor. When preparing meats, 
poultry or fish for forcemeat, it is important to trim away all silverskin, gristle and small 
bones so that the meat can be more easily ground.
Many forcemeats contain some fatty pork to add moisture and smoothness. Without it, 
poultry-based forcemeats tend to be rubbery and venison and other game-based force￾meats tend to be dry. The traditional ratio is one part pork to two parts dominant meat.
Many forcemeats also contain some liver. Pork or chicken livers are commonly used. 
Liver contributes flavor as well as binding to the forcemeat. For a finer texture, grind the 
livers and force them through a drum sieve before incorporating them into the forcemeat.
Fats
Here, fat refers to a separate ingredient, not the marbling fat in the dominant meat or 
pork, both of which should be quite lean to ensure the correct ratio of fat to meat. Pork 
fatback or heavy cream is used to add moisture and richness to the forcemeat. Because 
fat carries flavor, it also promotes the proper infusion of flavors and smokey aromas.
Binders
There are two principal types of binders: panadas and eggs.
A panada [pah-NAHD-ah] is usually crustless white bread soaked in milk or, more 
traditionally, a heavy béchamel sauce or cooked rice. Panada is included in a forcemeat 
to enhance smoothness (especially in fish mousselines, which tend to be slightly grainy 
in texture), to aid emulsification (especially in vegetable terrines, in which the protein 
levels are insufficient to bind on their own) or both (e.g., in liver mousses). The panada 
should not make up more than 20 percent of the forcemeat’s total weight.
Eggs or egg whites are used as a primary binding agent in some styles of forcemeat, 
such as those made with finely ground chicken, fish, shellfish or vegetables. If used in 
forcemeats that have a large ratio of liver or liquids, eggs are also used to add texture.

 Safety Alert 
Forcemeats
Forcemeats require time and temperature 
control for safety (tCS). they must be 
kept cold—40°F (4°C) or below—both 
before and after cooking. Because of the 
way the ingredients are ground together, 
any surface bacteria are distributed 
throughout the forcemeat. Chill metal 
grinders, food processor parts and 
other equipment before use and keep all 
cutting boards, knives and food contact 
surfaces clean and sanitary. Check the 
internal temperature carefully when 
cooking to ensure that it reaches at least 
165°F (74°C) for poultry or game-based 
forcemeats, 155°F (68°C) for meat￾based forcemeats or 145°F (63°C) for 
fish- or vegetable-based forcemeats. 
Consider carryover cooking, which will 
raise the temperature.
panada; panade [pah-nahd] (1) something 
other than fat added to a forcemeat to enhance 
smoothness, aid emulsification or both, such as 
béchamel, rice or crustless white bread soaked 
in milk; (2) a mixture for binding stuffings and 
dumplings, notably quenelles; often choux 
pastry, bread crumbs, frangipane, puréed 
potatoes or rice

Seasonings
Forcemeats are seasoned with salt, curing salt, marinades and various herbs and spices. 
Salt not only adds flavor but also aids in emulsifying the meat and fat. A forcemeat that 
lacks salt will taste flat.
Curing salt (Fr. sel rose) is a mixture of salt and sodium nitrite sold under many 
brand names. Sodium nitrite controls spoilage by inhibiting bacterial growth. Equally 
important, curing salt preserves the rosy, pink colors of forcemeats that might otherwise 
oxidize to an unappetizing gray. Curing salt is usually tinted pink to distinguish it from 
table salt. Although currently regarded as substantially safer than the previously used 
potassium nitrate (saltpeter), some studies suggest that sodium nitrite is a carcinogen. For 
a typical consumer, however, the tiny amount of sodium nitrite consumed from cured 
meats should not pose a health threat.
Traditionally ingredients for forcemeats were marinated for long periods, sometimes 
days, before grinding. The trend today is for a shorter marinating time so that the true 
flavors of the main ingredients shine through. Both classic and contemporary marinades 
include herbs, citrus zest, spices and liquors, all of which lend flavor, character and 
nuance to the forcemeat.
Pâté spice is a mixture of spices and dried herbs that can be premixed and used 
as needed. The following recipe offers a typical flavor profile but can be adjusted 
as desired. Keep stored in an airtight container in a dry place.

Garnishes
In this context, garnishes are small quantities of meats, fat, vegetables or other foods 
added to provide contrasting flavors and textures and to enhance appearance. The gar￾nishes are usually sliced, diced or more coarsely ground than the dominant ingredient so 
that they are visible in the finished product. Common garnishes include pistachio nuts, 
whole peppercorns, diced fatback, truffles or truffle peelings and diced cooked ham or 
tongue.

PREPARING FORCEMEATS
The three common forcemeat preparations are country-style, basic and mousseline. 
Other types of forcemeat preparations such as the emulsified mixture used to make hot 
dogs and bratwurst are not commonly encountered in food service operations and are 
not discussed here.
When preparing any forcemeat, it is important to follow these guidelines:
	▪ Forcemeat preparations include raw meats, eggs and dairy products. If 
improperly handled, these time and temperature control for safety (TCS) foods 
create a good environment for the growth of microorganisms. To avoid the 
risk of food-borne illness, temperatures must be carefully controlled, and all 
cutting boards and food contact surfaces must be as sanitary as possible at all 
times.
	▪ To ensure a proper emulsification, the forcemeat must be kept cold—below 40°F 
(4°C)—at all times. Refrigerate all ingredients, and keep forcemeats currently 
being processed in an ice bath. Chilling or freezing food grinder and processor 
parts that will come into contact with the forcemeat helps keep the ingredients as 
cold as possible.
	▪ Cut all foods into sizes that fit easily into grinder openings. Do not overstuff 
grinders or overfill food processors. When grinding items twice, always 
begin with a larger die, followed by a medium or small die. For exceptional 
smoothness, press the forcemeat through a sieve after grinding to remove any 
lumps or pieces of membrane.
To test a forcemeat’s seasoning and texture, cook and taste a small portion before 
the entire batch is cooked. (Unlike sauces, stews and other dishes, a forcemeat cannot 
be tasted during the cooking process to adjust the seasonings.) A small portion of a 
hearty forcemeat can be sautéed; a small portion of a more delicate forcemeat should 
be poached for 3–5 minutes. When cooked, the forcemeat should hold its shape and 
be slightly firm but not rubbery. If it is too firm, add a little cream. Adjust the season￾ings appropriately; keep in mind that foods served cold may require additional salt and 
seasonings.
Country-Style Forcemeats
A traditional country-style forcemeat is heavily seasoned with onions, garlic, pepper, 
juniper berries and bay leaves. It is the simplest of the forcemeats to prepare and yields 
the heartiest and most distinctive pâtés and sausages.
The meat for a country-style forcemeat is usually ground once through the grinder’s 
large die, then ground again through the medium die. This produces the characteristic 
coarse, country-style texture. As with most forcemeats, the meat for a country-style force￾meat is usually marinated and seasoned before grinding and then mixed with some liver 
that has been ground separately.

3 Marinate, under refrigeration, the dominant meat and pork meat with the desired herbs, 
spices and liquors.
4 if using liver, grind it and force it through a sieve.
5 Cut the fatback into an appropriate size and freeze.
6 Prepare an ice bath with a clean bowl for receiving the ground meat. then grind the 
dominant meat, pork and fat as directed in the recipe, usually once through the grinder’s 
largest die and a second time through the medium die.
7 Working over an ice bath, fold in any liver, eggs, panada or garnishes by hand.
8 Cook a small portion of the forcemeat; adjust the seasonings and texture as appropriate.
9 refrigerate the forcemeat until needed.

Basic Forcemeats
Smoother and more refined than a country-style forcemeat, a basic forcemeat is probably 
the most versatile type. It should be well seasoned, but the seasonings should not mask 
the dominant meat’s flavor. Examples of basic forcemeats are those used in most game 
pâtés and terrines as well as traditional pâtés en croûte.
A basic forcemeat is made by grinding the meat and fat separately—the meat twice 
and the fat once. The fat is then worked into the meat, either by hand or in a food 
processor or chopper. A quicker method involves grinding the fat and meat together 
and then blending them in a food processor. Some recipes call for the incorporation of 
crushed ice to minimize friction, reduce temperature and add moisture.
Procedure for Preparing a Basic Forcemeat
1 Chill all ingredients and equipment thoroughly. throughout preparation, ingredients and 
equipment should remain at temperatures below 40°F (4°C).
2 Cut all meats into an appropriate size for grinding.
3 Marinate, under refrigeration, the dominant meat and pork with the desired herbs, spices 
and liquors.
4 if using liver, grind it and force it through a sieve.
5 Cut the fatback into an appropriate size and freeze.
6 Grind the meats twice, once through the grinder’s large die and then through the medium 
die; hold in a stainless steel bowl over an ice bath.
7 Grind the chilled or frozen fat once through the medium die and add it to the meat mixture.
8 Work the fat into the meat over an ice bath or in a well-chilled food processor or chopping 
machine.
9 Over an ice bath, add any required eggs, panada and/or garnishes and work them into the 
mixture. Be careful not to overmix the forcemeat ingredients as this can cause air bubbles 
to appear in the finished product.
10 Cook a small portion of the forcemeat in stock or water; adjust the seasonings and texture 
as appropriate.
11 refrigerate the forcemeat until needed.
An alternative method for preparing a basic forcemeat replaces Steps 6–9 with the fol￾lowing procedures:
alt 6 Grind the meats and fats together twice.
alt 7 Place them in a food processor or chopper and blend until smooth.
alt 8 Add any required eggs or panada while the machine is running and blend them 
with the meat and fat.
alt 9 Remove the forcemeat from the machine and, working over an ice bath, fold in 
any garnishes by hand.
Whichever method is used, a particularly warm kitchen or a lengthy running time in the 
food processor or chopping machine may necessitate the addition of small quantities of 
crushed ice to properly emulsify the forcemeat. Add the ice bit by bit while the machine 
is running.
➍ Combining the liver and eggs into the 
coarse and medium ground pork mixture 
over an ice bath to keep the ingredients cold.

 Mousseline Forcemeats
A properly made mousseline [moos-uh-LEEN] forcemeat is light, airy and delicately fla￾vored. It is most often made with fish or shellfish but sometimes with veal, pork, feathered 
game or poultry. (A mousseline forcemeat is not the same as a mousse, which usually 
contains gelatin and is discussed later.)
A mousseline forcemeat is prepared by processing ground meats and cream in a food 
processor; often egg whites are added to lighten and enrich the mixture. The proportion 
of fish or dominant meat to eggs and cream is very important: too many egg whites, and 
the mousseline will be rubbery; too few, and it may not bind together. If too much cream 
is added, the mousseline will be too soft or will fall apart during cooking.
A mousseline forcemeat can be served hot or cold. It can be used to make fish sau￾sages and a variety of timbales and terrines, or it can be used to make quenelles, which 
are discussed later. A shrimp mousseline is used with paupiettes of sole or flounder 
(page 568).
Procedure for Preparing a Mousseline Forcemeat
1 Chill all ingredients and equipment thoroughly. throughout preparation, ingredients and 
equipment should remain at temperatures below 40°F (4°C).
2 Cut all meats into an appropriate size for processing.
3 Grind the meat in a cold food processor until smooth. to avoid incorporating air and 
overheating the forcemeat, do not overprocess it.
4 add eggs and pulse until just blended.
5 add cream and seasonings in a steady stream while the machine is running. Stop the 
machine and scrape down the sides of the bowl once or twice during the processing. Do 
not run the machine any longer than necessary to achieve a smooth forcemeat.
6 if desired, pass the forcemeat through a drum sieve to remove any sinew or bits of bone.
7 Over an ice bath, fold in any garnishes by hand.
8 Poach a small amount of the mousseline in stock or water. taste and adjust the seasonings 
and texture as necessary.
9 refrigerate until needed.

5 With the machine running, add the cream in a slow, steady stream. Check the consistency, adding 
only enough cream to make a firm but smooth forcemeat.
6 Scrape down the bowl again and process the mousseline until it is smooth and well mixed. to avoid 
incorporating air and overheating the forcemeat, do not overprocess it.
7 remove the mousseline from the machine and hold over an ice bath. if additional smoothness is 
desired, force the mousseline through a drum sieve in small batches using a plastic scraper or rub￾ber spatula.

as necessary. the forcemeat is now ready to cook as quenelles or use as desired in the preparation 
of pâtés, terrines, galantines and sausages.
Note Forcemeat made only from fish requires the least amount of cream of any forcemeat. Meat 
that is very cold, near 32°F (0°C) or colder, absorbs less cream than meat that is merely chilled.

USING FORCEMEATS TO PREPARE TERRINES, 
PÂTÉS AND GALENTINES
Forcemeats are used to prepare terrines, pâtés, galantines and sausages.
Traditionally a pâté [pah-TAY] was a savory meat filling wrapped in pastry, baked and 
served hot or cold. A terrine was considered more basic, consisting of coarsely ground 
and highly seasoned meats baked in an earthenware mold and always served cold. (The 
mold is also called a terrine.) Today many types of pâtés are baked in loaf-type pans 
without a crust, which according to tradition would make them terrines, whereas pâtés 
baked in pastry are called pâtés en croûte [pah-TAY awn croot]. Thus the terms pâté
and terrine are now used almost interchangeably. Galantines [gal-uhn-TEEN] are force￾meats of poultry, game or suckling pig that are wrapped in the skin of the bird or animal 
and poached in an appropriate stock. They are usually served cold. Ballotines [bahl￾lo-TEEN] are similar but are generally made of deboned poultry legs and are served hot.
Terrines, pâtés and galantines are often made with forcemeats layered with garnishes 
to produce a decorative or mosaic effect when sliced. For a decorative effect, the same 
types of garnishes that have been folded into country-style and other forcemeats can be 
added between layers. Garnishes should always be cooked before they are added to the 
pâté, terrine or galantine, or they shrink during cooking, creating air pockets.
Pâté pans, molds and terrines come in a variety of shapes and sizes. Pâtés that are 
not baked in a crust can be prepared in standard metal pans of any shape, although 
rectangular loaf pans make portioning the cooked pâté much easier. For pâtés en croûte, 
the best pans are collapsible or hinged, made of thin metal with a nonstick surface. 
They make it easier to remove the pâté after baking. Collapsible and hinged pans come 
in various shapes and sizes, from small plain rectangles to large intricately fluted ovals. 
Traditional earthenware molds and terrines as well as ones made from enameled cast 
iron, metal, glass or silicone are available.
Aspic Jelly
Aspic jelly is a savory jelly produced by increasing the gelatin content of a strong stock 
and then clarifying the stock following the process for preparing consommé discussed 
in Chapter 12, Soups. It is an important and versatile ingredient used in the finishing 
and presentation of terrines, pâtés and galantines as well as other foods. (It is also used 
extensively to enhance the presentation of foods for buffets and in culinary competi￾tions.) Because of its range of applications when preparing and serving forcemeats, we 
introduce it here in the context of using forcemeats. Procedures for using aspic jelly are 
discussed later in this chapter on page 873.
Form the quenelles using two spoons and 
poach until done.
Pâté en croûte mold
Quenelles
Quenelles [kuh-NEHL] are small dumpling-shaped portions of a mousseline forcemeat 
poached in an appropriately flavored stock.
M28_LABE1163_07_SE_C28.indd 869 31/10/23 9:01 PM870 ChaPter tWeNtY-eiGht
Although gelatin is a natural ingredient present in all good meat or poultry stocks, 
additional gelatin can be added to a stock to assist gelling (setting). One way is to 
produce a stock with an extremely high gelatin content by using gelatinous meats 
and bones such as calves’ feet, pigs’ ears and pork skin; another is to add plain 
gelatin to a finished stock. Another technique is to add gelatin directly to a flavorful 
consommé.
Aspic jelly is used to bind savory mousses, glaze slices of pâté and coat molded 
mousses. (See page 873.) Aspic jelly is funneled into cooked pâtés en croûte to fill 
the gaps created when the forcemeat shrinks during the cooking process as shown 
on page 875. It is also the basis of aspic molds or terrines, in which layers of cooked 
meats or vegetables are bound together and held in place by the aspic jelly. In addi￾tion to adding flavor and shine, a coating of aspic jelly prevents displayed foods from 
drying out and inhibits the oxidation of sliced red meats. Aspic jelly is often lightly fla￾vored with a liquor such as Madeira and cut into decorative garnishes for both plated 
presentations and buffet displays. Decorative platters on which pâtés are displayed 
may be coated with aspic jelly.
The gelatin content of aspic jelly varies depending on its intended use. Table 28.1 
lists guidelines for quantities of gelatin to use in various applications. Aspic jelly used 
only for display can have a very high gelatin content for easier handling. Aspic jelly to 
be eaten should be fairly firm when cold. At room temperature it should be gelled but 
tender enough to melt quickly in the mouth. To test the gelatin content of a liquid, pour 
one teaspoon (5 milliliters) onto a plate and refrigerate the plate for a few minutes. If the 
liquid does not gel firmly, soften additional gelatin in a small amount of cool liquid and 
add it to the hot liquid.
Terrines
Terrines are forcemeats baked in a mold without a crust. The mold can be a traditional 
earthenware dish or some other appropriate metal, enameled cast iron or glass. Any 
type of forcemeat can be used to make a terrine. A terrine can be as simple as a baking 
dish filled with a forcemeat and baked until done. A more attractive terrine can be con￾structed by layering the forcemeat with garnishes to create a mosaic effect when sliced. 
A terrine can even be layered with different forcemeats—for example, a pink salmon 
mousseline layered with a white shrimp mousseline.
A thin layer of fat is used to line the terrine mold. Some chefs feel that the fatback 
keeps the terrine moist during cooking; most modern chefs do not agree but neverthe￾less use it for aesthetic purposes. Sliced fatback and caul fat are most commonly used 
for this purpose. Caul fat (Fr. crepine) is a web-like fatty membrane that surrounds the 
stomach and intestines of cattle, sheep and pigs. Caul fat is used to wrap terrines, sau￾sages and pâtés as well as other forcemeat products such as crépinettes. The membrane 
holds the meat together, and during cooking, the melting fat bastes the meat, adding 
moisture and flavor. Pork caul fat is generally preferred for these purposes. Using fat￾back or caul fat is essentially a form of barding (page 324) that does not require any 
tying, twine or toothpicks.

Procedure for Preparing Terrines
1 Prepare the desired forcemeat and garnishes and refrigerate until needed.
2 Line a mold with thin slices of fatback, blanched leafy vegetables or other appropriate liner. 
the lining should overlap slightly, completely covering the inside of the mold and extending 
over the edge of the mold by approximately 1 inch (2.5 centimeters). alternatively line the 
mold with plastic wrap.
3 Fill the terrine with the forcemeat and garnishes, being careful not to leave air pockets. tap 
the mold several times on a solid work surface to remove any air pockets. (if lining the mold 
with fatback, garnish the top of the terrine with the herbs used in the preparation of the 
forcemeat if desired.)
4 Fold the liner or plastic wrap over the forcemeat and, if necessary, use additional pieces to 
completely cover its surface.
5 Cover the terrine with its lid or aluminum foil and bake in a water bath in a 350°F (180°C) 
oven. regulate the oven temperature so that the water stays between 170°F and 180°F 
(77°C and 82°C).
6 Cook the terrine to an internal temperature of 140°F (60°C) for fish-based forcemeats, 
150°F (66°C) for meat-based forcemeats or 160°F (71°C) for poultry-based forcemeats. 
Carryover cooking will bring the temperature to 145°F (63°C), 155°F (68°C) or 165°F 
(74°C) respectively, as required for food safety.
7 remove the terrine from the oven and allow it to cool slightly. if desired, pour off any fat 
and liquid from around the terrine. allow the terrine to cool, then cover it with cool liquid

➍ Slice the finished terrine.
Types of Terrines
Terrines include liver (and foie gras) terrines, vegetable terrines, brawns, also known as 
aspic terrines, mousses, rillettes and confits. Several types of terrines are not made from 
traditional forcemeats; many others are not made from forcemeats at all. But all are none￾theless called terrines because they are molded or cooked in a mold called a terrine. In 
the following material, we describe each of these in detail.
Liver terrines are popular and easy to make. Puréed poultry, pork or veal livers 
are mixed with eggs and a panada of cream and flour, then baked in a fatback-lined 
terrine. Although most livers purée easily in a food processor, a smoother finished 
product is achieved by forcing livers through a drum sieve after or in lieu of puréeing 
them in the processor.
M28_LABE1163_07_SE_C28.indd 871 31/10/23 9:01 PM872 ChaPter tWeNtY-eiGht
Foie gras terrines are made with the fattened goose or duck livers called foie gras. 
Foie gras is unique in that it consists almost entirely of fat. (See Chapter 18, Poultry.) Foie 
gras requires special attention during cooking; if it is cooked improperly or too long, it 
turns into a puddle of very expensive fat.
Vegetable terrines have a relatively low fat content and stunning visual appeal. 
Beautiful vegetable terrines are made by lining a terrine with a blanched leafy vegetable 
such as spinach, then alternating layers of two or three separately prepared vegetable 
fillings in contrasting colors and flavors. A different style of vegetable terrine is made 
by suspending brightly colored vegetables in a mousseline forcemeat to create a mosaic 
pattern when sliced.
Brawns or aspic terrines are made by simmering gelatinous cuts of meat (most nota￾bly, pigs’ feet and head, including the tongue) in a rich stock with wine and flavorings. 
The stock is enriched with the gelatin and flavor from the meat, creating an unclarified 
aspic jelly. The meat is pulled from the bone, diced and packed into the terrine mold. 
The stock is reduced to concentrate its gelatin content, strained through cheesecloth and 
poured over the meat in the terrine. After the terrine has set, it is removed from the mold 
and sliced for service. The finished product is a rustic and flavorful dish. Headcheese is a 
common example of an aspic terrine.
A mousse can be sweet or savory. Sweet mousses are described in Chapter 35, 
Custards, Creams, Frozen Desserts and Dessert Sauces. A savory mousse—which is not 
the same as a mousseline forcemeat—is made from fully cooked meats, poultry, game, 
fish, shellfish or vegetables that are puréed and combined with a béchamel or other 
appropriate sauce, bound with gelatin and lightened with whipped cream. A mousse 
can be molded in a decorated, aspic-jelly-coated mold such as the one described in the 
procedure that follows, or it can be formed in a mold lined with plastic wrap, which 
is peeled off after the mousse is unmolded. Mousse can be served as an individually 
molded portion; a larger molded mousse can be displayed on a buffet. (See Salmon 
Mousse, page 889.)
Rillettes and confits are types of preserved meats. Rillettes [ree-YEHT] are prepared 
by seasoning and slow-cooking pork or fatty poultry such as duck or goose in generous 
amounts of their own fat until the meat falls off the bone. The warm meat is mashed and 
combined with a portion of the cooking fat. The mixture is then packed into a crock or 
terrine, and rendered fat is strained over the top to seal it. Rillettes are eaten cold as a 
spread accompanied by bread or toast. (See Pork Rillettes, page 887.)
Confit [kohn-FEE] is prepared in a similar manner as rillettes except that before cook￾ing, the meat or poultry is often lightly salt-cured to draw out some moisture. The con￾fit is then cooked until very tender but not falling apart. (See Duck Confit, page 495.) 
Confits are generally served hot. Like rillettes, confits can be preserved by sealing them 
with a layer of strained rendered fat. Properly prepared and sealed rillettes and confits 
will keep for several weeks under refrigeration.
Chopped chicken liver is prepared in a similar fashion to a rillette. Chopped 
chicken liver, however, does not have the keeping qualities of traditional rillettes or con￾fits because it is not normally sealed with rendered fat. It should be eaten within a day 
or two of its preparation. (See Chopped Chicken Liver, page 890.)
Preparing Molds With Aspic Jelly
When making a terrine, a mold can be lined with aspic jelly, then decorated and filled with 
cold mousse. The aspic-jelly-coated mousse is unmolded for an attractive presentation.

Procedure for Preparing Aspic-Jelly-Coated Chilled Mousses
➊ Set a metal mold in ice water and fill with 
cool liquid aspic jelly. Swirl the mold so the 
aspic jelly adheres to all sides. Pour out the 
excess. repeat as needed to achieve the desired 
thickness; ¼ inch (6 millimeters) or less is 
usually sufficient.
➋ Garnish the mold by dipping pieces of 
vegetable or other foods in the liquid aspic jelly 
and placing them carefully inside the aspic￾jelly-coated mold. the mold is then filled with a 
cold filling such as a mousse.
➌ refrigerate the mold until it is well chilled. 
unmold the aspic by dipping the mold in warm 
water, then inverting and tapping the mold on 
a plate.
➊ Cool the clarified aspic jelly by slowly 
stirring it over an ice bath.
Procedure for Glazing Pâté Slices with Aspic Jelly
Slices of chilled terrines, pâtés en croûte or galantines may be garnished and coated with aspic 
to preserve their color, prevent drying and create a more attractive presentation.
➋ Brush or spoon the aspic jelly over slices of 
chilled pâté arranged on a cooling rack. repeat 
until the coating reaches the desired thickness.
Pâtés en Croûte
Considered by some to be the pinnacle of the charcutier’s art, pâtés en croûte are force￾meats baked in a crust. The forcemeat can be country-style, basic or mousseline, but a 
basic forcemeat is most commonly used. Although pâtés en croûte can be baked without 
using a mold, a mold helps produce a more attractive finished product.
Making Pâté Dough
The crust surrounding a baked forcemeat must be durable enough to withstand the long 
baking process and hold in the juices produced as the pâté bakes. Unfortunately, the 
more durable crusts are tough and unpleasant to eat.
The goal when making pâté dough (Fr. pâte au pâté) is to achieve a balance so 
that the crust will hold the juices of the baking pâté and still be tender enough to be 
enjoyable. Some pâtés, especially more delicate ones, such as fish mousselines, can be 
wrapped in Brioche dough (page 994).

Assembling, Baking and Glazing Pâté en Croûte
After preparing a forcemeat and pastry dough, all that remains is to assemble and bake 
the pâté en croûte. The amount of pastry dough and forcemeat needed is determined 
by the size of the mold or pan chosen. Once the pâté is baked and cooled, aspic jelly 
is poured into holes in the dough to fill the space created when the pâté shrank during 
cooking. Slices of pâté can also be glazed with aspic for a more formal presentation.
Procedure for Assembling and Baking Pâtés en Croûte
1 Prepare the pâté dough and the forcemeat, keeping the forcemeat refrigerated until needed.
2 roll out the dough into a rectangular shape ⅛ inch (3 millimeters) thick.
3 using the pâté mold as a pattern, determine how much dough is needed to line its interior; 
allow enough dough along each side of the mold’s length to cover the top when folded over. 
Mark the dough. Cut the dough slightly larger than the marked lines. Cut a second rectangular 
piece of dough that is slightly larger than the top of the mold; it will be used as a lid.
4 Lightly butter the inside of the mold.
5 Lightly dust the large rectangle of dough with flour, fold it over and transfer it to the mold.
6 use your thumbs and a dough ball made from dough trimmings to form the dough neatly 
into the corners of the mold. this helps push the dough against the mold without tearing. 
Continue until the dough is of even thickness on all sides and in the corners.
7 trim the dough, leaving ¾ inch (2 centimeters) on the ends and enough dough to cover the 
top along the sides.
8 Place thin slices of fatback or ham inside the dough-lined mold, allowing ¾ inch (2 centimeters) 
extra around the top of the mold, or as directed in the recipe. this layer helps protect the dough 
from coming in contact with the moist forcemeat, which would make it soggy.
9 Fill the lined mold with the forcemeat to ½ inch (1.2 centimeters) below the top of the mold, 
pressing it well into the corners to avoid air pockets. Layer and garnish as appropriate.
10 Fold the fatback or ham over the top of the forcemeat, using additional pieces if necessary 
to cover its entire surface. Fold the dough over the fatback-covered forcemeat.
11 Brush the exposed surface of the dough with egg wash; carefully cap with the top piece of 
dough. Press any overlapping dough down inside the sides of the mold with a small spatula.
12 using round cutters, cut one or two small holes in the top to allow steam to escape during 
cooking. egg-wash the surface. Place a doughnut-shaped piece of dough around each of 
the holes. egg-wash any decorations.
13 Bake the pâté in a preheated 450°F (230°C) oven for 15 minutes. Cover the surface of the 
pâté with aluminum foil. reduce the heat to 350°F (180°C) and continue baking until the 
M28_LABE1163_07_SE_C28.indd 874 31/10/23 9:01 PMCharCuterie 875
internal temperature reaches 140°F (60°C) for fish-based forcemeats, 150°F (66°C) for 
meat-based forcemeats or 160°F (71°C) for poultry-based forcemeats. Carryover cooking 
will bring the temperature to 145°F (63°C), 155°F (68°C) or 165°F (74°C), respectively, 
as required for food safety.
14 allow the pâté to cool for at least 1 hour or overnight. using a funnel, pour cool liquid 
aspic jelly through the holes to fill the space created when the pâté shrank during cooking. 
allow the pâté en croûte to cool overnight before slicing.
Galantines
A classic galantine is a boned chicken stuffed with a chicken-based forcemeat so that it 
resembles its original shape after it is poached. Today galantines are still prepared from 
whole ducks or chickens, but they can also be made from game, veal, fish or shellfish. 
When appropriate, the forcemeat is stuffed in the bird’s skin, which has been removed 
in one piece, sometimes with flesh still attached. When the bird’s skin is not available, or 
in the case of fish and shellfish where there is no skin, the galantine is made by forming 
the forcemeat into a cylindrical shape and wrapping it in cheesecloth, or plastic wrap 
and foil, before poaching. Galantines are always served cold and are often displayed on 
buffets, sliced and glazed with aspic jelly.
A ballotine is similar to a galantine. It is made by removing the bones from a poultry 
leg, filling the cavity with an appropriate forcemeat and poaching or braising the leg with 
vegetables. Ballotines are often served hot with a sauce made from the cooking liquid.
➊ Cut the dough into a large rectangle. ➋ Press the dough into the mold with a 
floured dough ball made from trimmings.
➌ Place thin slices of fatback inside the 
dough-lined mold.
➍ Fill the lined mold with the forcemeat 
and garnish.
➎ Cap with the top piece of dough. ❻ Pour cool aspic jelly into the holes of the 
baked pâté through an aluminum foil chimney.
❼ Slices of the cooled pâté en croûte.

Procedure for Preparing a Poultry Galantine
➊ Butterfly the breasts and poultry tenderloins 
and cover the skin with a thin layer of meat.
➋ arrange the forcemeat and garnishes in a 
cylindrical shape across the center of the skin.
➌ use plastic wrap to tightly roll the galantine 
and form a tight cylinder.
➍ Wrap the galantine with heavy-duty 
aluminum foil.
1 Bone the chicken by cutting through the skin along the length of the backbone and 
then following the natural curvature of the carcass. Keep all the meat attached to the 
skin. remove the legs and wings by cutting through the joints when you reach them; 
leave the legs and wings attached to the skin. then cut off the wings. Bone the thighs 
and legs, leaving the skin and meat attached to the rest of the bird. trim the skin to 
form a large rectangle.
2 Prepare a forcemeat using the meat from the skinned bird or any other appropriate meat. 
reserve a portion of the meat as garnish if desired. Prepare any other garnishes. refrigerate 
the forcemeat and garnishes until needed.
3 Spread out the skin and meat on a cutting board with the skin side down and the flesh up. 
transfer the trimmed skin onto a sheet of plastic wrap or several layers of cheesecloth with 
the skin side down and the flesh up.
4 remove the chicken tenderloins and pull the tendon out of each. Butterfly the breasts and 
tenderloins and cover the entire skin with a thin layer of meat.
5 arrange the forcemeat and garnishes in a cylindrical shape across the center of the skin.
6 using the plastic or cheesecloth to assist the process, tightly roll the skin around the 
forcemeat and garnishes to form a tight cylinder.
7 tie the ends of the cheesecloth with butcher’s twine and secure the galantine at even 
intervals using strips of cheesecloth. if plastic wrap was used, wrap the galantine with 
heavy-duty aluminum foil.
8 Poach the galantine in water (or a full-flavored stock if wrapped in cheesecloth) to an 
internal temperature of 160°F (71°C). Carryover cooking will bring the temperature to 
165°F (74°C), as required for food safety.
9 Cool the galantine in its cooking liquid until it can be handled. remove the cheesecloth or 
plastic wrap and aluminum foil and rewrap the galantine in clean cheesecloth or plastic 
wrap. refrigerate overnight before decorating or slicing.
➎ Slice the finished product.

USING FORCEMEATS TO PREPARE SAUSAGES
Sausages are forcemeats stuffed into casings. For centuries sausages consisted of ground 
meat, usually pork, and seasonings. Today sausages are made not only from pork but 
also from game, beef, veal, poultry, fish, shellfish and even vegetables.
There are three main types of sausages:
1 Fresh sausages include breakfast sausage links and Italian sausages. They are 
made with fresh ingredients that have not been cured or smoked.
2 Smoked and cooked sausages are made with raw meat products treated with 
chemicals, usually the preservative sodium nitrite. Examples are kielbasa, bologna 
and hot dogs.
3 Dried or hard sausages are made with cured meats, then air-dried under 
controlled conditions. Dried sausages may or may not be smoked or cooked. 
Dried or hard sausages include saucisson sec, salami, pepperoni and soppressata.
Although chefs are increasingly interested in preparing and using these artisanal 
sausages, smoked and cooked sausages and dried or hard sausages are rarely prepared 
in typical food service operations. Rather, they are produced by specialty shops in 
facilities where sanitation is ensured. For the proper fermentation and preserving of 
dry-cured products, controlled temperatures under sanitary conditions are essential. A 
HACCP plan and a health code variance may be required to prepare dry-cured foods 
on site. Here we discuss the ingredients and procedures for preparing a variety of fresh 
sausages and the fundamentals of sausage-making that can be carried out in almost 
any kitchen.
Sausage Meats
Sausage meats are forcemeats with particular characteristics and flavorings. Both coarse 
Italian and lamb sausages, for example, are simply country-style forcemeats without liver 
and with different seasonings, stuffed into casings and formed into links. Hot dogs, brat￾wurst and other fine-textured sausages are also variations of basic forcemeats stuffed into 
casings and formed into links.
Sausage Casings
Although sausage mixtures can be cooked without casings, most sausages are stuffed 
into casings before cooking. Two types of sausage casings are commonly used in food 
service operations:
1 Natural casings are portions of hog, sheep or cattle intestines sold by 
the bundle (also called a hank). The diameters of casings are measured in 
millimeters, and they come in several sizes depending on the animal or portion 
of the intestine used. Sheep casings are considered the finest-quality small 
casings. Both hog and sheep casings are used to make hot dogs and many types 
of pork sausage. Beef casings are quite large and are used to make sausages 
such as ring bologna and Polish sausage. Most natural casings are purchased 
in salt packs. To rid them of salt and impurities, the casings must be carefully 
rinsed in warm water and allowed to soak in cool water for at least 1 hour or 
overnight before use.
2 Collagen casings are manufactured from collagen extracted from cattle 
hides. They are generally inferior to natural casings in taste and texture, but 
they do have advantages: Collagen casings do not require any washing or 
soaking before use, they have a long shelf life and they are uniform in size. 
Because of their texture, collagen casings are often used for smoked sausages 
and snack sticks.
saucisson sec [soh-see-SOhN seck] a hard, air￾dried French sausage seasoned with garlic and 
black pepper
pepperoni [peh-peh-rOh-nee] a hard, thin, 
air-dried sausage seasoned with red and black 
peppers
soppressata [soh-preh-Sah-tah] a hard, aged 
italian salami, sometimes coated with cracked 
peppercorns or herbs
andouille [an-DOO-ee] a very spicy smoked 
pork sausage, popular in Cajun cuisine
mortadella [mohr-tah-Deh-lah] an italian 
smoked sausage made with ground beef, pork 
and pork fat, flavored with coriander and 
white wine; it is air-dried and has a delicate 
flavor; also a large american bologna-type pork 
sausage studded with pork fat and garlic

Equipment for Making Sausages
Sausage-stuffing machines are a good idea for those who engage in large-scale sausage 
production. For smaller operations, all that is needed is a grinder with a sausage nozzle. 
Nozzles are available in several sizes to accommodate various casing sizes.
Procedure for Preparing Sausages
1 Prepare a forcemeat.
2 thoroughly chill all parts of the sausage stuffer that will come in contact with 
the forcemeat.
3 rinse and soak the casings if using natural ones. Cut the casings into 4- to 6-foot (1.2- to 
1.8-meter) lengths.
4 Put the sausage in the sausage stuffer.
5 Slide the entire casing over the nozzle of the sausage stuffer. tie the end in a knot and pierce 
with a skewer to prevent air pockets.
6 Support and guide the casing off the end of the nozzle as the sausage is extruded from the 
nozzle into the casing.
7 after all the sausage has been stuffed into the casing, twist or tie the sausage into uniform 
links of the desired size.

 SALT CURING, BRINING AND SMOKING MEATS 
AND FISH
Curing, brining and smoking are ancient techniques for preserving food. Today foods 
such as hams, corned beef and smoked salmon are salt-cured, brined or smoked for 
flavor and to extend their shelf life. Cured meats have a characteristic pink color caused 
by the reaction between the curing salts, which are added during processing, and the 
naturally occurring myoglobin protein in the meat. Many cured and smoked meats and 
fish are used in sandwiches and salads. Sliced ham and pastrami are common sandwich 
options, but smoked chicken, duck and turkey are equally delicious alternatives.
Salt Curing
Salt curing is the process of surrounding a food with salt or a mixture of salt, sugar, 
nitrite-based curing salt, herbs and spices. Salt curing dehydrates the food by drawing 
out moisture, inhibits bacterial growth and adds flavor. It is most often used with pork 
products and fish. Salt curing as a preservation method is not a quick procedure—and 
the time involved adds money to production costs. For example, country-style hams are 
salt-cured. Proper curing requires approximately one and a half days per pound of ham, 
which means three weeks for the average ham.
Some salt-cured hams such as Smithfield and prosciutto are not actually cooked. The 
curing process preserves the meat and makes it safe to consume raw. Gravlax (see page 892) 
is a well-known salmon dish prepared by salt-curing salmon fillets with a mixture of salt, 
sugar, pepper and other seasonings.
Brining
A brine is a very salty marinade. Most brines have approximately 20 percent salinity, 
which is equivalent to 13 ounces (390 grams) of salt per half gallon (1.9 liters) of water. 
(See Chapter 9, Mise en Place.) Like dry-salt cures, brines can also include sugar, nitrites, 
herbs and spices. Brining is sometimes called pickling.
Today most cured meats are prepared in large production facilities where the brine 
is injected into the meat for rapid and uniform distribution. Commercially brined corned 
beef is cured by this process, as are most common hams. After brining, hams are further 
processed by smoking.
Smoking
Smoking preserves flavors and protects foods for longer storage. (Note that the FDA’s 
2022 Food Code requires that any establishment using smoking as a method of pre￾serving food must first obtain written authorization from their local health department.) 
There are two types of smoking: cold and hot. Cold smoking dries and flavors foods 
at low temperatures. Cold-smoked foods usually require additional cooking before they 
can be eaten. Hot smoking cooks foods at higher temperatures in an enclosed oven for 
a long period of time. Hot-smoked foods are fully cooked during this process and do not 
require additional cooking before eating.
Cold smoking is the process of exposing foods to smoke at temperatures between 
40°F and 85°F (4°C and 29°C). Cold smoking at the lowest temperature of 40°F (4°C) 
promotes food safety because it is below the temperature danger zone. Meat, poultry, 
game, fish, shellfish, cheese, nuts and even vegetables can be cold-smoked successfully. 
Cold-smoked foods are actually still raw. Some, such as smoked salmon (lox), are eaten 
without further cooking. Most, such as bacon and hams, must be cooked before eating.
Hot smoking is the process of exposing foods to smoke at temperatures between 
160°F and 185°F (71°C and 85°C). As with cold smoking, a great variety of foods can be 
prepared by hot smoking including meats, poultry, game, fish and shellfish. Although 
most hot-smoked foods are fully cooked when removed from the smoker, some such as 
bacon are used in other recipes that call for further cooking.
M28_LABE1163_07_SE_C28.indd 880 31/10/23 9:01 PMCharCuterie 881
 Select fresh, unblemished food of the highest quality to smoke. If frozen products 
are being smoked, properly thaw them under refrigeration before smoking. All foods 
to be smoked should be salt cured or brined first under refrigeration. Salt curing and 
brining adds flavor, allows the nitrites (which give the ham, bacon and other smoked 
meats their distinctive pink color) to penetrate the flesh and, most important, extracts 
moisture from the food, allowing the smoke to penetrate more easily. Before smok￾ing, wash the food to remove its cure or brine. Allow the food to dry until its surface 
develops a sticky skin called a pellicle . The pellicle protects the food from drying out 
during smoking. Compounds in the smoke stick to the surface or pellicle, flavoring and 
coloring it. 
 Smoking Temperatures 
 Smoke protects the surface of foods from bacteria or mold and gives foods a deep color. 
Properly smoked foods have a sweet, delicate smoke flavor from the properly com￾busted burning wood. Accurate temperature controls ensure food safety when smoking 
foods. For hot smoking, the temperature of the smoking chamber must be maintained 
in the proper range to ensure food safety. The temperature at which a food is smoked 
may be increased gradually to ensure that the food is well flavored and properly pasteur￾ized. Sausages, for example, may be smoked for an initial period at a lower temperature 
(125°F/51°C) to set the proteins in the meat, then at higher temperature (160°F/71°C) to 
cook the meat. 
 Temperatures above 185°F (85°C) are not recommended for hot smoking because 
higher heat causes foods to shrink and dry out. (Barbecue, a dry-heat cooking method 
that resembles hot smoking, is an exception to this general rule. It employs higher tem￾peratures to smoke and cook foods. See Chapter 13 , Principles of Meat Cookery. ) The 
food items must reach safe internal temperatures during hot smoking. For cold smoking, 
the temperature of the smoking chamber is maintained between 40°F (4°C) and 85°F 
(29°C). Foods are held at this temperature just long enough to absorb the desired smoky 
flavor. Recall that cold-smoked foods are cooked after smoking before they are served. 
 Smoking Equipment 
 Both cold and hot smoking occur in a smoker specifically designed for this purpose. 
Smokers can be wood-burning, gas or electric. Smokers vary greatly in size and opera￾tion, but they have several things in common: All smokers consist of a chamber that 
holds the food being smoked, a means of burning wood to produce smoke and a 
heating element. 
 Although smoking large quantities of foods requires specialized equipment, three 
affordable options exist for imparting a smoked flavor to small-batch food preparation. 
A stove-top smoker , which resembles a hotel pan with a tight-fitting lid, can be used 
to hot smoke small cuts of meat, fish, poultry or vegetables. Wood chips are scattered 
inside the bottom of the pan. Foods to be smoked sit on top of a mesh rack inside the 
box. The heat of the stove top ignites the wood chips, surrounding the food with flavor￾ful smoke. 
 The second option is to use a small electric smoke box placed inside a traditional 
oven. The box holds an electric heating coil surrounded by wood chips. The box lid has 
holes that can be adjusted to control the amount of smoke released into the oven cham￾ber. Foods being flavored with a smoke box can be cooked simultaneously by heat from 
the traditional oven. Foods smoked with either a stove top smoker or a smoke box must 
reach proper internal temperatures to be served without additional cooking. 
 A final option for imparting a smoky taste to foods is liquid smoke , a flavoring made 
from smoke, condensed from burning wood chips. When used judiciously, liquid smoke 
can impart a pleasant smoky taste to barbecue sauces and marinades. 
 Different types of wood can be used to smoke food. Specific woods are selected to 
impart specific flavors. Hickory is often used for pork products; alder is excellent for 
smoked salmon. Maple, chestnut, juniper, mesquite and many other woods are also 
used. Avoid resinous woods such as pine that give food a bitter flavor. 
 pellicle (Fr. pellicule ) a thin, sticky membrane 
or skin that forms on the surface of cured 
fish, meat or poultry exposed to air. it seals 
in moisture and helps smoke adhere to the 
product’s surface.

Procedure for Smoking Foods
1 Cut, trim and prepare the food for smoking. trim excess surface fat from large cuts of 
meat. tie up poultry into uniform shapes. Bone and trim fins from fish.
2 Brine or cure the item before smoking. For brine, immerse the food in a saltwater brine 
flavored with herbs, spices and other seasonings. For curing, coat the food with a dry 
mixture of salt and seasonings and refrigerate for the time required.
3 rinse off any brine or cure.
4 Dry the item before smoking using clean disposable towels. Place the item on a stainless 
steel rack and refrigerate uncovered until a pellicle forms. Larger items may be hung from 
racks that allow them to air dry and form a pellicle.
5 heat a smoker to the desired temperature. For hot smoking, gradually bring the food 
to temperatures between 160°F and 185°F (71°C and 85°C). Smoke the food until it 
reaches the desired internal temperature. For cold smoking, gradually bring the food to 
temperatures between 40°F and 85°F (4°C and 29°C). Doneness is determined by internal 
temperature or time and smoked flavor of the food.
6 Cool the food prior to storing under refrigeration.

1 trim fins and rough edges from the trout fillets.
2 to make the dry cure, combine the salt, sugar, coriander, black and cayenne peppers and allspice 
in a small bowl.
3 Coat the trout fillets with the dry cure and lemon zest. Place the fillets on a paper-lined sheet pan 
and refrigerate uncovered. allow the fish to cure until it is noticeably firm to the touch with some 
spring, approximately 2½–4 hours depending on the thickness of the fillets.
4 rinse and dry each fillet well. Place the fillets on a lightly oiled rack set over a sheet tray. refrigerate 
the fillets, uncovered, and allow them to air dry until the pellicle forms, approximately 8 hours 
or overnight.
5 Soak approximately 1 cup (240 milliliters) of wood chips in water for 15 minutes. Prepare a 
stovetop smoker or select a hotel pan with a tight-fitting lid. Place the smoker over two burners set 
on low heat. Scatter the wood chips in the bottom of the pan. (if using a hotel pan, place a perfo￾rated insert into the pan.) Place the rack of trout fillets in the smoker. as soon as smoke appears, 
cover tightly.
6 hot smoke the trout at 185°F (85°C) until the flesh is firm and an internal temperature of 145°F 
(63°C) is reached, approximately 8–14 minutes. hold the trout in the smoker for 30 minutes 
in total.
7 Chill the trout before serving.

CURED PORK AND BEEF PRODUCTS
Preparing hams and curing pork and beef products are traditional parts of charcuterie. 
In the following section we describe some of the more common cured pork and beef 
products available to chefs.
American-style bacon is produced by brining and cold-smoking 
trimmed pork belly. This fatty cut of pork absorbs flavors well during the 
smoking process. Bacon is sold in slab or sliced form. Sliced bacon is 
sold by count (number of slices) per pound; thick-sliced bacon runs 
10–14 slices per pound, whereas thin-sliced bacon may contain as 
many as 28–32 slices per pound.
Canadian bacon is produced from a boneless pork loin, 
trimmed so that only a thin layer of fat remains on its surface. It 
is then brined and smoked.
Pancetta [pan-CHEH-tuh] is an Italian pork-belly bacon 
that is not smoked. It is salt-cured, peppered and often rolled 
into a cylinder shape. It can be sliced into rounds and fried; it 
is diced, rendered and combined with sauce to make pasta 
carbonara.
A fresh ham is a hog’s hind leg; it is a primal cut. Many 
processed products produced from the primal fresh ham 
are also called ham.
Ham, in the United States, describes a variety of pro￾cessed pork products, most of which come from the 
primal fresh ham. Boneless hams, which are also called 
formed hams, are produced by separating a primal ham 
into its basic muscles, defatting the meat, curing it, stuffing 
the meat into casings of various sizes and shapes and cook￾ing it. Boneless or formed hams either are smoked or have 
chemical smoke flavoring added during the curing process.

shank, cured and smoked
M28_LABE1163_07_SE_C28.indd 883 31/10/23 9:02 PM884 ChaPter tWeNtY-eiGht
The quality of boneless or formed hams varies greatly. The best hams are formed from 
only one or two large muscles and have low fat content and no added water other than 
that used during the curing process. Hams of lesser quality are formed from many small 
pieces of muscle and have a higher fat and water content. Many boneless or formed 
hams are listed in The Meat Buyer’s Guide and are indexed by the IMPS system. Bone-in 
and boneless hams are also sliced horizontally into individual ham steaks that can be 
sautéed or pan-fried.
Country ham is a specialty of the southeastern United States. Country hams are 
 dry-cured, smoked and hung to air-dry for a period ranging from several weeks to more 
than a year. During drying, a mold develops on the ham rind that must be scrubbed 
off before the ham is cooked. A country ham is best cooked by first soaking, then 
slow simmering. The most famous country hams are Virginia hams; those from 
Smithfield, Virginia, are considered the finest. Only hams produced in rural 
areas can be called country hams; others must be labeled country-style 
ham.
Prosciutto [proh-SHOO-toe] is the Italian word for ham. What we call 
prosciutto in the United States is called Parma in Italy. Parma ham, pro￾duced near that Italian city, is made from hogs fed on the whey of cheese 
processed nearby. The meat is salt-cured and air-dried but not smoked. The 
curing process makes it safe to consume raw. Several domestic varieties of 
prosciutto are produced in the United States, varying widely in quality. Imported 
prosciuttos are much larger than the domestic varieties because Italian hogs are larger.
Jamón [AH-mohn] is the Spanish word for ham. Jamón Serrano (mountain ham) 
is salt-cured and air-dried but not smoked. Jamón Iberico is a salted, dry-cured ham 
from specific breeds of hogs, a Spanish delicacy prized since Roman times. The most 
esteemed Jamón Iberico is made from the Bellota breed that feed on foraged acorns. Like 
prosciutto, these hams are served raw, thinly sliced.
Westphalian ham is dry-cured, brined and then smoked with beechwood. Authentic 
Westphalian hams are produced in the Westphalia region of Germany and are quite 
similar to prosciutto. They are sold bone-in or boneless. Their characteristic flavor is 
derived from the juniper berries used in the curing process and the beechwood used 
for smoking.
Although pork is the most common meat in classic char￾cuterie, other meats and poultry lend themselves to these 
preservation techniques. Beef is used to make pastrami, 
pickled beef brisket that is spiced and then air-dried. 
Pastrami is steamed, then sliced for sandwiches. 
Jerky is a type of dry, salted meat usually 
made from thin strips of lean beef. The strips 
are marinated in a seasoned rub, then dried 
but not smoked, with low heat. Restaurants can 
easily make jerky in house with trim from meat 
fabrication. Jerky is typically a snack food that 
needs no further preparation and can be stored 
for months at room temperature. Bresaola, 
a specialty of the Lombardy region of Italy, is 
salted, spiced and dry-aged beef, served raw 
and thinly sliced. It is made from the eye round 
of beef and has a subtle flavor of juniper berries. The 
similar specialty of the Swiss Alps is known as bunder￾fleisch. Few cured lamb products exist, possibly 
because of the strong flavor of lamb fat when aged.

Gravlax
Gravlax is a centuries-old Scandinavian method for preserving fresh salmon. The modern technique 
consists of rubbing a salt-and-sugar mixture into the cut fillets of salmon. The rub extracts moisture 
from the fish, which firms the flesh and extends its keeping properties. As liquid is extracted, the 
gentle flavors of white pepper and dill permeate the fish. (Although white pepper and dill are the 
classic seasonings for gravlax, other herbs and spices can be used. Adding grated lemon rind to the rub 
imparts a citrus note, for example.) Paper-thin slices of gravlax are usually served with a slightly sweet 
mayonnaise flavored with mustard and dill.

hors d’oeuvre 
29. 2 prepare and serve a variety of hot 
hors d’oeuvre 
29. 3 identify and describe antipasti, mezze, 
tapas and zakuski 
29. 4 explain and apply appropriate ways to 
serve hors d’oeuvre 
Hors d’oeuvre are very small portions of foods served to whet the appetite before 
a meal. Hors d’oeuvre, whether hot or cold, are usually passed by servers or dis￾played on buffets and should be no larger than one or two bites each. elegant and 
flavorful, hors d’oeuvre are meant to delight and set the tone for the meal to come. The term 
hors d’oeuvre is often used interchangeably with the term appetizers , which can lead to some 
confusion. Appetizers, also referred to as starters, are generally the first course or introduc￾tion to a seated meal; they are more typically served with dinner than with lunch. Appetizers 
are listed on printed menus in most full-service restaurants. 
 In this chapter we discuss the preparation of many types of hot and cold hors d’oeuvre 
and finger foods and how to present and serve them. Appetizers are discussed throughout 
this book. A section on small plates that are often served before a meal or as a collective 
meal in themselves appears in Chapter 36 , Plate Presentation.
 The French term hors d’oeuvre translates as “outside the work.” This usage made 
sense under the classic kitchen brigade system, for it was the service staff’s responsi￾bility to prepare small tidbits for guests to enjoy while the kitchen prepared the meal. 
Today, however, the kitchen staff prepares the hors d’oeuvre as well as the meals. Cold 
hors d’oeuvre are usually prepared by the garde manger; hot ones are prepared in the 
main kitchen. 
 Preparing hors d’oeuvre involves a wide range of skills. Because they can consist of 
meat, poultry, fish, shellfish, vegetables, potatoes, grains, pasta, fruits, baked goods or 
sauces, hors d’oeuvre preparation requires a detailed knowledge of almost every work 
station. There are really only two limitations on the type of food and manner of prepara￾tion that can be used for hors d’oeuvre: the chef’s imagination and the available foods. 
There are, however, a few guidelines, including the following: 
▪ They should be small, only one to two bites each. 
▪ They should be flavorful and well-seasoned without being overpowering. 
▪ They should be visually attractive. 
▪ They should complement whatever foods may follow without duplicating their flavors. 
 COLD HORS D’OEUVRE 
 In this chapter, we divide cold hors d’oeuvre into four broad categories based on prepara￾tion method, principal ingredient or presentation style. Those four categories are canapés, 
crudités, dips and caviar. These categories may vary somewhat from classical teachings, 
but they are completely appropriate for modern menus and food service operations. 
 Canapés 
 Classic canapés are tiny open-faced sandwiches, ideally no more than 1–2 inches (2.5–5 
centimeters) in diameter. They are constructed from a base, a spread and one or more 
garnishes. Many modern interpretations exist, such as those in which toasted, sautéed or 
dried slices of French or Italian-style bread contain the garnish. 
 The most common canapé base is a thin slice of bread cut into an interesting shape and 
toasted. Almost any variety of bread can be used; however, spiced, herbed or otherwise 
flavored breads may be inappropriate for some spreads or garnishes. Melba toasts, plain 
and seeded crackers and slices of firm raw vegetables, such as cucumbers or zucchini, 
are also popular canapé bases. Whatever item is used, the base must be strong enough to 
support the weight of the spread and garnish without falling apart when handled.

from top left): pimento cheese canapés, pea and 
prosciutto canapé and sautéed mushroom canapé
The canapé spread provides much of the canapé’s flavor. Spreads are usually 
flavored butters, cream cheese or a combination of the two. Table 29.1 lists several 
examples of spreads. Each spread is made by adding the desired amount of the main 
 ingredient (chopped or puréed as appropriate) and seasonings to softened butter or 
cream cheese and mixing until combined. Quantities and proportions vary according to 
individual tastes. Other canapé spreads include bound salads (e.g., tuna or egg), finely 
chopped shrimp, liver mousse, ricotta cheese, bean or olive purée or flavored mayon￾naise. Any of a number of ingredients can be combined for spreads.
General guidelines for preparing canapé spreads include the following:
	▪ The spread’s texture should be smooth enough to produce attractive designs 
when piped through a pastry bag fitted with a decorative tip.
	▪ The spread’s consistency should be firm enough so that the spread holds its 
shape when piped or spread onto the base, yet soft enough to stick to the base 
and hold the garnishes in place.
	▪ The spread’s flavor should complement the garnishes and be flavorful enough to 
stimulate the appetite without being overpowering.
A spread may be a substantial portion of the canapé as well as its distinguishing char￾acteristic. Or a spread can be applied sparingly and used more as a means of gluing the 
garnish to the base than as a principal ingredient. In the latter case, a smooth texture is 
not essential.
Canapés with bread bases tend to become soggy quickly from both the moisture in 
the spread and the moisture in the refrigerator where they are stored. A spread made 
with butter keeps the bread bases crisper, as does buttering the base with a thin coat of 
softened plain butter before piping on the spread. However the best way to ensure a 
crisp base is to make the canapés as close to service time as possible.
A canapé garnish can dominate or complement the spread, or it can be a simple sprig 
of parsley intended to provide visual appeal but little flavor. Although several ingredi￾ents can be used to garnish the same canapé, remember the limitations imposed by the 
canapé’s size and purpose. Also consider the time involved in preparing and garnishing 
them. Traditional garnishes can be made by shaping thinly sliced smoked salmon into 
rosettes, or thin slices of salami or cucumber into cornets, into which additional spread 
can be piped. The natural shape of a boiled, peeled shrimp also makes an attractive 
canapé garnish.

Procedure for Preparing Canapés
➊ Cut bread slices into the desired shapes. ➋ Apply the spread to the base with a 
palette knife.
This procedure can be adapted and used with a variety of ingredients to produce a variety of 
canapés. If the canapé base is made from bread, begin with step 1. If some other product is used 
as the base, prepare that base and begin with step 4.
1 Trim the crust from an unsliced loaf of bread. slice the bread lengthwise, approximately 
⅓ inch (8 millimeters) thick.
2 Cut the bread slices into the desired shapes using a serrated bread knife or canapé cutter. 
(see Figure 29.1.)
3 Brush the bread shapes with melted butter or olive oil and bake in a 350°F (180°C) oven 
until they are toasted and dry. remove and cool. Alternatively the entire bread slice can be 
buttered and toasted, then cut into shapes.
4 If desired, spread each base with a thin layer of softened plain butter.
5 Apply the spread to the base. If a thin layer is desired, use a palette knife. If a thicker or 
more decorative layer is desired, pipe the spread onto the base using a pastry bag and 
decorative tip. Alternatively the entire bread slice can be buttered, toasted, cooled, covered 
with a spread and then cut into the desired shapes.
6 Garnish the canapé as desired.
7 If desired, glaze each canapé with a thin coating of aspic jelly. The aspic jelly can be applied 
with a small spoon or a spray bottle designated for that purpose.
➌ Pipe the spread onto the base.
➍ Alternatively cover the entire slice of toasted 
bread with a spread before cutting it into canapés.
➎ Garnish the canapés. ❻ If desired, spray the finished canapés 
with aspic.

left): steamed mussel, cream-cheese-filled 
endive and pico de gallo tartlet
Barquettes, Tartlets and Profiteroles
Barquettes, tartlets and profiteroles are all adaptations of the basic canapé. A barquette
is a tiny boat-shaped shell made from a savory dough such as pâte brisée. A tartlet is 
a round version of a barquette. A profiterole is a small puff made from Éclair Paste 
(page 1022). Prepare barquettes, tartlets and profiteroles like canapés by filling them 
with flavored spreads and garnishing as desired.
Other Types of Canapés
Vegetables such as cherry tomatoes, blanched snow peas, mush￾room caps, small sweet peppers and Belgian endive leaves 
are sometimes used as canapé bases. Thickly sliced rounds 
of cucumber or hollowed-out small potatoes can also be 
used as containers for canapés, as can hard-cooked eggs 
or mussel shells. These canapé bases are filled and gar￾nished in the same manner as barquettes, tartlets 
and profiteroles. Bruschette (sing. bruschetta) 
and crostini (sing. crostino) are slices of coun￾try bread that are grilled, brushed with garlic 
and olive oil and then garnished with diced 
tomatoes or other toppings. These Italian-style 
canapés are versatile and easy to prepare. 
Because they are hearty and rustic in appear￾ance, bruschette and crostini are well suited to 
informal settings and occasions.
Crudités
Crudité, a French word meaning “raw thing,” generally refers to raw or slightly blanched 
vegetables served as an hors d’oeuvre. Although almost any vegetable can be a crudité, 
the most common are asparagus, broccoli, carrots, cauliflower, celery and green beans, 
all of which are typically blanched, and cherry tomatoes, cucumbers, Belgian endive 
leaves, jicama, mushrooms, peppers, green onions, radishes, yellow squash, snow peas 
and zucchini, which are served raw.
When preparing crudités, use only the freshest and best-looking produce available. 
Because they are displayed and eaten raw, vegetables must be free from blemishes and 
imperfections. Vegetables, both blanched and raw, should be cut into attractive shapes. 
Crudités are usually served with one or more dips in a large display or in individual 
serving glasses.

Amuse-Bouche
Amuse-bouche, “mouth pleaser” in 
French, are small samples of food served 
in restaurants before a meal. Many chefs 
create these one-bite dishes as a gesture 
of hospitality and an expression of their 
creativity. unlike appetizers, these hors 
d’oeuvre are chosen by the chef and 
offered free of charge. Amuse-bouche may 
be simple or elaborate, made from luxury 
ingredients, such as caviar, or seasonal 
ingredients in limited supply.

Dips
Dips are a type of thick sauce served with crudités, crackers, chips, toasts, breads or 
other foods. Dips, which may be cold or hot, must be viscous (thick and sticky) enough 
to cling to foods dipped in them.
Cold dips often use mayonnaise, sour cream, cream cheese or yogurt as a 
base. These dips are prepared using the methods for preparing mayonnaise-based 
salad dressings discussed in Chapter 24, Salads and Salad Dressings. The principal 
difference between dressings and dips is that dips are normally thicker. Soft spread￾able cheese such as cream cheese and fromage blanc make flavorful dips. To use 
spreadable cheese as a dip, first soften it by mixing it in an electric mixer fitted with 
a paddle. Then add the flavoring ingredients such as chopped cooked vegetables, 
chopped cooked fish or shellfish, herbs, spices, garlic or onions. Adjust the consis￾tency of the dip by adding milk, buttermilk, cream, sour cream, lemon juice or other 
appropriate liquid.
Some cold dips such as Guacamole (page 911), Hummus (page 898) and Spanish-Style 
Romesco Sauce (page 277) use purées of fruits, vegetables, beans or nuts as the base for 
the dip. Hot dips often use a béchamel, cream sauce or cheese sauce as the foundation 
and usually contain a dominant flavoring ingredient such as chopped spinach or shellfish.
Dips can be served in small bowls or hollowed-out cabbages, squash, pumpkins or 
other vegetables. Hot dips are often served in chafing dishes so that they stay warm. The 
combinations of ingredients and seasonings that can be used to make dips as well as the 
foods that are dipped in them are limited only by the chef’s imagination.

American paddlefish caviar
osetra caviar
Caviar
Caviar, the salted roe (eggs) of the sturgeon fish, is a classic hors d’oeuvre and a symbol 
of refined dining. Caviar is served alone with toast or as an elegant garnish on canapés 
and other foods.
In the United States, only sturgeon roe can be labeled simply “caviar.” Roe from other 
fish must be identified as such on the label (e.g., salmon roe or lumpfish caviar). Much of 
the world’s caviar once came from sturgeon harvested in the Caspian Sea and imported from 
Russia and Iran. True caviar is classified according to the sturgeon species (such as beluga, 
osetra or sevruga) and roe size and color. Beluga is the most expensive caviar and comes 
from the largest species (these sturgeon can weigh up to 1750 pounds/800 
kilograms). Beluga’s dark gray eggs are the largest and most fragile 
variety of caviar. Because wild Caspian and Black Sea sturgeon are 
severely endangered due to overfishing, caviar from these waters is 
banned in the United States. Osetra eggs are m edium-sized, golden 
yellow to brown and quite oily. Sevruga caviar is harvested from 
small sturgeon; the eggs are small and light to dark gray.
Most of the caviar consumed in the world comes from farmed 
sturgeon produced in China, Russia, Europe and the United States 
or from another fish, as identified on the label. Roe from American 
sturgeon, harvested in the coastal waters of the American Northwest 
and the Tennessee River as well as from fish farms in California, is popu￾lar as its quality is comparable to Caspian Sea varieties. Golden whitefish 
caviar is a small and very crisp roe; it is a natural golden color and comes from 
whitefish in the northern Great Lakes. American paddlefish caviar is large 
steel-grey roe from the paddlefish or spoonbill. Its flavor is similar to sevruga—
earthy, buttery and rich with a soft texture. Lumpfish caviar is widely available 
and inexpensive. The eggs are small and very crisp and are dyed black, red or 
gold. This food coloring is not stable, however, and the color tends to bleed. 
Salmon caviar, which is the eggs of chum or silver salmon, is a popular gar￾nish. The eggs are large with a good flavor and natural orange color.
Purchasing and Storing Caviar
Although all caviar is processed with salt, some caviar is labeled malassol, which means 
“little salt.” Caviar should smell fresh, with no off odors. The eggs should be whole, not 
broken, and they should be crisp and pop when eaten. Excessive oiliness may be caused 
by broken eggs. The best way to test caviar’s quality is to taste it.
Most caviar can be purchased fresh or pasteurized in tins or jars ranging from 
1 ounce (28 grams) to more than 4 pounds (1.8 kilograms). Some caviars are also available 
frozen, but these are only suitable for use as a garnish. To ensure the freshest possible 
product, purchase caviar frequently in small quantities based on short-term needs.
Store fresh caviar at 32°F (0°C). Because most refrigerators are warmer than that, 
place the caviar on ice in the coldest part of the refrigerator and change the ice often. If 
properly handled, fresh caviar will last 1–2 weeks before opening and several days after 
opening. Pasteurized caviar does not require refrigeration until it is opened and will last 
several days in the refrigerator after opening.
Serving Caviar
Fine caviar should be served in its original container or a nonmetal bowl on a bed of 
crushed ice, accompanied only by lightly buttered toasts or blinis and sour cream. (See 
Buckwheat Blini, page 908.) Always use nonmetal utensils for service; metal reacts with 
the caviar, producing off-flavors. Tiny caviar spoons made from mother of pearl, natural 
bone or glass are preferred.
Lesser-quality caviars may be served on ice, accompanied by minced onion, chopped 
hard-cooked egg whites and yolks, lemon wedges, sour cream and buttered toasts from 
which guests build their own canapés. One serving is approximately ½ teaspoon (2 milliliters); 
a 2-ounce (60-gram) jar provides enough for canapés to serve 8 people. Lumpfish and

other nonsturgeon caviars are rarely served by themselves. Rather they are used as ingre￾dients in or garnishes for other dishes. Caviar can be mixed into softened butter or cream 
cheese for a spread or scrambled into eggs and is an appropriate garnish for many fish 
or shellfish presentations. Even a tiny amount of roe used as a carefully placed garnish 
can increase a dish’s perceived value.
Other Cold Hors d’Oeuvre
Salted nuts, cured olives, cornichons or other pickled vegetables are often served as 
cold hors d’oeuvre. These savory tidbits enhance other items such as platters of cubed 
cheese, sliced cured or preserved meats and grilled vegetables. Due to the popularity 
of sushi and sashimi, raw fish dishes are common on hors d’oeuvre menus. Raw fish 
preparations such as Seviche (page 918) can be made ahead and served in small glasses 
or serving spoons.
HOT HORS D’OEUVRE
To provide a comprehensive list of hot hors d’oeuvre would be virtually impossible. 
Therefore in this chapter, we discuss just a few of the more commonly encountered ones 
that can be easily made in almost any kitchen.
Filled Pastry Shells
Because savory (unsweetened) barquettes and tartlets, éclair puffs and bouchées can 
hold a small amount of liquid, they are often baked and then filled with warm meat, 
poultry or fish purées or ragoûts, garnished and served hot. They become soggy quickly, 
however, and must be prepared at the last possible minute before service.
Skewers
Small skewers of meat, poultry, game, fish, shellfish or vegetables make ideal hot hors 
d’oeuvre. The foods are typically marinated, then baked, grilled or broiled, and served 
with a dipping sauce. These skewers, also called brochettes, can hold small pieces of 
boneless chicken breast marinated in white wine and grilled, beef cubes glazed with 
teriyaki sauce, alternating strips of red and green peppers or lamb or chicken satay (saté) 
with peanut sauce.
To increase visual appeal, the main ingredients should be carefully cut and consistent 
in size and shape. The ingredients are normally diced, but strips of meat, poultry and 
vegetables can also be threaded onto the skewers.
As hors d’oeuvre, the skewers should be very small, slightly larger than a toothpick. 
When assembling, leave enough exposed skewer so that diners can pick them up easily. 
Bamboo and wooden skewers have a tendency to burn during cooking. Soaking them in 
water before assembling helps reduce the risk of burning.

Meatballs
Meatballs made from ground beef, veal, pork or poultry and served in a sauce buffet 
style are a popular hot hors d’oeuvre. Any meatball recipe is suitable for use as an hors 
d’oeuvre as long as the meatballs are small enough to be eaten in one bite. (See It alian￾Style Country Meatballs, page 368.) One of the best known is the Swedish meatball, 
made from ground beef, veal and pork bound with eggs and bread crumbs and served 
in a velouté or cream sauce seasoned with dill. Other sauces that go well with meatballs 
include mushroom sauce, red wine sauce or any style of tomato sauce.

Hors d’Oeuvre Wrapped in Cheese, Meat or Vegetables
A slice of cheese, savory meat or roasted pepper wrapped around a complementary 
or contrasting slice of fruit or vegetable makes a flavorful hot hors d’oeuvre. Shrimp 
wrapped in bacon, asparagus spears in prosciutto or a cube of mozzarella in a slice of 
roasted red pepper are popular options. Choose a flavorful slice of meat, such as cured 
ham, bacon or salami, or cheese, such as fontina or gouda, as the wrapping. The hors 
d’oeuvre known as rumaki is a good example of an appealing flavor combination and 
technique. Traditionally rumaki were made by wrapping chicken livers in bacon and 
broiling or baking them. Now many other foods prepared in the same fashion are also 
called rumaki. For example, blanched bacon can be wrapped around olives, pickled 
watermelon rind, water chestnuts, pineapple, dates or scallops. These morsels are then 
broiled, baked or fried and served piping hot.

Hors d’Oeuvre Wrapped in Dough
Any number of doughs including savory pie dough or Puff Pastry (page 1019) can serve as 
the base of numerous hot hors d’oeuvre. These doughs can be stuffed with a wide variety 
of pork, chicken, fish or vegetable stuffings before baking or deep-frying. Prepared doughs 
such as phyllo dough or wonton skins simplify the preparation of filled hors d’oeuvre.
 Phyllo Dough
Phyllo [FEE-low], also spelled filo or fillo, is from the Greek phyllon, meaning “thin sheet 
or leaf.” Although its name is Greek, the dough’s origin is unknown. Indians, Turks, 
Syrians, Yugoslavs and Austrians all claim it as their own. Blandly flavored phyllo sheets 
are brushed with melted butter or oil, stacked and then used in Mediterranean, Middle 
Eastern and Central Asian dishes as a tart crust or a wrapper for various sweet or savory 
fillings. Phyllo dough is also used for strudels and various hors d’oeuvre. Shredded phyllo 
dough, called kataifi, is used in some Mediterranean and Middle Eastern specialties.
Phyllo dough is made from flour, water, a bit of oil and eggs. The dough is stretched 
tissue-paper thin, using techniques that can take years to master. Fortunately excel￾lent commercially prepared phyllo dough is available in frozen sheets. Sheets of phyllo 
dough can stick together if thawed too quickly, so thaw frozen dough slowly for a day

or so in the refrigerator. Then temper the package of dough at room temperature for at 
least 1 hour before opening. (Unused phyllo dough should not be refrozen; it will keep 
for several days in the refrigerator if tightly wrapped.)
When the phyllo dough is ready to use, open the package and unfold the stack of 
sheets. Place them flat on a sheet pan or work surface and cover with a piece of plastic 
wrap topped with a damp towel. Remove one sheet at a time from the stack, keeping 
the remainder well covered to prevent them from drying out. Brush melted butter or oil 
over the sheet’s entire surface. Chopped nuts, sugar, cocoa powder or bread crumbs can 
be dusted over the butter or oil for additional flavor. Repeat with additional sheets until 
the desired number of layers have been prepared and stacked. The number of layers 
depends on the thickness of the sheets and their use. Cut the stacked phyllo sheets with 
scissors or a very sharp knife and use as directed in the recipe.

Wonton Skins
Wonton skins are an Asian noodle filled to produce egg rolls and dumplings (wontons) 
that are fried or served in broths. The dough is made from wheat flour bound with eggs 
and water and then rolled paper-thin. Wonton skins are ideal for making a wide variety 
of hors d’oeuvre, such as a miniature egg roll or a puff filled with a mixture of sea￾soned cream cheese and crab. The skins, which are commercially available in rounds or 
squares, can be stuffed with a wide variety of fillings before cooking. As hors d’oeuvre, 
stuffed wonton skins can be steamed, but they are more often pan-fried or deep-fried. 
(Wonton skins can also be baked and used as a canapé base, as shown in the recipe for 
Baked Wonton Crisps, page 908.)

Other Hot Hors d’Oeuvre
Other types of hot hors d’oeuvre include tiny red potatoes filled with sour cream and 
caviar or Roquefort cheese and walnuts; scaled-down taco shells filled with chili; slid￾ers or miniature hamburgers; or chicken wings that are seasoned or marinated, baked, 
fried, broiled or grilled and served with a cool and soothing or outrageously spicy sauce. 
The aroma and crisp texture of fried foods such as Salmon Croquettes (page 567) and 
Arancini (page 921) make them appealing hot hors d’oeuvre.
The secret is to use creativity, to keep the ingredients harmonious and, if the hors 
d’oeuvre are to precede a meal, not to duplicate or overpower the foods to be served. 
Mainstays of the menu are, however, another source for interesting hors d’oeuvre ideas. 
Miniature versions of main dishes such as a rich beef stew in a barquette, a cooked raviolo 
in tomato sauce or miniature crab cakes can add variety to an hors d’oeuvre assortment 
without taxing the kitchen staff.
ANTIPASTI, MEZZE, TAPAS AND ZAKUSKI
Many cultures have a tradition of serving finger foods and small dishes before a main 
meal. Antipasti, mezze, tapas and zakuski represent four such traditions.
In Italy, small bites of food served before a meal are called antipasti (sing. anti￾pasto), an Italian word that means “before the pasta course.” These savory foods are 
chosen to whet the appetite for the main meal rather than to sate hunger. An assortment 
of antipasti may include olives, salted anchovies, slices of dry-cured sausage and cured 
meats, Italian cheeses or pickled vegetables such as Giardiniera (page 687) served to the 
guests from a platter or in small bowls.
Mezze are small plates of assorted salads such as Hummus (page 898) and Baba 
Ghanoush (page 910) that are served with alcoholic or nonalcoholic drinks to allow 
guests to linger and relax before the main meal. Mezze (also spelled meze and mezedes) 
are part of the dining tradition in countries from Greece and Turkey, throughout the 
Middle East to North Africa. Mezze may be accompanied by the flatbread typical of the 
country (see Lavosh, page 968, and Naan, page 993) and are often served to seated 
guests as appetizers before their main meal.
Spaniards observe a similar custom when they prepare and consume tapas. These are 
small portions of hot or cold savory foods such as sliced chorizo, shrimp in garlic sauce 
or deep-fried olives, which are served in bars at any time. These little bites serve two 
purposes: They stimulate the appetite and keep patrons drinking. Often tapas are eaten 
by patrons standing in a lively and crowded bar. Modern tapas bars may feature small 
plates of sophisticated foods garnished with truffles or a foam whereas a classic tapa 
might be a humble dish of pan con tomate (toasted bread smeared with ripe tomato) 
or a cube of egg and potato omelet. (See Tortilla Española, page 613.) Similar offerings 
served in Portugal are known as petiscos.

Zakuski is the Russian word meaning “small morsels” and the name given to snacks 
and small dishes offered before a meal. Caviar, smoked fish, bracing vinegar-pickled veg￾etables, radishes in sour cream, pork in aspic, pirogi dumplings and mayonnaise-bound 
salads are typical zakuski offerings. Chilled vodka, said to cleanse the palate, is the pre￾ferred accompaniment.
As North American chefs explore global cuisines, they are being inspired by many 
different ways of preparing and serving hors d’oeuvre.
SERVING HORS D’OEUVRE
Hors d’oeuvre are not served only as a precursor to a seated dinner. At many events, 
the only foods served may be hors d’oeuvre. They may be passed to the guest by wait￾ers or served from an hors d’oeuvre buffet or a combination of the two. Whether the 
hors d’oeuvre are served before dinner or as dinner, they must always be attractively 
prepared and displayed.
All events have themes and varying degrees of formality. Long buffets with overflow￾ing baskets of crudités and sweet potato chips with dips presented in hollowed squashes 
and cabbages may be appropriate for one event, whereas elegant silver trays of care￾fully prepared canapés served to guests by white-gloved, tuxedoed staff (also referred 
to as butler service) may be appropriate for another. When preparing and serving hors 
d’oeuvre, always keep the event’s theme in mind and plan accordingly.
When choosing hors d’oeuvre, select an assortment with contrasting flavors, textures 
and styles. Three to four cold and three to four hot selections are sufficient for most 
occasions. The following is a sample selection of hot and cold hors d’oeuvre that offers 
the recommended variety.
Cold
	▪ Canapés of smoked salmon or trout on brioche
	▪ Barquettes filled with Gorgonzola cheese and garnished with grapes and toasted 
almonds
	▪ Tiny tortilla cups filled with grilled ginger chicken and spicy mango salsa
	▪ Serving spoons filled with salmon or tuna tartare
Hot
	▪ Deep-fried vegetables or turnovers with an appropriate sauce
	▪ Stuffed mushroom caps
	▪ Shrimp grilled with fresh rosemary
	▪ Small cheese tarts
 Passed Hors d’Oeuvre
Passed hors d’oeuvre, are presented to guests on trays by the service staff. The hors 
d’oeuvre can be hot or cold but should be very small to make it easier for guests to eat 
them without needing a knife or fork. (Custom utensils such as hors d’oeuvre forks and 
spoons allow guests to sample one-bite appetizers while standing up.) Soups can be por￾tioned into small cups or glasses so no spoon is needed when passed as hors d’oeuvre.
Hot hors d’oeuvre should be passed separately from cold hors d’oeuvre so that they 
can be kept at the correct temperatures. For hot hors d’oeuvre, serving plates and trays 
should be heated to keep the food warm during service. Plates and trays on which hot 
or cold hors d’oeuvre are served must be kept meticulously clean and decorated with 
attractive and appropriate garnishes. For a one-hour cocktail reception before a din￾ner, three to five hors d’oeuvre per person is usually sufficient. If hors d’oeuvre are 
the only food being served, however, four to five pieces per person per hour may be 
more appropriate.

 Cold canapé presentation 
 Buffet Service 
 An hors d’oeuvre buffet should be beautiful and appetizing. It may consist of a single 
table to serve a small group of people or several huge multilevel displays designed to 
feed thousands. Take colors, flavors and textures into account when planning the menu. 
 Both hot and cold hors d’oeuvre may be served on buffets. Hot hors d’oeuvre are 
often kept hot by holding them in chafing dishes. Hot hors d’oeuvre can be displayed on 
trays or platters; the trays and platters, however, must be replaced frequently to ensure 
that the food stays hot. Cold hors d’oeuvre can be displayed on trays, mirrors, platters, 
baskets, leaves, papers or other serving pieces. Individual portions of shrimp cocktail or 
other appetizers, such as beef tenderloin and puréed potatoes, can work well on buffets, 
especially when seating is available for guests. 
 Buffet Platters 
 When displaying hors d’oeuvre and other foods on trays or platters, the foods should be 
arranged in a pattern that is pleasing to the eye and flows toward the guest or from one side 
to the other. An easy and attractive method for accomplishing this is to arrange the items 
on a tray with an attractive centerpiece such as carved fruit or vegetables or fresh flowers. 
Alternately, food can be placed in parallel diagonal lines, alternating the various styles and 
shapes as shown in the accompanying photograph. Be careful not to make the tray too 
fussy or cluttered, however; often the best approach is to keep it simple. A variety of levels 
and heights also adds to the visual excitement when displaying hors d’oeuvre platters. 
 QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION 
1 Identify and describe the three parts of a canapé. 
2 select several recipes for sauces and fillings from other chapters in this book that would be 
suitable to use in hot hors d’oeuvre. describe the techniques and other ingredients you 
would use to adapt these recipes. 
3 research the mezze tradition of the Middle east or North Africa. Create a menu of mezze 
dishes suitable for a large buffet. List five dishes and describe how they would be served. 
4 Create a menu of passed hors d’oeuvre for a small cocktail party. Include three hot and 
three cold items and explain your choices.

Chèvre Tarts
Flavor Profiles
The flavor profile of many hors d’oeuvre 
can be adjusted to accommodate various 
themes or international cuisines by 
adjusting a few seasonings or ingredients. 
For example, if you use hot salsa in place 
of the Basil Pesto sauce and queso fresco 
in place of the French-style goat cheese, 
your Chèvre Tarts become suitable for a 
Mexican- or southwestern-themed event. 
Adding minced Iberico ham and replacing 
the goat cheese with Manchego produces 
a spanish-flavored option. other recipes 
from this text can be adapted in a similar 
fashion. Try using an unflavored risotto 
stuffed with chopped kimchi in the 
Arancini (page 921) for a Korean-inspired 
appetizer. stuffed mushrooms can be 
made with many different ingredients and 
seasonings. If a recipe works successfully, 
do not be afraid to experiment with 
flavors and seasonings as long as the 
foundation ingredients and fundamental 
techniques remain unchanged.

Principles of 
the Bakeshop 
30
M30_LABE1163_07_SE_C30.indd 923 31/10/23 9:05 PM924
 After studying this chapter, 
you will be able to: 
30. 1 identify a variety of bakeshop tools 
and equipment 
30. 2 identify and select bakeshop ingredients 
30. 3 measure ingredients in the 
bakeshop correctly 
30. 4 explain mixing methods used in 
the bakeshop 
30. 5 describe and explain the baking process 
 Flour, sugar, eggs, milk, butter, flavorings—with this simple list of ingredients, a 
seemingly endless variety of sweet goods, from breads to sauces to pastries, can 
be made. But to produce consistently good brioche, Bavarians, biscuits or the like, 
careful attention must be paid to the character and quantity of each ingredient, the way the 
ingredients are combined and how heat is applied to them. Unlike, for example, a cut of 
meat that can be grilled, roasted, sautéed or braised and still be the same cut of meat, bake￾shop products depend on careful, precise preparation for their very identity. 
 accurate measurements are critical in the bakeshop. it is equally important to follow 
bakeshop formulas carefully and completely. Unlike mistakes in other types of cooking, 
baking mistakes often are not discovered until the product is finished, by which time it is 
too late to correct them. for example, if salt is left out when preparing a stew, the mistake 
can be corrected by adding salt at service time. if salt is left out of a batch of bread dough, 
its texture and flavor may be ruined and the mistake cannot be corrected after the bread 
has baked. for this reason, it may be more important to follow a written formula, measure 
ingredients precisely and combine them accurately in the bakeshop than anywhere else in 
the kitchen. 
 this text provides a thorough introduction to the skills needed in a bakeshop 
by focusing on the types of breads and desserts usually found in small retail shops 
or restaurants. Because this text is not designed for large wholesale or commer￾cial bakeries, mixes, stabilizers and mechanical preparation and shaping tools are 
not included. 
 BAKESHOP TOOLS AND EQUIPMENT 
 Beginning cooks may find the tools of the bakeshop a bit complex. Indeed, the tools 
required for a professional pâtisserie are quite specialized. A chef who is educated 
and accomplished need not be concerned with possessing every gadget available but 
should recognize and be familiar with most of the items shown in Figure 30. 1 . Although 
many of these hand tools make a task easier, most can be improvised by a creative 
chef. Several of the items shown, such as the springform pans, tartlet pans and petit 
four molds, are for shaping or holding batters and doughs. The various spatulas are 
for spreading icings or fillings. The piping tools and cake comb are for decorating and 
finishing baked goods. When purchasing tools and equipment for the bakeshop, look 
for quality and durability. 
 Bakeshop ovens may be conventional, convection or steam injection models. The 
baking instructions in the following chapters are based on the use of a conventional 
oven. If a convection oven is used instead, the temperature and baking time may need 
to be reduced. (See page 102.) Convection ovens can reduce cooking time, but the 
air currents may damage delicate products such as spongecake or puff pastry. Steam

BAKESHOP INGREDIENTS
Although substituting ingredients may have little or no effect on some dishes (carrots can 
be substituted for turnips in a stew, for instance), this is not the case with baked goods. 
Different flours, fats, liquids and sweeteners function differently. Bread flour and cake 
flour are not identical, nor are oil and butter. If one ingredient is substituted for another, 
the results will be different.
Understanding ingredients, why they function the way they do and how to adjust 
for their differences makes the baking experience more successful and consistent. This 
chapter discusses flours, sugar and other sweeteners, fats, thickeners and flavorings such 
as chocolate, vanilla and nuts. Flavorings such as herbs, spices and liquors are discussed 
in Chapter 7, Flavors and Flavorings. Dairy products, also common in baked goods, are 
discussed in Chapter 8, Dairy Products. Eggs, coffee and tea are discussed in Chapter 21, 
Eggs and Breakfast. Table 30.4 describes the functions of these ingredients in bakeshop 
preparations and is a useful reference.
Flours
Flour provides bulk and structure to baked goods. Flours can be used to thicken liquids
in items such as custards and pie fillings or to prevent foods from sticking during prepa￾ration and baking. Flour is produced when grain kernels are milled or ground into a 
powder. Grains are grasses that bear edible seeds. Corn, rice and wheat are the most

significant grains in the human diet, but the most frequently used—and therefore the 
most important—ingredient in the bakeshop is wheat flour.
Wheat Flour
Wheat flour (Fr. farine) is produced by milling wheat kernels (berries). Recall from 
Chapter 23, Potatoes, Grains and Pasta, that a wheat kernel has an outer covering called 
bran. The bran is composed of several layers that protect the endosperm, which con￾tains starches and proteins. The innermost part of the kernel is the germ, which contains 
fat and serves as the wheat seed. (See Figure 23.1.) During milling, the kernels first 
pass through metal rollers to crack them. The bran and germ are then removed through 
repeated stages of sifting and separation. The remaining endosperm is ground into flour. 
Flour made from the portion of the endosperm closest to the germ (also known as patent 
flour) is finer; flour made from the portion of the endosperm nearer the bran (clear flour) 
is coarser and darker.
Composition of Flour
Wheat flour consists primarily of five nutrients: fat, minerals, moisture, starches and pro￾teins. Fat and minerals each generally account for less than 1 percent of flour’s content. 
The moisture content of flour is also relatively low—when packaged, it cannot exceed 
14 percent under U.S. government standards. But actual moisture content varies depend￾ing on climatic conditions and storage. In humid climates or in damp areas of the kitchen, 
flour absorbs moisture from the atmosphere. This additional moisture may affect other 
ingredients in the formula or the final product made from the flour.
Starches constitute 63–77 percent of wheat flour and are necessary for the absorption 
of moisture during baking. This process of absorbing moisture, known as gelatinization, 
occurs primarily at temperatures above 150°F (65°C). Starches also provide food for yeast 
during fermentation.
Protein accounts for 6–18 percent of the nutrients in wheat flour, but it is an extremely 
important component. The type of wheat used determines its protein content and there￾fore the characteristics of the flour. Wheat is classified as soft or hard depending on the 
kernel’s shape and density. The denser the wheat kernel, the higher its protein content. 
Soft wheat yields a soft flour with a low protein content. Soft flour, also called weak 
flour, is best for tender products such as cakes. Hard wheat yields a hard flour with a 
high protein content. Hard flour, also known as strong flour, is used for bagels, buns, 
rolls, crusty yeast breads, flatbreads and sandwich breads.
Various types of flour are created by mixing or blending flours from different variet￾ies of wheat. Cake flour is a fine, white flour with a low protein content. Ground from 
deep within the endosperm, cake flour is treated with bleaching agents to produce its 
pure white color. The bleaching also contributes to the properties of cake flour, which 
absorbs moisture but develops a weak gluten network. High-ratio cakes, which contain a 
high percentage of liquid and sugar, require cake flour to rise properly. Pastry flour is 
a low-protein flour usually milled from soft red winter wheat and not usually bleached. 
All-purpose flour, a blend of hard and soft flours, is designed for use in a wide range of 
foods. It is often labeled Hotel and Restaurant flour. Sold both bleached and unbleached, 
all-purpose flour is referred to throughout this text because it is readily available in quanti￾ties appropriate for small food service operations. Large bakeshops rarely use all-purpose 
flour; instead, they choose flours specifically milled and blended for specific characteris￾tics. Bread flour, milled from hard spring or winter wheat, has the higher protein content 
necessary to produce baked goods with a chewy crumb and crisp crust. High-gluten 
flour, as its name implies, is a blend of the highest-protein-content flour.
Flour Proteins
Flour proteins are extremely important because of their gluten-forming potential. Gluten
is the tough, rubbery substance created when the proteins in wheat flour are mixed with 
water. Gluten strands are both plastic (they change shape under pressure) and elastic 
(they resume their original shape when that pressure is removed). Gluten is respon￾sible for the volume, texture and appearance of baked goods. It provides structure and 
gluten an elastic network of proteins created 
when the proteins in wheat flour are moistened 
and manipulated

enables dough to expand in volume and rise or leaven. The gluten structure helps the 
dough retain the gases given off by leavening agents, such as baking powder and baking 
soda, discussed later in this chapter, and yeast discussed in Chapter 32, Yeast Breads. 
Without gluten, producing raised breads is challenging. The gases created by yeast fer￾mentation or chemical leaveners simply escape if there is no network of gluten strands 
to trap them in the dough.
The proteins in flour responsible for gluten formation are glutenin and gliadin. Flour 
does not contain gluten; only a dough or batter can contain gluten. Gluten is produced 
when glutenin and gliadin are moistened and manipulated (e.g., when they are stirred 
or kneaded). In general, the higher a flour’s protein content, the greater that flour’s 
 gluten-forming potential. To make a chewy product, such as a crusty French loaf or a 
bagel, flour with a high protein content must be used. Lower-protein flours are used for 
tender or soft products, such as cakes or muffins.
Table 30.1 lists the protein content and uses for several common flours. Substituting 
one type of flour for another may be acceptable in some formulas as long as the ratio of 
fats, moisteners and other ingredients is adjusted accordingly. In most cases, however, 
substituting one type of flour for another results in a changed and probably less desir￾able product.
Gluten development is affected by a number of factors, including mixing time and the 
presence of fat. Generally the longer a substance is mixed, the more gluten develops. 
Extreme overmixing in industrial equipment can break down the gluten structure, how￾ever. The type and balance of ingredients in a formula also affects gluten development. 
Fats coat the protein in the flour, inhibiting the formation of the gluten network. Flour 
needs to absorb liquid in order for the proteins to form gluten strands. Firm bread dough 
that can be kneaded and shaped before baking requires a high-protein flour. When this 
dough is made with water it bakes into a product with a solid structure. When whole 
milk is used in the same formula, the product is more tender because the milkfat weak￾ens the gluten bond.
Aging and Bleaching of Flours
Any flour develops better baking qualities if allowed to rest for several weeks after mill￾ing. Freshly milled flour produces sticky doughs and products with less volume than 
those made with aged flour. During aging, flour turns white through a natural oxidation 
process that is referred to as bleaching.
Natural aging and bleaching are somewhat unpredictable, time-consuming processes, 
however, so some flour mills use chemicals to control and speed aging and bleaching. 
Chlorine dioxide and other chemicals remove yellow pigments and produce a uniform 
white color. Bleaching destroys small amounts of the flour’s naturally occurring vitamin 
E. Potassium bromate helps rapidly age flour. It strengthens the gluten structure in bread 
dough and helps make bread rise faster—important considerations when making bread 
in an industrial or commercial setting. Once a popular additive, potassium bromate has 
been identified as a possible carcinogen. Its use is banned in Canada, South America,

the E.U. and China but is still allowed in the United States. Many flour millers no longer 
use potassium bromate in the United States, however, and many bakers use unbleached 
and unbromated flours exclusively.
Specialty Flours
Whole-wheat flour is made by milling the entire wheat kernel, including the bran and 
nutritious germ. Whole-wheat flour has a nutty, sweet flavor and brown, flecked color. 
Products made with whole-wheat flour are denser, with less volume than those made 
with white flour. Bran particles cut through the gluten strands in whole-wheat dough, 
giving the bread a denser crumb, or internal structure. Whole-wheat flour has a reduced 
shelf life because fats in the germ can become rancid during storage. The granulation 
size of whole-wheat flour varies from fine to coarse, depending on the manufacturer. 
A finer grind absorbs more water; therefore, it is important to adjust formulas according 
to the type of whole-wheat flour used. A strain of white wheat produces a lighter-colored 
whole-wheat flour with the nutritional benefits of whole wheat. Whole-wheat pastry and 
high-gluten flours are available. Graham flour is a type of coarse whole-wheat flour 
used to add texture to crackers and baked goods.
Though not a flour, wheat germ is often used in place of some wheat flour for 
its texture, flavor and nutritional content. Wheat germ can be used in place of up to 
 one-third of the wheat flour in a dough formula. The finished product will have a denser 
texture, however.
Vital wheat gluten (gluten flour) is the pure protein extracted from wheat flour. 
With an average protein content of 75 percent, it is used to boost the protein content of 
weaker flours such as rye and whole-wheat flour. Vital wheat gluten must be blended 
with other ingredients to form a dough or batter.
Self-rising flour is an all-purpose flour to which salt and a chemical leavener, usu￾ally baking powder, have been added. It is not recommended for professional use. 
Chemicals lose their leavening ability over time and may cause inconsistent results. 
Furthermore, different formulas call for different ratios of salt and leaveners; no com￾mercial blend is appropriate for all purposes.
Nonwheat flours, also referred to as composite flours, are made from grains, seeds 
or beans. Corn, soybeans, rice, oats, buckwheat, potatoes and other items provide flours, 
but none of them contain the gluten-forming proteins of wheat flour. Composite flours 
are generally blended with a high-protein wheat flour for baking. Substituting composite 
flour for wheat flour changes the flavor and texture of the finished product.
Rye flour is commonly used in bread baking. It is milled from the rye berry in the 
same way that wheat flour is milled from the wheat berry. Rye flour comes in four grades 
or colors: white, medium, dark and rye meal. White rye flour is made from only the cen￾ter of the rye berry. Medium and dark rye flours are made from the whole rye berry after 
the bran is removed and have the most intense rye flavor. Rye meal is milled from the 
entire rye berry and is most often coarsely textured. Some mills refer to their rye meal 
as pumpernickel flour. Others use the term pumpernickel to describe any dark rye flour.
All rye flours have a warm, pungent flavor similar to caraway and a gray-brown color. 
Although rye flour contains proteins, they will not form gluten, so bread made with 
100 percent rye flour is dense and flat. Therefore rye flour is usually blended with a 
 high-protein wheat flour to produce a more acceptable product.
Nutrition of Flours
Flours are generally high in carbohydrates and low in fat. The grains from which they 
are milled are often rich in vitamins and minerals. Some of these nutrients, however, are 
lost during milling. In enriched flours, thiamin, riboflavin, niacin and iron are added at 
levels set by the government.
Purchasing and Storing Flours
Food service operations often purchase flour in 25- or 50-pound bags. These bags should 
be stored sealed in a lit, ventilated room at temperatures no higher than 80°F (27°C).

Flour can be stored in a refrigerator or freezer if necessary to prevent the onset of rancid￾ity. Refrigeration may cause the flour to absorb moisture, however, which will limit the 
flour’s ability to absorb additional moisture during use. An open bag of flour should be 
transferred to a closed container to prevent contamination. Even unopened bags of flour 
should not be stored near items with strong smells, as flour readily absorbs odors. Whole 
grains should be stored in airtight containers in cool, dry, dark conditions. Coolness 
inhibits insect infestations; dryness prevents mold. Using airtight containers stored in 
darkness helps prevent nutrient loss.
Sugar and Sweeteners
Sugar (Fr. sucre) and other sweeteners serve several purposes in the bakeshop. They 
provide flavor and color; tenderize products by weakening gluten strands; provide food 
for yeasts; serve as preservatives and act as creaming or foaming agents to assist with 
leavening.
Sugar
Sugars are simple carbohydrates. They are classified as either (1) single or simple sugars 
(monosaccharides), such as glucose and fructose, which occur naturally in honey and 
fruits, or (2) double or complex sugars (disaccharides), which occur both naturally, for 
example as lactose in milk, as well as in refined sugars.
The sugar most often used in the kitchen is sucrose, a refined sugar obtained from 
both the large tropical grass called sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum) and the root 
of the sugar beet (Beta vulgaris). Sucrose is a disaccharide, composed of one molecule 
each of glucose and fructose. The chemical composition of beet and cane sugars is iden￾tical. The two products taste, look, smell and react the same. Sucrose is available in many 
forms: white granulated, light or dark brown granulated, pressed into cubes, molasses 
and powdered.
Sugar Manufacturing
The first step in sugar production is to crush the cane or beet to extract the juice. This 
juice contains tannins, pigments, proteins and other undesirable components that must 
be removed through refinement. Refinement begins by dissolving the juice in water, 
then boiling it in large steam evaporators. The solution is crystallized in heated vacuum 
pans. The uncrystallized liquid by-product, known as molasses, is separated out in a 
centrifuge. The remaining crystallized product, known as raw sugar, contains many 
impurities; the USDA considers it unfit for direct use in food.
Raw sugar is washed with steam to remove some of the impurities. This yields a prod￾uct known as turbinado sugar. Refining continues as the turbinado is heated, liquefied, 
centrifuged and filtered. Chemicals may be used to bleach and purify the liquid sugar. 
Finally, the clear liquid sugar is recrystallized in vacuum pans as granulated white sugar. 
Pure sucrose is sold in various granulated, cubed and powdered forms.
Types of Sugar
Turbinado sugar, sometimes called Demerara sugar, is the closest consumable product 
to raw sugar. It is partially refined and light brown in color, with coarse crystals and a 
caramel flavor. It is sometimes used in beverages and certain baked goods. Because of 
its high and variable moisture content, turbinado sugar is not recommended as a substi￾tute for granulated or brown sugar.
Sanding sugar has a large, coarse crystal structure that prevents it from dissolving 
easily. It is used almost exclusively for decorating cookies and pastries.
Granulated sugar is the all-purpose sugar used throughout the kitchen. The crystals 
are a fine, uniform size suitable for a variety of purposes. Sugar cubes are formed by 
pressing moistened granulated sugar into molds and allowing it to dry. Cubes are typi￾cally used for beverage service.
Brown sugar is regular refined sugar with cane sugar molasses added to it. Light 
brown sugar contains approximately 3.5 percent molasses; dark brown sugar contains 
sucrose the chemical name for common refined 
sugar; it is a disaccharide, composed of one 
molecule each of glucose and fructose

about 6.5 percent. Molasses adds moisture and a distinctive flavor. Brown sugar can be 
substituted for refined sugar, measure for measure, in any formula where its flavor is 
desired. Because of the added moisture, brown sugar tends to lump, trapping air into 
pockets, making it difficult to measure accurately by volume. (Should you need to mea￾sure by volume, pack the brown sugar tightly into the measuring cup and press lightly 
to remove any air pockets.) Always store brown sugar in an airtight container to prevent 
it from drying and hardening.
Superfine or castor sugar is granulated sugar with a smaller-sized crystal. A substi￾tute can be made by processing regular granulated sugar in a food processor for a few 
moments. Superfine sugar dissolves quickly in liquids and produces light and tender cakes.
Powdered sugar (Fr. sucre en poudre) is also called confectioner’s sugar. It is made 
by grinding granulated sugar crystals through varying degrees of fine screens. Powdered 
sugar cannot be made in a food processor. It is widely available in various degrees 
of fineness: 10X is the finest and most common; 6X and 4X are progressively coarser. 
Because of powdered sugar’s tendency to lump, 3 percent cornstarch is added by the 
manufacturer to absorb moisture and prevent lumping. Powdered sugar is used in icings 
and glazes and for decorating baked products.
Liquid Sweeteners
Although they do not act as creaming or foaming agents to assist with leavening, liq￾uid sweeteners can be used to achieve many of the same benefits as granulated sugar 
in baked goods. Most liquid sweeteners also add a distinctive flavor, such as maple or 
honey. Some liquid sweeteners are made from sugarcane; others are derived from other 
plants, grains or bees.
Corn syrup is produced by extracting starch from corn kernels and treating it with 
acid or an enzyme to develop a sweet syrup. The syrup is extremely thick or viscous and 
less sweet tasting than honey or refined sugar. Its viscosity gives foods a thick, chewy 
texture. It stabilizes products made with sugar, preventing them from recrystallization. 
Corn syrup is available in light and dark forms, which can be used interchangeably. Dark 
syrup has caramel coloring and molasses added for flavor. Corn syrup is a hygroscopic
(water-attracting) sweetener, which means it will attract water from the air on humid 
days and lose water through evaporation more slowly than granulated sugar. Thus it 
keeps products moister and fresher longer.
Honey (Fr. miel) is a strong sweetener consisting of fructose and glucose. It is created 
by honeybees from nectar collected from flowers. Its flavor and color vary depending 
on the season, the type of flower the nectar came from (white tupelo, lavender, orange 
blossom, and so on) and the honey’s age. Commercial honey is often a blend, prepared 
to be relatively neutral and consistent. Like corn syrup, honey is highly hygroscopic. Its 
distinctive flavor is found in several international foods such as baklava and halvah.
Maple syrup is made from the sap of sugar maple trees. Sap is collected during the 
spring, then boiled to evaporate its water content, yielding a sweet brown syrup. One 
sugar maple tree produces about 12 gallons of sap each season; 30–40 gallons of sap will 
produce 1 gallon of syrup. Pure maple syrup is graded according to color, flavor and sugar 
content. The more desirable products, Grades AA and A, have a light amber color and deli￾cate flavor. Pure maple syrup is expensive, but it does add a distinct flavor to baked goods, 
frostings and, of course, pancakes and waffles. Maple-flavored syrups, often served with 
pancakes, are usually corn syrups with artificial colorings and flavorings added.
Molasses (Fr. mélasse) is the liquid by-product of sugar refining. Only molasses 
derived from sugarcane is edible, as beet molasses has an unpleasant odor and bitter 
flavor. Sulfured molasses contains some of the sulfur dioxide used in secondary sugar 
processing. It is dark and has a strong, bitter flavor. Most of today’s unsulfured molasses 
is not a true by-product of sugar making. It is now intentionally produced from pure cane 
syrup and is preferred to sulfured molasses because of its lighter color and milder flavor.
The final stage of sucrose refinement yields blackstrap molasses, which is somewhat 
popular in the American South. Blackstrap molasses is very dark and thick, with a strong, 
unique flavor.

Sorghum molasses is produced by cooking down the sweet sap of a brown corn plant 
known as sorghum, which is grown for animal feed. The flavor and appearance of sor￾ghum molasses are almost identical to that of unsulfured sugarcane molasses.
Nutrition of Sugars and Sweeteners
Sweeteners are carbohydrates. They are high in calories and contain no fiber, protein, fat, 
vitamin A or vitamin C. They contain only trace amounts of thiamin, riboflavin and niacin.
Cooking Sugar
Sugar can be incorporated into a prepared item in its dry form or first liquefied into a 
syrup. Sugar syrups (not to be confused with liquid sweeteners such as molasses) take 
two forms: simple syrups, which are mixtures of sugar and water, and cooked syrups, 
which are made of melted sugar cooked until it reaches a specific temperature.
Simple Sugar Syrups
Simple sugar syrups, also known as simple syrups, are solutions of sugar dissolved in 
water. They are used to moisten cakes and to make sauces, sorbets and beverages.
A syrup’s density or concentration is dictated by its intended purpose. Cold water will 
dissolve up to double its weight in sugar; heating the solution allows more sugar to be 
dissolved, forming denser, more concentrated syrups. A hydrometer, which measures 
specific gravity and shows degrees of concentration on the Baumé scale, is the most 
accurate guide to density. The higher the number, the greater the density of the solution. 
A syrup with a higher density has more sugar dissolved in it.
Simple sugar syrups can be prepared without the aid of a hydrometer, however. To 
make a simple syrup, combine specific amounts of water and sugar in a saucepan and 
bring them to a boil. Once the solution boils, it is important not to stir, as this may cause 
recrystallization or lumping. Boil only until the sugar is completely dissolved, approximately 
1 minute. For successful simple syrups, the following formulas must be followed precisely:
Light syrup: Boil 2 parts water with 1 part sugar for 1 minute. This concentration 
measures 17–20° on the Baumé scale. A light syrup can be used for making sorbet 
or moistening spongecake.
Medium syrup: Boil 1½ parts water with 1 part sugar for 1 minute. This 
concentration measures 21–24° on the Baumé scale. A medium syrup can be used 
for candying citrus peel.
Heavy syrup: Boil equal parts water and sugar for 1 minute. This concentration 
measures 28–30° on the Baumé scale, and the solution should be at 220°F (104°C). 
Heavy syrup is a basic, all-purpose syrup kept on hand in many bakeshops to 
moisten cakes and adjust the consistency of icings and dessert sauces.
Cooked Sugars
Caramel sauce, meringue, buttercream, candy and other confections often need liquid 
sugar that is firm when cool or has a cooked caramel color or flavor. For these purposes, 
sugar is cooked to temperatures far higher than for simple syrup. A small amount of 
water is generally added at the beginning to help the sugar dissolve evenly. As the mix￾ture boils, the water evaporates, the solution’s temperature rises and its density increases. 
The syrup’s concentration depends on the amount of water remaining in the final solu￾tion: the less water, the harder the cooked sugar will be when it cools.
The sugar’s temperature indicates its concentration. If a great deal of water is present, 
the temperature will not rise much above 212°F (100°C). As water evaporates, however, 
the temperature will rise until it reaches 320°F (160°C), the point at which all water is 
evaporated. At temperatures above 320°F (160°C), the sugar begins to brown or caramel￾ize. As sugar caramelizes, its sweetening power decreases dramatically. At approximately 
375°F (191°C), sugar will burn, developing a bitter flavor. If allowed to continue cook￾ing, sugar will ignite.
density the relationship between the mass and 
volume of a substance (D = m/v). for example, 
as more and more sugar is dissolved in a liquid, 
the heavier or denser the liquid will become. 
sugar density is measured on the Baumé scale 
using a hydrometer or saccharometer.
 Safety Alert
Hot Sugar
Be extremely careful when working with hot 
sugar syrups. Because sugar can be heated 
to very high temperatures, these syrups can 
cause severe burns. Do not touch liquefied 
or caramelized sugar with your bare hand 
until it has cooled completely.
M30_LABE1163_07_SE_C30.indd 931 31/10/23 9:05 PM932 chaPter thirtY
Sugar solutions are unstable because of their molecular structure. They can recrys￾tallize because of agitation, contamination or uneven heat distribution. To prevent 
recrystallization:
1 Always use a heavy, clean saucepan, preferably copper.
2 Stir the solution to make sure all sugar crystals dissolve before it reaches a boil. 
Do not stir the solution after it begins boiling, however.
3 An interferent may be added when the solution begins to boil. Cream of tartar, 
vinegar, glucose (a monosaccharide) and lemon juice are known as interferents 
because they interfere with the formation of sugar crystals. Some formulas specify 
which interferent to use, although most interferents are used in such small 
quantities that their flavor cannot be detected.
4 Brush down the sides of the pan with cold water to wash off crystals that may be 
deposited there. These sugar crystals may seed the solution, causing more crystals 
(lumps) to form if not removed. Instead of using a brush to wash away crystals, 
the pan can be covered for a few moments as soon as the solution comes to 
a boil. Steam will condense on the cover and run down the sides of the pan, 
washing away the crystals.
The concentration of sugar syrup should be determined with a candy thermometer 
that measures very high temperatures. If a thermometer is not available, use the tradi￾tional but less accurate ice-water test: Spoon a few drops of the hot sugar into a bowl of 
very cold water. Check the hardness of the cooled sugar with your fingertips. Each stage 
of cooked sugar is named according to its firmness when cool (e.g., soft ball or hard 
crack). Table 30.2 lists the various stages of cooked sugar and the temperature for each. 
Each stage is also identified by the ice-water test result. Note that even a few degrees 
make a difference in the syrup’s concentration.

Fats
Fat is the general term for butter, margarine, lard, shortening and oil. Fats provide flavor 
and color, add moisture and richness, assist with leavening, extend shelf life and shorten 
gluten strands, producing tender baked goods.
The flavor and texture of a baked good depends on the type of fat used and the manner 
in which it is incorporated with other ingredients. In pastry doughs, solid fat shortens (ten￾derizes) the gluten strands; in bread doughs, fat increases loaf volume and lightness; in cake 
batters, fat incorporates air bubbles and helps leaven the mixture. Fats should be selected 
based on their flavor, melting point and ability to form emulsions. (See Table 30.3.)
Fats will not dissolve but will break down into smaller and smaller particles through 
mixing. With proper mixing, these fat particles are distributed, more or less evenly, 
throughout the other ingredients, causing fat and liquid to blend or emulsify.
Butter and Margarine
Butter is prized for its flavor; however, it melts at a relatively low temperature of approxi￾mately 93°F (33°C) and burns easily. Unsalted butter is preferred for baking because it 
tends to be fresher and additional salt might interfere with product formulas. Margarine 
melts at a slightly higher temperature than butter, making it useful for some rolled-in 
doughs such as puff pastry or Danish. Because they require higher temperatures to melt, 
margarine and other vegetable-based shortenings can leave a greasy taste on the tongue. 
Butter and margarine are discussed in Chapter 8, Dairy Products.
Lard
Lard (Fr. saindoux) is rendered pork fat. It is a solid white product of almost 100 per￾cent pure fat with only a small amount of water. Lard yields flaky, flavorful pastries, such 
as pie crusts and biscuits, but is rarely used commercially because it turns rancid quickly.
Shortening
Any fat is a shortening in baking because fat shortens gluten strands and tenderizes 
the product. The fat that is specifically referred to as shortening, however, is a type of 
solid, white, generally flavorless fat, specially formulated for baking. Shortenings are 
made from animal fats and/or vegetable oils that are solidified through hydrogenation. 
These products are 100 percent fat with a relatively high melting point. Solid all-purpose 
shortening is ideal for greasing baking pans because it is flavorless and odorless. When 
substituting shortening in a formula calling for butter, additional liquid must be added to 
compensate for the lack of moisture in the shortening.

*the melting point of any fat depends on its specific ratio of fatty acids, its intended use and its manufacturer. natural 
products such as butter and lard vary more from one lot to the next than do manufactured products such as margarine 
or shortening. (this information was obtained from a variety of manufacturers and assumes that the fat is pure and 
previously unused.)
lard

Emulsifiers may be added to regular shortening to assist with moisture absorption 
and retention as well as leavening. Emulsified shortenings, also known as high-ratio 
shortenings, are used in the commercial production of cakes and frostings when the 
formula contains a large amount of sugar. If a formula calls for an emulsified shortening, 
use it. If you substitute any other fat, the product’s texture suffers.
 Oil
Unlike butter and other fats, oil blends thoroughly throughout a mixture. It therefore 
coats more of the proteins, and the gluten strands will be much shorter, a desirable 
result in fine-textured products such as muffins or chiffon cakes. For baking, select a 
 neutral-flavored oil unless the distinctive taste of olive oil is desired. Never substitute oil 
in a formula requiring a solid shortening to create flakiness. For detailed information on 
oil, see Chapter 7, Flavors and Flavorings.
Chemical Leavening Agents
The shape, texture and crumb of a baked product is partly the result of gases such as 
air and carbon dioxide (CO2) trapped in the batter or dough before and during baking. 
Air is incorporated by the baker during mixing, as described later in this chapter. Carbon 
dioxide, however, is produced by chemical leavening agents or the life process of yeast
(a living organism). The proper use of yeast for leavening is discussed in Chapter 32, 
Yeast Breads.
Chemical leavening agents release gases (primarily carbon dioxide) through reactions 
between acids and bases. The gases form bubbles (air pockets) throughout the dough 
or batter. As the product bakes, the gases expand, causing the product to increase in 
volume and rise. The proteins in the dough or batter set around these air pockets, giving 
cakes, cookies and quick breads their shape and texture.
Baking Soda
Sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) is more commonly known as household baking soda. 
Baking soda is an alkaline compound (a base), which releases carbon dioxide gas if 
both an acid and moisture are present. Heat is not necessary for this reaction to occur. 
Because the reaction can start before heat is applied, products made with baking soda 
must be baked at once, before the carbon dioxide has a chance to escape from the bat￾ter or dough.
Acids commonly used with baking soda are buttermilk, sour cream, lemon juice, 
honey, molasses or fruits high in acid such as citrus. Generally the amount of baking 
soda used in a formula is only the amount necessary to neutralize the acids present. 
If more leavening action is needed, baking powder, not more baking soda, should be 
used. Too much baking soda causes a product to taste soapy or bitter; it may also cause 
a yellow color and brown spots to develop.
Baking Powder
Baking powder is a mixture of sodium bicarbonate and one or more acids, gener￾ally cream of tartar (KHC4H4O6) and/or sodium aluminum sulfate (Na2SO4 · Al2[SO4]3). 
Baking powder also contains a starch to prevent lumping and to balance the chemical 
reactions. Because baking powder contains both the acid and the base necessary for 
the desired chemical reaction, a formula that includes baking powder does not need to 
include any additional acid. Only moisture is necessary to release the gases.
There are two types of baking powder: single-acting and double-acting. An excess of 
either type produces undesirable flavors, textures and colors in baked products.
Single-acting baking powder requires only the presence of moisture to begin 
releasing gas. The eggs, milk, water or other liquids in a formula supply this moisture. 
Like products made with baking soda, products using single-acting baking powder must 
be baked immediately.

Function of Ingredients
Chemical Leaveners
▪ produce carbon dioxide to leaven 
batters and doughs
▪ tenderize baked goods
▪ contribute to the characteristic texture 
of some cakes, cookies and quick 
breads
Modern Science
the practice of mixing an acid and an 
alkali to leaven bread began during the 
industrial revolution, a period of rapid 
development in scientific thought and 
technological ability. the first commercial 
leaveners were marketed in 1850. sodium 
bicarbonate was first marketed as baking 
soda in 1867 under the brand name arm 
& hammer. the first double-acting baking 
powder became available in 1889 under 
the brand name calumet.
M30_LABE1163_07_SE_C30.indd 934 31/10/23 9:05 PMPrinciPles of the BakeshoP 935
Double-acting baking powder is more popular than single-acting. With 
 double-acting baking powder, there is a small release of gas on contact with moisture 
and a second, stronger release of gas when heat is applied. Products made with double￾acting baking powder do not need to be baked immediately. They can sit for a short 
time without loss of leavening ability. All formulas in this text call for double-acting 
baking powder.
Baking soda and baking powder are sometimes both included in a formula. This is 
because baking soda can release CO2 only to the extent that there is also an acid pres￾ent. If the soda/acid reaction alone is insufficient to leaven the product, baking powder 
is required for additional leavening.
Purchasing and Storing Chemical Leavening Agents
Purchase chemical leaveners in the smallest unit appropriate for the size of the opera￾tion. Although a large can of baking powder may cost less than several small ones, if not 
used promptly the contents of a larger container can deteriorate, resulting in unusable 
baked goods and waste.
Chemical leavening agents should always be kept tightly covered. Not only is there a 
risk of contamination if left open, but chemical leavening agents can also absorb mois￾ture from the air and lose their effectiveness. They should be stored in a cool place, as 
heat deteriorates them. A properly stored and unopened container has a shelf life of 
several years.
Thickening Agents
Thickening agents perform several functions in the bakeshop. Starches absorb moisture 
to thicken liquids. Gelatin traps liquids in a protein structure to solidify and thicken.
Starch
Starches are often used as thickening agents in the bakeshop. Cornstarch, arrowroot and 
flour are used to thicken pastry creams, sauces, custards and fruit fillings. Cornstarch
must be dissolved in cold water, then added to the mixture to be thickened and then 
heated. Once it reaches just below the boiling point, it must be cooked until it thickens 
into an opaque gel. Products thickened with cornstarch should not be vigorously stirred 
once cooled or they can break down. They also tend to separate when thawed after 
being frozen.
Arrowroot is dissolved in cold water and added to a liquid to thicken it. Used pri￾marily to thicken hot sauces, arrowroot can break down if overcooked, making it most 
appropriate for thickening sauces that will be served immediately.
Tapioca can be used to thicken a variety of pastry products. Tapioca is a starch pro￾duced from the root of the tropical cassava (manioc) plant. It is available as a flour or as 
balls, referred to as pearls. Tapioca flour can be used in the same manner as cornstarch 
to thicken sauces and fruit mixtures. Pearl tapioca is used to thicken milk for tapioca 
pudding or to thicken fruit pie fillings. Most pearl tapioca must be soaked in a cold liquid 
for several hours before cooking. Instant tapioca, which is smaller than pearls, needs to 
soak for only 20–30 minutes before cooking.
Gelatin
One of the most commonly used thickeners in the bakeshop is gelatin, a natural 
product derived from collagen, an animal protein. It is available in two forms: granu￾lated gelatin and sheet (also called leaf) gelatin. A two-step process is necessary to use 
either form. The gelatin must first be softened in a cold liquid—a process referred to as 
blooming—then dissolved in a hot liquid.
Granulated gelatin is available in bulk or in ¼-ounce (7-gram) envelopes (slightly less 
than 1 tablespoon). One envelope is enough to set 1 pint (480 milliliters) of liquid into a 
bloom to soften granulated gelatin in a cold 
liquid before dissolving and using
Function of Ingredients
Thickeners

(starch, pectin or vegetable gums)
▪ trap liquids in a protein structure to 
solidify and thicken liquids (gelatin)

firm gel or 3 cups (720 milliliters) of liquid into a softer mousse consistency. Granulated 
gelatin should be softened in four times its weight of cold liquid for at least 5 minutes, then 
heated gently to dissolve. The initial softening in a cold liquid is necessary to separate the 
gelatin molecules so that they do not lump together when the hot liquid is added. Melting 
over a double boiler prevents scorching.
Sheet or leaf gelatin is available in 1-kilogram boxes, sometimes further packaged 
in envelopes containing five or six sheets. The sheets are produced in varying thick￾nesses and weights; the average weighs about 1
⁄10 ounce (3 grams) per sheet. They must 
be separated and soaked in ice water until very soft, at least 15 minutes. They are then 
removed from the water, squeezed to remove excess moisture and stirred into a hot 
liquid until completely dissolved. When sheet gelatin is added to a hot liquid, it is not 
necessary to melt it first.
Granulated gelatin
➊ Gelatin sheets are submerged in ice water 
for 5–10 minutes to soften.
➋ softened gelatin sheets are then removed 
from the ice water and incorporated into a 
hot liquid.
Substituting Granulated 
for Sheet Gelatin
Unflavored granulated and sheet gelatin 
can be substituted for each other in 
formulas, but granulated gelatin must 
be softened (bloomed) in a cold liquid 
before it is dissolved to prevent lumps. 
When sheet gelatin is specified in this 
text, the number of sheets is listed. the 
weight of granulated gelatin to be used 
is also listed. to calculate the amount 
of additional water or liquid required 
when substituting granulated for sheet 
gelatin, multiply the weight of sheet 
gelatin called for in the formula by 4. 
then soften the granulated gelatin in this 
amount of an appropriate cold liquid—
water, stock or liquor, for example—
before dissolving it in the hot mixture as 
instructed in the formula.
Procedure for Using Sheet Gelatin
Granulated and sheet gelatin can be used interchangeably in any formula. Sheet 
gelatin, though more expensive, is preferred for its lack of flavor and color. It also 
tends to dissolve more readily and evenly and has a longer shelf life than gran￾ulated gelatin. Once incorporated into a product such as a Bavarian, gelatin can 
be frozen, or melted and reset once or twice, without a loss of thickening ability. 
Because it scorches easily, gelatin and mixtures containing gelatin should not be 
allowed to boil. Boiling also destroys gelatin’s ability to thicken. Products thickened 
with gelatin, such as mousse or custard, can become rubbery after a few days in 
the refrigerator.
Flavorings
Many flavoring ingredients are used in the bakeshop. Practically any herb, spice, beverage 
or extract can be used to impart their characteristic flavors to baked goods, creams and 
confections. As with all baking ingredients, select flavoring components for overall qual￾ity and freshness, and combine flavorings carefully to achieve a balanced, good-tasting 
finished product. Recommendations for using herbs and spices in the bakeshop are 
found in Chapter 7, Flavors and Flavorings.

Extracts
Extracts are liquid flavoring agents derived from various flavoring oils (essential oils) 
extracted from fruits, beans, spices or seeds. They are mixtures of flavoring oils or essen￾tial oils and ethyl alcohol. Vanilla, almond and lemon are frequently used extracts. An 
extract may be made with pure flavoring oils or with artificial flavors and colors. Contents 
are regulated by the FDA, and package labels must indicate any artificial ingredients. 
Because they are highly volatile, extracts should be stored in sealed containers in a cool 
area away from direct light.
Vanilla
Vanilla (Fr. vanille) is often the most frequently used flavoring in a bakeshop. It comes 
from the pod fruit, called a bean, of a vine in the orchid family. Vanilla beans are pur￾chased whole, individually or by the pound. They should be soft and pliable, with a rich 
brown color and good aroma. The finest vanilla is grown in Tahiti and Madagascar.
To use a vanilla bean, cut it open lengthwise with a paring knife. Scrape out the moist 
seeds with the knife’s tip and stir them into the mixture being flavored. The seeds do 
not dissolve and will remain visible as small black or brown flecks. After all the seeds 
have been removed, the bean can be placed in a covered container with sugar to create 
vanilla sugar.
Vanilla beans should be stored in an airtight container in a cool, dark place. During 
storage, the beans may develop a white coating. This is not mold but rather crystals of 
vanilla flavor known as vanillin. Vanillin should not be removed.
In lieu of beans, pure vanilla extract is an easy and less expensive way to give bake￾shop products a true vanilla flavor. By law, any product labeled “vanilla extract” must not 
contain artificial flavorings and must be at least 35 percent alcohol by volume. Vanilla 
extract should be stored at room temperature in a closed, opaque container. Because 
the intensity of vanilla extract varies, it is difficult to recommend an equivalent in vanilla 
beans. Generally, ½ fluid ounce (15 milliliters) of vanilla extract can be substituted for 
one vanilla bean; however, taste should be the ultimate guide.
Artificial or imitation vanilla flavoring is made with synthetic vanillin. Artificial flavor￾ing is available in a clear form, which is useful for white buttercreams in which the dark 
brown color of pure vanilla extract is undesirable. Although inexpensive, artificial vanilla 
is, at best, less complex and aromatic than pure extract.
Chocolate
Chocolate is one of the most popular flavorings—perhaps the most popular—for candies, 
cookies, cakes and pastries. Chocolate is also served as a beverage and is an ingredient 
in traditional savory Mexican mole sauce. Chocolate is available in a variety of forms and 
degrees of sweetness.
Chocolate Manufacturing
Chocolate (Fr. chocolat) begins as red or yellow fruit pods dangling from the trunk and 
main branches of the tropical cacao tree. A native species of the Amazon rainforest, 
the cacao tree is found in the Caribbean, parts of Africa, Asia and Latin America. Each 
pod contains about 40 almond-sized cacao beans. After the pods ripen, the beans are 
placed in the sun for several days to dry and ferment. This helps develop the aroma and 
essential oils in the beans. The beans are then cleaned, dried a second time, and then 
cured and roasted to develop flavor and reduce bitterness. Next the beans are crushed to 
remove their shells, yielding the prized chocolate nib. Nibs are shipped to manufacturers 
worldwide where they can be further roasted and blended to obtain the desired flavor 
and aroma. Nowadays, roasted nibs are available for use as a crunchy, cocoa-flavored 
garnish or addition to cookies and baked goods.

peels and other parts of plants used to give

In chocolate manufacturing, nibs are crushed into a thick (nonalcoholic) paste known 
as chocolate liquor or chocolate mass. Chocolate mass contains about 53 percent fat, 
known as cocoa butter. The chocolate mass is further refined depending on the desired 
product. To produce cocoa powder, virtually all the cocoa butter is removed. Adding 
more cocoa butter, sugar, milk solids and flavorings to the chocolate mass creates a 
variety of other products. Most manufacturers of fine chocolates use the Swiss technique 
of conching to increase smoothness. Conching involves stirring large vats of blended 
chocolate with a heavy granite or metal roller or paddle to smooth out sugar crystals and 
mellow the flavor.
Tasting Chocolates
There are three types of cacao beans: a very hardy, abundant African variety used 
as a base bean and two flavorful, aromatic varieties used for flavor. Most chocolates 
are blends, created by their manufacturer to be unique yet consistent. Varietal choco￾lates, those made from one type of bean grown in one specific area, have become 
popular, though expensive, for both chocolate bars and baking chocolates. In con￾trast to wine or coffee, it is difficult to taste processed chocolate and tell which beans 
were used.
Roasting greatly affects the final flavor of chocolate. Generally German and Spanish 
manufacturers use a high (or strong) roast; Swiss and American makers use a low (or 
mild) roast. Refining is also a matter of national taste preference.
Chocolate quality is the product of several factors in addition to flavor. All of the 
 following should be evaluated when selecting chocolate:
1 Appearance: Color should be even and glossy, without any discoloration
2 Smell: Should smell chocolatey with no off-odors or staleness
3 Break: Should snap cleanly without crumbling
4 Texture: Should melt quickly and evenly on the tongue
Types of Chocolate
Unsweetened chocolate is pure hardened chocolate liquor without any added sugar or 
milk solids. It is frequently used in baking and is sometimes referred to as baking choco￾late. Unsweetened chocolate is approximately 53 percent cocoa butter and 47 percent 
cocoa solids. Its flavor is pure and chocolatey, but the absence of sugar makes it virtually 
inedible as is.

Melting Chocolate
for use in baked goods, solid bars or blocks 
of chocolate usually must be portioned and 
melted. Using improper melting techniques 
can quickly ruin costly chocolate. if working 
from a large block of solid chocolate, cut 
off small pieces, weighing them until the 
necessary amount of chocolate is portioned. 
the smaller the pieces of chocolate, the 
quicker they will melt. chocolate may 
be melted in a microwave oven or over a 
bain marie.
if using a microwave, place the pieces of 
chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl. heat 
at low power in 60-second intervals, stirring 
frequently. When most of the chocolate is 
melted, remove the bowl from the oven and stir 
gently until completely melted.
if using a bain marie, place the pieces of 
chocolate in a metal bowl that fits suspended 
over a pan of water. heat the water only to 
a simmer and ensure that no steam or water 
gets into the chocolate itself, as this will cause 
lumping or seizing.
chocolate has a very sharp melting point, 
which means that it will appear solid one moment 
and then almost instantly, when the correct 
temperature is reached, it will liquefy. stirring 
is necessary to even out the temperature and 
prevent overheating. never allow the temperature 
of high-quality dark chocolate to exceed 120°f 
(49°c) as this can affect its flavor and texture. 
the solid portion of chocolate can seize into dry 
lumps and develop a bitter, scorched flavor at 
relatively low temperatures. When this happens it 
is best to discard it and start over.
in summary:
▪ cut chocolate into small pieces or purchase 
pistoles (discs) for melting.
▪ Do not allow water or steam to touch the 
chocolate; make sure bowls and spatulas are 
completely dry before use.
▪ keep the temperature low; do not exceed 
120°f (49°c) for dark chocolate, 115°f 
(46°c) for milk or white chocolate.
▪ stir frequently to blend.
Bean-to-Bar 
Chocolate
chocolatiers, who make chocolate 
candies and decorations professionally, 
are extremely interested in the source of 
their chocolates. some chocolatiers have 
become chocolate makers themselves, 
manufacturing their own chocolates from 
beans they purchase directly from growers 
around the world. By controlling the 
source, the roasting and the blending of 
their cacao beans, these chocolatiers can 
produce unique products and specialized 
flavor profiles. the term bean-to-bar chocolate
is used to refer to chocolate bars or candies 
made by such companies, whether small 
batch or on an industrial scale.
M30_LABE1163_07_SE_C30.indd 938 31/10/23 9:05 PMPrinciPles of the BakeshoP 939
Both bittersweet and semisweet chocolates contain at least 35 per￾cent chocolate liquor plus additional cocoa butter, sugar, flavorings and 
sometimes emulsifiers. Generally semisweet chocolate is sweeter than 
bittersweet chocolate, but there are no precise definitions, so flavor and 
sweetness vary from brand to brand. Both bittersweet and semisweet 
chocolates are excellent eating chocolates and can usually be 
substituted measure for measure in any formula.
Couverture [koo-vehr-TYOOR] refers to high-quality 
chocolate containing at least 32 percent cocoa butter. 
Professional chocolatiers generally prefer couver￾ture chocolate, which has a higher fluidity than 
other chocolates when melted. It is available in a 
range of flavors, such as bittersweet, semisweet and 
milk chocolate. Couverture has a glossy appearance and 
can be used to create a thin, smooth coating on confec￾tions and pastries.
U.S. government standards require that sweet chocolate
contain not less than 15 percent chocolate liquor and varying 
amounts of sugar, milk solids, flavorings and emulsifiers. As the name 
implies, sweet chocolate is sweeter, and thus less chocolatey, than semisweet chocolate.
Milk chocolate is the favorite eating chocolate in the United States. It contains sugar, 
vanilla, perhaps other flavorings and milk solids. The milk solids that make the chocolate 
milder and sweeter than other chocolates also make it less suitable for baking purposes. 
Do not substitute milk chocolate for dark chocolate in any product that must be baked, 
as the milk solids tend to burn. If melted slowly and carefully, milk chocolate can be 
used in glazes, mousses or candies.
Chocolate chips are drops of chocolate available in count sizes from 14 to 160 per 
ounce (average chips are 800–1000 per pound). Their form makes them easy to add to 
cookies, muffins and cakes. Like the larger chocolate chunks, chips are available in 
many flavors including white chocolate, butterscotch, peanut butter and fruit flavors. 
Pistoles or calets are small round pieces or discs of chocolate, often the finest couver￾ture, designed to eliminate the need for chopping chocolate in the bakeshop—especially 
useful when tempering.
Cocoa powder is the brown powder left after the fat (cocoa butter) is removed from 
cocoa beans. It does not contain any sweeteners or flavorings and is used primarily in 
baked goods. Alkalized or Dutch-processed cocoa powder has been treated with an alka￾line solution, such as potassium carbonate, to raise the powder’s pH from 5.5 to 7 or 8. 
Alkalized powder is darker and milder than non-alkalized powder and has a reduced 
tendency to lump. Either type of powder can be used in baked goods, depending on 
your flavor preference or cost concerns.
Cocoa Butter
Chocolate liquor is approximately 53 percent fat, known as cocoa butter. Cocoa butter 
has long been prized for its resistance to rancidity and its use as a cosmetic. Cocoa but￾ter has a very precise melting point, just below body temperature. Fine chocolatiers use 
high percentages of cocoa butter to give their chocolates melt-in-the-mouth quality.
White Chocolate
This ivory-colored substance is not the product of an albino cocoa bean. It is actually a 
confectionery product that does not contain any chocolate solids or liquor. The finest 
white chocolate couverture contains a minimum of 31 percent cocoa butter, a maximum 
of 55 percent sugar, 20 percent milk solids and vanilla or other flavors. Lower quality 
white chocolate products replace all or part of the cocoa butter with vegetable oils. 
These confectionery products are less expensive than those containing pure cocoa but￾ter, but their flavor and texture are noticeably inferior. White chocolate melts at a lower 
temperature than dark chocolate and burns easily. It is excellent for mousses, sauces and 
candy making but is less often used in baked products.

Imitation Chocolate or Chocolate-Flavored Coating
A less-expensive product substituted for chocolate in many prepared foods, imitation choc￾olate is made with hydrogenated vegetable oils instead of cocoa butter, as little as 8 percent 
defatted cocoa powder and as much as 55 percent sugar, plus emulsifiers, flavorings and 
perhaps milk solids. The resulting product melts at a higher temperature and requires no 
tempering. Imitation chocolates have an inferior taste and leave a waxy feel in the mouth. 
When quality is no concern, imitation chocolate may be used in place of real chocolate, but 
customers should be informed that the item is only “chocolate flavored.”
Nutrition of Chocolate
Chocolate is high in calories and fat. It contains minimal amounts of vitamin A and trace 
amounts of other vitamins as well as some sodium, phosphorus, potassium and other 
minerals. Cocoa powder as well as dark chocolate with a high cocoa content and a 
minimal amount of sugar contain antioxidants called flavanols. Cocoa flavanols have 
been shown to improve blood flow to the brain, enhancing cognitive and vision health. 
Moderate consumption of dark chocolate has also been shown to lower blood pressure 
and the risk of cardiovascular disease.
Storing Chocolate
All chocolates should be stored at a cool, consistent temperature, away from strong 
odors and moisture. Chocolate should never be stored under refrigeration. Dark choco￾late, white chocolate and cocoa powder can be kept for up to 1 year without loss of 
flavor. Milk chocolate will not keep as well because it contains milk solids.
During storage chocolate may develop grayish-white spots referred to as bloom. Two 
types of bloom can develop on chocolate. Fat bloom occurs when cocoa butter crys￾tals rise and crystallize on the chocolate’s surface. Chocolate stored above 70°F (21°C) 
will develop fat bloom over time. Because fat bloom has no effect on taste, tempering 
the product will remedy the problem. Sugar bloom occurs when moisture collects on 
the surface of the chocolate (often when refrigerated) and blends with the sugar in the 
chocolate, leaving a white sugar film. The result is a gritty chocolate that cannot be 
improved by tempering.
Nuts
Nuts (Fr. noix) provide texture and flavor to baked goods and are often substituted for 
all or part of the wheat flour in a pastry such as Sacher Torte (page 1085) or a dacquoise 
(page 1024). A true nut, according to the botanical definition, is the edible single-seed ker￾nel of a fruit surrounded by a hard shell. A hazelnut is an example of a true nut. The term 
nut is used more generally, however, to refer to any seed or fruit with an edible kernel in 
a hard shell. Walnuts and peanuts are examples of non-nut “nuts” (peanuts are legumes 
that grow underground; walnuts have two kernels). Nuts are high in fat, making them

and a crisp, sharp snap when eaten, chocolate 
must be tempered. When chocolate is not 
tempered correctly, it will be crumbly and 
develop gray streaks known as bloom when 
dry. Untempered chocolate takes a long time to 
set and sticks to candy molds.
tempering chocolate is a controlled 
process of melting, cooling and reheating 
chocolate within specific temperature ranges. 
the ideal temperature depends on the type 
of chocolate and the percent of cocoa butter 
that it contains. there are several tempering 
methods, such as seeding, tabling, microwave 
oven and cocoa butter methods. each method 
relies on melting chocolate and heating it 
to a certain temperature, then cooling and 
rewarming it. Great care must be taken when 
tempering chocolate. the chocolate must be 
chopped into small, uniform pieces so that it 
melts evenly. if overheated, the chocolate needs 
to be cooled then reheated before resuming 
the tempering process. equally important, 
steam or water must not enter the chocolate 
because this would cause it to seize. When 
stirring chocolate during tempering, if excess 
air is incorporated into the mass of chocolate, 
it will become thick and unmanageable. 
reheating and retempering will restore the 
chocolate’s fluidity. consult a specialized 
text and information provided by chocolate 
manufacturers for precise instructions on how 
to temper chocolate.
the welcome news is that, for general use, 
chocolate melted for mousses, creams, ganache 
and baking does not need to be tempered.

paste
especially susceptible to rancidity and odor absorption. Nuts should be stored in nonmetal, 
airtight containers in a cool, dark place. Most nuts may be kept frozen for up to 1 year.
Nuts are often roasted in a low (325°F/162°C) oven to heighten their flavor. (See 
Chapter 9, Mise en Place.) Some nuts such as hazelnuts, pistachios, almonds, peanuts 
and cashews are ground into nut butters used to flavor pastries. Allowing roasted 
nuts to cool to room temperature before grinding prevents them from releasing 
too much oil. When sweetened, nut butter is referred to as a paste and is used 
to flavor chocolates, ice creams and other baked items.
Almonds (Fr. amandes) are the seeds of a plumlike fruit native to western 
India and are among the earliest fruits to be cultivated. Almonds 
are now a major commercial crop in California. Almonds are 
available whole, sliced, slivered or ground. Blanched almonds 
have had their brown, textured skins removed; natural 
almonds retain their skins. If the brown color of natural 
almond skin is undesirable, the two types can be used 
interchangeably in recipes. Almonds are frequently used 
in pastries and candies and are the main ingredient in 
almond paste and marzipan.
Cashews (Fr. noix de caju), native to the Amazon, are the 
seeds of a plant related to poison ivy. Because of toxins in the shell, 
cashews are always sold shelled. Cashews are expensive and have a 
pronounced flavor. They make a wonderful addition to cookies and 
candies.
Chestnuts (Fr. marrons) are true nuts that must 
be cooked before using. Available steamed, dried, 
boiled or roasted, they are often sold as a canned 
purée, with or without added sugar. Candied or 
glazed chestnuts are also available. China is the 
world’s largest producer and exporter of chest￾nuts, but some wild varieties flourish in North 
America. The distinctive flavor of chestnuts is 
found in many sweet dishes and pastries.
Coconuts (Fr. noix de coco) are the seeds from one 
of the largest of all fruits. They grow on the tropical 
coconut palm tree. The nut is a dark brown oval, cov￾ered with coarse fibers. The shell is thick and hard; inside is a 
layer of white, moist flesh. The interior also contains a clear liquid 
known as coconut water. (This is not the same as coconut milk or coconut 
cream, both of which are prepared from coconut flesh.) Coconut has a mild 
aroma, a sweet, nutty flavor and a crunchy, chewy texture. Fresh coconuts are 
readily available but require some effort to use. A good fresh coconut should feel 
heavy; you should be able to hear the coconut water sloshing around inside. Avoid 
cracked, moist or moldy coconuts. Coconut flesh is available shredded or flaked, with 
or without added sugar. Commercially prepared coconut purée, also known as coco￾nut cream, is available for use in beverages, frozen desserts and 
pastries. Coconut is used in pastries and candies and is also 
an important ingredient in Indian, Southeast Asian and 
Caribbean cuisines.
Hazelnuts (Fr. noisettes) are true nuts that grow wild in 
the northwestern and upper midwestern U.S. states. The 
cultivated form, known as a filbert, is native to temperate 
regions throughout the Northern Hemisphere. A bit larger 
than the hazelnut, the filbert has a weaker flavor than its 
wild cousin. Both nuts look like smooth brown marbles. 
Filberts are more abundant, so they are generally less 
expensive. Their distinctive flavor goes well with chocolate 
and coffee.

Macadamia nuts
Peanuts
Pecans
english walnuts
Pine nuts
Pistachios
to remove hazelnut skin, roast whole nuts in a 
275°f (135°c) oven for 12–15 minutes. they 
should give off a good aroma and just begin 
to darken. While still hot, rub the nuts in a 
dry towel or against a mesh sifter to remove 
the skin.
Hazelnut paste (Fr. praline) is a smooth composition made 
from finely ground roasted hazelnuts and sugar. It is used to flavor 
creams, chocolates and icings. Gianduja [zhahn-DOO-yah] refers to 
chocolate blended with hazelnut paste that is used as a filling or in 
candies.
Macadamia nuts are small, round, creamy white nuts with a 
sweet, rich flavor and high fat content, native to Australia. The 
shell is extremely hard and must be removed by machine, 
so the macadamia is always sold out of the shell. Its 
flavor blends well with fruit, coconut and white and 
dark chocolate.
Peanuts (Fr. arichides) are legumes (not nuts) 
that grow underground. The peanut is native to 
South America; it made its way into North America 
via Africa in the 18th century, however. Peanuts 
may be eaten raw or roasted and are available 
shelled or unshelled, with or without their thin red 
skins. Peanuts are ubiquitous ground with a bit of oil into 
peanut butter.
Pecans (Fr. noix pacane), native to the Mississippi River 
Valley, are perhaps the most popular nuts in the United States. 
Their flavor is rich and mapley and appears most often in breads, 
sweets and pastries. They are available whole in the shell or in various 
standard sizes and grades of pieces.
Pine nuts (Fr. pignons), also known as piñon nuts and pinoli, are the seeds of 
several species of pine tree. The small, creamy white, teardrop￾shaped nuts are commonly used in pastries from Spain, Italy 
and the American Southwest. They are rarely ground because 
of their small size and high fat content. They only need 
to be roasted if used in a dish that will not receive 
further cooking.
Pistachios (Fr. pistaches) are native to central Asia, 
where they have been cultivated for more than 3000 years. 
California now produces most of the pistachios marketed 
in the United States. Pistachios are unique for the green 
color of their meat. When ripe, the shell opens naturally at 
one end, aptly referred to as “smiling,” 
which makes shelling the nuts 
quite easy. Pistachios are sold 
whole, shelled or unshelled 
and are used in pastries 
and confections.
Walnuts (Fr. noix), 
relatives of the pecan, are 
native to Asia, Europe and 
North America. The black wal￾nut, native to Appalachia, has a dark 
brown meat and a strong flavor. The 
English walnut, now grown primarily in 
California, has a milder flavor, is easier to shell and 
is less expensive. Walnuts are more popular than 
pecans outside the United States. They are used in 
baked goods and pressed for oil.

TABLE 30.4
MEASURING INGREDIENTS IN THE BAKESHOP
Precise, accurate measurement of ingredients is extremely important for bakeshop prod￾ucts. As a result, baking formulas often list weights, even for liquid ingredients. Measuring 
ingredients by weight is more accurate, and, once the basic procedures are mastered, 
it is faster than measuring by volume. It is also important to remember that most foods 
do not weigh their volume. In other words, 1 cup of flour equals 8 fluid ounces of flour 
(a measure of volume) but it does not contain 8 ounces of flour by weight. For best 
results, use the measurement specified in each formula.
M30_LABE1163_07_SE_C30.indd 943 31/10/23 9:05 PM944 chaPter thirtY
Because accurate weights are so important, balance scales are commonly employed 
in the bakeshop. Procedures for using these scales are included here. Electronic scales 
calibrated in both grams and fractions of an ounce are also used in bakeshops but must 
be handled with care. Good quality electronic scales are expensive and can be damaged 
if loaded beyond their maximum weight. Even airborne flour particles or spilled ingre￾dients can ruin an electronic scale. Be sure to calibrate and maintain scales frequently 
according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.
Procedure for Using a Balance Scale
Baker’s Percentage
Many formulas for baked goods, especially those for cookies, cakes and breads, list 
ingredients as a percentage in addition to, or in place of, a specific weight or volume 
measurement. Percentages make accurate formula conversions possible and are a con￾venient type of shorthand. Simply by considering the percentages in formulas, bakers 
who are familiar with the function of ingredients can tell at a glance how rich, moist or 
crisp a finished product will be. For example, a cookie dough with a high percentage 
(ratio) of fat in relation to flour will bake into a more crumbly pastry than cookie dough 
containing a lower percentage of fat. When formulas list ingredients in proportion to 
other ingredients, the experienced baker can select formulas with the proper ratios for 
the product desired.
The percentage formula most commonly used in bakeshops worldwide is called 
baker’s percentage. When using baker’s percentage, the quantity of each ingredi￾ent is expressed as a percentage of the total amount of flour used in the formula. The 
weights of all the ingredients must be in the same unit of measure, such as ounces, 
grams, pounds or kilos. (The examples in this chapter use ounces, but baker’s percent￾age is used for metric weights as well.) The flour in the formula is always 100%. If a 
formula calls for two or more types of flour, the total of all the flours must equal 100%. 
A formula that does not contain flour, such as a custard or cake frosting, is not given in 
baker’s percentages.
➊ to use a balance scale to weigh an 
ingredient, place an empty container on 
the left. next set a counterbalance to that 
container on the right. Use weights and the 
sliding beam weight to add an amount equal to 
the amount of the ingredient needed.
➋ Place the ingredient on the left side of the 
scale until the two platforms are balanced.
Note on Baker’s 
Percentage
Baker’s percentage is included in 
bakeshop formulas in chapter 31, Quick 
Breads, through chapter 35, custards, 
creams, frozen Desserts and Dessert 
sauces, only when flour is a primary 
ingredient. in formulas in which baker’s 
percentage is used, the percentages are 
what dictate the quantity of ingredients 
in either the U.s. or metric column. 
the metric ingredient measurements 
are not always exact equivalents of the 
United states ingredient measurement. 
Quantities may be rounded to the 
nearest whole number to make the 
formulas usable. an exception is made for 
significant ingredients when their weight 
is less than 5% of the weight of flour.

Calculating Baker’s Percentage
To calculate the baker’s percentage in a formula:
Step 1 identify the total weight of the flour in the formula. this weight is 100%.
Step 2 Be sure that the weights of all ingredients are given in the same unit of measure.
Step 3 Divide the weight of each of the other ingredients in the formula by the weight of 
the flour.
Weight of ingredient ÷ Weight of flour
Step 4 Multiply the number obtained by 100% to calculate the baker’s percentage for each 
ingredient. the number obtained will be a decimal number, typically less than 1.
Weight of ingredient ÷ Weight of flour × 100 = Baker’s Percentage of ingredient
Weight of ingredient × 100 = B.P.
Weight of flour
EXAMPLE 30.1 Conver ting a Formula to Baker ’s Percentage
You need to convert the Sugar Cookie Dough formula in Figure 30.2 to baker’s percentage 
so that it can be scaled up. Follow these steps to convert the formula:
Step 1 Use ounces as the common unit of measure. the total weight of the flour is 100%.
1 pound (16 ounces) of flour = 100%
Step 2 Be sure that all ingredient weights are in the same unit of measure, then divide the 
weight of the sugar by the weight of the flour.
6 ounces sugar ÷ 16 ounces flour = 0.375
Step 3 Multiply the number obtained by 100 to calculate the baker’s percentage for the sugar.
0.375 × 100 = 37.5%
Step 4 calculate the baker’s percentage for each of the other ingredients in the formula as 
outlined in steps 1, 2 and 3.
Butter: 7 ÷ 16 = 0.437 × 100 = 43.7%
Vanilla extract: 1 ÷ 16 = 0.062 × 100 = 6.2%
Comparing Formulas Using 
Baker’s Percentage
An experienced baker can tell at a glance that this 
sugar cookie with 43.7% butter will be more tender 
and crumbly than one made from a formula with 
just 20% butter. With 37.5% sugar, this cookie will 
be sweet and somewhat crisp but not as sweet and 
brittle as a similar cookie with 60% sugar. Baker’s per￾centage makes it easy to compare formulas. Compare 
the Spritz Cookies (page 1044) and the Sugar Cookie 
Dough in Figure 30.2. Simply by reading the formula, 
you can tell that the Spritz Cookies with 80% butter 
are richer and more buttery than the Sugar Cookies 
with 43.7% butter.
Customizing a Formula Using 
Baker’s Percentage
You can quickly customize a formula by using percent￾ages. Because the vanilla extract in the Sugar Cookie 
Dough is 6.2%, we know that adding 6% of another fla￾voring will transform this cookie without significantly 
altering the texture of the finished product.

Changing a Formula’s Yield Using Baker’s Percentage
When converting the yield of a recipe or formula, the relationship or ratio of ingredients 
should remain constant. Baker’s percentages make it very easy to scale the formula up 
or down. The term to scale up (or scale down) refers to increasing (or decreasing) a 
formula’s yield. To change yield using baker’s percentage, first determine the desired or 
new formula yield. Then divide the total baker’s percentage for the original formula by 
100 to obtain a baker’s percentage conversion factor. Multiply the new formula yield by 
the conversion factor to determine the quantity of flour needed for the new scaled for￾mula. Once you determine the total amount of flour, it is straightforward to calculate the 
quantities of other ingredients in the formula. Determine the remaining ingredient quan￾tities by multiplying the new flour weight by the baker’s percentage for each ingredient.
To scale a formula:
Step 1 Determine the new formula yield required. converting the total yield from pounds 
(kilograms) to ounces (grams) ensures accuracy.
Step 2 Divide the total baker’s percentage for the original formula by 100 to obtain the bak￾er’s percentage (B.P.) conversion factor for the formula.
total Baker’s Percentage ÷ 100 = B.P. conversion factor total Baker’s Percentage = B.P. conversion factor 100
Step 3 Divide the new formula yield by the B.P conversion factor.

Step 4 calculate the quantity of other ingredients required by multiplying the baker’s per￾centage for each ingredient by the new flour weight.
EXAMPLE 30.2 Changing a Formula’s Yield Using Baker ’s Percentage
The formula for Sugar Cookie Dough yields 20 cookies at 1.5 ounces each. You need 
48 cookies weighing 1.5 ounces each. (See Figure 30.3.)
M30_LABE1163_07_SE_C30.indd 946 31/10/23 9:05 PMPrinciPles of the BakeshoP 947
Follow these steps to determine the weight of ingredients in the new formula:
Step 1 calculate the new formula yield.
original Yield: 20 cookies × 1.5 ounces = 30 ounces of dough
new Yield: 48 cookies × 1.5 ounces = 72 ounces of dough
Step 2 Divide the total baker’s percentage (B.P) for the original formula by 100 to obtain the 
B.P. conversion factor for the formula.
187.4 total B. P. ÷ 100 = 1.874 B.P. conversion factor
Step 3 Divide the new formula yield by the B.P. conversion factor.
72 oz. new yield ÷ 1.874 B.P. conversion factor = 38.42 oz. new flour weight
Step 4 calculate the quantity of other ingredients required by multiplying the new flour 
weight by the baker’s percentage for each ingredient.
sugar: 38.42 oz. × 37.5% = 14.4 oz.
Butter: 38.42 oz. × 43.7% = 16.8 oz.
Vanilla extract: 38.42 oz. × 6.2% = 2.3 fl. oz.
MIXING METHODS
A critical step in the production of all baked goods is mixing the ingredients. The tech￾niques used to mix or combine ingredients affect the product’s final volume, appearance 
and texture. Mixing distributes ingredients evenly. Mixing activates the proteins in wheat 
flour, causing the formation of gluten. Mixing incorporates air into (aerates) a mixture 
to help it rise and develop a light texture when baked. Different mixing methods ensure 
that ingredients are combined in the proper order to achieve the desired results.
There are several mixing methods—beating, blending, creaming, cutting, fold￾ing, kneading, sifting, stirring and whipping. (See Table 30.5.) Learn the differences 
among these mixing methods, then use the designated method with the appropriate 
equipment or tool to ensure a good-quality finished product.
Baked goods are made from doughs and batters. A dough has a low water content. 
The water-protein structure known as gluten forms the continuous medium into which 
other ingredients are embedded in a dough. A dough is usually prepared by beating, 
blending, cutting or kneading and is often stiff enough to cut into various shapes.

M30_LABE1163_07_SE_C30.indd 947 31/10/23 9:05 PM948 chaPter thirtY
A batter generally contains more liquids, fat, and sugar than a dough. Gluten develop￾ment is minimized and liquid forms the continuous medium in which other ingredients 
are dispersed. A batter bakes into softer, moister products. A batter is usually prepared by 
blending, creaming, stirring or whipping and is generally thin enough to scoop or pour.
THE BAKING PROCESS
Many changes occur in a dough or batter as it bakes. A pourable liquid solidifies into a 
tender, light cake; a sticky mass becomes chewy cookies; a soft, elastic dough becomes 
firm, crusty French bread. These physical changes are the result of the ingredients used, 
the mixing methods employed and the effect of heat during the baking process. During 
baking, fats melt; gases form and are trapped within the dough or batter; starches, pro￾teins and sugars cook; moisture evaporates and staling begins.
By learning to control these changes, the student baker also learns to control the 
final product. Control can be exerted in the selection of ingredients and the methods by 
which those ingredients are combined as well as the baking temperature and duration. 
Batters and doughs pass through nine stages during and after the baking process. The 
stages, which are listed here, are described in the material that follows.
1 Gases Form
2 Gases Are Trapped
3 Starches Gelatinize
4 Proteins Coagulate
5 Fats Melt
6 Water Evaporates
7 Sugars Caramelize
8 Carryover Baking
9 Staling
Gases Form
A baked good’s final texture is determined by the amount of leavening or rise that occurs 
both before and during baking. This rise is caused by the gases present in the dough or 
batter. These gases are carbon dioxide, air and steam. (See Table 30.6.) Air and carbon 
dioxide are present in doughs and batters before they are heated. Air may be incorpo￾rated during the mixing process. Carbon dioxide is released as a by-product of leaveners 
used in the mixture. Steam, another gas, is created as the moisture in a dough is heated 
and yeast and baking powder release additional carbon dioxide in a hot oven. Heat 
causes these gases to expand, which leavens the product.
Gases Are Trapped
The stretchable network of proteins, either egg proteins or gluten, created in a batter or 
dough traps gases in the product. Without an appropriate network of proteins, the gases 
would just escape without causing the dough or batter to rise.
Baking Efficiently
During baking, it is important that air 
currents flow evenly around pans inside 
the oven. When loading an oven, leave 
enough room on each oven rack to allow 
air to circulate freely. to maintain the 
oven temperature, do not open and close 
the oven door during baking unless you 
must. if you must open the oven, limit the 
length of time the door remains open so 
that hot air stays inside the oven.
GASES THAT LEAVEN BAKED GOODS
Gas Present in
air all products, especially those containing whipped eggs or creamed fat
steam all products when liquids evaporate or fats melt
carbon dioxide Products containing baking soda, baking powder, baking ammonia or yeast
TABLE 30.6
M30_LABE1163_07_SE_C30.indd 948 31/10/23 9:05 PMPrinciPles of the BakeshoP 949
Starches Gelatinize
Starches are complex carbohydrates present in plants and grains such as potatoes, 
wheat, rice and corn. Flour made from these and other grains is the primary ingredient 
in most baked goods. When starch granules in a batter or dough reach a temperature of 
approximately 150°F (65°C), they absorb additional moisture—up to 10 times their own 
weight—and expand. This contributes to the baked good’s structure. (See Figure 10.3.)
Proteins Coagulate
Gluten and dairy and egg proteins begin to coagulate (solidify) when the dough or batter 
reaches a temperature of 140°F (60°C). This process provides most of the baked good’s 
structure. (See Figure 10.2.)
Proper baking temperatures are important for controlling the point at which proteins 
coagulate. If the temperature is too high, proteins will solidify before the gases in the 
product have expanded fully, resulting in a product with poor texture and volume. If the 
temperature is too low, gases will escape before the proteins coagulate, resulting in a 
product that may collapse.
Fats Melt
As solid fats melt, steam is released and fat droplets are dispersed throughout the prod￾uct. These fat droplets coat the starch (flour) granules, thus moistening and tenderizing 
the product by keeping the gluten strands short. Shortenings melt at different tempera￾tures. It is important to select a fat with the proper melting point for the product being 
prepared.
Water Evaporates
Throughout the baking process, the water contained in the liquid ingredients turns to 
steam and evaporates. This steam is a useful leavener. As steam is released, the dough 
or batter dries out starting from the outside, and the result is the formation of a crust.
Sugars Caramelize
As sugars are heated above 250°F (121°C), they begin to brown. At 320°F (160°C), they 
caramelize, adding flavor and causing the product to darken. Caramelization of sugars is 
responsible for most of the flavors associated with baked goods. Because high tempera￾tures are required for caramelization, most foods brown only on the outside and only 
through the application of dry heat. (See Chapter 10, Principles of Cooking.)
Carryover Baking
The physical changes in a baked good do not stop when it is removed from the 
oven. The residual heat contained in a hot baking pan and within the product itself 
continues the baking process as the product cools. This is why a crisp-style cookie or 
biscuit may be soft and seem a bit underbaked when removed from the oven; it will fin￾ish baking as it cools.
As a baked product cools, other noticeable changes take place. At first, these changes 
yield pleasing characteristics. Fats resolidify, causing the product to firm. Sugars recrys￾tallize, giving a pleasant crunchiness to the crust of a cookie, for example. When these 
changes become unpleasantly noticeable, a product is considered stale.
Staling
Staling is a change in a baked good’s texture and aroma caused by both moisture loss 
and changes in the structure of the starch granules. Stale products have lost their fresh 
aroma and are firmer, drier and more crumbly than fresh goods.
Water evaporates causing steam to escape 
during baking.
sugars caramelize causing crusts to brown 
during baking.
M30_LABE1163_07_SE_C30.indd 949 31/10/23 9:05 PM950 chaPter thirtY
 Staling is not just a general loss of moisture into the atmosphere; it is also a change in 
the location and distribution of water molecules within the product. This process, known 
as starch retrogradation , occurs as starch molecules cool, becoming more dense and 
expelling moisture. 
 In breads, this moisture migrates from the interior to the drier crust, causing the 
crust to become tough and leathery. If the product is not well wrapped, moisture will 
escape completely into the surrounding air. In humid conditions, unwrapped bread 
crusts absorb moisture from the atmosphere, resulting in the same loss of crispness. The 
flavor and texture of breads can be revived by reheating them to an internal temperature 
of approximately 140°F (60°C), the temperature at which starch gelatinization occurs. 
Usually products can be reheated only once without causing additional quality loss. 
 The retrogradation process is temperature dependent. It occurs most rapidly at tempera￾tures of approximately 40°F (4°C). Therefore baked products should not be refrigerated 
unless they contain perishable components such as cream fillings. It is better to store prod￾ucts frozen or at room temperature if food safety is not of concern. 
 Products containing fats and sugars, which retain moisture, tend to stay fresh 
longer. Commercial bakeries usually add chemical emulsifiers, modified shortening 
or special sweeteners to slow staling, but these additives are not as practical for small￾scale production.

 After studying this chapter, 
you will be able to: 
31. 1 understand and apply different mixing 
methods for quick breads 
31. 2 understand frying quick breads 
31. 3 explain and understand qualities of 
quick breads 
 Buttermilk biscuits, blueberry muffins, banana nut bread and currant scones are 
all quick breads. They are called quick breads because they are quick to make 
and quick to bake. With only a few basic ingredients, almost any food service 
operation can provide its customers with fresh muffins, biscuits, scones and loaf breads. 
The variety of ingredients for quick breads is virtually limitless: cornmeal, whole wheat, 
fruits, nuts, spices and vegetables all yield popular products. and the appeal of these 
products is not limited to breakfast service—quick breads are equally appropriate for 
lunch, snacks and buffets. 
 Quick breads are made with the chemical leavening agents baking soda and bak￾ing powder , which are explained in chapter 30 , Principles of the Bakeshop . This sets 
quick breads apart from breads that are made with yeast and require additional time 
for fermentation and proofing. review the material on chemical leavening agents in 
 chapter 30 , as understanding how these ingredients work is essential to successfully pro￾duce quick breads. 
 MIXING METHODS FOR QUICK BREADS 
 Quick breads are tender products, sometimes a bit flaky, but always with a soft crumb
created by minimizing gluten development. This is possible because quick bread formu￾las generally contain some type of fat, which shortens gluten strands, and wheat flour, 
which is mixed in swiftly and gently. Three mixing methods are used for preparing quick 
breads. These methods are also used for making other bakery items, such as pie crusts, 
high-fat cakes and brownies. Mastering these basic mixing techniques now will make 
your other baking experiences easier and more successful. 
 Quick breads are typically mixed by the biscuit method , the muffin method or 
the creaming method . The mixing method employed is directly related to the type 
and consistency of fat used in the recipe. Cold solid fats, such as butter, lard or vege￾table shortening, are used in the biscuit method to produce flaky products. Liquid fats, 
such as oil or melted butter, are used in the muffin method to produce moist, tender 
products. Fats that are soft but not liquid are used in the high-fat creaming method.

 Biscuits and Scones: 
A Genealogy 
Biscuit is a French word used to describe any 
dry, flat cake, whether sweet or savory. it 
was, perhaps, originally coined to describe 
twice-baked cakes ( bis = twice, cuit =
cooked). crusader chronicles, for example, 
mention soldiers eating a “bread called 
‘bequis’ because it is cooked twice” and 
still today a French product called reims 
biscuit is returned to the oven for further 
baking after it is removed from its tin. 
 Over the centuries, the French began 
to use the term biscuit generically and 
appended modifiers to identify the 
particular type of dry, flat cake. For 
example, a biscuit de guerre was the very 
hard, barely risen product of flour and 
water used from the time of the crusades 
to the era of Louis XiV as an army ration 
( guerre is French for “war”); biscuit de Savoie
is a savory spongecake; biscuit de pâtisserie
is a sweet biscuit. 
 To the British, a biscuit is what 
americans call a cracker or cookie. There 
appears to be no British quick bread quite 
comparable to the american biscuit—
the closest relative would be the scone. 
Because a scone contains eggs and butter, 
it is much richer than a biscuit, however.

Biscuit Method
The biscuit method is used for biscuits, shortcakes and scones and is very similar to the 
technique used to make flaky pie doughs. The goal is to create a baked good that is 
light, flaky and tender. Flakiness is created by coating small pieces of fat with the dry 
ingredients in a process referred to as “cutting in” the fat. Similarly, the fat may be bro￾ken up into small pieces then incorporated into the flour by rubbing the fat between 
your fingertips. As these small flour-coated pieces of fat melt and release steam during 
baking, flaky layers are created.
Procedure for Preparing Products with the Biscuit Method
1 Preheat the oven. Measure all ingredients.
2 sift the dry ingredients together.
3 cut or rub the solid fat into the dry ingredients.
4 in a separate bowl, combine the liquid ingredients, including any eggs.
5 add the liquid ingredients to the dry ingredients. Mix just until the ingredients are 
combined. do not overmix, as this causes toughness and inhibits the product’s rise.
6 Place the dough on the workbench and knead it lightly 5 or 6 times (approximately 
20–30 seconds). The dough should be soft and slightly elastic, but not sticky. Too much 
kneading toughens the biscuits. use a slow speed and a short mixing time when kneading 
biscuit dough in a mixer.
7 The dough is now ready for make-up and baking. make-up the cutting, shaping and forming of 
dough products before baking
Handle the biscuit dough gently to preserve the layers of fat in the dough. Roll the 
dough out evenly, then portion the dough using a sharp knife or cutters. Be sure to cut 
straight down without twisting the cutters. Twisting will inhibit the rise and result in mis￾shapen biscuits. Placing the cut-out dough portions close together helps the biscuits rise 
because the sides stay moist and cling together while baking.
Procedure for Make-Up of Biscuit-Method Products
1 roll out the dough on a floured surface to a thickness of ½–¾ inch (1.2–1.8 centimeters). 
Be careful to roll the dough evenly. Biscuits should double in height during baking.
2 cut dough into the desired shapes using a sharp knife or shaped cutters. Press straight 
down; do not twist the cutters, as this inhibits rise. space cuts as close together as possible 
to minimize scraps.
3 Position the biscuits on a lightly greased or paper-lined sheet pan. if placed with sides 
nearly touching, the biscuits will rise higher and have softer sides. Place farther apart for 
crusty sides.
4 reworking and rerolling the dough may result in tough, misshapen biscuits. 
Nevertheless it may be possible to reroll scraps once by pressing the dough together 
gently without kneading.
5 Brush tops with egg wash before baking or with melted butter after baking. Bake 
immediately in a hot oven.
6 cool the finished products on a wire rack.

Muffin Method
Muffins are any small, cakelike baked good made in a muffin tin (pan). Batters are pre￾pared using either the muffin method or the creaming method, described below. These 
batters can be used for any size muffin, from bite-sized miniatures to jumbo muffins. 
The same batters are also used for loaf breads. For example, banana muffin batter may 
be baked in a loaf pan to produce banana bread, provided the baking time is altered. 
A pourable, more liquid muffin method batter is used to prepare waffles, pancakes and 
crêpes, which are variations on quick breads presented in Chapter 21, Eggs and Breakfast.
When preparing baked goods by the muffin method, the goal is to produce a tender 
product with an even shape and an even distribution of fruits, nuts or other ingredients. 
The most frequent problem encountered with muffin-method products is overmixing. 
This causes toughness and may cause holes to form inside the baked product, a condi￾tion known as tunneling, illustrated in Figure 31.1.
tunneling large tubular holes in muffins and 
cakes, a defect caused by improper mixing
Figure 31.1 Properly mixed corn muffins (left) rise evenly and show no signs of 
tunneling. improperly mixed corn muffins (right) rise unevenly and have large 
irregular holes.
Procedure for Preparing Products with the Muffin Method
1 Preheat the oven. Measure all ingredients.
2 sift the dry ingredients together.
3 in a separate bowl, combine the liquid ingredients, including melted fat or oil. Melted butter or 
shortening may resolidify when combined with the other liquids; this is not a cause for concern.
4 add the liquid ingredients to the dry ingredients and stir just until combined. do not 
overmix. The batter will be lumpy.
5 The batter is now ready for make-up and baking.
Procedure for Make-Up of Muffin-Method Products
1 Grease muffin pans or loaf pans with butter, shortening or commercial pan grease. Paper 
liners may be used instead of greasing and will prevent sticking if the batter contains fruits 
or vegetables.
2 a portion scoop is a useful tool for ensuring uniform-sized muffins. Be careful not to drip 
or spill batter onto the edge of the muffin tins; it will burn and cause sticking.
3 after baking, allow muffins and loaf breads to cool for several minutes before attempting 
to remove them from the pan.
4 cool the finished products on a wire rack.

Blueberry Muffins
The batter used for these blueberry muffins is versatile and can be used to create many varieties 
of muffins. Substitute blackberries, diced apples, diced bananas, diced pears, raspberries or 
sliced strawberries for the blueberries in this batter. Omit the blueberries and stir in 3 ounces 
(90 grams) chocolate chips or diced nuts or 2 ounces (60 grams) diced dried fruit. Use 
buttermilk or coconut milk in place of the milk. After baking, the muffins can be cooled then 
glazed or dipped in cinnamon sugar. For richer, more tender muffins, increase the butter in the 
batter to 4 ounces (120 grams) if desired. The additional butter is recommended when baking 
this batter in a loaf pan.

Creaming Method
The creaming method is comparable to the mixing method used for many butter cakes. 
In fact, many butter cake recipes may be baked in muffin pans and served as muffins or 
cupcakes. The softened fat (butter, margarine or vegetable shortening) and granulated 
sugar should be properly creamed to incorporate air, which helps leaven the product 
as it bakes. The final product is cakelike, with a fine texture. There is less danger of 
overmixing with this method because the higher fat content shortens gluten strands and 
tenderizes the batter.
 Procedure for Preparing Products with the Creaming Method
1 Preheat the oven. Measure all ingredients.
2 sift the dry ingredients together.
3 combine the softened fat and sugar in a mixer bowl fitted with the paddle attachment. 
cream on low speed until the color lightens and the mixture fluffs.
4 add eggs gradually, mixing well.
5 add the dry and liquid ingredients to the creamed fat alternately. in other words, a portion 
of the flour is added to the fat and incorporated, then a portion of the liquid is added and 
incorporated. repeat these steps until all the liquid and dry ingredients are incorporated. 
adding the liquid and dry ingredients alternately avoids overmixing the batter and prevents 
the butter and sugar mixture from curdling.
6 The batter is now ready for make-up and baking. Panning and baking procedures are the 
same as those for quick breads prepared with the muffin method.

 QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION 
1 List three methods commonly used for mixing quick breads. What is the significance of the 
type of fat used for each of these mixing methods? 
2 What is the temperature used to fry quick breads? Why is it important to cook at this 
temperature? 
3 explain what happens when muffin batter has been overmixed. 
 QUALITIES OF QUICK BREADS 
 Quick breads are distinguished by their light and tender texture. Biscuits should have 
a crisp and level crust. They should rise evenly and have a light golden-brown surface. 
Muffins and loaf breads made from muffin batter should be tender without visible tun￾neling. They should rise evenly to a uniform height and be slightly domed. The outer 
surface of loaf breads should have a thin crust that remains tender. Burned edges or a 
hard crust are signs of overbaking or baking at too high of a temperature. Quick breads 
can be frozen for up to three months if well wrapped. The best results will be achieved 
by quickly freezing quick breads in a single layer using a blast chiller. Frozen products 
can then be thawed at room temperature while still wrapped. Refer to Table 31. 2 to 
troubleshoot quick bread mixing and baking.

Popovers
Popovers are crisp hollow muffins made from a rich egg batter. The steam released from the eggs and 
milk as the popovers bake is trapped in the batter’s gluten web, causing it to rise. Popovers and other 
products that rely on steam for leavening are baked at a high temperature so that the steam forms 
quickly before the gluten bond sets. Popovers resemble products baked from Éclair Paste (page 1022). 
Yorkshire pudding, a popular accompaniment to roasted rib of beef, is made from this same batter. 
Yorkshire pudding is baked in beef fat in a shallow pan and then served cut into squares.

An array of flatbreads accompanies cuisines around the world, from corn tortillas in Latin and Central 
America to chapati and naan in South Asia. Because they are made from thin pieces of dough, 
flatbreads require less energy to prepare than bulky slicing loaves. They cook quickly on a griddle, grill, 
backside of a heated wok or oven. Such flatbreads may be soft and pliable enough to use to pick up 
foods such as roti and Ethiopian injera, a sourdough flatbread baked on a griddle, for example.

Yeast Breads 32
M32_LABE1163_07_SE_C32.indd 969 28/10/23 4:00 PM970
 After studying this chapter, 
you will be able to: 
32. 1 select appropriate types of yeast and use 
yeast properly 
32. 2 perform the 10 production steps for 
yeast bread 
32. 3 prepare rolled-in doughs for making sweet 
or savory products 
32. 4 explain and understand the qualities of 
yeast bread 
 Bread making is an art that dates back to ancient times. Over the centuries, bakers 
have learned to manipulate the basic ingredients—flour, water, salt and leavening—
to produce a vast variety of breads. thin-crusted baguettes, tender Parker House 
rolls, crisp flatbreads and chewy bagels derive from careful selection and handling of the 
same key ingredients. Interest in the traditional craft of baking has led to many artisan bread 
bakeries opening in recent years. Customers are demanding, and more restaurants are 
serving, exciting bread assortments to their guests with each meal. 
 Yeast breads can be divided into two major categories: lean doughs and rich doughs. 
Lean doughs , such as those used for crusty French and Italian breads, contain little or no 
sugar or fat. traditional sourdough and rye breads are lean doughs that require special 
 handling to bring out their unique flavor. Enriched doughs , such as brioche and challah, 
contain significantly more sugar and fat than lean doughs. Laminated or rolled-in doughs , 
so called because the fat is rolled into the dough in layers, are a type of rich dough used for 
baked goods such as croissants and sweetened danish pastries. 
 this chapter covers the basic production techniques for making lean, sourdough and 
other yeast-raised products. review the discussion on the functions of ingredients found in 
 Chapter 30 , Principles of the Bakeshop, before beginning this chapter.
 YEAST 
 Yeast breads are made from dough prepared with yeast. Under the right conditions, yeast 
acts as a leavener in dough, causing the dough to rise and become less dense. Yeast is a 
living organism: a one-celled fungus. Various strains of yeast are naturally present every￾where and are an essential component to life on Earth. Yeast cells are in the air and soil, 
even in deep seas; in animal intestines and on the skin of berries and peaches; in every 
part of the world, including arctic glaciers and the Gobi Desert. Yeast feeds on carbohy￾drates present in the starches and sugars in bread dough, converting these carbohydrates 
into carbon dioxide and ethyl alcohol, in an organic process known as fermentation : 
 Yeast + Carbohydrates = Ethyl Alcohol + Carbon Dioxide 
 When yeast releases carbon dioxide gas during bread making, the gas becomes 
trapped in the dough’s gluten network. (See Chapter 30 , Principles of the Bakeshop.) 
 The trapped gas leavens the bread, providing the desired rise and texture. The small 
amount of alcohol produced by fermentation evaporates during baking. 
 Like most living things, yeast is very sensitive to temperature and moisture. It prefers 
temperatures between 75°F and 95°F (24°C and 35°C). At temperatures below 34°F (2°C), 
yeast becomes dormant; above 138°F (59°C), it dies. Table 32. 1 lists the temperatures for 
yeast development. Moisture activates the yeast cells, which then convert carbohydrates 
in the dough into carbon dioxide. 
 Salt is used in bread making because salt conditions gluten, making it stronger and 
more elastic. Salt also affects yeast fermentation. Because salt inhibits the growth of yeast, 
it helps control the dough’s rise. Too little salt and not only will the bread taste bland, but 
it will also rise too rapidly. Too much salt, however, and the yeast will be destroyed. By 
controlling the amount of food for the yeast, the salt in the dough and the temperatures of 
fermentation, bakers control the texture and flavor of yeast-leavened products. 
 Types of Yeast 
 Baker’s yeast ( Saccharomyces cerevisiae ) is available in three forms: compressed, active 
dry and instant. (Do not be confused by a product called brewer’s yeast; it is a nutritional 
supplement with no leavening ability.) Although some bakers claim their bread tastes

better when made with fresh yeast, the choice of which type of yeast to use is entirely 
up to the baker.
Compressed Yeast
Compressed yeast is a mixture of yeast and starch with a moisture content of approximately 
70 percent. Also referred to as fresh yeast, compressed yeast must be kept refrigerated. It 
should be creamy white and crumbly with a fresh, yeasty smell. Do not use compressed 
yeast that has a sour odor, brown color or slimy film. Before being added to bread dough, 
compressed yeast is typically softened in twice its weight of lukewarm water at 90°F (32°C). 
Some bakers add compressed yeast directly to the dry mix, however.
Compressed yeast is available in 1-pound (450-gram) blocks. Under proper storage 
conditions, compressed yeast has a shelf life of 2–3 weeks or it may be frozen for 
1 month. Compressed yeast that has been frozen will lose about 5 percent of its leaven￾ing ability, however, so quantities may need to be adjusted accordingly.
Active Dry Yeast
Active dry yeast differs from compressed yeast in that virtually all the moisture has been 
removed from the active dry yeast by hot air. The absence of moisture renders the organ￾isms dormant and allows the yeast to be stored without refrigeration for several months. 
Dry yeast is generally rehydrated in a warm (approximately 110°F [43°C]) liquid before 
being added to the other ingredients.
Dry yeast is available in ¼-ounce (7-gram) packages and 1- or 2.2-pound (500-gram 
or 1-kilogram) vacuum-sealed bags. It should be stored in a cool, dry place and refriger￾ated after opening.
Instant Dry Yeast
Instant dry yeast is popular because of its ease of use; it is added directly to the dry 
ingredients in a bread formula without rehydrating. The water in the formula activates 
it. Like all yeasts, instant dry yeast is a living organism and dies at temperatures above 
138°F (59°C). (See Table 32.1.) Although instant yeast can be added to flour without 
hydration, some bakers still prefer to hydrate instant yeast before using it in certain types 
of formulas. When doughs are mixed briefly or are very firm, such as bagel or croissant 
dough, instant dry yeast may not fully dissolve during mixing. In such cases the yeast 
is moistened in four to five times its weight of water before it is added to the dough. 
Deduct this amount of water from the total water called for in the formula.
Substituting Yeasts
The flavors of dry and compressed yeasts are virtually indistinguishable, but dry yeasts are at 
least twice as strong as compressed yeasts. Because too much yeast can ruin bread, always 
remember to use less than the specified weight of compressed yeast in a formula when sub￾stituting dry yeast or active dry yeast for compressed yeast. Likewise, if a formula specifies 
dry or active dry yeast, increase the quantity specified when substituting compressed yeast.

Any type of yeast may be used in the formulas in this book. Use the formulas in 
Table 32.2 to convert one type of yeast to another. Multiply the weight of the original 
type of yeast called for in the formula by the conversion factor (C.F.) listed in Table 32.2 
to obtain the quantity of the new type of yeast.
Original Type of Yeast Quantity × Conversion Factor (C.F.) = New Yeast Quantity
Old Quantity × C.F. = New Yeast Quantity
For example, if the formula calls for 2 ounces compressed (fresh) yeast and you are 
using active dry yeast instead, multiply 2 ounces compressed (fresh) yeast by 0.05, the 
conversion factor from Table 32.2, to obtain the new quantity, which is 1 ounce active 
dry yeast.
Natural Yeast Leaveners: Sourdough Starter
Before commercial yeast was available, bakers relied on natural yeast leaveners, also 
called starters, to make bread rise. Early starters were simple mixtures of flour and 
a liquid (water, potato broth, milk) left out in the open air to capture wild yeasts and 
beneficial acid-producing bacteria from the environment. Once the mixture fermented, 
it was used to leaven bread and contribute a distinctive flavor, from mild and buttery to 
sharp and tangy, to the finished product. Only a portion of the starter was used at a time. 
The rest was kept for later use, replenished or fed periodically with additional flour and 
liquid so that the yeast activity could continue. Over time and in different regions, bakers 
The Rise of Yeast Breads
How and when the first yeast-leavened breads 
came into being, no one knows. Perhaps some 
wild yeasts—the world is full of them—drifted 
into a dough as it awaited baking. Perhaps 
some ancient baker substituted fermenting 
beer for water one day. In any case, the 
resulting yeast-leavened bread was lighter and 
more appetizing.
Based on models, images and writings 
found in excavated tombs, historians are 
fairly certain that the ancient egyptians saved 
a bit of fermented dough from one day’s 
baking to add to the next day’s. this use of 
sourdough starter continues today, enjoying 
widespread popularity.
Other cultures developed their own leavening 
methods. the Greeks and romans prepared 
a wheat porridge with wine to ferment their 
doughs. the Gauls and Iberians added the 
foamy head from ale to doughs. Both methods 
resulted in lighter breads that retained their 
fresh textures longer.
since ancient times bread baking has 
been one of the first household tasks readily 
turned over to professionals. the first cooks 
to work outside homes during the Greek and 
roman empires were bakers. In europe, the 
bakery trade flourished during the Middle 
ages, and a wide variety of breads were 
produced. Yeast-leavened breads remained the 
exception, not the norm, until well into the 
17th century, however. the first real collection 
of western bread recipes is found in Nicolas de 
Bonnefons’s Les Délices de la campagne, published 
in 1654. Bonnefons’s instructions, meant for 
those dissatisfied with commercial products of 
the time, included beer yeast. By the end of the 
17th century, published works included recipes 
for breads leavened with sourdough starter and 
the yeasts used in breweries.
Louis Pasteur finally identified yeast as a 
living organism in 1857. soon after, a process 
for distilling or manufacturing baker’s yeast was 
developed. By 1868 commercial baking yeast 
was available in europe and North america.

developed numerous strategies for using natural yeast starters to create different flavors 
and textures in bread.
The making of a natural starter begins by combining equal parts flour and water 
into a wet mixture. A small amount of grapes, apple peels or orange rinds may 
be added to seed the mixture with the natural yeast spores living on these items. 
Alternatively a small amount of prepared yeast (dry or compressed) may be used 
to seed the mixture. After resting uncovered at room temperature for several hours, 
bubbles should appear on the surface, indicating that yeast activity has begun. Within 
12–24 hours, yeast activity should be noticeable and the mixture should double or 
triple in volume. Over time the starter develops a mellow flavor with some notice￾able acidity. The flavor and acidity is what gives sourdough breads their desirable 
aroma, taste and texture.
To maintain a natural starter, you must frequently replenish (feed) it with more flour 
and water so that the yeast continues to reproduce and create carbon dioxide. When 
making bread in a production bakery, feed the starter as often as every 8 hours to keep 
the yeast active. The amount of flour and water necessary to feed a starter varies, but 
never add so much flour and water that you double the mixture at one time. Yeast is 
more active in a wet starter than a dry one; add more flour when the starter will not be 
used for an extended period of time. More water is then added to the starter so that the 
yeast is more active on the day when it will be used.

refrigerator several hours before using. replenish the starter to activate the yeast cells. Once there 
is visible yeast activity in the form of large bubbles on its surface, the starter is ready to use. to 
replenish the starter, stir in equal amounts by volume of flour and warm water. allow the mixture 
to ferment at room temperature for several hours or overnight before using again or refrigerating.
Note If liquid rises to the top of the starter, it can be drained off or stirred back into the mixture. If the 
starter develops a pink or yellow film, it has been contaminated and must be discarded.

PRODUCTION STEPS FOR YEAST BREADS
The production of yeast breads can be divided into 10 steps:
1 Scaling the ingredients
2 Mixing and kneading the dough
3 Fermenting the dough
4 Punching down the dough
5 Portioning the dough
6 Rounding the portions
7 Make-up: Shaping the portions
8 Proofing the products
9 Baking the products
10 Cooling and storing the finished products
Step 1: Scaling the Ingredients
As with any other bakeshop product, it is important to scale or measure ingredients 
accurately and to have all ingredients at the proper temperature when making a yeast 
bread. Liquids such as water, milk and eggs can all be weighed to ensure accuracy in a 
formula. When a minute quantity of an ingredient is required, such as for salt and spices, 
a volume measurement is useful.
The amount of flour required in yeast bread varies depending on the humidity 
level, storage conditions of the flour and the accuracy with which other ingre￾dients are measured. Flour from different mills or from different batch lots may 
absorb more or less water depending on the type of wheat used. Flour with a 
higher protein content absorbs more liquid than one with a lower protein content. 
Even switching flour batches affects the amount of water needed in a formula. The 
amount of flour stated in most formulas is to be used as a guide. Have additional 
flour available before mixing. Experience will help you to learn when more or less 
flour is actually needed.
Step 2: Mixing and Kneading the Dough
The way ingredients are combined affects the outcome of the bread. Yeast dough 
must be mixed and kneaded properly to combine the ingredients uniformly, distrib￾ute the yeast and develop the gluten. If dough is not mixed properly, the bread’s 
appearance, texture and shape suffer. There are two common ways to mix yeast 
breads: the straight dough method (direct method) or the sponge method. 
Another method used for rich, flaky doughs is discussed later in the section on 
rolled-in doughs.
Once the ingredients are combined, the dough must be kneaded to develop gluten, 
the network of proteins that gives bread its shape and texture. Kneading helps hydrate 
the proteins, ensuring development of the gluten web, and it warms the dough to a 
temperature that keeps the yeast active. Kneading can be done by hand or with a mixer 
fitted with a dough hook.
If using a mixer, knead on medium speed for approximately 5–10 minutes. In many 
cases, the dough will clear away from the machine bowl toward the end of the kneading 
process. Kneading by hand may require more time, depending on the quantity and type 
of dough and the skill of the baker. The goal with either method is to create a dough that 
is smooth and moderately elastic. Bakers use the windowpane test to determine when 
dough is sufficiently kneaded. To do this, turn off the mixer and remove a small piece of 
dough from the bowl. Using both hands, gently stretch the dough. If it stretches without 
tearing and becomes nearly translucent (like bubble gum or a latex glove), the dough 
has reached its optimum development.

Straight Dough Method for Mixing Yeast Bread Dough
The simplest and most common method for mixing yeast dough is the straight dough 
method. With this method, all ingredients are simply combined and mixed. Once the ingre￾dients are combined, the dough is kneaded until it is smooth and elastic. Kneading time 
varies according to the kneading method used and the type of dough being produced. The 
straight dough method is illustrated by the recipe for Soft Yeast Dinner Rolls (page 980).
Sponge Method for Mixing Yeast Bread Dough
The sponge method of mixing yeast dough has two stages. During the first stage, the 
yeast, the liquid and approximately half the flour are combined to make a thick batter 
known as a sponge. The sponge is allowed to rise until bubbly and doubled in size. 
During the second stage, the remaining ingredients are added to the sponge. The dough 
is kneaded and allowed to rise again. These two fermentations give sponge method 
breads a somewhat different flavor and a lighter texture than breads made with the 
straight dough method.
Do not confuse sponge method breads with sourdough starters. The sponge method 
is often used to improve the texture of heavy doughs such as rye and some yeast doughs 
enriched with butter and sugar. Unlike a sourdough starter, a first-stage sponge is pre￾pared only for use in the specific formula and is not reserved for later use. The sponge 
method is illustrated by the recipe for Deli-Style Rye Bread (page 982).
Step 3: Fermenting the Dough
Fermentation is the natural process by which yeast converts sugar into alcohol and 
carbon dioxide. Fermentation begins the moment the dough is finished mixing and con￾tinues until the dough is baked and reaches a temperature high enough to kill the yeast 
cells, 138°F (59°C).
Fermentation also refers to the period when yeast dough is left to rise—that is, the 
time it takes for carbon dioxide gas to form and become trapped in the gluten network. 
Fermentation is divided into two stages: Bulk fermentation refers to the time the entire 
mass of yeast dough ferments and rises before the dough is shaped; proofing refers to 
the time shaped yeast products ferment and rise just before baking.
Dough develops characteristics during fermentation that enhance the taste and tex￾ture of the finished bread. As it feeds on the sugars and starches in the dough, the yeast 
converts them to flavorful enzymes and bacteria. The gluten strengthens during fermenta￾tion, ensuring that the bread holds its structure when baked. For fermentation, place the 
kneaded dough into a container large enough to allow the dough to expand, or scrape 
the dough onto a floured workbench. The surface of the dough may be oiled to prevent 
drying. Cover the dough loosely with plastic, a clean towel or other covering and place it 
in a draft-free place at a temperature between 75°F and 85°F (24°C and 29°C).

➊ to knead dough, first bring a portion of the 
dough toward you.
➋ then push the dough away with your fist. ➌ repeat until the dough is properly kneaded 
and is smooth and elastic.
M32_LABE1163_07_SE_C32.indd 975 28/10/23 4:00 PM976 CHaPter tHIrtY-tWO
Fermentation is complete when the dough has approximately doubled in size and 
no longer springs back when pressed gently with two fingers. The time necessary varies 
depending on the type of dough, the temperature of the room and the temperature of 
the dough.
 Step 4: Punching Down the Dough
After fermentation, the dough is gently folded down to expel and redistribute the gas 
pockets with a technique known as punching down. The procedure reactivates the 
yeast cells, encouraging more yeast activity. Punching down dough also helps even out 
the dough’s temperature and relaxes the gluten.
Step 5: Portioning the Dough
The dough is now ready to be divided into portions. For loaves, the dough is scaled 
(weighed) to the desired weight. For individual rolls, the dough can be rolled into an 
even log from which portions are cut with a chef’s knife or dough cutter. Weighing the 
cut dough pieces on a scale ensures even-sized portions. When portioning, work quickly 
and keep the dough covered to prevent it from drying out.
Step 6: Rounding the Portions
The portions of dough must be shaped into smooth, round balls in a technique known 
as rounding. Rounding stretches the outside layer of gluten into a smooth coating. 
This helps hold in gases and makes it easier to shape the dough. Unrounded rolls rise 
unevenly and have a rough, lumpy surface.
Step 7: Make-Up: Shaping the Portions
Lean doughs and some rich doughs can be shaped into a variety of forms: large loaves, 
small loaves, free-form or country-style rounds or individual dinner rolls. Table 32.3 
identifies common pan sizes and the approximate weight of the dough used to fill 
these pans. Free-form loaves are often placed between the floured folds of heavy 
linen canvas (couche) to hold their shape while proofing. Alternatively these loaves 
may be placed in linen-lined baskets (bannetons) or coiled willow or plastic baskets 
(brotform). These baskets hold the loaves’ shape and leave a distinctive imprint on the 
loaves when they are removed from them before baking. Some shaping techniques are 
shown in the following procedures. Other doughs, particularly brioche, croissant and 
Danish, are shaped in very specific ways. Those techniques are discussed and illustrated 
with their specific formulas.

floured and folded to hold yeast dough while it 
rises before baking
banneton [ban-a-tON] a traditional willow 
basket, often lined with canvas, in which yeast 
bread is placed to rise before baking
brotform [BrOt-form] a traditional woven 
basket in which yeast bread is placed to rise 
before baking. the basket leaves marks in the 
dough’s surface. Heavy plastic versions are 
available for commercial food service use.
Controlling Fermentation
the ingredients in the formula, the dough 
temperature and the temperature of the 
environment in which the dough ferments affect 
the total fermentation time. Bakers use different 
strategies to regulate fermentation time to 
achieve desired results.
Ingredients: dough with more yeast and 
more yeast food such as sugar ferments more 
quickly. Increasing the yeast in a formula 
increases the rate of fermentation, thus speeding 
production time. adding sugar, honey or other 
carbohydrates speeds fermentation also, 
although too much sugar can actually slow 
yeast’s activity; enriched dough formulas, those 
prepared with a high percentage of fats and 
sugars, often include a higher percentage of 
yeast for this reason.
Dough temperature: Using warmer water 
in the dough and fermenting it in a warm 
environment speeds up the fermentation 
process. Conversely, kneading the dough to 
the proper dough temperature and then letting 
it ferment in a cool environment slows down 
this process. When mixing yeast dough, keep in 
mind that during wintertime baking in colder 
climates, you may need very warm water to 
initiate yeast activity. during summertime 
baking in hot climates, you may need to use 
very cool water to prevent bread dough from 
fermenting too quickly.
Room temperature: Bakeries often extend 
the fermentation time of certain doughs 
in a specially designed refrigerator called a 
retarder. a retarder is set to maintain slightly 
lower temperatures than a standard walk-in 
refrigerator and a steady humidity of 85%. the 
cool temperature slows down yeast activity, 
giving the dough the maximum opportunity to 
develop its flavor.

2 roll the ball of dough out into a short cylinder.
3 With both hands together, roll the dough until it gradually begins to lengthen.
4 roll to the desired length.
Step 8: Proofing the Products
Proofing is the final rise of shaped or panned yeast products before baking. For most 
bread, the temperature should be between 80°F and 115°F (27°C and 46°C), slightly 
higher than the temperature for fermentation. Some humidity is also desirable to prevent 
the dough from drying or forming a crust during proofing. Temperature and humidity 
can be controlled with a special cabinet known as a proof box.
Most products are proofed until the dough doubles in size and springs back slowly 
when lightly touched. Underproofing results in poor volume and texture. Overproofing 
results in a sour flavor, poor volume and a paler color after baking. Some doughs made 
with low-protein flours such as rye or multigrains and some enriched yeast doughs should 
be proofed less, until they have expanded only 50–70 percent in volume. The weaker 
gluten structure and the heavy weight of the fats in the dough make them fragile. Proofing 
these doughs until doubled in volume can result in loaves that collapse in the oven.
Step 9: Baking the Products
As yeast breads bake, a variety of chemical and physical changes turn the dough into an 
edible product. These changes are discussed in Chapter 30, Principles of the Bakeshop. 
Because of the expansion of gases, yeast products experience a sudden rise, referred to 
as oven spring, when first placed in a hot oven. As the dough’s temperature increases, 
the yeast dies, the gluten fibers firm up, the starches gelatinize, the moisture evaporates 
and, finally, the crust forms and turns brown through the process of caramelization. 
When baked at the proper temperature, the crust develops a smooth surface free from 
blisters. To assist the rise during baking and to improve their appearance, loaves may be 
washed and/or scored before baking.
Washes
The appearance of yeast breads can be altered by applying a glaze or wash to the 
dough before baking. The crust becomes shiny or matte, hard or soft, darker or lighter 
by the proper use of washes. (See Table 32.4.) Washes are also used to attach seeds, 
wheat germ, oats or other toppings to the dough’s surface.
The most commonly used wash is an egg wash, made with whole egg and water—
usually 1 part water to 3 parts egg. Yeast products can also be topped with plain water,

hot oven, resulting from the production and

Bread Service
Offering bread automatically to 
guests has been the custom in full￾service restaurants for decades. Guests 
appreciate the gesture of hospitality and 
delight in eating bread while waiting 
for their meal. tastes change and the 
acceptance of bread varies, especially 
among those following low-carb or 
gluten-free diets. Baskets of bread often 
return to the kitchen uneaten, yet health 
codes require that it be tossed. to prevent 
such waste, some restaurants charge 
a nominal fee for bread. Charging for 
bread prevents waste because guests who 
order it do so intentionally. should guests 
accustomed to free bread complain, 
servers may offer it at no charge.

a mixture of egg and milk, plain milk or richer glazes containing sugar and flavorings. 
Even a light dusting of white flour can be used to top dough. (This is commonly seen 
with potato rolls.) Rye breads are often coated with a starch wash made from cornstarch 
cooked in water, which produces a dark shiny crust.
Washes may be applied before or after proofing. If applied after proofing, be 
extremely careful not to deflate the product. Avoid using too much wash, as it can burn 
or cause the product to stick to the pan. Puddles or streaks of egg wash on the dough 
cause uneven browning.
Occasionally a formula will specify that melted butter or oil be brushed on the prod￾uct after baking. Do not, however, apply egg washes to already baked products, as the 
egg will remain raw and the desired effect will not be achieved.
Scoring and Docking
The shape and appearance of some breads can be improved by cutting their tops with 
a sharp knife or razor (lame) just before baking. This is referred to as scoring or 
slashing. Hard-crusted breads are usually scored to allow for continued rising and the 
escape of gases after the crust has formed. Breads that are not properly scored will burst 
or break along the sides. Scoring can also be used to make an attractive design on the 
product’s surface. Some flatbreads such as pizza and crackers may be docked or pricked 
with small holes to prevent the formation of irregular air bubbles in the finished product.
Steam in the Oven
The crisp crust desired for certain breads and rolls is achieved by introducing moisture into 
the oven during baking. Steam revitalizes the yeast in the dough and keeps the surface 
of the dough soft so that it can rise fully in the oven. Steam is introduced into the oven 
in the early baking stages only. Excessive steam produces a crust that is pale and thick. 
Professional bakers’ ovens have built-in steam injection jets to provide moisture as needed. 
Steam must not be present during the final stages of baking so the bread can brown.
To create steam in any oven, spray or mist the bread with water several times during 
the first few minutes of baking, or place a pan on the oven’s lowest rack to receive hot 
water. Pour ½ – ¾ cup (120–180 milliliters) hot water into the pan just before placing the 
bread in the oven. This creates a burst of steam and a moist environment during the first 
few minutes of baking. Rich doughs, which do not form crisp crusts, are usually baked 
without steam.
Determining Doneness
Baking time is determined by a variety of factors: the product’s size, the oven thermo￾stat’s accuracy and the desired crust color. Larger items require a longer baking time than 
smaller ones. Lean dough products bake faster and at higher temperatures than enriched 
dough products.
Bread loaves are commonly tested for doneness by tapping them on the bottom 
and listening for a hollow sound. This indicates that air, not moisture, is present inside 
the loaf. If the bottom is damp or heavy, the loaf probably needs more baking time. 
The texture and color of the crust are also a good indication of doneness, particularly 
with individual rolls. Browning (caramelization) on the outside of bread flavors the entire 
loaf. A pale loaf has less flavor than a well-browned one. Yeast breads should have a uni￾form, richly burnished gold to brown colored crust. The baking times indicated in most 
formulas are estimates only and may vary depending on the equipment used. Experience 
will teach how to determine doneness without strict adherence to the elapsed time.
 Step 10: Cooling and Storing the Finished Products
The quality of even the finest yeast breads suffers if they are cooled or stored improp￾erly. Yeast products should be cooled on racks at room temperature and away from 
drafts. Yeast breads and rolls should be removed from their pans for cooling unless indi￾cated otherwise. Allow loaves to cool completely before slicing. This allows the internal 
structure to settle and evaporates any excess moisture remaining after baking.
Guidelines for 
Determining Bread 
Doneness
▪ Uniform, rich, burnished gold to brown 
crust color
▪ Hollow sound when bottom of loaf 
is tapped
▪ the internal temperature can be 
determined using an instant-read 
thermometer.
Lean dough: Internal temperature of 
190–210°F (88–99°C)
Rich dough: Internal temperature of 
180–190°F (82–88°C)
Artisan Bread
the term artisan is used to describe many 
kinds of bread, but the term is not easily 
defined because it has been adopted by 
small-scale independent bakers as well 
as industrial producers. some generally 
recognized characteristics of artisan 
bread are that they are handcrafted 
and made with high-quality, traditional 
ingredients without additives or 
preservatives. Unbleached, unbromated 
and organic flours are employed to make 
doughs that contain natural starters. 
artisan bread may be mixed and baked 
in small batches. Mixers may be used to 
prepare the dough, but rounding and 
forming is usually done by hand. the 
bread dough is allowed to rise for a long 
period at cool temperatures to develop its 
flavor. and artisan breads are often baked 
without pans, directly on the heated stone 
deck of what is called a hearth oven. 
(such ovens have floors made from stone 
or masonry on which bread or pizzas are 
baked directly.) Many of the formulas in 
this book produce artisan bread when 
made with care by those attentive to the 
craft of bread making.

Procedure for Preparing Yeast Bread
Once cool, yeast products should be stored at room temperature or frozen for longer 
storage. Do not refrigerate bread products, as refrigeration promotes staling. Do not wrap 
crisp-crusted breads, such as Italian or French loaves, as this causes the crust to soften.
Straight Dough Method
1 scale the ingredients. adjust the water to the proper temperature and rehydrate the yeast 
if necessary.
2 Combine all ingredients in a mixer fitted with a dough hook on low speed to moisten.
3 adjust the mixture with more water or flour if needed to correct dough consistency as 
described in the formula.
4 Knead the dough on medium speed to properly develop the gluten, approximately 
5–10 minutes.
5 Ferment the dough until double in size, then punch it down to release gases.
6 scrape the dough onto the workbench, and divide and portion it into uniform pieces. 
round each piece into a smooth ball, then rest before rolling into desired shapes. Make up 
the formed dough as desired.
7 Proof the dough. apply egg wash and score the dough if necessary; bake.

ROLLED-IN DOUGHS
Baked goods made with rolled-in (laminated) doughs include croissants, Danish pas￾tries and non-yeast-leavened puff pastry. (Puff pastry is discussed in Chapter 33, Pies, 
Pastries and Cookies.) The dough is so named because the fat is incorporated through 
a detailed process of rolling and folding. Products made with a rolled-in dough have a 
distinctive flaky texture created by the repeated layering of fat and dough. As the dough 
bakes, moisture is released from the fat in the form of steam. The steam is then trapped 
between the layers of dough, causing them to rise and separate.
Rolled-in doughs are made following most of the 10 production steps discussed earlier. 
The principal differences are (1) the butter is incorporated through a turning process after 
the dough base is fermented and punched down, (2) rolled-in doughs are portioned some￾what differently from other yeast doughs and (3) the portions are shaped without rounding.
Butter is often used for rolled-in products because of its flavor. Unfortunately butter is 
hard to work with because it cracks and breaks when cold and becomes too soft to roll 
at room temperature. Margarine, shortening or specially formulated high-moisture fats, 
however, can be used—sometimes in combination with butter—to reduce costs or to 
make working with the dough easier. When proofing rolled-in dough products, take care 
that the temperature does not become too hot. If the fat melts during proofing, flakiness 
will be ruined and the products will fry in their own fat in the oven.
The dough base should not be kneaded too much, as gluten continues to develop 
during the rolling and folding process. An electric dough sheeter can be used to 
mechanically roll dough out quickly to a uniform thickness. This time-saving device con￾sists of a cloth conveyor belt that moves beneath a stationary rolling pin. The height of 
the pin is adjusted to change the thickness of the product.
Procedure for Preparing Yeast-Raised Rolled-In Doughs
1 Mix the dough and allow it to rise.
2 Prepare the butter or shortening. the butter may be formed into a rectangle to be enclosed 
in the dough or it may be softened and spread on the dough.
3 roll out the dough evenly, then top it with the butter.
4 Fold the dough around the butter, enclosing it completely.
5 roll out the dough into a rectangle, about ¼ – ½ inch (0.6–1.2 centimeters) thick. always be 
sure to roll at right angles; do not roll haphazardly or in a circle as you would pastry doughs.
6 Fold the dough in thirds. Be sure to brush off any excess flour from between the folds. this 
completes the first turn. Chill the dough for 20–30 minutes.
7 roll out the dough and fold it in the same manner a second and third time, allowing the 
dough to rest, chilled, for 20 to 30 minutes between each turn. after completing the third 
turn, wrap the dough carefully in plastic wrap and allow it to rest, refrigerated, for several 
hours or overnight before shaping and baking. (additional turns may be given to this 
dough; three or four are common.)

QUALITIES OF YEAST BREAD
Bread is judged by its external and internal appearance, flavor, aroma and shelf life. 
 Well-crafted yeast bread has a pleasing uniform brown surface color. The crust is 
neither too thick nor too thin, depending on the type of formula. The crust is crisp 
or tender without being leathery and excessively thick. With the exception of long￾fermented sourdough, which may have an irregular surface dotted with bubbles, the 
crust should be uniform and free from surface blisters, which may appear when dough 
is too wet, improperly shaped, baked at a high temperature or with excess steam. The 
interior (crumb) of a tender crusted bread or enriched dough product should be even 
and moist without being sticky. A long-fermented country bread or sourdough may 
contain an irregular cell structure and large holes characteristic of this type of bread. 
Well-crafted bread has good keeping properties; improperly made bread will stale in 
a matter of hours. Table 32.5 identifies common problems when making yeast breads 
and possible solutions.

Brioche
Brioche [bree-OHSH] is a rich, tender bread made with a generous amount of eggs and butter. The 
high ratio of fat makes this dough difficult to work with, but the flavor is well worth the extra effort. 
The molded dough is washed with beaten egg or egg yolks and milk or cream before and after proof￾ing. It is important to keep the wash from touching the sides of the pan, where it could coagulate and 
prevent the dough from rising when baked. Brioche is traditionally baked in fluted pans and has a cap 
or topknot of dough; this shape is known as brioche à tête. The dough may also be baked in a loaf pan, 
making it perfect for toast or canapés.

Danish Pastries
According to baking lore, Danish pastry was created by a French baker more than 350 years ago. He 
forgot to knead butter into his bread dough and attempted to cover the mistake by folding in softened 
butter. This rich, flaky pastry is now popular worldwide for breakfasts, desserts and snacks. The dough 
may be shaped in a variety of ways and is usually filled with jam, fruit, cream or marzipan. Applying a 
sugar syrup wash to the pastries when they are hot from the oven adds sheen and flavor.

1 In a large bowl, stir together the yeast and 12 ounces (360 grams) flour. add the sugar, water, milk, 
eggs, salt, vanilla, cinnamon and melted butter. stir until well combined.
2 add the remaining flour gradually, kneading the dough by hand or with a mixer fitted with a dough 
hook. Knead until the dough is smooth and only slightly tacky to the touch, approximately 
2–3 minutes.
3 Place the dough in a bowl that has been lightly dusted with flour. Cover and refrigerate for 1 to 
1½ hours.
4 Prepare the remaining butter while the dough is chilling. start by sprinkling flour over the work 
surface and placing the cold butter on the flour. then pound the butter with a rolling pin until the 
butter softens. Using a pastry scraper or the heel of your hand, knead the butter and flour until the 
mixture is spreadable. the butter should still be cold. If the butter begins to melt, refrigerate it until 
firm. Keep the butter chilled until the dough is ready.
5 On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough into a large rectangle, about ½ inch (1.2 centimeters) 
thick. Brush away any excess flour.
6 spread the chilled butter evenly over two-thirds of the dough. Fold the unbuttered third over the 
center, then fold the buttered third over the top. Press the edges together to seal in the butter.
7 roll the dough into a rectangle about 12 inches × 18 inches (30 centimeters × 45 centimeters). 
Fold the dough in thirds as before. this rolling and folding must be done a total of six times. each 
time you roll and fold the dough is referred to as a turn. Chill the dough between turns as neces￾sary. after the final turn, wrap the dough well and retard for at least 4 hours or overnight.
8 Cut, shape and fill the danish dough as desired (see accompanying photos of turnovers, snails and 
pinwheels). Fill as desired. Place the shaped pastries on a paper-lined baking sheet and proof until 
the dough has gained approximately 70% in volume, approximately 15–20 minutes.

and fillings

33. 3 prepare a variety of cookies 
 Mention pastries to diners and most conjure up images of buttery dough baked 
to crisp flaky perfection and filled or layered with rich cream, ripe fruit or 
smooth custard. Mention pastries to novice chefs and most conjure up images 
of sophisticated, complex and intimidating work. although the diners are correct, the novice 
chefs are not. Pastry making is the art of creating containers for various fillings. taken one 
step at a time, most pastries are nothing more than building blocks assembled in a variety of 
ways to create traditional or unique desserts. 
 Perhaps the most important (and versatile) building block is the pastry dough. Pastries 
can be made with flaky dough, mealy dough, sweet dough, puff pastry, éclair dough, 
meringue or phyllo. (see table  33. 1 .) Because pies, tarts and cookies are constructed from 
some of these same doughs (principally pie dough and sweet dough), we discuss them, as 
well as pie fillings, in this chapter in the section on pies and tarts. We discuss puff pastry, 
éclair paste and baked meringue in the section on classic pastries. Cakes and frostings are 
covered in Chapter  34 , Cakes and Frostings. the cream, custard and mousse fillings used in 
some of the recipes at the end of this chapter are discussed in Chapter  35 , Custards, Creams, 
Frozen desserts and dessert sauces.
 PIES AND TARTS 
 A pie is composed of a sweet or savory filling in a baked crust. It can be open-faced 
(without a top crust) or topped with a full or lattice crust or fluffy meringue. A pie is 
generally made in a round, slope-sided pan and cut into wedges for service. A tart is 
similar to a pie except it is made in a shallow, straight-sided pan, often with fluted edges. 
A tart can be almost any shape. Round, square, rectangular and petal shapes are the most 
common tart shapes. Tarts are usually open-faced and derive much of their beauty from 
an attractive arrangement of glazed fruit, piped cream or chocolate decorations. 
 Crusts 
 Pie crusts and tart shells can be made from several types of dough or crumbs. Flaky 
dough, mealy dough and crumbs are best for pie crusts; sweet dough is usually used for 
tart shells. A pie crust or tart shell can be shaped and completely baked before filling 
(known as baked blind) or filled and baked simultaneously with the filling.

Flaky and Mealy Doughs
Dough for pie and tart crust may be made with or without sugar. Because of its low 
moisture and high fat content, dough for pie crust is usually made with low-protein flour, 
which ensures a tender product after baking. Most pies are made using an unsweetened 
pie dough that may be flaky or mealy depending on how it is mixed.
Flaky pie dough takes its name from its final baked texture. It is best for pie top 
crusts and lattice coverings and may be used for prebaked shells that will be filled with 
a cooled filling shortly before service. Mealy pie dough takes its name from its raw tex￾ture. It is used whenever a soggy crust would be a problem (e.g., as the bottom crust of 
a custard or fruit pie) because it is sturdier and resists sogginess better than flaky dough. 
Both flaky and mealy doughs are sometimes known as pâte brisée [paht bree-ZAY], 
although the French version may contain eggs. (See page 1030.) They are best for pies 
as they are too delicate for tarts that will be removed from the pan for service. Sweet 
dough, described later, is better for these types of tarts.
Flaky and mealy doughs contain little or no sugar and can be prepared from the same 
formula with only a slight variation in mixing method. For both flaky and mealy dough, a 
cold fat, such as butter or shortening, is cut into the flour. The amount of flakiness in the 
baked crust depends on the size of the fat particles in the dough. The larger the pieces 
of fat, the flakier the crust will be. This is because the flakes are actually the sides of fat 
pockets created during baking by the melting fat and steam. In flaky dough, the fat is left 
in larger pieces, about the size of peas or peanuts. In mealy dough, the fat is blended in 
more thoroughly, until the mixture resembles coarse cornmeal. Because the resulting fat 
pockets are smaller, the mealy dough crust is less flaky.
The type of fat used affects dough flavor and flakiness. Butter contributes a delicious 
flavor but does not produce as flaky a crust as other fats. Butter is also more difficult to 
work with than other fats because of its lower melting point and its tendency to become 
brittle when chilled. Hydrogenated vegetable shortening produces a flaky crust but con￾tributes nothing to its flavor. The flakiest pastry is made with lard. Because some people 
dislike lard’s flavor in sweet pies or do not eat pork products, lard is more often used for 
pâté en croûte or other savory preparations. Some chefs prefer to use a combination of 
butter and either shortening or lard. Oil is not an appropriate substitute as it disperses 
too thoroughly throughout the dough; when baked, a crust made with oil is extremely 
fragile but without any flakiness.
After the fat is cut into the flour, water or milk is added to form a soft dough. Less 
water is needed for mealy dough because more flour is already in contact with the fat 
in the dough, reducing its ability to absorb liquid. Cold water is normally used for both 
flaky and mealy doughs. The water should be well chilled with ice to prevent softening 
the fat. Milk may be used to increase richness and nutritional value. Milk will produce a 
darker, less crisp crust, however. If dry milk powder is used for convenience, the pow￾der should be dissolved in water first.
Hand mixing is best for small to moderate quantities of flaky or mealy pie dough. 
Feeling the fat being incorporated gives the chef better control over the procedure. It is 
very difficult to make flaky dough with an electric mixer or food processor, as machines 
tend to cut the fat in too thoroughly. (If a food processor is used, the mixing time 
should be brief.) Overmixing develops too much gluten, making the dough elastic and 
difficult to use. If an electric mixer must be used for large quantities of flaky or mealy 
pie dough, use the paddle at the lowest speed and be sure the fat is well chilled, even 
frozen. Refrigerating pie dough after mixing is recommended to allow the moisture to 
evenly distribute through the mixture and to firm the fat for ease of handling. The recipe 
for Basic Pie Dough on page 1006 and the recipe for Quiche Dough (Pâte Brisée) on 
page 1030 may be mixed using the following procedure.
Of Tarts and Tortes
the names given to desserts can be rather 
confusing. one country or region calls 
an item a torte while another region calls 
the same item a gâteau. the following 
definitions are based on classic French 
terms. You will, no doubt, encounter 
variations depending on your location 
and the training of those with whom 
you work.
Cake: in the United states and Great 
Britain, cake refers to a broad range of 
pastries, including layer cakes, coffee 
cakes and gâteaux. Cake may refer 
to almost everything that is baked, 
tender, sweet and sometimes frosted. 
But to the French, le cake is a loaf￾shaped butter cake with fruit, similar 
to an american poundcake with the 
addition of fruit, nuts and rum.
Gâteau (pl. gâteaux): to the French, 
gâteau refers to various pastry 
items made with puff pastry, éclair 
paste, pie dough or sweet dough. in 
america, gâteau often refers to any 
cake-type dessert.
Pastry: Pastry refers to a group of 
doughs made primarily with flour, 
water and fat. Pastry can also refer to 
foods made with these doughs or to a 
large variety of fancy baked goods.
Tart: a tart is a pastry shell filled with 
sweet or savory ingredients. tarts have 
straight, shallow sides and are usually 
prepared open-face. in France and 
Britain, the term flan is sometimes 
used to refer to the same items. (in 
spain and France, flan also refers to 
an egg custard.) a tartlet is a small, 
individual-sized tart.
Torte: in Central and eastern european 
countries, a torte (pl. torten) is a rich 
cake in which all or part of the flour is 
replaced with finely chopped nuts or 
bread crumbs. other cultures refer to 
any round sweet cake as a torte.

until the mixture resembles coarse cornmeal.
3 Gradually add a cold liquid, mixing gently until the dough holds together. do not overmix.
4 Cover the dough with plastic wrap and chill thoroughly before using.
5 remember that rerolled scraps will be tough and elastic.
Sweet Dough
Sweet dough or pâte sucrée [paht soo-KRAY] is a rich, nonflaky dough used for sweet 
tart shells. It is sturdier than flaky or mealy dough because it contains egg yolks and 
the fat is blended in thoroughly. Because more fat coats the flour, less gluten is formed, 
M33_LABE1163_07_SE_C33.indd 1006 31/10/23 9:10 PMPies, Pastries and Cookies 1007
making for a tender dough when baked. Sweet dough scraps may be rerolled once or 
twice without toughening unlike flaky or mealy doughs. Sweet dough is more cookie-like 
than classic pie dough and has the rich flavor of butter. It creates a crisp but tender crust 
and is excellent for tartlets as well as for straight-sided tarts that will be removed from 
their pans before service. Raw sweet dough may be kept refrigerated for up to 2 weeks 
or frozen for up to 3 months.
Procedure for Preparing Sweet Dough
1 Cream softened butter. add sugar and beat until the mixture is light and fluffy.
2 slowly add eggs, blending well.
3 slowly add flour, mixing only until incorporated. overmixing toughens the dough.
4 Cover the dough with plastic wrap and chill thoroughly before using.
5 scraps may be rerolled once or twice, provided the dough is still cool, nongreasy and 
pliable. if too much gluten develops, the crust will shrink and toughen.

➊ Mixing sweet dough.
➋ Packing the finished sweet dough into

Shaping Crusts
To shape crusts, roll out the dough to fit into a pie pan or tart shell (mold) or to sit on 
top of fillings. Mealy, flaky and sweet doughs are all easier to roll out and work with 
if well chilled, as chilling keeps the fat firm and prevents stickiness. When rolling and 
shaping the dough, work on a clean, flat surface (wood or marble is best). Lightly dust 
the work surface, rolling pin and dough with pastry flour before starting to roll the 
dough to prevent sticking. Roll the dough to a thickness of 1⁄8– ¼ inch (3–6 millimeters.) 
Work only with a manageable amount at a time: usually one crust’s worth for a pie or 
standard-sized tart or enough for 10–12 tartlet shells.
Roll out the dough from the center, working toward the edges. Periodically lift the 
dough gently and rotate it. This keeps the dough from sticking and helps produce an even 
thickness. If the dough sticks to the rolling pin or work surface, sprinkle on a bit more 
flour. Too much flour, however, makes the crust dry and crumbly and causes gray streaks.

Procedure for Rolling and Shaping Pie Dough
➊ dough for a typical pie crust or tart 
shell should be rolled to a thickness of 
approximately ⅛ inch (3 millimeters); it should 
be at least 2 inches (5 centimeters) larger in 
diameter than the baking pan.
➋ When you have rolled the dough to the 
desired thickness, carefully roll the dough up 
onto a rolling pin. Position the pin over the pie 
pan or tart shell and unroll the dough, easing it 
into the pan or shell.
➍ to make a double crust pie, roll the dough 
out as before, making the circle large. Press 
the dough into the pan and trim the edges 
as needed.
➌ Press the dough into the pan. For a single 
crust pie, trim the edge. Use the index finger 
and thumb on one hand and the index finger 
on the other to create a scalloped edge. Bake 
or fill as desired.
➎ roll out the remaining dough, making the 
circle large enough to hang over the pan’s edge. 
the dough may be lifted into place by rolling it 
onto the rolling pin, as with the bottom crust.
❻ seal the top crust to the bottom crust with 
egg wash or water. Pinch the top and bottom 
crust together between your fingertips or crimp 
as desired. slits or designs should be cut from 
the top crust to allow steam to escape.
M33_LABE1163_07_SE_C33.indd 1008 31/10/23 9:10 PMPies, Pastries and Cookies 1009
 Procedure for Rolling and Shaping Dough for Tartlet Shells 
➊ a typical crust for tartlets should be approximately ⅛ inch (3 millimeters) thick. it is usually 
made from sweet dough. 
➋ roll the dough out as described earlier. then roll the dough up onto the rolling pin. 
 Procedure for Rolling and Shaping Dough for Lattice Crusts 
➊ roll the dough out and line the pan as 
specified in the previous procedure. spoon or 
pour the filling into the dough-lined pan. Using 
a ruler as a guide, cut even strips of the desired 
width, typically ½ inch (1.2 centimeters). Position 
several strips of dough across the pie in one 
direction. For the traditional lattice shown here, 
the strips of dough should all be the same width 
and should be spaced evenly on top of the filling.
➋ Fold back every other strip of dough. Lay 
another strip of dough across the top of the 
pie, perpendicular to the first strips. Unfold the 
strips of dough, and then fold back the alternate 
strips. Lay another strip of dough perpendicular 
to the first strips. Unfold the folded strips and 
refold the alternate strips. repeat the weaving 
process until the surface of the pie is covered 
with an attractive pattern of dough.
➌ trim any overhanging dough and crimp 
the lattice strips to the bottom crust to seal. 
a small amount of water can be used to help 
attach the strips to the edge of bottom crust 
before crimping.
➌ Lay out a single layer of tartlet pans. Unroll 
the dough over the shells, pressing the dough 
gently into each one.
➍ roll the rolling pin over the top of the pans. 
the edge of the pans will cut the dough. Be 
sure the dough is pressed against the sides of 
each pan. Bake or fill as desired.
 Baking Crusts 
 Pie crusts can be filled and then baked, or baked and then filled. To retain their shape, 
pie crusts are baked blind —lined with parchment or buttered foil, then filled with baking 
(or pie) weights or dry rice or beans and baked without the filling. Unfilled baked crusts 
can be stored at room temperature for 2–3 days or wrapped in plastic wrap and frozen 
for as long as 3 months. 
 baked blind describes a pie shell or tart shell 
that is baked unfilled, using baking weights or 
beans to support the crust as it bakes 
M33_LABE1163_07_SE_C33.indd 1009 31/10/23 9:10 PM1010 CHaPter tHirtY-tHree
Procedure for Rolling and Baking Unfilled (Baked Blind) Crusts
➊ roll the dough out to the desired thickness. ➋ Place a tart ring on a paper-lined sheet 
pan. Carefully roll the dough up onto a rolling 
pin. Position the pin over the tart ring and 
unroll the dough.
➌ ease the dough into the tart ring, pressing 
to make a smooth edge.
➍ run a rolling pin over the edge of the tart 
ring to remove excess dough and produce a 
level edge to the tart. Dock the tart dough 
with a fork.
➎ Cover the dough with heat-resistant plastic, 
parchment paper or greased aluminum foil 
(greased side down). Press the plastic, paper 
or foil against the walls of the shell, allowing a 
portion of it to extend above the pan. Fill the 
pan with baking weights or dry rice or beans.
❻ Bake the weighted crust at 350°F (180°C) 
for 10–15 minutes. remove the weights 
and paper.

Crumb Crusts
A quick and tasty bottom crust can be made from finely ground cookie crumbs moist￾ened with melted butter. Crumb crusts can be used for unbaked pies such as those with 
cream or chiffon fillings, or they can be baked with their fillings, as with cheesecakes. 
Chocolate cookies, graham crackers, gingersnaps, vanilla wafers and macaroons are 
popular choices for crumb crusts. Some breakfast cereals such as corn flakes or bran 
flakes are also used. Ground nuts, spices or crushed pretzels may be added for flavor. If 
packaged crumbs are unavailable, use a food processor, blender or rolling pin to grind 
crumbs. Make sure to grind cookies or any other ingredients to a fine, even crumb.
The typical ratio for a crumb crust is 1 part melted butter, 2 parts sugar and 4 parts 
crumbs. For example, 8 ounces (240 grams) graham crackers mixed with 4 ounces (120 
grams) sugar and 2 ounces (60 grams) melted butter produces enough crust to line one 
9- or 10-inch (22- or 25-centimeter) pan. The amount of sugar may need to be adjusted 
depending on the type of crumbs. For example, chocolate sandwich cookies need less 
sugar than graham crackers. If the mixture is too dry to stick together, gradually add 
more melted butter. Press the mixture into the bottom of the pan and chill or bake it 
before filling.
Fillings
Fillings make pies and tarts distinctive and flavorful. The role of starch in pie filling 
and four types of fillings are discussed here: cream, fruit, custard and chiffon. There is 
no one correct presentation or filling-and-crust combination. The apples in an apple 
pie, for example, may be sliced, seasoned and topped with streusel; caramelized, 
puréed and blended with cream; chopped and covered with a flaky dough lattice; 
or poached, arranged over pastry cream and brushed with a shiny glaze. An under￾standing of the fundamental techniques for making fillings—and some imagination—
ensures success.
Starches for Pies
A variety of pie fillings rely on starches for stability and thickening. Even custard fillings, 
which include eggs for thickening and flavor, may contain starch to keep the filling from 
separating. The type of starch depends on the desired results.
Although flour is somewhat unreliable as a thickener, it can be used in traditional 
baked fruit pies in which the fruit is not excessively juicy, such as Pippin apples or 
Bosc pears. Cornstarch is preferred for custard and fruit fillings because it sets up into 
a somewhat firm, clear gel. However, cornstarch loses its potency when combined with 
sugar or an acid such as lemon juice, and when a pie is to be frozen, cornstarch is not 
recommended as a thickener. The gel formed by cornstarch when cooking breaks down 
during freezing. Use tapioca or tapioca starch instead. Tapioca is a good choice for fruit 
fillings because it thickens at a lower temperature than cornstarch, withstands freezing 
and cooks into a clear gel. Instant tapioca can be measured and ground into a powder 
before using. Grinding makes the tapioca disperse more readily. Modified starch made 
from corn, also known as waxy maize, can also be used for pies that must be frozen.
Cream Fillings
A cream filling is a flavored pastry cream—a type of starch-thickened egg custard dis￾cussed in Chapter  35, Custards, Creams, Frozen Desserts and Dessert Sauces. When 
used as a pie filling, pastry cream should be thickened with cornstarch so that it is firm 
enough to hold its shape when the pie is sliced. The cornstarch must be cooked long 
enough so that the starch fully gelatinizes and thickens before using. Popular cream fill￾ing flavors are chocolate, banana, coconut and lemon.
A cream filling is fully cooked on the stove top, so a prebaked or crumb crust is 
needed. The prebaked or crumb crust can be filled while the cream filling is still warm, 
or the filling can be chilled and piped into the crust later. A cream pie is often topped 
with meringue, which is then browned quickly in an oven or under a broiler.

Fruit Fillings
A fruit filling is a mixture of fruit, fruit juice, spices and sugar thickened with a starch. 
Apple, cherry, blueberry and peach are traditional favorites. The fruit can be fresh, fro￾zen or canned. (See Chapter 25, Fruits, for more information about selecting the best 
fruits for fillings.) The starch can be flour, cornstarch, tapioca or a packaged commercial 
instant or pregelatinized starch. Streusel topping is used for some pies, particularly fruit 
pies. A standard streusel recipe is given in Chapter 31, Quick Breads.
The ingredients for a fruit filling are most often combined using one of three methods: 
cooked fruit, cooked juice or baked.
M33_LABE1163_07_SE_C33.indd 1012 31/10/23 9:10 PMPies, Pastries and Cookies 1013
Cooked Fruit Fillings
Cooked fruit filling is often appropriate when the desired fruit needs to be softened by 
cooking (e.g., apples or rhubarb) or is naturally rather dry (e.g., dried apricots or rai￾sins). Canned fruits should not be used in cooked fruit fillings as they have already been 
cooked and would break down in the process. Combine a cooked fruit filling with a 
prebaked or crumb crust.
Procedure for Preparing Cooked Fruit Fillings
1 Combine the fruit, sugar and juice or liquid in a heavy, nonreactive saucepan and bring to 
a boil.
2 dissolve the starch (usually cornstarch) in a cold liquid, then add to the boiling fruit.
3 stirring constantly, cook the fruit-and-starch mixture until the starch is clear and the 
mixture is thickened.
4 add any other flavorings and any acidic ingredients such as lemon juice. stir to blend.
5 remove from the heat and cool before filling a prebaked pie or crumb crust.

Cooked Juice Fillings
The cooked juice filling method works with juicy fruits such as berries, especially when 
they are canned or frozen. This method is also recommended for delicate fruits that can￾not withstand cooking, such as strawberries, pineapple and blueberries. Only the juice 
is cooked in this process, so the fruit retains its shape, color and flavor better. Use a 
cooked juice filling to fill a prebaked or crumb crust.
Procedure for Preparing Cooked Juice Fillings
1 drain the juice from the fruit. Measure the juice and add water if necessary to create the 
desired volume.
2 Combine the liquid with sugar in a nonreactive saucepan and bring to a boil.
3 dissolve the starch in cold water, then add it to the boiling liquid while whisking to prevent 
lumps from forming. Cook until the starch is clear and the juice is thickened, about 3 
minutes.
4 add any other flavoring ingredients.
5 Pour the thickened juice over the fruit and stir gently.

Baked Fruit Fillings
The baked fruit filling method is a traditional technique in which the fruit, sugar, flavor￾ings and starch are combined in an unbaked shell. The dough and filling are then baked 
simultaneously. Results are not always consistent with this technique, however, as thick￾ening is difficult to control.

Custard Fillings
A custard pie has a soft filling that bakes along with the crust. Popular examples include 
pumpkin, egg custard and pecan pies. As explained in Chapter 35, Custards, Creams, 
Frozen Desserts and Dessert Sauces, custards are liquids thickened by coagulated egg 
proteins. To make a custard pie, an uncooked liquid containing eggs is poured into a pie 
shell. When baked, the egg proteins coagulate, firming and setting the filling.
The procedure for making custard pies is straightforward: Combine the ingredients 
and bake. However, it can be a challenge to bake the bottom crust completely without 
overcooking the filling. For the best results, start baking the pie near the bottom of a 
hot oven at 400°F (200°C). After 10 minutes, lower the heat to 325–350°F (160–180°C) to 
finish cooking the filling slowly.
To determine the doneness of a custard pie:
1 Shake the pie gently. It is done if it is no longer liquid. The center should show 
only a slight movement.
2 Insert a thin knife about 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) from the center. The filling is 
done if the knife comes out clean.

Chiffon Fillings
A chiffon filling is created by adding gelatin to a stirred custard or a fruit purée. Whipped 
egg whites are then folded into the mixture. The filling is placed in a prebaked crust and 
chilled until firm. These preparations are the same as those for chiffons, mousses and 
Bavarians discussed in Chapter 35, Custards, Creams, Frozen Desserts and Dessert Sauces.
Assembling Pies and Tarts
The various types of pie fillings can be used to fill almost any crust or shell, provided the 
crust is prebaked as necessary. The filling can then be topped with meringue or whipped 
cream as desired. Garnishes such as toasted coconut, cookie crumbs and chocolate curls 
are often added for appearance and flavor. Table 33.2 is a troubleshooting chart to be 
used when problems arise with pie making. Table 33.3 lists some popular combinations 
to use when making pies and tarts.
Storing Pies and Tarts
Pies and tarts filled with cream or custard must be refrigerated to retard bacterial growth. 
Unbaked fruit pies or pie shells may be frozen for up to 2 months. Freezing baked fruit 
pies is not recommended, but they may be stored for 2–3 days at room temperature or in 
the refrigerator. Custard, cream and meringue-topped pies should be stored in the refrig￾erator for no more than 2–3 days. They should not be frozen, as the eggs will separate, 
making the product runny.
CLASSIC PASTRIES
Puff pastry, éclair paste and meringue are classic components of French pastries used 
to create a wide variety of dessert and pastry items. Many combinations are traditional. 
Once you master the skills necessary to produce these products, however, you will be 
free to experiment with other flavors and assembly techniques.
Puff Pastry
Puff pastry is one of the bakeshop’s most elegant and sophisticated products. Also 
known as pâte feuilletée [paht fuh-yuh-TAY], puff pastry is a rich, buttery dough that 
bakes into hundreds of light, crisp layers. Puff pastry is used for both sweet and savory 
preparations. It can be baked and then filled, or filled first and then baked. Puff pastry 
may be used to wrap beef (for Beef Wellington, page 367), pâté (for pâté en croûte, 
page 873) or Almond Cream Filling (for an apple tart, page 1032). It can be shaped into 
shells or cases known as vol-au-vents or bouchées and filled with shellfish in a cream

sauce or berries in a pastry cream. Puff pastry is essential for palmiers (page 1035), napo￾leons and other French pastries.
Like croissant and Danish dough (See Chapter 32, Yeast Breads), puff pastry is a 
rolled-in dough. But unlike those doughs, puff pastry does not contain any yeast or 
chemical leavening agents. Fat is rolled into the dough in horizontal layers; when baked, 
the fat melts, separating the dough into layers. The fat’s moisture turns into steam, which 
causes the dough to rise and the layers to further separate.
Butter is the preferred fat for puff pastry because of its flavor and melt-in-the-mouth 
quality. But butter is rather difficult to work with because it becomes brittle when cold 
and melts at a relatively low temperature. Therefore, in some instances, specially formu￾lated puff pastry shortenings are used to compensate for butter’s shortcomings. They do 
not, however, provide the true flavor of butter.
Making Puff Pastry
The procedure described here for making and folding puff pastry dough is just one of 
several acceptable methods. All successful methods depend on the proper layering of fat 
and dough through a series of turns to give the pastry its characteristic flakiness and rise.
Some chefs prefer to prepare a dough called blitz or quick puff pastry. It does not 
require the extensive rolling and folding procedure used for true puff pastry. Blitz puff pas￾try is less delicate and flaky but may be perfectly acceptable for rustic tarts and galettes. A 
formula for Quick Puff Pastry is supplied in the electronic resources for this chapter.
Procedure for Preparing Puff Pastry
1 Prepare the dough base, which is referred to as détrempe, by combining the flour, water, 
salt and a small amount of fat. do not overmix. overmixing results in gluten formation, 
and too much gluten can make the pastry undesirably tough.
2 Wrap the détrempe in plastic wrap and chill for several hours or overnight. this allows the 
gluten to relax and the flour to absorb the liquid.
3 shape the butter into a rectangle of even thickness; wrap and chill until ready to use.
4 allow the détrempe and butter to sit at room temperature until slightly softened and of the 
same consistency.
5 roll out the détrempe into a rectangle of even thickness large enough to completely cover 
the butter rectangle. Uneven layers of dough will create irregular layers in the puff pastry 
after baking.
6 Position the butter in the center of the dough. Fold each edge of the dough around the 
butter, enclosing it completely so that none of the butter is exposed.
7 roll out the block of dough and butter into a long, even rectangle. roll only at right angles 
so that the layered structure is not destroyed.
8 Use a dry pastry brush to brush away any flour from the dough’s surface. Loose flour can 
cause gray streaks and can prevent the puff pastry from rising properly when baked. Fold 
the dough like a business letter: Fold the bottom third up toward the center so that it 
covers the center third, then fold the top third down over the bottom and middle thirds. 
this is the single book fold. this completes the first turn.
9 rotate the block of dough one quarter turn (90 degrees) on the work surface. roll out 
again into a long, even rectangle.
10 Fold the dough in thirds again, like a business letter. this completes the second turn. Wrap 
the dough and chill for approximately 30 minutes. the resting period allows the gluten to 
relax; the chilling prevents the butter from becoming too soft.
11 repeat the rolling and folding process, chilling for at least 30 minutes between every one or 
two turns, until the dough has been turned a total of five times.
12 Wrap well and chill overnight. raw dough may be refrigerated for a few days or frozen for 
2–3 months.
13 shape and bake as needed. Baked, unfilled puff pastry can be stored at room temperature 
for 2–3 days.

1 to form the détrempe, sift the flour and salt together in a large bowl. Cut the cold butter into small 
pieces and cut the pieces into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse cornmeal.
2 Make a well in the center of the mixture and add all the water at once. Using a rubber spatula or 
your fingers, gradually draw the flour into the water. Mix until all the flour is incorporated. do not 
knead. the détrempe should be sticky and shaggy-looking.
3 turn the détrempe out onto a lightly floured surface. knead the dough a few times by hand, round￾ing it into a ball. Make several shallow cuts in the dough. Wrap the dough tightly in plastic and 
chill overnight.
4 to roll in the butter, first prepare the softened butter by placing it between two sheets of plas￾tic wrap. Use a rolling pin to roll the softened butter into a rectangle, approximately 5 inches × 
8 inches (12.5 centimeters × 20 centimeters). it is important that the détrempe and butter be of 
almost equal consistency. if necessary, allow the détrempe to sit at room temperature to soften or 
chill the butter briefly to harden.
5 on a lightly floured board, roll the détrempe into a rectangle approximately 12 inches × 15 inches 
(30 centimeters × 37.5 centimeters). Lift and rotate the dough as necessary to prevent sticking.
6 Use a dry pastry brush to brush away any flour from the dough’s surface. Loose flour can cause 
gray streaks and can prevent the puff pastry from rising properly when baked.
7 Peel one piece of plastic wrap from the butter. Position the butter in the center of the rectangle 
and remove the remaining plastic. Fold the four edges of the détrempe over the butter, enclosing 
it completely. stretch the dough if necessary; it is important that none of the butter be exposed.
8 With the folded side facing up, press the dough several times with a rolling pin. Use a rocking 
motion to create ridges in the dough. Place the rolling pin in each ridge and slowly roll back and 
forth to widen the ridge. repeat until all the ridges are doubled in size.
9 Using the ridges as a starting point, roll the dough out into a smooth, even rectangle approximately 
8 inches × 24 inches (20 centimeters × 60 centimeters). Be careful to keep the corners of the 
dough at right angles.
10 Use a dry pastry brush to remove any loose flour from the dough’s surface. Fold the dough in 
thirds, like a business letter. if one end is damaged or in worse condition, fold it in first; otherwise, 
start at the bottom. this completes the first turn.
11 rotate the block of dough 90 degrees so that the folded edge is on your left and the dough faces 
you like a book. roll out the dough again, repeating the ridging technique. once again, the dough 
should be in a smooth, even rectangle of approximately 8 inches × 24 inches (20 centimeters × 
60 centimeters).
12 Fold the dough in thirds again, completing the second turn. Cover the dough with plastic wrap and 
chill for at least 30 minutes.
13 repeat the rolling and folding technique until the dough has had a total of five turns. do not per￾form more than two turns without a resting and chilling period. Cover the dough completely and 
chill overnight before shaping and baking.
Note the détrempe can be made in a food processor. to do so, combine the flour, salt and 
pieces of cold butter in the bowl of a food processor fitted with a metal blade. Process until a 
coarse meal is formed. With the processor running, slowly add the water. turn the machine off 
as soon as the dough comes together to form a ball. Proceed with the remainder of the formula.

Shaping Puff Pastry
Once puff pastry dough is prepared, it can be shaped by cutting it into various sizes and 
shapes. Bouchées are small puff pastry shells often used for hors d’oeuvre or appetiz￾ers. Vol-au-vents are larger, deeper shells, often filled with savory mixtures for a main 
course. Although vol-au-vent cutters may be simply round or square, special vol-au￾vent cutters are available in the shape of fish, hearts or petals. Feuilletées are square, 
rectangular or diamond-shaped puff pastry boxes. They can be filled with a sweet or 
savory mixture.
It is not necessary to work with the entire block of dough when making bou￾chées, cookies and the like. You can cut the block into thirds or quarters and work 
with one portion at a time. When making straight cuts in puff pastry, press the tip of 
your knife into the dough and cut by pressing down on the handle. Do not drag the 
knife through the dough or you will crush the layers and prevent the dough from 
rising properly.

➊ a vol-au-vent cutter looks like a double 
cookie cutter with one cutter about 1 inch 
(2.5 centimeters) smaller than the other. to cut 
the pastry, position the cutter and press down.
➋ to shape with rings, use two rings, one 
approximately 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) smaller 
in diameter than the other. Use the larger ring 
to cut two rounds. one round will be the base 
and is set aside. Use the smaller ring to cut an 
interior circle from the second round, leaving a 
border ring of dough that is placed on top of 
the base round. (save the dough ring’s center 
to reroll for tart shells or turnovers.)
Procedure for Shaping Vol-au-Vents and Bouchées
1 roll out the puff pastry dough to a thickness of approximately ¼ inch (6 millimeters).
2 Cut the desired shape and size using a vol-au-vent cutter or dough rings.
3 Place the vol-au-vent or bouchée on a paper-lined sheet pan. if you used dough rings, place 
the base on the paper-lined sheet pan, brush lightly with water, then top it with the dough 
ring; score the edge with the back of a paring knife. Chill for 20–30 minutes to allow the 
dough to relax before baking.
4 Brush with egg wash if desired and dock the center with a fork.

Procedure for Shaping Feuilletées
➊ roll out the puff pastry dough into an even rectangle, approximately ⅛ to ¼ inch 
(3 to 6 millimeters) thick. square off the edges of the dough using a pastry cutter and a 
straightedge, reserving the scraps for other uses.
➋ Using a sharp paring knife or chef ’s knife, cut squares that are about 2 inches (5 centimeters) 
larger than the desired interior of the finished feuilletée.
➌ Fold each square in half diagonally. Cut 
through two sides of the dough, about ½ inch 
(1.2 centimeters) from the edge. Cut a V, being 
careful not to cut through the corners at the 
center fold.
➍ open the square and lay it flat. Brush 
water on the edges to seal the dough. Lift 
opposite sides of the cut border at the cut 
corners and cross them.
➎ Place the feuilletées on a paper-lined sheet pan.
❻ score the edges with the back of a paring knife. Chill for 20–30 minutes to allow the dough to 
relax before baking.
❼ Brush with egg wash if desired and dock the center with a fork.
Puff pastry scraps cannot be rerolled and used for products needing a high rise. The 
additional rolling destroys the layers. Scraps (known as rognures), however, can be 
used for cookies such as Palmiers (page 1035), turnovers, decorative crescents (fleurons), 
tart shells, napoleons or any item for which rise is less important than flavor and flaki￾ness. Most puff pastry products bake best in a hot oven, about 400–425°F (200–220°C).
Éclair Paste
Éclair paste, also known as pâte à choux [paht ah SHOO], bakes up into golden brown, 
crisp pastries. Inside these light pastries are mostly air pockets with a bit of moist dough. 
They can be filled with sweet cream, custard, fruit or even savory mixtures. The dough is 
most often piped into rounds for cream puffs, fingers for éclairs or rings for Paris-Brest. 
Éclair paste may also be piped or spooned into specific shapes and deep-fried for 
doughnut-type products known as beignets, churros and crullers. This dough may also 
be flavored with cheese and sometimes herbs and spices and made into savory puffs 
known as gougères.
Éclair paste is unique among doughs because it is cooked before baking. The cooking 
occurs when the flour is added to a boiling mixture of water, milk and butter. This pro￾cess breaks down the starches in the flour, allowing them to absorb the liquid, speeding 
gelatinization. Eggs are added to the flour mixture for leavening. The dough produced is 
batterlike with a smooth, firm texture; it does not have the dry, crumbly texture of other 
doughs. This technique makes the dough puff up and develop the desired large interior 
air pockets when baked.

Procedure for Preparing Éclair Paste
1 Combine the liquid ingredients, sugar and butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to 
a boil.
2 as soon as the water-and-butter mixture comes to a boil, add all the flour to the saucepan. 
if the liquid is allowed to boil, evaporation occurs; this can create an imbalance in the 
liquid-to-flour ratio.
3 stir vigorously until the liquid is absorbed. Continue cooking the dough until it forms a ball 
that comes away from the sides of the pan, leaving only a thin film of dough on the pan.
4 transfer the dough to a mixing bowl. allow it to cool to below 140°F (60°C), then add 
the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. (this may be done in a mixer fitted 
with the paddle attachment or by hand.) the number of eggs used varies depending on the 
size of each egg and the moisture content of the flour mixture. stop adding eggs when the 
dough just begins to fall away from the beaters.
5 the finished dough should be smooth and pliable enough to pipe through a pastry bag; it 
should not be runny.
6 Pipe the dough as desired and bake immediately. a high oven temperature is necessary at 
the start of baking; it is then lowered gradually to finish baking and drying the product. do 
not open the oven door during the first half of the baking period.
7 allow the dough to bake until completely dry. if the products are removed from the oven 
too soon, they collapse. test doneness by breaking open one pastry. if the interior is moist 
and eggy, continue baking.
8 Baked éclair paste can be stored, unfilled, for several days at room temperature or frozen 
for several weeks. once filled, the pastry should be served within 2 or 3 hours, as it quickly 
becomes soggy.

2 Place the milk, water, salt, sugar and butter in a saucepan. Bring to a boil. Make sure the butter is 
fully melted.
3 remove the mixture from the heat and immediately add all the flour. Vigorously beat the dough by 
hand. Put the pan back on the heat and continue beating the dough until it comes away from the 
sides of the pan. the dough should look relatively dry and should just begin to leave a film on the 
saucepan.
4 transfer the dough to the bowl of a mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and beat it for a few 
seconds at medium speed.
5 Beat in the eggs one at a time. Continue to add the eggs one by one until the mixture is shiny but 
firm. it may not be necessary to use all of the eggs. the dough should pull away from the sides of 
the bowl in thick threads; it will not clear the bowl.

 Meringue
Meringue refers to both a basic mixture of egg whites whipped with sugar and a confec￾tion or cake baked from this preparation. Meringue texture—hard or soft—depends on 
the ratio of sugar to egg whites.
Hard meringue is made with 2 parts sugar or more, by weight, to 1 part egg whites. 
Hard meringue can be incorporated into a buttercream (page 1064) or pastry cream 
(page 1093) or used to top a pie or baked Alaska. Meringue toppings are usually placed 
briefly under a broiler to caramelize the sugar, creating an attractive brown surface.
With twice as much sugar, by weight, as egg whites, hard meringue can be piped 
into cookies, disks or other shapes and baked in an oven. A low oven temperature 
Versatile Meringue
naturally low in fat, soft meringue is 
an ideal reduced-calorie substitute for 
topping pies and filling cakes. italian 
meringue can be substituted for some of 
the whipped cream in a mousse to reduce 
the fat content. When flavored with 
vanilla or other extracts, cocoa powder, 
ground nuts or coconut, hard meringue 
bakes into a light, gluten-free cookie or 
pie shell. You can also use baked disks of 
hard meringue in place of biscuits when 
making fruit shortcakes.
M33_LABE1163_07_SE_C33.indd 1023 31/10/23 9:10 PM1024 CHaPter tHirtY-tHree
evaporates the eggs’ moisture, leaving a crisp, sugary, honeycomb-like structure. Disks 
of baked meringue made in this way can be used as layers in a torte or cake. Cups or 
shells of baked meringue can be filled with cream, mousse, ice cream or fruit. Often 
baked meringues also contain ground nuts (and are then known as dacquoise), cocoa 
powder or other flavorings. A recipe for hard meringue is on page 1037.
Soft meringue is made with 1 part sugar or less, by weight, to 1 part egg whites. 
Using a lower percentage of sugar creates a softer texture. Soft meringue can be folded 
into a mousse or Bavarian to lighten it or can be used in a spongecake or soufflé. 
Meringues with only a small amount of sugar are always soft; they do not become crisp 
no matter how they are used.
There are three methods for making meringue: common (French), Swiss and 
Italian. (See Table  33.4.) Regardless of which preparation method is used, the final 
product should be smooth, glossy and moist. (See Table 33.5.) A meringue should never 
be dry or spongelike. Review the procedure for whipping egg whites in Chapter 21, Eggs 
and Breakfast. Remember to use a clean bowl and whisk. Even a tiny amount of fat can 
prevent the egg whites from foaming properly.
Common (French) Meringue
Common (French) meringue is made by first beating egg whites to a soft foam (soft 
peaks). Granulated sugar is then slowly beaten or folded into the egg whites. The final 
product may be hard or soft depending on the ratio of sugar to egg whites.
Swiss Meringue
Swiss meringue is made by combining unwhipped egg whites with sugar and warm￾ing the mixture over a bain marie to a temperature of approximately 100°F (38°C) until 
the sugar is dissolved. The syrupy solution is then whipped until cool and stiff. The 
final product may be hard or soft, depending on the ratio of sugar to egg whites. Swiss 
meringue is extremely stable once finished but rather difficult to prepare. If the mix￾ture gets too hot, it will not whip properly; the result will be syrupy and runny. Swiss 
meringue is often used as a topping or in buttercream.
Italian Meringue
Italian meringue is made by slowly pouring a hot sugar syrup into whipped egg whites. 
The heat from the syrup cooks the egg whites, adding stability. Be sure that the sugar 
syrup reaches the correct temperature and that it is added to the egg whites in a slow, 
steady stream. Italian meringue is used in buttercream (See Chapter  34, Cakes and 
Frostings) or folded into pastry cream to produce crème Chiboust. Italian meringue may 
also be flavored and used as a cake filling and frosting, which is called boiled icing.
Baked meringue shell filled with Crème 
Chantilly, fresh berries, passion fruit and 
whipped cream is known as Pavlova, a dessert 
popular in australia and new Zealand.

COOKIES
Cookies are small, flat pastries usually eaten alone (although not singularly) as a snack 
or with coffee at the end of a meal. They are one of the United States’ best-loved foods, 
enjoyed frequently because of their versatility. Cookies may be eaten as a midmorning 
coffee break or as the elegant end to a formal dinner. Cookies also provide the finishing 
touch to a serving of ice cream, custard or fruit. Flavors are limited only by the baker’s 
imagination; chocolate, oatmeal, cornmeal, fresh and dried fruit and nuts all find their way 
into several types of cookies. Several cookie formulas are given at the end of this chapter.
Mixing Methods for Cookie Dough
Most cookies are made from a rich dough that is mixed by the creaming method used 
for quick breads and cake batters. (See Chapter 31, Quick Breads, and Chapter 34, Cakes 
M33_LABE1163_07_SE_C33.indd 1025 31/10/23 9:11 PM1026 CHaPter tHirtY-tHree
and Frostings.) However, because cookie dough contains less liquid than these bat￾ters, the liquid and flour need not be added alternately. Cookies can be leavened with 
baking soda, baking powder or just air and steam. Most cookies are high in fat, which 
contributes flavor and tenderness and extends shelf life. In cookies made with formulas 
that have a high percentage of fat and low moisture content, overdevelopment of gluten 
is usually not a problem. However, careless mixing can still produce tough and dense 
cookies. When there are eggs or liquid in cookie dough, the flour is blended in gently 
to minimize gluten development. Add-ins such as chopped nuts, chocolate and pieces of 
fruit are folded or stirred gently into the dough for this same reason.
Procedure for Mixing Cookie Doughs
1 Cream the fat and sugar together to make a lump-free mixture, to incorporate air and to 
blend the ingredients completely.
2 add the eggs gradually, scraping down the bowl frequently as needed.
3 stir in the liquid ingredients.
4 stir in the flour, salt, spices and leaveners.
5 Fold in any nuts, chocolate chips or chunky ingredients by hand.
Make-Up Methods for Cookies
Cookie varieties are usually classified by the way in which the individual cookies are 
prepared. This section describes eight preparation or make-up techniques: drop, icebox, 
bar, sheet, cut-out, piped, rolled or molded and wafer. Some doughs can be made up by 
more than one method. For example, chocolate chip cookie dough can be (1) baked in 
sheets and cut into squares, (2) dropped in mounds or (3) rolled into logs, chilled and 
sliced like icebox cookies. Regardless of the make-up method used, uniformity of size 
and shape is important for appearance and baking time. Cookies should also be evenly 
spaced on sheet pans for proper air circulation and crust formation.
Drop Cookies
Drop cookies are made from soft dough that is spooned or scooped into mounds for 
baking. Doughs with chunks of flavoring ingredients such as Chocolate Chip Cookies 
(page 1042) and Oatmeal Raisin Cookies (page 1041) are common examples. Although 
a uniform appearance is not as important for drop cookies as for other types, uniform 
size and placement results in uniform baking time. Space the dough to allow room for 
spread, which is common with drop cookies. A portion scoop is recommended for por￾tioning the dough. Drop cookies tend to be thick with a soft or chewy texture.
Icebox Cookies
Icebox cookies are made from dough that is shaped into logs or rectangles, chilled thor￾oughly, then sliced into individual pieces and baked as needed. Icebox cookies can be 
as simple as a log of chocolate chip dough or as sophisticated as elegant pinwheel and 
checkerboard cookies assembled with two colors of short dough. The icebox make-up 
method usually produces uniform, waferlike cookies with a crisp texture.
Bar Cookies
Bar cookies are made from a stiff dough that is rolled into a log, then baked. The bars 
are then cut into thick slices. Orange Almond Biscotti (page 1043) are bar cookies that 
are baked a second time after the log has been baked. This produces a dry cookie with 
a long shelf life.
Sheet Cookies
Sheet cookies are made from a dough or batter that is pressed, poured or layered in 
shallow pans and cut into portions after baking, usually squares or rectangles to avoid 
The Story of the Chip
History was made in 1930 when ruth 
Wakefield, innkeeper of the toll House 
inn in Whitman, Massachusetts, cut up a 
semisweet chocolate bar and added the 
pieces to her cookie dough. When she 
took the cookies out of the oven, however, 
she was disappointed that the pieces kept 
their shape when baked—until her first 
bite, that is.
Mrs. Wakefield contacted nestlé Foods 
Corporation, which published her cookie 
recipe on the wrapper of their semisweet 
chocolate bars. the recipe’s popularity 
led nestlé to create and begin selling 
chocolate chips in 1939.
today’s cookie maker can now choose 
from milk, white, dark, semisweet or 
bittersweet chocolate chips, along with 
mint, butterscotch, peanut butter, 
cinnamon and other flavor chips, offered in 
several sizes from a variety of manufacturers.

waste or scraps. This category contains a wide variety of layered or fruit-filled cook￾ies. Often a short dough such as that used for a fruit tart or shortbread cookie forms 
the base of the bar cookies, and then a topping is layered on the cookie before or 
after baking. (See Lemon or Lime Bars, page 1044.) Brownies, sometimes considered 
a sheet cookie, have more in common with cakes and are discussed in Chapter 34, 
Cakes and Frostings.
Cut-Out Cookies
Cut-out cookies are made from a firm dough that is rolled out into a sheet and then cut 
into various shapes before baking. A seemingly infinite selection of cookie cutters is 
available, or you can use a paring knife or pastry wheel to cut the dough into desired 
shapes. Always start cutting cookies from the edge of the dough, working inward. Cut 
the cookies as close to each other as possible to avoid scraps. Cut-out cookies are usu￾ally baked on an ungreased pan to prevent the dough from spreading.
Sliced nuts, coarse granulated sugar or other garnishes can be pressed into the cookie 
dough before baking. Doing this as soon as the cookies are rolled helps ensure that the 
ingredients adhere to the surface. After baking, cut-out cookies are sometimes decorated 
with sugar glaze or colored frostings, an especially popular bakery offering during holi￾day seasons. (See Sugar Cookies, page 1046.) Ice cookies only after they have cooled 
completely. Decorative icing should not be applied to cookies that will be frozen; it is 
best to ice those closer to service.
Piped Cookies
Also referred to as bagged or spritz cookies, piped cookies are made with a soft dough 
that is forced through a pastry tip or cookie press. Piped cookies are usually small, with 
a distinct, decorative shape. The task of piping out dozens of identical cookies may seem 
daunting, but the skill can be mastered with practice and an understanding of doughs. 
Doughs for piped cookies often use eggs as their only liquid. Eggs, which firm and 
thicken, contribute body and help the cookies retain their shape. Using too much fat or 
flour that is too soft (i.e., one low in protein) can cause the cookies to spread and lose 
their shape.
Rolled or Molded Cookies
Rolled or molded cookies are made from stiff dough that is hand-shaped into spheres, 
crescents or other traditional shapes. Most drop cookies can also be rolled or molded. 
Often shortbread cookie dough is pressed into decorative carved molds before baking. 
Dough for molding is firm and dry so that it holds its shape and keeps the impres￾sion intact during baking. Traditional European gingerbread cookies and Scandinavian 
springerle cookies are molded cookies.

 Wafer Cookies 
 Wafer cookies are extremely thin and delicate. They are made with a thin batter that is 
poured or spread onto a baking sheet and baked. While still hot, the wafer is molded into 
a variety of shapes. The most popular shapes are the tightly rolled cigarette, the curved 
tuile and the cup-shaped tulipe. Wafer batter, also known as stencil batter , is sweet and 
buttery and may be flavored with citrus zest, herbs, ground pepper or ground nuts. 
 Storing Cookies 
 Most cookies can be stored for up to 1 week in an airtight container. Do not store crisp 
cookies and soft cookies in the same container, however. The crisp cookies will absorb 
moisture from the soft cookies, ruining the texture of both. Do not store strongly fla￾vored cookies, such as spice, with those that are milder, such as shortbread. 
 Most cookies freeze well if wrapped airtight to prevent moisture loss or freezer burn. 
Raw dough can also be frozen, either in bulk or shaped into individual portions. 
 The textures associated with cookies—crispness, softness, chewiness or spread—are 
affected by various factors, including the ratio of ingredients in the dough, the oven’s 
temperature and the pan’s coating. Understanding these factors allows you to adjust for￾mulas or techniques to achieve the desired results described in Table  33. 6 .

Additional Pie, Pastry 
and Cookie Formulas
Several of the formulas in the following pages are combinations of the pastry items pre￾sented in this chapter and the creams, custards and other dessert products covered in 
other chapters. For example, the Chocolate Eclairs are made with éclair paste discussed 
in this chapter and the Vanilla Pastry Cream discussed in Chapter 35, Custards, Creams, 
Frozen Desserts and Dessert Sauces. As a student, you should first learn to prepare a 
variety of pastry components. You can then combine and assemble them appropriately 
into both classic and modern desserts.

Dough:
Unsalted butter 8 oz. 240 g 100%
All-purpose flour 8 oz. 240 g 100%
Salt 0.2 oz. (1 tsp.) 6 g 2.5%
Water, ice cold 3 fl. oz. 90 ml 37.5%
Total dough weight: 1 lb. 3 oz. 576 g 240%
Filling:
Apples, peeled, cored, large dice 1 lb. 480 g
Unsalted butter 1 oz. 30 g
Granulated sugar 2 oz. 60 g
Cinnamon, ground 0.02 oz. (¼ tsp.) 0.5 g
Vanilla extract 0.5 fl. oz. (1 Tbsp.) 15 ml
Apple brandy 2 fl. oz. 60 ml
Egg wash as needed as needed
Sanding sugar as needed for garnish
Ice cream and Caramel Sauce (page 1108) as needed for garnish
1 to prepare the dough, cut the butter into medium dice and place it in the freezer for 5 minutes. sift 
the flour with the salt. toss the butter with the flour and salt and place the mixture in the bowl of a 
food processor. Pulse until the butter chunks are the size of very small peas. drizzle in the ice water 
and pulse just until the dough barely comes together. do not overmix.
2 turn the dough out onto a work surface. Press it together gently and quickly, then divide the dough 
into four rounds. Place the rounds on a sheet pan, cover them with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 
approximately 20 minutes before rolling out.
3 to prepare the filling, heat a sauté pan over high heat, add the apples and let them brown slightly. 
add the butter and let it melt so that it loosens and frees the apples from the bottom of the pan. 
then cook for approximately 1 minute, add the sugar and let it brown, stirring occasionally. add 
the cinnamon and vanilla extract. add the apple brandy and flambé. Cool the filling before assem￾bling the pies.
4 on a floured surface, roll out each round of dough into a circle approximately 8 inches (20 centi￾meters) in diameter. Place an appropriate-size plate or other circular object on top of the rolled-out 
dough and cut out a circle.
5 Place one-quarter of the apple filling in the center of each dough round, leaving 1½ inches 
(3.7 centimeters) of dough exposed along the edges. Brush the dough with egg wash and then fold 
the border over the filling in approximately five or six folds, each fold slightly overlapping the previ￾ous one. Place the pies on a sheet pan and brush additional egg wash over the surface. sprinkle 
with sanding sugar.
6 Place the pies in the freezer until frozen. (Freezing will help prevent the butter running from the 
crust during baking.)
7 Bake the frozen pies at 400°F (200°C), rotating them occasionally. Bake until the apples are tender 
and the crust is evenly browned, approximately 20 minutes. serve warm or at room temperature, 
dusted with powdered sugar and accompanied by whipped cream or ice cream and Caramel sauce 
(page 1108).

 Safety Alert
Cooking with Alcohol
When alcohol comes into contact with 
a flame, it can ignite. to avoid singed 
eyebrows and kitchen fires, be careful 
when adding wine, brandy, liqueurs or 
liquor to a dish on or near the stove. 
often a dish will require flaming or 
flambéing, which means igniting the 
brandy, rum or other liquor so that the 
alcohol burns off and the flavor of the 
liquor is retained. When a dish calls for 
flambéing, stand away from the pan 
being flamed and tilt the pan away from 
you before putting a match to the liquid, 
as the flames can leap from the pan, 
igniting anything they contact.

 Cakes are popular in most bakeshops because a wide variety of finished products 
can be created from only a few basic cake, filling and frosting formulas. Many 
of these components can even be made in advance and assembled into finished 
desserts as needed. Cakes are also popular because of their versatility. Cake can be served 
from unadorned sheets in a high-volume cafeteria or as the elaborate centerpiece of a 
wedding buffet. 
 Cake making need not be difficult or intimidating, but it does require an understand￾ing of ingredients and mixing methods. this chapter begins by explaining how typical cake 
ingredients interact. each of the traditional mixing methods is then explained and illus￾trated with a formula. information on panning batters, baking temperatures, determining 
doneness and cooling methods follows. the second portion of this chapter presents mixing 
methods and formulas for a variety of frostings and icings. the third section covers cake 
assembly and  presents some simple and commonly used cake-decorating techniques. a 
selection of popular cake formulas concludes the chapter. 
 CAKE INGREDIENTS 
 Most cakes are created from liquid batters with high fat and sugar contents. The baker’s 
job is to combine all the ingredients to create a structure that will support these rich 
ingredients yet keep the cake as light and delicate as possible. As with other baked 
goods, it is impossible to taste a cake until it is fully cooked and too late to alter the 
formula. Therefore it is extremely important to study any formula before beginning and 
to follow it with particular care and attention to detail. 
 Good cakes begin with high-quality ingredients (see Chapter 30 , Principles of the 
Bakeshop) ; however, even the finest ingredients must be combined in the proper bal￾ance. Too much flour and the cake may be dry; too much egg and the cake may be 
tough and hard. Changing one ingredient may necessitate a change in one or more of 
the other ingredients. Cake ingredients should be at room temperature, approximately 
70°F (21°C), before mixing begins. If one ingredient is too cold or too warm, it may 
affect the batter’s ability to trap and hold the gases necessary for the cake to rise. 
 Each cake ingredient performs a specific function and has a specific effect on the final 
product. Cake ingredients can be classified by function as tougheners, tenderizers, 
moisteners, driers, leaveners and flavorings . In the following list, we explain the 
role of each of these classes of ingredients. Some ingredients fulfill more than one of 
these functions. For example, eggs contain water, so they are moisteners, and they con￾tain protein, so they are tougheners. Understanding the function of various ingredients 
can help you understand why cakes are made in particular ways and why a preparation 
sometimes fails. With additional experience you will be able to recognize and correct 
flawed formulas, which is the first step toward developing your own cake formulas. 
Tougheners: Flour, milk and eggs contain protein. Protein provides structure and 
strengthens the cake once it is baked. Too little protein and the cake may collapse; 
too much protein and the cake may be tough and coarse-textured. 
Tenderizers: Sugar, fats and egg yolks interfere with the development of the gluten 
structure when the cake is mixed. They shorten the gluten strands, making the cake 
tender and soft. These tenderizing ingredients also improve the cake’s keeping qualities. 
Moisteners: Liquids such as water, milk, juice and eggs add moisture to the mixture. 
Moisture is necessary for gluten formation and starch gelatinization, as well as for 
improving the cake’s keeping qualities. 
Driers: Flour, starches and milk solids absorb moisture, giving body and structure to 
the cake. 
M34_LABE1163_07_SE_C34.indd 1050 01/11/23 7:48 PMCakes and Frostings 1051
Leaveners: The cake rises because gases in the batter expand when heated. Cakes 
are leavened by air that is trapped when fat and sugar are creamed together, by 
carbon dioxide released from baking powder and baking soda and by air trapped 
in beaten eggs. All cakes rely on natural leaveners—steam and air—to create the 
proper texture and rise.
Flavorings: Flavorings such as extracts, cocoa, chocolate, spices, salt, sugar and 
butter provide the cake with flavor. Acidic flavoring ingredients such as sour cream, 
chocolate and fruit also provide the acid necessary to activate baking soda.
MIXING METHODS FOR CAKES
Even the finest ingredients cannot make a good cake if the batter is not mixed correctly. 
When mixing any cake batter, the goals are to combine the ingredients uniformly, incor￾porate air cells and develop the proper texture. Cake batters and the cakes made from 
them are divided into two categories: high fat (in which the structure relies primarily on 
creamed fat) and whipped egg (in which the structure relies primarily on egg foam). 
Within these broad categories are several mixing methods for different types of cakes. 
High-fat cakes include butter cakes mixed using the creaming method and high-ratio 
cakes mixed using the two-stage method. Whipped-egg cakes include genoise, sponge￾cakes, angel food cakes and chiffon cakes mixed using the egg foam method. (See 
Table 34.1.) Although certain general procedures are used to prepare each cake type, 
numerous variations exist. Certain European-style cake formulas include both high-fat and 
whipped-egg mixing techniques. Sacher Torte (page 1085), for example, is made from a 
creamed-fat batter into which whipped egg whites are folded before baking. Follow spe￾cific formula instructions precisely.
High-Fat Cakes
High-fat cakes include most of the popular American-style cakes: poundcakes, layer 
cakes, coffeecakes and even brownies. All are based on high-fat formulas, and most con￾tain chemical leaveners. A good high-fat cake has a fine grain, cells of uniform size and a 
crumb that is moist rather than crumbly. Crusts should be thin and tender. High-fat cakes 
can be divided into two classes: creaming method and two-stage method.
Creaming Method
Creaming method cakes, also known as butter cakes, begin with softened butter or 
shortening creamed to incorporate air cells. Proper creaming ensures a fine even crumb 
and uniform rise, although because of their high fat content, these cakes usually also 
need the assistance of a chemical leavener to achieve the proper rise.
Modern-day butter cakes—the classic American layer cakes, popular for birthdays 
and special occasions—are made with the creaming method. These cakes are tender yet 
sturdy enough to handle rich buttercreams or fillings. High-fat cakes are too soft and 
delicate, however, to use for roll cakes or to slice into extremely thin layers.
Creaming fat leavens the cake and creates a mixture in which fats and liquid are sus￾pended. Air cells are trapped in the fat, lightening the mixture. As eggs are mixed into 
the creamed fat, the mixture emulsifies. In an emulsion fats and liquids, which normally 
do not blend, are held in suspension. This emulsification ensures that the batter will hold 
the additional liquids and flour necessary to produce the desirable cake texture.
All ingredients should be at room temperature, 70°F (21°C), for effective creaming. 
The fat should be creamed at low to moderate speeds to prevent raising its temperature. 
An increased temperature could result in fewer air cells. Add eggs slowly to maintain the 
emulsion formed when the sugar and butter were creamed. A poorly emulsified batter 
curdles and does not hold the air cells that are required for proper leavening. The result is 
a heavy, dense cake. Flour must be added in stages, alternately with the liquid. This allows 
the flour and liquid to be absorbed evenly and prevents overdevelopment of gluten.
Poundcakes
Poundcakes are the original high-fat, 
creaming method cake. they are called 
poundcakes because early formulas 
specified one pound each of butter, eggs, 
flour and sugar. Poundcakes should have 
a close grain and compact texture but 
should still be very tender. they should be 
neither heavy nor soggy.
as bakers experimented with 
poundcake formulas, they reduced the 
amount of eggs and fat, substituting 
milk instead. these changes led to the 
development of the modern butter cake, 
which has a lighter texture that is more 
suitable for layering, filling and coating 
with buttercream icing or fondant.
the two containers hold equal weights of 
butter. the volume of the butter increases when 
creamed thoroughly (right) but expands very 
little when creamed insufficiently (left).

Two-Stage Mixing Method
Commercial bakeries often use a special two-stage mixing method to prepare large 
quantities of a very liquid cake batter with high sugar content. These formulas require 
special emulsified shortenings to help give the cake its structure. They are known as 
two-stage cakes because the liquids are added in two stages or portions. If emulsified 
shortenings are not available, do not substitute all-purpose shortening or butter, as those 
fats cannot absorb the large amounts of sugar and liquid in the formula.
Because they contain a high ratio (percentage) of sugar and liquid to flour, these 
cakes are often known as high-ratio cakes. They have a very fine, moist crumb and rela￾tively high rise. High-ratio cakes can be used interchangeably with modern butter cakes 
and are most common in high-volume bakeries. A formula for High-Ratio Yellow Cake is 
supplied in the online resources for this chapter.
Whipped-Egg Cakes
Cakes based on whipped-egg foams include European-style genoise as well as sponge￾cakes, angel food cakes and chiffon cakes. Some whipped-egg cake formulas contain 
chemical leaveners, but the air whipped into the whole eggs or egg whites is the primary 
leavening agent. Egg-foam cakes contain little or no fat. Genoise and spongecake are pli￾able; moisture in the eggs develops the protein in the flour, making these cakes springy 
and elastic. They are well suited for rolling, as for a Swiss Jelly Roll (page 1057), or for 
cutting into thin layers or using to line a torte ring.
 Genoise
Genoise is the classic European-style cake. It is based on whole eggs whipped with 
sugar until very light and fluffy. Chemical leaveners are not used. Slightly warming 
the egg mixture helps improve the volume of the egg foam. For flavor and moisture, 
a small amount of oil or melted butter is sometimes added to the batter after mixing. 
Genoise to which fat is added after mixing bakes into a cake that is more tender than 
a plain genoise because the fat helps shorten gluten strands. Often genoise is baked 
in a thin sheet and layered with buttercream, puréed fruit, jam or chocolate filling to 
emulsified shortening a vegetable-oil-based 
shortening made with additional emulsifiers 
(mono- and diglycerides), used to make 
cake batters containing higher than normal 
amounts of water and sugar; also referred to 
as icing shortening, cake shortening or high￾ratio shortening

Spongecakes
Spongecakes (Fr. biscuits) are made with separated eggs. A batter is prepared with 
egg yolks and other ingredients, and then egg whites are whipped with a portion 
of the sugar to firm but not dry peaks and folded into the batter. Spongecakes are 
leavened primarily with air, but baking powder may be included in the formula. 
As with genoise, oil or melted butter may be folded in, if desired, to add flavor 
and moisture.
Spongecakes are extremely versatile. They can be soaked with sugar syrup or a 
liqueur and assembled with buttercream as a traditional layer cake. Or they can be sliced 
thinly and layered, like genoise, with a jam, custard, chocolate or cream filling.

Angel Food Cakes
Angel food cakes are tall, light cakes made without fat and leavened with a large quan￾tity of whipped egg whites. Care must be taken when whipping egg whites because egg 
whites will not foam properly if grease or egg yolk is present in the mixing bowl. Angel 
food cakes are traditionally baked in ungreased tube pans, but large loaf pans can also 
be used. The pans are left ungreased so that the batter can cling to the sides as it rises. 
The cake pans should be inverted as soon as they are removed from the oven and the 
cakes left in the pan to cool. This technique allows gravity to keep the cakes from col￾lapsing or sinking as they cool.
Although they contain no fat, angel food cakes are not low in calories, as they contain 
a high percentage of sugar. The classic angel food cake is pure white, but flavorings, 
ground nuts or cocoa powder may be added for variety. Although angel food cakes are 
usually not frosted, they may be topped with a fruit-flavored or chocolate glaze. They are 
often served with fresh fruit, fruit compote or whipped cream.

Chiffon Cakes
Although chiffon cakes are similar to angel food cakes in appearance and texture, the 
addition of egg yolks and vegetable oil makes them moister and richer. Chiffon cakes are 
leavened with whipped egg whites but may contain baking powder as well. Like angel 
food cakes, chiffon cakes are baked in an ungreased pan to allow the batter to cling 
to the pan as it rises. Chiffon cakes can be frosted with a light buttercream or whipped 
cream or topped with a glaze. Lemon and orange chiffon cakes are the most traditional, 
but formulas may include chocolate, nuts or other flavorings.

A Hollywood Classic
Chiffon cake is one of the few desserts 
whose history can be traced with absolute 
certainty. according to gerry schremp in 
her book Kitchen Culture: Fifty Years of Food 
Fads, a new type of cake was invented 
by Henry Baker, a California insurance 
salesman, in 1927. dubbed chiffon, it 
was as light as angel food and as rich as 
poundcake. For years he kept the formula 
a secret, earning fame and fortune by 
selling his cakes to Hollywood restaurants. 
the cake’s secret ingredient—vegetable oil—
became public knowledge in 1947 when 
Baker sold the formula to general Mills, 
which promoted it on packages of cake 
flour. Chiffon cakes, in a variety of flavors, 
became extremely popular nationwide.

PANNING, BAKING AND COOLING CAKES
Proper panning, baking and cooling of cakes ensures a high-quality final product. Pans 
must be prepared to prevent cakes from sticking during baking. When pans are filled 
with the correct amount of batter, they rise evenly without spilling over the edges. 
Baking temperatures depend upon the type of batter used as well as the altitude. Cakes 
may crack or shrink after baking, a problem avoided when they are cooled correctly. 
Methods for panning, baking and cooling cakes are described here.
Preparing Cake Pans
To prevent cakes from sticking, baking pans may be greased, lined with parchment paper 
or both before baking. Pans should be prepared before the batter is mixed so that they 
may be filled and the cakes baked as soon as the batter is finished. If the batter stands 
while the pans are prepared, air cells within the batter will deflate and volume may be lost.
Solid shortening is better than butter for coating pans because it does not contain 
any water; butter and margarine contain water, which may cause the cake to stick. Solid 
shortening is also less expensive, tasteless and odorless. Finally, solid shortening does 
not burn as easily as butter, and it holds a dusting of flour better.
Pan release sprays are useful but must be applied carefully and completely. Although 
relatively expensive, sprays save time and are particularly effective when used with 
parchment pan liners.
In kitchens where a great deal of baking is done, quantities of pan coating are kept 
available for use as needed. Pan coating is a well-blended mixture of equal parts veg￾etable oil, solid shortening and bread flour that can be applied to cake pans with a pastry 
brush. It is used whenever pans need to be greased and floured. Pan coating will not 
leave a white residue on the cake’s crust, as a dusting of flour often does. Apply pan 
coating sparingly; a thick coating may leave a discernible taste. Pan coating is appropriate 
for those breads and cakes that need to be baked in a greased container. A formula for it 
appears in the online resources for this chapter. Table 34.2 lists various pan preparations.
Filling Cake Pans
Pans should be filled no more than one-half to two-thirds full. This allows the batter to 
rise during baking without spilling over the edges. If batter is divided between pans, 
the pans should be filled to uniform depths. High-fat and egg-foam cake batters can 
be ladled into pans according to weight. High-ratio cake batter is so liquid that it can 
be measured by volume and poured. Filling the pans uniformly prevents both uneven 
layers and over- or underfilled pans. If when baking three layers to be stacked for one 
presentation, the amount of batter is different in each pan, the baking times will vary and 
the final product will be uneven. Table 34.3 lists average quantities of batter needed to 
fill standard-sized baking pans.
Cake batter should always be spread evenly in the pan. Use an offset spatula. Do not 
work the batter too much, however, as this destroys air cells and prevents the cake from 
rising properly.

Baking Temperatures
Most butter cakes are baked at temperatures between 325°F and 375°F (160°C and 
190°C). The temperature must be high enough to create steam within the batter and 
cause that steam and other gases in the batter to expand and rise quickly. If the tem￾perature is too high, however, the cake may rise unevenly and the crust may burn 
before the interior is completely baked. The temperature must also be low enough 
so that the batter can set or firm completely and evenly without drying out. If the 
temperature is too low, however, the cake will not rise sufficiently and may dry out 
before baking completely. Delicate egg-foam cakes and spongecakes may be baked 
at slightly higher temperatures than butter cakes when panned in thin layers. Always 
preheat the oven before preparing the batter. If the finished batter must wait while 
the oven reaches the correct temperature, valuable leavening will be lost and the cake 
will not rise properly.
If no temperature is given in a formula or the dimensions of the baking pans being 
used are different from those specified, use common sense in setting the oven tem￾perature. In general the larger the surface area, the higher the temperature. Tall cakes, 
such as Bundt or tube cakes, should be baked at a lower temperature than thin layer or 
sheet cakes. Tube or loaf cakes take longer to bake than thin sheet cakes. Butter cakes, 
because they contain more liquid, take longer to bake than genoise or spongecake.
Altitude Adjustments for Baking
As discussed in Chapter 10, Principles of Cooking, altitude affects the temperatures at 
which foods cook. The decreased atmospheric pressure at altitudes above 3000 feet 
(914 meters) affects the creation of steam and the expansion of hot air in dough and cake 
batters. These factors must be considered when making cakes. Because gases expand 
more easily at higher altitudes, cakes and breads may rise so much that their structure 
cannot support the increased volume, and the bread or cake collapses.
*Quantities given are approximate and are based on filling the pans two-thirds full of batter. the weight of cake batter needed to properly fill a pan varies depending on the type of batter, 
additional flavor ingredients and the amount of air incorporated during mixing.

Therefore the amount of leavening should be decreased at higher altitudes. Chemical 
leaveners should usually be reduced by one-third at 3500 feet (1067 meters) and by 
 two-thirds at altitudes over 5000 feet (1524 meters). Eggs should be underwhipped to 
avoid incorporating too much air, which would also create too much rise. For yeast￾leavened products, bake them before they are fully proofed, or reduce the yeast by 
20 percent when baking over 5000 feet (1524 meters). In general, oven temperatures 
should also be increased by 25°F (14°C) at altitudes over 3500 feet to help set the 
product’s structure rapidly.
Because the boiling point decreases at higher altitudes, more moisture evaporates 
from baked goods in the oven. This may cause dryness and an excessive proportion of 
sugar, which shows up as white spots on a cake’s surface. Correct this by reducing every 
8 ounces (240 grams) sugar by ½ ounce (15 grams) at 3000 feet (914 meters) and by 
1½ ounces (45 grams) at 7000 feet (2134 meters).
Attempting to adjust typical (i.e., sea-level) formulas for high altitudes is some￾what risky, especially in a commercial operation. Furthermore different types of baked 
goods will need different adjustment techniques. Try to find and use formulas devel￾oped especially for the area where the baking is taking place, or contact the local 
offices of the region’s state department of agriculture or the agricultural extension 
service for detailed assistance.
Determining Doneness of Cakes
In addition to following the baking time suggested in a formula, several simple tests can 
be used to determine doneness. Whichever tests are used, avoid opening the oven door 
to check the cake’s progress. Cold air or a drop in oven temperature can cause the cake 
to fall. Use a timer to note the minimum suggested baking time. Then, and only then, 
should the following tests be used to evaluate the cake’s doneness:
•	 Appearance: The cake’s surface should be a light to golden brown. Unless noted 
otherwise in the formula, the edges should just begin to pull away from the pan. 
The cake should not jiggle or move beneath its surface.
•	 Touch: When you touch the cake lightly with your finger, it should spring back 
quickly without feeling soggy or leaving an indentation.
•	 Cake tester: If appearance and touch indicate that the cake is done, test the 
interior by inserting a toothpick, bamboo skewer or metal cake tester into the 
cake’s center. With most cakes, the tester should come out clean. If wet crumbs 
cling to the tester, the cake probably needs to bake a bit longer.
Follow specific guidelines provided in the formula. For example, some flourless cakes 
are fully baked even though a cake tester does not come out clean. Table 34.4 lists some 
common problems when making cakes and how to avoid them.
Cooling Cakes
Generally a cake is allowed to cool 10–15 minutes in its pan, set on a cooling rack, after 
taking it out of the oven. This helps prevent the cake from cracking or breaking when 
it is removed from its pan. To remove the partially cooled cake from its pan, run a thin 
knife or spatula blade between the pan and the cake to loosen it. Place a wire rack, 
piece of clean cardboard or sheet pan over the cake and invert. Then remove the pan. 
The cake can be left upside down to cool completely or inverted again to cool top side 
up. Wire racks are preferred for cooling cakes because they allow air to circulate, speed￾ing the cooling process and preventing steam from making the cake soggy.
Angel food and chiffon cakes should be turned upside down in their pans immedi￾ately after they are removed from the oven and left to cool completely in their pans to 
prevent the cake from collapsing or shrinking. The top of the pan should not touch the 
countertop, so that air can circulate under the inverted pan.
All cakes should be left to cool away from drafts or air currents that may cause them 
to collapse. Cakes should not be refrigerated to speed the cooling process, as rapid cool￾ing can cause cracking. Prolonged refrigeration also causes cakes to dry out.

FROSTINGS
Frosting, also known as icing, is a sweet decorative coating used as a filling between 
the layers or as a coating over the top and sides of a cake. It is used to add flavor and 
to improve a cake’s appearance. Frosting can also extend a cake’s shelf life by forming 
a protective coating.
There are seven general types of frosting: buttercream, foam, fudge, fondant, 
glaze, royal icing and ganache. (See Table 34.5.) Each type can be produced with a 
number of formulas and in a range of flavorings.

Because frosting is integral to the flavor and appearance of many cakes, it should 
be made carefully using high-quality ingredients and natural flavors and colors. A good 
frosting is smooth; it is never grainy or lumpy. It should complement the flavor and 
texture of the cake without overpowering it. Refer to Table 34.6 on page 1068 to trouble￾shoot preparing and using frostings in this chapter.
Buttercream
A buttercream is a light, smooth, fluffy mixture of sugar and fat (butter, margarine 
or shortening). It may also contain egg yolks for richness or whipped egg whites for 
lightness. Pasteurized eggs must always be used in buttercreams to ensure food safety. 
A good buttercream will be sweet but not cloying; buttery but not greasy.
Buttercreams are popular and suitable for most types of cakes and may be flavored or 
colored as desired. They may be stored, covered, in the refrigerator for several days but 
must be softened before use. The three most popular styles of buttercream, which are 
discussed here, are simple, Italian and French.
Simple Buttercream
Simple buttercream, sometimes known as American-style buttercream, is made by 
creaming butter and powdered sugar together until the mixture is light and smooth. 
Cream, pasteurized eggs and flavorings may be added as desired. Simple buttercream 
requires no cooking and is quick and easy to prepare.
If cost is a consideration, hydrogenated all-purpose shortening can be substituted for 
a portion of the butter, but the flavor and mouth feel will be different. Buttercream made 
with shortening tends to feel greasier and heavier because shortening does not melt on 
the tongue like butter. It will be more stable than pure butter buttercream, however, and 
is necessary when a pure white frosting is desired.
Procedure for Preparing Simple Buttercreams
1 Cream softened butter or shortening until the mixture is light and fluffy.
2 Beat in pasteurized egg if desired.
3 Beat in sifted powdered sugar, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed.
4 Beat in the flavoring ingredients.

Light Chocolate Buttercream
Italian Buttercream
Italian buttercream, also known as meringue buttercream, is based on an Italian 
meringue, which is whipped egg whites cooked with hot sugar syrup. (See Chapter 33, 
Pies, Pastries and Cookies.) Softened butter is then whipped into the cooled meringue, 
and the mixture is flavored as desired. This type of buttercream is extremely soft and 
light. It can be used on most types of cakes and is particularly popular for multilayered 
genoise and spongecakes.
 Procedure for Preparing Italian Buttercreams
1 Whip the egg whites until soft peaks form.
2 Beat granulated sugar into the egg whites and whip until firm and glossy.
3 Meanwhile, combine additional sugar with water and cook to the soft ball stage 
(240°F/116°C), brushing down the sides of the pan with clean water to prevent the sugar 
from crystallizing.
4 With the mixer on medium speed, pour the sugar syrup into the whipped egg whites. Pour 
slowly and carefully to avoid splatters.
5 Continue whipping the egg-white-and-sugar mixture until completely cool.
6 Whip softened, but not melted, butter into the cooled egg-white-and-sugar mixture.
7 add flavoring ingredients as desired.

Italian Buttercream
YIELD Approximately 5 lb. 5 oz. (2.5 kg)
Egg whites, pasteurized, room temperature 14 oz. (14 whites) 420 g
Granulated sugar 1 lb. 11 oz. 810 g
Water as needed as needed
Lightly salted butter, softened but not melted 2 lb. 12 oz. 1320 g
1 Place the egg whites in a mixer bowl. Have 9 ounces (270 grams) of the sugar nearby.
2 Place 1 pound 2 ounces (540 grams) of the sugar in a heavy saucepan with enough water to 
moisten. Bring to a boil over high heat, brushing down the sides of the pan with clean water to 
prevent the sugar from crystallizing.
3 as the sugar syrup’s temperature approaches soft ball stage (240°F/116°C), begin whipping the 
egg whites. Watch the sugar closely so that the temperature does not exceed 240°F (116°C).
4 When soft peaks form in the egg whites, gradually add the remaining 9 ounces (270 grams) of 
sugar. reduce the mixer speed to medium and continue whipping the egg whites to stiff peaks.
5 When the sugar syrup reaches soft ball stage, immediately pour it into the whites while the mixer is 
running at medium speed. Pour the syrup in a steady stream between the side of the bowl and the 
beater. if the syrup hits the beater, it will splatter and cause lumps. Continue beating until the egg 
whites are completely cool. at this point, the product is known as Italian meringue.
6 gradually add the softened butter to the italian meringue with the mixer at medium speed. When 
all the butter is incorporated, add flavoring ingredients as desired.

M34_LABE1163_07_SE_C34.indd 1066 01/11/23 7:48 PMCakes and Frostings 1067
is sometimes folded in for additional body and lightness. French buttercream is per￾haps the most difficult type of buttercream to master, but it has the richest flavor and 
smoothest texture. Like a meringue buttercream, mousseline buttercream may be used 
on almost any type of cake.
Procedure for Preparing French Buttercreams
1 Prepare a sugar syrup and cook to soft ball stage (240°F/116°C on a candy thermometer), 
brushing down the sides of the pan with clean water to prevent the sugar from crystallizing.
2 Beat egg yolks to a thin ribbon.
3 slowly beat the hot sugar syrup into the egg yolks.
4 Continue beating until the yolks are pale, stiff and cooled to approximately 82°F (28°C).
5 gradually whip softened butter into the cooled yolks.
6 Fold in italian meringue, then stir in flavoring ingredients.

1 Combine the sugar and water in a small saucepan and bring to a boil. Continue boiling until the 
syrup reaches 240°F (116°C), brushing down the sides of the pan with clean water to prevent the 
sugar from crystallizing.
2 Meanwhile beat the egg yolks in the bowl of a mixer fitted with the whisk attachment on low speed. 
When the sugar syrup reaches 240°F (116°C), pour it slowly into the egg yolks, gradually increas￾ing the speed at which they are whipped. Continue beating at medium-high speed until the mixture 
is very pale and stiff and has cooled to approximately 82°F (28°C), approximately 10 minutes.
3 gradually add the softened butter to the egg mixture, frequently scraping down the bowl.
4 Fold in the italian Meringue with a spatula. Fold in flavoring extracts just until well distributed 
throughout the buttercream.

Foam Frosting
Foam or boiled frosting is simply an Italian meringue (made with hot sugar syrup). 
Foam frosting is light and fluffy but very sweet. It may be flavored with extract, liqueur 
or melted chocolate. It is frequently used to ice layer cakes and complements a cake 
with lemon, coconut or chocolate flavor. Foam frosting is rather unstable. It should be 
used immediately and served the day it is prepared. Refrigeration often makes the foam 
weep beads of sugar. Freezing causes it to separate or melt.
An easy foam frosting can be made by following the formula for Italian Meringue 
(page 1025). As soon as the meringue has cooled to room temperature, it can be flavored 
as desired with an extract or emulsion.

Flavor Combinations 
for Cakes
Citrus, coffee, maple, peanut butter 
and vanilla are popular flavorings for 
buttercream icings, but the possible cake 
and filling combinations are limitless. 
Chocolate cakes can be filled with almond, 
citrus, coffee, hazelnut and red fruit￾flavored icings. dense chocolate ganache 
paired with apricot, cherry, raspberry or 
other jam works well in plain or chocolate 
butter cakes. tropical fruit flavors, such as 
kiwi, key lime and pineapple, complement 
butter and sponge cakes as do rich 
custards and flavored creams.

Fudge Frosting
A fudge frosting is a warmed mixture of sugar, butter and water or milk. It is heavy, 
rich and candylike. It is also stable and holds up well. A fudge frosting should be applied 
warm and allowed to dry on the cake or pastry. When dry, it will have a thin crust and 
a moist interior. A fudge frosting can be vanilla- or chocolate-based and is suitable for 
cupcakes, layer cakes and sheet cakes.
Procedure for Preparing Fudge Frostings
1 Place sifted powdered sugar in the bowl of a mixer fitted with the paddle attachment.

Fondant
Fondant is a thick, opaque sugar paste commonly used for glazing napoleons, petits 
fours and other pastries as well as some cakes. It is a cooked mixture of sugar and water, 
with glucose or corn syrup added to encourage the correct type of sugar crystallization. 
Poured over a surface, fondant quickly dries to a shiny, nonsticky coating. It is naturally 
pure white and can be tinted with food coloring. Fondant can also be flavored with 
melted chocolate.
Fondant is rather tricky to make, so it is usually purchased prepared either as a 
 ready-to-use paste or a powder to which water is added. To use prepared fondant, thin 
it with water or simple syrup and carefully warm to 100°F (38°C). Watch the temperature; 
when overheated, the fondant will lose its opacity and will dry with an uneven appear￾ance. Commercially prepared fondant will keep for several months at room temperature 
in an airtight container. The surface of the fondant should be coated with simple syrup, 
however, to prevent a crust from forming.
Rolled fondant is a very stiff, doughlike type of fondant that is used for covering cakes 
and for making flowers and other decorations. As the name implies, it is rolled out to the 
desired thickness, then draped over a cake or torte to create a very smooth, flat coating. 
Rolled fondant is available in a ready-to-use form. It can be flavored or colored if desired. 
Be sure to keep the rolled fondant tightly wrapped in plastic and stored in an airtight 
container to prevent it from drying out and cracking.
Glaze
A glaze is a thin coating meant to be poured or drizzled onto a cake or pastry. A glaze is 
usually too thin to apply with a knife or spatula. It is used to add moisture and flavor to 
cakes (e.g., a chiffon or angel food cake) on which a heavy frosting would be undesir￾able. Glazes are often tinted with food coloring.
Flat frosting or water frosting is a specific type of glaze used on Danish pastries and 
coffeecakes. It is pure white and dries to a firm gloss. A glaze made from fondant is also 
used for this purpose. The glucose in fondant prevents it from crystallizing.
Procedure for Preparing Sugar Glazes
1 Blend sifted powdered sugar with a small amount of liquid and flavorings.
2 Use immediately.

Royal Icing
Royal icing, also known as decorator’s icing, is similar to flat frosting except it is 
much stiffer and becomes hard and brittle when dry. It is an uncooked mixture of pow￾dered sugar and pasteurized egg whites and can be dyed with food coloring pastes.
Royal icing is used for making decorations, particularly intricate flowers or lace pat￾terns. Prepare royal icing in small quantities, and always keep any unused portion well 
covered with a damp towel and plastic wrap to prevent hardening.
Procedure for Preparing Royal Icing
1 Combine pasteurized egg white and lemon juice, if using.

Ganache
Ganache is a sublime blending of pure chocolate and cream. It can also include butter, 
liqueur or other flavorings. Any bittersweet, semisweet or dark chocolate may be used 
to make ganache; the choice depends on personal preference and cost considerations.
Depending on its consistency, ganache may be used as a candy or as a filling, frosting 
or glaze-type coating on cakes or pastries. The ratio of chocolate to cream determines 
how thick the cooled ganache will be. Equal parts by weight of chocolate and cream gen￾erally are best for frostings and fillings. Increasing the percentage of chocolate produces 
a thicker ganache. Warm ganache can be poured over a cake or pastry and allowed to 
harden as a thin glaze, or it can be cooled and whipped to create a rich, smooth frosting. 
If it becomes too firm, ganache can be remelted over a bain marie.

Procedure for Preparing Ganache
1 Melt finely chopped chocolate with cream in a double boiler. alternatively bring cream just 
to a boil, then pour it over finely chopped chocolate and allow the cream’s heat to gently 
melt the chocolate. do not attempt to melt chocolate and then add cool cream. this will 
cause the chocolate to resolidify and lump.
2 stir the ganache with a rubber spatula to emulsify the cream and chocolate. (Whisking the 
ganache using a whip may be quicker, but the ganache will be grainy and less creamy.)
3 Cool the cream and chocolate mixture over an ice bath.

➊ Pouring the hot cream over the

➋ Cool, firm ganache.
Ganache is also the foundation of one of the world’s most sophisticated candies, 
the chocolate truffle. Truffles take their name from the rough, black, highly prized fun￾gus they resemble, but there the similarity ends. Chocolate truffles should have a rich, 
creamy ganache center with a well-balanced, refined flavor.
To prepare chocolate truffles, a firm ganache is flavored as desired, then piped or 
allowed to harden in a bowl and scooped. Once firm, the portions of ganache are rolled 
in cocoa powder, confectioner’s sugar or melted chocolate. The classic French truffle 
is a small, irregularly shaped ball of bittersweet chocolate dusted with cocoa powder. 
Americans, however, seem to prefer larger candies, coated with melted chocolate and 
decorated. The following recipe can be prepared in either style.

ASSEMBLING AND DECORATING CAKES
Much of the initial appeal of cakes lies in their appearance. This is true whether the 
finished cake is a simple sheet cake topped with swirls of buttercream or an elabo￾rate wedding cake with intricate garlands and bouquets of marzipan roses. Any cake 
assembled and decorated with care and attention to detail is preferable to a carelessly 
assembled or garishly overdecorated one.
Thousands of decorating styles or designs are possible, of course. This section 
describes a few simple options that beginning pastry cooks can prepare using a mini￾mum of specialized tools. In planning a cake’s design, consider the flavor, texture and 
color of the components used as well as the number of guests or portions that must be 
served. Consider who will be cutting and eating the cake and how long the dessert must 
stand before service.
M34_LABE1163_07_SE_C34.indd 1072 01/11/23 7:48 PMCakes and Frostings 1073
Assembling Cakes
Before a cake can be decorated, it must be assembled and coated with frosting. Most 
cakes can be assembled in a variety of shapes and sizes; sheet cakes, round layer cakes 
and rectangular layer cakes are the most common. The cake is placed on a cake card￾board of the appropriate size and shape for support. When assembling any cake, the 
goal is to fill and stack the cake layers evenly and to apply an even coating of frosting 
that is smooth and free of crumbs. A thin underlayer of frosting called a crumb coat may 
be spread on an assembled cake to seal loose surface crumbs before a final decorative 
layer of frosting is applied.
Most of the photographs used in this section show the assembly and decoration of a 
celebration cake shown in the photograph to the left.

rectangles of clean, thin, disposable cardboard 
used to support the layers of a cake for service 
or display; especially useful for retail purchases; 
generally coated with a water- and fat-resistant 
substance, which is often colored gold or white
Procedure for Filling and Icing a Cake
➊ split the cake horizontally into thin layers if 
desired. Use cake cardboards to support each 
layer as it is removed. Brush away any loose 
crumbs with a dry pastry brush or your hand.
➋ Position the bottom layer on a cake board. 
Place the layer on a revolving cake stand, if 
available. Pipe a border of buttercream around 
the cake, then top the layer with a mound of 
filling. Use a cake spatula to spread it evenly.
➌ Position the next cake layer over the filling 
and continue layering and filling the cake 
as desired.
➍ Place a mound of frosting in the center of 
the cake top. Push it to the edge of the cake with 
a cake spatula. do not drag the frosting back 
and forth or lift the spatula off the frosting, as 
these actions tend to pick up crumbs.
➎ smooth a thin layer of frosting (the crumb 
coat) over the top of the cake. Cover the sides 
with excess frosting from the top. Chill the cake.
❻ Place another mound of frosting in the 
center of the cake top. Frost the cake with a 
second layer of icing. Hold the spatula upright 
against the side of the cake and, pressing 
gently, turn the cake stand slowly. this smooths 
and evens the sides. When the sides and top 
are smooth, the cake is ready to be decorated 
as desired. Simple Decorating Techniques
An extremely simple yet effective way to decorate an iced cake is with a garnish of 
chopped nuts, fruit, toasted coconut, shaved chocolate or other foods arranged in pat￾terns or sprinkled over the cake. Be sure to use a garnish that complements the cake 
and frosting flavors or reflects one of the cake’s ingredients. For example, finely chopped 
M34_LABE1163_07_SE_C34.indd 1073 01/11/23 7:48 PM1074 CHaPter tHirtY-FoUr
pecans are an appropriate garnish for a carrot cake that contains pecans; shaved choco￾late is not. A chocolate torte might be decorated with fresh raspberries even when it does 
not contain raspberries because chocolate and berries are compatible flavors.
Side masking is the technique of coating only the sides of a cake with garnish. Be 
sure to apply the garnish while the frosting is still moist enough for it to adhere. The top 
may be left plain or decorated with frosting designs or a message.
Stencils can be used to apply patterns of finely chopped garnishes, powdered sugar 
or cocoa powder to the top of a cake. A design can be cut from cardboard, or thin plastic 
stencil forms can be purchased. Even simple strips of parchment paper can be used to 
create an attractive pattern. If using a stencil on an iced cake, allow the frosting to set 
somewhat before placing the stencil on top of it. After the garnishes have been sprinkled 
over the stencil, carefully lift the stencil to avoid spilling the excess garnish and disturb￾ing the pattern.
A cake or baker’s comb or a serrated knife can be used to create patterns on a cake 
iced with buttercream, fudge or ganache. Hold the comb against the side of an iced cake 
and rotate the cake turntable slowly and steadily to create horizontal lines in the frosting.
side masking: Coating the sides of a carrot 
cake with chopped pistachios.
stencils: Creating a design with confectioner’s 
sugar and strips of parchment paper.
Cake comb: Creating a pattern on a frosted 
cake.
Piping Techniques
More elaborate and difficult decorations can be produced with the aid of a piping bag 
and an assortment of pastry tips. With these tools, buttercream or royal icing can be used 
to create borders, flowers and messages. Before applying any decorations, plan a design 
or pattern that is appropriate for the size and shape of the item being decorated.
When used properly, colored frostings can bring cake decorations to life. Buttercream, 
royal icing and fondant are easily tinted using paste food coloring. Liquid food color￾ings are not recommended as they may thin the frosting too much. Always add coloring 
gradually with a toothpick. Frosting colors tend to darken as they sit. It is easy to add 
more later to darken the color if necessary, but it is difficult to lighten the color if too 
much is added.
Piping bags made from plastic, nylon or plastic-coated canvas are available in a 
range of sizes. A disposable piping cone can also be made from parchment paper.
Most decorations and designs are made by using a piping bag fitted with a pastry 
tip. Pastry tips are available with dozens of different openings and are referred to by 
standardized numbers. Some commonly used tips are shown in the nearby photo. A vari￾ety of borders and designs can be produced by changing the pressure, the angle of the 
bag and the distance between the tip and the cake surface. The size of the piping bag 
and tip used depends on the task at hand. The larger the bag, the less often it needs to 
be refilled. Smaller bags are easier to handle, however, especially when making small 
designs or piping handwriting.

Procedure for Making a Parchment-Paper Piping Cone
➊ Cut a piece of uncreased parchment paper 
into an equilateral triangle. shape it into a 
cone as shown by bringing together the three 
corners of the parchment paper.
➋ Fold the top edges together to secure the 
cone shape. the piping cone is now ready to 
be filled.
➌ Fill the cone with buttercream or another 
ingredient to be piped. Cut the tip of the filled 
parchment cone.
a plain piping tip may be used to apply a 
simple swirl of frosting to decorate a cupcake.
Procedure for Filling a Piping Bag
➊ select the proper size piping bag for your 
task. insert the appropriate tip for the design 
you are creating.
➋ Fold down the top of the bag, then fill 
approximately half full with frosting. do not 
overfill the bag.
➌ Be sure to twist the open end tightly to close 
it before you start piping. Hold the bag firmly 
in your palm and squeeze from the top. do not 
squeeze from the bottom or you may force the 
contents out the wrong end. Use the fingers of 
your other hand to guide the bag as you work.

Instead of leaving the sides of a frosted cake smooth or coating them with chopped nuts 
or crumbs, many designs can be piped on in artful patterns. Some simple but elegant 
designs are the vine border and basket weave shown here. Normally a border pattern is 
piped around the base of the cake and along the top edge. Borders should be piped on 
after nuts or any other garnishes are applied.
applying a vine and leaf border onto a 
celebration cake.
applying a bead border onto a celebration 
cake.
applying a basket weave pattern to the sides of 
a celebration cake.
applying a shell border to a celebration cake.
Each slice or serving of cake can be marked with its own decoration. For example, a 
rosette of frosting or a whole nut or piece of fruit could be used to indicate portions. This 
makes it easier to cut the cake evenly.
Delicate flowers such as roses can be piped onto parchment paper, allowed to harden, 
then placed on the cake in attractive arrangements. Royal icing is particularly useful for 
making decorations in advance because it dries very hard and lasts indefinitely.
The key to success with a piping bag is practice, practice, practice. Pipe plain 
 all-purpose shortening on to parchment paper to practice and experiment with piping 
techniques. Once you are comfortable using a piping bag, try applying these newfound 
skills directly to cakes and pastries.

 STORING CAKES 
 Plain cake layers or sheets can be stored at room temperature for 2 or 3 days if well cov￾ered, although they may be easier to handle when chilled. Iced or filled cakes are usually 
refrigerated to prevent spoilage. Simple buttercreams or sugar glazes made without eggs 
or dairy products, however, can be left at room temperature for 1 or 2 days. Any cake 
containing custard filling, mousse or whipped cream must be refrigerated. Cakes made 
with foam-type frosting should be eaten the day they are prepared. 
 Cakes can usually be frozen with great success; this makes them ideal for baking in 
advance. Unfrosted layers or sheets should be well covered with plastic wrap and fro￾zen at 0°F (–18°C) or lower. High-fat cakes will keep in a freezer for up to 6 months; 
 egg-foam cakes begin to deteriorate after 2 or 3 months. 
 Frostings and fillings do not freeze particularly well, often losing flavor or changing 
texture when frozen. Buttercreams made with egg whites or sugar syrups tend to develop 
crystals and graininess. Foam frostings weep, expelling beads of sugar and becoming 
sticky. If a filled or a frosted cake must be frozen, it is best to freeze it unwrapped first, 
until the frosting is firm. The cake can then be covered with plastic wrap without damag￾ing the frosting design. Leave a frozen cake wrapped until completely thawed. It is best 
to thaw cakes in the refrigerator; do not refreeze a thawed cake. 
 Advanced Pâtisserie 
 sugar can be used to create a number of 
doughs, pastes and syrups used for artistic and 
decorative work. Mastering even some of these 
products takes years of experience and practice. 
although formulas and preparation methods are 
beyond the scope of this book, it is important 
that all pastry cooks be able to recognize and 
identify certain decorative sugar products. 
Blown sugar: a boiled mixture of sucrose, 
glucose and tartaric acid that is colored and 
shaped (in a manner very similar to glass 
blowing) using an air pump. it is used for 
making pieces of fruit and containers such 
as bowls and vases. 
Cast sugar: a boiled mixture of sucrose and 
glucose that is colored and molded into 
shapes that are used for artistic displays 
and structures. 
Gum paste: a smooth dough made of 
sugar and gelatin; it dries relatively slowly, 
becoming very firm and hard. the paste can 
be colored and rolled out, cut and shaped, 
or molded. it is used for making flowers, 
leaves and small figures. 
Marzipan: a mixture of almond paste and 
sugar that may be colored and used like 
modeling clay for sculpting small fruits, 
flowers or other objects. Marzipan can also 
be rolled out and cut into various shapes or 
used to cover cakes or pastries. 
Nougatine: a candy made of caramelized 
sugar and almonds that can be molded 
into shapes or containers. Unlike other 
sugar decorations, nougatine remains

Brownies
Where do you draw the line between cakes and brownies? the decision must be a matter of texture and personal preference, for the preparation 
methods are nearly identical. Brownies are generally chewy and fudgy, sweeter and denser than even the richest of butter cakes. Brownies are a 
relatively inexpensive and an easy way for a food service operation to offer its customers a fresh-baked dessert. although not as sophisticated as an 
elaborate gâteau, a well-made brownie can always be served with pride (and a scoop of ice cream).
Brownies are prepared using the same procedures used for high-fat cakes. eggs and air incorporated during the mixing process are usually the only 
leaveners in a traditional brownie formula. good brownies are achieved with a proper balance of ingredients: a high ratio of butter to flour and not 
too many eggs produces a dense, fudgy brownie. the fat coats the flour, preventing the protein from developing into gluten. Less butter produces a 
more cakelike brownie. increasing the eggs produces a brownie with a crumb structure that more closely resembles a true cake. Likewise the higher the 
ratio of sugar to flour, the gooier the finished brownie will be. in some brownie formulas, the fat is creamed to incorporate air, as with butter cakes. 
in others the fat is first melted and combined with other liquid ingredients. Brownies are rarely made with whipped egg whites, however, as this makes 
their texture too light and cakelike.
each customer and cook has their own idea of the ideal brownie. some brownies are cloyingly sweet, with a creamy texture and an abundance of 
chocolate; others are bitter and crisp. some are frosted; others need only a dusting of powdered sugar. Baked brownies can be frozen for 2–3 months 
if well wrapped.

 The bakeshop is responsible for more than just quick breads, yeast breads, pies, pas￾tries, cookies and cakes. It also produces many delightfully sweet concoctions that 
are not baked and often not even cooked. these include sweet custards, creams, 
frozen desserts and dessert sauces. sweet custards are cooked mixtures of eggs, sugar and 
milk; flour or cornstarch may be added. sweet custards can be flavored in a variety of ways 
and eaten hot or cold. some are served alone as a dessert or are used as a filling, topping 
or accompaniment for pies, pastries or cakes. Creams include whipped cream and mixtures 
lightened with whipped cream such as Bavarians, chiffons and mousses. Frozen desserts 
include ice cream and sorbet as well as the still-frozen mousses called semifreddi . 
 sauces for these desserts, including fruit purées, caramel sauces and chocolate syrup, are 
also made in the bakeshop and are discussed in this chapter. Indeed many of the items pre￾sented in this chapter are components, meant to be combined with pastries ( see Chapter 33, 
Pies, Pastries and Cookies ) or cakes ( see Chapter 34, Cakes and Frostings ) to form complete 
desserts. Guidelines for assembling desserts are given at the end of this chapter. 
 CUSTARDS 
 A custard is any liquid thickened by the coagulation of egg proteins. A custard’s consis￾tency depends on the ratio of eggs to liquid, whether whole eggs or just yolks are used 
and the type of liquid used. The more eggs used, the thicker and richer the final product 
will be. The richer the liquid (e.g., cream versus milk), the thicker the final product. 
Most custards, with the notable exception of pastry creams, are not thickened by starch. 
A custard can be cooked on the stovetop by stirring or baked. A stirred custard tends 
to be soft, rich and creamy. A baked custard , typically prepared in a bain marie, is usu￾ally firm enough to unmold and slice. 
 Stirred Custards 
 A stirred custard is cooked on the stove top either directly in a saucepan or over 
a double boiler. It must be stirred throughout the cooking process to prevent 
curdling (overcooking). 
 A stirred custard can be used as a dessert sauce, incorporated into a complex dessert 
or eaten alone. The stirred custards most commonly used in food service operations are 
vanilla custard sauce and pastry cream. Other popular stirred custards are butterscotch or 
vanilla pudding, lemon curd and sabayon. 
 Vanilla Custard Sauce 
Vanilla custard sauce (Fr. crème anglaise ) is made with egg yolks, sugar and milk or 
half-and-half. Usually flavored with vanilla bean or pure vanilla extract, a custard sauce 
can also be flavored with liqueur, chocolate, ground nuts or extracts. A custard sauce 
can be served with cakes, pastries, fruits and soufflés and is often used for decorating 
dessert plates. It may be served hot or cold. Custard sauce is also used as the base for 
many ice creams. 
 Custard sauce is prepared on the stovetop over direct heat in a nonreactive saucepan 
to prevent discoloration. (If a nonreactive pan is unavailable, cook the custard in a stain￾less steel bowl set over a bain marie of simmering water.) When making a custard sauce, 
be extremely careful to stir the mixture continually and do not allow its temperature to 
exceed 190°F (88°C) or the custard will curdle or break. Use a thermometer to monitor 
the custard as it cooks and remove the sauce from the heat when it reaches 185°F (85°C). 
 Safety Alert 
 Eggs 
 eggs are high-protein foods that are 
easily contaminated by bacteria such 
as salmonella, which cause food-borne 
illnesses. Because custards cannot be 
heated to temperatures high enough to 
destroy these bacteria without curdling 
the eggs, it is especially important 
that sanitary guidelines be followed in 
preparing the egg products discussed in 
this chapter. 
1 Cleanliness is important. Wash your 
hands thoroughly before beginning. 
Be sure to use clean, sanitized bowls, 
utensils and storage containers. 
2 When breaking or separating eggs, 
do not allow the exterior of the 
eggshell to come into contact with 
the raw egg. 
3 Heat the milk to just below a boil 
before combining it with the eggs. 
this reduces the final cooking time. 
4 Chill the finished product quickly 
over an ice bath and refrigerate 
immediately below 40°F (4°C). 
5 do not store any custard mixture, 
cooked or uncooked, at 
room temperature. 
M35_LABE1163_07_SE_C35.indd 1090 31/10/23 9:36 PMCustards, Creams, Frozen desserts and dessert sauCes 1091
A properly made custard sauce should be smooth and thick enough to coat the back of 
a spoon. It should not contain any noticeable bits of cooked egg.
Pastry Cream
Pastry cream (Fr. crème pâtissière) is a stirred custard made with egg yolks, sugar and 
milk and thickened with starch (flour, cornstarch or a combination of the two). Because 
the starch protects the egg yolks from curdling, pastry cream must be boiled to fully 
gelatinize the starch and eliminate the taste of raw starch.
Pastry cream can be flavored with chocolate, liquors, extracts or fruits. (Pudding is 
simply flavored pastry cream.) Pastry cream is used for filling éclairs, cream puffs, napo￾leons, fruit tarts and other pastries. Pastry cream thickened with cornstarch is also the 
filling for cream pies (see Chapter 33, Pies, Pastries and Cookies). Pastry cream is thick 
enough to hold its shape without making pastry doughs soggy.
Pastry cream can be rather dense. It can be lightened by folding in whipped cream or 
whipped egg whites to produce a mousseline, or Italian meringue can be folded in to 
produce a crème Chiboust.

Procedure for Preparing Vanilla Custard Sauce 
and Pastry Cream
1 Place milk and/or cream in a heavy, nonreactive saucepan; steep a split vanilla bean in the 
cream if desired.
2 In a mixing bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, sugar and starch (if using). do not use an 
electric mixer, as it incorporates too much air.
3 Bring the liquid just to a boil. Temper the egg mixture with approximately one-third of the 
hot liquid.
4 Pour the tempered eggs into the remaining hot liquid and return the mixture to the heat. 
When determining how hot to set your stove, keep in mind this guideline: the lower the 
temperature, the longer the custard will take to thicken; the higher the temperature, the 
greater the risk of curdling.
5 Cook, stirring constantly, until thickened. Custard sauce should reach a temperature of 
185°F (85°C). Pastry cream should come to a true boil, begin to thicken slightly, then be 
allowed to boil for up to 2 minutes to thicken.
6 Immediately remove the cooked custard from the hot saucepan to avoid overcooking. 
Pour custard sauce through a fine mesh strainer. do not strain starch-thickened custards, 
however. Butter, used to enrich pastry cream, should be added at this time. other 
flavorings can be added now also.
7 Cool in an ice bath. store in a clean, shallow container. Press plastic wrap over the surfact 
of pastry cream to prevent it from forming a thick skin and refrigerate.
Procedure for Salvaging Curdled Vanilla Custard Sauce
1 strain the curdled sauce into a bowl. Place the bowl over an ice bath and whisk vigorously.
2 If this does not smooth out the overcooked sauce, place the sauce in a blender and process 
for a few moments.
Although these steps may reincorporate the curdled eggs, the resulting sauce will be thin 
and less creamy than a properly prepared vanilla custard sauce.

Sabayon
Sabayon [sah-bay-own; It. Zabaglione] is a foamy, stirred custard sauce made by whisk￾ing eggs, sugar and wine over low heat. The egg proteins coagulate, thickening the 
mixture, while the whisking incorporates air to make it light and fluffy. Usually a sweet 
wine is used; marsala and champagne are the most popular choices. As the flavor of the 
sabayon depends on the wine from which it is made, use the best quality available.
Sabayon can be served warm, or it can be chilled and lightened with whipped cream 
or whipped egg whites. It may be served alone or as a sauce or topping with fruit or 
pastries such as spongecake or ladyfingers.
ladyfingers small cakes or cookies made from 
spongecake batter piped into finger-length 
strips; used to line molds for desserts or layered 
with fillings
Procedure for Preparing Sabayon
1 Combine egg yolks, sugar and wine in the top of a double boiler.
2 Place the double boiler over low heat and whisk constantly until the sauce is foamy and 
thick enough to form a ribbon when the whisk is lifted.
3 remove from the heat and serve immediately, or whisk over an ice bath until cool. If 
allowed to sit, the hot mixture may separate.
4 Whipped egg whites or whipped cream may be folded into the cooled sabayon.

 Baked Custards
Baked custard is based on the same principle as stirred custard: A liquid thickens by the 
coagulation of egg proteins. However, with a baked custard, the thickening occurs in an 
oven. The container of custard is usually placed in a water bath (bain marie) to help the 
custard cook evenly and protect the eggs from curdling. Even though the water bath’s 
temperature will not exceed 212°F (100°C), care must be taken not to bake the custards 
for too long or at too high a temperature. An overbaked custard is watery or curdled; 
a properly baked custard is smooth-textured and firm enough to slice.
M35_LABE1163_07_SE_C35.indd 1094 31/10/23 9:36 PMCustards, Creams, Frozen desserts and dessert sauCes 1095
The family of baked custards includes simple mixtures of whole eggs or egg yolks 
with sugar and milk. If this mixture is baked over a layer of caramelized sugar, it is called 
a crème caramel or a flan. Like custard sauce and pastry cream, baked custards can be 
flavored with chocolate, liquors, extracts, herbs, fruits and spices.
Baked custards also include sweet or savory egg mixtures in which other ingre￾dients are suspended (e.g., cheesecake, rice pudding, bread pudding and quiche). 
The foundation for all of these products is a liquid thickened by the coagulation of 
egg proteins.
Crème Caramel
Crème caramel, crème renversée and flan all refer to an egg custard baked over a 
layer of caramelized sugar and inverted for service. The caramelized sugar produces a 
golden-brown surface on the inverted custard and a thin caramel sauce.

1 Combine the milk, cream, cinnamon sticks and vanilla bean in a large saucepan. Bring just to a 
boil, cover and remove from the heat. allow this mixture to steep for approximately 30 minutes.
2 Combine the granulated sugar with the water in a small heavy saucepan; bring to a boil. Cook 
until the sugar caramelizes and turns a deep golden brown. Immediately pour about 2 tablespoons 
(30 milliliters) caramelized sugar into each ramekin. tilt each ramekin to spread the caramel evenly 
along the bottom. arrange the ramekins in a 2-inch- (5-centimeter-) deep hotel pan and set aside.
3 Whisk the eggs, egg yolks, brown sugar, molasses and amaretto together in a large bowl.
4 uncover the milk mixture and return it to the stove top. Bring just to a boil. temper the 
 egg-and-sugar mixture with approximately one-third of the hot milk. Whisk in the remaining hot 
milk. do not return the custard to the stove.
5 strain the custard through a fine mesh strainer. Pour into the caramel-lined ramekins, filling to just 
below the rim.
6 Pour enough warm water into the hotel pan to reach halfway up the sides of the ramekins. Bake 
at 325°F (160°C) for approximately 30–40 minutes. the custards should be almost set but still 
slightly soft in the center.
7 Completely chill the baked custards before serving. to unmold, run a small knife around the edge 
of the custard, invert onto the serving plate and give the ramekin a firm sideways shake. Garnish 
with fresh fruit or caramelized almonds.

 Safety Alert
Hot Sugar Syrups
Be extremely careful when working 
with hot sugar syrups. Because sugar 
can be heated to very high temperatures, 
these syrups can cause severe burns. 
do not touch liquefied or caramelized 
sugar with your bare hand until it has 
cooled completely.

Crème Brûlée
Crème brûlée is a thick version of custard sauce with a consistency more like a pudding
than a sauce. This custard is often served over fruit in a small ramekin or other container 
and then topped with caramelized sugar from which it gets its name; crème brûlée
means “burnt cream” in French.
Crème brûlée can be made as either a stirred or a baked custard. Neither version 
should be considered superior, however; they are simply different. The stirred or stove 
top method is quicker but requires constant attention and a practiced feel for the cus￾tard’s consistency. The finished stirred version is heavier, creamier and softer than its 
baked counterpart. The baked version is served in the ramekin or bowl in which it was 
baked. Unlike crème caramel or flan, baked crème brûlée is not inverted or removed 
from its baking dish for service. A formula for the baked version follows.
Gentle heat is important for both methods. Overcooked stirred custard will curdle, 
turning into scrambled eggs. Overcooked baked custard will become watery, its texture 
marred with small bubbles.
Additional flavors and textures can be added to crème brûlée custard in several ways:
	▪ Placing a layer of fresh berries or fruit compote under the custard for service
	▪ Incorporating fruit, nuts or liqueurs directly into the custard
	▪ Adding flavoring compounds and extracts to the custard
	▪ Infusing the heavy cream with nuts, herbs, spices, tea or other flavorings before 
making the custard
If fruit purées or other liquids are used, the quantity of cream will have to be adjusted 
so the custard is not too watery or unable to set properly.

1 Heat the cream and the vanilla bean in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat until bubbles 
appear along the sides of the pan.
2 In a bowl, quickly whisk the sugar into the egg yolks.
3 When the cream is hot, slowly whisk it into the sugar and yolk mixture. Whisk until well combined.
4 strain through a fine mesh strainer into a pitcher or large measuring cup. scrape the vanilla bean 
with the tip of a paring knife to remove the remaining seeds; stir the seeds into the custard.
5 Preheat the oven to 325°F (160°C). arrange 10 ramekins in a 2-inch- (5-centimeter-) deep hotel 
pan or baking dish. Pour the custard into the ramekins. set the pan of ramekins inside the pre￾heated oven, then carefully pour enough water into the pan to come two-thirds of the way up the 
sides of the ramekins. Bake until just set, approximately 45–50 minutes. start checking the custards 
early; baking time will depend on the thickness and depth of your ramekins. the custard should be 
set, not soupy, with only a small area of jiggle in the center.
6 When the custards are done, carefully remove the baking dish from the oven and allow the rame￾kins to cool in the water bath. When the ramekins are cool enough to handle, remove them from 
the pan, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or up to 2 days before service.

Cheesecake
Cheesecakes have undergone many changes and variations since the ancient Greeks 
devised the first known recipe. Americans revolutionized the dessert with the develop￾ment of cream cheese in 1872.
Cheesecake is a baked custard that contains a smooth cheese, usually a soft, fresh 
cheese such as cream, ricotta, cottage or farmer cheese. A cheesecake may be pre￾pared without a crust, or it may have a base or sides of short dough, cookie crumbs, 
ground nuts or spongecake. The filling can be dense and rich (New York style) or light 
and fluffy (Italian style). Fruit, nuts and flavorings may also be included in the filling. 
Cheesecakes are often topped with fruit or sour cream glaze. A recipe for New York 
Cheesecake appears on page 1112. Some cheesecakes are unbaked and rely on gelatin 
for thickening; others are frozen. These are not really custards, however, but are more 
similar to the chiffons or mousses discussed later.
Cheesecakes should be cut when cold and firm. Use a knife dipped in hot water and 
wipe it clean after cutting each slice.
Bread Pudding
Bread pudding is a home-style dessert in which chunks of bread, flavorings and raisins 
or other fruit are mixed with an egg custard and baked. The result is a cross between 
cake and pudding. Bread pudding is often served with custard sauce, ice cream, whipped 
cream or a whiskey-flavored butter sauce. Bread pudding is a delicious way to use stale 
or leftover bread or overripe fruit. A recipe for Bread Pudding with Bourbon Sauce 
appears on page 1113.
Rice Pudding
Rice pudding is another home-style dessert in which cooked white rice is baked in a 
custard mixture flavored with cinnamon or vanilla. Rice pudding is also made by fold￾ing cooked rice into a stirred custard or by cooking rice in milk or another liquid until 
it thickens. The variety of rice used may change as well as the flavorings. A recipe for 
Kheer (Indian-Style Rice Pudding) appears on page 1116.
Soufflés
A soufflé is made with a custard base that is often thickened with a starch. The base 
is lightened with whipped egg whites and then baked. When heated, the air in the egg 
whites expands to create a light, fluffy texture and tall rise. During baking, the egg pro￾teins set, giving some structure to the finished soufflé. A soufflé is not as stable as a cake 
or other pastry item, however, and will collapse as it cools.
Soufflés can be prepared in a wide variety of sweet and savory flavors. The flavorings 
can be incorporated into the custard, as in the following recipe for Chocolate Soufflé. 
Alternatively, an unflavored pastry cream can be used as the base. In this case, liqueur, 
fruit or chocolate is added to each portion separately.
When making a soufflé, the custard base and egg whites should be at room tempera￾ture. There are two reasons for this. First, the egg whites will whip to a better volume; 
second, if the base is approximately the same temperature as the egg whites, the two 
mixtures can be more easily incorporated. The egg whites are whipped to stiff peaks 
with a portion of the sugar for stability. The whipped egg whites are then gently folded 
into the base immediately before baking.
A soufflé is baked in a straight-sided mold or in individual ramekins. The finished 
soufflé should be puffy with a lightly browned top. It should rise well above the rim 
of the baking dish. A soufflé must be served immediately, before it collapses. A warm 
custard sauce (crème anglaise) is often served as an accompaniment to a sweet soufflé.
A frozen soufflé is not a true soufflé. Rather it is a creamy custard mixture thickened 
with gelatin, lightened with whipped egg whites or whipped cream and placed in a souf￾flé dish wrapped with a paper or acetate collar. When the collar is removed, the mixture 
looks as if it has risen above the mold like a hot soufflé.

1 to prepare the base, heat the orange juice to lukewarm in a heavy saucepan.
2 Whisk the egg yolks with 3 ounces (90 grams) sugar in a large mixing bowl. Whisk in the flour and 
warm orange juice, then return the mixture to the saucepan.
3 Cook over medium-low heat, stirring constantly, until the custard is thick enough to coat a spatula. 
do not allow it to boil. remove from the heat.
4 stir in the chocolate until completely melted. stir in the liqueur. transfer the custard base to a bowl 
and cover with plastic wrap to prevent a skin from forming. Hold for use at room temperature. 
(unused base can be kept overnight in the refrigerator; bring to room temperature before mixing 
with the egg whites.)
5 to prepare the soufflés, brush 4-fluid-ounce (120-milliliter) ramekins with melted butter and dust 
with granulated sugar.
6 Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C). Place a sheet pan in the oven, onto which you will place the 
soufflés for baking. (this makes it easier to remove the hot soufflé cups from the oven.)
7 Whip the egg whites to stiff peaks with the remaining 1 ounce (30 grams) sugar. Fold the whites 
into the chocolate base and spoon the mixture into the prepared ramekins. the ramekins should 
be filled to within ¼ inch (6 millimeters) of the rim. smooth the top of each soufflé with a spatula 
and bake immediately.
8 the soufflés are done when well risen, brown on top and the edges appear dry, approximately

CREAMS
Creams (Fr. crèmes) include light, fluffy or creamy-textured dessert items made with 
whipped egg whites or whipped cream. Some, such as Bavarian creams and chiffons, 
are thickened with gelatin. Others, such as mousses and crèmes Chantilly, are softer and 
lighter. (See Table 35.1.) The success of all creams, however, depends on properly whip￾ping and incorporating egg whites or heavy cream.
Review the material on whipping cream found in Chapter 8, Dairy Products. When 
preparing any whipped cream, be sure that the cream, the mixing bowl and all utensils 
are well chilled and clean. Recall that heavy cream used for whipping has a butterfat 
content of 30–36 percent. A warm bowl can melt the butterfat, destroying the texture of 
the cream. Properly whipped cream should increase two to three times in volume.
Crème Chantilly
Crème Chantilly is simply heavy cream whipped to soft peaks and lightly flavored 
with sugar and vanilla. It can be used for garnishing pastry or dessert items, or it can be 
folded into cooled custard or pastry cream and used as a component in a pastry.
When making crème Chantilly, the vanilla extract and sugar should be added after the 
cream begins to thicken. Either granulated or powdered sugar may be used; there are 
advantages and disadvantages to both. Granulated sugar assists in forming a better foam 
than powdered sugar, but it may make the cream gritty. Powdered sugar dissolves more 
quickly and completely than granulated sugar but does nothing to assist with foaming. 
Whichever sugar is used, add it just before the whipping is complete to avoid interfering 
with the cream’s volume and stability.
Crème Chantilly (Chantilly Cream)
YIELD 2–2½ qt. (2–2.5 lt)
Heavy cream, chilled 1 qt. 1 lt
Powdered sugar 3 oz. 90 g
Vanilla extract 0.3 fl. oz. (2 tsp.) 10 ml
1 Place the cream in a chilled mixing bowl. using a balloon whisk, whisk the cream until slightly thickened.
2 add the sugar and vanilla extract and continue whisking to the desired consistency. the cream 
should be smooth and light, not grainy. do not overwhip.
3 Crème Chantilly may be stored in the refrigerator for several hours. If the cream begins to soften, 
gently rewhip as necessary.
Variations:
Stabilized Whipped Cream—soften ¼ ounce (7 grams/2¾ teaspoons) granulated gelatin in 2 fluid 
ounces (60 milliliters) cold water then melt it over low heat. add the melted gelatin to the cream 
just as it begins to form soft peaks. Whip to the desired consistency. use to fill cakes or pastries. It 
will keep for 24 hours without deflating.
Chocolate Chantilly—melt 1 pound 2 ounces (540 grams) bittersweet chocolate to 120°F (49°C) and 
remove from heat. Whip the cream to medium peaks. Whisk one-fourth of the whipped cream 
into the chocolate vigorously. Gently fold in the remaining cream. this mixture will have the texture 
of velvety ganache.

 Bavarian Cream
A Bavarian cream (Fr. bavarois) is prepared by first thickening custard sauce with gela￾tin, then folding in whipped cream. The final product is poured into a mold and chilled 
until firm enough to unmold and slice. Although a Bavarian cream can be molded into 
individual servings, it is traditionally poured into a round mold lined with spongecake or 
ladyfingers to create the classic dessert known as a charlotte.
Bavarians can be flavored by adding chocolate, puréed fruit, chopped nuts, extracts 
or liquors to the custard sauce base. Layers of fruit or liquor-soaked spongecake can also 
be added for flavor and texture.
When thickening a dessert cream with gelatin, it is important to use the correct amount 
of gelatin. If not enough gelatin is used or it is not incorporated completely, the cream 
will not become firm enough to unmold. If too much gelatin is used, the cream will be 
tough and rubbery. The recipe given here uses sheet gelatin, although an equal amount 
by weight of granulated gelatin can be substituted. Refer to Chapter 30, Principles of the 
Bakeshop, for information on using gelatin.
Charlotte Bavarian
Procedure for Preparing Bavarian Creams
1 Prepare a custard sauce of the desired flavor.
2 While the custard sauce is still quite warm, stir in softened sheet gelatin or dissolved 
granulated gelatin. make sure the gelatin is completely incorporated.
3 Chill the custard until almost thickened, then fold in the whipped cream.
4 Pour the Bavarian into a mold or charlotte form. Chill until set.

2 In a separate bowl, whisk the egg yolks and remaining 4 ounces (120 grams) sugar together to the 
ribbon stage. temper the yolk mixture with one-quarter of the heated milk, whisking constantly.
3 Pour the egg mixture into the saucepan with the rest of the milk. stir constantly with a rubber 
spatula until the custard reaches 185°F (85°C).
4 remove the custard from the heat and pour it through a fine mesh strainer into a clean bowl.
5 add the softened gelatin to the hot custard. Chill until thick in an ice bath, stirring regularly to 
prevent lumps from forming, until the custard reaches 75°F (24°C) or slightly cooler. Fold in the 
whipped cream.
6 Pour the Bavarian cream immediately into serving dishes or a cake-lined mold. Chill completely 
before serving.
Note Gelatin may separate in the freezer, so quick chilling is not recommended. Products made with 
gelatin keep well for 1–2 days but stiffen with age.

Chiffon
A chiffon is similar to a Bavarian except that whipped egg whites, instead of whipped 
cream, are folded into the thickened base. The base may be a custard or a fruit mixture 
thickened with cornstarch. Although a chiffon may be molded like a Bavarian, it is most 
often used as a pie or tart filling.

Pasteurized eggs, which are heated 
and held at the proper temperatures 
for sufficient time to kill harmful 
bacteria such as Salmonella enteritidis,

Mousse
The term mousse applies to an assortment of dessert creams not easily classified elsewhere. 
A mousse is similar to a Bavarian or chiffon in that it is lightened with whipped cream, 
whipped egg whites or both. A mousse is generally softer than these other products, 
 however, and only occasionally contains a small amount of gelatin. A mousse is generally 
too soft to mold. A mousse may be served alone as a dessert or used as a filling in cakes 
or pastry items. Plan on serving 4–6 fluid ounces (120–360 milliliters) of mousse per 
 serving as a stand-alone dessert. Sweet mousses can be based on a custard sauce, melted 
chocolate or puréed fruit. Savory mousses are discussed in Chapter 28, Charcuterie.
MISE EN PLACE
	 zest and juice limes.
Procedure for Preparing Mousses
1 Prepare the base, which is usually a custard sauce, melted chocolate or puréed fruit.
2 If gelatin is used, it is softened first, then dissolved in the warm base.
3 Fold in whipped pasteurized egg whites (if using). If the base is slightly warm when the egg 
whites are added, their proteins will coagulate, making the mousse firmer and more stable.
4 allow the mixture to cool completely, then fold in whipped cream (if using). note that the 
egg whites are folded in before any whipped cream. although the egg whites may deflate 
somewhat during folding, if the cream is added first it may become overwhipped when the 
egg whites are added, creating a grainy or coarse product.

FROZEN DESSERTS
Frozen desserts include ice cream and gelato as well as desserts assembled with ice 
cream, such as baked Alaska, bombes, coupes and parfaits. Frozen fruit purées, known 
as sorbets and sherbets, are also included in this category. Still-frozen desserts, known as 
semifreddi, are made from custards or mousses that are frozen without churning.
When making any frozen mixture, remember that cold dulls flavors. Even if some￾thing tastes perfect at room temperature, flavors seem weaker when a mixture is cold. 
Thus it may be necessary to oversweeten or overflavor creams or custards that will be 
frozen for service.
Although liquors and liqueurs are common flavoring ingredients, alcohol drastically 
lowers a liquid mixture’s freezing point. Too much alcohol prevents the mixture from 
freezing, so any liqueurs or liquors must be used in moderation.

Ice Cream and Gelato
Ice cream and gelato are custards that are churned during freezing. They can be flavored 
with an endless variety of fruits, nuts, liqueurs, cookies and candies. Contemporary 
chefs and boutique ice cream producers also offer products made with vegetables, 
herbs and savory flavorings such as bacon. The USDA has established standards for the 
labeling of frozen products. They require that products labeled ice cream contain at 
least 10 percent milkfat and 20 percent milk solids and have no more than 50 percent 
overrun. French-style ice creams (frozen custards) contain a higher percentage of egg 
yolks and cream than standard ice cream. Gelato is an Italian-style ice cream made 
primarily with milk. Although it has a low milkfat content—from 4 to 9 percent—gelato 
is denser than American-style products because less air is incorporated during churn￾ing. Ice milk refers to products that do not meet the standards for ice cream. Low-fat 
products made without cream or egg yolks are also available, as are vegan options and 
versions made without dairy products. Frozen yogurt uses yogurt as its base. Although 
touted as a nutritious substitute for ice cream, frozen yogurt may have whole milk or 
cream added for richness and smoothness.
One hallmark of good ice cream and gelato is smoothness. The ice crystals that would 
normally form during freezing can be avoided by incorporating air through constant stir￾ring or churning. The air causes the mixture to expand. Gelato is denser than ice cream 
because it has less incorporated air. Good-quality ice creams have enough air to make 
them light; inferior products often contain excessive overrun and are therefore too light. 
The difference becomes obvious when equal volumes are weighed.
Many food service operations use ice cream makers that have internal freezing units to 
chill the mixture while churning it. Most commercial machines are suitable for churning 
either ice cream or sorbet. Follow the manufacturer’s directions for using and cleaning

 Safety Alert
Ice Cream
It is important to exercise extra care when 
preparing ice cream products because ice 
cream contains several foods that may 
require time and temperature control for 
safety (tCs), such as cream, milk and eggs. 
Properly cooking ice cream bases and using 
pasteurized egg products helps ensure a 
safe product. Ice cream makers have many 
grooves and crevices where bacteria can 
hide and grow. always break down and 
clean an ice cream maker after each use, 
and sanitize all pieces according to the 
manufacturer’s directions. never store 
frozen ice cream products in a container 
that held raw or unprocessed custard 
without first cleaning and sanitizing the 
container. and, of course, wash your hands 
thoroughly and wear gloves when working 
with ice cream products.
Ice Cream through History
early ancestors of today’s ice creams were 
flavored water ices, sometimes made from 
snow, which have been popular in China since 
prehistoric times. these were watery, slushy 
mixtures that were also popular with traders 
and merchants along the silk road. similar 
treats have been popular in the mediterranean 
and middle east since the Golden age of 
Greece. In fact, alexander the Great had a 
penchant for wine-flavored ices, made with 
ice brought down from the mountains by 
runners. the roman emperor nero served 
his guests mixtures of fruit crushed with 
snow and honey. the saracens brought their 
knowledge of making flavored ices with them 
when they migrated to sicily in the ninth 
century. and 12th-century crusaders returned 
to Western europe with memories of middle 
eastern sherbets. similar frozen or shaved ice 
refreshments are widely popular today, such as 
Italy’s sorbet, China’s baobing, mexico’s paletas, 
Japan’s kakigōri and, of course, north america’s 
snow cone.
the Italians are said to have developed 
gelato from a recipe brought back from China 
by marco Polo in the 13th century. somehow 
the dish spread to england by the 15th century, 
where it was recorded that King Henry V served 
it at his coronation banquet. Catherine de 
medici brought the recipe with her when she 
married the future king of France in 1533. a 
different flavor was served during each of the 
34 days of their marriage festivities.
Ice cream as we know it today was first 
sold to the public in Paris during the late 
17th century. It was available at fashionable 
cafés serving another new treat: coffee. French 
chefs quickly developed many elaborate 
desserts using ice creams, including bombes, 
coupes and parfaits.
many of america’s founders—thomas 
Jefferson, alexander Hamilton and James and 
dolley madison—were confirmed ice cream 
addicts. George Washington spent more than 
$200, a very princely sum, for ice cream during 
the summer of 1790.
the mechanized ice cream freezer was 
invented in 1846, setting the stage for mass 
production and wide availability. By the late 
19th century, ice cream parlors were popular 
gathering places.
despite the disappearance of most ice cream 
wagons, soda fountains and lunch counters, 
all of which were popular ice cream purveyors 
for much of the 20th century, ice cream sales 
remain steady. the united states is among 
the world’s top consumers, at 23 pounds per 
person per year, more than 80 percent of which 
is sold in supermarkets or convenience stores. 
the public’s demand for high-fat, homemade￾style, “super-premium” ice creams with rich 
and often-elaborate flavor combinations shows 
no sign of declining.

Procedure for Preparing Ice Creams
1 Prepare a custard sauce: Place the milk and/or cream in a heavy saucepan. If a vanilla bean 
is being used, it may be added at this time.
2 Whisk the egg yolks and sugar together in a mixing bowl.
3 Bring the liquid just to a low boil. temper the egg mixture with approximately one-third of 
the hot liquid.
4 Pour the tempered eggs into the remaining hot liquid and return the mixture to the heat.
5 Cook, stirring constantly, until the custard reaches 180–185°F (82–85°C) and is 
slightly thickened.
6 remove the ice cream base from the hot saucepan immediately by pouring it through a fine 
mesh strainer into a clean bowl. (If left in the hot saucepan, it will overcook.) Flavorings 
may be added at this time.
7 Cool the cooked ice cream base over an ice bath to 40°F (4°C). store covered and 
refrigerated at 36°F (2°C) for 24 hours to mature the ice cream base before processing.
8 Process according to the machine manufacturer’s directions. add any pieces of chocolate, 
fruit or nuts at the end of churning so they retain their shape and size.

Sorbet and Sherbet
Sorbet is a churned mixture of sugar, water and fruit juice, wine, liqueurs or other fla￾vorings. (Herb and vegetable flavorings are especially suitable for sorbet.) It is served as 
a first course, a palate refresher between courses or a dessert.
Sorbet may be made with fresh, frozen or canned fruit. A wide variety of quality, 
 all-natural frozen purées are also available for sorbet making. Granulated sugar or sugar 
syrup is added for flavor and body. Pasteurized egg whites may also be added during 
churning for improved texture; the protein in the whites coats the water crystals as the 
sorbet freezes. Often an invert sugar such as corn syrup or glucose replaces some of the 
granulated sugar to prevent graininess.
Sherbet is an Americanization of the French word sorbet, which has taken on a slightly 
different meaning on this side of the Atlantic. When it contains fruit juice and sugar, 
sherbet is identical to sorbet. But milk is often added to the mixture before churning, 
making it somewhat richer than sorbet and more appropriate to serve at the end of a 
meal than as a first course or palate refresher.
The ratio of sugar to fruit purée or juice depends to some extent on the natural 
sweetness of the specific fruit as well as personal preference. If too much sugar is used, 
 however, the mixture will be soft and syrupy. If too little sugar is used, the sorbet will be 
very hard and grainy. Following the formula carefully helps avoid this problem.

Still-Frozen Desserts
Still-frozen desserts (It. semifreddi) are made with frozen mousse, custard or cream. 
Layers of spongecake and/or fruit may be added for flavor and texture. Because these 
mixtures are frozen without churning, air must be incorporated by folding in relatively 
large amounts of whipped cream or meringue. The air helps keep the mixture smooth 
and prevents it from becoming too hard.
Still-frozen products include frozen soufflés, marquise, mousses and neapolitans. 
The Chocolate Hazelnut Marquise recipe in the online resources for this chapter, is an 
example of a still-frozen dessert.
marquise a frozen mousse-like dessert, 
usually chocolate
neapolitan a three-layered loaf or cake of frozen 
mousse or ice cream; each layer is a different 
flavor and different color, a typical combination 
is chocolate, vanilla and strawberry

DESSERT SAUCES
Pastries and desserts are often accompanied by sweet sauces. Dessert sauces provide 
moisture, flavor and texture and enhance plate presentation. Sauces may be based on 
milk and cream, such as Vanilla Custard Sauce (page 1092), the principal dessert sauce. 
Like any master sauce, custard sauce can be flavored and colored with chocolate, 
coffee extract, liquor or fruit compound as desired. Other dessert sauces include fruit 
purées, caramel sauce and chocolate syrup. Sauces should be selected to contrast or 
complement the dessert or pastry with which they are served. For example, a raspberry 
soufflé can be complemented by an intense raspberry purée or contrasted with a rich 
chocolate sauce.
Fruit Purées
Many types of fruit can be puréed for dessert sauces; strawberries, raspberries, blackber￾ries, apricots, mangoes and papayas are popular choices. They produce thick sauces 
with strong flavors and colors. Fresh ripe fruit or individually quick-frozen (IQF) fruit 
are recommended. Several commercial brands of prepared fruit purées are available. 
The best use only natural fruits and are excellent for making sauces and sorbets. They 
provide consistent flavor and color, reduce preparation time, and make out-of-season or 
hard-to-obtain tropical fruits available at a reasonable price.
Puréed fruit sauces, also known as coulis, can be cooked or uncooked. Cooking 
thickens the sauces by reduction and allows any starch thickener to gelatinize. They can 
also be sweetened with granulated sugar or sugar syrup. The amount of sweetener will 
vary depending on the fruit’s natural sweetness and personal preference.
 Procedure for Preparing a Fruit Coulis
1 Wash, peel and chop the fruit if necessary. thaw frozen fruit before using.
2 Purée the fruit in a food mill, blender or food processor. strain to remove seeds, if desired.
3 Combine the purée with flavorings and sweeteners (if using).

Caramel Sauce
Caramel sauce is a mixture of caramelized sugar and heavy cream enriched with whole 
butter. A liqueur or citrus juice may be used for added flavor. Citrus juice is also added 
to help prevent sugar crystals forming in the sauce. Review the material on caramelizing 
sugar in Chapter 30, Principles of the Bakeshop, before making caramel sauce.

saucepan on the stove top over high heat and bring to a boil. Brush down the sides of the pan with 
a pastry brush dipped in water to remove any sugar granules.
2 When the sugar comes to a boil, add the lemon juice. swirl the pan gently, but do not stir the sugar, 
as this may cause lumping. Continue boiling until the sugar caramelizes at approximately 338°F 
(170°C). It will turn a dark golden brown and produce a rich aroma.
3 remove the saucepan from the heat. Gradually add the cream. Be extremely careful, as the hot 
caramel may splatter. Whisk in the cream to blend.
4 add the pieces of butter. stir until the butter melts completely. If necessary, return the sauce to the 
stove to reheat enough to melt the butter.

ASSEMBLING DESSERTS
Many pastries and other desserts are assembled from the baked doughs discussed in 
Chapter 33, Pies, Pastries and Cookies; the cakes, frostings and glazes discussed in Chapter 34, 
Cakes and Frostings; and the creams, custards and other products discussed in this 
chapter. Many of these desserts are classic presentations requiring the precise arrange￾ment of specific components. With a basic mastery of the skills presented in this book, 
students and chefs can apply creativity, taste and judgment to combine these components 
into a wide selection of unique and tempting desserts.
Assembled pastries and other desserts generally consist of three principal compo￾nents: the base, the filling and the garnish. The base is the dough, crust or cake product 
that provides structure and forms the foundation for the final product. The filling refers 
to whatever is used to add flavor, texture and body to the final product. The garnish is 
any glaze, fruit, sauce or accompaniment used to complete the dish.
The following are important guidelines for assembling desserts:
	▪ There should be a proper blend of complementary and contrasting 
flavors. For example, pears, red wine and blue cheese go well 
together, as do chocolate and raspberries. Do not combine flavors 
simply for the sake of originality, however.
	▪ There should be a proper blend of complementary and contrasting 
textures. For example, crisp puff pastry, soft pastry cream and 
tender strawberries are combined for a strawberry napoleon.
	▪ There should be a proper blend of complementary and contrasting 
colors. For example, a garnish of red raspberries and green mint 
adds life to a brown-on-brown chocolate torte.
	▪ Garnishes should not be overwhelming or garish.
	▪ The base should be strong enough to hold the filling and garnish 
without collapsing, yet thin or tender enough to cut easily with a 
fork.
	▪ The filling or garnish may cause the base to become soft or even 
soggy. This may or may not be desirable. If you want a crisp 
base, assemble the product very close to service. If you want this 
softening to occur, assemble the product in advance of service.
	▪ Consider the various storage and keeping qualities of the 
individual components. It may be best to assemble or finish some 
products at service time.
	▪ The final construction should not be so elaborate or fragile that it 
cannot be portioned or served easily or attractively.
	▪ Consider whether the product would be better prepared as individual portions 
or as one large item. This may depend on the desired plate presentation and 
the ease and speed with which a large product can be cut and portioned for 
service.
Today’s restaurant desserts are a far cry from a humble slice of apple pie and scoop 
of ice cream, although a well-crafted pie using ripe fruit in season cannot be beat. With 
the popularity of plated desserts, pastry chefs have more opportunities to develop their 
style. Plated desserts may include several sweets on one visually stunning plate: a main 
item served hot accompanied by a cold garnish and something acidic or crunchy as a 
contrast. Concepts for presenting desserts are covered in more detail in Chapter 36, Plate 
Presentation. A balance among contrasting tastes, textures and temperatures allows a 
dessert plate to appeal to all the senses.

Granita (Fr. granité) is made with fruit or other flavorings but with less sugar than sorbet. This 
produces a mixture that will freeze harder than sorbet. Instead of being churned, the granita mixture 
is still-frozen in a shallow stainless steel container, then scraped with a fork or spoon to obtain grainy 
flakes. Or, as the mixture freezes and ice crystals form, the mixture is periodically stirred until 
granulation is complete.

 Finally it is time to put down the spatula and set the whisk aside. the food is 
ready to be served. although food preparation is very much a science, food pre￾sentation is an art. Good plate presentation results from careful attention to the 
colors, shapes, textures and arrangements of the foods. Great plate presentation requires 
experience and style. 
 this chapter describes several methods of presenting foods. For every guideline suggested, 
there are exceptions. note that these examples are not meant to take the place of more tra￾ditional techniques. they are intended only to spark the imagination. With experience your 
personal style as a chef will evolve. the final step in food preparation is to justify the hours 
of hard work spent cooking the food by serving and presenting it properly. it is important 
that the creativity and skill that go into preparing food are not wasted because of a sloppy 
presentation or an unattractive garnish. 
Service is the process of delivering foods to diners in the proper fashion. Hot foods 
should be served very hot and on heated plates; cold foods should be served very cold and 
on chilled plates. Foods should be cooked to the proper degree of doneness: a roast rack of 
lamb ordered medium rare should be medium rare—not medium, not rare. Pasta should be 
served al dente—slightly chewy, not mushy. Bread should be fresh, not stale. Portion sizes 
should be appropriate. First courses and appetizers should be small enough so that the diner 
can still appreciate the courses that follow. 
Presentation is the process of offering the selected foods to diners in a way that is visu￾ally pleasing. When presenting foods, always bear in mind that diners consume first with 
their eyes. the foods’ colors, textures, shapes and arrangements must work together to form 
a pleasing composition on the plate. any decorative touches such as sauces or garnishes 
should be done thoughtfully and well. Most important, plates should be neat and clean. 
inspect all plates before they leave the kitchen; wipe away fingerprints, drops of sauce or 
specks of food with a clean towel. 
 Presentation techniques are divided in this chapter into two broad categories: techniques 
applied to specific foods and techniques applied to the plate as a whole. Most of the tech￾niques and concepts described here are illustrated with foods or recipes that appear elsewhere 
in the text. a brief discussion on small plates concludes the chapter. 
 PRESENTATION TECHNIQUES FOR FOODS 
 The most attractive foods are always the ones that are properly prepared, but some 
food can be made even more attractive by cutting or molding it into various shapes. 
Both techniques—cutting and molding—preserve the integrity of the food. In other 
words, neither technique changes the food itself but only changes the presentation of 
the food. 
 Preparing Foods Properly 
 Foods look best when handled properly and cooked with care. A sirloin steak grilled 
medium rare should be pink inside; its surface should glisten and be branded with 
 well-defined and neatly executed crosshatch marks. When serving asparagus with 
 composition a completed plate’s structure of 
colors, shapes and arrangements 
M36_LABE1163_07_SE_C36.indd 1120 31/10/23 9:38 PMPl ate Presentation 1121
hollandaise, the stalks should be bright green and crisp looking; the hollandaise sauce 
should be smooth and shiny, not grainy or dull. A lemon meringue pie should be attrac￾tively browned on top; the filling should be a true lemony yellow and the crust golden 
brown and without cracks.
Whether a recipe calls for browning foods under a salamander before service, wrap￾ping a chicken galantine in cheesecloth to maintain its shape or adding vinegar when 
braising red cabbage, proper cooking procedures can enhance the texture, shape and 
color of many cooked foods. Throughout this text we have discussed the proper cooking 
procedures for many, many foods. By using these instructions, you can properly prepare 
food and ensure that it will be attractive to diners.
Cutting Foods
The careful cutting of foods often increases visual appeal and reflects the chef’s atten￾tion to detail. Here we distinguish between cutting food items used to decorate the plate 
and cutting the foods that are consumed. Decorative garnishes, such as tomato and rad￾ish roses, scallion brushes, carved melons and the like, fall within the former category. 
Cutting foods into beautiful garnishes is an art unto itself, requiring skill and practice. 
Although beyond the scope of this text, books on creating decorative food garnishes are 
widely available.
The latter category—foods that are consumed—includes the meats, poultry, fish, 
shellfish, vegetables and starches that form the meal. Each should be carefully cut. 
Vegetables can be cut into uniform shapes and sizes such as julienne, bâtonnet or 
tournée, discussed in Chapter 6, Knife Skills. Firm vegetables, such as beets, carrots, 
leeks, parsnips, potatoes, scallions and turnips, can be sliced or julienned and 
 deep-fried to add color, flavor and texture to a plated dish. Stalk vegetables, such as 
asparagus, pictured in the photograph to the right, can be transformed by shaving 
them into thin slices.
If serving sliced meats or poultry, the slices should be even and of a consistent 
thickness. Fish can be cut into tranches as discussed in Chapter 20, Fish and Shellfish. 
Individual stew ingredients and soup or salad garnishes should be of uniform sizes. All 
these techniques are simple, fundamental and effective.
Some foods take the shape of the pan in which they are cooked. Polenta and escal￾loped potatoes, for example, can be presented attractively when baked in and removed 
from individual casseroles, or they can be baked in a hotel pan and cut into various 
shapes according to the procedures that follow.
Procedure for Cutting Polenta
1 Cook the polenta according to the recipe. When it is done, pour the polenta onto a well￾oiled half-sheet pan. Chill until firm.
2 once the polenta is firm, flip the pan over onto a worktable. lift off the pan; the polenta 
will come out easily. Using a chef ’s knife or circular cutters, cut the polenta into the desired 
shape. the pieces of polenta can be sautéed or grilled for service. reserve any trim to use as 
a garnish for soups and as a thickener for stews or reshape and pan-fry.

the top.
➋ Carefully lift off the ring.
1 select a recipe that produces a firm finished product so that the finished dish holds its 
shape after cutting.
2 Bake the sliced vegetables (often potatoes) in a well-greased pan and refrigerate until cold and 
firm. Cut chilled food into various shapes with a chef’s knife or circular cutters and remove 
them to a clean pan with a spatula. reserve any trim to use in less formal plate presentations.
3 For service, reheat the cut pieces in a 325°F (160°C) oven until hot.
 Molding Foods
Some foods, particularly cooked vegetables bound by sauces, grains or bound salads, 
can be molded into attractive shapes by using metal rings, circular cutters, ramekins, 
timbale molds or other forms. These molded forms create height and keep the plate neat 
and clean. For example, molded Ratatouille (page 676) forms the base for a crisp portion 
of seared sea bass, as shown in the photograph below. For a reinterpretation of rata￾touille, a mold was used to hold slices of cooked vegetables upright before unmolding.
Procedure for Molding Vegetables

Procedure for Molding Grains
1 Fill a timbale mold, soup cup or other mold of the appropriate size and shape with the hot 
grains, firmly pressing them together.
2 For à la carte service, immediately unmold the grains onto the serving plate by placing the 
mold upside down on the plate and tapping its sides and bottom.
3 For banquet service place the filled molds in a hotel pan and refrigerate until needed. 
shortly before service fill the hotel pan with hot water to a point about two-thirds up the 
side of the molds. Be careful not to splash any water onto the grains. Cover the pan with 
foil and place in the oven. Heat until the grains are hot, then unmold and plate as desired.
Many soft and creamy foods can be molded into small ovals. One example is the 
dumpling-shaped quenelle discussed in Chapter 28, Charcuterie. Purées and mousses, 
such as mashed potatoes, risotto and salmon mousseline, as well as ice creams, cus￾tards and sorbets can be attractively shaped into quenelles as shown below using two 
large spoons.

PRESENTATION TECHNIQUES FOR THE PLATE
The goal of plate presentation is a balanced, harmonious composition. Great care should 
be taken when placing foods on the plates. Garnishes, crumbs and sauces can further 
enhance the plate composition. Some techniques, such as decorating a dessert plate 
with powdered sugar, do not substantially affect the flavors of the foods; they only make 
the completed presentation more attractive. Other techniques (e.g., garnishing a dessert 
with finely chopped nuts or painting a plate with sauces) add flavor and texture to the 
finished dish.
 Choosing Plates
Restaurant china designed to withstand the rigors of repeated use is available in many 
different shapes, sizes, colors and styles. It is often the chef’s responsibility to choose 
the china appropriate for the food being served. Frequently, specific plates will be 
used for specific dishes, such as a white, oven-proof pottery ramekin for Crème Brûlée 
shown on page 1096.
Plate Sizes and Shapes
Plates come in all shapes and sizes; round plates are classic, but oval plates (also referred 
to as platters) and rectangular, square and triangular plates are also popular. Plates are 
available in a variety of sizes from a small 4-inch (10-centimeter) bread plate to a large salmon mousse with smoked salmon garnish
M36_LABE1163_07_SE_C36.indd 1123 31/10/23 9:38 PM1124 CHaPter tHirtY-siX
14-inch (35-centimeter) charger or base plate. Plates are typically concave; their depths 
vary within a limited range of about 1 inch (2.5 centimeters). Plates may have rims of 
varying widths or may be rimless. Soup bowls can also be rimmed or rimless. Soup 
plates are usually larger and shallower than soup bowls and have wide rims. Rimless 
soup cups are used for serving smaller portions. Plates are also designed for specific pur￾poses, such as those with small indentations for holding escargots, or long, rectangular 
plates with grooves for holding asparagus.
Choose plates large enough to hold the food comfortably without overcrowding or 
spilling. Oversized, rimmed soup plates are popular for serving any food with a sauce. 
Be careful when using oversized plates, however, as the portion of food may seem too 
small, creating poor value perception.
Whether a round, oval or less conventionally shaped plate is used, be sure to choose 
one with a size and shape that best highlights the food and supports the composition. 
For example, in the photograph on page 1123, the asymmetrical pentagon-shaped 
bowl with graceful curved edges and a raised rim accentuates the geometrically simple 
yet effective composition of the oval salmon timbale draped with a slice of smoked 
salmon.
Plate Colors and Patterns
Although styles of plates change from year to year, white and cream are by far the most 
common colors for restaurant china. Almost any food looks good on these neutral col￾ors. Colored and patterned plates can be used quite effectively to accent food, however. 
The obvious choice is to contrast dark plates with bright- or light-colored foods and 
light plates with dark-colored foods. The food should always be the focal point of any 
plate. The colors and shapes in the plate pattern should blend well and harmonize with 
the foods served. The intense blue color on the plate shown to the left, for example, 
contrasts effectively with the beurre blanc sauce and uniform beige spheres of pan￾seared scallops.
Arranging Foods on Plates
Compose plates to make the food appetizing to the diner. First, make sure that the 
amount of food being served is appropriate for the meal and the course. Then create 
a well-balanced composition by carefully considering the shapes, colors, textures and 
composition of items on the plate.
Shapes
For visual interest and drama, combine a variety of shapes on the plate. The plated 
venison entrée shown to the left is an excellent example of simple shapes artfully 
 combined: round venison medallions with oval fingerling potatoes and long spears of 
carrots and baby zucchini. The three complementary shapes lend harmony and charac￾ter to the dish.
 Colors
Foods come in a rainbow of colors. When appropriate, foods of different colors should 
be presented together. Generally the colors should provide balance and contrast. But 
no matter how well prepared or planned, some dishes simply have dull, boring or 
similar colors. When this is the case, try adding another ingredient or garnish for a 
splash of color. Complementary colors, those directly opposite each other on the color 
wheel such as red and green or yellow and purple, look good together in plating 
designs. A sauce with chopped herbs, a vegetable medley combining peas and carrots 
or well-browned foods contrast well. The flecks of crisp green chives shown on the 
following page work well with the flavors in the dish and add striking color notes to a 
plated lobster entrée that would otherwise be monochromatic. The artful placement of 
the curved lobster claws also adds to the visual appeal.

Textures
Texture refers to the sensation perceived when eating a food as well as the appearance 
of the surface of the food. A food’s texture may be crisp, crumbly, grainy, flaky, smooth 
or creamy. Mashed potatoes and carrot purée both look smooth and soft. Salmon mous￾seline and spinach soufflé both have slightly grainy surfaces. Rösti potatoes and meatloaf 
both appear coarse. The flavors of each food in these pairs differ; their visual textures 
do not.
Typically foods with similar textures look boring together; foods with different tex￾tures look more exciting when paired. Serve carrots cut into julienne with the mashed 
potatoes to achieve a balance of hard and soft textures. Plate steamed leaf spinach with 
the salmon mousseline for a combination of smooth and grainy textures. Offer a baked 
potato with the meatloaf so fluffy and coarse textures are paired in your presentation. 
These pairings maintain the same range of flavors as the pairs mentioned in the previous 
paragraph but provide different visual textures.
Using various cooking techniques helps add texture to the plate. Crisp fried and crusty 
baked foods contrast with smooth, soft ones such as fried chicken with mashed potatoes 
or poached salmon with roasted asparagus. Achieving a balance of texture on a plate can 
be as simple as adding a crisp garnish such as the fried julienned vegetables shown here 
served with a rack of lamb. This plate harmoniously combines several textures in one 
dish: the pebbly rice, the slices of smooth lamb and the coarse fried vegetables.
Another reason to vary the cooking techniques on a plate is for kitchen efficiency. 
A plate consisting of only sautéed items, such as sautéed fillet of sole with a pan sauce 
served with sautéed spinach, for example, would put pressure on the sauté station. Each 
component of such a dish would need to be cooked at the last moment by the sauté 
cook and plated at once. Serving the sautéed fillet of sole with a sauce that can be pre￾pared ahead and held for service reduces pressure on the sauté cook as does offering 
a baked or broiled side dish. Consider elements that can be prepared in advance or by 
different cooking stations to simplify plating.
Composition
Having decided on the colors, textures and shapes of the foods that will go on the plate, 
the next choice is where to place each individual item to achieve a balanced and unified 
composition. A well-balanced composition is achieved with careful consideration of the 
arrangement of featured or main items on the plate as well as the negative space—sections 
of the plate that will not be covered with food. During recipe development, chefs often 
use a plate diagram to visualize the final composition. Like an artist who sketches a 
rough outline before completing a canvas, a chef sketches out where the featured food 
item(s) and garnishes are placed on the plate. For example, the featured item may be 
placed in a triangular, a bull’s-eye or an asymmetrical layout as shown in Figures 36.1, 
36.2 and 36.3. These are just a few of the countless layouts you can use to inspire your 
culinary artistry.
Once you have decided on the plate layout for the featured food items, consider these 
general guidelines when selecting and arranging any complementary items:
	▪ Strike a balance between overcrowding the plate and leaving large gaps of 
space. Foods should not hang over the plate rim nor be confined to the very 
center of the plate. As a rule of thumb, leave a small margin of space, ½–1 inch 
(1–2.5 centimeters), between the food on the plate and the edge of the plate or rim.
	▪ Consider the number of elements on the plate such as pieces of meat or 
garnishes. In visual design, odd numbers create a desirable tension and even 
numbers can be boring.
	▪ Choose a focal point for the plate—that is, a point to which the eye is drawn. 
This may be the highest point on the plate. Or it may be the center of a linear 
arrangement that flows across the plate symmetrically.
	▪ Design the plate with the highest point to the rear or center. Avoid placing foods 
of equal heights around the edge of the plate, leaving a hole in the center—the 
eye will naturally be drawn to that gap. See Figure 36.2.

M36_LABE1163_07_SE_C36.indd 1125 31/10/23 9:38 PM1126 CHaPter tHirtY-siX
	▪ The plate’s composition should flow naturally. It makes sense to establish the 
highest point at the back of the plate (12 o’clock from the customer’s viewpoint) 
with the rest of the food becoming gradually shorter toward the front of the plate. 
Fanning slices of food can also focus the eye and help establish flow.
	▪ Select garnishes and sauces for color as well as flavor. Orange and green are both 
secondary colors that work well together on the plate in Figure 36.3.
The seared scallops in Figure 36.2 elegantly illustrate these principles. Height is 
 established by a structure composed of the squash purée, seared scallops and squash 
garnishes placed near the back of the plate. Its height, position and striking appearance 
make it the focal point. The cascade of cooked cauliflower, fried sage leaves and 
 translucent sauce is in front of this focal point, drawing the viewer into the plate.
When planning the arrangement of foods and the accompanying garnishes on a plate, 
you must also keep the level of service and menu pricing in mind. In a casual diner or 
intimate café with a small kitchen staff and modest prices, a simple approach is appropri￾ate. The featured item accompanied by a vegetable, a starch and some sauce may suffice. 
Designing a plate with several garnishes requires more time and staff to prepare and 
execute than a simpler plate. In a formal restaurant that offers a tasting menu, elaborate 
plating is expected by guests. Such restaurants have the staff required to execute such 
plates and charge for this accordingly.

the breast is sliced in this presentation, the 
same portion of chicken appears larger than 
in the traditional composition shown in the 
photograph on the left.
this plating of the chicken breast features baby 
carrots and candy cane beets. Visual interest 
is created by cutting the chicken breast in 
half and stacking it at an angle. the artfully 
arranged carrot tops create a gentle 
arc punctuated with dabs of pan gravy and 
beet purée.
Deconstructed plating reinterprets traditional dishes and presents foods in unex￾pected ways. A chef may take the elements in a traditional preparation such as spaghetti 
and meatballs or lemon meringue pie and separate them into their component parts. 
The photograph below shows a Black Forest cherry cake reinterpreted into a plated 
dessert with the flavors and components of the classic cake presented in a fresh new 
way. The cake is transformed into a bar of dark chocolate, the cake’s traditional creamy 
filling becomes a vanilla mousse and the cherry notes in the original are expressed in 
the quenelle of cherry sorbet and fresh cherry garnish. Deconstructed plates arrange the 
main item and garnishes artistically on the plate. Such plates encourage diners to sample 
the flavors separately or in combination.

Decorating Plates
The colors, textures, shapes and arrangements of foods on a plate can be improved by 
decorating the plate with herbs, greens, spices and other garnishes or sauces. If any 
of these are applied after the principal food is placed on the plate, be prepared to do 
so quickly so that the food is served at its proper temperature. Plates, bowls or other 
serving pieces must be chilled or heated before service. An attractive plate of properly 
prepared food will disappoint if it arrives cold (or melted) because of the time spent 
assembling it. Have the proper tools available to help staff plate food precisely. Spoons, 
forks, small spatulas, plating tweezers, pastry bags, squeeze bottles and clean towels 
ease the work of assembling and decorating plates.
Garnishing Plates with Herbs and Greens
Using fresh herbs and greens is one of the easiest ways to add color, texture and flow to 
a plate. Whether the herbs or greens are an ingredient in the dish (a functional garnish) 
or merely a decoration, they should always complement the foods and be consistent 
with their seasonings. A sprig of fresh rosemary garnishing a beautifully roasted rack 
of lamb or tiny leaves of chervil garnishing delicately poached fillets of sole are natural 
combinations. Microgreens add a delicate-tasting, light and lacy garnish to many dishes. 
Sprigs of fresh green mint (often with a fresh berry or two) can be the perfect decoration 
for a dessert plate.
Provided they complement the food, very finely chopped nuts can also be used to 
decorate plates for sweet or savory foods. Plates for savory foods may be decorated by 
sprinkling them with finely chopped herbs or minced vegetables, such as a combination 
of brightly colored peppers.
To save time, herbs, microgreens, edible flowers, cut or sliced fruit or vegetables and 
other perishable garnishes may be prepared before service. Stretch a piece of plastic 
wrap tightly over a half-sheet tray or small plate. Wash, slice, trim and prepare the gar￾nishes then lay them out on the plastic wrap leaving space between each garnish. Keep 
these garnishes refrigerated. Use plating tweezers or a small spatula to remove them 
from the plastic wrap and place them on the food as needed.

Decorating Plates with Sauces
The sauce is an integral part of most any dish. Sauce adds flavor and moisture; it also 
adds color, texture and flow to the plate. A rich, glossy bordelaise or Madeira sauce 
pooled beneath sautéed tournedos of beef is a classic example. Sauces are also used in 
other, less traditional ways to add visual appeal. For example, cream sauces and light 
mousses can be foamed and applied as a garnish using a whipping siphon. This tech￾nique is illustrated in the photograph below of risotto garnished with shrimp and corn 
mousse. Or if a dish calls for a generous amount of sauce, the service staff can pour the 
sauce tableside after the dish is presented, as illustrated in the photograph below of a 
fish and asparagus presentation. Tableside service adds drama to the presentation and 
ensures that the sauce is served at the correct temperature.

is simply to drizzle or spoon the sauce onto the plate. In this photograph of plated veni￾son, a rich game fond is boldly spooned onto the plate in an abstract swirl echoed in the 
curved shape of the venison chop.

Alternatively, sauces can be applied to a plate using squirt bottles. A tomato syrup is 
added to a plate of seared scallops with tomatillo sauce using a small squirt bottle in the 
photograph below. Squirt bottles can also be used to create abstract patterns or representa￾tional designs. For example, thick salad dressings or reduced sauces can be artfully squirted 
to create interest and eye appeal as shown in the photograph below.

Ladles, pastry brushes, spatulas, spoons and other simple kitchen tools help when 
applying sauces, as shown in the following photographs.

Whichever style of saucing you choose, strive for consistency and neatness. This 
is always important but especially so when plating at a banquet or event where 
many people are being served the same dish. The slices of New York Cheesecake in 
this photograph illustrate skilled plating and saucing. The cut edges are clean and 
crisp. A consistent quantity of berry sauce is poured neatly over one side of each 
slice.

 PRESENTATION TECHNIQUES FOR BUFFETS 
 The same artistry and technique applied to individual plated dishes must also be used 
when presenting larger quantities of food. The chef is responsible for arranging foods 
on their serving pieces for family-style service and buffet service . (See Chapter 37 , Buffet 
Presentation.) Most hot foods are presented in chafing dishes, whereas cold or room￾temperature foods are usually served on trays, platters, bowls or mirrors. Chafing dishes
are metal dishes, usually rectangular or round, with a heat source (flame or electric) 
located beneath, which are used to keep the foods warm. Foods are placed in a hotel 
pan or other receptacle that sits above a pan of hot water inside the chafing dish frame. 
 Arranging Food on Serving Pieces 
 Many foods, especially cold foods, breads and pastries can be arranged on a variety of 
platters, trays, baskets and serving pieces, depending on the size and style of the buffet. 
Trays, platters and mirrors for presenting foods are available in many sizes and shapes. 
They come in a wide variety of materials, including metal (silver, copper, tin and steel), 
ceramics, glass, mirrors, plastic, wood or stone, especially slate and marble. The choice 
depends on the theme. Silver and mirror trays create a more formal feel at an event; 
ceramic and wood offer a more casual look. 
 Once the serving piece is chosen, the chef must arrange the food considering 
the following: 
▪ Height: The eye is naturally drawn toward the highest point on a platter or tray; 
typically, this will be the focal point. It can be an edible garnish or a grosse piece . 
Although the highest point is sometimes in the center of the tray, it is more often 
located toward the rear, either in the middle or off to one side. Foods placed 
at a level higher than the tray’s centerpiece usually distract from the overall 
appearance. 
▪ Pattern: Whenever possible, foods should be arranged in an interesting pattern. 
Three different types of canapés, each chosen for contrasting shapes, colors 
and textures, can march across a mirrored surface in alternating lines. Crudités 
can flow from baskets, bowls or hollowed squashes. Foods should generally be 
arranged in a pattern that flows toward the diner. Presentations that are higher 
around the edges than in the center tend to draw the eye into the hole in the 
center. Stack foods higher in the center or rear of the tray so that they cascade 
toward the front or edges.

diners serve themselves from a counter or table 
or are served by workers assigned to specific

are known as cafeterias 
M36_LABE1163_07_SE_C36.indd 1131 31/10/23 9:38 PM1132 CHaPter tHirtY-siX
	▪ Color: The colors of the principal foods should complement or contrast with each 
other. If they cannot (e.g., a tray of pâtés or cheeses), they should be garnished 
with attractively contrasting colored foods such as breads, crackers, fruits, 
vegetables and herbs.
	▪ Texture and shape: Try to incorporate a variety of shapes and textures in displays. 
For example, avoid building trays with circular slices of liver pâte garnished with 
circular salmon mousse molds and round tartlets of a vegetable purée. As all 
of these have the same shape and very similar textures, the presentation is not 
compelling. Instead consider molding the mousse or tartlets into different shapes 
or filling the tartlets with a diced vegetable preparation.
	▪ Negative space: This refers to the areas left unused. Negative space is important 
in tray composition because empty space enhances the appeal of the object 
it surrounds, and unused space prevents overcrowding. Try leaving an empty 
border around a tray or some space in between clusters of food on a platter.

SMALL PLATES
Small portions once reserved for the start of a meal have taken hold as a popular din￾ing style, referred to as small-plate dining. For consumers seeking variety, eating three 
or more small plates is an appealing alternative to the traditional appetizer and entrée 
meal. Each item on a small-plate menu is usually reduced in size and price, often reduc￾ing the cost of dining out. Exposure to chef tasting menus, where numerous dishes are 
served in dainty portions, may be one reason why more people are comfortable with this 
style of dining. Or perhaps dining styles such as Spanish tapas, Chinese dim sum and 
Middle Eastern mezze have whetted consumer appetites for eclectic eating. Studies sug￾gest that consumers view eating a variety of small plates as a less formal, more relaxed 
way of dining. Small plates allow customers to experiment and try new dishes, offering a 
 lower-cost alternative to larger portions of animal-protein-dominated entrées.

The principles for composing a small plate are the same as for preparing and present￾ing any dish. Choose shapes, colors and textures of food to enhance each item on the 
plate. Arrange foods to appeal to the eye. Visual appeal is an essential component in 
ensuring guests’ satisfaction. Balance the variety of items offered on a small-plate menu 
because guests often order three or more dishes to create a meal.
While there are no specific rules to follow when creating small plates, the following 
guidelines are useful:
	▪ Reduce the portion size of a conventional entrée. From stews to sautés, any entrée 
can be adapted by reducing the portion size. A single crab cake, grilled sausage or 
large diver scallop makes an appealing small plate. As this photograph illustrates, 
a 2- to 3-ounce (60- to-90-gram) portion of seared salmon accompanied by braised 
cabbage and sauce makes an appealing and satisfying dish.
a small portion of grilled salmon on a bed of 
braised cabbage and sauce makes an appealing 
small plate.
	▪ Use an unexpected garnish with a traditional protein. Pairing a cen ter-of-plate 
food item with a salad or light vegetable instead of a heavier starch lightens 
a conventional entrée. In this photograph, frisée greens, endive and tomatoes 
dressed with herb vinaigrette accompany a duck leg confit, which might be more 
traditionally served with scalloped potatoes or wild rice.

	▪ Present entrée items in a new format. Grilled brochettes or skewers of fish, game, 
meat, poultry or vegetables served without garnishes are candidates for small￾plate menus, as are miniature versions of items such as the pulled pork sliders 
shown here.

	▪ Offer an assortment of starch dishes. Small potato or grain dishes complement 
a variety of other foods. Perfectly crisp well-seasoned French fries or a plate of 
roasted butternut squash with yogurt sauce make excellent accompaniments. 
Do not overlook the appeal of pasta or risotto served in small portions, too. 
By offering optional side dishes, guests are free to compose their own meal by 
combining a few small plates with their choice of starch items.

	▪ Highlight vegetables as center of the plate items. Fresh seasonal vegetables shine 
on small-plate menus. An assortment of cruciferous vegetables, such as the grilled 
broccoli and colorful cauliflower shown below, make compelling small plates. 
Salads presented in a novel manner such as a molded beet and corn salad satisfy 
the need for variety on small-plate menus.

	▪ Look to the breakfast, lunch and appetizer menu for inspiration. Crêpes, quiche 
and egg dishes make inviting small plates. Scotch eggs, hard-boiled eggs with 
assorted fillings, individual cheese soufflés, mini quiches or crêpes stuffed with 
mushrooms can be used on small-plate menus. Cheese and charcuterie platters 
that feature terrines, salami and condiments entice diners to share a plate before 
or with their meal.

	▪ Simplify the plating to compensate for the increased number of dishes needed. 
When portions are small, customers order more dishes, which means more plates 
to send out from the kitchen. Consider the time and labor needed to compose 
each plate when designing small-plate menus. Streamline the presentation 
accordingly.

 After studying this chapter, 
you will be able to: 
37. 1 identify opportunities for serving food 
and beverages on buffets 
37. 2 explain the basic principles for designing 
buffets 
37. 3 present and maintain buffets attractively 
and safely 
 A buffet offers diners all the dishes from a selected menu simultaneously, displayed 
in an attractive setting. Customers enjoy the benefit of being able to see the food 
offerings and serve themselves as much, or as little, as they wish of any item on 
display. A buffet offers food service professionals the opportunity to exercise their creativity 
by identifying themes and creating menus, displays and decorations to coordinate with these 
themes. 
 In this chapter, we use the word buffet to describe both the event at which all the dishes 
from a planned menu are displayed and served as well as the tables on which these foods 
are arranged and from which diners serve themselves or are served by wait staff. Buffet foods 
include virtually any of those found in this book. Another type of event is a banquet , which 
refers to a formal meal, often for a special event with entertainment or a speaker. the food at 
a banquet may be served buffet style, but buffets are not always banquets. 
 UNDERSTANDING BUFFETS 
 Buffets are carefully designed to provide foods in an attractive fashion to an anticipated 
number of people within a specified time. Hotels, restaurants, casinos, caterers and cruise 
ships pride themselves on well-designed and presented buffets. Doing so requires a col￾laborative effort among the chef, the catering sales staff and the dining room manager, 
banquet manager and senior front-of-the-house staff. Together they identify the theme 
for the event, select a location or venue and choose the menu. If the event is designed 
for a specific client, the client should participate in the planning. As soon as planning 
begins, decisions about every aspect of the buffet, or any other catered event, should be 
recorded and communicated to the staff. 
 Planning the Buffet 
 The theme sets the tone of the event. The theme may be an elegant Sunday brunch, 
a showcase for new chefs, a culinary tour of Asian markets for a convention or a New 
England clambake birthday party. Regardless of the purpose for the event—a wedding, 
bar mitzvah, business luncheon, charity ball or college reunion—the theme defines the 
menu, decorations, props, linens and dinnerware; it should also determine the music, 
lighting and other details. 
 The venue further defines and determines details of the event. Buffets are often 
prepared and served by specialized catering companies who use their own building 
or premises for events. For on-premise events, the planner is extremely familiar with 
the site, the equipment needed and how the space can best be used to ensure guest 
comfort and maximize efficiency. Off-premise catering occurs when the caterer, res￾taurant or hotel transports food and equipment to a different event location. The 
off-premise location can be virtually anywhere: a customer’s office building, a pri￾vate home, an outdoor public park or a museum filled with priceless art. The event 
staff must be well-organized but flexible and creative in order to provide guests 
with a memorable culinary experience, regardless of the challenges posed by an 
unfamiliar venue. 
 Once the theme and venue are identified, a menu is designed. Essentially a lunch or 
dinner buffet offers the full range of items found on a restaurant à la carte menu (see 
 Chapter 4 , Menus and Recipes) . The primary differences are that at a buffet the foods 
are presented all at once and the diners generally serve themselves or are served by wait 
staff stationed at the buffet table. Like an à la carte menu, the buffet menu should contain 
selections of first courses (soups and/or salads), entrées (hot and/or cold meat, poultry, 
fish and/or shellfish dishes), accompaniments (vegetables, starches and breads), desserts 
and beverages.

Breakfast buffets are especially popular in hotels. Some may only offer self-serve 
continental-style items; others may have elaborate displays, chef stations where omelets 
are prepared to order and servers available to assist guests.
Single-course buffets can be used as part of plated meals for banquets or in res￾taurants. In a single-course buffet, waiters serve most of the meal to seated guests but 
one course is presented buffet style. For example, first-course or last-course buffets add 
action during a sit-down dinner, visual interest to the room and reduce staff costs by 
having guests serve themselves at their own pace. An appetizer or salad bar, a fruit and 
cheese display or a dessert and candies buffet can accompany a traditional meal service.
Depending on the event, the menu may need to accommodate particular dietary 
or religious concerns, such as the need for vegan entrées or kosher selections. 
Although costs are a consideration, the principal factors limiting a menu are the client’s 
desires and the chef’s imagination. It is also important to consider visual appeal and 
avoid repetition.
The following guidelines can help in planning buffet menus:
	▪ Offer dishes featuring different ingredients. This avoids repetition 
and offers diners a wider array of choices. So if the buffet 
features two entrées, make one beef and the other poultry; if 
there is a third, use fish or shellfish or a vegetarian entrée. If 
there are two starch dishes, make one a pasta and the other a 
potato dish. Also avoid repeating ingredients in different dishes; 
for example, if the entrée is a stir-fry of beef and broccoli, do 
not offer steamed broccoli as a vegetable side dish.
	▪ Offer foods cooked by different methods. For example, a 
balanced menu might include beef Bourguignon (a hot braised 
meat dish), roast turkey (a hot or cold roasted poultry dish) 
and salmon with dill sauce (a cold poached fish dish).
	▪ Offer foods with different colors. Fettuccine Alfredo and 
poached sole in a béarnaise sauce may both taste good, but 
they look boring next to each other. Offer a salsa verde or 
basil pesto instead of the béarnaise sauce, or a penne with 
asparagus and tomatoes in place of the Alfredo. This variety 
will increase the buffet’s visual appeal.
Pandemic Impacts on Buffet Service
the recent global pandemic forced many 
caterers, institutional foodservice and 
buffet restaurant operators to change 
business practices or close. Corporate and 
school cafeterias switched to individually 
packaged meals. Caterers offered individual 
pre-packaged meals and moved events 
to outdoor venues. food safety practices 
implemented during the pandemic, which 
many caterers continue to practice, include 
the following:
▪ Maintain physical distance by spreading out 
buffet and serving tables to prevent close 
contact. Choose wider buffet tables to space 
out the food being offered.
▪ Arrange separate stations for appetizers, 
salads, soups or other food groups and 
staff them with masked and gloved servers to 
prevent guests from forming long lines.
▪ Reduce touch points where customers 
encounter serving utensils and food. Provide 
single use tableware that is sustainable such 
as plates and utensils made from bamboo.
▪ Offer single servings of food such as hors 
d’oeuvres on skewers or in small single￾use spoons or offer individual portions of 
packaged chips and snacks.
▪ Prepare individual charcuterie boards or 
smaller platters of food that can be replaced 
more frequently.
▪ Place clear sneeze guards over foods wherever 
possible, or protect ready-to-eat items with 
attractive, see-through covers.
▪ Provide hand sanitizer stations throughout 
the venue.

M37_LABE1163_07_SE_C37.indd 1139 31/10/23 9:41 PM1140 CHAPteR tHIRtY-seVeN
	▪ Offer foods with different textures. If two or more soups are served, make one 
a clear soup and the other a cream or purée soup; use a variety of tossed and 
bound salads, each with different principal ingredients.
	▪ Offer seasonally appropriate foods. Buffet menus may be planned months in 
advance. Consider the availability of the foods needed for the menu being 
offered. A fresh tomato, basil and mozzarella salad is ideal for a summer buffet 
but a poor choice in the winter months. Likewise a rich lamb stew may be easy 
to prepare and may hold well in a chafing dish, but it is not appropriate at a 
summer luncheon. Offer sliced grilled leg of lamb as a lighter meat option in 
warmer months.
When defining the theme and creating the menu, costs must be considered. It is 
then the responsibility of the chef, sales staff and/or dining room manager to create an 
attractive and satisfying buffet that stays within the client’s budget while providing a 
reasonable profit to the food service operation. One typical method of meeting these 
 sometimes-conflicting needs is to plan a menu that balances both high-end and less 
expensive items. When working within a budget, it is important to remember that some 
clients consider the food offered to be less important than the décor, venue or other 
aspects of an event. The client’s preferences should always lead the planning and bud￾geting process.
Communicating the Plan
The best menu and event plan is meaningless if it is not recorded and communicated 
in a timely fashion to the staff responsible for preparing and executing the event. The 
industry standard for communicating event information is a form known as a banquet 
event order (BEO). The sample BEO shown in Figure 37.1 includes the key details of a 
hypothetical business meeting and luncheon. Additional details may be included in an 
actual BEO; the format will vary from business to business, however.
A BEO form includes detailed information on more than just the menu. Date, time 
and place are important details for the kitchen and service staff, so are setup instructions, 
from the placement of tables, to the color of linens, the type of table decorations and any 
audiovisual, entertainment or logistics needed. Everyone preparing for or working at a 
banquet or catered event must know what the customer expects, how the venue will be 
set up and any unusual or special requests that must be accommodated.
Event information is often arranged on a BEO in blocks or sections covering, for 
example, menu, floorplan, bar and beverage service, audiovisual needs and decorations. 
While the price agreed to by the customer is an important part of the event contract, 
prices are often omitted from the BEOs that circulate among the staff for privacy and 
competitive reasons.
Part of a BEO covers food and beverage arrangements. The event planner and the 
host should ensure that the following information is covered in the menu section:
	▪ A complete menu, listing every item on the buffet
	▪ Information about how each buffet station will be arranged and staffed
	▪ Special dietary needs, such as vegetarian or gluten-free options
	▪ Service and setup times
	▪ Beverage service details, such as water on each table or wine served by waiters
	▪ The guaranteed number of guests and the number to actually prepare for (usually 
an overage of 5 percent is included). The guarantee is the number of guests 
the customer contracts to pay for, even if fewer actually attend. In the BEO in 
Figure 37.1, these are indicated under the headings GTD (for guaranteed) and 
PREP (for the number to actually prepare for).
Staffing needs should also be listed, including managers by name and the number 
of each type of staff who will be needed during the event. This helps managers plan 
employee schedules well in advance and recruit temporary (or on-call) staff if necessary.

DESIGNING BUFFETS
After the theme is agreed upon, members of the planning group should study the room, 
garden, patio or other venue where the event will be held. Space must be allocated for 
the buffet table(s) and the dining tables. Depending on the event, there may need to be 
space for one or more bars, a dance floor, a stage for musicians, a podium for speakers, 
audiovisual equipment for presentations and so on. When allocating space, use com￾mon sense: The buffet should be in an area with easy access to both the kitchen and the 
dining tables—neither the wait staff nor the diners should have to cross a dance floor 
or walk in front of a podium to get to the buffet. Similarly a stage or podium should be 
within good sightlines of the dining tables. All of these plans and arrangements should 
also be included with the BEO.

Arranging the Tables
Once the room’s layout is determined, the chef and/or banquet or dining room manager 
decides on the shape of the buffet table. A buffet table is usually composed of one or 
more standard-sized tables grouped together in a functional and attractive shape. Buffet 
tables can be draped with a floor-length linen tablecloth or a shorter tablecloth with a 
detachable skirt. An alternative to using standard-sized tables shrouded in linen is to use 
unique pieces of furniture such as cabinets, sideboards, armoires, garden benches, wag￾ons, wine barrels or other firm, level surfaces, draped with linens or not, as appropriate 
for the theme. Some catering facilities and hotel buffet restaurants are equipped with 
permanent, temperature-controlled buffets. These are practical and convenient when the 
same style of buffet is set up for each meal every day.
The number of diners is a critical consideration when determining the size, arrange￾ment and placement of the buffet table(s). As a general rule, a single-sided buffet can 
comfortably serve 50–75 people. See Figure 37.2. If more than 75 guests are expected, 
the buffet should be designed with at least two service lines. A good rule of thumb is to 
plan for one additional line for every 50 additional guests.
Several techniques make serving large groups more efficient. One option is to use a 
double-sided buffet line. On a double-sided buffet, the same foods are served from both 
sides of the table. All diners approach the table from the same direction and at the start of 
the buffet, the line is split, with half of the diners diverted to either side. Or a single-sided 
buffet can be divided into two or more zones, each of which offers the identical foods. 
Either option requires that the buffet provide the diners with appropriate visual cues to 
recognize that the two sides of the table or two ends of the table offer identical foods.
Another option for serving larger crowds is to divide the menu among various sta￾tions scattered throughout the venue. One station can be devoted to cold salads or to an 
elaborate display of cold fish and shellfish surrounding an ice sculpture. Another can be 
devoted to pasta prepared to order by a cook assigned to the station. Equipped with a 
portable induction burner, the chef can finish precooked pasta in the diner’s choice of 
sauce. Other stations can offer roasted meats and poultry kept warm by an infrared heat 
lamp and carved to order by another chef. Hotels and restaurants often assign culinary 
interns and new cooks to staff such buffet stations. The person assigned to the station 
should be able to not only handle a carving knife or cook eggs in public, but also be 
able to chat with guests while doing so.
The attractiveness of a well-designed buffet table depends principally on two factors: (1) 
the arrangement of the foods on their individual serving pieces and (2) the arrangement of 
the serving pieces and decorations on the buffet table.

The Buffet: An Ancient Extravaganza
the origin of the buffet is obscure, but it is 
possible that the idea evolved from Italian 
banquets of the early Renaissance. Gathering 
together to eat and drink on festive occasions 
was not new; one only has to think of 
banqueting scenes on ancient egyptian or 
Roman frescoes. But the word banchetto was 
new and referred not only to the event but to 
the long table or bench at which the many 
guests were seated.
As the influence of Italian art and manners 
spread throughout europe, the french adopted 
the banquet. Not only was it an occasion for 
eating and drinking prodigious amounts, but 
the resplendent display of food was often 
accompanied by an equally resplendent display 
of ornate gold and silver on dining room buffets 
or sideboards. And it was the chefs who were 
responsible for these imaginative displays. 
Paintings from the period of Louis XIV depict the 
unbridled creativity that went into these tableaux.
from france to england to America, the idea of 
the buffet migrated across time. there is rijsttafel in 
the Netherlands and smorgasbord in scandinavia. 
In America the Chinese restaurant buffet began 
around the time of the 1849 gold rush, perhaps the 
first instance of the “all you can eat” experience. 
the typical cost for these buffets was $1.00 per 
person. the “midnight chuck wagon” buffet at the 
el Rancho in 1940s Las Vegas popularized the “all 
you can eat” buffet; it cost $1.50.
Whatever the case, the buffet has come 
a long way from the 16th-century Medici 
banquet that featured a ram poached in water, 
reinserted into its skin (horns and all) and set 
lifelike into a gold basin.

Arranging Items on the Buffet Table
When designing the shape of the buffet table, the chef and/or banquet or dining room 
manager must first consider proper guest flow. The design should also consider how the 
various foods, centerpieces and props will be laid out on the table to incorporate color, 
height, shape and texture attractively. Later, as the buffet is built prior to the event, the 
staff might use the following guidelines:
	▪ Flow: Place foods in a logical order that affords guests the chance to construct a 
meal in a familiar order. This is important whether a single buffet table, a main 
buffet table with one or more stations or only stations are used. The start of the 
buffet line should be obvious and accessible; usually it is best located near the 
entrance to the room.
Typically on a single- or double-sided buffet table, the first items of￾fered are plates. (Flatware and napkins can be located at the start or the 
end of the buffet or on the dining tables.) The first foods to be offered 
should be soups and salads. Follow these with appetizers such as cold 
sliced meats, pâtés and shellfish. Entrées should be next, along with veg￾etable and starch accompaniments. Desserts should be the last items on 
the buffet. Beverages can be available on a buffet table, at a separate bar, 
on the dining tables or offered by circulating wait staff.
Multiple stations offer greater flexibility. They also help minimize the 
line that usually forms at a single buffet table and allow diners to go in 
various directions, although this can sometimes cause traffic problems. 
Like a single buffet table, each station can be designed so that it offers 
diners sufficient selections to create a complete meal. The stations can 
also be arranged around a room in a sequence: soups and salads on the 
first station diners would approach, appetizers on the next, and so on. 
A third option is to arrange the stations so that the one with the most 
spectacular display or the one featuring a chef making foods to order 
is the center of attention. Other stations are then situated around the 
room. Regardless of how they are arranged, each station should be self￾contained with service ware and accompaniments for the main items as 
shown in the nearby photo.
	▪ Spacing: Allow approximately 1 linear foot (0.3 linear meters) for each 
item on the buffet. In other words, if 16 items are to be placed on the table, 
including plates, a centerpiece and large props, then the buffet table should be 
approximately 16 feet (5 meters) long. If extremely large centerpieces are used 
or if food is presented on oversized platters, this will affect the total table space 
needed.
	▪ Reach: Try to place all foods within easy reach of the diners. Avoid stacking one 
item behind another. If items must be placed farther back on the table, set them 
on risers or on pedestals to add height to that platter. This extra height not only 
adds visual interest, it allows the diner to reach over the dish in front without 
disturbing its arrangement. Place foods that will not drip or splatter behind ones 
that will; that way, sauce from the back dish will not drip into the front dish on its 
way to the diner’s plate. Trays with foods that will not shift can be propped at a 
slight angle to make the contents more accessible and attractive.
	▪ Accompaniments: Place the appropriate condiments, sauces or other 
accompaniments near their principal foods. Also place a small plate or napkin 
near each chafing dish or platter for serving utensils.
	▪ Centerpieces: A table centerpiece brings focus to the buffet, and its height 
or dominance increases the visual appeal of the overall table design. 
The buffet centerpiece can be a floral arrangement or a sculpture made of 
ice, tallow, pastillage, chocolate, blown or pulled sugar or other material. The 
centerpiece can also be a grosse piece such as a whole roast turkey or whole 
poached salmon decorated with aspic.

covered with linens, paper or other decorative 
items, used on a buffet table as a base to 
elevate platters, trays or displays
M37_LABE1163_07_SE_C37.indd 1144 31/10/23 9:41 PMBuffets 1145
	▪ Decorations: In addition to the buffet centerpiece, other nonedible objects or 
props may grace the table. Anything from a wine barrel to a silver candelabra 
can be used, depending on the buffet’s theme. Whatever items are chosen, 
they should be clean and arranged artfully but not in a manner that interferes 
with a diner’s ability to see and reach the food. Props can also be used to mark 
divisions in the meal; for example, grouping all salads between one set of props 
divides salads from entrées. Sometimes unusable or dead space is inevitable 
due to the room or food layout. Try filling this empty space with props or other 
decorations.
	▪ Labels: Unlike a restaurant with a printed menu and an attentive wait staff, an 
unattended buffet may not give the diner an opportunity to ask questions about 
the food. This can be remedied by placing attractively printed cards with the 
name of the dish in front of each item. Labels are also a good way to guide 
guests to vegan, vegetarian, gluten-free or other specialty items.
PRESENTING AND MAINTAINING BUFFETS
The way in which foods are portioned and presented on a buffet can affect the quantity 
of food that guests consume. The goal for any hotel, restaurant or caterer is for guests to 
have enough to eat and drink, given the time and type of event. But it is equally impor￾tant to avoid leftovers or waste as this can negatively impact the profitability of the event. 
The size of each portion, the total quantity of food on display and the use of servers can 
help moderate the amount of food that guests consume and avoid waste.
Controlling Costs
Buffet menus can cost more per person than a plated restaurant meal because there is 
usually a larger variety of food available to guests at buffets. There is no magic formula 
to determine which foods or how much food each guest will eat during a buffet. There 
are, however, several ways to control costs when preparing food for buffets.
A common problem when planning a buffet is overproduction. Many novice chefs 
want to make enough of each menu item to serve the entire group. But this is unneces￾sary. Most people tend to sample a little from many dishes, so the more variety available, 
the smaller each portion will be. Experience will guide the chef to know which items 
are especially popular or guest favorites and need to be more plentiful. The total amount 
of food consumed depends on factors such as the general composition of the group 
(a luncheon buffet for finance executives may require less food than one for soccer 
players), the number of items offered, whether it will be convenient for people to return 
to the buffet for second helpings and whether diners serve themselves or are served by 
wait staff or chefs at the buffet.
Some chefs use a simple, although far from foolproof, formula of a total of 1 pound 
(450 grams) of food per person, then adjust from this amount. To determine how 
much food to prepare for a group, estimate how many ounces or grams of each menu 
item each guest will eat. Multiply this number by the total number of guests attend￾ing the event to determine the total weight of that item to prepare (e.g., for a group of 
100 people, 1 ounce [30 grams] of green salad per person = 100 ounces [3000 grams] or 
6.25 pounds [3 kilograms] of green salad). Perform this same calculation for each item on 
the menu excluding side sauces, condiments, bread and butter and other miscellaneous 
items. Add the weights together to determine the total weight of the food you plan to 
produce for the group.
Generally pre-cut portions should be small, especially if more than one item is served 
in a food category. For example, if grilled salmon fillet is served as a restaurant entrée, 
a typical serving might be 6 ounces (180 grams). If salmon fillet is served as one of three 
entrées at a dinner buffet for 100 people, portions can be smaller. The total of avail￾able fish should be 2–3 ounces (60–90 grams) per portion multiplied by 100 portions. 
Buffet Cost Control
to control costs when preparing foods for 
a buffet:
▪ Create menus that include a variety of 
interesting foods. Remember that the 
more items on a buffet, the more food 
that will have to be prepared to ensure 
that you do not run out of an item.
▪ Create menus that offset expensive 
foods with items that are less 
expensive.
▪ Arrange the buffet so that the more 
expensive foods are at the end of the 
buffet line.
▪ Reduce the size of individually 
portioned items, allowing guests to 
have a sample of two or more items 
without wasting food.
One luncheon buffet, which holds plates, 
glasses and everything needed for the foods 
served here
M37_LABE1163_07_SE_C37.indd 1145 31/10/23 9:41 PM1146 CHAPteR tHIRtY-seVeN
Similarly if a plated dessert tart at a restaurant has a 4-inch (10-centimeter) diameter, the 
version offered on a dessert buffet should have a 2-inch (5-centimeter) diameter. For 
additional information on quantities to prepare see Table 37.1.
Most diners tend to serve themselves larger portions of foods found at the start of the 
buffet than at its middle. So if boiled shrimp and raw oysters are being served, it may 
make economic sense to place them away from the start of the buffet. Less expensive 
items and those that occupy more space on the plate are often placed at the beginning 
of a buffet line. If guests fill their plate with salad greens, assorted toppings and bread 
near the beginning of a buffet line, they will have less room on the plate for more 
costly meats and entrées presented further down the line. Providing guests with smaller 
luncheon-size plates also may help reduce costs as well as food waste.
The additional food cost that is incurred when preparing food for a buffet is offset 
by several factors. Kitchen labor is lower when preparing food for buffets compared to 
preparing food for plated banquets or à la carte service. Buffet food is generally pre￾pared in advance by a small kitchen team and finished just before the buffet opens. This 
differs from plated meals where the cooks must assemble each plate to order and the 
entire kitchen team must stand ready as orders come in throughout the meal period. 
 Front-of-the-house labor is also lower when food is served buffet style. As a rule, one 
server is needed for every 20 guests during buffet service in contrast to plated banquet 
service, which requires one server for every 10 guests.
Keeping Hot Foods Hot
Keeping hot foods hot on a buffet is a particular challenge, and an important one, for 
both food safety and presentation concerns. If possible, hot foods should be served in 
relatively small quantities on warm platters that are exchanged frequently. This is not 
always possible, however. More often, hot foods are maintained in chafing dishes or 
under heat lamps.
To maintain the quality of foods kept in a chafing dish, use the following guidelines:
	▪ Choose foods that hold well. Rare meats and delicate pastas do not hold well 
in chafing dishes; they become overcooked and unattractive quickly. Instead 
try braised meats (which may actually benefit from the extended cooking) or 
hearty pastas such as tortellini or penne. This guideline also applies to garnishes: 
Delicate herbs such as basil do not do well in chafing dishes; instead try sprigs of 
rosemary or thyme.
	▪ Cook and offer small amounts of delicate foods and change the insert pan in a 
chafing dish often. This prevents foods from sitting too long.
 Safety Alert
Buffets
A properly maintained buffet is important 
for visual and culinary reasons. It is also 
important for food safety reasons. Because 
the public has direct access to food, cross￾contamination is a potential problem. In 
addition to keeping foods at the proper 
temperatures, the following rules are critical:
	▪ Do not add new food to old food in a 
serving dish or chafing dish.
	▪ Do not use a chafing dish to heat food; 
make sure food is at the proper internal 
temperature before transferring it to a 
chafing dish or putting it under a heat 
lamp.
	▪ Check food temperatures with 
instant-read thermometers at 
established time intervals to ensure 
that the food is being held at safe 
serving temperatures.
	▪ Be careful of steam when changing 
pans in a chafing dish; do not leave the 
pan of hot water uncovered, exposing 
staff and guests to potential injury.
	▪ Provide clean serving utensils for each 
dish and replace serving utensils often.
	▪ Provide an ample supply of clean 
plates, so that diners do not reuse 
plates from which they have eaten.

	▪ Ladle a small amount of sauce in the bottom of the pan before placing sliced 
meats in the pan, or serve sliced meats, poultry or fish on a bed of vegetables. 
The sauce or the vegetable bed helps to absorb the heat from the chafing dish, 
insulating the more delicate items and providing a bit of steam to help keep the 
foods moist.
	▪ Keep the chafing dish closed whenever possible. This holds in the steam, which 
helps keep the food moist. However a closed chafing dish can distract from a 
buffet’s appeal and slow down the flow of diners through the buffet line.
	▪ Heat lamps are generally used for keeping large cuts of meats or poultry warm 
during carving. These foods, however, become dry rapidly and should be 
replaced periodically.
	▪ Always follow time and temperature principles of food safety.
Keeping Cold Foods Cold
Keeping cold foods cold on a buffet table is a little less of a challenge than keeping hot 
food at the proper temperature. As with hot foods, it is best if cold foods are served in 
relatively small quantities on cold platters that are exchanged frequently. Alternatively 
the items can be set on a bed of ice—usually a large bowl filled with ice into which a 
smaller bowl containing the food is placed.
Cold beverages may be arranged for self-service in thermal insulated pitchers or 
dispensers with ice inserts. Clean, polished glassware should be placed near the cold 
beverage station with extra glasses available for those who want to try multiple flavors 
or return for more.
Replenishing Foods
Dishes should be removed from the buffet table when they are approximately two-thirds 
empty or have deteriorated in some fashion (e.g., when the aspic on pâtés has softened, 
cut fruits begin to brown or a hot food has crusted over). As the used dish is removed, its 
fresh replacement should be placed on the buffet immediately, and the new dish should 
be as carefully arranged and garnished as the original. If items from the used dish are to 
be combined with a replacement dish, this should be done in the kitchen and not at the 
buffet table. New and previously prepared batches of time and temperature controlled 
for safety foods should not be combined.
Serving the Guests
The responsibility for supervising an actual event usually falls to the event captain. The 
captain directs the crew of waiters and stewards assigned to set up the room, arrange 
tables and chairs, position flatware, china and glassware and set up chafing dishes or 
cooking stations as needed.
The captain also supervises the wait staff. One of the front waiters’ principal respon￾sibilities is to maintain the appearance of the buffet and to replenish items as needed. 
Depending on the function, service staff can be stationed behind the buffet table to serve 
diners, circulate in the crowd with trays of hors d’oeuvre or drinks (passing foods in this 
fashion is called butler service) or serve beverages to diners seated at the dining tables. 
Back waiters generally police (clean) the room and clear tables. Waiters should be particu￾larly vigilant in removing used plates from dining tables whenever a guest goes back to 
the buffet for more food. The used plate should be removed before the guest returns with 
a new plate.
Typically servers or chefs are placed at stations where foods are prepared or carved 
to order. This helps control portioning. It also provides a greater opportunity for staff to 
police the buffet and ensure that the table and the individual items remain neat, attrac￾tive and fresh. Finally placing wait staff or kitchen staff at the buffet allows diners to ask 
questions about the foods being served.
using two half-size hotel pans of different 
foods in a full-size chafing dish conserves space 
and allows smaller amounts of hot items to be 
displayed attractively.
A buffet display of chilled seafood is arranged 
on a bed of crushed ice.
for butler service, a waiter circulates among the 
guests with trays of individual hors d’oeuvre.
Plates and utensils are placed conveniently 
adjacent to chafing dishes of hot food on a 
round table.

 A Block of Ice, a Chain Saw, a Chisel and a Little Caution and Creativity 
 Ice carvings have long been popular buffet 
centerpieces; they add elegance and 
sophistication to the setting and occasion. As 
with other arts, it may take years to master 
ice carving. Nevertheless, with some practice 
and care, chefs can usually create acceptable 
ice sculptures after only a few tries. 
 Blocks of carving ice are specially prepared 
to remove air bubbles. these large blocks 
(20 × 10 × 46 inches [50 × 25 × 115 
centimeters]) weigh approximately 300 pounds 
(135 kilograms), and special ice tongs and 
caution are required when handling them. 
 At 0°f (–18°C), ice is very brittle and 
difficult to carve without breaking. therefore, 
the ice used must be tempered before carving. 
to temper the ice, remove it from the freezer 
and allow it to rest at room temperature for 
approximately 1 hour. When the surface is clear 
of frost, carving can begin. 
 A single carving can take from one to 
several hours to complete. Although chisels 
and specially designed saws for ice carving 
work quite well, chain saws are commonly used 
to speed up the process. Because most carving 
is done indoors, electric saws are used; unlike 
gas saws, they do not leave a greasy residue on 
the ice’s surface. Be very careful when using any 
chain saw, particularly an electric one, around 
melting ice and pools of water. 
 to begin, trace the outline of the figure you 
want to carve on the surface of all four sides of 
the block of ice. there are several excellent ice 
carving books, some of which provide stencils 
for this purpose. then start removing the ice 
using a large saw or a chainsaw. As the figure 
begins to take shape, use smaller chisels and 
specialized tools to create the desired effect. 
some carvers use chain saws for the entire 
process, however. After some practice, you will 
develop your own style and preferences. 
 When the carving is complete, carefully 
return the ice to the freezer until needed. When 
setting it on a buffet, use a pan designed to 
hold an ice carving and provide drainage. Avoid 
placing ice sculptures under hot air vents. 
At room temperature and average humidity, 
ice melts at the rate of approximately ½ inch 
(1.2 centimeters) per hour from all sides. Keep 
this in mind when carving thin pieces or small 
details into the surface.

 Appendix III 
 Typical Yield Percentages for Common Produce Items
A yield percentage figure is the amount of a food item available for use after that item is peeled, seeded, cleaned or similarly prepared. 
Yield percentage refers to the ratio of the usable quantity of an item to the purchased quantity and is always less than 100%. The 
 figures in this table are typical averages for commercially available produce. 
Apples 75% Grapefruit 45% Pears 75%
Apricots 94% Grapes 90% Pea pods 90%
Artichokes 48% Kiwi 80% Peppers 82%
Avocados 75% Leeks 50% Pineapple 50%
Bananas 70% Lemons 45% Plums 95%
Berries 95% Lettuce 75% Potatoes 80%
Broccoli 70% Limes 45% Radishes 90%
Cabbage 80% Melons 55% Rhubarb 85%
Carrots 78% Mushrooms 90% Scallions 65%
Cauliflower 55% Nectarines 86% Spinach 60%
Celery 75% Okra 82% Squash, sum 90%
Cherries 82% Onions 90% Squash, wnt 70%
Corn, from cob 28% Oranges 60% Tomatoes 90%
Cucumbers 95% Papayas 65% Turnips 75%
Eggplant 85% Parsley 85% Watercress 90%
Garlic 88% Peaches 75% Watermelon 45%
 To calculate any yield percentage, divide the edible portion (E.P.) by the as-purchased amount (A.P.). Note that E.P. and A.P. 
must be in the same measurement unit (gram, ounce, pound, etc.).
E.P. Weight = Yield Percentage
A.P. Weight
To determine yield percentage follow these steps:
 Step 1 Weigh the ingredient as purchased before cleaning, trimming and peeling.
Step 2 Peel, trim and clean the ingredient as required in the standardized recipe.
Step 3 Weigh the trimmed product to obtain the E.P.
Step 4 Divide the E.P. weight by the A.P. weight to obtain the yield percentage.
