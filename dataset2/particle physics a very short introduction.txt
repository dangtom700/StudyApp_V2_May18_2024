Glossary 141
Index 147Foreword
We are made of atoms. With each breath you inhale 10 billion 
trillion atoms of oxygen, which gives some idea of how small each 
one is. All of them, together with the carbon atoms in your skin, 
and indeed everything else on Earth, were cooked in a star some 
5 billion years ago. So you are made of stuff that is as old as the 
planet, one-third as old as the universe, though this is the first 
time that those atoms have been gathered together such that they 
think that they are you.
Particle physics is the subject that has shown how matter is built 
and which is beginning to explain where it all came from. It has 
revealed the existence of a ubiquitous essence, known as the 
‘Higgs field’, which gives mass to matter’s fundamental particles. 
In huge accelerators, several miles in length, we can speed pieces 
of atoms, particles such as electrons and protons, or even exotic 
pieces of antimatter, and smash them into one another. In so 
doing we are creating for a brief moment in a small region of 
space an intense concentration of energy, which replicates the 
nature of the universe as it was within a split second of the 
original Big Bang. Thus we are learning about our origins.
Discovering the nature of the atom 100 years ago was relatively 
simple: atoms are ubiquitous in matter all around, and teasing out 
their secrets could be done with apparatus on a table top. Investigating how matter emerged from Creation is another 
challenge entirely. There is no Big Bang apparatus for purchase in 
the scientific catalogues. The basic pieces that create the beams of 
particles, speed them to within an iota of the speed of light, smash 
them together, and then record the results for analysis all have to 
be made by teams of specialists. That we can do so is the 
culmination of a century of discovery and technological progress. 
It is a big and expensive endeavour, but it is the only way that we 
know to answer such profound questions. In the course of doing 
so, unexpected tools and inventions have been made. Antimatter 
and sophisticated particle detectors are now used in medical 
imaging; data acquisition systems designed at CERN (the 
European Council for Nuclear Research) led to the invention 
of the World Wide Web—these are but some of the spin-offs from 
high-energy particle physics.
The applications of the technology and discoveries made in 
high-energy physics are legion, but it is not with this technological 
aim that the subject is pursued. The drive is curiosity; the desire 
to know what we are made of, where it came from, and why the 
laws of the universe are so finely balanced that we have evolved.
In this Very Short Introduction I hope to give you a sense of what 
we have found and some of the major questions that are now 
confronting us. I am indebted to Latha Menon at Oxford 
University Press for encouraging me to produce this new edition, 
and to Alfons Weber for his advice on some aspects of 
experimental particle physics.

Chapter 1
Journey to the centre 
of the universe
Matter
On 4 July 2012, scientific epochs changed. That day at CERN, the 
particle physics laboratory in Geneva, discovery was announced of 
a new particle—the Higgs boson. This moment marked the ‘end of 
the beginning’ in the quest for matter’s fundamental pieces and 
the laws that govern their behaviour. That the Higgs boson is the 
only single particle to have been named for one person itself hints 
at its unique role. That day marked the end of the ‘pre-Higgs era’, 
which had extended over 2,000 years, since the time when the 
ancient Greeks believed that everything is made from a few basic 
elements.
In the heat of the Big Bang, Higgs bosons filled the infant 
universe. If conditions allow, bosons can mingle in large numbers 
(‘boson’ is the descriptive name given to the species of particles 
that have that tendency, unlike ‘fermions’ which work more 
discretely). That is what happened to those Higgs bosons when 
the universe aged and cooled: they coalesced, and today slumber 
in a quiescent, ubiquitous field. To resurrect Higgs bosons from 
that field, it is necessary to recreate the heat energy that was 
prevalent in the early universe. That is what particle physics 
experiments at CERN can do, for brief moments, in a small region 
of space.Particle Physics
2
Discovery of the Higgs boson confirms that we are immersed in 
that all-pervading field. Its nature is yet a mystery, but its 
implications are not. Its presence gives rise to structure rather 
than a homogeneous goo. The interaction of fundamental particles 
with this field gives them mass, enabling structures like atoms and 
molecules, the templates of life.
Most of this book introduces what we know about the 
fundamental particles of matter and their role in building the 
universe at large during the pre-Higgs era. As to why they have 
these specific properties and not others, we do not know. Finding 
out is a goal for the post-Higgs era, which we shall meet at the end 
of the book.
The ancient Greeks’ idea was basically correct; it was the details 
that were wrong. Their ‘earth, air, fire, and water’ are made of 
what today we know as the chemical elements. Pure water is made 
from two: hydrogen and oxygen. Air is largely made from nitrogen 
and oxygen with a dash of carbon and argon. The Earth’s crust 
contains most of the 90 naturally occurring elements, primarily 
oxygen, silicon, and iron, mixed with carbon, phosphorus, and 
many others that you may never have heard of, such as ruthenium, 
holmium, and rhodium.
The abundance of the elements varies widely, and as a rough rule 
the ones that you think of first are among the most common, 
while the ones that you have never heard of are the rarest. Thus 
oxygen is the winner: with each breath you inhale 10 billion 
trillion atoms of it; so do the other 8 billion humans on the planet, 
plus innumerable animals, and there are plenty more oxygen 
atoms around doing other things. As you exhale these atoms are 
emitted, entrapped with carbon to make molecules of carbon 
dioxide, the fuel for trees and plants. The numbers are vast, and 
the names of oxygen and carbon are in everyone’s lexicon. 
Contrast this with astatine or francium. Even if you have heard of 
them, you are unlikely to have come into contact with any, as it is Journey to the centre of the universe
3
estimated that there is less than an ounce of astatine in the Earth’s 
crust, and as for francium it has even been claimed that at any 
instant there are at most 20 atoms of it around.
An atom is the smallest piece of an element that can exist and still 
be recognized as that element. Nearly all of these elements, such 
as the oxygen that you breathe and the carbon in your skin, were 
made in stars about 5 billion years ago, at around the time that the 
Earth was first forming. Hydrogen and helium are even older, 
most hydrogen having been made soon after the Big Bang, later to 
provide the fuel of the stars within which the other elements 
would be created.
A hundred years ago atoms were thought to be small, 
impenetrable objects, like miniature versions of billiard balls 
perhaps. Today we know that each atom has a rich labyrinth of 
inner structure. At its centre is a dense, compact nucleus, which 
accounts for all but a trifle of the atom’s mass and carries positive 
electrical charge. In the outer regions of the atom there are tiny 
lightweight particles known as electrons. An electron has 
negative electric charge, and it is the mutual attraction of opposite 
charges that keeps these negatively charged electrons gyrating 
around the central positively charged nucleus.
The dot at the end of a sentence in printed text contains some 
100 billion atoms of carbon. To see one of these with the naked eye, 
you would need to magnify the dot to be 100 metres across. While 
huge, this is still imaginable. But to see the atomic nucleus you 
would need that dot to be enlarged to 10,000 kilometres: as big as 
the Earth from pole to pole.
Between the compact central nucleus and the remote whirling 
electrons, atoms are mostly empty space. That is what many books 
assert, and while that may be true for the particles that make up an 
atom, it is only half the story. That space is filled with electric 
and magnetic force fields, so powerful that they would stop you in Particle Physics
4
an instant if you tried to enter the atom. It is these forces that give 
solidity to matter, even while its atoms are supposedly ‘empty’. 
As you read this, you are suspended an atom’s breadth above the 
atoms in your chair due to these forces.
Powerful though these electric and magnetic forces are, they are 
trifling compared to yet stronger forces at work within the atomic 
nucleus. Disrupt the effects of these strong forces and you can 
release nuclear power; disrupt the electric and magnetic forces 
and you get the more ambient effects of chemistry and the 
biochemistry of life. These day-to-day familiar effects are due to 
the electrons in the outer reaches of atoms, far from the nucleus. 
Such electrons in neighbouring atoms may swap places, thereby 
helping to link the atoms together, making a molecule. It is the 
wanderings of these electrons that lead to chemistry, biology, and 
life. This book is not about those subjects, which deal with the 
collective behaviour of many atoms. By contrast, we want to 
journey into the atom and understand what is there.
Inside the atom
An electron appears to be truly fundamental; if it has any inner 
structure of its own, we have yet to discover it. The central 
nucleus, however, is built from further particles, known as 
protons and neutrons.
A proton is positively charged; the protons provide the total 
positive charge of the nucleus. The more protons there are in the 
nucleus, the greater is its charge, and, in turn, the more electrons 
can be held like satellites around it, to make an atom in which the 
positive and negative charges counterbalance, leaving the atom 
overall neutral. Thus it is that although intense electrical forces 
are at work deep within the atoms of our body, we are not much 
aware of them, nor are we ourselves electrically charged. The atom 
of the simplest element, hydrogen, normally consists of a single 
proton and a single electron. The number of protons in the Journey to the centre of the universe
5
nucleus is what differentiates one element from another. A cluster 
of 6 protons forms the nucleus of the carbon atom, iron has 26, 
and uranium 92.
Opposite charges attract, but like charges repel. So it is a wonder 
that protons, which are mutually repelling one another by this 
electrical force, manage to stay together in the confines of the 
nucleus. The reason is that when two protons touch, they can grip 
one another tightly by what is known as the strong force. This 
attractive force is much more powerful than the electrical 
repulsion, and so it is that the nuclei of our atoms do not 
spontaneously explode. However, you cannot put too many 
protons in close quarters; eventually the electrical disruption is 
too much. This is one reason why there is a heaviest naturally 
occurring element, uranium, with 92 protons in each nucleus. 
Pack more protons than this together and the nucleus cannot 
survive. Beyond uranium are highly radioactive elements such as 
plutonium, whose instability is infamous.
Atomic nuclei of all elements beyond hydrogen contain protons 
and also neutrons. The neutron is in effect an electrically neutral 
version of the proton. It has the same size and, to within a fraction 
of a percentage, the same mass as a proton. Neutrons grip one 
another with the same strength that protons do. Having no 
electrical charge, they feel no electrical disruption, unlike protons. 
As a result, neutrons add to the mass of a nucleus, and to the 
overall strong attractive force, and thereby help to stabilize the 
nucleus.
When neutrons are in this environment, such as when part of the 
nucleus of an iron atom, they may survive unchanged for billions 
of years. However, away from such a compact clustering, an 
isolated neutron is unstable. This is because a free neutron is a 
mere 1.4 parts in a thousand more massive than a proton, and by 
Einstein’s equivalence of mass and energy, E=mc2
, contains 
correspondingly more energy. Nature seeks to find stability by Particle Physics
6
minimizing this energy. It does so thanks to a feeble force, known 
as the weak force, one of whose effects is to destroy the neutron, 
converting it into a proton. This can even happen when too many 
neutrons are packed with protons in a nucleus. The effect of such 
a conversion here is to change the nucleus of one element into 
another. This transmutation of the elements is the seed of 
radioactivity and nuclear power.
Magnify a neutron or proton 1,000 times and you will discern that 
they too have a rich internal structure. Like a swarm of bees, 
which seen from afar appears as a dark spot whereas a close-up 
view shows the cloud buzzing with energy, so it is with the neutron 
or proton. On a low-powered image they appear like simple spots, 
but when viewed with a high-resolution microscope they are 
found to be clusters of smaller particles called quarks.
Let’s take up the analogy of the full stop once more. We had to 
enlarge it to 100 metres to see an atom with the naked eye; to the 
diameter of the planet to see the nucleus. To reveal the quarks we 
would need to expand the dot out to the Moon, and then keep on 
going another 20 times further. In summary, the underlying 
structure of the atom is beyond real imagination.
We have at last reached the fundamental particles of matter as we 
currently know them. The electrons and the quarks are like the 
letters of Nature’s alphabet, the basic pieces from which all can be 
constructed. If there is something more primary, like the dot and 
dash of Morse code, we do not know for certain what it is. There is 
speculation that if you could magnify an electron or a quark 
another billion billion times, you would discover the underlying 
Morse code to be like strings, which are vibrating in a universe 
that is revealed to have more dimensions than the three space and 
one time of which we are normally aware.
Whether this is the answer or not is for the future. I want to tell 
you something of how we came to know of the electron and the Journey to the centre of the universe
7
quarks, who they are, how they behave, and what questions 
confront us.
Forces
If the electrons and quarks are like the letters, then there are also 
analogues of the grammar: the rules that glue letters into words, 
sentences, and literature. For the universe, this glue is what we 
call the fundamental forces. There are four of them, of which 
gravity is the most familiar; gravity is the force that rules for bulk 
matter. Matter is held together by the electromagnetic force; it is 
this that holds electrons in atoms and links atoms to one another 
to make molecules and larger structures. Within and around the 
nucleus we find the other two forces: the strong and weak. The 
strong force glues the quarks into the small spheres that we call 
protons or neutrons; in turn these are held closely packed in the 
atomic nucleus. The weak force changes one variety of particle 
into another, such as in certain forms of radioactivity. It can 
change a proton into a neutron, or vice versa, leading to 
transmutation of the elements. In so doing it also liberates 
particles known as neutrinos. These are lightweight flighty 
neutral particles that respond only to the weak and gravitational 
forces. Millions of them are passing through you right now; 
they come from natural radioactivity in the rocks beneath your 
feet, but the majority have come from the Sun, having been 
produced in its central nuclear furnace, and even from the Big 
Bang itself.
For matter on Earth, and most of what we can see in the cosmos, 
this is the total cast of characters that you will need to meet. To 
make everything hereabouts requires the ingredients of electron 
and neutrino, and two varieties of quark, known as up and down, 
which seed the neutrons and protons of atomic nuclei. The four 
fundamental forces then act on these basic particles in selective 
ways, building up matter in bulk, and eventually you, me, the 
world about us, and most of the visible universe.Particle Physics

As a picture is said to be worth a thousand words, I summarize 
the story so far in the figures showing the inner structure of an 
atom and the forces of Nature.
How do we know this?
An important part of our story will be how we know these things. 
To sense the universe at all scales, from the vast extent of galaxies 
down to the unimaginably small distances within the atomic 
nucleus, requires that we expand our senses by using instruments. 
Telescopes enable us to look outwards and microscopes reveal 
what things are like at small distances. To look inside the atomic 
nucleus requires special types of microscope known as particle

1. Inside the atom. Atoms consist of electrons remotely encircling a 
massive central nucleus. A nucleus consists of protons and neutrons. 
Protons are positively charged; neutrons have no charge. Protons and 
neutrons in turn are made of yet smaller particles called quarks. 
To our best experiments, electrons and quarks appear to be basic 
particles with no deeper constituents.Journey to the centre of the universe

accelerators. By the use of electric fields, electrically charged 
particles such as electrons or protons are accelerated to within a 
fraction of the speed of light and then smashed into targets of 
matter or head on into one another. The results of such collisions 
can reveal the deep structure of matter. They not only show the 
quarks that seed the atomic nucleus, but have also revealed exotic 
forms of matter with whimsical names—strange, charm, bottom, 
and top—and seemingly heavier forms of the electron, known as 
the muon and tau. These play no obvious role in the matter that 
we normally find on Earth, and it is not completely understood 
why Nature uses them. Answering such questions is one of the 
challenges currently facing us.
Although these exotic forms are not prevalent today, it appears 
that they were abundant in the first moments after the Big Bang 
which heralded the start of our material universe. This insight has 
also come from the results of high-energy particle experiments, 
and a profound realization of what these experiments are doing. 
For 50 years the focus of high-energy particle physics was to 
reveal the deep inner structure of matter and to understand the 
exotic forms of matter that had unexpectedly shown up. In the last 
quarter of the 20th century a profound view of the universe 
emerged: that the material universe of today has emerged from a 
hot Big Bang, and that the collisions between subatomic particles 
are capable of recreating momentarily the conditions that were 
prevalent at that early epoch.
Thus today we view the collisions between high-energy particles 
as a means of studying the phenomena that ruled when the 
universe was newly born. We can study how matter was created 
and discover what varieties there were. From this we can construct 
the story of how the material universe has developed from that 
original hot cauldron to the cool conditions here on Earth today, 
where matter is made from electrons, without need for muons and 
taus, and where the seeds of atomic nuclei are just the up and 
down quarks, without need for strange or charming stuff.Particle Physics

2. The forces of Nature. Gravity is attractive and controls the 
large-scale motions of galaxies, planets, and falling apples. Electric 
and magnetic forces hold electrons in the outer reaches of atoms. They 
can be attractive or repulsive, and tend to counterbalance in bulk Journey to the centre of the universe
11
In very broad terms, this is the story of what has happened. The 
matter that was born in the hot Big Bang consisted of quarks and 
particles like the electron. The universe was filled with a 
ubiquitous essence, known as the ‘Higgs field’, but for which the 
vacuum of space would have been unstable. Interactions between 
the fundamental particles and the Higgs field gave particles mass. 
Why these masses have their specific values, we do not yet know. 
As concerns the quarks, the strange, charm, bottom, and top 
varieties are highly unstable, and they died out within a fraction of 
a second, the weak force converting them into their more stable 
progeny, the up and down varieties which survive within us today. 
A similar story took place for the electron and its heavier versions, 
the muon and tau. This latter pair are also unstable and died out, 
courtesy of the weak force, leaving the electron as survivor. In the 
process of these decays, lots of neutrinos and electromagnetic 
radiation were also produced, which continue to swarm 
throughout the universe some 14 billion years later.
The up and down quarks and the electrons were the survivors 
while the universe was still very young and hot. As it cooled, the 
quarks were stuck to one another, forming protons and neutrons. 
The mutual gravitational attraction among these particles 
gathered them into large clouds that were primaeval stars. As they 
bumped into one another in the heart of these stars, the protons 
and neutrons built up the seeds of heavier elements. Some stars 
became unstable and exploded, ejecting these atomic nuclei into 
space, where they trapped electrons to form atoms of matter as we 
know it. That is what we believe occurred some 5 billion years ago 
matter, leaving gravity dominant at large distances. The strong force 
glues quarks to one another, forming neutrons, protons, and other 
particles. Its powerful attraction between protons and neutrons when 
they touch helps create the compact nucleus at the heart of atoms. The 
weak force can change one form of particle into another. This can 
cause transmutation of the elements, such as turning hydrogen into 
helium in the Sun.Particle Physics
12
when our solar system was forming; those atoms from a long-dead 
supernova are what make you and me today.
What we can now do in experiments is in effect reverse the 
process and observe matter change back into its original 
primaeval forms. Heat matter to a few thousand degrees and its 
atoms ionize—electrons are separated from the central nuclei. 
That is how it is inside the Sun. The Sun is a plasma, that is, gases 
of electrically charged electrons and protons swirling 
independently. At even higher temperatures, typical of the 
conditions that can be reached in relatively small high-energy 
accelerators, the nuclei are disrupted into their constituent 
protons and neutrons. At yet higher energies, these in turn ‘melt’ 
into a plasma of freely flowing quarks. At the extreme energies 
accessible by CERN’s Large Hadron Collider, it has proved 
possible to excite the Higgs field, forming Higgs bosons. Thus we 
know we are immersed in this ubiquitous field, which gives 
fundamental particles their mass.
How this all happened, how we know, and what we’ve discovered 
are the themes of this Very Short Introduction.13
Chapter 2
How big and small 
are big and small?
From quarks to quasars
The universe isn’t the same everywhere—the Sun and stars are 
much hotter than the Earth and matter takes on different forms, 
but it is ultimately made of the same stuff. Atoms are very small; 
the cosmos is very big. How do they compare with 
everyday things?
Individual stars are huge, and visible to the naked eye over vast 
distances. This is in stark contrast to their basic components, the 
particles that eventually make up atoms. It would take about a 
billion atoms placed on top of one another to reach your head; it 
would take a similar number of people head to toe to give the 
diameter of the Sun. So this places the human measuring scale 
roughly in the middle between those of the Sun and an atom. The 
particles that make up atoms—the electrons that form the outer 
regions, and the quarks, which are the ultimate seeds of the 
central nucleus—are themselves a further factor of about a billion 
smaller than the atomic whole.
A fully grown human is a bit less than 2 metres tall. For much of 
what we will meet in this book, orders of magnitude are more 
important than precise values. So to set the scale I will take 
humans to be about 1 metre in ‘order of magnitude’ (this means Particle Physics
14
we are much bigger than 1/10 metre, or 10–1 m, and 
correspondingly smaller than 10 m). Then, going to the large 
scales of astronomy, we have the radius of the Earth, some 107
 m 
(that is, 1 followed by seven zeroes); that of the Sun is 109
 m; our 
orbit around the Sun is 1011 m (or in more readable units, 100 
million km). For later reference, note that the relative sizes of the 
Earth, Sun, and our orbit are factors of about 100.
Distances greater than this become increasingly hard to visualize, 
with large numbers of zeroes when expressed in metres, so a new 
unit is used: the light year. Light travels at 300,000 kilometres 
per second. This is fast but not infinite: it takes light a 
nanosecond, that is 10–9 s, to travel 30 cm, which is about the size 
of your foot. Modern computers operate on such timescales, and 
such microtimes will become central when we enter the world 
within the atom. For the moment, we are heading to the other 
extreme—the very large distances of the cosmos, and the long 
times that it takes for light to travel from remote galaxies to our 
eyes here.
It takes light 8 minutes to travel the 150 million km from the Sun; 
so we say the Sun is 8 light minutes away. It takes a year for light to 
travel 1016 m, and so this distance is referred to as a light year. Our 
Milky Way galaxy extends for 1021 m, or some 100,000 light years. 
Galaxies cluster together in groups, extending over 10 million light 
years. These clusters are themselves grouped into superclusters, 
about 100 million light years in extent (or 1024 m). The extent of 
the visible universe is some 10 billion light years, or 1026 m. These 
actual numbers are not too important, but notice how the universe 
is not homogeneous, and instead is clustered into distinct 
structures: superclusters, clusters of galaxies, and individual 
galaxies such as our own, with each being roughly 1/100 smaller 
than its predecessor. When we enter the microworld, we will once 
again experience such layers of structure, but on a much emptier 
scale; not 1/100, but more like 1/10,000.How big and small are big and small?
15
Having made a voyage out into the large scales of space, let’s now 
take the opposite direction into the microworld of atoms, and 
their internal structure. With our unaided naked eye, we can 
resolve individual pieces of dust, say, that are as small as a tenth to 
a hundredth of a millimetre: 10–4 to 10–5 m. This is at the upper 
end of the size of bacteria. Light is a form of electromagnetic 
wave, and the wavelength of visible light that we see as the 
rainbow spans 10–6 to 10–7 m. Atoms are a thousand times smaller 
than this: some 10–10 m. It is the fact that atoms are so much 
smaller than the wavelength of visible light that puts them beyond 
the reach of our normal vision.
Everything on Earth is made from atoms. Every element has its 
smallest piece, far too small to see by eye but real nonetheless, as 
special instruments can show.
To recap from Chapter 1: atoms are made of smaller particles. 
Electrons whirl in their remote reaches: at their heart is the 
compact massive atomic nucleus. The nucleus has a structure of 
its own, consisting of protons and neutrons, which in turn are 
made of yet smaller particles: the ‘quarks’. Quarks and electrons 
are the seeds of matter as we find it on Earth.
Whereas the atom is typically 10–10 m across, its central nucleus 
measures only about 10–14 to 10–15 m. So beware the oft-quoted 
analogy that atoms are like miniature solar systems, with the 
‘planetary electrons’ encircling the ‘nuclear sun’. The real solar 
system has a factor 1/100 between our orbit and the size of the 
central Sun; the atom is far emptier, with 1/10,000 as the 
corresponding ratio between the extent of its central nucleus and 
the radius of the atom. And this emptiness continues. Individual 
protons and neutrons are about 10–15 m in diameter and are in 
turn made of yet smaller particles known as quarks. If quarks and 
electrons have any intrinsic size, it is too small for us to measure. 
All that we can say for sure is that it is no bigger than 10–18 m. Particle Physics

10–9 metres is 1 nanometre, and 10–15 metres is 1 fermi.How big and small are big and small?
17
So here again we see that the relative size of quark to proton is 
some 1/10,000 (at most!). The same is true for the ‘planetary’ 
electron relative to the proton ‘sun’: 1/10,000 rather than the 
‘mere’ 1/100 of the real solar system. So the world within the 
atom is incredibly empty.
To gain some sort of feel for this, imagine the longest hole that 
you are likely to find on a golf course, say 500 m. The relative 
length of this fairway to the size of the tiny hole into which you 
will eventually pot the ball is some 10,000:1 and hence similar to 
that of the radius of the hydrogen atom to its central nucleus, 
the proton.
Just as large distances become unwieldy when expressed in 
metres, so do the submicroscopic dimensions of atomic and 
nuclear structures. In the former case we introduced the light 
year, 1016 m; in the latter it is customary to use the angstrom, A, 
where 1 angstrom = 10–10 m (typically the size of a simple atom), 
and the fermi, fm, where 1 fm m–15 = 10 . Thus angstroms are useful 
units to measure the sizes of atoms and molecules, while fermis 
are natural for nuclei and particles. (Ångström and Fermi 
were famous atomic and nuclear scientists of the 19th and 
20th centuries, respectively.)
Our eyes see things on a human scale; our ancestors developed 
senses that would protect them from predators and had no need 
for eyes that could see galaxies that emit radio waves, or the atoms 
of our DNA. Today we can use instruments to extend our senses: 
telescopes that study the depths of space and microscopes to 
reveal bacteria and molecules. We have special ‘microscopes’ to 
reveal distances smaller than atoms: this is the role of high-energy 
particle accelerators. By such tools we can reveal Nature over a 
vast range of distance scales. How this is done for particles will be 
the theme of Chapters 5 and 6.Particle Physics
18
The universe in temperature and time
That is how things are now, but it hasn’t always been that way. 
The universe, as we know it, began in a hot Big Bang where atoms 
could not survive. Today, about 14 billion years later, the universe 
at large is very cold, and atoms can survive. There are local hot 
spots, such as stars like our Sun, and matter there differs from that 
found here on our relatively cool Earth. We can even simulate the 
extreme conditions of the moments immediately following the Big 
Bang, in experiments performed at particle accelerators, and see 
how the basic seeds of matter originally must have emerged. 
However, although the forms that matter takes vary through space 
and time, the basic pieces are common. How matter appears 
in the cold (now), in the hot (such as in the Sun and stars), and in 
the ultra-hot (like the aftermath of the original Big Bang), is the 
theme of this section.
In macroscopic physics we keep our energy accounts in joules, or, 
in large-scale industries, mega- or terajoules. In atomic, nuclear, 
and particle physics, the energies involved are trifling in 
comparison. If an electron, which is electrically charged, is 
accelerated by the electric field of a 1-volt battery, it will gain an 
energy of ´ –19 1.6 10 J. Even when rushing at near to the speed of 
light, as in accelerators at CERN in Geneva, the energy still only 
reaches the order of 10–8 J, one hundredth of a millionth of a joule. 
Such small numbers get messy, and so it is traditional to use a 
different measure, known as the ‘electronvolt’, or eV. We said 
above that when accelerated by the electric field of a 1-volt battery 
an electron will gain an energy of ´ –19 1.6 10 J, and it is this that 
we define as 1 electronvolt.
Now the energies involved in subatomic physics become 
manageable. We call 103
 eV a kilo-eV or keV; a million (mega), 
106
 eV, is 1 MeV; a billion (giga), 109
 eV, is 1 GeV; and the latest 
experiments are entering the ‘tera’ or 1012 eV, 1 TeV, region.How big and small are big and small?
19
Einstein’s famous equation E mc2 = tells us that energy can be 
exchanged for mass, and vice versa, the ‘exchange rate’ being c2
, 
the square of the velocity of light. The electron has a mass 
of ´ –31 9 10 kg. Once again such numbers are messy, and so we 
use E mc2 = to quantify mass and energy which gives about 
0.5 MeV for the energy of a single electron at rest; we traditionally 
state its mass as 0.5 MeV/c2
. The mass of a proton in these units is 
938 MeV/c2
, which is nearly 1 GeV/c2
.
Energy is profoundly linked to temperature also. If you have a vast 
number of particles bumping into one another, transferring 
energy from one to the next so that the whole is at some fixed 
temperature, the average energy of the individual particles can 
be expressed in eV (or keV and so on). Room temperature 
corresponds to about 1/40 eV, or 0.025 eV. Perhaps easier will be 
to use the measure of 1 eVÛ104K (where K refers to Kelvin, the 
absolute measure of temperature; absolute zero 0K =–273 Celsius, 
and room temperature is about 300 K).
Fire a rocket upwards with enough energy and it can escape the 
gravitational pull of the Earth; give an electron in an atom enough 
energy and it can escape the electrical pull of the atomic nucleus. 
In many molecules, the electrons will be liberated by an energy of 
fractions of an eV; so room temperature can be sufficient to do 
this, which is the source of chemistry, biology, and life. Atoms of 
hydrogen will survive at energies below 1 eV, which in temperature 
terms is of the order of 104
 K. Such temperatures do not occur 
normally on Earth (other than specific examples such as some 
industrial furnaces, carbon arc lights, and scientific apparatus), 
and so atoms are the norm here. However, in the centre of the Sun 
the temperature is some 107
 K, or in energy terms 1 keV; atoms 
cannot survive such conditions.
At temperatures above 1010 K there is enough energy available that 
it can be converted into particles, such as electrons. An individual Particle Physics
20
electron has a mass of 0.5 MeV/c2
, and so it requires 0.5 MeV of 
energy to ‘congeal’ into an electron. As we shall see later, this 
cannot happen spontaneously; an electron and its antimatter 
counterpart—the positron—must be created as a pair. So 1 MeV 
energy is needed for ‘electron positron creation’ to occur. 
Analogously, 2 GeV energy is needed to create a proton and its 
antiproton. Such energies are easy to generate in nuclear 
laboratories and particle accelerators today; they were the norm 
in the very early universe, and it was in those first moments that 
the basic particles of matter (and antimatter) were formed. 
The details of this will be given in Chapter 9, but some outline 
will be useful for orientation now.
The galaxies are observed to be rushing apart from one another 
such that the universe is expanding. From the rate of the 
expansion we can play the scenario back in time and deduce that 
about 14 billion years ago the universe would have been 
compacted in on itself. It is the explosive eruption from that dense 
state that we call the Big Bang. (It is not the primary purpose of 
this book to review the Big Bang; to learn more read Peter Coles’ 
Cosmology in the Very Short Introduction series). In that original 
state, the universe would have been much hotter than it is now. 
The universe today is bathed in microwave radiation with a 
temperature of about 3 K. Combining this with the picture of the 
post-Big Bang expansion gives a measure of temperature of the 
universe as a function of time.
Within a billionth of a second of the original Big Bang, the 
temperature of the universe would have exceeded 1016 K, or in 
energy terms 1 TeV. The Higgs field filled and stabilized the 
vacuum. Some theorists ponder whether it helped drive the 
universe’s initial inflationary expansion, but there is as yet no 
empirical proof of that. What we do know is that at such energies 
fundamental particles and antiparticles were created, including 
exotic forms no longer common today, and they gained mass 
through their interaction with the Higgs field. Most of these exotic How big and small are big and small?

varieties died out almost immediately, producing radiation and 
more of the basic particles such as electrons and the surviving 
quarks that make up matter today.
As the universe aged, it cooled, at first very quickly. Within a 
millionth of a second quarks clustered together in threes, where 
they have remained ever since. So protons and neutrons were born. 
After about three minutes the temperature had fallen to about 
1010 K, or in energy 1 MeV. This is ‘cool’ enough for protons and 
neutrons to stick together and build up the nuclear seeds of the 
(yet to be completed) atomic elements. A few light nuclei were 
formed, such as helium and traces of beryllium and boron. 
Protons, being stable and the simplest, were most common and 
clustered under gravity into spherical balls that we call stars. It was 
here that the nuclei of heavy elements would be cooked over the 
next billions of years. In Chapter 9 I shall describe how the protons 
in these stars bumped into one another, clustering together, and by 
a series of processes made the nuclear seeds of heavier elements: 
first helium, and eventually the heavier ones such as oxygen, 
carbon, and iron. When such stars explode and die, they spew 
these nuclear seeds out into the cosmos, which is where the carbon 
in your skin and the oxygen in our air originated.
The Sun is going through the first part of this story now. It has 
been converting protons into the nuclei of helium for 5 billion 
years and has used up about half of its fuel so far. The temperatures 
involved in its heart that do this are similar to those of the whole 
universe when it was a few minutes old. So the Sun is carrying on 
today what the universe did at large long ago.
Atoms cannot survive inside the depths of the Sun, and nor could 
they in the early universe. It was not until some 300,000 years 
had elapsed that the universe had cooled enough for these nuclei 
to entrap passing electrons and make atoms. That is how things 
are here on Earth today.23
Chapter 3
How we learn what 
things are made of, and 
what we found
Energy and waves
Instruments such as microscopes and particle accelerators enable 
us to extend our vision beyond the rainbow of visible light and see 
into the subatomic microworld. This has revealed the inner 
structure of the atom—electrons, nuclear particles, and quarks.
To find out what something is made of you might (a) look at it; 
(b) heat it and see what happens; or (c) smash it by brute force.
There is a common misconception that it is the latter that
high-energy, or ‘particle’, physicists do. This is a term left over from 
the days when particle accelerators were known as ‘atom smashers’. 
And indeed, historically that was what took place, but today the aims 
and methods are more sophisticated. We will come to the details
later, but to start, let’s focus on the three options just mentioned.
Each of them shares a common feature: they all use energy.
In the case of heating, we have already seen how temperature and 
energy are correlated (104
 K ~ 1 eV). Even in looking at things, 
energy will turn out to play a role.
You are seeing these words because light is shining on the page 
and then being transmitted to your eyes; the general idea here is 
that there is a source of radiation (the light), an object under Particle Physics
24
investigation (the page), and a detector (your eye). Inside a full 
stop are millions of carbon atoms, and you will never be able to 
see the individual atoms, even with the most powerful magnifying 
glass. They are smaller than the wavelength of ‘visible’ light and so 
cannot be resolved in an ordinary magnifying glass or microscope.
Light is a form of electromagnetic radiation. Our eyes respond 
only to a very small part of the whole electromagnetic spectrum; 
but the whole of it can be accessed by special instruments. Visible 
light is the strongest radiation given out by the Sun, and humans 
have evolved eyes that register only this particular range. The 
whole spread of the electromagnetic spectrum is there, as we can 
illustrate by an analogy with sound. A single octave of sound 
involves a halving of the wavelength (or a doubling of the 
frequency) from one note (say the A at 440 Hz) to that of an 
octave above (the A at 880 Hz). Similarly for the rainbow: it is an 
‘octave’ in the electromagnetic spectrum. As you go from red light 
to blue, the wavelength halves, the wavelength of blue light being 
half that of red (or equivalently, the frequency with which the 
electric and magnetic fields oscillate back and forth is twice as fast 
for blue light as red). The electromagnetic spectrum extends 
further in both directions. Beyond the blue horizon—where we 
find ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays—the wavelengths are 
smaller than in the visible rainbow; by contrast, at longer 
wavelengths and in the opposite direction, beyond the red, we 
have infrared, microwaves, and radio waves.
We can sense the electromagnetic spectrum beyond the rainbow; 
our eyes cannot see infrared radiation, but the surface of our skin 
can feel it as heat. Modern infrared cameras can ‘see’ prowlers by 
the heat they give off. It is human genius that has made machines 
that can extend our vision across the entire electromagnetic 
range, thereby revealing deep truths about the nature of the atom.
Our inability to see atoms has to do with the fact that light 
acts like a wave and waves do not scatter easily from small objects. How we learn what things are made of, and what we found
25
To see a thing, the wavelength of the beam must be smaller than 
that thing is. Therefore, to see molecules or atoms needs 
illuminations whose wavelengths are similar to or smaller than 
them. Light waves, like those our eyes are sensitive to, have a 
wavelength of about 10–7 m (or put another way, 10,000 
wavelengths would fit into a millimetre). This is still 1000 times 
bigger than the size of an atom. To gain a feeling for how big a 
task this is, imagine the world scaled up 10 million times. A single 
wavelength of light, magnified 10 million times, would be bigger 
than a human, whereas an atom on this scale would extend only 
1 millimetre, far too little to disturb the long blue wave. To have 
any chance of seeing molecules and atoms we need light with 
wavelengths much shorter than these. We have to go far beyond 
the blue horizon to wavelengths in the X-ray region and beyond.
X-rays are light with such short wavelengths that they can be 
scattered by regular structures on the molecular scale, such as are 
found in crystals. The wavelength of X-rays is larger than the size 
of individual atoms, so the atoms are still invisible. However, the 
distance between adjacent planes in the regular matrix within 
crystals is similar to the X-ray wavelength, and so X-rays begin to 
discern the relative position of things within crystals. This is 
known as ‘X-ray crystallography’.
An analogy can be made if one thinks for a moment of water waves 
rather than electromagnetic ones. Drop a stone into still water and 
ripples spread out. If you were shown an image of these circular 
patterns, you could deduce where the stone had been. A collection 
of synchronized stones dropped in would create a more 
complicated pattern of waves, with peaks and troughs as they meet 
and interfere. From the resulting pattern you could deduce, with 
some difficulty admittedly, where the stones had entered. X-ray 
crystallography involves detecting multiple scattered waves from 
the regular layers in the crystal and then decoding the pattern to 
deduce the crystalline structure. In this way, the shape and form of 
very complicated molecules, such as DNA, have been deduced.Particle Physics
26
To resolve the individual atoms we need even shorter wavelengths, 
and we can do this by using not just light, but also beams of 
particles such as electrons. These have special advantages in that 
they have electric charge and so can be manipulated, accelerated 
by electric fields, and thereby given large amounts of energy. This 
enables us to probe ever shorter distances, but to understand why 
we need to make a brief diversion to see how energy and 
wavelength are related.
One of the great discoveries in the quantum theory was that 
particles can have wavelike character, and conversely that waves 
can act like staccato bundles of particles, known as ‘quanta’. 
Thus an electromagnetic wave acts like a burst of quanta—photons. 
The energy of any individual photon is proportional to the 
frequency (ν) of the oscillating electric and magnetic fields of the 
wave. This is expressed in the form
E=hν
where the constant of proportion, h, is Planck’s constant.
The length of a wave (λ), and the frequency with which peaks pass 
a given point, are related to its speed, c, by ν λ = c / . So we can 
relate energy and wavelength
hc
λ
E =
and the proportionality constant –6 hc ~ 10 eV m. This enables us 
to relate energy and wavelength by the approximate rule of thumb: 
‘1 eV corresponds to 10–6 m’, and so on.
You can compare with the relation between energy and 
temperature in Chapter 2, and see how temperature and 
wavelength are related. This illustrates how bodies at different 
temperatures will tend to radiate at different wavelengths: the How we learn what things are made of, and what we found
27
hotter the body, the shorter the wavelength. Thus, for example, as 
a current flows through a wire filament and warms it, it will at 
first emit heat in the form of infrared radiation—and as it gets 
hotter, 1,000 degrees or so, it will begin to emit visible light and 
illuminate the room. Hot gases in the vicinity of the Sun can emit 
X-rays; some extremely hot stars emit gamma rays.
To probe deep within atoms we need a source of very short 
wavelength. As we cannot make gamma-emitting stars in the 
laboratory, the technique is to use the basic particles themselves, 
such as electrons and protons, and speed them in electric fields. 
The higher their speed, the greater their energy and momentum 
and the shorter their associated wavelength. So beams of 
high-energy particles can resolve things as small as atoms. We can 
look at as small a distance as we like; all we have to do is to speed 
the particles up, give them more and more energy to get to ever 
smaller wavelengths. To resolve distances on the scale of the 
atomic nucleus, 10–15 m, requires energies of the order of GeV. 
This is the energy scale of what we call high-energy physics. 
Indeed, when that field began in earnest in the early to middle of 
the 20th century, GeV energies were at the boundaries of what 
was technically available. By the end of the 20th century, energies 
of several hundred GeV were the norm, and we are now entering 
the realm of TeV scale energies, probing matter at distances 
smaller than 10–18 m. So when we say that electrons and quarks

have no deeper structure, we can only really say ‘at least on scales 
of 10–18 m’. It is possible that there are deeper layers, on distances 
smaller than these, but which are beyond our present ability to 
resolve in experiment. So although I shall throughout this book 
speak as if these entities are the ultimate pieces, always bear in 
mind that caveat: we only know how Nature operates at distances 
larger than about 10–18 m.
Accelerating particles
The idea of accelerators will be described in Chapter 5, but 
for the moment let’s reflect a moment on what is required. 
To accelerate particles to high energy requires lots of space. 
Technology in the mid- to late -20th century could accelerate 
electrons, say, at a rate corresponding to each electron in the beam 
gaining some tens of MeV energy per metre travelled. Hence the 
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center in California (SLAC) 
contained a 3-km-long accelerator which produced beams of 
electrons at up to 50 GeV, while in the 1990s at CERN in Geneva, 
electrons were guided around a circle of 27 km in length, 
achieving energies of some 100 GeV. Protons, being more massive, 
pack a bigger punch, but still require large accelerators to achieve 
their goals. Today, that 27-km tunnel at CERN houses the Large 
Hadron Collider, which accelerates protons and heavy nuclei to 
above 1 TeV—1,000 GeV. Ultimately it is the quantum relation 
between short distances, the consequent short wavelengths 
needed to probe them, and the high energies of the beams that 
creates this apparent paradox of needing ever bigger machines to 
probe the most minute distances.
These were the early aims of those experiments to probe the heart 
of the atomic nucleus by hitting it with beams of high-energy 
particles. The energy of the particles in the beam is vast (on the 
scale of the energy contained within a single nucleus, holding the 
nucleus together), and as a result the beam tends to smash the 
atom and its particles apart into pieces, spawning new particles in How we learn what things are made of, and what we found
29
the process. This is the reason for the old-fashioned name of ‘atom 
smashers’. Today we do much more than this, and the name is 
defunct.
The electron and proton
The electrically charged particles that build up atoms are the 
electron and proton. An atom of the simplest element, hydrogen, 
consists normally of a single electron (negatively charged) and a 
proton with the same amount of charge, but positive. Thus, 
although an atom can be electrically neutral overall (as is the case 
with most bulk matter that we are familiar with), it contains 
negative and positive charges within. It is these charges, and the 
consequent electric and magnetic forces that they feel, which bind 
atoms into molecules and bulk matter. We will deal with the forces 
of Nature in Chapter 7. Here we will focus on these basic 
electrically charged particles and how they have been used as tools 
to probe atomic and nuclear structure.
Electron beams were being used in the 19th century, though no 
one then knew what they were. When electric currents were 
passed through gases at extremely low pressures, a pencil-thin 
beam would be seen. Such beams became known as ‘cathode rays’ 
and, we now know, consist of electrons. The most familiar 
example of this apparatus is a classic television, where the 
cathode is the hot filament at the rear from which the beams of 
electrons emerge and hit the screen.
It was a big surprise in the 19th century when it was discovered 
that the rays would pass through solid matter almost as if 
nothing was in their way. This was a paradox: matter that is 
solid to the touch is transparent on the atomic scale. Phillipp 
Lenard, who discovered this, remarked that ‘the space occupied 
by a cubic metre of solid platinum is as empty as the space of 
stars beyond the earth’. Atoms may be mostly empty space, but 
something defines them, giving mass to things. That there is Particle Physics
30
more than simply space became clear with the work of Ernest 
Rutherford in the early years of the 20th century. This came 
about after the discoveries of the electron and of radioactivity, 
which provided the essential tools with which atomic structure 
could be exposed.
The electron was discovered and identified as a fundamental 
constituent of the atomic elements by J. J. Thomson in 1897. 
Negatively charged, electrons have been inside atoms as long as 
the Earth has been here. They are easy to extract, temperatures of 
a few thousand degrees will do. Electric fields will accelerate them, 
giving them energy and thereby enabling beams of high-energy 
electrons to probe small-scale structures.
There are other atomic bullets. The proton has positive electric 
charge, in magnitude the same as the electron’s negative, but in 
mass the proton wins out immensely, being nearly 2,000 times as 
massive. Protons have become a choice beam for subatomic 
investigations, but initially it was another electrically charged 
entity that proved seminal. This was the alpha particle.
Today we know that this is the nucleus of a helium atom: a 
compact cluster of two protons and two neutrons, and as such, 
positively charged and some four times as massive as a single 
atom of hydrogen. The reason that this came to prominence is 
that the nuclei of many heavy elements are radioactive, 
spontaneously emitting alpha particles and thereby providing 
freely a source of electrically charged probes. Heavy nuclei consist 
of large numbers of protons and neutrons tightly packed, and the 
phenomenon of alpha radioactivity occurs as a heavy nucleus 
gains stability by spontaneously ejecting a tight bunch of two 
protons and two neutrons. The details of this need not concern us 
here, suffice to accept that it occurs, that the ‘alpha’ particle 
emerges with kinetic energy and can smash into the atoms of 
surrounding material. It was by such means that Ernest 
Rutherford and his assistants Geiger and Marsden first discovered How we learn what things are made of, and what we found
31
the existence of the atomic nucleus. (For more about nuclear 
physics, see Nuclear Physics, A Very Short Introduction.)
When alpha particles encountered atoms, the alphas were 
sometimes scattered violently, even on occasion being turned back 
in their tracks. This is what happens if the positive charge of a 
heavy element, such as gold, is concentrated in a compact central 
mass. The positively charged alphas were being repelled by the 
positively charged atomic nucleus; and as a light object, such as a 
tennis ball, can recoil from a heavy one, such as a football, so did 
the alphas recoil from the massive nucleus of the gold atom.
Alphas are much lighter than the nuclei of gold but heavier than a 
proton, the nucleus of the hydrogen atom. So if alpha particles are 
fired at hydrogen, one would have a situation akin to the football 
hitting the lightweight tennis ball. In such a case, the football will 
tend to carry on in its flightpath, knocking the tennis ball 
forwards in the same general direction. So when the relatively 
massive alphas hit the protons of hydrogen, it is these protons that

are ejected forwards. These were detected by the trails they left in 
cloud chambers (see Chapter 6).
By such experiments in the early years of the 20th century, the basic 
idea of the nuclear atom was established. To summarize: the way 
that the alpha particles scattered from atoms helped to establish the 
picture of the atom that we have known ever since: the positive 
charge lives in a compact bulky centre—the atomic nucleus—while 
the negatives are electrons whirling remotely on the periphery.
Naturally occurring alpha particles don’t pack much punch. They 
are ejected from heavy nuclei with only a few MeV kinetic energy, 
or equivalently a few MeV/c momentum, and as such are able to 
resolve structures on distance scales larger than about 10–12 m. 
Now, such sizes are smaller than those of atoms, which makes 
such alphas so useful, but they are still much larger than the 
10–14 m extent of even a large nucleus, such as that of a gold atom, 
let alone the 10–15 m size of the individual protons and neutrons 
that combine to make that nucleus. So although alphas were fine 
for discovering the existence of the atomic nucleus, to see inside 
such nuclei would require beams with more energy.
With this as the aim, we have here the beginnings of modern 
high-energy physics. It was in 1932 that the first accelerator of 
electrically charged particles was built by Cockroft and Walton, 
and a detailed picture of nuclear structure, and of the particles 
that build it, began to emerge. One can use beams of atomic 
nuclei, but while these were truly ‘atom (or rather nuclear) 
smashers’, and helped to determine the pattern of nuclear isotopes 
(forms of the same element that contain equal numbers of protons 
but different numbers of neutrons) and their details, the clearest 
information on their basic constituents came with the simplest 
beams. A nucleus of carbon contains typically six protons and a 
similar number of neutrons. As such there is a lot of debris when 
it hits another nucleus, some coming from the carbon beam itself 
as well as that from the target. This makes a clear interpretation How we learn what things are made of, and what we found
33
difficult. It is far cleaner to use a beam of just protons; this was, 
and remains today, one of the main ways of probing the nucleus, 
and distances down to 10–19 m.
Protons, which carry the positive charge, have been favourites for 
over 50 years, as they pack a big punch. However, electrons have 
some special advantages, and much of our present knowledge 
about the structure of atomic nuclei, and even the protons and 
neutrons from which they are made, is the result of experiments 
using electron beams.
Radioactivity in the form of beta decay emits electrons—the ‘beta’ 
radiation—which could be used to probe atomic structure. 
However, such electrons have energies of only a few MeV, as was 
the case for alpha particles, and so suffer the same limitations: 
they allow us to see a nucleus like the alpha can, but they cannot 
resolve the inner structure of the nucleus. The key to progress was 
to ionize atoms, liberating one or more of their electrons, and then 
accelerate the accumulated electron beam by means of electric 
fields. By the 1950s in Stanford, California, beams with energies of 
100 MeV to 1 GeV per electron began to resolve distances 
approaching 10–15 m. The electrons scattered from the protons, 
and neutrons began to reveal evidence of a deeper layer of 
structure within those nuclear particles. Such experiments showed 
that the neutron, though electrically neutral overall, has magnetic 
effects and other features suggesting there is charge within it, 
positive and negative counterbalancing somehow, as had been the 
case in atoms. Protons too were found to have a finite size, 
extending over a distance of order 10–15 m. Once it was established 
that protons are not point particles, the question arose as to how 
the charge of a proton is distributed within its size. Such questions 
are reminiscent of what had happened years before in the case of 
atoms, and the answers came by similar experiments. In the case 
of the atom, its hard nuclear core was revealed by the scattering of 
alpha particles; in the case of the proton, it would be beams of 
high-energy electrons that would give the answer.Particle Physics
34
It was the 3-km-long linear accelerator of electrons at Stanford 
that in 1968 took the first clean look inside the atomic nucleus and 
discovered that what we know as protons and neutrons are 
actually little spheres of swarming ‘quarks’.
At energies above 10 GeV, electrons can probe distances of 10–16 m, 
some ten times smaller than the proton as a whole. When they 
encountered the proton, the electrons were found to be scattered 
violently. This was analogous to what had happened 50 years 
earlier with the atom; where the violent scattering of relatively 
low-energy alpha particles had shown that the atom has a hard 
centre of charge, its nucleus, the unexpected violent scattering of 
high-energy electron beams showed that a proton’s charge is 
concentrated on ‘pointlike’ objects—the quarks (pointlike in the 
sense that we are not able to discern whether they have any 
substructure of their own). In the best experiments that we can do 
today, electrons and quarks appear to be the basic constituents of 
matter in bulk.35
Chapter 4
The heart of the matter
At the heart of ordinary matter, we find up and down quarks and 
the electron, while radioactivity reveals the ghostly neutrino. In this 
chapter we will see the roles they play and how their masses and 
other properties are critical for making life, the universe, but not 
everything. Cosmic rays have revealed evidence of extra-terrestrial 
forms of matter that do not occur naturally here on Earth. 
Meanwhile, the Sun and stars produce vast numbers of neutrinos, 
which is inspiring a new science: neutrino astronomy.
We have described how the discovery a century ago of atomic 
structure and of the proton came about as a result of scattering 
beams of high-energy particles from them. However, in the case of 
both atoms and protons, the first hints that they had a 
substructure came earlier, from the discovery of spectra.
The first clue to the existence of electrons within atoms was the 
discovery that atomic elements emit light with discrete 
wavelengths manifested, for example, as discrete colours rather 
than the full spread of the rainbow, so-called spectral lines. We 
now know that quantum mechanics restricts the states of motion 
of electrons within atoms to a discrete set, each member of which 
has a specific magnitude of energy. The configuration where an 
atom has the lowest total energy is known as the ‘ground state’; all 
other configurations have larger energies and are known as Particle Physics
36
excited states. Atomic spectra are due to light radiated or 
absorbed when their electrons jump between excited states, or 
between an excited state and the ground state. Energy is 
conserved overall; the difference in energy of the two atomic states 
is equal to the energy of the photon that has been emitted or 
absorbed in the process. It was the spectra of these photons that 
revealed the differences in these energy levels of the atom, and 
from the rich set of such data a picture of the energy levels could 
be deduced. Subsequently the development of quantum 
mechanics explained how the pattern of energy levels emerges: 
it is determined by the nature of the electric and magnetic forces 
binding the electrons around the central nucleus—in particular 
for the simplest atom, hydrogen, being intimately linked to the 
fact that the strength of the electrical force between its electron 
and proton falls as the square of the distance between them.
An analogous set of circumstances occurred in the case of the 
proton. When experiments with the first ‘atom smashers’ took 
place in the 1950s to 1960s, many short-lived heavier siblings of 
the proton and neutron, known as ‘resonances’, were discovered. 
A panoply of states emerged, and with hindsight it is obvious, 
though it was not so at the time, that here was evidence that the 
proton and neutron are composite systems made, as we now 
know, from quarks. It is the motion of these quarks that gives size 
to the proton and neutron, analogous to the way that the motion 
of electrons determines the size of atoms. It is the quarks that 
provide the electric charge and the magnetic properties of a 
proton or neutron. Although the electric charges of the quarks 
that form a neutron add up to zero, their individual magnetism 
does not cancel out, which leads to the magnetic moment of the 
neutron. It is when the quarks are in the state of lowest energy 
that the configurations that we call proton and neutron arise: 
excite one or more quarks to a higher energy level in the potential 
that binds them and one forms a short-lived resonance with a 
correspondingly larger rest-energy, or mass. Thus the The heart of the matter
37
spectroscopy of short-lived resonance states is due to the 
excitation of the constituent quarks.
This far is akin to the case of atoms. However, there are some 
important differences. When more and more energy is given to the 
electrons in an atom, they are raised to ever higher energy levels, 
until eventually they are ejected from the atom; in this type of 
scenario we say that the atom is ‘ionized’. In Chapter 2 we saw how 
a temperature of 104
 K provides enough energy to ionize atoms, as 
happens in the Sun. In the case of the proton, as it is hit with ever 
higher energies, its quarks are elevated to higher levels, and 
short-lived resonances are seen. This energy is rapidly released, by 
emitting photons or, as we shall see, other particles, and the 
resonance state decays back to the proton or neutron once more. 
No one has ever ionized a proton and liberated one of its 
constituent quarks in isolation: the quarks appear to be 
permanently confined within a region of about 10–15 m—the ‘size’ of 
the proton. Apart from this, which is a consequence of the nature 
of the forces between the quarks, the story is qualitatively similar 
to that of electrons within atoms. The excited levels are short lived, 
and release excess energy, typically by radiating energy in the form 
of gamma-ray photons, and fall back to the ground state (proton or 
neutron). Conversely one can excite these resonance states by 
scattering electrons from protons and neutrons.
The final piece to the analogy came around 1970. Beams of 
electrons, which had been accelerated to energies of over 20 GeV, 
were scattered from protons at Stanford in California. Similar to 
what had occurred for Rutherford half a century earlier, the 
electrons were observed to scatter through large angles. This was a 
direct consequence of the electrons colliding with quarks, the 
pointlike fundamental particles that comprise the proton.
These experiments have been extended to higher energies, most 
notably at the HERA accelerator in Hamburg, Germany. The Particle Physics
38
resulting high-resolution images of the proton have given 
fundamental insights into the nature of the forces binding the 
quarks to one another. This has given rise to the theory of quarks 
known as quantum chromodynamics, of which we shall learn 
more in Chapter 7. Its ability to describe the interactions of quarks 
and gluons at distance scales below 10–16 m has passed every 
experimental test.
Quarks with flavour
Three quarks clustered together are sufficient to make a proton or 
a neutron. There are two different varieties (or ‘flavours’) of quark 
needed to make a proton and neutron, known as the up and 
down (traditionally summarized by their first letters, u and d, 
respectively). Two ups and one down make a proton; two downs 
and one up make a neutron.
The quarks are electrically charged. An up quark carries a fraction 
2/3 of the (positive) charge of a proton, while a down quark 
carries a fraction –1/3 (that is, negative). Thus as the total electric 
charge of a collection is the sum of the individual pieces, we have 
for the charge of a proton p uud ( ) 2/3 2/3 – 1/3 1 = + =+ , and of a 
neutron n ddu ( ) = –1/3 – 1/3+ 2/3 = 0.
Particles have an intrinsic angular momentum, or ‘spin’. The 
amount of spin is measured in units of Planck’s quantum, 
h divided by 2π; as this combination occurs throughout atomic 
and particle physics it is denoted by the symbol ħ. The proton,

neutron, and the quarks each have an amount ħ/2, or in the usual 
shorthand, ‘spin 1/2’.
Spins add or subtract so long as the total is not negative. So 
combining two particles each having spin 1/2 gives either 0 or 1. 
Adding three together gives a total of either 1/2 or 3/2. The proton 
and neutron have spin 1/2 resulting from the three quarks having 
coupled their individual spins to the former possibility. When the 
quarks combine to a total of 3/2, they have slightly greater total 
energy, and this forms the short-lived particles known as the 
‘Δ resonances’, which have some 30 per cent more mass than do the 
proton or neutron, and they survive less than 10–23 s before decaying 
back to the more stable neutron or proton. (10–23 s is a time too short 
to imagine, but roughly it is similar to the time that it takes light to 
travel across a single atomic nucleus.) Rules of quantum theory (the 
‘Pauli exclusion principle’) allow only certain correlations to occur 
among the spins and flavours of the quarks, and it is this that 
ultimately forbids three ‘identical’ up quarks (or three down) to 
combine into a net spin 1/2; thus there are no siblings of the proton 
and neutron with charge +2 or –1 made respectively of uuu and ddd. 
By contrast, when the three quarks have coupled their spins to a 
total of 3/2, three identical ‘flavours’ of quark are allowed to cluster 
together. Thus there exist examples such as the Δ++(uuu) and 
Δ–
(ddd) (with superscripts denoting their electric charges). The full

details of how these correlations emerge involve properties of the 
quarks that govern the strong interquark forces (see Chapter 7), but 
go beyond the scope of this short introduction.
The individual quarks have masses that are about ten times larger 
than that of an electron. As protons and neutrons have similar 
masses to one another, and nearly 2,000 times greater than that 
of an electron, there are two questions to face. One is: how do the 
proton and neutron get such large masses; the other is: are the 
masses of these quarks perhaps to be regarded as similar to that of 
the electron, hinting at some deeper unity among the fundamental 
constituents of matter?
Quarks grip one another so tightly that they are forever 
imprisoned in groups, such as the threesome that forms the entity 
that we call the proton. No quark has ever been isolated from such 
a family; their universe extends only for the 10–15 m that is the 
extent of the proton’s size, and it is this confinement within the 
10–15 m ‘femtouniverse’ that we call the proton that gives them 
collectively an energy of ~938 MeV, which is the mass of the 
proton. We saw how length and energy are related, and that 
distances of the order of 10–15 m correspond to an energy of 
around 1 GeV. The precise correspondence of relevance here 
involves factors of 2 and π, which go beyond this Very Short 
Introduction, with the result that an up or down quark, which 
were it free would have a mass of only a few MeV, when restricted 
to a femtouniverse of 10–15 m has an energy of some 200–300 MeV. 
The quarks are interacting strongly with one another (which must 
be so as they do not escape!), and the full details of how the mass 
of the proton turns out to be precisely 938.4 MeV is beyond our 
ability to derive from theory at present.
The down quark is a few MeV more massive than the up quark. 
We don’t know why this is (indeed, we don’t know why these 
fundamental particles, along with the electron, have the masses 
they do), but this does explain why the neutron is slightly more The heart of the matter
41
massive than the proton. A trio as in uud (proton) and ddu
(neutron) each have mass of around 1 GeV due to their common 
entrapment in a 10–15 m region. There will be differences at the 
order of an MeV as a result of two features: (i) the neutron has an 
extra down quark at the expense of an up quark relative to the 
proton, and the greater mass of this down quark gives the total in 
forming the neutron a greater mass than the corresponding trio 
for a proton; (ii) the electrostatic forces among two ups and a 
down (as in a proton) will differ from those between two downs 
and an up (as in a neutron). These also contribute to the total 
energy at the MeV scale. So the mass difference between a neutron 
and proton (experimentally 1.3 MeV) is due to the electrostatic 
forces between their constituent quarks and the greater intrinsic 
mass of a down quark relative to the up quark.
Up and down are siblings in the quark family. The electron is not 
made of quarks, and as far as we know is itself fundamental, like 
the quarks. As such it belongs to a different family, known as 
leptons. As up and down quarks are paired, with a difference of 
one unit between their respective electric charges (in the sense 
that +2/3 – (–1/3) = 1), so does the electron have a sibling whose 
electric charge differs from the electron’s by one unit. This entity, 
with no electric charge, is known as the neutrino.
Neutrinos are produced in radioactive decays of many atomic 
nuclei. In these processes they appear along with their sibling, the 
electron. For example, so long as it is not trapped in a nucleus, a 
neutron turns into a proton by emitting an electron and a 
neutrino in the process. This is called beta decay, where the 
instability of the neutron is due to it having a slightly greater mass 
than does a proton. Nature seeks the state of lowest energy, which 
translates in this case to the state of lowest mass. It is the small 
excess mass of a neutron that makes it (slightly) unstable when 
left in isolation. If you had a large sample of neutrons, each of 
them free of the others, then after about 10 minutes, half will have 
decayed by beta radioactivity. If we denote the neutron and proton Particle Physics
42
by the symbols n, p, and the electron and neutrino by e–
, ν, then 
beta decay of the neutron is summarized by the expression
n→ p + e –+ν
The neutron has no electrical charge overall; this is preserved 
in the beta decay as the proton has one unit positive, 
counterbalancing the negative electron. The proton, being the 
lightest state made of three quarks, is stable (or, at least, if protons 
are unstable, their mean lifetime is greater than 1032 years!) 
Technically an anti-neutrino is produced: see later section, 
‘Antiparticles’.
The neutrino
If we imagined removing the electric charge from the electron and 
also (almost) all of its mass, the resulting electrically neutral entity 
would be in effect a neutrino. Along with no electric charge, the 
neutrino has almost no mass and goes through almost everything. 
Oblivious to the normal electrical forces that act within bulk 
matter, neutrinos are hard to detect. It is figuratively the most 
nugatory of the particles.
The neutrino is the first ‘fossil’ relic of the Big Bang, and a 
messenger from the earliest processes in the universe. Neutrinos 
determine how fast the universe is expanding, and may determine 
its ultimate destiny. In stars like the Sun, they are essential in 
helping to cook the heavy elements that are necessary for life. The 
Sun is powered by the fusion of protons near its centre bumping 
into one another, joining and building up the nuclei of helium.

In doing so some protons turn into neutrons by a form of beta 
radioactivity, and neutrinos are emitted as this happens. The 
effect is enormous: neutrinos are produced in the Sun at a rate 
of ´ 38 2 10 each second. That’s 2 followed by 38 zeroes; I cannot 
even imagine how to give an idea of how huge that number is—it’s 
like the relative size of the whole universe to the size of a single 
atom. These neutrinos fly out into space and many hit Earth. 
About 400 billion neutrinos from the Sun pass through each one 
of us each second.
Natural radioactivity of the elements in the ground, such as 
uranium, also liberate neutrinos: about 50 billion of them hit us 
each second. So the Sun is indeed putting out a lot: eight times as 
many arrive from the Sun each second after spreading out over 
100 million km of space than come from beneath our feet here at 
home. And we ourselves are radioactive (mainly from the decays of 
potassium in our bones) and emit some 400 neutrinos a second.
All in all, neutrinos are the commonest particles of all. There are 
even more of them flying around the cosmos than there are 
photons, the basic particles of light.
Neutrinos from the Sun fly through matter almost unchecked, so 
as many fly up through our beds at night as shine down on our 
heads by day. One of these neutrinos could fly through a light year 
of lead without hitting anything. This property of the neutrino is 
frequently mentioned in popular articles, and begs an obvious 
question: how do we detect them? Two things come to our aid.
The first is to use very intense sources of neutrinos so that the 
lottery of chance means that one or two will bump into atoms in 
some detector and be recorded. Although a single neutrino 
might only interact once in a blue moon (or a light year), the 
Sun is putting out so many that chance provides assistance. You 
or I have almost no chance of winning the lottery, but enough 
people enter that someone does. With enough neutrinos shining Particle Physics
44
down on us, and a large amount of detector material, a few will 
hit atoms in the detector and reveal themselves. As a result, it 
has been possible to detect neutrinos coming from the Sun, 
from supernova SN1987A, and also ultra-high energy neutrinos 
from the cosmos. A new science, called neutrino astronomy, is 
now beginning.
The second property that comes to our aid is that their ‘shyness’ is 
only true for neutrinos with low energies, such as those emitted by 
the Sun. By contrast, neutrinos with high energy (as produced in 
some cosmic processes or in high-energy particle accelerators) 
have much greater propensity to reveal themselves. So it is in 
high-energy accelerators that we have produced neutrinos and 
studied them in detail. And it is here that we are getting our first 
hints that neutrinos do have a small, but non-zero, mass. These 
data also reveal that neutrinos occur in three distinct varieties, or 
‘flavours’ (Chapter 8). For now, by ‘neutrino’ I shall mean the most 
familiar one partnered with the electron.
Antiparticles
The quarks and the electron are the basic seeds of atoms, and of 
matter as we know it. But they are not the full story; they also 
occur in a sort of mirror image form, known as antiparticles, the 
seeds of antimatter. Every variety of particle has as its ‘anti’ 
version; an entity with the same mass, spin, size, and amount of 
electric charge as itself, but with the sign of that charge reversed. 
So, for example, the negatively charged electron has as its 
anti-electron a positively charged entity, which is known as the 
positron, not to be confused with the proton. A proton is nearly 
2,000 times more massive than a positron, and has its own 
anti-version, the antiproton, which has negative charge.
The forces that enable an electron and proton to combine to form 
an atom of hydrogen also enable a positron and antiproton to form The heart of the matter
45
an atom of antihydrogen. At CERN it is possible to create and store 
atoms of antihydrogen. This enables the properties of antihydrogen 
to be compared with those of hydrogen. Finding any difference 
between these two forms of substance would shake the foundations 
of particle physics. As of 2023, no difference has been found.
We can summarize the charges of the basic particles and 
antiparticles that we have met so far in the table in Figure 10.
As a proton is made of uud, so is the antiproton made of the 
corresponding antiquarks, uud. It is traditional to denote an 
antiparticle by the symbol of the corresponding particle but with a 
line over the top. This is so unless the charge is specified, in which 
case the antiparticle is of the opposite charge (for example the 
positron, which is uniformly denoted as e+ for historical reasons). 
Similarly for the neutron ddu, the antineutron is made of dd u. 
So although a neutron and antineutron have the same electrical 
charge, their inner structure distinguishes them. A neutrino and 
antineutrino also have the same charge, but their distinguishing 
property is more subtle. When neutrinos interact with a particle of 
matter, a neutron say, they will turn into electrons and the neutron 
is converted into a proton, thereby preserving overall the 
electric charge:

In this sense we see that the neutrino has an affinity for the 
electron. An antineutrino has an analogous affinity for the 
positron. The conservation of electric charge then prevents an 
antineutrino interacting with a neutron to make an analogue of 
the above, but if it hits a proton, it can reveal itself.
ν�+p→e+ +n
We have seen how three quarks unite to make particles such 
as the proton and neutron (generically these three-quark 
composites are known as baryons). The clusters of three 
antiquarks are then known collectively as antibaryons. It is 
possible to cluster quarks and antiquarks; one of each is 
sufficient. So if we use q to denote either of u or d, and q� to 
denote the antiquarks, it is possible to make four combinations 
of clusters qq�. As a three-quark cluster is called a baryon, so this 
combination of quark and antiquark is known as a meson. As 
was the case for the proton and neutron, there are higher-energy 
‘resonant’ states for these mesons too.
One of the most famous properties of antimatter is that when it 
meets with matter, the two mutually annihilate in a flash of 
radiation, such as photons of light. It is no surprise then that 
mesons do not live very long. A quark and an antiquark, restricted 
to the femtouniverse of 10–15 m, mutually annihilate within a 
billionth of a second, or less. Even so, such ephemeral mesons play 
a role in building our universe. The most familiar, and the lightest, 
configuration are the pions, such as the ud + p ( ) and du - p ( ) which 
were predicted by the Japanese theorist Hideki Yukawa in 1935 as 
ephemeral entities within atomic nuclei that provided the strong 
attractive force that holds nuclei together. Their subsequent 
discovery in 1947 brilliantly confirmed this theory. Today we know 
of their deeper structure, and also have a more profound 
understanding of the forces at work on quarks, and antiquarks, 
which build up the mesons and baryons and ultimately atomic 
nuclei (see Chapter 7).The heart of the matter
47
There are two neutral combinations that we can form: uu and dd. 
These make the electrically neutral pion πo
, and seed another 
meson, the electrically neutral eta η. Why it is that a single quark 
can grip a single antiquark like this, but that three quarks or three 
antiquarks are attracted to form baryons or antibaryons, will be 
described in Chapter 7.48
Chapter 5
Accelerators: cosmic 
and man-­made
For more than a century beams of particles have been used to 
reveal the inner structure of atoms. These have progressed from 
naturally occurring alpha and beta particles, courtesy of natural 
radioactivity, through cosmic rays to intense beams of electrons, 
protons, and other particles at modern accelerators. By smashing 
the primary beams into a target, some of the energy can be 
converted into new particles, which can themselves be 
accumulated and made into secondary beams. Thus beams of 
pions and neutrinos, as well as other particles called kaons and 
muons, have been made, along with antiparticles such as positrons 
and antiprotons. There are even beams of heavy ions—atoms 
stripped of their electrons—which enable violent collisions 
between heavy nuclei to be investigated.
Different particles probe matter in complementary ways. It has 
been by combining the information from these various approaches 
that our present rich picture has emerged. For much of the 
20th century, beams of particles were directed at static targets, 
but since the 1970s increasingly counter-rotating beams have been 
brought into head-on collision. The strategy includes making 
counter-rotating beams of particles and antiparticles, such as 
electrons and positrons, or protons and antiprotons, and colliding 
them head on. Beams of electrons or positrons have been collided 
with beams of protons at HERA in Hamburg to provide fine-grain Accelerators: cosmic and man-made
49
images of the internal structure of protons. The most extreme 
examples of colliding beams are at CERN’s Large Hadron Collider, 
where protons or heavy ions collide at energies above a TeV, 
1,000 GeV. Such techniques enable questions to be investigated 
that would otherwise be impossible, as we shall see later.
There has also been a renewed interest in cosmic rays, where 
Nature provides particles at energies far beyond anything that we 
can contemplate achieving on Earth. The problem is that such 
rays come at random, and are much less intense than beams made 
at accelerators. It was the desire to replicate the cosmic rays under 
controlled conditions that in the 1950s inspired development of 
high-energy physics at accelerators. Today we are recognizing that 
the Big Bang may have made exotic particles, far more massive 
than we can ever make on earth, but which might arrive in cosmic 
rays occasionally. We discovered strange particles (see Chapter 8) 
in cosmic rays, and later made them to order at accelerator 
experiments; there is hope that similar fortunes might await us.
Stars and supernovae emit neutrinos; special laboratories have 
been constructed underground to obstruct the arrival of all but 
the most penetrating particles, such as neutrinos. Neutrino 
astronomy is a new area of science that is beginning to flower. 
One example is the use of the ice pack in Antarctica as a natural 
detector of cosmic neutrinos.
These are examples of what is known as non-accelerator physics, 
where natural processes have produced the particles and we detect 
their effects. Here on Earth we can make intense beams of 
high-energy particles in laboratories with particle accelerators. 
In this chapter I shall focus on how accelerators have developed 
and what is involved in making them.
Electrically charged particles are accelerated by electric forces. 
Apply enough electric force to an electron, say, and it will go faster 
and faster in a straight line. In the 1970s the 3-km-long linear Particle Physics
50
accelerator at Stanford in California could accelerate electrons to 
energies of 50 GeV. It was the world’s largest linear accelerator, 
but it is no longer used for particle physics.
Under the influence of a magnetic field, the path of a charged 
particle will curve. By using electric fields to speed them, and 
magnetic fields to bend their trajectory, we can steer particles 
round circles over and over again. This is the basic idea behind 
huge rings, such as the 27-km-long Large Hadron Collider at 
CERN in Geneva.
From cyclotrons to synchrotrons
Exploration of the atom had begun with beams of alpha and 
beta particles from radioactive bodies. But the individual 
particles had small energies and restricted ability to get inside 
the nuclear environment. Beams of high-energy particles 
changed all that.
The original idea had been to accelerate particles to high energy 
through a series of small pushes from relatively low accelerating 
voltages. Particles travel through a series of separate metal 
cylinders in an evacuated tube. Within the cylinders there is no 
electric field, and the particles simply coast along. But across the 
gaps between the cylinders electric fields are set up by means of 
alternating voltages, which switch between positive and negative 
values. The frequency of the alternating voltage is matched with 
the length of the cylinders, so that the particles always feel a kick, 
not a brake, as they emerge into a gap. In this way, the particles 
are accelerated every time they cross between one cylinder and the 
next. This is the basis of the operation of modern linear 
accelerators. Usually such ‘linacs’ are short, low-energy machines, 
but they can be high energy and lengthy, as at the Stanford Linear 
Accelerator in California. They are most commonly used in the 
preliminary stages of acceleration at today’s big rings, as at the 
Large Hadron Collider (page 61).Accelerators: cosmic and man-made
51
The idea of creating a ring-shaped accelerator originated with 
Ernest Lawrence, who used a magnetic field to bend the particles 
into a circular orbit. Two hollow semi-circular metal cavities, or 
‘Ds’, were placed facing one another to form a circle, with a small 
gap between the two flat faces of the Ds. The whole construction 
was only about 20 cm across, and Lawrence placed it between the 
circular north and south poles of an electromagnet, to swing the 
particles round the curve, while an electric field in the gap 
provided them with speed. After being accelerated by the electric 
field in the gap, they curved round in a circular path until they 
met the gap half an orbit later. By this device they could pass 
across the same accelerating gap many times, rather than travel 
through a succession of gaps. They spiral outwards as their speed 
increases, but the time intervals between successive crossings of 
the gaps remain constant.
To accelerate the particles continuously, the electric field in the 
gap must switch back and forth at the same frequency with which 
the particles complete the circuit. Then particles issuing from a 
source at the centre of the whirling device would spiral out to the 
edge and emerge with a greatly increased energy.
This device was known as a ‘cyclotron’, and worked on the 
principle that the particles always take the same time to complete 
a circuit. This is, however, only approximately true in practice. As 
the energy of the particles increases, the effects of special relativity 
play an ever more important role. In particular, there is an 
increasing resistance to acceleration, where more force is required 
to obtain the same acceleration as the speed approaches that of 
light. The accelerated particles take longer to complete a circuit, 
eventually arriving too late at the gap to catch the alternating 
voltage during the accelerating part of its cycle.
The solution was to adjust the frequency of the applied voltage 
so that it remains in step with the particles as they take longer to 
circulate. However, there is a catch: a machine operating at Particle Physics
52
variable frequency can no longer accelerate a continuous stream 
of particles, as the cyclotron had done. Changing the frequency 
to keep in time with higher-energy particles would mean that 
any particles still at lower energies would become out of step. 
Instead, the ‘synchrocyclotron’ takes particles from the source a 
bunch at a time, and accelerates these bunches out to the edge of 
the magnet.
The synchrocyclotron was able to accelerate protons to sufficient 
energies that collisions with nuclei produce pions, the lightest 
particles that, we now know, are made from a single quark and an 
antiquark. However, the machine was nearly 5 m in diameter, and 
to go to higher energies, such as those needed to produce the more 
massive strange particles, was impractical.
The solution was to increase the strength of the magnetic field 
continuously as the circling particles gain energy, thereby keeping 
them on the same orbit instead of spiralling outwards. Moreover, 
the enormous single magnet of the cyclotron can be replaced by a 
doughnut-like ring of smaller magnets, which is the shape familiar 
to modern accelerator rings. The particles travel through a 
circular evacuated pipe held in the embrace of the magnets; they 
are accelerated during each circuit by an alternating voltage of 
varying frequency, which is applied at one or more places around 
the ring; and they are held on their circular course through the 
pipe by the steadily increasing strength of the magnetic field. Such

cyclotron was only 13 cm in diameter. The magnetic field that steers 
the particles on a circular path is supplied by two electromagnets. 
These generate a vertical north–south field through the path of the 
particles, which are contained in a horizontal plane. They are 
accelerated by an electric field, which is provided across a gap between 
the two hollow D-shaped metal vacuum chambers. A radioactive 
source at the centre provides the particles. The particles curl round in 
the cyclotron’s magnetic field, but as they increase in energy they curl 
less and so spiral outwards until they emerge from the machine.Accelerators: cosmic and man-made

a machine is called a synchrotron. The first major synchrotrons 
were at Brookhaven in the USA and CERN in Geneva, with 
energies up to 30 GeV by 1960.
In the 1960s the idea of quarks emerged, and with this came the 
challenge to reach energies above 100 GeV in the vain hope of 
knocking quarks out of protons. Improvements in technology led 
to more powerful magnets, and by placing them in a ring with a 
diameter of over a kilometre, by the middle of the 1970s Fermilab 
near Chicago in the USA and CERN had achieved proton energies 
of some 500 GeV. By 1982 Fermilab had achieved 1,000 GeV, or 
‘1 TeV’, and became known as the ‘Tevatron’.
Today, superconducting magnets enable even more powerful 
magnetic fields to be achieved. At Fermilab, alongside the 
Tevatron, is a smaller ring known as the Main Injector. One of 
the Main Injector’s tasks is to direct protons at 120 GeV onto 
targets to create secondary beams of particles for experiments. 
The extracted protons strike special targets of carbon or 
beryllium to produce showers of pions and kaons. The pions are 
allowed to decay to produce a neutrino beam, while the kaons 
can be separated out to form a kaon beam for experiments. 
Different particles with different properties can probe different 
features of the target and help to build a richer picture of its 
make-up.
The Main Injector also directs 120 GeV protons onto a special 
nickel target at energies sufficient to produce further protons and 
antiprotons at a rate of up to 200 billion antiprotons in an hour. 
Antiprotons, the antimatter versions of protons, have negative 
rather than positive electric charge, and this means that they can 
travel round the Tevatron’s ring of superconducting magnets at 
the same time and at the same velocity as the protons, but in the 
opposite direction. Once the particles are at 1,000 GeV, or 1 TeV, 
the two beams are allowed to collide head on—and the Tevatron 
has reached its final goal: collisions of protons and antiprotons at 55
12. The Cosmotron at the Brookhaven National Laboratory, New York. This was the first proton 
synchrotron to come into operation, in 1952, accelerating protons to an energy of 3 GeV. The 
magnet ring was divided into four sections (the nearest is clearly visible here), each consisting of 
72 steel blocks, about 2.5 m × 2.5 m with an aperture of 15 cm × 35 cm for the beam to pass through. 
The machine ceased operation in 1966.Particle Physics

energies that recreate the conditions of the universe when it was 
less than a trillionth of a second old.
The Tevatron was the world’s most powerful accelerator until 
the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) began operation at CERN 
in 2008. In the LHC, a 27-km ring of magnets steers two 
counter-rotating beams of protons, or of atomic nuclei, to meet 
head on at energies up to 7 TeV. This is currently the pinnacle of 
colliding beam technology.
Linear accelerators
In the 1960s, the Stanford Linear Accelerator became the longest 
linac in the world. It accelerated electrons to 50 GeV energy in 
just 3 km, whereas in the 1990s at LEP, a circular accelerator, they 
reached 100 GeV but required 27 km circumference for the ring. 
Why this difference, and what decides whether to make a linear or 
circular accelerator?
Electron synchrotrons work perfectly well apart from one 
fundamental problem: high-energy electrons radiate away energy 
when they travel on a circular path. The radiation—known as 
synchrotron radiation—is greater the tighter the radius of the 
orbit and the higher the energy of the particle. Protons also emit 
synchrotron radiation, but because they are 2,000 times as 
massive as electrons, they can reach much higher energies before 
the amount of energy lost becomes significant. But even at only a 
few GeV, electrons circulating in a synchrotron radiate a great deal 
of energy, which must be paid for by pumping in more energy 
through the radio waves in the accelerating cavities. It was for 
these reasons that until recently high-energy electron accelerators 
have been linear. Indeed, electrons have only been used in circular 
machines for the special advantages that can arise. Specifically, the 
head-on collisions make more efficient use of the energy than 
when a static target is hit. The second major advantage is the 
ability to probe in ways that would otherwise prove impossible, as Accelerators: cosmic and man-made
57
for instance at LEP—the Large Electron Positron collider, at 
CERN—where electrons annihilated with positrons, and the 
counter-rotating beams were the only effective way to achieve the 
required high intensity.
LEP was a circular machine in a tunnel 27 km long. This is 
testament to the problems with lightweight electrons and 
positrons travelling round circles, that such a distance is needed to 
enable them to reach 100 GeV without wasting too much energy 
in radiation. To boost electrons to energies of several hundred 
GeV in circular orbits would require distances of hundreds of 
kilometres, which are impractical. This is why longer-term plans 
for very high energy accelerators of electrons and positrons focus 
on linear colliders.
To have a decent chance of a collision in a linear accelerator, 
where the beams meet once only, requires high-intensity beams 
13. A view inside the 27-km (17-mile) circular tunnel of CERN’s Large 
Hadron Collider (LHC). Two beams of protons travel in opposite 
directions through hundreds of specially designed magnets at energies

14. The 3-km- (2-mile-) long linear accelerator at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center 
(SLAC). The electrons start off from an accelerator ‘gun’ where they are released from a 
heated filament at the end of the machine at the bottom left of the picture. The electrons in 
effect surf along radio waves set up in a chain of 100,000 cylindrical copper ‘cavities’, about 
12 cm in diameter. The machine is aligned to 0.5 mm along its complete length and situated 
in a tunnel 8 m below ground. The surface buildings that mark out the line of linac contain 
the klystrons which provide the radio waves.Accelerators: cosmic and man-made
59
that are less than a micron (10–6 m) across. In actuality it is more 
miss than hit. As the like charges within each beam repel one 
another, making and controlling such tightly focused beams is a 
technological challenge. If the beams were tuned to each have 
energy of 62.5 GeV, which is half the mass (rest energy) of a Higgs 
boson, it could be possible to produce a Higgs boson at rest. This 
could be a key strategy for a dedicated ‘Higgs factory’, producing 
large numbers of Higgs bosons for precision study.
Colliders
In a linear accelerator aimed at a static target the debris of the 
collision is propelled forwards, just as a stationary car is shunted 
forwards when another car crashes into its rear. When a beam hits 
a stationary target, the hard-won energy of the beam particles is 
being transferred largely into energy of motion—into moving 
particles in the target—and is effectively wasted. This problem is 
overcome if we can bring particles to collide head on, so that their 
energy can be spent on the interaction between them. In such a 
collision the debris flies off in all directions, and the energy is 
redistributed with it—none is ‘wasted’ in setting stationary lumps 
in motion.
These arguments were clear to accelerator builders as long ago as 
the 1940s, but it took 20 years for particle colliders to take shape, 
and another 15 years for them to become the dominant form of 
particle accelerator.
Protons are bunches of quarks, and antiprotons are likewise made 
of antiquarks. With a mass of nearly 2,000 times that of an 
electron, protons and antiprotons suffer less synchrotron radiation 
and also pack a bigger punch. Hence they are the prime choice 
when the aim is to reach out to previously unexplored higher 
energies. Such was the case in 1983 when head-on collisions 
between protons and antiprotons at CERN led to the discovery 
of the W±
 and Zo
 carriers of the weak forces (see Chapter 7). Particle Physics
60
The proton’s energy is shared among its quarks, and it is chance 
whether the energy of a single quark that meets an antiquark 
matches that required to form a Zo
 or W ±
. Nonetheless they 
showed up as one in a million special cases in the collection of 
images of the collisions. The challenge was then to make a Zo
regularly without the vast unwanted and confusing background. 
This was done by tuning a beam of electrons and positrons to the 
required energy. This led to the Large Electron Positron collider. 
The technical challenges of making experiments with such 
machines can be illustrated by reference to LEP.
When LEP began running, in the 1990s, needle-like bunches of 
electrons and positrons would pass through each other at the 
heart of the detectors every 22 microseconds (22 millionths of a 
second). Even though there were some million million particles in 
each bunch, the particles were thinly dispersed, so interactions 
between them were rare. An interesting collision, or ‘event’, only 
occurred about once every 40 times or so the bunches crossed. 
The challenge was to identify and collect the interesting events, 
and to not miss them while recording something more mundane. 
An electronic ‘trigger’ responded to the first signals from a 
collision to ‘decide’ within 10 microseconds whether something 
interesting had occurred. If it had, the process of reading out and 
combining the information from all the pieces of the detector 
would begin, and a display on a computer screen would recreate 
the pattern of particle tracks and show where energy had been 
deposited in the detector. LEP was closed in 2000 to make way 
for the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).
From 1992 to 2007, in Hamburg, there was a unique asymmetric 
collider where a beam of protons collided with a beam of electrons 
or of positrons. The resulting collisions enabled the proton 
substructure, and that of its quarks, to be probed at distances 
down to 10–19 m. The resulting information about the quark and 
gluon structure within a proton proved key to planning 
experiments with protons at the LHC.Accelerators: cosmic and man-made
61
The Large Hadron Collider
The LHC at CERN, commissioned in 2008, is the culmination of 
decades of accelerator development. To collide proton beams at 
energies of 7 TeV requires a range of accelerators. The story starts 
with a bottle of hydrogen gas, about the size of a fire extinguisher. 
The bottle contains enough protons to run the LHC for decades, 
though for safety reasons the bottle is replenished twice a year.
First, hydrogen atoms are fed into a linear accelerator. Intense 
electric fields strip the hydrogen atoms’ proton of its surrounding 
electron. The protons are then accelerated to a speed of about 1/3 
that of light. When a carefully monitored number has been 
collected, the packet is automatically injected into a booster 
accelerator and their speed increased to about 90 per cent that of 
light. Straight acceleration is now impractical, so magnets push 
the beams around a circle of about 160 m circumference while 
electric fields in regular pulses thrust them, analogous to pushing 
a child on a swing.
Next, they enter a proton synchrotron. At 630 m in circumference, 
this was CERN’s state of the art accelerator in the 1960s. The 
protons exit this synchrotron with an energy of about 25 GeV and 
enter a larger synchrotron which raises their energy to about 
450GeV. This, the machine that discovered the W and Z bosons in 
1983, is today the launch pad into the LHC itself.
There are two vacuum tubes in the LHC, one for each proton 
beam. One beam circulates clockwise, the other anticlockwise, 
around the 27-km ring, 11,000 times each second. At four points 
around the ring, the beams cross one another.
Each beam consists of packets of protons about 7 m apart in 
pencil-thin bunches about 60 cm long. In other words, at any 
moment, most of the tube is empty space. Electronics are tuned so Particle Physics
62
these counter-rotating bunches reach the cross-over points with a 
precision of better than one tenth of a billionth of a second.
Their energy is raised to as much as 6 TeV. Collisions occasionally 
produce Higgs bosons. Each collision point is surrounded with 
cylinders of sophisticated electronics to detect the results of the 
collisions and tease out evidence of Higgs bosons and other 
transient particles.
Factories
The conundrum of how matter and antimatter differ has moved 
into focus in recent years. This has led to an intense interest in 
the properties of strange particles and antiparticles—the 
kaons—where a subtle asymmetry was discovered nearly 50 years 
ago, and their bottom analogues (see p. 101), where a large 
asymmetry was predicted. This led to the concept of particle 
‘factories’, capable of producing as many kaons or B mesons as 
possible.
The idea is to make electrons and positrons collide at specific 
energies, ‘tuned’ to produce kaons or B mesons, respectively, in 
preference to other kinds of particles.
A ‘B factory’ makes electron-positron collisions at a total energy 
of around 10 GeV, optimized to produce B mesons and their 
antiparticles (B, pronounced B- � bar) together. So compelling is the 
challenge that two machines were built in the late 1990s—PEP2 at 
Stanford in California, which ended in 2008, and KEKB at the KEK 
laboratory in Japan, which has been superseded by SuperKEKB.
The B factories differ from previous electron-positron colliders in 
an intriguing way. In a standard electron-positron collider, the 
beams travel in opposite directions but with the same speed, so 
that when particles meet their motion exactly cancels out. The 
resulting ‘explosion’ when the electrons and positrons mutually Accelerators: cosmic and man-made
63
annihilate is at rest, and newly created particles of matter and 
antimatter emerge rather uniformly in all directions. In the B 
factories, the colliding beams move with different speeds—at 
SuperKEKB electrons have 7 GeV energy while positrons are at 
4 GeV—so the resulting explosion is itself moving.
As a result of this asymmetric collision, the matter and antimatter 
that emerge tend to be ejected in the direction of the faster initial 
beam, and at higher speeds than from an annihilation at rest. This 
makes it easier to observe not only the particles created, but also 
the progeny they produce when they die—thanks to an effect of 
special relativity (time dilation) which means that particles 
survive longer and travel further (about 1 mm) when moving at 
high speed. These are essential tricks because a B meson, at rest, 
lives only for a picosecond, a millionth of a millionth of a second, 
and this is on the margins of measurability.
Intense sources of neutrinos can enable study of these enigmatic 
particles. Their masses are too small to measure, but indirect 
measures of their differences in mass can be obtained. There is 
even the possibility that neutrinos and antineutrinos might 
change into one another, a form of matter into antimatter that 
could have important implications for our understanding of this 
profound asymmetry. The dedicated study of neutrinos is a rich 
field and is described in Chapters 9 and 10.
Finally, the discovery in 2012 of the Higgs boson, with a mass of 
125 GeV, among the debris from collisions between protons at 
CERN’s Large Hadron Collider, has created interest in producing 
large numbers of these bosons under more controlled conditions. 
The Chinese have made a proposal to build a 100-km-long tunnel 
housing an electron-positron collider capable of producing 
millions of Higgs bosons. Plans for a ‘Higgs factory’ are still being 
debated and are unlikely to develop for some decades, however.64

Detectors: cameras and 
time machines
Early methods
Ways of detecting subatomic particles are more familiar than 
many people realize. The crackle of a Geiger counter, and the light 
emitted when electrically charged particles, such as electrons, hit 
specially prepared materials forming the picture on a classic 
television screen, are but two.
Rutherford discovered the atomic nucleus by its effect on beams of 
alpha particles; they had scattered through large angles. He had 
used scintillating materials to reveal them as they scattered from 
the atomic nucleus. Rutherford and his colleagues had to use their 
own eyes to see and count the flashes; by the 1950s electronic 
components had automated the process of counting the flashes 
from modern scintillators.
When a charged particle travels through a gas, it leaves behind a 
trail of ionized atoms. A whole range of particle detectors, from 
the cloud chamber to the wire spark chamber, depended on 
sensing this trail of ionization in some way.
By such means, nearly a century ago, Rutherford was able to 
detect alpha particles that had been emitted by radium or 
polonium, one at a time.Detectors: cameras and time machines
65
The key feature was that the detector could greatly amplify the 
tiny amount of ionization caused by the passage of a single alpha 
particle. It consisted of a brass tube, which was pumped out to a 
low pressure, and had a thin wire passing along the centre. The 
wire and tube had 1,000 volts applied between them, which set up 
an electric field. Under this arrangement, when a charged particle 
passes through the rarefied gas, ions are created. They are 
attracted towards the wire, and as they speed up they ionize more 
gas, amplifying the initial effect. One ion could spawn thousands, 
which all end up at the central wire, producing a pulse of electric 
charge large enough to be detected by a sensitive electrometer 
connected to the wire.
In the ‘Geiger counter’ the electric field at the wire is so high that a 
single electron anywhere in the counter can trigger an avalanche 
of ionization, such that the tiniest amount of ionization produces 
a signal.
Although this reveals the presence of radiation, it is far removed 
from what is needed for detecting particles in modern high-energy 
experiments. Let’s see how detection has developed.
The first detector capable of revealing trails of charged particles 
was the cloud chamber, which is a glass chamber fitted with a 
piston and filled with water vapour. When you quickly withdraw 
the piston, the sudden expansion will cool the gas and a mist forms 
in the cold, damp atmosphere. When alpha and beta particles from 
radioactivity pass through, they ionize atoms in the vapour and 
cloud drops form instantly around their trail. When illuminated, 
the tracks stand out like the dust motes in a sunbeam.
Historically, mostly in the first half of the 20th century, the cloud 
chamber was used to detect particles in cosmic rays, its efficiency 
improved by combining it with the Geiger counter. Put one Geiger 
counter above and another below the cloud chamber, then if both 
fire simultaneously it is very likely that a cosmic ray has passed Particle Physics
66
through them and, by implication, through the chamber. Connect 
the Geiger counters to a relay mechanism so that the electrical 
impulse from their coincident discharges triggers the expansion of 
the cloud chamber, and a flash of light allows the tracks to be 
captured on film.
The first example of an antiparticle, the positron, and also strange 
particles were discovered in cosmic rays by means of the cloud 
chamber. However, such techniques were superseded by the use of 
emulsions.
Emulsions
Photographic plates had figured in the very earliest work on 
radioactivity; indeed, it was through the darkening of plates that 
both X-rays and radioactivity were discovered.
In the late 1940s, high-quality photographic emulsions became 
available. When taken to high altitudes by balloons, they produced 
the first beautiful images of the interactions of cosmic rays.
These emulsions were especially sensitive to high-energy particles; 
just as intense light darkens photographic plates, so can the passage 
of charged particles. We can detect the path of a single particle by 
the line of dark specks that it forms on the developed emulsion. The 
particle literally takes its own photograph. A set of emulsion-covered 
plates is sufficient to collect particle tracks; a cloud chamber, on 
the other hand, is a complex piece of apparatus, needing moving 
parts so that the chamber can be continually expanded and 
recompressed. As a result, emulsions became a useful way of 
detecting and recording the trails of charged particles.
Bubble chamber
The advent of accelerators produced high-energy particles, which 
created new challenges for detection. Energetic particles fly Detectors: cameras and time machines
67
through a cloud chamber without interacting with the atoms in 
the chamber’s thin gas. For example, to record the whole life of a 
strange particle, from production to decay, at energies of a few 
GeV would have required a cloud chamber 100 metres long! In 
addition, cloud chambers are slow: the cycle of recompression 
after an expansion can take up to a minute; by the 1950s, particle 
accelerators were delivering pulses of protons every two seconds.
What was needed was a detector that would capture the long 
tracks of high-energy particles and operate quickly. Gases were 
much too tenuous for the job whereas liquids were better, because 
their much greater density means they contain far more nuclei 
with which the high-energy particles can interact. This brings us 
to the bubble chamber. The basic idea develops from what 
happens when you keep a liquid under pressure, very close to its 
boiling point. If you lower the pressure in these circumstances, the 
liquid begins to boil, but if you lower the pressure very suddenly, 
the liquid will remain liquid even though it is now above its 
boiling point. This state is known as ‘superheated liquid’ and 
because it is unstable, it can be maintained only so long as no 
disturbance occurs in the liquid.
Release the pressure and then immediately restore it. Particles 
entering the liquid during the critical moments of low pressure 
create a disturbance and trigger the boiling process as they ionize 
the atoms of the liquid along their paths. For a fraction of a 
second, a trail of bubbles forms where a particle has passed, which 
can be photographed. The immediate restoration of pressure 
would mean that the liquid was once again just below boiling 
point, and the whole process could be repeated quite rapidly.
The operation of a bubble chamber was always intimately tied to 
the operating cycle of the accelerator that fed it. The particles 
entered the chamber when the piston was fully withdrawn, the 
pressure at its minimum, and the liquid superheated. Then, about 
1 millisecond later, an arc light flashed, illuminating the trails of Particle Physics
68
bubbles formed by charged particles. The delay between 
minimum pressure and the flash allowed the bubbles to grow 
large enough to show up on the photographs. Meanwhile, the 
piston moved back in towards the chamber, increasing the 
pressure again, and the film in the cameras was automatically 
wound on to the next frame. It then took about a second for the 
chamber to ‘recover’ and be ready for the next expansion. Thus the 
bubble chamber shows where the particles have been, enabling 
their behaviour to be studied at leisure.
In a magnetic field, a charged particle’s trajectory will curve, the 
direction revealing whether the particle was positively or 
negatively charged, and the radius of the curve revealing its 
momentum. So we can deduce the charge and momentum; if you 
know a particle’s momentum and velocity, you can calculate its 
mass and hence its identity.
One method of pinpointing the velocity used two scintillation 
‘counters’, which produced a flash of light each time a charged 
particle passed through. Each tiny burst of light was converted to 
a pulse of electricity, which was then amplified to produce a signal. 
In this way, two or more scintillation counters could reveal the 
flightpath of a particle as it produced flashes in each counter, and 
from the time taken to travel between the two counters, the 
particle’s speed could be determined.
However, such techniques did not help solve the identification 
puzzle in the case of a bubble chamber picture. Often the only way 
was to assign identities to the different tracks, and then to add up 
the energy and momentum of all the particles emerging from an 
interaction. If they did not balance the known values before the 
interaction, the assumed identities must be wrong, and others 
must be tested, until finally a consistent picture was found. This 
was time consuming, but the state of the art around 1960. 
Identifying particles through such trial-and-error calculations is 
the kind of repetitive job at which computers excel, and today Detectors: cameras and time machines

15. Subatomic particles viewed in the bubble chamber at CERN. Cosmic 
rays provided physicists with the first glimpses of new subatomic 
particles, which were later studied in detail in experiments at particle 
accelerators. Positrons, muons, pions, and kaons all figure in this 
photograph from the 2 m bubble chamber at the CERN laboratory.Particle Physics
70
bubble chambers have been superseded by electronic detectors 
that lend themselves better to computer analysis.
From bubble chamber to spark chamber
A bubble chamber could provide a complete picture of an 
interaction, but it had many limitations. It is sensitive only when 
its contents are in the superheated state, after the rapid expansion. 
Particles must enter the chamber in this crucial period of a few 
milliseconds, before the pressure is reapplied to ‘freeze’ the 
bubble growth.
To study large numbers of rare interactions required a more 
selective technique. In the 1960s, the spark chamber proved the 
ideal compromise.
The basic spark chamber consists of parallel sheets of metal 
separated by a few millimetres and immersed in an inert (less 
reactive) gas such as neon. When a charged particle passes 
through the chamber it leaves an ionized trail in the gas, just as in 
a cloud chamber. Once the particle has passed through, you apply 
a high voltage to alternate plates in the spark chamber. Under the 
stress of the electric field, sparks form along the ionized trails. The 
process is like lightning in an electric storm. The trails of sparks 
can be photographed, or their positions can even be recorded by 
timing the arrival of the accompanying crackles at electronic 
microphones. Either way, a picture of particle tracks can be built 
up for subsequent computer analysis.
The beauty of the spark chamber is that it has a ‘memory’ and can 
be triggered. Scintillation counters outside the chamber, which 
respond quickly, can be used to pinpoint charged particles passing 
through the chamber. Provided all this happens within a tenth of a 
microsecond, the ions in the spark chamber’s gaps will still be 
there, and the high-voltage pulse will reveal the tracks.71
16. An image of one of the first observations of the W particle—the charged carrier of the weak force—captured in the 
UA1 detector at CERN in 1982. UA1 detected the head-on collisions of protons and antiprotons, which in this view came 
from the left and right to collide at the centre of the detector. The computer display shows the central part of the 
apparatus, which revealed the tracks of charged particles throughout the ionization picked up by thousands of wires. Each 
dot in the image corresponds to a wire that registered a pulse of ionization. As many as 65 tracks have been produced, only 
one of which reveals the decay of a W particle created fleetingly in the proton-antiproton collision. The white track 
(arrowed) is due to a high-energy electron. Adding together the energies of all the other particles reveals that a relatively 
large amount of energy had disappeared in the direction opposite to the electron, presumably spirited away by an invisible 
neutrino. Together, the neutrino and electron carry energy equivalent to the mass of the short-lived W particle.Particle Physics
72
Subdivide the plates of the spark chamber into sheets of parallel 
wires, a millimetre or so apart. The pulse of current associated 
with each spark is sensed only by the wire or two nearest to the 
spark, and so by recording which wires sensed the sparks you 
know to within a millimetre where the particle has passed. Notice 
how this enables the wire spark chamber to produce information 
ready for a computer to digest with little further processing.
Wire spark chambers could be operated up to 1,000 times faster 
than most bubble chambers and fitted in particularly well with the 
computer techniques for recording data that were developed in 
the 1960s. Signals from many detectors—scintillation counters, 
wire chambers—could be fed into a small ‘online’ computer, which 
would not only record the data on magnetic tape for further 
analysis ‘offline’, but could also feed back information to the 
physicists while the experiment was in progress. Sets of chambers 
with wires running in three different directions provided enough 
information to build up a three-dimensional picture of the particle 
tracks. And the computer could calculate the energy and 
momentum of the particles and check their identification.
In the 1960s, spark chambers allowed the rapid collection of 
data on specific interactions; bubble chambers, on the other 
hand, gave a far more complete picture of events, including the 
point of interaction, or ‘vertex’. The ‘electronic’ and ‘visual’ 
detectors were complementary, and together they proved a happy 
hunting ground for the seekers of previously unknown particles. 
Today working spark chambers are mostly found in science 
museums and educational establishments to make visible, in 
particular, the passage of cosmic rays.
Electronic bubble chambers
By the late 20th century, the number of interactions at particle 
accelerators had become huge compared with those in the days of 
bubble chambers and even early spark chambers. Developments Detectors: cameras and time machines
73
included the multiwire proportional chamber and the drift 
chamber, which work much faster and more precisely than wire 
spark chambers.
A multiwire proportional chamber is superficially rather similar to 
a spark chamber, being a sandwich of three planes of parallel 
wires fitted into a gas-filled structure, but differs in that the 
central plane of wires is held continuously at some 5,000 volts 
electrical potential relative to the two outer planes. Charged 
particles then trigger an avalanche of ionization electrons when 
they pass through the gas. A chamber with wires only 1–2 mm 
apart produces a signal within a few hundredths of a microsecond 
after a particle has passed by, and can handle as many as a million 
particles per second passing each wire—a thousand-fold 
improvement on the spark chamber.
The downside is that to track particles across a large volume, of a 
cubic metre say, requires a vast number of wires, each with 
electronics to amplify the signals. Furthermore, it has limited 
precision. These problems were overcome with the ‘drift chamber’, 
whose basic idea is to measure time—which can be done very 
precisely with modern electronics—to reveal distance. The 
chamber again consists of parallel wires strung across a volume of 
gas, but some of the wires provide electric fields that in effect 
divide a large volume into smaller units, or ‘cells’. Each cell acts 
like an individual detector, in which the electric field directs the 
ionization electrons from a charged particle’s track towards a 
central ‘sense’ wire. The time it takes for electrons to reach this 
wire gives a good measure of the distance of the track from the 
sense wire. This technique can locate particle tracks to an 
accuracy of some 50 microns (millionths of a metre).
Silicon microscopes
Several strange particles live for about 10–10 seconds, during which 
brief span they may be travelling near the speed of light and cover Particle Physics
74
a few millimetres. Over such distances they leave measurable 
trails. Particles containing charmed or bottom quarks live typically 
for no more than 10–13 s, and may travel only 300 micrometres. 
To see them one must ensure that the part of the detector closest to 
the collision point has as high a resolution as possible. Nowadays, 
almost every experiment has a silicon ‘vertex’ detector, which can 
reveal the short kinks where tracks diverge as short-lived particles 
decay to those with longer lifetimes. The ATLAS and CMS 
detectors at the Large Hadron Collider, for example, each have 
over 100 square metres of silicon detectors.
When a charged particle passes through the silicon it ionizes the 
atoms, liberating electrons, which can then conduct electricity. 
The most common technique with silicon is to divide its surface 
during fabrication into fine parallel strips spaced some 20 microns 
(millionths of a metre) apart, yielding a precision on measuring 
particle tracks of better than 10 microns.
Silicon strip detectors have come into their own at colliders, 
providing high-resolution ‘microscopes’ to see back into the beam 
pipe, where the decay vertices of particles can occur close to the 
collision point. They have proved particularly important in 
identifying B particles, which contain the heavy bottom quark. 
The bottom quarks prefer to decay to charm quarks, which in turn 
like to decay to strange quarks. Particles containing either of these 
quarks decay within 10–12 s, and travel only a few millimetres, even 
when created at the highest energy machines. Yet the silicon 
‘microscopes’ constructed at the heart of detectors can often 
pinpoint the sequence of decays, from bottom to charm to strange 
particles. At the Tevatron at Fermilab, the ability to ‘see’ bottom 
particles in this way was critical in the discovery of the long-sought 
top quark, which likes to decay to a bottom quark. The LHCb 
experiment at the LHC relies on this technology to isolate the 
decay vertices of bottom particles.Detectors: cameras and time machines

Detecting neutrinos
Any individual neutrino may be very unlikely to interact with 
matter in a detector, but with enough neutrinos, and large 
detectors, a few may be caught. The basic idea to detect those rare 
ones is to exploit their tendency to turn into an electrically 
charged lepton, such as an electron, when they make a hit, and the 
electron, being charged, is easy to detect. This is how we have 
learned a lot about the neutrinos that stream down on us every 
second from the Sun.
When light passes through material, such as water, it travels 
slower than when in free space. So although nothing can travel 
faster than light in a vacuum, it is possible to travel faster than 
light does through a material. When a particle moves through a 
substance faster than light does, it can create a kind of shock wave 
of visible light, known as Cerenkov radiation. The Cerenkov 
radiation emerges at an angle to the particle’s path, and the 
greater the particle’s velocity, the larger this angle becomes. 
The SuperKamiokande experiment detects neutrinos when they 
interact in water to make either an electron or a muon, depending 
on the neutrino’s type. These particles, unlike the neutrino, are 
electrically charged and, moving faster than light through the 
water, can emit Cerenkov radiation. By carefully analysing the 
patterns of light, one can distinguish between muons and 
electrons created in the detector, and hence between muon- and 
electron-neutrinos.
The Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) was active until 2006. 
It was 2,070 metres below ground in a nickel mine in Sudbury, 
Ontario. Its heart was an acrylic vessel filled with 1,000 tonnes of 
‘heavy water’, called deuterium, in which a neutron joins the single 
proton of ordinary hydrogen. In SNO, electron-neutrinos interact 
with the neutrons in the deuterium to create protons and Particle Physics
76
electrons, and the fast-moving electrons emit cones of Cerenkov 
radiation as they travel through the heavy water. The Cerenkov 
light forms patterns of rings on the inner surface of the water 
tank, where it is picked up by thousands of phototubes arrayed 
around the walls.
However, the key feature of SNO was that it could also detect all 
three types of neutrinos (see Chapter 8) through a reaction unique 
to deuterium. A neutrino of any kind can split the deuterium 
nucleus, freeing the neutron, which can be captured by another 
nucleus. The capture is detected when the newly bloated nucleus 
gets rid of its excess energy by emitting gamma rays, which in turn 
make electrons and positrons that create characteristic patterns of 
Cerenkov light in the surrounding water.
By such experiments it proved possible to count the neutrinos 
from the Sun. They confirmed that the Sun is indeed a nuclear 
fusion engine. That this is how stars, such as the Sun, burn had 
long been suspected, but it was finally proved in 2002.
Detectors at colliders
Electronic detectors have produced their most spectacular results 
in an environment that is inaccessible to bubble chambers: at 
colliding-beam machines where particles meet head on within the 
beam pipe.
These individual pieces are today combined in cylindrical detectors 
that surround the interaction point at a collider accelerator. The 
collision happens on the central axis of the detector. As the debris 
streams out, it encounters a series of different pieces of detector, 
each with its own speciality in recognizing particles.
At the Large Hadron Collider bunches of particles pass through 
each other 40 million times a second, and each time they cross 
there are over 50 collisions, making more than a billion collisions Detectors: cameras and time machines
77
per second in all. The ensuing data collection rate demanded of 
the detectors is equivalent to the information processing for 
20 simultaneous telephone conversations by every man, woman, 
and child on Earth.
Huge detectors are housed at the collision points. CMS (Compact 
Muon Solenoid) and ATLAS (A Toroidal LHC ApparatuS) are 
exploring the new energy region looking for all kinds of new 
effects—both expected and unexpected. The ATLAS detector is 
5 storeys high (20 m) and yet able to measure particle tracks to a 
precision of 0.01 mm.
CMS and ATLAS each follow the time-honoured structure for 
modern particle detectors. First comes the logically named ‘inner 
tracker’, which records the positions of electrically charged 
particles to an accuracy of about one-hundredth of a millimetre, 
enabling computers to reconstruct their tracks as they curve in the 
intense magnetic fields. The next layer is a two-part calorimeter, 
designed to capture all the energy of many types of particle. The 
inner part is the electromagnetic calorimeter, which traps and 
records the energies of electrons, positrons, and photons.
High-quality lead glass, like the crystal of cut-glass tableware, is 
often used as a detector because the lead in the glass makes 
electrons and positrons radiate photons and also causes photons 
to convert into electron-positron pairs. The net effect is a 
miniature avalanche of electrons, positrons, and photons, which 
proceeds until all the energy of the original particle has been 
dissipated. The electrons and positrons travel faster in the glass 
than light does, and emit Cerenkov light, which is picked up by 
light-sensitive phototubes. The amount of light collected bears 
testimony to the energy of the original particle that entered 
the block.
Thousands of tonnes of iron are interleaved with gas-filled tubes 
to pick up protons, pions, and other hadrons—particles built from Particle Physics
78
quarks. This is the ‘hadron calorimeter’, so called because it 
measures the energy of hadrons, just as calorimeters in other 
branches of science measure heat energy. The iron in the 
calorimeter has a dual purpose: as well as slowing down and 
trapping the hadrons, it forms part of the electromagnet used to 
bend the paths of charged particles, revealing their charge and 
helping to identify them.
An outermost layer consists of special muon chambers, which 
track muons, the only electrically charged particles that can 
penetrate this far. The set of detector components form a hermetic 
system designed to trap as many particles as possible as they 
emerge from the collisions at the centre. In principle, only the 
elusive neutrinos could escape completely, leaving no trace at all 
in any of the detector components. Yet even the neutrinos left a 
‘calling card’, for they escaped with energy and momentum, both 
of which must be conserved in any interaction.
This entire detector is designed to record the debris from 
collisions that occur a billion times each second. This is a far cry 
from the early days of cloud chambers, which could record only 
once a minute, or even bubble chambers at once a second. 
Among the debris produced in these collisions, at energies 
exceeding anything ever measured at an existing particle 
accelerator, the jewel will be some unexpected phenomenon. 
The major discovery announced in July 2012 has been the 
Higgs boson (Chapters 7 and 10). This particle, with a mass of 
125 GeV, is produced on average only once in every 20 million 
million collisions. This means that with up to a billion collisions 
each second, a Higgs boson has appeared about once a day in 
each experiment at the LHC, though with improvements in the 
intensity of the LHC beams this rate will be higher in future. It has 
been suggested that finding a needle in a haystack is easier than Detectors: cameras and time machines

sighting the one Higgs in every hundred thousand billion other 
events. A challenge for computation has been to recognize the 
Higgs and record only selected data onto magnetic tape.
This all illustrates how our ability to learn about the origins and 
nature of matter have depended upon advances on two fronts: 
the construction of ever more powerful accelerators, and the 
development of sophisticated means of recording the collisions.82
Chapter 7
The forces of Nature
Four fundamental forces rule the universe: gravity, the 
electromagnetic force and then two that act in and around the 
atomic nucleus, known as strong and weak. The latter pair act 
over distances smaller than atoms and so are less familiar to our 
macroscopic senses than are the effects of gravity and magnets. 
However, they are critical to our existence, keeping the Sun 
burning and providing the essential warmth for life.
Gravity is the most familiar to us. Between individual atoms or 
their constituent particles, the effects of gravity are nugatory. 
The strength of gravity between individual particles is exceedingly 
small, so small that in particle physics experiments we safely 
ignore it. It is because gravity attracts everything to everything 
else that its effects add up until they are powerful, acting over 
cosmic distances.
Electric forces operate on the familiar maxim ‘like charges repel; 
unlike charges attract’. Thus, negatively charged electrons are held 
in their paths in atoms by the electrical attraction to the positively 
charged central nucleus.
Charges in motion give rise to magnetic effects. The north and 
south poles of a bar magnet are an effect of the electrical motions 
of atoms acting in concert.The forces of Nature
83
The electromagnetic force is intrinsically much more powerful 
than gravity; however, the competition between attractions and 
repulsions neuter its effects over large distances, leaving gravity as 
the dominant effect at large. However, the effects of swirling 
electric charges in the molten core of the Earth cause magnetic 
fields to leak into space. A compass needle will point to the North 
Pole, which may be thousands of miles distant, due to such effects.
It is the electromagnetic force that holds atoms and molecules 
together, making bulk matter. You and I and everything are held 
together by the electromagnetic force. When the apple fell from a 
tree in front of Isaac Newton, it was gravity that guided it; but it 
was the electromagnetic force—responsible for making the solid 
ground—that stopped it continuing down to the centre of the 
Earth. An apple may fall for many seconds from a great height, 
accelerated by the force of gravity. But when it hits the floor, it is 
stopped and turned to pulp in an instant: that is the 
electromagnetic force at work.
Here is an idea of the relative strengths of the two forces. In a 
hydrogen atom are a negatively charged electron and a positively 
charged proton. They mutually attract by their gravity; they also 
feel the attraction of opposite electrical charges. The latter is 1040
times stronger than their mutual gravity. To give an idea of how 
huge this is, consider the radius of the visible universe: it has been 
expanding at a fraction of the speed of light, about 1016 metres per 
year, for some 1010 years since the Big Bang, so the whole universe 
is at most 1025 metres in extent. The diameter of a single proton is 
about 10–15 metres. So 1040 is even bigger than the size of the 
universe compared to the size of a single proton. Clearly we can 
safely ignore gravity for individual particles at present energies.
The attraction of opposites holds the electrons in atomic paths 
around the positively charged nucleus, but the repulsion of like 
charges creates a paradox for the existence of the nucleus itself. 
The nucleus is compact, its positive electrical charge due to the Particle Physics
84
many positively charged protons within it. How can these protons, 
suffering such intense electrical repulsion, manage to survive?
The fact that they do gives an immediate clue to the existence of a 
‘strong’ attractive force, felt by protons and neutrons, which is 
powerful enough to hold them in place and resist the electrical 
disruption. This strong force is one of a pair that act in and 
around the atomic nucleus. Known as the strong and weak, their 
names referring to their respective strengths relative to that of the 
electromagnetic force on the nuclear scale, they are short-range 
forces, not immediately familiar to our gross senses, but essential 
for our existence.
The stability of the nuclei of atomic elements can be a delicate 
balance between the competing strong attraction and electrical 
repulsion. You cannot put too many protons together or the 
electrical disruption will make the nucleus unstable. This can be 
the source of certain radioactive decays, where a nucleus will split 
into smaller fragments. Neutrons and protons feel the strong force 
equally; only the protons feel the electrical repulsion. This is why 
the nuclei of all elements other than hydrogen contain not just 
protons, but have neutrons to add to the strong attractive stability 
of the whole. For example, uranium 235 is so called because it has 
92 protons (which define it as uranium due to the 92 electrons 
that will neutralize the atom) and 143 neutrons, making a total of 
235 protons and neutrons in all.
At this point you might wonder why nuclei favour any protons at 
all, as an excess of neutrons doesn’t seem to lead to instability. The 
answer depends in detail on quantum mechanical effects that are 
beyond the scope of this book, but a major part is due to the extra 
mass of a neutron relative to a proton. As we saw earlier, this 
underlies an intrinsic instability of neutrons, whereby they can 
decay, turning into protons and ejecting an electron—the so-called 
‘beta’ particle of ‘beta radioactivity’.The forces of Nature
85
The force that destroys a neutron is the weak force, so called 
because it appears weak by comparison to the electromagnetic 
and strong at room temperatures. The weak force disrupts 
neutrons and protons, causing the nucleus of one atomic element 
to transmute into another through beta radioactivity. It plays an 
important role in helping convert the protons—the seeds of the 
hydrogen fuel of the Sun—into helium (the process by which 
energy is released, eventually emerging as sunshine).
The gravitational attractions among the multitudinous protons in 
the Sun pull them inwards until they are nearly touching. 
Occasionally two move fast enough to overcome their electrical 
repulsion momentarily, and they bump into one another. The 
weak force transmutes a proton into a neutron, the strong force 
then clumps these neutrons with protons, after which they build 
up a nucleus of helium. Energy is released and radiated courtesy of 
the electromagnetic force. It is the presence of these four forces 
and their different characters and strengths that keep the Sun 
burning at just the right rate for us to be here.
In ordinary matter, the strong force acts only in the nucleus and 
fundamentally it is due to the presence of the quarks, the ultimate 
basic particles from which protons and neutrons are formed. 
As the electric and magnetic forces are effects arising from electric 
charges, so is the strong force ultimately due to a new variety of 
charge, which is carried by quarks but not by leptons. Hence 
leptons, such as the electron, are blind to the strong force; 
conversely, particles such as protons and neutrons that are made 
of quarks do feel the strong force.
The laws governing this are fundamentally similar to those for the 
electromagnetic force. Quarks carry the new charge in what we 
can define to be the positive form, and so antiquarks will carry the 
same amount but with negative charge. The attraction of 
opposites then brings a quark and an antiquark together: hence Particle Physics
86
the qq� bound states that we call mesons. But how are baryons, 
which are made of three quarks, formed?
It turns out that there are three distinct varieties of the strong 
charge, and to distinguish among them we call them red (R), blue 
(B), and green (G). As such they have become known as colour 
charges, though this has nothing to do with colour in its familiar 
sense—it is just a name. As unlike colours attract, and like repel, 
so would two quarks each carrying a red colour charge, say, 
mutually repel. However, a red and a green would attract, as 
would three different colours, RBG. Bring a fourth quark near 
such a trio and it will be attracted to two and repelled by the third 
which carries the same colour charge. The repulsion turns out to 
balance the net attraction such that the fourth quark is in some 
sort of limbo; however, should it find two other quarks, carrying 
each of the two other colour charges, then this trio can also tightly 
bind together. Thus we begin to see the attractions of trios, as 
when forming protons and neutrons, is due to the threefold nature 
of colour charges. As the presence of electric charges within atoms 
leads to them clustering together to make molecules, so do the 
colour charges within protons and neutrons lead to the clusters 
that we know as nuclei.
The underlying similarity in the rules of attraction and repulsion 
give similar behaviour to the electromagnetic and strong forces at 
distances much less than the size of an individual proton or 
neutron; however, the threefold richness that positive or negative 
colour charges have in comparison with their singleton electric 
counterparts leads to a different behaviour in these forces at larger 
distances. The colour-generated forces saturate at distances of 
around 10–15 metres, the typical size of a proton or neutron, and 
are very powerful, but only so long as the two particles encroach to 
within this distance—figuratively ‘touch’ one another—hence the 
colour-induced forces act only over nuclear dimensions. The 
electromagnetic force, in contrast, acts over atomic dimensions 
of some 10–10 metres when building stable atoms, and can even The forces of Nature
87
be felt over macroscopic distances, as in the magnetic fields 
surrounding the Earth.
This brings us naturally to the question of how forces spread their 
effects across space.

manage to ensnare an electron that is 10–10 metres away, thereby 
forming an atom of hydrogen? Quantum theory implies that it is 
by the action of intermediate agents—the exchange of particles; in 
the case of the electromagnetic force these are photons, quantum 
bundles of electromagnetic radiation, such as light.
Electric charges can emit or absorb electromagnetic radiation, and 
its agents, photons; analogously the colour charges also can emit 
and absorb a radiation, whose agents are known as gluons. It is 
these gluons that ‘glue’ the quarks to one another to make protons, 
neutrons, and atomic nuclei. The weak force analogously involves 
force carriers known as W or Z bosons.
The photon, W and Z bosons, and the gluons are known as ‘gauge 
bosons’—particle physics’ jargon for carriers of fundamental forces 
which are described by a common mathematical structure known 
as ‘gauge theory’. Gauge bosons carry one unit of spin, making 
them ‘vector’ particles. (The Higgs boson is not a ‘gauge boson’; it 
has no spin, uniquely so among the known fundamental particles.)
The W boson differs from the photon in two important ways: it 
has electric charge and a large mass. Its electric charge causes its 
emission to leak charge away from the source—thus a neutral 
neutron turns into a positively charged proton when a WΩ is 
emitted; this is the source of neutron beta decay, the WΩ turning 
into an electron and anti-neutrino. The W mass is some 80 times 
greater than that of a proton or neutron. If you were in a car 
weighing one tonne and suddenly 80 tonnes were ejected, you 
would complain that something was wrong! But in the quantum 
world this kind of thing can happen. However, this violation of 
energy balance is ephemeral, limited in time such that the 
product of the imbalance, Delta-E (ΔE), and the time it can last, 
Delta-t (Δt), cannot exceed Planck’s quantum h, or numerically 
ΔE× Δt < 6 × 10Ω25 GeV-seconds. This restriction is one form of the 
‘Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle’.The forces of Nature
89
This means that for one second you could overdraw the energy 
account, or ‘borrow’, the trifling amount of 10–25 GeV. ‘Borrowing’ 
80 GeV (the minimum energy to make a single W) can occur for 
some 10–24 s, during which time not even light could travel more 
than about one tenth of the distance across a proton. Hence the 
distance over which the W can transmit the force is considerably 
less than the size of a single proton. So the short-range nature of 
the weak force is due to the excessively large mass of its carrier 
particle. Now, this is not a statement that the force exists up to a 
certain point and then turns off suddenly; instead it dies away, 
and its strength falls away radically by distances of the order of a 
proton size. It is at such distances where beta decay is manifested, 
and it is thus that the force became known as ‘weak’.
In 1865 James Clerk Maxwell had successfully unified the 
disparate phenomena of electricity and magnetism into what we 
today call electromagnetism. A century later, Glashow, Salam, and 
Weinberg united the electromagnetic force and the weak force 
into what has become known as electroweak theory. This 
explained the apparent weakness of the ‘weak’ component of this 
unified force as being due to the large mass of the W, whereas the 
photon of the electromagnetic force is massless. Their theory 
implied that in addition to the electrically charged W+ and WΩ, 
there was a heavy neutral partner, the Zo
, with a mass around 90 
GeV. One implication of their work was that if one could provide 
enough energy, of the order of 100 GeV or more, whereby the W 
or Z could be produced directly in the laboratory, one would see 
that the force has a strength akin to that of the electromagnetic, 
and is not excessively weak after all. Such experiments have been 
done and confirmed this phenomenon.
The W and Z were discovered at CERN in 1983–4, where they 
were fleetingly produced among the debris arising from the 
high-energy, head-on collisions between protons and antiprotons. 
Such collisions produce large numbers of pions, and only rarely is Particle Physics
90
a single W or Z produced. This led to a dedicated accelerator, LEP, 
where counter-rotating beams of electrons and positrons were 
mutually annihilated, tuned to a total energy of 90 GeV. This 
energy matches that of a Z at rest, and so LEP was able to produce 
Z particles cleanly. During a decade of experiments, over 
10 million examples of Z were made and studied. These experiments 
proved that the concept of the merging of electromagnetic and 
weak forces into a single electroweak force is a correct one. It is 
the large masses of the W and Z that gave the apparent weakness 
when they were involved in historical experiments, at energies far 
below 100 GeV, such as in beta radioactivity.

Examples of entities that have special affinity for the various forces are

91
Finally we have the strong force, whose origins are the colour 
charges carried by quarks or antiquarks. In this case the force is 
transmitted by ‘gluons’. As a quark can have any of three colours, 
labelled R, B, or G, the gluon radiated can itself carry colour 
charge. For example, a quark with charge R can end up carrying 
colour B if the gluon carries a charge that is like ‘positive R, 
negative B’. The relativistic quantum theory, known as quantum 
chromodynamics, or QCD, allows for a total of eight different 
colours of gluons.
As gluons carry colour charge, they can mutually attract and 
repel as they travel across space. This is unlike the case for 
photons when transmitting the electromagnetic force. Photons 
do not themselves carry (electric) charge, and so do not 
mutually suffer electromagnetic forces. Photons can voyage 
across space independently, filling all the volume, the 
intensity of the resulting force dying out as the square of the 
distance—the famous ‘inverse square law’ of electrostatics. 
Gluons, carrying colour charges, do not fill space in the same 
way as photons do. Their mutual interactions cause the ensuing 
force to be concentrated in a line, along the axis connecting the 
two coloured quarks.
So while photons fill space and travel independently, the gluons 
cluster. One consequence of this clustering is the possibility that 
gluons mutually attract to form short-lived composite states known 
as glueballs. It is this mutual affinity amongst gluons while they are 
transmitting the force that causes the long-range behaviours of the 
electromagnetic and colour (strong) force to differ radically. The 
electromagnetic force dies with the inverse square of the distance; 
the colour forces do not. The energy required to pull two colour 
sources, such as quarks, apart grows with distance. At a separation 
of around 10–15 metres this energy tends to become infinite. Thus 
individual quarks cannot be separated from their siblings; they 
remain clustered in the trios, such as baryons, or quark and Particle Physics
92
antiquark, as in mesons. It is thus that the effects of colour charges 
become ‘strong’ at large distances.
At short distances, as are probed in experiments at high energy, 
the electroweak and colour forces appear to act as if exhibiting a 
grand unity. As electrically charged particles can radiate photons, 
so can coloured quarks radiate gluons. This has been seen in 
‘3-jet events’ at LEP, as illustrated in Figure 23. It is at lower 
energies, such as were the norm until the latter part of the 
20th century, that they exhibit their different characters: the 
massive W and Z causing an apparent weakness; the mutual 
23. Here we see the result of electron and positron annihilation where 
three jets of particles have emerged. First a quark and an antiquark 
were produced, and almost immediately one of these radiated a gluon. 
The quark, antiquark, and gluon are the sources of the three jets of

interactions among the gluons causing the colour force by 
contrast to take on great strength.
That much we know. Extrapolate the effects of the colour forces, 
and of the weak and electromagnetic to extreme energies, far 
beyond what we can measure in the lab, and it appears that all 
three become alike. The behaviour of atomic particles at very high 
energies, akin to those that were abundant just after the Big Bang, 
suggests that the colour forces are enfeebled, and similar in 
strength to the familiar electromagnetic force. A tantalizing hint 
of unity has emerged. This is known as grand unification of the 
forces. It suggests that there is an underlying simplicity, unity, to 
Nature and that we have only glimpsed a cold asymmetric 
remnant of it so far. Whether this is really true is for future 
experiments to test.
The mathematical structures underpinning the ‘gauge theories’ 
that describe electromagnetic, weak, and strong—colour—forces 
can be generalized straightforwardly, but there is no evidence that 
Nature makes use of this. There could be further forces, mediated 
by very massive gauge bosons and too feeble to discern in present 
experiments. The properties of the muon—a seemingly more 
massive version of the electron (see Chapter 8)—give hints that 
this might be the case, but this remains highly speculative.
Higgs boson
Even if space were to be emptied completely of matter and all 
known sources of energy, it would still be filled by a ghostlike field 
that cannot be shut down. Immersed in this essence forever, we 
have nonetheless been unaware of it until its existence was 
established in July 2012 with discovery at CERN’s Large Hadron 
Collider of the Higgs boson. As excitation of an electromagnetic 
field produces photons, so can excitation of this ‘Higgs field’ 
produce Higgs bosons.Particle Physics
94
Though the Higgs field is not a sibling to the electromagnetic, 
weak, and strong fields, where forces are transmitted by spin-1, 
gauge bosons, it is nonetheless fundamental to the formation of 
structure from the chaotic debris of the Big Bang. A small 
amount of energy can excite millions of photons, but it takes 
125 GeV focused into a tiny volume to excite even one Higgs 
boson. Whereas the electromagnetic and other fields have a 
sense of direction—they are vector fields—the Higgs field has 
none: the Higgs boson has no spin; it is a fundamental scalar 
boson—the only such example yet known.
But for the presence of this field, the fundamental particles would 
race through space at the speed of light, without any possibility of 
being caught in atoms or molecules. Their interaction with the 
field gives them mass. The mass of the W boson enfeebles the 
‘weak’ force such that the conversion of hydrogen to helium in the 
Sun takes place very slowly. This has enabled the Sun to last 
5 billion years, long enough for evolution to have occurred here on 
Earth. So, although the Higgs boson and the associated field 
might appear arcane, they are essential to our existence.95

Exotic matter (and 
antimatter)
Strangeness
We have met the basic particles from which matter on Earth is 
ultimately made. However, in Nature’s scheme, there is more than 
this. Cosmic rays from outer space are continuously hitting us. 
These consist of the nuclei of elements produced in stars and 
catastrophic events elsewhere in the cosmos; they hurl through 
space and some, channelled by the magnetic fields of the Earth, 
hit the upper atmosphere and produce showers of secondary 
particles. In the 1940s and 1950s, cosmic rays provided an active 
source of discovery of forms of matter that had not hitherto been 
known on Earth. Some of these had unusual properties and 
became known as ‘strange’ particles. Today we know what 
distinguishes them from the familiar protons, neutrons, and 
pions: they contain a new variety of quark, which has become 
known as the strange quark.
There are strange baryons and strange mesons. A strange baryon 
consists of three quarks, at least one of which is a strange quark; 
the greater the number of strange quarks the baryon contains, the 
greater is the magnitude of its ‘strangeness’. A meson consists of a 
quark and an antiquark and so, by analogy, a strange meson is one 
that contains either a strange quark or a strange antiquark. The 
discovery of strange particles preceded by several years the Particle Physics
96
discovery that baryons and mesons are made of quarks. The 
properties of the variety of strange particles led theorists to invent 
the concept of strangeness, which acted in many ways like charge: 
strangeness is conserved when the strong force acts on particles. 
Thus one could explain which processes were favoured or 
disfavoured by computing how much strangeness each of the 
participating particles carried. Various mesons were determined 
to carry strangeness of amount +1 or –1. Strange baryons were 
found by this scheme to carry amounts –1, –2, or –3. Today we 
understand what determines this. The amount of negative
strangeness that a particle carries corresponds to the number of 
strange quarks within it. It might seem more natural to have 
defined strangeness such that each strange quark carried one unit 
of positive strangeness, and had we known of quarks before the 
idea of strangeness, that is probably how it would have been. But 
we are stuck with this accident of history whereby the number of 
strange quarks accounts for negative strangeness and the number 
of strange antiquarks accounts for positive strangeness. (A similar 
accident of history gave us a negative charge for the electron.)
A strange quark is electrically charged, carrying an amount –1/3, 
as does the down quark. It is more massive than a down quark, 
having an mc2
 of ~150 MeV. In all other respects the strange and 
down quarks appear to be the same. Due to the extra mass of the 
strange quark relative to an up or down quark, every time one of 
these in the proton or neutron, say, is replaced by a strange quark 
the resulting strange baryon is roughly 150 MeV more massive 
per unit of (negative) strangeness.
The baryons that are like the proton and neutron, and have spin 
1/2, are listed in Figure 24a along with their quark content, 
electric charge, strangeness, and magnitude of mass (or mc2
 in 
MeV). The rule is not exact, but it is at least qualitatively true (the 
actual masses, as was the case for the proton and neutron, depend 
also on the different electrical forces among the constituents and 
the fact that their sizes, while approximately 10–15 m, are not all Exotic matter (and antimatter)
97
identical, due to the complicated nature of the forces acting on 
them). The rule is more precisely verified in the set of strange 
baryons with spin 3/2 that partner the Δ resonance, as seen in 
Figure 24b.
There are mesons with strangeness +1, such as the + K us ( ) or 
( ) o K ds , and –1, such as − K su ( ) or ( ) o K sd , with masses mc2
~500 MeV. There are also mesons which contain both strange 
quark and antiquark, so that there is no net strangeness. This ss
combination leads to a third electrically neutral meson, known as 
the eta-prime, ηʹ, in addition to the πo
 and η that we met in 
Chapter 4.

These mesons made of a quark and antiquark have a total spin of 
zero. There is also a set where the quark and antiquark spins 
combine to a total of one. The strange members in this case are 
known respectively as + K us ∗ ( ) , ∗ ( ) o K ds , − K su ∗ ( ) , and 
∗ ( ) o K sd ; the analogues of the π, η, and ηʹ are known as ρ, ω, 
and ϕ (rho, omega, and phi).
Charm
Not only does the down quark have its heavier cousin, the strange 
quark, but so does the up quark have a heavier version: the charm
quark. A charm quark is electrically charged, carrying an amount 
+2/3, as does the up quark. It is more massive than the up quark, 
having an mc2
 of ~1500 MeV. In all other respects the charm and 
up quarks appear to be the same.

add together, forming a positively charged ρ or cancelling out, making 
a positively charged π. Similar combinations occur for any mixture of 
u, d, or s flavours with any of their antiquark counterparts. This 
picture extends to charm, bottom, and top flavours. Among the many 
resulting combinations we illustrate the ‘psi’ (ψ), where the spins 
add to a total of 1, and its partner, the ‘eta-charm’ ηc
, where the 
spins cancel to zero.Exotic matter (and antimatter)
99
In the case of strange quarks, we formed strange baryons and 
mesons which were a few hundred MeV more massive than their 
up and down flavoured counterparts. A similar story happens with 
the charm quark, but due to its greater mass, the analogous 
charmed mesons and baryons weigh in correspondingly heavier, 
the lightest being found around ~1900 MeV or nearly 2 GeV. In 
part as a result of this greater mass, they are not easily produced 
in cosmic rays, and it was only with the advent of dedicated 
experiments at high-energy particle accelerators that the existence 
of charmed particles, and the charm quark, became known in the 
final quarter of the 20th century.
Charm quarks can link in threes with any combination of up, 
down, or strange quarks to make baryons with charm, or even 
with both charm and strangeness. A few examples have even been 
seen where two charmed quarks have joined with an up, down, or 
strange quark. We expect that three charmed quarks can join to 
make a baryon with three units of charm, but clear evidence for its 
existence is still awaited.
A charmed quark can link with a single antiquark that can be any 
of (anti)- up, down, or strange. The most celebrated examples, 
though, are where a charmed quark joins with a charmed 
antiquark, cc, leading to yet another electrically neutral partner, 
adding to the pion and etas, made from uu, dd or ss that we 
already met. The resulting ‘eta-c’, written ηc
, has a mass of just 
below 3,000 MeV, 3 GeV, and as such is the lightest example 
of a whole spectroscopy known as ‘charmonium’.
It was through charmonium that the charm property was first 
discovered. The ηc
 is formed when the c and c
Ω, each having spin 
1/2, couple their spins to a total of zero (see Figure 25). They can 
also couple their spins to give a total value of one; this forms a 
slightly heavier state at 3.1 GeV known as the psi: ψ. When an 
electron and a positron meet and annihilate, they do so most Particle Physics
100
readily when their spins are correlated to make spin one. In such a 
reaction both the energy and also the amount of spin are 
conserved; this has the effect that, if the combined energy of the 
electron and positron matches the mc2
 of a meson with spin one, 
made of a quark and its antiquark (hence electrically neutral), 
then that meson will be produced from the energy left from the 
annihilation of the electron and positron. So, for example, if an 
electron and positron collide head on with a combined energy of 
about 0.8 GeV, which is the mass of the spin-one ρ and ω, either of 
these mesons can be formed; around 1 GeV the analogous meson 
made of ss , namely the ϕ, appears; and at 3.1 GeV we meet ccΩ, 
whence a ψ can be formed. That is how this first example of 
charmonium was found in 1974, and how the spectrum of 
particles was gradually uncovered.
Particles with either charm or strangeness are not stable. Their 
masses are greater than those of baryons or mesons without 
charm or strangeness, and hence their intrinsic energy,

addition a photon or Zo

represented by mc2
, is greater. Thus, although strange and 
charmed particles can be made in high-energy collisions at 
accelerators, or even in the extreme energies that were prevalent 
immediately following the Big Bang, they rapidly decay, leaving 
ultimately up and down quarks within the ‘conventional’ baryons, 
which survive in our day-to-day world; mesons ultimately 
self-destruct due to quark and antiquark annihilation, producing 
photons or electrons and neutrinos as their stable end products.
Bottom and top
We have seen above how Nature has duplicated its basic quark 
flavours making a second set, the strange and charm, with the 
same electric charges but greater mass than their down and up 
cousins. One may well ask why? This is not the end of the story; 
Nature has availed itself of a third set of yet more massive quarks, 
with the same electric charges as those that went before. Thus, we 
have the bottom quark (b), mc2
 ~ 4.5 GeV, electric charge –1/3; 
and there is the top quark (t), mc2
 ~ 180 GeV (this is not a 
misprint!), electric charge +2/3. How it is that Nature packs so 
much mass, comparable to that of an entire atom of gold, into a 
space of at most 10–18 m is one of the great mysteries for the 21st 
century. In some articles these attributes are called truth and 
beauty instead of top and bottom; it is the latter that are now 
rather generally agreed on, and so I shall refer to top and 
bottom here.
Baryons and mesons containing bottom quarks or antiquarks occur 
and are in effect heavier analogues of those containing the lighter 
strange quark of the same charge. The lightest bottom mesons have 
mass, or mc2
, at around 5 GeV. Similarly, bottom baryons occur. 
There is little to be gained in writing out all their characteristics; 
however, if you want to do so, go to the table of strange particles, 
replace s by b and add about 4.5 GeV mass for every b quark or 
antiquark, and you will have it. Bottom mesons have proved 
interesting in that their behaviour may give clues to the puzzle of Particle Physics
102
why the universe is made of matter to the exclusion of antimatter. 
There is also a spectroscopy of ‘bottomonium’ states analogous to 
the charmonium spectroscopy; bottomonium consists of bb¯, the 
lightest example having a mass of around 9.5 GeV.
You might at this point expect that mesons and baryons 
containing top quarks will occur, with properties analogous to 
those of the charmed particles (as top and charm have the same 
charge), and that their main distinguishing feature is that they are 
nearly 200 GeV more massive than their charmed counterparts. 
However, there is no evidence for these states. The problem is that 
the top quark, being so massive, is so unstable that it decays in less 
than 10–25 s. A signal travelling at light speed can only cover about 
1/100 fm in this time, too little to grip other quarks or antiquarks 
to form the bound states that we call mesons and baryons.
The decay occurs by a process analogous to that familiar in 
radioactive (beta) decay. As a neutron turns into a proton when a 
down quark turns into the (lighter) up quark, emitting energy in 
the form of an electron and a neutrino (technically, an 
antineutrino),
ν → + d ue( )
so do the heavier quarks imitate this. The difference between the 
electric charges of any quarks is either zero or ±1. In the latter 
case, a decay can occur from the heavier to the lighter by emitting 
an electron or a positron respectively (along with a neutrino or 
antineutrino). So we can have a cascade of decays
νν νν → →→→ + + t be b ce c se s ue ( ); ( ); ( ); ( )
and at the final step one can have a stable particle left, such as a 
proton. It is possible, though less likely, that a decay chain might 
miss a step, e.g. ν ν → → + – – t de b ue ( ) or ( ). It is also quite 
probable that the charmed quark takes an alternate route Exotic matter (and antimatter)
103
ν ν → → – – + c de d ue ( ); ( ). The d and u quarks have such similar 
masses, reflected in the similar masses of the neutron and proton, 
that the process → ( ) ν
– – d ue is slow, for example the half-life of a 
free neutron is as long as ten minutes. The other mass differences 
are larger, and the processes occur faster, in the case of the top so 
fast that top mesons and baryons do not have time to form.
Who ordered that?
Our world consists of up and down quarks, the electron, and a 
neutrino. The latter is known as the ‘electron-neutrino’, symbol νe
to denote the fact that it is a sibling of the electron. Nature 
triplicates the quarks, with charm and strange, and also top and 
bottom as heavier versions of these electrically charged +2/3 and 
–1/3 particles. It is not just with the quarks that Nature does this; 
there are three varieties of each of the leptons too.
There is a heavier version of the electron, known as the muon, 
symbol μ–
. This is negatively charged, like the electron. The muon 
(and its antiparticle version the μ+) are apparently in all respects 
the same as electrons or positrons except that they are 207 times 
more massive, with an mc2
 ~ 105 MeV. In weak decays, the muon 
is accompanied by a neutrino, but a different neutrino from the νe
. 
We call this the muon-neutrino, symbol νμ (there is, of course, an 
antineutrino too: ν�
μ).

104
There is a third set of leptons. This consists of the tau, a negatively 
charged analogue of the electron but weighing in at some 2 GeV 
(this is denoted τ–
, its antiparticle version being τ+), and the 
associated neutrino (antineutrino) being ντ
 (ν�τ
).
Leptons appear to be fundamental. The muon couples to the 
Higgs boson some 207 times as strongly as an electron does, 
making it correspondingly more massive. If the muon were just a 
heavy electron, it would be able to shed 206 parts of that mass as 
energy in the form of photons, tumbling down to stability: an 
electron. No sign of this transition has ever been seen, however. 
There appears to be something intrinsic to the muon and to the 
electron that must be preserved. This is the property we call 
flavour; it has superb empirical provenance, but we have no 
understanding of what underpins it.
In April 2021, the magnetic moment of the muon was measured 
at Fermilab to an accuracy of ten decimal places. At this level of 
precision there appears to be a disagreement between experiment 
and theory, but not yet at a level to claim a discovery. If this 
discrepancy survives, it could be a hint of virtual massive particles 
disturbing the vacuum and/or further forces, ultra-weak at 
present energies, affecting the muon’s magnetism.
Neutrinos
In the standard model, neutrinos are assumed to have no mass. 
This was because historically no one had ever been able to measure 
a value for any mass that they might have, the amount being so tiny 
that it might well have been zero. However, there is no fundamental 
principle that requires neutrinos to be massless. And indeed, we 
now know that neutrinos do have a mass, exceedingly small 
compared to even the electron mass, but non-zero nonetheless.
There are three known varieties of neutrino, the electron-neutrino, 
muon-neutrino, and tau-neutrino, named for their affinity for Exotic matter (and antimatter)
105
being produced in concert with the electrically charged particle 
that shares their name—the electron (e), mu (μ), and tau (τ) 
leptons. I will refer to these as nu-e, nu-mu, and nu-tau, 
respectively. They are traditionally denoted by the Greek symbol 
for nu and the appropriate subscript, thus νe
, νμ, or ντ
. The fusion 
reactions in the heart of the Sun emit neutrinos of the nu-e (νe
) 
variety.
When they interact with matter and convert neutrons into 
protons, for example, they turn back into e, mu, and tau. For many 
years this was thought to be absolutely true, but today we know 
there is a small chance of a neutrino produced as νe
 ending up as 
νμ or ντ
. This is due to a phenomenon known as neutrino 
oscillations and is an indicator that neutrinos have masses, tiny 
indeed, but not zero.
In quantum mechanics, particles have wavelike character. As the 
oscillations of the electromagnetic field can take on particle 
characteristics—the photons—so do particles such as neutrinos 
have wavelike oscillations as they travel through space. In effect it 
is a wave of varying probability. What set out as a nu-e will vary in 
probability as it travels, changing from nu-e to nu-mu or nu-tau as 
it moves away from the source. However, for this to happen, the 
neutrinos must have different masses, which implies that not all of 
them can be massless.
If physical neutrinos are a mixture of two or more underlying 
quantum states with different masses, then for a given energy the 
quantum waves of these underlying states will have different 
frequencies and so swell back and forth into one another. The 
smaller their mass difference, the more alike their frequencies, the 
slower their oscillation and the longer the distance needed for any 
effect to be detectable (see Figure 28).
As neutrino masses are themselves very small, any differences 
must also be tiny and oscillation lengths large. The first hints Particle Physics
106
came in the late 1960s with detection of neutrinos from the Sun. 
The fusion processes in the Sun produce νe
. Over several decades, 
the intensity of nu-e arriving from the Sun was measured. Given 
our knowledge of the way that the Sun works, it was possible to 
compute the number of νe
 it produced and hence the intensity 
of them when they reach the Earth. However, when the 
measurements were made, the intensity of νe
 arriving here was 
found to be a factor of about three smaller than had been

 composed of 
two mass states ν1,2, which oscillate at different rates. When they are 
out of phase, as in this example, it corresponds to only νμ being

the Sun may oscillate back and forth during its transit through the Sun, 
through space, and even through the Earth (at night). A comparison of

passage through the Earth.Exotic matter (and antimatter)
107
expected. This was the first hint that the νe
 might have a mass and 
be changing into the other varieties of neutrino en-route.
Anomalies were also seen in the mix of νe
 and νμ produced when 
cosmic rays hit atoms in the upper atmosphere. These collisions 
produce a cascade of secondary particles that eventually lead to a 
shower of neutrinos at ground level, and even below ground. From 
experience with the content of cosmic rays and the products of 
their collisions in the upper atmosphere, it was calculated that 
there should be twice as many νμ as νe
. However, experiments 
found a significant shortfall of the νμ variety. Neutrinos from the 
Sun had travelled 150 million km and those in the cosmic ray 
experiments up to 10,000 km—some having even been produced 
on the far side of the globe and passed through the centre of the 
planet before being detected. The data demonstrate the 
propensity for oscillations en route and the ‘disappearance’ 
of νe and νμ, respectively.
Solar neutrino oscillations have been confirmed by the SNO 
(Sudbury Neutrino Observatory) in Canada. The experiment is 
sensitive to all neutrino flavours (see pp. 75–6 in Chapter 6). 
SNO found that the total number of neutrinos arriving here—the 
electron, muon, and tau varieties—agrees with the number 
expected based on models of neutrino production in the solar 
core. SNO also found that the incidence of νe
 is about 1/3 of the 
total, confirming the shortfall is due to the transformation en 
route into νμ and ντ
.
SNO showed that νe
 indeed had changed but did not of itself 
determine into which variety it preferred to go. So have begun 
‘long baseline’ experiments. At accelerators such as CERN, 
Fermilab, or the KEK laboratory in Japan, controlled beams of 
neutrinos have been created. The energy, intensity, and 
composition (mainly νμ) of the neutrino beams is monitored at 
source; it is directed through the ground to be detected several 
hundred kilometres away at a remote underground laboratory. Particle Physics
108
By comparing the composition of the arriving beam with that 
which set out it is becoming possible to determine which flavours 
oscillate into what, and how quickly they do so. From this it is 
then possible to calculate information about their relative masses.
Beams of νμ, for example, were produced at Fermilab in the 
MINOS experiment—‘Main Injector Neutrino Oscillation 
Search’—which ended in 2016. The intensity of νμ was first 
measured at source, then again a few hundred metres away, and 
finally at a large underground detector in Minnesota, 735 km 
away. In Japan, a neutrino beam created at the KEK laboratory 
travelled 250 km westwards under the Japanese Alps to the 
Super-K (Super Kamiokande) detector. In 2010, a tau lepton was 
seen to have been produced by a beam of νμ at CERN, proving that 
there is a chance for νμ to convert to ντ
. Today the study of neutrino 
oscillations has become a quantitative science giving information 
on the mixing for both neutrinos and antineutrinos.
The oscillation data give measures of the relative sizes not of the 
neutrinos’ masses, but the squares of them. These are of the order 
of 10–3
 to 10–4
 eV2
. Studies of beta decay and other precision 
measurements show that neutrino masses are less than 0.8 eV 
(the mass of the electron, for example, is 511 keV, some 200,000 
times larger!). If there were no mixing the three distinct masses of 
neutrino would match directly one to one for νe
, νμ and ντ
. The data 
show that reality is far from this, with the mixing being large, 
meaning that a neutrino of a given mass has significant affinity for 
all three flavours. This is summarized in Figure 29.
From the study of the Zo
 boson we know that there are no more 
light neutrino varieties in Nature. This is because we can measure 
how long the Zo
 lives, which turns out to be the same as theorists 
calculated should be the case so long as there are only three 
distinct varieties of neutrinos that can be produced when it 
decays. The more varieties there are, the faster the Zo
 would decay 
as each available path would make the Zo
 more and more unstable. Exotic matter (and antimatter)
109
If there are any more light neutrinos, they would shorten the Zo
life, in disagreement with what is observed in practice. So the 
inference is that there are only three distinct varieties of such 
light neutrinos.
Given this result, and as we suspect that every variety of such a 
neutrino is partnered by a negatively charged lepton, and these in 
turn partnered by two varieties of quark, the +2/3 and –1/3 
variety, then we have identified the full set of such basic pieces. 
Every one of these leptons and quarks has a spin 1/2. Thus Nature 
appears to have made three generations of fundamental particles 
with spin 1/2. Why three? We do not know. Why was it not

satisfied with one? Here again we do not know for certain, but we 
suspect that the answer may be related to another puzzle: why is 
there an imbalance between matter and antimatter in the

Antimatter has an aura of mystery, the promise of a natural 
Tweedledum to our Tweedledee, where left is right, north is south, 
and time runs in reverse. Its most celebrated property is its ability 
to destroy matter in a flash of light, converting the stuff that we 
are made of into pure energy. In science fiction, antiplanets tempt 
travellers to their doom even as antihydrogen powers the engines 
of astrocruisers. In science fact, according to everything that 
decades of experimental physics has taught us, the newborn 
universe was a cauldron of energy where matter and antimatter 
emerged in perfect balance. Which begs a question: how is it that 
matter and antimatter did not immediately destroy each other in 
an orgy of mutual annihilation? How is it that today, some 14,000 
million years later, there is anything left in the universe at all?
This conundrum touches on our very existence. We are made of 
matter, as is everything we know of in the universe. There are no 
antimatter mines on Earth, which is just as well as they would be

gain extra energy and act as if they have masses of ~350 MeV and ~500 
MeV, respectively. The effective masses of the heavier quarks are not so 
dramatically affected by their entrapment inside hadrons. Their 
masses are charm ~1.5 GeV, bottom ~4.5 GeV, and top ~180 GeV.Exotic matter (and antimatter)

destroyed by the matter surrounding them with catastrophic 
results. Somehow, within moments of the Big Bang, matter had 
managed to emerge victorious; the antimatter having been 
annihilated, the heat energy from the destruction remaining 
(today being a cool 3 degrees above absolute zero in temperature 
and known as the microwave background radiation), and the 
surfeit of matter eventually clumping into galaxies of stars. 
Something must distinguish matter from antimatter so that 
matter emerged victorious.
The sequence of events that enabled the basic pieces of matter to 
be cooked within stars, eventually to form bulk matter as we find 
it today, will be described in the next chapter. Here we discuss the 
question of how matter and antimatter might differ.
This question has plagued physicists and cosmologists for years. 
An essential clue turned up in 1964 with the discovery that Nature 
contains a tiny imbalance, a tendency for the behaviour of certain 
‘strange’ particles, such as the electrically neutral Ko
, not to be 
mimicked precisely by the antimatter counterpart, the o K .
The breakthrough came following the discovery in 1977 of the first 
examples of ‘bottom’ particles and the realization that they are in 
effect heavier versions of strange particles. Indeed, when the 
discovery of bottom and top quarks confirmed that Nature has 
indeed made three generations of quarks, and of antiquarks, 
the resulting equations surprisingly seemed to imply that an 
asymmetry between matter and antimatter for bottom particles 
was almost inevitable. The subtle asymmetry between Ko
 and o K
was predicted to be rather large for their bottom analogues, the Bo
and o B . Today we know this to be the case empirically. Could the 
existence of three generations, and in particular of bottom quarks, 
somehow hold the key to the conundrum? As bottom particles are 
abundant in the first moments of the universe, could they hold the 
secret of how the lopsided universe, where matter dominates 
today, has emerged?Particle Physics
112
Today we know that the presence of three generations of quarks or 
leptons gives mathematically a natural means for particles and 
antiparticles to behave asymmetrically, and that Nature exploits 
this. However, it does so most radically in the case of heavy bottom 
quarks. It turns out these are almost decoupled from the light 
flavours of which our more stable universe is composed—in the 
jargon, ‘quantum mixing angles are small’. So, we have the 
tantalizing situation that we have found a mathematically 
consistent mechanism to generate asymmetry between matter and 
antimatter, but one that Nature seems not to exploit empirically.
Or at least, not in the case of quarks, for which the mixing angles 
are small. But in the case of neutrinos, evidence from neutrino 
oscillations shows that the analogous mixing angles are large. 
There are also some tantalizing hints that the oscillations of 
antineutrinos differ subtly from those of their neutrino 
counterparts (see Chapter 10). Given also that neutrinos are the 
most abundant particles with mass in the universe, there is 
speculation that the properties of neutrinos and antineutrinos are 
somehow key to the matter-antimatter asymmetry. How, or if, this 
occurs is for the future, but it is stimulating a vast amount of 
interest in these ghostly particles.113
Chapter 9
Where has matter 
come from?
We exist because of a series of fortunate accidents: the fact that 
the Sun burns at just the right rate (faster and it would have 
burned out before intelligent life had the chance to develop; 
slower and there might not have been enough energy for 
biochemistry and any life at all); the fact that protons—the seeds 
of hydrogen—are stable, which enables stars to cook the chemical 
elements essential for the Earth to be built; and the fact that 
neutrons are slightly heavier than protons, which enables beta 
radioactivity, transmutation of the elements such as the protons of 
hydrogen into helium, which in turn enables the Sun to shine. 
Were any of these, or several others, slightly changed, we would 
not be here.
We and everything are made from atoms. Where did these atoms 
come from? Most recently (by which I mean 5 billion years!) they 
were formed inside a long-dead star where they were all cooked 
from protons, the nuclei of the simplest atomic element—hydrogen. 
The protons were formed very early in the universe and its 
constituent quarks, and also the electrons, were made within the 
first moments. This chapter describes how the stuff that we are 
made of came to be.
It is primarily protons that form the Sun and fuel it today. Let’s 
first describe how the Sun works and provides the energy for us to Particle Physics
114
exist. Hydrogen is the simplest atom, where a single negatively 
charged electron encircles a central positive proton. Hydrogen 
may be relatively uncommon on Earth (except when trapped 
inside molecules such as water—H2
O), but in the universe at large 
it is the most common atomic element of all. At Earthly 
temperatures atoms can survive, but at higher temperatures, 
above a few thousand degrees, the electrons are no longer trapped 
but roam free: the atom is said to be ionized. This is what it is like 
inside the Sun: electrons and protons swarm independently in the 
state of matter known as plasma.
Protons can bump into one another and initiate a set of nuclear 
processes that eventually converts four of them into the nuclei of 
the next simplest element: helium. The energy locked into a single 
nucleus of helium (its = 2 E mc ) is less than that in the original 
four protons. This ‘spare’ energy is released into the surroundings, 
some of it eventually providing warmth here on Earth.
The protons have to touch in order to fuse and build up helium. This 
is hard as their positive charges tend to repel them, keeping 
them apart. However, the temperature of 10 million degrees gives 
them enough kinetic energy that they manage to encroach near 
enough to start the fusion power process. But it is only just 
enough: 5 billion years after its birth, any individual proton has 
only a 50:50 chance of having taken part in the fusion. Put 
another way: thus far the Sun has used up half of its fuel.
This is the first fortunate circumstance. Humans are the pinnacle 
of evolution, and it has taken almost all of those 5 billion years for 
us to emerge. Had the Sun burned faster, it would have died 
before we arrived.
So let’s see what happens and then why it is balanced just right.
The first step is when two protons meet and touch. One of them 
undergoes a form of radioactive decay, turning into a neutron and Where has matter come from?
115
emitting a positron (the antiparticle of an electron) and a 
neutrino. Normally it is the neutron that decays, due to its extra 
mass and associated instability, into a proton, electron, and 
neutrino. An isolated proton being the lightest baryon, by 
contrast, is stable. But when two protons encroach, they feel 
electrostatic repulsion; this contributes to their total energy, 
making it exceed that of a deuteron (a proton and neutron bound 
together). As a result, one of the protons can turn into a neutron, 
which then binds to another proton, increasing the stability. This 
decay of the proton leads to a neutron, neutrino, and positron, the 
positively charged antiparticle of an electron.
So the very first part of the solar fusion cycle produces 
antimatter! The positron is almost immediately destroyed as it 
collides with an electron in the plasma, producing two 
photons which are scattered by the electrically charged plasma, 
eventually working their way to the solar surface (this takes 
several thousand years), by which time their energy is much 
reduced and they help form part of sunlight. The neutrinos pour 
out from the centre unhindered and reach us within a few 
minutes.
So what has become of the neutron and proton? They grip one 
another tightly, courtesy of the strong nuclear force, and bind 
together: this doublet is a nucleus of heavy hydrogen—the 
deuteron. This deuteron finds itself in the midst of a vast number 
of protons, which still form the bulk of the Sun. Very rapidly the 
deuteron links with another proton to make a nucleus of helium: 
helium-3. Two of these helium-3 can join and rearrange their 
pieces to form a nucleus of helium-4 (the stable common form), 
releasing two spare protons.
So the net result of all this is that four protons have produced a 
single helium, two positrons, and two neutrinos. Protons are the 
fuel, helium the ash, and the energy is released in the form of 
gamma rays, positrons, and neutrinos.Particle Physics
116
The latter steps, where a deuteron and a proton make 3
He and 
then lead to 4
He, happen almost instantaneously; it is the 
tardiness of the first step, pp d → νe
+ + that controls the (slow) 
burning of the Sun that has been so important for us.
The rate of the burning depends upon the strength of the weak 
force, which transmutes the proton into a neutron (‘inverse beta 
decay’). This force has parallels with the electromagnetic force, as 
described earlier. The electromagnetic force is transmitted by 
photons, which are exchanged between one electrically charged

particle and another. Photons are massless: this enables them to 
spread to large distances without restrictions from energy 
conservation and hence gives the electromagnetic force a long 
range. The weak force, by contrast, owes its feebleness (at least at 
the energies characteristic of Earth and the Sun) to the large mass 
of the W boson and its consequent restricted range.
The slowness of solar burning is controlled by the feebleness of 
the weak force which is in turn controlled by the large mass of the 
W boson. Had its mass been smaller, the effective strength of the 
‘weak’ force would have been stronger and the rate of solar 
burning faster. The W gains its mass by its interactions with the 
Higgs field. So here we see a key consequence of these dynamics: 
the Sun burning slowly has enabled long enough to elapse for 
evolution of intelligent life to occur. We owe our existence to the 
effects of the Higgs field.
There are other examples where masses play a sensitive role in 
determining our fate. As we have discussed above, beta decay 
involves a neutron turning into a proton and emitting an electron 
and a neutrino. This requires the neutron to be heavier than the 
proton—which it is, whereby protons are the stable seeds of atoms 
and chemistry. (Had neutrons been lighter, then it would have 
been neutrons that emerged as the stable pieces from the Big 
Bang. These neutral particles would have been unable to attract 
electrons to form atoms, so chemistry would have been different, 
or non-existent.) The neutron is only one part in a thousand 
heavier than the proton, but fortunately this is enough that an 
electron can be produced, or put another way, the electron mass is 
small enough that it can be produced in such a process. Had it 
been larger, then beta decay and the Sun would have been frozen; 
had it been smaller, beta decay would have been faster, the Sun’s 
dynamics different, the intensity of ultraviolet light higher and 
unhealthy for us. (The mass of the electron helps determine the 
size of atoms such as hydrogen; smaller mass correlates with a 
larger atom and vice versa. So things have the size they do in part Particle Physics
118
because the mass of the electron is as it is.) The reason for this 
pattern of masses is still to be found.
So the Sun is shining courtesy of nuclear fusion. In another 
5 billion years its hydrogen will all have gone, turned into helium. 
Already some of the helium is itself fusing with protons and other 
helium nuclei to build up the nuclear seeds of heavier elements. 
These processes also produce neutrinos, some of higher energies 
than those produced in the primary proton fusion; and so by 
detecting neutrinos from the Sun, and measuring their energy 
spectrum, we can begin to get a quantitative look inside our 
nearest star.
Five billion years hence these will be the primary processes, along 
with the fusion to build up yet heavier elements. In some stars 
(but not our Sun) this process continues, building up the nuclei of 
elements up to iron, which is the most stable of all (there are even 
elements beyond iron that are built, but they tend to be rarer). 
Eventually such a star is unable to resist its own weight, and it 
collapses catastrophically. The shock waves spew out matter and 
radiation into space. This is known as a supernova. So stars begin 
as hydrogen, and with these ingredients they cook the periodic 
table; a supernova is the agent that pollutes the cosmos with the 
nuclear seeds of these chemicals.
So where did the material for the primary stars come from?
The early universe
The basic pieces of nuclear matter, quarks, emerged from the Big 
Bang along with electrons. The universe rapidly cooled so that the 
quarks clustered together to form protons. The following 
processes took place:
e electron p proton n neutron neutrino ( ) ( ) ( )( ) + +  νWhere has matter come from?
119
The double arrow is to illustrate that this process could occur in 
either direction. The neutron is slightly heavier than the combined 
masses of a proton and an electron, so the ‘natural’ direction for 
the processes was to go from right to left: the neutron has a 
natural tendency to lower the mass of the whole, liberating energy 
via = 2 E mc . However, the heat of the universe was such that the 
electrons and protons had considerable amounts of kinetic energy, 
such that their total energy exceeded that locked into the mass 
(mc2
) of a neutron. So in these hot conditions the process could as 
easily run from left to right (electron and proton converting into 
neutron and neutrino) as the other direction where the neutrons 
and neutrinos turned back into their electrically charged cousins. 
In these circumstances we say that the universe was in thermal 
equilibrium.
But the universe was rapidly cooling, which made it harder for the 
production of neutrons to continue. After a microsecond the 
universe had cooled to a point where this neutron production 
reaction was effectively frozen out. The surviving reaction was
n pe → ++ν
During this epoch any neutrons that had been produced in the 
earlier heat would be dying out. Every 10 minutes their numbers 
halved (we say they have a ‘half-life’ of about 10 minutes). There 
was no longer enough energy to replace them. But not all the 
neutrons died, as some fortunate ones bumped into protons, 
whereupon they fused to one another to make a deuteron 
(a bound system of a single proton and a neutron which is 
lighter than an isolated proton and neutron are).
At this stage the universe at large plays out the sequence that is 
going on in the Sun today: deuterons and protons building up nuclei 
of helium. This took place until either all of the neutrons had died 
out and gone forever, or the particles in the expanding universe were 
so far apart that they no longer interacted with one another.Particle Physics
120
One microsecond after the Big Bang, all of the neutrinos produced 
in these reactions were free. They thus became the first fossil relics 
of the universe. They moved at high speed and their mass, 
although very small, gave enough gravitational attraction among 
the hordes that they started clustering together, contributing to 
the formation of galaxies. About a billion neutrinos are produced 
for every atom that eventually forms. Neutrinos are thus among 
the most populous particles in the universe. Although we know 
that at least one of the varieties of neutrinos has mass, we don’t 
yet know how big this is. If the mass of a neutrino is greater than 
a few eV, that is, a billionth of that of a proton, then neutrino 
masses will dominate the mass density of the material universe. 
So determining the mass of neutrinos can be a big issue for 
predicting the long-term future of the universe. Will it expand 
forever, or eventually collapse under its own weight? We don’t yet 
know for sure.
The universe continues to expand and cool. The principles of 
physics that determine its expansion are in some ways similar to 
those that control the behaviour of a gas in a container. The rate 
depends on the pressure, which depends on the temperature in 
the gas and the number of neutrinos inside the gas volume 
(the density). This in turn depends on the number of neutrino 
species.
Three minutes after the Big Bang, the material universe consisted 
primarily of the following: 75 per cent protons; 24 per cent helium 
nuclei; a small amount of deuterons; traces of other light 
elements; and free electrons.
The abundance of helium and of the light elements depends on 
the expansion rate of the universe, which in turn depends on the 
number of neutrino species. The observed amount of helium fits 
with predictions if there are three varieties of neutrino. The fact 
that measurements of the Z boson at CERN showed that there are Where has matter come from?
121
indeed three varieties of light neutrino is a remarkable agreement 
between measurements in particle physics, which replicates the 
conditions of the early universe, and what cosmologists had 
inferred from the above.
The abundance of deuterium depends on the density of ‘ordinary’ 
matter in the universe (by ordinary we mean made of neutrons 
and protons, as against other exotic things that theorists might 
dream of but for which there is as yet no direct experimental 
proof, for example supersymmetry, see Chapter 10). The numbers 
all fit provided that the density of ordinary matter is much less 
than the total in the universe. This is part of the dark matter 
puzzle: there is stuff out there that does not shine but is felt by its 
gravity tugging the stars and galaxies. It seems that much of this 
must consist of exotic matter whose identity is yet to be 
determined.
Some 300,000 years later, the ambient temperature had fallen 
below 10,000 degrees, that is similar or cooler than the outer 
regions of our Sun today. At these energies the negatively charged 
electrons were at last able to be held fast by the electrical 
attraction to the positively charged atomic nuclei whereby they 
combined to form neutral atoms. Electromagnetic radiation was 
set free and the universe became transparent as light could roam 
unhindered across space.
The universe has expanded and cooled for almost 14 billion years 
so far. The once hot electromagnetic radiation now forms a black 
body spectrum with an effective temperature of about 3 degrees 
above absolute zero. The discovery of this by Penzias and Wilson 
half a century ago is one of the great pieces of support for the 
Big Bang theory. Today precision measurements of the spectrum 
by instruments in satellites reveal small fluctuations in the cosmic 
microwave. These give hints of proto galaxies forming in the early 
universe.Particle Physics
122
So we have a good qualitative and even quantitative 
understanding of how the basic seeds of matter ended up in you 
and me. But as they emerged along with antimatter in that 
original Big Bang, a puzzle remains: where did all the antimatter 
go? That is one of the questions whose answer is still awaited.123
Chapter 10
Questions for the 
post-Higgs era
The Higgs field
The electroweak force is the force carried by the familiar photon 
of electromagnetism, and by the W and Z bosons, which are 
responsible for the weak interactions that not only initiate solar 
burning, but also underlie certain types of radioactivity. Yet if 
these effects are so closely intertwined, why do they appear so 
different in our daily experiences, that is, at relatively low 
temperatures and energies? One reason is that the particle that 
transmits the electromagnetic force, the photon, is massless, 
whereas the W and Z bosons, which are associated with the weak 
force, have huge masses and each ‘weighs’ as much as an atom 
of silver.
The standard model of the fundamental particles and the forces 
that act among them explains mass by proposing that it is due to a 
field named after Peter Higgs who in 1964 was one of the first to 
recognize this theoretical possibility. The Higgs field permeates all 
of space. Were there no Higgs field, according to the theory, the 
fundamental particles would have no mass. What we recognize as 
their mass is the effect of the interaction between particles and the 
Higgs field. Photons do not interact with the Higgs field and so 
are massless. The data confirm that the mass of W and Z bosons 
comes from the Higgs mechanism, as do the masses of top, Particle Physics
124
bottom, and charm quarks also. It is too early to determine 
whether the mass of lighter quarks, and of the leptons also, arises 
from this mechanism, though data for muon and tau leptons are 
consistent with it. This will become answered as data accumulate 
in the coming years. The masses of protons and neutrons, 
however, are dominated by the kinetic energy of their constituent 
quarks and are only marginally related to the Higgs field.
Just as electromagnetic fields produce the quantum bundles we 
call photons, so does the Higgs field manifest itself in Higgs 
bosons. In Higgs’ original theory there was just one type of Higgs 
boson, but if supersymmetry is correct (see below), there should 
be a family of such particles.
With the discovery of the Higgs boson, the picture of particle 
physics is now internally complete, in the sense that it is 
mathematically consistent. Six quarks matched by six leptons, 
grouped in three pairs of flavours, interact by the exchange of 
vector bosons, their masses coming from interactions with the 
Higgs field. The resulting quantum field theories of these particles 
and forces describe data to superb accuracy.
Successful though this theory may be, we know it doesn’t fully 
describe our world. Internal completeness is a mathematical 
requirement, whereas describing the world around us is the 
demand of natural philosophy. Even apart from the lack of a 
quantum theory of gravity, the standard model doesn’t describe 
dark matter (see below)—which on a cosmic scale far outweighs 
the stuff that we identified and had begun to explain in the 
pre-Higgs era. The Higgs mechanism explains how masses arise 
but gives no clue why they are as they are—why is the up quark 
lighter than a down quark, making the proton lighter than a 
neutron, for example? There is no explanation for the number of 
fundamental leptons and quarks, nor an answer even to a 
question as basic as ‘What makes an electron an electron?’ What, 
indeed, is flavour? Why does the weak interaction violate Questions for the post-Higgs era
125
parity—mirror symmetry? Why does the Higgs field act in such a 
discriminatory way, leaving the photon massless while giving huge 
masses to the W and Z bosons? Other than an anthropic 
answer—we would not exist were it not like this—we have no 
fundamental explanation of this asymmetry.
Is the Higgs field alone the source of the mass of leptons, of 
quarks, and the W and Z bosons, or is there some other 
contribution, and, if so, might identifying the latter explain the 
nature of flavour? This is an example of a question that requires 
high-precision data on the decays of Higgs bosons in hope of 
finding some systematic deviation from expectation that might 
expose subtle phenomena.
Nor do we know whether the gravitational, electroweak, and 
strong forces are the totality. It is straightforward to generalize the 
mathematical structures that underpin these gauge theories 
leading to the prediction that more forces exist, but there is no 
evidence that Nature makes use of this. Now that the mass 
mechanism has been established, it is plausible that the gauge 
bosons of these generalizations are so massive that the resulting 
forces are too feeble for us yet to discern. If, however, gravity, the 
electroweak, and strong forces are the totality, we are left with a 
question: why?
Studying the Higgs boson with high precision might reveal some 
deviations from theoretical expectations and thereby point the 
way to further progress. In the immediate future we need to 
understand how Higgs bosons mutually interact, ultimately 
condensing to form the Higgs field. By analogy, we need the Higgs 
field much like fish need water, and our discovery of the Higgs 
boson is akin to fish having discovered a molecule of H2
O when 
the goal is to understand the ocean. At the LHC in the coming 
decade, higher intensity of the beams and potentially higher 
energy too will increase the chances of producing two (or more) 
Higgs bosons in a single event. From this we can study how they Particle Physics
126
32. Peter Higgs at the CMS detector.Questions for the post-Higgs era
127
mutually interact and begin to understand how the Higgs field is 
formed. Is it a featureless basic field or itself made of deeper 
structure? We know the Higgs field is there; its dynamic structure 
and even what it is made of remain a mystery.
Dark matter
Protons and the nuclei of ordinary atoms seed all the ‘luminous 
matter’ that shows up in astronomical observations. However, the 
motions of spiral galaxies, to take one example, show that there is 
more gravitational force than the observed luminous matter can 
account for. As much as 90 per cent of the matter present 
remains undetected. It appears that the universe we see by its 
electromagnetic radiations is outweighed by some mysterious 
‘dark matter’, which does not show up at any wavelength in our 
telescopes.
If there are large ‘massive compact halo objects’ (MACHOs) which 
could be bodies about the size of Jupiter, and not big enough to 
become shining stars or black holes, they would be detectable by 
creating double or multiple images of the distant star or galaxy 
through the effect of gravitational lensing. However, searches of 
this kind have not found enough MACHOs to explain the vast 
amount of dark matter that the universe appears to contain. The 
detection of gravitational waves arising from the collisions of 
black holes is giving information on their abundance and masses. 
These too seem unable to account for the amount and distribution 
of dark matter. Astrophysicists and cosmologists have had to turn 
to particle physics for further ideas.
The intriguing possibility is that this dark matter could consist of 
vast quantities of subatomic particles that do not interact 
electromagnetically (otherwise we would be able to detect their 
electromagnetic radiation). One obvious candidate is the neutrino, 
whose tiny but non-zero mass could cause large clouds of them to Particle Physics
128
gravitate to one another and help seed the formation of the 
galaxies.
In the early universe, these neutrinos would have been highly 
energetic, moving at almost the speed of light. In the jargon, such 
flighty entities are known as ‘hot’, and computer simulation of 
galaxy evolution in a ‘hot dark matter’ universe shows galaxies 
forming in dense clusters with large voids between them. 
However, this computer model of the universe does not look like 
what the astronomers observe in practice.
The evolution of galaxies would have been very different if the 
dark matter consists of massive, slow-moving, and therefore ‘cold’, 
particles. A problem is that there are no such entities known in 
the standard model, so if this is the answer to the dark matter 
problem, it raises another question: who are these particles?
The existence of dark matter may be the first clue to what lies 
beyond the standard model. A favoured theory postulates the 
existence of ‘supersymmetric’ particles, the lightest of which 
include forms that do not respond to the electromagnetic or 
strong forces, but which may be hundreds of times more massive 
than the proton. Collisions at the highest-energy particle 
accelerators, such as the Tevatron at Fermilab and the Large 
Hadron Collider at CERN, have yet to find evidence for such 
particles, however. A problem is that we have no reliable guide on 
how massive they might be and whether they are within reach at 
the LHC. Cosmic rays might produce such ‘dark particles’, but 
here too we as yet have no empirical confirmation of them.
Which brings us to the question: what is supersymmetry?
Supersymmetry
The paradox of how ‘empty’ atoms form solid matter is solved in 
quantum mechanics. It is a profound property of the fact that Questions for the post-Higgs era
129
electrons (and quarks, and protons, and neutrons) all have an 
intrinsic spin that is one-half of an amount known as Planck’s 
constant, h. Such ‘spin 1/2’ particles are generically known as 
fermions. Quantum mechanics implies that two fermions cannot 
be in the same place, with the same state of motion; in the jargon 
they ‘cannot occupy the same quantum state’. This causes the 
many electrons in complex atoms to occupy specific states, and 
gives rise to the chemical activity, or inertness, of the various 
elements. It also prevents an electron in one atom encroaching too 
readily on one in a neighbouring atom. This underpins many 
properties of bulk matter, such as solidity.
The forces among these fermions are transmitted by photons, 
gluons, and W and Z bosons. Note the word ‘bosons’—the generic 
term referring to particles that have a spin that is zero or an 
integer multiple of Planck’s quantum. Recall that in contrast to 
fermions, which are mutually exclusive, bosons have affinity and 
form collective states, such as is the case for photons in laser 
beams. One of the goals at the LHC is to produce pairs of Higgs 
bosons at a time. By studying how they mutually interact we may 
be able to determine how Higgs bosons collectively form the 
Higgs field, in which we are immersed.
We have seen that the fermions—quarks and leptons—exhibit a 
profound unity, and also that the force-carrying bosons do too. 
Why is it that ‘matter particles’ are all (apparently) made of 
spin-1/2 fermions and the forces transmitted by spin-1 bosons? 
Could there be a further symmetry between the forces and the 
matter particles, such that the known fermions are partnered by 
new bosons, and the known bosons by new fermions, with novel 
forces transmitted by these fermions? Could this lead to a more 
complete unification among particles and forces? According to the 
theory known as supersymmetry, the answer is yes.
In supersymmetry—or SUSY as it is known—there are families 
of bosons that twin the known quarks and leptons. These Particle Physics

‘superquarks’ are known as squarks; their superlepton 
counterparts are known as sleptons. If SUSY were an exact 
symmetry, each variety of lepton or quark would have the same 
mass as its slepton or squark sibling. The electron and selectron 
would have the same mass as one another; similarly, the up quarks 
and the ‘sup’ squark would weigh the same, and so on. In reality 
this is not how things are. The selectron, if it exists, has mass far 
greater than 100 GeV, which implies that it would be hundreds of 
thousands of times more massive than the electron. Similar 
remarks can be made for all of the sleptons or squarks.
An analogous statement can also be made about the super￾partners of the known bosons. In SUSY there are families of 
fermions that twin the known bosons. The naming pattern here is 
to add the appendage ‘-ino’ to denote the super-fermion partner of 
a standard boson. Thus there should exist the photino, gluino, 
zino, and wino (the ‘ino’ pronounced eeno, thus for example it is 
weeno and not whine-o). The hypothetical graviton, the carrier of 
gravity, is predicted to have a partner, the gravitino. Here again, 
were supersymmetry perfect, the photino, gluino, and gravitino 
would be massless, like their photon, gluon, and graviton siblings; 
the wino and zino having masses of 80 and 90 GeV like the W and Z. 
But as was the case above, here again the ‘inos’ have masses far 
greater than their conventional counterparts. If SUSY is correct, 
there should be one or more fermion analogues of the Higgs 
boson, so called ‘Higgsinos’.
SUSY may be theoretically seductive, but we have not found clear 
evidence for a single squark or slepton, nor photino, gluino, wino, 
zino, or Higgsino. Searching for them at the LHC and elsewhere is 
a high priority.
With such a lack of evidence for superparticles, one might wonder 
why theorists believe in SUSY at all. It turns out that such a 
symmetry is very natural, at least mathematically, given the nature 
of space and time as encoded in Einstein’s theory of relativity and Questions for the post-Higgs era

the nature of quantum theory. The resulting pattern of 
superparticles turns out to solve some technical problems in the 
present formulation of particle physics, stabilizing the quantum 
theories of the behaviour of the different forces at high energies 
and the responses of particles to those forces. In a nutshell, 
without SUSY certain attempts to construct unified theories lead 
to nonsensical results, such as that certain events could occur with 
an infinite probability. However, quantum fluctuations, where 
particles and antiparticles can fleetingly emerge from the vacuum 
before disappearing again, can be sensitive to the SUSY particles 
as well as to the known menu; upon including the SUSY 
contributions, more sensible results emerge. The fact that the

nonsensical results have disappeared encourages hope that SUSY 
is indeed involved in Nature’s scheme. Getting rid of nonsense is, 
of course, necessary, but we still do not know if the sensible results 
are identical with how Nature actually behaves. So we have at best 
indirect hints that SUSY is at work, albeit behind the scenes at 
present. The challenge is to produce SUSY particles in 
experiments, thereby proving the theory and enabling detailed 
understanding of it to emerge from the study of their properties.
SUSY might be responsible for at least some of the dark matter 
that seems to dominate the material universe. From the motions 
of the galaxies and other measurements of the cosmos, it can be 
inferred that perhaps as much as 90 per cent of the universe 
consists of massive ‘dark’ matter, dark in the sense that it does not 
shine, possibly because it is impervious to the electromagnetic 
force. In SUSY if the lightest superparticles are electrically 
neutral, such as the photino or gluino say, they could be 
metastable. As such they could form large-scale clusters under 
their mutual gravitational attraction, analogous to the way that 
the familiar stars are initially formed. However, whereas stars 
made of conventional particles, and experiencing all the four 
forces, can undergo fusion and emit light, the neutral SUSY-inos 
would not. If SUSY particles are discovered, it will be fascinating 
to learn if the required neutral particles are indeed the lightest 
and have the required properties. If this should turn out to be so, 
then one will have a most beautiful convergence between the field 
of high-energy particle physics and that of the universe at large.
Quark gluon plasma
If our picture of the origins of matter is correct, then the quarks 
and gluons, which in today’s cold universe are trapped inside 
protons and neutrons, would in the heat of the Big Bang have 
been too hot to stick together. Instead, they would have existed in 
a dense, energetic ‘soup’ known as ‘quark gluon plasma’, or QGP 
for short.Questions for the post-Higgs era
133
These intermingled swarms of quarks and gluons are analogous to 
the state of matter known as plasma, such as is found in the heart 
of the Sun, which consists of independent gases of electrons and 
nuclei too energetic to bind together to form neutral atoms.
Physicists make QGP by smashing large atomic nuclei into one 
another at high energies, such as at the LHC. In such extreme 
conditions the protons and neutrons squeeze together. The nuclei 
‘melt’—in other words, the quarks and gluons flow throughout the 
nucleus rather than remaining ‘frozen’ into individual neutrons 
and protons.
The Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven 
National Laboratory in the USA is a dedicated machine where 
beams of heavy nuclei collide head on. As with simpler particles, 
such as electrons and protons, the great advantage of a colliding 
beam machine is that all the energy gained in accelerating the 
particles goes into the collision. RHIC has been superseded in 
energy by the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, where lead ions 
collide at a total energy of up to 1,300 TeV. At these extreme 
energies, akin to those that would have been the norm in the 
universe when it was less than a trillionth of a second old, QGP 
should become commonplace, so that experimenters can study its 
properties in detail.
Massive neutrinos and the antimatter mystery
A wealth of information about the enigmatic neutrinos is coming 
from ‘long baseline’ experiments. Determining the pattern of their 
masses and their propensity to oscillate into one another will 
provide some of the missing parameters of the standard model. 
We do not know why the values of the masses of the quarks and 
charged leptons are as they are. That they have those values is 
critical for our existence, so understanding this would be a 
significant breakthrough. Determining the neutrino masses could 
therefore provide an essential clue in unravelling this enigma.Particle Physics
134
There remains the possibility that there are more massive 
neutrinos, separate from the trio of light ones. ‘Sterile’ neutrinos 
are hypothetical neutral leptons that interact only by gravity and 
not by other forces in the standard model. If sterile neutrinos exist 
and their mass is smaller than the energies of particles in the 
experiment, they can be produced in the laboratory, either by 
quantum mixing between conventional ‘active’ neutrinos and 
sterile neutrinos or in high-energy particle collisions. In 2018 the 
MiniBOONE experiment at Fermilab reported a stronger 
neutrino oscillation signal than expected, which raised excitement 
that this might be a hint of sterile neutrinos playing some role. 
However, in 2021, results of an upgraded experiment, known as 
MicroBOONE, showed no evidence of sterile neutrinos. This 
remains an active area of research.
Neutrino masses could also have impact on cosmology. Massive 
neutrinos could have played a role in seeding the formation of 
galaxies; they could play some role in explaining the nature of the 
dark matter that pervades the universe; and there is still the 
unresolved puzzle of why the weak interaction experiences a 
violation of parity, mirror symmetry. Neutrinos are a special entree 
to probing the weak interaction, and so the increased study of 
their properties may lead to unexpected discoveries.
There is also theoretical speculation that neutrinos might have 
played a key role in generating the large-scale asymmetry between 
matter and antimatter in the universe. This enigma has grown 
ever more tantalizing since the original discovery of CP 
violation—in effect a difference between matter and 
antimatter—in the strange particles in 1964. It seems that we 
inhabit a volume of matter that is at least 120 million light years 
in diameter. Based on the behaviour of strange particles, and more 
recently of their bottom analogues, most physicists favour the idea 
that there is some subtle asymmetry between matter and 
antimatter at large, and that soon after the Big Bang this tipped 
the balance in favour of a universe dominated by matter. Questions for the post-Higgs era
135
The challenge now is to study these differences in detail in order 
to identify their origins and, perhaps, the source of the asymmetry 
between matter and antimatter in the cosmos.
Recall, kaons are made of a quark and an antiquark and as such 
are an equal mixture of matter and antimatter. The neutral kaon 
(Ko
) consists of a down quark and a strange antiquark, while its 
antiparticle consists of a down antiquark and a strange quark. The 
Ko
 and Ko are thus different particles, but they are intimately 
related through the weak force which, rather surprisingly, allows 
a Ko
 to change to a Ko , and vice versa, via interactions between 
their quarks and antiquarks. What this effect means is that once a 
neutral kaon or neutral antikaon is created, some quantum 
mechanical ‘mixing’ begins to occur.
These in-between mixtures are known as the KS
 (S for ‘short’) and 
the KL (L for ‘long’). The K-Long lives about 600 times longer 
than the K-Short. The important feature is that the states K-Long 
and K-Short behave differently in the combined ‘mirrors’ of 
CP. The two states decay in different ways, the K-Short to two 
pions, the K-Long to three pions. If CP symmetry were perfect 
this pattern of decay would always be true. The K-Long, for 
example, would never decay to two pions. However, as Cronin 
and Fitch and their colleagues first observed in 1964, in about 
0.3 per cent of cases the K-Long does decay to two pions.
With the discovery of bottom quarks in the late 1970s, theorists 
realized that the presence of three generations can lead naturally 
to an asymmetry between matter and antimatter, as outlined in 
Chapter 8. Theory predicted that CP violation should be a large 
effect in the case of B mesons, which are similar to kaons but with 
the strange quark replaced by a bottom quark. This has been 
confirmed by experiments at customized ‘B-factories’ and by the 
LHCb detector at CERN. However, this does not seem to explain 
the vast asymmetry observed for bulk matter made of up and 
down quarks.Particle Physics
136
The discovery that there are also three flavours of massive 
neutrinos is leading theorists to investigate whether three 
generations of leptons could have seeded the empirical 
asymmetry. This has gained credence following the discovery that 
neutrinos appear more likely to oscillate than antineutrinos and 
that mixing is more pronounced than is the case for the quarks, 
as mentioned in Chapter 8.
Since 2010, mu-neutrinos and mu-antineutrinos produced in 
Tokai, Japan, have been beamed 295 km to Kamioka, the 
underground neutrino observatory. This is known as the ‘T2K’ 
experiment. A possible difference in oscillation rates for neutrinos 
and antineutrinos was first noticed in 2016. By 2020 the 
significance had grown. If correct, the data suggest that neutrino 
mixing is as large as theoretically possible. More sensitive 
experiments are being designed to verify if this is the case.
If confirmed, this would be an interesting discovery in its own 
right. More exciting is the possibility that it could be linked to the 
large-scale matter asymmetry of the universe. This would follow if 
there are super-heavy neutrinos that partner the currently known 
lightweight trio, and if these too exhibit an analogous asymmetry 
to their lighter cousins. This is why.
If there are heavy neutrinos, their decays will spawn lightweight 
quarks and antiquarks of all flavours. These in turn cascade down 
to leave the stable seeds of conventional matter and, potentially, 
antimatter. However, if the massive neutrals exhibit an analogous 
asymmetry to their lightweight cousins, their decays will lead to 
an asymmetry in the numbers of quarks and antiquarks. Thus, it 
is possible that we have identified a route to understanding the 
antimatter puzzle. It requires establishing an asymmetry between 
neutrinos and antineutrinos, finding massive neutral cousins to 
these fermions, and establishing that they too exhibit an 
asymmetry. Whether any of this is true, hopefully time will tell. 
Establishing a difference between the oscillation rates of neutrinos Questions for the post-Higgs era
137
and antineutrinos should be possible within a few years. 
Discovering massive neutrinos, if they exist, could happen at any 
time, or not at all. If they are found this will be a major news story, 
so if there is nothing about them, you can assume they are still 
unseen. Once established, attention will focus on studying their 
decay properties to see if matter is favoured over antimatter. That 
could take many years and become a major focus of particle 
physics research.
Science fiction or science fact?
Now for the really bizarre. According to some attempts to build a 
quantum theory of gravity, the three dimensions of space and that 
of time may be just a part of a more profound universe. If so, there 
are dimensions that are beyond perception by our usual senses, 
but which could be revealed at the LHC.
To make some sense of this, imagine a universe perceived by 
flatlanders who are aware of only two dimensions. We, with our 
greater awareness, know of a third. So we can imagine two flat 
plates separated by, say, a millimetre. The effects of forces that 
act within the two dimensions of one plate could leak into the 
third dimension. Some fraction of this leakage will cross the gap 
and be experienced by the flatlanders living on the adjacent 
sheet. They would perceive only the remnant effects, which 
would be feeble in comparison to the fundamental effects that 
would be experienced when not restricted to the flat plane 
universe that they experience.
Now imagine us as ‘flatlanders’ in a universe with higher 
dimensions. The idea is that gravity appears feeble to us because it 
is the effect of the other forces leaking out into the higher 
dimensions in our universe. So when we feel gravity, we are feeling 
the effect of the other unified forces that have leaked away into the 
higher dimensions, leaving a trifling remnant to do its work. One 
could even imagine particles moving from our ‘flatlander’ Particle Physics
138
dimensions into the higher dimensions and in effect ‘disappearing’ 
from the universe as we know it.
In experiments at the LHC at CERN, physicists are on the lookout 
for signs of particles ‘spontaneously’ appearing or vanishing. If 
such a phenomenon were found to occur in some systematic way, 
this could provide evidence that we are indeed like flatlanders, 
and that there are dimensions in Nature beyond the three space 
and one time that we currently experience.
We have reached a point where it is beginning to be hard to 
distinguish science fact from science fiction. But a century ago, 
much of what we take for granted today would have been beyond 
the imagination of H. G. Wells. A hundred years from now there 
will be material in the science text books as yet undreamed of. 
Some fifty years ago I read a book that told of the wonders of the 
atom as they were then being revealed, and of the strange particles 
that were showing up in cosmic rays. Today I am writing about 
them for you. Perhaps in another half century some of you may be 
updating the story for yourselves. Good luck.Further reading
