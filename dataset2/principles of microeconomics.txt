Principles of 
Microeconomics: 
a Guided Tour 
The study of economics is guided by a few big ideas. 
Economists view the world as both scientists and policymakers. 
The theory of comparative advantage explains how people 
benefit from economic interdependence. 
How does the economy coordinate interdependent economic 
actors? Through the market forces of supply and demand. 
The tools of supply and demand are put to work to examine 
the effects of various government policies. 
Why is the equilibrium of supply and demand desirable for 
society as a whole? The concepts of consumer and producer 
surplus explain the efficiency of markets, the costs of taxation, 
and the benefits of international trade. 
Market outcomes are not always efficient, and governments 
can sometimes remedy market failure. 
To fund programs, governments raise revenue through their 
tax systems, which are designed with an eye toward balancing 
efficiency and equity.

the Author 
JORDI CABRE 
N. Gregory Mankiw is the Robert M. Beren Professor 
of Economics at Harvard University. As a student, he 
studied economics at Princeton University and MIT. As 
a teacher, he has taught macroeconomics, microeconom￾ics, statistics, and principles of economics. He even spent 
one summer long ago as a sailing instructor on Long 
Beach Island. 
Professor Mankiw is a prolific writer and regular 
participant in academic and policy debates. His work 
has been published in scholarly journals such as the 
American Economic Review, Journal of Political Economy, 
and Quarterly Journal of Economics and in more popu￾lar forums, such as the New York Times and The Wall 
Street Journal. He is also the author of the best-selling 
intermediate-level textbook Macroeconomics (Worth 
Publishers). 
In addition to his teaching, research, and writing, 
Professor Mankiw has been a research associate of the 
MNational Bureau of Economic Research, a member of 
the Brookings Panel on Economic Activity, an adviser 
to the Congressional Budget Office and the Federal 
Reserve Banks of Boston and New York, a trustee of the 
Urban Institute and the Economic Club of New York, 
and a member of the ETS test development committee 
for the Advanced Placement exam in economics. From 
2003 to 2005, he served as chairman of the President’s 
Council of Economic Advisers.

the two-semester sequence on the principles of economics that I took during 
my first year in college. It is no exaggeration to say that it changed my life. 
I had grown up in a family that often discussed politics over the dinner table. 
The pros and cons of various solutions to society’s problems generated fervent 
debate. But in school, | had been drawn to the sciences. While politics seemed vague, 
rambling, and subjective, science was analytic, systematic, and objective. Political 
debate continued without end, but scientific research made progress. 
My freshman course on the principles of economics opened my eyes to a new 
way of thinking. Economics combines the virtues of politics and science. It is, truly, 
a social science. Its subject matter is society—how people choose to lead their lives 
and how they interact with one another—but it approaches the subject with the 
dispassion of a science. By bringing the methods of science to the questions of 
politics, economics aims to make progress on the challenges that all societies face. 
I wrote this book with the hope that I could convey some of the excitement about 
economics that I felt as a student in my first economics course. Economics is a subject 
in which a little knowledge goes a long way. (The same cannot be said, for instance, 
of the study of physics or the Chinese language.) Economists have a unique world￾view, much of which can be taught in one or two semesters. My goal in this book 
is to transmit this way of thinking to the widest possible audience and to convince 
readers that it illuminates much about their lives and the world around them. 
I believe that everyone should study the fundamental ideas that economics has 
to offer. One purpose of general education is to teach people about the world and 
thereby make them better citizens. The study of economics, as much as any disci￾pline, serves this goal. Writing an economics textbook is, therefore, a great honor 
and a great responsibility. It is one way that economists can help promote better 
government and a more prosperous future. As the great economist Paul Samuelson 
put it, “I don't care who writes a nation’s laws, or crafts its advanced treaties, if [ 
can write its economics textbooks.” 
D uring my 20-vear career as a student, the course that excited me most was 
What’s New in the Tenth Edition? 
Economics aims to understand the world in which we live. Most chapters of this 
book include Case Studies that illustrate how the principles of economics can be 
applied. In the News boxes offer excerpts from newspapers, magazines, and online 
news sources to show how economic ideas shed light on current issues facing soci￾ety. After students finish their first course in economics, they should think about 
news reports from a new perspective and with greater insight. To keep the study of 
economics fresh and relevant for each new cohort of students, I update each edition 
to keep pace with the ever-changing world.

The new applications in this tenth edition are too numerous to list in their entirety, 
but here is a sample of the topics covered (and the chapters in which they appear): 
* Shortages during the coronavirus pandemic renewed the debate over 
whether it is fair for businesses to increase prices during a crisis. (Chapter 4) 
¢ The future of the ride-share market hinges on the elasticities of supply and 
demand. (Chapter 5) 
* The minimum wage remains a contentious topic. (Chapter 6) 
* A carbon tax is a versatile tool to combat global climate change. (Chapter 10) 
* Putting a price on road use gets renewed attention as the United States 
embarks on building new infrastructure. (Chapter 11) 
¢ The pandemic of 2020 taught some lessons about why it's hard to cut 
wasteful medical spending. (Chapter 12) 
¢ The value-added tax might be a policy for the United States to consider. 
(Chapter 13) 
¢ The Biden administration looked to expand the scope of antitrust policy. 
(Chapter 16) 
* Amazon found itself in the crosshairs of antitrust enforcers. (Chapter 18) 
¢ Immigration policy creates winners and losers in the labor market. (Chapter 19) 
¢ The forgone schooling during the coronavirus pandemic might have long￾lasting effects on earnings. (Chapter 20) 
* New research takes a lifetime perspective on measuring inequality. 
(Chapter 21) 
* Robust expansions of the social safety net reduced poverty during the coro￾navirus pandemic. (Chapter 21) 
* People are not good at rationally responding to small-probability events. 
(Chapter 23) 
This edition also includes two new chapters. Chapter 12 examines the economics 
of healthcare. As this sector’s share of the economy has increased, its distinctive 
features, problems, and policy challenges have become more important for students 
to understand. Chapter 24 is an optional appendix chapter that discusses how econo￾mists use data. In recent years, economic research has grown increasingly empiri￾cal, and some instructors want to introduce students to the statistical methods that 
economists use. Instructors who teach this chapter can move it earlier in the course. 
As always, | have carefully gone through every chapter to refine the book’s 
coverage and pedagogy. There are numerous changes, large and small, to ensure 
that the book is clear, accurate, and up-to-date. 
All the changes that I made, and the many others that | considered, were evalu￾ated in light of the benefits of brevity. Like most things studied in economics, a 
student’s time is a scarce resource. I always keep in mind a dictum from the novel￾ist Robertson Davies: “One of the most important things about writing is to boil it 
down and not bore the hell out of everybody.” 
How Is This Book Organized? 
This book is organized to make economics as student-friendly as possible. What 
follows is a whirlwind tour, which will, I hope, give instructors some sense of how 
the pieces fit together.

Chapter 1, “Ten Principles of Economics,” introduces students to the economist’s 
view of the world. It previews the big ideas that recur in economics, such as oppor￾tunity cost, marginal decision making, the role of incentives, the gains from trade, 
and the efficiency of market allocations. Throughout the book, I refer regularly to 
the Ten Principles of Economics in Chapter 1 to remind students that these ideas 
are the foundation for all economics. 
Chapter 2, “Thinking Like an Economist,” examines how economists approach 
their subject. It discusses the role of assumptions in developing a theory and intro￾duces the concept of an economic model. It also explores the role of economists in 
making policy. This chapter’s appendix offers a brief refresher course on how graphs 
are used as well as how they can be abused. 
Chapter 3, “Interdependence and the Gains from Trade,” presents the theory of 
comparative advantage. This theory explains why individuals trade with their neigh￾bors and why nations trade with other nations. Much of economics is about how 
market forces coordinate many individual production and consumption decisions. 
As a starting point for this analysis, students see in this chapter why specialization, 
interdependence, and trade can benefit everyone. 
The Fundamental Tools of Supply and Demand 
The next three chapters introduce the basic tools of supply and demand. Chapter 4, 
“The Market Forces of Supply and Demand,” develops the supply curve, the 
demand curve, and the notion of market equilibrium. Chapter 5, “Elasticity and 
Its Application,” introduces the concept of elasticity and uses it to analyze events 
in three different markets. Chapter 6, “Supply, Demand, and Government Policies,” 
uses these tools to examine price controls, such as rent-control and minimum-wage 
laws, and tax incidence. 
Chapter 7, “Consumers, Producers, and the Efficiency of Markets,” extends the 
analysis of supply and demand using the concepts of consumer surplus and pro￾ducer surplus. It begins by developing the link between consumers’ willingness to 
pay and the demand curve and the link between producers’ costs of production 
and the supply curve. It then shows that the market equilibrium maximizes the 
sum of the producer and consumer surplus. Thus, students learn early about the 
efficiency of market allocations. 
The next two chapters apply the concepts of producer and consumer surplus 
to policy questions. Chapter 8, “Application: The Costs of Taxation,” shows why 
taxation results in deadweight losses and what determines the size of those losses. 
Chapter 9, “Application: International Trade,” considers who wins and who loses 
from international trade and presents the debate over protectionist trade policies. 
More Microeconomics 
Having examined why market allocations are often desirable, the book then considers 
how the government can sometimes improve on them. Chapter 10, “Externalities,” 
explains how external effects such as pollution can render market outcomes inef￾ficient and discusses the possible public and private solutions to those inefficien￾cies. Chapter 11, “Public Goods and Common Resources,” considers the problems 
that arise when goods, such as national defense, have no market price. Chapter 12, 
“The Economics of Healthcare,” examines the distinctive features, problems, and 
policy challenges of an increasingly important sector of the economy. Chapter 13, 
“The Design of the Tax System,” describes how the government raises the revenue

necessary to pay for public goods. It presents some institutional background about 
the U.S. tax system and then discusses how the goals of efficiency and equity come 
into play when designing a tax system. 
The next five chapters examine firm behavior and industrial organization. Chapter 
14, “The Costs of Production,” discusses what to include in a firm's costs, and it 
introduces cost curves. Chapter 15, “Firms in Competitive Markets,” analyzes the 
behavior of price-taking firms and derives the market supply curve. Chapter 16, 
“Monopoly,” discusses the behavior of a firm that is the sole seller in its market. 
It examines the inefficiency of monopoly pricing, the possible policy responses, 
and the attempts by monopolies to price discriminate. Chapter 17, “Monopolistic 
Competition,” looks at behavior in a market in which many sellers offer similar but 
differentiated products. It also discusses the debate over the effects of advertising. 
Chapter 18, “Oligopoly,” covers markets in which there are only a few sellers, using 
the prisoners’ dilemma as the model for examining strategic interaction. 
The next three chapters present issues related to labor markets. Chapter 19, “The 
Markets for the Factors of Production,” emphasizes the link between factor prices 
and marginal productivity. Chapter 20, “Earnings and Discrimination,” discusses the 
determinants of equilibrium wages, including compensating differentials, human 
capital, and discrimination. Chapter 21, “Income Inequality and Poverty,” examines 
the degree of inequality in U.S. society, alternative views about the government’s 
role in changing the distribution of income, and various policies aimed at helping 
members of society experiencing poverty. 
The next three chapters present optional material. Chapter 22, “The Theory of 
Consumer Choice,” analyzes individual decision making using budget constraints 
and indifference curves. Chapter 23, “Frontiers of Microeconomics,” introduces 
the topics of asymmetric information, political economy, and behavioral econom￾ics. Chapter 24, “Appendix: How Economists Use Data,” introduces students to 
the statistical methods that economists use to test and apply their theories. Some 
instructors may skip all or some of this material, but these chapters are useful in 
motivating and preparing students for future courses in microeconomics. Instructors 
who cover these topics may assign these chapters earlier than they are presented in 
the book, and I have written them to facilitate this flexibility. 
Learning Tools 
The purpose of this book is to help students learn the fundamental lessons of eco￾nomics and to show how they can apply these lessons to their lives and the world 
in which they live. Toward that end, | have used various learning tools that recur 
throughout the book. 
Case Studies 
Economic theory is useful and interesting only if it can be applied to understanding 
actual events and policies. This book, therefore, contains numerous case studies that 
apply the theory that has just been developed. 
In the News Boxes 
One benefit that students gain from studying economics is a new perspective and 
greater understanding of news from around the world. To highlight this benefit, [ have 
included excerpts from many newspaper and magazine articles, some of which are

brief introductions, show how basic economic theory can be applied. Most of these 
boxes are new to this edition. Each news article ends with “Questions to Discuss,” 
which can be used to start a dialogue in the classroom. 
FYI Boxes 
These boxes provide additional material “for your information.” Some of them offer 
a glimpse into the history of economic thought. Others clarify technical issues. Still 
others discuss supplementary topics that instructors might choose to either discuss 
or skip in their lectures. 
Ask the Experts Boxes 
This feature summarizes results from the IGM Economic Experts Panel, an ongo￾ing survey of several dozen prominent economists. Every few weeks, these 
experts are offered a statement and then asked whether they agree with it, 
disagree with it, or are uncertain about it. The survey results appear in the 
chapters near the coverage of the relevant topic. They give students a sense of 
when economists are united, when they are divided, and when they just don't 
know what to think. 
Definitions of Key Concepts 
When key concepts are introduced in the chapter, they are presented in blue type￾face. In addition, their definitions are placed in the margins. This treatment should 
aid students in learning and reviewing the material. 
Quick Quizzes 
After each major section in a chapter, students are offered a brief multiple-choice 
Quick Quiz to check their comprehension of what they have just learned. If students 
cannot readily answer these quizzes, they should stop and review the material before 
continuing. The answers to all Quick Quizzes are available at the end of each chapter. 
Chapter in a Nutshell 
Each chapter concludes with a brief summary that reminds students of the most 
important lessons they have learned. Later in their study, it offers an efficient way 
to review for exams. 
List of Key Concepts 
Alist of key concepts at the end of each chapter offers students a way to test their 
understanding of the new terms that have been introduced. Page references are 
included, so students can review the terms they do not understand. 
Questions for Review 
Located at the end of each chapter, questions for review cover the chapter’s pri￾mary lessons. Students can use these questions to check their comprehension and 
prepare for exams. 
Problems and Applications 
Each chapter also contains a variety of problems and applications that ask students to 
apply the material they have learned. Some instructors may use these questions for home￾work assignments. Others may use them as a starting point for classroom discussions.

Let me begin with my colleagues in the economics profession. The many editions 
of this text and its supplemental materials have benefited enormously from their 
input. In reviews and surveys, they have offered suggestions, identified challenges, 
and shared ideas from their own classroom experience. I am indebted to them for 
the perspectives they have brought to the text. Unfortunately, the list has become 
too long to thank those who contributed to previous editions, even though students 
reading the current edition are still benefiting from their insights. 
Most important in this process has been David Hakes (University of Northern 
Iowa). David has served as a reliable sounding board for ideas and a hardworking 
partner with me in putting together the superb package of supplements. 
A special thanks to my friend Jeff Sommer. For many years, Jeff was my editor 
at the New York Times. For this edition, he graciously read through the entire book, 
offering numerous suggestions for improvement. | am deeply grateful for his input. 
The publishing team who worked on the book improved it tremendously. Jane Tufts, 
developmental editor, provided truly spectacular editing—as she always does. Joe 
Sabatino, economics Product Director, and Christopher Rader, Senior Product Manager, 
did a splendid job of overseeing the many people involved in such a large project. 
Colleen Farmer, Allison Janneck, and Anita Verma, Senior Content Managers, were 
crucial in managing the whole project and putting together an excellent team to revise 
the supplements and, with Pradhiba Kannaiyan, project manager at MPS Limited, had 
the patience and dedication necessary to turn my manuscript into this book. Erin Griffin, 
Senior Designer, gave this book its clean, friendly look and designed the wonderful 
cover. Tiffany Lee, copyeditor, refined my prose, and Vikas Makkar, indexer, prepared 
a careful and thorough index. John Carey, Executive Marketing Manager, worked long 
hours getting the word out to potential users of this book. The rest of the Cengage team 
has, as always, been consistently professional, enthusiastic, and dedicated. 
We have a top team of veterans who have worked across multiple editions produc￾ing the supplements that accompany this book. Working with those at Cengage, the 
following have been relentless in making sure that the suite of ancillary materials 
is unmatched in both quantity and quality. No other text comes close. 
PowerPoint: Andreea Chiritescu (Eastern Illinois University) 
Test Bank: Shannon Aucoin, Eugenia Belova, and Alex Lewis (in-house Subject 
Matter Experts) 
Instructor manual: David Hakes (University of Northern lowa) 
I am also grateful to Sarah Lao and Nathan Sun, two star undergraduates at 
Harvard, who helped me check the page proofs for this edition. 
As always, I must thank my “in-house” editor Deborah Mankiw. As the first 
reader of most things | write, she continued to offer just the right mix of criticism 
and encouragement. 
Finally, I should mention my three children, Catherine, Nicholas, and Peter. Their 
contribution to this book was putting up with a father spending too many hours in 
his study. The four of us have much in common—not least of which is our love of 
ice cream (which becomes apparent in Chapter 4).

of Economics 
'he word economy comes from the Greek word oikonomos, 
which means “one who manages a household.” At first, the 
connection between households and economies may seem 
obscure. But in fact, they have much in common. 
No matter how you picture a modern household, its members 
tace endless deasions. Somehow, they must decide which members 
do which tasks and what each receives in return. Who cooks din￾ner? Who gets some extra dessert? Who cleans the bathroom? Who 
gets to drive the car? Whether a household’s income is high, low, 
or somewhere in between, its resources (time, dessert, car mileage) 
must be allocated among alternative uses. 
Like a household, a society faces countless decisions. It must 
find some way to decide what jobs will be done and who will do 
them. Society needs people to grow food, make clothing, and design 
software. Once society has allocated people (as well as land, build￾ings, and machines) to various jobs, it must distribute the goods 
and services they produce. It must decide who will eat potatoes 
and who will eat caviar, who will live in a grand manor and who 
will live in a fifth-floor walk-up.

scarcity 
the limited nature of 
society’s resources 
economics 
the study of how society 
manages its scarce 
resources 
These decisions are important because resources are scarce. Scarcity means that 
society has limited resources and, therefore, cannot produce all the goods and ser￾vices people want. Just as members of a household cannot always get their desires 
satisfied, individuals in a society cannot always attain the standard of living to 
which they might aspire. 
Economics is the study of how society manages its scarce resources. In most societ￾ies, resources are allocated through the combined choices of millions of households 
and businesses. Economists examine how people make these choices: how much 
they work, what they buy, how much they save, how they invest their savings, and 
s0 on. Economists also study how people interact with one another. For instance, 
economists examine how buyers and sellers together determine the price at which 
a good is sold and the quantity that is sold. Finally, economists analyze the forces 
and trends that affect the overall economy, including the growth in average income, 
the fraction of the population that cannot find work, and the rate at which prices 
are rising. 
Economics covers a wide range of topics and encompasses many approaches, 
but it is unified by several central ideas. This chapter discusses Ten Principles of 
Economics. Don't worry if you don’t understand them all at first or if you aren’t com￾pletely convinced that they are sensible or important. These ideas will be explored 
more fully in later chapters. This introduction to the ten principles will give you a 
sense of what economics is all about. Consider this chapter a preview of coming 
attractions. 
1-1 How People Make Decisions 
There is no mystery about what an economy is. Whether it encompasses Los Angeles, 
the United States, or the entire planet, an economy is just a group of people dealing 
with one another as they go about their lives. Because the behavior of an economy 
reflects the behavior of the individuals within it, the first four principles concern 
individual decision making. 
1-1a Principle 1: People Face Trade-Offs 
“There ain’t no such thing as a free lunch.” Grammar aside, this old saying contains 
much truth. To get one thing you want, you usually have to give up another thing 
you want. Making decisions requires trading off one goal for another. 
Consider Selena, a student who is deciding how to use her most valuable 
resource—time. Selena can spend all her time studying economics, all her time 
studying psychology, or divide her time between the two. For every hour she devotes 
to one subject, she gives up an hour she could have used studying the other. And 
for every hour spent studying, she gives up an hour that could have been spent 
napping, bike riding, playing video games, or working at a job for some extra 
spending money. 
Consider Selena’s parents, who are deciding how to use the family income. They 
can spend it on food, clothing, or Selena’s tuition. Or they can save some of their 
income for retirement or a future family vacation. When they allocate a dollar to 
one of these goods, they have one less dollar to spend on another. 
As a society, people face other trade-offs. One classic trade-off is between “guns 
and butter.” The more a society spends on the military, the less it can spend on 
consumer goods. Another critical trade-off is between a clean environment and the 
level of income. Laws that require firms to reduce pollution may raise the cost of

producing goods and services. Because of these higher costs, the firms are likely to 
earn smaller profits, pay lower wages, charge higher prices, or do some combina￾tion of these three things. While pollution regulations yield a cleaner environment 
and the improved health that comes with it, they may reduce the incomes of the 
regulated firms” owners, workers, and customers. 
Another societal trade-off is between efficiency and equality. Efficiency means 
that society is getting the greatest benefits from its scarce resources. Equality means 
that those benefits are distributed uniformly among society’s members. In other 
words, efficiency refers to the size of the economic pie, while equality refers to how 
evenly the pie is sliced. 
These two goals can conflict. Consider, for instance, government policies aimed 
at reducing inequality. Some of these policies, such as welfare or unemployment 
insurance, help the members of society most in need. Others, such as the personal 
income tax, require the financially successful to contribute more than others to sup￾port the government. These policies increase equality but may decrease efficiency. 
When the government redistributes income from the rich to the poor, it reduces the 
reward for hard work for people at all income levels. As a result, people may work 
less and produce fewer goods and services. In other words, when the government 
cuts the economic pie into more equal slices, the pie sometimes shrinks. 
Recognizing that people face trade-offs does not tell us what decisions are best. A 
student should not abandon the study of psychology just because doing so would 
free up time for studying economics. Society should not live with pollution just 
because environmental regulations might reduce our material standard of living. 
The government should not neglect the poor just because helping them would 
distort work incentives. Yet people will make better choices if they understand the 
options available to them. Our study of economics, therefore, starts by acknowl￾edging life’s trade-offs. 
1-1b Principle 2: The Cost of Something Is What You 
Give Up to Get It 
Because people face trade-offs, they need to compare the costs and benefits of alter￾native decisions. In many cases, however, the costs are not as obvious as they might 
first appear. 
Consider the decision to attend college. The main benefits are intellectual enrich￾ment and a lifetime of better job opportunities. But what are the costs? You might 
be tempted to add up the money spent on tuition, books, room, and board. Yet this 
total does not truly represent what you give up to spend a year in college. 
This calculation has two problems. First, it includes some things that are not really 
costs of going to college. Even if you quit school, you need a place to sleep and food 
to eat. Room and board are college costs only to the extent that they exceed the cost 
of living and eating at home or in your apartment. Second, this calculation ignores 
the largest cost of going to college—your time. When you listen to lectures, read 
books, and write papers, you can’t spend that time working and earning money. 
For most students, the earnings they forgo to attend school are the largest cost of 
their education. 
The opportunity cost of an item is what you give up to get it. When making 
decisions, it's smart to take opportunity costs into account, and people often do. 
College athletes who can earn millions dropping out of school and playing profes￾sional sports understand that their opportunity cost of attending college is high. 
Not surprisingly, they sometimes decide that the benefit of a college education is 
not worth the cost.

1-1¢ Principle 3: Rational People Think at the Margin 
Economists often assume that people are rational. Rational people systematically and 
purposefully do the best they can to achieve their goals, given the available opportunities. 
As you study economics, vou will encounter firms that decide how many workers to 
hire and how much product to make and sell to maximize profits. You will meet people 
who decide how much to work and what goods and services to buy to achieve the 
highest possible level of satisfaction. To be sure, human behavior is complex and some￾times deviates from rationality. But the assumption that people do the best they can is, 
economists have found, a good starting point to explain the decisions that people make. 
Rational decision makers know that many issues in life are not black and white 
but involve shades of gray. At dinnertime, you don't ask yourself, “Should I fast 
or eat like a pig?” You are more likely to ask, “Should I take that extra spoonful of 
mashed potatoes?” When exams roll around, your decision is probably not between 
blowing them off and studving 24 hours a day but whether to spend an extra hour 
reviewing your notes instead of hanging out with friends. Economists use the term 
marginal change to describe an incremental adjustment to an existing plan of action. 
Keep in mind that margin means “edge,” so marginal changes are small adjust￾ments around the edges of what you are doing. Rational people make decisions by 
comparing marginal benefits and marginal costs. 
For example, suppose you are deciding whether to watch a movie tonight. You 
pay $30 a month for a streaming service that gives you unlimited access to its film 
library, and you typically watch five movies a month. What cost should you consider 
when deciding whether to stream another movie? The answer might seem to be 
$30/5, or $6, the average cost of a movie. More relevant for your decision, however, 
is the marginal cost—the extra money that you have to pay if you stream another 
film. Here, the marginal cost is zero because you pay $30 regardless of how many 
movies you stream. In other words, at the margin, streaming a movie is free. The 
only cost of watching a movie tonight is the time it takes away from other activities, 
such as working at a job or (better yet) reading this textbook. 
Thinking at the margin is also useful for business decisions. Consider an airline 
deciding how much to charge passengers who fly standby. Suppose that flying a 
200-seat plane across the United States costs the airline $100,000. The average cost 
of each seat is 5500 ($100,000/200). You might think that the airline should never 
sell a ticket for less than $500. But imagine that a plane is about to take off with 
ten empty seats, and Stanley, a standby passenger, is at the gate and willing to pay 
$300 for a seat. Should the airline sell him the ticket? Yes, it should. If the plane has 
empty seats, the cost of adding an extra passenger is tiny. The average 
cost of flying a passenger is 5500, but the marginal cost is merely the 
cost of the can of soda Stanley will consume and the small bit of jet 
fuel needed to carry his weight. As long as Stanley pays more than the 
marginal cost, selling him the ticket is profitable. A rational airline can 
benefit from thinking at the margin.

% might think it should be the other way around: Humans need water

% much more for a diamond than for a cup of water. Economists have 
figured this out. A person’s willingness to pay for a good is based on 
the marginal benefit that an extra unit of the good would yield. The 
marginal benefit, in turn, depends on how many units a person already 
has. Water is essential but plentiful, so the marginal benefit of an extra

cup is small. By contrast, no one needs diamonds to survive, but because they are 
so rare, the marginal benefit of an extra gem is large. 
A rational decision maker takes an action if and only if the action’s marginal benefit 
exceeds its marginal cost. This principle explains why people use streaming services 
as much as they do, why airlines sell tickets below average cost, and why people pay 
more for diamonds than for water. It can take a while to get used to the logic of mar￾ginal thinking, but the study of economics will give you ample opportunity to practice. 
1-1d Principle 4: People Respond to Incentives 
An incentive is something that induces a person to act, such as the prospect of a 
punishment or reward. People respond to incentives if they make decisions by 
comparing costs and benefits. Incentives play a central role in economics. One 
economist went so far as to say that the entire field could be summarized as simply, 
“People respond to incentives. The rest is commentary.” 
Incentives are key to analyzing how markets work. For example, when the price 
of apples rises, people decide to eat fewer apples. At the same time, apple orchards 
decide to hire more workers and harvest more apples. In other words, a higher price 
provides an incentive for buyers to consume less and for sellers to produce more. 
As we will see, the influence of prices on the behavior of consumers and producers 
is crucial to how a market economy allocates scarce resources. 
Public policymakers need to pay attention to incentives: Many policies change 
the costs or benefits that people face and, as a result, alter their behavior. A tax on 
gasoline, for instance, encourages people to drive more fuel-efficient cars and shift 
to electric ones. That is one reason many people drive electric cars in Norway, where 
gas taxes are high, and why big SUVs are so popular in the United States, where 
gas taxes are low. A higher gas tax also encourages people to carpool, take public 
transportation, ride bikes, and live closer to work. 
When policymakers fail to consider incentives, the policies they enact may have 
unintended consequences. For example, consider auto safety. Today, all cars have 
seat belts, but this wasn't true 60 years ago. In 1965, Ralph Nader's book Unsafe at 
Any Speed generated much public concern over auto safety. Congress responded 
with laws requiring seat belts as standard equipment on new cars. 
How does a seat belt law affect safety? The direct effect is obvious: When a per￾son wears a seat belt, the likelihood of surviving an auto accident rises. But that’s 
not the end of the story. The law also affects behavior by altering incentives. The 
relevant behavior here is the speed and care with which drivers operate their cars. 
Driving slowly and carefully is costly because it uses the driver’s time and energy. 
When deciding how to drive, rational people compare, perhaps unconsciously, the 
marginal benefit from safer driving with the marginal cost. They drive more slowly 
and carefully when the benefit of increased safety is high. For example, when road 
conditions are icy, people drive more attentively and at lower speeds than they do 
when road conditions are clear. 
Consider how a seat belt law alters a driver’s cost-benefit calculation. Buckling 
up makes accidents less costly by reducing the risk of injury or death. It is as if 
road conditions had improved: When conditions are safer, people drive faster and 
less carefully. That may be fine for motorists, whose risk of injury in an accident is 
reduced because of seat belts. But if faster, less careful driving leads to more acci￾dents, the seat belt law adversely affects pedestrians, who are more likely to be in 
an accident but (unlike drivers) don't benefit from added protection. 
This discussion of incentives and seat belts isn't idle speculation. In a classic 1975 
study, the economist Sam Peltzman tested the theory and found that auto-safety

laws have had many of these effects. According to Peltzman, these laws give rise 
not only to fewer deaths per accident but also to more accidents. He concluded that 
the net result is little change in driver deaths and an increase in pedestrian deaths. 
Peltzman's analysis of auto safety is an offbeat and controversial example of the 
principle that people respond to incentives. When analyzing any policy, it is impor￾tant to consider not only the direct effects but also the indirect effects that work 
through incentives. If the policy alters incentives, people may change their behavior.

1-2 How People Interact 
The first four principles discussed how individuals make decisions. The next three 
concern how people interact with one another. 
1-2a Principle 5: Trade Can Make Everyone Better Off 
You may have heard on the news that China is the United States’” competitor in the 
world economy. In some ways, this is true. Chinese and U.S. companies compete 
for customers in the markets for clothing, toys, solar panels, automobile tires, and 
many other items. 
Yet it is easy to be misled when thinking about competition among countries. 
Trade between the United States and China is not like a sports contest in which one 
side wins and the other side loses. The opposite is true: Trade between two coun￾tries can make each country better off. Even when trade in the world economy is 
competitive, it can lead to a win-win outcome for the countries involved. 
To see why, consider how trade affects a family. When family members look for 
jobs, they compete against the members of other families who are looking for jobs. 
Families also compete with one another when they go shopping because each wants 
to buy the best goods at the lowest prices. In a sense, each family in an economy 
competes with all other families.

Despite this competition, a family would not be better off isolating itself from 
other families. If it did, it would need to grow its own food, sew its own clothes, 
and build its own home. Clearly, a family gains much from being able to trade with 
others. Trade allows everyone to specialize in the activities they do best, whether 
it is farming, sewing, or home building. By trading with others, people can buy a 
greater variety of goods and services at a lower cost. 
Like families, countries benefit from trading with one another. Trade allows 
countries to specialize in what they do best and to enjoy a greater variety of 
goods and services. The Chinese, as well as the French, Brazilians, and Nigerians, 
are as much the United States” partners in the world economy as they are its 
competitors. 
1-2b Principle 6: Markets Are Usually a Good Way to Organize 
Economic Activity 
The collapse of Communism in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe in the late 
1980s and early 1990s was one of the last century’s transformative events. For the 
most part, countries in the Soviet bloc operated on the premise that government 
officials were in the best position to allocate the economy’s scarce resources. These 
central planners decided what goods and services were produced, how much was 
produced, and who produced and consumed them. The theory behind central 
planning was that the government needed to organize economic activity to ensure 
the well-being of the country and of like-minded nations. 
Most countries that once had centrally planned economies have now shifted 
toward market economies. In a market economy, the decisions of a central planner 
are replaced by those of millions of firms and households. Firms decide whom to 
hire and what to make. Households decide where to work and what to buy with 
their incomes. These firms and households interact in the marketplace, where prices 
and self-interest guide their decisions. 
At first glance, the success of market economies may seem puzzling because 
no one appears to be looking out for the well-being of society as a whole. 
Competitive markets contain many buyers and sellers of numerous goods and 
services, all of them interested primarily in their own well-being. Yet despite 
decentralized decision making and self-interested decision makers, market 
economies have proven remarkably successful in organizing economic activity 
to promote prosperity. 
In his 1776 book, An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, 
Adam Smith made the most famous observation in all of economics: Firms and 
households in competitive markets act as if they are guided by an “invisible hand” 
that leads them to desirable outcomes. One of the chief goals of this book is to 
understand how this invisible hand works its magic. 
As you study economics, you will learn that prices are the instrument with which 
the invisible hand directs economic activity. In a competitive market, sellers look at 
the price when deciding how much to supply, and buyers look at the price when 
deciding how much to demand. As a result of their decisions, the price reflects both 
the sellers’ costs of production and the value of the good to the buyers. Smith's great 
insight was that prices adjust to guide market participants to reach outcomes that, 
in many cases, maximize the well-being of society as a whole. 
Smith's insight has an important corollary: When a government prevents prices 
from adjusting to supply and demand, it impedes the invisible hand’s ability to 
coordinate the decisions of the firms and households that make up an economy. This 
corollary explains the adverse effect of most taxes on the allocation of resources:

THE Wikl STREE T JICURMAL i 
FAOM THE WALL STREET JOJRNAL - FERMESEION, 
CARTODM FEATLIRES SYMOICATEPart | Introduction 
t may be anly a coincidence that Adam Smith’s great book The Wealth 
of Nations was published in 1776, the exact year in which American 
revolutionaries signed the Declaration of Independence. But the two docu￾ments share a point of view that was prevalent at the time: Individuals 
are usually best left to their own devices, without the heavy hand of 
government directing their actions. This philosophy provides the intel￾lectual foundation for the market economy and, more generally, for a 
free society. 
Why do decentralized market economies work reasonably well? s it 
because people can be trusted to treat one another with love, kindness, 
and generosity? Not at all. Here is Adam Smith's description of how people 
interact in a market economy: 
Man has almost constant 
occasion for the help of his 
brethren, and it is in vain for 
him to expect it from their 
benevolence only. He will be 
the meaning of every such offer; and it is in this manner 
that we obtain from one another the far greater part of those 
good offices which we stand in need of. 
It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, 
or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard 
to their own interest. We address ourselves, not to their 
humanity but to their self-love, and never talk to them of 
our own necessities but of their advantages. Nobody but a 
beggar chooses to depend chiefly upon the benevolence of 
his fellow-citizens. . . . 
Every individual . . . neither intends to promote the public 
interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. . . . He 
intends only his own gain, and he is in this, as in many other 
cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was 
no part of his intention. Mor is it always the worse for the 
society that it was no part of it. By pursuing his own interest 
he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually 
than when he really intends to promote it.

Taxes distort prices and the decisions of firms and households. It also explains the 
prablems caused by policies that dictate prices, such as rent control. And it explains 
the economic failure of Communist countries, where prices were set not in the mar￾ketplace but by central planners. These planners lacked the overwhelming amount 
of complex and ever-changing information about producers’ costs and consumers’ 
tastes, which, in a market economy; is reflected in prices. Central planners failed

Adam Smith Would Have Loved Uber 
You may have never lived in a centrally planned economy, but if you 
have tried to hail a cab in a major city, you have likely experienced a 
highly regulated market. In many cities, the local government impos￾es strict controls in the market for taxis. The rules usually go well beyond the 
regulation of insurance and safety. For example, the government may limit entryChapter 1 Ten Frinciples of Economics g 
into the market by approving only a certain number of taxi medallions or permits. 
It may determine the prices that taxis are allowed to charge. The government uses 
its police powers—that is, the threat of fines or jail time—to keep unauthorized 
drivers off the streets and prevent drivers from charging unauthorized prices. 
In 2009, however, this highly controlled market was invaded by a disruptive 
force: Uber, a company that provides a smartphone app to connect passengers and 
drivers. Because Uber cars do not roam the streets looking for taxi-hailing pedestri￾ans, they are technically not taxis and so are not subject to the same regulations. But 
they offer a similar service. Indeed, rides from Uber—and from Uber’s competitors 
that have since entered many markets—are often more convenient. On a cold, rainy 
day, who wants to wait by the side of the road for an empty cab to drive by? It is 
more pleasant to remain inside, use a smartphone to arrange a ride, and stay warm 
and dry until the car arrives. 
Uber cars often charge less than taxis, but not always. Uber's prices rise signifi￾cantly when there is a surge in demand, such as during a sudden rainstorm or late 
on New Year’s Eve, when numerous tipsy partygoers are looking for a safe way to 
get home. By contrast, regulated taxis are typically prevented from surge pricing. 
Not everyone is fond of Uber. Drivers of traditional taxis complain that this new 
competition reduces their income. This is hardly a surprise: Suppliers of goods and 
services often dislike new competitors. But vigorous competition among producers 
makes a market work well for consumers. 
That is why economists embraced Uber’s entry into the market. A 2014 survey 
of several dozen prominent economists asked whether car services such as Uber 
increased consumer well-being. Every single economist said “Yes.” The economists 
were also asked whether surge pricing increased consumer well-being. “Yes,” said 
85 percent of them. Surge pricing makes consumers pay more at times, but because 
Uber drivers respond to incentives, it also increases the quantity of car services sup￾plied when they are most needed. Surge pricing also helps allocate the services to 
those consumers who value them most highly and reduces the costs of searching 
and waiting for a car. 
If Adam Smith were alive today, he would surely have a ride-sharing app on his 
phone. @ 
1-2¢ Principle 7: Governments Can Sometimes 
Improve Market Outcomes 
If the invisible hand is so great, what is left for a government to do in an economy? 
One purpose of studying economics is to refine your view about the proper role 
and scope of government policy. 
One reason we need government is that the invisible hand can work its magic only 
if the government enforces the rules and maintains the institutions that are key to a 
market economy. Most importantly, market economies need institutions to enforce 
property rights so individuals can own and control scarce resources. Farmers won't 
grow food if they expect their crop to be stolen, restaurants won't serve meals if 
many customers leave before paying, and film companies won't produce movies if 
too many people pirate copies. Market participants rely on government-provided 
police and courts to enforce their rights, and the invisible hand works well only if 
the legal system does. 
Another reason we need government is that the invisible hand, while powerful, 
is not omnipotent. There are two broad rationales for a government to intervene in 
the economy and change the allocation of resources that people would choose on

their own: to promote efficiency or to promote equality. That is, policies can aim 
either to enlarge the economic pie or to change how the pie is sliced. 
Consider the goal of efficiency. The invisible hand usually leads markets to allocate 
resources to maximize the size of the economic pie, but this is not always the case. 
Economists use the term market failure to refer to a situation in which the market 
does not produce an efficient allocation of resources on its own. One possible cause 
of market failure is an externality, which is the impact of one person’s actions on 
the well-being of a bystander. The classic example of an externality is pollution. 
When the production of a good pollutes the air and creates health problems for 
those who live near the factories, the market may fail to take this cost into account. 
Another possible cause of market failure is market power, which refers to the abil￾ity of a single person or firm (or a small group of them) to unduly influence market 
prices. For example, if everyone in town needs water but there is only one well, the 
owner of the well does not face the rigorous competition with which the invisible 
hand normally keeps self-interest in check; the well owner may take advantage 
of this opportunity by restricting the output of water and charging a higher price. 
In the presence of externalities or market power, well-designed public policy can 
enhance efficiency. 
Now consider the goal of equality. Even when the invisible hand yields efficient 
outcomes, it can nonetheless leave large disparities in well-being. A market economy 
rewards people according to their ability to produce things that other people are 
willing to pay for. The world’s best basketball player earns more than the world’s 
best chess player simply because people are willing to pay more to watch basket￾ball than chess. The invisible hand does not ensure that everyone has enough food, 
decent clothing, and adequate healthcare. This inequality may call for government 
intervention. In practice, many public policies, such as the income tax and the wel￾fare system, aim to achieve a more equal distribution of well-being. 
To say that the government can improve market outcomes does not mean that it 
always will. Public policy is made not by angels but by an imperfect political process. 
Sometimes, policies are designed to reward the politically powerful. Sometimes, 
they are made by well-intentioned leaders who are ill-informed. As you study eco￾nomics, you will become a better judge of when a government policy is justifiable 
because it promotes efficiency or equality and when it is not.

1-3 How the Economy as a Whole Works 
We started by discussing how individuals make decisions and then looked at how 
people interact. All these decisions and interactions together make up “the economy.” 
The last three principles concern the workings of the economy as a whole. 
1-3a Principle 8: A Country’s Standard of Living Depends 
on Its Ability to Produce Goods and Services 
The differences in living standards around the world are staggering. In 2019, the 
average American earned about $65,000. In the same year, the average German 
earned about $56,000, the average Chinese earned about $17,000, and the aver￾age Nigerian earned only $5,000. This variation in average income is reflected in 
measures of quality of life. People in high-income countries have more computers, 
more cars, better nutrition, better healthcare, and a longer life expectancy than do 
those in low-income countries. 
Changes in living standards over time are also large. In the United States, incomes 
have historically grown about 2 percent per year (after adjusting for changes in the 
cost of living). At this rate, the average income doubles every 35 years. Over the 
past century, the average U.S. income has risen about eightfold. 
What explains these large differences across countries and over time? The answer is 
simple. Almost all variation in living standards is attributable to differences in countries’ 
productivity—that is, the amount of goods and services produced by each unit of labor 
input. In nations where workers can produce a large quantity of goods and services 
per hour, most people enjoy a high standard of living; in nations where workers are 
less productive, most people endure a more meager existence. Similarly, the growth 
rate of a nation’s productivity determines the growth rate of its average income. 
The relationship between productivity and living standards is simple, but its impli￾cations are far-reaching. If productivity is the main determinant of living standards, 
other explanations must be less important. For example, it might be tempting to credit 
generous employers or vigorous labor unions for the rising incomes of American 
workers over the past century. Yet the real hero of American workers is their rising 
productivity. As another example, some commentators have suggested that increased 
international competition explains the slowdown in U.S. income growth that began in 
the mid-1970s. But the real villain was flagging productivity growth in the United States. 
The relationship between productivity and living standards has profound impli￾cations for public policy. When thinking about how any policy will affect living 
standards, the key question is how it will affect the economy’s ability to produce 
goods and services. To boost living standards, policymakers need to raise productiv￾ity by ensuring that workers are well trained, have the tools they need to produce 
goods and services, and have access to the best available technology. 
1-3b Principle 9: Prices Rise When the Government Prints 
Too Much Money 
In January 1921, a daily newspaper in Germany cost (.30 marks. Less than two years 
later, in November 1922, the same newspaper cost 70,000,000 marks. All other prices 
in the economy rose by similar amounts. This episode is one of history’s most spec￾tacular examples of inflation, an increase in the overall level of prices in the economy. 
The United States has never experienced inflation even close to that of Germany 
in the 1920s, but inflation has at times been a problem. During the 1970s, the overall 
level of prices more than doubled, and President Gerald Ford called inflation “public 
enemy number one.” By contrast, inflation in the first two decades of the 21st century

business cycle 
fluctuations in 
economic activity, such 
as employment and 
production 
ran about 2 percent per year; at this rate, it takes 35 years for prices to double. 
Because high inflation imposes various costs on society, keeping inflation at a 
reasonable rate is a goal of economic policymakers around the world. 
What causes inflation? In almost all cases of large or persistent inflation, the 
culprit is growth in the quantity of money. When a government creates large 
quantities of the nation’s money, the value of the money falls. In Germany in the 
early 1920s, when prices were, on average, tripling every month, the quantity of 
money was also tripling every month. Although less dramatic, the history of the 
United States points to a similar conclusion: The high inflation of the 1970s was 
associated with rapid growth in the quantity of money, and the return of low 
inflation in the 1980s was associated with slower growth in the quantity of money. 
In 2022, as this book was going to press, U.S. inflation was surging. In February 
of that year, consumer prices were 7.9 percent higher than a year earlier, the highest 
inflation rate in 40 years. During the economic downturn caused by the coronavirus 
pandemic in 2020, the government alleviated the hardship with large increases in spend￾ing, and the quantity of money in the economy rose significantly. These policies, together 
with supply disruptions due to the pandemic, contributed to rising inflation. The key 
question was whether the inflation surge would be transitory, as many government 
officials believed, or whether it would become embedded in the economy, as occurred 
in the 1970s. The outcome would depend, in large part, on future monetary policy. 
1-3¢ Principle 10: Society Faces a Short-Run Trade-Off 
between Inflation and Unemployment 
While an increase in the quantity of money primarily raises prices in the long run, 
the short-run story is more complex. Most economists describe the short-run effects 
of money growth as follows: 
¢ Increasing the amount of money in the economy stimulates the overall level 
of spending and thus the demand for goods and services. 
* Higher demand will, over time, cause firms to raise their prices, but in the 
meantime, it encourages them to hire more workers and produce a larger 
quantity of goods and services. 
¢ More hiring means lower unemployment. 
This line of reasoning leads to one final economy-wide trade-off: a short-run trade￾off between inflation and unemployment. 
Some economists still question these ideas, but most accept that society faces 
a short-run trade-off between inflation and unemployment. This simply means 
that, over a period of a year or two, many economic policies push inflation and 
unemployment in opposite directions. Policymakers face this trade-off regardless of 
whether inflation and unemployment both start out at high levels (as they did in the 
early 1980s), at low levels (as they did in the late 2010s), or someplace in between. 
This short-run trade-off plays a key role in the analysis of the business cycle—the 
irregular and largely unpredictable fluctuations in economic activity, as measured 
by the production of goods and services or the number of people employed. 
Policymakers can exploit the short-run trade-off between inflation and unemploy￾ment using various policy instruments. By changing the amount that the govern￾ment spends, the amount it taxes, or the amount of money it prints, policymakers 
can influence the overall demand for goods and services. Changes in demand, in 
turn, influence the combination of inflation and unemployment that the economy 
experiences in the short run. Because these instruments of economic policy are so 
powerful, how policymakers should use them is the subject of continuing debate.

1-4 Conclusion 
You now have a taste of what economics is all about. In the coming chapters, we will 
develop many specific insights about people, markets, and economies. Mastering 
them will take some effort, but the task is not overwhelming. The field of economics 
is based on a few big ideas that can be applied in many situations. 
Throughout this book, we will refer to the Ten Principles of Economics intro￾duced in this chapter and summarized in Table 1. Keep these building blocks in 
mind. Even the most sophisticated economic analysis is founded on these ten 
principles.

2-1 The Economist as Scientist 
“I"'m a social scientist, 
Michael. That means | 
can't explain electric￾ity or anything like 
that, but if you ever 
want to know about 
people, I'm your 
man.” 
Economists try to address their subject with a scientist’s objectivity. They approach 
the study of the economy much as a physicist approaches the study of matter and 
a biologist approaches the study of life: They devise theories, collect data, and then 
analyze the data to verify or refute their theories. 
The claim that economics is a science can seem odd. After all, economists don’t 
work with test tubes or telescopes, and they don’t wear white lab coats. Like other 
social scientists, they study human beings, a subject that everyone knows something 
about without the need for a university degree. The essence of science, however, 
is the scientific method—the dispassionate development and testing of theories 
about how the world works. This method of inquiry is as applicable to studying a 
nation’s economy as it is to studying the earth’s gravity or a species’ evolution. As 
Albert Einstein put it, “The whole of science is nothing more than the refinement 
of everyday thinking."” 
Einstein’s comment is as true for economics as it is for physics, but most people 
are not accustomed to looking at society through a scientific lens. Let’s consider 
some of the ways economists apply the logic of science to examine how an economy 
works. 
2-1a The Scientific Method: Observation, Theory, 
and More Observation 
Isaac Newton, the 17th-century scientist and mathematician, told his biographer that 
he became intrigued one day when he saw an apple fall from a tree. Why did the 
apple always fall straight down to the earth? Newton's musing led him to develop 
a theory of gravity that applies not only to a falling apple but to any two objects in 
the universe. Subsequent testing of Newton's theory has shown that it works well in 
many circumstances (but not all, as Einstein would later show). Because Newton's 
theory has been so successful at explaining what we observe around us, it is still 
taught in physics courses. 
A similar interplay between theory and observation occurs in economics. An 
economist who lives in a country with rapidly increasing prices may be moved 
by this observation to develop a theory of inflation. The theory might assert that 
high inflation arises when the government issues too much money. To test this 
theory, the economist could collect and analyze data on prices and money from 
many different countries. If the growth in the quantity of money were unrelated 
to the rate of price increase, the economist would start to doubt the validity of this 
theory of inflation. If money growth and inflation were correlated in international 
data, as in fact they often are, the economist would become more confident in the 
proposed theory. 
Although economists use theory and observation like other scientists, they face 
an obstacle that makes their task challenging: Conducting experiments is often 
impractical. Physicists studying gravity can drop objects in their laboratories to 
test their theories. By contrast, economists studying inflation are not allowed to 
manipulate a nation’s monetary policy simply to generate useful data. Economists, 
like astronomers and evolutionary biologists, usually make do with whatever data 
the world gives them. 
To substitute for laboratory experiments, economists pay close attention to the 
natural experiments offered by history. When a war in the Middle East interrupts the 
supply of crude oil, for instance, oil prices skyrocket around the world. For consum￾ers of oil and oil products, such an event raises the cost of living. For policymakers,

it poses a difficult choice about how best to respond. But for economic scientists, the 
event provides an opportunity to study the effects of a key natural resource on the 
world’s economies. Throughout this book, we consider many historical episodes. 
Studying them yields insights into the economy of the past and helps to illustrate 
and evaluate economic theories of the present. 
2-1b The Role of Assumptions 
If you ask physicists how long it would take a marble to fall from the top of a 
ten-story building, they will likely answer by assuming that the marble falls in 
a vacuum. Yet this assumption is false. The building is surrounded by air, which 
exerts friction on the falling marble and slows it down. Why provide answers 
that ignore the complexity of the real world? In this case, physicists will point out 
that the friction on the marble is so small that its effect is negligible. Assuming 
the marble falls in a vacuum simplifies the problem without substantially affect￾ing the answer. Physicists understand, however, that for a more precise answer, 
they would have to revisit their assumptions and perform a more sophisticated 
analysis. 
Economists make assumptions for the same reason: Assumptions can simplify the 
complex world and make it easier to understand. To study international trade, for 
example, we might assume that the world consists of only two countries and that 
each country produces only two goods. We know that this isn't an accurate repre￾sentation of the real world, which consists of many countries producing thousands 
of different types of goods. But by assuming the world has only two countries and 
two goods, we can focus on the essence of the problem. After analyzing international 
trade in this simplified imaginary world, we are in a better position to understand 
trade in the more complex world in which we live. 
The art in scientific thinking—whether in physics, biology, or economics—is 
decldmg which assumptions to make. Suppose, for instance, that instead of drop￾ping a marble from the top of a building, we were dropping a beach ball of the same 
weight. Our physicist would realize that the assumption of no friction is wildly 
inaccurate in this case: Friction exerts a greater force on the beach ball because it is 
much larger than a marble. Pretending that gravity works in a vacuum is reasonable 
when studying a falling marble, but it would lead to large errors when studying a 
falling beach ball. 
Similarly, economists use different assumptions to answer different questions. 
Suppose, for example, that we want to study what happens to the economy when 
the government changes the number of dollars in circulation. An important piece 
of this analysis, it turns out, is how prices respond. Many prices in the economy 
change infrequently: The newsstand prices of magazines, for instance, change only 
once every few years. Knowing this fact may lead us to make different assump￾tions for different time horizons. When studying the short-run effects of the policy, 
we may assume that prices do not change much. We may even make the extreme 
assumption that all prices are completely fixed. When studying the long-run effects 
of the policy, however, we may assume that all prices are completely flexible. Just 
as physicists use different assumptions when studying falling marbles and falling 
beach balls, economists use different assumptions when studying the short-run and 
long-run effects of a change in the quantity of money. 
2-1¢ Economic Models

circular-flow diagram 
a visual model of the 
economy that shows 
how dollars flow 
through markets among 
households and firms 
on—and allow teachers to show their students very simply how the important parts 
of the body fit together. Because these plastic models are stylized and omit many 
details, no one would mistake one of them for a real person. Despite this lack of 
realism—indeed, because of it—studying these models is useful for learning how 
the human body works. 
Economists also use models to learn about the world, but unlike plastic manikins, 
their models mostly consist of diagrams and equations. Like a biology teacher’s 
plastic model, economic models omit many details to allow us to see what is truly 
important. Just as the biology teacher’s model does not include all the body’s mus￾cles and blood vessels, an economist’s model does not include every feature of the 
economy or every aspect of human behavior. 
As we use models to examine various issues throughout this book, you will 
see that models are built with assumptions. Just as physicists begin the analysis 
of a falling marble by assuming away the existence of friction, economists assume 
away many details of the economy that are irrelevant to the question at hand. 
All models—in physics, biology, and economics—simplify reality to improve our 
understanding of it. And all models are subject to revision when the facts warrant 
it. The key is to find the right model at the right time. As the statistician George Box 
put it, “All models are wrong, but some are useful.” 
2-1d Ouwr First Model: The Circular-Flow Diagram 
The economy consists of millions of people engaged in many activities—buying, 
selling, working, hiring, manufacturing, and so on. To understand how the economy 
works, we must simplify our thinking about all these activities. In other words, we 
need a model that explains how the economy is organized and how participants in 
the economy interact with one another. 
Figure 1 presents a visual model of the economy called the circular-flow diagram. 
In this model, the economy includes only two types of decision makers—firms and 
households. Firms produce goods and services using inputs, such as labor, land, and 
capital (buildings and machines). These inputs are called the factors of production. 
Households own the factors of production and consume all the goods and services 
that the firms produce. 
Households and firms interact in two types of markets. In the markets for goods 
and services, households are buyers, and firms are sellers. Specifically, households 
buy the output of goods and services that firms produce. In the markets for the 
factors of production, households are sellers, and firms are buyers. In these mar￾kets, households provide the inputs that firms use to produce goods and services. 
The circular-flow diagram offers a simple way of organizing all the transactions 
between households and firms in an economy. 
The two loops of the circular-flow diagram are distinct but related. The inner 
loop represents the flows of inputs and outputs. Households sell the use of their 
labor, land, and capital to firms in the markets for the factors of production. Firms 
then use these factors to produce goods and services, which in turn are sold to 
households in the markets for goods and services. The outer loop of the diagram 
represents the corresponding flow of dollars. Households spend money to buy 
goods and services from firms. The firms use some of the revenue from these 
sales to purchase the factors of production, such as by paying workers” wages.

Let’s take a tour of the circular flow by following a dollar bill as it makes its 
way from person to person through the economy. Imagine that the dollar begins 
at a household—say, in your wallet. If you want a cup of coffee, you take the 
dollar (along with a few of its relatives) to the market for coffee, which is one of 
the many markets for goods and services. When you buy your favorite drink at 
your local coffee shop, the dollar moves into the shop’s cash register, becoming 
revenue for the firm. The dollar doesn’t stay there for long, however, because the 
firm spends it on inputs in the markets for the factors of production. The coffee 
shop might use the dollar to pay rent to its landlord for the space it occupies or 
to compensate the baristas. Or it might return the dollar as profit to the shop’s 
owner. In any case, the dollar enters the income of some household and, once 
again, is back in someone’s wallet. At that point, the story of the economy’s cir￾cular flow starts once again. 
The circular-flow diagram in Figure 1 is a simple model of the economy. A 
more complex and realistic circular-flow model would include, for instance, the 
roles of government and international trade. (A portion of the dollar you gave to 
the coffee shop might be used to pay taxes or to buy coffee beans from a farmer 
in Kenya.) Yet these details are not crucial for a basic understanding of how the 
economy is organized. Because of its simplicity, this circular-flow diagram is 
useful to keep in mind when thinking about how the pieces of an economy fit 
together.

2-1e Our Second Model: The Production Possibilities Frontier 
Most economic models, unlike the circular-flow diagram, are built using the tools of 
mathematics. Here, we use one of the simplest of these models, called the produc￾tion possibilities frontier, to illustrate some basic economic ideas. 
Although real economies produce thousands of goods and services, consider 
an economy that produces only two goods—cars and computers. Together, the 
car and computer industries use all of this economy’s factors of production. The 
production production possibilities frontier is a graph that shows the various combinations 
possibilities frontier of output—in this case, cars and computers—the economy can possibly produce 
a graph that shows the given the available factors of production and the production technology that firms 
combinations of output use to turn these inputs into output. 
that the economy can Figure 2 shows this economy’s production possibilities frontier. If the economy 
possibly produce with uses all its resources in the car industry, it produces 1,000 cars and no computers. If 
the available factors it uses all its resources in the computer industry, it produces 3,000 computers and 
of production and no cars. The two endpoints of the production possibilities frontier represent these 
production technology extreme possibilities. 
More likely, the economy divides its resources between the two industries, pro￾ducing some cars and some computers. For example, it can produce 600 cars and 
2,200 computers, as shown in the figure by point A. Or, by moving some of the 
factors of production to the car industry from the computer industry, the economy 
can produce 700 cars and 2,000 computers, represented by point B. 
Because resources are scarce, not every conceivable outcome is feasible. For 
example, no matter how resources are allocated between the two industries, the 
economy cannot produce the number of cars and computers represented by point 
C. With the technology available for making cars and computers, the economy 
does not have enough of the factors of production to support that level of output. 
With the resources it has, the economy can produce at any point on or inside the 
production possibilities frontier, but it cannot produce at points outside the frontier.

An outcome is said to be efficient if the economy is getting all it can from the 
scarce resources it has available. Points on (rather than inside) the production pos￾sibilities frontier represent efficient levels of production. When the economy is 
producing at such a point, say, point A, there is no way to produce more of one good 
without producing less of the other. Point D represents an inefficient outcome. For 
some reason, perhaps widespread unemployment, the economy is producing less 
than it could from the resources it has available: It is producing only 300 cars and 
1,000 computers. If the source of the inefficiency is eliminated, the economy can 
increase its production of both goods. For example, if the economy moves from point 
D to point A, its production of cars increases from 300 to 600, and its production of 
computers increases from 1,000 to 2,200. 
One of the Ten Principles of Economics in Chapter 1 is that people face trade￾offs. The production possibilities frontier shows one trade-off that society faces. 
Once an economy reaches an efficient point on the frontier, the only way to produce 
more of one good is to produce less of the other. When the economy moves from 
point A to point B, for instance, society produces 100 more cars at the expense of 
producing 200 fewer computers. 
This trade-off helps us understand another of the Ten Principles of Economics: 
The cost of something is what you give up to get it. This is called the opportunity 
cost. The production possibilities frontier shows the opportunity cost of one good 
as measured in terms of the other. When society moves from point A to point B, it 
gives up 200 computers to get 100 additional cars. That is, at point A, the opportu￾nity cost of 100 cars is 200 computers. Put another way, the opportunity cost of each 
car is two computers. Notice that the opportunity cost of a car equals the slope of 
the production possibilities frontier. (Slope is discussed in the graphing appendix 
to this chapter.) 
The opportunity cost of a car in terms of the number of computers is not con￾stant in this economy but depends on how many cars and computers the economy 
is producing. This is reflected in the shape of the production possibilities frontier. 
Because the production possibilities frontier in Figure 2 is bowed outward, the 
opportunity cost of a car is highest when the economy is producing many cars and 
few computers, such as at point E, where the frontier is steep. When the economy 
is producing few cars and many computers, such as at point F, the frontier is flatter, 
and the opportunity cost of a car is lower. 
Economists believe that production possibilities frontiers often have this bowed￾out shape. When the economy is using most of its resources to make computers, 
the resources best suited to car production, such as skilled autoworkers, are being 
used in the computer industry. Because these workers probably aren’t very good at 
making computers, increasing car production by one unit will cause only a slight 
reduction in the number of computers produced. Thus, at point F, the opportunity 
cost of a car in terms of computers is small, and the frontier is relatively flat. By 
contrast, when the economy is using most of its resources to make cars, such as at 
point E, the resources best suited to making cars are already at work in the car indus￾try. Producing an additional car now requires moving some of the best computer 
technicians out of the computer industry and turning them into autoworkers. As a 
result, producing an additional car requires a substantial loss of computer output. 
The opportunity cost of a car is high, and the frontier is steep. 
The production possibilities frontier shows the trade-off between the outputs of 
different goods at a given time, but the trade-off can change over time. For exam￾ple, suppose a technological advance in the computer industry raises the number of 
computers that a worker can produce per week. This advance expands society’s set

of opportunities. For any given number of cars, the economy can now make more 
computers. If the economy does not produce any computers, it can still produce 1,000 
cars, so one endpoint of the frontier stays the same. But if the economy devotes some 
of its resources to the computer industry, it will produce more computers from those 
resources. As a result, the production possibilities frontier shifts outward, as in Figure 3. 
This figure shows what happens when an economy grows. Society can move 
production from a point on the old frontier to a point on the new one. Which point 
it chooses depends on its preferences for the two goods. In this example, society 
moves from point A to point G, producing more computers (2,300 instead of 2,200) 
and more cars (650 instead of 600). 
The production possibilities frontier simplifies a complex economy to highlight 
some basic but powerful ideas: scarcity, efficiency, trade-offs, opportunity cost, and 
economic growth. As you study economics, these ideas will recur in various forms. 
The production possibilities frontier offers one simple way of thinking about them. 
2-1f Microeconomics and Macroeconomics 
Many subjects are studied on various levels. Consider biology, for example. 
Molecular biologists study the chemical compounds that make up living things. 
Cellular biologists study cells, which are made up of chemical compounds and, at 
the same time, are themselves the building blocks of living organisms. Evolutionary 
biologists study the diversity of animals and plants and how species gradually 
change over the centuries. 
Economics is also studied on various levels. We can examine the decisions of 
individual households and firms. We can focus on the interaction of households 
and firms in markets for specific goods and services. Or we can study the operation 
of the economy as a whole, encompassing all these activities in all these markets. 
Figure 3 
A Shift in the Production Possibilities Frontier 
A technological advance in the computer 
industry enables the economy to produce more 
computers for any given number of cars. As 
a result, the production possibilities frontier 
shifts outward. If the economy moves from 
point A to point G, the production of both cars 
and computers increases.

Economics is traditionally divided into two broad subfields. Microeconomics 
is the study of how households and firms make decisions and how they inter￾act in specific markets. Macroeconomics is the study of the overall economy. A 
microeconomist might study the effects of rent control on housing in New York 
City, the impact of foreign competition on the U.S. auto industry, or the effects 
of education on workers’ earnings. A macroeconomist might study the effects of 
borrowing by the federal government, the changes in the economy’s unemploy￾ment rate over time, or alternative policies to promote growth in national living 
standards. 
Microeconomics and macroeconomics are closely intertwined. Because changes 
in the overall economy arise from the decisions of millions of individuals, it is 
impossible to understand macroeconomic developments without considering the 
underlying microeconomic decisions. For example, a team of macroeconomists 
might study the effect of a federal income tax cut on the overall production of goods 
and services. But to analyze this issue, they must consider how the tax cut affects 
households’ decisions about how much to spend on goods and services. 
Despite the inherent link befween microeconomics and macroeconomics, the two 
fields are distinct. Because they address different questions, each field has its own 
set of models, which are often taught in separate courses.

2-2 The Economist as Policy Adviser 
Often, economists are asked to explain the causes of economic events. Why, for 
example, is unemployment higher for teenagers than for older workers? That's 
a factual question, and it may be answered scientifically. But sometimes, econo￾mists are asked to recommend policies to improve economic outcomes. What, for 
instance, should the government do to enhance teenagers’ well-being? Answering 
that requires not only an understanding of what's happening but also value judg￾ments about what ought to be done. 
Answers are at the end of the chapter.

Many high-tech companies find that 
expertise in economics is useful in 
their decision malcinp,'. 
Goodbye, Ivory Tower. Hello, 
Silicon Valley Candy Store 
- By Steve Lohr 
or eight years, Jack Coles had an econo￾Fmist's dream job at Harvard Business 
Schoal. 
His research focused on the design of effi￾cient markets, an important and growing field 
that has influenced such things as Treasury 
bill auctions and decisions on who receives 
organ transplants. He even got to work with 
Alvin E. Roth, who won a Nobel in economic 
science in 2012, 
But prestige was not enough to keep Mr. 
Coles at Harvard. In 2013, he moved to the San 
Francisco Bay Area. He now works at Airbnb, the 
online lodging marketplace, one of a number 
of tech companies luring economists with the 
promise of big sets of data and big salaries. 
Silicon Valley is turning to the dismal sci￾ence in its never-ending quest to squeeze more 
money out of old markets and build new ones. 
In turn, the economists say they are eager to 
explore the digital world for fresh insights into 
timeless economic questions of pricing, incen￾tives and behavior. 
“It's an ahsolute candy store for econo￾mists,” Mr. Coles said. . . . 
Businesses have been hiring economists for 
years. Usually, they are asked to study mac￾roeconomic trends—topics like recessions 
and currency exchange rates—and help their 
employers deal with them. 
But what the tech economists are doing is 
different: Instead of thinking about national or 
global trends, they are studying the data trails 
of consumer behavior to help digital compa￾nies make smart decisions that strengthen their 
online marketplaces in areas like advertising, 
movies, music, travel and lodging. 
Tech outfits including giants like Amazon, 
Facebook, Google and Microsoft and up-and￾comers like Airbnb and Uber hope that sort of 
improved efficiency means maore profit. 
At Netflix, Randall Lewis, an economic 
research scientist, is finely measuring the 
effectiveness of advertising. His work also gets 
at the correlation-or-causation conundrum in 
economic behavior: What consumer actions 
occur coincidentally after people see ads, and 
what actions are most likely caused by the ads? 
At Airbnb, Mr. Coles is researching the 
company's marketplace of hosts and guests 
When economists are trying to explain the world, they are scientists. When they 
are giving guidance on how to improve it, they are policy advisers. Even if you never 
become a professional economist, you may find yourself using both sides of your 
economic brain in daily life: analyzing the world as you find it and devising solu￾tions to make things better. Both approaches are indispensable, but it's important 
to understand how they differ. 
2-2a Positive versus Normative Analysis 
To clarify the two roles that economists play, let’s examine the use of language. 
Because scientists and policy advisers have different goals, they use language in 
different ways. 
For example, suppose that two people are discussing minimum-wage laws. Here 
are two statements you might hear: 
Prisha: Minimum-wage laws cause unemployment. 
Noah: The government should raise the minimum wage. 
Ignoring for now whether you agree with these claims, notice that Prisha and Noah 
differ in what they are trying to do. Prisha is speaking like a scientist: She is describ￾ing how the world works. Noah is speaking like a policy adviser: He is talking about 
how he would like to change the world.

for insights, both to help build the business 
and to understand behavior. One study focuses 
on procrastination—a subject of great inter￾est to behavioral economists—hy looking at 
bookings. Are they last-minute? Made weeks or 
months in advance? Do booking habits change 
by age, gender ar country of origin? 
“They are microeconomic experts, heavy on 
data and computing tools like machine learn￾ing and writing algorithms," said Tom Beers, 
executive director of the National Association 
for Business Economics. 
Understanding how digital markets work is 
getting a lot of attention now, said Hal Varian, 
Google's chief economist. But, he said, “| 
thought it was fascinating years ago.” 
Mr. Varian, 63, is the godfather of the tech 
industry's in-house economists. Once a well￾known professor at the University of California, 
Berkeley, Mr. Varian showed up at Google in 
2002, part time at first, but soon became an 
employee. He helped refine Google's AdWords 
marketplace, where advertisers bid o have 
their ads shown on search pages. ... 
For the moment, Amazon seems to be the 
mast aggressive recruiter of economists. It even 
has an Amazon Economists website for soliciting 
résumeés. In a video on the site, Patrick Bajari, 
the company's chief economist, says the eco￾nomics team has contributed to decisions that 
have had “multibillion-dollar impacts” for the 
company. . .. 
A current market-design challenge for 
Amazon and Microsoft is their big cloud com￾puting services. These digital services, for 
example, face a peak-load problem, much as 
electric utilities do. 
How do you sell service at times when 
there is a risk some customers may be 
bumped off? Run an auction for what custom￾ers are willing to pay for interruptible service? 
Or offer set discounts for different levels of 
risk? Both Amazon and Microsoft are working 
on that now.

To answer such questions, economists 
work in teams with computer scientists and 
people in business. In tech companies, market 
design involves not only economics but also 
engineering and marketing. How hard is a 
certain approach technically? How easy is it 
to explain to customers? 
“Economics influences rather than 
determines decisions,” said Preston McAfee, 
Microsoft’s chief economist, who previously 
worked at Google and Yahoo. 
Questions to Discuss 
1. Think of some firms that you often inter￾act with. How might the input of econo￾mists improve their businesses? 
2. After studying economics in college, 
what kind of businesses would be the 
most fun to work for? 
In general, statements about the world come in two types. One type, such as 
Prisha's, is known as positive. That doesn’t mean it is necessarily upbeat or optimis￾tic. Positive statements are descriptive. They make a claim about how the world 
is. A second type of statement, such as Noah's, is known as normative. Normative 
statements are prescriptive. They make a claim about how the world ought to be. 
A key difference between positive and normative statements is how we judge their 
validity. We can, in principle, confirm or refute positive statements by examining 
evidence. An economist might try to evaluate Prisha’s statement by analyzing data 
on changes in minimum wages and unemployment over time. Proving causality 
can be difficult, as we discuss later, but at its root, the issue should be determined 
by the evidence. By contrast, evaluating normative statements involves values as 
well as facts. Noah's statement cannot be judged with data alone. Deciding what is 
good or bad policy is not just a matter of science. It also involves values, and views 
on ethics, religion, and political philosophy may well come into play. 
Positive and normative statements are different but often intertwined. In par￾ticular, positive findings about how the world works can easily affect normative 
judgments about what policies are desirable. Prisha’s claim that the minimum wage 
causes unemployment, if true, might lead her to reject Noah’s conclusion that the 
government should raise the minimum wage. On the other hand, a positive find￾ing that the unemployment effect is small might lead her to accept Noah's policy 
prescription.

“Let’s switch. I'll 
make the policy, you 
implement it, and he’ll 
explain it.” 
Normative judgments may also influence the positive claims that researchers 
choose to study. Noah's desire to raise the minimum wage, for example, may lead 
him to investigate Prisha’s claim that it causes unemployment. To be free of bias, 
he should put aside his normative views and examine the data as objectively as 
possible. At its best, positive economics proceeds as a science independent of the 
researcher’s personal values or policy agenda. 
As you study economics, keep in mind the broad distinction between positive 
and normative statements because it will help you stay focused on the task at 
hand. Much of economics is positive: It just tries to explain how the economy 
works. Yet those who use economics often have normative goals: They want 
to learn how to improve the economy. When you hear economists making nor￾mative statements, you know they are speaking not as scientists but as policy 
advisers. 
2-2b Economists in Washington 
President Harry Truman once said that he wanted to find a one-armed economist. 
When he asked his economists for advice, they always answered, “On the one 
hand, ....On the other hand, ....” 
Truman was right that economists’ advice is not always straightforward. This 
tendency is rooted in one of the Ten Principles of Economics: People face trade-offs. 
Economists are aware that trade-ofts are involved in most policy decisions. A policy 
might increase efficiency at the cost of equality. It might help future generations 
but hurt the current generation. An economist who says that all policy decisions 
are easy is an economist not to be trusted. 
Truman was not the only president who relied on economists’ advice. Since 
1946, the president of the United States has received guidance from the Council of 
Economic Advisers, which consists of three members and a staff of a few dozen 
economists. The council, whose offices are just a few steps from the White House, 
advises the president and writes the annual Econontic Report of the President, which 
discusses recent economic developments and presents the council’s analysis of cur￾rent policy issues. (The author of this textbook was chair of the Council of Economic 
Advisers from 2003 to 2005.) 
The president also receives information and advice from economists in many 
administrative departments. Economists at the Office of Management and 
Budget help formulate spending plans and regulatory policies. Economists at the 
Department of the Treasury help design tax policy. Economists at the Department 
of Labor analyze data on workers and those looking for work to help formulate 
labor-market policies. Economists at the Department of Justice help enforce the 
nation’s antitrust laws. 
Economists in the federal government are also found outside the executive branch. 
To obtain independent evaluations of policy proposals, Congress relies on the advice 
of the Congressional Budget Office, which is staffed by economists. The Federal 
Reserve, the institution that sets the nation’s monetary policy, employs hundreds 
of economists to analyze developments in the United States and around the world. 
The influence of economists on policy goes beyond their role as advisers: Their 
research and writings can affect policy indirectly. The economist John Maynard 
Keynes offered this observation: 
The ideas of economists and political philosophers, both when they are right 
and when they are wrong, are more powerful than is commonly understood.

Indeed, the world is ruled by little else. Practical men, who believe themselves 
to be quite exempt from intellectual influences, are usually the slaves of some 
defunct economist. Madmen in authority, who hear voices in the air, are distill￾ing their frenzy from some academic scribbler of a few years back. 
These words were written in 1935, but they remain true today. Indeed, the “academic 
scribbler” now influencing public policy is often Keynes himself. 
2-2¢ Why Economists’ Advice Is Often Not Followed 
Economists who advise presidents and other elected leaders know that their recom￾mendations are not always heeded. It is easy to understand why. The process by 
which economic policy is actually made differs in many ways from the idealized 
policy process assumed in textbooks. 
Throughout this text, whenever we discuss policy, we often focus on one ques￾tion: What is the best policy for the government to pursue? We act as if policy were 
set by a benevolent and omnipotent king. After the king figures out the right policy, 
he has no trouble putting his ideas into action. 
In the real world, figuring out the right policy is only part of a leader’s job, 
sometimes the easiest part. Imagine that you're the president. After hearing from 
your economic advisers what policy they deem best, yvou turn to others. Your com￾munications advisers will tell you how best to explain the proposed policy to the 
public, and they will try to anticipate any misunderstandings that might make the 
challenge more difficult. Your press advisers will tell you how the news media will 
report on your proposal, what opinions will likely be expressed on editorial pages, 
and what memes may emerge in social media. Your legislative affairs advisers 
will tell you how Congress will view the proposal, what amendments members of 
Congress will suggest, and the likelihood that Congress will enact some version of 
your proposal. Your political advisers will tell you which groups will organize to 
support or oppose the proposed policy, how this proposal will affect your stand￾ing among different groups in the electorate, and whether it will change support 
for other policy initiatives. After weighing all this advice, you then decide how to 
proceed. (And even this picture is idealized; not all recent presidents have proceeded 
in this systematic fashion.) 
Making economic policy in a representative democracy is a messy affair, and there 
are often good reasons why presidents (and other politicians) do not embrace the 
policies that economists advocate. The advice of economists is only one ingredient 
of a complex recipe.

2-3 Why Economists Disagree 
“If all the economists were laid end to end, they would not reach a conclusion.” 
This quip from George Bernard Shaw is revealing. Economists as a group are often 
criticized for giving conflicting advice to policymakers. President Ronald Reagan 
once joked that if the game Trivial Pursuit were designed for economists, it would 
have 100 questions and 3,000 answers. 
Why do economists so often appear to give conflicting advice to policymakers? 
There are two basic reasons: 
¢ Economists may disagree about the validity of alternative positive theories 
of how the world works. 
¢ Economists may have different values and, therefore, different normative 
views about what government policy should aim to accomplish. 
Let’s look more closely at these reasons. 
2-3a Differences in Scientific Judgments 
Several centuries ago, astronomers debated whether the earth or the sun was 
at the center of the solar system. More recently, climatologists have debated 
whether the earth is experiencing global warming and, if so, why. Science is 
an ongoing search to understand the world around us. It is not surprising that 
as the search continues, scientists sometimes disagree about the direction in 
which truth lies. 
Economists often disagree for the same reason. Although the field of economics 
sheds light on much about the world (as you will see throughout this book), there 
is still much to be learned. Sometimes, economists disagree because they have dif￾ferent hunches about the validity of alternative theories. Sometimes, they disagree 
because of different judgments about the size of the parameters that measure how 
economic variables are related. 
For example, economists debate whether the government should tax a house￾hold's income or its consumption (spending). Advocates of a switch from the cur￾rent income tax to a consumption tax believe that the change would encourage 
households to save more because the income that is saved would not be taxed. 
Higher saving, in turn, would free resources for capital accumulation, leading to 
more rapid growth in productivity and living standards. Advocates of the current 
income tax system believe that households would not alter their saving significantly 
in response to a change in the tax laws. These two groups of economists hold dif￾ferent normative views about the tax system because they have different positive 
views about how much saving responds to tax incentives. 
2-3b Differences in Values 
Suppose that Jack and [ill both take the same amount of water from the town well. 
The town taxes its residents to pay for maintaining the well. Jill has an income of 
$150,000 and is taxed $15,000, or 10 percent of her income. Jack has an income of 
$40,000 and is taxed $6,000, or 15 percent of his income. 
Is this policy fair? If not, who pays too much, and who pays too little? Does it 
matter whether Jack’s low income is due to a medical disability or to his decision to 
pursue an acting career? Does it matter whether Jill's high income is due to a large 
inheritance or to her willingness to work long hours at a dreary job?

These are difficult questions about which people are likely to disagree. If the 
town hired two experts to study how it should tax its residents to pay for the well, 
it would not be surprising if they offered conflicting advice. 
This simple example shows why economists sometimes disagree about public 
policy. As we know from our discussion of normative and positive analysis, 
policies cannot be judged on scientific grounds alone. Sometimes, economists 
give conflicting advice because they have different values or political philoso￾phies. Perfecting the science of economics will not tell us whether Jack or Jill 
pays too much. 
2-3¢ Perception versus Reality 
Because of differences in scientific judgments and differences in values, some dis￾agreement among economists is inevitable. Yet one should not overstate the amount 
of disagreement. Economists agree with one another more often than is sometimes 
understood. 
Consider the proposition, “A ceiling on rents reduces the quantity and quality 
of housing available.” When economists were polled about it, 93 percent agreed. 
Economists believe that rent control—a policy that sets a legal maximum on the 
amount landlords can charge for their apartments—adversely affects the supply of 
housing and is a costly way of helping the neediest members of society. Nonetheless, 
many city governments ignore economists’ advice and place ceilings on the rents 
that landlords may charge their tenants. 
Similarly, consider the proposition, “Tariffs and import quotas usually reduce 
general economic welfare.” Once again, 93 percent of economists agreed with the 
claim. Economists oppose tariffs (taxes on imports) and import quotas (limits on 
how much of a good can be purchased from abroad) because these policies impede 
the specialization that raises living standards both at home and abroad. Nonetheless, 
over the years, presidents and Congress have often chosen to restrict the import 
of certain goods. 
Why do policies such as rent control and trade barriers persist if the experts are 
united in their opposition? It may be that the realities of the political process stand 
as immovable obstacles. But it also may be that economists 
have not yet convinced enough of the public that these poli￾cies are undesirable. One purpose of this book is to help you 
understand the economist’s view on these and other subjects Ask the Ticket Resale Experts and, perhaps, to persuade you that it is the right one. 
As you read this book, you will occasionally see small 
boxes called “Ask the Experts.” These are based on the IGM 
Economic Experts Panel, an ongoing survey of several dozen 
prominent economists. Every few weeks, these experts are 
offered a proposition and then asked whether they agree 
“Laws that limit the resale of tickels for entertainment and 
sports events make potential audience members for those 
events worse off on average.”

to entertainment and sporting events. Lawmakers sometimes

2-4 Let’s Get Going 
The first two chapters of this book have introduced you to the ideas and methods of 
economics. We are now ready to get to work. In the next chapter, we start learning 
in more detail the principles of economic behavior and policy. 
As you proceed through this book, you will be asked to draw on many intel￾lectual skills. You might find it helpful to keep in mind some advice from the great 
economist John Maynard Keynes: 
The study of economics does not seem to require any specialized gifts of an 
unusually high order. Is it not . . . a very easy subject compared with the higher 
branches of philosophy or pure science? An easy subject, at which very few 
excel! The paradox finds its explanation, perhaps, in that the master-economist 
must possess a rare combination of gifts. He must be mathematician, historian, 
statesman, philosopher—in some degree. He must understand symbols and 
speak in words. He must contemplate the particular in terms of the general, 
and touch abstract and concrete in the same flight of thought. He must study 
the present in the light of the past for the purposes of the future. No part of 
man'’s nature or his institutions must lie entirely outside his regard. He must be 
purposeful and disinterested in a simultaneous mood; as aloof and incorrupt￾ible as an artist, yet sometimes as near the earth as a politician. 
This is a tall order. But with practice, you will become more and more accustomed 
to thinking like an economist.

Chapter 2 Thinking Like an Economist 33 
Economists who advise policymakers sometimes offer 
conflicting advice either because of differences in sci￾entific judgments or because of differences in values. 
At other times, economists are united in the advice 
they offer, but policymakers may choose to ignore 
the advice because of the many forces and constraints 
imposed on them by the political process.

Graphing: A Brief Review 
Many economic concepts can be expressed with numbers—the price of bananas, 
the quantity of bananas sold, the cost of growing bananas, and so on. Often, these 
variables are related to one another: When the price of bananas rises, people buy 
fewer bananas. One way to express these relationships is with graphs. 
Graphs serve two purposes. First, when developing theories, they offer a visual 
way to express ideas that might be less clear if described with equations or words. 
Second, when analyzing data, graphs provide a powerful way of finding and inter￾preting patterns. In either case, graphs provide a lens through which a recognizable 
forest emerges from a multitude of trees. 
Numerical information can be expressed graphically in many ways, just as there 
are many ways to express a thought in words. A good writer chooses words that will 
make an argument clear, a description pleasing, or a scene dramatic. An effective 
economist chooses the type of graph that best suits the purpose at hand. 
This appendix discusses how economists use graphs to study the mathematical 
relationships among variables. It also points out some of the pitfalls that can arise 
when using graphical methods.

The time-series graph in panel (c) traces the rising productivity in the U.5. business 
sector over time. The height of the line shows output per hour in each year. You 
have probably seen similar graphs in news reports. 
Graphs of Two Variables: The Coordinate System 
The three graphs in Figure A-1 are useful, but they are limited in how much they can 
tell us. These graphs display information about only a single variable. If economists 
are looking at the relationships between variables, they may want to display two 
variables on a single graph. The coordinate system makes this possible. 
Suppose you want to examine the relationship between study time and grade point 
average. For each student in a class, you could record a pair of numbers: study hours 
per week and grade point average. These numbers could then be placed in parentheses 
as an ordered pair and appear as a single point on the graph. Albert E., for instance, is 
represented by the ordered pair (25 hours /week, 3.5 GPA), while his “what-me-worry?” 
classmate Alfred E. is represented by the ordered pair (5 hours/week, 2.0 GPA). 
We can graph these ordered pairs on a two-dimensional grid. The first number 
in each ordered pair, called the x-coordinate, tells us the horizontal location of the 
point. The second number, called the y-coordinate, tells us the vertical location. The 
point with both an x-coordinate and a y-coordinate of zero is called the origin. The 
two coordinates in the ordered pair tell us where the point is located in relation to 
the origin: x units to the right of the origin and y units above it. 
Figure A-2 graphs grade point average against study time for Albert E., Alfred 
E., and their classmates. This type of graph is called a scatter plot because it plots 
scattered points. Looking at the graph, notice that points farther to the right (indi￾cating more study time) also tend to be higher (indicating a better grade point 
average). Because study time and grade point average typically move in the same

if we were to graph party time and grades, we would likely find that higher party 
time is associated with lower grades. Because these variables typically move in 
opposite directions, we say that they have a negative correlation. In either case, 
the coordinate system makes the correlation between two variables easy to see. 
Curves in the Coordinate System 
Students who study more do tend to get higher grades, but other factors also influ￾ence a student’s grades. Previous preparation is an important factor, for instance, as 
is talent, attention from teachers, or even eating a good breakfast. A scatter plot like 
Figure A-2 does not attempt to isolate the effect that studying has on grades from 
the effects of other variables. Often, however, economists prefer looking at how one 
variable affects another, holding all other possible variables constant. 
To see how this is done, consider one of the most important graphs in econom￾ics: the demand curve. The demand curve traces the effect of a good’s price on the 
quantity that consumers want to buy. Before showing a demand curve, however, 
consider Table A-1, which shows how the number of novels that Emma buys depends 
on her income and on the price of novels. When novels are cheap, Emma buys a 
lot of them. As they become more expensive, she instead borrows books from the 
library or goes to the movies rather than read. Similarly, at any price, Emma buys 
more novels when she has a higher income. That is, when her income increases, she 
spends part of the additional income on novels and part on other goods. 
We now have three variables—the price of novels, income, and the number of 
novels purchased—which is more than can be shown in two dimensions. To put 
the information from Table A-1 in graphical form, we need to hold one of the three 
variables constant and trace out the relationship between the other two. Because the 
demand curve represents the relationship between price and quantity demanded, 
we hold Emma’s income constant and show how the number of novels she buys 
varies with the price of novels. 
Suppose that Emma’s income is $40,000 per year. If we place the number of novels 
Emma buys on the x-axis and the price of novels on the y-axis, we can graphically 
represent the middle column of Table A-1. When the points that represent these

entries from the table—(5 novels, 510), (9 novels, $9), and so on—are connected, they 
form a line. This line, pictured in Figure A-3, is known as Emma’s demand curve 
for novels; it tells us how many novels Emma buys at any price, holding income 
constant. The demand curve slopes down, indicating that a lower price increases 
the quantity of novels demanded. Because the quantity of novels demanded and 
the price move in opposite directions, we say that the two variables are negatively 
related. (Conversely, when two variables move in the same direction, the curve 
relating them slopes up, and we say that the variables are positively related.) 
Now suppose Emma’s income rises to 550,000 per year. At any price, Emma buys 
more novels than she did at her previous income. Just as we earlier drew Emma’s 
demand curve for novels using the entries from the middle column of Table A-1, 
we now draw a new demand curve using the entries from the right column of the 
table. This new demand curve (curve D,) is pictured alongside the old one (curve 
D,) in Figure A-4; the new curve is a similar line drawn farther to the right. We 
therefore say that Emma’s demand curve for novels shifts to the right when her 
income increases. Likewise, if Emma’s income were to fall to $30,000 per vear, she 
would buy fewer novels at any price, and her demand curve would shift to the left 
(to curve D,). 
In economics, it is important to distinguish between movements along a curve 
and shifts of a curve. As Figure A-3 shows, if Emma earns $40,000 per year and 
each novel costs $8, she buys 13 novels per year. If the price of novels falls to $7, 
Emma increases her purchases to 17 novels per vear. The demand curve, however, 
stays fixed in the same place. Emma still buys the same number of novels at each 
price, but as the price falls, she moves along her demand curve from left to right.

By contrast, if the price of novels remains fixed at $8 but her income rises to $50,000, 
Emma increases her purchases of novels from 13 to 16 per year. Because Emma buys 
more novels at each price, her demand curve shifts out, as shown in Figure A-4. 
There is a simple way to tell when it is necessary to shift a curve: When a relevant 
variable that is not named on either axis changes, the curve shifts. Income is on 
neither the x-axis nor the y-axis of the graph, so when Emma’s income changes, 
her demand curve shifts. The same is true for any change that affects Emma’s 
purchasing habits, with the sole exception of a change in the price of novels. If, for 
instance, the public library closes and Emma must buy all the books she wants to 
read, she will demand more novels at each price, and her demand curve will shift 
to the right. Or, if the price of movies falls and Emma spends more time watching 
them and less time reading books, she will demand fewer novels at each price, and 
her demand curve will shift to the left. By contrast, when a variable on an axis of 
the graph changes, the curve does not shift. We read the change as a movement 
along the curve. 
Slope 
One question we might want to ask about Emma is how much her purchas￾ing habits respond to changes in price. Look at the demand curve pictured in 
Figure A-5. If this curve is very steep, Emma buys nearly the same number of 
novels whether they are cheap or expensive. If the curve is much flatter, the 
number of novels she buys is more sensitive to price changes. To answer ques￾tions about how much one variable responds to changes in another, we can use 
the concept of slope.

The slope of a line is the ratio of the vertical distance covered to the horizontal 
distance covered as we move along the line. This definition is usually written in 
mathematical symbols as follows: 
_ Ay 
CAx' 
where the Greek letter A (delta) stands for the change in a variable. In other words, the 
slope of a line is equal to the “rise” (change in y) divided by the “run” (change in x). 
For an upward-sloping line, the slope is a positive number because the changes 
in x and ¥ move in the same direction: If x increases, so does y, and if x decreases, 
so does y. For a fairly flat upward-sloping line, the slope is a small positive number. 
For a steep upward-sloping line, the slope is a large positive number. 
For a downward-sloping line, the slope is a negative number because the 
changes in x and y move in opposite directions: If x increases, v decreases, and 
if x decreases, y increases. For a fairly flat downward-sloping line, the slope is a 
small negative number. For a steep downward-sloping line, the slope is a large 
negative number. 
A horizontal line has a slope of zero because, in this case, the y-variable never 
changes. A vertical line is said to have an infinite slope because the y-variable can 
take any value without the x-variable changing at all. 
What is the slope of Emma’s demand curve for novels? First of all, because the 
curve slopes down, we know the slope will be negative. To calculate a numerical 
value for the slope, choose two points on the line. With Emma’s income at $40,000, 
she buys 13 novels at a price of $8 or 21 novels at a price of $6. When we apply the 
slope

Figure A-5 shows graphically how this calculation works. Try computing the slope 
of Emma’s demand curve using two different points. You should get the same 
result, - 4. One of the properties of a straight line is that it has the same slope 
everywhere. This is not true of other types of curves, which are steeper in some 
places than in others. 
The slope of Emma’s demand curve tells us something about how responsive 
her purchases are to changes in the price. A small slope (a negative number close 
to zero) means that Emma’s demand curve is relatively flat; in this case, she adjusts 
the number of novels she buys substantially in response to a price change. A larger 
slope (a negative number farther from zero) means that Emma’s demand curve is 
relatively steep; in this case, she adjusts the number of novels she buys only slightly 
in response to a price change. 
Cause and Effect 
Economists often use graphs to advance an argument about how the economy 
works. In other words, they use graphs to argue about how one set of events causes 
another set of events. With a graph like the demand curve, there is no doubt about 
the cause and effect. Because we are varying price and holding all other variables 
constant, we know that changes in the price of novels cause changes in the quantity 
Emma demands. Remember, however, that our demand curve came from a hypo￾thetical example. When graphing data from the real world, it is often more difficult 
to establish how one variable affects another. 
The first problem is that it is difficult to hold everything else constant when 
studying the relationship between two variables. If we are not able to hold other 
variables constant, we might decide that one variable on our graph is causing chang￾es in the other variable when those changes are actually being caused by a third 
omitted variable not pictured on the graph. Even if we have identified the correct 
two variables to look at, we might run into a second problem—reverse causality. 
In other words, we might decide that A causes B when, in fact, B causes A, The

4142 Part | Introduction 
omitted-variable and reverse-causality traps require us to proceed with caution 
when using graphs to draw conclusions about causes and effects. 
Omitted Variables To see how omitting a variable can lead to a deceptive graph, 
consider an example. Imagine that the government, spurred by public concern about 
the large number of deaths from cancer, commissions an exhaustive study from 
Big Brother Statistical Services, Inc. Big Brother examines many of the items found 
in people’s homes to see which of them are associated with the risk of cancer. Big 
Brother reports a strong relationship between two variables: the number of cigarette 
lighters that a household owns and the probability that someone in the household 
will develop cancer. Figure A-6 shows this relationship. 
What should we make of this result? Big Brother advises a quick policy response. 
It recommends that the government discourage the ownership of cigarette light￾ers by taxing their sale. It also recommends that the government require warning 
labels: “Big Brother has determined that this lighter is dangerous to your health.” 
In judging the validity of Big Brother’s analysis, one question is key: Has Big 
Brother held constant every relevant variable except the one under consideration? 
If the answer is no, the results are suspect. An easy explanation for Figure A-6 is 
that people who own more cigarette lighters are more likely to smoke cigarettes 
and that cigarettes, not lighters, cause cancer. If Figure A-6 does not hold constant 
the amount of smoking—and it doesn’t because Big Brother never looked at that 
variable—it does not tell us the true effect of owning a cigarette lighter. 
This story illustrates an important principle: When you see a graph used to sup￾port an argument about cause and effect, it is important to ask whether the move￾ments of an omitted variable could explain the results you see. 
Reverse Causality Economists can also make mistakes about causality by misread￾ing its direction. To see how this is possible, suppose the Association of American 
Anarchists commissions a study of crime in America and arrives at Figure A-7, 
which plots the number of violent crimes per thousand people in major cities against 
the number of police officers per thousand people. The Anarchists note the curve’s 
upward slope and argue that because police increase rather than decrease the amount 
of urban violence, law enforcement should be abolished. 
Figure A-7, however, does not prove the Anarchists” point. The graph simply 
shows that more dangerous cities have more police officers. The explanation may 
be that more dangerous cities hire more police. In other words, rather than police

causing crime, crime may cause police. We could avoid the danger of reverse cau￾sality by running a controlled experiment. In this case, we would randomly assign 
different numbers of police to different cities and then examine the correlation 
between police and crime. Without such an experiment, establishing the direction 
of causality is difficult at best. 
It might seem that we could determine the direction of causality by examining 
which variable moves first. If crime increases and then the police force expands, we 
reach one conclusion. If the police force expands and then crime increases, we reach 
the other conclusion. This approach, however, is also flawed: Often, people change 
their behavior not in response to a change in their present conditions but in response 
to a change in their expectations about future conditions. A city that expects a major 
crime wave in the future, for instance, might hire more police now. This problem 
is easier to see in the case of babies and minivans. Couples often buy a minivan 
in anticipation of the birth of a child. The minivan comes before the baby, but we 
wouldn’t want to conclude that the sale of minivans causes the population to grow! 
There is no complete set of rules that says when it is appropriate to draw causal 
conclusions from graphs. Yet just keeping in mind that cigarette lighters don’t cause 
cancer (omitted variable) and that minivans don’t cause larger families (reverse 
causality) will keep you from falling for many faulty economic arguments.

In later chapters, we examine how an economy coordinates the activities of mil￾lions of people with varying tastes and abilities. As a starting point, this chapter 
considers the reasons for economic interdependence. One of the Ten Principles of 
Economics in Chapter 1 is that trade can make everyone better off. We now examine 
this principle more closely. What exactly do people gain when they trade with one 
another? Why do people become interdependent? 
The answers to these questions are key to understanding the global economy. 
Most countries today import from abroad many of the goods and services they 
consume, and they export to foreign customers much of what they produce. The 
analysis in this chapter explains interdependence not only among individuals but 
also among nations. As we will see, the gains from trade are much the same whether 
you are buying a haircut from your local barber or a T-shirt made on the other side 
of the globe. 
3-1 A Parable for the Modern Economy 
To understand how people benefit when they rely on one another for goods and 
services, let's examine a simple economy. Imagine that there are only two goods 
in the world: meat and potatoes. And there are only two people: a cattle rancher 
named Ruby and a potato farmer named Frank. Both Ruby and Frank would like 
to eat a diet of both meat and potatoes. 
The gains from trade are clearest if Ruby can produce only meat and Frank can 
produce only potatoes. In one scenario, Frank and Ruby could choose to have 
nothing to do with each other. But after several months of eating beef roasted, 
broiled, seared, and grilled, Ruby might decide that self-sufficiency is not all it’s 
cracked up to be. Frank, who has been eating potatoes mashed, fried, baked, and 
scalloped, would likely agree. It is easy to see that trade would allow both of 
them to enjoy greater variety: Each could then have a steak with a baked potato 
or a burger with fries. 
Although this scene shows most simply how everyone can benefit from trade, 
the gains would be similar if Frank and Ruby were each capable of producing the 
other good, but only at great cost. Suppose, for example, that Ruby can grow pota￾toes, but her land is not well suited for it. Similarly, suppose that Frank can raise 
cattle and produce meat but is not good at it. In this case, Frank and Ruby benefit 
by specializing in what they do best and then trading with each other. 
The gains are less obvious, however, when one person is better at producing 
everything. For example, imagine that Ruby is better at raising cattle and at grow￾ing potatoes. In this case, should Ruby remain self-sufficient? Or is there still a 
reason for her to trade with Frank? Let’s look more closely at the factors that affect 
such a decision. 
3-1a Production Possibilities 
Suppose that Frank and Ruby each work 8 hours per day and can use this time 
to grow potatoes, raise cattle, or engage in a combination of the two. The table in 
Figure 1 shows the amount of time each person requires to produce 1 ounce of each 
good. Frank produces an ounce of potatoes in 15 minutes and an ounce of meat in 
60 minutes. Ruby, who is better in both activities, can produce an ounce of potatoes 
in 10 minutes and an ounce of meat in 20 minutes. The last two columns show how 
much they can each produce if they devote all 8 hours to producing only meat or 
potatoes.

Panel (b) of Figure 1 illustrates the amounts of meat and potatoes that Frank can 
produce. If he spends all 8 hours growing potatoes, Frank produces 32 ounces of 
potatoes (measured on the horizontal axis) and no meat. If he spends all of his time 
raising cattle, he produces 8 ounces of meat (measured on the vertical axis) and no 
potatoes. If Frank divides his time equally between the two activities, spending 4 
hours on each, he produces 16 ounces of potatoes and 4 ounces of meat. The figure 
shows these three outcomes and all others in between. 
This graph is Frank’s production possibilities frontier. As we discussed in 
Chapter 2, a production possibilities frontier shows the mixes of output that an 
economy can produce. It illustrates one of the Ten Principles of Economics in 
Chapter 1: People face trade-offs. Here, Frank faces a trade-off between producing 
meat and producing potatoes. 
You may recall that the production possibilities frontier in Chapter 2 was 
drawn bowed out. In that case, the rate at which society could trade one good for 
the other depended on the amounts that were being produced. Here, however, 
Frank can switch between the production of meat and potatoes (summarized in 
) 43

Figure 1) at a constant rate. When Frank cuts 1 hour from producing meat and 
adds 1 hour to producing potatoes, he reduces his meat output by 1 ounce and 
raises his potato output by 4 ounces, and this is true regardless of how much 
he is already producing. As a result, the production possibilities frontier is a 
straight line. 
Panel (c) of Figure 1 shows Ruby’s production possibilities frontier. If she only 
grows potatoes, Ruby produces 48 ounces of them and no meat. If she only raises 
cattle, she produces 24 ounces of meat and no potatoes. If Ruby divides her time 
equally, spending 4 hours on each activity, she produces 24 ounces of potatoes and 
12 ounces of meat. Once again, the production possibilities frontier shows all pos￾sible outcomes. 
If Frank and Ruby remain self-sufficient instead of trading with each other, each 
consumes exactly what he or she produces. In this case, the production possibilities 
frontier is also the consumption possibilities frontier. That is, without trade, Figure 1 
shows the possible combinations of meat and potatoes that Frank and Ruby can 
each produce and then consume. 
These production possibilities frontiers are useful in showing the trade-offs that 
Frank and Ruby face, but they do not tell us what each will choose to do. For that, 
we need to know something about their dietary preferences. Suppose that Frank 
and Ruby choose the combinations identified by points A and B in Figure 1. Based 
on his opportunities and tastes, Frank decides to produce and consume 16 ounces 
of potatoes and 4 ounces of meat, while Ruby decides to produce and consume 
24 punces of potatoes and 12 ounces of meat. 
3-1b Specialization and Trade 
After several years of eating combination B, Ruby gets an idea and visits Frank: 
Ruby: Frank, my friend, have | got a deal for you! We can improve life 
for both of us. You should stop producing meat altogether and 
just grow potatoes. According to my calculations, if you do that 
for 8 hours a day, you'll produce 32 ounces of potatoes. You can 
then give me 15 of those 32 ounces, and I'll give you 5 ounces of 
meat in return. It's great! You'll eat 17 ounces of potatoes and 
5 ounces of meat every day instead of the 16 ounces of potatoes 
and 4 ounces of meat you eat now. With my plan, you'll have 
more of both foods. [To illustrate her point, Ruby shows Frank 
panel (a) of Figure 2.] 
Frank: (sounding skeptical): That seems like a good deal for me. But [ don’t 
understand why vou are offering it. If the deal is so good for me, it 
can't be good for you too. 
Ruby: Oh, but it is! Suppose I spend 6 hours a day raising cattle and 
2 hours growing potatoes. Then I can produce 18 ounces of meat 
and 12 ounces of potatoes. After I give you 5 ounces of my meat 
in exchange for 15 ounces of your potatoes, I'll end up with 
13 ounces of meat and 27 ounces of potatoes instead of the 
12 ounces of meat and 24 ounces of potatoes that I have now. So | 
will also consume more of both foods than I do now. [She points 
out panel (b) of Figure 2.] 
Frank: I don’t know. ... This sounds too good to be true.

3-2 Comparative Advantage: The Driving Force of Specialization 
absolute advantage 
the ability to produce a 
good using fewer inputs 
than another producer 
opportunity cost 
whatever must be given 
up to obtain some item 
Ruby’s explanation of the gains from trade, though correct, poses a puzzle: If Ruby 
is better at both raising cattle and growing potatoes, how can Frank ever specialize 
in doing what he does best? Frank doesn’t seem to do anything best. To solve this 
puzzle, we need to look at the principle of comparative advantage. 
As a first step, consider the following question: In our example, who can produce 
potatoes at a lower cost—Frank or Ruby? There are two possible answers, and in 
them lies the key to understanding the gains from trade. 
3-2a Absolute Advantage 
One way to answer the question about the cost of producing potatoes is to compare 
the inputs each producer requires. Economists use the term absolute advantage 
when comparing the productivity of one person, firm, or nation to that of another. 
The producer that requires a smaller quantity of inputs to produce a good is said 
to have an absolute advantage in producing that good. 
In our simple example, time is the only input, so it is all we need to examine 
to determine absolute advantage. Ruby has an absolute advantage in produc￾ing both meat and potatoes because she requires less time than Frank to pro￾duce a unit of either good. She needs only 20 minutes to produce an ounce of 
meat, while Frank needs 60 minutes. Similarly, it takes Ruby only 10 minutes 
to produce an ounce of potatoes, while it takes Frank 15 minutes. Thus, if cost 
is measured in terms of the quantity of inputs, Ruby produces potatoes at a 
lower cost. 
3-2b Opportunity Cost and Comparative Advantage 
There is another way to look at the cost of producing potatoes. Rather than 
focusing on the inputs required, we can examine the opportunity costs. Recall 
from Chapter 1 that the opportunity cost of an item is what you give up to 
get that item. We have assumed that Frank and Ruby each work 8 hours a day. 
Time spent producing potatoes takes away from time available for producing 
meat. When reallocating time between the two goods, Ruby and Frank give up

units of one good to produce units of the other, moving along the production 
possibilities frontier. The opportunity cost measures the trade-off that each 
producer faces. 
First, consider Ruby’s opportunity cost. According to the table in panel (a) of 
Figure 1, it takes her 10 minutes to grow 1 ounce of potatoes, time that she isn't 
using to produce meat. Because Ruby needs 20 minutes to produce 1 ounce of 
meat, 10 minutes would yield ¥ ounce of meat. Hence, Ruby’s opportunity cost of 
producing 1 ounce of potatoes is % ounce of meat. 
Next, consider Frank's situation. Producing 1 ounce of potatoes takes him 
15 minutes. Because he needs 60 minutes to produce 1 ounce of meat, 15 minutes 
would yield % ounce of meat. Hence, Frank's opportunity cost of producing 1 ounce 
of potatoes is ¥ ounce of meat. 
Table 1 shows the opportunity costs of meat and potatoes for each of them. 
Notice that the opportunity cost of meat is the inverse of the opportunity cost of 
potatoes. Because 1 ounce of potatoes costs Ruby % ounce of meat, it is also true 
that 1 ounce of meat costs her 2 ounces of potatoes. Similarly, because 1 ounce 
of potatoes costs Frank ¥ ounce of meat, 1 ounce of meat costs him 4 ounces of 
potatoes. 
Economists use the term comparative advantage when describing the oppor- ~ comparative advantage 
tunity costs faced by two producers. The producer who gives up less of the other the ability to produce 
good to produce Good X has the smaller opportunity cost of producing Good Xand a good at a lower 
is said to have a comparative advantage in producing it. In our example, Frank has opportunity cost than 
a lower opportunity cost of producing potatoes than Ruby: An ounce of potatoes another producer 
costs Frank only '4 ounce of meat but costs Ruby 2 ounce of meat. Conversely, 
Ruby has a lower opportunity cost of producing meat than Frank: An ounce of meat 
costs Ruby 2 ounces of potatoes but costs Frank 4 ounces of potatoes. Thus, Frank 
has a comparative advantage in growing potatoes, and Ruby has a comparative 
advantage in producing meat. 
Although it is possible for a person to have an absolute advantage in both goods 
(as Ruby does in our example), it is impossible for a person to have a comparative 
advantage in both goods. Because the opportunity cost of one good is the inverse 
of the opportunity cost of the other, if a person’s opportunity cost of one good is 
relatively high, his or her opportunity cost of the other good must be relatively 
low. Unless two people have the same opportunity cost, one person will have a 
comparative advantage in one good, and the other person will have a comparative 
advantage in the other good.

3-2¢ Comparative Advantage and Trade 
The gains from specialization and trade are based on comparative advantage. When 
people produce goods in which they have a comparative advantage, total production 
rises. The economic pie grows larger. Depending on how this bounty is divided, 
everyone can be better off. 
Once they start to trade, Frank spends more time growing potatoes, and Ruby 
works more on producing meat. Total potato production increases from 40 to 
44 punces, and total meat production increases from 16 to 18 ounces. Frank and 
Ruby share the benefits of the greater production. 
The gains are reflected in the implicit prices that the trading partners pay each 
other. Because Frank and Ruby have different opportunity costs, they both get a 
bargain. That is, each of them benefits from trade by obtaining a good at a price 
that is lower than his or her opportunity cost of that good. 
Consider the deal from Frank's viewpoint. He receives 5 ounces of meat in 
exchange for 15 ounces of potatoes. In other words, Frank buys each ounce of meat 
for a price of 3 ounces of potatoes. This price of meat is lower than his opportunity 
cost of an ounce of meat, which is 4 ounces of potatoes. Frank benefits from the deal 
because he gets to buy meat at a good price. 
Now consider Ruby’s viewpoint. She gets 15 ounces of potatoes in exchange 
for 5 ounces of meat. That is, the price of an ounce of potatoes is ¥: ounce of meat. 
This price of potatoes is lower than her opportunity cost of an ounce of potatoes, 
which is ¥2 ounce of meat. Ruby benefits because she gets to buy potatoes at a 
good price. 
The story of Ruby the rancher and Frank the farmer has a simple moral: Trade 
can benefit everyone because it allows people to specialize in the activities in 
which they have a comparative advantage. 
3-2d The Price of the Trade 
The principle of comparative advantage helps to explain the gains from specializa￾tion and trade, but it raises a couple of related questions: What determines the price 
at which trade takes place? How are the gains shared between the trading parties? 
The precise answers to these questions are beyond the scope of this chapter, but 
here is a general rule: For both parties to gain from trade, the price at which they 
trade must lie between their opportunity costs. 
In our example, Frank and Ruby agreed to trade at a rate of 3 ounces of pota￾toes per ounce of meat. This price is between Ruby’s opportunity cost (2 ounces 
of potatoes per ounce of meat) and Frank’s opportunity cost (4 ounces of potatoes 
per ounce of meat). The price need not be exactly in the middle for both parties to 
gain, but it must be somewhere between 2 and 4. 
Consider what would happen at prices outside this range. If meat was priced 
below 2 ounces of potatoes, both Frank and Ruby would want to buy meat because 
it would cost less than each of their opportunity costs. Similarly, if meat was priced 
above 4 ounces of potatoes, both would want to sell meat because the price would 
be above their opportunity costs. But they cannot both be buyers of meat, nor can 
they both be sellers. Someone must take the other side of the deal. Trade doesn’t 
work at these prices. 
A mutually advantageous trade can be struck at prices between 2 and 4. In this 
range, Ruby wants to sell meat to buy potatoes, and Frank wants to sell potatoes 
to buy meat. They both get to buy a good at a price below their opportunity cost of 
that good. In the end, they specialize in the good in which they have a comparative 
advantage, and, as a result, both of them are better off.

Here is how the great economist Adam Smith put the argument for the 
gains from trade: 
It is a maxim of every prudent master of a family, never to 
attempt to make at home what it will cost him more to make 
than to buy. The tailor does not attempt to make his own 
shoes, but buys themn of the shoemaker. The shoemaker does 
not attempt to make his own clothes but employs a tailor. The 
farmer attempts to make nei￾ther the cne nor the other, but 
employs those different artifi￾cers. All of them find it for their 
interest to employ their whole 
industry in a way in which they 
have some advantage over their 
neighbors, and to purchase with 
a part of its produce, or what is 
the same thing, with the price 
of part of it, whatever else they 
have occasion for,

David Ricardo 
This quotation is from Smith's 1776 book The Wealth of Nations, which 
was a landmark in the analysis of frade and economic interdependence. 
Smith’s book inspired David Ricardo, a millionaire stockbroker, to 
become an economist. In his 1817 book On the Principles of Political 
Economy and Taxation, Ricardo developed the principle of comparative 
advantage as we know it today. He considered an example with two goods 
(wine and cloth) and two countries (England and Portugal). He showed 
that both countries could gain by opening trade and specializing. 
While Ricarda's theory is the starting point of modern international 
economics, his defense of free trade was not merely an academic exercise. 
He put his findings to work as a member of the British Parliament, where 
he opposed the Corn Laws, which restricted grain imports. 
The conclusions of Smith and Ricardo on the gains from trade have 
held up well over time. Although economists often disagree on questions 
of policy, they are nearly united in their support of free trade. Moreover, 
the central argument has not changed much in the past two centuries, 
Even though the field of economics has broadened its scope and refined 
its theories, economists’ opposition to trade restrictions is still based 
largely on the principle of comparative advantage. B

3-3 Applications of Comparative Advantage 
The principle of comparative advantage explains interdependence and the gains 
from trade. Because interdependence is so prevalent, the principle of comparative 
advantage has many applications. Here are two examples, one fanciful and one of 
great prac tical im]}urtance.

3-3a Should Naomi Osaka Mow Her 
Own Lawn? 
Naomi Osaka is a great athlete. One of the best tennis 
players of the current era, she can run faster and hit a ball 
harder than most other people. Most likely, she is talented 
at other physical activities as well. For example, let’s imag￾ine that Osaka can mow her lawn faster than anyone else. 
But just because she can mow her lawn quickly, does this 
mean she should? If she enjoys mowing as a favorite form 
of relaxation, then of course she should. Otherwise, she 
can reach a better outcome by applying the concepts of 
opportunity cost and comparative advantage. 
Let’s say that Osaka can mow her lawn in 2 hours. In 
Naomi Osaka may be good at pushing a lawn- those same 2 hours, she could film a television commercial 
mower, but it's not her comparative advantage. and earn $30,000. By contrast, Hari, the boy next door, can

goods produced abroad 
and sold domestically 
exports 
goods produced domesti￾cally and sold abroad 
mow Osaka’s lawn in 4 hours. In those same 4 hours, Hari 
could work at McDonald’s and earn $50. 
Osaka has an absolute advantage in mowing lawns because she can do the work 
in less time. Yet because her opportunity cost of mowing the lawn is $30,000 and 
Hari’s is only $50, Hari has a comparative advantage in mowing lawns. 
The gains from trade here are tremendous. Rather than mowing her own lawn, 
(saka should film the commercial and hire Hari to mow the lawn. As long as Osaka 
pays Hari more than $50 and less than $30,000, both are better off. 
3-3b Should the United States Trade with Other Countries? 
Just as individuals can benefit from specialization and trade with one another, so 
can countries. Many of the goods that Americans enjoy are produced abroad, and 
many of the goods produced in the United States are sold abroad. Goods produced 
abroad and sold domestically are imports. Those produced domestically and sold 
abroad are exports. 
Let’s focus on the United States and Japan, both of which produce food and cars. 
Imagine that they produce cars equally well: An American worker and a Japanese 
worker can each produce one car per month. By contrast, because the United States 
has more fertile land, it is better at producing food: A U.S. worker can produce 
2 tons of food per month, while a Japanese worker can produce only 1 ton of food 
per month. 
The principle of comparative advantage states that each good should be pro￾duced by the country with the lower opportunity cost of producing that good. 
Because the opportunity cost of a car is 2 tons of food in the United States but only 
1 ton of food in Japan, Japan has a comparative advantage in producing cars. Japan 
should produce more cars than it wants for its own use and export some of them 
to the United States. Similarly, because the opportunity cost of a ton of food is 1 car 
in Japan but only % car in the United States, the United States has a comparative 
advantage in producing food. The United States should produce more food than 
it wants to consume and export some to Japan. Through specialization and trade, 
both countries can have more food and more cars. 
To be sure, the issues involved in trade among nations are more complex 
than this simple example suggests. Most importantly, each country has many 
people, and trade affects them in different ways. When the United States exports 
food and imports cars, the impact on an American farmer is not the same as the

As a result, interna￾tional trade can make some individuals worse off, even 
as it makes the country as a whole better off. Yet this 
example teaches an important lesson: Contrary to the 
opinions sometimes voiced by politicians and pundits, 
international trade is not like war, in which some coun￾tries win and others lose. Trade allows all countries to 
achieve greater prosperity. 
3-4 Conclusion 
The benefits of living in an interdependent economy are 
enormous. When Americans buy tube socks from China, 
when residents of Maine drink orange juice from Florida, 
and when homeowners hire local kids to mow their 
lawns, the same economic forces are at work. The prin￾ciple of comparative advantage shows that trade can make 
everyone better off. 
Having seen why interdependence is desirable, you 
might ask how it is possible. How do free societies coor￾dinate the diverse activities of all the people involved in 
their economies? What ensures that goods and services 
will get from those who should be producing them to 
those who should be consuming them? In a world with 
only two people, such as Ruby and Frank, the answer is 
simple: They can bargain and allocate resources directly. 
In the real world, with billions of people, the task is far 
more complex. As we will see in the next chapter, most 
economies allocate resources using the market forces of 
supply and demand.

An economist argues that you 
shouldn't always unload the dishwasher 
just because you're better at it than 
your partner. 
You're Dividing the Chores 
Wrong 
By Emily Oster 
o one likes doing chores. In happiness 
Nsur-.reys, housework is ranked down there 
with commuting as activities that people enjoy 
the least. Maybe that's why figuring out who 
does which chores usually prompts, at best, 
tense discussion in a household and, at worst, 
outright fighting. 
If everyone is good at something different, 
assigning chores is easy. If your partner is great 
at grocery shopping and you are great at the 
|laundry, you're set. But this isn't always—or even 
usually—the case. Often one person is better at 
everything. (And let’s be honest, often that person 
is the woman.) Better at the laundry, the grocery 
shopping, the cleaning, the cooking. But does 
that mean she should have to do everything? 
Before my daughter was born, | both cooked 
and did the dishes. It wasn't a big deal, it didn't 
take too much time, and honestly | was a lot better 
at both than my husband. His cooking repertoire 
extended only to eggs and chili, and when | left 
him in charge of the dishwasher, I'd often find 
he had run it “full” with one pot and eight forks. 
After we had a kid, we had more to do and 
less time to do it in. It seemed like it was time 
for some reassignments. But, of course, | was 
still better at doing both things. Did that mean 
| should do them both? 
| could have appealed to the principle of 
fairness: We should each do half. | could have 
appealed to feminism—surveys show that 
women more often than not get the short end 
of the chore stick. In time-use data, women do 
about 44 minutes more housework than men 
(2 hours and 11 minutes versus 1 hour and 
27 minutes). Men outwork women only in the 
areas of “lawn” and “exterior maintenance.” 
| could have supgested he do more chores to 
rectify this imbalance, to show our daughter, 
in the Free to Be You and Me style, that Mom 
and Dad are equal and that housework is fun if 
we do it together! | could have simply smashed 
arpund the pans in the dishwasher while sigh￾ing loudly in the hopes he would notice and 
offer to do it himself. 
But luckily for me and my husband, I'm 
an economist, so | have more effective tools 
than passive aggression. And some basic 
economic principles provided the answer. We 
needed to divide the chores because it is simply 
not efficient for the best cook and dishwasher 
to do all the cooking and dishwashing. The 
economic principle at play here is increasing 
marginal cost. Basically, people get worse when 
they are tired. When | teach my students this 
principle, | explain it in the context of manag￾ing their employees. Imagine you have a good 
employee and a not-so-good one. Should you 
make the good employee do literally everything? 
Usually, the answer is no. Why not? It's 
likely that the not-so-good employee is better at 
9 a.m. after a full night of sleep than the good 
employee is at 2 a.m. after a 17-hour workday. 
So you want to give at least a few tasks to 
your worse guy. The same principle applies in 
your household. Yes, you {or your spouse) might 
be better at everything. But anyone doing the 
laundry at 4 a.m. is likely to put the red towels 
in with the white T-shirts. Some task splitting 
is a good idea. How much depends on how fast 
people’s shills decay. 
To “optimize” your family efficiency (every 
economist’s ultimate goal—and yours, too), 
you want to equalize effectiveness on the 
final task each person is doing. Your partner 
does the dishes, mows the lawn, and makes 
Chapter in a Nutshell 
* Each person consumes goods and services produced advantage. The gains from trade are based on com￾by many other people both in the United States and 
around the world. Interdependence and trade are 
desirable because they allow everyone to enjoy a 
greater quantity and variety of goods and services. 
There are two ways to compare the abilities of two 
people to produce a good. The person who can pro￾duce the good with the smaller quantity of inputs is 
said to have an absolute advantage in producing the 
good. The person who has the lower opportunity cost 
of producing the good is said to have a comparative 
parative advantage, not absolute advantage. 
Trade makes everyone better off because it allows 
people to specialize in those activities in which they 
have a comparative advantage. 
The principle of comparative advantage applies to 
countries as well as to people. Economists use the prin￾ciple of comparative advantage to advocate free trade 
among countries.

the grocery list. You do the cooking, laundry, 
shopping, cleaning, and paying the bills. This 
may seem imbalanced, but when you look at 
it, you see that by the time your partner gets 
to the grocery-list task, he is wearing thin and 
starting to nod off. It's all he can do to figure 
out how much milk you need. In fact, he is just 
about as good at that as you are when you get 
around to paying the bills, even though that's 
your fifth task. 
If you then made your partner also do the 
cleaning—so it was an even four and four— 
the house would be a disaster, since he is 
already exhausted by his third chore while you 
are still doing fine. This system may well end up 
meaning one person does more, but it is unlikely 
to result in one person doing everything. 
Once you've decided you need to divide up 
the chores in this way, how should you decide 
who does what? One option would be randomly 
assigning tasks; another would be having each 
person do some of everything. One spousal￾advice website | read suggested you should 
divide tasks based on which ones you like the 
best. None of these are quite right. (In the last 
case, how would anyone ever end up with the 
job of cleaning the bathroom?) 
To decide who does what, we need more 
economics. Specifically, the principle of 
comparative advantage. Economists usu￾ally talk about this in the context of trade.

making both reindeer hats and snowshoes. 
But they are much, much better at the hats 
and only a little better at the snowshoes. 
The overall world production is maximized 
when Finland makes hats and Sweden makes 
snowshoes. 
We say that Finland has an absolute 
advantage in both things but a comparative 
advantage only in hats. This principle is part 
of the reason economists value free trade, 
but that's for another column (and probably 
another autheor). But it's also 2 guideline for 
how to trade tasks in your house. You want to 
assign each person the tasks on which he or 
she has a comparative advantage. It doesn't 
matter that you have an absolute advantage 
in everything. If you are much, much better at 
the laundry and only a little better at clean￾ing the toilet, you should do the laundry and 
have your spouse get out the scrub brush, 
Just explain that it's efficient! 
In our case, it was easy. Other than using

domain—I'm much, much better at cooking. 
And | was only moderately better at the dishes. 
So he got the job of cleaning up after meals, 
even though his dishwasher loading habits 
had already come under scrutiny. The good 
news is another economic principle | hadn't 
even counted on was soon in play: learning 
by doing. As people do a task, they improve 
at it. Eighteen months into this new arrange￾ment the dishwasher is almost a work of art: 
neat rows of dishes and everything care￾fully screened for “top-rack only™ status. I, 
meanwhile, am forbidden from getting near 
the dishwasher. Apparently, there is a risk 
that I'll “ruin it.”" m 
Questions to Discuss 
1. Inyour family, do you think tasks are 
divided among family members accord￾ing to comparative advantage? If so, 
how? If not, how might the allocation of 
tasks be improved? 
2. Do you think being married to an econo￾mist would facilitate family harmony or 
just the opposite?

economies work, determining the quantity of each good produced 
and the price at which it is sold. It you want to know how events

This chapter introduces the theory of supply and demand. It 
considers how buyers and sellers behave and interact, how sup￾ply and demand determine prices, and how prices allocate scarce

a market in which there

a negligible impact on 
the market price 
The terms supply and demand refer to the behavior of people as they interact 
in competitive markets. Let’s first discuss the meaning of the terms market and 
competition. 
4-1a What Is a Market? 
Amarket is a group of buyers and sellers of a good or service. The buyers determine 
the demand for the product, and the sellers determine the supply of the product. 
Markets take many forms. Some are highly organized. In the markets for wheat 
and corn, buyers and sellers meet at a specific time and place, knowing how much 
of these agricultural commodities they are willing to buy and sell at various prices. 
An auctioneer keeps the process orderly by arranging sales and (most importantly) 
finding the prices that bring the buying and selling into balance. 
More often, markets are less organized than that. For example, consider the 
market for ice cream in a particular town. Ice-cream buyers do not all meet at any 
one time or place. The sellers are in several locations and offer somewhat different 
toppings and flavors. No auctioneer calls out the price of a sundae. Each seller posts 
a price for an ice-cream cone, and each buyer decides how many to buy at each store. 
Nonetheless, these consumers and producers of ice cream are closely connected. 
The buyers are choosing among the various sellers to satisfy their cravings, and the 
sellers are all trying to attract the same buyers to make their businesses succeed. 
Even though they do not look as organized, the ice-cream buyers and sellers form 
a market. 
4-1b What Is Competition? 
The ice-cream market, like many markets in the economy, is highly competitive. 
Buyers know that there are several sellers from which to choose, and sellers 
are aware that each of their products is similar to those offered by others. As a 
result, the price of ice cream and the quantity sold are determined not by any 
single buyer or seller but by all the buyers and sellers as they interact in the 
marketplace. 
Economists use the term competitive market to describe a market in which 
there are so many buyers and sellers that each has little effect on the market 
price. Each seller has limited control over the price because many other sellers 
are offering similar products. A seller has little reason to charge less than the 
going price, and if the seller charges more, buyers will go elsewhere. Similarly, 
no single buyer can influence the price because each buyer purchases only a 
small amount. 
In this chapter, we keep things simple by assuming that markets are perfectly 
competitive. In this ideal form of competition, a market has two characteristics: 
(1) The goods offered for sale are all exactly the same, and (2) the buyers and sellers 
are so numerous that no single buyer or seller has any influence over the market 
price. Because buyers and sellers in perfectly competitive markets must accept the 
price the market determines, they are said to be price takers. At the market price, 
buyers can buy all they want, and sellers can sell all they want. 
There are some markets in which the assumption of perfect competition applies 
perfectly. In the wheat market, for example, there are thousands of farmers who 
scll wheat and millions of consumers who use wheat and wheat products. Because 
no single buyer or seller can influence the price of wheat, each takes the market 
price as given.

Not all goods and services are sold in perfectly competitive markets. For example, 
some markets have only one seller, and this seller sets the price. A seller in such a 
market is called a monopoly. A local cable television company, for instance, is a 
maonopoly if residents of the town have only one company from which to buy cable 
service. Many other markets fall between the extremes of perfect competition and 
monopoly. 
But perfectly competitive markets are a useful place to start. They are the easiest 
to analyze because everyone participating in them takes the price as given by mar￾ket conditions. Moreover, because some degree of competition is present in most 
markets, many of the lessons learned studying supply and demand under perfect 
competition apply to more complex markets as well.

Answers are at the end of the chapter. 
4-2 Demand 
Let’s begin our study of markets by examining the behavior of buyers, particularly 
those who love ice cream. (And who doesn‘t?) 
4-2a The Demand Curve: The Relationship between 
Price and Quantity Demanded 
The quantity demanded of any good is the amount that buyers are willing and quantity demanded 
able to purchase. Many things determine the quantity demanded of a good, butone the amount of a good 
determinant plays a central role: its price. If the price of ice cream rose to 520 per that buyers are willing 
scoop, most people would buy less. They might buy frozen yogurt instead. If the and able to purchase 
price of ice cream fell to $0.50 per scoop, they might buy more. This relationship 
between price and quantity demanded is true for most goods. In fact, it is so per￾vasive that economists call it the law of demand: Other things being equal, when law of demand

Catherine’s Demand Schedule 
and Demand Curve 
The demand schedule is a table that shows the quantity demanded at each price. 
The demand curve, which graphs this schedule, illustrates how the quantity 
demanded changes as the price varies. Because a lower price increases the quantity 
demanded, the demand curve slopes downward.

buys fewer and fewer cones. When the price reaches 56, Catherine doesn't buy any 
ice cream at all. This table is called a demand schedule. It shows the relationship 
between the price of a good and the quantity demanded, holding constant everything 
else that influences how much of the good a consumer wants to buy. 
The graph in Figure 1 uses the numbers from the table to illustrate the law of 
demand. By convention, the price of ice cream is on the vertical axis, and the quantity 
demanded is on the horizontal axis. The line relating price and quantity demanded 
is the demand curve. It slopes downward because, other things being equal, a lower 
price increases the quantity demanded. 
4-2b Market Demand versus Individual Demand 
The demand curve in Figure 1 shows an individual's demand for a product. But to 
analyze how markets work, it's important to know the market demand, the sum 
of all the individual demands for a particular good or service. 
The table in Figure 2 shows the demand schedules for ice cream for two people— 
Catherine and Nicholas. At any price, Catherine’s demand schedule shows how 
many cones she buys, and Nicholas's shows the same information for him. The 
market demand at each price is the sum of their individual demands. 
The graph in Figure 2 shows the demand curves for these demand schedules. 
To obtain the market demand curve, we add the individual demand curves 
horizontally. That is, to find the total quantity demanded at any price, we add 
the individual quantities demanded, which are found on the horizontal axis of

the individual demand curves. The market demand curve is crucial for analyz￾ing how markets function. It shows how the total quantity demanded of a good 
varies as its price changes, holding constant all the other factors that affect 
consumer purchases. 
4-2¢ Shifts in the Demand Curve 
Because the market demand curve holds other things constant, it need not be stable 
over time. If something happens to alter the quantity demanded at any given price, 
the demand curve shifts. 
For example, suppose the American Medical Association discovers that peo￾ple who regularly eat ice cream live longer, healthier lives. Such a marvelous 
discovery would raise the demand for ice cream. At any price, buyers would 
now want to purchase more ice cream, and the demand curve for ice cream 
would shift. 
Figure 3 illustrates shifts in demand. A change that increases the quantity demand￾ed at every price, such as this wondrous but imaginary discovery, shifts the demand

curve to the right and is called an increase in demand. A change that reduces the 
quantity demanded at every price shifts the demand curve to the left and is called 
a decrease in demand. 
Changes in many variables can shift the demand curve, including: 
Income What would happen to your demand for ice cream if you lost your job 
one summer? It would most likely fall because you have less money to spend on 
things like ice cream. If the demand for something falls when income falls, that 
good is called a normal good. 
Normal goods are the norm, but not all goods are normal goods. If the demand 
for something rises when income falls, that good is called an inferior good. An 
example of an inferior good might be bus rides. As your income falls, you are less 
likely to buy a car or take an Uber and more likely to ride a bus. 
Prices of Related Goods Suppose that the price of frozen yogurt declines. The 
law of demand says that you will buy more of it. At the same time, you may buy 
less ice cream. Because ice cream and frozen yogurt are both cold, sweet, creamy 
desserts, they satisfy similar cravings. When a fall in the price of one good, like 
frozen yogurt, reduces the demand for another good, like ice cream, the two goods 
are called substitutes. Substitutes are often pairs of goods that are used in place of 
each other, such as hot dogs and hamburgers, sweaters and sweatshirts, and movie 
tickets and video streaming services. 
Now suppose that the price of hot fudge declines. According to the law of 
demand, you will buy more hot fudge. Yet in this case, you may be inclined to buy 
more ice cream as well because ice cream and hot fudge go well together. When a 
fall in the price of one good, like hot fudge, raises the demand for another good, 
like ice cream, the two goods are called complements. Complements are often pairs 
of goods that are used together, such as electricity and air conditioners, computers 
and software, and peanut butter and jelly.

Mumber of buyers Shifts the demand curve 
Tastes If vou like pistachio ice cream, you will buy more of it. While individual 
tastes, like preferences for ice-cream flavors, are critically important for explaining 
demand, economists typically don’t try to explain them. This is because they are 
unique to vou, though affected by historical and psychological forces. Economists 
do, however, examine what happens when tastes change. 
Expectations Your views about the future may affect your demand for something 
today. If you expect a higher income next month, you may choose to save less now 
and spend more on ice cream today. If you believe ice cream will be cheaper tomor￾row, you may be reluctant to buy a cone at today’s price. 
Number of Buyers In addition to the factors that influence the behavior of 
individual buyers, market demand depends on how many of these buyers there 
are. If Peter were to join Catherine and Nicholas as an ice-cream consumer, the 
quantity demanded would be higher at every price, and market demand would 
increase. 
Summary The demand curve shows what happens to the quantity demanded 
of a good as its price varies, holding constant all the other variables that influence 
huyers When one of these other variables changes, the quantity demanded at each 
price changes, and the demand curve shifts. Table 1 lists the variables that influence 
how much of a good consumers choose to buy. 
If you have trouble remembering whether you need to shift or move along the 
demand curve, it helps to recall a lesson from the appendix to Chapter 2. A curve 
shifts when there is a change in a relevant variable that is not measured on either 
axis. Because the price is on the vertical axis, a change in price represents a move￾ment along the demand curve. By contrast, income, the prices of related goods, 
tastes, expectations, and the number of buyers are not measured on either axis, so 
a change in one of these variables shifts the demand curve.

{a) A Shift in the Demand Gurve 
Two Ways to Reduce Smoking 
Because smoking can harm you and those around you, policy￾makers often want to reduce the amount that people smoke. 
Consider two paths for achieving this goal. 
One way to reduce smoking is to shift the demand curve for cigarettes and 
other tobacco products. This can be done through public service announce￾ments, mandatory health warnings on cigarette packages, and the prohibition 
of cigarette advertising on television, all of which are aimed at reducing the 
quantity of cigarettes demanded at any price. When successful, these policies 
shift the demand curve for cigarettes to the left, as in panel (a) of Figure 4. 
Another way to discourage smoking is to raise the price of cigarettes. When 
the government taxes cigarettes, the companies that make and sell them pass 
most of the tax on to consumers in the form of higher prices. Because people tend to 
buy less when the price rises, this policy also reduces smoking. But this approach does 
not shift the demand curve. Instead, the change appears as a movement along the same 
curve to a point with a higher price and lower quantity, as in panel (b) of Figure 4. 
How much does the amount of smoking respond to changes in the price of ciga￾rettes? Economists have studied what happens when the tax on cigarettes changes. 
They have found that a ten percent price increase causes a four percent reduction in 
the quantity demanded. Teenagers are especially sensitive to the price of cigarettes: 
A ten percent price increase causes a 12 percent drop in teenage smoking, TOGE GO ] OTELO/SHUTTER o FABLD DELAID 
When warnings on cigarette packages persuade smokers to smoke less, the demand curve 
for cigarettes shifts to the left. In panel (a), the curve shifts from D, to D,. At a price of 
5 per pack, the quantity demanded falls from 20 to 10 cigarettes per day, as reflected 
by the shift from point A to point B. By contrast, when a tax raises the price of cigarettes, 
the demand curve does not shift. Instead, there is a movement to a different point an the 
demand curve. In panel (b), when the price rises from $5 to $10, the quantity demanded 
falls from 20 to 12 cigarettes per day, as reflected by the movement from point A to point C.

A related question is how the price of cigarettes affects the demand for other 
products, such as marijuana. Opponents of cigarette taxes sometimes argue that 
tobacco and marijuana are substitutes, so high cigarette prices encourage marijuana 
use. By contrast, many experts on substance abuse view tobacco as a “gateway 
drug,” leading young people to experiment with other harmful substances. Most 
studies of the data are consistent with this latter view. They find that lower cigarette 
prices are associated with greater use of marijuana. In other words, tobacco and 
marijuana appear to be complements rather than substitutes. @

4-3 Supply 
Buyers are only half the story of how markets work. Sellers are the other half. Let’s 
now consider the sellers of ice cream. 
4-3a The Supply Curve: The Relationship between 
Price and Quantity Supplied 
The quantity supplied of any good or service is the amount that sellers are willing 
and able to sell. There are many determinants of the quantity supplied, but again, 
price plays a special role. When the price of ice cream is high, selling ice cream is 
very profitable, so the quantity supplied is large. Sellers work long hours, buy many 
ice-cream machines, and hire many workers. By contrast, when the price is low, the 
business is less profitable, so sellers produce less. Some sellers may even shut down, 
reducing their quantity supplied to zero. This relationship between price and the 
quantity supplied is called the law of supply: Other things being equal, when 
the price of a good rises, the quantity supplied also rises, and when the price falls, 
the quantity supplied falls as well. 
The table in Figure 5 shows the quantity of ice-cream cones supplied each month 
by Ben, an ice-cream seller, at various prices of ice cream. At a price below $2, Ben 
does not supply any ice cream at all. As the price rises, he supplies a greater and 
greater quantity. This table is called the supply schedule. It shows the relationship 
between the price of a good and the quantity supplied, holding constant everything 
else that influences how much of the good producers want to sell. 
The graph in Figure 5 uses numbers from the table to illustrate the law of supply. 
The curve relating price and the quantity supplied is the supply curve. The supply

Figura 5 The supply schedule is a table that shows the quantity supplied at each price. The 
. supply curve, which graphs the supply schedule, illustrates how the quantity supplied 
Ben's Supply Schedule changes as a good’s price varies. Because a higher price increases the quantity

curve slopes upward because, other things being equal, a higher price means a 
greater quantity supplied. 
4-3b Market Supply versus Individual Supply 
Just as market demand is the sum of the demands of all buyers, market supply 
is the sum of the supplies of all sellers. The table in Figure 6 shows the supply 
schedules for the market’'s two ice-cream producers—Ben and Jerry. At any price, 
Ben’s supply schedule tells us the quantity that Ben supplies, and Jerry’s supply 
schedule tells us how much Jerry supplies. The market supply is the sum of the 
two individual supplies. 
The graph in Figure 6 shows the supply curves that correspond to the supply 
schedules. As with demand curves, the market supply curve is obtained by adding 
the individual supply curves horizontally. That is, to find the total quantity supplied 
at any price, we add the individual quantities, which are located on the horizontal 
axis of the individual supply curves. The market supply curve shows how the total 
quantity supplied varies as the price varies, holding constant all other factors that 
influence producers’ decisions about how much to sell. 
4-3¢ Shifts in the Supply Curve 
Because a market supply curve holds constant all the variables other than price that 
affect quantity supplied, it can move over time. When one of these other variables

changes, the quantity that producers want to sell at any price changes, and the 
supply curve shifts. 
For example, suppose the price of sugar falls. Because sugar is an input in the 
production of ice cream, the lower price of sugar makes selling ice cream more 
profitable. This increases the ice-cream supply: At any price, sellers are willing to 
produce more. As a result, the supply curve shifts to the right. 
Figure 7 illustrates shifts in supply. A change that raises the quantity supplied at 
every price, such as a fall in the price of sugar, shifts the supply curve to the right 
and is called an increase in supply. A change that reduces the quantity supplied 
at every price shifts the supply curve to the left and is called a decrease in supply. 
Many variables can shift the supply curve. The most important ones include: 
Input Prices Ice-cream sellers use various inputs to make their product: cream, 
sugar, flavoring, ice-cream machines, the buildings in which the ice cream is made, 
and the labor of the workers who mix the ingredients and operate the machines. 
When the price of one or more of these inputs rises, producing ice cream becomes

less profitable, and firms supply less ice cream. If input prices rise substantially, a 
firm might shut down and supply no ice cream at all. Thus, the supply of a good 
moves in the opposite direction of the prices of inputs. 
Technology The technology for turning inputs into output is another determinant 
of supply. The invention of mechanized ice-cream machines, for example, reduced 
the labor needed to make ice cream. By reducing producers’ costs, this advance in 
technology increased the supply. In the long run, such changes in technology are 
among the most potent forces affecting market outcomes. 
Expectations The amount that ice-cream makers supply may depend on their 
expectations about the future. For example, if they expect the price to rise, they may 
put some of their current production into storage and supply less to the market today. 
Number of Sellers In addition to the factors that influence the behavior of indi￾vidual sellers, market supply depends on how many sellers there are in the market. 
If Ben or Jerry retires from the ice-cream business, the market supply falls. If Edy 
starts a new ice-cream business, the market supply rises. 
Summary The supply curve shows what happens to the quantity supplied when 
a good's price varies, holding constant all the other variables that influence sellers. 
When one of these other variables changes, the quantity supplied at each price 
changes, and the supply curve shifts. Table 2 lists the variables that influence how 
much producers choose to sell. 
Once again, to remember whether you need to shift or move along the supply 
curve, keep this in mind: A curve shifts only when there is a change in a relevant 
variable that isn’t named on either axis. Price is on the vertical axis, so a change in 
price is represented by a movement along the supply curve. By contrast, because 
input prices, technology, expectations, and the number of sellers are not measured 
on either axis, a change in one of these variables shifts the supply curve.

4-4 Supply and Demand Together 
Let’s now combine supply and demand to see how they determine the price and 
quantity of a good sold in a market. 
4-4a Equilibrium 
Figure 8 shows the market supply curve and market demand curve together. Notice 
that there is one point at which the supply and demand curves intersect. This point 
is the market’s equilibrium. The price at this intersection is the equilibrium price, 
and the quantity is the equilibrium quantity. Here, the equilibrium price is $4.00 
per cone, and the equilibrium quantity is 7 cones. 
The dictionary defines equilibrium as a situation in which forces are in bal￾ance. This sense of balance is key to the concept of a market equilibrium. At the 
equilibrium price, the quantity of the good that buyers are willing and able to 
buy exactly balances the quantity that sellers are willing and able to sell. The 
equilibrium price is sometimes called the market-clearing price because, at this 
price, everyone in the market has been satisfied: Buyers have bought all they want 
to buy, and sellers have sold all they want to sell.

Quantity of lce-Cream Cones 
The actions of buyers and sellers move markets toward the equilibrium of sup￾ply and demand. To see why, consider what happens when the market price does 
not equal the equilibrium price. 
Suppose first that the market price is above the equilibrium price, as in panel (a) of 
Figure 9. At a price of $5 per cone, the quantity supplied (10 cones) exceeds the quantity 
demanded (4 cones). There is a surplus of the good: Producers are unable to sell all they 
want at the going price. A surplus is sometimes called a situation of excess supply. 
When there is a surplus in the ice-cream market, sellers find their freezers increasingly 
full of ice cream they would like to sell but cannot. They respond by cutting prices. 
Falling prices, in turn, increase the quantity demanded and decrease the quantity sup￾plied. These changes represent movements along the supply and demand curves, not 
shifts in the curves. Prices continue to fall until the market reaches the equilibrium. 
Suppose now that the market price is below the equilibrium price, as in panel (b) 
of Figure 9. In this case, the price is 53 per cone, and the quantity demanded exceeds 
the quantity supplied. There is a shortage of the good: Consumers are unable to 
buy all they want at the going price. A shortage is sometimes called a situation of 
excess demand. When a shortage occurs in the ice-cream market, buyers must wait 
in long lines for a chance to buy one of the few cones available. With too many buy￾ers chasing too few goods, sellers can raise prices without losing sales. These price 
increases cause the quantity demanded to fall and the quantity supplied to rise. 
Again, these changes are depicted as movements along the supply and demand 
curves, and they move the market closer to equilibrium. 
Regardless of where the price starts, the activities of buyers and sellers push the 
market price toward equilibrium. Once the market reaches equilibrium, all buyers 
and sellers are satisfied in the sense that they can buy and sell the amount they 
want at the going price. At that point, there is no further upward or downward

Producers try to increase sales by cutting the price, moving it toward its equilibrium level. 
In panel (b), there is a shortage. Because the market price of $3 is below the equilibrium 
price, the quantity demanded (10 cones) exceeds the quantity supplied (4 cones). With 
too many buyers chasing too few goods, producers raise the price. In both cases, the price

Three Steps for Analyzing 
Changes in Equilibrium 
produce. The equilibrium price and quantity depend on the positions of the sup￾ply and demand curves. When an event shifts one of these curves, the equilibrium 
changes, resulting in a new price and a new quantity exchanged between buyers 
and sellers. 
When analyzing how an event affects the market’s equilibrium, we proceed in 
three steps. First, we decide if the event shifts the supply curve, the demand curve, 
or both. Second, we decide whether the curve shifts to the right or to the left. Third, 
we use a supply-and-demand diagram to compare the initial equilibrium with the 
new one, which shows how the shift affects the equilibrium price and quantity. 
Table 3 summarizes these three steps. To see how this works, let’s consider a few 
events that might affect the market for ice cream. 
Example: A Shift in Demand Changes the Market Equilibrium Suppose 
that this summer’s weather is exceptionally hot. How does this affect the ice-cream 
market? To answer this question, let's follow our three steps. 
1. The weather affects the demand curve by changing consumers’ taste for ice 
cream. That is, it alters the amount that people want to buy at any price. The 
supply curve remains the same because the weather does not directly affect 
the firms that sell ice cream. 
2. Because hot weather makes a cool treat more appealing, people want more 
ice cream. Figure 10 shows this increase in demand as a rightward shift 
in the demand curve from D to D,. This shift indicates that the quantity 
demanded is higher at every price. 
3. At the old price of $4, there is now an excess demand for ice cream, and this 
shortage induces firms to raise the price. As Figure 10 shows, the increase in 
demand raises the equilibrium price from $4 to $5 and the equilibrium quan￾tity from 7 to 10 cones. In other words, the hot weather increases both the 
price of ice cream and the quantity sold. 
Shifts in Curves versus Movements along Them When hot weather increases 
the demand for ice cream and drives up the price, the quantity that ice-cream 
makers supply rises, even though the supply curve remains the same. In this case, 
economists say there has been an increase in the quantity supplied but no change 
in supply. 
Supply refers to the position of the supply curve, while the quantity supplied 
refers to the amount producers want to sell. In the summer heat, supply does not 
change because the weather does not affect how much producers want to sell at any 
price. Instead, the sultry weather makes consumers more eager to buy at any price, 
1. Decide if the event shifts the supply or demand curve (or perhaps both). 
2. Decide in which direction the curve shifts. 
3. Use a supply-and-demand diagram to see how the shift changes the 
equilibrium price and quantity.

shifting the demand curve to the right. The increase in demand causes the equilib￾rium price to rise. When the price rises, the quantity supplied rises. This increase in 
quantity supplied is represented by the movement along the supply curve. 
To summarize, a shift in the supply curve is called a “change in supply,” and a 
shift in the demand curve is called a “change in demand.” A movement along a 
fixed supply curve is called a “change in the quantity supplied,” and a movement 
along a fixed demand curve is called a “change in the quantity demanded.” 
Example: A Shift in Supply Changes the Market Equilibrium One August, 
a hurricane destroys part of the sugarcane crop and drives up the price of sugar. 
How does this atfect the market for ice cream? Again, we follow our three steps. 
1. The increase in the price of sugar, an input for ice cream, raises the cost 
of producing ice cream. It therefore affects the supply curve. The demand 
curve does not change because the higher cost of inputs does not directly 
affect the amount of ice cream consumers want to buy. 
2. Higher costs reduce the amount of ice cream that producers are willing and 
able to sell at every price. Figure 11 depicts this decrease in supply as a left￾ward shift in the supply curve from 5, to §,. 
3. At the old price of $4, there is now an excess demand for ice cream, and this 
shortage causes firms to raise the price. As Figure 11 shows, the shift in the 
supply curve raises the equilibrium price from $4 to $5 and lowers the equi￾librium quantity from 7 to 4 cones. Because of the sugar price increase, the 
price of ice cream rises, and the quantity sold falls.

Example: Both Supply and Demand Shift In a series of unfortunate events, a 
heat wave and a hurricane strike in the same summer. To analyze this nasty com￾bination, we turn again to our three steps. 
1. Both curves must shift. The heat affects the demand curve because it alters 
the amount of ice cream that consumers want to buy at any price. At the 
same time, the hurricane alters the supply curve for ice cream: By driving up 
sugar prices, it changes the amount of ice cream that producers want to sell 
at any price. 
2. The curves shift in the same directions as they did earlier: The demand 
curve shifts to the right, and the supply curve shifts to the left, as Figure 12 
shows. 
. Two outcomes are possible, depending on the relative size of the demand 
and supply shifts. In both cases, the equilibrium price rises. In panel (a), 
where demand increases substantially while supply falls just a little, the 
equilibrium quantity also increases. But in panel (b), where supply falls 
substantially while demand rises just a little, the equilibrium quantity 
falls. Thus, these events certainly raise the price of ice cream, but their 
impact on the amount of ice cream sold is ambiguous (that is, it could go 
either way).

Summary Supply and demand curves help to analyze a change in equilibrium. When 
an event shifts the supply curve, the demand curve, or perhaps both curves, these 
tools can predict how the event will alter the price and quantity sold in equilibrium. 
Table 4 shows the predicted outcome for any combination of shifts in the two curves. 
To ensure that you understand how to use the tools of supply and demand, pick a few 
of the table’s entries and make sure you can explain to yourself the stated predictions.

The Law of Supply 
and Demand Isn't Fair 
By Richard Thaler 
Fnr an economist, one of the most jarring 
sights during the early weeks of the coronavi￾rus crisis in the United States was the spectacle 
of bare shelves in sections of the supermarket. 
There was no toilet paper or hand sanitizer, 
Pasta, flour and even yeast could be hard to 
find in the early weeks of social distancing as 
many people decided to take up baking. Of far 
greater cancern, hospitals could not buy enough 
of the masks, gowns and ventilators required 
to safely treat Covid-19 patients. 
What happened to the laws of supply and 
demand? Why didn't prices rise enough to clear 
the market, as economic models predict? 
A paper that | wrote with my friends 
Daniel Kahneman, a psychologist, and Jack 
Knetsch, an economist, explored this problem. 
We found that the answer may be summed up 
with a single word, one you won't find in the 
standard supply-and-demand models: faimess. 
Basically, it just isn't socially acceptable to 
raise prices in an emergency. 
We ashed people questions about the 
actions of hypothetical firms. For example: “A 
hardware store has been selling snow shovels 
for $15. The morning after a blizzard, the store 
raises the price of snow shovels to $20." 
Fully 82 percent of our respondents 
judged this to be unfair. The respondents were 
Canadians, known for their politeness, but the 
general findings have now been replicated and 
confirmed in studies around the world. 
Most companies implicitly understand that 
abiding by the social norms of fairness should 
be part of their business model. In the current 
crisis, large retail chains have responded to 
the shortages of toilet paper not by raising the 
price but by limiting the amount each customer 
can buy. And Amazon and eBay prohibited what 
was viewed as price gouging on their sites. 
We have seen similar behavior after hur￾ricanes. As soon as a storm ends, there is 
typically enormous demand for goods like 
bottled water and plywood. Big retailers 
like Home Depot and Walmart anticipate 
this, sending trucks loaded with supplies to 
regions just outside the danger zone, ready to 
be deployed. Then, when it is safe, the stores 
provide water for free and sell the plywood at 
the list price or lower. 
Af the same time, some “entrepreneurs”™ are 
likely to behave differently. They see a disaster 
as an opportunity and so will fill up trucks 
with plywood near their homes, drive to the 
storm site and sell their goods for whatever 
price they can get. 
It is not that large retailers are intrinsically 
more ethical than the entrepreneurs; it is sim￾ply that they have different time horizons. The 
large companies are playing a long game, and 
by behaving “fairly,” they are hoping to retain 
customer loyalty after the emergency. The entre￾preneurs are just interested in a quick buck. 
Fairness norms help explain the breakdown 
of supply chains of medical equipment in the 
coronavirus crisis. Hospitals normally use buy￾ing associations that make long-term deals 
with wholesalers to provide essential supplies. 
The wholesalers generally want to preserve 
these relationships and realize that now would 
not be a good time to raise prices. Often, they 
are contractually obligated to supply items at 
prices negotiated before a spike in demand. 
One current example is the N95 face mask. 
At the onset of the pandemic, hospitals had 
long-term contracts to buy them for about 
35 cents each, an executive at a New York hos￾pital told me. When the need for the masks 
surged, these suppliers were not allowed to 
raise the price, even if inclined to do so.

But others along the supply chain could 
make big profits by diverting masks to anyone 
willing to pay top dollar. That left hospitals 
in a bind. As the coronavirus spread in New 
York, the executive's hospital searched franti￾cally for masks, eventually paying an overseas 
supplier $6 each, for hundreds of thousands 
of them, when the regular stock was desper￾ately short. 
When anyone tries to reap big profits in an 
emergency like this, it can look ugly. Consider 
the case of two brothers who began buy￾ing hand sanitizer, masks and other scarce 
commodities on March 1, the day of the first 
announcement of a Covid-19 death in the 
United States. After they sold some of their 
merchandise at big markups on Amazon and 
eBay, these outlets cut them off. Eventually, 
after considerable adverse publicity, the broth￾ers decided to donate their supplies. 
Motice that the brothers were making mar￾kets more “efficient,” by buying low and selling 
high. If instead of arbitraging coranavirus sup￾plies they had sold shares of airline and hotel 
companies and bought shares of Netflix and 
Foom, they would simply have been considered 
smart traders. But while smart trading may 
be fine for investments, it is not considered 
fair when it involves essential goods during 
a pandemic. 
One can argue that this social norm is 
harmfiul in that it prevents markets from doing 
their magic. For example, Tyler Cowen, the

George Mason University economist, has said 
he wishes it were OK to raise prices for coro￾navirus essentials, 
“Higher prices discourage panic buying 
and increase the chance that the people who 
truly need particular goods and services have 
a greater chance of getting them,” he wrote. 
But which people “truly need” N95 masks? 
What is the right allocation of masks among 
well-endowed research hospitals, poorly funded 
municipal facilities, nursing homes and food 
processing plants? Supply and demand would 
tell us that the masks should simply go to the 
buyer who was willing and able to pay the most 
for them. But fairness tells us this can't be the 
only consideration, 
As a practical matter for businesses, big 
and small, that want to keep operating for the 
long haul, it makes good sense to obey the law 
of fairness. If the next shortage is meat and 
a store owner realizes that there is only one 
package of pork chops left, it would be unwise 
to sell it at auction to the highest bidder. m

4-5 Conclusion: How Prices Allocate Resources 
This chapter analyzed supply and demand in a single market. The discussion cen￾tered on the market for ice cream, but the lessons apply to most other markets as 
well. When you go to a store to buy something, you are contributing to the demand 
for that item. When you look for a job, you are contributing to the supply of labor 
services. Because supply and demand are such pervasive forces in market economies, 
the model of supply and demand is a powerful analytical tool. 
“Two dollars” “—and seventy-five cents.” 
Ask the 
Experts Price Gouging 
One of the Ten Principles of Economics in Chapter 1 is that markets are usu￾ally a good way to organize economic activity. It is still too early to judge whether 
market outcomes are good or bad, but this chapter has begun to show how markets 
work. In any economic system, scarce resources must be allocated among compet￾ing uses. Market economies harness the forces of supply and demand to serve that 
end. Supply and demand together determine the prices of the economy’s many 
different goods and services. Prices, in turn, are the signals that guide the alloca￾tion of resources. 
For example, consider the allocation of beachfront land. Because 
the amount of this land is limited, not everyone can enjoy the 
luxury of living by the beach. Who gets this resource? The answer 
is whoever is willing and able to pay the price. The price of beach￾front land adjusts until the quantity of land demanded balances 
the quantity supplied. In market economies, prices are the mecha-

in a crisis would raise social welfare.” Similarly, prices determine who produces each good and how

one needs food to survive, it is crucial that some people work on 
farms. What determines who is a farmer and who is not? In a free 
society, no government planning agency makes this decision to 
ensure an adequate food supply. Instead, the allocation of labor 
to farms is based on the job decisions of millions of workers. 
This decentralized system performs well because these decisions 
depend on prices. The prices of food and the wages of farmwork￾ers (the price of their labor) adjust to ensure that enough people 
choose to be farmers.

If a person had never seen a market economy in action, the whole idea might seem 
preposterous. Economies are enormous groups of people engaged in a multitude 
of interdependent activities. What prevents decentralized decision making from 
degenerating into chaos? What coordinates the actions of the millions of people 
with their varying abilities and desires? What ensures that what needs to be done 
is, in fact, done? The answer, in a word, is prices. If an invisible hand guides market 
economies, as Adam Smith famously suggested, the price system is the baton with 
which the invisible hand conducts the economic orchestra. 
Chapter in a Nutshell 
» Economists use the model of supply and demand to 
analyze competitive markets. In such markets, there 
are many buyers and sellers, each of whom has little or 
no influence on the market price. 
¢ The demand curve for a good shows how the quan- . 
tity demanded depends on the price. According to the 
law of demand, as the good’s price falls, the quantity 
demanded rises. That's why the demand curve slopes 
downward. 
* In addition to price, other determinants of how much 
consumers want to buy include income, the prices . 
of substitutes and complements, tastes, expectations, 
and the number of buyers. When one of these factors 
changes, the quantity demanded at each price changes, 
and the demand curve shifts. 
* The supply curve for a good shows how the quantity 
supplied depends on the price. According to the law of 
supply, as the good’s price rises, the quantity supplied . 
rises. That's why the supply curve slopes upward. 
* In addition to price, other determinants of how much 
producers want to sell include input prices, technol￾ogy, expectations, and the number of sellers. When one 
of these factors changes, the quantity supplied at each 
price changes, and the supply curve shifts.

The intersection of the supply and demand curves 
represents the market equilibrium. At the equilibrium 
price, the quantity demanded equals the quantity 
supplied. 
The behavior of buyers and sellers naturally drives 
markets toward equilibrium. When the market price 
is above the equilibrium price, there is a surplus of the 
good, which causes the market price to fall. When the 
market price is below the equilibrium price, there is a 
shortage, which causes the market price to rise. 
To analyze how any event influences the equilibrium 
price and quantity in a market, use a supply-and￾demand diagram and follow these three steps. First, 
decide if the event shifts the supply curve or the 
demand curve (or both). Second, decide in which 
direction the curve shifts. Third, compare the new 
equilibrium with the initial one. 
In market economies, prices are the signals that guide 
decisions and allocate scarce resources. For every good 
in the economy, the price ensures that supply and 
demand are in balance. The equilibrium price deter￾mines how much buyers choose to consume and how 
much sellers choose to produce.

In the market for gasoline, studies typically find that the quantity demanded 
responds to gasoline prices more in the long run than in the short run. A 10 percent 
increase in the price reduces gasoline consumption by about 2.5 percent after a 
year but by about 6 percent after five years. About half of the long-run reduction 
comes from less driving, and half comes from switching to more fuel-efficient cars— 
and, increasingly, to electric cars that require no gasoline at all. Both responses are 
reflected in the demand curve and its elasticity. 
5-1 The Elasticity of Demand

demand 
a measure of how much 
the quantity demanded 
of a good responds to 
a change in its price, 
calculated as the 
percentage change in 
quantity demanded 
divided by the percentage 
change in price 
In Chapter 4, we noted that consumers usually buy more of a good when its price is 
lower, when their incomes are higher, when the prices of its substitutes are higher, 
or when the prices of its complements are lower. The discussion was qualitative, 
not quantitative. That is, it addressed whether quantity demanded rose or fell but 
not the size of the change. To measure how much consumers respond to changes 
in these variables, economists use the concept of elasticity. 
5-1a The Price Elasticity of Demand and Its Determinants 
The law of demand states that a fall in the price of a good raises the quantity demand￾ed. The price elasticity of demand measures how much the quantity demanded 
responds to a change in the price. Demand for a good is said to be elastic if the 
quantity demanded responds substantially to price changes. Demand is said to be 
inelastic if the quantity demanded responds only slightly to price changes. 
The price elasticity of demand for any good measures how willing consumers 
are to buy less of it as its price rises. Because a demand curve reflects the economic, 
social, and psychological forces that shape consumer preferences, there is no simple, 
universal rule for what determines a demand curve’s elasticity. But there are some 
rules of thumb. 
Availability of Close Substitutes Goods with close substitutes tend to have more 
elastic demand because it is easier for consumers to switch from those goods to 
others. For example, margarine is a common substitute for butter. Increase the price 
of butter by a small amount, and you will see its quantity demanded fall by a large 
amount, assuming the price of margarine is steady. By contrast, eggs don't have a 
close substitute, so the demand for them is less elastic. Increase the price of eggs by 
a small amount, and there will not be a big drop in the quantity of eggs demanded. 
Necessities and Luxuries For a true necessity, a small price increase won't 
diminish the amount you purchase by very much: Another way of saying this 
is that necessities tend to have inelastic demands. For example, when the price 
of a doctor’s visit rises, most people do not cut back sharply on the number of 
times they go to the doctor, although they might go a little less often. Luxuries 
are another matter. When the price of sailboats rises, the quantity of sailboats 
demanded falls substantially. The reason is that most people view sailboats as 
a luxury. Whether a good is a necessity or a luxury depends not on its intrinsic 
properties but on the buyer’s preferences. For avid sailors with little concern 
about their health, sailboats might be a necessity with inelastic demand and 
doctor visits a luxury with elastic demand. 
Defining the Market Broadly or Narrowly The elasticity of demand depends 
on how we draw the market’s boundaries. Narrowly defined markets tend to have

more elastic demand than broadly defined ones. That's because it is easier to find 
close substitutes for narrowly defined goods. For example, food, a broad category, 
has a fairly inelastic demand because there are no good substitutes for food. Ice 
cream, a narrow category, has a more elastic demand because it is easy to substitute 
other desserts for ice cream. Vanilla ice cream, an even narrower category, has a 
very elastic demand because some other flavors of ice cream, such as sweet cream, 
are almost perfect substitutes for vanilla. 
Time Horizon Demand tends to be more elastic over longer periods of time. 
When the price of gasoline rises, the quantity demanded falls only slightly in 
the first few months. As time passes, however, people buy more fuel-efficient 
or all-electric cars, arrange carpools, switch to public transportation, and move 
closer to work. Over several years, the quantity of gasoline demanded falls more 
substantially. 
5-1b The Price Elasticity of Demand, with Numbers 
Now that we have discussed the price elasticity of demand in general terms, let's 
be more precise about how it is measured. Economists compute the price elastic￾ity of demand as the percentage change in the quantity demanded divided by the 
percentage change in the price. That is: 
Percentage change in quantity demanded Price elasticity of demand = ¥ Percentage change in price 
For example, suppose that after a 10 percent increase in the price of an ice-cream cone, 
you buy 20 percent fewer cones. We calculate your elasticity of demand this way: 
20 percent _ Price ce elasticity elasticity of d deman d=—"—"7"—=2 0p - 
In this example, the elasticity is 2. That means that the change in quantity demanded 
is proportionately twice as large as the change in price. 
Because the quantity demanded of a good moves in the opposite direction as 
its price, the percentage change in quantity has the opposite sign as the percent￾age change in price. In this example, the percentage change in price is a positive 
10 percent (reflecting an increase), and the percentage change in quantity demanded 
is a negative 20 percent (reflecting a decrease). For this reason, price elasticities 
of demand are sometimes reported as negative numbers. It is common practice, 
however, to drop the minus sign and report all price elasticities of demand as posi￾tive numbers. (Mathematicians call this the absolute value.) With this convention, 
which this book follows, a larger price elasticity implies a greater responsiveness 
of quantity demanded to price changes. 
5-1l¢ The Midpoint Method: A Better Way to Calculate 
Percentage Changes and Elasticities 
If you try calculating the price elasticity of demand between two points on a 
demand curve, you will face an annoying problem: The elasticity from point A 
to point B seems different from the elasticity from point B to point A. Consider 
this example: 
Point A : Price = $4 Quantity = 120 
Point B: Price = $6 Quantity = 80

8920 Part Il Haw Markets Wark 
Going from point A to point B, the price rises by 50 percent and the quantity falls 
by 33 percent, indicating that the price elasticity of demand is 33 /50, or 0.66. Going 
from point B to point A, the price falls by 33 percent and the quantity rises by 
50 percent, indicating that the price elasticity of demand is 50/33, or 1.5. This dif￾ference arises because the percentage changes are calculated from a ditferent base. 
Yet the underlying reality—the response of buyers to price changes—is identical 
whether moving from point A to point B or from point B to point A. 
The midpoint method for calculating elasticities avoids this confusion. The stan￾dard procedure for calculating a percentage change is to divide the change by the 
initial level. But the midpoint method instead divides the change by the midpoint 
(or average) of the initial and final levels. For instance, $5 is midway between $4 
and $6. Therefore, according to the midpoint method, a change from $4 to $6 is 
considered a 40 percent rise because (6 — 4)/5 X 100 = 40. Similarly, a change from 
$6 to $4 is considered a 40 percent fall. 
Because the midpoint method gives the same answer regardless of the direction 
of change, it is often used when calculating the price elasticity of demand between 
two points. In our example, the midpoint between point A and point B is: 
Midpoint: Price = $5 Quantity = 100 
According to the midpoint method, when going from point A to point B, the price 
rises by 40 percent and the quantity falls by 40 percent. Similarly, when going from 
point B to point A, the price falls by 40 percent and the quantity rises by 40 percent. 
In both directions, the price elasticity of demand equals 1. 
The following formula expresses the midpoint method for calculating the price 
elasticity of demand between two points, denoted (Q,, P,) and (Q,, P,): 
(Q —Q)/[(Q, +Q)/2] Price elasticity of demand = . v (B = P)/[(B = P)/2] 
The numerator is the percentage change in quantity using the midpoint method, 
and the denominator is the percentage change in price using the midpoint method. 
If you ever need to calculate elasticities, use this formula. 
This book rarely performs such calculations. For most purposes here, what elas￾ticity represents—the responsiveness of quantity demanded to price changes—is 
more important than how it is calculated. 
5-1d The Variety of Demand Curves 
Economists use elasticity to classify demand curves. When the quantity moves 
proportionately more than the price, the elasticity is greater than one, and demand 
is said to be elastic. When the quantity moves proportionately less than the price, 
the elasticity is less than one, and demand is said to be inelastic. Finally, when the 
percentage change in quantity equals the percentage change in price, the elasticity 
is exactly 1, and demand is said to have unit elasticity. 
Because the price elasticity of demand measures how much quantity demanded 
responds to price changes, it is closely related to the slope of the demand curve. 
Here's a useful rule of thumb: The flatter the demand curve at a given point, the 
greater the price elasticity of demand. The steeper the demand curve at a given 
point, the smaller the price elasticity of demand.

Figure 1 shows five cases. In the extreme case of zero elasticity, shown in panel 
(a), demand is perfectly inelastic, and the demand curve is vertical. In this case, 
regardless of the price, the quantity demanded stays the same. As the elasticity rises, 
the demand curve gradually flattens, as shown in panels (b), (c), and (d). At the 
oppuosite extreme, in panel (¢), demand is perfectly elastic. This occurs as the price 
elasticity of demand becomes so large that it approaches infinity. The demand curve 
becomes horizontal, showing that tiny changes in the price lead to huge changes 
in the quantity demanded. 
If you have trouble keeping straight which curve is elastic and which inelastic, 
here’s a memory trick: Inelastic curves, such as in panel (a) of Figure 1, look like 
the letter L. (Economists call it a curve, but when it's perfectly inelastic, it’s really a 
vertical line.) This is not a deep insight, but it might help on your next exam. 
3-le Total Revenue and the Price Elasticity of Demand 
When studying changes in supply or demand in a market, one variable we often 
want to study is total revenue, the amount paid by buyers and received by sellers 
of the good. In mathematical form, total revenue is P X (@, the price of the good 
times the quantity of the good sold. Figure 2 shows total revenue graphically. The 
height of the box under the demand curve is P, and the width is Q. The area of this 
box, P x (), equals the total revenue in this market. In Figure 2, where P = $4 and 
Q = 100, total revenue is $4 * 100, or $400.

e have talked about what elasticity means, what determines it, and 
how it is calculated. Beyond these general ideas, you might ask for 
a specific number. How much, precisely, does a good's price influence its 
quantity demanded? 
To answer this question, economists collect market data and apply 
statistical technigues to estimate the price elasticity of demand. Here 
are some price elasticities of demand, obtained from various studies, 
for a range of goods: 
These numbers are fun to think about, and they can be useful when 
comparing markets, but take them with a grain of salt. One reason 
is that the statistical technigues used to obtain them require some 
assumptions about the world, and these assumptions might nat be true 
in practice. (The part of economics called econometrics studies these 
statistical techniques.) Another reason is that the price elasticity of 
demand need not be the same at all points on a demand curve, as we 
will see in the case of a linear demand curve. For both reasons, don't 
be surprised when different studies report ditferent price elasticities of 
demand for the same good. M Eggs 0.1 4 Very inelastic (quantity

How does total revenue change as one moves along the demand curve? The 
answer depends on the price elasticity of demand. If demand is inelastic, as in panel 
(a) of Figure 3, then an increase in the price causes an increase in total revenue. Here, 
an increase in the price from $4 to $5 causes the quantity demanded to fall from 
100 to 90, so total revenue rises from $400 to $450. An increase in the price raises 
P % Q because the fall in Q is proportionately smaller than the rise in P. In other 
words, the extra revenue from selling units at a higher price (represented by area 
Ain the figure) more than offsets the decline in revenue from selling fewer units 
(represented by area B). 
The opposite result occurs when demand is elastic: An increase in the price causes 
total revenue to decline. In panel (b) of Figure 3, for instance, when the price rises 
from %4 to $5, the quantity demanded falls from 100 to 70, so total revenue falls from 
$400 to $350. Because demand is elastic, the reduction in quantity demanded is so 
great that it more than offsets the price increase. That is, an increase in the price 
reduces P ¥ Q because the fall in Q is proportionately greater than the rise in P. In 
this case, the extra revenue from selling units at a higher price (area A) is smaller 
than the decline in revenue from selling fewer units (area B). 
The examples in this figure illustrate some general rules: 
* When demand is inelastic (a price elasticity less than one), the price and 
total revenue move in the same direction: If the price increases, total revenue 
also increases. 
¢« When demand is elastic (a price elasticity greater than one), the price and 
total revenue move in opposite directions: If the price increases, total rev￾enue decreases. 
¢ [f demand is unit elastic (a price elasticity exactly equal to 1), total revenue 
remains constant when the price changes.

How Total Revenue Changes 
When Price Changes 
The impact of a price change on total revenue (price times quantity) depends on the 
elasticity of demand. In panel (a), the demand curve is inelastic. A price increase leads 
to a proportionately smaller decrease in quantity demanded, so total revenue increases. 
Here, the price increases from %4 to $5, and the gquantity demanded falls from 100 to 
90. Total revenue rises from $400 to $450. In panel (b), the demand curve is elastic. A 
price increase leads to a proportionately larger decrease in quantity demanded, so total 
revenue decreases. Here, the price increases from $4 to $5, and the quantity demanded 
falls from 100 to 70. Total revenue falls from $400 to $350.

5-1f Elasticity and Total Revenue along 
a Linear Demand Curve 
Let’s examine how elasticity varies along a linear demand curve, as shown in 
Figure 4. Because the demand curve is a straight line, it has a constant slope. Slope 
is defined as “rise over run,” which here is the ratio of the change in price (“rise”) 
to the change in quantity (“run”). In this case, the demand curve's slope is constant 
because each 51 increase in the price causes the same decrease of two units in the 
quantity demanded. 
Even though the slope of a linear demand curve is constant, the elasticity is 
not. This is because the slope is the ratio of changes in the two variables, while the 
elasticity is the ratio of percentage changes in them. You can see this in the table 
for Figure 4, which shows the demand schedule for the linear demand curve in 
the graph. The table uses the midpoint method to calculate the price elasticity of 
demand. It illustrates this fundamental idea: At points with a low price and high 
quantity, a linear demand curve is inelastic. At points with a high price and low 
quantity, a linear demand curve is elastic.

Elasticity along a Linear Demand Curve 
The slope of a linear demand curve is constant, but its elasticity is 
not. The price elasticity of demand is calculated using the demand 
schedule and the midpoint method. At points with a low price and 
high guantity, the demand curve is inelastic. At points with a high price 
and low quantity, it is elastic.

The explanation comes from the arithmetic of percentage changes. When the price 
is low and consumers are buying a lot, a $1 price increase and two-unit reduction in 
quantity demanded constitute a large percentage increase in the price and a small 
percentage decrease in quantity demanded, resulting in a small elasticity. When the 
price is high and consumers are not buying much, the same $1 price increase and 
two-unit reduction in quantity demanded constitute a small percentage increase 
in the price and a large percentage decrease in quantity demanded, resulting in a 
large elasticity. 
The table presents total revenue at each point on the demand curve. These num￾bers illustrate the relationship between total revenue and elasticity. When the price 
is $1, for instance, demand is inelastic, and a price increase to $2 raises total revenue. 
When the price is $5, demand is elastic, and a price increase to $6 reduces total 
revenue. Between $3 and $4, demand is exactly unit elastic and total revenue is the 
same at these two prices. 
In short, the price elasticity of demand need not be the same at all points on a 
demand curve. A demand curve with constant elasticity is possible, but it is a special 
case. A linear demand curve never has a constant elasticity.

5-1g Other Demand Elasticities 
In addition to the price elasticity of demand, economists use other elasticities to 
describe the behavior of buyers in a market. 
The Income Elasticity of Demand The income elasticity of demand measures 
how the quantity demanded changes as consumer income changes. It is calculated 
as the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change 
in income. That is: 
Percentage change in quantity demanded Income elasticity of demand = — Percentage change in income 
As Chapter 4 discussed, most goods are normal goods: Higher income increases 
the quantity demanded. Because quantity demanded and income move in the 
same direction, normal goods have positive income elasticities. A few goods, such 
as bus rides, are inferior goods: This doesn’t mean that anything is wrong with 
them, just that higher income reduces the quantity demanded. Because quantity 
demanded and income move in opposite directions, inferior goods have nega￾tive income elasticities. 
Even among normal goods, income elasticities vary substantially in size. 
Necessities such as food tend to have small income elasticities because consumers 
buy some of these goods even when their incomes are low. (Engel’s Law, named for 
the 19th-century statistician who discovered it, says that as a family’s income rises, 
the percent of its income spent on food declines, indicating an income elasticity less 
than one.) By contrast, luxuries such as diamond jewelry and sailboats tend to ‘have 
large income elasticities because most consumers feel that they can do without them 
altogether when their incomes decline. 
The Cross-Price Elasticity of Demand The cross-price elasticity of demand 
measures how the quantity demanded of one good responds to a change in 
the price of another. It is calculated as the percentage change in the quantity 
demanded of good one divided by the percentage change in the price of good 
two. That is: 
Percentage change in quantity demanded of good one C ice elasticity of demand = ross-price y o Percentage change in the price of good two 
Whether the cross-price elasticity is positive or negative depends on whether 
the two goods are substitutes or complements. As discussed in Chapter 4, 
substitutes are goods that are typically used in place of one another, such as 
hamburgers and hot dogs. When hot dog prices increase, people grill more 
hamburgers instead. Because the price of hot dogs and the quantity of ham￾burgers demanded move in the same direction, the cross-price elasticity is 
positive. Conversely, complements are goods that are typically used together, 
such as computers and software. In this case, the cross-price elasticity is nega￾tive, indicating that an increase in the price of computers reduces the quantity 
of software demanded.

5-2 The Elasticity of Supply 
The discussion of supply in Chapter 4 noted that producers of a good offer to sell 
more of it when its price rises. To turn from qualitative to quantitative statements 
about quantity supplied, economists again use the concept of elasticity. 
5-2a The Price Elasticity of Supply and Its Determinants 
The law of supply states that higher prices increase the quantity supplied. The 
price elasticity of supply measures how much the quantity supplied responds 
to changes in the price. Supply is said to be elastic if the quantity supplied 
responds substantially to price changes and inelastic if the quantity supplied 
responds only slightly. 
The price elasticity of supply depends on the flexibility of sellers to change the 
amount they produce. Beachfront land has an inelastic supply: As Mark Twain once 
advised, “Buy land, they're not making it anymore.” Manufactured goods, such as 
books, cars, and televisions, have elastic supplies because firms that produce them 
can run their factories longer in response to higher prices. 
In most markets, supply is more elastic in the long run than in the short run. The 
reason is simple: Over short periods, firms can produce more by running longer 
shifts, but they can't easily change the size of their factories. Thus, in the short run, 
the quantity supplied is not very responsive to changes in the price. Over longer 
periods of time, firms can build new factories or close old ones. In addition, new 
firms can enter a market, and old ones can exit. Thus, in the long run, the quantity 
supplied responds substantially to price changes.

5-2b The Price Elasticity of Supply, with Numbers 
This is generally how the price elasticity of supply works, but let’s be more precise. 
Economists calculate it as the percentage change in quantity supplied divided by 
the percentage change in price. That is: 
Percentage change in quantity supplied Price elasticity of supply = Percentage change in pri 
For example, suppose that an increase in the price of milk from $2.85 to $3.15 a 
gallon raises the amount that dairy farmers produce from 9,000 to 11,000 gallons 
per month. Using the midpoint method, we calculate the percentage change in 
price as: 
Percentage change in price = (3.15 — 2.85)/3.00 X 100 = 10 percent. 
Similarly, we calculate the percentage change in quantity supplied as: 
Percentage change in quantity supplied = (11,000 — 9,000),/10, 000 X 100 = 20 percent. 
In this case, the price elasticity of supply is: 
20percent 5 Price e elasticity elasticity of supply ly = 10 : 
In this example, the elasticity of 2 indicates that the quantity supplied changes 
proportionately twice as much as the price. 
3-2¢ The Variety of Supply Curves 
The appearance of supply curves reflects the price elasticity of supply. Figure 5 
shows five cases. In the extreme case of zero elasticity, in panel (a), supply is 
perfectly inelastic, and the supply curve is vertical. In this case, the quantity 
supplied is the same regardless of the price. As the elasticity rises, the supply 
curve flattens, showing that the quantity supplied responds more to changes in 
the price. At the opposite extreme, in panel (e), supply is perfectly elastic. This 
occurs as the price elasticity of supply approaches infinity and the supply curve 
becomes horizontal, meaning that tiny price changes lead to large changes in 
the quantity supplied. 
In some markets, the elasticity of supply is not constant but varies over the supply 
curve. Figure 6 shows a typical case for an industry in which firms have factories 
with limited production capacity. For low levels of quantity supplied, the elasticity 
of supply is high, indicating that firms respond substantially to price changes. In 
this region of the supply curve, firms have additional capacity for production, such 
as plants and equipment that are idle for all or part of the day. Small increases in the 
price make it profitable for firms to start using this idle capacity. But as the quantity 
supplied rises, firms approach the limits of their current capacity. Increasing pro￾duction further may require the construction of new factories. But the price must 
rise substantially to justify the extra expense, so in this range, supply is less elastic. 
Figure 6 shows how this works. When the price rises from $3 to $4 (a 29 percent 
increase, using the midpoint method), the quantity supplied rises from 100 to 200

Can good news for farming be bad news for farmers? Why has OPEC, the interna￾tional oil cartel, failed to keep the price of oil high? Does drug interdiction increase 
or decrease drug-related crime? These questions might seem to have little in com￾mon. Yet they are all about markets, and markets are all subject to the forces of 
supply and demand.

5-3a Can Good News for Farming Be Bad News for Farmers? 
Imagine you're a Kansas wheat farmer. Because all your income comes from selling 
wheat, you make your land as productive as possible. You monitor weather and 
soil conditions, check the fields for pests and disease, and study the latest advances 
in farm technology. The more wheat you grow, the more you will harvest, and the 
higher your sales and standard of living will be. 
One day, Kansas State University announces a major discovery. Researchers have 
developed a hybrid of wheat that increases production per acre by 20 percent. How 
should you react? Should you grow this new hybrid? Does this discovery make you 
better or worse off than you were before? 
Recall the three steps from Chapter 4. First, examine whether the supply or 
demand curve shifts. Second, consider the direction of any shift. Third, use a supply￾and-demand diagram to see how the market equilibrium changes. 
In this case, the discovery of the hybrid affects the supply curve. Because the 
hybrid increases production per acre, farmers are willing to supply more wheat at 
any price. In other words, the supply curve shifts to the right. The demand curve 
remains the same because consumers’ desire to buy wheat products at any price is 
not affected by the discovery of the hybrid. Figure 7 shows such a change. When 
the supply curve shifts from 5 to 5,, the quantity of wheat sold increases from 100 
to 110, and the price falls from $3 to §2. 
Does this discovery make farmers better off? Consider what happens to their 
total revenue, which can be written as P X (Q, the price of the wheat times the 
quantity sold. The discovery affects farmers in conflicting ways. The hybrid 
allows farmers to produce more wheat (Q rises), but each bushel of wheat sells 
for less (P falls). 
The price elasticity of demand determines whether total revenue rises or falls. 
Wheat is a central ingredient in many people’s diet. Demand for such basic food￾stuffs is usually inelastic because they are relatively inexpensive and have few good 
substitutes. When the demand curve is inelastic, as in Figure 7, a decrease in the 
Fi 7 
'gure Price of A Supply Increase in the Market for Wheat Wheat 
When a technological advance increases the wheat 
supply from &, to S,, the price falls. Because the 
demand for wheat is inelastic, the increase in 
guantity from 100 to 110 is proportionately smaller 
than the decrease in the price from $3 to $2. As a 
result, farmers' total revenue falls from $300 
($3 > 100) to $220 ($2 x 110).

price causes total revenue to fall. You can see this in the figure: The price of wheat 
falls substantially, while the quantity sold rises only slightly. Total revenue falls from 
$300 to $220. In short, the new hybrid reduces farmers” total revenue. 
If farmers are made worse off by the discovery of this hybrid, why do they adopt 
it? The answer goes to the heart of how competitive markets work. Because each 
farmer represents only a small part of the market for wheat, each takes the price 
as given. For any given price, it is better to produce and sell more wheat, which 
is accomplished using the new hybrid. Yet when all farmers do this, the supply of 
wheat increases, the price falls, and farmers are worse off. 
This example may seem hypothetical, but it helps explain a major change in the 
U.S. economy. Two hundred years ago, most Americans lived on farms. Knowledge 
about agricultural methods was so primitive that most Americans had to be farmers 
to produce enough food to feed the nation’s population. But over time, advances 
in farm technology increased the amount of food that each farmer could produce. 
The increase in food supply, together with the inelastic demand for food, caused 
farm revenues to fall, which led people to leave farming,. 
A few numbers show the magnitude of the change in the United States. In 1900, 
about 12 million people worked on farms, representing 40 percent of the labor force. 
In 2020, about 3 million people worked on farms, representing 2 percent of the labor 
force. Despite the large drop in the number of farmers, U.S. farms fed a population 
that increased more than fourfold, thanks 
to rising productivity. 
This analysis helps explain a curious

5-3b Why Has OPEC Failed to Keep the Price of Oil High? 
Many of the most disruptive events for the world’s economies originated in the world 
market for oil. In the 1970s, members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting 
Countries (OPEC) decided to raise the world price of oil to increase their incomes. 
These countries accomplished this goal by agreeing to jointly reduce the amount 
of oil they supplied. As a result, the price of oil (adjusted for overall inflation) rose 
more than 50 percent from 1973 to 1974. Then, a few years later, OPEC did the same 
thing again. From 1979 to 1981, the price of oil approximately doubled. 
Yet OPEC found it difficult to maintain such a high price. From 1982 to 1985, the 
price of oil steadily declined about 10 percent per year. Dissatisfaction and disar￾ray soon prevailed among the OPEC countries. In 1986, cooperation among OPEC 
members completely broke down, and the price of oil plunged 45 percent. In 1990, 
the price of oil (adjusted for overall inflation) was back to where it began in 1970, 
and it stayed at that low level throughout most of the 1990s. 
The OPEC episodes of the 1970s and 1980s show how supply and demand can 
behave differently in the short run and in the long run. In the short run, both the 
supply and demand for oil are relatively inelastic. Supply is inelastic because the 
quantity of known oil reserves and the capacity for oil extraction cannot be changed 
quickly. Demand is inelastic because buying habits do not respond immediately 
to changes in the price. That's why the short-run supply and demand curves are 
steep, as in panel (a) of Figure 8. When the supply of oil shifts from S, to 5,, the 
price increase from P, to P, is large. 
The situation is very different in the long run. Over extended periods, producers 
of oil outside OPEC respond to high prices by increasing oil exploration and by 
Figura 8 When the supply of oil falls, the response depends on the time horizon. In the short run, 
— - supply and demand are relatively inelastic, as in panel (a). The shift in the supply curve A Reduction in Supply in the from S, to S, leads to a substantial price increase. In the long run, however, supply and

building new extraction capacity. Consumers respond with greater conservation, 
such as by replacing old, inefficient cars with newer, efficient ones. As panel (b) of 
Figure 8 shows, the long-run supply and demand curves are more elastic. In the 
long run, the shift in the supply curve from S, to 5, causes a much smaller increase 
in the price. 
This is why OPEC was able to keep the price of oil high only in the short run. 
When OPEC countries agreed to reduce their production of oil, they shifted 
the supply curve to the left. Even though each OPEC member sold less oil, the 
price rose by so much in the short run that OPEC incomes rose. In the long run, 
however, supply and demand are more elastic. As a result, the same reduction 
in supply, measured by the horizontal shift in the supply curve, caused a smaller 
increase in the price. OPEC learned that raising prices is easier in the short run 
than in the long run. 
During the first two decades of the 21st century, the price of oil fluctuated sub￾stantially once again, but the main driving force was not OPEC supply restrictions. 
Instead, booms and busts in economies around the world caused demand to fluctu￾ate, while advances in fracking technology caused large increases in supply. Going 
forward, a main driving force in the oil market will be the move away from fossil 
fuels, motivated by concerns about global climate change. 
5-3¢ Does Drug Interdiction Increase or Decrease 
Drug-Related Crime? 
The use of illegal drugs, such as heroin, fentanyl, cocaine, ecstasy, and methamphet￾amine, has plagued the United States for decades. Drug use has several pernicious 
effects. Addiction can ruin the lives of drug users and their families. Addicts often 
turn to robbery and other violent crimes to sup pnrt their habit, and when they are 
apprehended, they may spend long stretches in prison. In response to the drug 
epidemic, the U.S. government has devoted billions of dollars each year to reduce 
the flow of drugs into the country. The tools of supply and demand are useful in 
examining the effects of this policy of drug interdiction. 
Suppose the government increases the number of federal agents devoted to stop￾ping drug trafficking. What is the big picture in the market for illegal drugs? As 
usual, the answer comes from the three steps. First, consider whether the supply 
or demand curve shifts. Second, consider the direction of the shift. Third, examine 
how the shift affects the equilibrium price and quantity. 
The direct impact of interdiction is on drug sellers rather than drug buyers. 
When the government stops drugs from entering the country and arrests smug￾glers, it increases the cost of selling drugs and, other things being equal, reduces 
the quantity of drugs supplied at any price. The demand for drugs—the amount 
buyers want at any price—remains the same. As in panel (a) of Figure 9, interdic￾tion shifts the supply curve to the left from §, to 5, without changing the demand 
curve. The equilibrium price of drugs rises from P, to P,, and the equilibrium 
quantity falls from Q to Q,. The fall in the equilibrium quantity shows that drug 
interdiction reduces drug use. 
But what about the amount of drug-related crime? Consider the total amount 
that drug users pay for the drugs they buy. Because few addicts are likely to quit 
in response to a higher price, it is likely that the demand for drugs is inelastic, as 
shown in the figure. If demand is inelastic, then an increase in the price raises total 
revenue in the drug market. That is, because drug interdiction raises the price of 
drugs proportionately more than it reduces drug use, it increases the total amount 
of money that drug users pay for drugs. Addicts would now have an even greater

need for quick cash. The result is inescapable: Drug interdiction could increase drug￾related crime. (And that doesn’t even consider the well-documented economic and 
social damage resulting from the enforcement of drug laws on certain communities, 
particularly among people of color.) 
Because of the adverse effect of drug interdiction, some analysts argue for alter￾native approaches. One is the legalization of some less dangerous drugs, such as 
marijuana. For drugs that remain illegal, rather than trying to reduce the supply, 
policymakers might try to reduce the demand through drug education. Successful 
drug education has the effects shown in panel (b) of Figure 9. The demand curve 
shifts to the left from D, to [D,. As a result, the equilibrium quantity falls from Q, to 
(., and the equilibrium price falls from P, to P,. Total revenue, P X (J, also falls. In 
contrast to drug interdiction, drug education can reduce both drug use and drug￾related crime. 
Advocates of drug interdiction might argue that the long-run effects of this policy 
are different from the short-run effects because the elasticity of demand depends 
on the time horizon. The demand for drugs is probably inelastic over short periods 
because higher prices do not substantially affect drug use by established addicts. But 
it may be more elastic over longer periods because higher prices would discourage 
experimentation with drugs among the young and, over time, lead to fewer drug 
addicts. In this case, drug interdiction would increase drug-related crime in the 
short run but decrease it in the long run.

According to economist Austan 
Goolshee, the supply of ride-shares 
is more elastic than the demand, and 
this fact holds the key to the future of 
this market. 
Passengers May Pay a Lot 
More. Drivers Won't Accept 
Much Less. h}h,;;t;fi'én;fib; R — 
ber and Lyft, the two leading ride-share 
companies, have lost a great deal of money 
and don't project a profit any time soon. 
Yet they are both trading on public markets 
with a combined worth of more than $80 billion. 
Investors presumably expect that these compa￾nies will someday find a path to profitability, 
which lzaves us with a fundamental question: 
Will that extra money come mainly from higher 
prices paid by consumers or from lower wages 
paid to drivers? 
Old-fashioned economics provides an 
answer: Passengers, not drivers, are likely to 
be the main source of financial improvement, 
at least within the next few years, mainly 
because of something called “relative price 
sensitivity.” 
This conclusion may seem to run counter 
to popular wisdom. Wall Street analysts have 
suggested that Uber and Lyft will need to 
squeeze their drivers. Those workers are quite 
concerned about the possibility. Thousands 
went on a one-day strike before Uber's initial 
public offering in May to demand higher pay 
and more benefits. 
And Lyft, in documents filed in connection 
with its own LLP.0., said it hoped to use auton￾omous vehicles, which don’t need a wage, 
for a majority of its rides within 10 years. 
But rather than debate the plausibility—or 
cost—of amassing an autonomous fleet in 
a decade, let’s consider what is possible over 
the short term. 
Economic theory predicts that sensitivity to 
price changes determines who will pay more. 
And it turns out that passengers aren't very 
sensitive to price, while drivers are. 
Yes, surge pricing—the practice of rais￾ing prices when demand is high—makes many 
peaple feel irate. But what people actually do 
is what is important. The most comprehensive 
study of nider behavior in the marketplace found 
that riders didn't change their hehavior much 
when prices surged. (Like most major quantita￾tive studies about Uber, it relied on the com￾pany’s data and included the participation of 
an Uber employes.) 
Passengers were what economists call 
“inelastic,” meaning demand for rides fell 
by less than prices rose. For every 10 percent 
increase in price, demand fell by only about 
5 percent. 
Drivers, on the other hand, are quite sensi￾tive to prices—that is, their wages—Iargely 
because there are so many people who are 
ready to start driving at any time. If prices 
change, people enter or exit the market, push￾ing the average wage to what is known as the 
“market rate.” 
That's what always happens when there are 
no barriers to entry in a market. In 1848, for 
example, at the start of the California gold rush, 
the first miners made about $20 per day, on 
average. The historical data shows that was 
at least 10 times more than the wage for 
workers doing what | would classify as similar 
activities—stone cutting and brick laying—in 
Mew York at that time.

elasticChapter 5 Elasticity and Its Application 
(Over the next eight years, so many people 
moved to California searching for gold that 
miners” average earnings fell to $3 a day, minus 
expenses—barely more than they could have 
made if they had been cutting stones in New York. 
What killed the gold rush wasn't the lack of 
gold—yproduction tripled over that time. It was 
the entry of so many competing miners that drove 
averape eamings down so low that most of them 
barely made enough to stay in business. 
And so it is with ride-share drivers today. 
Another study, by a New York University pro￾fessor and two Uber employees, found the 
same dynamic: Higher prices increased driver 
incomes, but only for a few weeks. 
As new drivers entered the market, attract￾ed by higher wages, the average driver had 
to spend more time waiting for fares. Average 
pay returned to the level economists refer to as 
“the outside option"—the pay level of whatever 
else the drivers could be doing if they weren't 
driving for Uber or Lyft, 
If for many ride-share drivers the next best 
option is delivering for an outfit like Domina's 
Pizza, or working at a fast-food restaurant, then 
average pay for the drivers will likely end up 
around minimum wage, too. 
Some of this is just educated guess￾work. It's not as easy to measure drivers’ 
average wages—and, therefore, their price 
Source: New Fork Times, June 2, 2019, 
sensitivity—as you might think. Since drivers 
pay their own fuel and depreciation expenses, 
we need to subtrack those costs from their eam￾ings, but we don't have good data. 
Still, a major survey of drivers done last 
vear by the analysis firm Ridester showed aver￾age raw earnings for UberX drivers of about 
$15 per hour, before projected deductions of 
about $8 per hour. 
The bad news for the drivers, then, is that 
average pay will be low. Also, even if they con￾vinced ride-share companies to raise the share 
of revenue the drivers keep and to increase 
benefits, the earnings boost would likely be 
ephemeral. Thousands of new drivers would 
enter the more lucrative market, bringing aver￾age earnings back down to the market rate. 
The good news for drivers, though, is that it 
won't be easy for ride-share companies to cut 
wages much lower. Many drivers will simply 
stop driving if wages fall. 
One of the most important studies of driver 
behavior (conducted by professors from Yale 
and U.C.L.A. and, again, one Uber employes), 
confirms the sensitivity of drivers o earn￾ings changes. On average, they increase their 
haurs by 20 percent in response to a 10 percent 
increase in wages, That is about four times 
larger than the response by passengers to 
changes in the price of a ride. 
Economics says that the likelihood that a 
person will bear the burden of an increase in 
profit margins is inversely proportional to their 
price sensitivity. In other words, because drivers 
are four times more price sensitive than riders, 
a reasonable guess is that 80 percent of the 
price burden will fall on passengers, 20 percent 
on drivers. Uber and Lyft are still building their 
networks and market share, which complicates 
matters, and may delay price increases. 
Monetheless, | think that as a passenger, 
you should take your Uber and Lyft rides now, 
while they're still relatively cheap. And, if you're 
an investor counting on wage cuts and robots 
tocarry Uber and Lyft to profit nirvana, you may 
want to buy a certain bridge first. B

5-4 Conclusion 
Even a parrot can become an economist simply by learning to say “supply and 
demand.” That’s an old joke, but these last two chapters should have convinced 
you that there is much truth to it. The tools of supply and demand are useful for 
analyzing the events and policies that shape the economy. You are now well on your 
way to becoming an economist (or at least a well-educated parrot). 
Chapter in a Nutshell 
* The price elasticity of demand measures how much 
the quantity demanded responds to price changes. 
Demand tends to be more elastic if close substitutes are 
available, if the good is a luxury rather than a necessity, 
if the market is narrowly defined, or if buyers have 
substantial time to react to a price change. 
The price elasticity of demand is calculated as the per￾centage change in quantity demanded divided by the 
percentage change in price. If the quantity demanded 
moves proportionately less than the price, then the 
elasticity is less than one, and demand is inelastic. If 
the quantity demanded moves proportionately more 
than the price, then the elasticity is greater than one, 
and demand is elastic. 
Total revenue, the total amount paid for a good, equals 
the price times the quantity sold. For inelastic demand 
curves, total revenue moves in the same direction as 
the price. For elastic demand curves, total revenue 
moves in the opposite direction. 
The income elasticity of demand measures how 
much the quantity demanded responds to changes

in consumers’ income. The cross-price elasticity of 
demand measures how much the quantity demand￾ed of one good responds to changes in the price of 
another. 
The price elasticity of supply measures how much the 
quantity supplied responds to changes in the price. 
This elasticity often depends on the time horizon: In 
most markets, supply is more elastic in the long run 
than in the short run. 
The price elasticity of supply is calculated as the per￾centage change in quantity supplied divided by the 
percentage change in price. If the quantity supplied 
moves proportionately less than the price, then the 
elasticity is less than one, and supply is inelastic. If the 
quantity supplied moves proportionately more than 
the price, then the elasticity is greater than one, and 
supply is elastic. 
The tools of supply and demand can be applied to 
many different markets. This chapter uses them to 
analyze the market for wheat, the market for oil, and 
the market for illegal drugs.

Policies 
conomists have many roles. As scientists, they develop and 
== test theories to explain the world around them. As policy 
analysts and advisers, they try to use these theories to 
change the world. The focus of the preceding two chapters has 
been scientific. The theory of supply and demand explains the 
relationships between the prices of goods and the quantities sold. 
When various events shift supply and demand, the equilibrium 
price and quantity change. The concept of elasticity helps to 
gauge the size of these changes. This theory is the foundation for 
much of economics. 
This chapter is about policy. Here, we analyze several types of 
government policy using the tools of supply and demand, with 
some surprising insights. Policies often have effects that their archi￾tects did not anticipate. 
Efforts to control prices are worthy of close consideration. In 
this category, we examine rent-control laws, which set a maximum 
fee that landlords may charge tenants, and minimum-wage laws, 
which set a pay threshold below which employers must not go. 
Policymakers often enact price controls when they believe that the 
market price of a good or service is too high or too low. Yet these 
policies can generate problems of their own.

After price controls, we consider the impact of taxes. Policymakers use taxes 
to raise revenue and to influence market outcomes. The prevalence of taxes in the 
economy is obvious, but their effects are not. For example, when the government 
levies a tax on the amount that firms pay their workers, do the firms or workers 
bear the burden of the tax? The answer is not clear—until we apply the powerful 
tools of supply and demand. 
6-1 The Surprising Effects of Price Controls 
price ceiling 
a legal maximum on the 
price at which a good 
can be sold 
price floor 
a legal minimum on the 
price at which a good 
can be sold 
To see how price controls affect market outcomes, let’s return to the market for 
ice cream. As we saw in Chapter 4, if ice cream is sold in a competitive market, 
the price normally adjusts to balance supply and demand: At the equilibrium 
price, the quantity of ice cream that buyers want to buy exactly equals the quan￾tity that sellers want to sell. To be concrete, suppose that the equilibrium price 
is $3 per cone. 
Some people may not like this outcome. The American Association of Ice-Cream 
Eaters complains that the $3 price is too high for everyone to enjoy a cone a day 
(their recommended daily allowance). Meanwhile, the National Organization of 
Ice-Cream Makers complains that the $3 price—the result of “cutthroat competition”—is 
so low that it is depressing the incomes of its members. Each group lobbies the 
government to alter the market outcome by passing laws that control the price of 
an ice-cream cone. 
Because buyers usually want a lower price while sellers want a higher one, 
the interests of the two groups conflict. If the Ice-Cream Eaters are successful in 
their lobbying, the government imposes a legal maximum on the price at which 
ice-cream cones can be sold. Because the price is not allowed to rise above this 
level, the legislated maximum is called a price ceiling. By contrast, if the Ice￾Cream Makers are successful, the government imposes a legal minimum on the 
price. Because the price cannot fall below this level, the legislated minimum is 
called a price floor. 
6-1a How Price Ceilings Affect Market Outcomes 
When the government, moved by the complaints and campaign contributions 
of the Ice-Cream Eaters, imposes a price ceiling in the market for ice cream, two 
outcomes are possible. In panel (a) of Figure 1, the government imposes a price 
ceiling of $4 per cone. In this case, because the price that balances supply and 
demand ($3) is below the ceiling, the price ceiling is not binding. Market forces 
move the economy to the equilibrium, and the ceiling has no effect on the price 
or on the quantity sold. 
Panel (b) of Figure 1 shows another, more interesting possibility. In this case, the 
government imposes a price ceiling of $2 per cone. Because the equilibrium price of 
$3 is above the price ceiling, the ceiling is a binding constraint on the market. The 
forces of supply and demand tend to move the price toward equilibrium, but the 
ceiling prevents the market price from reaching it. Instead, the market price must 
be the price ceiling. At this price, the quantity of ice cream demanded (125 cones 
in the figure) exceeds the quantity supplied (75 cones). With excess demand of 
50 cones, some people who want ice cream at the going price can’t buy it. The price 
ceiling has created an ice-cream shortage.

A Market with a Price Ceiling equilibrium of supply and demand. At this point, quantity supplied and quantity 
demanded both equal 100 cones. In panel (b), the government imposes a price ceiling of 
$2. Because the ceiling is below the equilibrium price of $3, the market price is $2. At 
this price, 125 cones are demanded while anly 75 are supplied, so there is a shortage of 
50 cones.

In response to the shortage, a mechanism for rationing ice cream will naturally 
develop. It could be long lines: Buyers who arrive early and wait in line (or pay 
others to do so) get a cone, while those who can’t or won't do this must go without. 
Another possibility is that sellers ration ice-cream cones according to their own 
personal biases, selling only to friends, relatives, members of their own racial or 
ethnic group, or those who provide favors in return. Clearly, even though the price 
ceiling was intended to help buyers of ice cream, not all buyers benefit from the 
policy. Some buyers pay a lower price, though they may have to wait in line to do 
so, but others cannot get any ice cream at all. 
This illustrates a general result: When the government imposes a binding price 
ceiling on a competitive market, a shortage arises, and sellers must ration scarce 
goods among potential buyers. The rationing mechanisms that develop under price 
ceilings are rarely desirable. Long lines are inefficient because they waste buyers’ 
time. Relying on the biases of sellers is both inefficient (because the good may not 
go to the buyer who values it most) and unfair. By contrast, the rationing mecha￾nism in a free, competitive market is straightforward. When the market reaches its 
equilibrium, anyone who wants to pay the market price can buy the good. This may 
seem unfair to some buyers when prices are high, but it is efficient and impersonal. 
You don’t need to be the ice-cream maker's friend or relative to buy a cone. You just 
need to be able and willing to pay $3.

How to Create Long Lines at the Gas Pump 
Chapter 5 discussed how, in 1973, the Organization of Petroleum 
Exporting Countries (OPEC) reduced production of crude oil and 
increased its price. Because crude oil is used to make gasoline, the 
higher oil prices reduced the supply of gasoline. Long lines at gas stations became 
common, with motorists often waiting for hours to buy a few gallons of gas. 
What caused the long gas lines? Most people blamed OPEC. To be sure, if it 
had not reduced production of crude oil, the gasoline shortage would not have 
occurred. Yet economists found another culprit: U.S. government regulations that 
set a ceiling on the price of gasoline. 
Figure 2 reveals what happened. As panel (a) shows, before OPEC raised the 
price of crude oil, the equilibrium price of gasoline, P, was below the price ceiling. 
The price regulation, therefore, had no effect. When the price of crude oil rose, how￾ever, the situation changed. The increase in the price of crude oil raised the cost of 
producing gasoline and thereby reduced the supply of gasoline. As panel (b) shows, 
the supply curve shifted to the left from 5, to 5,. In an unregulated market, this shift 
in supply would have raised the equilibrium price of gasoline from P, to P,, and no 
shortage would have occurred. Instead, the price ceiling prevented the price from 
rising to the equilibrium level. At the price ceiling, producers were willing to sell 
(0., but consumers were willing to buy Q,,. The supply shift caused a severe short￾age at the regulated price. 
Figure 2 Panel (a) shows the gasoline market when the price ceiling is not binding because the 
equilibrium price, P, is below the ceiling. Panel (b} shows the gasoline market after an 
The _Ma'“f* _hr Gasoline with increase in the price of crude oil (an input into making gasoline) shifts the supply curve 
a Price Ceiling to the left from S, to S,. In an unregulated market, the price would have risen from P, to 
P,. The price ceiling, however, prevents this from happening. At the binding price ceiling, 
consumers are willing to buy Q,, but producers of gasoline are willing to sell only @.. 
The difference between quantity demanded and quantity supplied, @, — @, measures the 
gasoline shortage.

Eventually, the laws regulating the price of gasoline were repealed. Lawmakers 
came to understand that they were partly responsible for the many hours 
Americans lost waiting in line to buy gasoline. Today, when the price of crude 
oil changes, the price of gasoline adjusts freely to bring supply and demand into 
equilibrium. ® 
Why Rent Control Causes Housing Shortages, 
Especially in the Long Run 
In many cities, the local government places a ceiling on rents that 
landlords may charge their tenants. This is rent control, a policy 
aimed at helping the poor by keeping housing costs low. Yet economists often 
criticize rent control, saying that it is a highly inefficient way to help the poor. One 
economist went so far as to call rent control “the best way to destroy a city, other 
than bombing." 
The adverse effects of rent control may not be apparent because these effects 
occur over many vears. In the short run, landlords have a fixed number of apart￾ments to rent, and they cannot adjust this number quickly as market conditions 
change. Moreover, the number of people looking for apartments may not be highly 
responsive to rents in the short run because people take time to adjust their housing 
arrangements. In other words, the short-run supply and demand for housing are 
both relatively inelastic. 
Panel (a) of Figure 3 shows the short-run effects of rent control on the hous￾ing market. As with any binding price ceiling, rent control causes a shortage. But

Ask the 
because supply and demand are inelastic in the short run, the initial shortage is 
small. The primary result in the short run is popular among tenants: a reduction in 
rents. 
The long-run story is very different because the buyers and sellers of rental 
housing respond more to market conditions as time passes. On the supply side, 
landlords respond to low rents by not building new apartments and by failing to 
maintain existing ones. On the demand side, low rents encourage people to find 
their own apartments (rather than live with roommates or their parents) and to 
move into the city. Therefore, both supply and demand are more elastic in the 
long run. 
Panel (b) of Figure 3 illustrates the housing market in the long run. When rent 
control depresses rents below the equilibrium level, the quantity of apartments 
supplied falls substantially, and the quantity of apartments demanded rises sub￾stantially. The result is a large shortage of housing,. 
In cities with rent control, landlords and building superintendents use vari￾ous mechanisms to ration housing. Some keep long waiting lists. Others give 
preference to tenants without children. Still others discriminate based on race. 
Sometimes, apartments are allocated to those willing to offer under-the-table 
payments; these bribes bring the total price of an apartment closer to the equi￾librium price. 
Recall one of the Ten Principles of Economics from Chapter 1: People respond 
to incentives. In well-functioning markets, landlords can command higher prices 
if they keep their buildings clean and safe. But when rent control creates shortages 
and waiting lists, landlords lose that incentive. Why spend money to maintain 
and improve the property when people are waiting to move in as it is? In the end, 
rent control reduces what tenants have to pay, but it also lowers the quantity and 
quality of a city’s housing stock. 
When these adverse effects become evident, policymakers often react by 
imposing additional regulations. For example, various laws make racial dis￾crimination in housing illegal and require landlords to provide minimally 
adequate living conditions. These laws, however, are difficult 
and costly to enforce. By contrast, without rent control, such 
laws are less necessary because the market for housing is

that the National Organization of Ice-Cream Makers persuades 
the government that the $3 equilibrium price is too low. In this 
case, the government might institute a price floor. Price floors, 
like price ceilings, are an attempt by the government to maintain 
prices at other than equilibrium levels. While a price ceiling 
places a legal maximum on prices, a price tloor places a legal 
minimaum.

When the government imposes a price floor on ice cream, two outcomes are 
possible. If the floor is $2 per cone but the equilibrium price is $3, nothing hap￾pens. Because the equilibrium price is above the floor, the price floor is not bind￾ing. Market forces move the economy to the equilibrium, and the price floor has 
no effect. Panel (a) of Figure 4 shows this outcome. 
Panel (b) of Figure 4 shows what happens when the government imposes a 
price floor of $4 per cone, which is higher than the equilibrium price of $3. In this 
case, the price floor is a binding constraint on the market. The forces of supply 
and demand tend to move the price toward the equilibrium price, but the price 
can’t go below the floor. As a result, the price floor becomes the market price. At 
this level, the quantity of ice cream supplied (120 cones) exceeds the quantity 
demanded (80 cones). There is an excess supply of 40 cones. In other words, some 
people who want to sell ice cream at the going price have no buyers: A binding 
price floor causes a surplus. 
Just as shortages caused by price ceilings can lead to undesirable rationing mecha￾nisms, so can the surpluses resulting from price floors. The sellers who appeal to 
the buyers’ personal biases may be better able to sell their goods than those who 
do not. By contrast, in a free market, the price is the rationing mechanism. Sellers 
may not be happy about how much they are paid at the equilibrium price, but they 
can sell all they want. 
Figure 4 
A Market with a Price Floor 
In panel (a), the government imposes a price floor of $2. Because it is below the 
equilibrium price of $3, the floor has no effect, and the market can reach the equilibrium 
of supply and demand. At this point, quantity supplied and demanded both equal 
100 cones. In panel (b), the government imposes a price floor of $4. Because the floor 
is above the equilibrium price of $3, the market price is $4. At this price, 120 cones 
are supplied while only 80 are demanded, so there is a surplus of 40 cones.

Figure 5 
How the Minimum Wage Affects 
a Competitive Labor Market 
Controversies over the Minimum Wage 
The minimum wage is an important and contentious example of a 
price floor. Minimum-wage laws set the lowest price for labor that 
any employer may pay. The U.S. Congress first instituted a minimum 
wage with the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to ensure workers a minimally 
adequate standard of living. 
In 2021, the minimum wage according to federal law was $7.25 per hour. In 
addition, many states and cities mandate minimum wages above the federal level. 
The minimum wage in Seattle, for instance, was $16.69 per hour for large employ￾ers in 2021. Most European nations also have laws that establish a minimum wage, 
often much higher than in the United States. For example, even though the aver￾age income in France is almost 30 percent lower than it is in the United States, the 
French minimum wage is more than 50 percent higher. 
To see what the theory of supply and demand predicts for the effects of a mini￾mum wage, consider the market for labor. Panel (a) of Figure 5 shows a competitive 
labor market, which, like all competitive markets, is subject to the forces of supply 
and demand. Workers supply labor, and firms demand labor. If the government 
doesn’t intervene, the wage adjusts to balance labor supply and labor demand. 
Panel (b) of Figure 5 shows the labor market with a minimum wage. If the 
minimum wage is above the equilibrium level, as it is here, the quantity of labor 
supplied exceeds the quantity demanded. The result is a surplus of labor, or unem￾ployment. While the minimum wage raises the incomes of those workers who have 
jobs, it lowers the incomes of would-be workers who now cannot find jobs. 
Panel (a) shows a labor market in which the wage adjusts to balance labor supply and labor 
demand. Panel (b) shows the impact of a binding minimum wage. Because the minimum 
wage is a price floor, it causes a surplus: The quantity of labor supplied exceeds the 
quantity demanded. The result is unemployment.

To fully understand the minimum wage, keep in mind that the economy 
contains not a single labor market but many labor markets for different types of 
workers. The impact of the minimum wage depends on the skill and experience of 
the worker. Highly skilled and experienced workers are not affected because their 
equilibrium wages are well above the minimum. For these workers, the minimum 
wage is not binding. 
The minimum wage has its greatest impact on the market for teenage labor. 
The equilibrium wages of teenagers are low because teenagers are among the least 
skilled and least experienced members of the labor force. In addition, teenagers 
are often willing to accept a lower wage in exchange for on-the-job training. (Some 
teenagers are willing to work as interns for no pay at all. Because many intern￾ships pay nothing, minimum-wage laws often do not apply to them. If they did, 
some of these internship opportunities might not exist.) As a result, the minimum 
wage is binding more often for teenagers than for other members of the labor 
force. 
Many economists have studied how minimum-wage laws affect the teenage 
labor market. These researchers compare the changes in the minimum wage over 
time with the changes in teenage employment. Although there is some debate 
about the effects of minimum wages, the typical study finds that a 10 percent 
increase in the minimum wage depresses teenage employment by 1 to 3 percent. 
One drawback of most minimum-wage studies is that they focus on the effects 
over short periods. For exampl:—:-, they rmght compare employment the year before 
and the year after a change in the minimum wage. The longer-term effects on 
em}:-lcojr ment are harder to estimate reliably, but they are more relevant for evaluat￾ing the policy. Because it takes time for firms to reorganize the workplace, the long￾run decline in employment from a higher minimum wage may be larger than the 
estimated short-run decline. 
In addition to altering the quantity of labor demanded, the minimum wage 
alters the quantity t.upphed Because the minimum wage raises the wage that 
teenagers can earn, it increases the number of teenagers who choose to look for 
jobs. Some studies have found that a higher minimum wage also influences which 
teenagers are employed. When the minimum wage rises, some teenagers who are 
still attending high school choose to drop out and take jobs. With more people 
vying for the available jobs, some of these new dropouts displace other teenagers 
who had already dropped out of school, and these displaced teenagers become 
unemployed. 
The minimum wage is a frequent topic of debate. Advocates of a higher mini￾mum wage view the policy as a humane way to raise the income of the working 
poor. They correctly point out that workers who earn the minimum wage can afford 
only a meager standard of living. In 2021, for instance, when the minimum wage 
was $7.25 per hour, two adults working 40 hours a week for every week of the year 
at minimum-wage jobs had a joint annual income of only $30,160. This amount 
was only about 40 percent of the median family income in the United States. Some 
proponents of a higher minimum wage contend that labor markets are not well 
explained using the theory of supply and demand in competitive markets, so they 
doubt the theory’s predictions regarding unemployment. Others acknowledge 
that the policy has some adverse effects, including job loss, but say these effects 
are small and that, all things considered, a higher minimum wage makes the poor 
better off. 
Opponents of raising the minimum wage contend that it is not the best way 
to combat poverty. They say that a high minimum wage causes unemployment,

6-1c Evaluating Price Controls 
One of the Ten Principles of Economics in Chapter 1 is that markets are usually a 
good way to organize economic activity. It is why economists often oppose price 
ceilings and price floors. To economists, prices are not the outcome of some hap￾hazard process. Prices, they say, are the result of millions of business and consumer 
decisions that lie behind the supply and demand curves. Prices have the crucial 
job of balancing supply and demand and, thereby, coordinating economic activity. 
Government price-setting obscures the signals that would otherwise guide the 
allocation of society’s resources. 
That’s just one side of the story. Another of the Ten Principles of Economics is 
that governments can sometimes improve market outcomes. Indeed, policymakers 
are often motivated to control prices because they view the market’s outcome as 
unfair. Price controls are frequently aimed at helping the poor. For instance, rent￾control laws try to make housing affordable for everyone, and minimum-wage laws 
try to help people escape poverty. 
Yet price controls can hurt some people they are intended to help. Rent control 
keeps rents low, but it also discourages landlords from maintaining their buildings 
and makes housing hard to find. Minimum-wage laws raise the incomes of some 
workers, but they can also lead to job losses for others. 
Helping those in need can be accomplished in ways other than controlling 
prices. For instance, the government can make housing more affordable by paying 
a fraction of the rent for poor families or by giving them cash transfers so they 
can pay the rent themselves. Unlike rent control, such subsidies do not reduce 
the quantity of housing supplied and, therefore, do not lead to housing short￾ages. Similarly, wage subsidies raise the living standards of the working poor 
without discouraging firms from hiring them. An example of a wage subsidy 
is the earned income tax credit, a government program that supplements the 
incomes of low-wage workers. 
These alternative policies are often better than price controls, but they are not 
perfect. Applying for rent or wage subsidies can be a burden for poor people. In 
addition, rent and wage subsidies cost the government money and, therefore, require 
higher taxes. As the next section shows, taxation has costs of its own.

6-2 The Surprising Study of Tax Incidence 
All governments—from national governments around the world to local govern￾ments in small towns—use taxes to raise revenue for public projects, such as roads, 
schools, and national defense. Because taxes are such an important policy instrument 
and affect our lives in many ways, they appear throughout this book. This section 
begins our study of how taxes affect the economy. 
To set the stage for the analysis, imagine that a local government decides to hold 
an annual ice-cream celebration—with a parade, fireworks, and speeches by town 
bigwigs. To raise revenue for the event, the town will place a $0.50 tax on each sale 
of an ice-cream cone. When the plan is announced, our two lobbying groups swing 
into action. The American Association of Ice-Cream Eaters claims that consumers 
of ice cream are having trouble making ends meet, and it argues that sellers of ice 
cream should pay the tax. The National Organization of Ice-Cream Makers claims 
that its members are struggling to survive in a competitive market, and it argues 
that buyers of ice cream should pay the tax. The mayor, hoping for a compromise, 
suggests that buyers and sellers each pay half the tax. 
To assess the proposals, ask a simple but subtle question: When the government 
levies a tax on a good, who actually bears the burden of the tax? The people buy￾ing the good? The people selling it? Or, if buyers and sellers share the tax burden, 
what determines how it is divided? Can the government make that decision, as the 
mayor suggests, or do market forces intervene? These issues involve tax incidence, 
the study of how the burden of a tax is distributed among the various people in 
the economy. The tools of supply and demand will reveal some surprising lessons 
about tax incidence. 
6-2a How Taxes on Sellers Affect Market Outcomes 
Let’s begin with a tax levied on sellers. Suppose sellers of ice-cream cones are 
required to send the local government $0.50 for every cone they sell. How does 
this law affect the buyers and sellers of ice cream? To answer this question, follow

In 2021, President Biden proposed 
4 minimum wage of 13 an hour, an 
idea that was controversial among 
both politicians and economists. 
Raising the Minimum Wage 
Will Definitely Cost Jobs 
By David Neumark 
recent Congressional Budget Office report 
estimated that 1.4 million jobs would be 
lost if a new $15 federal minimum wage is 
signed into law, Advocates were quick to dis￾miss the CBO's conclusion. “Itis not a stretch to 
say that a new consensus has emerged among 
economists that minimum wage increases 
have raised wages without substantial job 
loss,” said Heidi Shierholz of the Economic 
Policy Institute, which has also circulated a 
|etter signed by economics Nobel laureates and 
others making the same claim. 
As | show in a recent extensive survey of 
research on minimum wages and job loss in 
the U.5., this is simply not true. Most studies 
find that a minimum wage reduces employment 
of low-skilled workers, especially the lowest 
earners most directly affected by raising the 
minimum wage. 
There are conflicting individual studies of 
the effects of minimum wages on employment. 
That there is disagreement shouldn't be sur￾prising. Economics is a social science, not a 
natural one. Studies of minimum wages and 
job loss are not laboratory experiments. They 
can't be replicated and 50 can't be expected 
to yield exactly the same results. 
What's surprising, though, is that sum￾maries of the research literature make contra￾dictory claims about what the overall body of 
evidence says. Distinguished economists like 
Angus Deaton and Peter Diamond signed the 
EPI letter asserting that the research shows 
little or no evidence of job loss, whereas oth￾ers look at the research and conclude that 
it points to job loss. How can that be? Who 
is right? 
Most economists have a strong stance 
an the minimum wage one way or the other. 
Perhaps this colors how they look at and 
interpret the evidence. Or perhaps there are 
50 many studies of the employment effects 
of minimum wages that it is difficult to keep 
a “scorecard” of what the overall body of 
evidence says. 
To provide an accurate reading of the 
research, Peter Shirley and | surveyed the 
authors of nearly all U.5. studies estimating 
the effects of minimum wages on employment 
published in the past 30 years. We asked them 
to report to us their best estimate of the employ￾ment effect, measured as the “elasticity,” or 
the percent change in employment for each 
1-percent change in the minimum wage. Most 
authors responded, and in the few cases in 
which they did not, we pulled this estimate 
from their study. 
The results are stark. Across all studies, 
79 percent report that minimum wages reduced 
employment. In 46 percent of studies the 
negative effect was statistically significant. 
In contrast, only 21 percent of studies found 
small positive effects of minimum wages on 
employment, and in only a minuscule percent￾age (4 percent) was the evidence statistically 
significant. A simplistic but useful calculation 
shows that the odds of nearly 80 percent of 
studies finding negative employment effects 
if the true effect is zero is less than one in 
a million. 
Across all the studies, the average 
employment elasticity is about minus 0.15, 
which means, for example, that a 10-percent 
the law affects the supply curve or the demand curve. (2) Decide which way the 
curve shifts. (3) Examine how the shift affects the equilibrium price and quantity. 
Step One The immediate impact of the tax is on the sellers. Because the tax is not 
imposed on buyers, the quantity demanded at any price remains the same; thus, the 
demand curve does not change. By contrast, the tax on sellers makes the ice-cream 
business less profitable at any price, so it shifts the supply curve. 
Step Two Because the tax on sellers raises the cost of producing and selling ice 
cream, it reduces the quantity supplied at every price. The supply curve shifts to 
the left (or, equivalently, upward). 
Let's be precise about the size of the shift. For any market price of ice cream, the 
effective price to sellers—the amount they keep after paying the tax—is $0.50 lower. 
For example, if the market price of a cone happened to be $2.00, the effective price 
received by sellers would be $1.50. Whatever the market price, the effective price

increase in the minimum wage reduces 
employment of the low-skilled by 1.5 percent. 
Extrapolating this to a $15 minimum wage, 
this 107-percent increase in the states where 
the federal minimum wage of $7.25 now pre￾vails would imply a 16-percent decline in low￾skilled employment (broadly consistent with 
the recent GBO study). That sounds like a 
substantial job loss. 
It's true that some workers would expe￾rience higher incomes, and that, on net, 
incomes of low-wage workers would prob￾ably rise. But that doesn’t mean the mini￾mum wage is the best way to help low-wage 
workers or low-income families, as research 
clearly demonstrates that a large share of 
income gains from a higher minimum wage 
flows to families with higher incomes. An 
alternative policy—the Earned Income Tax 
Credit—targets benefits to lower-income 
families far more effectively, is proven to 
reduce poverty, and creates rather than 
destroys jobs. 
Our survey finds other important results. 
First, contrary to what is sometimes claimed, 
there is no tendency for the most recent 
research to provide less evidence of job loss. 
Second, the sharper a study's focus on workers 
directly affected by the minimum wage, the

for sellers is 50.50 less, and sellers supply a quantity of ice cream that is appropriate 
for that lower price. In other words, to induce sellers to supply any given quantity, 
the market price must now be $0.50 higher to compensate for the effect of the tax. 
As Figure 6 shows, the supply curve shifts upward from 5, to 5, by the exact size 
of the tax ($0.50). 
Step Three Having determined how the supply curve shifts, let's now compare 
the initial and the new equilibria. Figure 6 shows that the equilibrium price of ice 
cream rises from $3.00 to $3.30, and the equilibrium quantity falls from 100 to 90 
cones. Because sellers now sell less and buyers buy less, the tax reduces the size of 
the ice-cream market. 
Implications Now consider the question of tax incidence: Who pays the tax? 
Although sellers, not buyers, send the money to the government, buyers and sellers 
share the burden. Because the tax increases the market price from $3.00 to $3.30,

buyers pay $0.30 more for ice-cream cones. Sellers get a higher price ($3.30), but 
after paying the tax, they only keep $2.80 ($3.30 — $0.50 = $2.80), which is $0.20 less 
than they did before. The tax makes both buyers and sellers worse off. 
To sum up, this analysis vields two lessons: 
¢ Taxes discourage market activity. When a good is taxed, the quantity sold is 
smaller in the new equilibrium. 
¢ Buyers and sellers share the tax burden. In the new equilibrium, buyers pay 
more, and sellers receive less. 
6-2b How Taxes on Buyers Affect Market Outcomes 
MNow consider a tax levied on buyers. Suppose that ice-cream lovers are required 
to send $0.50 to the local government for each cone they buy. What are the law’s 
effects? Let’s again turn to our three steps. 
Step One The immediate impact is on the demand for ice cream. The supply 
curve doesn’t change because, for any price, sellers have the same incentive to 
provide ice cream to the market. But buyers now have to pay a tax to the gov￾ernment (on top of the price to the sellers), so the tax shifts the demand curve 
for ice cream. 
Step Two Next, determine the direction of the shift. Because the tax makes buying 
ice cream less attractive, buyers demand a smaller quantity of ice cream at every 
price. The demand curve shifts to the left (or, equivalently, downward), as shown 
in Figure 7. 
Once again, let's be precise about the size of the shift. Because of the $0.50 tax 
on buyers, their effective price is now $0.50 higher than whatever the market price 
happens to be. For example, if the market price of a cone were $2.00, buyers would 
face an effective price for buyers of $2.50. Because buyers look at their total cost,

including the tax, they demand a quantity of ice cream as if the market price were 
$0.50 higher than it actually is. In other words, to induce buyers to demand any 
given quantity, the market price must now be $0.50 lower to make up for the effect 
of the tax. The tax shifts the demand curve downward from D, to D, by the exact 
size of the tax ($0.50). 
Step Three Let's now evaluate the effect of the tax by comparing the initial 
equilibrium with the new one. In Figure 7, the equilibrium price of ice cream falls 
from $3.00 to 52.80, and the equilibrium quantity drops from 100 to 90 cones. Once 
again, the tax reduces the size of the ice-cream market. And once again, buyers 
and sellers share the burden. Sellers get a lower price for their product; buyers 
pav a lower market price to sellers than they previously did, but the effective price 
(including the tax) rises from $3.00 to $3.30. 
Implications If you compare Figures 6 and 7, you will notice a surprising conclusion: 
Taxes on sellers and taxes on buyers are equivalent. In both cases, the tax inserts a 
wedge between the price that buyers pay and the price that sellers receive. Regardless 
of whether the tax is levied on buyers or sellers, the wedge remains the same. In either 
case, it shifts the relative position of the supply and demand curves. In the new equi￾librium, buyers and sellers share the tax burden. The only difference between a tax on 
sellers and a tax on buyers is who sends the money to the government. 
To better understand the equivalence of these two taxes, imagine the government 
collects the $0.50 ice-cream tax in a bowl on the counter of cach ice-cream store. When 
the tax is imposed on sellers, the sellers are required to place $0.50 in the bowl each time 
they sell a cone. When the tax is imposed on buyers, the buyers must place $0.50 in 
the bowl whenever they buy a cone. Whether the $0.50 goes directly from the buyer’s 
pocket into the bowl, or indirectly from the buyer’s pocket into the seller’s hand and 
then into the bowl, does not matter. Once the market reaches its new equilibrium, 
buyers and sellers share the burden, regardless of how the tax is levied.

Can Congress Distribute the Burden of a Payroll Tax? 
If you have ever received a paycheck, you probably noticed that taxes 
were deducted from the amount you earned. One of these taxes is called 
FICA, an acronym for the Federal Insurance Contributions Act. The fed￾eral government uses the revenue from the FICA tax to pay for Social Security and 
Medicare, the income support and healthcare programs for older Americans. FICA is 
a payroll tax, which is a tax on the wages that firms pay their workers. In 2021, the 
total FICA tax for the typical worker was 15.3 percent of earnings. 
Who bears the burden of this payroll tax—firms or workers? When Congress 
passed this legislation, it tried to divide the tax burden. According to the law, half 
of the tax is paid by firms and half by workers. That is, half of the tax is paid out 
of firms’ revenues, and half is deducted from workers’ paychecks. The amount 
that shows up as a deduction on your pay stub is the worker contribution. (Self￾employed people generally pay the whole tax themselves.) 
Qwr analysis of tax incidence, however, shows that lawmakers cannot dictate the 
distribution of a tax burden so easily. A payroll tax is analyzed much the same as a 
tax on a good like ice cream. In this case, the good is labor, and the price is the wage. 
Again, the tax inserts a wedge—here, between the wage that firms pay and the 
wage that workers receive (AKA “take-home pay”). Figure 8 shows the outcome. 
When a payroll tax is enacted, the wage received by workers falls, and the wage 
paid by firms rises. In the end, workers and firms share the burden, much as the 
legislation requires. Yet this economic division has nothing to do with the legislated 
one: The division of the tax burden in Figure 8 is not necessarily 50-50, and the same 
outcome would prevail if the law imposed the entire tax on either workers or firms. 
This example highlights an often overlooked lesson. Lawmakers can decide 
whether a tax comes from the buyer’s pocket or from the seller’s, but they cannot 
legislate the true burden of a tax. Rather, tax incidence depends on the forces of sup￾ply and demand. @

6-2¢ Elasticity and Tax Incidence 
How exactly is the tax burden divided between buyers and sellers? Only rarely 
will it be shared equally. To see this, consider the impact of taxation on the two 
markets in Figure 9. In both cases, the figure shows the initial supply and demand 
curves and a tax that drives a wedge between what buyers pay and sellers receive. 
(Not drawn in either panel is the new supply or demand curve. Which curve shifts 
depends on whether the tax is levied on buyers or sellers, a fact that is irrelevant 
for determining the tax’s incidence.) The difference between the two panels is the 
relative elasticity of supply and demand.

Panel (a) of Figure 9 shows a tax in a market with very elastic supply and rela￾tively inelastic demand. That means that sellers are very responsive to changes in 
the price (so the supply curve is relatively flat), while buyers are not very respon￾sive (so the demand curve is relatively steep). When a tax is imposed on a market 
like this one, the price received by sellers does not fall much, so sellers bear only a 
small burden. But the price paid by buyers rises substantially, indicating that they 
bear most of the tax burden. 
Panel (b) of Figure 9 shows a tax in a market with fairly inelastic supply and very 
clastic demand. In this case, sellers are not very responsive to changes in the price (so 
the supply curve is steeper), while buyers are very responsive (so the demand curve 
is flatter). When a tax is imposed, the price paid by buyers doesn't rise much, but the 
price received by sellers falls substantially. Thus, sellers bear most of the tax burden. 
Together, the two panels show a general lesson: A tax burden falls more heavily 
on the side of the market that is less elastic. Why is this true? In essence, elasticity 
measures the willingness of buyers or sellers to leave the market when conditions 
worsen. A small elasticity of demand means that buyers do not have good alterna￾tives to consuming this particular good. A small elasticity of supply means that 
sellers do not have good alternatives to producing this particular good. When the 
good is taxed, the side of the market with fewer good alternatives is less willing to 
leave the market and bears more of the burden of the tax. 
This logic applies to the payroll tax discussed in the previous case study. Because 
economists have generally found that labor supply is less elastic than labor demand, 
workers, rather than firms, bear most of the burden of the payroll tax. In other 
words, the distribution of the tax burden is far from the 50-50 split that lawmak￾ers intended. 
Who Pays the Luxury Tax? 
In 1990, Congress adopted a luxury tax on items such as yvachts, pri￾vate airplanes, furs, jewelry, and high-end cars. The goal was to raise 
revenue from those who could most easily afford to pay. Because only 
the rich could afford such extravagances, taxing luxuries seemed like a logical 
way of doing that. 
Yet, when the forces of supply and demand took over, the outcome was not what 
Congress intended. Consider the market for yachts, for example. The demand in 
this market is quite elastic. A billionaire can easily not buy a yacht; the money can 
be used to buy an island, take a more luxurious vacation, or leave a larger bequest 
to heirs. By contrast, the supply of yachts is relatively inelastic, at least in the short 
run. The shipyards that produce yachts are not easily converted to 
alternative uses, and the workers who work there are not eager to 
change jobs in response to changing market conditions. 
Our analysis makes a clear prediction. With elastic demand and 
inelastic supply, the tax burden falls largely on the suppliers. In this 
case, a tax on yachts places the burden largely on the businesses and 
workers who build yachts because they end up getting significantly 
less for their vessels. The workers are not wealthy, even if some of the 
business owners are. In the end, the burden of a luxury tax can fall 
more on the middle-class workers than on the rich customers. 
The mistaken assumptions about the incidence of the luxury tax 
quickly became apparent after it went into effect. Suppliers of luxuries 
“If this boat were any more expensive, made their elected representatives well aware of their problems, and 
we'd be playing golf.” Congress repealed most of the luxury tax in 1993. @

6-3 Conclusion 
Answers are at the end of the chapter. 
The economy is governed by two kinds of laws: the laws of supply and demand 
and the laws enacted by governments. In this chapter, we have begun to see how 
these laws interact. Price controls and taxes are common in various markets, and 
their effects are frequently debated. Even a little bit of economic knowledge can go 
a long way toward understanding and evaluating these policies. 
Subsequent chapters analyze government policies in greater detail. We will exam￾ine the effects of taxation more fully and consider a broader range of policies. Yet 
the basic lessons will not change: When analyzing government policies, supply and 
demand are the first and most useful tools of analysis. 
Chapter in a Nutshell 
* A price ceiling is a legal maximum on the price of a 
good or service. Rent control is an example. If the ceil￾ing is below the equilibrium price, then it is binding, 
and the quantity demanded exceeds the quantity sup￾plied. Because of the resulting shortage, sellers must 
somehow ration the good or service among buyers. 
* A price floor is a legal minimum on the price of a good 
or service. The minimum wage is an example, If the 
floor is above the equilibrium price, then it is bind￾ing, and the quantity supplied exceeds the quantity 
demanded. Because of the resulling surplus, buyers’ 
demands for the good or service must somehow be 
rationed among sellers. 
¢ When the government levies a tax on a good, the equi￾librium quantity of the good falls. That is, a tax on a 
market shrinks the market's size. 
* A taxona good places a wedge between the price paid 
by buyers and the price received by sellers. When the 
market moves to the new equilibrium, buyers pay 
more for the good, and sellers receive less for it. In 
this sense, buyers and sellers share the tax burden. 
The incidence of a tax (that is, the division of the tax 
burden) does not depend on whether the tax is levied 
on buyers or sellers. 
* The incidence of a tax depends on the price elasticities 
of supply and demand. Most of the burden falls on the 
side of the market that is less elastic because it cannot 
respond as easily to the tax by changing the quantity 
bought or sold.

. Jhen consumers go to their local farmers’ market, they 
; "\ J may be delighted to find juicy, red tomatoes but appalled 
W by their high price. At the same time, when farmers bring 
to market the tomatoes they have raised, they probably wish the 
price were even higher. These views are not surprising: Other 
things being equal, buyers usually want to pay less, and sellers 
usually want to be paid more. But is there a “right price” for toma￾toes from the standpoint of society as a whole? 
Previous chapters showed how, in competitive markets, the 
torces of supply and demand determine the prices of goods and 
services and the quantities sold. So far, however, we have described 
how markets allocate scarce resources without considering whether 
these market allocations are desirable. We know that the price of 
tomatoes adjusts to ensure that the quantity of tomatoes supplied 
equals the quantity of tomatoes demanded. But at this equilibrium, 
is the quantity of tomatoes produced and consumed too small, too 
large, or just right?

welfare economics This chapter takes up the topic of welfare economics, the study of how the 
the study of how the allocation of resources affects economic well-being. We begin by examining the ben￾allocation of resources efits that buyers and sellers receive from engaging in market transactions. We then 
affects economic examine how society can make these benefits as large as possible. This analysis leads 
well-being to a profound conclusion: The equilibrium of supply and demand in competitive 
markets maximizes the total benefits received by all buyers and sellers combined. 
As you may recall from Chapter 1, one of the Ten Principles of Economics is 
that markets are usually a good way to organize economic activity. The study of 
welfare economics explains this principle more fully. It also answers our question 
about the right price of tomatoes: The price that balances the supply and demand 
for tomatoes is, in a particular sense, the best one because it maximizes the total 
welfare of consumers and producers. No consumer or producer of tomatoes needs 
to aim for this goal, but their joint action, directed by market prices, moves them 
toward a welfare-maximizing outcome, as if led by an invisible hand. 
7-1 Consumer Surplus 
We begin our study of welfare economics by looking at the benefits buyers receive 
from participating in a market. 
7-1a Willingness to Pay 
Imagine that you inherit from your great aunt a rare, mint-condition recording of 
Elvis Presley’s first album. Because you don't care for Elvis’s music, you decide to 
sell the album by auctioning it off. 
Four Elvis fans come to your auction: Whitney, Ella, Mariah, and Karen. They all 
want the album, but they have set limits on the amount they will pay for it. Table 1 
shows the maximum price that each of the four possible buyers would pay. A 
willingness to pay buyer’s maximum is called her willingness to pay, and it measures how much she 
the maximum amount values the good. Each buyer would be eager to buy the album at a price less than her 
that a buyer will pay for willingness to pay, and each would refuse to buy the album at a price greater than 
a good her willingness to pay. At a price equal to her willingness to pay, the buyer would 
be indifferent about buying the good: If the price is exactly the same as the value she 
places on the album, she would be equally happy buying it or keeping her money. 
To sell your album, you begin the bidding process at a low price, say, $100. Because 
all four buyers are willing to pay much more, the price quickly rises. The bidding 
stops when Whitney bids $800 (or slightly more). At this point, Ella, Mariah, and 
Karen have dropped out of the bidding because they are unwilling to offer more 
than $800. Whitney pays $800 and gets the album. Note that the album goes to the 
buyer who values it most.

What benefit does Whitney derive from buying the Elvis Presley album? In a 
sense, she has found a bargain: She is willing to pay $1,000 for the album but hands 
over only $800. Economists say that Whitney receives consumer surplus of $200. 
Consumer surplus is the amount a buyer is willing to pay for a good minus the 
amount the buyer actually pays for it. 
Consumer surplus measures the benefit buyers receive from participating in a 
market. In this example, Whitney gets a $200 benefit because she pays only $800 for 
something she values at $1,000. Ella, Mariah, and Karen get no consumer surplus 
because they leave the auction without the album and without paying anything,. 
Now consider a somewhat different example. Suppose that you have two iden￾tical Elvis Presley albums to sell. Again, you auction them off to the four possible 
buyers. To keep things simple, assume that both copies are to be sold for the same 
price and that no one wants more than one album. Therefore, the price rises until 
two buyers are left. 
In this case, the bidding stops when Whitney and Ella each bid $700 (or slightly 
higher). At this price, Whitney and Ella are happy to buy an album, and Mariah and 
Karen are not willing to bid any higher. Whitney and Ella each receive consumer 
surplus equal to her willingness to pay minus the price. Whitney's consumer surplus 
is $300, and Ella’s is $100. Whitney's consumer surplus is higher than in the previous 
example because she pays less for the same album. The total consumer surplus in 
the market is $400. 
7-1b Using the Demand Curve to Measure Consumer Surplus 
Consumer surplus is closely related to the demand curve for a product. To see how, 
consider the demand curve for this rare Elvis Presley album. 
Begin by using the willingness to pay of the four possible buyers to find the 
album’s market demand schedule. The table in Figure 1 shows the demand sched￾ule that corresponds to the valuations in Table 1. If the price is above $1,000, the 
consumer surplus 
the amount a buyer is 
willing to pay for a good 
minus the amount the 
buyer actually pays for it

quantity demanded is 0 because no buyer is willing to pay that much. If the price 
is between $800 and $1,000, the quantity demanded is 1: Only Whitney is willing to 
pay such a high price. If the price is between $700 and 5800, the quantity demanded 
is 2 because both Whitney and Ella are willing to pay the price. You can continue 
this analysis for other prices as well. In this way, the demand schedule is derived 
from the willingness to pay of the four possible buyers. 
The graph in Figure 1 shows the demand curve that corresponds to this demand 
schedule. Note the relationship between the height of the curve and the buyers’ 
willingness to pay. At any quantity, the price given by the demand curve shows the 
willingness to pay of the marginal buyer, the buyer who would leave the market 
first if the price were any higher. At a quantity of 4 albums, for instance, the demand 
curve has a height of $500, the price that Karen (the marginal buyer) is willing to 
pay. At a quantity of 3 albums, the demand curve has a height of $700, the price 
that Mariah (now the marginal buyer) is willing to pay. 
Because the demand curve reflects buyers” willingness to pay, it can also be used 
to measure consumer surplus. Figure 2 does this for our two examples. In panel (a), 
the price is $800 (or slightly above), and the quantity demanded is 1. Note that the 
area above the price and below the demand curve equals $200. This amount is the 
consumer surplus calculated earlier when only 1 album is sold. 
Panel (b) of Figure 2 shows consumer surplus when the price is $700 (or slightly 
above). In this case, the area above the price and below the demand curve equals 
the total area of the two rectangles: Whitney’s consumer surplus at this price is 
$300, and Ella’s is $100. This area equals a total of $400. Once again, this amount is 
the consumer surplus calculated earlier. 
In panel (a), the price of the good is $800, and consumer surplus is $200. In panel (b),

The lesson from this example holds for all demand curves: The area below the 
demand curve and above the price measures the consumer surplus in a market. 
This is true because the height of the demand curve represents the value buyers place 
on the good, measured by their willingness to pay for it. The difference between this 
willingness to pay and the market price is each buyer’s consumer surplus. The area 
between the demand curve and the price line is the sum of the consumer surplus 
of all buyers in the market for a good or service. 
7-1¢c How a Lower Price Raises Consumer Surplus 
Because buyers want to pay less for the goods they buy, a lower price makes buyers 
of a good better off. But how much does buyers’ well-being increase in response to 
a lower price? The concept of consumer surplus offers a precise answer. 
Figure 3 shows a typical demand curve. You may notice that it gradually slopes 
downward instead of taking discrete steps as in the previous two figures. In a 
market with many buyers, the resulting steps from each buyer dropping out are so 
small that they form a smooth demand curve. Although this curve has a different 
shape, the ideas we have just developed still apply: Consumer surplus is the area 
above the price line and below the demand curve. In panel (a), the price is P, and 
consumer surplus is the area of triangle ABC. 
Now suppose that the price falls from P, to P,, as shown in panel (b). Consumer 
surplus equals area ADF. The increase in consumer surplus from the price cut is 
the area BCFD. 
Figura 3 In panel (a), the price is P, the quantity demanded is @, and consumer surplus equals the 
- area of the triangle ABC. When the price falls from P, to P,, as in panel (b), the quantity 
How Price Affects Consumer demanded rises from @, to @,, and consumer surplus rises to the area of the triangle ADF. 
Surplus The increase in consumer surplus (area BCFD) occurs in part because existing consumers 
pay less (area BCED) and in part because new consumers enter the market at the lower 
price (area CEF).

This increase in consumer surplus has two parts. First, buyers who were already 
purchasing Q). of the good at the higher price P, are better off because now they 
pay less. The increase in consumer surplus of existing buyers is the reduction in 
the amount they pay. It equals the area of the rectangle BCED. Second, some new 
buyers enter the market because they are willing to buy the good at the lower price, 
which increases the quantity demanded from @, to Q,. The consumer surplus for 
the newcomers is the area of the triangle CEF., 
7-1d What Does Consumer Surplus Measure? 
The concept of consumer surplus can be helpful in making judgments about the 
desirability of market outcomes. Having seen what consumer surplus is, let’s con￾sider whether it is a good measure of economic well-being. 
Imagine that you are a policymaker designing an economic system. Would you 
care about consumer surplus? Because it is the amount that buyers are willing to pay 
for a good minus the amount they actually pay for it, consumer surplus measures 
the benefit that buyers derive from a market as the buyers themselves perceive it. 
Consumer surplus is a good measure of economic well-being if policymakers want 
to satisfy buyers’ preferences. 
In some circumstances, policymakers might choose to disregard consumer 
surplus because they do not respect the preferences that drive buyer behavior. 
For example, addicts are willing to pay a high price for their drug of choice. 
Yet policymakers would be unlikely to say that addicts get a large benefit from 
being able to buy drugs at a low price (even though addicts might say they do). 
From the standpoint of society, willingness to pay in this instance is not a good 
measure of the buyers’ benefit, and consumer surplus is not a good measure 
of economic well-being, because addicts are not looking after their own best 
interests. 
In most markets, however, consumer surplus reflects economic well-being,. 
Economists generally assume that buyers are rational when they make decisions. 
Rational people do the best they can to achieve their objectives, given their oppor￾tunities. Economists also normally assume that people’s preferences should be 
respected. In this case, consumers are the best judges of how much benefit they get 
from the goods they buy.

7-2 Producer Surplus 
Let's now turn to the other side of the market and consider the benefits sellers 
receive from participating in a market. The analysis of sellers’ welfare is parallel to 
the analysis of buyers” welfare. 
7-2a Cost and the Willingness to Sell 
Imagine that you are a homeowner and want to get your house painted. You turn 
to four sellers of painting services: Vincent, Claude, Pablo, and Andy. Each painter 
is willing to do the work for you if the price is right. You set up an auction and take 
bids from the four painters. 
Each painter is willing to take the job if the price exceeds his cost of doing the 
work. Here the term cost should be interpreted as the painter’s opportunity cost: 
It includes his out-of-pocket expenses (for paint, brushes, and so on) and, most 
importantly, the value that he places on his time. Table 2 shows each painter’s 
cost. Because a painter’s cost is the lowest price he would accept for his work, it 
measures his willingness to sell his services. Each painter would be eager to sell 
his services at a price greater than his cost and would refuse to sell his services at a 
price less than his cost. At a price exactly equal to his cost, he would be indifferent 
about selling his services: He would be equally satisfied getting the job or using 
his time and energy elsewhere. 
When you take bids, the price might start high, but it quickly falls as the paint￾ers compete for the job. Once Andy has bid $2,400 (or slightly less), he is the sole 
remaining bidder. Andy wants to do the job for this price because his cost is only 
$2,000. Vincent, Claude, and Pablo are unwilling to do it for less than $2,400. 
Note that the job goes to the painter who can do the work at the lowest cost. 
What benefit does Andy derive from getting the job? Because he is willing to do 
the work for $2,000 but is paid $2,400, economists say that he receives producer 
surplus of $400. Producer surplus is the amount a seller is paid minus his cost of 
production. It measures how much a seller benefits from participating in a market. 
Now consider a different example. Suppose two houses need painting. Again, 
you auction off the jobs to the four painters. To keep things simple, assume that no 
cost 
the value of everything 
a seller must give up to 
produce a good 
producer surplus 
the amount a seller is 
paid for a good minus 
the seller's cost of 
painter can paint both houses and that you will pay the same amount to painteach ~ providing it 
house. Therefore, the price falls until two painters are left. 
In this case, the auction stops when Andy and Pablo each bid $3,200 (or slightly 
less). They are willing to do the work at this price, while Vincent and Claude won't 
go lower. At $3,200, Andy’s producer surplus is $1,200, and Pablo’s is $800. The 
total producer surplus in the market is $2,000.

7-2b Using the Supply Curve to Measure Producer Surplus 
Just as consumer surplus is closely related to the demand curve, producer surplus 
is closely related to the supply curve. To see how, let’s derive the supply curve for 
painting services. 
Begin by using the costs of the four painters to find the supply schedule. The table 
in Figure 4 shows the schedule that corresponds to the costs in Table 2. If the price 
is below $2,000, no painter will do the job, so the quantity supplied is zero. If the 
price is between 52,000 and $2,400, only Andy will do it, so the quantity supplied 
is 1. If the price is between $2,400 and $3,200, Andy and Pablo will do the work, so 
the quantity supplied is 2, and so on. Thus, the supply schedule is derived from 
the costs of the four painters. 
The graph in Figure 4 shows the supply curve that corresponds to this supply 
schedule. Note that the height of the supply curve is related to the sellers’ costs. At 
any quantity, the price given by the supply curve shows the cost of the marginal 
seller, the seller who would leave the market first if the price were lower. At a quan￾tity of 4 houses, for instance, the supply curve has a height of $3,600, the cost that 
Vincent (the marginal seller) incurs to provide his painting services. At a quantity 
of 3 houses, the supply curve has a height of $3,200, the cost that Claude (who is 
now the marginal seller) incurs. 
Because the supply curve reflects sellers’ costs, it can be used to measure pro￾ducer surplus. Figure 5 uses the supply curve to compute producer surplus in the 
two examples. In panel (a), the price is $2,400 (or slightly less), and the quantity 
supplied is 1. The area below the price and above the supply curve equals $400. 
This is the producer surplus calculated earlier for Andy. 
Panel (b) of Figure 5 shows producer surplus when the price is $3,200 (or slightly 
less). In this case, the area below the price and above the supply curve equals the 
total area of the two rectangles. This area equals 52,000, the producer surplus com￾puted earlier for Pablo and Andy when two houses needed painting,. 
Figure 4 The table shows the supply schedule for the sellers {listed in Table 2} of painting services. The graph 
shows the corresponding supply curve. The height of the supply curve reflects the sellers' costs.

The lesson from this example applies to all supply curves: The area below the 
price and above the supply curve measures the producer surplus in a market. The 
logic is straightforward: The height of the supply curve measures sellers’ costs, and 
the difference between the price and the cost of production is each seller’s producer 
surplus. Thus, the area between the price line and the supply curve is the sum of 
all sellers” producer surplus. 
7-2¢ How a Higher Price Raises Producer Surplus 
You will not be surprised to hear that sellers generally prefer a higher price for the 
goods they sell. But how much does sellers” well-being increase in response to a 
higher price? The concept of producer surplus offers an answer. 
Figure 6 shows a typical upward-sloping supply curve that would arise in a 
market with many sellers. Although this supply curve differs in shape from the 
previous one, producer surplus is measured in the same way: Producer surplus is 
the area below the price and above the supply curve. In panel (a), the price is P, 
and producer surplus is the area of triangle ABC. 
Panel (b) shows what happens when the price rises from P, to P,. Producer sur￾plus now equals area ADF. This increase in producer surplus has two parts. First, 
those sellers who were already selling Q, of the good at the lower price of P, get 
more for what they sell. The increase in producer surplus for these existing sellers 
equals the area of the rectangle BCED. Second, new sellers enter the market at the 
higher price, so the quantity supplied increases from (, to (.. The producer surplus 
of these newcomers is the area of the triangle CEFE

7-3 Market Efficiency 
Consumer surplus and producer surplus are the basic tools that economists use to 
study the welfare of buyers and sellers in a market. These tools can help address 
a fundamental question: Do competitive markets reach a desirable allocation of 
resources? 
7-3a Benevolent Social Planners 
To evaluate market outcomes, we introduce a new, hypothetical group: the com￾mittee of the benevolent social planners. The benevolent social planners are all￾powerful, all-knowing, and well-intentioned. They want to maximize the economic 
well-being of everyone in society. What should they do? Just let buyers and sell￾ers find an equilibrium on their own? Or can the planners enhance well-being by 
somehow altering the market outcome? 
To answer this question, the planners must first decide how to gauge the well￾being of society. One input into measuring societal well-being is the sum of consumer 
surplus and producer surplus, which we call total surplus. Consumer surplus is 
the benefit that buyers receive from participating in a market, and producer surplus 
is the benefit that sellers receive. Total surplus is, therefore, a natural variable for 
the social planners to consider when judging a market’s allocation of resources. 
To better understand this measure, recall the definitions of consumer and pro￾ducer surplus. Consumer surplus is: 
Consumer surplus = Value to buyers — Amount paid by buyers. 
Similarly, producer surplus is: 
Producer surplus = Amount received by sellers — Cost to sellers. 
Adding consumer and producer surplus together, we obtain: 
Total surplus = (Value to buyers — Amount paid by buyers) 
+ (Amount received by sellers — Cost to sellers). 
Here, the amount paid by buyers equals the amount received by sellers, so the 
middle two terms cancel each other. As a result: 
Total surplus = Value to buyers — Cost to sellers. 
The total surplus in a market is the total value to buyers of the goods, measured 
by their willingness to pay, minus the total cost to sellers of providing those goods. 
If an allocation of resources maximizes total surplus, economists say that the 
allocation exhibits efficiency. If an allocation is not efficient, some of the potential 
gains from trade among buyers and sellers are not being realized. For example, 
an allocation is inefficient if a gflnd is not being produced by the sellers with 
the lowest costs. In this case, moving production from a high-cost producer to a 
lower-cost producer would reduce the total cost to sellers and raise total surplus. 
Similarly, an allocation is inefficient if a good is not being consumed by the buy￾ers who are willing to pay the most for it. In this case, moving consumption of 
the good from a buyer with a low valuation to a buyer with a higher valuation 
would raise total surplus.

Figure 7 
In addition to efficiency, the social planners might also care about equality—that 
is, whether the various buyers and sellers in the market have similar levels of eco￾nomic well-being. In essence, the gains from trade in a market are like a pie to be 
shared among the market participants. The question of efficiency concerns whether 
the pie is as big as possible. The question of equality concerns how the pie is sliced 
and distributed among members of society. This chapter focuses on efficiency as 
the social planners’ criterion. Keep in mind, however, that real policymakers often 
care about equality as well. 
7-3b Evaluating the Market Equilibrium 
Figure 7 shows the welfare measures when a market reaches the equilibrium of 
supply and demand. Recall that consumer surplus equals the area above the price 
and under the demand curve, and producer surplus equals the area below the price 
and above the supply curve. The area between the supply and demand curves up 
to the point of equilibrium represents the total surplus in this market. 
Is this equilibrium allocation of resources efficient? That is, does it maximize total 
surplus? Recall that when a market is in equilibrium, the price determines which 
of the possible buyers and sellers participate in the market. Buyers who value the 
good more than the price (represented by the segment AE on the demand curve) 
choose to buy it; buyers who value it less than the price (represented by the segment 
EB) do not. Similarly, sellers whose costs are less than the price (represented by the 
segment CE on the supply curve) choose to produce and sell the good; sellers whose 
costs are greater than the price (represented by the segment ED) do not. 
These observations lead to two insights about market outcomes: 
1. Competitive markets allocate the supply of goods to the buyers who value 
them most, as measured by their willingness to pay. 
2. Competitive markets allocate the demand for goods to the sellers who can 
produce them at the lowest cost. 
Consumer and Producer Surplus in the 
Market Equilibrium 
Total surplus—the sum of consumer and 
producer surplus—is the area between 
the supply and demand curves up to the 
equilibrium quantity.

Thus, given the quantity produced and sold in a market equilibrium, the social 
planners cannot increase economic well-being by changing the allocation of con￾sumption among buyers or the allocation of production among sellers. 
But can the social planners raise well-being by increasing or decreasing the 
quantity of the good? The answer is no, as stated in this third insight about market 
outcomes: 
3. Competitive markets produce the quantity of goods that maximizes the sum 
of consumer and producer surplus. 
Figure 8 shows why this is true. To interpret this figure, recall that the demand 
curve reflects the value to buyers and the supply curve reflects the cost to sellers. 
At any quantity below the equilibrium level, such as Q, the value to the marginal 
buyer exceeds the cost to the marginal seller. As a result, increasing the quantity 
produced and consumed raises total surplus. This continues to be true until the 
quantity reaches the equilibrium level. Conversely, at any quantity beyond the 
equilibrium level, such as (J,, the value to the marginal buyer is less than the cost 
to the marginal seller. In this case, decreasing the quantity raises total surplus, and 
this continues to be true until the quantity falls to the equilibrium level. To maximize 
total surplus, the social planners would choose the quantity at which the supply 
and demand curves intersect. 
Together, these three insights tell us that the market outcome maximizes the 
sum of consumer and producer surplus. In other words, the equilibrium outcome 
is an efficient allocation of resources. Social planners concerned about efficiency 
can, therefore, leave the market outcome just as they find it. This policy of leaving 
well enough alone goes by the French expression laissez-faire, which literally 
translates to “leave to do” but is more broadly interpreted as “let people do as 
they will.”

Society is lucky that the social planners don’t need to intervene. Imagining what 
all-powerful, all-knowing, and well-intentioned planners would do has been a use￾ful exercise, but let’s face it: Such characters are hard to come by. Some dictators 
may be close to all powerful, but they are rarely benevolent. Even if we found some 
people so virtuous, they would lack crucial information. 
Suppose the social planners tried to choose an efficient allocation of resources on 
their own instead of relying on market forces. To do so, they would need to know 
the value of a particular good to every potential consumer and the cost for every 
potential producer. And they would need this information not only for this market 
but for every one of the many thousands of markets in the economy. This task is 
practically impossible, which explains why economies with substantial central 
planning are rife with inefficiencies. 
The planners’ job becomes easy, however, once they take on a partner: Adam 
Smith'’s invisible hand of the marketplace. The invisible hand takes all the informa￾tion about buyers and sellers into account and guides everyone in the market to the 
best outcome as judged by the standard of economic efficiency. It is a remarkable 
feat. That is why economists so often advocate unfettered, competitive markets as 
the best way to organize economic activity. 
Should There Be a Market for Organs? 
Some years ago, The Boston Globe ran an article “How a Mother’s 
Love Helped Save Two Lives.” It told the story of Susan Stephens, 
a woman whose son needed a kidney transplant. When the doctor 
learned that the mother’s kidney was not compatible, he proposed a novel solu￾tion: If Stephens donated one of her kidneys to a stranger, her son would move 
to the top of the kidney waiting list. The mother accepted the deal, and soon two 
patients had the transplants they were waiting for. 
The ingenuity of the doctor’s proposal and the nobility of the mother’s act 
cannot be doubted. But the story raises intriguing questions. If the mother could 
trade a kidney for a kidney, would the hospital allow her to trade a kidney for 
an expensive, experimental cancer treatment that she could not otherwise afford? 
Should she be allowed to exchange her kidney for free tuition 
for her son at the hospital’s medical school? Should she be able

As a matter of public policy, it is illegal for people to sell 
their organs. Many people view the very notion of buying

this prohibition because no cash changed hands. In a legal 
sense, it was not a market transaction. 
Yet many economists say that repealing this prohibition and 
allowing an open market for organs would yield large benefits.

them without any working kidney. Despite the obvious gains from trade, the 
current situation is dire: The typical patient has to wait several years for a kidney 
transplant, and every year thousands of people die because a compatible kidney 
cannot be found. Proponents of a market solution say that if those needing a 
kidney could buy one from those who have two, the price would rise to balance 
supply and demand. Sellers would be better off with the extra cash in their pock￾ets. Buyers would be better off with the organ they need to save their lives. The 
shortage of kidneys would disappear. 
Such a market would lead to an efficient allocation of resources, but this plan 
nonetheless has its critics. In addition to the issue of repugnance, some worry about 
fairness. A market for organs, they argue, would benefit the rich at the expense of 
the poor because organs would be allocated to those most willing and able to pay. 
But you can also question the fairness of the current system. Now, most of us walk 
around with an extra organ that we don't really need, while some of our fellow 
citizens are dying to get one. Is that fair? @

7-4 Conclusion: Market Efficiency 
and Market Failure 
Answers are at the end of the chapter. 
This chapter introduced the basic tools of welfare economics—consumer and pro￾ducer surplus—and used them to evaluate the efficiency of market outcomes. We 
showed that the forces of supply and demand allocate resources efficiently. Even 
though buyers and sellers in a market are each concerned only about their own 
welfare, they are guided by an invisible hand to an equilibrium that maximizes the 
total benefits to buyers and sellers.

to make markets more efficient? 
Scalping Isn't Scamming 
By Tracy C. Miller 
he cost of tickets to the Broadway musical 
“Hamilton” skyrocketed at one point aver the 
summer as scalpers charged $1,000 or more for 
tickets to the show, when the average ticket's 
face value was $189. In response, Sen. Chuck 
Schumer (D-NY) is proposing federal legisla￾tion that would prohibit the use of software 
to facilitate ticket scalping. Do we really need 
legislation to curb this practice? 
Scalpers are using bots to buy up a large 
share of tickets online before the public gets 
a chance to purchase them. Then they resell 
those tickets for much higher prices. This is 
a modern twist on a practice that has long 
been demanized by the public and legis|ators. 
Scalping certainly results in some 
consumers paying higher prices than they 
otherwise would. But in exchange for high 
prices, consumers can get the tickets they 
want, when they want them, without waiting 
in line or competing to be among the first to 
buy them online at a given time. Opponents 
mistakenly conclude that high prices are the 
fault of scalpers, when in fact prices are high 
because of a large demand and a limited 
supply. 
At present, no federal laws limit scalping, 
but 15 states have laws that prohibit scalp￾ing in at least some circumstances. Another 
seven states require a seller to have a license 
to broker a ticket, and some limit how much 
ticket brokers can mark up the price of tick￾ets. Some states don't allow scalping within a 
specified distance of the venue where an event 
is held. Others allow reselling tickets purchased 
for personal use, while prohibiting anyone naot 
registered as a broker from buying and selling 
tickets for a profit. 
Scalping benefits the scalper and the buyer, 
by getting tickets to whomever values them 
most highly. If someone decides at the last 
minute to attend a play, a concert or a game, 
they can find tickets at some price. Without 
scalpers, some people who value the event 
highly would be unable to buy tickets for seats 
of the quality they desire. 
Scalping can also benefit ticket produc￾ers—the sports teams or performing artists 
who supply tickets—in two ways. First, it 
enables them to earn ticket revenue through 
face-value prices long before an event, while 
scalpers bear the risk that demand and prices 
might fall below the price they paid. Second, 
because of scalpers, the initial demand for 
tickets may be higher than it would otherwise 
be, enabling ticket producers to charge more. 
Ticket producers incur expenses long before 
an event, such as the cost of renting an arena. 
They can keep their selling costs down by sell￾ing all or most tickets quickly rather than over 
an extended period of time. By buying tickets 
A few words of warning are in order. To conclude that markets are efficient, we 
made several assumptions about how markets work. When these assumptions 
do not hold, the conclusion that the market equilibrium is efficient may no longer 
be true. As we close this chapter, let’s briefly consider two of the most important 
assumptions we made. 
First, our analysis assumed that markets are perfectly competitive. In actual 
economies, however, competition is sometimes far from perfect. In some markets, 
a single buyer or seller (or a small group of them) may be able to control market 
prices. This ability to influence prices is called market power. Market power can 
make markets inefficient by keeping the price and quantity away from the levels 
that equilibrate supply and demand. 
Second, our analysis assumed that the market outcome matters only to the buyers 
and sellers who participate in the market. Yet sometimes, the decisions of buyers 
and sellers affect bystanders. Pollution is the classic example. The use of agricultural 
pesticides, for instance, affects not only the manufacturers who make them and the 
farmers who use them but also many others who breathe the air or drink the water 
contaminated by these pesticides. When a market exhibits such side effects, called 
externalities, the welfare implications of market activity depend on more than

when they first become available and holding 
an inventory to sell at times that are most con￾venient to consumers, scalpers connect buyers 
with sellers and benefit both. They act as bro￾kers, and the difference between the price they 
pay and the price they receive is their reward 
for doing this. The more scalpers compete to 
buy and resell tickets, the lower the markup 
thal each will earn. 
If scalpers are few in number and skilled at 
assessing each consumer's demand for tickets, 
they can charge each consumer a price close 
to the maximum he or she is willing to pay. 
The higher the average price they can charge 
per ticket, the more they can pay to the team 
of performing artists who produce the tickets. 
Scalping does alienate some consumers 
who pay higher prices to buy from scalpers 
who got to the ticket site before they did. As 
a result, these consumers may be less willing 
to attend future events. If performing artists 
or sports teams want to avoid alienating their 
loyal customers, they can choose their method 
of distributing tickets to accomplish that goal, 
such as by setting aside a percentage of tickets 
Source: U5 Mews and Warld Report, Octaber 4, 2016, 
to sell at what they consider a reasonable price 
to those customers. In many cases, though, 
ticket producers may prefer to lock-in a high 
price and sell all their tickets quickly, which 
Lin-Manuel Miranda as Hamilton 
THED WARGOVWREIM AGEGETTY IMAGES 
may mean selling a large percentage of their 
tickets to scalpers. 
Laws to prevent scalping are unnecessary 
and prevent mutually beneficial transactions. 
Scalping only occurs when original ticket sell￾ers charge a price that’s lower than some 
consumers are willing to pay. If scalpers use 
software that's efficient at buying and selling 
tickets, it will save time and effort and each 
party involved in the process benefits. [n one 
way or another, the ticket producer, the scalper 
and the people who attend the event will each 
be better off. W 
Questions to Discuss 
1. Why do you think the producers of 
Hamiltern charge much less for tickets 
than the ticket resellers charge? 
2. Do you think there should be laws 
against reselling tickets above their face 
value? Why or why not?

Center at George Mason University. 
just the value realized by buyers and the cost incurred by sellers. Because buyvers 
and sellers may ignore these externalities when deciding how much to consume 
and produce, the equilibrium in a market can be inefficient from the standpoint of 
society as a whole. 
Market power and externalities are examples of a general phenomenon called 
market failure—the inability of some unregulated markets to allocate resources 
efficiently. When markets fail, public policy can potentially remedy the problem 
and enhance economic efficiency. Microeconomists devote much effort to studying 
when market failures are likely and how they are best corrected. As you continue 
your study of economics, you will see that the tools of welfare economics developed 
here are readily adapted to that endeavor. 
Despite the possibility of market failure, the invisible hand of the marketplace is 
extraordinarily important. In many markets, the assumptions made in this chapter 
work well, and the conclusion of market efficiency applies directly. Moreover, we 
can use our analysis of welfare economics and market efficiency to shed light on 
the effects of various government policies. The next two chapters apply the tools we 
have just developed to two important policy issues—the welfare effects of taxation 
and of international trade.

the anger of the American colonists over British taxes 
sparked the American Revolution. More than two centuries 
later, Americans still debate the proper size and shape of the tax 
system. Yet few would deny that some taxation is necessary. As 
the jurist Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. once said, “Taxes are what 
we pay for civilized society.” 
Because taxation has a large impact on the modern economy, the 
topic appears repeatedly throughout this book as we expand the 
tools at our disposal. Chapter 6 used supply, demand, and elastic￾ity to show how a tax on a good affects its price and quantity and 
how the tax burden is split between buyers and sellers. This chapter 
extends the analysis to examine how taxes affect welfare, defined 
as the economic well-being of market participants. 
The effects of taxes on welfare might seem obvious. The govern￾ment enacts taxes to raise revenue, and that revenue must come 
from someone’s wallet. As Chapter 6 showed, both buyers and sell￾ers of a good are worse off when it is taxed: Buyers pay more, and 
sellers receive less. Yet to fully understand how taxes affect well￾being, we must compare the losses of buyers and sellers with the 
amount of revenue the government collects. The tools of consumer

taxes to buyers and sellers typically exceeds the revenue raised by the government. 
That is not to say that taxation is always undesirable. Tax revenue is needed to 
fund government programs, and these can be valuable. But judging alternative 
policies requires an understanding of how high the price of civilized society can be. 
8-1 The Deadweight Loss of Taxation 
Figure 1 
Let’s begin by recalling a lesson from Chapter 6: The ultimate impact of a tax on a 
market is the same whether the tax is levied on buyers or sellers. A tax on buyers 
shifts the demand curve downward by the size of the tax; a tax on sellers shifts the 
supply curve upward by that amount. In either case, the tax raises the price paid 
by buyers and reduces the price received by sellers. As a result, how the tax burden 
is distributed between producers and consumers depends not on how the tax is 
levied but on the elasticities of supply and demand. 
Figure 1 illustrates the effect of a tax. To keep things simple, this figure does 
not show a shift in the supply or demand curve, though one curve must shift, 
depending on whom the tax is levied. This chapter keeps the analysis general 
and the graphs less cluttered by not ‘:l'lDWll"!g the shift. The 1mpnrtant point is 
that the tax places a wedge between the price buyers pay and the price sellers 
receive. Because of this wedge, the quantity sold is less than it would be if there 
were no tax. In other words, a tax on a good shrinks the size of the market for 
it, as Chapter 6 showed. 
8-1a How a Tax Affects Market Participants 
Let’s now use the tools of welfare economics to measure the gains and losses from 
a tax on a good. To do this, we must consider how the tax affects buyers, sellers, 
and the government. The welfare of buyers is measured by consumer surplus—the 
amount buyers are willing to pay for the good minus the amount they actually pay

for it. The welfare of sellers is measured by producer surplus—the amount sellers 
receive for the good minus their costs of producing it. Chapter 7 introduced these 
measures of economic well-being. 
What about the third interested party, the government? If T is the size of the 
tax and Q is the quantity of the good sold, then the government takes in tax rev￾enue of T X Q. It can use this revenue to provide government services, such as 
roads, police, and public education, or to fund transfer programs for, say, lower￾income houscholds. When analyzing how taxes affect economic well-being, we 
use the government's tax revenue to measure the public benefit from the tax. 
This benefit, however, actually accrues not to the government but to those on 
whom the revenue is spent. 
In Figure 2, the government’s tax revenue is represented by the rectangle 
between the supply and demand curves. The height of this rectangle is the size 
of the tax, T, and its width is the quantity of the good sold, Q. Because a rect￾angle’s area is its height multiplied by its width, this rectangle’s areais T % Q, 
which equals the tax revenue. 
Welfare without a Tax To see how a tax affects welfare, let’s begin by consider￾ing the situation before a tax is imposed. Figure 3 shows the supply-and-demand 
diagram with the key areas marked by the letters A through F. 
Without a tax, the equlhbrmm price and quantity are found at the intersection of 
the supply and demand curves. The price is P, and the quantity sold is Q,. Because 
the demand curve reflects buyers’ w:l]mgnE'-is to pay, consumer surplus is the area 
between the demand curve and the price, A + B + C. Similarly, because the supply 
curve reflects sellers’ costs, producer surplus is the area between the supply curve 
and the price, D + E + F. Because there is no tax, tax revenue is zero. 
Total surplus, the sum of consumer and producer surplus, equals the area A + 
B + C+ D + E + F. In other words, as in Chapter 7, it is the area between the supply 
and demand curves up to the equilibrium quantity. The first column of the table in 
Figure 3 summarizes these results,

The tax revenue that the government 
collects equals T % @Q, the size of the tax,

How a Tax Affects Welfare 
A tax on a good reduces consumer surplus (by the area B + C) and producer surplus (by the 
area D + E). Because the fall in producer and consumer surplus exceeds the tax revenue 
{area B + D), the tax is said to impose a deadweight loss (area C + E).

Welfare with a Tax Now consider welfare with a tax. The price paid by buyers 
rises from P, to P, so consumer surplus equals only area A (the area below the 
demand curve and above the buyers’ price, P,). The price received by sellers falls 
from P, to P, so producer surplus equals only area F (the area above the supply 
curve and below the sellers’ price P,). The quantity sold falls from Q, to Q,, and the 
government collects tax revenue equal to the area B + D. 
To find total surplus with the tax, add consumer surplus, producer surplus, and 
tax revenue. Thus, total surplus is area A + B + D + F. The table’s second column 
summarizes these results. 
Changes in Welfare We can now see the effects of the tax by comparing welfare 
before and after the tax is enacted. The table’s third column shows the changes. 
Consumer surplus falls by the area B + C, and producer surplus falls by the area 
D + E. Tax revenue rises by the area B + D. Not surprisingly, with the tax, the buy￾ers and sellers are worse off, and the government has more revenue. 
The change in total welfare includes the change in consumer surplus (which is 
negative), the change in producer surplus (which is also negative), and the change

in tax revenue (which is positive). When we add these three pieces together, we find 
that total surplus in the market falls by the area C + E. The losses to buyers and 
sellers from a tax exceed the revenue raised by the government. The fall in total 
surplus that results when a tax (or some other policy) distorts the outcome in an 
otherwise efficient market is called a deadweight loss. The area C + E measures 
the size of the loss. 
To understand why taxes cause deadweight losses, recall one of the Ten 
Principles of Economics from Chapter 1: People respond to incentives. Chapter 
7 showed that competitive markets typically allocate scarce resources efficiently. 
That is, in the absence of a tax, the equilibrium of supply and demand maximizes 
the total surplus of buyers and sellers in a market. When the government imposes 
a tax, it raises the price buyers pay and lowers the price sellers receive, giving 
incentives to buyers to consume less and sellers to produce less. As a result, the 
market shrinks below its optimum (as shown in the figure by the movement from 
Q, to Q,). Thus, because taxes distort incentives, they cause markets to allocate 
resources inefficiently. 
8-1b Deadweight Losses and the Gains from Trade 
To better understand why taxes cause deadweight losses, consider an example. 
Imagine that Malik cleans Mei’s house each week for $100. The opportunity cost 
of Malik’s time is 580, and the value of a clean house to Mei is $120, so they each 
receive a $20 benefit from their deal. The total surplus of $40 measures the gains 
from trade in this transaction. 
Now suppose that the government levies a 550 tax on providers of cleaning 
services. There is now no price that Mei can pay Malik that will leave both better 
off. The most Mei would be willing to pay is $120, but then Malik would be left 
with only $70 after paying the tax, which is less than his $80 opportunity cost. 
Conversely, for Malik to cover his opportunity cost of $80, Mei would need to 
pay $130, which is above the $120 value she places on the cleaning service. As 
a result, Mei and Malik cancel their arrangement. Malik loses the income, and 
Mei cleans her own house. 
The tax has made Malik and Mei worse off by a total of 540 because they have 
each lost $20 of surplus. But the government collects no revenue from Malik and 
Mei because they have canceled their arrangement. The $40 is pure deadweight 
loss: It is a loss to buyers and sellers in a market that is not offset by an increase 
in government revenue. This example shows the ultimate source of deadweight 
losses: Taxes cause deadweight losses because they prevent buyers and sellers 
from realizing some of the gains from trade. 
The area of the triangle between the supply and demand curves created by 
the tax wedge (area C + E in Figure 3) measures these losses. This conclusion 
can be seen more easily in Figure 4 by recalling that the demand curve reflects 
the value of the good to consumers and that the supply curve reflects the costs 
of producers. When the tax raises the price buyers pay to P, and lowers the price 
sellers receive to P,, the marginal buyers and sellers leave the market, so the 
quantity sold falls from Q, to Q,. Yet as the figure shows, the value of the good 
to these buyers still exceeds the cost to these sellers. At every quantity between 
Q, and Q,, the situation is the same as in our example with Malik and Mei. The 
gains from trade—the difference between buyers’ value and sellers’ cost—are 
less than the tax. As a result, these trades are not made once the tax is imposed. 
The deadweight loss is the surplus that is lost because the tax discourages these 
mutually advantageous trades.

8-2 The Determinants of the Deadweight Loss 
What determines whether the deadweight loss from a tax is large or small? The 
answer is to be found in the price elasticities of supply and demand, which measure 
how much the quantity supplied and quantity demanded respond to changes in 
the price.

Consider first how the elasticity of supply affects the size of the deadweight 
loss. In the top two panels of Figure 5, the demand curve and the size of the tax are 
the same. The only difference is the elasticity of the supply curve. In panel (a), the 
supply curve is relatively inelastic: The quantity supplied responds only slightly to 
changes in the price. In panel (b), the supply curve is relatively elastic: The quantity 
supplied responds substantially to changes in the price. Notice that the deadweight 
loss, the area of the triangle between the supply and demand curves, is larger when 
the supply curve is more elastic. 
Figure 5 In panels (a) and (b}, the demand curve and the size of the tax are the same, but the 
——— price elasticity of supply is different. Notice that the more elastic the supply curve, the 
Tax Iltstnl_'th!ls larger the deadweight loss of the tax. In panels (c) and (d), the supply curve and the size 
and Elasticities of the tax are the same, but the price elasticity of demand is different. The more elastic 
the demand curve, the larger the deadweight loss of the tax.

Similarly, the bottom two panels of Figure 5 show how the elasticity of demand 
affects the size of the deadweight loss. Here, the supply curve and the size of the 
tax are held constant. In panel (c), the demand curve is relatively inelastic, and 
the deadweight loss is small. In panel (d), the demand curve is more elastic, and 
the deadweight loss from the tax is larger. 
The lesson from this figure is apparent. A tax has a deadweight loss because it 
induces buyers and sellers to change their behavior. The tax raises the price paid by 
buyers, so they consume less. At the same time, the tax lowers the price received by 
sellers, so they produce less. Because of these changes in behavior, the equilibrium 
quantity in the market shrinks below the optimal quantity for economic efficiency. 
The more responsive buyers and sellers are to changes in the price, the more the 
equilibrium quantity shrinks. Hence, the greater the elasticities of supply and 
demand, the larger the deadweight loss of a tax. 
The Deadweight Loss Debate 
Supply, demand, elasticity, deadweight loss—all this economic 
theory is enough to make your head spin. But these ideas are part of 
a profound political question: How big should the government be? 
These concepts are important because the larger the deadweight loss of taxation, 
the larger the cost of government programs. If taxation entails large deadweight 
losses, then these losses are an argument for a leaner government that does less 
and taxes less. But if taxes impose small deadweight losses, then government 
programs are less costly than they otherwise might be, which in turn argues for 
a more expansive government. Of course, the phenomenon of deadweight loss is 
not the only reason to embrace large or small government: Another key part of 
the debate is the value of the government programs that would be funded with 
tax revenue. 
So how big are the deadweight losses of taxation? Economists disagree on 
the answer. To see the nature of this disagreement, consider the most impor￾tant tax in the U.S. economy: the tax on labor. The Social Security tax, the 
Medicare tax, and much of the federal income tax are labor taxes. Many state 
governments also tax labor earnings through state income taxes. A labor tax 
places a wedge between the wage that firms pay and the wage that workers 
receive. For a typical worker, if all forms of labor taxes are added together, the 
marginal tax rate on labor income—the tax on the last dollar of earnings—is 
about 40 percent. 
The size of the labor tax is easy to determine, but calculating the deadweight 
loss of this tax is less straightforward. Economists disagree about whether this 40 
percent labor tax has a small or a large deadweight loss. This disagreement arises 
because economists hold different views about the elasticity of labor supply. 
Economists who say labor taxes do not greatly distort market outcomes hold 
that labor supply is fairly inelastic. Most people, they claim, would work full-time 
regardless of the wage. If so, the labor supply curve is almost vertical, and a tax on 
labor has a small deadweight loss. Some evidence suggests that this may be the 
case for workers in their prime working years who are the main breadwinners for 
their families. 
Economists who say labor taxes are highly distortionary hold that labor sup￾ply is more elastic. While noting that some groups of workers may not change the 
quantity of labor they supply by very much in response to changes in labor taxes, 
these economists claim that other groups respond more to incentives. Here are 
some examples:

¢ Many people can choose when to retire, and 
their decisions are partly based on wages. 
Once they stop full-time work, wage levels 
determine their incentive to work part-time. 
* Some people evade taxes by working at jobs 
that pay “under the table” or by engaging in illegal economic activity, such as 
the sale of prohibited drugs. Economists call this the underground economy.

“What's your position on the elasticity of labor supply?” 
In each of these cases, the quantity of labor supplied depends on the after-tax 
wage, so taxes on labor earnings affect people’s decisions. These taxes encourage 
workers to work fewer hours, second earners to stay at home, the elderly to retire 
early, and the unscrupulous to enter the underground economy. 
The debate over the distortionary effects of labor taxation persists to this day. 
Indeed, whenever two political candidates disagree about whether the government 
should provide more services or reduce the tax burden, part of the disagreement 
may rest on different views about the elasticity of labor supply and the deadweight

8-3 Deadweight Loss and Tax Revenue as Taxes Vary 
Taxes rarely stay the same for long. Policymakers are always considering raising 
one tax or lowering another. Let’s consider what happens to the deadweight loss 
and tax revenue when the size of a tax changes. 
Figure 6 shows the effects of a small, medium, and large tax, holding constant 
the market’s supply and demand curves. The deadweight loss—the reduction 
Figurfl & The deadweight loss is the reduction in total surplus resulting from the tax. Tax revenue 
- is the size of the tax multiplied by the amount of the good sold. In panel (a), a small

Size of a Tax (c), a very large tax has a very large deadweight loss, but because it reduces the size of 
the market so much, the tax raises only a small amount of revenue. Panels (d) and (g) 
summarize these conclusions. Panel {(d) shows that as the size of a tax grows larger, the 
deadweight loss grows larger. Panel (e) shows that tax revenue first rises and then falls. 
This relationship is called the Laffer curve.

in total surplus that results when the tax reduces a market’s size below the 
optimum—equals the area of the triangle between the supply and demand curves. 
For the small tax in panel (a), the area of the deadweight loss triangle is quite 
small. But as the size of the tax rises in panels (b) and (c), the deadweight loss 
grows larger and larger. 
Indeed, the deadweight loss of a tax rises even more rapidly than the size of the 
tax. This occurs because the deadweight loss is the area of a triangle, and the area 
of a triangle depends on the square of its size. If we double the size of a tax, for 
instance, the base and height of the triangle double, so the deadweight loss rises 
by a factor of four. If we triple the size of a tax, the base and height triple, so the 
deadweight loss rises by a factor of nine. 
The government's tax revenue is the size of the tax times the amount of the good 
sold. As the first three panels of Figure 6 show, tax revenue equals the area of the 
rectangle between the supply and demand curves. For the small tax in panel (a), 
tax revenue is small. As the size of the tax increases from panel (a) to panel (b), tax 
revenue grows. But as the size of the tax increases further from panel (b) to panel 
(c), tax revenue falls because the higher tax drastically reduces the size of the mar￾ket. For a very large tax, no revenue would be raised because people would stop 
buying and selling the good altogether. 
The last two panels of Figure 6 summarize these results. In panel (d), we see 
that as the size of a tax increases, its deadweight loss quickly gets larger. By 
contrast, panel (e) shows that tax revenue first rises with the size of the tax, but 
as the tax increases further, the market shrinks so much that tax revenue starts 
to fall. 
The Laffer Curve and Supply-Side Economics 
One day in 1974, the economist Arthur Laffer sat in a Washington 
restaurant with some prominent journalists and politicians. He 
took out a napkin and drew a figure on it to show how tax rates 
affect tax revenue. It looked much like panel (e) of Figure 6. Laffer then sug￾gested that the United States was on the downward-sloping side of this curve. 
Tax rates were so high, he argued, that reducing them might actually increase 
tax revenue. 
Most economists were skeptical of Laffer’s suggestion. They accepted the idea 
that a cut in tax rates could increase tax revenue as a matter of theory, but they 
doubted whether it would do so in practice. There was scant evidence for Laffer’s 
view that U.S. tax rates had, in fact, reached such extreme levels. 
Nonetheless, the Laffer curve (as it became known) captured the imagination of 
Ronald Reagan. David Stockman, budget director in the first Reagan administra￾tion, offers the following story: 
[Reagan] had once been on the Laffer curve himself. “I came into the Big Money 
making pictures during World War II,” he would always say. At that time, the 
wartime income surtax hit 90 percent. “You could only make four pictures, and 
then you were in the top bracket,” he would continue. “So we all quit work￾ing after four pictures and went off to the country.” High tax rates caused less 
work. Low tax rates caused more. His experience proved it. 
When Reagan ran for president in 1980, he made cutting taxes part of his platform. 
Reagan argued that taxes were so high that they were discouraging hard work

and thereby depressing incomes. He argued that lower taxes would give people 
more incentive to work, which in turn would raise economic well-being. He sug￾gested that incomes could rise by so much that tax revenue might increase, despite 
the lower tax rates. Because the cut in tax rates was intended to encourage people 
to increase the quantity of labor they supplied, the views of Laffer and Reagan 
became known as supply-side economics. 
Economists continue to debate Laffer’s argument. Many believe that subse￾quent history refuted Laffer’s conjecture that lower tax rates would raise tax rev￾enue. Yet because history is open to alternative interpretations, others view the 
events of the 1980s as more favorable to the supply siders. To evaluate Laffer’s 
hypothesis definitively, we would need to rerun history without the Reagan tax 
cuts and see if tax revenues would have been higher or lower. But that experi￾ment is impossible. 
Some economists take an intermediate position. They believe that while an 
overall cut in tax rates normally reduces revenue, some taxpayers may occasion￾ally find themselves on the wrong side of the Laffer curve. Other things being 
equal, a tax cut is more likely to raise tax revenue if the cut applies to those tax￾payers facing the highest tax rates. In addition, Laffer's argument may be more 
compelling for countries with much higher tax rates than the United States. In 
Sweden in the early 1980s, for instance, the typical worker faced 
a marginal tax rate of about 80 percent. Such a high tax rate pro￾vides a substantial disincentive to work. Studies have suggested 
that Sweden would have indeed raised more tax revenue with 
lower tax rates. 
Economists disagree about these issues in part because 
“Acut in federal income tax rates in the United States night now 
[2012] would lead to higher national income within five years 
than without the tax cut.”

there is no consensus about the size of the relevant elasticities. 
The more elastic supply and demand are in any market, the 
more taxes distort behavior, and the more likely it is that a tax 
cut will increase tax revenue. There is, however, agreement 
about the general lesson: How much revenue the government 
gains or loses from a tax change cannot be computed just by 
looking at tax rates. It also depends on how the tax change 
affects people’s behavior. 
An update to this story: Arthur Laffer rose to prominence 
again during the 2016 presidential campaign, when he was 
an adviser to Donald Trump. As recounted in his book with 
Stephen Moore, Trumponomics, he encouraged the candidate 
to propose a large tax cut. Laffer’s argument was like the one 
he made years earlier: Why settle for the 2 percent growth that 
most economists were projecting? Wouldn’t all our problems 
be easier to handle with a more rapidly expanding economy? 
The book quotes Trump as saying, when announcing his tax 
plan, that it would not increase the government’s budget 
deficit (the shortfall of tax revenue from government spend￾ing) because it would raise growth rates to “3, or 4, 5, or even 
6 percent.” Most economists, however, were skeptical. And 
they were right to be. In the two years after the tax cut went 
into effect, the economy grew at 2.4 percent, and the budget 
deficit swelled. ®

8-4 Conclusion 
This chapter applied the tools of welfare economics to better understand taxes. 
One of the Ten Principles of Economics in Chapter 1 is that markets are usually a 
good way to organize economic activity. Chapter 7 made this principle more precise 
using the concepts of consumer surplus, producer surplus, and market efficiency. 
Here, we have seen that when the government taxes a good, it makes the allocation 
of resources less efficient. Taxes are costly not only because they transfer resources 
from market participants to the government but also because they distort incentives 
and create deadweight losses. 
The analysis here and in Chapter 6 sheds much light on the effects of taxes, but it 
is not the end of the story. Microeconomists study how best to design a tax system, 
including how to strike the right balance between efficiency and equity. And they 
consider how, when a market failure impedes efficiency, well-targeted taxes can 
sometimes fix the problem. Macroeconomists study how taxes influence the over￾all economy and how policymakers can use the tax system to stabilize economic 
activity and promote rapid growth. So as you study economics, don't be surprised 
when the subject of taxation comes up yet again. 
Chapter in a Nutshell 
* A tax on a good reduces the welfare of buyers and the elasticities of supply and demand measure how 
sellers of that good, and the reduction in consumer 
and producer surplus usually exceeds the revenue 
raised by the government. The fall in total surplus— 
the sum of consumer surplus, producer surplus, and 
tax revenue—is called the deadweight loss of the tax. 
Taxes have deadweight losses because they cause 
buyers to consume less and sellers to produce less, 
and these changes in behavior shrink the market 
below the level that maximizes total surplus. Because 
much buyers and sellers respond to market condi￾tions, larger elasticities imply larger deadweight 
losses. 
As a tax grows larger, it distorts incentives more, 
and its deadweight loss grows larger. Because a tax 
reduces the size of the market, however, tax revenue 
does not continually increase. It first rises with the 
size of a tax, but if the tax gets large enough, tax rev￾enue starts to fall.

This chapter analyzed the welfare effects of a tax on 
a good. Now consider the opposite policy. Suppose 
that the government subsidizes a good: For each 
unit of the good sold, the government pays 52 to 
the buyer. How does the subsidy affect consumer 
surplus, producer surplus, tax revenue, and total 
surplus? Does a subsidy lead to a deadweight loss? 
Explain. 
Hotel rooms in Smalltown go for $100, and 1,000 
rooms are rented on a typical day. 
a. To raise revenue, the mayor decides to charge 
hotels a tax of $10 per rented room. After the tax 
is imposed, the going rate rises to $108, and the 
number of rooms rented falls to 900. Calculate the 
amount of revenue this tax raises for Smalltown 
and the deadweight loss of the tax. (Hint: The area 
of a triangle is ¥4 ¥ base x height.) 
b. The mayor now doubles the tax to $20. The price 
rises to 5116, and the number of rooms rented falls 
to 800. Calculate the tax revenue and deadweight 
loss with this larger tax. Are they double, more

Graph this relationship for T between 0 and 300. 
d. The deadweight loss of a tax is the area of the 
triangle between the supply and demand curves. 
Recalling that the area of a triangle is 14 % base 
height, solve for deadweight loss as a function 
of T. Graph this relationship for T between 0 and 
300. (Hint: If you look sideways, the base of the

Americans a century ago, that would not have been the case: 
The textile and clothing industries were then a major part of the 
domestic economy. But as foreign factories started to produce 
quality goods at a lower cost, US. firms shut down domestic 
production and laid off workers. Today, most of the textiles and 
clothing that Americans consume are imported. 
This shift in the textile and clothing industries raises important 
questions: How does international trade affect economic well￾being? Who gains and who loses from trade among countries, and 
how do the gains compare with the losses? 
Chapter 3 introduced the study of international trade by apply￾ing the principle of comparative advantage. This principle says that 
all countries can benefit from trade because it allows each country 
to specialize in what it does best. But the analysis in Chapter 3 was 
incomplete. It did not explain how the international marketplace 
achieves these gains from trade or how the gains are distributed 
among the various market participants.

We now tackle these questions using the tools developed over the past several 
chapters: supply, demand, equilibrium, consumer surplus, producer surplus, and so 
on. These tools can help explain how international trade affects economic well-being. 
9-1 The Determinants of Trade 
Figure 1 
Consider the textile market. It is well suited to studying the gains and losses from 
international trade: Textiles are made and traded around the world, and policymak￾ers often consider (and sometimes implement) trade restrictions to protect domestic 
textile producers from foreign competitors. Here, we examine the textile market in 
the imaginary country of Isoland. 
9-1a The Equilibrium without Trade 
As our story begins, the Isolandian textile market is cut off from the rest of the world. 
By government decree, no one in Isoland is allowed to import or export textiles, and 
the penalty for violating this prohibition is so large that no one dares try. 
Because there is no international trade, the market for textiles in Isoland consists 
solely of domestic buyers and sellers. As Figure 1 shows, the domestic price adjusts 
to balance the quantity supplied by domestic sellers and the quantity demanded 
by domestic buyers. The figure shows the consumer and producer surplus in the 
equilibrium without trade. The sum of consumer and producer surplus measures 
the total benefits that buyers and sellers receive from the textile market. 
Now suppose that, in a political upset, Isoland elects Olivia Openminded as its 
new president. After campaigning on a platform of “change” and promising bold 
new ideas, President Openminded’s first act is to assemble a team of economists to 
evaluate Isolandian trade policy. She asks them to report on three questions: 
¢ [f the government allows Isolandians to import and export textiles, what will 
happen to the price and quantity of textiles sold in the domestic market? 
* Who will gain from free trade in textiles and who will lose, and will the 
gains exceed the losses? 
¢ Should a tariff (a tax on textile imports) be part of the new trade policy? 
The Equilibrium without 
International Trade 
When an economy cannot trade 
in world markets, the price 
adjusts to balance domestic 
supply and demand. This figure 
shows consumer and producer 
surplus in an equilibrium without

market in |soland.

After reviewing supply and demand in their favorite textbook (this one, of course), 
the Isolandian economics team begins its analysis. 
9-1b The World Price and Comparative Advantage 
The first issue the economists take up is whether Isoland is likely to become a textile 
importer or exporter. In other words, if free trade is allowed, will [solandians end 
up buying or selling textiles in world markets? 
To answer this question, the economists compare the current Isolandian price of 
textiles with the price prevailing in other countries, called the world price. If the 
world price of textiles exceeds the domestic price, then Isoland will export textiles 
once trade is permitted. Isolandian textile producers will be eager to receive the 
higher prices available abroad and will start selling their textiles to consumers in 
other countries. Conversely, if the world price is lower than the domestic price, 
Isoland will import textiles. Because foreign sellers offer a better price, Isolandian 
textile consumers will quickly start buying textiles from other countries. 
In essence, comparing the world price and the domestic price without trade 
reveals whether Isoland has a comparative advantage in producing textiles. The 
domestic price reflects the opportunity cost: It tells us how much an Isolandian 
must give up to obtain one unit of textiles. If the domestic price is low, the cost 
of producing textiles in Isoland is low, suggesting that Isoland has a comparative 
advantage in producing textiles relative to the rest of the world. If the domestic 
price is high, then the cost of producing textiles in Isoland is high, suggesting that 
foreign countries have a comparative advantage in producing textiles. 
As Chapter 3 discussed, trade among nations is based on comparative advan￾tage. That is, trade is beneficial because it allows each nation to specialize in what 
it does best. By comparing the world price with the domestic price without trade, 
we can determine whether Isoland is better or worse than the rest of the world at 
producing textiles.

9-2 The Winners and Losers from Trade 
To analyze the welfare effects of trade, the Isolandian economists begin by assum￾ing that Isoland is small compared with the rest of the world. This small-economy 
assumption means that Isoland’s actions have a negligible effect on world markets. 
Answers are at the end of the chapter.

Specifically, changes in Isoland’s trade policy will not affect the world price of 
textiles. The Isolandians are said to be price takers in the world economy. That is, 
they take the price of textiles as given by the forces of supply and demand in the 
world market. Isoland can be an exporting country by selling textiles at the world 
price or an importing country by buying textiles at this price. 
The small-economy assumption is not necessary to analyze the gains and losses 
from international trade, but the Isolandian economists know from experience (and 
from reading Chapter 2 of this book) that making simplifying assumptions is a key 
part of building a useful economic model. The assumption that Isoland is a small 
economy simplifies the analysis, and the basic lessons do not change in the more 
complicated case of a large economy. 
9-2a The Gains and Losses of an Exporting Country 
Figure 2 shows the Isolandian textile market when the domestic equilibrium price 
without trade is below the world price. Once trade is allowed, the domestic price 
rises to equal the world price. If market participants are all looking for the best 
price they can get, no seller of textiles would accept less than the world price, and 
no buyer would pay more than the world price. 
After the domestic price has risen to equal the world price, the domestic quantity 
supplied differs from the domestic quantity demanded. The supply curve shows 
the quantity of textiles supplied by Isolandian sellers. The demand curve shows the

quantity of textiles demanded by Isolandian buyers. Because the domestic quantity 
supplied exceeds the domestic quantity demanded, Isoland sells textiles to other 
countries. This means that Isoland becomes a textile exporter. 
Although the domestic quantity supplied and the domestic quantity demanded 
differ, the textile market is still in equilibrium because there is now another par￾ticipant in the market: the rest of the world. One can view the horizontal line at 
the world price as representing the rest of the world’s demand for textiles. This 
demand curve is perfectly elastic because Isoland, as a small economy, can sell as 
many textiles as it wants at the world price. 
Consider the gains and losses from opening trade. Clearly, not everyone ben￾efits. Trade forces the domestic price to rise to the world price. Domestic produc￾ers of textiles are better off because they can now sell textiles at a higher price, but 
domestic consumers of textiles are worse off because they now have to buy textiles 
at a higher price. 
To measure these gains and losses, look at the changes in the consumer and 
producer surplus. Before trade is allowed, the price of textiles adjusts to balance 
supply and demand in the domestic market. Consumer surplus, the area between 
the demand curve and the before-trade price, is area A + B. Producer surplus, the 
area between the supply curve and the before-trade price, is area C. Total surplus 
before trade, which is the sum of consumer and producer surplus,isarea A + B + C. 
After trade is allowed, the domestic price rises to the world price. Consumer 
surplus shrinks to area A (the area between the demand curve and the world price). 
Producer surplus increases to area B + C + D (the area between the supply curve 
and the world price). Total surplus with trade isarea A + B+ C + D. 
These welfare calculations show who wins and who loses from trade in an export￾ing country. Sellers benefit because producer surplus increases by area B + D. Buyers 
are worse off because consumer surplus decreases by area B. Because the gains of 
sellers exceed the losses of buyers by area D, total surplus in Isoland increases. 
This analysis of an exporting country yields two conclusions: 
* When a country allows trade and becomes an exporter of a good, domestic 
producers of the good are better off, and domestic consumers of the good 
are worse off. 
¢ Trade raises the economic well-being of a nation in the sense that the gains 
of the winners exceed the losses of the losers. 
9-2b The Gains and Losses of an Importing Country 
Now, suppose that the domestic price before trade is above the world price. Once 
again, after trade is allowed, the domestic price becomes the world price. As 
Figure 3 shows, the domestic quantity supplied is less than the domestic quantity 
demanded. The difference between the domestic quantity demanded and the 
domestic quantity supplied is bought from other countries, and Isoland becomes 
a textile importer. 
In this case, the horizontal line at the world price represents the supply of textiles 
from the rest of the world. This supply curve is perfectly elastic because Isoland is 
a small economy and can buy as much as it wants at the world price. 
Consider the gains and losses from trade. Once again, not everyone benefits, 
but here, the winners and losers are reversed. When trade reduces the domestic 
price, domestic consumers are better off (they can buy textiles at a lower price), 
and domestic producers are worse off (they must sell at a lower price). Changes in 
consumer and producer surplus measure the size of the gains and losses. Before

These welfare calculations show who wins and who loses from trade in an import￾ing country. Buyers benefit because consumer surplus increases by area B + D. 
Sellers are worse off because producer surplus falls by area B. The gains of buyers 
exceed the losses of sellers, and total surplus increases by area D. 
This analysis of an importing country yields two conclusions parallel to those 
for an exporting country: 
When a country allows trade and becomes an importer of a good, domestic 
consumers of the good are better off, and domestic producers are worse off. 
Trade raises the economic well-being of a nation in the sense that the gains 
of the winners exceed the losses of the losers. 
This analysis of trade helps explain, and qualify, one of the Ten Principles of 
Economics in Chapter 1: Trade can make everyone better off. What does this state￾ment actually mean? 
If Isoland opens its textile market to international trade, the change creates win￾ners and losers, regardless of whether Isoland ends up exporting or importing

textiles. In either case, however, the gains of the winners exceed the losses of the 
losers, so the winners could compensate the losers and still be better off. In this 
sense, trade can make everyone better off. But will trade make everyone better off? 
Probably not. In practice, compensating the losers from international trade is rare. 
Without such compensation, opening an economy to international trade expands 
the size of the economic pie but can leave some people with a smaller slice. 
This is why the debate over trade policy is often contentious. Whenever a policy 
creates winners and losers, the stage is set for a political battle. Nations sometimes 
limit trade because the losers from trade are better organized than the winners. The 
losers may turn their cohesiveness into political clout and lobby for trade restric￾tions such as tariffs or import quotas. 
9-2¢ The Effects of a Tariff 
The Isolandian economists next consider the effects of a tariff—a tax on imported 
goods. The economists quickly realize that a tariff on textiles will have no effect if 
Isoland becomes a textile exporter. That's because if no one in Isoland is interested 
in importing textiles, a tax on textile imports is irrelevant. The tariff matters only if 
Isoland becomes a textile importer. Concentrating their attention on this case, the 
economists compare welfare with and without the tariff. 
Figure 4 shows the [solandian market for textiles. With free trade, the domestic 
price equals the world price. A tariff raises the price of imported textiles above the 
world price by the amount of the tariff. Domestic suppliers, who compete with 
foreign suppliers of imported textiles, can now sell their goods for the world price 
plus the tariff. As a result, the price of textiles—both imported and domestic—rises 
by the amount of the tariff and is closer to the price without trade. 
The change in price affects the behavior of domestic buyers and sellers. Because 
the tariff raises the price of textiles, it reduces the domestic quantity demanded 
from Q7 to Q) and raises the domestic quantity supplied from Q] to 0. The tariff 
reduces the quantity of imports and moves the domestic market closer to its 
equilibrium without trade. 
Consider the gains and losses from the tariff. Because it raises the domestic price, 
domestic sellers are better off, and domestic buyers are worse off. In addition, the 
government gets the tariff revenue, which it can use for public purposes. These gains 
and losses are measured by the changes in consumer surplus, producer surplus, 
and government revenue, as in Chapter 8. These changes are summarized in the 
table in Figure 4. 
Before the tariff, the domestic price equals the world price. Consumer surplus, the 
area between the demand curve and the world price,isareaA+ B+ C+ D+ E+FE 
Producer surplus, the area between the supply curve and the world price, is area 
G. Government revenue equals zero. Total surplus, the sum of consumer surplus, 
producer surplus, and government revenue, isareaA+ B+ C+ D+ E+ F+ G 
With a tariff, the domestic price exceeds the world price by the tariff’s amount. 
Consumer surplus is now area A + B. Producer surplus is area C + G. Government 
revenue, which is the size of the tariff multiplied by the quantity of after-tariff 
imports, is area E. Total surplus with the tariffisareaA+ B+ C+ E + G. 
To determine the total welfare effects of the tariff, add the change in consumer 
surplus (which is negative), the change in producer surplus (positive), and the 
change in government revenue (positive). The result is that total surplus decreases 
by area D + F. This fall in total surplus is the deadweight loss of the tariff. 
A tariff causes a deadweight loss because, like most taxes, it distorts incentives 
and pushes the allocation of scarce resources away from the optimum. In this

case, note two effects. First, when the tariff raises the domestic price of textiles 
above the world price, it encourages domestic producers to increase produc￾tion from Q] to Q3. Even though it costs more to make these units than to buy 
them at the world price, the tariff makes it profitable for domestic producers to 
manufacture them anyway. Second, when the tariff raises the price for domestic 
consumers, it leads them to reduce consumption from QY to Q. Even though 
domestic consumers are willing to pay more for these units than the world 
price, the tariff induces them to cut back on purchases. Area D represents the 
deadweight loss from the overproduction of textiles, and area F represents 
the deadweight loss from the underconsumption. The total deadweight loss is the 
sum of these two triangles.

Cengage Learning reserves the right o remewe addiional coment o any time if subsequent nghts resmnctions require ieyond tariffs, another way that nations sometimes restrict inter￾national trade is by putting limits on how much of a good can be 
imported. This book won't analyze such a policy ather than to point out 
the conclusion: Import quotas are much like tariffs. Both tariffs and 
quotas reduce the quantity of imports, raise the domestic price of a 
good, decrease the welfare of domestic consumers, increase the welfare 
of domestic producers, and cause deadweight losses. 
There is only one difference between these two types of trade restriction: 
A tariff raises revenue for the government, while an import quota generates 
surplus for those who obtain the permits to import. The profit for holders 
of import permits is the difference between the domestic price (at which 
they sell the imported good) and the world price (at which they buy it). 
Tariffs and import quatas are even more similar if the government charges 
a fee for these permits. Suppose the government sets the permit fee equal to 
9-2d The Lessons for Trade Policy 
Chapter 9 Application: International Trade 
the difference between the domestic and world price. In this case, the entire 
profit of permit holders is paid to the government in permit fees, and the 
import quota works exactly like a tariff. Consumer surplus, producer surplus, 
and government revenue are precisely the same under the two policies. 
In practice, however, countries that restrict trade with import quotas 
rarely do so by selling import permits. For example, the U.5. government 
has at times pressured Japan to “voluntarily” limit the sale of Japanese 
cars in the United States. In this case, the Japanese government allocates 
the import permits to Japanese firms, and these firms get the surplus from 
these permits. From the standpoint of U.S. welfare, this kind of impart 
quota is worse than a U.5. tariff on imported cars. Both a tariff and an 
import quota raise prices, restrict trade, and cause deadweight losses, 
hut at least the tariff generates revenue for the LS. government rather 
than profit for foreign producers. | 
The team of Isolandian economists writes to the new president: 
Dear President Openminded, 
You asked three questions about opening trade. After much hard work, we 
have the answers. 
Question: If the government allows Isolandians to import and export 
textiles, what will happen to the price and quantity of textiles 
sold in the domestic market? 
Answer: Once trade is allowed, the Isolandian price will move to equal 
177 
the price prevailing around the world. 
If the Isolandian price before trade is below the world price, our 
price will rise. The higher price will reduce the amount of textiles 
Isolandians consume and raise the amount Isolandians produce. 
Isoland will become a textile exporter because, in this case, it has 
a comparative advantage in producing textiles. 
Conversely, if the Isolandian price before trade is above the 
world price, our price will fall. The lower price will increase the 
amount of textiles Isolandians consume and lower the amount we 
produce. In this case, [soland will become a textile importer because 
other countries have a comparative advantage in producing textiles. 
Question: Who will gain from free trade in textiles and who will lose, and 
will the gains exceed the losses? 
The answer depends on whether the price rises or falls when 
trade is allowed. If the price rises, producers of textiles gain, and

consumers lose. If the price falls, consumers gain, and producers 
lose. But in both cases, the gains are larger than the losses, so free 
trade raises the total welfare of Isolandians. 
Question: Should a tariff be part of the new trade policy? 
Answer: A tariff has an impact only if Isoland becomes a textile importer. 
In this case, a tariff moves the economy closer to the no-trade 
equilibrium and, like most taxes, causes deadweight losses. A tar￾iff improves the welfare of domestic producers and raises revenue 
for the government, but these gains are more than offset by the 
losses suffered by consumers. The best policy, from the standpoint 
of economic efficiency, would be to allow trade without a tariff. 
Finally, you should bear in mind that moving to free trade in textiles will create 
losers as well as winners, even if the losses of the losers are smaller than the gains 
of the winners. So expect some of your constituents to oppose the policy. To blunt 
this opposition and spread the gains more equitably, you may want to make sure 
that the social safety net is generous enough to soften the blow for the losers. 
We hope you find these answers helpful as you decide on your new policy. 
Your faithful servants, 
Isolandian economics team 
9-2¢ Other Benefits of International Trade 
The conclusions of the Isolandian economics team are based on the standard analysis 
of international trade. Their analysis uses the most fundamental tools in the econo￾mist’s toolbox: supply, demand, and producer and consumer surplus. It shows that 
free trade entails winners and losers, but the gains of the winners exceed the losses 
of the losers. 
The case for free trade can be made even stronger, however, because there are 
several other economic benefits of trade beyond those emphasized in the standard 
analysis. In a nutshell, here are some of them: 
¢ Increased variety of goods. Goods produced in different countries are not 
exactly the same. German beer, for instance, is not the same as American beer. 
Free trade gives consumers in all countries a greater variety to choose from. 
* Lower costs through economies of scale. Some goods can be produced at 
low cost only if they are produced in large quantities—a phenomenon called 
economies of scale. A firm cannot take full advantage of economies of scale 
if it can sell only in a small domestic market. Free trade gives firms access to 
world markets, allowing them to realize economies of scale more fully. 
¢ Increased competition. A company shielded from foreign competitors is 
more likely to have market power, enabling it to raise prices above competi￾tive levels. This is a type of market failure that hurts consumers and leads 
to inefficiencies. Opening trade fosters competition and gives the invisible 
hand a better chance to work its magic. 
* Increased productivity. When a nation opens to international trade, the most 
productive firms expand their markets, while the least productive are forced 
out by increased competition. As resources move from the least to the most 
productive firms, overall productivity rises.

* Enhanced flow of ideas. The transfer of technological advances around 
the world is often linked to the exchange of the goods that embody those 
advances. The best way for a poor agricultural nation to quickly learn 
about the computer revolution, for instance, is to buy some computers from 
abroad rather than trying to make them from scratch. 
In short, free trade increases variety for consumers, allows firms to take advantage 
of economies of scale, makes markets more competitive, makes the economy more 
productive, and fosters the spread of technology. If the Isolandian economists also 
took these benefits into account, their advice to the president would be even more 
forceful.

Answers are at the end of the chapter. 
9-3 The Arguments for Restricting Trade 
The letter from the Isolandian economics team starts to persuade President 
Openminded to consider allowing trade in textiles. She notes that the domestic 
price is now high compared with the world price. Free trade would, therefore, 
cause the price of textiles to fall and hurt domestic textile producers. Before imple￾menting the new policy, she asks Isolandian textile companies to comment on the 
economists” advice. 
Not surprisingly, the textile companies oppose free trade in textiles. They believe 
that the government should protect the domestic textile industry from foreign 
competition. Let’s consider some of the arguments they might use to support their 
position and how the economics team would respond.

9-3a The Jobs Argument 
Opponents of free trade often say it destroys jobs. For Isoland, for example, free trade 
in textiles could cause the price to fall, reducing the quantity produced domesti￾cally and slashing employment in the local textile industry. This job loss is an ugly 
picture and one that often occurs when trade expands. 
Yet free trade creates new jobs even as it destroys some old ones. When Isolandians 
buy textiles from other countries, those countries get the resources to buy other 
goods from Isoland. Displaced Isolandian textile workers can move to industries

trade?!” one country is better than another country at producing everything, each country 
can gain from trading with the other. Workers will eventually find jobs in industries 
in which their country has a comparative advantage. 
9-3b The National-Security Argument 
When an industry is threatened with international competition, opponents of 
free trade often argue that the industry is vital to national security. For example, 
Isolandian steel companies might point out that steel is used to make guns and tanks. 
Free trade in steel could lead Isoland to become dependent on foreign countries to 
supply steel. If a war interrupted the foreign supply, Isoland might be unable to 
quickly produce enough steel and weapons to defend itself. 
Economists acknowledge that protecting key industries may be appropriate when 
there are legitimate concerns over national security. Yet they know that this argu￾ment is often used too readily by producers eager to gain at consumers’ expense. 
Pay attention to who is making the national security argument. Companies have 
a financial incentive to exaggerate their role in national defense because protec￾tion from foreign competition can be lucrative. A nation’s generals may see things 
differently. In fact, when the military buys an industry’s output, it is a consumer 
and benefits from imports. Cheaper steel in [soland, for example, would allow the 
Isolandian military to stockpile weapons at a lower cost. 
9-3¢ The Infant-Industry Argument 
New industries sometimes call for temporary trade restrictions to help them get 
started. After a period of protection, the argument goes, they will be strong enough 
to compete with foreign firms. Similarly, older industries sometimes say they need 
temporary protection until they adjust to new conditions. 
Economists are often skeptical about such claims, largely because the infant￾industry argument is hard to implement in practice. To apply the protection suc￾cessfully, the government would need to determine which industries will eventually 
be profitable and decide whether the benefits of establishing them exceed the costs 
to consumers. Yet picking winners is extraordinarily difficult. It is made even more 
so by the political process, which often rewards industries with the most clout. 
And once a politically powerful industry is favored, the “temporary” policy can 
become permanent. 
In addition, many economists question the infant-industry argument in principle. 
Suppose, for instance, that an industry is young and unable to compete against

In this case, firm owners should be willing to 
incur temporary losses to obtain the eventual profits. Protection 
isn’t needed. Start-up firms often incur temporary losses yet suc￾ceed in the long run, even without protection from competition. 
9-3d The Unfair-Competition Argument 
It is often said that free trade is desirable only if all countries play 
by the same rules. If companies in different countries are subject 
to different laws and regulations, then it is unfair (the argument 
goes) to expect them to compete globally. For instance, suppose 
Neighborland subsidizes its textile industry, lowering the costs 
of production for the country’s textile companies. The Isolandian 
textile industry might argue that it should be protected from this 
foreign competition because Neighborland isn't competing fairly. 
Would it, in fact, hurt Isoland to buy textiles from another 
country at a subsidized price? Yes, Isolandian textile producers 
would suffer, but Isolandian consumers would love the low price. 
The case for free trade remains the same: Consumer gains exceed 
producer losses. Neighborland’s subsidy may be bad policy, but its 
taxpayers pay for it. [soland is better off when it can buy textiles 
at a subsidized price. Rather than objecting to foreign subsidies, 
perhaps Isoland should send Neighborland a thank-you note. 
9-3¢ The Protection-as-a-Bargaining-Chip 
Argument 
Trade restrictions can be a bargaining chip, some politicians say. 
Even if free trade is desirable, they argue, trade restrictions can 
be useful in obtaining concessions from our trading partners. 
For example, Isoland might threaten to impose a tariff on textiles 
unless Neighborland removes its tariff on wheat. If Neighborland 
responds to this threat by removing its tariff, the result can be 
freer trade. 
The problem with this strategy is that the threat may not work, 
leaving the country with two bad options. It can implement the 
trade restriction and shoot itself in the foot—reducing its own 
economic welfare is the way economists would put it. Or it can 
back down from its threat and lose prestige and future bargaining 
power. Why believe a tough-talking country that doesn’t follow 
through with action? Faced with these choices, the country would 
probably wish that it had never made the threat in the first place. 
Trade Agreements and the World 
Trade Organization 
A country can take one of two roads toward free 
trade. With a unilateral approach, it can remove 
its trade restrictions on its own. Great Britain did this in the 
19th century, and Chile and South Korea did it more recently. 
Alternatively, a country can take a multilateral approach, 
reducing its trade restrictions in concert with other countries. 
In other words, it can bargain with its trading partners in an 
attempt to reduce trade restrictions around the world.

One important example of the multilateral approach is the North American 
Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which in 1993 lowered trade barriers among the 
United States, Mexico, and Canada. An updated, new NAFTA, also known as the 
United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, went into effect in 2020. 
Another important multilateral pact is the General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade (GATT), a series of negotiations among many of the world’s countries with 
the goal of promoting free trade. The United States helped to found GATT after 
World War ILin response to the high tariffs imposed during the Great Depression of 
the 1930s. Many economists believe that those tariffs contributed to the worldwide 
economic hardship of that period. GATT successfully reduced the average tariff 
among member countries from more than 20 percent after World War II to less than 
5 percent in 2000. And it continued at a low level for many years thereafter. 
The rules established under GATT are enforced by an international institution 
called the World Trade Organization (WTQO). The WTO was established in 1995 
and has its headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland. As of 2021, 164 countries have 
joined the organization, accounting for 98 percent of world trade. The functions of 
the WTO are to administer trade agreements, provide a forum for negotiations, and 
handle disputes among member countries. 
But the road to free trade is not a one-way street. The United States, which pro￾moted the multilateral approach to free trade for decades, turned against it during 
the Trump administration and raised tariffs unilaterally in disputes with China, 
the European Union, and many other countries. The arguments were familiar and

Andy Warhol's Guide to 
e Public Policy 
Inften ask people in my business—public 
policy—where they get their inspira￾tion. Liberals often point to John F. Kennedy. 
Conservatives usually cite Ronald Reagan. 
Personally, | prefer the artist Andy Warhaol, who 
famously declared, “I like boring things.” He 
was referring to art, of course. But the sentiment 
provides solid public policy guidance as well. 
Warhaol's work exalted the everyday “boring” 
items that display the transcendental beauty of 
life itself. The canonical example is his famous 
paintings of Campbell Soup cans. Some people 
sneered, but those willing to look closely could 
see what he was doing. It is the same idea 
expressed in an old Zen saying, often attrib￾uted to the eighth-century Chinese Buddhist 
philosopher Layman Pang: “How wondrously 
supernatural and miraculous! | draw water and 
| carry wood!"” 
Warhaol's critical insight is usually lost on 
most of the world. This is not because people 
are stupid, but because our brains are wired 
to filter out the mundane and focus on the 
novel. This turns out to be an important survival 
adaptation. To discern a predator, you must 
filter out the constant rustling of leaves and 
notice the strange snap of a twig. 
Warhol believed that defeating this cogni￾tive bias led to greater appreciation of beauty. 
It also leads to better public policy, especially 
in relieving poverty. For example, while our 
attention is naturally drawn to the latest fas￾cinating and expensive innovations in tropical 
public health, many experts insist it is cheap, 
boring mosquito bed nets that best protect 
against malaria. Despite their lifesaving util￾ity, these boring nets tend to be chranically 
underprovided. 
We can look closer to home, too. People love 
to find ways to get fancy technology into poor 
schoolchildren's hands, but arguably the best 
way to help children falling behind in schoal is 
simply to devise ways to get them to show up. 
But the very best example of the Warhol prin￾ciple in policy is international trade. If it is prog￾ress against poverty that we're pursuing, trade 
beats the pants off every fancy development pro￾gram ever devised. The simple mundane beauty

included many of the critiques of free trade discussed earlier. Some U.S. trading 
partners retaliated with higher tariffs of their own. For example, at the start of 
2018, tariffs applied to very little trade between the United States and China. By 
the end of 2020, more than half of U.S. imports from China were subject to U.S. 
tariffs with an average rate of about 20 percent, and more than half of Chinese 
imports from the United States were subject to Chinese tariffs of about the same 
size. Where global tariffs will end up in the years ahead is far from certain. 
What are the pros and cons of resuming the multilateral approach to free trade? 
One advantage is that it has the potential to result in freer trade than a unilateral 
approach because it can reduce trade restrictions abroad as well as at home. If inter￾national negotiations fail, however, the result could be more restricted trade than 
under a unilateral approach. 
In addition, the multilateral approach may have a political advantage. In most 
markets, because producers are fewer and better organized than consumers, they 
have more political clout. Reducing the Isolandian tariff on textiles, for example, 
may be politically difficult if considered by itself. The textile companies would 
oppose free trade, and the buyers of textiles who would benefit are so numerous 
that organizing their support would be difficult. Yet suppose that Neighborland 
promises to reduce its tariff on wheat while Isoland reduces its tariff on textiles. In 
this case, the Isolandian wheat farmers, who are also politically powerful, would 
back the agreement. The multilateral approach can sometimes win political support 
when a unilateral approach cannot. ® 
of making things and exchanging them freely 
is the best anti-poverty achievement in history. 
For more than two decades, the global 
poverty rate has been decreasing by roughly 
1 percent a year. To put this in perspective, that 
comes to about 70 million people—equivalent 
to the whale population of Turkey or Thailand— 
climbing out of poverty annually. Add it up, and

serious issues, but protectionism is never the 
answer. Curbing trade benefits entrenched

9-4 Conclusion 
Economists and the public often hold different views about international trade. 
PPublic-opinion polls typically find that people are mixed on whether trade is an 
opportunity or a threat. Politicians often reflect this mixed verdict. By contrast, 
economists overwhelmingly support free trade. They view it as a way of allocat￾ing production efficiently and raising living standards both at home and abroad. 
Economists view the fifty states of the United States as an ongoing experiment 
that confirms the virtues of free trade. Throughout its history, the United States has 
allowed unrestricted trade among the states, and the country has benefited from the 
specialization that trade allows. Florida grows oranges, Texas pumps oil, California 
makes wine, and so on. Americans would not enjoy the standard of living they do 
today if people could consume only those goods and services produced in their 
own states. The world could similarly benefit from free trade among countries. 
To better understand economists’ view of trade, return to Isoland. Suppose that 
President Openminded, after reading the latest poll results, ignores the advice of 
her economics team and decides not to allow free trade in textiles. The country 
remains in the equilibrium without international trade. 
Then, one day, an Isolandian named Isabel Inventor discovers a way to make 
textiles at a very low cost. The process is secret, however. What is odd is that Inventor 
doesn’t need traditional inputs such as cotton or wool. The only material input 
she needs is wheat. And even more oddly, to manufacture textiles from wheat, she 
hardly needs any labor input at all. 
Inventor is hailed as a genius. Because everyone buys clothing, the lower cost of 
textiles gives all Isolandians a higher standard of living. Workers who had previ￾ously produced textiles experience some hardship when their factories close, but 
eventually, they find work in other industries. Some become farmers and grow the 
wheat that Inventor turns into textiles. Others enter new industries that emerge as 
a result of higher Isolandian living standards. Everyone understands that the dis￾placement of workers in outmoded industries is an inevitable part of technological 
progress and economic growth. 
After several years, a journalist named Roberto Reporter decides to investigate 
this mysterious new textile process. He sneaks into Inventor’s factory and learns 
that she has not been making textiles at all. Instead, she has been smuggling wheat 
abroad in exchange for textiles from other countries. The only thing that Inventor 
had discovered was the gains from international trade.

When Reporter reveals the truth, the government shuts down Inventor’s opera￾tion. The price of textiles rises, and workers return to jobs in textile factories. Living 
standards in Isoland fall back to their former levels. Inventor is jailed and held up 
to public ridicule. After all, she was no inventor. She was just an economist. 
Chapter in a Nutshell 
* The effects of free trade can be determined by compar￾ing the domestic price before trade with the world 
price. A low domestic price indicates that the country 
has a comparative advantage in producing the good 
and that the country will become an exporter. A high 
domestic price indicates that the rest of the world has 
a comparative advantage in producing the good and 
that the country will become an importer. 
* When a country allows trade and becomes an exporter 
of a good, producers of the good are better off, and 
consumers of the good are worse off. When a country 
allows trade and becomes an importer of a good, con￾sumers are better off, and producers are worse off. In 
both cases, the gains from trade exceed the losses. 
= A tariff—a tax on imports—moves a market closer to 
the equilibrium that would exist without trade and 
reduces the gains from trade. Domestic producers are

losses to consumers exceed these gains. 
International trade yields several benefits beyond 
those based on comparative advantage: greater prod￾uct variety for consumers, more opportunity for firms 
to take advantage of economies of scale, increased 
market competition, higher overall productivity as 
more productive firms expand and less productive 
ones contract, and improved access lo state-of-the-art 
technology. 
There are various arguments for restricting trade: 
protecting jobs, defending national security, helping 
infant industries, preventing unfair competition, and 
responding to foreign trade restrictions. Although 
some of these arguments have merit in some cases, 
most economists believe that free trade is usually the 
better policy.

™ irms that make and sell paper also create, as a by-product

Scientists say that once dioxin enters the environment, it can

the analysis of markets.

EXtE]_‘I]_a_]]_t]_eS markets are usually a good way to organize economic activity. 
Chapters 4 through 9 explained this principle. They examined how 
competitive markets allocate scarce resources and showed that the 
equilibrium of supply and demand typically allocates resources 
efficiently. To use Adam Smith’s metaphor, an “invisible hand” 
leads buyers and sellers to maximize the total benefits received

But unfettered markets are not a cure-all. The invisible hand 
on its own does not prevent firms in the paper market from emilt￾ting too much dioxin. Society needs to find some other way to 
solve this problem. This leads us to another ot the Ten Principles

externality 
the uncompensated 
impact of a person's 
actions on the well-being 
of a bystander 
The market failures examined here fall under a general category called exter￾nalities. An externality arises when someone engages in an action that influences 
a bystander’s well-being and when no compensation is paid for that effect. If the 
impact on the bystander is adverse, it is a negative externality. If it is beneficial, it 
is a positive externality. 
When externalities are present, society’s interest in a market outcome extends 
beyond the well-being of buyers and sellers in the market and includes the well￾being of bystanders. Because buyers and sellers do not take into account the external 
effects of their actions when deciding how much to demand or supply, the market 
equilibrium is not efficient. In other words, societal well-being is not maximized, 
and government policies can potentially correct the market failure. 
The release of dioxin into the environment, for instance, is a negative 
externality—and a grave one. Without government intervention, the produc￾ers of paper may not consider the full cost of the pollution they create, and 
the consumers of paper may not consider the full cost of the pollution they 
contribute to through their purchases. The market will allow too much dioxin 
to be emitted unless the government intervenes with well-designed policies. 
And indeed, the Environmental Protection Agency monitors dioxin levels and 
regulates its release. 
Externalities come in many forms, as do the policy responses that try to deal with 
them. Here are some examples: 
¢ The exhaust from automobiles is a negative externality because it creates 
smog that other people breathe and contributes to global climate change. 
Because drivers may ignore this externality when deciding what cars to 
buy and how much to use them, they tend to pollute too much. The federal 
government addresses this problem by setting emission standards for cars. 
It also taxes gasoline, subsidizes mass transit, and builds bicycle paths to 
reduce the amount that people drive. 
* Restored historic buildings confer a positive externality because people who 
see them enjoy their beauty and the sense of history they convey. But build￾ing owners, who do not capture the benefits experienced by passers-by, tend 
to tear down older buildings too quickly. Recognizing this problem, many 
local governments regulate the destruction of historic buildings and provide 
tax breaks to owners who restore them. 
¢ Barking dogs create a negative externality when neighbors are annoyed by 
their noise. Dog owners don't bear the full burden of the noise and tend to 
take too few precautions to prevent it. Local governments address this prob￾lem by making it illegal to disturb the peace. 
* Research into new technologies provides a positive externality because it 
creates knowledge that others can use. If individual inventors, firms, and 
universities cannot capture the benefits of their inventions, they may devote 
too few resources to research. The federal government addresses this prob￾lem partially through the patent system, which gives inventors exclusive use 
of their inventions for a limited period. 
¢ During the peak of a pandemic, busy restaurants create a negative exter￾nality by providing an opportunity for the disease to spread. Restaurant 
owners may ignore the health impact of their businesses on society. The 
government can address the problem by requiring restaurants to tempo￾rarily switch to take-out only (and perhaps compensating the restaurant 
owners and workers).

10-1 Externalities and Market Inefficiency 
In this section, we use the tools of welfare economies developed in Chapter 7 to examine 
how externalities affect economic well-being. The analysis shows why externalities 
cause markets to allocate resources inefficiently. Later sections examine the ways 
private individuals and public policymakers can remedy this type of market failure. 
10-1a Welfare Economics: A Recap 
Let’s first review the lessons of welfare economics from Chapter 7, using the market for 
steel as an example. Figure 1 shows the supply and demand curves in the steel market. 
Chapter 7 showed that the supply and demand curves contain important infor￾mation about costs and benefits. The demand curve reflects the value of steel to 
consumers, as measured by what they are willing to pay. At any quantity, the height 
of the demand curve shows the willingness to pay of the marginal buyer. In other 
words, it shows the value to the consumer of the last unit of steel bought. Similarly, 
the supply curve reflects the costs of producing steel. At any quantity, the height 
of the supply curve shows the cost to the marginal seller. In other words, it shows 
the cost to the producer of the last unit of steel sold. 
The price adjusts to balance the supply and demand for steel. The quantity pro￾duced and consumed in the market equilibrium, shown as Q,,, ..., in Figure 1, is 
efficient in the sense that it maximizes the sum of producer and consumer surplus. 
That is, the market allocates resources in a way that maximizes the total value to 
the consumers who buy and use steel minus the total costs to the producers who 
make and sell steel. 
Figure 1 Price of 
The Market for Steel Steel 
The demand curve reflects the value to 
buyers, and the supply curve reflects the 
costs of sellers. The eguilibrium quantity, 
Qe Maximizes the total value to 
buyers minus the total costs of sellers. In 
the absence of externalities, the market A 
equilibrium is efficient.

10-1b Negative Externalities 
Now suppose that steel factories emit pollution: For each unit of steel pro￾duced, a certain amount of smoke enters the atmosphere. Because these 
emissions create health and climate risks, they are a negative externality. 
How does this externality affect market efficiency? 
Because of this externality, the cost to society of producing steel exceeds 
the cost to steel producers. For each unit of steel produced, the social cost 
equals the direct, private costs of the steel producers plus the costs to bystand- 
“All I can say is that ers harmed by the emissions. Figure 2 shows the social cost of producing steel. The

being a leading curves reflects the cost of the pollution emitted. 
What quantity of steel should be produced? Consider what a committee of 
benevolent social planners would do. The planners want to maximize the total 
surplus derived from the market—the value to consumers of steel minus the cost 
of producing it. They take a broad perspective, however, and understand that the 
cost of producing steel includes the external costs of pollution. 
The planners would choose the production level at which the demand curve 
crosses the social-cost curve. This intersection determines the optimal amount of 
steel from the standpoint of society as a whole. Below this level of production, 
the value of the steel to consumers (measured by the height of the demand curve) 
exceeds the social cost of producing it (measured by the height of the social-cost 
curve). Above this level, the social cost of producing additional steel exceeds the 
value to consumers. 
Note that the equilibrium quantity of steel, Q, , ..., is larger than the socially 
optimal quantity, Q.- ©his inefficiency occurs because the market equilib￾rium reflects only the private costs of production. In the market equilibrium, the

is, at Q. ... the demand curve lies below the social-cost curve. Reducing steel 
production and consumption below the market equilibrium level raises total 
economic well-being. 
How can the social planners achieve the optimal outcome? One way is to tax steel 
producers for each ton of steel sold. The tax would shift the supply curve upward 
by the size of the tax. If the tax accurately reflected the external cost of pollutants 
released into the atmosphere, the new supply curve would coincide with the social￾cost curve. In the new market equilibrium, steel producers would produce the 
socially optimal quantity of steel. 
Economists say that such a tax internalizes the externality because it gives 
buyers and sellers in the market an incentive to consider the external effects of 
their actions. Steel producers would, in essence, take the costs of pollution into 
account when deciding how much steel to supply because the tax would make 
them pay for these external costs. And, because the market price would reflect 
the tax on producers, consumers of steel would have an incentive to buy less. 
The policy is based on one of the Ten Principles of Economics: People respond 
to incentives. Later in this chapter, we discuss more fully how policymakers can 
deal with externalities. 
10-1¢ Positive Externalities 
Although some activities impose costs on third parties, others yield benefits. 
Consider education. To a large extent, the benefit of education is private. Put in 
strictly monetary terms, the consumers of education become more productive work￾ers and reap much of the benefit in the form of higher wages. In addition, education 
helps people become more well-rounded by broadening their horizons. Beyond 
these private benefits, however, education also yields positive externalities. One 
is that a more educated population leads to more informed voters, which means 
better government for everyone. Another is that a more educated population tends 
to result in lower crime rates. A third is that a more educated population may 
encourage the development and dissemination of technological advances, leading 
to higher productivity and wages for everyone. Given these positive externalities, 
people may prefer to have neighbors who are well educated. 
The analysis of positive externalities is similar to the analysis of negative exter￾nalities. As Figure 3 shows, the demand curve does not reflect the value to society of 
the good. Because the social value exceeds the private value, the social-value curve 
lies above the demand curve. The optimal quantity is found where the social-value 
curve and the supply curve intersect. The socially optimal quantity exceeds the 
quantity that the private market would reach on its own. In other words, without 
outside intervention, the market would yield too little education. 
Once again, the government can correct the market failure by inducing market 
participants to internalize the externality. The appropriate policy to deal with posi￾tive externalities is the opposite of the policy for negative externalities. To move 
the market equilibrium closer to the social optimum, a positive externality requires 
a subsidy. In fact, that is the policy the government follows: Education is heavily 
subsidized through public schools, government scholarships, and tax breaks. 
To summarize: Negative externalities lead markets to produce a larger quantity 
than is socially desirable. Positive externalities lead markets to produce a smaller 
quantity than is socially desirable. To remedy the problem, the government can 
internalize the externality by taxing goods with negative externalities and sub￾sidizing goods with positive externalities.

Technology Spillovers, Industrial Policy, and Patent Protection 
A potentially important type of positive externality is called a tech￾nology spillover—the impact of one firm’s research and production 
efforts on other firms’ access to technological advance. 
Consider the market for industrial robots. Robots are at the frontier of a rapidly 
changing technology. Whenever a firm builds one, there is some chance that it will dis￾cover a new and better design. This new design may benefit not only this firm but also 
others in society because the design enters the collective pool of technological knowl￾edge. That is, the new design may confer a positive externality on other producers. 
In this case, the government can internalize the externality by subsidizing the 
production of robots. If the government paid firms a subsidy for each robot pro￾duced, the supply curve would shift down by the amount of the subsidy, and this 
shift would increase the equilibrium quantity of robots. To ensure that the market 
equilibrium equals the social optimum, the subsidy should equal the value of the 
technology spillover. 
How large are technology spillovers, and what do they imply for public policy? 
This is an important question because technological progress is the key to raising 
living standards over time. Yet it is also a difficult question about which economists 
often disagree. 
Some economists believe that technology spillovers are pervasive and that the 
government should encourage those industries that yield the largest spillovers. For 
instance, these economists argue that if making computer chips yields greater spill￾overs than making potato chips, the government should encourage the production 
of computer chips relative to the production of potato chips. The U.S. tax code does 
this in a limited way by offering special tax breaks for expenditures on research 
and development. Some nations go further by subsidizing specific industries that 
supposedly yield large technology spillovers. Government intervention that aims 
to promote technology-enhancing industries is sometimes called industrial policy.

Cengage Learning reserves the right o remewe addiional coment o any time if subsequent nghts resmnctions require iOther economists are skeptical about industrial policy. Even if technology spill￾overs are common, pursuing an industrial policy requires the government to gauge 
the size of the spillovers from different markets. This measurement problem is difficult 
at best. Without accurate measurements, the political system may end up subsidiz￾ing industries with the most political clout rather than those with the largest positive 
externalities. And industrial policy may be pursued for reasons that have little to do 
with spillovers, such as protecting jobs that would otherwise disappear because of 
foreign competition. That may not be the most productive use of a society’s resources. 
Another way to deal with technology spillovers is patent protection. The patent 
laws protect the rights of inventors by giving them exclusive use of their inven￾tions for a limited period. When a firm makes a breakthrough and patents the idea, 
it can capture much of the economic benefit for itself. The patent internalizes the 
externality by giving the firm a property right over its invention. If others want to 
use the technology, they must obtain permission from the inventing firm and pay 
it a royalty. The system is not perfect: The royalties charged by patent holders slow 
the dissemination of new technologies. But the patent system gives firms a greater 
incentive to engage in research and other activities that advance technology. ®

10-2 Public Policies toward Externalities 
We have seen why externalities lead markets to allocate resources inefficiently but 
have mentioned only briefly how this inefficiency can be remedied. In practice, 
both public policymakers and private individuals respond to externalities in vari￾ous ways. All of the remedies share the goal of moving the allocation of resources 
closer to the social optimum. 
This section considers governmental solutions. As a general matter, the govern￾ment can respond to externalities in one of two ways. Command-and-control poli￾cies regulate behavior directly. Market-based policies provide incentives so that 
private decision makers choose to solve the problem on their own. It will come as 
no surprise that economists tend to prefer market-based policies, though command￾and-control policies are sometimes needed. 
10-2a Command-and-Control Policies: Regulation 
The government can remedy an externality by either requiring or forbidding cer￾tain behaviors. For example, it is a crime to dump poisonous chemicals into the 
water supply. In this case, the external costs to society far exceed the benefits to the 
polluter. The government therefore institutes a command-and-control policy that 
prohibits this act altogether. 
Answers are at the end of the chapter.

10% are uncertain Environmental regulations can take many forms. The EPA 
may dictate the maximum level of pollution that a factory may 
emit. Sometimes, it requires firms to adopt a particular technol￾ogy to reduce emissions. In all cases, to design good rules, the 
government regulators need to know the details about specific 
industries and about the alternative technologies that they could 
adopt. This information may be difficult for government regula￾tors to obtain. Profit-seeking industries have little reason (other 
than from a general sense of social responsibility) to share what 
they know. Rather, they often have an incentive to conceal the adverse health 
effects from their production and exaggerate the cost of moving toward cleaner 
technologies. 
10-2b Market-Based Policy 1: Corrective Taxes and Subsidies 
Instead of regulating behavior in response to an externality, the government can 
use market-based policies to align private incentives with social efficiency. For 
instance, as we saw earlier, the government can internalize the externality by tax￾ing activities with negative externalities and subsidizing activities with positive 
externalities. Taxes enacted to deal with the effects of negative externalities are 
called corrective taxes. They are also called Pigovian taxes after the economist 
Arthur Pigou (1877-1939), an early advocate of their use. An ideal corrective tax 
would equal the external cost from an activity with negative externalities, and an 
ideal corrective subsidy would equal the external benefit from an activity with 
positive externalities. 
Economists usually prefer corrective taxes to regulations as a way to deal with 
pollution because they can reduce pollution at a lower cost to society. To see why, 
consider an example. 
Suppose that two factories—a paper mill and a steel mill—are each dumping 
500 tons of “glop” into a river every year. Assume, further, that the glop from the 
two imaginary factories is identical, and that glop, while benign in small amounts, 
is dangerous in large quantities. 
The EPA wants to reduce the amount emitted. It considers two solutions: 
* Regulation: The EPA could tell each factory to reduce its pollution to 300 
tons of glop per vear. 
¢ Corrective tax: The EPA could levy a tax on each factory of $50,000 for each 
ton of glop it emits. 
The regulation would dictate a level of pollution, while the tax would give factory 
owners an incentive to reduce pollution. Which solution do you think is better?

In a case like this, most economists prefer the tax. To explain this preference, 
they would first point out that a tax is just as effective as regulation in reducing 
the overall level of many forms of pollution. The EPA can achieve whatever level 
of pollution it wants by setting the tax at the appropriate level. The higher the tax, 
the larger the reduction in pollution. If the tax is high enough, the factories will 
close altogether, reducing pollution to zero. 
Although regulation and corrective taxes are both capable of reducing many 
types of pollution, the tax accomplishes this goal more efficiently. That's because the 
regulation requires each factory to reduce pollution by the same amount, which is 
not necessarily the least expensive way to clean up the water. It is possible that the 
paper mill can reduce pollution at a lower cost than the steel mill. If so, the paper . 
mill would respond to the tax by reducing pollution substantially to avoid the tax, ~ Arthur Pigou 
while the steel mill would reduce paollution less and pay the tax. 
In essence, the corrective tax places a price on the right to pollute. This may 
seem strange if you're not accustomed to the way economists think. But just as 
markets allocate goods to those buyers who value them most, a corrective tax 
allocates pollution rights to those factories that face the highest cost of reduc￾ing it. With this flexible tool, the EPA can achieve any level of emission at the 
lowest total cost. 
Economists also argue that corrective taxes are often better for the environ￾ment. Under the command-and-control policy of regulation, the factories have 
no reason to reduce emissions further once they reach the target of 300 tons of 
glop. By contrast, the tax gives the factories an incentive to develop cleaner 
technologies because a cleaner technology would reduce the amount of taxes 
they have to pay. 
Corrective taxes differ from most other taxes. As Chapter 8 discussed, most taxes 
distort incentives and move the allocation of resources away from the social opti￾mum. The reduction in economic well-being—that is, in consumer and producer 
surplus—exceeds the amount of revenue the government raises, resulting in a 
deadweight loss. But when externalities are present, society also needs to account 
for the well-being of bystanders. Corrective taxes give market participants the 
right incentives: By internalizing an externality, these taxes move the allocation 
of resources closer to the social optimum. Corrective taxes both raise government 
revenue and enhance economic efficiency. 
Why Is Gasoline Taxed So Heavily? 
In many nations, gasoline is among the most heavily taxed goods. 
The gas tax can be viewed as a corrective tax aimed at addressing 
three negative externalities associated with driving; 
£ 0L AN STOCK PHOTD CHAOMICL 
¢ Pollution: Car emissions cause smog, which increases the risk of heart and 
lung disease. In addition, the burning of fossil fuels such as gasoline is a 
primary cause of global climate change. The gas tax reduces these adverse 
effects by discouraging gas consumption. 
* Congestion: Bumper-to-bumper traffic could be alleviated if there were 
fewer cars on the road. A gas tax keeps congestion down by encouraging 
people to take public transportation, ride bikes, carpool more often, and live 
closer to work. 
* Accidents: When people buy large cars or sport utility vehicles, they may 
make themselves safer, but they also put their neighbors at risk. A person 
driving a smaller car is much more likely to be hurt if hit by a large car or a

sport utility vehicle than if hit by another smaller car. The gas tax is an indi￾rect way of making people pay when their large, gas-guzzling vehicles put 
others at risk. It induces them to take this risk into account when choosing 
what vehicle to buy. 
Rather than causing deadweight losses like most taxes, the gas tax makes the 
economy work better. It means a clearer environment, less traffic congestion, and 
sater roads. 
How high should the tax on gasoline be? Most European countries impose 
gasoline taxes that are much higher than those in the United States. Many observ￾ers have suggested that the United States should also tax gasoline more heavily. A 
2007 study published in the Journal of Economic Literature summarized the research 
on the size of the various externalities associated with driving. It concluded that 
the optimal corrective tax on gasoline was $2.28 per gallon in 2005 dollars; after 
adjusting for inflation, that amount is equivalent to about $3.20 per gallon in 2021 
dollars. By contrast, the actual tax in the United States in 2021 was only about 55 
cents per gallon. 
The tax revenue from a higher gasoline tax could be used to lower taxes that 
distort incentives and cause deadweight losses, such as income taxes. In addition, 
the government regulations that require automakers to produce more fuel-efficient 
cars would be unnecessary, as would government subsidies to electric cars, because 
car consumers would face the right incentives. A higher gas tax, however, has never 
been politically popular. @

Returning to the paper mill and the steel mill, let’s suppose that, despite the advice 
of its economists, the EPA adopts the regulation and requires each factory to reduce 
its pollution to 300 tons of glop per year. Then one day, after the regulation is in 
place and both mills have complied, the two firms go to the EPA with a proposal. 
The steel mill wants to increase its emission of glop from 300 to 400 tons. The paper 
mill has agreed to reduce its emission from 300 to 200 tons if the steel mill pays it 
$5 million. The total emission of glop would remain at 600 tons. Should the EPA 
allow the two factories to make this deal? 
From the standpoint of economic efficiency, the answer is yes. The deal makes 
the owners of the two factories better off. After all, they are voluntarily agreeing to 
it. Moreover, the deal does not have any external effects because the total amount 
of pollution stays the same. Thus, social welfare is enhanced by allowing the paper 
mill to sell its pollution rights to the steel mill. 
The same logic applies to any voluntary transfer of the right to pollute from 
one firm to another. When the EPA allows firms to make such deals, in essence, 
it creates a new scarce resource: pollution permits. A market to trade these 
permits develops, and that market is governed by the forces of supply and 
demand. The invisible hand ensures that this new market allocates the right to 
pollute efficiently. That is, the permits will end up in the hands of those who 
value them most, as judged by their willingness to pay. A firm’s willingness 
to pay for the right to pollute, in turn, will depend on its cost of reducing pol￾lution: The more costly it is for a firm to cut back on pollution, the more it will 
be willing to pay for a permit. 
An advantage of allowing a market for pollution permits is that the initial alloca￾tion of the permits among firms does not matter from the standpoint of economic 
efficiency. Those firms that can reduce pollution at a low cost will sell whatever 
permits they get, while firms that can reduce pollution only at a high cost will buy 
whatever permits they need. If there is a market for the permits, the final allocation 
will be efficient regardless of the initial allocation. 
Pollution permits may seem very different from corrective taxes, but the two 
policies have much in common. In both cases, firms pay for their pollution. With 
corrective taxes, polluting firms must pay a tax to the government. With pollution 
permits, polluting firms must buy the permits. (Even firms that already own per￾mits must pay to pollute, in the sense that they could have sold their permits on the 
open market, and, by foregoing that revenue, they incur an opportunity cost.) In 
the language of economics, both corrective taxes and pollution permits internalize 
the externality of pellution by making it costly for firms to pollute. 
The similarity of the two policies can be seen by considering the market for pol￾lution rights. Both panels in Figure 4 show the demand curve for the permission 
to pollute. This curve shows that the lower the price of polluting, the more firms 
will pollute. In panel (a), the EPA uses a corrective tax to set a price for pollution. 
In this case, the supply curve for pollution rights is perfectly elastic (because firms 
can pollute as much as they want by paying the tax), and the demand curve deter￾mines the quantity of pollution. In panel (b), the EPA sets a quantity of pollution 
by issuing permits. In this case, the supply curve for pollution rights is perfectly 
inelastic (because the quantity of pollution is fixed by the number of permits), and 
the demand curve determines the price. The EPA can achieve any point on the 
demand curve either by setting a price with a corrective tax or by setting a quantity 
with pollution permits.

The Equivalence of Corrective 
Taxes and Pollution Permits 
In panel (a), the EPA sets a price on pollution by levying a corrective tax, and the 
demand curve determines the quantity of pollution. In panel (b}, the EPA limits the 
quantity of pollution by limiting the number of pollution permits, and the demand curve 
determines the price of pollution. The price and guantity of pollution are the same in the 
two cases.

Pollution Pollution 
The choice between selling pollution permits and levying a corrective tax 
starts to matter, however, if the demand curve for pollution rights is uncertain. 
Suppose the EPA wants no more than 600 tons of glop dumped into the river, 
but because the EPA does not know the demand curve, it is not sure what size 
tax would hit that target. In this case, it can auction off 600 pollution permits. 
The auction price would, in effect, yield the corrective tax needed to achieve 
the EPA’s goal. On the other hand, suppose the EPA knows the external cost of 
pollution is $50,000 per ton of glop but is uncertain how much glop factories 
would emit at that price. In this case, the EPA can reach the efficient outcome 
by setting a corrective tax of $50,000 per ton and letting the market determine 
the quantity of pollution. 
The idea of the government auctioning off the right to pollute may at first sound 
like a creature of some economist’s imagination. And, in fact, that is how the idea 
began. But increasingly, the EPA has used this system to control pollution. A notable 
success story has been the case of sulfur dioxide (50,), a leading cause of acid rain. 
In 1990, amendments to the Clean Air Act reqmri:d power plants to reduce 50O, 
emissions substantially. At the same time, the amendments set up a system that 
allowed plants to trade their SO, allowances. Initially, both industry representatives 
and environmentalists were ski_'ptical of the proposal, but over time, the system 
reduced pollution with minimal disruption and at a low cost. Pollution permits, 
like corrective taxes, are now widely viewed as a cost-effective way to keep the 
environment clean.

“We cannot give anyone the option of polluting for a fee.” This comment from 
Senator Edmund Muskie during the struggle to enact the 1972 Clean Water Act 
still reflects the view of some environmentalists. In 1969, the Cuyahoga River in 
Cleveland was so thick with industrial pollutants that it actually caught fire—a 
recurring problem that the legislation helped solve. Clean air and water were seen 
as fundamental human rights that had been despoiled. Remembering those days, 
many environmentalists say that economics is, at best, a secondary concern and, 
in some respects, a repugnant one. If clean air and water are priceless—part of 
the inheritance of every human—what kind of person would try to put a price on 
them? The environment is so important, some say, that protecting it is an absolute 
priority, regardless of cost. 
Many modern economists are environmentalists and are committed to achiev￾ing clean air and water and ending global climate change, yet they view these 
public issues through a different lens. To economists, good environmental policy 
starts by acknowledging the first of the Ten Principles of Economics in Chapter 1: 
People face trade-offs. The value of environmental measures must be compared 
with their opportunity cost—that is, with what one must give up to obtain 
them. Eliminating all pollution is, sadly, impossible. Trying to eliminate all 
pollution is a lofty goal but not a feasible one—at least not in the foreseeable 
future—without reversing many of the technological advances that allow us to 
enjoy a high standard of living. Few people would be willing to accept poor 
nutrition, inadequate health care, or shoddy housing to make the environment 
as clean as possible. 
The cause of environmentalism is arguably best advanced by thinking like 
an economist. A clean environment can be viewed as another good—one with 
tremendous value. Like all normal goods, it has a positive income elasticity: Rich 
countries can afford a cleaner environment than poor ones and usually have more 
rigorous environmental protection. In addition, like most other goods, clean air 
and water obey the law of demand: The lower the price of environmental protec￾tion, the more of it the public will want. When the economic approach of using 
corrective taxes and pollution permits reduces the cost of attaining clean air and 
water, it should increase the amount of environmental protection that the public 
demands. 
Climate Change and Carbon Taxes 
Scientists tell us that human carbon emissions are a cause of global 
climate change, which in turn has various harmful effects. This is a 
classic example of a negative externality. 
Suppose a concerned citizen—Ilet's call him Yoram—wants to reduce his carbon 
footprint. How might he do it? 
Yoram could buy a more fuel-efficient car, like a hybrid or an electric vehicle. 
Yoram could carpool to work. 
Yoram could use public transportation more often. 
Yoram could move closer to his job. 
e Yoram could buy a smaller house that requires less energy to heat and cool. 
Yoram could adjust the thermostat to keep his home cooler in the winter and 
warmer in the summer. 
¢ Yoram could put solar panels on his roof.

By now, you get the idea. Every day, we all make lifestyle 
choices that affect how much carbon is emitted. These decisions 
are personal, but they have a global impact. 
The main question for policymakers is how society can 
ensure that people make the right decisions, which take into 
account both the personal impact of their actions and the exter￾nalities. There are three approaches. 
One approach is to appeal to individuals’ sense of social 
responsibility. Some people may, in fact, reduce their carbon 
footprint to the optimal level out of concern for the planet. But 
expecting most people to act this way is unrealistic. Life is busy, 
people have their own priorities, and even knowing the global 
impact of one’s own actions is a daunting task. 
The second approach is to use government regulation to 
change the decisions that people make. An example is Corporate 
Average Fuel Economy, or CAFE, standards, which regulate car 
emissions in the United States. 
But this regulatory approach is fraught with problems. One 
is that it creates tension between the products that consumers 
want to buy and the products that companies are allowed to 
sell. Robert A. Lutz, a former top auto executive, laments that 
CAFE standards are “a huge bureaucratic nightmare.” He says, 
“CAFE is like trying to cure obesity by requiring clothing manu￾facturers to make smaller sizes.” 
A more important problem with such regulations is that they 
can influence only a few crucial decisions. The government can 
regulate the kind of car that Yoram finds at auto dealers, but it 
can't easily regulate how close Yoram lives to work or whether 
he carpools with his neighbor. Yet reducing carbon emissions at 
minimum cost requires a policy that encompasses all possible 
margins of adjustment. 
Fortunately, a policy broader in scope is possible, which 
brings us to the third approach to dealing with climate exter￾nalities: putting a price on carbon emissions. This can be done 
either by taxing them or by creating a “cap-and-trade” system 
of tradable pollution permits. If sellers of gasoline, electricity, 
beef, and so on had to pay a fee for each emission of carbon 
implicit in their products, that fee would be built into their 
prices. When making everyday decisions, Yoram and other 
consumers would look at the prices they face and, in effect, 
take into account the global impact of their choices. A price on 
carbon would internalize the externality. It has worked effectively in Europe, 
though it hasn’t caught on in the United States. 
But carbon taxes are a popular policy among economists, as the nearby “Ask 
the Experts” box shows. @

10-3 Private Solutions to Externalities 
Externalities tend to make market outcomes inefficient, but government action isn't 
the only remedy. Sometimes, people can find private solutions. 
10-3a The Types of Private Solutions 
Moral codes and social sanctions can solve the problem of externalities. Consider, 
for instance, why most people do not litter. There are laws against littering, but they 
are not rigorously enforced. Most people don't litter just because it is the wrong 
thing to do. The Golden Rule taught to many children says, “Do unto others as you 
would have them do unto you.” This moral injunction tells us to consider how our 
actions affect other people. In the less poetic language of economics, it tells us to 
internalize externalities. 
Another private solution involves charities. For example, the Sierra Club is a non￾profit organization funded by private donors who seek to protect the environment. 
Colleges and universities receive gifts from alumni, corporations, and foundations 
in part because education has great benefits—positive externalitiecs—for society. 
The government encourages these private solutions by allowing an income tax 
deduction for charitable donations. 
The private market can often solve the problem of externalities by relying on 
the self-interest of the relevant parties. Sometimes, the solution takes the form of 
integrating different types of businesses. For example, consider an apple grower 
and a beekeeper who are located next to each other. Each business benefits the 
other, conveying a positive externality: By pollinating the flowers on the trees, the 
bees help the orchard produce apples, while the bees use the nectar from the apple 
trees to produce honey. But that doesn’t mean that the two take these benefits into 
account. When the apple grower decides how many trees to plant and the beekeeper 
determines how many bees to keep, they neglect the positive externality. As a result, 
the apple grower plants too few trees, and the beekeeper keeps too few bees. These 
d. knowledge about the cost of pollution abatement 
is dispersed and hard to obtain. 
Answers are at the end of the chapter.

Coase theorem 
the proposition that 
if private parties can 
bargain without cost 
over the allocation of 
resources, they can solve 
the problem of external￾ities on their own 
externalities could be internalized if the bee and apple businesses merged: Both 
activities would then take place within the same firm, which could choose the opti￾mal number of trees and bees. Internalizing externalities is one reason that some 
firms are involved in multiple types of businesses. 
Another private approach is for the apple grower and beckeeper to negotiate a 
contract, setting the right number of trees and bees and perhaps a payment from 
one party to the other. The contract can solve the inefficiency that normally arises 
from these externalities and make both parties better off. 
10-3b The Coase Theorem 
How effective is the private market in dealing with externalities? A famous result, 
called the Coase theorem after the economist Ronald Coase, suggests that it 
can be very effective in some circumstances. According to the Coase theorem, 
if private parties can bargain over the allocation of resources at no cost, then 
the private market will always solve the problem of externalities and allocate 
resources efficiently. 
To see how the Coase theorem works, consider an example. Suppose that 
Emily owns a dog named Clifford. Clifford barks and disturbs Horace, Emily’s 
neighbor. Emily benefits greatly from Clifford’s companionship, but the dog con￾fers a negative externality on Horace, who would prefer a sound sleep. Should 
Emily find Clifford a new home, or should Horace suffer restless nights because 
of Clifford’s barking? 
Consider first what outcome is socially efficient. An economist with society’s 
interest at heart would compare the benefit that Emily gets from the dog with the 
cost that Horace bears from the barking,. If the benefit exceeds the cost, it is efficient 
for Emily to keep the dog and for Horace to live with the barking. Yet if the cost 
exceeds the benefit, then Emily should get rid of the dog. 
According to the Coase theorem, the private market will reach the efficient out￾come on its own. How? Horace can offer to pay Emily to move Clifford to a new 
home. Emily will accept the deal if the amount of money Horace offers is greater 
than her benefit of keeping the dog. 
By bargaining over the price, Emily and Horace can always reach the efficient 
outcome. For instance, suppose that Emily gets a $1,000 benefit from the dog and 
Horace bears a $1,500 cost from the barking. In this case, Horace can offer Emily 
$1,200 to get rid of the dog, and Emily will accept. Both parties are better off than 
they were before, and the efficient cutcome is reached. 
It is possible, of course, that Horace would not be willing to offer any price that 
Emily would accept. For instance, suppose that Emily gets a $3,000 benefit from 
the dog and Horace bears a $1,500 cost from the barking,. In this case, Emily would 
turn down any offer below $3,000, while Horace would not offer any amount above 
$1,500. Emily ends up keeping Clifford. Given these costs and benefits, this outcome 
is efficient. 
These examples so far assume that Emily has the legal right to keep a barking 
dog. In other words, Emily can keep Clifford unless Horace pays her enough to 
induce her to give up the dog voluntarily. But how different would the outcome be 
if Horace had the legal right to peace and quiel? 
According to the Coase theorem, the initial distribution of rights does not matter 
for the market’s ability to reach the efficient outcome. For instance, suppose that 
Horace can legally compel Emily to get rid of the dog. Having this right works to 
Horace’s advantage, but it probably won't change the outcome. In this case, Emily 
can offer to pay Horace to allow her to keep the dog. If the benefit of the dog to

Cengage Learning reserves the right o remewe addiional coment o any time if ssbseqeent nghts renmnctions require iEmily exceeds the cost of the barking to Horace, then Emily and Horace will strike 
a bargain in which Emily gets to keep her dog,. 
Although Emily and Horace can reach the efficient outcome regardless of how 
rights are initially distributed, the distribution of rights is not irrelevant: It deter￾mines the distribution of economic well-being. Whether Emily has the right to a 
barking dog or Horace the right to peace and quiet determines who pays whom 
in the final bargain. But in either case, the two parties can bargain with each other 
and solve the externality problem. Emily will end up keeping Clifford only if her 
benefit exceeds Horace's cost. 
To sum up: The Coase theorem says that private economic actors can potentially 
solve the problem of externalities among themselves. Whatever the initial dis￾tribution of rights, the interested parties can reach a bargain in which everyone 
is better off and the outcome is efficient. 
10-3¢ Why Private Solutions Do Not Always Work 
Despite the appealing logic of the Coase theorem, private individuals on their 
own often fail to resolve the problems caused by externalities. The Coase theorem 
applies only when the interested parties have no trouble reaching and enforcing 
an agreement. In the real world, however, bargaining does not always work, even 
when a mutually beneficial agreement is possible. 
Sometimes, the interested parties fail to solve an externality problem because 
of transaction costs, the costs that parties incur in the process of agreeing to and 
following through on a bargain. In our example, imagine that Emily and Horace 
speak different languages so, to reach an agreement, they need to hire a translator. 
If the benefit of solving the barking problem is less than the cost of the translator, 
Emily and Horace might choose to leave the problem unsolved. In more realistic 
examples, the transaction costs are the expenses not of translators but of lawyers 
required to draft and enforce contracts. 
At other times, bargaining simply breaks down. The recurrence of wars and 
labor strikes shows that reaching an agreement can be difficult and that failing to 
reach one can be costly. The problem is often that each party tries to hold out for 
a better deal. For example, suppose that Emily gets a $1,000 benefit from having 
Clifford, while Horace bears a $1,500 cost from the barking. Although it is efficient 
for Horace to pay Emily to find another home for the dog, there are many prices 
that could lead to this outcome. Emily might demand 51,400, and Horace might 
offer only $1,100. As they haggle over the price, the inefficient outcome with the 
barking dog persists. 
Reaching an efficient bargain is especially difficult when the number of interested 
parties is large because coordinating everyone is costly. For example, consider a 
factory that pollutes the water of a nearby lake. The pollution confers a negative 
externality on the local fishermen. According to the Coase theorem, if the pollution 
is inefficient, then the factory and the fishermen could reach a bargain in which 
the fishermen pay the factory not to pollute. If there are many fishermen, however, 
trying to coordinate them all to bargain with the factory may be almost impossible. 
Combating global climate change is similar: There are far too many people and firms 
responsible for greenhouse gas emissions for them to be able to bargain together 
and come up with a worldwide solution. 
When private bargaining does not work, governments can sometimes play a role. 
A government is an institution designed for collective action. In the example of the 
lake, the government can act on behalf of the fishermen, even when it is impractical 
for the fishermen to act for themselves.

| bring this up because of a dispute you may

flight fram Newark to Denver made an unscheduled 
stop in Chicago to discharge two passengers who 
had a dispute over seat reclining. Accarding to The 
Associated Press, a man ina middle seat installed 
the Knee Defender, a $21.95 device that keeps 
a seat upright, on the seatback in front of him. 
Aflight attendant asked him to remove the 
device. He refused. The woman seated in front

The pilot landed the plane and booted both 
passengers off the flight. 
Obviously, it's improper to throw water 
at another passenger on a flight, even if he 
deserves it. But I've seen a distressing amount 
of sympathy for Mr. Knee Defender, who wasn't 
just instigating a fight but usurping his fellow 
passenger's praperty rights. When you buy an 
airline ticket, one of the things you're buying is 
the right to use your seat’s reclining function. If

10-4 Conclusion 
The invisible hand is powerful but not omnipotent. A market’s equilibrium maxi￾mizes the sum of producer and consumer surplus. When the buyers and sellers in 
the market are the only interested parties, this outcome is efficient from the stand￾point of society. But when there are external effects, such as pollution, evaluating 
a market outcome requires accounting for the well-being of third parties. In this 
case, the invisible hand of the marketplace may fail to allocate resources efficiently. 
In some cases, people can solve the problem of externalities on their own. The Coase 
theorem suggests that the interested parties can bargain among themselves and agree 
on an efficient solution. Sometimes, however, an efficient outcome cannot be reached, 
perhaps because the large number of interested parties makes bargaining difficult.

Donald Marron, a former director of the 
Congressional Budget Office, agrees with this 
analysis, but with a caveat. Recline nego￾tiations do involve some transaction costs— 
passengers don't like bargaining over reclining 
positions with their neighbors, perhaps because 
that sometimes ends with water being thrown 
in someone's face. 
Mr. Marron says we ought to allocate the 
initial property right to the person likely to 
care most about reclining, in order to reduce 
the number of transactions that are neces￾sary. He further argues that it’s probably the 
person sitting behind, as evidenced by the 
fact people routinely pay for extra-legroom

When people cannot solve the problem of externalities privately, the govern￾ment often steps in. Yet even with government intervention, society can benefit 
by harnessing—rather than circumventing—market forces. The government can 
require market participants to bear the full costs of their actions. Corrective taxes 
on emissions and pollution permits, for instance, are both designed to internalize 
the externality of pollution. These are increasingly the policies of choice for those 
interested in protecting the environment. Market forces, properly redirected, are 
often the best remedy for market failure. 
Chapter in a Nutshell 
* When a transaction between a buyer and seller directly of this policy is similar to imposing corrective taxes on 
affects a third party, the effect is called an external￾ity. If an activity yields negative externalities, such as 
pollution, the socially optimal quantity in a market is 
less than the equilibrium quantity. If an activity yields 
positive externalities, such as technology spillovers, the 
socially optimal quantity is greater than the equilibrium 
quantity. 
Government can remedy the inefficiencies caused by 
externalities. Sometimes, it regulates behavior. Other 
times, it internalizes an externality using corrective 
taxes. Another policy is to issue permits. For example, 
the government could protect the environment by issu￾ing a limited number of pollution permits. The result 
polluters. 
Those affected by externalities can sometimes solve 
the problem privately. For instance, when one business 
imposes an externality on another business, the two 
businesses can internalize the externality by merging. 
Alternatively, the interested parties can solve the prob￾lem by negotiating a contract. According to the Coase 
theorem, if people can bargain without cost, they can 
reach an agreement in which resources are allocated 
efficiently. In many cases, however, reaching a bargain 
among the many interested parties is difficult, so the 
Coase theorem does not apply.

Problems and Applications 
1. Consider two ways to protect your car from theft. 
The Club (a steering wheel lock) makes it difficult for 
a car thief to take your car. Lojack (a tracking system) 
makes it easier for the police to catch the car thief 
who has stolen it. Which of these methods confers 
a negative externality on other car owners? Which 
confers a positive externality? Do vou think there are 
any policy implications of your analysis?

consumption 
How well do markets work in providing people with what they want? The answer 
depends on the good being considered. Chapters 4 and 7 showed that for ice-cream 
cones, markets work efficiently: The price of ice-cream cones adjusts to balance 
supply and demand, and this equilibrium maximizes the sum of producer and 
consumer surplus. Yet Chapter 10 showed that the market cannot be counted on 
to produce such fine results in all cases. For example, the market on its own can’t 
prevent steel manufacturers from polluting the air we breathe. Buyers and sellers of 
steel typically don't take into account the external effects of their decisions. Markets 
work well for ice cream but not for clean air. 
When thinking about the ability of markets to efficiently allocate the economy’s 
resources, it helps to classify goods more systematically. As we will see with some 
examples, two characteristics are most important: 
* Excludability. If people can be prevented from using a good, it is exclud￾able. If it is impossible to prevent people from using the good, it is not 
excludable. 
e Rivalry in consumption. If one person’s use of a unit of a good reduces 
another person’s ability to use it, the good is rival in consumption. If one 
person’s use does not diminish another person’s use, the good is not rival in 
consumption. 
On a grid, these two characteristics define four categories, shown in Figure 1: 
1. Private goods are both excludable and rival in consumption. An ice-cream 
cone, for instance, is excludable because it is possible to prevent someone 
from eating one—you just don’t give it to her. It is also rival in consump￾tion because if one person eats an ice-cream cone, another person cannot 
cat the same cone. 
Most goods in the economy are private goods like ice-cream cones: You 
don't get one unless you pay for it, and once you have it, you are the only 
person who benefits. When we analyzed supply and demand in Chapters 4,

5, and 6 and the efficiency of markets in Chapters 7, 8, and 9, we implicitly 
assumed that goods were both excludable and rival in consumption. 
2. Public goods are neither excludable nor rival in consumption. They aren‘t 
excludable because people cannot be prevented from using a public good, 
and they aren’t rival because one person’s use does not reduce another per￾son's ability to use it. 
An example is a tornado siren in a small town. Once the siren sounds, it is 
impossible to prevent a person from hearing it, so it is not excludable. And 
when one person gets the benefit of the warning, that does not reduce the 
benefit to others, so the siren is not rival in consumption. 
3. Common resources are rival in consumption but not excludable. Consider 
fish in the ocean. They are rival in consumption because when one person 
catches fish, fewer fish are left for the next person. Fish are not excludable 
because it is hard to stop fishermen from taking fish out of a vast ocean. 
4. Club goods are excludable but not rival in consumption. An example is 
satellite TV. If you don’t pay your bill, the company can cut you off, making 
the good excludable. But your use of the satellite signal does not diminish 
anyone else’s ability to use it, so the service is not rival in consumption. 
(We will later return to club goods and see that they are a type of a natural 
monopoly.) 
Figure 1 separates goods into four distinct categories. That's helpful in thinking 
about these categories, but it is not completely realistic because the boundaries can 
be fuzzy. Whether goods are excludable or rival in consumption is often a matter of 
degree. Fish in an ocean may not be excludable because monitoring fishing every￾where is so hard, but a large enough coast guard could make fish partly excludable, 
at least in some sections of the ocean. Similarly, although fish are generally rival in 
consumption, this would be less true if the number of fishermen were small relative to 
the number of fish. (Think of North America before the arrival of European settlers.) 
Despite this fuzziness, however, it is useful to group goods into these four categories. 
This chapter examines goods that are not excludable: public goods and common 
resources. Because people cannot be prevented from using them, these goods are 
available to everyone free of charge. But when something of value has no price 
attached to it, externalities arise. For example, if a private individual were to provide 
a public good, such as a tornado siren, other people would be better off. They would 
receive a benefit without paying for it—a positive externality. Similarly, when one 
person uses a common resource like fish in the ocean, other people are worse off 
because there are fewer fish to catch, yet they are not compensated for their loss. This 
is an externality too, but a negative one. Because of these external effects, private 
decisions about consumption and production can lead to an inefficient allocation 
of resources unless the government policy steps in to fix the problem.

11-2 Public Goods 
free rider 
a person who receives 
the benefit of a good but 
avoids paying for it 
To understand how public goods differ from other goods and why they present 
problems for society, consider a fireworks display. It isn’t excludable: Anyone 
can look up at the sky and see it. And it's not rival in consumption: My joy at the 
sight of a chrysanthemum exploding above me doesn’t diminish your pleasure 
at seeing it. 
11-2a The Free-Rider Problem 
The citizens of Smalltown, U.S. A, love fireworks on the Fourth of July. Each of 
the town’s 500 residents places a $10 value on this experience for a total benefit 
of $5,000. The cost of putting on the display is $1,000. Because the 55,000 benefit 
exceeds the $1,000 cost, it is efficient for Smalltown residents to enjoy Fourth of 
July fireworks. 
Would the private market produce this outcome? Probably not. Imagine 
that Zoe, a Smalltown entrepreneur, decided to put on a fireworks display. Zoe 
would have trouble selling tickets because potential customers would realize 
that they could see the fireworks without a ticket. Because fireworks are not 
excludable, it is easy to be a free rider—the term for a person who receives 
the benefit of a good without paying for it. If most people would choose to 
be free riders rather than ticket buyers, the market would fail to provide the 
efficient outcome. 
This market failure can be viewed as arising from an externality. If Zoe puts 
on the fireworks display, she confers an external benefit on those who see it 
without paying for it. When deciding whether to put on the display, however, 
Zoe does not take the external benefits into account. Zoe isn’t a philanthropist. 
Even though the fireworks display is socially desirable, it is not profitable, so 
Zoe makes the privately rational but socially inefficient decision not to put on 
the display. 
Although the private market fails to supply the fireworks display Smalltown 
residents want, the solution to Smalltown’s problem is obvious: The local govern￾ment can sponsor a Fourth of July celebration. The town council can raise everyone’s 
taxes by 52 and hire Zoe to produce the fireworks. Everyone in Smalltown is better 
off by $8—the $10 at which residents value the fireworks minus the $2 tax bill. Zoe 
can help Smalltown reach the efficient outcome as a public employee even though 
she could not do so as a private entrepreneur. 
This story of Smalltown's government-sponsored fireworks is simplified but 
realistic. In fact, many local governments in the United States pay for fireworks 
on the Fourth of July. More importantly, the story shows a general lesson: Because 
public goods are not excludable, the free-rider problem often prevents the private 
market from supplying them. The government, however, can remedy the problem. 
If the government decides that the total benefits of a public good exceed its costs, 
it can provide the public good, pay for it with tax revenue, and potentially make 
everyone better off. 
11-2b Some Important Public Goods 
There are many examples of public goods. Here are three of the most critical. 
National Defense The defense of a country from foreign aggressors is a classic 
example of a public good. Once a country has paid for a military to defend it, it 
is impossible to prevent a person in the country from enjoying the benefit of this

defense. And when one person enjoys the benefit of national defense, she 
does not reduce the benefit to anyone else. National defense is neither 
excludable nor rival in consumption. 
National defense is also one of the most expensive public goods. In 
2020, the U.S. federal government spent a total of 5886 billion on national 
defense, or $2,682 per person. People debate whether this amount is 
too small or too large and whether all military spending actually makes 
us safer, but few doubt that some government spending for national 
defense is necessary. Even economists who advocate small govern￾ment agree that national defense is a public good the government must 
provide. 
DANA FRADDN,THE NEW YORKER 
COLLECTIOM/THE CARTOOM BANEK 
“I like the concept if we can do 
it with no new taxes.” 
Basic Research Research increases knowledge about many things. When evalu￾ating the public policy toward research, it is important to distinguish general 
knowledge from specific technological knowledge, like the invention of a longer￾lived battery, a smaller microchip, or a better digital music player. This kind of 
knowledge can be patented. The patent gives the inventor the exclusive right to 
the creation for a limited period. Anyone else who wants to use it must pay the 
inventor for the right to do so. In other words, the patent makes the inventor’s 
work excludable. 
By contrast, general knowledge is a public good. For example, a mathematician 
cannot patent a theorem. Once proven, the knowledge is not excludable: The theo￾rem enters the collective pool of knowledge that anyone can use without charge. 
The theorem is also not rival in consumption: One person’s use of the theorem does 
not prevent any other person from using it. 
Profit-seeking firms spend a lot on research to develop products they can 
patent and sell, but most don’t spend much on basic research. Their incentive, 
instead, is to free ride on the general knowledge created by others. As a result, 
in the absence of any public policy, society would devote too few resources to 
creating knowledge. 
The government tries to provide the public good of general knowledge in 
various ways. Government agencies, such as the National Institutes of Health 
and the National Science Foundation, subsidize basic research in medicine, math￾ematics, physics, chemistry, biology, and even economics. Some people justify 
government funding of the space program on the grounds that it adds to the 
pool of knowledge. Determining the appropriate level of government support is 
difficult because the benefits are hard to measure, and the members of Congress 
who appropriate funds usually don’t have the expertise necessary to judge what 
lines of research are likely to produce the largest benefits. So, while basic research 
is surely a public good, the public sector often won't allocate the right amount 
of funds for the right kinds of research. 
Fighting Poverty Many government programs aim to help people who are 
economically disadvantaged. TANF (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, 
sometimes called welfare) provides temporary income support for poor families 
with children. SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly 
called foods stamps) subsidizes food purchases for low-income households, 
and Medicaid provides them with medical care. The EITC (Earned Income 
Tax Credit) provides tax rebates for those who work at low-wage jobs. These 
and other antipoverty programs are financed by taxes on people with higher 
incomes.

What kind of good is this? 
Economists debate what role the government should play in fighting poverty. 
For now, note an important argument: Advocates of antipoverty programs some￾times claim that fighting poverty is a public good. Even if everyone prefers living 
in a society without poverty, fighting poverty is not a “good” that private actions 
will adequately provide. 
To see why, suppose someone tried to organize a group of wealthy individuals 
to try to eliminate poverty. They would be providing a public good. This good 
would not be rival in consumption: One person’s enjovment of living in a society 
without poverty would not reduce anyone else’s enjoyment of it. The good would 
not be excludable: Once poverty is eliminated, no one can be prevented from taking 
pleasure in this fact. As a result, there would be a tendency for people to free ride 
on the generosity of others, enjoying the benefits of poverty elimination without 
contributing to the cause. 
Because of the free-rider problem, fighting poverty through private charity will 
probably not be sufficient. Yet government action can solve this problem. Taxing 
the wealthy to raise the living standards of the poor can potentially make everyone 
better off. The poor are better off because they now enjoy a higher standard of liv￾ing, and those paying the taxes are better off because they enjoy living in a society 
with less poverty. 
Are Lighthouses Public Goods? 
Some goods can switch between being public and private goods 
depending on the circumstances. For example, a fireworks display is 
a public good in a town with many residents. Yet if performed at Walt 
Disney World, a fireworks display is more like a private good 
because visitors to the park pay for admission. 
Lighthouses have long been used as examples of public goods. 
They mark specific locations along the coast so passing ships can 
avold treacherous waters. The benefit that a lighthouse provides 
to ship captains is neither excludable nor rival in consumption, so 
each captain has an incentive to free ride by using the lighthouse 
to navigate without paying for the service. Because of this free￾rider problem, private markets usually fail to provide the light￾houses that captains need. As a result, most lighthouses today are 
operated by the government. 
In some cases, however, lighthouses have been closer to 
private goods. On the coast of England in the 19th century, for 
example, some lighthouses were privately owned and operated. 
Instead of trying to charge ship captains for the service, however, 
the owner of the lighthouse charged the owner of the nearby 
port. If the port owner did not pay, the lighthouse owner turned 
off the light, and ships avoided that port. 
To decide whether something is a public good, determine 
who benefits and whether they can be excluded from using 
the good. A free-rider problem arises when the beneficiaries 
are numerous and exclusion of any one of them is impossible. 
If a lighthouse benefits many ship captains, it is a public 
good. If it primarily benefits a single port owner, it is more 
like a private good. @

11-2¢ The Difficult Job of Cost-Benefit Analysis 
So far, we have seen that the government provides public goods because the private 
market on its own will not produce an efficient quantity. Yet deciding that the gov￾ernment must play a role is only the first step. The government must then determine 
what kinds of public goods to provide and in what quantities. 
Suppose that the government is considering a public project, such as building a 
new highway. To judge whether to go ahead, the government compares the benefits 
tor all those who would use it with the costs of building and maintaining it. A team 
of economists and engineers might conduct a study, called a cost-benefit analysis, cost-benefit analysis 
to estimate the total costs and benefits of the project to society as a whole. a study that compares 
Cost-benefit analysts have a tough job. Because the highway will be available the costs and benefits 
to everyone free of charge, there is no price with which to judge its value. Simply to society of providing a 
asking people how much they would value the highway is not reliable: Quantifying public good 
benefits is difficult using the results from a questionnaire, and respondents have 
little incentive to tell the truth. Those who would use the highway have an incentive 
to exaggerate the benefit they receive to get it built. Those who would be harmed 
have an incentive to exaggerate the costs so they can stop the project. 
The efficient provision of public goods is, therefore, intrinsically more difficult 
than it is for private goods. When buyers of a private good enter a market, they 
reveal the value they place on the good through the prices they are willing to pay. 
At the same time, sellers reveal their costs with the prices they are willing to accept. 
The equilibrium is an efficient allocation of resources because it reflects all this 
information. By contrast, cost-benefit analysts do not have price signals to observe 
when evaluating whether the government should provide a public good and how 
much to provide. Their findings on the costs and benefits of public projects are 
rough approximations at best. 
How Much Is a Life Worth? 
Imagine that you have been elected to serve as a member of your 
local town council. The town engineer comes to you with a proposal: 
The town can spend $10,000 to install and operate a traffic light at an 
intersection that now has only a stop sign. The benefit of the tratfic light is increased 
safety. Based on data from similar intersections, the engineer estimates that the traf￾fic light would reduce the risk of a fatal accident over the lifetime of the traffic light 
from 1.6 to 1.1 percent. Should you spend the money for the new light? 
To answer this question, you turn to cost-benefit analysis. But you quickly run 
into an obstacle: The costs and benefits must be measured in the same units if 
you are to compare them meaningfully. The cost is measured in dollars, but the 
benefit—the possibility of saving a person’s life—is not directly monetary. To make 
your decision, you have to put a dollar value on a human life. 
At first, you may say that a human life is priceless. After all, there is probably no 
amount of money that would induce you to give up your life or that of a loved one. 
This suggests that a human life has an infinite dollar value. 
In cost-benefit analysis, however, this answer leads to nonsensical results. If we 
place an infinite value on human life, we should place traffic lights on every street 
corner, and we should all drive large cars loaded with the latest safety features. Yet 
traffic lights are not at every corner, and people sometimes choose to pay less for 
smaller cars without safety options such as side-impact airbags or antilock brakes. 
In both public and private decisions, people sometimes take risks to save money.

Once we have accepted the idea that a person’s life has an implicit dollar value, 
how can we determine what that value is? One approach, sometimes used by courts 
to award damages in wrongful-death suits, is to look at the total amount that a 
person would have earned. Economists are often critical of this approach because it 
ignores other opportunity costs of losing one’s lite. It bizarrely implies that the life 
of a person who does not work has no value. 
A better way to value human life is to look at the risks that people are voluntarily 
willing to take and how much they must be paid for taking them. For example, 
mortality risk varies across jobs. Construction workers in high-rise buildings face 
a greater risk of death on the job than office workers do. By comparing wages in 
risky and less risky occupations, controlling for education, experience, and other 
determinants of wages, economists can get some sense about what value people put 
on their own lives. Studies using this approach conclude that the value of a human 
life is about $10 million. 
You can now respond to the town engineer. Because the traffic light reduces the 
risk of fatality by (.5 percentage points, the expected benefit from installing the traf￾fic light is 0.005 > $10 million, or $50,000. This estimate of the benefit exceeds the 
cost of $10,000, so you should approve the project. ®

11-3 Common Resources 
Tragedy of the 
Commons 
a parable that illustrates 
why common resources 
are used more than 
is desirable from the 
standpoint of society as 
a whole 
Common resources, like public goods, are not excludable: They are available free of 
charge to anyone who wants to use them. Common resources are, however, rival in 
consumption: One person’s use of the common resource reduces other people’s abil￾ity to use it. Thus, common resources give rise to a new problem: Once the good is 
provided, policymakers need to be concerned about how much it is used. This prob￾lem is best understood from a classic parable called the Tragedy of the Commons. 
11-3a The Tragedy of the Commons 
Of the many economic activities that take place in a small medieval town, one of 
the most important is raising sheep. Many families own flocks of sheep and support 
themselves by selling wool, which is used to make clothing,.

As our story begins, the sheep spend much of their time grazing on the land sur￾rounding the town, called the Town Commons. No family owns the land. Instead, 
the town residents own it collectively, and all the residents are allowed to graze 
their sheep on it. Collective ownership works well because land is plentiful. As 
long as everyone can get all the good grazing land they want, the Town Commons 
is not rival in consumption, and allowing residents’ sheep to graze for free causes 
no problems. Everyone is happy. 
As the years pass, the population grows, and so does the number of sheep graz￾ing on the Town Commons. With a growing number of sheep, the land starts to 
lose its ability to replenish itself. Eventually, the land is grazed so heavily that it 
becomes barren. With no grass left on the Town Commons, raising sheep is impos￾sible, and the once prosperous wool industry disappears. Many families lose their 
source of livelihood. 
What causes this tragedy? Why do the shepherds allow the sheep population 
to grow so large that it destroys the Town Commons? The reason is that social and 
private incentives differ. Avoiding the destruction of the grazing land depends on 
the collective action of the shepherds. If they acted together, they could reduce the 
sheep population to a size that the Town Commons can support. Yet no single fam￾ily has an incentive to reduce the size of its own flock because each flock represents 
only a small part of the problem. 
In essence, the Tragedy of the Commons arises because of an externality. When 
one family’s flock grazes on the common land, it reduces the quality of the land 
available for other families. Because people neglect this negative externality when 
deciding how many sheep to own, the result is an excessive number of sheep. 
If the tragedy had been foreseen, the town could have solved the problem in 
various ways. It could have regulated the number of sheep in each family’s flock, 
internalized the externality by taxing sheep, or auctioned off a limited number of 
sheep -grazing permits. That is, the medieval town could have dealt with overgraz￾ing in the way that modern society deals with pollution. 
In the case of land, however, there is a simpler solution. The town can divide 
the land among the town families. Each family can enclose its parcel of land with 
a fence and then protect it from excessive grazing. In this way, the land becomes a 
private good rather than a common resource. This occurred in England during the 
17th century in what is known as the enclosure movement. 
The Tragedy of the Commons teaches a general lesson: A person who uses a com￾mon resource diminishes other people’s ability to enjoy it. Because of this negative 
externality, common resources tend to be used excessively. But the government can 
solve the problem by regulating or taxing the undesirable behavior. Alternatively, 
the government can sometimes turn the common resource into a private good. 
This lesson has been known for thousands of years. The ancient Greek philoso￾pher Aristotle pointed out the problem: “What is common to many is taken least 
care of, for all men have greater regard for what is their own than for what they 
possess in common with others.” 
11-3b Some Important Common Resources 
There are many examples of common resources, leading to various government 
policies to mitigate the problem of overuse. 
Clean Air and Water Chapter 10 showed that unfettered markets do not ade￾quately protect the environment. Pollution is a negative externality that can be 
remedied with regulations or corrective taxes. This market failure can be seen

“In general, using more congestion charges in crowded trans￾portation networks—such as higher tolls during peak travel

as a common-resource problem. Clean air and water are com￾mon resources like open grazing land, and excessive pollution is 
like excessive grazing. Environmental degradation is a modern 
Tragedy of the Commons. 
Congested Roads Roads can be either public goods or common 
resources. If a road is not congested, then one person’s use does 
not affect anyone else. In this case, use is not rival in consumption, 
and the road is a public good. But in many urban areas, empty 
roads are an unattainable dream. If a road is congested, its use 
confers a negative externality. Whenever another vehicle drives on 
the road, it becomes more crowded, and others must drive more 
2% uncertain slowly. In this case, the road is a common resource. 
One way for the government to address road congestion is to 
charge drivers a toll, which is, in essence, a corrective tax on the 
externality of congestion. Sometimes, as in the case of local roads, 
tolls are not a practical solution because the cost of collecting 
them is too high. But several rnajc-r cities, including London and 
Stockholm, have found increasing tolls to be a very effective way 
to reduce congestion, and the idea is spreading. 
Sometimes, congestion is a problem only at certain times of the 
day. If a bridge is heavily traveled only during rush hour, for instance, the conges￾tion externality is ]argest then. The efficient solution is to charge higher tolls during 
rush hour. This would give drivers an incentive to alter their schedules, reducing 
traffic when congestion is greatest. 
Another policy that responds to the problem of road congestion (discussed in the 
previous chapter) is the tax on gasoline. A higher gasoline tax increases the price 
of fuel, reduces the amount that people drive, and reduces road congestion. This 
tax is an imperfect solution to congestion because it affects other decisions besides 
the amount of driving on congested roads. In particular, the tax also discourages 
driving on uncongested roads, even though there is no congestion externality for 
these roads. And it misses congestion caused by electric cars. 
Fish, Whales, and Other Wildlife Many species are common resources. 
Fish and whales, for instance, have commercial value, and anyone can go to the 
ocean and catch whatever is available. Each person has little incentive to main￾tain the species for the next year. Just as excessive grazing can ruin the Town 
Commons, excessive fishing and whaling can destroy commercially valuable 
marine populations. 
Oceans remain one of the least regulated common resources. Two problems 
prevent an easy solution. First, many countries have access to the oceans, so any 
solution would require international cooperation among countries that hold dif￾ferent values. Second, because the oceans are so vast, enforcing any agreement is 
difficult. As a result, fishing rights have been a frequent source of tension among 
normally friendly countries. 
Within the United States, various laws aim to manage fish and other wildlife 
resources. The government charges for fishing and hunting licenses, and it restricts 
the lengths of the fishing and hunting seasons. Fishermen are often required to 
throw back small fish, and hunters are permitted to kill only a limited number of 
animals. All these laws reduce the use of a common resource and help maintain 
animal populations.

Why the Cow Is Not Extinct 
Throughout history, many species of animals have been threatened 
with extinction. When Europeans first arrived in North America, 
more than 60 million buffalo roamed the continent. But buffalo hunt￾ing was so rampant that by 1900 the animal’s population had fallen to about 400 
before the government stepped in to protect what was left of the species. In some 
African countries today, elephants face a similar challenge, as poachers kill them 
for the ivory in their tusks. 
Yet not all animals with commercial value face this threat. The beef cow is a 
valuable source of food, but no one worries that it will soon be extinct. The great 
demand for beef seems to ensure that the species will survive. 
Why does the commercial value of ivory threaten the elephant, while the com￾mercial value of beef protects the cow? The reason is that elephants are a common 
resource, while cows are a private good. Elephants roam freely without owners, 
and poachers kill as many as they can. Because poachers are numerous, each 
has little incentive to preserve the elephant population. By contrast, cattle live on 
ranches that are privately owned, and their owners have an incentive to maintain 
the cattle population. 
Governments have tried to solve the elephant's 
problem in two ways. Some countries, such as Kenya, 
Tanzania, and Uganda, have made it illegal to kill 
elephants and sell their ivory. Yet these laws have been 
hard to enforce, and the battle between the authorities 
and poachers has become increasingly violent. Elephant 
populations have continued to dwindle. By contrast, 
other countries, such as Botswana, Malawi, Namibia, 
and Zimbabwe, have made elephants a private good 
by allowing people to kill elephants, but only those on 
their own property. Landowners have an incentive to 
preserve the species on their own land, and, as a result, 
some of those elephant populations have started to 
rise. With private ownership and the profit motive on 
its side, the African elephant might someday be as safe

In 2021, President Biden proposed 
spending $2.25 trillion on infrastrue￾ture, including roads and bridges. 
Here, an economist argues that the 
nation mip;ht not get as much from 
this spfind.ing as it could. 
How Federal Infrastructure 
Dollars Get Nickeled and 
DIIIIEII 
B}‘ CIH"I‘u’d Wmstnn 
oliticians and economists of all stripes have 
agreed on increased spending to improve 
the condition of L.5. infrastructure, but poli￾cymakers have failed for decades to act on this 
rare agreement. 
President Joe Biden is planning a multi￾trillion-dollar infrastructure and jobs package 
to spur transformative change to the economy. 
Unfortunately, the infrastructure component of 
his plan will fail to significantly improve the 
nation’s roads, bridges, and the like because 
it ignores the vast inefficiencies in current 
transportation policy that greatly reduce ben￾efits from infrastructure spending. 
Let me take you on the journey of a dollar 
of government spending intended to improve, 
for example, travel conditions on a highway. 
This dollar will have a long, perilous trip and 
encounter many dangers enroute that will divert 
it from its correct destination and take large, 
wasteful chunks out of it. By the time it reaches 
the wrong destination, it will fund much less 
than a dollar's worth of highway improvements. 
The dangers it encounters include inefficient 
road pricing and investment policy, inflated 
input and project costs, misallocation of 
highway revenues, and the slow adoption of 
technological innovations. 
The trouble for our metaphorical dollar 
begins as soon as it starts trying to follow 
the signposts to its destination. Efficient 
pricing and investment serve that purpose 
by pointing to the amount and location of 
additional spending that would best benefit 
travelers. Efficient road pricing consists of 
charging motorists and truckers congestion 
tolls and pavement-wear fees to account for 
the costs they impose on other travelers by 
delaying them and damaging their vehicles, 
and for the costs of repairing and expanding 
the highway. Investments in a road, such as 
an additional lane, produce benefits, such as 
less delay, that are worth the cost. Efficient 
pricing and investment enable the road 
system to provide optimal travel conditions 
for a given level of expenditures. Moreover, 
they prevent waste by providing directions 
for how policymakers can improve road travel 
through additional expenditures that yield 
the greatest benefits. Current inefficient 
pricing and investment policies do not pro￾vide those directions, causing policymakers 
to waste money on projects that yield only 
small benefits. 
Efficient prices for road users also serve 
two other important purposes. First, they 
fund efficient infrastructure investments. 
Biden wants to fund additional infrastructure 
spending by raising taxes on businesses. This 
approach is inefficient, and it may put his 
plan in political jeopardy. Second, efficient 
prices would reduce, and possibly eliminate, 
the highway budget deficit and the burden on 
general taxpayers. 
Roads should be built, maintained and, 
when necessary, expanded at minimum cost 
and in a timely manner. In other words, 
projects should take the shortest route 
to completion without sacrificing qual￾ity. However, various regulations lead our 
11-4 Conclusion: Property Rights and Government Action 
This chapter and the previous one showed that markets do not adequately 
provide everything that a society needs. They don’t ensure that the air we 
breathe is clean or that our country is defended from foreign aggressors. Instead, 
societies rely on the government to protect the environment and provide for 
the national defense. 
The problems considered in these chapters arise in many different contexts, but 
they have a common theme. In each case, the market fails to allocate resources 
efficiently when something of value has no price attached to it. This happens when 
property rights are not well established, sometimes because they can't be. For 
example, although clean air and national defense are undeniably valuable, no pri￾vate individual has the legal right to price them and profit from their use. A factory

dollar on a longer, more costly route, with￾out increasing quality. State and federal 
(Davis-Bacon) regulations inflate wages and 
bloat the labor force hired to manage and 
complete highway projects. “Buy American” 
requirements for construction materials used 
in federal-aid highway projects, such as 
bridge repairs, raise costs even though less￾expensive foreign materials of comparable 
quality could have been used. Moreover, the 
permitting process, environmental regula￾tions on highway design, and other factors 
greatly extend the time to complete highway 
projects. 
Earmarks and demonstration projects 
have become a growing political cost to 
ensure that multivear federal transporta￾tion bills are passed. Those pet projects, 
as well as highway funds that are allocated 
throughout the country by formula without 
regard for efficiency, take our dollar on side 
trips that often go nowhere. 
Finally, our dallar could take fruitful 
shortcuts if policymakers adopt the latest 
technologies to improve highways' design 
characteristics and maintenance at lower 
costs and to enhance traffic safety. But state 
Departments of Transportation are slow to 
keep up with and implement new technolo￾gies and tend to award contracts based on 
Source: Barron's, March 24, 2021 
the minimum bid, not on the technological 
sophistication of the contractor. 
Thus, a dollar bill intended to improve the 
road system is repeatedly nickeled and dimed 
and amives as small change at the wrong des￾tination because it has taken the wrong direc￾tion, gone on a longer route, made pointless 
side trips, and missed helpful technological 
shortcuts. The cumulative lost and damaged 
dallar bills intended for infrastructure improve￾ments amount to billions of dollars of wasted 
infrastructure spending every year. Biden's new 
infrastructure plan, if passed, would produce 
the same outcome because its dollars would 
take the same perilous journey that previous 
dallars have taken. 
The perilous journey persists because it 
has yet to create political risks that give 
policymakers the incentive to make infra￾structure policy more efficient. But that may 
change. As Quentin Karpilow and | point out 
in our Brookings book, Avtonomous Vehicles: 
The Road fo Economic Growth?, autonomous 
vehicles are a watershed moment in the 
development of transpartation. AVs promise 
not only to vastly improve road travel and 
generate huge benefits to travelers, shippers, 
and delivery companies, but also to benefit 
major sectors of the U.5. economy by reducing 
congestion and virtually eliminating vehicle 
accidents. However, autonomous vehicles will 
not live up to their promise if the inefficient 
infrastructure policies that have created the 
perilous journey and compromised road travel 
are not reformed. 
The whole world will be watching as 
countries, cities, and states compete 
intensely to successfully develop and adopt 
autonomous vehicles. Policymakers who 
weaken their jurisdiction’s AV operations by 
allowing the infrastructure dollar's perilous 
journey to persist should be prepared to incur 
significant political costs. Biden should take 
the first step to avoid those costs by mak￾ing infrastructure spending more efficient 
instead of simply increasing it. W

pollutes too much because no one charges the factory for the pollution it emits. The 
market does not provide for national defense because no one can charge those who 
are defended for the benefit they receive. 
When the absence of property rights leads to a market failure, the govern￾ment may be able to solve the problem. Sometimes, as in the sale of pollu￾tion permits, the government can help define property rights and unleash 
market forces. Other times, as in restricted hunting seasons, the government 
can regulate private behavior. 5till other times, as in the provision of national 
defense, the government can use tax revenue to supply a good that the market 
fails to supply. In each of these cases, if the policy is well-planned and well￾run, it can make the allocation of resources more efficient and raise economic 
well-being,.

Chapter in a Nutshell 
* Goods differ in whether they are excludable and 
whether they are rival in consumption. A good is 
excludable if it is possible to prevent someone from 
using it. It is rival in consumption if one person’s use of 
the good reduces others’ ability to use the same unit of 
the good. Markets work best for private goods, which 
are both excludable and rival in consumption. Markets 
do not work as well for other types of goods. 
* Public goods are neither excludable nor rival in con￾sumption. Examples of public goods include fireworks 
displays, national defense, and the discovery of fun￾damental knowledge. Because people are not charged 
for their use of the public good, they have an incentive 
Key Concepts 
to free ride, making private provision of the good 
infeasible. Governments can improve the allocation of 
resources by providing public goods and determining, 
the quantity of each good with cost-benefit analysis. 
Common resources are not excludable but are rival 
in consumption. Examples include common grazing 
land, clean air, and congested roads. Because people 
are not charged for their use of common resources, 
they tend to use them excessively. Governments can 
remedy this problem using various methods, such as 
regulations and corrective taxes, to limit the use of 
COMITION resources.

of Healthcare 
- 
Il of us would like to lead long, healthy lives. And given 
| the choice, we would prefer to do so without having to 
bendure the surgeon’s scalpel, the nurse’s needle, or the 
dentist’s drill. Yet good health rarely comes so easily. Achieving 
a long, healthy life often requires the use of scarce resources, 
and that makes it, at least in part, an economic problem. More 
than one out of every six dollars spent in the U.S. economy goes 
to some form of healthcare, including spending on physicians, 
nurses, dentists, hospitals, pharmaceutical drugs, and medical 
research scientists. Understanding the modern economy requires 
an appreciation of the special economics of healthcare. 
This chapter begins by examining the economic torces that shape 
the healtheare system. The standard model of supply and demand, 
in which prices guide buyers and sellers to an efficient allocation 
of resources, explains how large parts of the world work, but the 
market for healthcare deviates from this benchmark in many ways. 
These deviations often call for government policies to ensure that 
healthcare resources are allocated efficiently and equitably. And 
in most nations, governments are deeply involved in healthcare

markets. That involvement increased greatly in 2020 and 2021 when governments 
around the world needed to take emergency action to curb the fatal effects of the 
novel coronavirus pandemic. 
The second half of this chapter looks at some of the key facts that describe the 
U.5. healthcare system. The system today is very different from what it was fifty 
years ago, and it is also different from the systems of other nations. Recognizing 
these differences is important for understanding the healthcare systems that exist 
now as well as for imagining those that could exist in the future. 
The proper scope of government intervention in healthecare, and even the core 
principles for organizing the healthcare system, remain topics of heated discussion. 
This introduction to the economics of healthcare will give you a better grounding 
in this great debate. 
12-1 The Special Characteristics of the Market for Healthcare 
The standard theory of how markets work is the model of supply and demand, 
which we studied in Chapters 4 through 7. That model has several notable 
features: 
The main interested parties are the buyers and sellers in the market. 
Buyers are good judges of what they get from sellers. 
Bu}rers pay sellers dlrectly for the goflds and services being exchanged. 
Market prices are the primary mechanism for coordinating the decisions of 
market participants. 
5. The invisible hand on its own leads to an efficient allocation of resources. N . 
For many goods and services, this model offers a reasonably good description. 
Yet none of the five features of the standard model reflects what occurs in the 
market for healthcare. The healthcare market has consumers (patients) and pro￾ducers (doctors, nurses, etc.). But various factors complicate the analysis of their 
interactions. In particular: 
1. Third parties—insurers, governments, and unwitting bystanders—often 
have an interest in healthcare outcomes. 
2. Patients often don’t know what they need and cannot evaluate the treatment 
they are getting. 
3. Healthcare providers are often paid not by the patients but by private or 
government health insurance. 
4. The rules established by these insurers, more than market prices, determine 
the allocation of resources. 
5. In light of these issues, the invisible hand can’t work its magic, so the 
allocation of resources can be highly inefficient. 
Healthcare is not the only good or service in the economy that departs from the 
standard model of supply, demand, and the invisible hand. (Recall our discussions 
of externalities in Chapter 10 and public goods in Chapter 11.) But healthcare may 
be the most important one that departs radically from this benchmark. Examining 
the special features of this market is a good startmg point for understanding why 
the government plays a large role in the provision of healthcare and why health 
policy is often complex and vexing.

12-1a Externalities Galore 
Chapter 10 showed that market outcomes may be inefficient when there are exter￾nalities. To recap: An externality arises when a person engages in an activity that 
influences the well-being of a bystander but neither pays nor receives compensation 
tor that effect. If the impact on the bystander is adverse, it is a negative externality. 
If it is beneficial, it is a positive externality. In the presence of externalities, society’s 
interest extends beyond the well-being of buyers and sellers in the market to include 
the well-being of bystanders who are affected indirectly. Because buyers and sellers 
neglect the external effects of their actions when deciding how much to demand 
or supply, the externality can render the unregulated market outcome inefficient. 
This general conclusion is crucial for understanding healthcare, where externali￾ties are rampant. These externalities can call for government action to remedy the 
market failure. 
Take vaccines, for example. If Vicki vaccinates herself against a discase, she is 
less likely to catch it and become a carrier who infects other people. In the language 
of economics, Vicki’s action conveys a positive externality. If getting a jab has some 
cost, either in money, time, discomfort, or risk of adverse side effects, too few people 
will do it because they may not fully take into account the positive externalities 
when weighing the costs and benefits. The government can remedy this problem 
by requiring vaccination or encouraging it through media campaigns and incen￾tives. The government can also increase the supply of vaccines by subsidizing their 
development, manufacture, and distribution. 
Another example of a healthcare externality concerns medical research. When 
a physician or scientist figures out a new way to treat an ailment, that information 
enters society’s pool of medical knowledge. The benefit to other physicians and 
patients is a positive externality. Without government intervention, there will be 
too little research. 
Government responds to this problem in many ways. Sometimes, it grants a 
researcher a patent, as is the case with new pharmaceutical drugs. The patent 
provides an incentive for research by allowing the researcher to profit from a 
temporary monopoly. The patent is said to internalize the externality. Yet this 
approach is not perfect because the monopoly price is higher than the marginal 
cost of production. As we will see in Chapter 16, the high monopoly price reduces 
consumption of the patented treatment, leading to inefficiency as measured by the 
deadweight loss. Moreover, the high price may be particularly hard on patients 
with lower incomes. 
Healthcare externalities sometimes point policymakers in conflicting directions. 
Again, consider vaccines. Because research into new vaccines conveys a positive 
externality, the government grants patent protection. But once a vaccine is devised, 
the high price charged by the patent holder slows its dissemination, undermining 
the positive externality from vaccination. One possible solution to this conflict, 
advocated by the economist Michael Kremer, is for the government to buy out the 
patent holder. This approach could put the innovation in the public domain, making 
it more widely available while still providing incentives for research. 
Another way the government can deal with the positive externality from medical 
research is to subsidize research directly—and indeed it does. The annual budget of 
the National Institutes of Health, which funds medical research, is over $40 billion, 
or about 5130 per person. This policy requires taxation to raise the necessary funds, 
and most taxation entails deadweight losses of its own. But if the externalities from 
the funded research exceed the cost of the research, including the deadweight losses, 
overall welfare can increase.

229230 Part IV The Econamics of the Public Sector 
Vaccine Hesitancy 
The disease of measles illustrates the externalities central to health 
economics. Measles is highly contagious and dangerous, especially 
for children. Before a vaccine was developed in 1963, between 3 and 
4 million people in the United States caught the disease every year. Tens of thou￾sands required hospitalization, and many hundreds died. 
Fortunately, immunization proved effective. By 2000, measles was largely elimi￾nated as a health risk in the United States. During the subsequent decade, only 
about 60 cases were reported per year. The measles vaccine was one of the great 
success stories of modern medicine. In the language of economics, the research that 
created the vaccine had large positive externalities both in the United States and 
around the world. 
The elimination of the disease, however, had some unintended consequences. 
In particular, it reduced the vigilance of some parents in ensuring that their chil￾dren were vaccinated. Their decision to forgo vaccination was partly based on the 
belief—debunked among scientists but persistent among some segments of the 
public—that vaccines entail a significant risk of adverse side effects. Some claimed 
a religious basis for their decision not to vaccinate. Because of declining immuniza￾tion, measles started to become more common again. There were 372 reported cases 
in 2018 and more than 1,000 in 2019. 
Policymakers struggled with how to respond. In several states, lawmakers 
strengthened requirements that all children be vaccinated. Exemptions were 
allowed for valid medical reasons but not for religious or philosophical beliefs. 
Critics of these laws viewed them as a violation of personal liberty. Supporters 
viewed them as supporting the community’s need to deal with the externalities 
inherent in infectious diseases. 
A similar issue arose during the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020-2021. Soon after 
vaccines for this new virus were developed, they became widely and freely avail￾able. According to medical experts, eradicating the disease would require vaccinat￾ing most of the population. But because the vaccines were new, many people were 
hesitant. Some economists proposed paying people to get vaccinated—a Pigovian 
subsidy to internalize the externality and quicken the end of the pandemic. The 
proposal was not widely adopted at the national level, but some states and localities 
experimented with such incentives. In New York City, for example, those who got 
vaccinated were offered a voucher for a burger at Shake Shack. @ 
12-1b The Difficulty of Monitoring Quality 
In most markets, consumers know what they want, and after a transaction is completed, 
they can judge whether they are happy with what they got. Healthcare is different. 
When you get sick, you may not know which treatment is best. You rely on the advice 
of a physician who has years of specialized training. And even with hindsight, you can￾not reliably judge whether the treatment offered to you was the right one. Sometimes 
state-of-the-art medicine fails to improve a patient’s health. And given the restorative 
power of the human body, the wrong treatment can sometimes appear to work. 
The inability of healthcare consumers to monitor the quality of the product they 
are buying leads to government regulations. Most importantly, the government 
requires physicians, dentists, nurses, and other health professionals to have licenses 
to practice. These licenses are granted only after an individual attends an approved 
school and passes rigorous tests. Those caught practicing without a license can be 
imprisoned. Similarly, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) oversees the test￾ing and release of new pharmaceutical drugs to ensure they are safe and effective.

In addition to government regulation, the medical profession monitors itself 
by accrediting medical schools, promoting best practices, and establishing norms 
of professional behavior. A physician’s advice is supposed to be based entirely on 
the patient’s best interest, not the physician’s personal gain. When patients accept 
this advice, they rely on a degree of trust, which may be fostered by long-term 
relationships between doctor and patient. But conflict-of-interest problems exist 
in healthcare as they do elsewhere in society, and this trust is sometimes breached. 
While public and private regulations of healthcare have many benefits for patients, 
they also have some drawbacks. For example, some economists have argued that 
there are too many hurdles to opening new medical schools. They suggest that the 
medical profession acts like a monopoly: By restricting the number of doctors, it 
drives up doctors” salaries and consumers” healtheare costs. Other economists have 
argued that the FDA is too slow in approving new drugs. Some patients who might 
have benefited from experimental treatments are forced to go without them. The 
proper balance between protecting public safety and giving people the freedom to 
make their own healthcare decisions is a subject of ongoing debate. 
12-1¢ The Insurance Market and Its Imperfections 
Because people don’t know when they are going to get sick or what kind of medical 
treatments they will need, spending on healthcare is unpredictable. This uncertainty, 
along with people’s responses to it, helps to explain why we have the health insti￾tutions that we do. 
The Value of Insurance Most people exhibit risk aversion. That is, they dislike 
uncertainty. Imagine that you could choose between receiving $100,000 with certainty 
and flipping a coin to receive $50,000 or $150,000 with a 50-50 probability. The two 
options offer the same average amount, but the second is riskier. If you prefer the 
certain $100,000, you are risk averse. 
A similar choice arises from the randomness of health spending. Suppose that 
some disease affects 2 percent of the population and that everyone is equally likely 
to be stricken. Treatment costs $30,000 per patient. In this case, for every 100 people, 
2 will get the disease, resulting in a total healthcare bill of $60,000. The population’s 
average cost of healthcare is 560,000/100, or $600. 
Here's the key point: People who are risk averse would prefer to pay $600 with 
certainty over a 2 percent chance of having to pay $30,000. Insurance gives people 
this option. 
The way insurance generally works is that a person facing a risk pays a fee (called 
a premium) to an insurance company, which in return agrees to accept all or part 
of the risk. There are many types of insurance. Car insurance covers the risk that 
you get into an auto accident, fire insurance covers the risk that your house burns 
down, and health insurance covers the risk that you need expensive medical treat￾ment. In our example, a health insurance company can charge a premium of $600 
(or slightly more to make a profit) in exchange for promising to cover the cost of 
the $30,000 treatment for the 2 percent of its customers who get the disease. 
Markets for insurance are useful in reducing risk, but two problems hamper their 
ability to do so fully and efficiently. 
Moral Hazard The first problem that impedes the operation of insurance markets 
is moral hazard: When people have insurance to cover their spending on health￾care, they have less incentive to engage in behavior that will keep that spending 
to a reasonable level. For example, if patients don’t have to pay for each visit to a 
risk aversion 
a dislike of uncertainty

adverse selection 
the tendency for the mix 
of unobserved attributes 
to become undesirable 
from the standpoint of an 
uninformed party 
doctor, some may go whenever they experience minor symptoms (a runny nose, 
an achy finger). Similarly, physicians may be more likely to order tests of dubious 
value when they know an insurance company is picking up the tab. 
Health insurance companies try to reduce moral hazard by finding ways to induce 
people to act more responsibly. For instance, rather than picking up the entire cost 
of a visit to a physician, they may charge patients co-pays of, say, $20 per visit to 
deter unnecessary visits. Insurance companies may also have strict rules about 
the circumstances under which they will cover the cost of certain tests ordered by 
physicians. 
Adverse Selection The second problem that impedes the operation of insurance 
markets is adverse selection: If customers differ in relevant attributes (such as 
whether they have a chronic disease) and those differences are known to them but 
not to insurers, the mix of people who buy insurance may be especially expensive 
to insure. In particular, people with hidden conditions are more likely to buy health 
insurance than healthy people. As a result, for an insurance company to cover its 
costs, the price of health insurance must reflect the cost of a sicker-than-average 
person. That price may be high enough that some people with average health may 
forgo buying insurance. As people drop coverage, the insurance market fails to 
achieve its purpose of reducing the financial risk from illness. 
Even worse, adverse selection can lead to a phenomenon called the death spiral. 
Suppose that insurance companies must charge everyone the same price. It might 
seem to make sense for a company to base the price of insurance on the health 
characteristics of the average person. But after it does so, the healthiest people may 
decide that insurance is not worth the cost and drop out of the insured pool. With a 
sicker-than-expected group of customers, the company has higher costs and must 
therefore raise the price of insurance. The price increase then induces the next healthi￾est group of people to drop insurance coverage, driving up the cost and price again. 
As this process continues, more people drop coverage, the insured pool gets less 
healthy, and the price keeps rising. In the end, the insurance market may disappear. 
The problem of adverse selection has been central in the debate over health policy. 
For example, the Affordable Care Act (signed by President Obama in 2010 and often 
called “Obamacare”) prevented health insurance companies from charging more to 
cover people with pre-existing medical conditions. This rule was enacted to help 
people with ongoing medical problems, but it was also a recipe for adverse selection: 
People with pre-existing conditions could view insurance as a better deal than those 
without them and, therefore, might be more likely to buy health insurance. Healthy 
people would have an incentive to wait until they got sick before buying insurance. 
Lawmakers were aware of this problem. To combat it, the Affordable Care Act 
required all Americans to buy health insurance and imposed a financial penalty on 
those who did not. (It also gave subsidies to help households with lower incomes 
afford insurance.) The goal of the mandate was to increase the number of healthy 
people buying insurance, thereby reducing the problem of adverse selection and 
lowering the cost of insurance. As more healthy people entered the insurance market, 
those without pre-existing conditions would, in effect, subsidize those with them. 
Analysts disagree on the extent to which the Affordable Care Act has improved 
the healthcare market. Many people (presumably healthy ones) chose to remain 
uninsured and pay the penalty, leading some to suggest that the penalties for not 
purchasing insurance were too small to prevent a significant amount of adverse 
selection. Yet the law has increased the number of people with health insurance, 
which was one of its main goals. For the population under age 65 (when Medicare

eligibility starts), the share without insurance fell from 18 percent in 2010 to 
11 percent in 2020. 
The mandate to buy health insurance, however, has been politically divisive. Its 
critics argue that penalizing people for not buying something is too great an infringe￾ment on personal liberty. At the end of 2017, President Donald Trump signed a tax 
bill that included an elimination of the health insurance mandate. Eliminating the 
mandate so far has not led to the beginning of a death spiral, perhaps because most 
people appreciate the value of insurance and may not need to be required to buy it. 
12-1d Healthcare as a Right 
Typically, when some people don't buy a good or service, the outcome is not a major 
problem for society. For example, suppose that admission to a water park becomes 
expensive and people with lower incomes choose other forms of entertainment. 
Some may lament that the water park is not enjoyed more widely, but few would 
argue this amounts to a great injustice. 
Healthcare is different. When people get sick, it seems wrong to deny them treat￾ment because they have low incomes. Healthcare, unlike admission to a water park, 
is widely viewed as a human right. This judgment goes beyond the traditional scope 
of economics, but the study of healthcare economics needs to take it into account. 
In some ways, healthcare is like food: It is essential to survive. Government steps 
in when needed to ensure that everyone can get the essentials. For example, in 
the United States, resources for food are provided by the Supplemental Nutrition 
Assistance Program (SNAP), formerly known as the Food Stamp Program. There is, 
however, an important difference between food and healthcare. In recent decades, 
the price of food has risen more slowly than incomes, so affording an adequate 
diet has required a declining share of the typical household’s budget. By contrast, 
because the cost of state-of-the-art healthcare has risen rapidly, affording it has 
required an increasing share of the typical household’s budget. 
The judgment that healthcare is a right, along with its rising cost, has led to a 
large role for the government. In many nations, such as Canada and England, the 
government runs the healthcare systems, financed mostly by taxes. These are some￾times called single-payer systems because one entity—the government's health 
service—pays all the bills. 
In the United States, most people have private health insurance, often through 
their employers, but the government still has a large role. Medicare provides health 
insurance for those 65 and older, Medicaid provides health insurance for those with 
low incomes, the Veterans Health Administration offers healthcare to former mem￾bers of the military, and the Affordable Care Act regulates the market for private 
health insurance and gives insurance subsidies to many houscholds with lower 
incomes. Whether these programs can be improved and, if so, how, remains a topic 
of debate. But there is little doubt that, with healthcare often viewed as a human 
right, the government will continue to play a large role in the healthcare system. 
12-1e¢ The Rules Governing the Healthcare Marketplace 
The importance of health insurance, whether provided by private companies or 
the government, requires that the market for healthcare work differently than most 
other markets in the economy. Most markets, such as the market for ice cream, look 
like panel (a) of Figure 1. They consist of buyers and sellers. Sellers offer a good or 
service at the market price. Buyers who want the item simply have to offer up the 
right amount of money to purchase it. Exchanges are made, and soon, the sellers 
are counting their profits, and the buyers are enjoving their ice-cream cones.

but providers are paid by insurers (either Insurer 
the government or private companies). This 
arrangement requires rules for financing, 
access, and payment. 
. Access rules . 
(b} Model of a healthcare market with an insurer 
Financing m ]Iment rules 
The market for healtheare looks more like panel (b) of Figure 1. Providers (the 
sellers of medical services) are not paid directly by patients (the buyers). Instead, 
patients pay money to insurers in the form of either a premium (if the insurer is a 
private company) or taxes (if the insurer is the government). The insurers use this 
money to compensate the providers, who in turn provide medical services to the 
patients. 
This process requires three sets of rules to guide behavior. The first set determines 
the financing—that is, who pays for the insurance and how much they pay. If the 
insurer is the government, the payment for healthcare is part of the tax system. If 
the insurer is a private company, healthcare is financed by the premiums people pay 
for their coverage. The premium is set in the insurance market, which (like other 
markets) bases price on costs. In many cases, however, state and federal govern￾ments regulate the market for private insurance. For example, they may limit the 
extent to which companies can charge different prices based on age, gender, and 
pre-existing conditions. Thus, even when healthcare financing occurs between a 
patient and a private insurer, it is still shaped by government policy. 
The second set of rules determines patients’ access to healthcare. Because insured 
patients do not pay the full cost of each medical service they consume, there is the 
possibility of overuse. To mitigate the moral hazard problem, the insurer (whether 
the government or a private company) tries to limit access to when it makes sense. 
To do so, the insurer establishes rules that ration the use of medical services based on 
estimated costs and benefits. For example, patients may be able to get a routine check￾up no more than once a year, may have access only to certain doctors with whom the 
insurer has contractual arrangements, or may need a referral from a general practitio￾ner before seeing a more expensive specialist. Such access rules can be annoving, but 
they are necessary because, once people have insurance to pick up the cost, market 
prices no longer give them accurate signals about how to allocate scarce resources. 
The third set of rules determines the payments from insurers to providers. These 
rules establish what treatment and care an insurer will pay for and how much it 
will pay. Insurers may deem some treatments too expensive, too experimental, or 
msufficiently valuable to pay for them at all. In such cases, providers will often 
not offer patients the services. Sometimes, providers will offer the services only

if the patient pays the full cost of the treatment (as is often the case with cosmetic 
procedures). The healthcare market then reverts from panel (b) in Figure 1 to the 
more typical market in panel (a). 
The rules regarding financing, access, and payment together shape a healthcare 
system. For nations with government-run systems, these rules are set by public 
policy. For nations with more private insurance, such as the United States, these 
rules are often set by insurance companies as they compete for customers, subject 
to government regulations.

12-2 Key Facts about the U.S. 
Healthcare System 
Mow that we understand the main economic forces at work, let’s look at some data 
that describe the U.S. healthcare system. We first examine what the system provides, 
as measured by how long people live. We then see how much it costs, how much 
other nations pay, and how Americans pay the bill. 
12-2a People Are Living Longer 
Let’s start with some good news: People are living much longer today than they 
did a century ago. Figure 2 shows life expectancy over time in the United States. 
Life expectancy measures how long people born today would live, on average, if 
they faced current mortality rates at every age. You can see that it has increased 
substantially over time. In 1900, life expectancy was just 47.3 years. It increased to 
68.2 years by 1950 and to 78.8 years by 2019. 
To be sure, temporary setbacks occur from time to time. The flu pandemic of 1918 
is the most dramatic example, when U.S. life expectancy fell by more than 10 years. 
In addition, as World War II raged, life expectancy declined by 2.9 years from 1942 
to 1943. More recently, the opioid epidemic curtailed many life spans in the United 
States, slowing the advance in life expectancy in the mid-2010s. And in 2020, the 
COVID-19 pandemic cost hundreds of thousands of lives, reducing U.5. life expec￾tancy by 1.5 years—a tragic development that was expected to reverse over the next 
couple of years. Yet despite these setbacks, the long-term trend is highly positive.

Year 
A large part of the increase in life expectancy comes from a decline in infant 
mortality. At the beginning of the 20th century, about 10 percent of children died 
before the age of one. Today, the infant mortality rate is less than (.6 percent. 
Mouch of the credit for the historic increase in life expectancy goes to advances in 
medical technology. Physicians know more about how to prevent disease and how 
to treat medical problems when they arise. For example, highly effective vaccines, 
like those developed during the COVID-19 pandemic, have saved countless lives 
that would otherwise have been lost. 
But other developments play a role as well. Improved sanitation—specifically, 
the availability of clean water and the adequate disposal of sewage—has reduced 
the spread of disease. So has the decline in smoking;: Since 1960, the consumption 
of cigarettes per person has fallen by more than 50 percent. In addition, the rate of 
fatalities from car accidents is now half what it was in 1950, thanks to advances in 
automotive safety, such as seat belts and airbags. 
12-2b Healthcare Spending Is a Growing Share of the Economy 
Figure 3 shows healthcare spending in the United States as a percentage of GDP 
(a measure of the economy’s total income). Health spending rose from 5 percent 
of GDP in 1960 to 18 percent in 2019, and there is no sign that the long-term trend 
is about to stop. 
What explains this trend? Several forces are at work.Chapter 12 The Economics of Healthcare 237

First, most medical care, such as a doctor’s visit, is a personal service, much like 
a barber’s haircut or a teacher’s lesson. The economist William Baumol pointed out 
long ago that for many providers of personal services, productivity does not change 
much over time. But as the rest of the economy experiences technological progress, 
labor productivity and overall wages increase. Those supplying personal services 
will come to expect rising wages along with the rest of the labor force. Yet without 
much productivity growth in those sectors, the only way to give these service provid￾ers higher wages is for the prices of their services (adjusted for overall inflation) to 
increase. In other words, when overall productivity is rising, a symptom of sectors 
with low productivity growth is rising costs and prices. This phenomenon is called 
Baumol's cost disease. It helps explain the rising price of many services, such as 
live entertainment, higher education, and healthcare. And if the demand for the 
services of such sectors is price inelastic, as it is for healthcare, spending on those 
services will increase as well. 
Second, while there have been significant advances in medical technology, many 
of them, rather than reducing costs, have increased spending. In the past, physicians 
had little treatment for many diseases. Bed rest and wait-and-see (and leeches!) 
were sometimes the best they could offer. Today, there are more options. These 
new treatments extend and enhance the quality of life, but they are often expensive. 
Third, changes in the population may have increased the demand for healtheare. 
In particular, birth rates have fallen. Fifty years ago, the average woman had about

three children over her lifetime, compared with about two chil￾dren today. This fall in birth rates, along with the increase in life 
Cost expectancy, has altered the relative sizes of various age groups. 
The share of the U.S. population 65 years or older increased from 
9 percent in 1960 to 17 percent in 2020. Because older people 
generally need more healtheare than the young, the aging of the

What do economists say? 
4% disagree 
88% agree 
Sowrce: [GM Economic Experts Pamel, May 16, 2017, 
the average income per person, adjusted for inflation, is more than 
three times what it was in 1960. As incomes rise, people spend 
more on many things, but they don’t increase spending on all 
items proportionately. How individuals choose to spend the extra 
income depends on preferences. For example, as incomes increase, 
the share of spending on food declines because the marginal value 
of consuming more calories declines rapidly. By contrast, the mar￾ginal value of enjoying additional years of life declines slowly, so 
as we get richer, we may spend a higher fraction of our budget 
on healthcare. In other words, healthcare may be a good with an 
income elasticity greater than one. Estimates based on international comparisons 
put this elasticity at about 1.3. 
Given these four forces, the increasing share of health spending in the economy 
may be inevitable. In and of itself, higher healthcare spending is not necessarily a 
problem. But it does mean that the policy challenges in this sector will loom larger 
over ime. 
8% uncertain 
12-2¢ Healthcare Spending Is Especially High in 
the United States 
Figure 4 shows healthcare spending as a percentage of GDP for seven major devel￾oped nations. One striking fact is that the United States spends an especially high 
fraction of its GDP on healthcare. Most developed nations spend 9 to 12 percent of 
GDP on healthcare, while the United States spends about 17 percent. 
Critics of the U.5. healthcare system use this comparison to argue that the United 
States is uniquely inefficient. They point out that life expectancy is higher in some 
nations that pay less for healthcare, such as Canada, France, and Japan. They some￾times suggest that greater reliance on government rather than private health insur￾ance, as is the case in most other nations, could lower costs without adversely 
affecting health outcomes. In particular, they say that administrative costs, plus 
the insurance companies’ mark-up for profit, might be saved if the United States 
shifted to a government-financed single-payer system. 
Defenders of the U.S. healthcare system accept that further reforms might reduce 
costs but say that reliable conclusions are hard to draw from the international com￾parisons. For example, the rate of obesity is higher in the United States than it is in 
the other six nations in Figure 4. Higher rates of obesity reduce life expectancy and 
increase healthcare costs. Thus, some of the international differences observed in 
health data may not shed light on healthcare systems but instead reflect differing 
approaches to diet and exercise. 
One notable and widely debated difference between the United States and other 
nations concerns pharmaceutical pricing. On average, Canadians spend about 30 
percent less on drugs than Americans do (and residents of some European nations 
spend even less). Often, the same drug is much cheaper on the Canadian side of

the border than on the American side. The reason is that Canada, with its central￾ized government-run health system, maintains strict controls over drug prices. 
Critics of the U.5. healthcare system believe that pharmaceutical companies are 
taking advantage of America’s less centralized system by charging Americans 
exorbitant prices for patented drugs. They argue that the U.S. government should 
follow Canada’s lead and undertake more aggressive regulatory policies to reduce 
drug prices. Defenders of the U.5. system believe that expanding price controls 
into the United States would reduce the incentives for pharmaceutical compa￾nies to engage in research into new drugs. Consumers would benefit from lower 
prices today, but they would bear the cost of a smaller range of treatments in the 
future. Defenders of the U.5. system also say that countries with price controls 
are free-riding on the research that is largely financed by higher prices in the 
United States. 
12-2d Out-of-Pocket Spending Is a Declining Share of 
Health Expenditure 
When you go to physicians or dentists, they are compensated in one of two ways. 
Either you pay them directly out of your own pocket or a third party, such as a 
government insurance program or private insurance company, pays them for you. 
Sometimes, the payment is a combination of the two. 
Figure 5 shows the percentage of spending on personal healthcare that is paid 
out of pocket in the United States. The percentage declined from 55 percent in 1960 
to 13 percent in 2019. Conversely, third-party payment rose from 45 to 87 percent 
of health spending. Of the large amount not paid out of pocket, just under half is 
paid by private insurance companies, while just over half is paid by government 
insurance programs, such as Medicare (the program for those age 65 and older) 
and Medicaid (the program for those with low incomes).

The increasing importance of health insurance is understand￾able. Because the need for healthcare is unpredictable, as it gets 
more expensive, people will seek to protect themselves from the 
financial risks by obtaining insurance. 
Yet many economists believe that the U.5. health system has 
become too reliant on health insurance, especially for small or 
routine expenditures. They believe that excessive insurance exac￾erbates the moral hazard problem discussed earlier, which drives 
up healthcare costs. To explain excessive insurance, they note 
that the U.5. income tax system gives preferential treatment to 
employer-provided health insurance. Compensation in the form 
of health insurance is tax-exempt, unlike cash compensation. 
As a result, employees have an incentive to bargain for more 
generous (and thus more expensive) health insurance than they 
otherwise would, reducing the amount of healthcare they pay 
out of pocket. 
The Affordable Care Act tried to remedy this problem by 
levying a so-called "Cadillac tax” on especially expensive

employer-provided health plans. This policy would have leveled the playing field 
between paying workers in the form of cash compensation and paying them in the 
form of generous health insurance. That is, the tax code would have no longer given 
an incentive for excessive insurance. The Cadillac tax was originally scheduled to

12-3 Conclusion: The Policy Debate 
over Healthcare 
This chapter introduced some of the facts and economic insights useful for under￾standing the market for healthcare. Most of these ideas are widely accepted by 
the economists who study healthcare. Despite this consensus, there is an ongoing 
debate among U.S. policymakers about the government’s role in the healthcare 
system. 
While those on the political left disagree about many things, most agree that a 
large government role is essential in healthcare. They often say that private insur￾ance companies are inefficient and tend to put profit ahead of people. Some would 
like the government to offer people a public option in the healthcare system—that 
is, a government-run insurance program that any person can buy into instead of 
purchasing private insurance. Others would like to move toward a single-payer 
system in which the government pays for healthcare for everyone out of tax rev￾enue, as Medicare now does for those age 65 and older. They point to Canada as a 
worthwhile example. Centralized systems run by intelligent administrators, they 
say, are best able to reduce administrative inefficiency, eliminate wasteful treatment, 
bargain with providers for lower costs, and allocate healthcare resources most 
equitably to where they are most needed. 
The political right is also diverse, but it is fair to say that many people there 
would like to reduce the government’s role in the healthcare system, as in many 
other spheres. They acknowledge that the market for health insurance needs to 
be regulated but would like the regulation to be less heavy-handed than it is now.

Why It's So Hard to Cut Waste

utting waste while preserving critically 
Cimpnrtant treatment is the holy grail of 
health care policy. The coronavirus pandemic 
has shown why that goal has been so stub￾bornly difficult to achieve. 
One of the pandemic's startling effects is 
that despite the overwhelming need for Covid￾19 treatments and vaccinations, health care 
spending in the United States has declined 
sharply. That's because people have been 
reluctant or unable to get medical care that 
isn’t connected to the coronavirus. My own 
calculations, based on government data, show 
that overall total care expenditures dropped 10 
percent in the first nine months of 2020, com￾pared with the same period a year earlier. 
This indiscriminate reduction in spend￾ing closely resembles the unfortunate effects 
of an array of policies over the past half￾century intended to reduce unnecessary 
medical care. These too cut essential and 
inessential care alike. 
Consider what has happened during the 
pandemic. Essential health care visits have 
plummeted: Hospital admissions for severe heart 
attachs and strokes and visits for routine child￾hood vaccinations have fallen sharply. Those 
reductions could have grave consequences. 
At the same time, some types of care 
that are often overused—and can produce 
unnecessary follow-up treatments, anxiety 
and spending—also declined in frequency 
during the pandemic. This includes radio￾logical scans and routine cancer screenings. 
Indeed, a broad spectrum of medical care 
has declined at roughly comparable rates, as 
patients avoided in-person visits and medical 
providers cut availability, 
In short, the pandemic has pushed two 
basic levers used in strategies to limit wasteful 
medical care. These strategies aim to decrease 
patient demand and to restrict the availability 
of treatment by health care providers. And they 
tend to have indiscriminate effects, reducing 
treatment that is critical, along with care that 
is not essential. 
The economic importance of reducing 
wasteful spending is hard to overstate. The 
health care sector accounts for almost one-fifth 
of the 1.5, economy, and one-quarter or more of 
this spending is wasted, a range of studies 
have shown. Excessive administrative costs, 
high prices and inappropriate medical care are 
the three major culprits in wasteful spending, 
driving insurance premiums and taxes without 
helping patients. 
For decades, the driving principle behind 
reducing needless medical care has been that if 
patients or their providers have financial “skin in 
the game,” they will make prudent decisions. To 
encourage patients to make good decisions, insur￾ers make them pay some share of their medical 
costs. High-tdeductible health insurance plans, in 
which the patient herself pays the first thousand 
{or more) dollars of any medical spending for the 
year, are one increasingly common example. 
The economic theory is simple: If something 
becomes more expensive, people will buy less of 
it. And the empirical evidence is overwhelming: 
When patients have to pay more, they use less 
medical care. 
The problem is they use less of all types 
of care. Introducing a high-deductible plan, 
for example, reduces scans for nonspecific low 
back pain and antibiotics for respiratory infec￾tions, as intended. But high deductibles also 
tend to reduce use of mental health services 
and of prescription drugs for managing chronic 
diabetes and high cholesterol, which can have 
negative consequences. 
My own research shows covering uninsured 
individuals with Medicaid is a similarly blunt 
instrument for encouraging people to get 
critically important care. Medicaid increased 
preventive care, which was intended, but also 
increased emergency room visits, which was 
They say that the best healthcare will arise if private insurers and providers openly 
compete for consumers. They fear that a centralized, government-run system would 
limit individual freedom, excessively ration care, and stifle innovation. In their view, 
Canada is an example of what could go wrong: Waiting times for medical procedures 
there can be uncomfortably long, and those who can afford it sometimes choose not 
to wait and instead seek treatment in the United States. 
The debate over health policy is part of the larger debate over income inequal￾ity and the role of government. As Chapter 1 pointed out, society often faces a 
trade-off between equality and efficiency, and that fact looms large when dis￾cussing the provision of healthcare. Those on the political left generally want 
to achieve universal health coverage by providing government insurance or by

not. Even more targeted insurance that lowers 
only the price of specific and valuable care 
has modest effects at best, in encouraging the 
desired outcome. 
Similarly, financial incentives that encour￾age physicians and hospitals to refrain from 
superfluous treatments may also jettison 
some indispensable care. Traditionally, these 
providers were reimbursed piece-rate, billing 
separately for each test and procedure, so that 
the more they did, the more they were paid. 
Toencourage only essential care, there has 
been a widespread shift to paying a fixed fee 
for a patient, regardless of what treatment is 
provided. A hospital might be paid $25,000 for 
a patient's knee replacement, for example, and 
then have to absorb all the associated costs, 
including the hospital stay, surgeon's fees and 
post-discharge rehabilitative care. Or a network 
of health care providers might be paid $10,000 
a year for all of a patient's health care needs. 
That way, the medical provider is on the 
hook for the costs of treatment. But such 
incentives are a double-edged sword: What 
encourages cost-consciousness can discour￾ape optimal care. 
Countries around the world are grappling 
with these issues. A recent study of health care 
in 10 countries—including several with single￾payer systems—concluded that, to one degree 
or another, they all are rife with inefficient and 
UNNECESSAry Care. 
One reason it is so hard to trim waste is 
that physicians and regulators have already 
eliminated so many demonstrably harmful or

useless treatments. Patients are no longer 
offered patent medicines, routine bloodlet￾tings or lobotomies. 
Reducing unnecessary administrative costs 
and curbing high prices is similarly difficult. 
Some red tape is purposeless, but not all of it is. 
Lowering prices can imperil the availability of 
valuable treatment. An adage about advertis￾ing applies to health care: Half of spending is 
wasted; we just don't know which half. 
Low-value doesn't mean no-value-ever. 
That's presumably why Choosing Wisely, a 
campaign to reduce unnecessary care, identi￾fied a large number of tests and procedures 
that patients and physicians should “question™ 
but not eliminate. We don't “question” whether 
it's wise to stick a finger in an electric socket. 
We warn that you shouldn't do it. But most 
medical procedures are different. They are a 
matter of judgment. 
Ordering a computerized tomography, or 
C.T., scan for a patient the first time she com￾plains of a nondescript headache is generally 
not a wise move. Neither is getting married 
after a first date. But occasionally that unnec￾essary scan catches a life-threatening problem 
before it's too late much as. once in a while, a 
whirlwind marriage leads to happily-ever-after. 
Unlikely isn't the same as never, which can 
make it hard for a well-intentioned physician 
or a hopeless romantic to resist. 
That doesn't mean we should stop trying 
to cut waste. But a simple, miracle cure for 
excising mast unnecessary medical care? Don't 
buy it, with or without insurance coverage. B 
Questions to Discuss 
1. Ifyou faced a larger co-pay when you 
visited a physician, would it change how 
often you sought medical care? Why or 
why not? 
2. Arevyou good at judging when you need 
medical care and when it is best to let 
your body heal on its own? Give some 
examples. 
3. How much do you trust your physician in 
deciding what tests to order? Why?

subsidizing private insurance for households with lower incomes. But paying for 
these policies requires increased taxes on households with higher incomes, and 
those taxes are likely to distort incentives and shrink the size of the economic 
pie. Those on the political right emphasize the distortionary effects of taxes and 
income redistribution. They advocate more limited government and lower taxes 
and say this approach will expand the economic pie. But smaller government 
and less revenue mean fewer public resources to help those who struggle to get 
the healthcare they need. 
This debate raises hard and important questions, and this chapter does not offer 
easy answers. But this introduction to health economics should give you a starting 
point for thinking through the many issues.

Chapter in a Nutshell 
* The market for healthcare differs from most other 
markets in several ways. First, there are pervasive 
externalities, such as those associated with vaccination 
and medical research. Second, because consumers can￾not easily gauge the quality of what they are buying, 
private and public institutions intervene to ensure that 
treatment is appropriate. Third, healthcare is often 
judged to be a right, leading to a government role to 
make sure that everyone has access to it. 
Spending on healthcare can be large and unpredict￾able, but health insurance reduces the financial risk 
that people face from a costly event. The problems of 
moral hazard and adverse selection, however, hinder 
the effectiveness of the market for health insurance. 
When people have insurance, either from a private 
company or a government program, the insurer estab￾lishes rules regarding financing, access, and payment. 
Since 1900, life expectancy in the United States has 
increased by about 30 years, largely because of advanc￾es in medical technology. 
Key Concepts

Questions for Review 
1. Give two examples of externalities in the healthcare 
system. 
Explain moral hazard and adverse selection in the 
market for health insurance. 
Describe the three sets of rules that are necessary in a 
healthcare market with an insurer. 
Give three reasons why life expectancy has been 
increasing over time. 
Problems and Applications 
1. Consider how health insurance affects the quantity 
of healthcare services performed. Suppose that the 
typical medical procedure costs $100, yet a person 
with health insurance pays only $20 out of pocket. 
An insurance company pays the remaining $80. 
(The insurance company recoups the $80 through 
premiums, but the premium a person pays does 
not depend on how many procedures that person 
chooses to undertake.) 
moral hazard, p. 231 
* Over the past 60 years, healthcare spending has grown 
substantially as a percentage of national income. 
Several forces are at work: Baumol's cost disease, 
advances in medical technology, the aging of the popu￾lation, and rising incomes. 
The United States spends a higher fraction of its 
national income on healthcare than other developed 
nations. This fact has no simple explanation. Critics 
and defenders of the U.5. healthcare system point to 
different possible reasons. 
The percentage of healthcare spending paid out of 
pocket, rather than by insurance, has declined substan￾tially over time. Some economists say that reliance on 
insurance is excessive, exacerbating moral hazard and 
driving up healthcare costs.

Explain. 
c. Economists often blame the health insurance 
system for excessive use of medical care. Given 
your analysis, why might the use of care be viewed 
as “excessive”? 
d. What sort of policies might prevent this excessive use? 
2. The Live-Long-and-Prosper Health Insurance Company 
charges $5,000 annually for a family insurance policy. 
The company’s president suggests that the company 
raise the annual price to $6,000 to increase its profits. If 
the firm follows this suggestion, what economic problem 
might arise? Would the firm's pool of customers tend 
to become more or less healthy on average? Would the 
company’s profits necessarily increase? 
. Complete the logic behind Baumol's cost disease 
of the service sector. Assume that the economy has 
two sectors—manufacturing and services—and that 
technological advances occur only in manufacturing,. 
a. If a technological advance increases labor 
productivity in manufacturing, the demand 
for labor in manufacturing increases, and the 
equilibrium wage of manufacturing workers 
(increases/ decreases). 
b. If some workers can move between manufacturing 
and services, the change identified in part (a) 
(increases/ decreases) the supply of labor in the 
service sector. 
c. As a result of the shift identified in part (b), the wage 
of service-sector workers (increases/decreases). 
d. Due to the change identified in part (c), the costs 
of businesses that provide services (increase/ 
decrease). 
e. Because of the change in costs identified in part (d), 
the price of services (increases/decreases). 
f. Thus, technological advances in manufacturing 
cause the price of services to (rise /fall). 
. Consider an example of the death spiral. An economy 
consists of five types of people in equal numbers with 
different pre-existing health problems. Here are their 
expected healthcare costs for the coming year: 
A $1,000 
B $2,000 
C $3,000 
D $4,000 
E $5,000 
Chapter 12 The Economics of Healthcare 
. If all five types of people buy health insurance, 
what will be the average cost of healthcare paid 
by insurance companies? The companies need 
to cover this average cost, plus other expenses 
(including a normal profit) of $700. Assuming the 
companies must charge all consumers the same 
price, what price will that be? 
. While all consumers would like to be insured 
to reduce uncertainty, they value this feature at 
$1,000 and, therefore, will forgo insurance if its 
price exceeds their own expected healthcare costs 
by more than $1,000. Which consumers will buy 
insurance at the price calculated in part (a)? 
. For the new insured pool identified in part (b), 
what is the average cost of healthcare? When 
insurance companies observe this new average 
cost, what price will they charge for insurance? 
. When consumers see the new price in part (c), 
which consumers will buy insurance? 
. For the new insured pool identified in part (d), 
what is the average cost of healthcare? When 
insurance companies observe this new average 
cost, what price will they charge for insurance? 
. When consumers see the new price in part (e), 
which consumers will buy insurance? 
. For the new insured pool identified in part (f), 
what is the average cost of healthcare? When 
insurance companies observe this new average 
cost, what price will they charge for insurance? 
. When consumers see the new price in part (g), 
which consumers will buy insurance? Does this 
outcome now look like an equilibrium? 
i. The value of insurance to each person is the $1,000 
from reduced uncertainty plus the expected cost of 
healthcare; the cost of providing it is the insurance 
premium, and the consumer surplus is the excess 
of value over the premium. How much consumer 
surplus is derived from the insurance market as 
described in part (h)? 
j. Now suppose the government mandates that 
everyone buy insurance, so we return to the 
situation in part (a). What surplus would each 
consumer get? What is total surplus in the market? 
. If this society voted on the insurance mandate and 
everyone voted based on their self-interest, how 
would the vole turn out? 
. To ensure that everyone obeys the mandate, how 
large would the penalty for failing to buy insurance 
need to be?

| “Scarface” Capone, the 1920s gangster and crime boss, 
was never convicted for his violent crimes. Yet, eventually, 
e did go to jail—for tax evasion. Capone failed to heed 
Ben Franklin’s observation that “in this world nothing is certain 
but death and taxes.” 
When Franklin made this claim in 1789, Americans paid less than 
5 percent of their income in taxes, and that remained true for the 
next hundred years. Over the course of the 20th century, however, 
taxes became ever more important in the lives of most U.S. citizens. 
Today, all taxes taken together—including personal income taxes, 
corporate income taxes, payroll taxes, sales taxes, and property 
taxes—use up more than a quarter of total American income. In 
many European countries, the tax bite is even larger. 
Taxes are inevitable because citizens expect their governments to 
provide them with goods and services. One of the Ten Principles 
of Economics in Chapter 1 is that markets are usually a good way 
to organize economic activity. But market economies rely on prop￾erty rights and the rule of law, so the government provides police 
and courts. Another of the Ten Principles of Economics is that the 
government can sometimes improve market outcomes. When the 
government remedies an externality (such as pollution), provides 
a public good (such as national defense), or regulates the use of a

common resource (such as fish in a public lake), it can raise economic well-being. 
But these activities can be costly. For the government to perform a range of critical 
functions, it must raise revenue through taxation. 
Earlier chapters used the model of supply and demand to analyze taxes. Chapter 6 
discussed how a tax on a good reduces the quantity sold and how the tax burden is 
shared by buyers and sellers depending on the elasticities of supply and demand. 
Chapter 8 examined how taxes affect economic well-being. In most cases, taxes 
cause deadweight losses: The reduction in consumer and producer surplus result￾ing from a tax exceeds the revenue raised by the government. Yet, as Chapter 10 
demonstrated, taxes can enhance efficiency when they internalize externalities and 
correct market failures. 
This chapter builds on these lessons to discuss the design of a tax system. It begins 
with an overview of how the U.S. government raises money. It then discusses the 
principles of taxation. Most people agree that taxes should impose as small a cost as 
possible and that the tax burden should be distributed fairly. That is, the tax system 
should be both efficient and equitable. As we will see, however, stating these goals 
is easier than achieving them.

How much of the nation’s income does the government collect as taxes? Figure 1 
shows government revenue, including federal, state, and local, as a percentage of 
total income for the U.S. economy. It shows that the role of government has grown 
substantially over the past century. In 1902, the government collected only 7 percent 
of total income; in recent years, the government has collected almost 30 percent. In 
other words, as the economy’s income has grown, the government’s tax revenue 
has grown even more. 
This figure shows the revenue of the federal government and of state and local 
governments as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP), which measures total 
income in the economy. It shows that the government plays a large role in the U.S. 
economy and that its role has grown over time.

Figure 2 presents the tax burden for several major countries, as measured by tax 
revenue as a percentage of total income. The United States has a low tax burden 
compared with most other advanced economies. Many European nations have much 
higher taxes, which finance a more generous social safety net, including greater 
assistance for people experiencing poverty and unemployment. 
13-1a Taxes Collected by the Federal Government 
The U.S. federal government collects about two-thirds of the taxes in our economy. 
Table 1 shows the receipts of the federal government in 2020. Total receipts that year 
were about $3.7 trillion, a number so large that it is hard to comprehend. To bring 
this astronomical number down to earth, we can divide it by the size of the U.S. 
population, which was about 331 million in 2020. We then find that the average 
American paid $11,069 to the federal government in 2020. 
Personal Income Taxes The largest source of revenue for the federal govern￾ment is the personal income tax. As April 15 approaches in a typical year, almost 
every American family fills out a form to determine the income tax it owes the 
government. Each family is required to report its income from all sources: wages 
from working, interest on savings, dividends from corporations in which it owns 
shares, profits from any small businesses it operates, and so on. The family’s tax 
liability (how much it owes) is based on its total income.

But a family’s income tax liability is not simply proportional to its income. Instead, 
the law requires a more complicated calculation. Taxable income is total income 
minus an amount based on the number of dependents (primarily children) and 
minus certain expenses that policymakers have deemed “deductible” (such as mort￾gage interest payments and charitable giving). The tax liability is then calculated 
from taxable income using a schedule like the one shown in Table 2. 
This table presents the marginal tax rate—the tax rate applied to each additional 
dollar of income. Because the marginal tax rate rises as income rises, higher-income 
families pay a larger percentage of their income in taxes. Note that each tax rate 
in the table applies only to income within the associated range, not to a person’s 
entire income. For example, a person with an income of $1 million still pays only 
10 percent of the first $9,875. (A more complete discussion of marginal tax rates will 
come later in this chapter.) 
Payroll Taxes Almost as important to the federal government as the personal income 
tax are payroll taxes, which are levied on the wages that a firm pays its workers. Table 1 
calls this revenue social insurance taxes because it mainly pays for Social Security 
and Medicare. Social Security is an income-support program designed primarily to 
maintain the living standards of older people. Medicare is the government health 
program for them. In 2020, the total payroll tax was 15.3 percent for annual earnings 
up to $137,700 and 2.9 percent of earnings above $137,700, together with an additional 
0.9 percent for taxpayers with high incomes (above $200,000 if single, $250,000 if mar￾ried). For many middle-income households, the payroll tax is the largest tax they pay.

Corporate Income Taxes Next in magnitude, but much smaller than either 
personal income taxes or social insurance taxes, is the corporate income tax. A cor￾poration is a business set up to have its own legal existence, distinct and separate 
from its owners. The government taxes each corporation based on its profit—the 
amount the corporation receives for the goods or services it sells minus the costs of 
producing them. Notice that corporate profits are often taxed twice. They are taxed 
once by the corporate income tax when the corporation earns the profits, and they 
are taxed again by the personal income tax when the corporation uses its profits to 
pay dividends to its shareholders. (An exception to this second tax occurs when the 
shares are held by nontaxable entities, such as university endowments and some 
retirement accounts.) In part to compensate for double taxation, policymakers have 
decided to tax dividend income at lower rates than other types of income: In 2020, 
the top marginal tax rate on dividend income was only 20 percent (plus a 3.8 percent 
Medicare tax), compared with the top marginal tax rate on ordinary income of 37 
percent (plus the same 3.8 percent). 
Other Taxes The last category, labeled “other” in Table 1, makes up 10 percent 
of receipts. This category includes excise taxes, which are taxes on specific goods 
such as gasoline, cigarettes, and alcoholic beverages. It also includes various small 
items, such as estate taxes and customs duties. 
13-1b Taxes Collected by State and Local Governments 
State and local governments collect about a third of all taxes paid. Table 3 shows 
the receipts of U.S. state and local governments. Total receipts for 2020 were $3 
trillion, or $9,157 per person. The table also shows how this total is broken down 
into different kinds of taxes. 
The most important taxes for state and local governments are property taxes, 
which make up 19 percent of receipts and are levied on property owners as a per￾centage of the estimated value of the land and structures. 
State and local governments are also able to impose personal and corporate 
income taxes. In many cases, these taxes are like federal income taxes. In others, 
the rules are different. For example, some states tax income from wages less heav￾ily than income earned as interest and dividends. Some states do not tax personal 
income at all.

At 14 percent of receipts, sales taxes are also big revenue raisers. They are levied 
as a percentage of the total amount spent at retail stores. Every time customers 
buy something, they pay an extra amount that retailers remit to the government. 
(Some states exclude certain items that are considered necessities, such as food and 
clothing.) Similar to sales taxes are excise taxes, which are levied on specific goods, 
such as gasoling, cigarettes, or alcoholic beverages. Excise taxes make up 7 percent 
of state and local receipts. 
State and local governments also receive substantial funds from the federal gov￾ernment. To some extent, the federal government’s policy of sharing its revenue 
with state governments redistributes money from high-income states (which pay 
more taxes) to low-income states (which receive more benefits). Often, these funds 
are tied to programs that the federal government wants to subsidize. For example, 
Medicaid, which provides healthcare for low-income individuals, is managed by 
the states but funded largely by the federal government. 
Finally, state and local governments receive receipts from sources included in 
the “other” category in Table 3. These include fees for fishing and hunting licenses, 
tolls from roads and bridges, and fares for public buses and subways.

13-2 Taxes and Efficiency 
The U.S. tax system keeps changing as lawmakers embrace different approaches to 
raising revenue. If we were starting from scratch, how might we design a good tax 
system in principle? The primary aim is to fund the government, but there are many 
ways to do that. When choosing among alternative taxes, it is useful to consider 
two objectives: efficiency and equity. 
Omne tax system is more efficient than another if it raises the same amount of 
revenue at a smaller cost to taxpayers. What are the costs of taxes to taxpayers? 
The most obvious is the tax payment itself, which is an inevitable feature of any 
tax system. But there are two other costs, which well-designed tax policy avoids 
or, at least, minimizes: 
¢ The deadweight losses that result when taxes distort the decisions people make 
¢ The administrative burdens imposed on taxpayers as they comply with the 
tax laws 
An efficient tax system is one that has small deadweight losses and small admin￾istrative burdens.

13-2a Deadweight Losses 
One of the Ten Principles of Economics is that people respond to incentives, and 
this includes incentives provided by the tax system. If the government taxes ice 
cream, people tend to eat less ice cream and more frozen yogurt. If the government 
taxes housing, people are likely to live in smaller houses and spend more on other 
things. If the government taxes labor earnings, people will be inclined to work less 
and enjoy more leisure. 
Because taxes distort incentives, they often entail deadweight losses, a phenom￾enon explained in Chapter 8. The deadweight loss of a tax is defined as the reduction 
in market participants’ well-being in excess of the revenue raised for the govern￾ment. In other words, the deadweight loss is the inefficiency that arises as people 
allocate resources according to tax incentives rather than the costs and benefits of 
the goods and services being bought and sold. 
Suppose that Khalil is willing to pay $16 for a pizza and Carmen is willing to pay 
$12 for one. The supply of pizza is perfectly elastic at a price of $10 (which ensures 
that producer surplus is zero). If there is no tax on pizza, both Khalil and Carmen 
buy one, and each gets some surplus of value over the amount paid. Khalil’s con￾sumer surplus is $6, and Carmen’s is $2, for a total of $8. 
Now suppose that the government levies a $4 tax on pizza, which raises the price 
to $14. Khalil still buys a pizza but now has consumer surplus of only $2. Carmen 
doesn’t buy one because now it costs more than it’s worth to her, so her consumer 
surplus is zero. The surplus of the two consumers together falls by $6 (from $8 to 
$2), while the government collects tax revenue of $4 on Khalil’s pizza. The tax has 
a deadweight loss because the decline in consumer surplus exceeds the gain in tax 
revenue. In this case, the deadweight loss is 52. 
Notice that the deadweight loss comes not from Khalil, who pays the tax, but 
from Carmen, who doesn’t. The $4 reduction in Khalil's surplus exactly offsets the 
amount of revenue the government collects. The deadweight loss arises because the 
tax induces Carmen to change her behavior. When the tax raises the price of pizza, 
Carmen is worse off, but there is no offsetting government revenue. This reduction 
in Carmen's welfare is the deadweight loss of the tax. 
Finally, recall that not all taxes that alter incentives lead to deadweight losses. 
As Chapter 10 showed, when there are externalities, a market on its own can lead 
to inefficient outcomes, and the right tax can correct the problem. For example, if 
the wafting smell of pizza baking in a brick oven makes passersby hungry and 
unhappy, perhaps because it reminds them that pizza is delicious but not very 
healthy, a tax on pizza could conceivably enhance efficiency. Corrective taxes also 
raise tax revenue, which can be used to reduce taxes that create deadweight losses. 
Should Income or Consumption Be Taxed? 
When taxes cause people to change their behavior—such as induc￾ing Carmen to buy less pizza—the taxes can make the allocation of 
resources less efficient. Much government revenue comes from the 
personal income tax, and a case study in Chapter 8 discussed how this tax dis￾courages some people from working as hard as they otherwise might. That's not 
the end of the story, though. This tax causes another inefficiency: It discourages 
people from saving. 
Consider Sammy Saver, a 25-year-old deciding whether to save $1,000. If Sammy 
puts this money in a savings account that earns 6 percent and leaves it there, he 
will have $10,286 when he retires at age 65. Yet if the government taxes one-fourth 
of his interest income each year, the effective interest rate is only 4.5 percent.

After 40 years of earning 4.5 percent, the $1,000 grows to only $5,816, which is 
43 percent less than what it would have been without taxation. That's why taxes on 
interest income make saving less attractive. 
Some economists advocate eliminating the tax system’s disincentive toward 
saving. Rather than taxing the amount of income that people carn, the government 
could tax the amount that people spend. Under this proposal, all income that is 
saved is free from taxation until the saving is later spent. This alternative system, 
called a consumption tax, would not distort people’s saving decisions. 
Some provisions of current law already make the system a bit like a consumption 
tax. People can put a limited amount of their income into tax-sheltered accounts, 
like Individual Retirement Accounts and 401(k) plans. This income, along with 
the accumulated interest it earns, avoids taxation until the money is withdrawn 
at retirement. For people who do most of their saving through these retirement 
accounts, their tax bill is, in effect, based on their consumption rather than their 
income. 
European countries often favor consumption taxes. Most of them raise a signifi￾cant amount of government revenue through a value-added tax, or a VAT. A VAT 
is like the retail sales tax that many U.S. states use. But rather than collecting all of 
the tax at the retail level when the consumer buys the final good, the government 
collects the tax in stages as the item is being produced (that is, as value is added 
along the chain of production). 
Some U.S. policymakers have proposed that the US. tax code move further in 
the direction of taxing consumption rather than income. In 2005, the economist 
Alan Greenspan, then chair of the Federal Reserve, offered this advice to a presi￾dential commission on tax reform: “As you know, many economists believe that 
a consumption tax would be best from the perspective of promoting economic 
growth—particularly if one were designing a tax system from scratch—because 
a consumption tax is likely to encourage saving and capital formation. However, 
getting from the current tax system to a consumption tax raises a challenging set of 
transition issues.” @ 
13-2b Administrative Burden 
Many people would place the task of filling out tax forms toward the bottom of their 
personal list of important but unpleasant chores, somewhere between flossing their 
teeth and cleaning their toilet. The tax system’s administrative burden is a cause 
of inefficiency. It includes not only the time spent filling out forms on deadline but 
also the hours needed throughout the year to keep records for tax purposes and 
the resources the government uses to enforce the tax laws. 
Many people—especially those in higher tax brackets—hire lawyers and accoun￾tants to help with their taxes. These experts in the complex tax laws fill out tax 
forms for their clients and help them arrange their affairs in a way that reduces the 
amount of taxes owed. This behavior is legal tax avoidance, as opposed to illegal 
tax evasion. As the famed jurist Learned Hand put it, “Anyone may arrange his 
affairs so that his taxes shall be as low as possible; he is not bound to choose that 
pattern which best pays the treasury. There is not even a patriotic duty to increase 
one's taxes.” 
Critics of the tax system say that advisers help their clients avoid taxes by taking 
advantage of the detailed provisions of the tax code, often dubbed “loopholes.” In 
some cases, loopholes are congressional mistakes: They arise from ambiguities or 
omissions in the tax laws. More often, they arise because Congress has chosen to

favor specific types of behavior. For example, the federal tax code gives preferential 
treatment to investors in municipal bonds because Congress wanted to make it easier 
for state and local governments to borrow money. To some extent, this provision 
benefits states and localities, but it also benefits taxpayers with higher incomes. Most 
loopholes are well known by those in Congress who make tax policy, but what looks 
like a loophole to one taxpayer may look like a justifiable tax provision to another. 
The resources devoted to complying with the tax laws are themselves a type of 
deadweight loss. The government gets only the amount of taxes paid. By contrast, 
the taxpayer loses not only this amount but also the time and money spent docu￾menting, computing, and avoiding taxes. 
The administrative burden of the tax system could be reduced by simplifying 
the tax laws. Yet simplification is often politically difficult. Most people are ready 
to eliminate the loopholes that benefit others, but few are eager to give up the 
loopholes that they benefit from themselves. In the end, the complexity of the tax 
law results from the political process as taxpayers with their own special interests 
lobby for their causes. 
13-2¢ Marginal Tax Rates versus Average Tax Rates 
When discussing income taxes, economists distinguish between two notions of 
the tax rate: the average and the marginal. The average tax rate is total taxes paid 
divided by total income. The marginal tax rate is the increase in taxes from an 
additional dollar of income. 
For example, suppose that the government taxes 20 percent of the first 550,000 
of income and 50 percent of all income above $50,000. Under this tax, a person who 
makes $60,000 pays a tax of $15,000: 20 percent of the first $50,000 (0.20 > $50,000 = 
$10,000) plus 50 percent of the remaining $10,000 (0.50 x $10,000 = $5,000). In this 
case, the average tax rate is $15,000/$60,000, or 25 percent. But if this person earned 
an additional dollar of income, that dollar would be subject to the 50 percent tax 
rate, so the amount owed to the government would rise by $0.50. 
Thus, the marginal tax rate is 50 percent. 
The marginal and average tax rates each contain a useful 
piece of information. If we are trying to gauge the sacrifice 
made by a taxpayer, the average tax rate is more appropriate 
because it measures the fraction of income paid in taxes. By 
contrast, if we are trying to gauge how the tax system distorts 
incentives, the marginal tax rate is more meaningful. One of the 
Ten Principles of Economics in Chapter 1 is that rational people 
think at the margin. A corollary to this principle is that the 
marginal tax rate measures how much the tax system discour￾ages people from working. If you are thinking about working 
a few more hours, the marginal tax rate determines how much 
the government takes from your additional earnings. It is the 
marginal tax rate, therefore, that determines the deadweight 
loss of an income tax.

“Raising the top federal marginal tax on earned personal 
income to 70 percent (and holding the rest of the current tax 
code, including the top bracket definition, fixed) would raise 
substantially more revenue (federal and state, combined) 
without lowering economic activity.” 
What do economists say? ‘Em.fl. 
Source: IGM Economic Experts Paned, January 16, 2019.256 Part IV The Econamics of the Public Sector 
A lump-sum tax clearly shows the difference between average and marginal 
tax rates. For someone with an income of $40,000, the average tax rate of an $8,000 
lump-sum tax is 20 percent; for a person with an income of $80,000, the average tax 
rate is 10 percent. For both people, the marginal tax rate is zero because nothing is 
owed on an additional dollar of income. 
A lump-sum tax is the most efficient tax possible. Because a person’s decisions 
do not alter the amount owed, the tax does not distort incentives and, therefore, 
does not cause deadweight losses. Because everyone can easily calculate the amount 
owed and because there is no benefit to hiring tax lawyers and accountants, the 
lump-sum tax imposes a minimal administrative burden. 
If lump-sum taxes are so efficient, why are they rare? Because efficiency isn't 
everything. A lump-sum tax would take the same amount from everyone regardless 
of income, and most people would consider that unfair. To explain real-world tax 
systems, we must look at the other major goal of tax policy: equity.

13-3 Taxes and Equity 
Ever since American colonists dumped imported British tea into Boston Harbor, 
tax policy has generated some of the most heated debates in American politics. The 
heat is rarely fueled by questions of efficiency. Instead, it arises from disagreements 
over how the tax burden should be distributed. Russell Long, the Senator from 
Louisiana who had immense influence over federal tax policy from 1948 to 1987, 
once mimicked the public debate with this ditty: 
Don’t tax you. 
Don't tax me. 
Tax that fella behind the tree. 
Of course, if we rely on the government to provide some of the goods and services 
we want, someone must pay taxes to fund those goods and services. How should 
the burden of taxes be divided among the population? How do we evaluate whether

a tax system is fair? Everyone agrees that the tax system should be equitable, but 
there is much disagreement about how to make it so. 
13-3a The Benefits Principle 
The benefits principle of taxation states that people should pay taxes based on 
what they receive from government services. This approach tries to make public 
goods like private goods. It seems fair that a person who often eats ice cream pays 
more in total for ice cream than a person who rarely eats it. Similarly, according to 
this principle, a person who gets great benefit from a public good should pay more 
for it than a person who gets little benefit. 
The gasoline tax, for instance, is sometimes justified using the benefits principle. 
In some states, revenues from a gas tax are used to build and maintain roads, and 
interstate highways are maintained, in part, from revenues from the federal gas 
tax. Because those who buy gas are the same people who use the roads, the gas 
tax might be viewed as a fair way to pay for this government service. (The recent 
spread of electric cars, however, has made the gas tax less well targeted, leading 
some policymakers to suggest a miles-driven tax instead.) 
The benefits principle can also be used to argue that wealthy citizens should pay 
higher taxes than poorer ones. Why? Simply because the wealthy benefit more from 
public services. Consider, for example, the benefits of police protection from theft. 
Property owners with much to protect benefit more from the police than do people 
with less to protect. Therefore, a{:cc'.irding to the benefits principle, the wealthy should 
contribute more to the cost of maintaining the police force. The same argument can 
be used for many other public services, such as fire protection, national defense, 
and the court system. 
It is even possible to use the benefits principle to argue for antipoverty programs 
funded by taxes on the wealthy. As Chapter 11 discussed, people may prefer living 
in a society without poverty, suggesting that antipoverty programs are a public 
good. If the wealthy place a greater dollar value on this public good than members 
of the middle class do, perhaps just because the wealthy have more to spend, then 
according to the benefits principle, they should be taxed more heavily to pay for 
these programs. 
13-3b The Ability-to-Pay Principle 
Another way to evaluate the equity of a tax system is called the ability-to-pay 
principle, which states that taxes should be levied according to how well a person 
can shoulder the burden. It is sometimes said that everyone should make an “equal 
sacrifice” to support the government. The magnitude of a person’s sacrifice, how￾ever, depends not only on the size of his tax payment but also on his income and 
other circumstances: A 51,000 tax paid by a person with a low income may require 
a larger sacrifice than a $10,000 tax paid by a person with a much higher income. 
The ability-to-pay principle leads to two corollary notions: vertical equity and 
horizontal equity. Vertical equity states that taxpayers with a greater ability to 
pay should contribute a larger amount. Horizontal equity states that taxpayers 
with similar abilities to pay should contribute the same amount. These notions of 
equity are widely accepted, but applying them to evaluate a tax system is rarely 
straightforward. 
Vertical Equity If taxes are based on the ability to pay, then the rich should pay 
more than the poor. But how much more should the rich ]}a_'_f? The debate over tax 
policy often focuses on this question.

Consider the three tax systems in Table 4. In each case, taxpayers with higher 
incomes pay more. Yet the systems differ in how quickly taxes rise with income. 
The first system is proportional because all taxpayers pay the same fraction of 
income. The second is regressive because high-income taxpayers pay a smaller 
fraction of their income, even though they pay a larger amount. The third sys￾tem is progressive because high-income taxpayers pay a larger fraction of their 
income. 
Which of these three tax systems is most fair? Economic theory alone does not 
offer an answer. Equity, like beauty, is in the eye of the beholder. As the next case 
study shows, the U S. tax system is generally progressive, reflecting the consensus 
view that those with higher incomes should pay a larger percentage of their income 
in taxes. 
How the Tax Burden Is Distributed 
The debate over tax policy often concerns whether those with high 
incomes pay their fair share. There is no objective way to make this 
judgment. In evaluating the issue for yourself, however, it is useful 
to know how much families with different incomes pay under the current tax 
system.

going to press, and were tabulated by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). They 
include all federal taxes—personal income taxes, payroll taxes, corporate income 
taxes, and excise taxes—but not state and local taxes. 
To construct the table, households are ranked according to their income and 
placed into five groups of equal size, called quintiles. The table also presents data 
on the richest 1 percent of Americans (who represent the top sliver of the highest 
quintile). The second column of the table shows the average market income of each 
group. Market income measures what a household earns from its economic activity, 
including wages and salaries, business income, interest, capital gains, dividends, 
and pension benefits. The lowest quintile had average market income of $16,600, 
and the highest quintile had average market income of $310,000. The top 1 percent 
had average market income of almost $2 million. 
The third column of the table shows total taxes as a percentage of income (the 
average tax rate). As you can see, the U.S. federal tax system is progressive. The 
lowest quintile of households paid about zero percent of their incomes in taxes: 
That's because the taxes they paid, such as the payroll tax, were offset by tax rebates 
they received, such as the earned income tax credit. The middle quintile paid 
15.5 percent of their income in taxes. The highest quintile paid 25.4 percent, and the 
top 1 percent paid 30.3 percent. 
These numbers on taxes are a good starting point for understanding how 
the burden of government is distributed, but they give an in-cn}mplete picture. 
Money flows not only from households to the government in the form of taxes 
but also from the government back to households in the form of transfer pay￾ments, including Social Security, unemployment insurance benefits, Medicare 
(a health program for older Americans), Medicaid (a health program for 
those with low incomes), SNAP benefits (a program formerly known as food 
stamps), and housing assistance. In some ways, transfer payments are the 
opposite of taxes. 
Treating transfers as negative taxes substantially alters the distribution of 
the tax burden, as shown in the last column of the table. The change is small 
for high-income households: The highest quintile paid 21.3 percent of its 
income to the government, even after transfers are subtracted, and the top 
1 percent paid 29.7 percent. But the average tax rates for the lowest three 
quintiles become negative numbers. That is, typical households in the bot￾tom three-fifths of the income distribution received more in transfers than 
they paid in taxes. This is particularly true for those with the lowest incomes. 
While the lowest quintile had average market income of only 516,600, its aver￾age income after taxes and transfers was $37,700. The lesson is clear: To fully 
understand the progressivity of government policies, one must consider both 
what people pay and what they receive. 
Finally, note that the numbers in Table 5 may be out of date. In 2021, President 
Biden proposed increasing taxes for those with the highest incomes and expanding 
tax credits for lower-income households with children. @ 
Horizontal Equity If taxes are based on ability to pay, then similar taxpayers 
should pay similar amounts of taxes. But families differ in many ways. To judge 
whether a tax code is horizontally equitable, one must first decide which differences 
are relevant for a family's ability to pay and which are not. 
Suppose the Garcia and Jackson families each have annual income of $100,000. 
The Garcias have no children, but Mr. Garcia has an illness that results in medical 
expenses of $30,000. The Jacksons are in good health, but they have three children,

two of whom are in college, generating tuition bills of $60,000. Would it be fair for 
these two families to pay the same tax because they have the same income? Would 
it be fair to give the Garcias a tax break to help them offset their high medical 
expenses? Would it be fair to give the Jacksons a tax break to help them with their 
tuition expenses? 
These questions do not have easy answers. In practice, the U.S. tax code is filled 
with special provisions that alter a family’s tax obligations based on its specific 
circumstances. 
13-3¢ Tax Incidence and Tax Equity 
Tax incidence—the study of who bears the burden of taxes—is central to evaluating 
tax equity. As Chapter 6 pointed out, the person who bears the burden of a tax is not 
always the person who gets the tax bill from the government. Because taxes alter 
supply and demand, they alter equilibrium prices. As a result, they affect people 
beyond those who, according to statute, pay the tax. When evaluating the vertical 
and horizontal equity of any tax, it is important to take these indirect effects into 
account. 
Many discussions of tax equity ignore the indirect effects of taxes and are based 
on what economists mockingly call the flypaper theory of tax incidence. According 
to this theory, the burden of a tax, like a fly on flypaper, sticks wherever it first lands. 
This assumption, however, is rarely valid. 
For example, a person not trained in economics might argue that a tax on expen￾sive fur coats is vertically equitable because most buyers of furs are wealthy. Yet if 
these buyers can easily substitute other luxuries for furs, then a tax on furs might 
only reduce the sale of furs. In the end, the burden of the tax will fall more on those 
who make and sell furs than on those who buy them. Because most workers who 
make furs are not wealthy, the equity of a fur tax could be quite different from what 
the flypaper theory indicates. 
Who Pays the Corporate Income Tax? 
The corporate income tax provides a good example of the impor￾tance of tax incidence for tax policy. The corporate tax is popular 
among some voters. After all, corporations are not people. Voters 
are always eager to get a tax cut and let some imper￾sonal corporation pick up the tab. 
But before deciding that the corporate income tax 
is a good way for the government to raise revenue, 
consider who bears the burden of the corporate tax. 
This is a difficult question on which economists dis￾agree, but one thing is certain: People pay all taxes. 
When the government levies a tax on a corporation, 
the corporation is more like a tax collector than a 
taxpayer. The burden of the tax ultimately falls on 
people—the owners, customers, or workers of the 
corporation. 
Why might workers and customers pay part of the 
corporate income tax? Consider an example. Suppose 
that the U.5. government decides to raise the tax on the

the companies’ owners, who receive less after-tax profit. But over time, these own￾ers will respond to the tax. Because producing cars is less profitable, they invest less 
in building new car factories. Instead, they invest their wealth in other ways—for 
example, by buying larger houses or by building factories in other industries or 
countries. With fewer domestic car factories, the supply of cars declines, as does the 
demand for autoworkers. A tax on corporations making cars causes the price of cars 
to rise and the wages of autoworkers to fall. 
This issue rose to prominence in the early days of the Trump administration. 
The tax bill signed into law by President Trump in 2017 cut the corporate tax rate 
from 35 to 21 percent. The president’s economic advisers argued that the long-term 
effect of the policy would be increased capital accumulation, productivity, and 
wages. Critics of the bill agreed that these growth effects would occur but believed 
they would be small. In their view, the main benefits of the corporate tax cut would 
accrue to the corporations’ owners, who tend to be wealthy. Yet advocates and crit￾ics agreed on this: Evaluating the fairness of any tax change requires paying careful 
attention to tax incidence. @

13-4 Conclusion: The Trade-Off between 
Equity and Efficiency 
Equity and efficiency are the two most important goals of a tax system. But 
these two goals can conflict, especially when equity is judged by progressivity. 
People often disagree about tax policy because they attach different weights to 
these goals. 
The history of tax policy shows how political leaders differ in their views on equity 
and efficiency. When Ronald Reagan was elected president in 1980, the marginal tax 
rate on the earnings of the richest Americans was 50 percent. On interest income, 
the marginal tax rate was 70 percent. Reagan argued that such high tax rates greatly

The United States does not have a 
valne-added tax, but the tax is com￾mon throughout the rest of the world. 
How about This? A Tax That 
Discourages Tax Evasion 
By Seema Jayachandran 
ou may not like paying taxes, but your bur￾den will be even higher if others don’t pay 
their fair share. 
That, in a nutshell, goes a long way toward 
explaining why a value-added tax, or VAT, is 
used by just about every major country in the 
world except the United States. 
Although the concept has never caught 
on in this country, the VAT has been a power￾ful, well-mannered weapon for progress. That 
is especially true in less-affluent nations, 
because it reduces tax evasion in a relatively 
effective and gentle way, as an emerging body 
of research shows. 
Rich countries collect 34 percent of gross 
domestic product in taxes on average (the 
United States collects about 27 percent). But 
most low- and middle-income countries—a 
range of places, from Mali to Malaysia—col￾lect much less, typically just 10 to 20 percent 
of G.D.P. The main reason is that it is harder 
to collect taxes in less-advanced nations, 
where a larger share of economic activity 
is informal, making tax evasion easier. Yet 
tax revenue, which enables governments 
to provide public goods like roads and 
schools, is at least as important in poorer 
countries. 
Enter the VAT, which taxes personal income 
indirectly by collecting it from businesses. A 
value-added tax also has a built-in, self￾enforcing feature. 
Here is how it warks. 
At its most basic, a VAT taxes the value a 
business adds to a good or service as it is being 
produced. The added value may be thought of 
as the price at which the business sells its 
product minus the cost of producing it. 
For example, a wholesale bakery earns 
revenue by selling bread to grocery stores. 
Subtract from that the bakery’s spending on 
flour, yeast and other ingredients. The differ￾ence is the added value on which the bakery 
is taxed. In addition, the flour company would 
pay a VAT on the revenue from its flour minus 
what it pays for wheat and the like. 
When you tally the value added at every 
stop on the supply chain, from wheat farmer 
to bread eater, you get the retail price of the 
bread. Thus a VAT is a tax on consumption and 
it can be easier to administer than a personal 
income tax. 
For one thing, the government collects the 
VAT from businesses (of which there are rela￾tively few) rather than households (of which 
there are many). For another, especially in 
less-advanced economies, personal income 
tax systems are rife with problems because 
s0 many people are self-employed, with latitude 
to fudge their reported income. 
In the United States, the Internal Revenue 
Service estimates, self-employment and farm 
income are underreported by over 60 percent. 
Even so, the personal income tax system in the 
United States works pretty well because most 
people have an employer. That's not the case 
in many other countries. 
A VAT resembles a sales tax, with an impor￾tant difference: It is paid at every stage of produc￾tion, not just the point of sale. That makes a VAT 
marvelously self-enforcing, because one firm's 
tax deductions are another firm's tax liability. 
When the baker buys flour, it is in her 
financial interest to inform the tax authority 
distorted incentives to work and save. In other words, he claimed that these high 
tax rates cost too much in terms of efficiency. Reagan signed into law large cuts in 
tax rates in 1981 and then again in 1986. When Reagan left office in 1989, the top 
marginal tax rate was only 28 percent. 
When Bill Clinton ran for president in 1992, he argued that the rich were not pay￾ing their fair share of taxes. In other words, the low tax rates on the rich violated his 
view of vertical equity. In 1993, President Clinton signed into law a bill that raised 
the top marginal tax rate to about 40 percent. 
In the years that followed, the pendulum of political debate continued to swing. 
President George W. Bush reprised many of Reagan’s themes and reduced the

about the purchase, so that she can deduct 
the cost from her tax base. That informa￾tion alerts the tax authority about the flour 
producer's income, 
These theoretical advantages are well 
known, but Dina Pomeranz, an economist at 
the University of Zurich, found a way to test 
how important they are in practice. In a study 
published in the American Economic Review in 
2015, she collaborated with the tax autharity in 
Chile, using the prospect of audits to uncover 
where fraud was rampant. 
The Chilean tax authority sent letters to a 
randomly selected set of firms, all of which were 
required to pay a VAT, informing them that they 
were under special scrutiny. Professor Pomeranz 
found that after the letters were received, the 
reporting of business-to-business sales hardly 
budged, suggesting that income was already 
being reported accurately. 
In contrast, businesses like grocery stores 
that sold to consumers started reporting more 
income and paying maore VAT, 
Why was there a difference? With a VAT, 
there is a last-mile problem: A store customer 
buying bread had no incentive to ask for a receipt, 
because she couldn't deduct the cost from her 
income as businesses could, so many business￾to-consumer transactions were undemeported. 
Governments have tried to solve the last￾mile problem by adding a reward for custom￾Source: NMew rork Times, May 19, 2014 
ers who ask for a receipt. The state of Sao 
Paulo, Brazil, started a program in 2007 that 
gave customers a rebate of roughly 1 percent 
on their retail receipts. (To make the program 
more enticing, some of the rebate is in the 
form of raffle tickets for prizes worth up to 
$500,000.) 
Retailers had to submit the receipts to the 
tax authority, and consumers in S&o Paulo could 
check online whether stores had submitted their 
receipts and complain to the tax authority if 
they hadn't. In essence, shoppers were enlisted 
as citizen tax auditors. 
The Brazilian program succeeded in 
increasing tax collection among retailers 21 
percent, according to a research study by Joana 
Maritomi at the London School of Economics 
that analyzed the program'’s first four years 
and is scheduled to appear in the American 
Economic Review. 
The success of VAT systems in emerging 
economies is welcome news for the beneficia￾ries of that tax revenue. It might be useful one 
day in the United States, too, and for another 
reason. Because a VAT taxes consumption, 
rather than income, it tends to encourage 
saving and investment, 
It has its prablems, too. A big one is that it 
is regressive. If you have barely enough money 
to get by, you can't afford to save: Your entire 
income is spent on essentials and, thus, taxed. 
Richer people are taxed on a much smaller 
share of their income. 
But a VAT can be paired with progressive 
tax policies, like a tax credit for low-income 
people, that counterbalance this deficiency, 
as argued by William Gale of the Brookings 
Institution in his book “Fiscal Therapy.” 
Inthe end, a VAT's major advantage is that 
it can bring in a great deal of revenue with 
comparatively little administrative cost and 
without as much need for intrusive enforce￾ment. It could be an appealing option for the 
United States one day. B

Economics alone cannot determine the best way to balance the goals of effi￾ciency and equity. This issue involves political philosophy as well as economics. 
But economists have an important role in this debate: They can shed light on the 
trade-offs that society inevitably faces when designing the tax system and can help 
avoid policies that sacrifice efficiency without enhancing equity.

The efficiency of a tax system involves the costs it 
imposes on taxpayers. There are two costs of taxes

the government. The first is the deadweight loss that

Previous chapters used the supply curve to summarize firms’ 
production decisions. According to the law of supply, firms are 
willing to produce and sell a greater quantity of a good when its 
price is higher. This response leads to an upward-sloping supply 
curve. For many questions, the law of supply is all you need to 
know about firm behavior. 
This chapter and the ones that follow examine firm behavior in 
more detail. This topic will give you a better understanding of the 
decisions behind the supply curve. It will also introduce you to a

firms’ decisions about prices and quantities depend on the market conditions they 
face. The town in which you live, for instance, may have several pizzerias but only 
one cable television company. This raises a key question: How does the number of 
firms affect the prices in a market and the efficiency of the market outcome? The 
field of industrial organization addresses this question. 
Before turning to these issues, it’s important to understand the costs of produc￾tion. All firms, from Delta Air Lines to your local deli, incur costs while making 
the goods and services they sell. As the coming chapters show, a firm’s costs are a 
key determinant of its production and pricing decisions. This chapter defines the

A word of warning: This topic is a bit technical. To be frank, you might even call 
it boring. Hang in there. This material provides the foundation for the fascinating 
topics that follow.

Enter Chloe’s Cookie Factory. Chloe, the owner, bakes irresistible cookies. To do 
s0, she buys flour, sugar, chocolate chips, and other cookie ingredients. She also 
buys mixers and ovens and hires workers to run this equipment for her. She then 
sells the cookies to grateful consumers. Some of the issues that Chloe faces in her 
business apply to all firms. 
14-1a Total Revenue, Total Cost, and Profit 
To understand the decisions a firm makes, let's begin by asking what it is trying to do. 
Chloe may have started her firm because of an altruistic desire to provide the world 
with cookies or simply out of love for the cookie business, but the truth, in her case, is 
that she started it to make money. Economists typically assume that the goal of a firm 
is to maximize profit, and they find that this assumption works well in most cases. 
What is a firm’s profit? The amount that it receives for the sale of its output 
(cookies) is total revenue. The amount that it pays to buy inputs (flour, sugar, 
workers, ovens, and so forth) is total cost. As the business owner, Chloe gets to 
keep any revenue above her costs. That is, a firm’s profit equals its total revenue 
minus its total cost: 
Profit = Total revenue — Total cost. 
Chloe wants to make her profit as large as possible. 
To see how a firm maximizes profit, the first step is to measure its total revenue 
and total cost. Total revenue is simple: It is the quantity of output the firm produces 
multiplied by the sales price. If Chloe produces 10,000 cookies and sells them at 
%2 a cookie, her total revenue 1s $20,000. The measurement of a firm’s total cost, 
however, 1s more subtle. 
14-1b Why Opportunity Costs Matter 
When measuring costs at Chloe’s Cookie Factory or any other firm, keep in mind 
one of the Ten Principles of Economics from Chapter 1: The cost of something is 
what you give up to get it. Recall that the opportunity cost of an item refers to all 
the things that must be forgone to acquire it. When economists speak of a firm's 
cost of production, they include all the opportunity costs of making its output of 
goods and services.

Some of these opportunity costs are obvious. When Chloe pays $1,000 for flour, 
that $1,000 is an opportunity cost because Chloe can no longer use that 51,000 to 
buy something else. Similarly, when Chloe hires workers to make the cookies, their 
wages are part of the firm's costs. Because these opportunity costs require the firm 
to pay out some money, they are called explicit costs. 
By contrast, some of a firm's opportunity costs, called implicit costs, do not require 
a cash outlay. These costs may not be immediately obvious, but they are nonetheless 
meaningful. Imagine that Chloe is good with computers and could earn $100 per hour 
working as a programmer. For every hour that she works at her cookie factory, she 
gives up $100 in programming income, and this forgone income is also part of her 
costs. The total cost of Chloe’s business is the sum of her explicit and implicit costs. 
Economists and accountants analyze businesses differently. Economists are inter￾ested in how firms make production and pricing decisions. Because these decisions 
are based on both explicit and implicit costs, economists include both when mea￾suring a firm'’s costs. But accountants keep track of the money that flows into and 
out of firms, so they measure the explicit costs but usually ignore the implicit ones. 
The difference between the methods of economists and accountants is easy to see 
at Chloe’s Cookie Factory. When Chloe gives up the opportunity to earn money as 
a programmer, her accountant will not count this as a cost of her cookie business. 
Because no money flows out of the business to pay for this cost, it never appears 
on the accountant’s financial statements. An economist, however, will count the 
forgone income as a cost because it will affect the decisions that Chloe makes in her 
cookie business. For example, if Chloe’s wage as a programmer rises from $100 to 
$300 per hour, she might decide that running her cookie business is too costly. She 
might choose to shut down the factory so she can work as a programmer. 
14-1¢ The Cost of Capital Is an Opportunity Cost 
An implicit cost of almost every business is the opportunity cost of the money— 
economists call it financial capital—that has been invested in it. Suppose, for instance, 
that Chloe used $300,000 of her savings to buy the cookie factory. If she had instead 
left this money in a savings account that paid an interest rate of 5 percent, she 
would have earned $15,000 per year. To own her cookie factory, therefore, Chloe 
has given up $15,000 a year in interest income. This forgone $15,000 is one of the 
implicit opportunity costs of Chloe’s business. 
The cost of capital is a prime case in which economists and accountants view 
businesses differently. An economist views the $15,000 in interest income that Chloe 
gives up every year as an implicit cost. Chloe’s accountant, however, will not show 
this $15,000 as a cost because no money flows out of the business to pay for it. 
To further explore the difference between the methods of economists and accoun￾tants, let’s change the example slightly. Suppose that Chloe did not have the entire 
$300,000 to buy the factory but instead, used $100,000 of her own savings and 
borrowed $200,000 from a bank at an interest rate of 5 percent. Chloe’s accountant, 
who only measures explicit costs, will now count the $10,000 interest paid on the 
bank loan every year as a cost because this money flows out of the firm. By con￾trast, according to an economist, the opportunity cost of owning the business is still 
$15,000. The opportunity cost equals the interest on the bank loan (an explicit cost 
of $10,000) plus the forgone interest on savings (an implicit cost of $5,000). 
14-1d Economists and Accountants Measure Profit Differently 
Now let’s return to the firm's objective: profit. Economists and accountants measure 
this differently, too. An economist measures a firm's economic profit as its total 
explicit costs 
input costs that require 
an outlay of money by 
the firm 
implicit costs 
input costs that do not 
require an outlay of 
maney by the firm 
economic profit 
total revenue minus total 
cost, including both 
explicit and implicit 
costs

revenue minus all its opportunity costs (explicit and implicit) of producing the 
goods and services sold. An accountant measures the firm’s accounting profit as 
its total revenue minus only its explicit costs. 
Figure 1 summarizes this difference. Notice that because the accountant ignores 
the implicit costs, accounting profit is larger than economic profit. For a business 
to be profitable from an economist’s standpoint, total revenue must exceed all the 
opportunity costs, both explicit and implicit. 
Economic profit is an important concept because it motivates the firms that sup￾ply goods and services. As we will see, a firm that makes positive economic profit 
will stay in business. It is covering all its opportunity costs and has some revenue 
left to reward the firm's owners. When a firm makes economic losses (that is, when 
economic profits are negative), it is failing to bring in enough revenue to cover all 
the costs of production. Unless conditions change, the owners will eventually close 
the business and exit the industry. To understand business decisions, keep an eye 
on economic profit.

14-2 Production and Costs 
Firms incur costs when they buy inputs to produce the goods and services they plan 
to sell. This section examines the link between a firm’s production process and its 
total cost. Once again, consider Chloes Cookie Factory. 
The analysis that follows makes a simplifying assumption: The size of Chloe’s 
factory is fixed, and Chloe can vary the quantity of cookies produced only by chang￾ing the number of workers she employs. This assumption is realistic in the short 
run but not in the long run. That is, Chloe cannot build a larger factory overnight, 
but she could do so over the next year or two. This analysis, therefore, describes the 
production decisions that Chloe faces in the short run. The relationship between 
costs and time horizon is examined more fully later in the chapter. 
14-2a The Production Function 
Table 1 shows how the quantity of cookies produced per hour at Chloe's factory 
depends on the number of workers. As you can see in columns (1) and (2), if there 
are no workers in the factory, Chloe produces no cookies. When there is 1 worker, 
she produces 50 cookies. When there are 2 workers, she produces 90 cookies and 
so on. Panel (a) of Figure 2 presents a graph of these two columns of numbers. The 
number of workers is on the horizontal axis, and the number of cookies produced 
is on the vertical axis. This relationship between the quantity of inputs (workers) 
and quantity of output (cookies) is called the production function.

Chloe’s Production Function 
and Total-Cost Curve 
The production function in panel (a) shows the relationship between the number of 
workers hired and the quantity of output produced. Here, the number of workers hired 
(on the horizontal axis) is from column (1) in Table 1, and the quantity of output (on the 
vertical axis) is from column (2). The production function gets flatter as the number of 
waorkers increases, reflecting diminishing marginal product. The total-cost curve in panel 
(b) shows the relationship between the quantity of output and total cost of production. 
Here, the quantity of output produced {on the horizontal axis) is from column (2) in 
Table 1, and the total cost (on the vertical axis) is from column (6). The total-cost curve 
gets steeper as the quantity of output increases because of diminishing marginal product.

(cookies per hour) 
One of the Ten Principles of Economics in Chapter 1 is that rational people think 
at the margin. As future chapters show, this idea is the key to understanding the 
decisions a firm makes about how many workers to hire and how much output to 
produce. To take a step toward understanding these decisions, column (3) in the 
table gives the marginal product of a worker. The marginal product of any input 
in the production process is the change in the quantity of output obtained from one 
additional unit of that input. When the number of workers goes from 1 to 2, cookie 
production increases from 50 to 90, so the marginal product of the second worker 
is 40 cookies. When the number of workers goes from 2 to 3, cookie production 
increases from 90 to 120, so the marginal product of the third worker is 30 cookies. 
In the table, the marginal product is shown halfway between two rows because it 
represents the change in output as the number of workers increases from one level 
to another.

Notice that as the number of workers increases, the marginal product declines. 
The second worker has a marginal product of 40 cookies, the third has a marginal 
product of 30 cookies, and the fourth has a marginal product of 20 cookies. This 
property is called diminishing marginal product. At first, when there are only a few 
workers at the factory, they have easy access to the kitchen equipment. As Chloe 
increases hiring, the workers must share equipment and deal with more crowded 
conditions. Eventually, the kitchen becomes so overcrowded that workers get in 
each other’s way. Hence, as more workers are hired, each extra worker contributes 
fewer additional cookies to total production. 
Diminishing marginal product is apparent in Figure 2. The production function’s 
slope (“rise over run”) measures the change in Chloe’s output of cookies (“rise”) for 
each additional input of labor (“run”). That is, the slope of the production function 
measures the marginal product. As the number of workers increases, the marginal 
product declines, and the production function becomes flatter. 
14-2b From the Production Function to the Total-Cost Curve 
Columns (4), (5), and (6) in Table 1 show Chloe’s cost of producing cookies. In this 
example, the cost of Chloe’s factory is $30 per hour, and the cost of hiring a worker 
is $10 per hour. If she hires 1 worker, her total cost is $40 per hour. If she hires 2, 
her total cost is $50 per hour, and so on. This information ties things together. The 
table shows how the number of workers hired determines the quantity of cookies 
produced and the total cost of production. 
The goal of the next several chapters is to study firms’ production and pricing 
decisions. For this purpose, the most important relationship in Table 1 is between 
quantity produced [in column (2)] and total cost [in column (6)]. Panel (b) of Figure 
2 graphs these two columns of data with quantity produced on the horizontal axis 
and total cost on the vertical axis. This graph is called the total-cost curve. 
Now compare the total-cost curve in panel (b) with the production function in 
panel (a). These two curves are opposite sides of the same coin. The total-cost curve 
grows steeper as the amount produced rises, while the production function becomes 
flatter as production rises. These changes in slope occur for the same reason. High 
production of cookies means that Chloe's kitchen is crowded with workers. In this 
case, because of diminishing marginal product, each additional worker adds little to 
production. That’s why the production function is relatively flat. But flip this logic 
around: When the kitchen is crowded, producing an additional cookie requires a 
lot mare labor, which is costly. Therefore, when the quantity produced is large, the 
total-cost curve is relatively steep.

14-3 The Many Measures of Cost 
The analysis of Chloe’s Cookie Factory showed how a firm'’s total cost reflects its 
production function. From data on total cost, we can derive several related measures 
of cost that will be later useful in analyzing production and pricing decisions. Now, 
consider the example in Table 2, which presents cost data on Chloe’s neighbor— 
Caleb’s Coffee Shop. 
Column (1) in the table shows the number of cups of coffee that Caleb might 
produce, ranging from 0 to 10 cups per hour. Column (2) shows Caleb’s total cost 
of producing coffee. Figure 3 plots Caleb’s total-cost curve. The quantity of coffee 
[from column (1)] is on the horizontal axis, and total cost [from column (2)] is on 
the vertical axis. Caleb’s total-cost curve has a shape like Chloe’s. In particular,

it becomes steeper as the quantity produced rises, which (as we have discussed) 
reflects diminishing marginal product. 
14-3a Fixed and Variable Costs 
Caleb's total cost can be divided into two types. Fixed costs do not vary with the 
quantity of output produced. They are incurred even if the firm produces nothing at 
all. Caleb's fixed costs include rent, which is the same regardless of how much coffee 
he produces. Similarly, if Caleb needs to hire a full-time bookkeeper to pay bills, 
regardless of the quantity of coffee produced, the bookkeeper’s salary is a fixed cost. 
The third column in Table 2 shows Caleb’s fixed cost, which in this example is $3.00. 
On the other hand, variable costs change as the firm alters the quantity of output 
produced. Caleb’s variable costs include the cost of coffee beans, milk, sugar, and 
paper cups: The more coffee Caleb produces, the more of these items he needs to 
buy. Similarly, if Caleb has to hire more workers to make more cups of coffee, the 
salaries of these workers are variable costs. Column (4) in the table shows Caleb’s 
variable cost. The variable cost is (0 if he produces nothing, $0.30 if he produces 
1 cup of coffee, $0.80 if he produces 2 cups, and so on. 
A firm’s total cost is the sum of fixed and variable costs. In Table 2, total cost in 
column (2) equals fixed cost in column (3) plus variable cost in column (4). 
14-3b Average and Marginal Cost 
As the owner, Caleb decides how much to produce. When making this decision, he 
will want to consider how the level of production affects his costs. Caleb might ask his 
production supervisor the following two questions about the cost of producing coffee: 
¢ How much does it cost to make the typical cup of coffee? 
e How much does it cost to increase production of coffee by 1 cup?

average variable cost

marginal cost 
the increase in total cost 
that arises from an extra 
unit of production 
These questions might seem to have the same answer, but they do not. Both answers 
are important for understanding how firms make production decisions. 
To find the cost of the typical unit produced, divide the firm's costs by the quantity 
of output it produces. For example, if the firm produces 2 cups of coffee per hour, 
its total cost is $3.80, and the cost of the typical cup is 53.80/2, or $1.90. Total cost 
divided by the quantity of output is average total cost. Because total cost is the 
sum of fixed and variable costs, average total cost can be expressed as the sum of 
average fixed cost and average variable cost. Average fixed cost equals the fixed 
cost divided by the quantity of output, and average variable cost equals the vari￾able cost divided by the quantity of output. 
Average total cost tells us the cost of the typical unit, but it does not say how 
much total cost will change as the firm alters its production level. Column (8) in 
Table 2 shows the amount that total cost rises when the firm increases production 
by 1 unit of output. This number is called marginal cost. For example, if Caleb 
increases production from 2 to 3 cups, total cost rises from $3.80 to $4.50, so the 
marginal cost of the third cup of coffee is $4.50 minus $3.80, or $0.70. In the table, 
the marginal cost appears halfway between any two rows because it represents the 
change in total cost as the quantity of output increases from one level to another. 
It is helpful to express these definitions mathematically: 
Average total cost = Total cost/Quantity 
ATC = TC/Q 
and 
Marginal cost = Change in total cost/Change in quantity 
MC = ATC/AQ. 
Here, A, the Greek letter delta, represents the change in a variable. These equations 
show how average total cost and marginal cost are derived from total cost. Average 
total cost tells us the cost of a typical unit of output if total cost is divided evenly 
over all the units produced. Marginal cost tells us the increase in total cost that 
arises from producing an additional unit of output. The next chapter explains 
why business managers like Caleb need to keep in mind the concepts of average 
total cost and marginal cost when deciding how much of their product to supply 
to the market. 
14-3¢ Cost Curves and Their Shapes 
Just as graphs of supply and demand were useful when analyzing the behavior of 
markets, graphs of average and marginal cost will help when analyzing the behavior 
of firms. Figure 4 graphs Caleb’s costs using the data from Table 2. The horizontal 
axis measures the quantity the firm produces, and the vertical axis measures marginal 
and average costs. The graph shows four curves: average total cost (ATC), average

The cost curves shown here for Caleb’s Coffee Shop have some features that are 
common to the cost curves of many firms in the economy. Note three features in 
particular: the shape of the marginal-cost curve, the shape of the average-total-cost 
curve, and the relationship between marginal cost and average total cost. 
Rising Marginal Cost Caleb’s marginal cost rises as the quantity of output pro￾duced increases. This upward slope reflects diminishing marginal product. When

equipment isn't being used. Because he can easily put these idle resources to use, 
the marginal product of an extra worker is large, and the marginal cost of producing 
an extra cup of coffee is small. But when Caleb produces a large quantity of coffee, 
his shop has a lot of workers, and his equipment is busy. If Caleb produces more 
coffee by adding new workers, they will operate in crowded conditions and may 
need to wait to use the equipment. Therefore, when the quantity of coffee produced 
is already high, the marginal product of an extra worker is low, and the marginal 
cost of producing an extra cup of coffee is large. 
U-Shaped Average Total Cost Caleb’s average-total-cost curve in Figure 4 is 
U-shaped: It first falls and then rises. To understand why it takes this shape, remem￾ber that average total cost is the sum of average fixed cost and average variable cost. 
Average fixed cost declines as output rises because the fixed cost is getting spread 
over a larger number of units. But average variable cost usually rises as output 
increases because of diminishing marginal product. 
The U-shape occurs because average total cost reflects the shapes of both aver￾age fixed cost and average variable cost. At very low levels of output, such as 1 
or 2 cups per hour, average total cost is very high. Even though average variable 
cost is low, average fixed cost is high because the fixed cost is spread over only a 
few units. As output increases, the fixed cost is spread over more units. Average 
fixed cost declines rapidly at first and then more slowly. As a result, average total 
cost also declines until the firm’s output reaches 5 cups of coffee per hour, when 
average total cost is $1.30 per cup. When the firm produces more than 6 cups per

hour, however, the increase in average variable cost becomes the dominant force, 
and average total cost starts rising. The tug of war between average fixed cost and 
average variable cost generates the U-shape in average total cost. 
The bottom of the U-shape occurs at the quantity that minimizes average total 
cost. This quantity is sometimes called the efficient scale of the firm. For Caleb, the 
efficient scale is 5 or 6 cups of coffee per hour. If he produces more or less than this 
amount, his average total cost rises above the minimum of $1.30. At lower levels 
of output, average total cost is higher than $1.30 because the fixed cost is spread 
over s0 few units. At higher levels of output, average total cost is higher than $1.30 
because the marginal product of inputs has diminished significantly. At the efficient 
scale, these two forces are balanced to yield the lowest average total cost. 
The Relationship between Marginal Cost and Average Tolal Cost If you look 
at Figure 4 (or back at Table 2), you will see something that may be surprising at 
first. Whenever marginal cost is less than average total cost, average total cost is 
falling. Whenever marginal cost is greater than average total cost, average total 
cost is rising. This feature of Caleb’s cost curves is not a coincidence: It is true for 
all firms. 
To see why, consider an analogy. Average total cost is like your cumulative grade 
point average. Marginal cost is like the grade you get in the next course you take. 
If your grade in vour next course is less than your grade point average, your grade 
point average will fall. If your grade in your next course is higher than your grade 
point average, your grade point average will rise. The mathematics of average and 
marginal costs is exactly the same as the mathematics of average and marginal 
grades. 
This relationship between average total cost and marginal cost has an important 
corollary: The marginal-cost curve crosses the average-total-cost curve at its mini￾mum. Why? At low levels of output, marginal cost is below average total cost, so 
average total cost is falling. But after the two curves cross, marginal cost rises above 
average total cost. As a result, average total cost must start to rise at this level of 
output. That's why this point of intersection is the minimum of average total cost. 
As the next chapter shows, minimum average total cost plays a central role in the 
analysis of competitive firms. 
14-3d Typical Cost Curves 
In the examples so far, the firms have exhibited diminishing marginal product and 
rising marginal cost at all levels of output. This simplifying assumption was useful 
because it allowed us to focus on the features of cost curves that are most important 
in analyzing firm behavior. Yet actual firms are often more complex. In many busi￾nesses, marginal product does not start to fall immediately after the first worker is 
hired. Depending on the production process, the second or third worker might have 
a higher marginal product than the first because a team of workers can divide tasks 
and work more productively than one person. A firm with this pattern would have 
increasing marginal product for a while before diminishing marginal product set in. 
Figure 5 shows the cost curves for such a firm, including average total cost (ATC), 
average fixed cost (AFC), average variable cost (AVC), and marginal cost (MC). At 
low levels of output, the firm experiences increasing marginal product, and the 
marginal-cost curve falls. Eventually, the firm starts to experience diminishing 
marginal product, and the marginal-cost curve starts to rise. This combination of 
increasing then diminishing marginal product also makes the average-variable-cost 
curve U-shaped.

14-4 Costs in the Short Run and in the Long Run 
Earlier in this chapter, we noted that a firm's costs might depend on the time horizon 
under consideration. Let’s examine why this is the case. 
14-4a The Relationship between Short-Run and Long-Run 
Average Total Cost 
For many firms, the division of total costs between fixed and variable costs depends 
on the time horizon. Consider, for instance, a car manufacturer such as Ford Motor 
Company. Over only a few months, Ford cannot adjust the number or sizes of its 
factories. The only way it can produce additional cars is to hire more workers at 
the factories it already has. The cost of these factories is, therefore, a fixed cost in 
the short run. But over several years, Ford can expand its factories’ sizes, build 
new ones, or close old ones. In the long run, its factories represent a variable cost. 
Because many decisions are fixed in the short run but variable in the long run, 
a firm’s long-run and short-run cost curves differ. Figure 6 shows an example. The 
figure presents three short-run average-total-cost curves—for a small, medium, and 
large factory. It also presents the long-run average-total-cost curve. As the firm moves 
along the long-run curve, it adjusts the size of the factory to the quantity of production. 
This graph shows how short-run and long-run costs are related. The long-run 
average-total-cost curve has a much flatter U-shape than the short-run average-total￾cost curve. In addition, all the short-run curves lie on or above the long-run curve, This 
is because firms have greater flexibility in the long run. In essence, in the long run, the 
firm gets to choose which short-run curve it wants. But in the short run, it has to use 
whatever short-run curve it already has, determined by decisions made in the past. 
The figure shows how a change in production alters costs over different time 
horizons. When Ford wants to increase production from 1,000 to 1,200 cars per day, it 
has no choice in the short run but to hire more workers at its existing medium-sized

factory. Because of diminishing marginal product, average total cost rises from 
$10,000 to 512,000 per car. In the long run, however, Ford can expand both the size 
of the factory and its workforce, and average total cost returns to $10,000. 
How long does it take a firm to get to the long run? It depends on the firm. A 
major manufacturer, such as a car company, may need a year or more to build a 
larger factory. But a person running a coffee shop can buy another coffee maker 
within a few days. There is no single answer to how long it takes a firm to adjust 
its production facilities. 
14-4b Economies and Diseconomies of Scale 
The shape of the long-run average-total-cost curve conveys important information 
about a firm's production processes. In particular, it tells us how costs vary with 
the scale—that is, the size—of a firm’s operations. When long-run average total 
cost declines as output increases, there are said to be economies of scale. When 
the opposite occurs and long-run average total cost rises as output increases, there 
are diseconomies of scale. And when long-run average total cost does not vary 
with the level of output, there are constant returns to scale. In Figure 6, Ford has 
economies of scale at low levels of output, constant returns to scale at intermediate 
levels of output, and diseconomies of scale at high levels of output. 
What might cause economies or diseconomies of scale? Economies of scale often 
arise because higher production levels allow specialization among workers, which 
enables them to become better at specific tasks. For instance, if Ford hires a large 
number of workers and produces many cars, it can reduce costs using modern 
assembly-line production. Diseconomies of scale can arise because of coordination 
problems that often occur in large organizations. The more cars Ford produces, the 
more stretched the management team becomes, and the less effective the managers 
become at keeping costs down. 
This analysis shows why long-run average-total-cost curves are often U-shaped.

&4 Jack of all trades, master of none.” This adage means that a person 
thn tries to do everything ends up doing nothing very well, and it 
helps explain the shapes of cost curves. If a firm wants its workers to 
be as productive as possible, it should expect each worker to master a 
limited number of tasks. But this organization of work is possible anly if 
a firm employs many workers and produces a large quantity of output, 
In his book The Wealth of Nations, Adam Smith described a visit he 
made to a pin factory. Smith was impressed by the specialization among 
the workers and the resulting economies of scale. He wrote, 
One man draws out the wire, another straightens it, a third 
cuts it, a fourth points it, a fifth grinds it at the top for receiv￾ing the head; to make the head requires two or three distinct 
operations; to put it on is & peculiar business; to whiten it is 
another; it is even a trade by itself to put them into paper. 
Smith reported that because of this specialization, the factory produced 
thousands of pins per worker every day. He conjectured that if the work￾ers had chosen to work separately, rather than as a team of specialists, 
“they certainly could not each of them make twenty, perhaps not one pin 
a day.” Because of specialization, a large pin factory could achieve higher 
output per worker and lower average cost per pin than a small factory, 
The specialization that Smith observed in the pin factory is common 
in the modern economy. If you want to build a house, you could do all the 
work yourself. But most people these days turn to a builder, who in turn 
hires carpenters, plumbers, electricians, painters, and people in many 
other trades. These workers become better at particular jobs than if they 
were generalists. The use of specialization to achieve economies of scale 
is one reason modern societies are as prosperous as they are, M

advantage of greater specialization, and coordination problems are not yet acute. At 
high levels of production, the benefits of specialization have already been realized, and 
coordination problems become more severe as the firm grows larger. As a result, long-run 
average total cost is falling at low levels of production because of increasing specializa￾tion and rising at high levels of production because of growing coordination problems.

14-5 Conclusion 
This chapter has developed tools to study how firms make production and pricing 
decisions. You should now understand what economists mean by the term costs 
and how costs vary with the quantity of output a firm produces. Table 3 summarizes 
some of the definitions we have encountered. 
By themselves, a firm's cost curves do not tell us what decisions the firm will 
make. But they are a key component of that decision, as the next chapter shows.

* A firm’s goal is to maximize profit, which equals total 
revenue minus total cost. 
* When analyzing a firm’s behavior, it is important to 
include all the opportunity costs of production. Some 
opportunity costs, such as the wages a firm pays its 
workers, are explicit. Others, like the wages the firm 
owner forgoes by not taking another job, are implic￾it. While accounting profit considers only explicit 
costs, economic profit accounts for both explicit and 
implicit costs. 
* A firm’s costs reflect its production process. A typical 
firm's production function gets flatter as the quantity 
of an input increases, displaying the property of dimin￾ishing marginal product. As a result, the total-cost 
curve gels steeper as the quantity produced rises. 
= A firm’s total cost can be separated into fixed costs and 
variable costs. Fixed costs remain constant when the 
firm alters the quantity of output produced. Variable

costs change when the firm alters the quantity of out￾put produced. 
From a firm's total cost, two related measures of cost 
are derived. Average total cost is total cost divided by 
the quantity of output. Marginal cost is the amount by 
which total cost rises if output increases by 1 unit. 
When analyzing firm behavior, it is often useful to 
graph average total cost and marginal cost. For a 
typical firm, marginal cost rises with the quantity of 
output. Average total cost first falls as output increases 
and then rises as output increases further. The 
marginal-cost curve always crosses the average-total￾cost curve at the minimum of average total cost. 
A firm’s costs often depend on the time horizon con￾sidered. In particular, many costs are fixed in the short 
run but variable in the long run. As a result, when the 
firm changes its level of production, average total cost 
may rise more in the short run than in the long run.

J f a local gas station raised its price for gasoline by 20 percent 
and others didn't, its customers would quickly start buying 
8 gasoline elsewhere. By contrast, if a local water company raised 
the price of water by 20 percent, it wouldn’t lose much business. 
People might buy more water-efficient showerheads and, in sub￾urban areas, water their lawns less often, but they would be hard￾pressed to find another source of water. The difference between 
the gasoline market and the water market is that most cities and 
towns have several stations supplying gasoline but only one 
company supplying tap water. This difference in market structure 
shapes the pricing and production decisions of the firms that 
operate in these markets. 
This chapter examines the behavior of competitive firms, such 
as a local gas station. Recall that a market is competitive if each 
buyer and seller is small compared with the size of the market and, 
therefore, has little ability to influence market prices. By contrast, 
a firm that can influence the market price of the good it sells, such 
as a local water company, is said to have market power. The next 
chapter takes up that topic.

Competitive firms are the natural place to begin the study of firm behavior for 
two reasons. First, because competitive firms have negligible influence on mar￾ket prices, they are simpler to understand than those with market power. Second, 
because competitive markets allocate resources efficiently (as Chapter 7 showed), 
they provide a benchmark for comparison with other market structures. 
The analysis of competitive firms in this chapter helps explain the decisions 
behind market supply curves. Not surprisingly, the supply curve in a market is 
closely linked to firms’ costs of production. Less obvious is which among the dif￾ferent types of cost—fixed, variable, average, and marginal—are most relevant for 
its supply decisions. As we will see, all of these cost measures play important and 
interrelated roles in supply decisions. 
15-1 What Is a Competitive Market? 
competitive market 
a market with many 
buyers and sellers trading 
identical products so that 
each buyer and seller is a 
price taker 
Our goal in this chapter is to examine how firms make production decisions in 
competitive markets. Let's begin by reviewing what a competitive market is. 
15-1a The Meaning of Competition 
A competitive market, sometimes called a perfectly competitive market, has two 
characteristics: 
¢ The market has many buyers and many sellers. 
¢ The goods offered by the various sellers are largely the same. 
Under these conditions, the actions of any single buyer or seller have a negli￾gible impact on the market price. Each buyer and seller takes the market price 
as given. 
Consider the market for milk. No single consumer can influence the price of milk 
because each buys a small amount relative to the size of the market. Similarly, each 
dairy farmer has limited control over the price because many other farmers offer 
milk that is essentially identical. Because sellers can sell all they want at the going 
price, none of them has any reason to charge less, and if one of them charges more, 
buyers will go elsewhere. Buyers and sellers in competitive markets must accept 
the price the market determines and are said to be price takers. 
In addition to the previous two conditions for competition, a third condition is 
sometimes said to characterize perfectly competitive markets: 
e Firms can freely enter or exit the market. 
If, for instance, anyone can start a new dairy farm and any existing dairy farmer 
can leave the business, then the dairy industry satisfies this condition. Much of 
the analysis of competitive firms does not require the assumption of free entry 
and exit because firms can be price takers without it. Yet, as we will see, free entry 
and exit is a powerful force that shapes the long-run equilibrium in competitive 
markets. 
15-1b The Revenue of a Competitive Firm 
The standard model of competitive markets assumes that firms aim to maximize 
profit (total revenue minus total cost). To see how they do this, let's start by con￾sidering the revenue of a typical competitive firm: the Vaca Family Dairy Farm.

The Vaca Farm produces a quantity of milk, QQ, and sells each unit at the market 
price, P. The farm's total revenue is P X Q. For example, if a gallon of milk sells for 
$6 and the farm sells 1,000 gallons, its total revenue is $6,000. 
Because the Vaca Farm is small compared with the world market for milk, it 
takes the price given by the market. This means that the price does not depend on 
how much milk the Vaca Farm produces and sells. If the Vacas double what they 
produce to 2,000 gallons, the price remains the same, and their total revenue doubles 
to $12,000. Total revenue is proportional to output. 
Table 1 shows the revenue for the Vaca Family Dairy Farm. Columns (1) and (2) 
show the amount of output the farm produces and the price at which it sells its 
output. Column (3) is the farm’s total revenue. The table assumes that the price of 
milk is $6 a gallon, so total revenue is $6 times the number of gallons. 
Just as the concepts of average and marginal were useful in the preceding chapter 
when analyzing costs, they are also useful when discussing revenue. To see what 
these concepts reveal, consider two questions: 
¢+ How much revenue does the farm receive for the typical gallon of milk? 
¢ How much additional revenue does the farm receive if it increases the pro￾duction of milk by 1 gallon? 
Columns (4) and (5) in Table 1 answer these questions.

Column (4) in the table shows average revenue, which is total revenue [from column 
(3)] divided by the amount of output [from column (1)]. Average revenue is what a firm 
receives for the typical unit sold. Table 1 shows that average revenue equals $6, the price 
of a gallon of milk. This illustrates a general lesson that applies to all firms, competitive 
or not. Average revenue is total revenue (P X () divided by quantity ((Q). Therefore, 
for all types of firms, average revenue equals the price of the good. 
Column (5) shows marginal revenue, which is the change in total revenue from 
the sale of each additional unit of output. In Table 1, marginal revenue equals $6, 
the price of a gallon of milk. This illustrates a lesson that applies only to firms in 
competitive markets. Because total revenue is P X () and P is fixed for a competi￾tive firm, when Q rises by 1 unit, total revenue rises by P dollars. Therefore, for 
competitive firms, marginal revenue equals the price of the good.

15-2 Profit Maximization and the Competitive 
Firm’s Supply Curve 
The goal of a firm is to maximize profit, which equals total revenue minus total 
cost. The previous section discussed the competitive firm’s revenue, and the previ￾ous chapter analyzed the firm's costs. Let’s now consider how a competitive firm 
maximizes profit and how that decision determines its supply curve. 
15-2a A Simple Example of Profit Maximization 
Table 2 presents more information about the Vaca Family Dairy Farm. Column (1) 
in the table shows the number of gallons of milk the farm produces. Column (2) 
shows the farm's total revenue, which is $6 times the number of gallons. Column 
(3) shows the farm’s total cost. Total cost includes fixed costs, which are $3 in this 
example, and variable costs, which depend on the quantity produced. 
Column (4) shows the farm’s profit, which is computed by subtracting total cost 
from total revenue. If the farm produces nothing, it has a loss of $3 (its fixed cost). 
If it produces 1 gallon, it has a profit of $1. If it produces 2 gallons, it has a profit of 
$4, and so on. The Vaca family wants to produce the quantity of milk that makes its 
profit as large as possible. In this example, the farm maximizes profit by producing 
either 4 or 5 gallons of milk for a profit of $7. 
There is another way to look at Vaca Farm's decision: The Vacas can find the 
profit-maximizing quantity by comparing the marginal revenue and marginal cost 
of each unit produced. Columns (5) and (6) in Table 2 compute marginal revenue

and marginal cost from the changes in total revenue and total cost, and column (7) 
shows the change in profit for each additional gallon produced. The first gallon of 
milk the farm produces has a marginal revenue of 56 and a marginal cost of $2, so 
producing that gallon increases profit by $4 (from —$3 to $1). The second gallon 
produced has a marginal revenue of $6 and a marginal cost of $3, so that gallon 
increases profit by $3 (from $1 to $4). As long as marginal revenue exceeds marginal 
cost, increasing the quantity produced raises profit. Once the farm’s output reaches 
5 gallons of milk, however, the situation changes. The sixth gallon would have a 
marginal revenue of $6 and a marginal cost of $7, so producing it would reduce 
profit by $1 (from $7 to $6). As a result, the Vacas do not produce more than 5 gallons. 
One of the Ten Principles of Economics in Chapter 1 is that rational people think 
at the margin. The Vacas can apply this principle. If marginal revenue is greater than 
marginal cost—as it is at 1, 2, and 3 gallons—they should increase the production 
of milk because it will put more money in their pockets (marginal revenue) than 
it takes out (marginal cost). If marginal revenue is less than marginal cost—as it 
is at 6, 7, and 8 gallons—the Vacas should decrease production. By thinking at the 
margin and making incremental adjustments to the level of production, the Vacas 
end up producing the profit-maximizing quantity.

Profit Maximization for a 
Competitive Firm 
15-2b The Marginal-Cost Curve and the Firm’s Supply Decision 
To extend this analysis, consider the cost curves in Figure 1. These cost curves exhibit 
the three features that, as the preceding chapter explained, are thought to describe 
most firms: The marginal-cost curve (MC) slopes upward, the average-total-cost 
curve (ATC) is U-shaped, and the marginal-cost curve crosses the average-total-cost 
curve at the minimum of average total cost. The figure also shows a horizontal line 
at the market price (P). The price line is horizontal because a competitive firm is 
a price taker: The price of the firm’s output is the same regardless of how much it 
produces. Keep in mind that, for a competitive firm, the price equals both the firm’s 
average revenue (AR) and its marginal revenue (MR). 
We can use Figure 1 to find the quantity of output that maximizes profit. Imagine 
that the firm is producing at Q,. At this level of output, the marginal-revenue curve 
is above the marginal-cost curve, indicating that marginal revenue is greater than 
marginal cost. This means that if the firm were to raise production by 1 unit, the 
additional revenue (MR, ) would exceed the additional cost (MC)). Profit, which equals 
total revenue minus total cost, would increase. Hence, if marginal revenue is greater 
than marginal cost, as itis at Q,, the firm can increase profit by increasing production. 
A similar argument applies when output is at Q,. In this case, the marginal-cost 
curve is above the marginal-revenue curve, showing that marginal cost is greater than 
marginal revenue. If the firm were to reduce production by 1 unit, the costs saved 
(MC,) would exceed the revenue lost (MR_). Therefore, if marginal cost is greater than 
marginal revenue, as it is at (0, the firm can increase profit by reducing production. 
This figure shows the marginal-cost curve (MC), the average-total-cost curve (ATC), and 
the average-variable-cost curve (AVC). It also shows the market price (F), which for a 
competitive firm equals both marginal revenue (MFR) and average revenue (AR). At the 
quantity @,, marginal revenue MR, exceeds marginal cost MC,, so raising production 
increases profit. At the quantity @,, marginal cost MC, is above marginal revenue MR, so 
reducing production increases profit. The profit-maximizing quantity, @, is found where 
the horizontal line representing the price intersects the marginal-cost curve.

Where do these marginal adjustments to production end? Regardless of whether 
the firm begins with production at a low level (such as Q) or at a high level (such 
as (2,), it will eventually adjust production until the quantity produced reaches 
the profit-maximizing quantity, Q,,,,. This analysis vields three rules for profit 
maximization: 
¢ If marginal revenue exceeds marginal cost, the firm should increase 
its output. 
e If marginal cost exceeds marginal revenue, the firm should decrease 
its output. 
e At the profit-maximizing level of output, marginal revenue equals marginal cost. 
These rules are the key to rational decision making by any profit-maximizing firm. 
They apply not only to competitive firms but, as the next chapter shows, to other 
types of firms as well. 
We can now see how the competitive firm decides what quantity of its good to 
supply to the market. Because a competitive firm is a price taker, its marginal revenue 
equals the market price. For any price, the competitive firm’s profit-maximizing 
quantity of output is found by looking at the intersection of the price with the 
marginal-cost curve. In Figure 1, that quantity is Q,,, .- 
Suppose that the price prevailing in this market rises, perhaps because of an 
increase in market demand. Figure 2 shows how a competitive firm responds to 
the price increase. When the price is P,, the firm produces quantity Q,, the quantity 
that equates marginal cost to the price. When the price rises to P,, the firm finds 
that marginal revenue is higher than marginal cost at the previous level of output, 
s0 it increases production. The new profit-maximizing quantity is Q,, at which 
marginal cost equals the new, higher price. Because the firm's marginal-cost curve 
determines the quantity of the good the firm is willing to supply at any price, the 
marginal-cost curve is also the competitive firm's supply curve. 
There are, however, some caveats to this conclusion, which we examine next. 
Figure 2 Price 
Marginal Cost as the Competitive 
Firm's Supply Curve 
An increase in the price from P, to 
F, leads to an increase in the firm's 
profit-maximizing quantity from @Q, 
to Q.. Because the marginal-cost 
curve shows the quantity supplied 
at any price, it is the firm's supply 
curve.

15-2¢ The Firm’s Short-Run Decision to Shut Down 
So far, we have been analyzing the question of how much a competitive firm will 
produce. In some circumstances, however, the firm will decide to shut down and 
not produce anything at all. 
It'’s important to distinguish between a firm’s temporary shutdown and its per￾manent exit from the market. A shutdown refers to a short-run decision not to 
produce anything during a specific period because of current market conditions. 
Exit refers to a long-run decision to leave the market. The short-run and long-run 
decisions differ because most firms cannot avoid their fixed costs in the short run 
but can do so in the long run. That is, a firm that shuts down temporarily still must 
pay its fixed costs, while a firm that exits the market doesn’t pay any costs at all, 
fixed or variable. 
For example, consider production decisions at a farm. The cost of the land is a 
fixed cost. If the farm owners decide not to produce any crops one season, the land 
lies fallow, and they cannot recover this cost. When making the short-run decision 
of whether to shut down for a season, the fixed cost of land is said to be a sunk cost. 
By contrast, if the farm owners decide to leave farming altogether, they can sell the 
land. When making the long-run decision of whether to exit the market, the cost of 
land is not sunk. (Sunk costs will come up again shortly:) 
What determines a firm’s shutdown decision? If the firm shuts down, it loses all 
revenue from the sale of its product. At the same time, it saves the variable costs of 
making the product (but must still pay the fixed costs). Therefore, the firm shuts 
down if the revenue that it would earn from producing is less than its variable 
costs of production. 
A bit of mathematics can make this shutdown rule more useful. If TR stands 
for total revenue and V stands for variable cost, then the firm's decision can be 
written as 
Shut down if TR = VC. 
The firm shuts down if total revenue is less than variable cost. By dividing both 
sides of this inequality by the quantity Q, we can write it as 
Shut down if TR/Q < VC/Q. 
The lett side of the inequality, TR/(Q, is total revenue P X Q divided by quantity Q, 
which is average revenue, most simply expressed as the good’s price, P. The right 
side of the inequality, VC/(Q, is average variable cost, AVC. The firm’'s shutdown 
rule can be restated as 
Shut down if P < AVC. 
That is, a firm shuts down if the price of the good is less than the average variable 
cost of production. This rule is intuitive: When deciding whether to produce, the 
firm compares the price it receives for the typical unit to the average variable cost 
that it must incur to produce it. If the price doesn’t cover the average variable cost, 
the firm is better off stopping production altogether. The firm still loses money 
(because it incurs fixed costs), but it would lose even more money by staying open. 
The firm can reopen in the future if conditions change so that price exceeds average 
variable cost.

Figure 3 Casts 
The Competitive Firm's 
Short-Run Supply Curve 
In the short run, the 
competitive firm's supply 
curve is the portion of its 
marginal-cost curve (MC) that 
lies above its average-variable￾cost curve (AVC). If the price 
falls below average variable 
cost, the firm is better off 
shutting down temporarily. 
ATC 
A¥C 
We now have a tull description of a competitive firm’s profit-maximizing strategy. 
If the firm produces anything, it produces the quantity at which marginal cost equals 
the good's price, which the firm takes as given. Yet if the price is less than average 
variable cost at that quantity, the firm is better off shutting down temporarily and 
not producing anything. Figure 3 illustrates these results. The competitive firm’s 
short-run supply curve is the portion of its marginal-cost curve that lies above 
the average-variable-cost curve. 
15-2d Spilt Milk and Other Sunk Costs 
At some point in your life, you may have been told, “Don’t cry over spilt milk,” 
or “Let bygones be bygones.” These adages were not written by economists, but 
they could have been. They express an important truth about rational decision 
making. A sunk cost is a cost that has already been committed and cannot be 
recovered. Because nothing can be done about sunk costs, it's rational to ignore 
them when making many decisions in life, including those regarding business 
strategy. 
Our analysis of the firm's shutdown decision is an example of the irrelevance 
of sunk costs. We assume that the firm can’t recover its fixed costs by temporarily 
stopping production. That is, regardless of the quantity of output supplied (even if 
it is zero), the firm still must pay its fixed costs. In the short run, the fixed costs are 
sunk, and the firm should ignore them when deciding how much to produce. The 
firm's short-run supply curve is the part of the marginal-cost curve that lies above 
average variable cost. Because the fixed costs are sunk, their size doesn’t matter 
for this supply decision. 
The irrelevance of sunk costs is worth remembering in your personal life. Imagine, 
for instance, that you want to see a new movie. You're willing to pay $15 to see it, 
and a ticket only costs 510, so you decide to go. Before entering the theater, how￾ever, you lose the ticket. The theater management doesn't believe that you lost it.

You might be so angry and disappointed that you're inclined to go home and for￾get about the movie. After all, buying another ticket now would bring your total cost 
to $20, which might seem to be too much. But that would be a mistake. Rationally, 
you should buy another ticket for $10. Why? The benefit of seeing the movie ($15) 
exceeds the opportunity cost (the $10 for the second ticket). The $10 you paid for 
the lost ticket is a sunk cost. As with spilt milk, there is no point in crying about it. 
Near-Empty Restaurants and Off-Season 
Miniature Golf 
Have you ever walked into a restaurant for lunch and found it almost 
empty? Why, you might ask, does such a restaurant even bother to 
stay open? It might seem that the revenue from so few customers could not pos￾sibly cover the cost of running the restaurant. 
When deciding whether to open for lunch, a restaurant owner must keep in 
mind the distinction between fixed and variable costs. Many of a restaurant’s 
costs—the rent, kitchen equipment, tables, plates, silverware, and so on—are fixed. 
Shutting down during lunch would not reduce these costs, which are sunk in the 
short run. When the owner is deciding whether to serve lunch, only the variable 
costs—the price of the additional food and the wages of the extra staff—are rel￾evant. The owner shuts down the restaurant at lunchtime only if the revenue from 
the few lunchtime customers would fail to cover the variable costs. 
An operator of a miniature golf course in a summer resort community faces a 
similar decision. Because revenue varies substantially from season to season, the 
firm must decide what date to open and what date to close. Once again, the fixed 
costs—the costs of buying the land and building the course—are irrelevant to this 
short-run decision. The miniature golf course should open for business only during 
those times of the year when its revenue exceeds its variable costs. ® 
Staying open can be profitable, even with many tables empty.

15-2e The Firm’s Long-Run Decision to Exit or Enter a Market 
A firm’s long-run decision to leave a market is similar to its shutdown decision. If it 
exits, it will again lose all revenue from the sale of its product, but now it will save not 
only its variable costs of production but also its fixed costs. The firm exits the market 
if the revenue it would get from producing is less than its total cost of production. 
We can again make this rule more useful by writing it mathematically. If TR 
stands for total revenue and TC stands for total cost, then the firm’s exit rule can 
be written as 
Exit if TE = TC. 
The firm exits if total revenue is less than total cost. By dividing both sides of this 
inequality by quantity Q, we can write it as 
Exit if TR/Q < TC/Q. 
This can be simplified by noting that TR/Q is average revenue, which equals the 
price P, and that TC/(Q) is average total cost, ATC. The firm’s exit rule is 
Exit if P < ATC. 
That is, a firm exits if the price of its good is less than the average total cost of 
production. 
A parallel analysis applies to entrepreneurs who could establish new firms. They 
have an incentive to enter the market if doing so would be profitable, which occurs 
if the price exceeds average total cost. The entry rule is 
Enter if P = ATC. 
The rule for entry is exactly the opposite of the rule for exit. 
We can now describe a competitive firm’s long-run profit-maximizing strategy. 
If it produces anything, it chooses the quantity at which marginal cost equals the 
price of the good. Yet if the price is less than the average total cost at that quantity, 
the firm decides to exit (or not enter) the market. Figure 4 illustrates these results. 
The competitive firm's long-run supply curve is the portion of its marginal-cost 
curve that lies above the average-total-cost curve. 
15-2f Measuring Profit in Our Graph for the Competitive Firm 
As we study exit and entry, it is useful to analyze the firm’s profit in more detail. 
Recall that profit equals total revenue (TR) minus total cost (TC): 
Profit = TR — TC. 
We can rewrite this definition by multiplying and dividing the right side by - 
Profit = (TR/Q — TC/Q) % Q. 
Note that TR/Q is average revenue, which is the price, P, and TC/Q is average 
total cost, ATC. Therefore, 
Profit = (" — ATC) X Q. 
This way of expressing the firm's profit allows us to measure profit on our graphs.

Long-Run Supply Curve MC 
In the long run, the 
competitive firm's supply 
curve is the portion of its 
marginal-cost curve (MC) that ATC 
lies above its average-total￾cost curve (ATC). If the price 
falls below average total cost, 
the firm is better off exiting 
the market.

Panel (a) of Figure 5 shows a firm earning positive profit. As we have already 
discussed, the firm maximizes profit by producing the quantity at which price 
equals marginal cost. Now look at the shaded rectangle. The height of the rect￾angle is P — ATC, the difference between price and average total cost. The width 
of the rectangle is Q, the quantity produced. Therefore, the area of the rectangle is 
(P — ATC) ¥ Q, which is the firm’s profit. 
Figurg 5 The area of the shaded box between price and average total cost represents the firm's profit. 
The height of this box is price minus average total cost (P — ATC), and the width of the box is 
the quantity of output (Q). In panel (a), price is greater than average total cost, so the firm has 
positive profit. In panel (b), price is less than average total cost, so the firm incurs a loss.

Similarly, panel (b) of this figure shows a firm with losses (negative profit). In this 
case, maximizing profit means minimizing losses, a task accomplished once again 
by producing the quantity at which price equals marginal cost. Now consider the 
shaded rectangle. The height of the rectangle is ATC — P, and the width is ). The 
area is (ATC — P) ¥ Q, which is the firm’s loss. Because a firm in this situation is 
not making enough revenue on each unit to cover its average total cost, it would 
exit the market in the long run. 
15-2g A Brief Recap 
We can sum up our analysis of the competitive firm with a dialogue between 
two business partners. Fred and Wilma have just bought a granite quarry, 
which produces material for kitchen countertops. Because they compete with 
many other quarries, they take the price of granite as given by market condi￾tions. Wilma, an economics major, is explaining to Fred how they should make 
supply decisions. 
Fred: How much output should we produce to maximize profit? 
Wilma: If we produce anything, we should pick the level of output at 
which P = MC. 
Fred: Will we make a profit? 
Wilma: We will if, at that level of output, P = ATC. If P << ATC, we will 
make a loss. 
Fred: What should we do if that output makes a profit? 
Wilma: Be happy and stay in business. 
Fred: And if that output makes a loss? 
Wilma: Plan on exiting in the long run. 
Fred: In that case, should we keep operating in the short run? 
Wilma: We should if P = AVC. Stayving open minimizes our losses. 
Fred: Whatif P << AV(C? 
Wilma: Then we should shut down as quickly as possible and plan our 
exit. 
Fred: 5o our long-run supply curve is the MC curve above the ATC 
curve, and our short-run supply curve is the MC curve above the 
AVC curve. 
Wilma: Yes, Fred, that's the plan. Table 3 summarizes everything you need 
to know. (Theirs is carved in granite.)

15-3 The Supply Curve in a Competitive Market 
The supply curves for entire markets are built on the supply decisions of individual 
firms. There are two cases to consider: (1) markets with a fixed number of firms and (2) 
markets in which firms can enter and exit. Both cases are important, for each applies to 
a specific time horizon. Over short periods, entry and exit are often difficult, making it 
reasonable to assume a fixed number of firms. But over long stretches, entry and exit 
become easier, and so the number of firms can adjust to changing market conditions. 
15-3a The Short Run: Market Supply with a Fixed 
Number of Firms 
Imagine a market with 1,000 identical firms. Each firm acts according to our standard 
model: For any price, it supplies the quantity of output at which its marginal cost 
equals the price. Panel (a) of Figure 6 shows this. As long as price exceeds average 
variable cost, each firm’s marginal-cost curve is its supply curve. The quantity of 
output supplied to the market equals the sum of the quantities supplied by each 
of the 1,000 firms. The market supply curve is derived by horizontally adding the 
supply curves of all the firms (as we did with Ben and Jerry in Chapter 4). As panel 
(b) of Figure 6 shows, the quantity supplied to the market is 1,000 times the quantity 
supplied by each of these identical firms. 
15-3b The Long Run: Market Supply with Entry and Exit 
Now consider what happens when firms can enter and exit the market. Let’s sup￾pose that everyone has access to the same production technology and access to the 
same markets to buy the inputs for production. As a result, all current and potential 
firms have the same cost curves. 
Decisions about entry and exit in a market of this type depend on the incentives 
facing the owners of existing firms and the entrepreneurs who could start new 
firms. If firms already in the market are profitable, new firms will enter. This entry 
will expand the number of firms, increase the quantity of the good supplied, and 
drive down prices and profits. Conversely, if firms in the market are making losses, 
some existing firms will exit. Their exit will reduce the number of firms, decrease 
the quantity of the good supplied, and drive up prices and profits. At the end of

Figure 6 In the short run, the number of firms in the market is fixed. As a result, the 
market supply curve, shown in panel (b), reflects the sum of individual firms' 
marginal-cost curves, shown in panel (a). Here, in a market of 1,000 identical 
firms, the quantity of output supplied to the market is 1,000 times the gquantity 
supplied by each firm.

this process of entry and exit, firms that remain in the market must be making 
zero economic profit. That conclusion may seem strange but have no fear: Tt will 
be explained shortly. 
Recall that we can write a firm's profit as 
Profit = (P — ATC) X Q. 
This equation shows that an operating firm has zero profit if and only if the price 
of the good equals the average total cost of production. If price is above average 
total cost, profit is positive, which encourages new firms to enter. If price is less 
than average total cost, profit is negative, which encourages some firms to exit. The 
process of entry and exit ends only when price and average total cost are driven 
to equality. 
This line of reasoning leads to a surprising implication. We noted earlier in the 
chapter that competitive firms maximize profits by choosing a quantity at which 
price equals marginal cost. We just noted that free entry and exit force price to 
equal average total cost. But if price is to equal both marginal cost and average total 
cost, these two measures of cost must equal each other. Marginal cost and average 
total cost are equal, however, only when the firm is operating at the minimum of 
average total cost. Recall from the preceding chapter that economists use the term 
efficient scale to describe the level of production with the lowest average total cost. 
Therefore, in the long-run equilibrium of a competitive market with free entry 
and exit, firms operate at their efficient scale.

Panel (a) of Figure 7 shows a firm in such a long-run equilibrium. In this figure, 
price P equals marginal cost MC, so the firm is maximizing profit. Price also equals 
average total cost ATC, so profit is zero. New firms have no incentive to enter the 
market, and existing firms have no incentive to leave the market. 
From this analysis of firm behavior, we can determine the long-run supply curve 
for the market. In a market with free entry and exit, there is only one price consis￾tent with zero profit—the minimum of average total cost. As a result, the long-run 
market supply curve must be horizontal at this price, as illustrated by the perfectly 
elastic supply curve in panel (b) of Figure 7. Any price above this level would gen￾erate profits, leading to entry and an increase in the total quantity supplied. Any 
price below this level would generate losses, leading to exit and a decrease in the 
total quantity supplied. Eventually, the number of firms in the market adjusts so 
that price equals the minimum of average total cost, and there are enough firms to 
satisfy all the demand at this price. 
15-3¢ Why Do Competitive Firms Stay in Business 
If They Make Zero Profit? 
At first, it might seem odd that competitive firms earn zero profit in the long 
run. After all, people start businesses to make money. If entry eventually drives 
profit to zero, there might seem to be little reason to stay in business. 
To understand the zero-profit condition more fully, recall that profit 
equals total revenue minus total cost and that total cost includes all the 
“We're a nonprofit 
clrganizati(m—we don’t 
intend to be, but we are!” 
opportunity costs of the firm. In particular, total cost includes the time 
and money that the firm owners devote to the business. What is crucial is 
that in the zero-profit equilibrium, the firm's revenue must compensate 
the owners for these opportunity costs.

Consider an example. Suppose that, to start a farm, a farmer had to invest 
$1 million, which otherwise could have earned $40,000 a year in interest in a bank 
account. In addition, the farmer had to give up another job that would have paid 
$60,000 a year. Then the opportunity cost of farming includes both the forgone inter￾est and the forgone wages—a total of $100,000. Even if the farm'’s profit is driven to 
zero, its revenue compensates the farmer for these opportunity costs. 
Recall that accountants and economists measure costs differently. As the previ￾ous chapter noted, accountants keep track of explicit costs but not implicit ones. 
They measure costs that require an outflow of money but ignore the opportunity 
costs for which no money leaves the firm. As a result, in the zero-profit equilibrium, 
economic profit is zero, but accounting profit is positive. The farmer s accountant, 
for instance, would conclude that the farm earned a profit of $100,000, which is 
why the farmer stays in business. 
15-3d A Shift in Demand in the Short Run and Long Run 
Now let’s turn to how markets respond to changes in demand. Because firms can 
enter and exit in the long run but not in the short run, the response of a market to 
a change in demand depends on the time horizon. To see this, let’s trace the effects 
of a shift in demand over time. 
Suppose the market for milk begins in a long-run equilibrium. Firms are earning 
zero profit, so price equals the minimum of average total cost. Panel (a) of Figure 8 
shows this situation. The long-run equilibrium is point A, the quantity sold in the 
market is Q,, and the price is P,. 
Now suppose scientists discover that milk has miraculous health benefits, causing 
a surge in demand. That is, the quantity of milk demanded at every price increases, 
and the demand curve for milk shifts outward from D, to D,, as in panel (b). The 
short-run equilibrium moves from point A to point B; the quantity rises from Q, 
to (0,, and the price rises from P, to P,. All the firms in the market respond to the 
higher price by producing more milk. Because each firm’s supply curve reflects 
its marginal-cost curve, how much each firm increases production depends on the 
marginal-cost curve. In the new short-run equilibrium, the price of milk exceeds 
average total cost, so the firms are making positive profit. 
Over time, this profit encourages new firms to enter. For example, some farmers 
supplying other products may switch to producing milk. As the number of sup￾pliers grows, the quantity supplied at every price increases, the short-run supply 
curve shifts to the right from S, to S, as in panel (c), and this shift causes the price 
to fall. Eventually, the price is driven back down to the minimum of average total 
cost, profits are zero, and firms stop entering,. The market reaches a new long-run 
equilibrium, point C. The price of milk has returned to P, but the quantity produced 
has risen to Q.. Each firm is again producing at its efficient scale, but because more 
firms are in the dairy business, the quantity of milk produced and sold is higher. 
15-3¢ Why the Long-Run Supply Curve Might Slope Upward 
We have seen that entry and exit can cause the long-run market supply curve to 
be perfectly elastic. In essence, there are many potential entrants, each of which 
faces the same costs. As a result, the long-run market supply curve is horizontal at 
the minimum of average total cost. When demand increases, the long-run result is 
an increase in the number of firms and in the total quantity supplied, without any 
change in the price. 
There are, however, two reasons that the long-run market supply curve might slope 
upward. The first is that some resources used in production may be available only

in limited quantities. Consider the market for farm products. Anyone can buy land 
and start a farm, but the quantity of land is limited. As more people become farmers, 
they bid up the price of farmland, increasing the costs of all farmers in the market. An 
increase in demand for farm products can’t increase the quantity supplied without also 
inducing a rise in farmers’ costs, which means a rise in price. The result is a long-run 
market supply curve that slopes upward, even with free entry into farming. 
A second reason for an upward-sloping long-run supply curve is that firms 
may have different costs. Take the market for painters. Anyone can enter it, but not 
everyone has the same costs. People differ in how fast they work, and they differ 
in the alternative uses of their time. For any price, those with lower costs are more 
likely to enter than those with higher costs. To increase the quantity of painting 
services supplied, additional entrants must be induced to enter the market. Because 
these new entrants have higher costs, the price must rise to make entry profitable 
for them. As a result, the long-run market supply curve for painting services slopes 
upward even with free entry into the market. 
Notice that when firms have different costs, some firms earn profit even in the 
long run. In this case, the market price reflects the average total cost of the marginal 
firm—the firm that would exit if the price were any lower. This firm earns zero profit, 
but firms with lower costs earn positive profit. Entry does not eliminate this profit 
because would-be entrants have higher costs than firms already in the market. Higher￾cost firms will enter only if the price rises, making the market profitable for them. 
For these two reasons, a higher price may be necessary to induce a larger quantity 
supplied, in which case the long-run supply curve is upward-sloping rather than 
horizontal. Nonetheless, the basic lesson about entry and exit remains true. Because 
firms can enter and exit more easily in the long run than in the short run, the 
long-run supply curve is typically more elastic than the short-run supply curve.

15-4 Conclusion: Behind the Supply Curve 
We have been discussing the behavior of profit-maximizing firms that supply goods 
in perfectly competitive markets. You may recall from Chapter 1 that one of the Ten 
Principles of Economics is that rational people think at the margin. This chapter 
has applied this idea to the competitive firm. Marginal analysis has given us a

theory of the supply curve in a competitive market and a deeper understanding of 
market outcomes. 
We have learned that when you buy a good from a firm in a competitive mar￾ket, the price you pay is close to the cost of producing it. In particular, if firms are 
competitive and profit-maximizing, the price of a good equals the marginal cost of 
making that good. And if firms can freely enter and exit the market, the price also 
equals the lowest possible average total cost of production. 
We have assumed throughout this chapter that firms are price takers, but many of 
the tools developed here are also useful for studying firms in less competitive mar￾kets. The next chapter examines the behavior of firms with market power. Marginal 
analysis will again be useful, but it will have very different implications for a firm’s 
production decisions and for the nature of market outcomes. 
Chapter in a Nutshell 
* Because a competitive firm is a price taker, its revenue * In a market with free entry and exit, economic profit 
is proportional to the amount of output it produces. 
The price of the good equals both the firm's average 
revenue and its marginal revenue. 
To maximize profit, a firm chooses a quantity of 
output such that marginal revenue equals marginal 
cost. Because marginal revenue for a competitive firm 
equals the market price, the firm chooses the quantity 
at which price equals marginal cost. Thus, the firm's 
marginal-cost curve is its supply curve. 
In the short run, when fixed costs are sunk, the firm 
will shut down temporarily if the price of the good is 
less than average variable cost. In the long run, when 
the firm can recover both fixed and variable costs, it 
will exit if the price is less than average total cost.

is driven to zero in the long run. In this long-run 
equilibrium, all firms produce at the efficient scale, 
price equals the minimum of average total cost, and 
the number of firms adjusts to satisfy the quantity 
demanded at this price. 
Changes in demand have different effects over dif￾ferent time horizons. In the short run, an increase 
in demand raises prices and leads to profits, and a 
decrease in demand lowers prices and leads to losses. 
But if firms can freely enter and exit the market, then, 
in the long run, the number of firms adjusts to drive 
the market back to the zero-profit equilibrium.

used some version of Windows, the operating system sold by 
| the Microsoft Corporation, and even today, Windows com￾puters remain popular. When Microsoft originally designed 
Windows, it applied for and received a copyright from the 
government. The copyright gives Microsott the exclusive right to 
M ono 01 make and sell copies of the Windows operating system. Someone 
p y who wants to buy a copy has little choice but to fork over the 
roughly $100 that Microsoft charges for its product. These days, 
other operating systems are available, but they are often very 
different. Microsoft is said to have a monopoly in the market for 
Windows. 
Microsoft’s business decisions aren’t well described by the model 
of firm behavior developed in the previous chapter. That chapter 
analyzed competitive markets, in which many firms offer largely 
identical products, so each firm has little influence over the price it 
receives. By contrast, because a monopoly has no close competitors, 
it has the power to influence the market price of its product. While a 
competitive firm is a price taker, a monopoly firm is a price maker.

This chapter examines the implications of this market power. We will see that 
market power alters the relationship between the costs a firm incurs producing a 
good and the price at which it sells that good. So far, we have seen that a competi￾tive firm takes the price of its output as given by the market and then chooses the 
quantity it will supply so that price equals marginal cost. A monopoly is different. 
It charges a price that exceeds marginal cost. Sure enough, this practice is evident 
in the case of Microsoft’s Windows. The marginal cost of Windows—the extra cost 
that Microsoft incurs when a customer downloads one more copy—is trivial. The 
market price of Windows is many times its marginal cost. 
It is not surprising that monopolies charge high prices for their products. Customers 
of a monopoly might seem to have little choice but to pay whatever the monopoly 
charges. But if so, why doesn't Microsoft charge $1,000 for a copy of Windows? Or 
$10,000? The reason is that if the price were that high, fewer people would buy it. 
People would buy fewer computers, switch to other operating systems, or make 
illegal copies. A monopoly can control the price of what it sells, but because a high 
price reduces the quantity demanded, the monopoly’s profits are not unlimited. 
In examining how monopolies make production and pricing decisions, this 
chapter considers the implications of monopoly for society as a whole. Monopolies, 
like competitive firms, aim to maximize profit, but the pursuit of this goal has very 
different ramifications. In a competitive market, self-interested consumers and 
producers reach an equilibrium that promotes general economic well-being, as if 
guided by an invisible hand. But because monopolies are unchecked by competi￾tion, the outcome in a monopolized market is often not in the best interest of society. 
One of the Ten Principles of Economics in Chapter 1 is that governments can 
sometimes improve market outcomes. This chapter sheds more light on this principle 
by examining the inefficiencies that monopolies cause and discussing how govern￾ment policymakers can respond to these problems. The U.5. government keeps a 
close eye on Microsoft's business decisions, for example. In 1994, the government 
blocked Microsoft from acquiring Intuit, a leading seller of personal finance soft￾ware, on the grounds that a merger between the two firms would concentrate too 
much market power. Similarly, in 1998, the U.S. Department of Justice objected 
when Microsoft started integrating its Internet Explorer browser into its Windows 
operating system, claiming that this practice would extend the firm’s market power 
into new areas. In recent years, regulators in the United States and abroad have 
shifted their focus to firms with growing market power, such as Apple, Google, and 
Amazon, but they continue to monitor Microsoft’s compliance with antitrust laws. 
16-1 Why Monopolies Arise 
monopoly 
a firm that is the sole 
seller of a product 
without close substitutes 
A firm is a monopoly if it is the sole seller of a product that doesn’t have close 
substitutes. The fundamental cause of monopoly is barriers to entry: A monopoly 
remains the only seller in its market because other firms can’t enter and compete 
with it. Barriers to entry, in turn, have three main sources: 
Monopoly resources: A single firm owns a key resource required for production. 
Government regulation: The government gives a single firm the exclusive 
right to produce a good or service. 
¢ The production process: A single firm can produce output at a lower cost 
than a larger number of firms can. 
Here's more on these barriers to entry.

The simplest way for a monopoly to arise is for a single firm to own a key 
resource, Consider the market for water in a small town. If dozens of residents 
have working wells, the model of competitive markets in the preceding chapter 
describes sellers’ behavior. Competition among suppliers drives the price of a 
gallon of water to equal the marginal cost of pumping an extra gallon. But if 
there is only one well in town and it is impossible to get water from anywhere 
else, then the owner of the well has a monopoly. Not surprisingly, the monopolist 
has much greater market power than any single firm in a competitive market. 
For a necessity like water, the monopolist can command quite a high price, even 
if the marginal cost of pumping an extra gallon is low. 
A classic example of market power arising from the ownership of a key 
resource is DeBeers, the diamond company. Founded in South Africa in 1888 
by Cecil Rhodes, an English businessman (and benefactor of the Rhodes 
scholarship), DeBeers has at times controlled up to 80 percent of the produc￾tion from the world’s diamond mines. Because its market share is less than 100 
percent, DeBeers is not exactly a monopoly, but the company has nonetheless 
exerted substantial influence over the market price of diamonds. 
Although exclusive ownership of a key resource can create a monopoly, this is 
relatively rare in practice. Economies are large, and resources are owned by many 
people. The natural scope of many markets is worldwide because goods are often 
traded internationally. There are few examples of firms that own resources for which 
there are no close substitutes. 
16-1b Government-Created Monopolies 
In many cases, monopolies arise when the government gives one person or firm the 
exclusive right to sell a good or service. Sometimes, a would-be monopolist receives 
the right out of sheer political clout. Kings once granted exclusive business licenses 
to their friends and allies. Autocrats continue to do so. Sometimes, the government 
grants a monopoly because doing so is in the public interest. 
Patent and copyright laws are two important examples of how a government 
can create a monopoly. When a pharmaceutical company discovers a new drug, 
it can apply to the government for a patent. If the government deems the drug 
to be original, it approves the patent, which grants the company the exclusive 
right to manufacture and sell the drug for 20 years. Similarly, after finishing a 
book, a novelist can copyright it. The copyright is a government guarantee that 
no one can sell the work without the author’s permission. Writers who can barely 
support themselves may not think of themselves as monopolists. But this only 
goes to show that being the sole seller of a product does not guarantee a large 
number of buyers. 
The effects of patent and copyright laws are casy to sece. Because these laws 
give one producer a monopoly, they lead to higher prices and higher profits 
than would occur under competition. But the laws also encourage some desir￾able behavior. By allowing drug companies to be monopolists in the drugs they 
discover, the patent laws encourage their research. By allowing authors to be 
monopolists in the sale of their books, the copyright laws encourage them to 
write more and better books. 
The laws governing patents and copyrights have both benefits and costs. 
The benefits are the increased incentives for creative activity. They are offset, to 
some extent, by the costs of monopoly pricing, which we examine later in 
this chapter.

16-1¢ Natural Monopolies 
natural monopoly An industry is a natural monopoly when a single firm can supply a market with a 
a type of monopoly that good or service at a lower cost than two or more firms could. This happens when 
arises because a single there are economies of scale over the relevant range of output. Figure 1 shows the 
firm can supply a good average total costs of a firm with economies of scale. In this case, a single firm can 
or service to an entire produce any amount of output at the lowest cost. That is, for any given amount of 
market at a lower cost output, a larger number of firms leads to less output per firm and higher average 
than could two or more total cost. 
firms The distribution of tap water is an example of a natural monopoly. To provide 
water to town residents, a firm must build a network of pipes. If two or more firms 
were to compete, each would have to incur the fixed cost of building a network. 
The average total cost is lowest if a single firm provides water to the entire market. 
Other examples of natural monopolies appeared in Chapter 11, which noted that 
club goods are excludable but not rival in consumption. An example is a bridge used 
so rarely that it is never congested. The bridge is excludable because a toll collector 
can prevent someone from using it. The bridge is not rival in consumption because 
one person’s use of the bridge does not hinder others’ use of it. There is a large 
fixed cost of building the bridge but a negligible marginal cost of additional users, 
so the average total cost (the total cost divided by the number of trips) declines as 
the number of trips rises, making the bridge a natural monopoly. 
When a firm is a natural monopoly, it is less concerned about new entrants eroding 
its monopoly power. Normally, a firm has trouble maintaining a monopoly position 
without government protection or ownership of a key resource. The monopolist’s 
profit attracts entrants into the market, and these entrants make the market more 
competitive. By contrast, entering a market in which another firm has a natural 
monopoly is unattractive. Would-be entrants know that they cannot achieve the 
same low costs that the monopolist enjoys because, after entry, each firm would 
have a smaller piece of the market. 
In some cases, the size of the market determines whether an industry is a natural 
monopoly. Again, consider a bridge across a river. When the population is small, 
the bridge may be a natural monopoly. A single bridge can meet the entire demand 
Figure 1 Cast 
Economies of Scale as a Cause 
of Monopoly 
When a firm's average-total-cost

firm has what is called a natural 
monopoly. In this case, when 
production is divided among more 
firms, each firm produces less, and

16-2 How Monopolies Make Production 
and Pricing Decisions 
Having seen how monopoalies arise, let’s consider how a monopoly firm decides 
how much to produce and what price to charge. The analysis of monopoly behavior 
in this section is the starting point for evaluating whether monopolies are desirable 
and what policies a government might pursue in monopoly markets. 
16-2a Monopoly versus Competition 
The key difference between a competitive firm and a monopoly is the monopoly’s 
ability to influence the price of its output. A competitive firm is small relative to 
the market in which it operates and, therefore, has no power to influence the price 
of its output. It takes the price as given by market conditions. By contrast, because 
a monopoly is the sole producer in its market, it can alter the price of its good by 
adjusting the quantity it supplies. 
One way to view this difference between a competitive firm and a monopoly is 
to consider the demand curve that each faces. In the analysis of competitive firms 
in the preceding chapter, we drew the market price as a horizontal line. Because a 
competitive firm can sell as much or as little as it wants at this price, the competitive 
firm faces a horizontal demand curve, as in panel (a) of Figure 2. In effect, because 
the competitive firm sells a product with many perfect substitutes (the products of all 
the other firms in its market), the demand curve for any one firm is perfectly elastic. 
By contrast, because a monopoly is the sole producer in its market, its demand 
curve is simply the market demand curve, which slopes downward, as in panel (b) 
of Figure 2. If the monopolist raises the price of its good, consumers buy less of it. 
Put another way, if the monopolist reduces the quantity of output it produces and 
sells, the price of its output increases. 
The market demand curve provides a constraint on a monopoly’s ability to profit 
from its market power. A monopaolist would prefer to charge a high price and sell a 
large quantity at that high price. But its demand curve makes that outcome impos￾sible. The market demand curve describes the combinations of price and quantity

Figure 2 
Demand Curves for 
Competitive and Monopoly 
Firms 
As a price taker, a competitive firm faces a horizontal demand curve, as in panel (a). 
It can sell all it wants at the going price. But a monopoly is the sole producer in its 
market, so it faces the downward-sloping market demand curve, as in panel (b). If it 
wants to sell more output, it has to accept a lower price.

available to a monopoly firm. By adjusting the quantity produced (or equivalently, 
the price charged), the monopolist can choose any point on the demand curve, but 
it can’t choose a point above the demand curve. 
What price and quantity of output will the monopolist choose? As with competi￾tive firms, we assume that the monopolist’s goal is to maximize profit. Because the 
firm’s profit is total revenue minus total costs, our next task in explaining monopoly 
behavior is to examine a monopolist’s revenue. 
16-2b A Monopoly’s Revenue 
Consider a town with a single water producer. Table 1 shows how the monopoly’s 
revenue might depend on the amount of water produced. 
Columns (1) and (2) show the monopolist’s demand schedule. If the monopolist 
produces 1 gallon of water, it can sell that gallon for $10. If it produces 2 gallons, 
it must lower the price to $9 to sell both gallons. If it produces 3 gallons, it must 
lower the price to $8. And so on. If vou graphed these two columns of numbers, 
you would get a typical downward-sloping demand curve. 
Column (3) of the table presents the monopolist’s total revenue. It equals the 
quantity sold [from column (1)] times the price [from column (2)]. Column (4) 
computes the firm’s average revenue, the amount the firm receives per unit sold. 
Average revenue is calculated by taking the number for total revenue in column 
(3) and dividing it by the quantity of output in column (1). As the previous chapter 
explained, average revenue always equals the price of the good. This is true for 
monopolists as well as for competitive firms. 
Column (5) of Table 1 computes the firm’s marginal revenue, the amount of 
revenue that the firm receives for each additional unit of output. Marginal revenue

is calculated by taking the change in total revenue when output increases by 1 unit. 
For example, when the firm increases production from 3 to 4 gallons of water, the 
total revenue it receives increases from 524 to $528. Marginal revenue from the sale 
of the fourth gallon is $28 minus $24, or $4. 
Table 1 shows an important result in the basic model of monopoly behavior: 
A monopolist’s marginal revenue is less than the price of its good. For example, 
if the firm raises the production of water from 3 to 4 gallons, it increases total 
revenue by only $4, even though it sells each gallon for $7. For a monopoly, mar￾ginal revenue is lower than price because a monopoly faces a downward-sloping 
demand curve. To increase the amount sold, a monopoly firm must lower the price 
it charges to all customers. To sell the fourth gallon of water, the monopolist must 
earn $1 less revenue for each of the first 3 gallons. This $3 loss accounts for the 
difference between the price of the fourth gallon ($7) and the marginal revenue of 
that fourth gallon ($4). 
Marginal revenue for monopolies is very different from marginal revenue for 
competitive firms. When a monopoly increases the amount it sells, there are two 
effects on total revenue (P X (J):

* The output effect: More output is sold, so Q is higher, which increases total 
revenue, 
¢ The price effect: The price falls, so P is lower, which decreases total revenue. 
Because a competitive firm can sell all it wants at the market price, there is no price 
effect. When it increases production by 1 unit, it receives the market price for that 
unit, and it does not receive any less for the units it was already selling. That is, 
because the competitive firm is a price taker, its marginal revenue equals the price 
of its good. By contrast, when a monopoly increases production by 1 unit, it must 
reduce the price it charges for every unit it sells, and this price cut reduces revenue 
from the units it was already selling. As a result, a monopoly’s marginal revenue 
is less than its price. 
Figure 3 graphs the demand curve and the marginal-revenue curve for a 
monopoly. (Because the monopoly’s price equals its average revenue, the demand 
curve is also the average-revenue curve.) These two curves always start at the same 
point on the vertical axis because the marginal revenue of the first unit sold equals 
the price of the good. But for the reason just discussed, the monopolist’s marginal 
revenue on all units after the first is less than the price. That's why a monopoly’s 
marginal-revenue curve lies below its demand curve. 
You can see in Figure 3 (as well as in Table 1) that marginal revenue can even 
become negative. That happens when the price effect on revenue outweighs the 
output effect. In this case, an additional unit of output causes the price to fall by 
enough that the firm, despite selling more units, receives less revenue. 
16-2¢ Profit Maximization 
Now that we have considered the revenue of a monopoly firm, we are ready to 
examine how such a firm maximizes profit. Recall from Chapter 1 that one of the 
Ten Principles of Economics is that rational people think at the margin. This lesson 
is as true for monopolists as it is for competitive firms. Here, we apply the logic of 
marginal analysis to the monopolist’s decision about how much to produce.

Figure 4 graphs the demand curve, the marginal-revenue curve, and the cost 
curves for a monopoly firm. These should all seem familiar: The demand and 
marginal-revenue curves are like those in Figure 3, and the cost curves are like 
those encountered in the last two chapters. These curves contain all the informa￾tion we need to determine the level of output that a profit-maximizing monopolist 
will choose. 
Suppose that the firm is producing at a low level of output, such as Q,. In this 
case, marginal revenue exceeds marginal cost. If the firm were to increase produc￾tion by 1 unit, the additional revenue would more than cover the additional costs, 
and profit would rise. In other words, when marginal revenue exceeds marginal 
cost, the firm should increase output. 
Similar reasoning applies at a high level of output, such as Q,. In this case, 
marginal cost exceeds marginal revenue. If the firm were to reduce production by 
1 unit, the costs saved would be greater than the revenue lost, increasing profit. 
Thus, when marginal cost exceeds marginal revenue, the firm should reduce output. 
In the end, the firm adjusts production until it reaches Q, , ., the quantity at 
which marginal revenue equals marginal cost. The monopolist's profit-maximizing 
quantity of output is determined by the intersection of the marginal-revenue 
curve and the marginal-cost curve. In Figure 4, this intersection occurs at point A. 
How does the monopoly find the profit-maximizing price for its product? The 
demand curve gives the answer. It relates the amount that customers are willing to 
pay to the quantity sold. After the monopoely finds the profit-maximizing quantity 
(at which MR = MC), it looks to the demand curve to find the highest price it can 
charge at that quantity. In Figure 4, the profit-maximizing price is found at point B. 
Now compare the outcomes for a competitive firm and a monopoly. They are 
alike in one way: To maximize profit, both firms choose the quantity of output at 
which marginal revenue equals marginal cost. Yet there is an important difference:

e have analyzed the price in a monopoly market using the market 
demand curve and the firm's cost curves but haven't mentioned 
the market supply curve. Yet when we analyzed prices in competitive 
markets beginning in Chapter 4, the two most important words were always 
“supply” and “demand.” 
What happened to the supply curve? Although monopolies make deci￾sions about what quantity to supply, 8 monopoly does not have a supply 
curve. A supply curve tells us the quantity that firms choose to supply at 
any given price. This concept makes sense for competitive firms, which 
are price takers. But a monopoly is a price maker, not a price taker. It is 
given price because it does not take the price as given. Instead, when 
the firm chooses the quantity to supply, that decision—along with the 
demand curve—determines the price. 
The monopolist's decision about how much to supply is impossible 
to separate from the demand curve it faces. The shape of the demand 
curve determines the shape of the marginal-revenue curve, which in turn 
determines the monopolist’s profit-maximizing quantity. In a competitive 
market, each firm’s supply decisions can be analyzed without knowing the 
demand curve, but the same is not true in a monopoly market. Therefore, 
it doesn't make sense to talk about a monopoly’s supply curve. B 
not meaningful to ask what amount such a firm would produce at any 
At the profit-maximizing quantity, the price equals marginal revenue for a competi￾tive firm but exceeds marginal revenue for a monopoly. That is: 
For a competitive firm: P = MR = MC. 
For a monopoly firm: P=MR=MC. 
This highlights a key difference between competition and monopoly: In competi￾tive markets, price equals marginal cost. In monopolized markets, price exceeds 
marginal cost. As we will see in a moment, this result is crucial to understanding 
the social cost of monopoly. 
16-2d A Monopoly’s Profit 
How much profit does a monopoly make? To see a monopoly firm’s profit in a 
graph, recall that profit equals total revenue (TR) minus total costs (TC): 
Profit = TR — TC. 
We can rewrite this as: 
Profit = (TR/Q — TC/(Q) x Q. 
TR/Q is average revenue, which equals the price, P, and TC/(Q is average total 
cost, ATC. Therefore: 
Profit = (P — ATC) = Q. 
This equation for profit (which also holds for competitive firms) allows us to mea￾sure the monopolist’s profit in our graph. 
Consider the shaded box in Figure 5. The height of the box (the segment BC) is 
price minus average total cost, P — ATC, which is the profit on the typical unit sold. 
The width of the box (the segment DC) is the quantity sold, Q,,, . The area of this 
box is the monopoly’s total profit. 
Table 2 summarizes how a monopoly maximizes profit.

Monopoly Drugs versus Generic Drugs 
According to our analysis, prices are determined differently in 
monopolized and competitive markets. A natural place to test this 
theory is the market for pharmaceutical drugs, which takes on both 
market structures. When a firm discovers a drug, patent laws give it a monopoly on 
the sale of that drug. But when the patent expires, any company can make and sell 
the drug. At that point, the market becomes competitive rather than monopolistic. 
What does theory predict will happen to the price of a drug when the patent 
expires? Consider Figure 6, which shows the market for a typical drug. The mar￾ginal cost of producing the drug is assumed to be constant here. (This is roughly 
true for many drugs.) During the life of the patent, the monopoly maximizes profit 
by producing the quantity at which marginal revenue equals marginal cost and 
charging a price well above marginal cost. But when the patent expires, the profit 
from making the drug encourages new firms to enter the market. With competition, 
the price should fall to equal marginal cost.

Experience supports the theory. When the patent on a drug expires, other com￾panies quickly enter and begin selling generics that are chemically identical to the 
former monopolist’s brand-name product. Just as theory predicts, the competitively 
produced generic drugs are priced well below the price that the monopolist was 
charging. 
The expiration of a patent, however, does not cause the monopolist to lose all 
its market power. Some consumers remain loyal to the brand-name drug, perhaps 
out of fear that the new generic drugs are not the same as the drug they have been 
using for years. As a result, the former monopolist can charge a higher price than 
its new competitors. 
For example, the drug fluoxetine, an antidepressant taken by millions of 
Americans, was originally sold under the brand name Prozac. Since the patent 
expired in 2001, consumers have had a choice between the original drug and 
generic versions. Prozac today sells for much more than generic fluoxetine. This 
price differential persists because some consumers doubt that the two pills are 
perfect substitutes. ®

Is monopoly a good way to organize a market? Unlike a competitive firm, a monopoly 
charges a price above marginal cost. For consumers, this high price makes monopoly 
undesirable. But for the owners of the firm, the high price generates more profit and 
makes monopoly extremely attractive. Is it possible that the benefits to the firm's 
owners exceed the costs imposed on consumers, making monopoly desirable from 
the standpoint of society as a whole? 
We can answer this question using the tools of welfare economics. Recall from 
Chapter 7 that total surplus measures the economic well-being of buyers and sellers 
in a market. Total surplus is the sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus. 
Consumer surplus is consumers’ willingness to pay for a good minus the amount 
they actually pay for it. Producer surplus is the amount producers receive for a 
good minus their costs of producing it. In this case, there is a single producer—the 
monopolist. 
You can probably guess the result of this analysis. Chapter 7 concluded that the 
equilibrium of supply and demand in a competitive market is not only a natural 
outcome but also a desirable one. The invisible hand of the market leads to an alloca￾tion of resources that makes total surplus as large as it can be. Because a monopoly 
leads to an allocation of resources different from that in a competitive market, the 
outcome must, in some way, fail to maximize total economic well-being. Let’s see 
why this is the case. 
16-3a The Deadweight Loss 
Consider what the monopoly firm would do if it were run by a committee of benevo￾lent social planners, a group introduced in Chapter 7. The planners care not only 
about the firm owners’ profit but also about the benefits received by consumers. The 
planners want to maximize total surplus, which equals producer surplus (profit) 
plus consumer surplus. Recall that total surplus equals the value of the good to 
consumers minus the costs of making the good incurred by the monopoly producer. 
Figure 7 analyzes how the planners would choose the monopoly’s level of out￾put. The demand curve reflects the value of the good to consumers, as measured 
by their willingness to pay for it. The marginal-cost curve reflects the costs of the 
monopolist. The socially efficient quantity is found where the demand curve and 
the marginal-cost curve intersect. Below this quantity, the value of an extra unit 
to consumers exceeds the cost of providing it, so increasing output would raise 
total surplus. Above this quantity, the cost of producing an extra unit exceeds the 
value of that unit to consumers, so decreasing output would raise total surplus. 
At the optimal quantity, the value of an extra unit to consumers exactly equals the 
marginal cost of production. 
If the social planners were running the monopoly, the firm could achieve this 
efficient outcome by charging the price found at the intersection of the demand 
and marginal-cost curves. Like a competitive firm and unlike a profit-maximizing 
monopoly, a social planner would charge a price equal to marginal cost. Because 
this price would give consumers an accurate signal about the cost of producing the 
good, consumers would buy the efficient quantity. 
We can evaluate the welfare effects of monopoly by comparing the output that 
the monopolist chooses with the output that a social planner would choose. As we 
have seen, the monopolist chooses to produce and sell the quantity of output at 
which the marginal-revenue and marginal-cost curves intersect; the social planner 
would choose the quantity at which the demand and marginal-cost curves intersect.

The Efficient Level of Output 
Social planners maximize total 
surplus in the market by choosing 
the level of output where the 
demand curve and marginal￾cost curve intersect. Below this Value 
level, the value of the good to to

in the demand curve) exceeds 
the marginal cost of making the

Figure 8 shows the comparison. The monopolist produces less than the socially 
efficient quantity of output. 
We can also view the inefficiency of monopoly in terms of the monopolist's price. 
Because the market demand curve describes a negative relationship between the 
price and quantity of the good, producing a quantity that is inefficiently low is 
equivalent to charging a price that is inefficiently high. When a monopolist charges 
a price above marginal cost, some potential consumers value the good at more than 
its marginal cost but less than the monopolist’s price. These consumers don’t buy 
the good. Because the value they place on the good exceeds the firm's cost of provid￾ing it to them, this result is inefficient. Monopoly pricing prevents some mutually 
beneficial trades from taking place. 
The inefficiency of monopoly can be measured with a deadweight loss triangle, 
as illustrated in Figure 8. Because the demand curve reflects the value to consumers 
and the marginal-cost curve reflects the costs to the monopoly producer, the area of 
the deadweight loss triangle between the demand curve and the marginal-cost curve 
eq_uals the total surplus lost because of monopoly pricing. It represents the reduction 
in economic well-being that results from the monopoly’s use of its market power. 
The deadweight loss caused by a monopoly is similar to the deadweight loss 
caused by a tax. In a sense, a monopolist is like a private tax collector. As Chapter 
8 showed, a tax on a good puts a wedge between consumers’ willingness to pay 
(as reflected by the demand curve) and producers’ costs (as reflected by the supply 
curve). Because a monopoly exerts its market power by charging a price above mar￾ginal cost, it creates a similar wedge. In both cases, the wedge causes the quantity 
sold to fall short of the social optimum. The difference between the two cases is

16-3b The Monopoly’s Profit: A Social Cost? 
It is tempting to decry monopolies for “profiteering” at the public’s expense. To 
be sure, a monopoly earns a profit by virtue of its market power. But according to 
the economic analysis of monopoly, the firm’s profit is not in itself necessarily a 
problem for society. 
Welfare in a monopolized market, as in all markets, includes the welfare of both 
consumers and producers. When a consumer pays an extra dollar to a producer 
because of a monopoly price, the consumer is worse off by a dollar, and the producer 
is better off by the same amount. Because total surplus equals the sum of consumer 
and producer surplus, this transfer from consumers to the owners of the monopoly 
does not affect the market’s total surplus. In other words, the monopoly profit itself 
represents not a reduction in the size of the economic pie but merely a bigger slice 
for producers and a smaller one for consumers. Unless consumers are for some rea￾son more deserving than producers—a normative judgment about equity that goes 
beyond the realm of economic efficiency—the monopoly profit is not a social problem. 
The problem, instead, is that the monopoly firm produces and sells a quantity of 
output below the level that maximizes total surplus. The deadweight loss measures 
how much the economic pie shrinks as a result. This inefficiency is connected to 
the monopoly’s high price: Consumers buy fewer units when the firm raises its 
price above marginal cost. But remember that the profit earned on the units that 
continue to be sold is not the problem. The problem stems from the inefficiently low 
quantity of output. Put differently, if the high monopoly price did not discourage 
some consumers from buying the good, it would raise producer surplus by exactly 
the amount it reduced consumer surplus, leaving total surplus the same as that 
achieved by the social planners.

There is, however, a possible exception to this conclusion. Suppose that a 
monopoly has to incur additional costs to maintain its position as the sole producer 
in the market. For example, a firm with a government-created monopoly might need 
to hire lobbyists to convince lawmakers to continue its monopoly. In this case, the 
monopoly may use up some of its monopoly profits paying for these additional costs. 
If so, the social loss from monopoly includes both these costs and the deadweight

customers. Yet in many cases, firms sell the same good to different customers for 
different prices, even though the costs of producing the good for the two custom￾ers are the same. This practice is called price discrimination. (Marketing experts 
sometimes call it price customization, perhaps because the word “discrimination” 
sounds negative. This book uses the standard name.) 
Before discussing the behavior of a price-discriminating monopolist, we should 
note that price discrimination is not possible in a competitive market, where many 
firms are selling the same good at the market price. No firm is willing to charge a 
lower price to any customer because it can sell all it wants at the market price. And 
if any firm tried to charge a higher price to a customer, that customer would buy 
from another firm. For a firm to price discriminate, it must have some market power. 
16-4a A Parable about Pricing 
To understand why a monopolist would price discriminate, consider an example. 
Imagine that you are the president of Readalot Publishing Company. Your best￾selling author has just written a new novel. To keep things simple, assume that you 
pay the author a flat $2 million for exclusive rights to the book and that the cost of 
printing the book is zero. Readalot’s profit, therefore, is the revenue from selling 
the book minus the 52 million it pays the author. Given these assumptions, how 
would you, as Readalot’s president, decide the book’s price? 
Your first step is to estimate the demand for the book. Readalot’s marketing 
department tells you that the book will attract two types of readers: 100,000 die-hard 
fans who are willing to pay as much as $30 and 400,000 less enthusiastic readers 
who will pay no more than $5.

Cengage Learning reserves the right o remewe addiional coment o any time if ssbseqeent nghts renmnctions require iIf Readalot charges everyone the same price, what price maximizes profit? There 
are two natural prices to consider: $30 is the most Readalot can charge and attract 
the 100,000 die-hard fans, and $%5 is the highest price that will attract the entire 
market of 500,000 potential readers. Solving this problem is a matter of simple arith￾metic. At $30, Readalot sells 100,000 copies, has revenue of $3 million, and makes 
$1 million in profit. At $5, it sells 500,000 copies, has revenue of $2.5 million, and 
makes $500,000. The profit-maximizing strategy is to charge $30 and say goodbye 
to the 400,000 less enthusiastic readers. 
Readalot’s decision causes a deadweight loss. There are 400,000 readers will￾ing to pay $5 for the book, and the marginal cost of providing it to them is zero. 
Society loses $2 million of total surplus when Readalot charges the higher price. 
This deadweight loss is the inefficiency that arises whenever a monopolist charges 
a price above marginal cost. 
Now suppose that Readalot’'s marketing department makes a discovery: The 
Pacific Ocean separates these two groups of readers. The die-hard fans live in 
Awustralia, the less hard-core readers live in the United States, and readers in one 
country can’t easily buy books in the other. 
Eureka! Readalot quickly changes its marketing strategy. It charges the 100,000 
Australian readers $30 for the book, while asking only $5 of the 400,000 American 
readers. Now, revenue is $3 million in Australia and %2 million in the United States, 
for a total of $5 million. Profit is $3 million, a lot more than the $1 million the com￾pany could earn by charging the same $30 price to all customers. As Readalot’s 
president, you embrace this strategy of price discrimination. 
The story of Readalot Publishing is hypothetical, but it describes the business 
practice of many companies. Consider the prices of hardcover books, e-books, and 
paperbacks. When a publisher has a new novel, it initially releases an expensive 
hardcover edition and an e-book, usually at a lower price. For readers who prefer 
print but won't pay the high price of a hardcover, it later releases a cheaper paper￾back edition. The price differences among these various editions far exceed the 
differences in marginal production costs. The publisher is price discriminating by 
selling the hardcover to die-hard fans, the e-book to those who prefer the lower 
cost and don’t mind reading on a tablet, and the paperback to price-sensitive print 
readers, thereby maximizing its profit. 
16-4b The Moral of the Story 
Like any parable, the story of Readalot Publishing is stylized, yet it contains some 
important truths. This parable teaches three lessons about price discrimination. 
The first is that price discrimination is a rational strategy for a profit￾maximizing monopolist. By charging different prices to different customers, a 
monopolist can increase its profit. In essence, a price-discriminating monopolist 
charges prices closer to each customer’s willingness to pay than is possible with 
a single price. 
The second lesson is that for price discrimination to work, the seller must be able 
to separate customers according to their willingness to pay. In the Readalot story, 
customers were separated geographically. But monopolists can use other differences, 
such as age or income, to distinguish among customers. 
A corollary to this second lesson is that certain market forces can prevent firms 
from price discriminating. One such force is arbitrage, the process of buying a good 
in one market at a low price and selling it in another market at a higher price to profit 
from the price difference. Suppose that in our example, Australian bookstores could 
buy the book in the United States and resell it to Australian readers. This arbitrage

Welfare with and without 
Price Discrimination 
would prevent Readalot from price discriminating because no Australian would 
buy the book at the higher price. 
The third lesson may be the most surprising: Price discrimination can raise welfare 
as measured by total surplus. Recall that a deadweight loss arises when Readalot 
charges a single 530 price because the 400,000 less enthusiastic readers don't get the 
book, even though they value it at more than its marginal cost of production. But when 
Readalot price discriminates, all readers buy the book, and the outcome is efficient. 
Thus, price discrimination can eliminate the inefficiency inherent in monopoly pricing. 
Note that in this example, the increase in welfare from price discrimination shows 
up as higher producer surplus rather than higher consumer surplus. Consumers 
are no better off for having bought the book: The price they pay exactly equals 
the value they place on the book, so they receive no consumer surplus. The entire 
increase in total surplus from price discrimination accrues to Readalot Publishing 
in the form of higher profit. 
16-4¢ The Analytics of Price Discrimination 
Let’s consider a bit more formally how price discrimination affects welfare. We 
begin by assuming that the monopolist can price discriminate perfectly. Perfect 
price discrimination describes a situation in which the monopolist knows exactly 
each customer s willingness to pay and can charge each customer a different price. 
In this case, the monopolist charges customers exactly their willingness to pay, and 
the monopolist gets the entire surplus in every transaction. 
Figure 9 shows producer and consumer surplus with and without price 
discrimination. To keep things simple, this figure is drawn assuming constant 
unit costs—that is, marginal cost and average total cost are constant and equal. 
Without price discrimination, the firm charges a single price above marginal cost, as in 
Panel (a) shows a monopoly that charges the same price to all customers. Total surplus in 
this market equals the sum of profit (producer surplus) and consumer surplus. Panel (b) 
shows a monopoly that can price discriminate perfectly. Because consumer surplus equals 
zero, total surplus now equals the firm's profit. Comparing these two panels, you can see that 
perfect price discrimination raises profit, raises total surplus, and lowers consumer surplus.

Because some potential customers who value the good at more than mar￾ginal cost do not buy it at this high price, the monopoly causes a deadweight loss. Yet 
when a firm can price discriminate perfectly, as in panel (b), all customers who value 
the good at more than marginal cost buy it and are charged their willingness to pay. 
Every mutually beneficial trade takes place, no deadweight loss occurs, and the entire 
surplus derived from the market goes to the monopoly producer in the form of profit. 
In reality, of course, price discrimination is not perfect. Customers do not walk 
into stores with signs displaying their willingness to pay. Instead, firms price dis￾criminate by dividing customers into groups: young versus old, weekday versus 
weekend shoppers, Americans versus Australians, print versus e-book readers, 
and so on. Unlike those in the parable of Readalot Publishing, customers within 
each group differ in their willingness to pay for the product, making perfect price 
discrimination impossible. 
How does this imperfect price discrimination affect welfare as measured by 
total surplus? The analysis of these pricing schemes is complicated, and it turns 
out that there is no general answer to this question. Compared with the single￾price monopoly outcome, imperfect price discrimination can raise, lower, or leave 
unchanged the total surplus in a market. The only certain conclusion is that price 
discrimination raises the monopoly’s profit; otherwise, the firm would choose to 
charge all customers the same price. 
16-4d Examples of Price Discrimination 
Firms in the economy use various business strategies to charge different [Jrices to 
different customers. Here are some examples. 
Movie Tickets Many movie theaters charge a lower price for children and people 
over 65 than for other patrons. This is hard to explain in a competitive market 
where price equals marginal cost because the marginal cost of providing a seat is 
the same for anyone of any age. Yet the differential pricing is easily explained if 
movie theaters have some local monopoly power and if children and older people 
have a lower willingness to pay for a ticket. In this case, movie theaters increase 
their profit by price discriminating,. 
Airline Prices Seats on airplanes are sold at many different prices. Most airlines 
charge a lower price for a round-trip ticket between two cities if the traveler stays 
over a Saturday night. At first, this scems odd. Why should it matter to the airline 
whether a passenger stays over a Saturday night? The reason is that this rule 
provides a way to separate business and leisure travelers. Passengers on business 
trips have a high willingness to pay and, most likely, do not want to stay over a 
Saturday night because business meetings are rarely held during weekends. But 
passengers on vacation or visiting friends and family have a lower willingness 
to pay and are more likely to want to spend the weekend at their destinations. 
For airlines, charging lower prices to passengers who stay over a Saturday night 
is successful price discrimination. 
Discount Opportunities Many companies offer discount coupons online and 
in newspapers and magazines. And some vendors offer online savings on special 
days that occur so frequently that they aren't really very special. To get a discount, 
a buyer simply has to clip a coupon or buy on the right day. Why do companies 
bother? Why don’t they just cut the price of the product in the first place? 
The answer is that these strategies allow companies to price discriminate. 
Companies know that not all customers are willing to spend time clipping

coupons or navigating online bargains. Moreover, the willingness to seek bargains 
is related to customers” willingness to pay for the good. Rich and busy executives 
are unlikely to spend their time doing so, and they are probably willing to pay a 
higher price for many goods. The unemployed are more likely to hunt for cheaper 
deals and have a lower willingness to pay. By charging a lower price only to those 
customers willing to spend the time to seek discounts, firms can successfully price 
discriminate. 
Financial Aid Many colleges and universities give financial aid based on family 
income. One can view this policy as a type of price discrimination. Students from 
wealthy families have greater financial resources and, therefore, a higher willing￾ness to pay than students from lower-income families. By charging high tuition 
and selectively offering financial aid, schools in effect charge prices to customers 
based on the value they place on going to that school. This behavior is like that of 
any price-discriminating monopolist. 
Quantity Discounts So far in these examples of price discrimination, the 
monopolist charges different prices to different customers. Sometimes, however, 
monopolists price discriminate by charging different prices to the same customer for 
different units that the customer buys. For example, many firms offer lower prices 
to customers who buy large quantities. A bakery might charge $0.50 for each donut 
but $5 for a dozen. This is a form of price discrimination because customers pay a 
higher price for the first unit they buy than for the twelfth. Quantity discounts are 
often a successful way to price discriminate because customers’ willingness to pay 
for an additional unit declines as they buy more units.

16-5 Public Policy toward Monopolies 
Unlike competitive markets, monopolies fail to allocate resources efficiently. They 
produce less than the socially desirable quantity of output and charge prices above 
marginal cost. Government policymakers can deal with the problem of monopoly 
in several ways: 
By trying to make monopolized industries more competitive 
By regulating the behavior of the monopolies 
By turning some private monopolies into public enterprises 
By doing nothing at all

If Coca-Cola and PepsiCo wanted to merge, the federal government would 
scrutinize the deal before it went into effect. The lawyers and economists 
in the Department of Justice might well decide that a merger between 
these two large soft-drink companies would make the U.S. soft-drink 
market substantially less competitive and, as a result, would reduce the 
well-being of the country as a whole. If so, the Department of Justice 
companies would not be allowed to merge. Traditionally, the courts are

In other words, if a company wants to merge with a competitor, it will

one of its customers. 
laws, statutes aimed at curbing monopoly power. In the United States, 
the first and most important of these laws was the Sherman Antitrust Act, 
passed in 1890 to reduce the market power of “trusts,” the dominant monopolies of 
that era. The Clayton Antitrust Act, passed in 1914, strengthened the government’s 
powers and authorized private lawsuits. As the U.S. Supreme Court put it, the anti￾trust laws are “a comprehensive charter of economic liberty aimed at preserving 
free and unfettered competition as the rule of trade.” 
The antitrust laws give the government tools to promote competition. They allow 
the government to prevent mergers and, at times, to break up large companies. 
The antitrust laws also prevent companies from colluding to reduce competition. 
Stopping mergers and breaking up companies can have costs as well as benefits. 
Sometimes, companies combine to lower costs through more efficient joint produc￾tion. These advantages are called synergies. For example, many U.S. banks have 
merged in recent years to reduce administrative expenses. The airline industry 
has also experienced consolidation. If antitrust laws are to raise social welfare, the 
government must be able to determine which mergers are desirable and which are 
not. That is, it must measure and compare the social benefit from synergies with the 
social costs of reduced competition. It is open to debate whether the government 
can perform the necessary cost-benefit analysis with sufficient accuracy. In the end, 
the application of antitrust laws is often controversial, even among the experts. 
16-5b Regulation 
Another way the government deals with the problem of monopoly is by regulating 
monopolists” behavior. This solution is common for natural monopolies, such as 
water and electric companies, whose prices are often regulated by the government. 
What price should the government set for a natural monopoly? This question 
is not as easy as it might at first appear. One might conclude that the price should 
equal the monopolist’s marginal cost. If price equals marginal cost, customers will 
buy the quantity of the monopolist’s output that maximizes total surplus, and the 
allocation of resources will be efficient. 
Yet two practical problems arise with marginal-cost pricing as a regulatory system. 
The first arises from the logic of cost curves. By definition, natural monopolies have 
declining average total cost. As we discussed in a previous chapter, when average 
total cost is declining, marginal cost is less than average total cost. This situation is

Price Marginal-Cost Pricing for a 
Natural Monopoly 
Because a natural monopoly 
has declining average total 
cost, marginal cost is less than 
average total cost. Therefore,

to marginal cost, the price will be

illustrated in Figure 10, which shows a firm with a large fixed 
cost and then a constant marginal cost thereafter. If regulators 
were to set price equal to marginal cost, that price would be 
less than the firm’s average total cost, and the firm would lose 
money. Instead of charging such a low price, the monopoly firm 
would just exit the industry. 
Regulators can respond to this problem in various ways, none 
of which is perfect. One way is to subsidize the monopolist. In 
essence, the government picks up the losses inherent in marginal￾cost pricing. Yet to finance the subsidy, the government needs to 
raise money through taxation, which itself generates deadweight 
losses. Alternatively, the regulators can allow the monopolist 
to charge a price higher than marginal cost. If the regulated 
price equals average total cost, the monopolist earns exactly zero 
economic profit. Yet average-cost pricing leads to deadweight 
losses because the monopolist’s price no longer reflects the mar￾ginal cost of producing the good. In essence, average-cost pricing 
is like a tax on the good the monopolist is selling. 
The second problem with marginal-cost pricing as a regula￾tory system (and with average-cost pricing as well) is that it 
gives the monopolist no incentive to reduce costs. Each firm in 
a competitive market tries to reduce its costs because lower costs 
mean higher profits. But if a regulated monopolist knows that 
regulators will reduce prices whenever costs fall, the monopolist 
won't benefit from lower costs. In practice, regulators deal with 
this problem by allowing monopolists to keep some of the ben￾efits from lower costs in the form of higher profit, a practice that 
requires some departure from marginal-cost pricing.

The third policy for dealing with monopoly is public ownership. That is, rather 
than regulating a natural monopoly run by a private firm, a government unit can 
run the monopoly itself. This solution is common in European countries, where 
the government owns and operates utilities such as telephone, water, and electric 
companies. It's fairly common in the United States, too. The government runs the 
Postal Service, which is often considered to be a natural monopoly. And there are 
many publicly owned water and power utilities throughout the country. 
While public ownership of natural monopolies often has popular support, many 
economists prefer private to public ownership. The key issue is how the ownership 
affects the costs of production. Private owners have an incentive to minimize costs 
as long as they reap part of the benefit in the form of higher profit. If the managers 
do a bad job of keeping costs down, the firm’s owners will fire them. But if public 
employees do a bad job, the losers are the customers and taxpayers, whose only 
recourse is the political system. Public employees may become a special-interest 
group and seek to bend the political system to their advantage. Put simply, as a 
way of ensuring that firms are efficiently run, the voting booth is less reliable than 
the profit motive. 
16-5d Above All, Do No Harm 
Each of the foregoing policies aimed at reducing the problem of monopoly has 
drawbacks. As a result, some economists argue that the government should be 
careful not to make matters worse when dealing with monopoly pricing. Here is the 
assessment of George Stigler, who won the Nobel Prize for his work in industrial 
organization. 
A famous theorem in economics states that a competitive enterprise economy 
will produce the largest possible income from a given stock of resources. No 
real economy meets the exact conditions of the theorem, and all real economies 
will fall short of the ideal economy—a difference called “market failure.” In 
my view, however, the degree of “market failure” for the American economy 
is much smaller than the “political failure” arising from the imperfections of 
economic policies found in real political systems. 
As this quotation suggests, the political world is sometimes even less perfect than a 
highly imperfect market. An institute at the University of Chicago named after Stigler 
continues to analyze the uneasy relationship between the power of monopolies and 
the political system. The best solution isn’t always clear. In some, though not all, 
cases, it may be wiser to do nothing.

Antitrust's New Mission: 
Preserving Democracy, Not 
Efficiency 
By Greg Ip 
mazon.com Inc.’s proposed acquisition of 
film studio MGM would ordinarily provoke 
little antitrust concern. MGM's share of box 
office receipts is tiny and Amazon’s entertain￾ment footprint is relatively small. 
But Amazon of course does much more 
than make movies: it is the country’s largest 
e-commerce and cloud-computing company, 
and a dominant seller of books, videos and 
music. Founder and Executive Chairman Jeff 
Bezos owns the Washington Post. In their 
totality, then, Amazon and Mr. Bezos repre￾sent a significant concentration of economic 
and cultural influence. For a new generation 
of trustbusters, that's a bigger concern than 
the efficiency benefits a merger might bring. 
“There is sound reason to ask whether permit￾ting Amazon to leverage its platform to integrate 
334 PartV Firm Behavior and the Organization of Industry 
across business lines hands it undue economic 
and political power,” then law student Lina Khan 
wrote in a now famous |aw jounal article in 2017. 
Last month, President Biden named the 
32-year-old Ms. Khan chairwoman of the 
Federal Trade Commission. At a confirmation 
hearing in April, she said antitrust’s histori￾cal role is to “protect our economy and our 
democracy from unchecked monopoly power.” 
Ms. Khan embodies the neo-Brandeisian 
movement, named for Louis Brandeis, a crusad￾ing lawyer and later Supreme Court justice who 
argued bigness was both inefficient and antitheti￾cal to liberty. “Size, we are told, is not a crime,” 
he wrote in 1914, “But size may, at least, become 
noxious by reason of the means through which 
it was attained or the uses to which it is put.” 
For Brandeis, democracy included the free￾dom of a worker to negotiate with their employ￾er, a supplier with a retailer and vice versa, 
and a farmer with his bank, which required a 
plurality of market participants. “He feared that 
as the corporations became large and power￾ful, they took on a life of their own, becoming 
increasingly insensitive to humanity's wants 
and fears,” Columbia University law professor 
Tim Wu wrote in a 2018 book. Mr. Wu now serves 
on Mr. Biden's National Economic Council. 
For decades that's how courts and regula￾tors interpreted antitrust laws, regularly ruling 
against mergers and business practices such 
as exclusivity deals between suppliers and 
customers. 
In the 1970s that approach came under 
attack by conservatives led by the late legal 
scholar Robert Bork, who had served under 
Richard Nixon. “The only legitimate goal of 
American antitrust law is the maximization of 
consumer welfare," he wrote in his 1978 book 
“The Antitrust Paradox.” Companies got big 
by becoming more efficient, which benefited 
consumers, he wrote. Judges and regulators, 
lacking even a “rudimentary understanding 
of market economics,” deprived consumers 
of these efficiency benefits when they blocked 
mergers in pursuit of a “grab bag" of political 
and social objectives. 
The consumer welfare standard has come to 
govern antitrust. But in the last decade rising eco￾nomic concentration, high profit margins, declin￾ing business startups and subdued investment all 
suggest monopoly power is growing again. 
Meanwhile, Mr. Biden's election has coin￾cided with a backlash against the pro-market 
principles that have governed economic 
policy for decades. Progressives blame the 
obsession with efficiency for aggravating 
inequality and racial disparities; conserva￾tive populists blame free trade for hollowing

16-6 Conclusion: The Prevalence of Monopolies 
This chapter has discussed the behavior of firms that have control over the prices 
they charge. We have seen that such firms behave very differently from the com￾petitive firms studied in the previous chapter. Table 3 summarizes some of the key 
similarities and differences between competitive and monopoly markets. 
An important finding for public policy is that a monopolist produces less than the 
efficient quantity and charges a price above marginal cost. As a result, a monopoly 
causes deadweight losses. Price discrimination can sometimes mitigate these inef￾ficiencies. But other times, they call for policymakers to take an active role.

web advertising and electronic commerce. 
Judged only by consumer welfare, this doesn’t 
seem to present a problem: their products are 
cheap or il'EE, and extremely popular. Judged by 
concentrations of power, it's problematic: their 
control of essential platforms leave individual 
merchants, app developers, content providers 
and users next to no bargaining power since 
they have so few alternatives. Barriers to 
entry are high to insurmountable for poten￾tial competitors. They determine what artistic 
and political content billions of users share 
and see. 
Before becoming FTC chair Ms. Khan had 
advocated either barring platform operators 
like Amazon from competing with users of that 
platform; or regulating them like utilities. She 
would ban vertical mergers—that is, between 
two components of the same supply chain, for 
example a supplier of content such as MGM and 
a distributor such as Amazon—once a plat￾form operator has reached a dominant size. She 
hasn't commented on Amazon since becoming 
chair. Nonetheless, citing thess views, Amazon 
has asked Ms. Khan to recuse herself from FTG 
investigations of the company. 
Under Ms. Khan's vision, the risk that a 
business structure could enable anticompeti￾tive behavior matters more than evidence of 
that behavior such as higher prices. 
But that approach carries risks of its own. 
Lack of evidence could lead to weak cases

that fail in court. A federal judge dismissed 
a lawsuit by the FTC and most state 
attorneys-general for failing to establish 
that Faceboak Inc. is a monopoly. Bills proposed 
by Democrats in the House of Representatives 
would lower the bar for winning such suits, but 
their fate is unclear. Barring firms fram getting 
big could deprive consumers of the benefits 
that only big firms can deliver. Millions relied 
on Amazon's heft when the pandemic kept them 
out of stores. 
And while neo-Brandeisians worry about 
abuse of corporate power, Mr. Bork’s acolytes 
worry about abuse of antitrust authority. In 
2018, the Department of Justice tried, unsuc￾cessfully, to stop AT&T Inc. from acquiring 
Time Warner Inc., in @ move many saw as

motivated by then President Donald Trump's 
personal animosity toward CNN, a unit of 
Time Wamer. 
For all its flaws, antitrust governed by the 
consumer welfare standard is less at risk of 
politicization than beliefs about what's good 
or bad for democracy. Il 
Questions to Discuss 
1. Do you think policymakers should be 
concerned with more than the economic 
impact of large businesses? Why or

2. What risks do you see in expanding the 
scope of antitrust laws? 
How prevalent are the problems of monopoly? 
In one sense, monopolies are common. Most firms have some control over the 
prices they charge. They are not forced to charge the market price for their goods 
because their goods are not exactly the same as those offered by other firms. A Tesla 
is not the same as an electric Mustang. Ben and Jerry's ice cream is not the same as 
Breyer's. Each of these goods has a downward-sloping demand curve, which gives 
the producer some degree of monopoly power. 
Yet firms with substantial monopoly power are rare. Few goods are truly 
unique. Most have substitutes that, even if not exactly the same, are similar. Ben 
and Jerry can raise the price of their ice cream a little without losing all their sales,

but if they raise it a lot, sales will fall substantially as their customers switch to 
other brands. 
In the end, monopoly power is a matter of degree. It is true that many firms have 
some monopoly power. Still, for most firms, their monopoly power is limited. In 
many situations, we will not go far wrong assuming that firms operate in competi￾tive markets, even if that is not precisely the case. 
Chapter in a Nutshell 
* A monopoly is the sole seller in its market. A = Like a competitive firm, a monopoly maximizes profit 
monopoly arises when a single firm owns a key 
resource, when the government gives a firm the 
exclusive right to produce a good, or when a single 
firm can supply the entire market at a lower cost than 
many firms could. 
Because a monopoly is the sole producer in its mar￾ket, it faces a downward-sloping demand curve for 
its product. When a monopoly increases production 
by 1 unit, it causes the price of its good to fall, which 
reduces the amount of revenue earned on all units pro￾duced. As a result, a monopoly’s marginal revenue is 
always less than the price of its good. 
by producing the quantity at which marginal revenue 
equals marginal cost. The monopoly then sets the price 
at which consumers demand that quantity. Unlike a 
competitive firm, a monopoly’s price exceeds its mar￾ginal revenue, so its price exceeds marginal cost. 
A monopolist’s profit-maximizing output is below the 
level that maximizes the sum of consumer and pro￾ducer surplus. That is, when the monopoly charges a 
price above marginal cost, some consumers who value 
the good more than its cost of production don't buy 
it. As a result, monopoly leads to deadweight losses 
similar to those that arise from taxes.

different prices for the same good based on a buyer’s 
willingness to pay. This practice of price discrimina￾tion can raise economic welfare by getting the good 
to some consumers who would otherwise not buy

welfare compared with the outcome from a single 
monopoly price. 
Policymakers can respond to the inefficiency of 
monopoly behavior in several ways. They can use 
the antitrust laws to try to make the industry more 
competitive. They can regulate the prices that the 
monopoly charges. They can turn the monopolist into 
a government-run enterprise. Or, if the market failure 
is deemed small compared with the inevitable imper￾fections of policies, they can do nothing at all.

C, to price discriminate. How would a monopolist

(Give your answer in terms of X, Y, Z, and C.) 
f. How would a social planner who cares about total 
surplus decide whether the monopolist should

g. Compare your answers to parts (e) and (f). 
How does the monopolist's incentive to price 
discriminate differ from the social planner’s? Is it

fou walk into a bookstore to buy a book to read. On the 
store’s shelves, you find a James Patterson thriller, a Maya 
Angelou memoir, a Ron Chernow history, a Stephenie 
Mevyer paranormal romance, and many other choices. When you 
pick out a book and buy it, what kind of market are you partici￾pating in? 
On the one hand, the market for books seems competitive. As 
you browse, hundreds of authors and publishers vie for your atten￾tion. And because anyone can enter the industry by writing and 
publishing a book, the business is not very profitable. For every 
highly paid writer, there are dozens of struggling ones. 
On the other hand, the market for books also seems monopo￾listic. Because each title is unique, publishers have some latitude 
in pricing. Sellers in this market are price makers rather than price 
takers, and the price of books greatly exceeds the marginal cost of 
producing them. The list price of a typical hardcover novel, for 
instance, is about $30, but the cost of printing one additional copy 
is less than $1(). The price of e-books is often around $15, while the 
marginal cost of permitting one extra download is zero. 
- 342 PartV Firm Behavior and the Organization of Industry 
The market for books fits neither the competitive nor the monopoly model. 
Instead, it is best described by the model of monopolistic competition, the subject 
of this chapter. The term “monopaolistic competition” might at first seem to be an 
oxymoron, like “jumbo shrimp.” But as we will see, monopolistically competitive 
industries are monopolistic in some ways and competitive in others. The model 
describes not only the publishing industry but also the market for many other 
goods and services. 
17-1 Between Monopoly and Perfect Competition

a market structure in 
which only a few sellers 
offer similar or identical 
products 
monopolistic 
competition 
a market structure in 
which many firms sell 
products that are similar 
but not identical 
The previous two chapters analyzed markets with many competitive firms and 
markets with a single monopoly firm. Chapter 15 showed that the price in a perfectly 
competitive market always equals the marginal cost of production. In addition, in 
the long run, entry and exit drive economic profit to zero, so the price also equals 
average total cost. Chapter 16 examined how a monopoly firm can use its market 
power to keep price above marginal cost, leading to a positive economic profit for 
the firm and a deadweight loss for society. Perfect competition and monopoly are 
two extreme forms of market structure. Perfect competition describes a market with 
many firms offering essentially identical products; monopoly describes a market 
with only one firm. 
Although the cases of perfect competition and monopoly illustrate important 
ideas about how markets work, most markets in the real world include elements 
of both these cases and are not completely described by either of them. The typical 
firm faces competition, but the competition is not so rigorous that it makes the firm 
a price taker like the firms in Chapter 15. The typical firm also has some degree 
of market power, but not so much that the firm can be described exactly by the 
monaopoly model in Chapter 16. In other words, many industries fall somewhere 
between the polar cases of perfect competition and monopoly. Economists call this 
situation imperfect competition. 
One type of imperfectly competitive market is an oligopoly, a market with 
only a few sellers, each offering a product similar or identical to those of other 
sellers in the market. Economists often measure a market’'s domination by a 
small number of firms with a statistic called the concentration ratio, which is 
the percentage of total output in the market supplied by the four largest firms. 
In the U.5. economy, most industries have a four-firm concentration ratio under 
50 percent, but in some industries, the biggest firms are more dominant. Industries 
with four-firm concentration ratios of 90 percent or more include aircraft manu￾facturing, tobacco, passenger car rentals, and express delivery services. These 
industries are best described as oligopolies. As the next chapter discusses, the 
small number of firms in oligopolies makes strategic interactions among them 
crucial to how these markets work. When deciding how much to produce and 
what price to charge, each firm in an oligopoly is concerned not only with what 
its competitors are doing but also with how its competitors would react to what 
it might do. 
A second type of imperfectly competitive market is called monopolistic 
competition, a market structure in which many firms sell similar but not identical 
products. In such a market, each firm has a monopoly over its product, but many 
other firms make similar products that compete for the same customers.

To be more precise, monopolistic competition describes a market with the 
following attributes: 
* Many sellers: Numerous firms are competing for the same group of 
customers. 
* Product differentiation: Each firm offers a product that is at least slightly 
different from those of other firms. Rather than being a price taker, each firm 
faces a downward-sloping demand curve. 
* Free entry and exit: Firms can enter or exit the market without restriction. 
The number of firms in the market adjusts until economic profits are driven 
to zero. 
A moment’s thought reveals a long list of markets with these attributes: books, video 
games, restaurants, piano lessons, cookies, clothing, and so on. 
Monopolistic competition, like oligopoly, is a market structure that lies between 
the extreme cases of perfect competition and monopoly. But oligopoly and monopo￾listic competition are quite different. Oligopoly departs from the perfectly competi￾tive ideal of Chapter 15 because the market has only a few sellers. The small number 
of sellers makes rigorous competition less likely and strategic interactions among 
them vitally important. By contrast, a monopolistically competitive market has 
many sellers, each of which is small compared with the market. It departs from the 
perfectly competitive ideal because each seller offers a somewhat different product. 
Figure 1 summarizes the four types of market structure. The first question to ask 
about any market is how many firms there are. If there is only one firm, the market 
is a monopoly. If there are only a few, it is an oligopoly. If there are many firms, we 
need to ask another question: Do they sell identical or differentiated products? If 
their products are identical, the market is perfectly competitive. But if their products 
are differentiated, the market is monopolistically competitive.

Because reality is never as clear-cut as theory, you may sometimes find it hard 
to decide what structure best describes a particular market. There is, for instance, 
no magic number that separates “few” from “many” when counting the number 
of firms. (Do the approximately dozen companies that sell cars in the United States 
make the market an oligopoly, or is it more competitive? The answer is open to 
debate.) Similarly, there is no sure way to determine when products are differenti￾ated and when they are largely identical. (Are different brands of milk really the 
same? Again, the answer is debatable.) When analyzing actual markets, economists 
must keep in mind the lessons learned from studying all types of market structures 
and then apply each lesson as they deem appropriate. 
Having defined the various market structures, let’s continue our analysis of each 
of them. This chapter examines monopolistic competition, and the next examines 
oligopoly.

17-2 Competition with Differentiated Products 
To understand monopolistically competitive markets, we first consider the decisions 
facing an individual firm. We then examine what happens in the long run as firms 
enter and exit the industry. Next, we compare the equilibrium under monopolistic 
competition to the equilibrium under perfect competition that we examined in 
Chapter 15. Finally, we discuss whether the outcome in a monopolistically competi￾tive market is desirable from the standpoint of society as a whole. 
17-2a The Monopolistically Competitive Firm in the Short Run 
Each firm in a monopolistically competitive market is, in many ways, like a monop￾oly. Because its product differs from those offered by other firms, its demand curve 
slopes down. (By contrast, a perfectly competitive firm faces a horizontal demand 
curve at the market price.) The monopolistically competitive firm follows a monopo￾list’s rule for profit maximization: It produces the quantity at which marginal revenue 
equals marginal cost and then uses its demand curve to find the price at which it 
can sell that quantity. 
Figure 2 shows the cost, demand, and marginal-revenue curves for two typical 
firms, each in a different monopolistically competitive industry. In both panels, the 
profit-maximizing quantity is found where the marginal-revenue and marginal-cost 
curves intersect. The two panels show different outcomes for the firm's profit. In 
panel (a), price exceeds average total cost, so the firm makes a profit. In panel (b), 
price is below average total cost. In this case, the firm cannot make a positive profit, 
so the best it can do is to minimize its losses.

All this should seem familiar. A monopolistically competitive firm chooses its 
quantity and price just as a monopoly does. In the short run, these two market 
structures are similar.

17-2b The Long-Run Equilibrium 
The situations depicted in Figure 2 do not last long. When firms are making profits, 
as in panel (a), new firms have an incentive to enter the market. This entry increases 
the number of products from which customers can choose and, therefore, reduces the 
demand faced by each firm already in the market. In other words, profit encourages 
entry, and entry shifts the demand curves of the incumbent firms to the left. As the 
demand for incumbent firms’ products falls, these firms experience declining profits. 
Conversely, when firms are making losses, as in panel (b), firms in the market 
have an incentive to exit. As firms exit, customers have fewer products from which 
to choose. This decrease in the number of firms expands the demand faced by those 
that stay in the market. In other words, losses encourage exit, and exit shifts the 
demand curves of the remaining firms to the right. With increased demand, the 
remaining firms enjoy greater profits (that is, their losses decline). 
This process of entry and exit continues until the firms in the market make exactly 
zero economic profit. Figure 3 depicts the long-run equilibrium. Once the market 
reaches this equilibrium, new firms have no incentive to enter, and existing firms 
have no incentive to exit. 
Notice that the demand curve in this figure just barely touches the average-total￾cost curve. Mathematically, the two curves are said to be tangent to each other. 
These two curves must be tangent once entry and exit have driven profit to zero. 
Because profit per unit sold is the difference between price (found on the demand 
curve) and average total cost, the maximum profit is zero only if these two curves 
touch each other without crossing. Also, note that this point of tangency occurs at 
the same quantity where marginal revenue equals marginal cost. That these two 
points line up is not a coincidence: It is required because this quantity maximizes 
profit, which must be exactly zero in the long run.

To sum up, two characteristics describe the long-run equilibrium in a monopo￾listically competitive market: 
* Asin a monopoly market, price exceeds marginal cost (P = MC). This occurs 
because profit maximization requires marginal revenue to equal marginal 
cost (MR = MC) and because the downward-sloping demand curve makes 
marginal revenue less than the price (MR < P). 
* Asin a perfectly competitive market, price equals average total cost 
(P = ATC). This arises because free entry and exit drive economic profit to 
zero in the long run. 
The second characteristic shows how monopolistic competition differs from 
monopoly. Because a monopoly is the sole seller of a product without close 
substitutes, it can earn positive economic profit, even in the long run. By contrast, 
because monopolistically competitive markets have free entry, the economic profit 
of a firm in this type of market is driven to zero in the long run. 
17-2¢ I\-Iunupu]ifific versus Perfect Competition 
Figure 4 compares the long-run equilibria under monopolistic competition and 
perfect competition. (Chapter 15 discussed the equilibrium with perfect competition.) 
There are two noteworthy differences: excess capacity and the markup.

Excess Capacity As we have just seen, the process of entry and exit drives each 
firm in a monopolistically competitive market to a point of tangency between its 
demand and average-total-cost curves. Panel (a) of Figure 4 shows that the quantity 
of output at this point is smaller than the quantity that minimizes average total 
cost. Under monopolistic competition, firms produce on the downward-sloping 
portion of their average-total-cost curves. In this way, monopolistic competition 
contrasts starkly with perfect competition. As panel (b) of Figure 4 shows, free 
entry in competitive markets drives firms to produce at the minimum of average 
total cost. 
The quantity that minimizes average total cost is called the efficient scale of the 
firm. In the long run, perfectly competitive firms produce at the efficient scale, while 
monapolistically competitive firms produce below this level. Firms are said to have 
excess capacity under monopolistic competition. In other words, a monopolistically 
competitive firm, unlike a perfectly competitive firm, could increase the quantity 
it produces and lower the average total cost of production. The firm forgoes this 
opportunity because, to sell the additional output, it would need to cut its price 
for all the units it produces. It is more profitable for a monopolistic competitor to 
continue operating with excess capacity. 
Markup over Marginal Cost A second difference between perfect competition 
and monopolistic competition is the relationship between price and marginal cost. 
For a perfectly competitive firm, such as the one in panel (b) of Figure 4, price equals 
marginal cost. For a monopolistically competitive firm, such as the one in panel 
(a), price exceeds marginal cost because the firm always has some market power. 
How is this markup over marginal cost consistent with free entry and zero profit? 
The zero-profit condition ensures only that price equals average total cost. It does 
not ensure that price equals marginal cost. Indeed, in the long-run equilibrium, 
monopolistically competitive firms operate on the declining portion of their average￾total-cost curves, so marginal cost is below average total cost. For price to equal 
average total cost, price must be above marginal cost. 
This relationship between price and marginal cost highlights a key difference 
between perfect competitors and monopolistic competitors. Imagine that you were 
to ask a firm the following question: “Would you like to see another customer 
come through your door ready to buy from you at your current price?” A perfectly 
competitive firm would answer that it didn’t care. Because price exactly equals mar￾ginal cost, the profit from an extra unit sold is zero. By contrast, a monopolistically 
competitive firm is always eager to get another customer. Because its price exceeds 
marginal cost, an extra unit sold at the posted price means more profit. 
An old economist’s joke says that monopolistically competitive markets are those 
in which sellers send holiday cards to buyers. Currying favor with customers to 
attract more of them makes sense only if price exceeds marginal cost. And since 
the business practice of sending out holiday cards is widespread, monopolistically 
competitive markets must be commonplace. 
17-2d Monopolistic Competition and the Welfare of Society 
Is the outcome in a monopolistically competitive market desirable from the 
standpoint of society as a whole? Can government policymakers improve on the 
market outcome? Previous chapters evaluated markets from the standpoint of 
efficiency by asking whether the economy is getting the most it can out of its scarce 
resources. We learned that perfectly competitive markets achieve efficient outcomes 
(unless there are externalities), while monopoly markets entail deadweight losses.

Ednonial review his deemed that sry suppressed coment does ot maierially affact tee overall learning expenience. Cengage Learning reserves the right o remewe addiional coment o any time if ssbseqeent nghts renmnctions require iChapter 17 Monopolistic Competition 
Monopolistically competitive markets are more complex than either of these polar 
cases, so evaluating welfare in these markets is a more subtle exercise. 
One source of inefficiency in monopolistically competitive markets is the markup 
of price over marginal cost. Because of the markup, some consumers who value 
the good at more than the marginal cost of production (but less than the price) will 
be deterred from buying it. A monopolistically competitive market has the normal 
deadweight loss of monopoly pricing. 
This outcome is undesirable compared with the efficient quantity that arises 
when price equals marginal cost, but policymakers can't casily fix the problem. To 
enforce marginal-cost pricing, they would need to regulate all firms that produce 
differentiated products. Because such products are so common, the administrative 
burden of such regulation would be overwhelming. 
Regulating monopolistic competitors would also entail all the problems of 
regulating natural monopolies. In particular, because monopolistic competitors 
are already making zero profits, requiring them to lower their prices to equal 
marginal cost would cause them to incur losses. To keep these firms in business, 
the government would need to help them cover these losses. Rather than financing 
these subsidies with higher taxes, which would entail their own deadweight losses, 
policymakers may decide it is better to live with the inefficiency of monopolistic 
pricing. 
Another source of inefficiency under monopolistic competition is that the num￾ber of firms in the market may not be ideal. That is, there may be too much or too 
little entry. Think of the externalities associated with entry. Whenever a new firm 
considers entering the market with a new product, it takes into account only the 
profit it would make. Yet its entry would also have two effects that are external 
to the firm: 
* The product-variety externality: Because consumers benefit from the 
introduction of a new product, the entry of a new firm confers a positive 
externality on consumers. 
* The business-stealing externality: Because other firms lose customers and 
profits when faced with a new competitor, the entry of a new firm imposes a 
negative externality on existing firms. 
Thus, in a monopolistically competitive market, the entry of new firms entails both 
positive and negative externalities. Depending on which is larger, a monopolistically 
competitive market could have too few or too many products. 
Both externalities are closely related to the conditions for monopolistic 
competition. The product-variety externality arises because new firms under 
monopolistic competition offer products that differ from those of the existing 
firms. The greater range of choices increases consumer surplus. The business￾stealing externality arises because monopolistically competitive firms post 
a price above marginal cost and, therefore, are eager to sell additional units. 
Conversely, because perfectly competitive firms produce identical goods and 
charge a price equal to marginal cost, neither of these externalities exists under 
perfect competition. 
In the end, we can conclude only that monopolistically competitive markets 
do not have all the desirable welfare properties of perfectly competitive markets. 
That is, the invisible hand does not ensure that total surplus is maximized under 
monopolistic competition. Yet because the inefficiencies are subtle, hard to measure, 
and hard to fix, public policy cannot easily improve the market outcome.

17-3 Advertising 
In the modern world, it is nearly impossible to go through a typical day without 
being bombarded with advertising. Whether you are surfing the Internet, watch￾ing television, or driving down the highway, some firm will try to convince vou to 
buy its product. Such behavior is a natural feature of monopolistic competition (as 
well as some oligopolistic industries). When firms sell differentiated products and 
charge prices above marginal cost, each firm has an incentive to advertise to attract 
more buyers to its particular product. 
The amount of advertising varies substantially across products. Firms that sell 
differentiated consumer goods, such as over-the-counter drugs, perfumes, soft 
drinks, razor blades, breakfast cereals, and dog food, typically spend between 10 
and 20 percent of their revenue on advertising. Firms that sell industrial products, 
such as drill presses and communications satellites, typically spend very little on 
advertising. And those that sell homogeneous products, such as wheat, salt, sugar, 
and crude oil, often spend nothing at all. 
For the overall economy, about 2 percent of total firm revenue is spent on adver￾tising. This spending takes many forms, including ads on websites, social media, 
television, radio, and billboards and in newspapers, magazines, and direct mail. 
17-3a The Debate over Advertising 
Is society wasting the resources it devotes to advertising? Or does advertising serve 
a valuable purpose? Assessing the social value of advertising is difficult and often 
generates heated arguments among economists. Let’s consider both sides of the 
debate. 
The Critique of Advertising Critics argue that firms advertise to manipulate peo￾ple’s tastes. Much advertising is psychological rather than informational. Consider, 
for example, the typical television commercial for some brand of soft drink. The 
commercial most likely does not tell the viewer about the product’s price or quality. 
Instead, it might show a group of happy and beautiful people at a party on a beach 
on a sunny day. In their hands are cans of the soft drink. The goal of the commercial 
is to convey a subconscious (if not subtle) message: “You too can have many friends 
and be happy and beautiful, if you drink our product.” Critics of advertising argue 
that such a commercial creates a desire that otherwise might not exist.

Critics also argue that advertising impedes competition. Advertising often tries 
to convince consumers that products are more different than they truly are. By 
increasing the perception of product differentiation and fostering brand lovalty, 
advertising makes buyers less concerned with price differences among similar goods, 
making the demand for the brand being advertised less elastic. When a firm faces 
a less elastic demand curve, it can increase its profits by charging a larger markup 
over marginal cost. 
The Defense of Advertising Defenders of advertising argue that firms use 
advertising to inform customers. Advertising often conveys the prices of the goods 
offered for sale, the existence of new products, and the ways in which they can be 
purchased. This information allows customers to make better choices about what 
to buy, contributing to the efficient allocation of resources. 
Defenders also argue that advertising fosters competition. Because advertising 
may make customers more aware of the available products, customers can more 
easily take advantage of price differences, thereby reducing the market power of 
each firm. In addition, advertising allows new firms to enter more easily because 
it gives them a way to inform and attract customers. 
Over time, the view that advertising can make markets more competitive has 
gained adherents. One important example is the regulation of advertising for law￾yers, doctors, and pharmacists. In the past, these groups succeeded in getting state 
governments to prohibit advertising in their fields on the grounds that it was “unpro￾fessional.” In recent years, however, the courts have concluded that the primary effect 
of these restrictions was to curtail competition. They have, therefore, overturned 
many of the laws that prohibit advertising in these fields. 
How Advertising Affects Prices 
What effect does advertising have on prices? On the one hand, it 
might make consumers view products as being more different from 
each other than they otherwise would. If so, it would make markets 
less competitive and firms’ demand curves less elastic, allowing firms to charge 
higher prices. On the other hand, advertising might make it easier for consumers 
to find the firms with the best prices. In this case, it would make markets more 
competitive and firms" demand curves more elastic, which would lead to lower 
Prices. 
In an article published in The Journal of Law and Economics in 1972, the econo￾mist Lee Benham tested these two hypotheses. In the United States during the 
1960s, state governments had vastly different rules about advertising by optom￾etrists. Some states allowed advertising for eveglasses and eye examinations, but 
many prohibited it. For example, a Florida law justified the advertising ban as “in 
the interest of public health, safety, and welfare.” Optometrists endorsed these 
restrictions. 
Benham used the differences in state laws as a natural experiment to test the two 
views of advertising. The results were striking. In states that prohibited advertising, 
the average price paid for a pair of eyeglasses was $33, or $288 in 2021 dollars. In 
states that did not restrict advertising, the average price was $26, or $227 in 2021 
dollars. Advertising reduced average prices by more than 20 percent. 
A similar natural experiment occurred in 1996 when the U.S. Supreme Court 
struck down a Rhode Island law that banned advertising the prices of liquor 
products. A study by Jeffrey Milyo and Joel Waldfogel, published in the American

Economic Review in 1999, examined liquor prices in Rhode Island after the legal 
change, compared with liquor prices in the neighboring state of Massachusetts, 
where there was no change. According to this research, stores in Rhode Island that 
started advertising cut their prices substantially, often by more than 20 percent, but 
only on those products that they or their rivals advertised. In addition, after these 
stores began advertising, they attracted a larger share of customers. 
The bottom line: In many markets, advertising fosters competition and leads to 
lower prices for consumers. @ 
17-3b Advertising as a Signal of Quality 
Advertising often contains little apparent information about the product being 
advertised. Consider a firm introducing a new breakfast cereal. It might saturate the 
airwaves with advertisements showing some actor eating the cereal and exclaiming 
how wonderful it tastes. How much information does that provide? 
According to one theory, the answer is more than you might think. Even advertis￾ing that appears to contain little hard information may tell consumers something 
about product quality. The willingness of the firm to spend a large amount of money 
on advertising can itself be a signal to consumers about the quality of the product 
being offered. 
To see how this works, let’s examine the problem facing two firms—General Mills 
and Kellogg. Each company has just come up with a recipe for a new cereal, which 
it would sell for $5 a box. To keep things simple, assume that the marginal cost of 
making cereal is zero, so the $5 is all profit. Each company knows that if it spends 
$20 million on advertising, it will get 1 million consumers to try its cereal. And each 
knows that if consumers like the cereal, they will buy it many times. 
First, consider General Mills® decision. Based on market research, General Mills 
knows that its cereal tastes like shredded newspaper with sugar on top. Advertising 
would sell one box to each of the 1 million consumers, but they would quickly 
learn that the cereal is not very good and stop buying it. General Mills decides it is 
not worth spending $20 million on advertising to get only $5 million in sales. So it 
does not bother to advertise. It sends its cooks back to the kitchen to come up with 
a better recipe. 
Kellogg, on the other hand, knows that its cereal is great. Each person who tries 
it will buy a box a month for the next year, so the $20 million in advertising will 
bring in $60 million in sales. In this case, advertising is profitable because Kellogg 
has a good product that consumers will buy repeatedly. Thus, Kellogg chooses to 
advertise. 
Now consider the behavior of consumers. We began by asserting that consum￾ers are inclined to try a new cereal that they see advertised. But is this behavior 
rational? Should a consumer try a new cereal just because the seller has chosen 
to advertise it? 
In fact, it may be completely rational for consumers to try new products that they 
see advertised. In this story, consumers decide to try Kellogg's new cereal because 
Kellogg advertises. Kellogg chooses to advertise because it knows that its cereal is 
quite good, while General Mills chooses not to advertise because it knows that its 
cereal is not good at all. By its willingness to spend on advertising, Kellogg signals 
to consumers the quality of its cereal. Each consumer thinks, quite sensibly, “If the 
Kellogg Company is willing to spend so much money advertising this new cereal, 
it must be really good.” 
What is striking about this theory of advertising is that the content of the adver￾tisement is irrelevant. Kellogg signals the quality of its product by its willingness

to spend money on advertising. What the advertisements say is not as important 
as the fact that consumers know the ads are expensive. By contrast, cheap adver￾tising cannot be effective at signaling quality to consumers. In this example, if an ; 
advertising campaign cost less than $5 million, both General Mills and Kellogg i ! ; 
would use it to market their new cereals. Because both good and bad cereals would s - 
now be advertised, consumers could not infer the quality of a new cereal from the 
fact that it is advertised. Over time, consumers would learn to ignore such cheap 
advertising,. 
This theory can explain why firms pay famous actors large sums of money 
to make advertisements that, on the surface, appear to convey no information 
at all. The information is not in the ad’s content but simply in its existence and 
expense.

= ] = 17-3¢ Brand Names 
Many markets have two types of firms: those that sell products with widely rec￾ognized brand names and those that sell generic substitutes. For example, Bayer 
aspirin competes with generic aspirin. Coke and Pepsi compete with less familiar 
colas. Firms with brand names usually spend more on advertising and charge more 
for their products. Just as there is debate about the economics of advertising, there 
Is it rational for 
consumers to be 
impressed that 
is debate about the economics of brand names. Gegrge CIE‘?“EY 
Critics argue that brand names cause consumers to perceive differences that " ;’rfiéi . product? do not really exist. In many cases, the generic is almost indistinguishable from the 
brand-name good. Consumers’ willingness to pay more for the brand-name good, 
these critics assert, is a form of irrationality fostered by advertising. The economist 
Edward Chamberlin, one of the early dew_lflpera of the theory of monopolistic 
competition, concluded from this argument that brand names were bad for the 
economy. He proposed that the government discourage their use by refusing to 
enforce the trademarks that companies use to identify their products. 
More recently, economists have defended brand names as a way for consumers 
to ensure that the goods they buy are of high quality. There are two related argu￾ments. First, brand names provide consumers with information about quality when 
quality cannot be easily judged in advance of purchase. Second, brand names give 
firms an incentive to maintain high quality because firms have a financial stake in 
maintaining their brands’ reputations. 
To see how these arguments work in practice, consider a famous brand name: 
McDonald’s. Imagine that you are driving through an unfamiliar town and want 
to stop for lunch. You see a McDonald’s and a local restaurant next to it. Which 
do you choose? The local restaurant may offer better food at lower prices, but you 
don’t really know. By contrast, McDonald’s offers a consistent product across many 
cities and countries. Its brand name is useful to you as a way of judging the quality 
of what you are about to buy. 
The McDonald's brand name also ensures that the company has an incentive 
to maintain quality. For example, if some customers were to become ill from 
spoiled food sold at a McDonald'’s, the news would be disastrous for the com￾pany. McDonald’s would lose much of the valuable reputation that it has built 
up with years of expensive advertising. As a result, it would lose sales and profit 
not only in the outlet that sold the bad food but also in many other McDonald's 
outlets throughout the country. By contrast, if some customers were to become 
ill from bad food at a local restaurant, that restaurant might have to close, but 
the lost profits would be much smaller. McDonald’s has a greater incentive to 
ensure that its food is safe.

The debate over brand names thus centers on the question of whether consumers 
are rational in preferring brand-name products. Critics argue that brand names are 
the result of an irrational consumer response to advertising. Defenders argue that 
consumers have good reason to pay more for brand-name products because they 
can be more confident in these products’ quality.

17-4 Conclusion 
Answers are at the end of the chapter. 
Monopolistic competition is true to its name: It is a hybrid of monopoly and 
competition. Like a monopoly, each monopolistic competitor faces a downward￾sloping demand curve and charges a price above marginal cost. As in a perfectly 
competitive market, there are many firms, and entry and exit drive the profit of 
each monopolistic competitor toward zero in the long run. Table 1 summarizes 
these lessons. 
Because monopolistically competitive firms produce differentiated products, 
each advertises to attract customers to its own brand. To some extent, advertising 
manipulates consumers’ tastes, promotes irrational brand loyalty, and impedes

The theory of monopolistic competition describes many markets in the economy. 
It is somewhat disappointing, therefore, that the theory does not yield simple and 
compelling advice for public policy. From the standpoint of economic theorists, 
the allocation of resources in monopolistically competitive markets is not perfect. 
Yet from the standpoint of practical policymakers, there may be little that can be 
done to improve it.

products, and free entry and exit. 
The long-run equilibrium in a monopolistically competi￾tive market differs from that in a perfectly competitive 
market in two ways. First, in a monopolistically com￾petitive market, each firm has excess capacity. That is, it 
chooses a quantity that puts it on the downward-sloping 
firm charges a price above marginal cost. 
Monopelistic competition does not have all the desir￾able properties of perfect competition. There is the 
standard deadweight loss of monopoly caused by 
the markup of price over marginal cost. In addition, 
the number of firms (and thus the number of product 
varieties) can be too large or too small. In practice, the

f you play tennis, you have probably used balls from one of a 
handful of brands: Penn, Wilson, Dunlop, Prince, or Babolat. 
These few companies supply most of the tennis balls sold in 
the United States. Together, they determine the quantity of tennis 
balls produced and, given the market demand curve, the price at 
which tennis balls are sold. 
The market for tennis balls is an example of an oligopoly. The 
essence of an oligopolistic market is that there are only a few sellers, 
so the actions of any one of them can have a large impact on the 
profits of all the others. This chapter examines how this interde￾pendence shapes the firms’ behavior and what problems it raises 
for public policy. 
The analysis of oligopoly leads us to game theory, the study of 
how people behave in strategic situations. By “strategic,” we mean 
a situation in which people, when choosing a course of action, 
must anticipate how others might respond to their choice. Strategic 
thinking is crucial not only in chess, checkers, and tic-tac-toe but 
also in many business decisions. Because oligopolistic markets 
have only a few firms, each firm must be strategic when makmg 
supply decisions. The firms are keenly aware that each firm’s profit 'Y HUTTERS TOCK.CLL [0 
ol Mo the @Bk andior eChepien(s) 
subgequen i ghts resmctions require iL 360 PartV Firm Behavior and the Organization of Industry 
depends not only on how much it produces but also on how much each of the others 
produce. When setting production, a firm in an oligopoly needs to consider how 
its choices might affect the choices of other firms in the market. 
Game theory isn’t necessary for analyzing competitive or monopoly markets. 
In a market that is either perfectly or monopolistically competitive, each firm 
is so small compared with the overall market that strategic interactions are 
insignificant. And for a monopoly, there are no other firms to worry about. But 
game theory is important for understanding oligopolies and may be applied 
whenever a small number of players interact with one another. It helps explain 
the strategies that people choose, whether they are playing tennis or selling 
tennis balls. 
18-1 Markets with Only a Few Sellers 
An oligopolistic market has only a small group of sellers and is characterized by 
the tension between cooperation and self-interest. Oligopolists can make the most 
profit if they cooperate and together act like one big monopolist—producing a small 
quantity of output and charging a price well above marginal cost. Yet because each 
oligopolist cares only about its own profit, powerful incentives pull them apart, 
making it hard to maintain the cooperative outcome. 
18-1a A Duopoly Example 
Consider the simplest type of oligopoly, one with only two members, called a duo￾poly. Oligopolies with three or more members face the same problems as duopolies, 
so little is lost by starting with the simpler case. 
Imagine a town in which only two residents, Jack and Jill, own wells that produce 
water safe for drinking. Each Saturday, Jack and Jill decide how many gallons of water 
to pump, bring the water to town, and sell it for whatever price the market will bear. 
To keep things simple, suppose that they can pump as much as they want without 
cost. That is, the marginal cost of water is zero. 
Table 1 shows the town's demand schedule for water. The first column shows 
the total quantity demanded, and the second shows the price. If the well owners 
sell a total of 10 gallons of water, water goes for $110 a gallon. If they sell a total 
of 20 gallons, the price falls to $100 a gallon. And so on. If you graphed these two 
columns of numbers, you would get a standard downward-sloping demand curve. 
The last column in Table 1 shows total revenue from the sale of water. It equals 
the quantity sold times the price. Because there is no cost to pumping water, the 
total revenue of the two producers equals their total profit. 
Now consider how the organization of the town’s water industry affects the price 
of water and the quantity sold. 
18-1b Competition, Monopolies, and Cartels 
Before examining the price and quantity of water that results from the Jack and 
Jill duopoly, let’s consider the outcomes that would result if the water market 
were either perfectly competitive or monopolistic. These polar cases are natural 
benchmarks. 
If the market for water were perfectly competitive, the production decisions of 
each firm would drive price to equal marginal cost. Because here the marginal cost

of pumping additional water is zero, the equilibrium price of water under perfect 
competition would be zero as well. The equilibrium quantity would then be 120 
gallons. The price of water would reflect the cost of producing it, and the efficient 
quantity of water would be produced and consumed. 
Now consider how a monopoly would behave. Table 1 shows that total profit is 
maximized at a quantity of 60 gallons and a price of $60 a gallon. A profit-maximizing 
monopolist, therefore, would produce this quantity and charge this price. As is 
standard for monopolies, price would exceed marginal cost. The result would be 
inefficient because the quantity of water produced and consumed would fall short 
of the socially efficient level of 120 gallons. 
What outcome would the duopolists achieve? One possibility is that Jack and Jill 
get together and agree on the quantity of water to produce and the price to charge 
for it. Such an agreement among firms over production and price is called collusion, collusion 
and the group of firms acting in unison is called a cartel. Once a cartel is formed, an agreement among 
the market is in effect served by a monopoly, and the analysis from Chapter 16 firms in a market about 
applies. That is, if Jack and Jill collude, they will agree on the monopoly outcome quantities to produce or 
because it maximizes their total profit. Together, they produce a total of 60 gallons, prices to charge 
which sell at a price of 560 a gallon. Price exceeds marginal cost, and the outcome \ . . 1 cartel 
is socially inefficient. a group of firms acting in A cartel must agree not only on total production but also on the amount produced ur{Eirsnn g 
by each member. Each wants a larger share of the market because that means more 
individual profit. In this case, Jack and Jill must agree on how to split the production 
of 60 gallons. If they agree to split the market equally, each produces 30 gallons, the 
price is $60 a gallon, and each earns a profit of $1,800.

18-1¢ The Equilibrium for an Oligopoly 
Oligopolists would like to form cartels and earn monopoly profits, but that is 
often impossible. Squabbling among cartel members over how to divide the 
profit can make agreement among members difficult. In addition, antitrust laws 
prohibit explicit agreements among oligopolists. Even talking about pricing 
and production restrictions with competitors can be a criminal offense. Let’s 
consider, therefore, what happens if Jack and Jill decide separately how much 
water to produce. 
One might expect Jack and [ill to reach the monopoly outcome on their own 
because this outcome maximizes their joint profit. In the absence of a binding agree￾ment, however, the monopoly outcome is unlikely. To see why, imagine that Jack 
expects Jill to produce only 30 gallons (half the monopoly quantity). Jack would 
reason as follows: 
“Lcould produce 30 gallons as well. Together, we'd sell 60 gallons of water at $60 a 
gallon. My profit would be $1,800 (30 gallons X $60 a gallon). But why settle for that? 
| could produce 40 gallons. Then together, we'd sell 70 gallons of water at $50 a gal￾lon. My profit would be $2,000 (40 gallons % $50 a gallon). Total profit in the market 
would fall, but who cares? My profit would rise because I'd have more of the market.” 
That's logical, as far as it goes. But there’s a catch: Jill might well think the same 
way. Then she would bring 40 gallons to the market, too. Total sales would be 
80 gallons, the price would fall to $40, and total profits would be $3,200. Jack and Jill 
would each earn only $1,600. By pursuing their individual self-interest when decid￾ing how much to produce, the duopolists produce a total quantity greater than the 
monopoly quantity, charge a price lower than the monopoly price, and earn total 
profit less than the monopoly profit. 
The logic of self-interest increases the duopoly’s output above the monopoly 
level, but it does not push the duopolists all the way to the competitive allocation. 
Consider what happens when Jack and Jill each produce 40 gallons. The price is 
$40, and they each make a profit of $1,600. Jack ponders the situation further, but 
his self-interested logic leads to a different conclusion: 
“Right now, my profit is 51,600. Suppose [ increase production to 50 gallons. In 
this case, a total of 90 gallons would be sold, and the price would be $30 a gallon. 
Then, my profit would be only $1,500. Hmmm. Rather than increasing production 
and driving down the price, I am better off keeping my production at 40 gallons.” 
Jill, on her own, reaches the same conclusion. 
The outcome in which Jack and Jill each produce 40 gallons looks like some sort 
of equilibrium. In fact, this outcome is called a Nash equilibrium. (It is named after 
the Nobel Prize-winning mathematician and economic theorist John Nash, whose 
life was portrayed in the book and movie A Beautiful Mind.) A Nash equilibrium 
is a situation in which economic actors interacting with one another each choose 
their best strategy given the strategies that the others have chosen. In this case, 
once [Jill is producing 40 gallons, the best strategy for Jack is also to produce 40 gal￾lons. Similarly, once Jack is producing 40 gallons, the best strategy for Jill is also to 
produce 40 gallons. At this Nash equilibrium, neither Jack nor Jill has an incentive 
to make a different decision. 
This example shows the tension between cooperation and self-interest that is 
the essence of oligopolies. Oligopolists would be better off cooperating to attain 
the monopoly outcome. Yet because they each pursue their own self-interest, they 
fail to do so. Each oligopolist is tempted to raise production and capture a larger 
share of the market. As each tries to do this, total production rises, the price falls, 
and total profit falls.

Like monopolists, oligopolists know that producing more reduces the price they 
will receive, which in turn affects profits. So they stop short of following the com￾petitive firm’s rule of producing up to the point where price equals marginal cost. 
In summary, when firms in an oligopoly individually choose production to 
maximize profit, they produce a quantity greater than the level produced by 
a monopoly and less than the level produced under perfect competition. The 
oligopoly price is less than the monopoly price but greater than the competitive 
price (which equals marginal cost). 
18-1d How the Size of an Oligopoly Affects 
the Market Outcome 
We can use the insights from studying duopoly to discuss how the size of an oli￾gopoly affects the market outcome. Suppose, for instance, that Jude and Jade sud￾denly discover water sources on their properties and join Jack and Jill in the water 
oligopoly. The demand schedule in Table 1 remains the same, but more producers 
are available to satisfy this demand. How does an increase from two to four sellers 
affect the price and quantity of water in the town? 
If the sellers formed a cartel, they would again try to maximize total profit by 
producing the monopoly quantity and charging the monopoly price. Just as with 
only two sellers, the cartel members would need to agree on individual production 
levels and find a way to enforce the agreement. As the cartel grows larger, however, 
this outcome is less likely. If you have ever been a member of a team or a club, you 
might have noticed that working harmoniously becomes more difficult as the size 
of the group increases. In addition, evading the antitrust laws may be harder with 
a larger group of conspirators. 
If the oligopolists do not form a cartel, they must each decide on their own how 
much water to produce. To see how the increase in the number of sellers affects 
the outcome, consider the decision facing each seller. At any time, each well owner 
has the option to raise production by one gallon. In making this decision, the well 
owner weighs two effects: 
* The output effect: Because price exceeds marginal cost, selling one more 
gallon of water at the going price increases profit. 
* The price eftect: Because raising production increases the total quantity sold, 
the price of water declines, as does the profit on all the other gallons sold. 
If the output effect outweighs the price effect, the well owner increases production. 
If the price effect outweighs the output effect, the owner does not raise produc￾tion. (In this case, it is profitable to reduce production.) Each oligopolist increases 
production until these two marginal effects exactly balance, taking the other firms’ 
production as given. 
Now consider how the number of firms in the industry affects the marginal 
analysis of each oligopolist. The more firms there are, the smaller each firm’s market 
share is. As a firm’s market share shrinks, the less the firm is concerned about its 
own impact on the market price. That is, as the oligopoly grows, the magnitude of 
the price effect falls. 
When the oligopoly grows very large, the price effect disappears altogether. In 
this extreme case, the production decision of an individual firm no longer affects the 
market price. Each firm takes the market price as given when deciding how much 
to produce and, therefore, increases production as long as price exceeds marginal

cost. In other words, a large oligopoly is essentially a group 
of competitive firms. 
In summary, as the number of sellers in an oligopoly 
grows, an oligopolistic market increasingly resembles a 
competitive market. The price approaches marginal cost, 
and the quantity produced approaches the socially efficient 
level. 
This analysis of oligopoly offers a new perspective on 
international trade. Imagine that Toyota and Honda are 
the only automakers in Japan, Volkswagen and BMW are 
the only ones in Germany, and Ford and General Motors 
are the only ones in the United States. If these countries 
prohibited international trade in autos, each would have an 
oligopoly with only two members, and the market price and 
quantity would likely depart substantially from the competi￾tive ideal. With international trade, however, a world market 
arises, and the oligopoly in this example has six members. 
Allowing free trade increases the number of producers from 
which each consumer can choose, and the greater competi￾tion keeps prices closer to marginal cost. Thus, the theory 
of oligopoly provides another reason, in addition to the theory of comparative 
advantage discussed in Chapter 3, why countries can benefit from free trade.

18-2 The Economics of Cooperation 
Oligopolists would like to reach the monopoly outcome but may find it hard to 
cooperate. This situation is not unusual: Often in life, people fail to cooperate with 
one another even when cooperation would make them all better off. An oligopoly 
is just one exa:np]e.

Cengage Learning reserves the right o remewe addiional coment o any time if ssbseqeent nghts renmnctions require iThis section looks more closely at the problems that arise when cooperation is 
desirable but difficult. This requires an understanding of game theory. We focus on 
a “game” called the prisoners’ dilemma, which teaches a general lesson that applies 
to any group trying to maintain cooperation among its members. 
18-2a The Prisoners’ Dilemma 
The prisoners’ dilemma is a story about two criminals who have been captured by 
the police. Call them Bonnie and Clyde. The police have enough evidence to convict 
them of the minor crime of carrying an unregistered gun, so each would spend a 
vear in jail. The police also suspect that these criminals committed a bank robbery 
but lack evidence to convict them for it. The police question Bonnie and Clyde in 
separate rooms and offer each of them the following deal: 
“Right now, we can lock you up for 1 year. But if you confess to the bank robbery 
and implicate your partner, we'll give you immunity, and you can go free. Your 
partner will get 20 years in jail. If you both confess, we won’t need your testimony, 
and we can avoid the cost of a trial, so you'll each get a sentence of 8 years.” 
If Bonnie and Clyde, heartless bank robbers that they are, care only about their 
own individual sentences, what would you expect them to do? Figure 1 shows the 
payoff matrix for their choices. Each prisoner has two strategies: confess or remain 
silent. The sentence each prisoner gets depends on the strategy he or she chooses 
and the strategy chosen by his or her partner in crime. 
Consider first Bonnie's decision. She reasons as follows: “We had a fabulous 
time robbing banks together, but now I don’t know what Clyde is going to do. If 
he remains silent, my best strategy is to confess because then I'll go free rather 
than spending a year in jail. If he confesses, [ should still confess because then I'll 
spend just 8 years in jail rather than 20. So, whatever Clyde does, I'm better off 
confessing.” 
In the language of game theory, a strategy is called a dominant strategy if it 
is the best one for a player to follow regardless of the strategies pursued by other 
players. In this case, confessing is a dominant strategy for Bonnie. She spends less 
time in jail if she confesses, regardless of whether Clyde confesses or remains silent.

Now consider Clyde’s decision. He faces the same choices as Bonnie, and he 
reasons the same way. Regardless of what Bonnie does, Clyde can reduce his jail 
time by confessing. In other words, confessing is also a dominant strategy for 
Clyde. 
3]:1 the end, both Bonnie and Clyde confess, and they each spend 8 years in jail. 
This outcome is a Nash equilibrium: Each chooses the best strategy available given 
the strategy the other is following. Yet, from their standpoint, the outcome is terrible. 
If they had both remained silent, both would have been better off, spending only 
1 year in jail on the gun charge. Because they pursue their own interests, the two 
prisoners together reach an outcome that is worse for each of them. 
You might have thought that Bonnie and Clyde would have planned for this 
situation. But even if they had, they would still run into problems. Imagine that, 
before the police captured them, the two criminals had sworn undying love 
and agreed never to confess. Clearly, this pact would make them both better off 
if they both lived up to it because each would spend only 1 year in jail. They 
could then ride off into a glorious sunset. But would Bonnie and Clyde remain 
silent simply because they had agreed they would? Once they are being ques￾tioned separately, the logic of self-interest takes over and leads them to confess. 
Cooperation between the prisoners is difficult to maintain because cooperation 
is individually irrational. So is love, but it’s easier to maintain when you're not 
facing a prison sentence. 
18-2b Oligopolies as a Prisoners’ Dilemma 
What does the prisoners’ dilemma have to do with markets and imperfect competi￾tion? It turns out that the decisions oligopolists face in trying to reach the monopoly 
outcome are similar to those that Bonnie and Clyde faced in the prisoners’ dilemma. 
Consider again the choices facing Jack and Jill. After prolonged negotiation, the 
two water suppliers agree to keep production at 30 gallons. That way, the price 
will be high, and together, they will earn the maximum profit. After they agree on 
production levels, however, each of them must decide whether to honor this agree￾ment or to ignore it and produce at a higher level. Figure 2 shows how the profits 
of the two producers depend on the strategies they choose. 
Figure 2

Jill, the profit that each earns from 
selling water depends on both the

Ednonal review has desmed that any suppressed coment does mot maierially affect the overall kzaming expenience. Cengage Learming reserves the right o remove addiional coment o any tme if subsequent nghes restnctions require icJack might reason as follows: “I could keep production at 30 gallons as we agreed, 
or I could raise my production and sell 40 gallons. If Jill lives up to the agreement 
and keeps her production at 30 gallons, then my profit is $2,000 if | sell 40 gallons 
and $1,800 if I sell 30 gallons. In this case, | am better off with the higher production 
level. If Jill fails to live up to the agreement and produces 40 gallons, then I carn 
$1,600 by selling 40 gallons and $1,500 by selling 30 gallons. Again, I am better off 
with higher production. So, whatever Jill chooses to do, | am better off reneging on 
our agreement and producing at the higher level.” 
Producing 40 gallons is a dominant strategy for Jack. Of course, Jill reasons in 
the same way, and so both produce at the higher level of 40 gallons. The result 
is the inferior outcome (from Jack and Jill's standpoint) with low profits for each 
of the two producers. 
This example shows why oligopolies have trouble maintaining monopoly profits. 
The monopoly outcome is jointly rational, but each oligopolist has an incentive to 
cheat. Just as self-interest drives the suspects in the prisoners’ dilemma to confess, 
self-interest makes it hard for the oligopolists to maintain the cooperative outcome 
with low production, high prices, and monopoly profits. 
OPEC and the World Oil Market 
The story about the town’s market for water is fictional, but if we 
change water to crude oil and Jack and Jill to Saudi Arabia and Iraq, 
the story is close to reality. Much of the world’s oil is produced by 
a few countries, mostly in the Middle East. These countries together make up an 
oligopoly. Their decisions about how much oil to pump are much the same as Jack 
and Jill's decisions about how much water to pump. 
In 1960, the countries that produce much of the world’s vil formed a cartel called 
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). It includes Saudi 
Arabia, Iraq, Iran, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Venezuela, and several other 
nations. In 2016, ten other oil-producing nations, led by Russia, joined forces with 
OPEC, and the cartel is now known as OPEC Plus. Together, OPEC Plus countries 
control most of the world's oil reserves. The cartel tries to raise the price of its prod￾uct through a coordinated reduction in quantity produced. To do so, it sets produc￾tion targets for each of the member countries. 
The problem that OPEC Plus faces is much the same as the problem that Jack and 
Jill face in our story. The countries in the cartel would like to maintain a high price 
for oil. But each member is tempted to increase its production to get a larger share 
of the total profit. OPEC Plus members frequently agree to reduce production but 
then cheat on their agreements. 
OPEC was quite successful at maintaining cooperation and high prices in the 
period from 1973 to 1985. The price of crude oil rose from $3 a barrel in 1972 to $11 in 
1974 and then to $35 in 1981. But in the mid-1980s, member countries began arguing 
about production levels, and OPEC became ineffective at maintaining cooperation. 
By 1986, the price of crude oil had fallen back to $13 a barrel. 
In recent years, the members of OPEC have continued to meet regularly and to 
confer with allies in the larger oil bloc, but they have been less successful at reach￾ing and enforcing agreements. Changes in technology, such as the development 
of fracking, have expanded oil supply around the world and reduced OPEC’s 
market power. As a result, fluctuations in oil prices have been driven more by 
the natural forces of supply and demand than by the cartel’s artificial restrictions 
on production. @

Figure 3 
18-2¢ Other Examples of the Prisoners’ Dilemma 
The logic of the prisoners’ dilemma applies not only to oligopolies but also to many 
other situations. Here are two examples in which self-interest impedes cooperation, 
leading to inferior outcomes for the parties involved. 
Arms Races In the decades after World War 11, the world’s two superpowers—the 
United States and the Soviet Union—were engaged in a prolonged competition over 
military power. This struggle motivated some of the early work on game theory. 
Theorists pointed out that an arms race is much like the prisoners’ dilemma. Today, 
it applies to relations among the United States, Russia, and another great military 
power, China. 
Consider the decisions of the United States and the Soviet Union about whether 
to build new weapons or to disarm. Each country wants to have more arms than 
the other because larger arsenals give it more influence in world affairs. But each 
country also worries about the other’s weapons. 
Figure 3 shows the payoff matrix for this deadly game. If the Soviet Union 
arms, the United States is better off doing the same to prevent the loss of power. If 
the Soviet Union disarms, the United States is better off arming because doing so 
would make it more powerful. For each country, arming is a dominant strategy. So 
each country chooses to continue the arms race, resulting in the inferior outcome 
with both countries at risk. 
From about 1945 to 1991, the United States and the Soviet Union attempted to 
solve this problem through arms control negotiations and agreements. The difficul￾ties the two countries faced were like those encountered by oligopolists in trying 
to maintain a cartel. Much as oligopolists argue over production levels, the United 
States and the Soviet Union argued over the amount and type of arms that each 
country would be allowed. And just as cartels have trouble enforcing production 
levels, the United States and the Soviet Union feared that the other country would 
find ways to cheat. In both arms races and oligopolies, the logic of self-interest can 
drive the participants toward the noncooperative outcome, which is worse for both 
parties. Yet with transparency and stringent methods for verifying that agreements 
are being honored, it is possible to break out of the boxes of the prisoners’ dilemma. It 
helps, however, to understand the pressures that hamper cooperation on both sides. 
An Arms-Race Game 
In this game between two 
countries, the safety and power of 
each depends on what its adversary 
does, as well as on its own decision Arm 
whether to arm.

Ednonal review has desmed that any suppressed coment does mot maierially affect the overall kzaming expenience. Cengage Learming reserves the right o remove addiional coment o any tme if subsequent nghes restnctions require icCommon Resources Chapter 11 noted that people tend to overuse common 
resources. One can view this problem as an example of the prisoners’ dilemma. 
Imagine that two oil companies—ExxonMobil and Chevron—own adjacent oil 
tields. Under the fields is a common pool of oil worth $120 million. Drilling a well 
to recover the oil costs $10 million. If each company drills one well, each will get 
half of the oil and earn a $50 million profit (560 million in revenue minus $10 million 
in costs). 
Because the pool of 0il is a common resource, the companies will not use it effi￾ciently. Suppose that either company could drill a second well. If one company has 
two of the three wells, that company gets two-thirds of the oil, which yields a profit 
of $60 million. The other company gets one-third of the oil for a profit of $30 million. 
Yet if each company drills a second well, the two companies again split the oil. In 
this case, each bears the cost of a second well and earns a profit of only $40 million. 
Figure 4 shows the game. Drilling two wells is a dominant strategy for each 
company. Once again, the self-interest of the two players leads them to an inferior 
outcome. 
18-2d The Prisoners’ Dilemma and the Welfare of Society 
The prisoners’ dilemma shows that cooperation can be difficult to maintain, even 
when it would make both players in the game better off. This lack of cooperation 
is a problem for those directly involved. But is it a problem from the standpoint of 
society as a whole? The answer depends on the circumstances. 
In some cases, the noncooperative equilibrium is bad for society as well as the 
players. In the arms race depicted in Figure 3, both the United States and the Soviet 
Union end up at risk (and so does everyone else on the planet). In the common￾resources game in Figure 4, the extra wells dug by Chevron and ExxonMobil are 
pure waste. In these cases, society would be better off if the two players could reach 
the cooperative outcome. 
By contrast, in the case of oligopolists trying to maintain monopoly profits, a 
lack of cooperation is desirable from the standpoint of society. The monopoly out￾come is good for the oligopolists but bad for consumers. As Chapter 7 showed, the 
competitive outcome is best for society because it maximizes total surplus. When 
oligopolists fail to cooperate, the quantity they produce is closer to this optimal level.

Iut differently, the invisible hand guides markets to allocate resources efficiently 
only when markets are competitive, and markets are competitive only when firms 
in the market fail to cooperate with one another. 
Similarly, consider the case of the police questioning two suspects. Lack of coop￾eration between the suspects is desirable for society because it allows the police to 
convict more criminals. The prisoners’ dilemma is a dilemma for the prisoners, but 
it can be a boon to everyone else. 
18-2¢e Why People Sometimes Cooperate 
The prisoners’ dilemma shows that cooperation is difficult. But is it impossible? 
Not all prisoners, when questioned by the police, turn in their partners. Cartels 
sometimes manage to maintain collusive arrangements, despite the incentive for 
members to defect. Very often, players can solve the prisoners’ dilemma because 
they play the game not once but many times. 
To see why cooperation is easier to enforce in repeated games, let’s return to our 
duopolists, Jack and Jill, whose choices were given in Figure 2. They would like to 
achieve the monopoly outcome in which each produces 30 gallons. Yet if Jack and 
Jill are to play this game only once, neither has any incentive to live up to an agree￾ment to do so. Self-interest drives each of them to renege and choose the dominant 
strategy of 40 gallons. 
Now suppose that Jack and Jill know that they will play the same game every 
week. When making their initial agreement to keep production low, they can specify 
what happens if one party reneges. They might agree, for instance, that once one of 
them produces 40 gallons, both will produce 40 gallons forever after. This penalty is 
easy to enforce because if one party produces at the high level, the other has every 
reason to do the same. 
The threat of this penalty may be all that is needed to maintain cooperation. Each 
person knows that defecting would raise his or her profit from $1,800 to $2,000. But 
this benefit would last for only one week. Thereafter, profit would fall to $1,600 and 
stay there. As long as the players care enough about future profits, they will forgo 
the one-time gain from defection. In a game of repeated prisoners’ dilemma, like an 
ongoing arms race, the two players may well be able to reach the cooperative outcome. 
The Prisoners’ Dilemma Tournament 
Imagine that you are playing the prisoners’ dilemma with a person 
being questioned in a separate room and that you are to play with 
this other person many times. Your score at the end of the game is 
the total number of years you will spend in jail, a total you'd like to make as small 
as possible. What strategy would you play? Would you begin by confessing or 
remaining silent? How would the other player’s actions in one round affect your 
choices in subsequent rounds? 
This has now become a complicated game. To encourage cooperation, each play￾er will want to impose some penalty when the player in the other room does not 
cooperate. Yet the strategy described earlier for Jack and Jill's water cartel—defect 
forever as soon as the other player defects—is not in the least forgiving, If the game 
is going to be repeated many times, a strategy that allows players to return to the 
cooperative outcome after a period of noncooperation may be preferable. 
To see what strategies work best, the political scientist Robert Axelrod held a con￾test. People entered by submitting computer programs designed to play a game of 
repeated prisoners’ dilemma. Each program was then paired with each of the others 
as in a round-robin tournament. The goal was to receive the fewest total years in jail.

According to tit-for-tat, a player should start by cooperating and then do whatever 
the other plaver did last time. A tit-for-tat player cooperates until the other player 
defects and then defects until the other player cooperates again. This strategy starts 
out friendly, penalizes unfriendly players, and forgives them if warranted. To 
Axelrod’s surprise, this simple strategy did better than the more complex strategics 
that people had sent in. 
The tit-for-tat strategy has a long history. It is essentially “an eye for an eye, a

18-3 Public Policy toward Oligopolies 
One of the Ten Principles of Economics in Chapter 1 is that governments can some￾times improve market outcomes. This principle applies to oligopolistic markets, 
where cooperation leads to production that is too low and prices that are too high 
from the standpoint of society as a whole. The allocation of resources will be closer 
to the social optimum if firms in an oligopoly compete rather than cooperate. Let’s 
consider how policymakers can foster competition. 
18-3a Restraint of Trade and the Antitrust Laws 
The common law can inhibit cooperation among oligopolists. Normally, freedom 
of contract is an essential part of a market economy. Businesses and households 
use contracts to arrange mutually advantageous trades, and they rely on the court 
system to enforce contracts. Yet, for many centuries, judges in England and the 
United States have deemed agreements among competitors to reduce quantities 
and raise prices to be contrary to the public good. They have, therefore, refused to 
enforce such agreements. 
The Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 codified and reinforced this policy in the 
United States: 
Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in 
restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, 
is declared to be illegal . . . Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to 
monopolize, or combine or conspire with any person or persons to monopolize

any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign 
nations, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and on conviction thereof, shall 
be punished by fine not exceeding fifty thousand dollars, or by imprisonment not 
exceeding one year, or by both said punishments, in the discretion of the court. 
The Sherman Act elevated agreements among oligopolists from unenforceable 
contracts to criminal conspiracies. 
The Clayton Act of 1914 further strengthened the antitrust laws. According to this 
statute, plaintiffs who could prove that they were damaged by an illegal arrange￾ment to restrain trade could sue and recover three times the damages sustained. 
The purpose of this unusual rule of triple damages is to encourage private lawsuits 
against conspiring oligopolists. 
Today, the U.S. Justice Department and private parties have the authority to 
bring legal suits to enforce the antitrust laws. As Chapter 16 discussed, these laws 
are used to prevent mergers that would give a firm excessive market power. These 
laws are also used to prevent oligopolists from acting together in ways that would 
make their markets less competitive. 
An lllegal Phone Call 
Firms in oligopolies have a strong incentive to collude to reduce 
production, raise prices, and increase profits. The great 18th-century 
economist Adam Smith was well aware of this potential market 
failure. In The Wealth of Nations, he wrote, “People of the same trade seldom meet 
together, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public, or in some 
diversion to raise prices.” 
For a modern example of Smith’s observation, consider this phone conversa￾tion between two airline executives in the early 1980s. The call was reported in the 
New York Times on February 24, 1983. Robert Crandall was president of American 
Airlines, and Howard Putnam was president of Braniff Airways, a major airline at 
the time. Here's an excerpt: 
Crandall: 1 think it's dumb as hell . . . to sit here and pound the @#$" out 
of each other and neither one of us making a #5%& dime. 
Putnam: Do you have a suggestion for me? 
Crandall: Yes, | have a suggestion for you. Raise your $%*& fares 
20 percent. I'll raise mine the next morning,. 
Putnam: Robert, we... 
Crandall: You'll make more money, and I will, too. 
Putnam: We can't talk about pricing! 
Crandall: Oh @#5%, Howard. We can talk about any &*#@ thing we want 
to talk about. 
Putnam was right: The Sherman Antitrust Act prohibits competing executives from 
even talking about fixing prices. When Putnam gave a recording of this conversa￾tion to the Justice Department, the Justice Department filed suit against Crandall. 
Two years later, Crandall and the Justice Department reached a settlement in 
which Crandall agreed to restrictions on his business activities, including his contacts 
with officials at other airlines. The Justice Department said that the terms of the settle￾ment would “protect competition in the airline industry, by preventing American and 
Crandall from any further attempts to monopolize passenger airline service on any 
route through discussions with competitors about the prices of airline services.” @

What kinds of behavior the antitrust laws should prohibit is often controversial. 
Most commentators agree that price-fixing agreements among competing firms 
should be illegal. Yet the antitrust laws have been used to condemn some business 
practices whose effects are less obvious. Here are three examples. 
Resale Price Maintenance One example of a controversial business practice 
is resale price maintenance. Imagine that Superduper Electronics sells smartphones 
to retail stores for 5400. If Superduper requires the retailers to charge customers 
$500, it is said to engage in resale price maintenance. Any retailer that charged 
less than $500 would violate its contract with Superduper. 
At first, resale price maintenance might seem anticompetitive. Like an agreement 
among cartel members, it prevents the retailers from competing on price. For this 
reason, the courts have sometimes viewed resale price maintenance as an antitrust 
violation. 
Yet some economists defend the practice. First, they deny that it is aimed at 
reducing competition. If Superduper Electronics wanted to exert its market power, 
it would raise the wholesale price rather than control the resale price. What's more, 
Superduper has no reason to discourage competition among its retailers. Because a 
cartel of retailers sells less than a group of competitive retailers, Superduper would 
be worse off if its retailers were a cartel. 
Second, resale price maintenance may have a legitimate goal. Superduper may 
want its retailers to provide customers with a pleasant showroom and a knowledge￾able sales force. Yet, without resale price maintenance, some customers would take 
advantage of one store’s service to learn about the smartphone’s special features 
and then buy the item at a discount retailer that does not provide this service. 
Good customer service can be viewed as a public good among the retailers that sell 
Superduper products. As Chapter 11 discussed, when one person provides a public 
good, others can use it without paying for it. In this case, discounters would free ride 
on the service provided by other retailers, leading to less service than is desirable. 
Resale price maintenance is one way for Superduper to solve this free-rider problem. 
The example of resale price maintenance illustrates an important principle: 
Business practices that appear to reduce competition sometimes have legitimate 
purposes. This principle makes the application of the antitrust laws all the more 
difficult. Those in charge of enforcing these laws must determine what kinds of 
behavior impede competition and reduce economic well-being. Often that job is 
not easy. 
Predatory Pricing Firms with market power typically use it to raise prices above 
the competitive level. But should policymakers ever be concerned that firms with 
market power might charge prices that are too low? This question is at the heart of 
a second debate over antitrust policy. 
Imagine that a large airline, call it Coyote Air, has a monopoly on some route. 
Then, Roadrunner Express enters and takes 20 percent of the market, leaving Coyote 
with 80 percent. In response to this competition, Coyote starts slashing its fares. Some 
antitrust analysts argue that Coyote’s move could be anticompetitive: The price cuts 
may be intended to drive Roadrunner out of the market so Coyote can recapture 
its monopoly and raise prices again. Such behavior is called predatory pricing. 
Although predatory pricing is a common claim in antitrust suits, some economists 
say that predatory pricing is rarely, if ever, a profitable business strategy. Why? For 
a price war to drive out a rival, prices must be below cost. Yet if Coyote starts selling

cheap tickets at a loss, it had better be ready to fly more planes 
because low fares will attract more customers. Roadrunner, 
meanwhile, can respond to Coyote’s predatory move by cut￾ting back on flights. As a result, Coyote ends up bearing more 
than 80 percent of the losses, putting Roadrunner in a good 
position to survive the price war. As in the old Roadrunner— 
Coyote cartoons, the predator suffers more than the prey. 
Economists debate whether predatory pricing should con￾cern antitrust policymakers. When, if ever, is predatory pricing 
a profitable strategy? Are the courts capable of distinguishing 
between competitive and predatory price cuts? These are hard 
questions. 
Bundling A third example of a controversial business prac￾tice is bundling. Suppose that Makemoney Movies produces 
two new films—Superheroes and Hamlet. If Makemoney offers 
theaters the two films together at a single price, rather than 
separately, the studio is said to be bundling its two products. 
When the practice of bundling movies was challenged, the 
Supreme Court banned it. The court reasoned as follows: Imagine 
that Superhieroes is a blockbuster and Hamlet is an unprofitable 
art film. The studio could use the high demand for Superheroes 
to force theaters to buy Hamlef. Bundling, the court concluded, 
could be a mechanism for a firm to expand its market power. 
In 1963, the economist George Stigler offered a rebuttal to 
this argument. Imagine that theaters are willing to pay $200,000 
for Superheroes and nothing for Hamlet. Then the most that a 
theater would pay for the two movies together is $200,000— 
the same as it would pay for Superheroes by itself. Forcing the 
theater to accept a worthless movie as part of the deal does not 
increase its willingness to pay. Makemoney cannot increase its 
market power simply by bundling the two movies together. 
Stigler suggested another explanation for why bundling 
exists: It is a form of price discrimination. Suppose there 
are two theaters. City Theater 1s willing to pay $150,000 for 
Superheroes and $50,000 for Hamlet. Country Theater is just 
the opposite: It is willing to pay 550,000 for Superheroes and 
$150,000 for Hamlet. If Makemoney charges separate prices 
for the two films, its best strategy is to charge $150,000 for 
each film, and each theater chooses to show only one film. 
Yet if Makemoney offers the two movies as a bundle, it can 
charge each theater $200,000 for the movies. If different the￾aters value the films differently, bundling may allow the stu￾dio to increase profit by charging a combined price closer to 
the buyers’ total willingness to pay. 
Bundling remains a controversial business practice. The 
Supreme Court’s argument that bundling allows a firm to 
extend its market power to other goods may not be well found￾ed, at least in its simplest form. Yet economists have proposed 
more elaborate theories for how bundling can impede competi￾tion. Given the current state of economic knowledge, debate 
continues whether bundling is generally adverse for society.

A particularly important and controversial antitrust case was the U.S. 
government’s suit against the Microsoft Corporation, filed in 1998. 
The case did not lack drama. It pitted one of the world’s most pow￾erful regulatory agencies (the U.S. Justice Department) against one of the world’s 
richest men (Bill Gates). Testifying for the government was a prominent economist 
(MIT professor Franklin Fisher). Testifying for Microsoft was another prominent 
economist (MIT professor Richard Schmalensee, a former student of Franklin 
Fisher). At stake was the future of one of the world’s most valuable companies 
(Microsoft) in one of the economy’s fastest-growing industries (software). 
Bundling was a central issue in the Microsoft case—in particular, whether 
Microsoft should be allowed to integrate its Internet Explorer browser into its 
Windows operating system. The government said that Microsoft was bundling 
these two products together to extend its power in the market for operating systems 
to the unrelated market of Internet browsers. Allowing Microsoft to incorporate 
such products into its operating system, the government argued, would deter other 
software companies from entering the market and offering new products. 
Microsoft said that putting new features into old products is a natural part of tech￾nological progress. By the 1990s, cars included CD players and air conditioners, which 
were once sold separately, and cameras came with built-in flashes. The same was true 
with operating systems. Over time, Microsoft added many features to Windows that 
were previously stand-alone products. This has made computers more reliable and 
easier to use because consumers could be confident that the pieces worked together. 
The integration of Internet technology, Microsoft argued, was the natural next step. 
One point of disagreement concerned the extent of Microsoft’s market power. Noting 
that more than 80 percent of new personal computers used a Microsoft operating sys￾tem, the government argued that the company was effectively a monopoly and was try￾ing to expand its influence into new markets. Microsoft replied that the software market 
was always changing and that Microsoft's Windows was constantly being challenged 
by competitors, such as the Apple Mac and Linux operating systems. It also argued that 
the low price it charged for Windows—about 550 then, or only 3 percent of the price of 
a typical computer—was evidence that its market power was severely limited. 
Like many large antitrust suits, the Microsoft case became a legal morass. In 
November 1999, after a long trial, Judge Penfield Jackson ruled that Microsoft had 
great monopoly power and that it had illegally abused that power. In June 2000, after 
hearings on possible remedies, he ordered that Microsoft be broken up into two com￾panies—one that sold the operating system and one that sold applications software. 
A year later, an appeals court overturned Jackson's breakup order and handed the 
case to a new judge. In September 2001, the Justice Department announced that it no 
longer sought a breakup of the company and wanted to settle the case quickly. 
The two sides reached a settlement in November 2002. Microsoft accepted some 
restrictions on its business practices, and the government accepted that a browser 
would remain part of the Windows operating system. But the settlement did not 
end Microsoft’s antitrust troubles. In subsequent years, the company contended 
with several private antitrust suits, as well as suits brought by the European Union 
alleging a variety of anticompetitive behaviors. 
Technological development has relegated the dispute over the once-mighty 
Explorer browser to the level of a historical footnote. In June 2021, Microsoft said 
it was retiring Explorer, which had lost most of its market share, replacing it with 
a new browser called Edge. Some analysts credited the Justice Department’s settle￾ment with Microsoft as a crucial step that allowed browsers like Google Chrome and 
Apple Safari to grow and ultimately supplant Explorer. @

A New Antitrust Case Cuts to 
the Core of Amazon's ldentity 
By Gilad Edelman 
& Jfounded Amazon 26 years ago with the 
lang-term mission of making it Earth's 
most customer-centric company,” Jeff 
Bezos testified before the House Antitrust 
Subcommittes last summer. "Not every busi￾ness takes this customer-first approach, but 
we do, and it's our greatest strength.” 
Bezos' obsession with customer satisfaction 
is at the center of Amazon's self-mythology. 
Every move the company makes, in this account, 
is designed with anly one goal in mind: making 
the customer happy. if Amazon has become an 
economic juggernaut, the king of ecommerce, 
that's not because of any unfair practices or 
sharp elbows; it's simply because customers 
love it so much. 
The antitrust lawsuit filed against Amazon 
on Tuesday directly challenges that namative. The 
suit, brought by Karl Racine, the Washington, 
DC, attorney general, focuses on Amazon’s use 
of a so-called most-favored-nation clause in its 
contracts with third-party sellers, who account 
for most of the sales volume on Amazon. A most￾GILAD EDELMAN, \WIRED (C) COMNDE MAST 
376 PartV Firm Behavior and the Organization of Industry 
favored-nation clause requires sellers not to offer 
their products at a lower price on any other web￾site, even their own. According to the lawsuit, this 
harms consumers by artificially inflating prices 
across the entire internet, while preventing other 
ecommerce sites from competing against Amazon 
on price. “| filed this antitrust lawsuit to put an 
end to Amazon's ability to control prices across 
the online retail market,” Racine said in a press 
conference announcing the case. 
For a long time, Amazon openly did what OC 
is alleging; its “price parity provision” explicitly 
restricted third-party sellers from offering lower 
prices on other sites. It stopped in Europe in 
2013, after competition authorities in the UK 
and Germany began investigating it. In the 
US, however, the provision lasted longer, until 
Senator Richard Blumenthal wrote a letter to 
antitrust agencies in 2018 suggesting Amazon 
was violating antitrust law. A few months later, 
in early 2019, Amazon dropped price parity. 
But that wasn't the end of the story. The 
DC lawsuit alleges that Amazon simply substi￾tuted a new policy that uses different language 
to accomplish the same result as the old rule. 
Amazon's Marketplace Fair Pricing Policy informs 
third-party sellers that they can be punished or 
suspended for a variety of offenses, including 
“setting a price on a product or service that is 
significantly higher than recent prices offered on 
or off Amazon." This rule can protect consumers 
when used to prevent price-gouging for scarce 
products, as happened with face masks in the 
early days of the pandemic. But it can also be 
used to inflate prices for items that sellers would 
prefer to offer more cheaply. The key phrase is “off 
Amazon.” In other words, Amazon reserves the 
right to cut off sellers if they list their products 
more cheaply on another website—just as it did 
under the old price parity provision. According 
to the final report filed by the House Antitrust 
Subcommittes last year, based on testimony 
from third-party sellers, the new policy “has the 
same effect of blocking s2llers from offering lower 
prices to consumers on other retail sites.” 
The main form that this price discipline 
takes, according to sellers who have spoken out 
against Amazon either publicly or in anonymous 
testimony, is through manipulating access to the 
Buy Box—those Add to Cart and Buy Now buttons 
at the top right of an Amazon product listing. 
When you go to buy something, there are often 
many sellers trying to make the sale. Only one 
can “win the Buy Box." meaning they're the one 
who gets the sale when you click one of those 
buttons. Because most customers don't scroll 
down to see what other sellers are offering the 
product, winning the Buy Box is crucial for anyone 
trying to make a living by selling on Amazon . . . 
Jason Boyce, a longtime Amazon seller tumed 
consultant, explained to me how this works. He 
and his partners were excited when the last third￾party seller contract they signed with Amazon, to 
sell sporting goods on the site, didn't include the

price parity provision. “We thought, ‘This is great! 
We can offer discounts on Walmart, and Sears, 
and wherever else,” he said. But then something 
odd happened. Boyce (who spoke with House 
investigators as part of the antitrust inquiry) 
noticed that once his company lowered prices on 
other sites, sales on Amazon started tanking. “We 
went to the listing, and the &dd to Cart button was 
gone, the Buy Now button was gone. Instead, there 
was a gray box labeled “See All Buying Options.' 
You could still buy the product, but it was an 
extra click. Now, an extra click on Amazon is an 
eternity—they're all about immediate gratifica￾tion." Mareaver, his company's ad spending plum￾meted, which he realized was because Amazon 
doesn't show users ads for products without a Buy 
Box. “Sowhat did we do? We went back and raised 
our prices everywhere else, and within 24 hours 
everything came back. Traffic improved, clicks 
improved, and sales came back.” . . . 
Boyce's experience illustrates something 
important about most-favored-nation clauses: On 
their own, they aren't illegal. The problem comes 
when they're used by a company with a dominant 
share of the market. If a store wants to feature 
a certain brand on its shelves in exchange for 
an agreement not to sell more cheaply at a rival 
chain, the brand can decide whether the deal is 
worth it. But in the case of Amazon, according to 
sellers like Boyce, there is no real choice. The DC 
attorney general’s lawsuit points out that Amazon 
accounts for somewhere between 50 and 70 per￾cent of the US online retail market, and it notes 
that “a staggering 74 percent [of consumers] go 
directly to Amazon when they are ready to buy a

specific product.” It accuses Amazon of using 
its price policy to maintain that monopaly power 
by preventing rival platforms from using lower 
prices to eat into its market share. 
In a statement emailed to reparters, Amazon 
did not exactly deny that it punishes sellers who 
offer lower prices elsewhere, Rather, it suggested 
that this is ultimately good for the consumer. “The 
DC attormey general has it exactly backward— 
sellers set their own prices for the products they 
offer in our store,” the company said. “Amazon 
takes pride in the fact that we offer low prices 
across the broadest selection, and like any store 
we reserve the right not to highlight offers to 
customers that are not priced competitively. The 
relief the AG seeks would force Amazon to feature 
higher prices to customers, oddly going against 
core objectives of antitrust law.” 
But this logic relies on a very idiosyncratic 
definition of “priced competitively.” When some￾one goes to Amazon to buy something, they want 
the site to show them the best deal available on 
Amazon. If Jenny's Bike Supply has the best 
RVLSOFT/SHUTTEASTOCK. COM 
deal on Amazon for chain locks, then it's the best 
deal, regardless of whether Jenny is also sell￾ing the locks for an even better price on eBay. If 
Amazon makes it harder to buy the lock from Jenny 
in this scenario, the only thing it accomplishes is 
forcing customers to settle for the second-best 
deal. And, of course, it will probably succesd in 
forcing Jenny to raise prices on eBay. What it wor't 
do is result in lower prices on Amazan, 
All of which makes the DC lawsuit a nar￾rower and potentially more winnable case than 
some of the other antitrust litigation that has 
been brought against tech companies. W

18-4 Conclusion 
Oligopolies would like to act like monopolies, but self-interest drives them toward 
competition. Where oligopolies end up on this spectrum depends on the number 
of firms in the oligopoly and the extent to which the firms cooperate. The story of 
the prisoners’ dilemma shows why oligopolies can fail to maintain cooperation, 
even when cooperation is in their best interest. 
Policymakers regulate the behavior of oligopolists through the antitrust laws. The 
proper scope of these laws is the subject of ongoing debate. There is little doubt that 
price fixing among competing firms reduces economic welfare and is an appropriate 
target for regulators, but some business practices that appear to reduce competition may 
have legitimate, if subtle, purposes. As a result, policymakers need to be careful when

Chapter in a Nutshell 
* Oligopolists maximize their total profits by forming a 
cartel and acting like a monopolist. Yet, if oligopolists 
make decisions about production levels individually, 
the result is a greater quantity and a lower price than 
under the monopoly outcome. The larger the number . 
of firms in the oligopoly, the closer the quantity and 
price will be to the levels that would prevail under 
perfect competition.

Problems and Applications 
1. Alarge share of the world supply of diamonds 
comes from Russia and South Africa. Suppose that 
the marginal cost of mining diamonds is constant at 
51,000 per diamond and the demand for diamonds is 
described by the following schedule: 
Price Quantity 
$8,000 5,000 diamonds 
7,000 6,000 
6,000 7,000

when cooperation is in their mutual interest. The logic 
of the prisoners” dilemma applies to many situations, 
including arms races, common-resource problems, and 
oligopolies. 
Policymakers use the antitrust laws to prevent oligopo￾lies from engaging in behavior that reduces competi￾tion. The application of these laws can be controversial 
because some behavior that can appear to reduce 
competition may have legitimate business purposes.

hen you finish school, your income will be determined 
largely by what kind of job you take. If you work as a 
computer programmer, you are likely to earn more than 
if you work as a gas station attendant. This fact is puzzling. No 
law requires that computer programmers be paid more than gas 
station attendants. No ethical principle says that programmers 
are more deserving. What, then, determines which job pays the 
higher wage? 
Your income is a small piece of a larger economic picture. In 
2021, the total income of all U.S. residents, a statistic called national 
income, was about $20 trillion. People earned this income in vari￾ous ways. Workers earned about two-thirds of it in the form of 
wages and fringe benefits, such as health insurance and pension 
contributions. The rest went to landowners and to the owners of 
capital—the economy’s stock of equipment and structures—in the 
form of rent, profit, and interest. What determines how much goes 
to workers? To landowners? To the owners of capital? Why do some 
workers earn higher wages than others, some landowners higher 
rental income than others, and some capital owners greater profit 
than others? Why, in particular, do computer programmers earn 
more than gas station attendants?

factors of production 
the inputs used to 
produce goods and 
services 
The answers to these questions, like most in economics, hinge on supply and 
demand. The supply and demand for labor, land, and capital determine the prices 
paid to workers, landowners, and capital owners. To understand why some people 
earn more than others, we need to look more deeply at the markets for the services 
they provide. We take up that task in this and the next two chapters. 
This chapter presents the basic theory of factor markets. As you may recall from 
Chapter 2, the factors of production are the inputs used to produce goods and 
services. Labor, land, and capital are the three most important factors of produc￾tion. When a computer firm produces software, it uses programmers’ time (labor), 
the physical space where its offices are located (land), and an office building and 
computer equipment (capital). When a gas station sells gas, it uses attendants’ time 
(labor), the station’s physical space (land), and gas tanks and pumps (capital). 
Factor markets differ from the markets for goods and services analyzed in pre￾vious chapters in one important way: The demand for a factor of production is a 
derived demand. That is, a firm’s demand for a factor of production is derived 
from its decision to supply a good in another market. For example, the demand for 
programmers is linked to the supply of software, and the demand for gas station 
attendants is linked to the supply of gasoline. 
This chapter analyzes factor demand by considering how competitive, profit￾maximizing firms decide how much of a factor to buy. The analysis begins by 
examining the demand for labor. Labor is the most important factor of production, 
as reflected by the fact that workers receive most of national income. Later in the 
chapter, the analysis is extended to the other factors of production. 
The theory of factor markets developed in this chapter takes a large step toward 
explaining how the income of the U.S. economy is distributed among workers, 
landowners, and owners of capital. Chapter 20 builds on this analysis to examine 
in more detail why some workers earn more than others. Chapter 21 examines how 
much income inequality results from the functioning of factor markets and then 
considers the government’s role in altering the income distribution. 
19-1 The Demand for Labor 
The forces of supply and demand govern most markets in the economy, and the 
labor market is no exception. This is illustrated in Figure 1. In panel (a), the supply 
and demand for apples determine the price of apples. In panel (b), the supply and 
demand for apple pickers determine the price, or wage, of apple pickers. 
As we have noted, labor demand is a derived demand. Rather than being final 
goods ready to be consumed, most labor services are inputs into the production of 
other goods. To understand labor demand, we focus on the firms that hire the labor 
and use it to produce goods for sale. The link between the supply of goods and the 
demand for labor to produce them is crucial in determining equilibrium wages. 
19-1a The Competitive, Profit-Maximizing Firm 
Consider how an apple producer decides what quantity of labor to demand. The 
firm owns an orchard and each week decides how many apple pickers to hire to 
harvest its crop. After the firm hires its workers, they pick the apples. The firm sells 
the apples, pays the workers, and keeps what's left as profit. 
The theory developed in this chapter is based on two assumptions about the firm. 
First, the firm is competitive both in the market for apples (where it is a seller) and 
in the market for apple pickers (where it is a buyer). A competitive firm is a price 
taker. Because many firms sell apples and hire apple pickers, a single firm has little

influence over the price it gets for apples or the wage it pays apple pickers. The 
firm takes the price and wage as given by market conditions. It only has to decide 
how many apples to sell and how many workers to hire. 
Second, the firm is profit-maximizing. It does not care about the number of 
workers it employs or the number of apples it produces, except insofar as they 
affect profit, which equals the total revenue from the sale of apples minus the total 
cost of producing them. The firm’s supply of apples and its demand for workers 
are derived from its primary goal of maximizing profit. 
19-1b The Production Function and the 
Marginal Product of Labor 
To make its hiring decision, a firm considers how the size of its workforce affects 
its output. For the apple producer, the question is how the number of apple pick￾ers affects the quantity of apples it can harvest and sell. Table 1 gives a numerical 
example. Column (1) shows the number of workers. Column (2) shows the quantity 
of apples the workers harvest each week. 
These two columns of numbers describe the firm’s ability to produce apples. 
Recall that economists use the term production function to describe the relation￾ship between the quantity of the inputs used in production and the quantity of 
output from production. Here the “input” is the apple pickers, and the “output” 
is the apples. The other inputs—the trees themselves, the land, the firm's trucks 
and tractors, and so on—are held fixed for now. This firm’s production function 
shows that if the firm hires 1 worker, that worker will pick 100 bushels of apples 
per week. If the firm hires 2 workers, the 2 workers together will pick 180 bushels 
per week. And so on.

One of the Ten Principles of Economics in Chapter 1 is that rational people think 
at the margin. This idea is the key to understanding how firms decide how much 
labor to hire. To take a step toward this decision, column (3) in Table 1 shows the 
marginal product of labor, the additional output produced by an additional unit of 
labor. When the firm increases the number of workers from 1 to 2, for example, the 
quantity of apples produced rises from 100 to 180 bushels. Therefore, the marginal 
product of the second worker is 80 bushels. 
Notice that as the number of workers increases, the marginal product of labor 
declines. That is, the production process exhibits diminishing marginal product. 
At first, when only a few workers are hired, they can pick the low-hanging fruit. 
As the number of workers increases, additional workers must climb higher up the 
ladders to find apples to pick. So as more workers are hired, each additional one 
contributes less to production. For this reason, the production function in Figure 2 
becomes flatter as the number of workers rises. 
19-1¢ The Value of the Marginal Product 
and the Demand for Labor 
Cwr profit-maximizing firm is concerned not about the apples themselves but rather 
about the money it can make by producing and selling them. As a result, when 
deciding how many workers to hire to pick apples, the firm considers how much 
profit each worker will bring in. Because profit is total revenue minus total cost, 
the profit from an additional worker is the worker’s contribution to revenue minus 
the worker’s wage. 
To find the worker's contribution to revenue, we must convert the marginal 
product of labor (which is measured in bushels of apples) into the value of the mar￾ginal product (which is measured in dollars). We do this using the price of apples. 
If a bushel of apples sells for $10 and an additional worker produces 80 bushels of 
apples, then the worker produces $800 of revenue. 
The value of the marginal product of any input is the marginal product of that 
input multiplied by the market price of the output. Column (4) in Table 1 shows 
the value of the marginal product of labor, assuming the price of apples is $10 
per bushel. Because the market price is constant for a competitive firm while the 
marginal product declines with more workers, the value of the marginal product 
diminishes as the number of workers rises. Economists sometimes call this column 
of numbers the firm’s marginal revenue product: It is the extra revenue the firm 
gets from hiring an additional unit of a factor of production. 
Now consider how many workers the firm will hire. Suppose that the market 
wage for apple pickers is $500 per week. In this case, as Table 1 shows, hiring the 
first worker is profitable: The first worker yields $1,000 in revenue and $500 in 
profit. Similarly, the second worker vields $800 in additional revenue and $300 
in profit. The third yields $600 in additional revenue and $100 in profit. After the 
third worker, however, hiring workers is unprofitable. The fourth worker would 
generate only $400 of additional revenue. Because the worker s wage is $500, hiring 
the fourth worker would mean a 5100 reduction in profit. The rational decision is 
clear: The firm hires 3 workers. 
Figure 3 graphs the value of the marginal product. This curve slopes downward 
because the marginal product of labor diminishes as the number of workers rises. 
The figure also includes a horizontal line at the market wage. To maximize profit, 
the firm hires workers up to the point where these two curves cross. Below this 
level of employment, the value of the marginal product exceeds the wage, so hiring

another worker increases profit. Above this level of employment, the value of the 
marginal product is less than the wage, so the marginal worker is unprofitable. A 
competitive, profit-maximizing firm hires workers up to the point at which the 
value of the marginal product of labor equals the wage. 
Based on the profit-maximizing hiring strategy for a competitive firm, we 
can offer a theory of labor demand. Recall that a firm’s labor-demand curve tells 
us the quantity of labor that a firm decides to hire at any given wage. Figure 3 
shows that the firm makes that decision by choosing the quantity of labor at 
which the value of the marginal product equals the wage. As a result, the value￾of-margmal product curve is the labor-demand curve for a competitive, profit￾maximizing firm. 
19-1d What Causes the Labor-Demand Curve to Shift? 
The labor-demand curve reflects the value of the marginal product of labor. With 
this insight in mind, consider a few of the things that might cause the labor-demand 
curve to shift. 
The Output Price The value of the marginal product is marginal product times 
the price of the firm’s output. When the output price changes, the value of the 
marginal product changes, and the labor-demand curve shifts. An increase in the 
price of apples, for instance, raises the value of the marginal product of each worker 
who picks apples and, therefore, increases labor demand from the firms that sup￾ply apples. Conversely, a decrease in the price of apples reduces the value of the 
marginal product and decreases labor demand. 
Technological Change Between 1960 and 2020, the output a typical U.S. worker 
produced in an hour rose by 236 percent. Why? The most important reason is

product. Because the production function links the quantity of inputs to 
the quantity of output, the firm's decision about input demand and its 
decision about output supply are two sides of the same coin. 
To see this relationship more fully, consider how the marginal product 
of labor (MPL) and marginal cost (MC) are related. Suppose an additional 
worker costs $500 and has a marginal product of 50 bushels of apples. In 
this case, producing 50 more bushels costs the firm $500, so the marginal 
cost of a bushel is $500/50, or $10. More generally, if Wis the wage, and 
an extra unit of labor produces MPL units of output, then the marginal 
cost of a unit of output is MC = W/MPL 
This analysis shows that diminishing marginal product is closely 
related to increasing marginal cost. When the apple orchard grows crowded 
with workers, each additional worker adds less to the production of apples 
(MFL falls). Similarly, when the apple firm is producing a large quantity of 
apples, the orchard is already crowded with workers, so it is more costly 
Chapter 19 The Markets for the Factors of Production 
Now consider our criterion for profit maximization. We determined 
that a profit-maximizing firm chooses the quantity of labor at which the 
value of the marginal product (P > MPL) equals the wage (W). We can 
write this mathematically as: 
Px MPL = W. 
Dividing both sides of this equation by MPL yields: 
P=W/MPL 
We just noted that W/MPL equals marginal cost, MC. Therefore, we can 
substitute to obtain: 
F= MC. 
This equation states that the price of the firm's cutput equals the 
marginal cost of producing a unit of output. When a competitive firm 
hires labor up to the point at which the value of the marginal product 
equals the wage, it also produces up to the point at which the price 
equals marginal cost. The analysis of labor demand in this chapter 
is just another way of looking at the production decision discussed in 
Chapter 15. m 
387 
to produce an additional bushel of apples (MC rises). 
technological progress: Scientists and engineers figured out new and better ways 
of doing things. This has profound implications for the labor market. Advances in 
technology usually raise the marginal product of labor, increasing the demand for 
labor and shifting the labor-demand curve to the right. 
But technological change can also reduce labor demand. The invention of a cheap 
industrial robot, for instance, could reduce the marginal product of labor, shifting 
the labor-demand curve to the left. Economists call this a labor-saving technologi￾cal change. History suggests, however, that most technological progress is instead 
labor-augmenting. For example, a carpenter with a nail gun is more productive 
than a carpenter with only a hammer. Labor-augmenting technological advances 
explain persistently rising employment in the face of rising wages: Even though 
wages (adjusted for inflation) increased by 201 percent from 1960 to 2020, firms 
roughly doubled the amount of labor they employed. 
The Supply of Other Factors The quantity of one factor of production that is 
available can affect the marginal product of other factors. The productivity of apple 
pickers depends, for instance, on the availability of ladders. If the supply of ladders 
declines, the marginal product of apple pickers will decline as well, reducing the 
demand for apple pickers. We consider the linkage among the factors of production 
more fully later in the chapter.

19-2 The Supply of Labor 
Having analyzed labor demand, let’s turn to the other side of the market and con￾sider labor supply. A formal model of labor supply is included in Chapter 22, which 
develops the theory of household decision making. Here we informally discuss the 
decisions that lie behind the labor-supply curve. 
19-2a The Trade-Off between Work and Leisure 
One of the Ten Principles of Economics in Chapter 1 is that people face trade￾offs. Probably no trade-off in a person’s life is more important than the trade￾off between work and leisure. The more hours you spend working, the fewer 
hours you have to enjoy dinner with friends, browse social media, or pursue 
your favorite hobby. The trade-off between labor and leisure lies behind the 
labor-supply curve. 
Another of the Ten Principles of Economics is that the cost of some￾thing is what you give up to get it. What do you give up to get an hour 
of leisure? You give up an hour of work, which in turn means an hour of 
wages. If your wage is $20 per hour, the opportunity cost of an hour of 
leisure is $20. And when you get a raise to $25 per hour, the opportunity 
cost of leisure increases. 
The labor-supply curve reflects how workers” decisions about the labor￾leisure trade-off respond to a change in that opportunity cost. An upward￾sloping labor-supply curve means that an increase in the wage induces workers 
_ ) to increase the quantity of labor they supply. Because time is limited, more work

in terms of conflicting effects on your labor-supply decision, called the income 
effect and substitution effect. The income effect reflects the response of hours 
worked due to a change in a person’s level of economic well-being, while the 
substitution effect reflects the response of hours worked due to a change in the 
opportunity cost of leisure. For now, let’s put aside the possibility of backward￾sloping labor supply. That is, we assume that the substitution effect dominates, 
so the labor-supply curve slopes upward. 
19-2b What Causes the Labor-Supply Curve to Shift? 
The labor-supply curve shifts whenever people change the amount they want 
to work at a given wage. Consider some of the events that might cause such 
a shift. 
Changes in Preferences In 1950, 34 percent of women were employed at paid 
jobs or looking for work. By 2020, that number had risen to 56 percent. One of the 
many explanations for this development is changing preferences or attitudes toward 
work. In 1950, women routinely stayed at home and raised their children. Today, 
the typical family size is smaller, and more mothers choose to work. One result is 
an increase in the supply of labor. 
Changes in Alternative Opportunities The supply of labor in any one labor 
market depends on the opportunities available in other labor markets. If the wage 
earned by pear pickers suddenly rises, some apple pickers may choose to switch 
occupations, causing the supply of labor in the market for apple pickers to fall. 
Immigration The movement of workers from region to region or country to 
country is an important source of shifts in labor supply. When migrant workers 
come north for the autumn harvest, the supply of labor increases in apple orchards, 
but it declines in orange-processing plants in the south. When immigrants come to 
the United States, the supply of labor increases in the United States and falls in the 
immigrants’ home countries. Much of the policy debate about immigration centers 
on its effect on labor supply and equilibrium wages.

So far, we have established two facts about how wages are determined in competi￾tive labor markets: 
¢ The wage adjusts to balance the supply and demand for labor. 
¢ The wage equals the value of the marginal product of labor. 
At first, it might seem surprising that the wage can do both things at once. In fact,

understanding wage determination. 
Figure 4 shows the labor market in equilibrium. The wage 
and the quantity of labor have adjusted to balance supply and 
demand. When the market is in this equilibrium, each firm has 
bought as much labor as it finds profitable at the equilibrium 
wage. That is, each firm has followed the rule for profit maxi￾mization: It has hired workers until the value of the marginal 
product equals the wage. Hence, the wage must equal the value 
of the marginal product of labor once it has brought supply and 
demand into equilibrium. 
This brings us to an important lesson: Any event that changes 
the supply or demand for labor must change the equilibrium 
wage and the value of the marginal product by the same amount 
because these must always be equal. To see how this works, let’s 
consider some events that shift these curves. 
19-3a Shifts in Labor Supply 
Suppose that immigration increases the number of workers will￾ing to pick apples. As Figure 5 shows, the supply of labor shifts to 
the right from 5, to 5,. At the initial wage W, the quantity of labor 
supplied now exceeds the quantity demanded. This surplus of 
labor puts downward pressure on the wage of apple pickers, and 
the fall in the wage from W, to W, makes it profitable for firms to 
hire more workers. As the number of workers employed in each 
apple orchard rises, the marginal product of a worker falls, and so 
does the value of the marginal product. In the new equilibrium, 
both the wage and the value of the marginal product of labor are 
lower than they were before the influx of new workers. 
An episode from Israel, studied by the economist Joshua 
Angrist, illustrates how a shift in labor supply can alter the equi￾librium in a labor market. During most of the 1980s, many thou￾sands of Palestinians regularly commuted from their homes in 
the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip to jobs in Israel, 
primarily in the construction and agriculture industries. In 1988, 
however, political unrest in these occupied areas induced the 
Israeli government to take steps that, as a by-product, reduced 
this supply of workers. Curfews were imposed, work permits 
were checked more thoroughly, and a ban on overnight stays of 
Palestinians in Israel was enforced more rigorously. The economic 
impact of these steps was exactly as theory predicts: The number 
of Palestinians with jobs in Israel fell by half, while those who

kinds of workers. A wave of immigration may lower wages in those labor markets in 
which the new immigrants seek work, but it could have the opposite effect in other 
labor markets. For example, if the new immigrants look for jobs as apple pickers, 
the supply of apple pickers increases, and the wage of apple pickers declines. But 
suppose the new immigrants are physicians who use some of their income to buy 
apples. In this case, the wave of immigration increases the supply of physicians but 
also increases the demand for apples and thus apple pickers. As a result, the wages 
of physicians decline, and the wages of apple pickers rise. The linkages among vari￾ous markets—sometimes called general equilibrium effects—make analyzing the 
full effect of immigration more complex than it first appears. 
The Immigration Debate 
Pat Paulsen was a comedian from the 1960s to the 1990s who, 
every four years, conducted a faux campaign for president. “All the 
problems we face in the United States today,” Mr. Paulsen would 
say, “can be traced to an unenlightened immigration policy on the part of the 
American Indian.” 
That quip contains a deep truth. Most Americans today are beneficiaries of a 
policy that welcomed their ancestors when they arrived at the border. But that does 
not stop immigration from being a divisive political issue. One reason for this divi￾siveness is immigration’s economic impact. 
The welfare effects of immigration can be seen through the lens of international 
trade. Recall from Chapter 9 that when a nation allows a good to be imported, the 
price falls. Consumers of the good are better off, and domestic producers are worse 
off. But the increases in consumer surplus exceed the losses in producer surplus, 
so total surplus rises. In other words, imports expand the economic pie but leave 
some with a smaller slice. 
Immigration entails an import of labor services. The consumers of these services 
are the firms that hire the labor and their customers, both of which benefit when 
immigration increases labor supply. The domestic producers in this case are the 
native workers who are now competing with new workers from abroad and, as a 
result, experience reduced earnings. The net benefit to the economy is positive, but 
that fact may not offer much comfort to those with depressed incomes. 
How large are the labor market effects of immigration? The economist George 
Borjas estimates that the increased total surplus from immigration into the United 
States is about (.25 percent of U.S. national income annually. In addition, about 2.5 
percent of national income is redistributed from the native losers (the workers who 
compete with the immigrants) to the native winners (those who consume these 
labor services). Not included in these numbers are the benefits to the immigrants 
themselves, whose earnings in the United States far exceed what they would have 
been had they stayed in their home countries. 
Some economists have proposed ways to distribute the gains from immigration 
more equitably. For example, immigrants could be subject to a special tax levied on 
either them or their employers. The revenue could be used to reduce the tax burden 
on native workers. If native workers shared more of the benefits from immigration, 
they might be more likely to welcome it. 
The debate over immigration is not just about economics, however. It also has 
a powerful, emotional element that concerns cultural and national identity. But 
most Americans would do well to remember how lucky they are that the American 
Indian did not pursue the enlightened immigration policy suggested by Mr. 
Paulsen. @

Now suppose that an increase in the popularity of apples causes their price to rise. 
This price increase does not change the marginal product of labor for any given 
number of workers, but it does raise the value of the marginal product. With a higher 
price for apples, hiring more apple pickers is now profitable. As Figure 6 shows, 
when the demand for labor shifts to the right from D, to D,, the equilibrium wage 
rises from W| to Wz' and equilibrium employment rises from LI to Lz. Once again, 
the wage and the value of the marginal product of labor move together. 
This analysis shows that prosperity for firms in an industry is often linked to 
prosperity for workers in that industry. When the price of apples rises, apple pro￾ducers make a greater profit, and apple pickers earn higher wages. When the price 
of apples falls, apple producers earn a smaller profit, and apple pickers earn lower 
wages. This lesson is well known to workers in industries with highly volatile 
prices. Workers in oil fields, for instance, know from experience that their earnings 
are closely linked to the world price of crude oil. 
From these examples, you should now have a good understanding of how wages 
are set in competitive labor markets. Labor supply and labor demand together 
determine the equilibrium wage, and shifts in the supply or demand curve for labor 
cause the equilibrium wage to change. At the same time, profit maximization by 
the firms that demand labor ensures that the equilibrium wage always equals the 
value of the marginal product of labor. 
Productivity and Wages 
One of the Ten Principles of Economics in Chapter 1 is that a coun￾try’s standard of living depends on its ability to produce goods 
and services. This principle is evident in the market for labor. OQur 
analysis of labor demand shows that wages equal productivity as measured by

the value of the marginal product of labor. Put simply, highly productive workers 
tend to be highly paid, and less productive workers typically earn less. 
This lesson is key to understanding why workers today are generally better off 
than workers in previous generations. From 1960 to 2020, economy-wide produc￾tivity as measured by output per hour of work grew about 2.0 percent per year. Real 
wages (that is, wages adjusted for inflation) grew at 1.9 percent per year—almost 
the same rate. This change in wages may be too small to notice year to year, but it 
compounds over many years. With a growth rate of 2 percent per year, productivity 
and real wages double about every 35 years. 
The link between productivity and real wages appears again when we examine 
various historical periods with different productivity experiences, as shown in 
Figure 7. When productivity grows rapidly, real wages rise quickly. When produc￾tivity grows slowly, the increase in real wages is more modest. The most recent 
period, 2010 to 2020, exhibited low growth in both productivity and real wages.

19-4 The Other Factors of Production: 
Land and Capital 
We have seen how firms decide how much labor to hire and how these decisions 
affect workers’ wages. As firms hire workers, they also decide about other inputs 
to production. For example, our apple-producing firm might have to choose the 
size of its orchard and the number of ladders for apple pickers. Think of the firm's 
factors of production as falling into three categories: labor, land, and capital. 
The meanings of the terms labor and land are clear, but the definition of capital 
is tricky. Economists use the term capital to refer to the stock of equipment and 
structures used for production. That is, capital represents the accumulation of goods 
produced in the past that are being used in the present to produce new goods and 
services. For our apple firm, the capital stock includes the ladders used to climb 
the trees, the trucks used to transport the apples, the buildings used to store the 
apples, and even the apple trees themselves. 
19-4a Equilibrium in the Markets for Land and Capital 
What determines how much the owners of land and capital earn for their contribu￾tion to production? Before answering this question, we need to distinguish between 
two prices: the purchase price and the rental price. The purchase price of land or 
capital is the price paid to own it indefinitely. The rental price is the price paid to 
use that factor for a limited period. Keep this distinction in mind because, as we 
will see, these prices are determined by somewhat different economic forces. 
Here's the key insight: The theory of factor demand that we developed for the 
labor market also applies to the markets for land and capital. Because the wage is 
the rental price of labor, much of what we have learned about wage determination 
is relevant to the rental prices of land and capital. As Figure 8 illustrates, the rental

abor income is easy to understand: It's the paycheck that workers get 
from their employers. The income earned by capital is less obvious. 
Our analysis implicitly assumed that households own the economy's 
stock of capital—Iladders, drill presses, warehouses, and so on—and rent 
it to the firms that use it Capital income, in this case, is the rent that 
households receive for the use of their capital. This assumption simplified 
our analysis of how capital owners are compensated, but it is not entirely 
realistic. In fact, firms wsually own the capital they use and receive the 
earnings from this capital. 
These earnings from capital are eventually paid to households in 
various ways. Some of the earnings are paid as interest to households 
that have lent money to firms. Bondholders and bank depositors are two 
examples. When you receive interest on your bank account, that income 
is part of the economy’s capital income. 
stockholder {or shareholder) is a person who has bought a share in the 
firm's ownership and, therefore, is entitled to a portion of its profits. 
A firm does not have to pay out all its earnings to households in the form 
of interest and dividends. Instead, it can keep some of its earnings within 
the firm. Retained earnings can be used to add to the firm's cash position 
or to buy additional capital. Unlike dividends, retained earnings do not 
yield a direct cash payment to the firm's stockholders, but the stockholders 
benefit fram them nonetheless. Because retained earnings increase the 
firm’s assets, they tend to increase the value of the firm's stock. 
These institutional details are important, but they do not alter our 
conclusion about the income earned by the owners of capital. Capital is 
paid according to the value of its marginal product, regardless of whether 
this income is transmitted to households in the form of interest or dividends 
or whether it is kept within firms as retained eamings. | 
In addition, some of the earnings from capital are paid to households 
as dividends. Dividends are payments by a firm to its stockholders. A 
price of land, shown in panel (a), and the rental price of capital, shown in panel 
(b), are determined by supply and demand. What's more, the demands for land 
and capital are determined just like the demand for labor. That is, when the apple￾producing firm decides how much land and how many ladders to rent, it follows 
the same logic as it does when deciding how many workers to hire. For both land 
and capital, the firm increases the quantity rented until the value of the factor’s 
marginal product equals the factor's price. The demand curve for each factor reflects 
that factor’s marginal productivity. 
This theory can now explain how much income goes to labor, landowners, and 
the owners of capital. As long as the firms using the factors of production are com￾petitive and profit-maximizing, each factor’s rental price must equal the value of 
its marginal product. Labor, land, and capital all earn the value of their marginal 
contributions to the production process. 
Now consider the purchase price of land and capital. The rental price and pur￾chase price are related: Buyers are willing to pay more for a piece of land or capital 
if it produces a valuable stream of rental income. And the equilibrium rental income 
at any point in time equals the value of that factor’s marginal product. As a result, 
the equilibrium purchase price of a piece of land or capital depends not only on the 
current value of the marginal product but also on the value of the marginal product 
expected to prevail in the future. 
19-4b Linkages among the Factors of Production 
In competitive factor markets, the price paid for any factor of production—labor, 
land, or capital—equals the value of its marginal product. The marginal product of 
any factor, in turn, depends on the quantity of that factor that is available. Because 
of diminishing marginal product, a factor in abundant supply has a low marginal

product and a low price, and a factor in scarce supply has a high marginal product 
and a high price. When the supply of a factor falls, its equilibrium price rises. 
But when the supply of any factor changes, the effects are not limited to the 
market for that factor. In most situations, factors of production are used together 
in a way that makes the productivity of each factor depend on the quantities of 
the other factors available for use in the production process. As a result, when 
some event changes the supply of any one factor of production, it will typically 
affect not only the earnings of that factor but also the earnings of all the other 
factors as well. 
For example, suppose a hurricane destroys many of the ladders that workers 
use to pick apples. (To keep things simple, imagine that the storm miraculously 
leaves the orchards intact.) What happens to the earnings of the various factors 
of production? Most obviously, when the supply of ladders falls, the equilibrium 
rental price of ladders rises. Those owners lucky enough to have avoided damage 
to their ladders now earn a higher return when they rent them out to the firms that 
produce apples. 
Yet the effects of this event do not stop at the ladder market. Because there are 
tewer ladders, the workers who pick apples can’t perform their jobs as efficiently. 
In other words, the marginal product of labor declines. The reduction in the sup￾ply of ladders reduces the demand for the labor of apple pickers, and this shift in 
demand causes the equilibrium wage to fall. 
This story shows a general lesson: An event that changes the supply of any fac￾tor of production can alter the earnings of all the factors. The change in earnings 
of any factor can be found by analyzing the impact of the event on the value of the 
marginal product of that factor. 
The Economics of the Black Death 
In 14th-century Europe, the bubonic plague wiped out about 
one-third of the population within a few years—a vastly more 
calamitous event than even the tragic Covid pandemic of 2020 and 
2021, which killed less than 1 percent of the population. This event, called the 
Black Death, provides a grisly natural experiment to test the theory of factor mar￾kets that we have just developed. Consider the effects of the Black Death on those 
who were lucky enough to survive. What do you think happened to the wages 
earned by workers and the rents earned by landowners? 
To answer this question, let’s examine the effects of a reduced population on 
the marginal product of labor and the marginal product of land. With a smaller 
supply of workers, the marginal product of labor rises. This is diminishing mar￾ginal product working in reverse. We would, therefore, expect the Black Death to 
raise Wflgflfi-. 
Because land and labor are used together in production, a smaller supply of 
workers also affects the market for land, the other major factor of production in 
medieval Europe. With fewer workers available to farm the land, an additional 
unit of land produced less additional output. This decline in the marginal product 
of land would be expected to reduce rents. 
Both theoretical predictions conform with the historical evidence. Wages approx￾imately doubled during this period, and rents declined 50 percent or more. For 
survivors, the Black Death led to economic prosperity for the peasant classes and 
reduced incomes for the landed classes. @

19-5 Conclusion 
This chapter has explained how labor, land, and capital are compensated for the 
roles they play in the production process. The theory developed here is called the 
neoclassical theory of distribution. According to the neoclassical theory, the amount 
paid to each factor of production depends on the supply and demand for that factor. 
The demand, in turn, depends on that factor’s marginal productivity. In equilib￾rium, each factor of production earns the value of its marginal contribution to the 
production of goods and services. 
The neoclassical theory of distribution is widely accepted. Most economists begin 
with it when trying to explain how the U.S. economy’s $20 trillion of income is dis￾tributed among the economy’s various members. The next two chapters consider 
the distribution of income in more detail. The neoclassical theory provides the 
framework for that discussion. 
Even at this point, you can use the theory to answer the question that began this 
chapter: Why are computer programmers paid more than gas station attendants? 
It is because programmers can produce a good of greater market value than can 
gas station attendants. People are willing to pay dearly for a good video game, but 
they are willing to pay little to have their gas pumped and windshield washed. 
The wages of these workers reflect the market prices of the goods they produce. 
If people suddenly got tired of using computers and decided to spend more time 
driving, the prices of these goods would change and so would the equilibrium 
wages of these workers. 
Chapter in a Nutshell 
* The economy's income is distributed in the markets an increase in the wage by working more hours and 
for the factors of production. The three most important 
factors are labor, land, and capital. 
The demand for factors, such as labor, is a derived 
demand that comes from firms that use the factors 
to produce goods and services. Competitive, profil￾maximizing firms hire each factor up to the point 
at which the value of the factor’s marginal product 
equals its price. 
The supply of labor arises from individuals’ trade￾off between work and leisure. An upward-sloping 
labor-supply curve means that people respond to 
enjoying less leisure. 
In competitive factor markets, the price paid to each 
factor adjusts to balance supply and demand. Because 
factor demand reflects the value of the factor’s margin￾al product, in equilibrium, each factor is compensated 
according to its marginal contribution to the produc￾tion of goods and services. 
Because factors of production are used together, the mar￾ginal product of any one factor depends on the available 
quantities of all factors. A change in the supply of one 
factor alters the equilibrium earnings of all of them.

of capital, L is the amount of labor, and A is a 
parameter that measures the state of technology.

magazine, the superstar Taylor Swift earned $24 million, making 
her the year’s best-paid musician. These vast differences in earn￾ings have enormous implications. They explain why some people 
live in mansions, ride in private jets, and vacation on their own 
islands, while others live in small apartments, ride the bus, and 
don’t take much of a vacation at all. 
Why do earnings vary so much? Chapter 19, which developed the 
basic neoclassical theory of the labor market, offered an answer. It said 
that wages are governed by supply and demand, like so much else 
in the economy. Labor demand reflects the marginal productivity of 
labor, and in equilibrium, workers are paid the value of their marginal 
contribution to the production of goods and services. 
This theory of the labor market, though widely accepted by 
economists, is only the beginning of the story. To explain dispari￾ties in earnings, we must go beyond this general framework. This 
chapter examines more precisely what determines the supply and 
demand for different types of labor and why, in some cases, wages 
depart from their equilibrium levels. It also considers how discrimi￾nation can influence labor-market outcomes. ETTY 1 h425ES 404 Part V1 The Econamics of Labor Markets

DARA FRADDMACAATOON COLLECTIONS 
Let’s first consider how the characteristics of jobs and workers affect labor supply, 
labor demand, and equilibrium wages. 
20-1a Compensating Differentials 
When a worker is deciding whether to take a job, the wage is only one of many 
factors to consider. Some jobs are easy, fun, and safe. Others are hard, boring, and 
even dangerous. The more a job appeals to people, the more people are willing to 
do it at a given wage. In other words, the supply of labor is greater for easy, fun, 
and safe jobs than for hard, boring, and dangerous ones. As a result, other things 
being equal, appealing ]flbs will tend to have lower equilibrium wages than less 
appealing ones. 
Imagine you are looking for a summer job in a beach community. Two jobs are 
available: beach-badge checker and garbage collector. The beach-badge checkers 
take leisurely strolls near the water during the day and ensure that the tourists have 
bought the required permits. The garbage collectors wake up before dawn and drive 
dirty, noisy trucks around town to pick up garbage. Which job would you want? If 
the wages were the same, most people would prefer the job on the beach. To induce 
people to become garbage collectors, the town must offer higher wages to garbage 
collectors than to beach-badge checkers. 
Economists use the term compensating differential to refer to a wage differ￾ence that arises from nonmonetary characteristics of different jobs. Compensating 
differentials are common. Here are some examples: 
* Roofers are paid more than other workers with similar levels of education. 
Their higher wage compensates them for the nasty smell of tar and the con￾stant risk of accidents. 
* Workers on night shifts are paid more than similar workers on day shifts. 
The higher wage compensates them for having to work at night and sleep 
during the day, a lifestyle that most people find undesirable. 
¢ Professors are paid less than lawyers and doctors, who have similar 
amounts of education. The higher wages of lawyers and doctors compensate 
them for missing the intellectual and personal satisfaction that professors’ 
jobs offer. (Indeed, teaching economics is so much fun that it is surprising 
economics professors are paid anything at all!) 
20-1b Human Capital 
As the previous chapter discussed, an economy’s stock of equipment and structures 
is called capital. The capital stock includes the farmer’s tractor, the manufacturer’s 
factory, and the teacher’s chalkboard. The essence of capital is that it is a factor of 
production that itself has been produced. 
Another type of capital, though less tangible than physical capital, is just as 
important to the economy’s production: It is human capital, the accumulation of 
investments in people. The most important type of human capital is education. 
Like all forms of capital, education represents an expenditure of resources to raise 
future productivity. But this investment is tied to a specific person, and this linkage 
makes it human capital. 
Workers with more human capital earn more, on average, than those with less. 
College graduates in the United States, for example, earn almost twice as much as

those with only a high school diploma. This large difference has been documented 
around the world. The gap tends to be even larger in less developed countries, 
where educated workers are in scarce supply. 
From the perspective of supply and demand, it is easy to see why education raises 
wages. Firms—the demanders of labor—pay more for highly educated workers 
because these workers have higher marginal products. Workers—the suppliers of 
labor—Dbear the cost of education because they expect a reward for doing so. The dif￾ference in wages between highly educated workers and less educated workers may 
be considered a compensating differential for the cost of acquiring human capital. 
The Increasing Value of Skills 
“The rich get richer, and the poor get poorer.” Like many adages, this 
one is not always true, but it has been recently in the United States 
and many other nations. Numerous studies have documented that 
the earnings gap between workers with high skills and workers with low skills 
has increased substantially over the past several decades. 
Table 1 presents data on the average earnings of college graduates and of high 
school graduates without any additional education. These data show the increase 
in the financial reward from education. In 1974, a man with a college degree earned 
42 percent more on average than a man without one; by 2019, this figure had risen 
to 85 percent. Among women, the earnings gap between those with and without 
college degrees rose from 35 percent in 1974 to 78 percent in 2019. The incentive to 
stay in school today is large by historical standards. 
Why has the gap in earnings between skilled and unskilled workers widened? 
Economists have proposed two hypotheses, both of which suggest that the demand 
for skilled labor has risen relative to the demand for unskilled labor. The shift in 
demand has led to a corresponding change in the wages of both groups, increasing 
inequality. 
The first hypothesis focuses on international trade. Over the past half century, 
the amount of trade with other countries has markedly increased. As a percentage

20-1c¢ Ability, Effort, and Chance 
Why do major league baseball players earn more than those in the minor leagues? 
Certainly, the higher wage is not a compensating differential: Playing in the majors 
is hardly less pleasant than playing in the minors. Nor is human capital the key: 
The major leagues do not require more schooling or years of experience, though 
some training certainly helps. For the most part, players in the major leagues earn 
more simply because they have greater ability. 
Ability is important in all occupations. Because of heredity and upbringing, 
people differ in personal attributes. Some people are strong, others weak. Some 
people are smart, others dull. Some people are affable, others awkward. These 
and many other characteristics affect workers’ productivity and, therefore, their 
wages. 
glu&uly related to ability is effort. Some people work harder than others, and this 
extra effort makes them more productive, which usually leads to higher earnings. 
Sometimes, firms reward hard work directly by paying people based on what they 
produce. Salespeople, for instance, are often paid a percentage of the sales they 
make. At other times, hard work is rewarded less directly in the form of a higher 
annual salary or a bonus. 
But chance also plays a role in determining wages. Consider those who attended 
trade school to learn how to repair televisions with vacuum tubes and then found 
this skill made obsolete by the invention of solid-state electronics. They ended up 
earning a low wage compared with others with similar years of training. Or imagine 
what might happen to the future earnings of truck drivers if self-driving trucks are 
perfected. The decline in income experienced by these workers is due to random 
technological change. 
Chance also arises from accidents of birth. If you are born to a family with a high 
income and deep education, that good fortune gives you an advantage in life. If 
you are born into extreme poverty, with a severe disability, or in a neighborhood 
without good role models, that’s also a matter of chance.

How important are ability, effort, and chance in determining wages? These factors 
are hard to measure, but indirect evidence suggests that they are very important. 
When labor economists study wages, they relate a worker’s wage to those variables 
that can be measured, such as years of schooling, years of experience, age, and 
job characteristics. All these measured variables affect a worker's wage as theory 
predicts, but they account for less than half of the variation in wages in the U.S. 
economy. Because so much of the variation in wages is left unexplained, omitted 
variables—including ability, effort, and chance—must be important. 
The Benefits of Beauty 
People differ in many ways, one of which is physical attractiveness. 
The actor Gal Gadot, for instance, is a beautiful woman—indeed, 
she was once a beauty pageant winner. Her good looks help attract 
large audiences to her movies, and the large audiences mean a large income for 
Ms. Gadot. In 2020, she reportedly earned more than $30 million. 
Physical attractiveness is obviously useful for an actor, but how widespread are 
the economic benefits of beauty? The labor economists Daniel Hamermesh and Jeff 
Biddle addressed this question in a study published in the December 1994 issue of 
the American Economic Review. Hamermesh and Biddle examined data from surveys 
of people in the United States and Canada. The interviewers who conducted the 
surveys were asked to rate each respondent’s physical appearance. Hamermesh 
and Biddle then examined how much the wages of the respondents could be 
explained by the standard determinants—education, experience, and so on—and 
how much they depended on physical appearance. 
They found that beauty pays. People deemed more attractive than average earn 
5 percent more than people of average looks, and people of average looks earn 5 to 
10 percent more than people considered less attractive than average. Similar results 
were found for men and women. 
What explains these wage differences? There are several possible interpretations 
of the beauty premium. 
One is that good looks are a type of innate ability determining productivity and 
wages. Some people are born with the physical attributes of a movie star; others 
are not. Good looks are useful in any public-facing job—not just acting, but also 
modeling, sales, and waiting on tables. In this case, attractive workers are more 
valuable to the firm, and its willingness to pay a beauty premium reflects its cus￾tomers’ preferences. 
A second interpretation is that reported beauty is an indirect measure of other 
types of ability. How attractive a person appears depends on more than just hered￾ity. It also depends on dress, hairstyle, personal demeanor, and other attributes 
that a person can control. Perhaps a person who successfully projects an attractive 
image in a survey interview is more likely to be a talented person who succeeds at - % 
other tasks as well. Good looks pay. 
A third interpretation is that the beauty premium is a type of discrimination, a 
topic to which we will return. ®

20-1d An Alternative View of Education: Signaling 
Recall that the human-capital view of education holds that schooling makes work￾ers more productive. Some economists have proposed another theory, which says 
that firms use educational attainment as a way of sorting between high-ability and 
low-ability workers. According to this view, when people earn a college degree,

they don’t become more productive, but they do signal their high productivity to 
prospective employers. Because it is easier for high-ability people to earn a college 
degree than it is for low-ability people, more high-ability people get degrees. That 
makes it rational for firms to interpret a college degree as a signal of ability. 
The signaling theory of education is similar to the signaling theory of advertising 
discussed in Chapter 17. In the case of advertising, the advertisements themselves 
contain no real information, but firms signal the quality of their products to con￾sumers by their willingness to spend money on advertising. In the signaling theory 
of education, schooling has no real productivity benefit, but workers signal their 
innate productivity to employers by their willingness to spend years at school. In 
both cases, an action is being taken not for its intrinsic benefit but because the will￾ingness to take that action conveys private information to someone observing it. 
Both the human-capital theory and the signaling theory can explain why more 
educated workers tend to earn more than less educated ones. According to the 
human-capital view, education makes workers more productive; according to the 
signaling view, education is correlated with ability. But the two views have radi￾cally different predictions for policies that aim to increase educational attainment. 
According to the human-capital view, increasing educational levels for all workers 
would raise all workers’ productivity and wages. According to the signaling view, 
education does not enhance productivity, so raising all workers’ educational levels 
would not affect wages. 
Most likely, the truth lies somewhere between these two extremes. The benefits 
of education are probably a combination of the productivity-enhancing effects of 
human capital and the productivity-revealing effects of signaling. The relative size 
of these two effects is an open question. 
20-1e The Superstar Phenomenon 
Although most actors earn little and often take jobs as waiters to support themselves, 
Scarlett Johansson earns millions of dollars for each film she makes. Similarly, while 
most people who play tennis do it as a hobby, Daniil Medvedev earns millions on 
the pro tour. Johansson and Medvedev are superstars in their fields, and their great 
public appeal is reflected in astronomical incomes. 
Why do Johansson and Medvedev earn so much? It is not surprising that incomes 
differ within occupations. Good carpenters earn more than mediocre carpenters, 
and good plumbers carn more than mediocre plumbers. People vary in talent and 
effort, and these differences lead to differences in income. Yet the best carpenters 
and plumbers do not earn the fortunes that are common among, the best actors and 
athletes. What explains the difference? 
To understand the tremendous incomes of Johansson and Medvedev, consider 
the special features of the markets in which they sell their services. Superstars arise 
in markets with two characteristics: 
¢ Every customer in the market wants to enjoy the services supplied by the 
best producers. 
¢ The services are produced with a technology that makes it possible for the 
best producers to supply every customer at low cost. 
If Scarlett Johansson is one of the best actors around, then everyone will want to see 
her next movie; seeing twice as many movies by an actor half as appealing is not 
a good substitute. Moreover, it is possible for everyone to enjoy a performance by 
Scarlett Johansson. Because it is easy to make multiple copies of a film, Johansson

can provide her acting services to millions of people simultaneously. Similarly, 
because tennis matches are broadcast on television, millions of fans can enjoy the 
extraordinary skills of Daniil Medvedev. 
This logic shows why there are no superstar carpenters and plumbers. Other 
things being equal, everyone prefers to hire the best plumber, but a plumber, unlike 
a movie actor, can only work for a limited number of customers. Although the best 
plumber can command a somewhat higher wage than the average plumber, the 
average plumber can still earn a good living. 
20-1f Below-Equilibrium Wages: Monopsony 
Most often, economists analyze labor markets using the tools of supply and 
demand. The market is assumed to be competitive with many buyers and many 
sellers, each of whom has a negligible effect on the wage. Yet that assumption 
doesn’t always apply. 
Imagine that the labor market in a small town is dominated by a single, large 
employer. That employer can exert a large influence on the going wage, substan￾tially changing the outcome in the labor market. A market in which there is a single 
buyer is called a monopsony. 
A monopsony (a market with one buyer) is like a monopoly (a market with one 
seller). Recall from Chapter 16 that a monopoly produces less of the good than a com￾petitive firm would; by reducing the quantity offered for sale, the monopoly moves 
along the product’s demand curve, increasing the price and its profit. Similarly, a 
monopsony in a labor market hires fewer workers than a competitive firm would; 
by reducing the number of jobs available, the monopsony moves along the labor 
supply curve, reducing the wage it pays and increasing its profit. Both monopolists 
and monopsonists reduce economic activity in a market below the socially optimal 
level. In both cases, the existence of market power distorts the outcome and causes 
deadweight losses. Workers employed by monopsonies earn less than they would 
under competition. 
This book does not present the formal model of monopsony 
because true monopsonies are rare. In most labor markets, work- Ask the 
ers have many possible employers, and firms compete with one 
another to attract workers. In such cases, the model of supply and

of big tech companies and increase workers’ bargaining power. 
A growing problem, according to many economists, is the fre￾quent use of employment contracts with non-compete clauses, 
which bar employees from leaving to work for a competitor. 
While these agreements protect employers’ trade secrets, they 
also curb competition in the labor market, keeping wages below 
their equilibrium level. 
Monopsonies in a pure form are not common, but the tendency toward monop￾sony still bedevils some parts of the modern economy. The effects of monopsony 
power may help explain some workers’ wages.

Some economists worry that students 
who fell behind because of Covid 
restrictions may never catch up in 
their skills, job prospects, and income. 
The Long-Term Economic Costs 
of Lost Schooling 
By Jon Hilsenrath 
magine for a moment two objects in your hands. 
One is a piece of paper and the other a rubber 
band. If you squeeze your hands together hard 
and let go, the paper will remain crumpled, but 
the rubber band will return to its original shape. 
Economists tend to think of the economy 
a5 the rubber band. After a shock, they expect 
it to go back to normal. When it doesn’t, like 
the crumpled paper, they call the effect 
“hysteresis"—Ilasting changes caused by some 
large perturbation. The Covid-19 pandemic is 
a classic example. What permanent damage 
to the economy will it leave behind? 
The first place to look is in classrooms, say 
Eric Hanushek and Margaret Raymaond, econo￾mists and education researchers at Stanford 
University. Lost study time for children during 
the pandemic has the potential to do lasting 
harm not just to their own long-term prospects 
but to American prosperity in general, say the 
married couple. 
Ms. Raymond studied 18 states and 
Washington, D.C. and concluded that, on aver￾age, children lost 116 days of reading time 
during the early stages of the pandemic last 
year and 215 days of math work—instruction 
that will be hard to regain and could leave a 
whole generation of children struggling to keep 
up in their studies and testing. If your child 
misses out on learning fractions now, how will 
she perform in algebra later? 
And the shock has been distributed uneven￾ly. Children in rural areas and areas with large 
Black and Hispanic populations were hit the 
hardest. Among the states suffering the most 
are South Carolina and llinois, according to 
Ms. Raymond’s study. 
Economic output is a function of innovation, 
the skills that workers bring to their jobs and 
the machines that they use to create goods and 
services. Innovation and skills are shaped by edu￾cation. Over the next century, the skill shock of 
2020 will produce $25 trillion to $30 frillion of lost 
economic output in today's dellars, Mr. Hanushek 
estimates, and the lifetime household incomes 
of the affected students will be 6% to 9% lower. 
He came to this conclusion in part by exam￾ining the experience of German students. In 
1966 and 1967, the German government tem￾porarily shortened the school year in a rejigger￾ing of the school calendar. Longitudinal studies, 
he says, show that this lost class time reduced 
the incomes of that cohort of students by 5% 
over their lifetimes. Today’s students “are going 
to feel the long-term effects of Covid even when 
they are back in school,” Mr. Hanushek says. 
Economists borrowed the term hysteresis 
from the physics of magnetism. If you apply a 
large enough magnetic force to a metal object, 
the polarity of the object can be permanently 
transformed. It's the mechanism used, for 
20-1g Above-Equilibrium Wages: Minimum-Wage Laws, 
Unions, and Efficiency Wages 
While workers employed by a monopsony have wages below the level that would 
prevail in a competitive market equilibrium, other workers are paid above that 
level. Above-equilibrium wages can arise for three reasons. 
One reason is minimum-wage laws, as Chapter 6 discussed. Most workers in the 
economy are not affected by these laws because their equilibrium wages are well 
above the legal minimum. But for some workers, especially the least skilled and 
experienced, minimum-wage laws raise wages above the level they would earn in 
an unregulated labor market. 
A second reason that wages might rise above their equilibrium level is the 
market power of labor unions. A union is a worker association that bargains with 
employers over wages and working conditions. Unions often raise wages above 
the level that would prevail in their absence, perhaps because they can organize 
workers to withhold their labor by calling a strike. Sometimes, unions act as a 
countervailing power to offset the monopsonistic behavior of employers; other

instance, to create memory in a hard drive. In 
economics, hysteresis is typically associated 
with damage after shocks, though there can 
be positive transfarmations too, such as the 
development of vaccine technologies and work￾from-home options. 
For many years, economists have looked 
for evidence of hysteresis in labor markets. In 
Europe in the 1970s and 1980s, economists 
Olivier Blanchard and Lawrence Summers 
noticed that unemployment tended to increase 
during econoemic downturns, as expected, but 
didn't fully return to previous levels when the 
economy revived. The rubber band, in other 
words, didn't regain its shape. 
In a 1986 paper, "Hysteresis in Unemploy￾ment,” the professors surmised that this was 
because of structural problems in these markets. 
Unions tended to fight hard to keep their workers 
from losing jobs but did little to help them after 
they were released, making it hard for them to be 
re-employed. Labor protections encoded in the law 
had the same effect: Firms were reluctant to rehire 
after downtums because it was so hard to let go 
of people in a recession. “Shocks that we thought 
should be temporary had long-lasting effects,” Mr 
Blanchard said in a recent interview. 
Sourca: The Wall Streat dowrmal, Fabruary 27, 2071, 
Three decades later, Mr. Blanchard went 
back and looked at the problem of hyster￾esis in labor markets after the 2007-09 
financial crisis. Millions of Americans were 
experiencing long spells of unemployment. 
In 2010, nearly half of unemployed workers 
were without a job for at least six months, 
an astonishingly high number. In the half￾century before the crisis, just one of every 
eight unemployed workers, on average, went 
without work for that long. 
Mr. Blanchard and other economists worried 
about the lasting damage to people who sat on 
the sidelines of the job market and saw their 
skills deteriorate. Some stopped looking for work: 
others found income on federal disability rolls. As 
the expansion marched on, however, some were 
drawn back into the labor market., Mr, Blanchard, 
to his surprise, found evidence of hysteresis less 
compelling than he had expected. 
In the current economic crisis, policy mak￾ers in Washington are eager to drive the jobless 
rate down as fast as possible to reverse a new 
upsurge in long-term unemployment, It's ong 
reason why Treasury Secretary lanet Yellen—a 
labor economist—has called for Congress to 
“go big” on a relief package. 
Hysteresis may be acting on whole indus￾tries this time, Mr. Blanchard said. Air travel, 
commercial real estate and bricks-and-mortar 
retailing, for example, might never be the same. 
Like Mr. Hanushek and Ms. Raymond, Mr. 
Blanchard is most worried about the long-run 
effects of the Covid crisis on children and their 
future as workers. | would do everything | can 
to allow children to go safely back to school 
in person,” he said. Ms. Raymond said that it 
might be time to start thinking about sending 
children to summer school to make up for lost 
time. At the very least, she said, it is time for 
educators to start thinking about how to fix 
schooling once the pandemic ends. W 
Questions to Discuss 
1. Did you lose educational opportunities 
during the Covid pandemic? If so, do 
you think you subsequently caught up to 
where you otherwise would have been? 
2. How do you think educational systems 
can best compensate for lost opportuni￾ties due to the pandemic? 
times, they act more like monopolists, pricing their labor above the competitive 
level. Studies suggest that union workers earn about 10 to 20 percent more than 
similar, nonunion workers. 
A third reason for above-equilibrium wages is based on the theory of efficiency 
wages. This theory holds that high wages increase worker productivity by reducing 
turnover, mnhvatmg greater effort, and enticing superior candidates to apply for 
jobs. If these effects are strong enough, firms may find it profitable to pay wages 
above the equilibrium level. 
Above-equilibrium wages, whether caused by minimum-wage laws, unions, or 
efficiency wages, have similar effects on the labor market. In each case, setting a wage 
above the equilibrium level increases the quantity of labor supplied and reduces the 
quantity of labor demanded. That creates a surplus of labor, or unemployment. The 
study of unemployment is usually considered a topic within macroeconomics, which 
is beyond the scope of this chapter. But these issues can be important when analyzing 
earnings. Most ecarnings differences can be understood while assuming that wages 
balance supply and demand, but above-equilibrium wages play a role in some cases.

20-2 The Economics of Discrimination 
discrimination 
the offering of different 
opportunities to similar 
individuals who differ 
only by race, ethnicity, 
gender, age, religion, 
sexual orientation, 
or other personal 
characteristics 
Another source of differences in wages is discrimination. Discrimination occurs 
when people are offered or denied opportunities based on race, ethnicity, gender, 
age, religion, sexual orientation, or other personal characteristics. Discrimination in 
the workplace reflects broader prejudices in society. Economists study the problem 
to attain a better understanding of its magnitude and sources. 
20-2a Measuring Labor-Market Discrimination 
How much does discrimination in labor markets affect the earnings of different 
groups of workers? This question is important, but answering it precisely is not easy. 
There is no doubt that different groups of workers earn substantially different wages, 
as Table 2 shows. In 2019, the median Black man in the United States was paid 24 
percent less than the median White man, and the median Black woman was paid

16 percent less than the median White woman. The median White woman was paid 
19 percent less than the median White man, and the median Black woman was paid 10 
percent less than the median Black man. Taken at face value, these differentials look like 
incontrovertible evidence that employers discriminate against Black people and women. 
Yet there is a potential problem with this inference. Even in a labor market free of 
discrimination, different people have different wages. People differ in the amount 
of human capital they have and in the kinds of work they are able and willing to 
do. The wage differences in an economy are, to some extent, attributable to the 
determinants of equilibrium wages discussed in the preceding section. Simply 
observing differences in wages among broad groups—White and Black people, 
men and women—does not prove that employers discriminate. 
Consider the role of human capital. In 2019, among those aged 25 and older, 36 
percent of White Americans had a bachelor’s degree, compared with 26 percent 
of Black Americans. These educational differences explain some of the wage gap. 
And public schools in predominantly Black areas have historically been of lower 
quality—as measured by expenditure, class size, and so on—than public schools in 
predominantly White areas. If we could measure the quality as well as the quantity 
of education, the differences in human capital would likely appear even larger. 
Human capital acquired in the form of job experience also helps explain wage dif￾ferences. Women are more likely to interrupt their careers to raise children. Among the 
population aged 25 to 44 (when many people have children at home), 24 percent of 
women are out of the labor force, compared with 10 percent of men. As a result, female 
workers, especially at older ages, tend to have less job experience than male workers. 
Compensating differentials are another source of wage differences. Men and 
women do not always choose the same type of work. For example, women are more 
likely to be administrative assistants, and men are more likely to be truck drivers. 
The relative wages of administrative assistants and truck drivers depend in part 
on the working conditions of each job. Because these nonmonetary aspects are 
hard to measure, it is difficult to gauge the practical importance of compensating 
differentials in explaining observed wage differences. 
In the end, the study of wage differences among groups does not establish any 
clear conclusion about the prevalence of discrimination in U5, labor markets. Most 
economists believe that some degree of discrimination is at work, but it's hard to 
say precisely how much. The only certain conclusion is a negative one: Because the 
differences in average wages among groups in part reflect differences in human 
capital and job characteristics, they do not by themselves measure the extent of 
labor-market discrimination. 
Differences in human capital among groups of workers may, however, reflect a kind 
of discrimination. The less rigorous curriculums historically offered to female students, 
for instance, can be considered a discriminatory practice. Similarly, the inferior schools 
historically available to Black students may be traced to prejudice on the part of city 
councils and school boards. But this kind of discrimination occurs before workers enter 
the labor market. In this case, the disease is political, even if the symptom is economic. 
Is Emily More Employable Than Lakisha? 
Although gauging discrimination from labor-market outcomes is 
hard, compelling evidence for the existence of such discrimination 
comes from a creative field experiment. The economists Marianne 
Bertrand and Sendhil Mullainathan answered more than 1,300 help-wanted ads 
run in Boston and Chicago newspapers by sending in nearly 5,000 fake résumés. 
Half of the résumés had names that were common in the African American

community, such as Lakisha Washington or Jamal Jones. The other half had names 
that were more common among the White population, such as Emily Walsh and 
Greg Baker. Otherwise, the résumés were similar. The results of this experiment 
appeared in the American Economic Review in September 2004. 
The researchers found large differences in how employers responded to the two 
groups of résumés. Job applicants with White names received about 50 percent more 
calls from employers than those with African American names. The study found that 
this discrimination occurred for all types of employers, including those who claimed 
to be an “Equal Opportunity Employer” in their help-wanted ads. The researchers 
concluded that “racial discrimination is still a prominent feature of the labor market.” 
More recently, the economist Philip Oreopoulos has examined Canadian labor 
markets by sending out some fake résumés with English names and others with 
Indian, Pakistani, Chinese, and Greek names. Published in the American Economic 
Journal: Economic Policy in November 2011, the study again found significant evi￾dence of discrimination. English-sounding names received 39 percent more callbacks 
from employers. The differences were similar across the four ethnic groups. And the 
results were much the same if the fictional applicant had an English-sounding first 
name and a Chinese last name (such as James Liu or Amy Wang). When company 
recruiters were later asked about these findings, they tried to justify their behavior 
by saying that it is based on concern about language skills. Yet the discrimination 
occurred even when the applicant had a Canadian education and Canadian job expe￾rience, and there was no relationship between the advantage given to English names 
and the degree of language skills necessary for the type of job. 
“What's in a name?” Shakespeare wrote in Romeo and Juliet. Like the Montagues 
and Capulets, many employers fail to look beyond the names of the people they 
are evaluating. @ 
20-2b Discrimination by Employers 
Let’s now turn from measurement to the economic forces that lie behind discrimina￾tion in labor markets. If one group in society receives a lower wage than another, 
even after controlling for human capital and job characteristics, who is to blame? 
The answer may seem obvious: employers. They make the hiring decisions that 
determine labor demand and wages. If some groups of workers earn less than they 
should, then emplovers seem to be the natural culprits. Yet many economists are 
skeptical of this answer. They believe that competitive market economies provide 
a natural antidote to employer discrimination: the profit motive. 
Imagine an economy in which workers are differentiated only by hair color. In 
this simplified world, people are either blondes or brunettes. The two groups have 
the same skills, experience, and work ethic. Yet because of discrimination, emplovers 
prefer to hire brunettes, and this preference reduces the demand for blondes. This 
causes blondes to earn a lower wage than brunettes. 
This wage differential, however, won't last for long. Entrepreneurs will soon notice 
an easy way to beat the competition: hiring blonde workers. Doing so means lower 
labor costs and higher profits. Over time, more and more “blonde” firms enter the 
market to exploit this cost advantage. Because the “brunette” firms have higher costs, 
they start losing money when faced with the new competitors and eventually go out 
of business. The entry of blonde firms and the exit of brunette firms increases the 
demand for blonde workers and reduces the demand for brunette workers. These 
shifts in demand pull their wages closer together. The process continues until the 
economy reaches a new equilibrium without the discriminatory wage differential. 
Put simply, business owners who care only about making money are at an advan￾tage when competing against those who also care about discriminating. As a result,

firms that do not discriminate tend to replace those that do. In this way, competitive 
markets have a natural remedy for employer discrimination. 
Segregated Streetcars and the Profit Motive 
In the early 20th century, streetcars in many southern cities were 
segregated by race. White passengers sat in the front of the streetcars, 
and Black passengers sat in the back. The firms that ran the streetcars 
enforced this practice, but historical research shows that they didn't start it. 
In a 1986 article in the Journal of Economic History, the economic historian Jennifer 
Roback found that the segregation of races on streetcars resulted from laws that 
required segregation. Before these laws existed, racial discrimination in seating was 
rare. It was far more common to segregate smokers and nonsmokers. 
In fact, the firms that ran the streetcars often opposed the laws requiring racial 
segregation. Providing separate seating for different races raised the firms’ costs 
and reduced their profits. One railroad company manager complained to the city 
council that, under the segregation laws, “the company has to haul around a good 
deal of empty space.” 
Here is how Roback describes the situation in one southern city: 
The railroad company did not initiate the segregation policy and was not at all 
eager to abide by it. State legislation, public agitation, and a threat to arrest the 
president of the railroad were all required to induce them to separate the races 
on their cars. . . . There is no indication that the management was motivated 
by belief in civil rights or racial equality. The evidence indicates their primary 
motives were economic; separation was costly. . . . Officials of the company may 
or may not have disliked blacks, but they were not willing to forgo the profits 
necessary to indulge such prejudice. 
The story of southern streetcars illustrates a general lesson: Usually, business 
owners are most interested in making profits, not in discriminating against a par￾ticular group. When firms engage in discriminatory practices, the source of the 
discrimination often lies not with the firms themselves but elsewhere. In this case, 
the streetcar companies segregated White and Black people because discriminatory 
laws, which the companies opposed, required them to do so. @ 
20-2¢ Discrimination by Customers and Governments 
The profit motive acts to eliminate discriminatory wage differentials, but its cor￾rective abilities only go so far. Two limiting factors are customer preferences and 
government policies. 
To see how customer preferences for discrimination can affect wages, consider 
again the imaginary economy with blondes and brunettes. Suppose that restaurant 
owners discriminate against blondes when hiring waiters, so blonde waiters earn 
less than brunette waiters. In this case, an enterprising restaurant can open with 
blonde waiters and charge lower prices. If customers care only about the price and 
quality of meals, the discriminatory firms will be driven out of business, and the 
wage differential will disappear. 
But imagine that customers prefer being served by brunettes. If this discrimina￾tory preference is strong, the entry of blonde restaurants will not eliminate the wage 
differential. That is, if customers have discriminatory preferences, a competitive 
market may maintain a discriminatory wage differential. An economy with such 
discrimination would contain two types of restaurants. Blonde restaurants would 
have lower costs and charge lower prices. Brunette restaurants would have higher

costs and charge higher prices. Customers who did not care about the hair color 
of their waiters would be attracted to the lower prices at the blonde restaurants. 
Bigoted customers would go to the brunette restaurants and would pay for their 
discriminatory preference in the form of higher prices. 
Another way for discrimination to persist in competitive markets is for the 
government to require it. If, for instance, the government passed a law stating 
that blondes could wash dishes but not work as waiters, a wage differential could 
persist in a competitive market. The segregated streetcars in the previous case study 
are one example of government-mandated discrimination. Similarly, before South 
Africa abandoned the formal policy of racial segregation called apartheid in 1990, 
Black people were prohibited from working in some jobs. When discriminatory 
governments pass such laws, they suppress the equalizing force of competitive 
markets. 
To sum up: Competitive markets contain a natural remedy for employer dis￾crimination. The entry of firms that care only about profit tends to eliminate 
discriminatory wage differentials. These differentials persist in competitive mar￾kets when customers are willing to pay to maintain the discriminatory practice 
or when the government mandates it. 
Discrimination in Sports 
Measuring discrimination is often difficult. To determine whether a 
group of workers is discriminated against, a researcher must correct 
for differences in the productivity between that group and others in 
the economy. Yet in most firms, it is difficult to measure a worker’s contribution 
to the production of goods and services. 
Sports are something of an exception. Professional sports teams revel in objective 
measures of productivity. In basketball, for instance, statistics on players’ averages 
for scoring, assists, and rebounds are compiled instantancously and pored over 
by voracious fans. For economists, this extensive documentation amounts to a 
bonanza. 
Studies of sports teams suggest that racial discrimination has, in fact, been common 
and that much of the blame lies with customers. One study, published in the Journal 
of Labor Economics in 1988, examined the salaries of basketball players and found that 
Black players earned 20 percent less than White players of comparable ability. The 
study also found that attendance at basketball games was larger for teams with a 
greater proportion of White players. One interpretation of these facts is that, at least 
at the time of the study, customer discrimination made Black players less profitable 
than White players for team owners. In the presence of such customer discrimination, 
a discriminatory wage gap can persist, even if team owners care only about profit. 
A similar situation once existed for baseball players. A study using data from the 
late 1960s showed that Black players earned less than comparable White players. 
Moreover, fewer fans attended games pitched by Black pitchers than games pitched 
by White pitchers, even though Black pitchers had better records than White pitch￾ers. Studies of more recent salaries in baseball, however, have found no evidence of 
discriminatory wage differentials. 
Another study, published in the Quarterly Journal of Economics in 1990, exam￾ined the market prices of old baseball cards. This study found similar evidence of 
discrimination. The cards of Black hitters sold for 10 percent less than the cards of 
comparable White hitters, and the cards of Black pitchers sold for 13 percent less 
than the cards of comparable White pitchers. These results suggest customer dis￾crimination among baseball fans. @

20-2d Statistical Discrimination 
Beyond animosity toward particular groups, there is another possible cause of 
discrimination, called statistical discrimination. This theory assumes that employ￾ers have imperfect information about possible employees. If some relevant but 
unobservable employee characteristic happens to be correlated with an otherwise 
irrelevant but observable characteristic, employers may rely on the observable 
characteristic when making hiring decisions. 
Suppose that employers care about punctuality but don’t know whether a job 
applicant is likely to be punctual once hired. And suppose that employers have found 
that 10 percent of workers with blue eyes are chronically late, compared with only 
5 percent of workers with brown eyes. Because of this correlation, employers might 
prefer hiring brown-eyed workers, even if they do not otherwise care about eye 
color. Blue-eyed people as a group would suffer from discrimination, even though 
90 percent of them are punctual. The discrimination is “statistical” in the sense that 
each blue-eyed person is being stereotyped by the average behavior of the group. 
This example is silly (punctuality is not really related to eye color). But the same 
phenomenon arises in real cases. 
Some employers, for instance, prefer not to hire workers with criminal records. 
The simplest way to avoid doing so is to ask job applicants whether they have 
criminal records, and many employers do. Some states, however, have passed “ban 
the box” laws that prohibit employers from asking. (The “box” refers to the place 
on the job application that a person would check to signal a clean record.) The goal 
of these laws is to help ex-offenders find jobs and reenter society. 
Despite the noble intent of these laws, one unintended consequence is that they 
foster statistical discrimination. Statistics show that Black men are more likely to 
have served time in prison than White men. Some employers who are aware of this 
but are prohibited from asking about criminal records may avoid hiring Black men. 
As a result, Black men without a criminal past would suffer from discrimination 
because of their group’s average characteristics. Some studies have compared states 
with and without “ban the box” policies and have found that these laws significantly 
reduce employment for young Black men without college degrees. These results 
suggest that policymakers should look for ways to help ex-offenders that do not 
inadvertently increase statistical discrimination.

20-3 Conclusion 
In competitive markets, workers earn a wage equal to the value of their marginal 
contribution to the production of goods and services. But many things affect the 
value of the marginal product. Firms tend to pay more for workers who are talented, 
diligent, experienced, and educated because these workers are more productive. 
Firms are likely to pay less to those workers against whom customers discriminate 
because these workers contribute less to revenue. 
The theory of the labor market developed in the last two chapters explains why 
some workers earn higher wages than other workers. The theory does not say that 
the resulting distribution of income is necessarily equal, fair, or desirable in any 
way. The next chapter takes up that topic. 
Chapter in a Nutshell 
Workers earn different wages for many reasons. 
One is that wage differentials play a role in compen￾sating workers for jub attributes. Other things being 
equal, workers in hard, unpleasant jobs are paid 
more than workers in easy, pleasant jobs. 
Workers with more human capital are paid more than 
workers with less. The return to accumulating human 
capital is high and has increased over the past several 
decades. 
Years of education, experience, and job characteristics 
affect earnings in the way that theory predicts, but 
many differences in earnings cannot be explained by 
things that economists can easily measure. The unex￾plained variation in earnings is largely attributable to 
ability, effort, and chance. 
Some economists have suggested that more educated 
workers earn higher wages not because education 
raises productivity but because it signals to employers 
that these workers have high levels of ability. If this sig￾naling theory is correct, then increasing the educational 
attainment of all workers would not raise the overall 
level of wages. 
Wages are sometimes kept away from the level that 
balances supply and demand. An explanation for

below-equilibrium wages is the monopsony power 
of some employers. Three explanations for above￾equilibrium wages are minimum-wage laws, unions, 
and efficiency wages. 
Some differences in earnings are attributable to dis￾crimination based on race, gender, or other factors. 
Measuring the amount of discrimination is difficult 
because one must correct for differences in human 
capital and job characteristics. 
Competitive markets tend to limit discriminatory 
wage differences. If one group of workers earns less 
than another for reasons unrelated to productivity, 
then nondiscriminatory firms will be more profit￾able than discriminatory ones. Profit-seeking behav￾ior can, therefore, reduce discriminatory wage gaps. 
Still, discrimination persists in competitive markets 
if customers are willing to pay more to discrimina￾tory firms or if the government enacts laws that 
require firms to discriminate. 
Discrimination can also occur for statistical reasons. If 
employers have imperfect information about employ￾ees, they may discriminate against all members of a 
group whose average characteristics the employers 
find undesirable.

raising the worker's productivity? 
4. What conditions lead to highly compensated 
superstars? Would you expect to see superstars in

Problems and Applications 
1. College students sometimes work as summer interns 
for private firms or the government. Some of these 
positions pay little or nothing.

jobs. 
c. If you were to compare the earnings later in life 
of workers who had worked as interns and those 
who had taken summer jobs that paid more, what 
would you expect to find? 
2. As Chapter 6 explained, a minimum-wage law 
distorts the market for low-wage labor. To reduce this 
distortion, some economists advocate a two-tiered 
minimum-wage system, with a regular minimum 
wage for adult workers and a lower, “subminimum” 
wage for teenage workers. Give two reasons a single 
minimum wage might distort the labor market for 
teenage workers more than it would the market for 
adult workers. 
3. Abasic finding of labor economics is that workers 
who have more experience in the labor force are 
paid more than workers who have less experience 
{holding constant the amount of formal education). 
Why might this be so? Some studies have also found 
that experience at the same job has an extra positive 
influence on wages. Explain why this might occur. 
4. At some colleges and universities, economics 
professors receive higher salaries than professors in 
some other fields. 
a. Why might this be true?

Because labor earnings make up about two-thirds of all income in the 
U.5. economy, labor is the most important factor for determining households” stan￾dard of living. Labor supply and demand depend on ability, effort, human capital, 
compensating differentials, discrimination, and so on. For the most part, these 
things determine how much workers earn. But sometimes, because of minimum￾wage laws, unions, efficiency wages, and monopsony power, the payments to labor 
depart from their competitive equilibrium levels. All these diverse forces influence 
whether a person ends up rich, poor, or somewhere in between. 
The distribution of income raises fundamental questions about the economy 
and public policy. This chapter addresses the topic in three steps. First, we consider 
how inequality is measured and how great it is in the United States and around the 
world. Second, we examine different views about the role that government should 
play in altering the income distribution. Third, we discuss public policies aimed at 
helping those members of society most in need.

income, and the highest quintile earned 49.5 percent. Even though all the quintiles 
include the same number of families, the highest quintile had almost 13 times as 
much income as the lowest quintile. 
The last column shows the income share of the richest families. In 2019, the top 
5 percent of families earned 21.9 percent of all income, which was greater than the 
total income of the bottom 40 percent. 
Table 2 also shows the distribution of income in various years beginning in 1935. 
At first glance, the distribution appears stable. Over many decades, the lowest 
quintile has earned about 4 to 5 percent of income, while the highest quintile has 
earned about 40 to 50 percent of income. Closer inspection reveals some trends in 
the degree of inequality. From 1935 to 1970, the distribution gradually became more 
equal. The share of the lowest quintile rose from 4.1 to 5.4 percent, and the share of 
the highest quintile fell from 51.7 to 40.9 percent. In more recent years, this trend 
has reversed itself. From 1970 to 2019, the share of the lowest quintile fell from 
5.4 to 3.9 percent, and the share of the highest quintile rose from 40.9 to 49.5 percent. 
The previous chapter discussed some reasons for the recent rise in inequality. 
Increased trade with low-wage countries (such as China) and skill-biased technologi￾cal changes (such as robots) have tended to decrease the demand for unskilled labor 
and increase the demand for skilled labor. These shifts in demand have reduced the 
wages of unskilled workers relative to those of skilled workers, and the change in 
relative wages has increased inequality in family incomes. 
21-1b Inequality around the World 
How does inequality in the United States compare with that in other countries? This 
question is interesting, but answering it is problematic. Some countries don't have 
reliable data, and those that do collect it in different ways. Some measure individual 
incomes, others measure family incomes, and still others measure expenditure as a 
crude approximation of income. We can never be sure whether an observed differ￾ence in inequality reflects a true difference in the economies or merely a difference 
in the way data are collected.

business is organized as a partnership or @ corporation, and business 
owners can change that.) Nonetheless, the tax data may be the best lens 
to see into the lives of the super-rich. 
Two economists who have studied the U.S. tax data to gauge inequality 
are Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez. Here are some of their findings: 
ables 1 and 2 present some information about the affluent—the top 
20 percent and the top 5 percent of the income distribution. But what 
about the very rich, such as the tap | percent? Or the very, very rich, 
such as the top 0.01 percent? 
Standard data derived from the Current Population Survey are less 
reliable about the extremes of the income distribution. One problem is 
sample size. If the government surveys 60,000 households. it will get only 
600 households in the top 1 percent and only & households in the top 0.01 
percent. Another problem is that participation in the survey is voluntary. 
When approached by government data collectors, the rich may be more 
likely to say, “no thanks.” 
To study the super-rich, economists turn to income tax returns. Because 
everyone is subject to income taxes, the sample sizes are large, and non￾participation is not an option. Yet tax return data, while better in some 
ways, are worse in others. The tax code is designed to raise revenue, not 
to collect consistent data over time. As lawmakers revise the tax code, 
the incentives for people to receive and report income in any particular 
form can change. (For example, business income is especially important 
for the super-rich. How this income is reported depends on whether the

The bottom line: The increase in inequality over the past half century 
documented in Table 2 appears to be highly concentrated among the 
super-rich. | 
With this warning in mind, consider Figure 1, which compares inequality in two 
dozen major countries. The inequality measure used here is the quintile ratio, which 
is the income of the highest quintile divided by the income of the lowest quintile. 
The most equality is found in Pakistan and Sweden, where the highest quintile 
receives about 4.5 times as much income as the lowest quintile (though that rela￾tive equality occurs at a low level of average income in Pakistan and a high level 
of average income in Sweden). The least equality is found in South Africa, where 
the top group receives 28 times as much income as the bottom group. All countries 
have significant disparities between rich and poor, but the degree of inequality 
varies substantially. 
The United States has more inequality than most countries and much more than 
other economically advanced countries, such as Germany, France, and Japan. But 
it has a more equal income distribution than some developing countries, such as 
South Africa, Venezuela, and Brazil. The United States has about the same degree 
of inequality as China, the world’s most populous nation, which claims to prac￾poverty rate

A commonly cited gauge of the distribution of income is the poverty rate, which 
is the percentage of the population whose family income falls below an absolute 
level called the poverty line. The poverty line is set by the federal government at

roughly three times the cost of providing an adequate diet. This line depends on 
family size and adjusts every year to account for price changes. 
Consider the data for 2019. In that year, the median family in the United States 
had an income of $86,011, and the poverty line for a family with two adults and 
two children was $25,926. The poverty rate was 10.5 percent. In other words, 
10.5 percent of the U.S. population were living below the poverty line for their 
family size. 
Figure 2 shows the poverty rate since 1959, when the official data begin. You can 
see that the poverty rate fell from 22.4 percent in 1959 to 11.1 percent in 1973. This 
decline came as average income (adjusted for inflation) rose more than 50 percent. 
Because the poverty line is an absolute rather than a relative standard, more families 
tend to be pushed above the poverty line as economic growth pushes the entire 
income distribution upward. As President John F. Kennedy once put it, “a rising 
tide lifts all boats.” 
Since the early 1970s, however, the economy’s rising tide has left smaller boats 
behind. Despite continued growth in average income, the poverty rate has not sub￾stantially changed since 1973. This lack of progress in reducing poverty in recent 
decades is closely related to the increasing inequality shown in Table 2. While eco￾nomic growth has raised the income of the typical family, the increase in inequality 
has prevented the poorest families from sharing in this greater prosperity.

Poverty affects all groups within the population but not with equal frequency. 
Table 3 shows the poverty rates for several groups, and it reveals three striking facts: 
e Poverty is correlated with race. Blacks and Hispanics are more than twice as 
likely to live in poverty as Whites. 
¢ Poverty is correlated with age. Children are more likely than average to be mem￾bers of poor families, and older adults are less likely than average to be poor. 
¢ Poverty is correlated with family composition. Families headed by a single 
mother are about five times as likely to live in poverty as families headed by 
a married couple. 
These correlations have described American society for many years, and they show 
which people are most likely to be poor. These effects also work together: Children in 
Black and Hispanic female-headed households have especially high rates of poverty.

21-1d Problems in Measuring Inequality 
Data on the income distribution and poverty rate give some idea about the 
degree of inequality in American society, but their interpretation is not always 
straightforward. The data are based on annual family incomes. What most 
people care about, however, is not their incomes in a single year but their ability 
to maintain a good standard of living. For several reasons, data on the income 
distribution and the poverty rate give an incomplete picture of inequality in 
living standards. 
Taxes and In-Kind Transfers Standard measures of the income distribution 
and poverty rate are based on families’ pre-tax incomes. They don’t account for 
the greater taxes that high-income households typically pay and the tax credits 
that low-income households often receive. In particular, the earned income tax 
credit (discussed later in this chapter) gives cash payments to many low-wage 
workers. Because these payments are made through the income tax system, the 
incomes used to calculate the official poverty rate do not reflect the impact of this 
antipoverty program. 
This data problem was significant during the pandemic of 2020, when Congress 
enacted large programs to support household income while many businesses 
were temporarily closed. Some of the new payments, such as expanded unem￾ployment insurance, were included in the income measure used to calculate the 
poverty rate. But the so-called stimulus checks received by most families were 
excluded because they were administered through the tax system. As a result, 
the official poverty rate rose in 2020, though a statistic called the Supplemental 
Poverty Measure, which accounts for tax rebates such as the stimulus checks, 
showed a decline in poverty. 
Another problem with the data on the income distribution and the official poverty 
rate is that they are based on monetary incomes. Yet various government programs 
provide low-income households with nonmonetary items, such as free food, housing 
vouchers, and medical services. Transfers in the form of goods and services rather 
than cash are called in-kind transfers. The Supplemental Poverty Measure takes 
account of some of these in-kind transfers, but standard measures of inequality 
and poverty do not. 
The Economic Life Cycle Incomes vary predictably over most people’s lives. 
Yc:ung adults, ~\=:5pnec1:=1|ll],r those in school, often have low incomes. Incomes tend 
to rise as people gain maturity and experience in the workforce, peak at around 
age 50, and then fall sharply around age 65 when many people retire. This typical 
pattern of income variation is called the life cycle. 
Because people can borrow and save to smooth out life cycle changes in 
income, their standard of living in any year need not depend only on that year’s 
income. The young often borrow, perhaps to go to school or buy a house, and 
then repay these loans later as their incomes rise. People tend to have their high￾est saving rates when they are middle-aged. These savings can be drawn down 
in retirement, so the standard of living of older adults need not decline as much 
as their earnings. 
Most data sets lump together the incomes of college students, people in their 
prime working years, and retirees. Because of the common life cycle pattern, 
some of the inequality in annual income does not represent true inequality in 
living standards.

permanent income 
a person's normal income 
Transitory versus Permanent Income Incomes vary over people’s lives not only 
because of predictable life cycle variation but also because of random and transitory 
forces. One year, a frost kills off the Florida orange crop, and Florida orange growers 
see their incomes fall temporarily. At the same time, the Florida frost drives up the 
price of oranges, and California orange growers see their incomes temporarily rise. 
The next year, the reverse might happen. Or a pandemic may reduce the income 
of restaurant workers but increase the revenue of home-delivery pizza businesses. 
When public health is restored, the pattern shifts. 
Just as people can borrow and save to smooth out life cycle variations in income, 
they can also borrow and save to smooth out transitory variations in income. 
To the extent that a family saves in good years and borrows (or depletes its savings) 
in bad ones, transitory changes in income need not affect its standard of living. 
A family’s ability to buy goods and services would then depend on its permanent 
income, which is its normal, or average, income over several years. 
To gauge inequality of living standards, the distribution of permanent income 
may be more relevant than the distribution of annual income. Because permanent 
income is less affected by transitory events, it is more equally distributed than cur￾rent income. 
21-1e Economic Mobility 
IPeople sometimes speak of “the rich” and “the poor” as if these groups consisted 
of the same families year after year. But this is not the case. Economic mobility, 
the movement of people among income classes, is significant in the U.S. economy. 
Movements up the income ladder can be due to good luck or hard work, and 
movements down can be due to bad luck or laziness. Some of this mobility reflects 
transitory variations in income, while some reflects more persistent changes in 
income. 
Because family income changes over time, temporary poverty is more com￾mon than the poverty rate suggests, but persistent poverty is less common. In a 
typical 10-year period, about one in four families falls below the poverty line in 
at least one year. Yet fewer than 3 percent of families are poor for eight or more 
years. Because it is likely that the temporarily poor and the persistently poor face 
different problems, policies that aim to combat poverty often try to distinguish 
between these groups. 
Another way to gauge maobility is with the persistence of economic success from 
generation to generation. According to studies of this topic, having an above-average 
income tends to carry over from parents to children, but the persistence is far from 
perfect, indicating substantial mobility among income classes. If a father earns 
20 percent above his generation’s average income, his son will most likely earn 
§ percent above his generation’s average income. The correlation between the income 
of a grandfather and the income of his grandson is small. 
Because of this intergenerational economic mobility, the U.S. economy is filled 
with newly minted millionaires (as well as with heirs who have squandered the 
fortunes they inherited). According to one study, about four out of five millionaires 
made their money on their own rather than inheriting it. Often, they started and 
built a business or climbed the corporate ladder. 
Studies have documented that the degree of intergenerational mobility varies 
from country to country and that mobility is negatively correlated with inequal￾ity. Nations with greater inequality than the United States, such as Brazil, tend to 
have lower mobility. Nations with lower inequality than the United States, such

as Sweden, tend to have greater mobility. Whether these international differences 
mainly reflect disparities in populations, policies, institutions, culture, or other 
factors isn’t clear. 
A Lifetime Perspective on Income Inequality 
For the reasons we have discussed, the standard data on the 
income distribution can give a misleading picture about how much 
inequality there is. In a 2021 study titled “U.S. Inequality and Fiscal 
Progressivity,” the economists Alan Auerbach, Laurence Kotlikoff, and Darryl 
Koehler tried to correct for these problems. Rather than lumping all ages togeth￾er—college students, full-time workers, and retirees—they examined inequality 
within specific cohorts, such as those aged 40 to 49. In addition, they looked not 
at a single year’s income but at the total resources people have available to spend 
over their remaining years of life, which includes wealth, current income, and 
expected future income. And they accounted for taxes and transfer payments 
attributable to federal, state, and local government policies, including in-kind 
transfers. 
Here are their estimates of the distribution of lifetime resources for those aged 
40 to 49: 
¢ Lowest quintile: 6.6 percent 
¢ Second quintile: 9.8 percent 
e Middle quintile: 14.0 percent 
¢ Fourth quintile: 19.7 percent 
¢ Highest quintile: 49.8 percent 
* Top 5 percent: 244 percent 
¢ Top 1 percent: 11.8 percent 
Comparing these results with those in Table 2, you will see a large difference 
for the lowest quintile. The standard data show that the lowest quintile gets about 
4 percent of annual income, but these new data say that the lowest quintile gets 
6.6 percent of lifetime resources. At the other end of the distribution, while the 
data from income tax returns (discussed in the preceding FYI box) say that the top 
1 percent gets 18.3 percent of annual income, this research finds that the top 
1 percent gets 11.8 percent of lifetime resources. 
Recall that one measure of inequality is the quintile ratio, the ratio of the income 
of the highest 20 percent to that of the lowest 20 percent. This measure is about 12.5 
in the data on pre-tax annual income in Table 2 but only 7.5 in the data on lifetime 
resources. 
This research also quantifiecs how public policy—including both taxes and 
transfers—affects the distribution of lifetime resources. The highest quintile pays 
an average tax rate over their lifetimes of 31 percent, and the top 1 percent pays 
an average tax rate of 35 percent. The middle class, defined here as the middle 
quintile of lifetime resources, pays an average tax rate of 19 percent. But because of 
the earned income tax credit and other antipoverty programs, those in the lowest 
quintile face an average tax rate of negative 44 percent. The negative sign means 
that people in the lowest quintile receive more in government transfer payments 
than they pay in taxes. 
The bottom line: The United States has substantial inequality, but not as much as 
conventional measures indicate. @

utility 
a measure of satisfaction 
We have seen how the economy’s income is distributed and have considered some 
of the problems in interpreting measured inequality. This discussion was pesitive in 
the sense that it described the world as it is. We now turn to a normative question: 
What should society do about economic inequality? 
Economic analysis alone cannot answer this question. People’s differing views 
on it are largely a matter of political philosophy. Yet because the government's role 
in redistributing income is central to so many debates over economic policy, let’s 
digress from economic science and consider a bit of what political philosophers 
have to say. 
21-2a The Utilitarian Tradition 
One school of thought in political philosophy is utilitarianism, founded by Jeremy 
Bentham (1748-1832) and John Stuart Mill (1806-1873). To a large extent, utilitar￾ians aim to apply the logic of individual decision making to questions concerning 
morality and public policy. 
The starting point of utilitarianism is the notion of utility—the satisfaction that 
people receive from their circumstances. Utility is a measure of well-being and, 
according to utilitarians, the ultimate objective of all private and public actions. 
The proper goal of the government, they claim, is to achieve “the greatest good for 
the greatest number.” In more technical language, the goal is to maximize the sum 
of utility achieved by everyone in society. 
From this perspective, the case for redistributing income is based on the assump￾tion of diminishing marginal utility. That means, for example, that an extra dol￾lar of income increases the well-being of a poor person more than it increases the 
well-being of a rich person. Put another way, as a person's income rises, the extra 
utility from an additional dollar of income falls. This plausible assumption, together 
with the goal of maximizing total utility, implies that the government should take 
measures to make the distribution of income more equal. 
The argument is simple. Imagine that Peter and Paula are the same, except that

Peter to pay Paula will reduce Peter’s utility and raise Paula’s utility. But because 
of diminishing marginal utility, Peter’s utility falls by less than Paula’s utility rises. 
This redistribution increases total utility, which is the utilitarian’s objective. 
At first, this utilitarian argument might seem to imply that the government should 
continue redistributing income until everyone has the same income. And that would 
be the case if the total amount of income—$200,000 in this example—were fixed. 
But in fact, it is not. Utilitarians reject complete equalization of incomes because 
they acknowledge one of the Ten Principles of Economics from Chapter 1: People 
respond to incentives. 
To take from Peter to pay Paula, the government must pursue policies that 
redistribute income. The U.S. federal income tax and welfare system are examples. 
Under these policies, people with high incomes pay high taxes, and people with low 
incomes receive income transfers. These income transfers are phased out: As people 
earn more, they receive less from the government. Yet when Peter faces a higher 
income tax rate and Paula faces a system of phased-out transfers, both have less 
incentive to work hard because each gets to keep only a fraction of any additional 
earnings. But if they work less, society’s income falls, and so does total utility. The 
utilitarian government has to balance the gains from greater equality against the 
losses from distorted incentives. To maximize total utility, the government stops 
short of making society fully egalitarian. 
A famous parable sheds light on utilitarian logic. Imagine that Peter and Paula 
are thirsty travelers trapped at different places in the desert. Peter’s oasis has a 
lot of water; Paula’s has only a little. If the government could transfer water from 
one oasis to the other without cost, it would maximize total utility from water by 
equalizing the amount in the two places. But suppose that the government has only 
a leaky bucket. As it tries to move water from one place to the other, some water 
is lost in transit. In this case, a utilitarian government might still try to redistribute 
water from Peter to Paula, depending on Paula’s thirst and the bucket’s leak. But 
with only a leaky bucket at its disposal, a utilitarian government will stop short of 
trying to reach full equality. 
21-2b The Liberal Contractarian Tradition 
A second way of thinking about inequality might be called liberal contractarianism. 
An influential work in this school of thought is the book A Theory of Justice by the 
philosopher John Rawls (1921-2002). It is closely related to earlier work by the 
economists and Nobel laureates William Vickrey (1914-1996) and John Harsanyi 
(1920-2000). 
Rawls begins with the premise that a society’s institutions, laws, and policies 
should be just. He then addresses the natural question: How can we, the members 
of society, ever agree on what justice means? Everyone’s point of view is inevitably 
based on their own circumstances—whether they are talented or inept, diligent or 
lazy, educated or less educated, born to a wealthy family or a poor one, part of a 
privileged majority or an oppressed minority. Could any of us ever objectively 
determine what a just society would look like? 
To answer this question, Rawls proposes a thought experiment. Imagine that 
before any of us is born, we all get together in the beforelife (the pre-birth version 
of the afterlife) to discuss and agree on a contract for the rules that will govern soci￾ety. At this point, we don’t know the station in life each of us will end up filling. In 
Rawls's words, we are sitting in an “original position” behind a “veil of ignorance.” 
In this original position, Rawls argues, we can choose a just set of rules for society 
because we must consider how those rules will affect every person. As Rawls puts

it, “Since all are similarly situated and no one is able to design principles to favor 
his particular conditions, the principles of justice are the result of fair agreement 
or bargain.” 
Designing public policies and institutions in this way fosters objectivity about 
what policies are just. In many ways, this amounts to a formal, philosophical entreaty 
to abide by the Golden Rule, an ethic that has been found in many religions and 
cultures throughout history: Treat others as you would like others to treat you. 
When writing a social contract in the original position, you have no choice but to 
follow this rule because you don't know yet who yvou will be. 
In his book, Rawls considers what public policy designed behind this veil of 
ignorance would try to achieve. In particular, he considers what income distribution 
people would consider fair if they did not know whether they would end up at the 
top, bottom, or middle of the distribution. Rawls says that people in the original 
position would be chiefly concerned about the possibility of being at the bottom. 
When society designs public policies, therefore, the welfare of the worst-off person in 
society should be the main concern. Rather than maximizing the sum of everyone's 
utility as a utilitarian would, Rawls would strive to maximize the minimum utility. 
Rawls’s rule is called the maximin criterion. 
The maximin criterion emphasizes the lot of the least fortunate, but it does not 
lead to a completely egalitarian society. Like the utilitarians, Rawls recognizes that 
people respond to incentives. If the government promised to fully equalize incomes, 
people would have no incentive to work hard, society’s total income would fall sub￾stantially, and the least fortunate person would be worse off. The maximin criterion 
allows disparities in income if they improve incentives and thereby raise society’s 
ability to help the poor. But Rawls is not in complete agreement with the utilitarians: 
Because his philosophy puts weight on only the least fortunate members of society, 
it calls for more income redistribution than does utilitarianism. 
Rawls’s views are hotly debated, but his thought experiment has much appeal. 
It allows us to consider the redistribution of income as a form of social insurance. 
From the perspective of the original position behind the veil of ignorance, income 
redistribution is like an insurance contract. Homeowners buy fire insurance to pro￾tect themselves from the risk of their house burning down. Similarly, when we as a 
society choose policies that tax the rich to supplement the incomes of the poor, we 
are all insuring ourselves against the possibility of being members of poor families. 
Because people generally dislike risk, we should be happy to be born into a society 
that provides this insurance. 
Yet rational people behind the veil of ignorance might not be so risk averse that 
they would follow the maximin criterion. Instead, because people in the original 
position might end up anywhere in the distribution of outcomes, they might treat 
all possible outcomes equally when designing public policies. In this case, the best 
policy behind the veil of ignorance would be to maximize the average utility of 
members of society, and the resulting notion of justice would be more utilitarian 
than Rawlsian. 
21-2¢ The Libertarian Tradition 
Athird view of inequality is called libertarianism. The two views we have considered 
so far—utilitarianism and liberal contractarianism—both view the total income of 
society as a shared resource that a social planner can redistribute to achieve some 
social goal. By contrast, according to libertarians, society itself earns no income; only 
individuals do. In their view, the government has no grounds for taking from some 
individuals and giving to others to achieve any particular distribution of income.

For instance, the philosopher Robert Nozick (1938-2002) writes the following in 
his book Anarchy, State, and Utopia: 
We are not in the position of children who have been given portions of pie by 
someone who now makes last minute adjustments to rectify careless cutting. 
There is no central distribution, no person or group entitled to control all the 
resources, jointly deciding how they are to be doled out. What each person gets, 
he gets from others who give to him in exchange for something, or as a gift. In a 
free society, diverse persons control different resources, and new holdings arise 
out of the voluntary exchanges and actions of persons. 
While utilitarians and liberal contractarians try to judge what amount of inequality 
is desirable in society, Nozick denies the validity of this very question. 
The libertarian alternative to evaluating economic outcomes is to evaluate the 
process by which these outcomes arise. Libertarians agree with most everyone 
else that when the distribution of income is achieved unfairly—for instance, when 
one person steals from or defrauds another—the government should remedy the 
problem. But this school of thought says that if the process is just, the resulting 
distribution is fair, no matter how unequal. 
Nozick criticizes Rawls’s approach by drawing an analogy between the distribu￾tion of income in society and the distribution of grades in a course. Suppose you 
were asked to judge the fairness of the grades in the economics course you are now 
taking. Would you imagine yourself behind a veil of ignorance and choose a grade 
distribution without knowing the talents, efforts, and performance of each student? 
Or would you ensure that the process of assigning grades to students is fair with￾out regard for whether the resulting distribution is equal or unequal? For the case 
of grades, the libertarian emphasis on process over outcomes may be persuasive. 
Whether a similar logic applies to income is open to debate. 
Libertarians conclude that equality of opportunities is more important than equal￾ity of outcomes. They believe that the government should enforce individual rights 
to ensure that everyone has the same opportunity to use their talents and achieve 
success. Once these rules of the game are established and enforced, libertarians say, 
the government has no reason to alter the resulting distribution of income.

21-3 Policies to Reduce Poverty 
welfare 
government programs 
that supplement the 
incomes of the needy 
As we have just seen, political philosophers hold various views about income redis￾tribution. Political debate reflects a similar disagreement. Nonetheless, most people 
believe that, at the very least, society should try to help those most in need and that the 
government needs to step in when private charity fails. According to a popular meta￾phor, society should provide a “safety net” to prevent any citizen from falling too far. 
Poverty is a challenging problem. Families with low incomes are more likely than 
the overall population to experience homelessness, drug dependence, health prob￾lems, teenage pregnancy, illiteracy, unemployment, and low educational attainment. 
Members of these families are more likely both to commit crimes and to be victims 
of crimes. It is sometimes hard to distinguish the causes of poverty from the effects, 
but there is no doubt that poverty is associated with serious economic and social ills. 
Suppose that you were a policymaker in the government and your goal was 
to reduce the number of people living in poverty. What would you do? Here we 
examine some of the policy options. Each helps some people escape poverty, but 
none are perfect, and deciding on the best combination is not casy. 
21-3a Minimum-Wage Laws 
Laws setting a minimum wage that employers can pay workers are a perennial 
source of debate. Advocates view the minimum wage as a way of helping the 
working poor without any cost to the government. Critics view it as hurting those 
it is intended to help. 
The minimum wage is easily understood using the tools of supply and demand, 
as discussed in Chapter 6. For workers with low levels of skill and experience, a high 
minimum wage forces the wage above the level that balances supply and demand. 
That raises the cost of labor to firms and reduces the quantity of labor that those 
firms demand. The result is higher unemployment among those groups of workers 
affected by the minimum wage. Those workers who remain employed benefit from a 
higher wage, but those who might have been employed at a lower wage are worse off. 
The magnitude of these effects depends crucially on the elasticity of labor demand. 
Advocates of a high minimum wage argue that the demand for unskilled labor is 
relatively inelastic, so a high minimum wage depresses employment only slightly. 
Critics argue that labor demand is more elastic, especially in the long run when 
firms can adjust employment and production more fully. They also note that because 
many minimum-wage workers are teenagers from middle-class families, a high 
minimum wage is not well-targeted as a policy for helping the poor. 
21-3b Welfare 
One way for the government to raise the living standards of the poor is to supplement 
their incomes. The primary way the government does this is through the welfare sys￾tem. Welfare is a broad and imprecise term that encompasses a variety of programs. 
Tempaorary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) assists families with children and 
no adult able to support the family. Supplemental Security Income (SSI) helps people 
who have low incomes because of sickness or disability. For both programs, people 
cannot qualify for assistance simply by having limited financial resources. They must 
also establish some additional “need,” such as having small children or a disability. 
A common criticism of public assistance programs is that they create perverse 
incentives for those who might qualify. For example, it is said that these programs 
encourage families to break up (because many families qualify for financial assistance 
only if the father is absent) and encourage women to give birth out of wedlock (because

Ednonial review his deemed that sry suppressed coment does ot maierially affact tee overall learning expenience. Cengage Learning reserves the right o remewe addiional coment o any time if ssbseqeent nghts renmnctions require iChapter 21 
many poor single women qualify for assistance only if they have children). Because 
poor single mothers are such a large part of the poverty problem, these policies are 
said to exacerbate the very problems they are supposed to cure. Such arguments led 
to an overhaul of the welfare system in 1996 with a law that limited the amount of 
time recipients could stay on welfare. That change in policy remains controversial. 
Those who rebut these arguments and support more generous welfare point 
out that being a poor single mother on welfare is a difficult existence at best, and 
they do not believe that many people would choose such a life if it were not thrust 
upon them. Moreover, trends do not support the view that the decline of the two￾parent family is connected to public assistance programs. The reduction in public 
assistance benefits in 1996 did not lead to a decline in the percentage of children 
living with only one parent. 
21-3¢ Negative Income Tax 
When the government collects taxes, it affects the distribution of income. This is clear 
in the case of a progressive income tax: Families with higher incomes pay a larger 
percentage of their income in taxes than do families with lower incomes. As Chapter 
13 discussed, tax progressivity is a policy tool aimed at achieving vertical equity. 
Many economists have advocated helping low-income households with a 
negative income tax. According to this policy, a progressive income tax would 
include not just rising average tax rates but also subsidies for families at the bottom of 
the income distribution. In other words, these families would “pay” a “negative tax.” 
For example, suppose the government used the following formula to compute 
a family’s tax liability: 
Taxes owed = (1, of income) — $15,000 
In this case, a family that earned $180,000 would pay $45,000 in taxes, and a family 
that earned $90,000 would pay $15,000 in taxes. A family that earned 545,000 would 
owe nothing. And a family that earned $15,000 would “owe"” =$10,000. In other 
words, the government would send this family a check for $10,000. 
A negative income tax provides what is sometimes called a universal basic 
income. In this example, a family that earns nothing on its own would receive 
$15,000 from the government. This way, no family would have an after-tax income 
below $15,000. Such a system can be viewed as a proportional tax of one-third of 
income, along with a grant to all families of $15,000. 
Under a negative income tax, the only qualification required to receive govern￾ment assistance is a low income. Depending on one’s point of view, this feature 
can be either an advantage or a disadvantage. On the one hand, a negative income 
tax would establish a minimum standard of living for everyone, regardless of cir￾cumstance. On the other hand, a negative income tax would subsidize not only the 
unfortunate but also those who simply don’t want to work and are, in some people’s 
eyes, undeserving of public support. 
Some actual tax provisions work much like a negative income tax. One is the 
Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). This credit allows poor working families to receive 
income tax refunds greater than the taxes they paid during the year. Because the 
EITC applies only to the working poor, it does not discourage recipients from work￾ing as other antipoverty programs may. For the same reason, however, it also does 
not help alleviate poverty due to unemployment, sickness, or other inability to work. 
Another tax provision that works like a negative income tax is the child tax credit. 
In 2021, this credit was increased so families were eligible to receive $3,600 for every

child under age 6 and $3,000 for every child ages 6 to 17. Though the expanded child tax 
credit was passed as part of a pandemic relief bill and was scheduled to be temporary, 
PPresident Biden proposed making it permanent as a policy to reduce childhood poverty. 
21-3d In-Kind Transfers 
Another way to help low-income households is to provide them directly with some 
of the goods and services they need to raise their living standards. For example, 
charities provide the poor with food, clothing, shelter, and toys at Christmas. And the 
government gives poor families food through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance 
Program, or SNAP. This program, which replaced a similar one called food stamps, 
gives families a plastic card, like a debit card, that can be used to buy food at stores. 
The government also provides healthcare to many people with low income through 
a program called Medicaid. 
Is it better to help the poor with these in-kind transfers or with cash payments? 
There is no clear answer. 
Advocates of in-kind transfers say that such transfers are more reliable at helping 
those who are struggling. Among the poorest members of society, alcohol and drug

Temporary Pandemic Safety 
Net Drives Poverty to a 
Record Low m]ammfim 
W&shingtnn—The huge increase in govern￾ment aid prompted by the coronavirus 
pandemic will cut poverty nearly in half this 
year from prepandemic levels and push the 
share of Amencans in poverty to the lowest level 
on record, according to the most comprehensive 
analysis yet of a vast but tempaorary expansion 
of the safety net. 
The number of poor Americans is expected 
to fall by nearly 20 million fram 2018 levels, 
a decline of almost 45 percent, The country 
has never cut poverty so much in such a 
short period of time, and the development is 
especially notable since it defies economic 
headwinds—the economy has nearly seven 
million fewer jobs than it did before the 
pandemic. 
The extraordinary reduction in poverty 
has come at extraordinary cost, with annual 
spending on major programs projected to rise 
fourfold to more than $1 trillion. Yet without 
further expensive new measures, millions of 
families may find the escape from poverty brief. 
The three programs that cut poverty most— 
stimulus checks, increased food stamps and 
expanded unemployment insurance—have 
ended or are scheduled to soon revert to their 
prepandemic size. 
While poverty has fallen most among 
children, its retreat is remarkably broad: It 
has dropped among Americans wha are white, 
Black, Latino and Asian, and among Americans 
of every age group and residents of every state. 
“These are really large reductions in 
poverty—the largest short-term reductions 
we've seen,” said Laura Wheaton of the Urban 
Institute, who produced the estimate with her 
colleagues Linda Giannarelli and |Iham Dehry. 
The institute's simulation model is widely used 
by government agencies. The New York Times 
requested the analysis, which expanded on an 
earlier projection. 
The finding—that poverty plunged amid 
hard times at huge fiscal costs—comes at a 
moment of sharp debate about the future of 
the safety net. 
The Biden administration has started mak￾ing monthly payments to most families with 
children through an expansion of the child tax 
credit. Democrats want to make the yearlong 
effort permanent, which would reduce child 
poverty on a continuing basis by giving their 
families an income guarantes. 
Progressives said the new numbers vin￾dicated their contention that poverty levels 
reflected political choices and government 
programs could reduce economic need. 
“Wow—these are stunning findings,” said 
Bob Greenstein, a longtime proponent of safety 
net programs whao is now at the Brookings 
Institution. “The policy response since the start 
of the pandemic goes beyond anything we've 
ever done, and the antipoverty effect dwarfs 
what most of us thought was possible.” 
Conservatives say that pandemic-era 
spending is unsustainable and would harm

addiction are more common than in society as a whole. By providing food, shelter, 
and healthcare directly, society can be more confident that it is not supporting such 
addictions but instead providing what the recipients truly need. 
Advocates of cash payments say that in-kind transfers are inefficient and dis￾respectful. The government does not know what goods and services low-income 
households need most. Many of the poor are ordinary people down on their luck. 
Despite their misfortune, they are in the best position to decide how to raise their 
own living standards. Rather than giving people in-kind transfers of goods and 
services they may not want, it may be better to give them cash and allow them to 
buy what they think they need most. 
21-3e Antipoverty Programs and Work Incentives 
Policies aimed at combating poverty can sometimes have the unintended effect of 
discouraging people from escaping poverty on their own. For example, suppose that 
people need an income of $25,000 to maintain a minimally decent standard of living, 
and the government, out of concern for the less fortunate, guarantees everyone that 
Income Inequality and Poverty 437 
the poor in the long run, arguing that uncon￾ditional aid discourages work and marriage. 
The child tax credit offers families up to $300 
per child a month whether or not parents have 
jobs, which critics call a return to failed 
welfare policies. 
“There's no doubt that by shoveling trillions 
of dollars to the poor, you can reduce poverty,” 
said Robert Rector of the Heritage Foundation. 
“But that's nat efficient and it's not good for the 
poor because it produces social marginaliza￾tion. You want policies that encourage work 
and marriage, not undermine it.” 
Poverty rates had reached new lows before 
the pandemic, Mr. Rector added, under policies 
meant to discourage welfare and promote work. 
To understand how large the recent aid 
expansion has been, consider the experience 
of Kathryn Goodwin, a single mother of five 
in §t. Charles, Mo., who managed a group of 
trailer parks before the pandemic eliminated 
her $33,000 job. 
Without the pandemic-era expansions— 
passed in three rounds under both the Trump 
and Biden administrations—Ms. Goodwin's job 
loss would have caused her income to plunge to 
about $29,000 (in jobless benefits, food stamps 
and other aid), leaving her officially poor. 
Source: New Fork Timas, July 29, 2021. 
Instead, her income rose above its prepan￾demic level, though she has not worked for 
a year, She received about $25,000 in unem￾ployment benefits (about three times what she 
would have received before the pandemic) and 
$12,000 in stimulus checks. With increased 
tood stamp benefits and other help, her income 
grew to $67 000—almost 30 percent more than 
when she had a job. 
“Without that help, | literally don’t know 
how | would have survived,” she said. “We 
would have been homeless.” 
Still, Ms. Goodwin, 29, has mixed feelings 
about large payments with no stipulations. 
“In my case, yes, it was very beneficial," 
she said. But she said that other people she 
knew bought big TVs and her former boyfriend 
bought drugs. “All this free money enabled 
him to be a worse addict than he already 
was,” she said. “Why should taxpayers pay 
for that?" 
The Urban Institute’s projections show 
poverty falling to 7.7 percent this year 
from 13.9 percent in 2018. That decline, 
45 percent, is nearly three times the previous 
three-year record, according to historical esti￾mates by researchers at Columbia University. 
The projected drop in child poverty, to 
5.6 from 14.2 percent, amounts to a decline of 
61 percent. That exceads the previous 50 years 
combined, the Columbia figures show. ... 
Jessica Moore of 3t. Louis said the expand￾ed aid helped her make a fresh start. 
A single mother of three, Ms. Moore, 24, lost 
work as a banquet server at the pandemic's 
start but received enough in unemployment 
insurance and stimulus checks to buy a car 
and enroll in community college. She is study￾ing to become an emergency medical techni￾cian, which promises to raise her earnings 
50 percent. 
“When you lose your job, you don't expect 
benefits that are more than you were making,” 
she said. "It was a pure blessing." B

income. Whatever a person earns, the government makes up the difference between 
that income and $25,000. What effect would you expect this policy to have? 
The incentive effects of this policy are obvious: Anyone who would make less 
than $25,000 by working has little incentive to find and keep a job. For every dol￾lar a person would earn, the government would reduce the income supplement 
by a dollar. In effect, the government taxes 100 percent of additional earnings. An 
effective marginal tax rate of 100 percent is a policy with a large deadweight loss. 
This antipoverty program is hypothetical, but it is not entirely unrealistic. Welfare, 
Medicaid, SNAF, and the EITC are all programs aimed at helping those living in poverty, 
and they are all tied to income. As people’s incomes increase, they become ineligible 
for these programs. When all these programs are taken together, effective marginal 
tax rates can be very high, sometimes even exceeding 100 percent, so low-income 
households are worse off when they earn more. By trying to help the less fortunate, 
the government discourages people from working. According to critics of antipoverty 
programs, these programs alter work attitudes and create a “culture of poverty.” 
The problem of disincentives might seem to have an easy solution: Reduce ben￾efits to recipients more gradually as their incomes rise. For example, if people lase 
30 cents of benefits for every dollar they earn, they face an effective marginal tax 
rate of 30 percent. This effective tax reduces work effort to some extent, but it does 
nat eliminate the incentive to work completely. 
The drawback of this solution is that it greatly increases the cost of programs to 
combat poverty. If benefits are phased out gradually as a person’s income rises, then 
those just above the income threshold will also be eligible for substantial benefits. The 
more gradual the phase-out, the more people are eligible, and the more the program 
costs. Policymakers face a trade-off between burdening the poor with high effective 
marginal tax rates and burdening taxpayers with costly programs to reduce poverty. 
There are other ways to reduce the work disincentive of antipoverty pro￾grams. One is to require any person collecting benefits to be employed or accept a 
government-provided job—a system sometimes called workfare. But this approach 
raises the question of whether the government is the best institution to serve as the 
employer of last resort. Another possibility is to provide benefits for only a limited 
period. This route was taken in the 1996 welfare reform bill, which imposed a 
five-year lifetime limit on benefits for welfare recipients. When President Clinton 
signed the bill, he said that welfare should be “a second chance, not a way of life.” 
Yet cutting people off from benefits isn't a solution to poverty if they lack the skills 
needed to land well-paying jobs. That's why these issues are still with us, despite 
decades of efforts to solve them.

21-4 Conclusion 
People have long reflected on the distribution of income in society. Plato, the ancient 
Greek philosopher, said that in an ideal society, the highest income would be no 
more than four times the lowest. Measuring inequality is difficult, but it is clear 
that most nations around the world, especially the United States, have much more 
inequality than Plato recommended. 
One of the Ten Principles of Economics in Chapter 1 is that governments can 
sometimes improve market outcomes. This principle is important when consider￾ing the distribution of income. Even when the allocation of resources reached by 
the invisible hand is efficient, it is usually far from equal, and it is not necessarily 
fair. Yet there is no broad consensus about what fairness means or how much the 
government should redistribute income. Lawmakers often debate the progressivity 
of the tax code and the generosity of the social safety net. Economics alone cannot 
settle the disagreement. 
Two other of the Ten Principles of Economics in Chapter 1 are that people face 
trade-offs and that people respond to incentives. These principles are intertwined in 
discussions of economic inequality. When the government enacts policies to partly 
equalize incomes, it may distort incentives, alter behavior, and make the alloca￾tion of resources less efficient. As a result, policymakers face a trade-off between 
equality and efficiency. The more equally they slice the economic pie, the smaller it 
may become. This doesn’t mean that policymakers should necessarily refrain from 
income redistribution. But it does suggest that they approach redistributive policies 
aware of their potential costs. 
Chapter in a Nutshell 
= Data on the distribution of income show a wide dis￾parity in LS. society. The richest fifth of families earns 
contractarians (such as John Rawls) would determine 
the distribution of income as if we were behind a “veil 
more than twelve times as much as the poorest fifth. 
Because in-kind transfers, tax credits, the economic 
life cycle, transitory income, and economic mobility 
are so important for understanding variation in living 
standards, it is hard to gauge the degree of inequality 
in society using data on the distribution of income in 
a single year. When these other factors are considered, 
they tend to suggest that economic well-being is more 
equally distributed than annual income. 
Political philosophers differ in their views about 
the role of government in altering the distribution 
of income. Utilitarians (such as John Stuart Mill) 
would choose the distribution of income that maxi￾mizes the sum of utility of everyone in society. Liberal 
of ignorance” that prevented us from knowing our 
stations in life. Libertarians (such as Robert Nozick) 
would have the government enforce individual rights 
to ensure a fair process but then would not be con￾cerned about inequality in the resulting distribution 
of income. 
Various policies aim to help people with low income— 
minimum-wage laws, welfare, negative income taxes, 
and in-kind transfers. While these policies help allevi￾ate poverty, they can have unintended side effects. 
Because financial assistance declines as income rises, 
the poor often face very high effective marginal tax 
rates, which discourage them from escaping poverty 
on their own.

One of the Ten Principles of Economics in Chapter 1 is that people face trade￾offs. This principle is the essence of the theory of consumer choice. When consumers 
buy more of one good, they can afford less of other goods they want. When they 
spend more time enjoying leisure and less time working, they earn less and con￾sume less. When they spend more of their income now, they reduce their saving 
and have less to spend in the future. The theory of consumer choice examines how 
people facing these trade-offs make decisions and how they respond to changes in 
their environment. 
The theory is useful in analyzing a wide range of issues. After developing the 
basic framework, we ask: 
¢ Do all demand curves slope downward? 
How do wages affect labor supply? 
¢ How do interest rates affect household saving? 
These questions might seem unrelated, but the theory of consumer choice can help 
answer each of them. 
22-1 The Budget Constraint: What a Consumer Can Afford 
budget constraint 
the limit on the 
consumption bundles 
that a consumer can 
afford 
Other things being equal, most people would like to consume more—to drive nicer 
cars, wear trendier clothes, eat at better restaurants, or take grander vacations. People 
consume less than they desire because their spending is constrained, or limited, by 
their income. Our study of consumer choice begins with this constraint. 
22-1a Representing Consumption Opportunities in a Graph 
Consider Consuela, a consumer who buys only two goods: pizza and Pepsi. In the 
real world, people buy hundreds of different kinds of goods, and a diet of only 
pizza and Pepsi would not be healthy. But assuming only two goods simplifies the 
model without altering the basic insights about consumer choice. 
Consuela’s income is $1,000 per month, and because she is insatiable, she spends 
all of it on pizza and Pepsi. The price of a pizza is $10, and the price of a liter of 
Pepsi is $2. Her income and these market prices constrain her spending. 
The table in Figure 1 shows some of the combinations of pizza and Pepsi that 
Consuela can buy. The first row shows that if she spends all her income on pizza, 
she can eat 100 pizzas during the month, but she would not be able to buy any 
IPepsi at all. The second row shows another possible consumption bundle: 90 
pizzas and 50 liters of Pepsi. And so on. Each consumption bundle in the table 
costs exactly $1,000. 
The graph in Figure 1 illustrates the consumption bundles that Consuela can 
choose. The vertical axis measures the number of liters of Pepsi, and the horizontal 
axis measures the number of pizzas. Three points are marked on this figure. At point 
A, Consuela buys no Pepsi and consumes 100 pizzas. At point B, she buys no pizza 
and consumes 500 liters of Pepsi. At point C, she buys 50 pizzas and 250 liters of 
Pepsi. Point C, which is exactly at the middle of the line from A to B, is the point at 
which Consuela spends an equal amount ($500) on the two goods. These are only 
three of the many combinations of pizza and Pepsi that she can choose. All the 
points on the line from A to B are possible. This line, called the budget constraint, 
shows the consumption bundles that a consumer can afford. In this case, it shows 
the trade-off between pizza and Pepsi that Consuela faces.

The slope of the budget constraint measures the rate at which the consumer can 
trade one good for the other. Recall that the slope between two points is calculated 
as the change in the vertical distance divided by the change in the horizontal dis￾tance (“rise over run”). From point A to point B, the vertical distance is 500 liters, 
and the horizontal distance is 100 pizzas, so the slope is 5 liters per pizza. (Actually, 
because the budget constraint slopes downward, the slope is a negative number. 
But for our purposes, we can ignore the minus sign.) 
Notice that the slope of the budget constraint equals the relative price of the two 
goods—the price of one good compared with the price of the other. A pizza costs 
five times as much as a liter of Pepsi, so the opportunity cost of a pizza is 5 liters of 
Pepsi. The budget constraint’s slope of 5 reflects the trade-off the market is offering 
Consuela: 1 pizza for 5 liters of Pepsi. 
22-1b Shifts in the Budget Constraint 
The budget constraint shows the opportunities available to Consuela. It is drawn 
given her income and the prices of the two goods. If her income or the prices 
change, the budget constraint shifts. Consider three examples of how such a 
shift might occur. 
Suppose first that Consuela’s income increases from $1,000 to $2,000 while 
prices remain the same. With higher income, she can afford more of both goods. 
The increase in income shifts the budget constraint outward, as in panel (a) of 
Figure 2. Because the relative price of the two goods has not changed, the slope of 
the new budget constraint is the same as the slope of the initial budget constraint. 
That is, an increase in income leads to a parallel shift in the budget constraint.

445446 Part VIl Topics for Further Study 
Now suppose that the price of Pepsi falls from $2 to $1 while Consuela’s income 
remains at $1,000 and the price of pizza remains at $10. If she spends her entire 
income on pizza, the price of Pepsi is irrelevant. In this case, she can still buy only 
100 pizzas, so the point on the horizontal axis representing 100 pizzas and 0 liters 
of Pepsi stays the same. But as long as she is buying some Pepsi, the lower price 
of Pepsi expands her set of opportunities. The budget constraint shifts outward, as 
shown in panel (b) of Figure 2. The lower price allows her to buy the same amount 
of pizza as before and more Pepsi, the same amount of Pepsi as before and more 
pizza, or more of both goods. 
Because the slope reflects the relative price of pizza and Pepsi, it changes when 
the price of Pepsi falls. With the lower price of Pepsi, Consuela can now trade a 
pizza for 10 liters of Pepsi rather than 5. As a result, the new budget constraint 
is steeper. The expansion in her opportunities is represented by a rotational shift 
rather than a parallel shift. 
For the third example, suppose that the price of pizza falls from $10 to $5 while 
Consuela’s income remains at $1,000 and the price of Pepsi remains at $2. Once 
again, the lower price expands her set of opportunities and leads to a rotational 
outward shift in the budget constraint, as shown in panel (c) of Figure 2. Now, with 
the lower price of pizza, Consuela can trade a pizza for 2.5 liters of Pepsi rather 
than 5, and the budget constraint becomes flatter. 
Figure 2 shows what happens when a higher income or a lower price expands 
Consuela’s set of opportunities. The opposite occurs when a lower income or a higher 
price reduces her opportunities. The pictures look much the same as Figure 2, but 
Figure 2 In panel (a), an increase in the consumer’s income shifts the budget constraint outward.

Pepsi has changed.

with the direction of the arrows reversed. And when more than one change occurs 
at the same time, we can analyze the overall impact by graphing and comparing 
the initial and final budget constraints.

$2. He has income of $100. His budget constraint 
will shift inward if

22-2 Preferences: What a Consumer Wants 
The goal of this chapter is to understand how consumers make choices. The 
budget constraint is one piece of the analysis: It shows the combinations of goods 
that consumers can afford given their income and the prices of the goods. Their 
choices, however, depend not only on their budget constraint but also on their 
preferences. 
22-2a Representing Preferences with Indifference Curves 
Consuela’s preferences allow her to choose among different bundles of pizza and 
Pepsi. If you offer her two different bundles, she chooses the one that best suits 
her tastes. If the two bundles suit her tastes equally well, we say that Consuela is 
indifferent between the two bundles. 
Just as we have represented Consuela’s budget constraint graphically, we can 
also represent her preferences graphically. We do this with indifference curves. An 
indifference curve shows the various bundles of consumption that make a consumer 
equally happy. In this case, the indifference curves show the combinations of pizza 
and Pepsi with which Consuela is equally satisfied. 
Figure 3 shows two of Consuela’s many indifference curves. We can see that she 
is indifferent among combinations A, B, and C because they are all on the same 
curve. 5o if her consumption of pizza decreases, say, from point A to point B, her 
consumption of Pepsi must increase to keep her equally happy. If her consumption 
of pizza decreases again, from point B to point C, the amount of Pepsi consumed 
must increase yet again. 
The slope at any point on an indifference curve equals the rate at which Consuela 
is willing to substitute one good for the other. (The slope is negative, but we can 
ignore the minus sign.) This rate is called the marginal rate of substitution (MRS).

The Consumer's Preferences 
The consumer's preferences are represented with 
indifference curves, which show the combinations 
of pizza and Pepsi that make the consumer equally 
satisfied. Because the consumer prefers more of a good, 
points on a higher indifference curve (1) are preferred 
to points an a lower indifference curve (/,). The marginal 
rate of substitution { MRS) shows the rate at which the 
consumer is willing to trade Pepsi for pizza. It measures 
the guantity of Pepsi the consumer must receive in 
exchange for 1 pizza.

Because the indifference curves are not straight lines, the marginal rate of 
substitution is not the same at all points on a given indifference curve. The rate 
at which Consuela is willing to trade one good for the other depends on the 
quantities of the goods she is already consuming. In other words, the rate at 
which she is willing to trade pizza for Pepsi depends on whether she is hungrier 
or thirstier, and her hunger and thirst, in turn, depend on her current consump￾tion of pizza and Pepsi. 
Consuela is equally happy at all points on a given indifference curve, but she 
prefers some indifference curves to others. Because she prefers more consumption 
to less, higher indifference curves are preferred to lower ones. In Figure 3, any point 
on curve [, is preferred to any point on curve [,. 
Consuela’s set of indifference curves gives a complete ranking of her prefer￾ences. That is, we can use the indifference curves to rank any two bundles of 
goods. For example, the indifference curves tell us that Consuela prefers the 
bundle at point D to the bundle at point A because point D is on a higher indiffer￾ence curve than point A. (That may be obvious, however, because point D offers 
more of both goods.) The indifference curves also tell us that Consuela prefers 
the bundle at point D to the bundle at point C because point D is on a higher 
indifference curve. Even though point D has less Pepsi than point C, it has more 
than enough extra pizza to make her prefer it. By seeing which point is on the 
higher indifference curve, we can use the set of indifference curves to rank any 
combinations of pizza and Pepsi. 
22-2b Four Properties of Indifference Curves 
Because indifference curves represent a consumer’s preferences, their properties 
reflect those preferences. Here are four properties that describe most indifference 
curves: 
¢ Property 1: Higher indifference curves are preferred to lower ones. 
People usually prefer to consume more rather than less. This preference 
for greater quantities is reflected in the indifference curves. As Figure 3 
shows, higher indifference curves represent larger quantities of goods

The Impossibility of Intersecting Indifference Curves of Pepsi

indifference curves, the consumer would be equally C 
satisfied at points A, B, and C, even though point C has 
more of both goods than point A. A

than lower indifference curves. Thus, a consumer prefers being on higher 
indifference curves. 
¢ Property 2: Indifference curves slope downward. The slope of an indiffer￾ence curve reflects the rate at which a consumer is willing to substitute one 
good for the other. In most cases, the consumer likes both goods, so if the 
quantity of one good decreases, the quantity of the other good must increase 
for the consumer to be equally happy. For this reason, most indifference 
curves slope downward. 
¢ Property 3: Indifference curves do not cross. To see why this is true, 
suppose that two indifference curves did cross, as in Figure 4. Then, 
because point A is on the same indifference curve as point B, the two 
points would make the consumer equally happy. In addition, because 
point B is on the same indifference curve as point C, these two points 
would make the consumer equally happy. But this means that points A 
and C would also make the consumer equally happy, even though point 
C has more of both goods. This contradicts our assumption that the 
consumer always prefers more of both goods to less. Thus, indifference 
curves cannot cross. 
* Property 4: Indifference curves are bowed inward. The slope of an indif￾ference curve is the marginal rate of substitution—the rate at which the 
consumer will trade one good for the other. The marginal rate of substi￾tution (MRS) usually depends on the amount of each good being con￾sumed. Because people are more willing to trade away goods that they 
have in abundance and are less willing to trade away goods of which 
they have little, the indifference curves are bowed inward toward the 
graph’s origin. As an example, consider Figure 5. At point A, Consuela 
has a lot of Pepsi and only a little pizza, so she is hungry but not thirsty. 
To give up 1 pizza, she would have to receive 6 liters of Pepsi: The MRS 
is 6 liters of Pepsi per pizza. By contrast, at point B, Consuela has a little 
Pepsi and a lot of pizza, so she is thirsty but not hungry. At this point, 
she would be willing to give up 1 pizza to get 1 liter of Pepsi: The MRS is

Indifference curves are usually bowed

pizza and a |ot of Pepsi, s0 she requires 
a lot of extra Pepsi to induce her to 
give up one of the pizzas: The MES is 6 
liters of Pepsi per pizza. At point B, the 
consumer has a lot of pizza and a little

Pepsi to induce her to give up one of the

22-2¢ Two Extreme Examples of Indifference Curves 
The shape of an indifference curve reveals a consumer’s willingness to trade one 
good for the other. When the goods are easy to substitute for each other, the indiffer￾ence curves are less bowed; when the goods are hard to substitute, the indifference 
curves are very bowed. To see why, consider two extreme cases. 
Perfect Substitutes Suppose that someone offered you bundles of nickels and 
dimes. How would you rank the different bundles? 
One possibility is that you would care only about the total monetary value of 
each bundle. If so, you would always be willing to trade 2 nickels for 1 dime. Your 
marginal rate of substitution between nickels and dimes would be a fixed number: 
MRS = 2, regardless of the number of nickels and dimes in the bundle. 
We can represent these preferences for nickels and dimes with the indifference 
curves in panel (a) of Figure 6. Because the marginal rate of substitution is constant, 
the indifference curves are straight lines. In the case of straight indifference curves, 
the two goods are said to be perfect substitutes. 
Perfect Complements Suppose now that someone offered you bundles of shoes. 
Some of the shoes fit your left foot, others your right foot. How would you rank 
these different bundles? 
In this case, you might care only about how many pairs of shoes you have. Single 
shoes aren’t much good. So you would judge a bundle based on the number of

pairs you could assemble from it. A bundle of 5 left shoes and 7 right shoes yields 
only 5 pairs. 
The indifference curves in panel (b) of Figure 6 represent these preferences. A 
bundle with 5 left shoes and 7 right shoes is just as good as a bundle with 7 left 
shoes and 5 right shoes. And these are equivalent to a bundle with 5 of each. The 
indifference curves are right angles. In the case of right-angle indifference curves, 
the two goods are said to be perfect complements. perfect complements 
In the real world, most goods are neither perfect substitutes (like nickels and two goods with right￾dimes) nor perfect complements (like right and left shoes). Perfect substitutes and angle indifference curves 
perfect complements are extreme cases. They are introduced here not because they 
are common but because they illustrate how indifference curves reflect a consumer’s 
preferences. For most goods, the indifference curves are bowed inward, but not so

22-3 Optimization: What a Consumer Chooses 
Figure 7 
We now have the building blocks of the theory of consumer choice: the budget 
constraint (which shows what consumers can afford) and preferences {(which show 
what they want). Let’s put them together to see what consumers choose. 
22-3a The Consumer’s Optimal Choices 
Once again, consider Consuela, our pizza and Pepsi consumer. She would like to 
end up with the best bundle of pizza and Pepsi—the bundle that puts her on the 
highest possible indifference curve. But because Consuela’s income limits her spend￾ing, she must also end up on or below her budget constraint, which measures the 
total resources available to her. 
Figure 7 shows Consuela’s budget constraint and three of her indifference curves. 
The highest indifference curve that she can reach (I, in the figure) is the one that just 
barely touches her budget constraint. The point at which this indifference curve and 
the budget constraint touch is the optimum. Consuela would prefer point A, but 
she can’t afford that bundle of goods because it lies above her budget constraint. 
She can afford point B, but because that bundle of goods is on a lower indifference 
curve, it provides her with less satisfaction. The optimum represents the best bundle 
of pizza and Pepsi that Consuela can afford. 
At the optimum, the slope of the indifference curve equals the slope of the budget 
constraint. We say that the indifference curve is tangent to the budget constraint. 
The slope of the indifference curve is the marginal rate of substitution between pizza 
and Pepsi, and the slope of the budget constraint is the relative price of pizza and 
Pepsi. This leads to an important conclusion: The consumer chooses the quantities 
of the two goods so the marginal rate of substitution equals the relative price. 
Chapter 7 discussed how market prices reflect the marginal value that consumers 
place on goods. This analysis of consumer choice shows the same result in another 
way. In making her consumption choices, Consuela takes the relative price of the 
two goods as given and then chooses an optimum bundle of goods at which her 
marginal rate of substitution equals this relative price. The relative price is the rate 
at which the market is willing to trade one good for the other, while the marginal

Another common way to represent preferences is with the concept of 
utility. Utility is an abstract measure of the satisfaction or happiness that a 
consumer receives from a bundle of goods. Economists say that a consumer 
prefers one bundle of goods to another if it provides more utility than the other. 
Indifference curves and utility are closely related. Because the consumer 
prefers points on higher indifference curves, bundles of goods on higher indif￾Chapter 22 The Theory of Consurmer Choice 
Because the marginal rate of substitution equals the ratio of marginal 
utilities, we can write this condition for optimization as 
MU, MU, = P,IP,. 
Now rearrange this expression so it becomes 
MU 1P, = MU IF,. 
ference curves provide higher utility. Because the consumer is equally happy 
with all points on the same indifference curve, all these bundles provide the 
same utility. You can think of an indifference curve as an “equal-utility” curve. 
The marginal utility of any good is the increase in utility that the con￾sumer gets from an additional unit of it. Most goods are assumed to exhibit 
diminishing marginal utility: The more of the good the consumer already 
has, the lower the marginal utility provided by an extra unit of that good. 
The marginal rate of substitution between two goods depends on their 
marginal utilities. For example, if the marginal utility of good X is twice the 
marginal utility of good Y, then a person would need 2 units of ¥ to compensate 
for losing 1 unit of X, and the MRS equals 2. More generally, the marginal 
rate of substitution (and the slope of the indifference curve) equals the 
marginal utility of one good divided by the marginal ufility of the other good. 
Utility analysis provides another way to describe consumer optimization, 
Recall that, at the consumer's optimum, the marginal rate of substitution 
equals the ratio of prices. That is, 
MRS = PIP,. 
This equation has a simple interpretation: At the optimum, the marginal 
uility per dollar spent on good X equals the marginal utility per dol￾lar spent on good Y. If this equality did not hold, the consumer could 
increase her utility by spending less on the good that provided lower 
marginal utility per dollar and more on the good that provided higher 
marginal utility per dollar. 
When economists discuss consumer choice, they sometimes express 
the theory using different words. One economist might say that the 
consumer's goal is to maximize utility. Another economist might say 
that the consumer’s goal is to be on the highest possible indifference 
curve. The first economist would conclude that at the consumer’s opti￾mum, the marginal utility per dollar is the same for all goods, while 
the second would describe the optimum as the point at which the 
indifference curve is tangent to the budget constraint, These are two 
ways of saying the same thing. | 
rate of substitution is the rate at which the consumer is willing to trade one good 
for the other. At the optimum, Consuela’s valuation of the two goods (as measured 
by the marginal rate of substitution) equals the market’s valuation (as measured by 
the relative price). Put another way, when consumers optimize, the relative prices 
of goods in the marketplace reflect the relative value that consumers place on them. 
22-3b How Changes in Income Affect the Consumer’s Choices 
Let’'s now examine how Consuela’s consumption decision responds to changes 
in her income. To be specific, suppose her income increases. As we have seen, an 
increase in income leads to a parallel outward shift in the budget constraint, as in 
Figure 8. Because the relative price of the two goods has not changed, the slope of 
the new budget constraint is the same as the slope of the initial budget constraint. 
The expanded budget constraint allows Consuela to reach a higher indifference 
curve, reflecting a more desirable bundle of pizza and Pepsi. Given the shift in the 
budget constraint and Consuela’s preferences, her optimum moves from the point 
labeled “initial optimum" to the point labeled “new optimum.” 
In Figure 8, Consuela chooses to consume more Pepsi and more pizza. The logic 
of the model does not require increased consumption of both goods in response to 
increased income, but this situation is the most common. As Chapter 4 discussed, 
if consumers want more of a good when their incomes rise, economists call it a

Although most goods in the world are normal goods, some are inferior goods. An 
example is bus rides. As income increases, consumers are more likely to own cars 
or use Uber and less likely to ride the bus. Bus rides, therefore, are an inferior good. 
22-3¢ How Changes in Prices Affect the Consumer’s Choices 
Let's now use this model of consumer choice to consider how a change in the price 
of one of the goods alters Consuela’s choices. 
Suppose that the price of Pepsi falls. As noted earlier, a fall in the price of 
either good shifts the budget constraint outward and, by changing the relative 
price of the two goods, changes the slope of the budget constraint as well. 
Figure 10 shows how the fall in the price of Pepsi rotates the budget constraint 
and changes the optimum. 
How such a change in the budget constraint alters the quantities of the two goods 
purchased depends on Consuela’s preferences. For the indifference curves in this 
figure, she buys more Pepsi and less pizza. But it takes only a little creativity to draw 
indifference curves with other outcomes. A consumer could plausibly respond to 
the lower price of Pepsi by buying more of both goods. 
22-3d Income and Substitution Effects 
The impact of a change in the price of a good on the quantities purchased can be 
decomposed into two effects: an income effect and a substitution effect. When 
consumers respond to a price change, both effects are at work. 
To see what these effects are, consider how Consuela might respond when she 
learns that the price of Pepsi has fallen. Two thoughts may occur to her: 
¢ “Great news! Now that Pepsi is cheaper, my income has greater purchasing 
power. 1 am, in effect, richer than 1 was. Because I am richer, 1 can buy both 
more pizza and more Pepsi.” (This is the income effect.) 
Figure 10 Iluanfit]_r 
A Change in Price of Pepsi 
When the price of Pepsi falls, 
the consumer’s budget constraint 
shifts outward and changes slope. 
The consumer moves from 
the initial optimum to the new 
optimum, which changes her 
purchases of both pizza and Pepsi. 
In this case, the quantity of Pepsi 
consumed rises, and the guantity 
of pizza consumed falls.

* “With the lower price of Pepsi, | get more liters of Pepsi for every pizza that 
I give up. Because pizza is now relatively more expensive, I should buy less 
pizza and more Pepsi.” (This is the substitution effect.) 
Both statements make sense. The decrease in the price of Pepsi makes Consuela 
better off. If pizza and Pepsi are both normal goods, she will want to spread this 
increase in her purchasing power over both goods. This income effect tends to make 
her buy more pizza and more Pepsi. Yet at the same time, the opportunity cost of 
pizza (in terms of forgone Pepsi) has risen, and the opportunity cost of Pepsi (in 
terms of forgone pizza) has fallen. This substitution effect tends to make Consuela 
choose less pizza and more Pepsi. 
Now consider the result of these two effects occurring at the same time. Consuela 
certainly buys more Pepsi because the income and substitution effects both act to 
increase the consumption of Pepsi. But for pizza, the income and substitution effects 
push in opposite directions. As a result, it is not clear whether Consuela buys more 
pizza or less. The outcome could go either way, depending on the sizes of the income 
and substitution effects. Table 1 summarizes these conclusions. 
The income and substitution effects can be interpreted using indifference curves. 
The income effect is the change in consumption that results from the movement 
to a new indifference curve. The substitution effect is the change in consumption 
that results from moving to a new point on the same indifference curve with a 
different marginal rate of substitution. 
Figure 11 shows how to decompose the change in Consuela’s decision into the 
income effect and the substitution effect. When the price of Pepsi falls, she moves 
from the initial optimum, point A, to the new optimum, point C. We can imagine this 
change as occurring in two steps. First, Consuela moves along the initial indifference 
curve, I, from point A to point B. She is equally happy at these two points, but at point 
B, the marginal rate of substitution reflects the new relative price. (The dashed line 
through point B is parallel to the new budget constraint and reflects the new relative 
price.) Next, Consuela shifts to the higher indifference curve, 1,, by moving from point 
B to point C. Even though point B and point C are on different indifference curves, 
they have the same marginal rate of substitution. That is, the slope of the indifference 
curve [ at point B equals the slope of the indifference curve I, at point C.

Consuela never actually chooses point B, but this hypothetical point is useful 
to clarify the two effects that determine her decision. The change from point A to 
point B represents a pure change in the marginal rate of substitution without any 
change in Consuela’s welfare. And the change from point B to point C represents 
a pure change in welfare without any change in the marginal rate of substitution. 
The movement from A to B shows the substitution effect, and the movement from 
B to C shows the income effect. 
22-3e Deriving the Demand Curve 
A consumer'’s demand curve for any good shows the quantity demanded at any 
price. In essence, it summarizes the optimal decisions that arise from the consumer’s 
budget constraint and preferences. 
For example, Figure 12 considers Consuela’s demand for Pepsi. Panel (a) shows 
that when the price of a liter falls from $2 to $1, her budget constraint shifts out￾ward. Because of both income and substitution effects, she increases her purchases 
of Pepsi from 250 to 750 liters. Panel (b) shows the demand curve that results from 
these decisions. In this way, the theory of consumer choice provides the theoretical 
foundation for an individual’'s demand curve. 
It may be comforting to know that the demand curve arises naturally from the 
theory of consumer choice, but this exercise by itself does not justify developing 
the theory. There is no need for a rigorous analytic framework just to establish that 
people respond to price changes. The theory of consumer choice is, however, useful 
in studying various decisions that people make as they go about their lives, as we 
see in the next section.

22-4 Three Applications 
Now that we have developed the basic theory of consumer choice, let's use it to 
shed light on three questions about how the economy works. 
22-4a Do All Demand Curves Slope Downward? 
Normally, when the price of a good rises, people buy less of it. This typical behavior, 
called the law of demand, is reflected in the downward slope of the demand curve.

As a matter of economic theory, however, demand curves can sometimes 
slope upward. In other words, consumers can sometimes violate the law of 
demand and buy more of a good when the price rises. To see how this can 
happen, consider Figure 13. In this example, Conrad the consumer buys two 
goods: meat and potatoes. Initially, his budget constraint is the line from point 
A to point B, and the optimum is point C. When the price of potatoes rises, 
his budget constraint shifts inward and is now the line from point A to point 
D. His optimum moves to point E. An increase in the price of potatoes leads 
Conrad to buy more potatoes. 
Why does Conrad respond in this strange way? In this example, meat is a normal 
good, but potatoes are a strongly inferior good. That is, potatoes are a good that 
Conrad buys a lot less of when his income rises and a lot more of when his income 
falls. In Figure 13, the increase in the price of potatoes makes Conrad poorer in the 
sense that he moves to a lower indifference curve. Because he is poorer, the income 
effect makes him want to buy less meat (the normal good) and more potatoes (the 
inferior good). At the same time, because potatoes have become more expensive 
relative to meat, the substitution effect makes Conrad want to buy more meat and 
fewer potatoes. Note that the income and substitution effects push in opposite 
directions. If the income effect is larger than the substitution effect, as it is in this 
example, Conrad responds to the higher price of potatoes by buying less meat and 
more potatoes. 
Economists use the term Giffen good to describe a good that violates the law of 
demand. The term is named for the economist Robert Giffen (1837-1910), who first 
noted this possibility. In this example, potatoes are a Giffen good. Giffen goods are 
inferior goods for which the income effect dominates the substitution effect. They 
therefore have demand curves that slope upward.

In this example, when the price B / 
of potatoes rises, the consumer's 
optimum shifts from point C to 
point E. In this case, the consumer 
responds to the higher price of 
potatoes by buying less meat and 
more potatoes.

The Search for Giffen Goods 
Have any actual Giffen goods ever been observed? Some historians 
suggest that potatoes were a Giffen good during the Irish potato fam￾ine of the 19th century. Potatoes were such a large part of people’s diet 
that when the price of potatoes rose, the change had a large income effect. People 
responded to their reduced living standard by cutting back on the luxury of meat 
and buying more of the staple food of potatoes. Thus, it is sometimes argued that 
a higher price of potatoes actually raised the quantity of potatoes demanded. 
A study by Robert Jensen and Nolan Miller, published in the American Economic 
Review in 2008, produced more concrete evidence for the existence of Giffen goods. 
These two economists conducted a field experiment for five months in the Chinese 
province of Hunan. They gave randomly selected households vouchers that sub￾sidized the purchase of rice, a staple in local diets, and used surveys to measure 
how the consumption of rice responded to changes in the price. They found strong 
evidence that many poor households exhibited Giffen behavior. Lowering the 
price of rice with the subsidy voucher caused these households to reduce their rice 
consumption, and removing the subsidy had the opposite effect. Jensen and Miller 
wrote, “To the best of our knowledge, this is the first rigorous empirical evidence 
of Giffen behavior.” 
Thus, the theory of consumer choice allows demand curves to slope upward, 
and sometimes that strange phenomenon actually occurs. As a result, the law of 
demand introduced in Chapter 4 is not completely reliable. It is safe to say, how￾ever, that Giffen goods are rare. ® 
22-4b How Do Wages Affect Labor Supply? 
The theory of consumer choice can be used to analyze not only how people allocate 
their income but also how they allocate their time. Most people spend some of their 
time on leisurely pursuits and some of it working so they can afford to buy goods 
and services to consume. The essence of the time-allocation problem is the trade-off 
between leisure and consumption. 
Consider Jasmine, a freelance software designer. She is awake for 100 hours 
per week. She spends some of this time enjoying leisure—playing Minecraft, 
watching The Bachelor, and reading this textbook. She spends the rest of this time 
developing software. For every hour she works coding, she earns $50, which 
she spends on rent, food, music downloads, and other consumption goods. Her 
hourly wage of $50 reflects the trade-off Jasmine faces between leisure and con￾sumption. For every hour of leisure she gives up, she works one more hour and 
gets $50 of consumption. 
Figure 14 shows Jasmine’s budget constraint. If she spends all 100 hours enjoy￾ing leisure, she has no consumption. If she spends all 100 hours working, she has a 
weekly consumption of $5,000 but no time for leisure. If she works a 40-hour week, 
she enjoys 60 hours of leisure and has a weekly consumption of $2,000. 
Figure 14 uses indifference curves to represent Jasmine’s preferences for consump￾tion and leisure. Here, consumption and leisure are the two “goods” between which 
Jasmine chooses. Because Jasmine always prefers more leisure and more consump￾tion, she prefers points on higher indifference curves to points on lower ones. At a 
wage of 550 per hour, Jasmine chooses a combination of consumption and leisure 
represented by the point labeled “optimum.” The optimum is the point on the bud￾get constraint at which Jasmine reaches the highest possible indifference curve, I,. 
Now consider what happens when Jasmine’s wage increases from $50 to $60 
per hour. Figure 15 illustrates two possible outcomes. In both cases, the budget

The Work-Leisure Decision

and leisure, and her optimum.

constraint, shown in the left graphs, shifts outward from BC, to BC,. In the process, 
each budget constraint becomes steeper, reflecting the change in relative price: At 
the higher wage, Jasmine earns more consumption for every hour of leisure that 
she gives up. 
Jasmine's preferences, as represented by her indifference curves, determine how 
her choice regarding consumption and leisure responds to the higher wage. In both 
panels, consumption rises. Yet the responses of leisure to the wage change are differ￾ent in the two cases. In panel (a), Jasmine responds to the higher wage by enjoying 
less leisure. In panel (b), Jasmine responds by enjoying more leisure. 
Jasmine’s decision between leisure and consumption determines her supply 
of labor because the more leisure she enjoys, the less time she has left to work. In 
cach panel of Figure 15, the right graph shows the labor-supply curve implied by 
Jasmine’s decision. In panel (a), a higher wage induces Jasmine to enjoy less leisure 
and work more, so the labor-supply curve slopes upward. In panel (b), a higher 
wage induces Jasmine to enjoy more leisure and work less, so the labor-supply 
curve slopes “backward.” 
At first, the backward-sloping labor-supply curve is puzzling. Why would a per￾son respond to a higher wage by working less? The answer comes from considering 
the income and substitution effects of a higher wage. 
Consider first the substitution effect. When Jasmine’s wage rises, leisure becomes 
more expensive relative to consumption, encouraging Jasmine to substitute away 
from leisure and toward consumption. In other words, the substitution effect induces 
Jasmine to work more in response to higher wages and tends to make the labor￾supply curve slope upward. 
Now consider the income effect. When Jasmine’s wage rises, she moves to a 
higher indifference curve, so she is better off than before. As long as consumption 
and leisure are both normal goods, Jasmine will want to use her increased well￾being to enjoy both higher consumption and more leisure. In other words, the 
income effect induces her to work less and thus tends to make the labor-supply 
curve slope backward.

An Increase in the Wage constraint, BC,, as well as the consumer’s optimal choices over consumption and leisure. The 
graphs on the right show the resulting labor-supply curve. Because hours worked equal the total 
hours available minus hours of |eisure, any change in leisure implies an opposite change in the 
quantity of labor supplied. In panel (a), when the wage rises, consumption rises, and leisure 
falls, resulting in a labor-supply curve that slopes upward. In panel (b), when the wage rises, 
both consumption and leisure rise, resulting in a labor-supply curve that slopes backward,

In the end, economic theory does not give a clear prediction about whether an 
increase in the wage induces Jasmine to work more or less. If the substitution effect 
exceeds the income effect, she works more. If the income effect exceeds the sub￾stitution effect, she works less. The labor-supply curve, therefore, could be either 
upward- or backward-sloping.

Figure 16 g Wage 
A Backward-Bending Labor-Supply Curve 
Here, the labor-supply curve slopes upward at low wages 
because the substitution effect dominates the income effect. 
But as the wage rises, the income effect starts to dominate 
the substitution effect, and the labor-supply curve bends 
backward. 
0 
Moreover, the slope of the labor-supply curve need not be the same at all wages. 
For example, depending on a person’s preferences, it is possible for the substitution 
effect to dominate the income effect at low wages and the income effect to dominate 
the substitution effect at high wages. In this case, as in Figure 16, the labor-supply 
curve starts off upward-sloping but then bends backward as the wage increases. 
Income Effects on Labor Supply: Historical Trends, 
Lottery Winners, and the Carnegie Conjecture 
The idea of a backward-sloping labor-supply curve is not a mere 
theoretical curiosity. Evidence indicates that the labor-supply curve, 
considered over long periods, does indeed slope backward. A hundred years ago, 
many people worked six days a week. Today, five-day workweeks are the norm. 
While the length of the workweek has been falling, the wage of the typical worker 
(adjusted for inflation) has been rising. 
Here is how economists explain this historical pattern: Over time, advances 
in technology increase workers’ productivity and the demand for labor. This 
increase in labor demand raises equilibrium wages. As wages rise, so does 
the reward for working. Yet rather than responding to this increased incentive 
by working more, most workers take advantage of their greater prosperity by 
increasing leisure. In other words, the income effect of higher wages dominates 
the substitution effect. 
Further evidence for a strong income effect on labor supply comes from a very 
different kind of data: winners of lotteries. Winners of large lottery prizes see large 
increases in their incomes and, as a result, large outward shifts in their budget con￾straints. Because the winners’ wages have not changed, however, the slopes of their 
budget constraints remain the same. There is, therefore, no substitution effect. By 
comparing lottery winners with those who played the lottery but lost, researchers 
can isolate the income effect on labor supply. 
A 2021 study by four University of Chicago economists did exactly that 
and found some striking results. For every dollar that people win, their total 
after-tax labor earnings decline by 40 cents. In other words, 40 percent of

22-4¢ How Do Interest Rates Affect Household Saving? 
An important decision that every person faces is how much income to 
consume today and how much to save for the future. We can use the theory 
of consumer choice to analyze this decision. In doing so, we examine how 
the amount that people save depends on the interest rate their savings 
will earn. 
Consider the decision facing Ryder, a worker planning for retirement. 
To keep things simple, divide Ryder’s life into two periods. In the first, 
Ryder is young and working. In the second, he is old and retired. When 
young, Ryder earns $100,000. He divides this income between current 
consumption and saving. When he is old, Ryder consumes what he has saved, 
including the interest that his savings have earned. 
We can view “consumption when voung” and “consumption when old” as the 
two goods that Ryder must choose between. The interest rate determines the rela￾tive price of these two goods. Suppose the interest rate is 10 percent. Then for every 
dollar that Ryder saves when young, he can consume $1.10 when old. 
Figure 17 shows Ryder’s budget constraint. If he saves nothing, he consumes 
$100,000 when young and nothing when old. If he saves everything, he consumes 
nathing when young and $110,000 when old. The budget constraint shows these 
and all the intermediate possibilities. 
Figure 17 uses indifference curves to represent Ryder's preferences for consump￾tion in the two periods. Because he prefers more consumption in both periods of 
his life, he prefers points on higher indifference curves to points on lower ones. 
Given his preferences, Ryder chooses the optimal combination of consumption in 
the two periods, which is the point on the budget constraint that is on the highest 
possible indifference curve. At this optimum, Ryder consumes $50,000 when young 
and $55,000 when old. 
Now consider what happens when the interest rate increases from 10 percent 
to 20 percent. Figure 18 shows two possible outcomes. In both cases, the budget 
constraint shifts outward and becomes steeper. At the new, higher interest rate, 
Ryder gets more consumption when old for every dollar of consumption that he 
gives up when young, DAl EOSANYALAKY STOCK PHOTO

R},rder s saving is his income minus his consumption when young, In panel (a), an 
increase in the interest rate reduces consumption when young, so saving rises. In panel 
(b), an increase in the interest rate increases consumption when young, so saving falls. 
The case shown in panel (b) might seem odd: Ryder responds to an increase in 
the return to saving by saving less. But this behavior is not as peculiar as it might 
seem. We can understand it by considering the income and substitution effects of 
a higher interest rate. 
Consider first the substitution effect. When the interest rate rises, consumption 
when old becomes less costly relative to consumption when young. Therefore, the 
substitution effect induces Ryder to consume more when old and less when young. 
In other words, the substitution effect induces Ryder to save more. 
Now consider the income effect. When the interest rate rises, Ryder moves to 
a higher indifference curve, so he is better off. If consumption when young and 
consumption when old are both normal goods, he will want to use his increased 
well-being to consume more in both periods. In other words, the income effect 
induces him to save less. 
The result depends on both the income and substitution effects. If the substitution 
effect of a higher interest rate exceeds the income effect, Ryder saves more. If the income 
effect exceeds the substitution effect, Ryder saves less. The theory of consumer choice 
says that an increase in the interest rate could either encourage or discourage saving. 
This ambiguous result is interesting from the standpoint of economic theory, but 
it is disappointing from the standpoint of economic policy. An important issue in tax 
policy hinges, in part, on how saving responds to interest rates. Some economists 
advocate reducing the taxation of interest and other capital income, arguing that 
such a policy change would raise the after-tax interest rate that savers can earn and 
encourage people to save more. Others argue that because of offsetting income and 
substitution effects, such a tax change might not increase saving and could even 
reduce it. Unfortunately, research has not led to a consensus. There remains dis￾agreement about whether changes in tax policy aimed at increasing saving would, 
in fact, have the intended effect.

22-5 Conclusion: Do People Really Think 
This Way? 
The theory of consumer choice describes how people make decisions. As we have 
seen, it applies to many questions. It can explain how people choose between pizza 
and Pepsi, work and leisure, consumption and saving, and so on. 
Now that we understand the theory, let’s step back and consider whether it is 
credible. You might be tempted to look upon the theory of consumer choice with 
some skepticism. After all, you are a consumer. You decide what to buy every time 
you walk into a store. And you know that you do not make your purchasing deci￾sions by writing down budget constraints and mapping out indifference curves. 
Doesn’t this knowledge about your own decision making refute the theory? 
No, it doesn't. The theory of consumer choice does not try to present a literal 
account of how people make decisions. It is a model. As Chapter 2 discussed, models 
are not supposed to be completely realistic. 
The theory of consumer choice should be viewed as a metaphor for how consum￾ers make decisions. No consumer (except an occasional economist) goes through 
the explicit optimization envisioned in the theory. Yet consumers know that their 
choices are constrained by their financial resources. And given those constraints, 
they do the best they can to achieve the highest level of satisfaction. The theory 
of consumer choice describes this intuitive process in a way that permits formal 
economic analysis. 
Just as the proof of the pudding is in the eating, the test of a theory is in its 
applications. The last section of this chapter applied the theory of consumer choice 
to three practical issues. If vou take more advanced courses in economics, you will 
see that this theory provides the framework for much additional analysis.

bundles of different goods she can buy given her

The consumer s indifference curves represent her pref￾erences. An indifference curve shows the various 
bundles of goods that make the consumer equally 
happy. Points on higher indifference curves are pre￾ferred to points on lower indifference curves. The slope 
of an indifference curve at any point is the consumer’s 
marginal rate of substitution—the rate at which the 
consumer is willing to trade one good for the other. 
The consumer optimizes by choosing the point on her 
budget constraint that lies on the highest indifference 
curve. At this point, the slope of the indifference curve 
(the marginal rate of substitution between the goods) 
equals the slope of the budget constraint (the relative 
price of the goods), and the consumer’s valuation of 
the two goods (measured by the marginal rate of sub￾the relative price). 
When the price of a good falls, the impact on the con￾sumer’s choices can be broken down into an income 
effect and a substitution effect. The income effect is 
the change in consumption that arises because a lower 
price makes the consumer better off. The substitution 
effect is the change in consumption that arises because 
a price change encourages greater consumption of the 
good that has become relatively cheaper. The income 
effect is reflected in the movement from a lower to a 
higher indifference curve, while the substitution effect 
is reflected by a movement along an indifference curve 
to a point with a different slope. 
The theory of consumer choice can be applied in many 
situations. It explains why demand curves sometimes 
slope upward, why higher wages can either increase or 
decrease the quantity of labor supplied, and why high￾er interest rates can either increase or decrease saving.

conomics is a study of the choices that people make and the 
interactions among people as they go about their lives. As 
the preceding chapters demonstrate, the field has many fac￾ets. Yet the facets we have already seen do not make up a finished 
jewel, perfect and unchanging. Economists are always looking for 
new areas to study, new phenomena to explain, and new ways 
to see the world. This final chapter on microeconomics discusses 
three topics at the discipline’s frontier to show how economists 
are trying to expand their understanding of human behavior and 
society. 
The first topic is the economics of asymmetric information. In 
many situations, some people are better informed than others, and 
the imbalance in knowledge attects the choices they make and how 
they deal with one another. Thinking about this asymmetry sheds 
light on many aspects of the world, from the market for used cars 
to the custom of gift giving. 
The second topic in this chapter is political economy, a term 
that once encompassed the entire field of economics but now refers 
to interdisciplinary work at the boundary of political science and

economics. Throughout this book, we have seen many examples in which markets 
fail to deliver desirable outcomes, and government policy can potentially improve 
matters. But “potentially” is a necessary qualifier: Whether this potential is realized 
depends on political institutions. The field of political economy uses the tools of 
economics to study how government works and, in doing so, provides a deeper 
understanding of economic policy. 
The third topic in this chapter is behavioral economics. This field brings insights 
from psychology into the study of economic issues. It questions whether people are 
entirely rational, at least in the conventional sense, and it offers a view of human 
behavior that is more subtle and complex, and perhaps more realistic, than the one 
found in standard economic theory. 
This chapter covers a lot of ground. To do so, it does not offer full helpings of 
these three topics bul, instead, gives a taste of each. One goal of this chapter is to 
show where economists are heading in their efforts to expand knowledge. Another 
is to whet your appetite for more courses in economics and allied fields.

“I know something you don't know.” This common elementary-school taunt conveys 
a truth about how people sometimes interact with one another. Often in life, one 
person knows more about what is going on than another. When that difference in 
knowledge is relevant to an interaction, it is called information asymmetry. 
Examples abound. Workers know more than their employers about how much 
effort they put into their jobs. Sellers of used cars know more than buyers about 
whether the cars offered for sale are in good condition. The first is an example of a 
hidden action, while the second is an example of a hidden characteristic. In each 
case, the uninformed party (the employer, the car buyer) would like to know the 
relevant information, but the informed party (the worker, the car seller) may have 
an incentive to conceal it. 
Because asymmetric information is so common, economists have devoted much 
effort to studying its effects. Here are some insights this study has revealed. 
23-1a Hidden Actions: Principals, Agents, and Moral Hazard 
Moral hazard is a problem that arises when one person, called the agent, performs 
a task on behalf of another person, called the principal. If the principal cannot 
perfectly monitor the agent’s behavior, the agent may act in a way that serves 
the agent’s self-interest but is undesirable for the principal. Economists adopted the 
somewhat odd phrase moral hazard from the insurance industry: It refers to the 
risk, or “hazard,” of inappropriate or otherwise “immoral” behavior by the agent. 
In such a situation, the principal tries various ways to encourage the agent to act 
more responsibly. 
The employment relationship is a classic example. The employer is the principal, 
and the worker is the agent. The moral-hazard problem is the temptation of imper￾fectly monitored workers to shirk their responsibilities. Employers can respond to 
this problem in various ways: 
¢ Better monitoring. Emplovers may plant hidden video cameras to record 
workers’ behavior. The employers’ aim is to catch irresponsible actions that 
might occur when supervisors are absent. 
¢+ High wages. According to efficiency-wage theories (discussed in Chapter 
20), some employers may choose to pay their workers a wage above the

level that balances supply and demand in the labor market. Workers who 
earn above-equilibrium wages—and are treated well in other ways—are less 
likely to violate their employers’ trust. 
* Delayed payment. Firms can delay part of workers’ compensation, so 
a worker who is caught shirking and fired suffers a larger penalty. One 
example of delayed compensation is the year-end bonus. Similarly, a firm 
may pay its workers more later in their lives. The wage increases that work￾ers usually get as they age may reflect not just the benefits of experience but 
also a response to moral hazard. 
Employers can use any combination of these mechanisms to reduce moral hazard. 
There are many examples of moral hazard beyond the workplace. A homeowner 
with fire insurance might buy too few fire extinguishers because the homeowner 
bears the cost of the extinguisher while the insurance company receives much of 
the benefit. A family may live near a river with a high risk of flooding because the 
Cnmnmtinns dominate the modern economy. In some ways, corporations 
are like other firms: They buy inputs in markets for the factors of 
production, sell their output in markets for goods and services, and fypi￾cally aim to maximize profit for their owners. But large corporations raise 
some issues that do not arise in, say, small family-owned businesses. 
From a legal standpoint, a corporation is an organization that is granted 
a charter recognizing it as a separate legal entity with its own rights 
and responsibilities distinct from those of its owners and employees. An 
important protection that corporations have is limited liability: The own￾ers of the corporation can lose their entire investment in the business, 
but not more than that. They are not personally liable for any losses the 
corporation suffers. 
Limited liability is related to another important feature of corpora￾tions: the separation of ownership and control. One group of people, 
the shareholders, own the corporation and share in its profits. Another 
group of people, the managers, are employed by the corporation to make 
decisions about how to deploy its resources. This arrangement requires 
limited liability because shareholders would be reluctant to invest in 
a business and let managers control it if the shareholders could incur 
unbounded losses. 
The separation of ownership and contral creates a principal-agent 
problem, with the shareholders as the principals and the managers as 
the agents. The chief executive officer and other managers are charged 
with the task of running the company for the shareholders. That makes 
sense because the managers are in the best position to know the available 
business opportunities. But the situation is fraught with moral hazard. 
While the shareholders typically want the managers to maximize profits, 
the managers may have goals of their own, such as taking life easy, having 
a plush office and a private jet, throwing lavish parties, or presiding over 
a large business empire. 
The corporation's board of directors is responsible for hiring and firing 
the top management. The board monitors the managers’ performance and 
sets their compensation packapes. These packages often include incen￾tives aimed at aligning the interests of shareholders with the interests 
of management. Managers might be given performance-based bonuses 
or stock options, which increase in value if the company performs well. 
Note that the directors are themselves agents of the shareholders. The 
existence of a board overseeing management only shifts the principal￾agent problem. The issue then becomes how to ensure that the board of 
directors fulfills its own legal obligation of acting in the best interest of 
the shareholders. If the directors become too friendly with management, 
they may not provide the required oversight. 
The principal-agent problem inherent in corparations flares up peri￾odically. It became big news around 2005. The top managers of several 
prominent companies, including Enron, Tyco, and WorldCom, were found 
to be engaging in activities that enriched themselves at the expense of 
their shareholders. In these cases, the actions were so extreme that they 
were criminal, and the corporate managers were not just fired but also 
sent to prison. Some shareholders sued the directors for failing to monitor 
management sufficiently. 
Criminal activity by corporate managers is rare, but in some ways, it is 
only the tip of the iceberg. Whenever ownership and control are separated, 
as they are in most large corporations, there is an inevitable tension 
between the interests of shareholders and the interests of management, 
and the problem of moral hazard can impede businesses from operating 
as efficiently as they could. m

family enjoys the scenic views, while the government bears the cost of disaster relief 
after a flood. Regulations aim to address the problem: An insurance company may 
require homeowners to buy fire extinguishers, and the government may prohibit 
building homes on land with a high risk of flooding. But the insurance company 
does not have perfect information about how cautious homeowners are, and the 
government does not have perfect information about the risks that families under￾take when choosing where to live, so the problem of moral hazard persists. 
23-1b Hidden Characteristics: Adverse Selection 
and the Lemons Problem 
Adverse selection is a problem that arises when one party in a transaction knows 
more about the attributes of the item being exchanged than the other. For example, 
the seller of a good might know more about it than the buyer, so the buyer runs the 
risk of being sold something of low quality. The “selection” of goods sold may be 
“adverse” from the buyer’s standpoint. 
The classic example of adverse selection is the market for used cars. Sellers know 
their vehicles’ defects while buyers often do not. Because the owners of the worst 
cars are more likely to sell them than the owners of the best cars, buyers worry about 
getting a “lemon,” and many people avoid buying used cars entirely. This lemons 
problem can explain why a used car only a few weeks old sells for thousands of 
dollars less than a new car of the same type. A buyer of the used car might surmise 
that the seller is getting rid of the car quickly because the seller knows something 
the buyer does not. 
The labor market provides a second example of adverse selection. According to 
one efficiency-wage theory, workers know their own abilities better than the firms 
that hire them do. If a firm reduces the wage it pays, the more talented workers are 
more likely to quit, knowing they will be able to find other jobs. Conversely, a firm 
may choose to pay an above-equilibrium wage to attract better workers. 
A third example of adverse selection occurs in insurance markets, as Chapter 
12 discussed. Buyers of health insurance know more about their own problems 
than insurance companies do. If people with greater hidden health problems are 
more likely to buy health insurance than other people, the price of health insur￾ance will reflect the costs of a sicker-than-average person. That may discourage 
healthier people from buying insurance, which only makes health insurance even 
more expensive. 
When markets suffer from adverse selection, the invisible hand does not neces￾sarily work its magic by ensuring that the gains from trade are fully realized. In the 
used car market, owners of good cars may keep them rather than sell them at the 
low price that skeptical buyers are willing to pay. In the labor market, wages may 
be stuck above the level that balances supply and demand, resulting in unemploy￾ment. In insurance markets, some potential buyers may remain uninsured because 
the policies they are offered fail to reflect their true characteristics. 
23-1c Signaling to Convey Private Information 
Markets respond to problems of asymmetric information in many ways. One is 
signaling, which refers to actions taken by an informed party for the purpose of 
revealing private information. 
Signaling has turned up in previous chapters. Chapter 17 discussed that firms 
may spend money on advertising to signal to potential customers that they have 
high-quality products. Chapter 20 considered that students may earn college degrees 
to signal to potential employers that they are high-ability individuals, rather than 
Cogryripght 20724 Cenpape Liamming. All Riphis Reserood. May mol ke copivel, aesnned, or dhaplicstal, in whole or mpon. Thie o electomsic righis, oo thind peoty coent may b soppreesal mom the Bk andfor eChepien(s) 
Ednonial review his deemed that sry suppressed coment does ot maierially affact tee overall learning expenience. Cengage Learning reserves the right o remewe addiional coment o any time if ssbseqeent nghts renmnctions require iChapter 23 Frontiers of Microeconomics 475 
to increase their productivity. These two examples of signaling (advertising, educa￾tion) may seem very different, but below the surface, they are much the same: In 
both cases, the informed party (the firm, the student) uses the signal to convince the 
uninformed party (the customer, the employer) that the informed party is offering 
something of high quality. 
What does it take for an action to be an effective signal? First, it must be costly. 
If a signal were free, everyone would use it, and it would convey no information. 
For the same reason, there is another requirement: The signal must be less costly, 
or more beneficial, to the person with the higher-quality product. Otherwise, 
everyone would have the same incentive to use the signal, and the signal would 
reveal nothing,. 
Consider again our two examples. In the advertising case, a firm with a good 
product reaps a larger benefit from advertising because customers who try the 
product once are more likely to become repeat customers. Thus, it is rational for 
the firm with a good product to pay for the cost of the signal (advertising), and it 
is rational for the customer to view the signal as informative about the product’s 
quality. In the education case, a talented person can finish school more easily than 
a less talented one. Thus, it is rational for the talented person to pay for the cost 
of the signal (education), and it is rational for the employer to view the signal as 
informative about the person’s talent. 
The world is replete with instances of signaling. Magazine ads sometimes 
include the phrase “as seen on TV.” Why stress this fact? One possibility is that 
the firm is trying to convey its willingness to pay for an expensive signal (an ad 
on television) in the hope that you will infer that its product is of high quality. 
For the same reason, graduates of elite schools are always sure to put that fact 
on their résumeés. 
Gifts as Signals 
A man is debating what to give his girlfriend for her birthday. 
“I'’know,” he says to himself, “I'll give her cash. After all, I don’t know 
her preferences as well as she does, and with cash, she can buy any￾thing she wants.” But when he hands her the money, she is offended. Convinced 
he doesn’t really love her, she breaks off the relationship. 
What's the economics behind this story? 
In some ways, gift giving is a strange custom. As the man in our 
story suggests, people typically know their own tastes better than 
others do, so we might expect everyone to prefer cash to in-kind 
transfers. If your employer chose some merchandise and substituted 
it for your paycheck, you would likely object to this means of pay￾ment. But your reaction is very different when someone who (you 
hope) loves you does something similar. 
One interpretation of gift giving is that it reflects asymmetric 
information and signaling. The man in our story has private informa￾tion that the girlfriend would like to know: Does he really love her? 
He says he does, but should she believe him? Talk is cheap. 
Choosing a good gift for her can be a signal of his love. Certainly, 
the act of picking out a good gift, rather than giving cash, has the 
right characteristics to be a signal. It is costly (it takes time), and 
its cost depends on private information (how much he loves her). 
If he really loves her, choosing a good gift is easy because he is ~ “Now we'll see how much he loves me.” ADRLATICFOTO/EHUTTERSTOCK. DO

screening 
an action taken by an 
uninformed party to 
induce an informed party 
to reveal information 
thinking about her all the time. If he doesn’t love her, finding the right gift is more 
difficult. Thus, giving a gift that suits his girlfriend is one way for him to convey 
the private information of his love for her. Giving cash shows that he isn't even 
bothering to try. 
The signaling theory of gift giving is consistent with another observation: People 
care most about the custom when the strength of affection is most in question. 
Giving cash to a girlfriend or boyfriend is usually a bad move. But when college 
students receive a check from their parents, they are less often offended. The par￾ents” love is less likely to be in doubt, so the recipient probably won't interpret the 
cash gift as a signal of insufficient affection. ® 
23-1d Screening to Uncover Private Information 
When an informed party takes actions to reveal private information, the phe￾nomenon is called signaling. When an uninformed party takes actions to induce 
the informed party to reveal private information, the phenomenon is called 
screening. 
Some screening is common sense. People buying used cars often ask that the car 
be checked by an auto mechanic before the sale. If sellers refuse this request, they 
reveal their private information that the car is not in good shape. Buyers may then 
decide to offer a lower price or to look for another car. 
Other examples of screening are more subtle. For example, consider a firm that 
sells car insurance. It would like to charge a lower premium to safe drivers than to 
risky ones. But how can it tell them apart? Drivers may know better than the insur￾ance companies whether they are safe or risky, but the risky ones won't admit it. 
Adriver’s history is one piece of information (which insurance companies use), but 
because of the randomness of many car accidents, history is an imperfect indicator 
of future risk. 
The insurance company might be able to sort out the two kinds of drivers by 
offering a menu of insurance policies that would induce the drivers to separate 
themselves. One policy would have a high premium and cover the full cost of any 
accidents that occur. Another policy would have low premiums but would have, 
say, a $2,000 deductible. (That is, the driver would be responsible for the first 
$2,000 of damage, and the insurance company would cover the remaining risk.) 
The deductible is more of a burden for risky drivers because they are more likely 
to have an accident. With a large enough deductible, the low-premium policy 
with a deductible would attract the safe drivers, while the high-premium policy 
without a deductible would attract the risky drivers. Faced with these two poli￾cies, the two kinds of drivers would reveal their private information by choosing 
different policies. 
23-1e Asymmetric Information and Public Policy 
We have examined two kinds of asymmetric information: moral hazard and adverse 
selection. And we have seen how individuals may respond to the problem with 
signaling or screening. Now let’s consider what the study of asymmetric informa￾tion suggests about the proper scope of public policy. 
The tension between market success and market failure is central to microeco￾nomics. Chapter 7 showed that the equilibrium of supply and demand in competi￾tive markets is efficient in the sense that it maximizes the total surplus that society 
can obtain in a market. Adam Smith’s invisible hand seemed to reign supreme.

This conclusion was then tempered by the study of externalities (Chapter 10), 
public goods (Chapter 11), health economics (Chapter 12), imperfect competition 
(Chapters 16 through 18), and poverty (Chapter 21). Those chapters examined how 
governments can sometimes improve market outcomes. 
The study of asymmetric information provides a new reason to be wary of mar￾kets. When some people know more than others, the market may fail to put resources 
to their best use. People with high-quality used cars may have trouble selling them 
for a good price because buyers are afraid of getting a lemon. People with few health 
problems may have trouble getting reasonably priced health insurance because 
insurance companies lump them together with those who have significant health 
problems. 
Asymmetric information may justify government action in some cases, but three 
facts complicate the issue. First, the market can sometimes deal with information 
asymmetries on its own using a combination of signaling and screening. Second, 
the government rarely has more information than the private parties. Even if the 
market’s allocation of resources is not ideal, it may be the best that can be achieved. 
That is, when there are information asymmetries, policymakers may find it hard to 
improve upon the market’s admittedly imperfect outcome. Third, the government 
is itself an imperfect institution, as we discuss in the next section.

23-2 Political Economy 
When the market’s outcome is deemed to be either inefficient or inequitable, the 
government may be able to improve the situation. Yet before embracing an active 
government, we need to consider one more fact: The government is also an imper￾fect institution. The field of political economy (sometimes called public choice or 
social choice) uses the methods of economics to study how government works.

23-2a The Condorcet Voting Paradox 
Demaocratic principles undergird the complex governmental institutions in the 
United States and in many other countries. Perhaps the most fundamental among 
these principles is majority rule. It seems straightforward enough. But majority rule 
can be more problematic than it seems. 
Consider a town deciding where to build a new park. The town council decides to 
let the voters choose. How will this work? If there are only two options, the answer is 
simple: The majority gets its way. But what if the new park could be placed in many 
possible locations? In this case, as the 18th-century French political theorist Marquis 
de Condorcet noted, democracy might have trouble figuring out which option to pick. 
Suppose there are three candidate locations, A, B, and C, and three voter types 
with the preferences shown in Table 1. The town council wants to aggregate these 
individual preferences into preferences for the town as a whole. How should it do it? 
At first, the council might try pairwise voting. If it asks voters to choose first 
between B and C, voter types 1 and 2 will vote for B, giving B the majority. If it then 
asks voters to choose between A and B, voter types 1 and 3 will vote for A, giving A 
the majority. Observing that A beats B and that B beats C, the council might conclude 
that A is the voters’ clear choice. 
But wait: Suppose the town council then asks voters to choose between A and 
C. In this case, voter types 2 and 3 vote for C, giving C the majority. Under pair￾wise majority voting, A beats B, B beats C, and C beats A. Normally, we expect 
preferences to exhibit a property called transitivity: If A is preferred to B, and B 
Condorcet paradox is preferred to C, then we would expect A to be preferred to C. The Condorcet 
the failure of majority paradox is that democratic outcomes do not always obey this property. Pairwise 
rule to produce transitive voting might produce transitive preferences in some cases, but it cannot be counted 
preferences for society on to do so. 
One implication of the Condorcet paradox is that the order in which things are 
voted on can affect the result. If the voters choose first between A and B and then 
compare the winner with C, the town ends up with C. But if the voters choose first 
between B and C and then compare the winner with A, the town ends up with A. 
And if the voters choose first between A and C and then compare the winner with 
B, the town ends up with B. 
The Condorcet paradox teaches two lessons. The narrow lesson is that when there 
are more than two options, setting the agenda (that is, deciding the order in which 
items are voted on) can have a powerful influence over the outcome of a democratic 
election. The broad lesson is that majority voting by itself does not always tell us 
what outcome a society really wants.

23-2b Arrow’s Impossibility Theorem 
Since political theorists first noticed the Condorcet paradox, they have spent much 
energy studying voting systems. Sometimes they propose new ones. 
As an alternative to pairwise majority voting, the town council could ask each 
voter to rank the candidates. For each voter, we could give 1 point for last place, 
2 points for second to last, 3 points for third to last, and so on. The candidate with 
the most total points wins. This voting method is called a Borda count after Jean￾Charles de Borda, the 18th-century French mathematician and political theorist who 
devised it. It is often used in polls that rank sports teams. With the preferences in 
Table 1, you will find that B is the winner. 
Another possible system is called ranked-choice voting, which many cities use 
to elect officials. Again, the voters rank all the candidates. Each vote is first assigned 
to that voter's first choice. The candidate with the fewest votes is then eliminated, 
and those votes are reallocated to the voters” second choice. And so on. Candidates 
are successively eliminated until one of them has a majority. With the preferences 
in Table 1, C is eliminated in the first round, the type 3 votes are reallocated from 
C to A, and A is the winner. 
Is there a perfect voting system? The economist Kenneth Arrow addressed this 
question in his 1951 book Social Choice and Individual Values. Arrow started by defin￾ing what an ideal voting system would be. He assumed that individuals have 
preferences over the possible outcomes: A, B, C, and so on. He then assumed that 
sociely wants a voting system to choose among these outcomes that satisfies several 
properties: 
Unanimity: If everyone prefers A to B, then A beats B. 
Transitivity: If A beats B, and B beats C, then A beats C. 
Independence of irrelevant alternatives: The ranking between any two out￾comes A and B does not depend on whether some third outcome C is also 
available. 
= No dictators: There is no person who always gets to pick the outcome, 
regardless of everyone else’s preferences. 
These all seem desirable and compatible. Yet Arrow proved, mathematically and 
incontrovertibly, that no voting system can satisfy all these properties. This result 
is called Arrow’s impossibility theorem. Arrow's impossibility 
The mathematics needed to prove Arrow’s theorem is beyond the scope of this theorem 
book, but for a sense of why the theorem is true, consider some examples. We have a mathematical result 
already seen the problem with the pairwise majority rule: The Condorcet paradox showing that, under 
shows that it fails to produce a ranking of outcomes that always satisfies transitivity. ~ certain assumed 
As another example, the Borda count fails to satisfy the independence of irrel- conditions, there is no 
evant alternatives. Recall that, using the preferences in Table 1, B wins with a Borda method for aggregating 
count. But suppose that C is no longer available. You will find that if the Borda count individual preferences 
method is applied only to A and B, then A wins. Eliminating C changes the ranking into a valid set of social 
between A and B because the Borda count depends on the number of points that preferences 
A and B receive, and the number of points each receives depends on whether the 
irrelevant alternative, C, is in the running, 
Ranked-choice voting also fails to satisfy the independence of irrelevant alterna￾tives. Recall that, using the preferences in Table 1, ranked-choice voting produces 
A as the winner. But if B disappears as an alternative, the winner becomes C. This 
change occurs because when B drops out, more voters have C as their first choice, 
so rather than being eliminated, it wins a majority in the first round.

To be sure, the three systems discussed so far—pairwise majority voting, Borda 
counts, and ranked-choice voting—do not do justice to the rich and complex set of 
rules and institutions that make up actual democracies. But Arrow’s impossibility 
theorem is a general result: It applies not just to these three simple systems but to 
any way a society might aggregate individual preferences to choose an outcome. 
Arrow’s impossibility theorem doesn’t say that we should abandon democracy 
as a form of government. But it does say that any democracy, no matter how well 
designed, must be flawed as a mechanism for social choice. 
23-2¢ The Median Voter Is King 
Despite Arrow’s theorem, voting is how most societies choose leaders and public 
policies, often by majority rule. The next step in studying government is to examine 
how governments run by majority rule work. That is, in a democratic society, who 
determines what policy is chosen? In some cases, the theory of democratic govern￾ment yields a surprisingly simple answer. 
Imagine that society is deciding how much money to spend on a public good, 
such as the army or the national parks. Each voter has an optimal budget in mind, 
and voters always prefer outcomes closer to their optimum to outcomes farther 
median voter theorem away. We can line up voters from those who prefer the smallest budget to those

of voters) is $9 billion, and the modal outcome (the one preferred by the greatest 
number of voters) is $15 billion. 
The median voter rules because her preferred outcome beats any other proposal 
in a two-way race. In this example, more than half the voters want $10 billion or 
more, and more than half want $10 billion or less. If someone proposes, say, $8 billion 
instead of $10 billion, everyone who prefers $10 billion or more will vote with the 
median voter. Similarly, if someone proposes $12 billion instead of $10 billion, 
everyone who wants $10 billion or less will vote with the median voter. In either 
case, the median voter has more than half the voters on her side. 
What about the Condorcet voting paradox? When the voters are picking a point 
along a line and each voter aims to be close to her own optimum, the Condorcet 
paradox cannot arise. The median voter’s preferred outcome beats all challengers. 
One implication of the median voter theorem is that if two rational political parties 
are each trying to win an election, they will both move their positions toward the 
one favored by the median voter. Suppose, for example, that the Democratic Party 
advocates a budget of $15 billion, while the Republican Party advocates a budget 
of $10 billion. The Democratic position is more popular in the sense that $15 billion 
has more proponents than any other single choice. Nonetheless, the Republicans 
get more than 50 percent of the vote: They will attract the 20 voters who want 
$10 billion, the 15 voters who want $5 billion, and the 25 voters who want zero. If 
the Democrats want to win, they will move their platform toward the median voter. 
This theory can explain why the parties in a two-party system are often similar: 
They have good reason to move toward the median voter. 
Another implication of the median voter theorem is that minority views are not 
given much weight. Imagine that 40 percent of the population want a lot of money 
spent on the national parks, and 60 percent want nothing spent. In this case, the 
median voter's preference is zero, regardless of the intensity of the minority’s view. Rather than reaching a compromise that takes everyone’s preferences into account, 
majority rule looks only to the person in the exact middle of the distribution. That 
is part of the logic of democracy. 
23-2d Politicians Are People Too 
When economists study consumer behavior, they assume that consumers buy 
the bundle of goods and services that gives them the greatest level of satisfac- tion. When economists study firm behavior, they assume that firms produce 
the quantity of goods and services that yields the greatest profit. What should 
they assume about the objectives of people involved in politics? 
It would be comforting to assume that political leaders always look out 
for the well-being of society, that they aim for an optimal combination of effi￾ciency and equality. Comforting, perhaps, but not realistic. Self-interest is as 
powerful a motive for political actors as it is for consumers and firm owners. 
Some politicians, motivated by a desire for reelection, are willing to sacrifice 
the national interest to solidify their base of voters. Others are motivated by 
simple greed. If you have any doubt, look at the world's poorest nations, where 
rampant corruption is often an impediment to economic development. Graft 
among political leaders is less common in advanced nations, but scandals still 
occur from time to time, and those scandals reveal only the corrupt leaders 
who were caught. “Isn’t that the real genius

23-3 Behavioral Economics 
behavioral economics 
the subfield of economics 
that integrates the 
insights of psychology 
Economics studies human behavior, but it is not the only field that makes that claim. 
The social science of psychology also sheds light on the choices that people make 
in their lives. The fields of economics and psychology are largely independent of 
one another, in part because they address different questions. But recently, a field 
called behavioral economics has emerged in which economists use psychological 
insights to better understand the decisions that people make. 
23-3a People Aren’t Always Rational 
Economic theory is populated by a particular species of organism, sometimes called 
Homo economicus. Members of this species are always rational. As firm owners, 
they maximize profits. As consumers, they maximize utility (or equivalently, pick 
the point on the highest indifference curve). Given the constraints they face, they 
rationally weigh all the costs and benefits and always choose the best possible 
course of action. 
Real people, however, are Homo sapiens. Although in many ways they resemble 
the rational, calculating people assumed in economic theory, they are more complex. 
They can be forgetful, impulsive, confused, emotional, and shortsighted. These 
characteristics are a central focus of psychologists but, until recently, have often 
been neglected by economists. 
Herbert Simon, one of the first social scientists to work at the boundary of eco￾nomics and psychology, suggested that humans should be viewed not as rational 
maximizers but as what he called satisficers. Instead of always choosing the best 
course of action, they make decisions that are good enough. Similarly, other econo￾mists have suggested that humans are only “near rational” or that they exhibit 
“bounded rationality.”

Studies of human decision making have found that people often make the fol￾lowing systematic mistakes: 
* People are overconfident. Researchers have demonstrated that people fre￾quently believe they know more than they do. Imagine, for example, that 
you were asked a series of numerical questions, such as how many African 
countries are in the United Nations, what the height of the tallest moun￾tain in North America is, how many gold medals China won in the last 
Olympics, and so on. For cach question, instead of being asked for a single 
estimate, you were asked to give a 90 percent confidence interval—a range 
that you were 90 percent confident the true number falls within. When 
psychologists run experiments like this, they find that most people give 
ranges that are too small: The true number falls within their intervals far less 
than 90 percent of the time. In other words, most people are too sure of their 
own abilities. 
¢ People give too much weight to a small number of vivid observations. 
Imagine that you are thinking about buying a car of a particular brand. To 
learn about its reliability, you read Consumer Reports, which has systemati￾cally surveyed 1,000 owners of the car. Then you run into a friend who 
owns one, and she tells you that her car is a lemon. How do you treat your 
friend’s observation? If you think rationally, you will realize that she has 
only increased your sample size from 1,000 to 1,001, providing little new 
information. But because your friend’s story is vivid—simply because it 
comes from your friend—you may be tempted to give it more weight in 
your decision making than you should. This phenomenon has been called 
undue salience. 
* People are reluctant to change their minds. People tend to interpret evi￾dence to confirm beliefs they already hold. In one study, subjects were asked 
to read and evaluate a research report on whether capital punishment deters 
crime. After reading the report, those who initially favored the death penalty 
said they were more certain of their view, and those who initially opposed 
the death penalty also said they were more certain of their view. The two 
groups interpreted the same evidence in exactly opposite ways. This behav￾ior is called confirmation bias. 
Think about decisions you have made in vour own life. Have you exhibited any 
of these traits? 
Deviations from rationality are important for understanding some economic 
phenomena. An intriguing example arises in the study of 401(k) plans, the tax￾advantaged retirement savings accounts that many firms offer their workers. In 
some firms, workers can choose to participate in the plan by filling out a simple 
form. In others, workers are automatically enrolled and can opt out of the plan by 
filling out a simple form. Many more people participate in the second case than in 
the first. If they were perfectly rational maximizers, they would choose the optimal 
amount of retirement saving, regardless of the default offered by their employer. 
In fact, employees’ behavior appears to exhibit substantial inertia. Understanding 
their behavior seems easier once we abandon the model of rational humans. 
Why, you might ask, is economics built on the rationality assumption when 
psychology and common sense cast doubt on it? One answer is that the assump￾tion, even if not exactly true, may be close enough that it yields workable models 
of behavior. For example, when we compared competitive and monopoly firms,

the assumption that firms rationally maximize profit yielded many important and 
valid insights. Incorporating deviations from rationality into the story might have 
added a bit of realism, but it would have also muddied the waters and made those 
insights harder to find. Recall from Chapter 2 that economic models are meant not 
to replicate reality but to show the essence of the problem at hand. 
Another reason economists often assume rationality may be that economists are 
themselves not rational maximizers. Like most people, they are overconfident and 
reluctant to change their minds. Their choice among alternative theories of human 
behavior may exhibit excessive inertia. Moreover, economists may be content with 
a theory that is not perfect but is good enough. The model of rational humans may 
be the theory of choice for a satisficing social scientist. 
23-3b People Care about Fairness 
Another insight about human behavior is best illustrated by an experiment called 
the ultimatum game. It works like this: Two volunteers (who are strangers to each 
other) are told that they are going to play a game and could win a total of $100. 
The game begins with a coin toss, which is used to assign the volunteers to two 
roles: proposer and responder. The proposer must suggest a division of the $100 
prize between the two players. After the proposer makes the offer, the responder 
decides whether to accept or reject it. If the responder accepts it, both players are 
paid accordingly. If the responder rejects the offer, neither player gets anything,. In 
either case, the game then ends. 
Before proceeding, think about what you would do. If you were the proposer, 
what division of the $100 would you offer? If you were the responder, what offers 
would you accept? 
Conventional economic theory assumes that people in this situation are rational 
wealth maximizers. This assumption leads to a simple prediction: The proposer 
will offer to take $99 and to give the responder $1, and the responder will accept 
the offer. After all, once the offer is made, the responder is better off accepting it: 
$1 is better than nothing. And because the proposer knows that accepting the offer 
is in the responder’s interest, the proposer has no reason to offer more than $1. In 
the language of game theory (discussed in Chapter 18), the 99-1 split is the Nash 
equilibrium. 
Yet when experimental economists ask real people to play the ultimatum game, 
the results differ from this prediction. People in the responder’s role usually reject 
offers of only $1 or a similarly small amount. Anticipating this, people in the pro￾poser’s role usually offer the responders much more than $1. Some people offer a 
5050 split, but it is more common for proposers to offer the responders an amount 
such as $30 or $40, keeping the larger share for themselves. In these cases, the 
responders usually accept the proposal. 
What's going on here? One interpretation is that people are driven in part by 
some innate sense of fairness. A 99-1 split seems so wildly unfair to many people 
that they reject it, even to their own financial detriment. By contrast, a 70-30 split 
is still unfair, but it is not so bad that it induces people to abandon their normal 
self-interest. 
Throughout our study of household and firm behavior, the innate sense of fairness 
has not played any role. But the results of the ultimatum game suggest that perhaps 
it should. For example, in Chapters 19 and 20, we discussed how wages were deter￾mined by labor supply and labor demand. Some economists have suggested that 
the perceived fairness of what a firm pays its workers should also enter the picture. 
When a firm has an especially good year, workers (like the responder) may expect

to be paid a fair share of the prize, even if the conventional market equilibrium does 
not dictate it. The firm (like the proposer) might well decide to give workers more 
than the equilibrium wage for fear that the workers might otherwise try to punish 
the firm with reduced effort, strikes, or even vandalism. 
23-3¢ People Are Inconsistent over Time 
Imagine a task that you find dreary. It might be doing your laundry, shoveling 
snow off your driveway, or filling out your income tax forms. Now consider the 
following questions: 
1. Would you prefer (A) to spend 50 minutes doing the task right now or (B) to 
spend 60 minutes doing the task tomorrow? 
2. Would you prefer (A) to spend 50 minutes doing the task in 90 days or (B) to 
spend 60 minutes doing the task in 91 days? 
When asked questions like these, many people choose B for question 1 and A for 
question 2. When looking ahead to the future (as in question 2), they minimize the 
amount of time spent on the dreary task. But faced with the prospect of doing the 
task immediately (as in question 1), they choose to put it off. 
In some ways, this behavior is not surprising: Everyone procrastinates sometimes. 
But from the standpoint of conventional rationality, it is puzzling. Suppose that in 
response to question 2, people choose to spend 50 minutes in 90 days. Then, when 
the 90th day arrives and they are about to start the dreary task, we allow them to 
change their mind. In effect, they then face question 1, so they opt to put off the 
taskunhltimmzxtda)r But why should the mere passage of time affect the choices 
they make? 
Often in life, people make plans for themselves but then fail to follow through. 
Smokers promise themselves they will quit, but within a few hours of smoking their 
last cigarette, they crave another on and renege on their commitment. People try￾ing to lose weight promise themselves they will stop eating dessert, but when the

Even after being fully vaccinated, many 
people remained fearful of Covid-19. 
Why is that, and what does it say about 
people’s ability to assess risk? 
Irrational Covid Fears 
By David Leonhardt 
uido Calabresi, a federal judge and Yale 
law professor. invented a little fable that 
he has been telling law students for more than 
three decades. 
He tells the students to imagine a god com￾ing forth to offer society a wondrous invention 
that would improve everyday life in almost every 
way. It would allow people to spend more time 
with friends and family, see new places and do 
jobs they otherwise could not do. But it would 
also come with a high cost. In exchange for 
bestowing this invention on society, the god 
would choose 1,000 young men and women 
and strike them dead. 
Calabresi then asks: Would you take the 
deal? Almost invariably, the students say no. 
The professor then delivers the fable's lesson: 
“What's the difference between this and the 
automobile? 
In truth, automaobiles kill many more 
than 1,000 young Americans each year; the 
total U.S. death toll hovers at about 40,000 
annually. We accept this toll, almost unthink￾ingly, because vehicle crashes have always 
been part of our lives. We can't fathom a world 
without them. 
It's a classic example of human irrational￾ity about risk. We often underestimate large, 
chronic dangers, like car crashes or chemical 
pollution, and fixate on tiny but salient risks, 
like plane crashes or shark attacks. 
(One way for a risk to become salient is for it 
to be new. That's a core idea behind Calabresi's 
fable. He asks students to consider whether 
they would accept the cost of vehicle travel 
if it did not already exist. That they say no 
underscores the very different ways we treat 
new risks and enduring ones. 
| have been thinking about the fable 
recently because of Covid-13. Covid certainly 
presents a salient risk: It's a global pandemic 
that has upended daily life for more than a 
year. It has changed how we live, where we 
work, even what we wear on our faces. Covid 
feels ubiquitous. 
Fortunately, it is also curable. The vaccines 
have nearly eliminated death, hospitalization 
and other serious Covid illness among people 
who have received shots. The vaccines have 
also radically reduced the chances that people 
contract even a mild version of Covid or can 
pass it on to others. 
Yet many vaccinated people continue to 
obsess over the risks from Covid—because 
they are so new and salient. 
To take just one example, major media out￾lets trumpeted new government data last week 
showing that 5,800 fully vaccinated Americans 
had contracted Covid. That may sound like a 
big number, but it indicates that a vaccinated 
person's chances of getting Covid are about one 
in 11,000. The chances of getting a version

23-4 Conclusion 
This chapter took you on a trip to the frontier of microeconomics. You may have 
noticed that we sketched out ideas rather than fully developing them. One reason 
is that you might study these topics in more detail in advanced courses. Another 
is that these topics remain active areas of research and are still being fleshed out. 
To see how these topics fit into the broader picture, recall the Ten Principles of 
Economics from Chapter 1. One principle states that markets are usually a good 
way to organize economic activity. Another says that governments can sometimes 
improve market outcomes. As you study economics, you can more fully appreciate 
these principles as well as the caveats that come with them. The study of asymmetric 
information may make you more wary of market outcomes. The study of political 
economy may make you more wary of government solutions. And the study of 
behavioral economics may make you wary of any institution that relies on human 
decision making, including both the market and the government. 
If these topics have a common theme, it is that life is messy. Information is imper￾fect, government is imperfect, and people are imperfect. Of course, you knew this 
long before you started studying economics. But economists need to understand 
these imperfections as precisely as they can if they are to explain, and perhaps 
improve, the world around them. 
any worse than a common cold are even more 
remote. 
But they are not zero. And they will not be 
zero anytime in the foreseeable future. Victory 
over Covid will not involve its elimination. 
Victory will instead mean turning it into the 
sort of danger that plane crashes or shark 
attacks present—too small to be worth reor￾dering our lives. 
That is what the vaccines do. If you're vac￾cinated, Covid presents a minuscule risk to 
you, and you present a minuscule Covid risk to 
anyone else. A car trip is a bigger threat, to you 
FLY WIEWY PRODUCTIONS E4/GETTY IMAGES 
and others. About 100 Americans are likely to 
die in car crashes today. The new federal data 
suggests that either zero or one vaccinated 
person will die today from Covid. ... 
Coming to grips with the comforting reali￾ties of post-vaccination life is going to take 
some time for most of us. It's only natural that 
so many vaccinated people continue to harbor 
irrational fears. Yet slowly recognizing that 
irrationality will be a vital part of overcom￾ing Covid. 
“We're not going to get to a place of zero 
risk,” Jennifer Nuzzo, a Johns Hopkins epide￾Source: New Fork Times, Apeil 15, 2021, 
miclogist, told me during a virtual Times event 
last week, "l don't think that's the right metric 
for feeling like things are normal.” 
After Nuzzo made that point, Dr. Ashish 
Jha of Brown University told us about his own 
struggle to return to normal. He has been fully 
vaccinated for almost two months, he said, 
and only recently decided to meet a vaccinated 
friend for a drink, unmasked. “It was hard— 
psychologically hard—for me,” Jha said. 
“There are going to be some challenges 
to re-acclimating and re-entering,” he added. 
“But we've got to do it." 
And how did it feel in the end, | asked, to 
get together with his friend? 
“It was awesome,” Jha said. 
Questions to Discuss 
1. How do you think you would have answ￾ered the question in Calabresi's parable? 
Do you think your answer is rational? 
2. |f you were vaccinated for Covid-19, how 
did the vaccination change your atti￾tudes and behavior? Do you think your 
response was fully rational?

Chapter in a Nutshell 
* Inmany transactions, information is asymmetric. When 
there are hidden actions, principals may be concerned 
that agents suffer from the problem of moral hazard. 
When there are hidden characteristics, buyers may 
be concerned about the problem of adverse selection 
among the sellers. Private markets sometimes deal with 
asymmetric information with signaling and screening. 
Although government policy can sometimes improve 
market outcomes, governments are themselves imper￾fect institutions. The Condorcet paradox shows that 
majority rule fails to produce transitive preferences 
for society, and Arrow’s impossibility theorem shows

that no voting system can be perfect. In many situ￾ations, democratic institutions will produce the out￾come desired by the median voter, regardless of the 
preferences of the rest of the electorate. Moreover, the 
individuals who set government policy may be moti￾valed by self-interest rather than the national interest. 
The study of psychology and economics reveals that 
human decision making is more complex than is 
assumed in conventional economic theory. People are 
not always rational, they care about the fairness of 
economic outcomes (even to their own detriment), and 
they can be inconsistent over time.

other aspect of the world, we need data. Theories and prmclpleq 
are critically important, but only after observing what's happening 
around us can we be sure we know what is true and what is not. 
The term data refers to factual information that provides the 
basis for reasoning and discussion. In economics, data are often 
quantitative, such as a person's income, a firm’s profit, the mar￾ket price of ice cream, the amount of ice cream sold, or a nation's 
gross domestic product. Data allow us to attach real numbers to 
the conceptual variables found in economic theory. 
Data analysis is increasingly central to modern economics. Over 
the past half century, advances in computing power have enabled 
economists to analyze ever larger data sets, and research based on 
data has become increasingly important. Compared with econo￾mists of the past, modern economists base their beliefs and policy 
advice less on pure theory and casual observation and more on the 
hardheaded analysis of data.

492 Part VIl Topics for Further Study 
A subfield of economics, called econometrics, is devoted to developing tools for 
data analysis. In essence, econometrics is the study of the statistical methods that are 
useful for understanding the economy. Many colleges offer courses in econometrics, 
and students majoring in economics are often required to take one as part of their 
training. This appendix chapter offers a brief introduction. 
We address three issues. First, we consider the kinds of data that economists 
use. Second, we discuss what economists aim to achieve through data analysis. 
Third, we examine some of the challenges that arise when drawing inferences 
from data and the methods that econometricians have devised to meet those 
challenges.

Let’s begin by discussing the sources and types of data that economists use most 
often. 
24-1a Experimental Data 
Sometimes data come from randomized controlled trials. A randomized con￾trolled trial is an experiment in which a researcher randomly divides subjects into 
groups, treats the groups differently, and compares how the groups respond to 
their treatments. 
For example, suppose a pharmaceutical company comes up with a new drug to 
treat a disease. Before regulators allow the company to market the drug, it must prove 
that the drug is safe and effective. The company’s researchers start by recruiting a 
sample of, say, 200 people who have the disease. Half of the patients are randomly 
assigned to the treatment group and given the drug. The other half are assigned 
to the control group and given a placebo (a harmless but ineffective pill that looks 
like the actual drug). The researchers then follow the health of the two groups. If 
the patients in the treatment group fare better than those in the control group, the 
drug is deemed safe and effective. Otherwise, the drug is declared unsafe, ineffec￾tive, or both. 
Data gathered from randomized controlled trials are called experimental data. 
In many cases, controlled trials are the most reliable way to draw inferences about 
things we want to learn. If the number of trial participants is large enough and the 
assignment to the treatment and control groups is truly random, we can be sure 
that the only important difference between the two groups is their exposure to the 
treatment. 
Randomized controlled trials are sometimes used in the social sciences. (The 
case study below presents an example.) But their usefulness is limited in eco￾nomics. The problem is often one of feasibility. Experiments can be expensive to 
run, and policymakers may object to the unfairness of treating people differently. 
And sometimes, the economic cost of running the experiment would be too large. 
For example, to study the effects of monetary policy, a central bank could set 
its policy randomly from year to year and then observe the consequences. This 
experiment might advance the cause of social science, but it would have such 
an adverse impact on a nation’s welfare that no one would seriously consider 
conducting it.

The Moving to Opportunity Program 
An important example of experimental data comes from the 
Moving to Opportunity Program, which the U.S. Department of 
Housing and Urban Development ran in the 1990s. The goal was 
to study the effects of living in high-poverty neighborhoods. 
The researchers recruited several thousand low-income families living in neigh￾borhoods experiencing high levels of poverty to participate in the experiment. By 
lottery, the families were divided into a treatment group and two control groups. 
Families in the treatment group received vouchers that subsidized rent if they 
moved to more affluent neighborhoods. In one control group, families received 
rental vouchers without any restriction on where they could live. In the second 
control group, families received nothing at all. The researchers compared the sub￾sequent life outcomes, such as earnings and educational attainment, for the family 
members in the three groups. 
Some of the results were disappointing. Even though many in the treatment 
group used the vouchers to leave high-poverty neighborhoods, the adults in the 
three groups did not exhibit significant differences in economic outcomes. The 
average incomes of the adult family members were about the same in the treatment 
and control groups, though health outcomes were somewhat better for those in the 
treatment group. Similarly, there were no significant differences in the measured 
life outcomes for older children (ages 13 to 18) in the treatment group. 
Yet the program had a significant, positive impact on children who were below 
the age of 13 when their families received the vouchers. Younger children in the 
treatment group did not perform better in school than those in the control groups, 
as measured by test scores in reading and math. But later in their lives, they had 
significantly higher rates of college attendance, lower rates of single motherhood, 
and higher incomes as adults. These results show that young children enjoy long￾term benefits if their families leave high-poverty neighborhoods. @ 
24-1b Observational Data 
Because experimental data are not always available, economists often rely on 
observational data, which are obtained not from conducting an experimentbut from observational data 
simply observing the world as it is. Observational data can come from surveys of house- data that come from a 
holds and firms and from administrative records, such as tax returns. Compared with ~ researcher observing the 
experimental data, observational data have the advantage of being more easily produced ~ world as it presents itself 
and more widely available, but they present two challenges to data analysts. 
The first is the problem of confounding variables. A confounding variableisa confounding variable

That strategy would be fine if students and teachers were placed into the classes 
randomly, as is the case with experimental data. But with observational data, 
because the placement of students and teachers is probably not random, other 
variables related to class size may enter the picture and bias the results. Small 
classes, for instance, might be more common in towns with better-educated and 
higher-income populations. If parental education affects student performance, it 
is a confounding variable that makes the impact of small classes seem larger than

it actually is. The benefits of parental education could be incorrectly attributed to 
class size. Or perhaps school principals assign less-experienced teachers to smaller 
classes. If teacher experience affects student performance, it is a confounding 
variable that makes the impact of small classes appear smaller than it actually is. 
The disadvantages of having a less experienced teacher could mask the benefits 
of small classes. Because many variables can be correlated with one another in 
observational data, researchers need to carefully distinguish the effects of one 
variable from the effects of another. 
The second challenge presented by observational data is the problem of reverse 
causality. Reverse causality describes a situation in which a researcher believes that 
one variable influences a second variable, when, in fact, it is the second variable 
that influences the first. 
For example, suppose you observe that the quantity consumed of some food 
is positively correlated with a person’s body mass index (BMI), an indicator of 
obesity. Should you conclude that the consumption of that food causes an increase 
in BMI? That inference would be correct if food consumption were set randomly, 
as in a controlled trial, but problems can arise with observational data. If the food 
in question were ice cream, the direction of causality might indeed run from food 
consumption to BMI: Eating a lot of ice cream may cause weight gain. The positive 
correlation does not prove this, but the hypothesis is at least plausible. On the other 
hand, if the food were diet soft drinks, a different interpretation might be in order. 
Maybe people with a high BMI are trying to lose weight and therefore choose to 
consume diet soft drinks. That is, rather than the consumption of diet soft drinks 
causing a high BMI, a high BMI may cause the consumption of diet soft drinks. This 
example illustrates a general lesson: Sorting out what is cause and what is effect is 
often tricky when using observational data. 
Despite these problems, observational data can be useful if the data analyst is 
careful. Later, this chapter introduces some of the methods econometricians have 
devised to deal with confounding variables and to determine causal effects. 
24-1¢ Three Types of Data 
Whether data are experimental or observational, they can come in three types: 
cross-sectional, time-series, and 
Cross-sectional data show the cl‘mractenshcs of multiple subjects (such as 
people, firms, or nations) at a given time. For example, we might survey a group 
of workers and ask each of them to report their wage, education, age, experi￾ence, profession, race, gender, and so on. We can use these data to see how these 
variables are related to one another. For example, we can examine how much 
wages differ by race or gender after adjusting for differences in education, age, 
experience, and profession. 
Time-series data show the characteristics of a single subject (one person, firm, 
or nation) at various times. For example, we might measure a nation’s unemploy￾ment rate (the percent of the labor force that is jobless) and its GDP (gross domestic 
product, a measure of production and income) every year over a 60-year period. We 
can use these data to study how fluctuations in unemployment and GDP are related. 
Panel data combine the elements of cross-sectional and time-series data to show 
the characteristics of multiple subjects (such as people, firms, or nations) at various 
times. This type of data, also known as longitudinal data, is useful for examining 
how changes in one variable affect another. For example, we could study how 
winning the lottery affects a person’s labor-force participation by comparing the 
changing behavior over time of lottery winners and losers.

24-2 What Economists Do with Data 
Having seen how economists gather data (from experiments or observations) and 
the types of data they gather (cross-sectional, time-series, or panel), let’s consider 
what economists hope to achieve through data analysis. 
24-2a Describing the Economy 
Economic data are often interesting in themselves as quantitative descriptions of 
the world. For example: 
* You may have heard that most people devote a large fraction of their spend￾ing to housing, but you might not know how large it is. The data show that 
average consumers in the United States spend 42 percent of their budgets on 
housing. 
* You know that, by definition, a household at the 90th percentile of the US. 
income distribution has higher income than a household at the 10th percen￾tile, but you might not know how different their incomes are. The data show 
that the rich household has about 12 times the income of the poor house￾hold. 
* You probably know that the United States has higher income per person 
than Mexico, but you might not know how much higher it is. The data show 
that average income per person in the United States is about three times that 
in Mexico. 
* You may have read that spending on healthcare has risen as a share of total 
spending in the economy, but you might not know by how much. The data 
show that U.S. healthcare spending has risen from 5 percent of GDP in 1960 
to 18 percent in 2019. 
These kinds of facts are useful to know. As we develop theories to understand how 
the world works and consider policies to improve it, keeping an eye on the data 
gives us a better sense of the world as it is. 
24-2b Quantifying Relationships 
Economic theory often suggests that certain variables are related, but it rarely tells 
us how strongly they are related. Often, we need a sense of those magnitudes. That 
is, we need estimates of a model’s parameters, the numerical values that govern parameters 
the strength of the relationships among variables. the numerical values that 
Consider an example. Suppose policymakers are considering a tax on luxury govern the strength of 
cars. They might want to know whether the burden of the tax will fall more on the relationships among 
the buyers or the sellers of the cars. The incidence of a tax depends on the price variables in a model 
U apympll 3008 Uenpape Lesming All Rappis Boservedd by man be copend. scamned. or duplbcstod. | whoke or mopant. D 5o ciectrome mghis, sans shend paey oosies! mony be seppressad Srom g ook amdior of sapieris |

elasticities of supply and demand, which measure the responsiveness of quantity 
supplied and quantity demanded to changes in the good’s price. If demand is more 
elastic than supply, sellers bear most of the burden; if supply is more elastic than 
demand, buyers bear most of the burden. 
This theoretical conclusion takes us only so far. To answer the policymakers’ 
question, we need estimates of the parameters, which here are the price elastici￾ties of supply and demand. To come up with those estimates, researchers would 
collect data on the luxury car market. A careful analysis of the data can establish 
quantitatively the determinants of quantity supplied and quantity demanded. In 
particular, it would yield estimates of the price elasticities, which can be used to 
project the incidence of the proposed tax. 
24-2¢ Testing Hypotheses 
Economic theories attempt to describe the world in which we live. Like all 
theories in science, an economic theory is just a hypothesis, an educated guess 
about how the world works. To confirm or refute the hypothesis, we need to 
turn to data. 
For example, consider the impact of schooling on wages. Economist Betsey 
thinks that education is a great way to increase a worker’s wage. She believes 
that the human capital produced in school makes workers more productive, and 
more productive workers are paid more. Economist Justin thinks education is a 
waste of time. He believes that most things taught in school are useless in most 
jobs and that people are better off getting job experience than wasting time in 
the classroom. 
No amount of theorizing can settle the debate between Betsey and Justin. Their 
disagreement is empirical: It can be addressed only by the facts, not by sheer logic. 
In this case, we need to turn to data on wages, education, and job experience to 
decide which of their hypotheses is correct. (Spoiler alert: Most economists side 
with Betsev.) 
24-2d Predicting the Future 
“It's tough to make predictions, especially about the future.” Yogi Berra was a wise 
man, yet economists are often asked to predict the future. A microeconomist might 
be asked how the upcoming merger between two firms will affect prices in the 
market for their products. A macroeconomist might be asked how quickly a sudden 
spike in inflation will subside. 
Sometimes, you can make forecasts simply by finding patterns in the data and 
extrapolating them into the future. For example, suppose you observe that when 
married couples trade in their compact cars for minivans, they usually have a new 
baby a few months later. If your neighbors come home with a minivan one day, you 
might reasonably predict that a baby is on the way. Economists call this relationship 
between minivans and babies an empirical regularity, and it might be useful for 
forecasting for a while. But the relationship is not reliably stable. If a car company 
introduced a new line of family-friendly SUVs, for instance, minivan purchases 
might become a less useful tool for predicting births. 
To make reliable predictions, economists often turn to models, which are math￾ematical representations of the forces at work in a given situation. For a model 
to be useful in making quantitative predictions, economists need to quantify 
each relationship within it. They do so using the relevant data to estimate the 
model’s parameters. Once the estimated model is in hand, they can use it to 
make predictions.

The FRB/US Model 
An important model in economic policymaking is the Federal 
Reserve Board’s model of the U.S. economy, abbreviated as FRB/US 
(and pronounced as “fur-bus”). The FRB/US model tries to describe 
the main macroeconomic elements of the U.S. economy, including the relation￾ships among key variables such as GDP, inflation, unemployment, and interest 
rates. The central bank uses the model for forecasting and policy analysis. 
The FRB/US model includes hundreds of equations, each describing a piece 
of the economy. Many of these equations are identities—equations that must be 
true because of how the variables in the equation are defined. An identity does not 
have any parameters that need to be estimated. (An example is the national income 
accounts identity Y = C + I + G + NX, which states that GDP is the sum of con￾sumption, investment, government purchases, and net exports.) But about 60 equa￾tions in the FRB/US model are equations that describe how households or firms 
respond to economic conditions, and these equations include crucial parameters. 
For example, an equation for consumption would show how households’ spend￾ing on consumer goods and services depends on their current income, expected 
future income, wealth, interest rates, and so on. The relative importance of these 
determinants of consumption is reflected in the parameters of the consumption 
equation. Economists at the Federal Reserve estimate these parameters by applying 
econometric techniques to the time-series data on the U.S. economy. 
With the estimated FRB/US model in hand, Fed economists use the model 
for two purposes. The first is forecasting. Based on current policy and economic 
conditions, they project the most likely outcome for the future. The projection is 
based on simultancously solving the hundreds of equations in the model. This 
task might seem impossible, and it would be if they had to rely on pencil and 
paper. Fortunately, computer algorithms are available to solve such large-scale 
models. 
The second purpose for which Fed economists use the FRB/US model is policy 
analysis. They ask how the future would be different from their baseline projection 
if the Fed changed monetary policy in some way. The result is a set of alternative 
policy scenarios. They show what would happen to key economic variables—GDP, 
unemployment, inflation, and so on—if the Fed tightened or loosened monetary 
policy. The members of the Federal Open Market Committee, who set monetary 
policy, can use this menu of scenarios as a guide for choosing a direction for policy. 
How reliable are the forecasts presented by the Fed economists? Studies find that 
they are as good as or better than those provided by most private economic fore￾casters, but they are far from perfect. Because the reliability of the forecasts depends 
on the accuracy of the FRB/US model, Fed economists are always looking for ways 
to improve it. Some improvements come from new conceptual insights, such as 
better economic theory. Others come from more data that arrive as time passes and 
from new statistical insights as econometricians devise better ways to use data. ®

24-3 The Methods of Data Analysis 
Table 1 
Data on Wages and Education 
Having discussed the kinds of data that economists use and what they hope to 
achieve using the data, let's consider some of the methods that econometricians 
have developed for data analysis. 
24-3a Finding the Best Estimate 
According to the theory of human capital, when workers become more educated, 
they become more productive, and their wages increase. That statement is quali￾tative: It addresses the nature of the relationship between education and wages 
but not the strength of it. Suppose you wanted to go beyond this qualitative 
statement and ask the quantitative question, “By how much does an extra year 
of schooling increase a worker’s wage?” This question is empirical. You can only 
answer it using data. 
You begin by surveying a number of workers and collecting data on their wages 
and education. It would look like Table 1. (You would likely want your sample to 
include more than seven workers, but for purposes of illustration, seven is sufficient.) 
The data in Table 1 are an example of cross-sectional data. 
As you look over the data, you see that more educated workers do, in fact, 
tend to earn more. The two workers with 12 years of schooling, presumably high 
school graduates, earn an average of $25 an hour. The two workers with 16 years of 
schooling, perhaps college graduates, earn an average of 540 an hour. And the two 
workers with 18 years of schooling, who may have done some study in graduate 
school, earn an average of $45 an hour. 
Yet wages do not always rise with education. Chloe has four more years of schooling 
than Brooke, but they earn the same wage. Emma has two more years of schooling than 
Flynn, but she earns $10 per hour less than he does. Education may be one determinant 
of a worker's wage, but there must be other important factors as well. 
One way to start understanding these data is to graph them, as in Figure 1. Each 
point represents one observation. The figure shows the positive correlation between 
wages and education: Points to the right (indicating more years of schooling) tend 
to also be higher in the graph (indicating higher wages). Yet the points do not lie 
along a straight line or even a simple curve. They resemble a cloud, suggesting that 
there are factors beyond years of schooling that affect wages.

17 14 16 12 Yearsof 
Schooling 
To determine how much each year of schooling increases a worker’s wage, an 
economist will turn to a statistical model—a mathematical representation of the 
process that generates the data. The simplest such model is the following;: 
WAGE, = B, + B, X SCHOOL, + &, 
where 3 and B, are parameters that measure how the variables are related. According 
to this model, person i's wage (WAGE,) depends on years of schooling (SCHOOL) 
and is influenced by a random variable (e ). The variable on the left-hand side, 
WAGE, is called the dependent variable; it is the variable being explained. The 
measured variable on the right-hand side, SCHOOL,, is called the independent 
variable; it is the variable taken as given. The term ¢_is called the residual. It repre￾sents the many forces, such as experience and cognitive ability, that influence wages 
but are excluded from the model. The residual is assumed to be zero on average 
and uncorrelated with the independent variable. (We will discuss the role of this 
assumption later, but for now, let's just go with it.) 
This statistical model is called a linear regression. In essence, this model draws 
a line through the cloud of points, as shown in Figure 2. The line shows the best 
guess of a worker's wage based on years of schooling. The residual represents the 
deviation of the actual wage from the wage predicted by the line, acknowledging 
that the model will not fit the data perfectly. 
The key parameter of interest is B,, which tells us how much each year of school￾ing increases a person’s wage. The other parameter, B, determines the intercept of 
the line. Taken literally, B, would be the average wage for a person with zero years 
of schooling. But because our sample does not include anyone with no education 
at all, it is best to avoid that literal interpretation. Our focus is on B,. 
The question we now face is how to best estimate the parameters from the data 
we have. We could just try to draw a well-fitting line through the cloud of points by 
hand, but that approach is too inexact (and not easily generalized to more complex 
cases discussed in a moment). The standard method for finding the best-fitting 
line is called ordinary least squares, or OLS. We won't go into the details of OLS 
in this chapter, but the intuition is simple. OLS aims to determine the parameters

(B, and B ) representing the line that is closest to the data points. Closeness here is 
measured by the squared residuals. Squaring the residuals ensures that both posi￾tive and negative residuals are deemed to detract from the goal of closeness. OLS 
finds the parameters that minimize the sum of squared residuals. 
When OLS is applied to the seven data points in Table 1, it yields the following 
result: 
WAGE, = —10.7 + 3.16 x SCHOOL. 
According to the estimated model, each year of schooling increases a worker's wage 
by $3.16 per hour. That is the answer to our question. 
This example illustrates a general lesson: Economists often want to go beyond 
qualitative theoretical insights (education increases wages) to quantitative conclu￾sions (how much each year of schooling increases wages). This leap requires data. 
The economists find the data relevant for the issue at hand, posit a statistical model 
that can plausibly explain the data, and estimate the model’s parameters using a 
method such as ordinary least squares. Using the estimated model, they can reach 
quantitative conclusions. 
24-3b Gauging Uncertainty 
Economists use data to estimate key quantities (such as the wage benefit of a year 
of schooling in the previous section). Often, they want to know not only the best 
estimate but also how reliable that estimate is. That is, they want to know whether 
their estimate is precise or a rough guess. 
Before returning to our model of wages and education, let’s take a detour to 
consider a simpler example. Suppose you are interested in the height of the average 
person in New York City. One way to find that number is to get data on the height of 
every New Yorker. You then compute the average (also called the mean) by adding 
up all their heights and dividing by the number of people. Because your calculation 
includes the entire population, you arrive at the precisely correct answer. But there 
is a problem: New York has about 9 million people, so this approach is not practical. 
Fortunately, there is an easier way if you are content with an answer that is not 
completely precise. Instead of trying to get data on the entire population, you can

choose a random sample of, say, 100 people. The meaning of “random” is that 
every person in the population has an equal chance of being chosen. Because of 
the randomness, the sample is likely to be representative of the population. You 
can estimate the height of the population by computing the average height of these 
100 randomly chosen people. 
Let’s say that the average height of the 100 people in your sample is 66 inches. So 
far, so good. But you might start wondering how reliable this estimate is. Because 
the sample was chosen randomly, there is no reason to think that the sample average 
of 66 inches is too high or too low an estimate of the average height of the popula￾tion. But it could be either. You could have gotten unlucky by randomly choosing 
a sample with a few more tall people or a few more short people than normal. This 
uncertainty comes from what statisticians call sampling variation—the variability 
that arises because different random samples lead to somewhat different estimates. 
Statisticians have developed ways not only to estimate parameter values but 
also to gauge the uncertainty associated with parameter estimates resulting from 
sampling variation. The details of this process are beyond the scope of this chapter, 
but the basic idea can be gleaned from our example. Here is how it works. 
First, after computing the mean height of the 100 people in your sample, you 
compute the standard deviation of heights. The standard deviation is a measure 
of variability across observations, and you may have learned about it in a math or 
statistics class. In our example, let's say you compute that the standard deviation 
of heights is 4 inches. 
What is a standard deviation? Technically, it is the square root of the average 
squared deviation from the mean. That is a mouthful, but there is a more intuitive 
way to think about it. For a normal bell-shaped distribution, about 95 percent of 
observations fall within two standard deviations of the mean. In our example, the 
mean is 66 inches, and the standard deviation is 4 inches (making two standard 
deviations 8 inches). So, if you pick a New Yorker at random, the probability that this individual’s height lies between 58 and 74 inches is 95 percent. 
Next, using the standard deviation and the sample size, you can compute a mea￾sure of your estimate’s reliability called the standard error. According toa formula standard error 
developed by statisticians, the standard error of the sample mean as an estimate ~ a measure of the 
of the population mean is the standard deviation divided by the square root of the uncertainty associated 
sample size. In this case, the standard error of your estimate is 4/4100 = 4/10 = with a parameter 
0.4. This number can be used to gauge the degree of sampling variation in your estimate that results from 
estimate. Just as the standard deviation measures the variability in the height of sampling variation 
individual New Yorkers, the standard error measures the variability in the mean 
height of samples of New Yorkers. 
Here is a useful rule of thumb: The true value of a parameter lies within two 
standard errors of the estimated value about 95 percent of the time. In this example, 
the estimate is 66 inches, and the standard error is 0.4 inches. Two standard errors 
equal 0.8 inches. So you can be 95 percent confident that the true mean height of 
the population is between 65.2 inches and 66.8 inches. 
Based on this rule of thumb, twice the standard error is sometimes called the 
margin of error. Journalists often use this term when reporting results from public 
opinion polls. For example, you might hear that, according to a poll of 400 people, 
57 percent favor a particular candidate, with a margin of error of 5 percent. That 
means you can be 95 percent confident that the true support for that candidate lies 
between 52 and 62 percent. 
Standard errors are useful not only in simple examples like estimating a popula￾tion mean but also in other contexts. Depending on the circumstances, the formulas

to calculate standard errors can be complex. Fortunately, most statistical software 
used to produce parameter estimates automatically gives the standard errors asso￾ciated with the estimates. 
For the data on wages and education in Table 1, the estimated equation produced 
by Microsoft Excel, along with the standard errors in parentheses, is the following;:

It turns out that the estimate of $3.16 for each year of schooling is not very precise. 
Two standard errors are 2 X 1.35 = 2.70. Thus, we can be 95 percent confident that 
the true wage benefit of a year of schooling lies between $0.46 and $5.86. That is a 
large range. But we should not expect much precision when estimating a param￾eter using only seven data points. If we had 700 data points similar to these, the 
standard error would be 0.135, and the 95-percent confidence interval would lie 
between $2.89 and $3.43, which is a smaller range. Estimated parameters become 
more precise with larger samples. 
24-3¢ Accounting for Confounding Variables 
In many situations, the dependent variable is a function of more than one other vari￾able. Wages, for example, depend not only on education but also on experience, cog￾nitive ability, job characteristics, and so on. If data analysts are not careful, they can 
mistakenly confuse the effects of one variable with the effects of another. Fortunately, 
statistical methods are available to help avoid this problem of confounding variables. 
As an example, let’s continue with our statistical model of wages and education: 
WAGE, = B, + B, X SCHOOL, + & 
Earlier, we assumed that the residual & _had a zero mean and was uncorrelated 
with the independent variable SCHOOL.. The assumption of a zero mean is not 
crucial: If the mean is not zero, it will alter only the estimate of the constant term . 
Because the constant term is not the key parameter of interest, we are not led astray. 
The assumption that the residual is uncorrelated with the independent variable, 
however, is fraught with potential problems. The residual reflects all the forces that 
influence wages other than years of schooling. If those other forces are correlated 
with schooling, OLS will yield an incorrect estimate of the effect of schooling on 
wages. The problem is one of confounding variables. 
For example, suppose that some people are simply smarter than others. Cognitive 
ability is another plausible determinant of a worker's wage. If ability is unmea￾sured, it will be reflected in the residual. That is not a problem as long as ability 
and schooling are not correlated. Estimating the model above would, on average, 
give the correct estimate of the benefit of schooling. In the language of statistics, 
the estimate of B, would be unbiased. 
But suppose that people with greater ability get more years of schooling than 
people with less ability. In this case, the residual (which includes ability) would be 
positively correlated with the independent variable (schooling). The value of g, 
estimated by OLS would reflect not only the effect of schooling but also, to some 
degree, the effect of cognitive ability. In other words, OLS would confound the effect 
of the independent variable, schooling, with the effect of a related omitted variable, 
ability. As a result, the estimate of B, would be biased upward. That is, it would 
indicate that schooling has a more powerful effect on wages than it really does.

What is to be done? One approach is to find some way to measure the confounding 
variable. Suppose we return to our seven workers and find that, as children, they 
each took an IQ (intelligence quotient) test, a measure of cognitive ability. Table 2 
shows the expanded data. As expected, IQ and schooling are positively correlated: 
Higher 1Q workers tend to have more years of schooling. If IQ might have its own 
direct effect on wages, beyond its indirect effect through schooling, then our previ￾ous estimate of B, is suspect. 
All is not lost, however. We can expand our statistical model as follows: 
WAGE, = B, + B,x SCHOOL + B, x1Q +«_ 
In this new statistical model, a worker's wage depends on education and ability 
as measured by IQ. Because this statistical model has more than one independent 
variable, it is called a multiple regression. multiple regression 
We can again apply ordinary least squares to estimate the model’s parameters. a linear regression model 
OLS will now choose B, B,, and B, to minimize the sum of squared residuals. OLS with more than one 
yields unbiased estimates of the parameters as long as the residual is uncorrelated independent variable 
with all the independent variables (schooling and IQ in this example). And the 
results will be reliable even though the independent variables are correlated with 
each other. In this case, a multiple regression estimated by OLS lets us sort out the 
relative importance of schooling and IQ in determining wages. 
Estimating this model using the data in Table 2 yields the following results (with 
standard errors to gauge parameter uncertainty in parentheses): 
WAGE, = —49.1 + 1.86 x SCHOOL, + 057 x IQ. 
(29.5) (1.41) (0.35) 
As we expected, once we control for IQ, the estimated effect of schooling decreases. 
The new estimate suggests that each year of schooling increases a worker's wage 
by $1.86 per hour rather than $3.16 per hour as estimated when we did not include 
IQ in the model. 
To sum up: When an omitted variable (ability as measured by IQ in our example) 
directly influences the dependent variable (wages), and the omitted variable is cor￾related with the independent variable (schooling), OLS vyields misleading results.

that generated by a 
randomized controlled 
trial 
The OLS estimate confounds the effect of the independent variable with the effect 
of the omitted variable. One way to deal with this problem is to include the previ￾ously omitted variable in a multiple regression. 
Multiple regression, however, is not the only way to handle the problem of con￾founding variables. The next section considers another approach. 
24-3d Establishing Causal Effects 
Data analysts are often interested in the causal effect of one variable on another. For 
instance, if workers get one more year of schooling, what change in their wages will 
that cause? If people double their intake of a particular food, what change in their 
body mass index will that cause? The estimation of causal effects using observational 
data is difficult due to both the potential omission of confounding variables and 
the possibility of reverse causality. 
Sometimes, these problems can be addressed by exploiting a natural experiment. 
A natural experiment is a chance event that generates variation in the data as ifa 
randomized controlled trial had been conducted. 
Consider an example. Imagine that one day, Phyllis Philanthropist gives a talk 
at a high school and makes a surprise announcement: Phyllis will pay four years 
of college tuition for all the students who graduate from that school and go on to 
college. This is great news for those students, more of whom will likely continue 
their education. Across town, there is another high school, much the same as the first 
but without a generous philanthropist. This situation offers a natural experiment. 
The first high school is the treatment group, and the second is the control group. 
By comparing the years of schooling and subsequent wages of the two groups, we 
can measure the causal effect of extra schooling. 
Economists have developed a statistical approach to measure causal effects in 
data from natural experiments like this one and in similar situations. It is called 
the instrumental variables method, and you will study it if you take a course in 
econometrics. The key to this method is to find some random variable, called the 
instrument, that meets two conditions: 
1. The instrument is correlated with the independent varable of interest. 
2. The instrument does not affect the dependent variable other than through its 
effect on the independent variable. 
In our example, the instrument is Phyllis’s generosity in the first high school 
and its absence in the other. This random act increases the schooling of those in 
the treatment group (condition 1), but it does not affect their subsequent wages 
other than by increasing their schooling (condition 2). Under these conditions, 
we can use the instrumental variables method to identify the causal effect of 
schooling on wages. 
For a numerical example, let’s return to the workers in Table 1. Suppose Chloe, 
Emma, and Flynn attended the high school that received Phyllis’s offer, while 
Andy, Brooke, Diego, and Gina attended the high school that did not. Simple 
calculation shows that the treatment group (Chloe, Emma, and Flynn) has average 
schooling of 16.7 years and an average wage of $40 per hour, while the control 
group (Andy, Brooke, Diego, and Gina) has average schooling of 14 years and an 
average wage of $35 per hour. Apart from exposure to the treatment (Phyllis's 
generosity), the two high schools are assumed to be the same. Because the treat￾ment group has 2.7 more years of schooling and earns $5 per hour more than

Ednonial review his deemed that sry suppressed coment does ot maierially affact tee overall learning expenience. Cengage Learning reserves the right o remewe addiional coment o any time if ssbseqeent nghts renmnctions require iChapter 24 Appendix: How Economists Use Data 505 
the control group, we estimate that each vear of schooling increases wages by 
$5/2.7, or 51.85 per hour. 
The use of natural experiments always raises thorny questions about whether 
the experiment is as random and easily interpreted as it seems. In our example, 
the key question is whether the two high schools really are the same aside from 
Phyllis's offer. In reality, the students might not have been sorted into the two schools 
randomly. Maybe student placement was based on residence, and one side of town 
has a richer and better-educated population than the other. Maybe Phyllis made 
her offer to the one school because its students seemed especially hardworking or 
especially in need. Such differences could bias the results. Whenever researchers 
rely on natural experiments, they need to consider whether the process generating 
the data differs from a randomized controlled trial and whether these differences 
could contaminate their findings. 
Despite these caveats, finding a natural experiment is often the best way to esti￾mate the causal effect of one variable on another, as the following case study shows. 
How Military Service Affects Civilian Earnings 
What is the effect of a period of military service on a person’s sub￾sequent earnings as a civilian? This question is important both for 
personal decision making and for public policy toward the military. 
There are plausible arguments in both directions. One might argue that civil￾ian earnings would be higher for those with some military service on their résu￾més because the military teaches discipline, teamwork, and valuable job skills. 
Alternatively, one might argue that civilian earnings would be lower for those 
with military service because the military takes time away from the private-sector 
experience and on-the-job training that a civilian job would provide. Either of these 
hypotheses could be true. Only the data can decide. 
Consider how we can use data to address the issue. A starting point might be 
to compare workers with past military service and those without. The difference 
between the average earnings of the two groups might be taken to be the effect of 
military service. 
That approach, however, has a problem. The difference in earnings might 
result from the personal characteristics of people who join the military rather 
than from a causal effect of military experience. Perhaps people who join the 
military are already more disciplined and good at teamwork than those who 
forgo the experience. In this case, those with military service would earn more 
even if the military service had no effect. Or perhaps those who join the mili￾tary do so because they don't have the skills for well-paid civilian jobs. In this 
case, those with military service would earn less even if the military service 
had no effect. Because there are many omitted variables, military service can￾not be interpreted as the cause of the difference in average earnings between 
these groups. 
So how can we answer the question? A randomized controlled trial would do 
the trick. We could randomly divide the population into two groups: one that is 
forced into a period of military service and one that is prohibited from it. We then 
compare the subsequent civilian earnings of the two groups. The difference must 
reflect the causal effect of military service because the randomization ensures that 
the two groups are otherwise the same. 
We cannot conduct exactly that experiment, but historically, the U.S. government 
has done something close. In the early 1970s, during the Vietnam War, young men

were drafted into the military based on a lottery. If a young man had a low lottery 
number, he was likely to be drafted. If he had a high lottery number, he would 
likely avoid military service. To be sure, the lottery number was not the only deter￾minant of military service: The rich and well-connected could more easily avoid 
the draft, and those with high lottery numbers could nonetheless volunteer. But the 
lottery number itself was completely random. 
In an important study, the economist Joshua Angrist noted that the draft lottery 
number is an ideal variable for applying the instrumental variables method. The 
lottery number satisfies the two conditions discussed earlier. It affected military 
service (condition 1). And it did not affect subsequent earnings other than through 
its effect on military service (condition 2). 
What did Angrist learn from studying this natural experiment? Here is his bot￾tom line: “In the early 1980s, long after their service in Vietnam had ended, the 
earnings of white veterans were approximately 15 percent less than the earnings of 
comparable nonveterans.” Serving your country in the military can be a noble act, 
perhaps even more so once we recognize the long-term economic cost to many of 
those who serve. 
In 2021, Angrist won the Nobel Prize for his “methodological contributions to 
the analysis of causal relationships.” @

24-4 Conclusion 
This chapter has been a whirlwind tour of the large and often technical field of 
econometrics. It discussed the kinds of data that economists use, what they aim 
to achieve with their data analysis, and how various statistical methods help in 
drawing reliable inferences from the data. But to feel ready to apply the tools of 
econometrics yourself, you will need to take a full course on the topic. The brief 
introduction in this chapter provides a foundation for that future study.

* Economists use two kinds of data to study how 
the world works: experimental data obtained from 
randomized controlled trials and observational data 
obtained from surveys and administrative records. 
Interpreting observational data requires extra care due 
to the problems of confounding variables and reverse 
causality. 
There are three types of data. Cross-sectional data 
present information about multiple subjects (such 
as people, firms, or nations) at a given point in time. 
Time-series data present information about a single 
subject over time. Panel data present information 
about multiple subjects over time. 
Economists usually have one of four goals when using 
data: describing the economy, quantifying relation￾ships among variables, testing hypotheses, or predict￾ing the future.

To quantify relationships, statistical methods are used 
to find parameter estimates that best fit the data. One 
such method is ordinary least squares. 
Statistical methods not only estimate parameters but 
also determine the uncertainty associated with those 
estimates that arises from sampling variation. An esti￾mate’s standard error is a measure of that uncertainty. 
Data analysts can be led astray if a confounding variable 
is correlated with the independent variable and omitted 
from the statistical model. One approach to dealing with 
this problem is to add the confounding variable to the 
model and use multiple regression to estimate the true 
effect of the independent variable of interest. 
To estimate the causal effect of one variable on another, 
data analysts need to be careful about confounding 
variables and reverse causality. One approach is to look
