Chapter 1
The multiple dimensions 
of peace
A sketch
The story of peace is as old as the story of humanity itself, and 
certainly as old as war. It is a story of terrible setbacks—as with 
the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022—and progress—as might 
be seen in varying degrees in countries like Colombia, or in 
Northern Ireland, in the Balkans, or Timor-Leste. Peace is always 
made in very difficult circumstances, as this volume will illustrate. 
Historically, peace has often been taken, as with the Oxford 
English Dictionary’s definition, to imply an absence of overt 
violence or war between or sometimes within states. War is often 
thought to be the natural state of humanity, peace of any sort 
being fragile and fleeting. This book challenges this view. Peace in 
its various forms has been by far humanity’s objective—as the 
archaeological, ethnographic, and historic records indicate. Peace 
has left a historical legacy, a series of sedimental layers, 
institutional frameworks, methods, and tools aimed at preventing 
war. Frameworks for security, law, redistribution of resources, 
representation, reconciliation, and justice have constantly been 
advancing as can be seen in the United Nations’ recent ‘Sustaining 
Peace’ agenda (2016).
Yet, despite such developments, international relations remain 
subject to a range of geopolitical tensions, and the failure of a Peace
2
range of peacebuilding, peacekeeping, and mediation tools, as 
in Libya, Yemen, and Syria. Many of the peacekeeping and 
peacemaking processes, in places such as the Middle East, the 
Democratic Republic of Congo, or Cyprus, are now frozen into the 
political landscape, and have been so for decades. In ongoing 
conflicts, as with Russia’s invasion in Ukraine, the tools of 
peacekeeping, peacemaking, and peacebuilding are slow to be 
engaged, seem to be very limited, and reactive. After so much 
promise in the latter part of the 20th century, what has gone 
wrong and what should be done?
The earliest classical thinkers, including the Sophists, Plato 
(c.428‒348 bc), Aristotle (384–322 bc), to Cicero (106‒43 bc) and 
later Augustine (ad 354–430), debated how virtuous and peaceful 
political order could be designed, as well as the pros and cons of 
the relationship between war and politics, as in Thucydides’ 
contribution (c.460‒c.400 bc). The question of the span of 
political community was crucial even at this early point: was it a 
matter of territory, a language group, or simply existing in the 
world—a citizen of the world, as the Stoic Diogenes the Cynic 
(c.412–323 bc) argued, followed by Seneca (c.4 bc–ad 65) and 
Plutarch (c.ad 46–119)? Other thinkers such as Marcus Aurelius 
(ad 121–80) also favoured trying to understand other communities 
and peoples.
During its long evolution since such classical engagements, peace 
came to be organized domestically within the state, internationally 
through global organizations and institutions, or transnationally 
through actors whose ambit covers all of these levels. After the 
Enlightenment, world government, federation, or confederation 
came to represent a global constitutional dream, debated by the 
Duc de Sully (1560–1641), with his ‘Grand Design’ in the 17th 
century, and by Kant (1724–1804), Rousseau (1712‒78), Bentham 
(1748‒1832), and others. The reality of the current international 
system is that it has evolved into something far more complex and 
far less elegant than Kant envisioned.The multiple dimensions of peace
3
Peace can be public or private, politically organized to balance 
great power interests or sociologically constructed to maintain 
peace and order in everyday life. Peace at this level has often been 
a hidden phenomenon, subservient to power and interests.
Peace practices and theories have made huge advances throughout 
history. However, violence remains a political or economic tool. 
It does not help that peace is a rather ambiguous concept. 
Authoritarian governments and powerful states have, throughout 
history, had a tendency to impose their version of peace on their 
own citizens as well as those of other states, as with the Soviet 
Union’s suppression of dissent amongst its own population and 
those of its satellite states, such as East Germany or Czechoslovakia. 
Peace and war may be closely connected, such as when military 
force is deployed to force peace, as with North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization (NATO) airstrikes in Bosnia-Herzegovina in 1995 
and in Kosovo in 1999.
Over the last 300 years or so an international peace architecture 
(IPA) has come into existence. It represents several sedimental 
layers including formal and informal systems designed to prevent 
various types of war and build a better political order. They have 
been essential for the survival of all political orders, from 
city-states, to empires, as well as the modern states system. The 
IPA spans great power diplomacy, a balance of power framework, 
international law, multilateralism, and organizational frameworks 
such as the United Nations (UN), the European Union (EU), 
NATO, the African Union (AU), and many others. It includes 
tools for international peacekeeping and mediation, arbitration, 
disarmament, constitutional reform, development, and 
democratization. It has included social mobilization to expand 
and claim new rights and security. It has been supported by global 
civil society networks. It represents an inter-generational effort 
to overcome war, but it has also tended to be reactive, fragile, 
and has often failed to stop war. Indeed, it is geared to prevent or 
end the last type of war, rather than the next, violence being a Peace
4
fast-evolving phenomenon. However, over the longer term, it has 
become more complex and adept, culminating in the international 
system of diplomacy, law, and treaties, the UN system, donor 
networks, development frameworks, and global civil society.
A wide range of sources representing a broader scientific and 
historical agreement indicate that the emergence of peace is 
closely associated with a variety of political, social, economic, and 
cultural struggles against war and oppression. Many of the 
innovations in peacemaking and its consolidation first emerged in 
such struggles. Peace activism has normally been based on 
campaigns for individual and group rights and needs, for material 
and legal equality between groups, genders, races, and religions, 
disarmament, and to build international institutions to govern the 
behaviour of states, militaries, and empires. This has in the long 
term required the construction of local and international 
associations, networks, and institutions, which coalesced around 
widely accepted agendas. Peace activism supported internationally 
organized civil society campaigns against slavery in the 18th 
century, workers’ rights, enfranchisement, equality, and for basic 
human dignity and rights ever since. Various peace movements 
struggled against imperial or occupying states for decolonization, 
independence, and self-determination, or for voting rights and 
disarmament (most famously perhaps, the Campaign for Nuclear 
Disarmament). Ordinary people can, and have often, mobilized 
for peace in societal terms using peaceful methods of resistance 
(as with Indian non-violent opposition to British rule in the 1920s 
until Independence in 1947).
Despite such wide-ranging advances, there remains controversy 
over whether peace or war is humanity’s ‘natural condition’. The 
political left claims there is a constant struggle against oppression 
and hegemony to achieve justice and peace, and that only a broad 
version of peace is acceptable, often requiring international 
collaboration. Conversely, the right claims that violence is endemic 
and inherent in human society and so a narrow version is the only The multiple dimensions of peace
5
pragmatic choice for the state. A ‘Leviathan’ is often needed, 
which is focused on national interests that normally preclude 
international cooperation to any significant degree.
In addition to the contestation over a minimalist or maximalist 
version of peace, there is also the glaring question as to whether 
war and violence are, directly or indirectly, profitable for states or 
those actors engaged in them. Much scientific thought agrees that 
social, political, and economic inequality in society, as well as in 
the international system, which have often been taken to represent 
natural stratifications, are important sources of power and rent for 
key actors in the international political economy. It might be 
simplistic to say that inequality and injustice are thus also causes 
for war, especially as they are carried down across generations, but 
it is also very plausible as a systemic explanation. Thus, blockages 
in peace processes, whether relating to spoilers or incompatible 
interests, may be forms of organized opposition to peace—in other 
words, a counter-peace process. There may also be systemic, 
structural forms of counter-peace. This dynamic, little remarked 
upon, follows the pattern of counter-revolutions, which have 
often, in a Burkean sense, tried to reverse the emancipatory gains 
of revolutions such as the French or American in the 18th century 
(in his case to preserve the interests of the aristocracy). Blockages 
may emerge from the policies of governments intent on the 
national interest or the defence of a people’s historical privilege as 
well as from actors, warlords, insurgents who have broken the 
prohibition of the use of violence in the political terrain. It also 
reflects the counter-insurgency strategies that dominant actors 
often used in colonial history to put down popular insurgencies, 
which were often aimed at self-determination and the hope of 
overturning economic exploitation.
This short book outlines the positive, though complex and often 
controversial, story of the evolution of peace in practice and 
theory (mainly from the perspective of the global north). It should 
be noted that non-Western peace traditions, spanning the major Peace
6
historical civilizations, religions, and identities, now also play a 
substantial role in these debates. The West has been the loudest 
and most influential voice—for better or worse—in defining 
the politics and economics of peace since the Enlightenment, 
even despite the resurgence of the global south after formal 
decolonization or the rise of China. It has promoted the ‘liberal 
peace’, upon which the post-Second World War and post-Cold 
War IPA has been based. Since the early 2000s, this framework 
has looked incredibly fragile, however. The search continues for 
better alternatives or refinements.7
Chapter 2
Defining peace
Defining peace and its dimensions is a difficult task. There is no 
single definition. A starting point is to think either in terms of a 
narrow version, which implies the ending of open violence 
without resolving its underlying causes, or a broader version, 
which implies liberal peace or peace with justice. The current 
situation in Cyprus where Greek and Turkish Cypriot military 
forces, or Korea where North and South Korean forces confront 
each other daily across a demilitarized line might be described as 
a negative peace, as would the failed peace treaty after the First 
World War (The Treaty of Versailles). By contrast a broad version 
would produce a peace agreement, peaceful state, society, and 
regional order, perhaps according to a single universal model of 
positive peace, as Johan Galtung (1930‒) argued. The European 
Union’s emergence from the ruins of the Second World War is an 
example. It has the ambition of dealing with underlying, 
structural violence. In a further step, multiple versions of peace 
(a hybrid peace framework) would imply coexistence of very 
different social and political systems. The peace agreement 
between Egypt and Israel in 1978 is an example of this approach, 
in which very different states and peoples with many remaining 
and deep disagreements came to a limited agreement. Another, 
more recent example is offered by the hybrid form of peace that is Peace
8
emerging in Timor-Leste since the Indonesian occupation 
ended in 1999.
Each of these versions of peace offers different levels of security 
and rights for society: a narrow version would be basic and stable 
for as long as power relations remained unchanged; a broader 
version more complex but also more just, and a hybrid approach 
even more complex, more just, but perhaps less stable because of 
its complexity. Underlying each type is a central question: does one 
make peace by subjugating one’s enemies, assimilating them, or by 
accepting, and thus becoming reconciled to their differences?
Negative peace
A narrow understanding of peace indicates an absence of overt 
violence (such as warfare or low-intensity conflict) both between 
and within states. This may take the form of a ceasefire, a 
power-sharing agreement, or exist within an authoritarian 
political system. It indicates that one state, or group in society, 
dominates another through violence or more subtle means (no 
peace, no war, in other words). This approach has the benefit of 
simplicity, but will always be fragile because it is based on 
ever-shifting configurations of power. Hidden structural and 
cultural violence embedded in social, economic, and political 
systems remains unaddressed. This might explain why, after 
various ceasefires in the 2000s, the peace process collapsed in 
Colombia on several occasions. The core issues of the dispute, in 
particular relating to land distribution, poverty, and socio-economic 
inequality, have not as yet been addressed. A peace agreement 
based on a narrow understanding of peace would probably 
not be satisfactory in anything other than the short term. 
Military force or an authoritarian government may maintain a 
basic security order—as in East Germany during the Cold 
War—but many deficits relating to human rights, democratic 
representation, justice, and prosperity remain as markers of 
structural violence.Defining peace
9
A negative understanding of peace draws on an ‘inherency’ view 
that violence is intrinsic to human nature, and is endemic in 
society, history, and amongst states. Such an argument is often 
drawn from observations of how animals appear to behave, 
particularly primates (though the applicability of such evidence is 
much disputed). If conflict is endemic because it is rooted in 
human nature then little can be done about it other than by using 
force to promote strategic interests. Security in these terms means 
the preservation of a pre-existing hierarchy of states, their 
territorial sovereignty, and a balance of power between them—as 
in 19th-century Europe and the ‘Concert System’ post-1815. This 
was the attitude toward war and conflict and their relationship 
with a negative peace from ancient times until at least the 
Enlightenment, perhaps until the emergence of fascism in the 
early 20th century. Peace existed (somewhat conveniently for, and 
from, the perspective of kings, queens, emperors, and various 
dictators) mainly as a painful stalemate between rulers, or 
absolute victory, in between the frequent wars that took place 
across history. In this history, human beings are merely pawns of 
the powerful and their interests.
Positive peace
Such views were slowly supplanted by positive peace approaches 
after the Enlightenment. A broader understanding of peace 
indicates both the lack of open violence between and within states, 
and the aim of creating the conditions for society to live without 
fear or poverty, within a broadly agreed political system 
(i.e. responding to structural, cultural, and environmental violence). 
It implies the relative fulfilment of individuals in society, as well as 
stable political institutions, law, economics, states, and regions. 
It represents the proverbial ‘good life’ or the ‘Perpetual Peace’ 
to which famous philosophers from Aristotle (384–322 bc) to 
Immanuel Kant (1724–1804), a German liberal philosopher, have 
often alluded. Much of post-Enlightenment political history, 
especially since the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648, reflects an Peace
10
attempt to develop a scientific conceptualization of peace in 
positive terms as a response to Europe’s incessant wars by 
building an IPA.
Indeed, it is possible to claim that in fact peacemaking has been 
one of the most common activity of humanity in history. As every 
society has experienced conflict on various levels, all societies have 
developed sophisticated methods for peacemaking—from social 
institutions to formal legal processes and public institutions. 
Conflict and war are learned behaviours that can be prevented or 
mitigated through tools such as military intervention (ironically), 
diplomacy, compromise, agreement, redistribution of resources, 
and education.
This view has shaped the attempt during the 20th century to build 
a positive peace, defined as long-term stability, sustainability, and 
social justice. From this understanding developed the post-war 
League of Nations Mandate (1920) and the UN system (1945). It 
also led to tools such as mediation, as used by US President Carter 
after the 1974 war in the Middle East between Egypt and Israel, 
peacekeeping as in Cyprus, Congo, and many other countries, 
conflict resolution and transformation now widely used at the civil 
society level, and peacebuilding as used from Cambodia to 
Bosnia-Herzegovina in the 1990s.
A public or official narrative of history tends to be dominated by 
elites (kings, queens, emperors, politicians, the military, religious 
figures, the very rich, and, more often, Western or Northern men). 
However, there is also a private transcript of everyday history that 
offers a more nuanced understanding of human history and 
society. In this private transcript, a positive peace is located in 
everyday life. This social peacemaking tendency may be less 
visible than the ruptures caused by violence but nonetheless it 
contributes to the development of political and international 
institutions—from local governance, national parliaments, and 
the UN system.Defining peace
11
Positive peace approaches have also engendered a shift from 
traditional notions of security where the onus was on the state to 
secure its territory and sovereignty, as Max Weber (1864–1920) 
argued. This view has been nuanced by a version of security where 
human beings, rather than the state, are the main focus. A positive 
peace, along with concepts such as ‘human security’ (which in 
1994 was defined by a UN Development Programme official as 
‘freedom from fear, freedom from want’) rests upon arguments 
that violence is learned rather than innate in society so conflict 
may be mutually and consensually resolved. Direct, cultural, and 
structural violence can be removed, offering a form of peace as an 
outcome of political reform, akin to the everyday lives that many 
people experience in developed liberal democracies. This means 
security, law, order, and prosperity have become comparatively 
and relatively routine in post-war settlements, as happened for 
many European countries after the Second World War. Under 
such conditions social justice (human rights, democratic 
representation, relative material equality, and prosperity), the 
accountability of states and elites, as well as peace between states, 
may be achieved.
A positive peace approach maintains that conflict can be resolved 
fully by people, states, and institutions through a range of 
innovative responses. These might lead to local, everyday, as well 
as transnational or international peace campaigns, institutions, 
and architectures. As well as addressing social, economic, 
political, military, and resource dynamics of conflict, positive 
peace also engages with identity, class, race, gender, labour, and 
ethnic differences. Such multiple and entwined causes require 
multi-disciplinary, multidimensional, and sophisticated responses, 
if conflict is to be resolved.
The concept of a positive peace has been significant in policy 
terms. It has influenced how conflict is understood and addressed 
by states and by various international or regional organizations: 
the UN, World Bank, and international donors or governments, Peace
12
especially those of the OECD and G20, as well as the 
European Union.
Everyday and hybrid peace
A further sophistication indicates that there exist multiple 
conceptions of peace across the range of cultures, states, and 
societies around the world. Most societies, however ‘modern’ or 
‘traditional’, have their own version of everyday peace, drawn from 
custom, social, and other context-dependent factions, which is 
eventually scaled up into a political order. These often engender 
different, or at least nuanced, notions of social harmony, economic 
prosperity, political institutions, and law, as well as respect for 
historical traditions and identity. Enabling coexistence between 
different entities practising different forms of peace would require 
mediation between them and cooperation at the social, state, and 
international level. However peace is defined, it has always 
attracted innovative or radical thought, action, and has led to 
hybridized institutions and practices, aimed at defining peace 
through justice rather than by power.
Theory and practice
The entire history of peace in Western and often ‘Eurocentric’ 
thought spans the thought of the ancient Greek philosopher Plato 
to the emergence of NATO after the Second World War, the recent 
history of non-governmental organization and networks, 
multilateralism and regional integration, and attempts to develop 
reconciliation based upon cooperation between former enemies. 
Over the years of its existence, the UN (often through the General 
Assembly or its many agencies) has compiled and released 
documents, reports, and resolutions, outlining innovations in the 
field and drawing on a wide global consensus. These have offered 
platforms for doctrines and strategies designed to deal with the 
complicated relationship between power and peace: from its 
programmes for ‘cultures of peace’; rights to peace; on the need Defining peace
13
for ‘new economic orders’; economic, social, and cultural rights; to 
independence, self-determination, development, and 
peacebuilding. Most recently, the UN’s ‘Sustaining Peace’ agenda 
(2018) has emerged which reiterates the connection of peace with 
justice and sustainability.
Reflecting positive, everyday peace approaches, these 
contributions have called for equality in identity and gender 
terms, self-determination, participation, cooperation, social 
justice, and development. They have endorsed a right to culture, 
society, and work, and to choose one’s own identity. They have 
called for an international states-system framed in the interests of 
peace, justice, and sustainability. Representatives of much of the 
planet’s population signed these documents, yet such global 
political and scientific consensus has been easily ignored. Thus, 
the evolution of peace has been slow, and rather than a single, 
positive, universal peace emerging, this process appears to be 
leading to an interlocking system of hybrid and multiple ‘peaces’. 
By the 2020s this phenomena reflected an increasingly multi-polar 
(as opposed to multilateral) international environment.
In the contemporary era, more active concepts such as 
‘peacebuilding’, ‘development’, ‘conflict resolution’, ‘conflict 
transformation’, ‘statebuilding’, and ‘stabilization’ are often used 
interchangeably with the word ‘peace’. Within the UN system 
policymakers generally agree that they should try to address the 
root causes of conflict.
Several important lines of thought converge in modern theoretical 
approaches to peace: one focused on the constitution of the state, 
another on the role of international organizations, another on the 
underlying philosophy of peace, and another on peace movements 
emerging from society.
Peace thinking also has long had religious connotations, arising 
from the way different religions treat violence and promote Peace
14
tolerance throughout history. Such views span concepts such as 
‘just war’, self-defence, non-violence, civil society, human rights, 
liberal democracy, liberal internationalism, the democratic peace, 
coexistence, and pacifism (drawing on Christian, Confucian, 
Buddhist, and Hindu philosophy).
Some general theories, dynamics, and themes prominent in the 
historical discussion of peace reappear in its theories. The 
best-known approach in political theory is called political realism.
Early contributors included authors such as Sun Tzu (an ancient 
Chinese military strategist and philosopher who was the author of 
The Art of War in the 5th century bc), Thucydides (an ancient 
Greek historian from the 5th century bc, who because of his 
experiences in the Peloponnesian War between Sparta and Athens 
claimed that power rather than morality was important in war), 
and Augustine (a Latin philosopher and theologian during the late 
Roman Empire in the 5th century ad). Realism mainly focuses on 
the military (and later on economic) power of states, their clashes, 
an attempt to understand what makes war ‘just’, and attempts to 
produce a balance of power as the main mechanism of conflict 
management.
Machiavelli, an Italian historian, politician, diplomat, and 
philosopher based in Florence during the Renaissance, argued in 
his famous book The Prince, published around 1532:
A wise prince ought to observe some such rules, and never in 
peaceful times stand idle, but increase his resources with industry 
in such a way that they may be available to him in adversity, so that 
if fortune changes it may find him prepared to resist her blows. 
(chapter XIV)
Nevertheless, the common view that the ancient period was 
defined by an acceptance of the inevitability of war is mistaken. 
Even Machiavelli, more often associated with power and interests, Defining peace
15
thought that elections were necessary and peace should be fair 
and voluntary.
Later, in the course of Enlightenment philosophy, Thomas 
Hobbes’s Leviathan (1588‒1671, 1651) set out social contract 
theory, including the need for political representation, individual 
rights, and notions of civil society. Drawing on his experience of 
the English civil war, Hobbes argued for a social contract between 
the population and an absolute sovereign (called a Leviathan after 
a biblical monster). He thought that preventing a ‘war of all 
against all’ required a Leviathan in the form of a strong central 
government.
Peace was understood in a relatively narrow way in realist 
thought, in which it was defined by merely the absence of open 
violence. Structural violence might remain. Key modern scholars 
and policy figures in this tradition, such as Henry Kissinger (born 
in 1923, a scholar and Secretary of State for Presidents Richard 
Nixon and Gerald Ford), influenced by experiences in the Second 
World War and during the Cold War, often saw peace mainly as a 
balance of power between states. They often drew on 18th- and 
19th-century European history.
There have long been challenges to political realism. An important 
approach draws on ancient critiques of militarism, following those 
of Confucius (a 6th-century bc Chinese philosopher), that war 
would not give rise to peace. Government should focus on the 
well-being of the people, not on making war. Given the legitimacy 
and attractiveness of peace, it has often been central to any 
civilization’s narrative about its place in the world. In the case of 
China, Confucius himself said that ‘pacific harmony’ bound society 
together. He offered his famous aphorism that peace extended 
from the heart to the family, then to society, and to the world. 
Daoism connected inner, social, and collective harmony, which 
also incidentally required a norm of non-interference. Even Peace
16
during the Warring States period of Chinese history, famous 
voices decried war (and the realist propositions of Sun Tzu) in 
favour of the merits of peace. Confucius’ focus on ‘civil virtues’ was 
the most famous of these: among other wise statements, he 
argued in his book Analects, ‘... [r]ecompense injury with justice, 
and recompense kindness with kindness’. His work has more 
recently been reclaimed as an emblem of modern China’s ‘peaceful 
development’.
Alternative approaches to realism developed early on. Respect, 
civil virtue, neighbourliness, cooperation, morality, trade, good 
governance, kinship, and treaties were motifs of early, more 
idealistic representations of peace. Another characteristic of early 
thinking on peace was the relationship with government and 
citizens, from Plato onwards. Peace was in the interests of a 
‘philosopher-king’ who exercises his judgement for the good of all, 
however difficult this may be, according to Plato’s Republic. In 
addition, in ancient Greek philosophy around the 3rd century bc, 
the Epicureans crystallized a growing concern with everyday 
conditions for ordinary people, and the Stoics rejected the 
passions of greed, anger, or lust, calling for self-discipline and 
solidarity. Even at this early stage, individuals were mobilizing for 
peaceful and improved political orders, realizing that their local 
and social environment was crucial, that peace required different 
types of approaches, and that it had implications for the design of 
the polity, as well as an international dimension.
These more idealistic approaches were associated with issues of 
abundance and dignity, as with the Greek goddess Eirene, who as 
the personification of peace was often depicted in art as a 
beautiful young daughter of Zeus, carrying a cornucopia. They 
also suggested a rejection of war and violence through various 
social strategies, as exemplified in Aristophanes’ comic play 
Lysistrata (411 bc) in which Lysistrata persuaded women to try to 
end the Peloponnesian War by withholding sexual privileges in 
order to force men to negotiate a peace settlement.Defining peace
17
Eventually there emerged a historical build-up of diplomatic 
peace treaties over time in ancient Greece, reflecting more 
idealistic as well as power-based understandings, aimed at 
creating a ‘common peace’. This path was opening up for a more 
cosmopolitan approach.
Another contribution drew on the thinking of the Christian 
philosopher Augustine, known as ‘just war’, which effectively 
limited the scope of war to certain specific situations. In his book 
The City of God, Augustine wrote:
A just war is wont to be described as one that avenges wrongs, when 
a nation or state has to be punished, for refusing to make amends 
for the wrongs inflicted by its subjects, or to restore what it has 
seized unjustly.
Thomas Aquinas (1225–74) later developed this in some detail. 
War was deemed just if it was in self-defence, punished 
aggression (but was not for revenge), was undertaken by the 
authorities, or was a last resort. It should ultimately make peace. 
This framework persisted in international relations, reinvented as 
humanitarian intervention and regime change war by the 1990s 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the 2000s in Iraq, respectively.
Modern theories of idealism and liberalism are closely related to 
these debates, and are often associated with Immanuel Kant and 
his plan for ‘Perpetual Peace’. During the 17th and 18th centuries 
debates about peace began to coalesce into what was then termed 
a ‘grand design’ in European political thought (as mentioned in 
the work of the Duc de Sully between 1638 and 1662). This laid 
the foundations of the UN system after 1945, and might now be 
thought of as an international peace architecture. F. R. Hinsley 
(1918–98) noted in the 1960s that much of the modern 
architecture for peacemaking dated from the 17th century, 
however, implying that further updating was required (and

The development of the concept of peace was enriched by Marxist 
thinking about oppression, power and class struggle, exploitation, 
and revolutionary change, driven, partly at least, by grassroots 
actors, social movements, and their networks. This has given rise 
to understandings of peace that included social justice and 
emancipation, with important implications for the poor, women, 
and children. Some would argue that this has over-complicated 
peace in practice, however, and that the idea of violent 
revolutionary change, associated with some variants of Marxism, 
presents a conundrum for peace, in that change is essential but 
only non-violence is consistent with peace. Gramscian 
understandings of the potential of mobilization of grassroots 
actors for their rights have also been important.
Liberal peace and beyond
Liberal peace theory suggested that democracy ensures that 
domestic politics within states are peaceful. Together with free 
trade, international law, and organization it also ensures that 
states do not then go to war with each other, following the sole 
‘law’ of international relations that democratic states do not fight 
each other. This argument has often been used as an explanation 
for the stability of Europe after the Second World War. It was also 
the model for the Western attempt to redevelop world order after 
the end of the Cold War. Though flawed it probably represents one 
of the most sophisticated large-scale forms in history.
The liberal peace framework can be broken down into a number 
of intellectual and practical traditions:
1. the victor’s peace in which a negative peace is imposed by a 
victor in war;
2. the constitutional peace in which democracy and free trade are 
taken to be fundamental qualities of any peaceful state’s 
constitution (contributing to a positive peace);Defining peace
19
3. the institutional peace, in which international institutions, such 
as the UN, international financial institutions (e.g. the Bretton 
Woods institutions), or state donors, act to maintain peace and 
order according to a mutually agreed framework of international 
law (contributing to a positive peace);
4. the civil peace tradition in which civil society organizations, 
NGOs, and domestic and transnational social movements seek to 
uncover and rectify historical injustice or processes that engender 
the risk of war (contributing to a positive peace).
The liberal peace has been supported by international institutions, 
which during the 20th century facilitated cooperation between 
states over problems such as disarmament and arms control and 
supported free trade and common norms, rules, and laws. Perhaps 
most importantly, it allowed for the development and spread of 
the concept of human rights, which created an expansionary effect 
around the world. When associated with peace and security, 
human rights underlined the contradictions of a very basic form of 
peace, and as with the Helsinki agreement of 1975 (‘The Final Act 
of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe’, 
Helsinki, Finland, 1 August 1975), pointed a route towards its 
improvement. There has been a political, policy, and scholarly 
consensus around these factors, especially in the global north. In 
the global south, however, there was also concern that many 
post-colonial and developing countries were not represented fairly 
and had often not benefited equally from global economic 
conditions. This concern dated back to the 1950s and the famous 
Bandung Conference in 1955, which brought together newly 
decolonized states in order to chart a way forward for the 
international system that was more appropriate for developing 
countries (Figure 1).
Such thinking has continued to evolve with the contributions of 
contemporary liberal thinkers (including the American scholars Peace
20
John Rawls, Michael Walzer, and Michael Doyle) and policymakers. 
It connected Kant’s liberal peace with broader questions of justice, 
as well as the capacity to wage ‘just war’. This could be seen in 
doctrines like ‘humanitarian intervention’ (the use of force by 
external actors to protect human rights) or ‘regime change’ 
(removing a regime responsible for threats to international or 
domestic peace and security), the former as in the Responsibility to 
Protect Doctrine of 2005, or the latter as with US President Bush’s 
invasion of Iraq in 2003. Because liberal contributions argued that 
peace may be legitimate if it supports the non-proliferation of 
weapons, human rights, democracy, and a rule of law, a confluence 
between liberal peace and intervention touched upon an old 
conundrum that pacifists and revolutionaries have long faced 
throughout history: is military intervention justified if it overturns 
domination and ends war to bring about peace?
A range of critical and post-colonial theorists foresaw the 
increasing demands made on the concept of peace. Some 
highlighted the rights and needs of humanity after colonialism, 
1. The Plenary Session of the Bandung Conference, 1955.Defining peace
21
problems arising from global capitalism and neoliberalism, the 
inherent biases of liberalism, and the capacity for peoples to 
mobilize for social justice, equality, and freedom. Among many these 
included: Paulo Freire (a Brazilian philosopher (1921–97), who 
wrote Pedagogy of the Oppressed); Frantz Fanon (a French-Algerian 
writer (1925–61), whose works inspired anti-colonial liberation 
movements); Homi Bhabha (a post-colonial theorist (1949–), 
who showed how hybrid political frameworks arise from the 
ways in which colonized peoples resist the power of the 
colonizer); and Amartya Sen (an Indian economist (1933–), who 
won the 1998 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics and helped 
to create the United Nations Human Development Index, which 
compares and ranks each country’s state of development). These 
more critical views of peace sought to uncover power and its 
workings and establish a fairer form of domestic and international 
politics, more likely to lead to a positive, or even hybrid, form 
of peace.
It is important to note a division in the contemporary 
understanding of peace amongst the various schools of peace 
studies around the world. Some see it as a contribution to 
maintaining the dominant liberal and capitalist world order, 
which for many outside the global north, however, means a 
negative peace. More critical approaches see peace as connected to 
global social justice and emancipation, meaning human rights, 
equality, solidarity, justice, and sustainability are required. Most of 
these arguments are critical of realist approaches to peace, 
indicating the necessity of social justice, participatory forms of 
democracy, human rights, equality, and autonomy. Some argue 
that no one perspective has a monopoly on defining peace. 
Multiple forms must therefore coexist, perhaps in a hybrid form of 
peace. This implies that the IPA does not represent a linear, 
historical development according to universal norms, but instead 
a more complex, interlocking system comprising very different 
types of political system.Peace
22
All of these strands of thought and practice have contributed to 
the historical evolution of an international peace architecture. 
However, the current fragility of the post-Cold War order has 
reopened the question of what is contemporary peace? Should it 
follow the Western model of liberal peace or are there other 
alternatives, perhaps emerging from East Asia or from the 
contributions of the global south? In the 21st century, so far a 
neoliberal peace appears to have become dominant in 
international policy, where the focus has been on trade wars 
between blocs and free-market reforms. However, this approach 
does not meet the standards required for human rights, or 
everyday and hybrid dimensions, as well as sustainability or 
justice, as suggested in the UN’s Sustaining Peace Agenda of 2018.23
Chapter 3
The victor’s peace in history
The victor’s peace evolved from the historical view that peace 
emerges from a complete military victory. It is reflected in the first 
stage in the modern IPA, in which geopolitical power politics are 
moderated by strategic and diplomatic balances of peace. This 
form of peace was coercive and often unjust but it could be 
orderly, for at least as long as the victor survived to underpin it. 
It might even provide the basis for a more sophisticated version to 
emerge, though most likely only after a major breakdown in the 
balance of power system (as with the First World War). It has long 
been thought to be the oldest concept of peace, foreshadowing the 
Darwinian notion of the survival of the fittest and implying war 
and violence was humanity’s natural condition.
This formulation implied military control or occupation, 
colonialism, or imperialism. Basic order was created through 
domination or alliances and a balance of power whereby states 
and leaders perceive war as too costly to win because of their 
opponent’s strength. Such thinking is well described by Johann 
Galtung’s much later formulation of a ‘negative peace’.
Historical emergence
The Roman destruction of the city of Carthage (149 bc), which is 
in modern Tunisia, is probably the best-known and earliest Peace
24
example of the victor’s peace. On the defeat of Carthage’s armies 
Rome declared that the city should be razed and its lands strewn 
with salt, thus attempting to remove it completely from the world 
map. Carthage has ironically been remembered precisely for this.
A victor’s peace needed more than force, however. It also needed 
law: the first emperor of the Babylonian empire placed stone 
tablets around his territories (c.1789 bc) outlining the terms of the 
peace in a ‘Code of Laws’, which he imposed after winning a war.
A victor’s peace was discussed in a range of ancient sources. 
Thucydides (460–c.395 bc), a Greek historian and Athenian 
general, wrote about his experiences in his book History of the 
Peloponnesian War, between Sparta and Athens. Athens was, 
before the war, the most powerful city-state in Greece, but after a 
series of failed peace treaties with Sparta was eventually beaten. 
Sparta became the leading city-state in turn. The war had a 
devastating economic impact and undermined the idea of 
democracy that Athens promoted, replacing it with Sparta’s 
authoritarian approach, and leading to repeated wars across the 
Hellenic world. Thucydides concluded that power determined 
international relations, though he also explored the problems 
faced by victims in the famous ‘Melian Dialogue’. The Athenians 
stated that:
the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they 
must.. .it is not as if we were the first to make this law, or to act 
upon it when made: we found it existing before us, and shall leave it 
to exist forever after us; all we do is to make use of it, knowing that 
you and everybody else, having the same power as we have, would 
do the same as we do.
A number of other historical sources laid out similar arguments 
and experiences. Sun Tzu, in his masterpiece of strategy The Art of 
War (5th century bc), laid out how wars could be won whilst also 
advocating cooperation and diplomacy with other states. The The victor’s peace in history
25
latter were also significant in Augustine’s The City of God
(5th century ad). For him war was representative of the ‘fallen 
condition’ of humanity. Nevertheless, war could be legitimately 
fought against the enemies of Christendom. War within 
Christendom was sinful, and so should be carefully conducted. 
The ‘city of god’ would be a Christian empire of peace, though it 
might not be peaceful in its dealings with non-Christians.
Refinement
Machiavelli’s seminal study The Prince (1513) outlined the 
justifications for using immoral means to achieve glory or survival. 
Thomas Hobbes’s Leviathan (1651) claimed that a ‘state of 
nature’—meaning ‘war of all against all’—could only be prevented 
by strong central government to which society is subservient. 
Abuses of power were the price of peace. These arguments 
grappled with the problem of which takes precedence: power, 
survival, or norms? Paradoxically, sometimes war was conducted 
for reasons of achieving peace of exclusive benefit to one or 
other group.
Francisco de Vitoria, a Spanish Renaissance philosopher and 
jurist who wrote about ‘just war’, thought that the stage was being 
set for a new era of victor’s peace: uninhabited lands were 
available for exploitation, providing a reason for a victor’s peace.
While Hobbes’s Leviathan argued that combating of the ‘state of 
nature’ mainly rested upon the interests and capacities of the 
‘Leviathan’ (this was a reference to a large sea monster, by which 
Hobbes meant a powerful actor), he was also aware of the need 
for consensus and legitimacy within society for any legitimate 
authority.
The colonial or imperial systems that arose from the power and 
interests of the European, industrializing states saw them take 
control of vast populations and swathes of land around the world Peace
26
for glory, profit, and to ‘civilize the native’. This was a kind of 
victor’s peace, based upon extraction, markets, taxation, war, and 
hegemony. The development of European colonialism and 
imperialism was predicated on the right of a ‘superior’ race to 
dominate those whom it identified as lesser.
England’s exploration of new sea routes during the Elizabethan 
era (1558–1603) led to a rapid realization of the potential for 
trade, and ultimately of the financial and military benefits of 
territorial acquisition and control. Implicit in this development 
was the relationship between war, trade, and peace in the colonies 
and dependencies. By the end of the 19th century, European 
imperialism came to be characterized less by the exploitation of 
a territory’s resources and inhabitants and more by a liberal 
‘civilizing mission’ (which also disguised its extractive 
underpinnings).
Massive industrialization amplified the capacity at the disposal of 
states and imperial powers to make war. Some states eventually 
drifted towards fascism as demands grew ever greater for 
territory, material resources, and markets. The state was a vital 
component of this extreme attempt to amass power so war could 
be used as a political tool. According to such arguments, war 
might also provide a context in which individuals demonstrated 
their capacity for an ethical life. In fact, peace for Hegel 
(1770–1831), a German philosopher, would only produce a 
‘corruption of nations’.
The balance of power system
Given that a victor’s peace was demonstrably a failure because 
power waxed and waned, an improvement was required, which 
emerged in the balance of power system that marked European 
politics for much of the 19th and early 20th centuries. This rested 
upon a system of alliances that maintained a negative peace 
between states and empires.The victor’s peace in history
27
In the 19th century, after the Napoleonic Wars, the main European 
powers had at the Congress of Vienna in 1815 established a 
‘Concert’ system of diplomacy aimed at balancing great power 
interests through diplomacy to avoid war. While rudimentary, it 
lasted for much of that century. It managed to mitigate geopolitical 
and imperial wars until it broke down at the start of the 20th 
century. However, it provided a geopolitical basis for future 
developments in creating a more sophisticated peace framework.
The weakness of such a system, as can be seen in early 20th-century 
European history, was that it was also susceptible to collapse. 
Alliances may maintain order but they may also be called upon for 
support against aggressive states as with Germany in 1914 and 
1939. Such conflicts may quickly escalate into regional or world 
wars as alliance systems are triggered, and because of which the 
previous international system and its empires may collapse.
The outbreak of war in 1914 was greeted with a general incredulity 
that ‘civilization’ could still conduct and tolerate war. As the ‘Great 
War’s’ associated direct and collateral costs mounted, it became 
clear that war had become an end in itself without any clear 
objectives or benefits. The First World War confirmed that 
large-scale industrialized war could not be won decisively, even at 
great cost. Indeed, any victor’s peace might be so costly that it 
would be meaningless.
The Versailles Settlement followed a victor’s peace, in that its 
terms were determined by US President Wilson’s ‘Fourteen 
Points’, but it also introduced new elements. They were designed 
to stabilize and augment the balance of power system of the 19th 
century, including self-determination and democracy. Yet the 
settlement also left a legacy of unsolved self-determination claims. 
As John Maynard Keynes (1883‒1946) foresaw in his book The 
Economic Consequences of the Peace (1919), the First World War’s 
victors forced the defeated Axis powers to accept terms that might 
lead to war restarting in the future. This illustrated both the aim Peace
28
of the victor’s peace—to remove the threat of the defeated 
forever—as well as its weaknesses—that somehow, in fact or in 
legend, they may rise again. As the victor’s power wanes, the latter 
becomes more likely.
Indeed, the European empires faded swiftly from the international 
stage after the end of the two world wars. These wars both drained 
their resources and strengthened local claims for self-determination 
in colonies around the world.
The inter-war drift back to a victor’s peace was to have a decisive 
effect on 20th-century history, however: not merely via its two 
industrial-scale world wars but more subtly on the new layers of 
peace architecture subsequently established after both world wars.
The creation of the League and later the UN offered the potential for 
new, more sophisticated advances in the practices of peacemaking 
but any progress was to be related to the continuing salience of 
geopolitics. Thus, NATO—a military alliance based on the North 
Atlantic Treaty of 1949—represented a collective security system 
designed to maintain the new order (it eventually included 
28 member states across North America and Europe, and an 
additional 22 countries involved in NATO’s ‘Partnership for 
Peace’). NATO was politically involved in the Cold War struggle, 
and intervened militarily during the break-up of Yugoslavia in 
Bosnia in the mid-1990s and again in Kosovo in 1999, invoking a 
brief doctrine of humanitarian intervention. NATO also perceived 
the 9/11 atrocities in New York as an attack on all its members 
and later intervened in Afghanistan through the NATO-led 
International Security Assistance Force. In 2011, it enforced a 
no-fly zone over Libya, following UN Security Council 
Resolution 1973.
In these terms, any limited peace was merely an interlude until 
the next armed confrontation over power, territory, and resources 
arose as Thomas Hobbes argued in his bleak book, LeviathanThe victor’s peace in history
29
(quoted above). The continued domination of the victor—often an 
empire, whether that of Alexander the Great, the Romans, British, 
or vis-à-vis super-power influence today—meant the peace it 
imposed was likely to survive any challenges, but for no longer 
than its power lasted.
Conclusion
The victor’s peace framework has many flaws: it is subject to the 
problem of territorial and strategic over-extension and has limited 
ability to control ‘unruly’ subjects. In particular, hegemonic 
powers are often surprised by local resistance to their rule, as 
occupying powers, imperialists and colonials have all experienced 
in recent history. Such resistance is often aimed at broadening 
peace through self-determination, improving human rights and 
the distribution of economic resources. It may include resistance 
to totalitarianism as with much of the resistance to the control of 
the Soviet Union (the Prague Spring in 1968, the Polish resistance 
to their own government in the 1980s, or the collapse of the 
Berlin Wall in 1989). It may be non-violent, as with Indian 
resistance to the British Empire in the early 20th century during the 
independence campaign. However, often it leads to insurgencies, 
as with the attacks against US and other foreign targets in the 
‘statebuilding’ mission in Afghanistan and Iraq in the 2000s. 
Indeed, power, however overwhelming in military, financial, 
political, or even normative terms, never quite seems to be enough 
to quell the local desire for autonomy, self-determination, and a 
positive form of peace. A lesson of history is that local consent and 
legitimacy are eventually needed for any victor’s peace to be 
maintained and for it to advance into a more sophisticated form, 
if at all possible. A victor’s peace may collapse if the hegemonic 
power loses interest in maintaining it or if resistance is 
widespread.30

Peace in history: towards 
the Enlightenment
War and violence are ever changing phenomena. There is a vast 
corpus of sources that make this clear: historical, social, religious, 
political and economic, artistic and cultural sources, as well as 
peace agreements, policies, theories, and philosophies. Early 
strands emerged in response to the limitations of the victor’s 
peace, and were drawn together in more complex ways after the 
Enlightenment.
Peace treaties influenced the story of human history as much as 
wars or the succession of kings, queens, emperors, dictators, or 
elected leaders. They spanned examples such as the Kadesh Treaty 
(around 1274 bc) (see Figure 2) between the Hittite and Egyptian 
Empires to the more recent Comprehensive Peace Agreement 
signed between the two Sudanese sides in 2005. The framework 
of a peace treaty was used to end wars and stabilize regions: 
famous examples include the Pax Nicephori of ad 803 between 
the Roman Emperor Charlemagne and the Byzantine Empire; the 
Treaty of Venice of 1177 between the Catholic Pope, the north 
Italian city-states of the Lombard League, and Frederick I, the 
Holy Roman Emperor; or the Treaty of Perpetual Peace between 
England and Scotland in 1502 (see Figure 3). Perhaps most 
significant was the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648, which brought to 
an end a cycle of European wars. Other examples include the Paris 
Peace Treaty, which gave independence to the USA from Britain in Peace in history
31
1783; the more famous Paris Peace Treaty at Versailles in 1919 
after the First World War; and the UN Charter in 1945, which was 
essentially a peace treaty for the modern world. Other recent 
examples include the Camp David Agreement between Egypt and 
Israel in 1978 that brought to an end a cycle of wars between 
them; the Oslo Accords between Israel and the Palestinians in 
1993; and the Dayton Agreement for Bosnia-Herzegovina in 1995, 
which through US pressure brought to an end the conflict 
between Serbs, Bosniacs, and Croats after three years of war.
Early strands: institutional and 
constitutional contributions
In ancient Mesopotamia, it was recognized that peace protects 
life, law, and customs, whereas war is aggressive and risks 
retaliation, as the Mosaic of Ur (c.2650 bc) portrays. Similarly, 
2. The Kadesh Treaty, from around 1274 bc, was one of the first ever 
recorded peace treaties between the Egyptian and Hittite Empires.32
3. The Treaty of Perpetual Peace signed by James IV of Scotland and Henry 
VII of England ended, for a time at least, 200 years of sporadic warfare 
between Scotland and England.Peace in history
33
in the heroic Mesopotamian poem Gilgamesh, the hero’s downfall 
is caused by his failure to preserve peace. The implication is clear. 
As in many of the world’s religions, a historical propensity 
towards non-violence (though sometimes after a victory in war), 
Enlightenment, honesty, and integrity are generally presented as 
crucial to a peace that begins with the community and everyday 
life and then extends into the wider world.
The Cyrus Cylinder (6th century bc) is thought to be an early 
Persian declaration of human rights, illustrating an understanding 
of the breadth of the concept. Peace was also represented in 
early political philosophy such as in the thought of Confucius 
(551 bc–479 bc) on the connection between harmony at the 
individual level, in society, and at the international level. In 
classical literature such as Aristophanes’ Lysistrata (c.411 bc), 
other dimensions were noted.
It was soon also apparent that peace processes and agreements 
were necessary to manage war and maintain order in the 
international system. In Plato’s (428/427 bc–348/347 bc) 
Republic, Socrates argued that truth represents an ideal form 
associated with ‘goodness’ which sits uncomfortably with a race 
for power.
Understandings of religious tolerance were also commonly 
connected with peace, represented for example in Christianity by 
non-violence and pacifism. Similarly, there are the Buddhist and 
Hindi notions of shanti and ahimsa, which represent first an 
inner peace and then a wider peace. Islam and Sufi offer an 
understanding of peace as an internal quest within everyone, 
which when achieved may lead to an ‘outer peace’. Hinduism, 
Buddhism, Christianity, Judaism, and Islam all make such claims 
in various different ways. Judaism associates peace with a 
sectarian identity within a universal peace. Christianity famously 
blessed its peacemakers in following suit. Islam demanded that 
any attempt at peacemaking should always be reciprocal and that Peace
34
individuals should be at peace before a wider peace can emerge. 
Most religions also warn of ‘false peacemakers’. By the 10th 
century onward, a movement organized by the Catholic Church 
called the ‘Peace of God’ lobbied feudal elites and warlords to 
commit to peace rather than war. By the 11th century, a number of 
peace councils had been held in France, which the Pope 
supported, even though the Crusades were in full swing. In the 
last years of the 12th century, Richard the Lionheart 
commissioned his knights to keep order across his kingdom, 
calling them ‘Justices of the Peace’. In the 13th century, the famous 
‘Prayer for Peace’ appeared (attributed to Francis of Assisi): ‘Lord, 
make me an instrument of Thy peace; where there is hatred, let 
me sow love .. .’ Many religious orders began to emphasize peace.
Another early dimension of peace arose from pacts and leagues 
formed both to stabilize political relations and enable trade, such 
as the Hanseatic League of the 12th century. This was a 
commercial and defensive confederation of merchant guilds that 
controlled trade from the Baltic to the North Sea during the 
13th–17th centuries. Others followed as European imperialism 
and colonialism gathered pace during the 16th and ensuing 
centuries, often between colonizers and local leaders, or between 
colonial powers that were seeking to demarcate their area of 
influence. Peace in these terms followed, and was secondary to, 
power and trade.
Perhaps one of the most famous early legal instruments of peace 
within a state was the English Magna Carta (1215). This bound 
even the king to the law (a radical idea in the 13th century), and 
introduced some basic aspects of human rights, including the 
principle of Habeas Corpus (meaning a citizen cannot be 
imprisoned without a fair trial) (see Figure 4).
Domestic peace was not the only preoccupation of government 
and law. Dante Alighieri, an early Florentine humanist, published 
an important book called On World Government in 1309, which 35

forming the basis for the rule of law.Peace
36
outlined how a world government and related justice system may 
resolve local conflicts, allowing each nation to develop its specific 
capacities in peacetime: ‘. .. [e]very kingdom divided against itself 
shall be laid waste .. .’ To prevent this, ‘. ..there must therefore be 
one person who directs and rules mankind, and he is properly 
called “Monarch” or “Emperor”. And thus it is apparent that the 
well-being of the world requires that there be a monarchy or 
empire’ (Book 1). The idea of a world government, bound by law, 
became a long-standing motif of many peace movements. The 
state, government, and a concept of the ‘international’ now began 
to emerge as recognized components of a broader approach 
to peace.
There has also always been an ‘art’ of peace, such as in 
Renaissance painter Ambrogio Lorenzetti’s Allegory of Good and 
Bad Government (1338–9) (see Figure 5). In two juxtaposed 
paintings he compared the beneficial and catastrophic effects of 
peace and war on a city, connecting peace not merely with the 
absence of war but the nature of political order.
Francisco de Vitoria (1483–1546), a Spanish Renaissance 
philosopher and jurist, explored the idea of the formation of a 
‘republic of the whole world’. He stated that the safety of 
diplomats should be assured, peace talks should be held to 
pre-empt conflict, and there should be a general acceptance of just 
terms. He also saw that it might be necessary to allow military 
intervention to prevent oppression. These terms should be the 
right of neutrality, safe passage, and restraint in the conduct of 
warfare (especially with regard to civilians).
By the 1500s, Erasmus had re-imagined a peace that rejected any 
order preserved by war, religion, or national identity. He was part 
of an emerging humanist tradition focused on how the internal 
structure of a state influenced its behaviour and how its Christian 
rulers should behave. His approach also called for binding 5. Lorenzetti’s Allegory of Good and Bad Government (1338–9) depicts the benefits of good government on a city.Peace
38
arbitration processes between states over their conflicts. In 
Erasmus’ play Complaint of Peace (1517), a personified Peace said:
. .. am I not praised by both men and gods as the very source and 
defender of all good things? What is there of prosperity, of security, 
or of happiness that cannot be ascribed to me? On the other hand, 
is not war the destroyer of all things and the very seed of evil?
This play was published one year after Thomas More (1478–1535), 
another famous English Renaissance philosopher and humanist, 
published Utopia (1516), which explored the possibility of 
achieving a political and social utopia. The book had a notable 
cover, which depicted the contradictions of utopia. Erasmus’ work 
also prepared the ground for Hugo Grotius (1583–1645), a Dutch 
jurist and philosopher, to develop international law.
International law was becoming an essential part of the 
international system and its approach to peace and the ‘Treaty of 
Universal Peace’ in 1520, negotiated by Cardinal Wolsey between 
England and France, offered hope that a wider European peace 
could for once be achieved. Erasmus went on to support, contra 
Machiavelli, welfare, representation, justice, laws, and education 
as essential to peace. He noted that ‘. .. [h]ardly any peace is so 
bad that it is not preferable to the most just war’.
There was a growing sense of how peaceful domestic and 
international order should be maintained. As representative 
political institutions in European states began to emerge, partly in 
response to social pressures and intellectual innovation, slowly 
replacing feudalism, parliaments began to emerge or re-form 
across Europe to assuage citizens who had begun to sense their 
capacity to lobby for, make, and preserve peace and social justice. 
Avoiding war, violence, conscription, and related tax burdens, as 
well as other indirect consequences of war, was becoming a 
political aim of increasingly demanding populations.Peace in history
39
Peace was often formally ‘made’ by enlightened political and social 
leaders, emerging from diplomatic, elite, and high-level 
negotiations. It also balanced with interests according to ‘red lines’ 
delineated by imperial and state power. A painting of the 
Somerset House Conference in 1604 in London that brought to an 
end a 20-year war between England and Spain commemorates 
this approach.
Developments in peace thinking and practice were also taking 
place further afield. In Japan, a neo-Confucian scholar and 
shogun, Tokugawa Ieyasu, laid the basis for the Tokugawa Peace, 
which lasted from 1603 to 1868. This period saw significant 
economic growth as well as cultural development, but Japan was 
also isolationalist and had a strict social order. European settlers 
and explorers in the Americas also encountered indigenous 
communities that followed historical non-violent codes of 
behaviour (which the settlers themselves did not follow or accept, 
however).40

Peace in modernity: 
the constitutional peace
Broader understandings of peace began to become more concrete 
with the emergence of stage two of the IPA after the First World 
War, drawing on intellectual work carried out from the 17th 
century onwards. The idea that peace could be constructed 
through law, institutions, rights, and prosperity, rather than by 
military power, emerged during and after the Enlightenment as 
an advance on the victor’s peace. This was partly in response to 
violent excesses of elite power and partly to satisfy growing 
mobilization for a range of rights from within society.
Much of the discussion was carried out in the realms of a growing 
civil society and a network of social movements, intellectuals, and 
scientists, before being adopted by political elites and influencing 
the nature of the states-system. This order was to be founded 
upon the creation of both a domestic political and legal architecture 
and an international architecture designed to balance the 
interests, needs, and rights of the population. It would have the 
significant benefit of making the international order more 
sustainable because it would be based upon a positive peace. This 
would be achieved via a domestic constitutional peace, debated 
since Plato, Pericles, and Aristotle’s discussions of the ‘good life’, 
and the merits of democracy versus the role of philosopher kings 
in ancient Greece. The theme of what shape good government 
should take was augmented by the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648, Peace in modernity
41
which connected the state to a peaceful and stable 
international order.
First steps
The flowering of peace thinking during the Enlightenment was 
intended to put an end to the lengthy and vicious cycle of elite-led 
or religious European wars (even if colonial wars further afield 
continued). Perhaps the most famous of the European peace 
treaties of this era was the Treaty of Westphalia. This was actually 
a series of peace treaties signed in 1648 in Osnabrück and 
Münster, which ended several connected wars (see Figure 6). 
These included the Thirty Years War (1618–48) of the Holy 
Roman Empire and the Eighty Years War (1568–1648) between 
Spain and the Dutch Republic. The treaty created a political order 
of sovereign states in Europe with the right of territorial integrity. 
It meant the state would not be subject to invasion or intervention

1648, by Gerard Ter Borch, The Netherlands, 1648.Peace
42
by other powers, a principle that still holds today (see UN Charter, 
Article 2/7). It was a precursor to future peace treaties, the 
development of international law and international organization, 
and the principle of self-determination.
The Enlightenment was partly the stimulus for an emerging idea 
that government, the state, and a system of international 
organizations should prioritize a general peace, rather than the 
vicarious interests of a few powerful actors in a Hobbesian ‘state 
of nature’ dominated by the Leviathan. Important contributions 
were made by Hugo Grotius and Emeric Cruce (1590–1648), the 
latter of whom published a book in 1623 subtitled ‘Establishing a 
General Peace and Freedom of Trade’, which castigated bigotry, 
glory, and profit-seeking through war. William Penn (1644–1718), 
a philosopher and founder of the Province of Pennsylvania, added 
his support for democracy and religious freedom. He began to 
develop ‘internationalist’ thinking, whereby international 
cooperation was deemed crucial for peace to emerge.
John Locke, an English philosopher regarded as one of the most 
influential of Enlightenment thinkers (1632–1704), offered the 
liberal idea that individualism, religious tolerance, and equality as 
well as consensual government were crucial for peace. Most 
important were law and civil society in his view:
And that all men may be restrained from invading others rights, 
and from doing hurt to one another, and the law of nature be 
observed, which willeth the peace and preservation of all mankind, 
the execution of the law of nature is, in that state, put into every man’s 
hands, whereby everyone has a right to punish the transgressors of 
that law to such a degree, as may hinder its violation...
(The Second Treatise of Civil Government, 1690)
William Penn’s essay ‘Towards the Present and Future Peace of 
Europe’ (1693) contributed to a discussion about how to organize 
a sustainable European peace through a parliament for Europe. Peace in modernity
43
Rousseau (1712–78), a Genevan political philosopher who 
influenced the French Revolution, and Kant turned their attention 
to the refinement of a particular genre of European peace plan. 
Rousseau introduced the element of a contract between rulers and 
the people designed to balance the stability of the state with 
security as well as personal liberty, arguing: ‘I prefer liberty with 
danger than peace with slavery.’
The constitutional peace
As the Enlightenment progressed the Hobbesian view that war 
was part of the natural fabric of international life, manipulated by 
Machiavellian princes, was replaced by the view that peace should 
be central to political life and institutions. Peace was achievable 
rather than merely an ideal to be aspired to—and this might be 
achieved by the concept of the nation-state and some form of 
international organization. Renaissance humanism (which 
developed during the 14th and 15th centuries ad) emphasized the 
need for a citizenry, including women, to engage in civic life in the 
state and follow virtuous courses of action. The liberalism that 
subsequently emerged challenged the idea that violence and war 
were part of the natural order of things. Peace could be the 
product of human ingenuity, especially if states and leaders could 
be sufficiently engaged with the latest thinking about the causes, 
types, and dynamics of violence. Enlightened actors with liberal 
views and objectives could now mitigate war, meaning that the 
behaviour of society and states could be moderated by new 
political systems and tools such as diplomacy and law, social 
movements, civil society, as well as external tools of intervention 
in crises.
Another important contribution was the historical argument that 
‘just war’ should be waged by a legitimate authority only as a last 
resort and in response to an act of unjustified aggression. This 
had two effects: one, a growing concern with the nature of the 
type of state that would not be warlike, and two, an interest in Peace
44
international organization and institutions designed to 
prevent war.
The constant religious wars of that era in Europe were eventually 
brought to an end by an agreement along these lines, involving 
territorial states whose sovereignty might not be violated by other 
states. The implications were that territorial states and their 
international arrangements were necessary for a peace built either 
on common values or on an agreement to differ. Thus, the 
understanding of peace developed into a balance of power 
between states, guaranteed through international treaties and 
alliances, as was endorsed by the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648.
Clearly, this was not enough, and new thinking laid the 
constitutional foundations for stage two in the development of the 
architecture. Soon after Westphalia, John Locke argued that a 
law-based government would produce consensus, legitimacy, and 
therefore a domestic peace. A social contract was required in 
order to cement a consensual and representative relationship 
between leaders and society, the state providing security and 
acting as a ‘neutral judge’ to protect the lives, liberty, and property 
of citizens.
Free trade also emerged as an important component of the 
constitutional peace. Adam Smith’s Wealth of Nations (1776) 
argued that international trade should be the basis of cooperation, 
prosperity, and peace between and within states.
The most substantial contribution came from Immanuel Kant, in 
his book Perpetual Peace. He based his subsequent understanding 
of peace upon the argument that even small-scale war or violence 
would escalate or echo around the world. He responded by 
suggesting the creation of just laws that would be reflected in a 
‘republican’ or democratic political order. These conditions would 
crucially also prevent war between states. Perpetual Peace laid out 
the conditions through which an early form of social justice could Peace in modernity
45
be attained within states and peace could be achieved between 
states (later to be reflected in the UN Charter in 1945).
Kant’s view was much more complicated than the geopolitical 
balancing system of stage one, however, which effectively 
mitigated power relations in the 19th century, but did little to 
resolve them. Kant argued that:
The universal and lasting establishment of peace constitutes not 
merely a part, but the whole final purpose and end of the science of 
right as viewed within the limits of reason.
Kant’s point-by-point articulation of a peaceful world order was as 
follows:
(1) No conclusion of Peace shall be held to be valid as such, when it 
has been made with the secret reservation of the material for a 
future War.
(2) No State having an existence by itself—whether it be small or 
large—shall be acquirable by another State through inheritance, 
exchange, purchase or donation.
(3) Standing Armies shall be entirely abolished in the course 
of time.
(4) No National Debts shall be contracted in connection with the 
external affairs of the State.
(5) No State shall intermeddle by force with the Constitution or 
Government of another State.
(6) No State at war with another shall adopt such modes of hostility 
as would necessarily render mutual confidence impossible in a 
future Peace . . .
He added the requirements that:
The Civil Constitution in every State shall be Republican [meaning 
democratic].Peace
46
The Right of Nations shall be founded on a Federation of 
Free States.
The Rights of men as Citizens of the world in a cosmo-political 
system, shall be restricted to conditions of universal Hospitality.
He called for the creation of an international organization 
to promote world peace, and for states to adopt democracy 
and human rights (which eventually emerged after the 
First World War). This was crucial to the peace movements of 
the 20th century and since. It foreshadowed the establishment 
of international organization after the Second World War and a 
range of institutions, from the UN system to the EU and the 
African Union, as well as the contemporary mechanisms of 
peacemaking, peacebuilding, statebuilding, and humanitarian 
intervention. It became the basis for the democratic or liberal 
peace after the end of the Cold War. Kant wrote:
[I]f the consent of the citizens is required in order to decide that 
war should be declared (and in this constitution it cannot but be the 
case), nothing is more natural than that they would be very cautious 
in commencing such a poor game, decreeing for themselves all the 
calamities of war. Among the latter would be: having to fight, 
having to pay the costs of war from their own resources, having 
painfully to repair the devastation war leaves behind, and, to fill up 
the measure of evils, load themselves with a heavy national debt 
that would embitter peace itself and that can never be liquidated on 
account of constant wars in the future.
Following these constitutional strands of thinking about peace 
and order, Jeremy Bentham (1748–1832), a British philosopher 
and social reformer, added a concern with a number of social 
issues: welfare, economic freedom, the separation of church and 
state, freedom of expression, equal rights for women, and the 
abolition of slavery and the death penalty. He offered the 
utilitarian insight for government that the greatest happiness for 
the greatest good would lead to peace, as the British economist Peace in modernity
47
David Ricardo (1772–1823) confirmed in an economic sense. 
Despite the criticism from British economist Thomas Malthus 
(1766–1834), who believed that surplus populations would lead to 
unsustainable development, resource depletion, and war, the free 
trade argument continued to be an essential pillar of the emerging 
version of peace. However, it was propagated through an 
uncomfortable mixture of British liberalism and colonialism until 
the 20th century.
Liberal thinking was beginning to crystallize into more than 
speculation: John Stuart Mill (1806–73), a British philosopher, 
connected development with peace, individual liberty, and private 
property. He claimed that peace lay in both the protection of 
individual freedoms and the existence of effective government, 
essentially forming a constitutional peace framework that would 
create a positive social contract between citizen and state and, 
through international cooperation and trade, pacify geopolitics.
In the 20th century the democratic peace argument came to be 
regarded as one of the only ‘laws’ of international relations. After 
the end of the Cold War it has been defined by democracy, free 
trade, and human rights, as Francis Fukuyama notably described 
in his essay ‘The End of History and the Last Man’ (1989), which 
celebrated the potential for the spread of democracy after the end 
of the Cold War. This became firmly embedded in the overall 
international architecture of peace, in many states’ constitutions, 
international law, the role of donors, the UN, International 
Nongovernmental Organizations (INGOs), and International 
Financial Institutions (IFIs) like the World Bank. As a result, 
many of the world’s states that have emerged from imperial 
war, world war, wars of decolonization, and from the collapse 
of communism have liberal-democratic institutions and 
constitutions (63 per cent according to Freedom House in 2013 at 
its peak, but declining ever since then), which also involve a 
commitment to human rights. It is notable that the European 
Union today owes a great deal of its constitutional structure to the Peace
48
Enlightenment peace projects, which promoted the 
constitutional peace.
Several states went even further during the last century in their 
pursuit of peace: according to German Basic Law, Germany is not 
allowed to have offensive armed forces (a relic of Allied occupation 
after the Second World War); Japan (at least until recently) is said 
likewise to have a ‘peace constitution’, and other countries like 
Costa Rica have completely dismantled their armed forces.
Limitations
The problem with Kant’s assumption that states act to maximize 
the interests of their own peoples (where they treat them as means 
rather than ends) is that states and elites may be predatory actors 
instead. The line between contributing to peace and following a 
nationalist or elite interest was, and is, finely drawn. The emergence 
of nationalism was also a consequence of what John Stuart Mill 
identified as the right of people to determine their own government. 
This may mean pursuing a national interest and identity not 
necessarily commensurate with regional or international peace or 
universal norms. As the principle of national self-determination 
gained popular appeal in the last 100 or so years, especially during 
the dissolution of the Ottoman and Austro-Hungarian, French, 
British, and other European empires after the First and Second 
World Wars, and at the end of the Cold War (e.g. in the Balkans), 
the concepts of both nationalism and ethno-nationalism became 
associated with the foundations not of order but of war. This soon 
became a spark for war between groups laying claim to the same 
territory. It continues to do so in the contemporary era, as in the 
cases of Cyprus, Sudan, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Israel/Palestine, 
and others.
Another concern has been that the constitutional peace has been 
characterized as a Eurocentric enterprise, and its secular nature 
was problematic for many. Nevertheless, the democratic or liberal Peace in modernity
49
peace argument does seem to have held. One of the most 
significant exceptions has been that democracies may still fight 
wars against non-democracies, for a range of reasons, as the cases 
of military intervention in Afghanistan and Iraq in the early 
2000s illustrated. The democratic peace framework also assumes 
conflict-affected states will evolve into democracies. This has 
often not been the case, however, and many peace processes are 
hindered by wars or authoritarianism, as with Cambodia or in the 
Israel‒Palestine conflict. In addition, the constitutional peace 
focused on an elite-level official discourse by state and government, 
and is geographically and temporally bounded by territorial 
sovereignty. It continues to be underpinned by the victor’s peace 
and the use of force.
As a further caveat, Kant once remarked that perpetual peace
might turn out to be rather unpleasant. Incessant materialism and 
the related consumption of raw materials might ultimately lead to 
a hollow victory and even to environmental collapse. In practice 
the application of the constitutional peace has often been blocked 
by actors who do not want to share power and who oppose 
domestic legal structures that might outlaw their authoritarian or 
corrupt activities. This has not changed since Hitler and Mussolini 
ignored the League of Nations in the 1920s and 1930s, or when 
Saddam Hussein ignored the UN over his invasion of Kuwait in 
the 1990s and blocked inspections of his possible weapons of mass 
destruction programme in the early 2000s.50
Chapter 6
The next step: an institutional 
peace
The 19th-century English poet Alfred, Lord Tennyson (1809–92) 
lauded the potential of international cooperation and law (as well 
as making an implicit reference to democracy) in his poem 
‘Locksley Hall’ (1837–8):
Till the war-drum throbb’d no longer, and the battle-flags were furl’d,
In the Parliament of man, the Federation of the World.
He pointed to an institutional form of peace, which has been very 
significant in the modern era, and also fundamental to stage two 
in the development of the IPA. The role of international institutions 
and law in supporting the consolidation of a constitutional peace 
within and between states represented the next step in building a 
positive peace. The institutional peace began to develop around 
the same time as the constitutional peace became prominent, 
during the Enlightenment. By the second half of the 20th century 
the UN, international donors, international law, and a range of 
regional actors, notably the EU and the African Union, coalesced 
around a more dynamic approach with the aim of creating a 
wide-ranging positive peace.
The institutional peace aims to anchor states within a specific set 
of values and a shared legal context through which they agree The next step
51
multilaterally how to behave. They also agree to police and enforce 
that behaviour on the part of ‘renegade’ states. Before the era of 
states, kings and queens tried to achieve this through alliances, 
peace treaties, marriages, trusteeships, and other forms of political 
relationship. Alexander the Great (356–323 bc) used many of 
these techniques to hold together his expanding empire. Two 
millennia later, the leaders of the emerging states in Europe began 
to institutionalize recurrent high-level diplomatic conferences. 
These were often held to debate matters of war and peace and so 
were perceived as a way out of the cycles of violence that the 
victor’s peace had given rise to.
An emerging set of intentional institutions were created to cement 
a stable international order, complementary to the growing belief 
that liberal democratic states were less likely to go to war with 
each other. If states share common goals of peace and free trade, 
they may organize themselves into an international community 
(and may even submit themselves to world government or a world 
federation, as many early 20th-century idealists hoped, including 
writers such as H. G. Wells (1866–1946)). The IPA was becoming 
more substantial, enabling states and empires to balance their 
interests and find agreement about, and follow, international 
norms and international law.
The early development of international 
institutions
The institutional peace is part of a cosmopolitan ethic dating back 
to Diogenes the Cynic (c.412–323 bc), who declared himself a 
cosmopolitan. This idea posited that despite people’s many 
differences a universally shared morality as well as international 
cooperation was possible, and that a world government might 
eventually be desirable. It found its contemporary character in the 
peace project associated with the Enlightenment. The Grotian 
discourse on natural law also made an important contribution, Peace
52
dictating coexistence and non-intervention between states. States 
have a right of self-defence following ‘just war’ thinking.
The formation of institutions intended to prevent war gathered 
pace almost simultaneously. Much of its progress followed 
the ideas of 17th-century philosophers such as the Duc de 
Sully’s (1560–1641) work on a ‘grand design’. This was a plan 
to stop religious war, start an international organization 
consisting of European powers, operate a balance of power 
mechanism via a permanent assembly of ambassadors, and 
dissolve the European empires. The plan influenced Kant’s 
work, illustrating how international institutions could solve 
the dangerous instability of the stage one balance of power 
mechanism, as was soon apparent after 1815. Diplomacy, 
international institutions, law, connected to public opposition to 
violence were crucial.
The Abbé de Saint-Pierre (1658–1743), an influential French 
writer, proposed in his book Project for Perpetual Peace (1713) an 
international organization responsible for maintaining peace. This 
was the start of a formal Enlightenment genre of peace projects, 
spurring Kant and others to develop these ideas further in the face 
of continuing European wars. Saint-Pierre’s peace plan was 
essentially a European treaty for a federation of states, in which 
law would be founded upon justice, equality, and reciprocity. 
Saint-Pierre called for the Christian (and also Muslim) sovereigns 
of Europe to form a permanent union for peace and security. This 
organization would not intervene in the affairs of member states 
but would have intelligence and self-defence capacities and might 
even send in troops to preserve peace.
William Penn also wanted to see a form of European parliament, 
in order to achieve ‘peace with justice’, and Kant insisted that the 
rule of law envisaged by the democratic, constitutional peace he 
had argued for should be extended to international relations. The next step
53
This fell short of the establishment of a world government, but 
instead suggested a multilateral system of states:
Reason would drive [states] to give up their savage lawless 
freedom, to accommodate themselves to public coercive laws, and 
thus to form an ever-growing State of Nations, such as would at 
last embrace all the Nations of the Earth. But as the Nations, 
according to their ideas of international Right, will not have such 
a positive rational system, and consequently reject in fact what is 
right in theory, it cannot be realised in this pure form. Hence, 
instead of the positive idea of a Universal Republic—if all is not 
to be lost—we shall have as result only the negative surrogate of a 
Federation of the States averting war, subsisting in an external 
union, and always extending itself over the world.
(Kant, Perpetual Peace)
A controversial issue was and is whether this takes the form of a 
multilateral system of states or a world government. Kant feared 
that a world government would be as unpleasant as a Hobbesian 
world as it might culminate in worse despotism through the 
concentration of powers in one central government. Thus, 
Perpetual Peace eventually found itself reflected in the UN 
Charter, but as Kant specified, international order rests at best on 
a federation of free states. Furthermore, he argued, these should 
abolish war and offer non-citizens ‘universal hospitality’. 
International trade would also be beneficial.
Several steps occurred in the development of the institutional 
peace framework. The Treaty of Westphalia (1648) created an 
unstable states system as a response to Europe’s religious wars, 
but also provided an impetus for international organizations to 
develop in order to maintain peace between states. The Congress 
of Vienna in 1815 saw a system of international institutions begin 
to become a reality to deal with the states system’s inconsistencies, 
as seen in the Napoleonic Wars and the race for European Peace
54
domination that caused them. The Congress of Vienna represented 
the attempt of statesmen such as Metternich, Castlereagh, and 
Talleyrand to create a realist balance of power which, however, 
depended upon their capacity for diplomacy and to intervene in 
the affairs of other states. It was primarily an instrument of 
British ‘order creation’ and thus was very close to also being a 
victor’s peace despite its institutionalization upon the 
European stage.
These developments were indicative of a growing rejection of the 
idea that war was endemic and inevitable. The conservatives and 
liberals of this era saw peace and war in different ways. The 
conservatives believed that peace lay in the preservation of the 
existing order, perhaps through the use of war, and certainly 
through a class system and gender and racial hierarchies. Liberals 
believed that peace would be achieved through a transformation 
brought about by economic and social progress, for which war 
(and possibly the state) was an unwanted obstacle. Nationalists 
formed a third grouping, believing that nations had a right to 
self-determination and potentially to dominate other states, 
through the use of force if necessary.
Peace in 19th-century Europe was disrupted by the growing forces 
of nationalism and by the constant imperial and colonial conflicts 
fought in North America, Asia, and Africa in search of an empire. 
Wars glorified nationalism, preserved the wealth of the old 
conservative order, and were part of a civilizing mission for 
liberals. Industrialization was also making the scale of war greater 
and far more deadly than ever before.
Disparate reforms and dynamics assisted the emergence of the 
institutional peace. Disarmament and rights campaigns were 
often largely run from within civil society, but often became 
internationalized through rudimentary networks, sometimes also 
connected to state-run humanitarian campaigns. These began to 
coalesce. For example, from 1816 to the 1860s Britain deployed The next step
55
a naval squadron against slave trading on the west coast of 
Africa. This reversal in the British approach to slavery meant a 
reinterpretation of international law to allow vessels to be boarded 
and searched. For the first time, perhaps, a humanitarian 
principle took precedence over the interests of the powerful, 
which would henceforth be crucial for the emerging set of 
international institutions.
Another dimension was provided by Henri Dunant’s work leading 
to the Geneva Convention of 1864, and the creation of the 
International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) gave rise to 
what is now known as international humanitarian law. The ICRC 
is the oldest humanitarian organization, and is charged with the 
mandate (through international treaty) of being the custodian of 
the laws of war.
By the turn of the century, the idea of liberal internationalism 
appeared to be gathering pace. Major peace conferences were held 
at The Hague in 1899 and 1907, which also led to the eventual 
establishment of the Permanent International Court of Justice in 
1922. In 1910 a Universal Peace Congress examined the need for 
international law, self-determination, and an end to colonialism. 
In 1913, another disarmament congress followed to mark the 
opening of the Peace Palace in The Hague, funded by the American 
industrialist Andrew Carnegie. Yet, in reality, during the early 
20th century, it was also readily apparent that Europe and the 
world were sliding towards a major war and the existing tools for 
peacemaking were too limited to prevent it.
The institutional peace after the First World War
The institutional peace framework gained its most sophisticated 
apparatus after the world wars of the 20th century. US President 
Wilson’s ‘Fourteen Points’ presented at the Versailles peace talks 
after the First World War were foundational in the emergence of a 
modern notion of peace with both institutional and constitutional Peace
56
dimensions. He called for the foundation of the League of Nations 
to guarantee the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all states. 
The League was to be an international mechanism of conflict 
management that should prevent war for the successor states of 
many of the now collapsing empires.
The post-First World War settlement was guided by the principle 
that territorial adjustments should be of benefit to the populations 
concerned—in other words, self-determination. Wilson believed 
that this represented a peace without victory: yet it also represented 
a unilateral American pronouncement. The Versailles Treaty 
accentuated democratization within a state framework and 
regulated interstate relations, thus combining a constitutional and 
institutional framework for peace. President Wilson had in mind 
an ‘ultimate peace of the world’ reminiscent of Kant’s perpetual 
peace. It was to rest on a ‘community of power’ and represented 
an ‘organised common peace’ to lay to rest the failures of 
imperialism, geopolitics, and fix the balance of power system of 
stage one of the IPA. It was to be a ‘peace without victory, a 
peace among equals’. Wilson told the US Congress early in April 
1917 that the ‘world must be made safe for democracy’. Perhaps 
most importantly a form of social justice was now being seen as 
essential to a universal peace and rights were becoming more 
prominent.
As it transpired Versailles was regarded as a victor’s peace, and 
this was its fatal flaw. This was exactly the fear underlying 
Keynes’s famous critique, specifically of the War Guilt Clause 
(Article 231), which blamed Germany for aggression, and of the 
level of reparations to be paid by Germany. The way in which the 
Allies had established agreements while applying blame and 
financial responsibility to Germany and its allies meant that there 
would not be a stable peace resulting from the treaty. German 
democracy would be ‘annihilated’ in the very process of trying to 
construct it. Some commentators, like E. H. Carr (1892‒1982), The next step
57
who was a British delegate at the Versailles conference, believed 
the emerging institutional peace to be utopian and implausible.
There were also other competing versions of dynamics in the 
post-war order. One was based upon the notion of a historical 
dialectic of progress and a classless society, supported by the 
Soviet Union. Others derived from imperialism and nationalism 
and the decolonization of empire. The major obstacle to Wilson’s 
new layer of the IPA was that no state was prepared to take 
responsibility or provide guarantees for it. The US Congress did 
not want to be responsible at this level; Britain, France, and 
Germany still harboured their antipathies to each other; some 
statesmen and politicians still sought to justify imperialism and 
colonialism; Soviet Russia was concerned with its own revolution; 
militant nationalism was on the rise in Japan and elsewhere; and 
the collapse of the Ottoman and Austro-Hungarian Empires had 
left significant spoils to be fought over. The peace architecture that 
had been created at Versailles was deeply flawed in practice, and 
was made even more fragile by the financial crises of the late 
1920s, which created socio-economic difficulties at a time when 
radical ideologies were making themselves widely felt.58
Chapter 7
A radical phase: a civil peace 
and social advocacy
The discussion of peace had by the 19th century ceased to be 
dominated by kings, philosophers, religious figures, or political 
theorists. With the birth of an array of social movements, activists, 
and advocates for peace, involving ordinary people who were 
determined to wrest the power to make war away from elites, it 
became clear that peace partly lay in their hands too. Yet, at this 
point such actors were not included in what was essentially a 
geopolitically organized peace architecture.
The importance of social advocacy
It is important to note the significance of the American 
Revolution, which from 1774 rejected European aristocratic forms 
of leadership, in favour of republicanism and liberalism. Social 
mobilization for peace stimulated liberal political declarations 
such as the US Declaration of Independence (1776), where the 
rights of men were laid out succinctly (life, liberty, and the pursuit 
of happiness) (see Figure 7). Similarly, the French Revolutions 
from 1789 saw the monarchy replaced by popular mobilization for 
similar principles of equality, citizenship, democracy, secularism, 
and basic human rights. These Western revolutions sought to 
devolve power to the population away from the lineage of royalty 
or colonialism, to attain personal freedom and representative 
government. Consequently, in the light of the realization of the A radical phase
59
potential of the political role of the individual and the possibilities 
of mass mobilization, often in non-violent ways, non-state actors 
began to gain a significant political role. This was by campaigning 
for more rights, against multiple forms of discrimination, and for 
humanitarian assistance.
Momentum grew in the 19th century through the creation of the 
ICRC, the mobilization of various social justice-oriented 
movements, the abolition of the slave trade by the English 
Parliament in 1807, the campaigns for and introduction of voting 
7. The Declaration of Independence also brought to an end the war 
between the 13 American colonies and Great Britain in 1776.Peace

rights, the development of international law, and the growing 
popularity of disarmament campaigns. Many other activities 
organized by non-state actors were aimed at political, social, and 
economic reform.
Historically, a mixture of social movements have contributed to 
pressure for a significant change in politics and social structures, 
often in response to long-standing political, social, and economic 
inequalities across and between societies. This indicated that 
peace required changes to the nature of political authority, the 
state, and the international order itself. Such movements followed 
on from the success of the civil society movements against slavery 
in the 19th century and began to organize and mobilize across a 
range of other issue areas, most notably for disarmament by the 
end of the century. In Britain, the Chartists, an amalgam of 
working-class organizations which desired political reform in 
Britain between 1838 and 1848, published their agenda for 
universal suffrage (for men at least), regular elections, and a 
professional political cohort (as opposed to a landed aristocracy). 
There was a socialist tinge to such developments along the path to 
social justice, whereby society and individuals pressed for equality 
rather than hierarchy, and from the perspective of the ‘proletariat’ 
aimed to resist exploitation and create a classless society.
Karl Marx’s (1818–83) work was instrumental in the development 
of the socialist movement and its internationalization. He outlined 
the problems of industrialization and capitalism from the 
perspective of the ‘working classes’. In his book with another 
revolutionary socialist, Friedrich Engels, The Communist 
Manifesto (published in 1848), Marx criticized the structural 
oppression that capitalism and the old feudal system represented, 
supporting the provision of better conditions and rights for 
workers. He was, however, ambivalent about whether peaceful or 
revolutionary means were necessary. Such sentiments also 
reflected a broader social dissatisfaction with the hierarchical 
organization of power and class in the industrializing West, with A radical phase
61
implications for both war and peace, imperialism, capitalism, and 
the state. His thought was also influential for many societies after 
waves of decolonization in the 1950s and 1960s. Many social 
movements challenged existing closed political orders (often seen 
as a communitarian form of politics), imperialism, inequality, and 
discrimination, and advocated for shared norms and coexistence 
(cosmopolitanism, or later ‘pluriversalism’). Social advocacy 
opened up social justice issues, which also would ultimately 
connect global justice with peace.
A major international peace conference in Britain in 1843 saw 
support for free trade, pacifism, and peaceful means of conflict 
resolution begin to coalesce. Another conference was held in Paris 
the following year. Richard Cobden (1804–65), one of the great 
English liberal thinkers of the day, and Victor Hugo (1802–85), 
the French poet and novelist, were in attendance, illustrating the 
breadth of the appeal of such ambitions. At this meeting, the pace 
and pressures of development, the shrinking of the world due to 
better transport and communication, the need for mediation 
systems between great powers, and the dangerous habit of raising 
loans for wars were all discussed. There was disagreement, 
however, over the mutually exclusive agendas of disarmament, 
pacifism, the maintenance of security, and self-determination, 
which divided participants (and continue to do so). However, 
concerted international attention was turning to the creation and 
consolidation of mechanisms, devices, and tools to deal with 
different elements of war, as well as to maintain order and make 
peace. This included international law and institutions, mediation 
and diplomacy, disarmament, the nature of the political economy 
of the international and states system, and social mobilization. 
These efforts were developing across politics, security, law, and 
economic issues areas, also incorporating social and artistic 
endeavours.
Organizations like the Fabian Society, founded in England in 
1884, worked at improving social and working conditions and Peace
62
tempered any revolutionary intent with a Christian ethos. Even so, 
it was the implications of such thinking about social justice, 
spanning human rights and representation to a fairer distribution 
of power and resources across society, as well as disarmament, 
that produced one of the most powerful reformist dynamics of the 
19th and 20th centuries. As such thinking developed, however, it 
began to raise concerns about the nature of the international 
system, and in particular (after the attempts to end slavery in the 
19th century) the links between capitalism and colonial, imperial, 
and racial frameworks of politics. Peacemaking had ramifications 
for the nature of the state and the international system itself, and 
in the 19th century both were increasingly seen as anachronistic in 
ethical terms.
One solution to these endemic problems was non-violence. 
Pacifist movements were sometimes related also to various 
long-standing peace churches, notably the Quaker and Mennonite 
movements, dating back to the 16th century. They have made an 
important contribution, as have public debates about non-violent 
resistance, the actions of conscientious objectors, civil disobedience, 
and various forms of anarchism. Pacifism is often equated with 
peace movements (though not all are pacifist because some argue 
that there are occasions—such as for self-defence, to resist 
oppression, genocide, or imperialism—where violence may be 
justified). In general pacifists oppose war and violence of all sorts. 
Pacifism has been a feature of human history and all of the 
different world religions. Tolstoy’s and Thoreau’s writings on the 
need for pacifism and on civil disobedience become especially 
significant during this period. Leo Tolstoy (1828–1910) was the 
Russian author of War and Peace, and a noted moral thinker and 
social reformer, often described as a ‘Christian anarchist’ and 
pacifist. Tolstoy became famous for opposing militarism through 
civil disobedience and non-violent resistance. Henry David 
Thoreau (1817–62), an American philosopher, also published an 
important essay, ‘Civil Disobedience’, in which he called upon 
individuals to resist unjust states:A radical phase
63
If a thousand men were not to pay their tax bills this year, that would 
not be a violent and bloody measure, as it would be to pay them, and 
enable the State to commit violence and shed innocent blood. This is, 
in fact, the definition of a peaceable revolution, if any such is possible.
Increasingly, non-violent resistance aimed to overcome inequality 
and injustice and was deployed by large social interest groups. 
Ideas on non-violent resistance were to have a profound impact 
on Mahatma Gandhi (1869–1948) during the Indian independence 
struggle from the British Empire in the first half of the 20th 
century, and also on Martin Luther King, Jr (1929–68), during his 
civil rights struggle in the USA.
Another aspect of peace thought emerged from the work of one of 
the key early thinkers in the anarchist tradition, Pierre-Joseph 
Proudhon. He argued in his study War and Peace (1861) that 
nation-states and the principle of private property would 
undermine peace. He thought that anarchism should be 
non-violent and systems of mutualism (whereby labour would 
receive a fair recompense rather than make profit for capitalists) 
should take over the formal processes of the state.
Similar themes were on the agenda of the First and Second 
Internationals (1864–76 and 1889–1916) towards the end of the 
19th century, which brought together a range of socialist and 
labour parties from around 20 different countries, to promote the 
rights of workers. Working men’s associations, trade unions, 
socialists, and communists around the world, but most notably in 
Britain, tried (often unsuccessfully) to develop a united front on 
matters such as working rights and hours, gender equality, and a 
limited anti-war stance. Peace was beginning to be connected with 
the development of capitalism and its modes of production and 
was being contested on ideological grounds.
By the end of the 19th century, the emerging peace movements 
had involved or gained the attention of millions of people. Peace
64
They increasingly refused to be passive actors in elite-led imperial 
or colonial wars and began to develop a range of political, 
philosophical, economic, and social arguments and tools against 
war, to be used for a better framework of peace. Various ‘friends of 
peace’ movements in the West laid the basis for an organized 
peace movement to emerge. In Britain and the USA, they united a 
range of thinkers, religious movements, labourers, scientists, 
writers, economists, social reformers, and activists. Their aim was 
to prevent rulers from seeing only benefit in war, but also to 
realize the potential of peace as well as popular demand for it. The 
Quakers, for example, equated pacifism and peace with religious 
positions connected to a broader struggle for justice and welfare 
(and today they quietly support civil society and formal peace 
processes throughout the world).
The increasingly industrial-scale conflicts of the 19th century, 
from the Crimean War to various Franco-Prussian wars from the 
1850s to the 1870s, led to the emergence of another important 
strand of peace architecture. This lay in the beginnings of 
humanitarian law and of humanitarian relief organizations, 
notably the Red Cross. In 1859 Henri Dunant, a Swiss 
businessman, was an incidental witness of war. Horrified by his 
experience of the Battle of Solferino, he inspired the establishment 
of the International Red Cross in Geneva in 1863. The subsequent 
first Geneva Convention called for the humane treatment of all 
involved in war, including prisoners and humanitarian workers. It 
required that the Red Cross, a neutral international humanitarian 
relief agency, should have free access to war zones and its neutrality 
be respected by warring governments. Dunant was to be a joint 
recipient of the first Nobel Peace Prize in 1901.
The various 19th-century peace movements culminated in a number 
of congresses, movements, meetings, and conferences, including 
the 1899 and 1907 conferences at The Hague, which led to the 
Hague Conventions. These produced the first formal statements 
on war crimes and disarmament. They became connected to what A radical phase
65
was becoming known as ‘liberal internationalism’, which developed 
the goal of formalizing the peace movement at the international 
level. One strand of this development sought to refine international 
law, another focused on creating an international federation of 
states, whilst another looked towards a world government, as the 
ultimate arbiter of peace. The 1899 conference introduced the 
idea of international arbitration as a means of dispute settlement 
(in which conflict parties agree to submit their disputes to binding 
resolution by a third party). This was supposed to be obligatory 
upon all of its state signatories, 26 of whom were present. No 
progress was made on the issue of disarmament, however. Further 
conferences were held in the early part of the 20th century, which 
also included women’s peace movements, but the outbreak of the 
First World War put such developments in abeyance until the 
League of Nations was formed by the victorious Allies soon after.
The arts also played their role in the dissemination of the concept 
of peace, and its popularization. For example, Lorenzetti’s 1340 
frescos of Peace and War in Siena illustrated the radically different 
impacts of peace and war on the city. Sometimes, peace was 
inferred in subtle and unlikely forms, such as Rubens’s famous 
painting Minerva protects Pax from Mars (1629–30), which was 
an illustration of the painter’s role as unofficial envoy between 
England and Spain. During the 20th century peace continued to 
motivate or be reflected in numerous examples of modern art and 
culture, such as Picasso’s Guernica (1937), which exposed the 
effects of modern industrial warfare against civilians, and in 
literature and war poetry, such as that of Wilfred Owen, British 
poet and a soldier in the First World War (including ‘Dulce et 
Decorum Est’ and ‘Anthem for Doomed Youth’, 1919).
Historically, from the perspective of civil society, a period of 
violence in any society or at international level has always spurred 
the development of peacemaking strategies to combat it, both 
from within society and by external actors. Many so-called 
‘peaceful societies’ around the world, often of a small, tribal Peace
66
nature, developed small-scale internal processes of conflict 
mediation, avoidance, and self-restraint. The state and international 
peace architecture have reflected this on a larger scale. In modern 
times, some states have adopted ‘peace constitutions’, whereby they 
have little or no military capacity. Some states see themselves as 
pacific, such as Costa Rica, Japan, and Germany, according to their 
post-Second World War constitutions.
Social and advocacy movements were supported by new 
technologies of communication, transport, and trade. Two distinct 
early pathways can be observed, including secular or religious 
orientations. They may have been derived from the secular 
emergence of liberal internationalism, associated with campaigns 
against conscription, ideological and feminist movements against 
war and for conventional disarmament, the Campaign for Nuclear 
Disarmament (CND), and environmental movements. Many later 
resistance movements have also described themselves as peace 
movements, whether they were resisting authoritarian or colonial 
rule or working towards modernization, development, human 
rights, and democracy.
As international humanitarian law gradually influenced the state’s 
understanding of war, it reinforced a more inclusive discourse of 
peace within the international system. By the 20th century, 
individuals had begun to lobby elites, leaders, and officials 
for peace in an organized manner. Partly because of such 
mobilization, The Hague peace conferences of 1899 and 1907, the 
International Court of Justice, and the 1910 and 1913 Universal 
Peace Congresses all pointed to the need for international law, 
self-determination, and an end to colonialism. Non-state actors 
were directly involved with the International Labour Organization 
from its establishment, and though they were excluded from The 
Hague Conferences in 1899 and 1907, their very exclusion was 
also an acknowledgement of their significance. Later, the League 
of Nations also provided non-state actors with informal 
consultative status.A radical phase
67
Such organizations soon began to proliferate: the International 
Rescue Committee (IRC) began its life rescuing Jews from Europe 
during the Second World War, and was later to be involved with 
retrieving Hungarian refugees after the failure of the 1956 
uprising and Cuban refugees after Fidel Castro came to power in 
Cuba in 1959. Other such organizations followed, including the 
Catholic Relief Service, World Vision, and the Oxford Committee 
for Famine Relief (OXFAM).
Such efforts put positive forms of peace at the forefront of 
international and academic thinking. There was a growing 
recognition of the requirement of social justice for individuals and 
communities, and not just treaties or disarmament for or between 
states if peace and order was to be both just and sustainable.
This view of a positive peace for civil society had an impact on the 
international system too. The Non-Aligned Movement, for 
example, wanted to propose an alternative approach to politics 
and development during the Cold War. This view was quietly 
influential, and the movement now includes nearly two-thirds of 
the UN’s member states. Along with the debates of the era that 
connected self-determination, equality, and human rights to the 
growing relationship between peace and order, this development 
also extended the idea of rights to relate to the needs of decolonized 
societies, which had rapidly increased in number (outnumbering 
the West in the UN General Assembly by the late 1960s).
Social peace movements, ensuing constitutional frameworks, and 
related international strategies to prevent war did constrain the 
forces of war and power at state and international levels. They 
built local to international networks across formal and informal 
groupings and actors. They focused on specific issues, such as 
disarmament, non-violence, equality, self-determination, or a 
peace process for a specific regional war elsewhere in the world. 
By the 20th century these movements had contributed to the IPA, 
setting the stage for the transnational, transversal social Peace
68
movements of the second half of the 20th century, which focused 
on decolonization, self-determination, human rights, development, 
and equality.
The civil peace
The development of social movements and advocacy focused on 
peace opened up a further strand of the evolution of peace: the 
civil peace. According to this approach, every individual in society 
has the capacity to mobilize for peace from a variety of different 
perspectives, whether for disarmament, for international 
cooperation, or against violence, discrimination, and oppression. 
It relates to the historical phenomena of social direct action for 
political, economic, and identity reasons, of citizen advocacy and 
mobilization, in the attainment or defence of basic human rights 
and values. It is also related to pacifism in its main forms, where 
civil action is non-violent in principle. Without the civil peace and 
its social forms of mobilization, international and constitutional 
frameworks would not be legitimated by ordinary people.
Indeed, it is plausible to argue that many elements of the IPA 
emerged first within civil society, according to intellectual, ethical, 
social, economic, and political responses to war and violence at 
state and international levels. Philosophers and thinkers, 
scientists, advocates, and activists throughout history have often 
provided the script for the reform of politics after war. This is 
when a synergy between advanced thought and powerful actors 
seems most likely to emerge. This synergy gave rise the Congress 
of Vienna, the League of Nations, the UN, and the EU, amongst 
others. It was obscure 17th-century thought from within civil 
society that gave rise to the 20th century’s liberal international 
and domestic peace settlements.
The civil peace often arises from localized organizations and their 
campaigns, which are normally connected transnationally to other 
similar movements around the world. These networks traverse the A radical phase
69
lines between formal and informal politics, grass roots, state, and 
international actors. They are connected to ethics, knowledge, and 
science, and expand rapidly over time. Civil society develops as 
local organizations, communities, and political actors coalesce 
around the various dynamics and requirements of peace with 
justice, as the causes of violence are identified by those on the 
receiving end. It has often represented a challenge to structural 
and direct violence embedded in the hierarchies of the states 
system or within society itself (i.e. a negative peace).
The growing role of NGOs
An important development for the evolution of the IPA and its 
growing incorporation of non-state actors related to the proliferation 
of non-governmental organizations. Their expertise, ethics, and 
determination played an important role in highlighting the need 
for human rights to be included in the UN Charter at San 
Francisco in 1945, and helped draft the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights. They were significant in advocating for, and 
drafting, different UN treaties and conventions spanning issues 
from the elimination of discrimination against women (1979) to 
the rights of children (1989). They played important roles in many 
other human rights-related UN working groups, as well as in the 
creation of the position of the UN High Commissioner for Human 
Rights. They consolidated the relationship between social 
movements and civil society and the design, often from the top 
down, of a more pacific state and international system. They 
promoted the expansion of rights in conflict-affected societies as 
well as in domestic and international law, treaties, and doctrine. 
They also acted as a bridge into stage four of the IPA, and the 
liberal peace framework later in the century.
Humanitarian law provides the legal context in which NGOs 
operate. One of the key early examples of contemporary 
humanitarianism was the Biafra crisis of 1968, when the Igbo 
people attempted to secede from Nigeria, causing the Nigerian Peace
70
Civil War. Despite their challenge to the sovereignty of Nigeria 
during this crisis, humanitarian aid NGOs mobilized regardless of 
international disapproval. This was repeated several times during 
the 1970s, in various crises in Bangladesh, Ethiopia, and Cambodia. 
Civil societies and NGOs were beginning to mobilize around the 
world to advocate for human rights, democracy, and emergency 
humanitarian assistance for the victims of war.
From these strands emerged a powerful body of actors and a 
language of rights, development, and norms that reinforced the 
view that individuals had legitimate rights for security, basic 
needs, autonomy, and to their own identity.
There are now so many NGOs around the world it is almost 
impossible to count them, especially those local NGOs working 
in post-conflict and development contexts. The most familiar 
international NGOs working on peacebuilding and human rights 
include International Crisis Group, International Alert, Amnesty 
International, and Human Rights Watch. Amnesty International, 
for example, was founded in 1961, part of the huge international 
human rights movement that was emerging. The Helsinki Final 
Act spurred the growth of civil society movements, NGOs, and the 
support of human rights in 1975.
Many more NGOs formed in the 1990s as a response to the broad 
requirements of the synthesis of peacebuilding, humanitarianism, 
human rights monitoring, and advocacy. They were to support a 
burgeoning civil society in post-conflict zones, which would then 
form the basis for a social contract and the liberal peace. It was 
partly because of civil society activism for human rights that the 
concept of humanitarian intervention emerged.
Organizations like ICRC, Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), and 
the International Crisis Group (ICG), among many others, have 
also played an important role in other aspects of civil society, 
development, and assistance. NGOs are now a recognized part of A radical phase
71
the UN system, hold consultative status within the United 
Nations’ platform on economic and social issues ECOSOC, and 
are an integral part of the humanitarian discourse. Under Article 
71 of the UN Charter, ECOSOC is empowered to consult with 
NGOs on economic and social issues, as well as on matters 
relating to refugees, the environment, and development. This is 
particularly important in the context of debates about human 
security and the emergence of a ‘global civil society’ in stage four 
of the IPA. It rests upon a global network of local NGOs with 
informal and formal connections, and often a common agreement 
on the underlying norms, rights, and processes of peace and 
development. This has increasingly supported peace, 
development, and security where states have failed.
However, there have been problems with such development. Civil 
society has become overloaded. Donor and humanitarian 
assistance may have contradictory effects. UNRWA (the United 
Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees), created 
in 1949 to provide relief and development for more than 5 million 
Palestinian refugees after the 1948 and 1967 wars in the Middle 
East, fulfilled an important role in aiding Palestinian refugees. 
Nevertheless, there is also a strong argument that it has supported 
the Israeli occupation by helping to maintain the post-war status 
quo. There is also evidence that civil society actors around the 
world may be co-opted more generally towards state or donor 
political interests and normative preferences, rather than being 
connected to local forms of legitimacy. Their aim is to bridge these 
different elements of politics in order to bring about a socially just 
and scientifically supportable form of peace.
Since the end of the Cold War numerous forms of conflict 
resolution, citizen diplomacy, and informal forms of mediation 
have emerged as a result of civil society actors and their capacities, 
often supported by international donors in places such as Cyprus, 
Sri Lanka, Israel/Palestine, and Northern Ireland. As a result, 
understandings of peace in policy and in practice have begun to Peace
72
include an everyday dimension of peace. This means that it is not 
enough to have a ceasefire or a peace treaty at the state level, but 
that society must also be safe to conduct everyday life. NGOs have 
become important actors in these processes, especially where they 
provide conflict resolution capacities, early warning of a possible 
impending conflict, and help construct the institutions necessary 
for democratization and the rule of law to become integral to an 
emerging peace.
For example, two London-based organizations, Conciliation 
Resources and International Alert, work on the premise that the 
denial of human rights leads to conflict and they support local 
solutions to conflicts. The Carter Center, based in Atlanta, Georgia 
(USA), also operates on issues related to democratization, human 
rights, and conflict resolution. Organizations like International 
Crisis Group, based in Brussels, seek to report on, advocate, and 
draw attention to conflicts all over the world. Such organizations 
often draw on the funding of international donors and work 
closely with the UN, as well as with local NGOs, governments, and 
other actors in conflict and post-conflict zones around the world. 
This points to an alignment between civil, state, and international 
processes and objectives for peacemaking. It also may be 
problematic, however, where there are very different goals and 
cultures, and identities and agendas are overwhelmingly set by the 
global north.
Organizations such as UNESCO (United Nations Educational, 
Scientific, and Cultural Organization) also endeavour to connect 
international peace institutions to the civil peace. It has worked in 
a range of areas on developing a culture of peace, from education 
to gender and children’s rights.
At the end of the Cold War, a series of UN General Assembly 
resolutions called for humanitarian assistance to victims of 
emergencies and natural disasters, for access for accredited 
agencies, the establishment of relief corridors, and the A radical phase
73
establishment of the UN Department of Humanitarian Affairs 
to coordinate humanitarian intervention (though bound to the 
rules of sovereignty). Furthermore, during the Kurdish crisis in 
northern Iraq, UN Security Council Resolution 688 of 5 April 1991 
facilitated humanitarian intervention involving a number of 
NGOs. In Bosnia, Security Council Resolution 771 of 13 August 
1992 called for humanitarian organizations to have unimpeded 
access, but it became a point of controversy between the opposing 
sides in the war. However, during the collapse of the former 
Yugoslavia in the early 1990s, the international community found 
it very difficult to offer humanitarian assistance while war was still 
in process, rapidly becoming overstretched. Similarly, in Somalia, 
after the collapse of the state in 1991, the UN was supposed to 
create conditions for the strengthening of civil society and offer 
humanitarian relief operations. The UN Secretary General’s 
Special Representative attempted to bring in NGOs to facilitate 
this in order to involve local groups in the peace process, with 
limited success. Similar patterns of subcontracting essential 
assistance for civil society were also tried in Haiti, Rwanda, and in 
Liberia, among many others since the 1990s, with varying degrees 
of success.
Conclusion
The civil peace has had a significant impact on world affairs. 
Through it social actors identified processes of violence and first 
began to organize thinking about how to respond. Civil society has 
often prepared the scripts for the future development of the IPA 
when powerful actors have failed to end wars and need new ideas. 
Their contribution has implied a more positive, hybrid, and 
everyday form of peace can be created, and also that different 
societies may have different aspirations or understandings 
of peace.
It has led to the development of an expanding range of rights and 
important UN conventions. These included among others the Peace
74
Declaration of Human Rights in 1948; the Convention on the 
Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide in 1948; 
the Convention on the Political Rights of Women in 1952; the 
Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial 
Countries and Peoples in 1960; the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights in 1966; the Declaration on 
the Right of Peoples to Peace in 1984; and the United Nations 
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples in 2007. Such 
conventions were aimed at producing a more positive form of peace 
in which institutions and states act in the interests of their citizens.
The Millennium Assembly of the UN in 2000 and the Millennium 
Development Goals followed this logic. The UN agreed to focus on 
achieving the following goals by the year 2015: eradicating extreme 
poverty, achieving universal primary education, promoting gender 
equality and empowering women, reducing child mortality and 
improving maternal health, combating HIV/AIDS, malaria, and 
other diseases, and, finally, ensuring environmental sustainability 
and establishing a global partnership for development. The recent 
Sustainable Development Goals (2015), and the subsequent 
Sustaining Peace agenda of the UN have further developed along 
these lines.
Many other non-governmentally influenced international 
campaigns have aimed to improve the lot of the peoples of the 
world. Such civil peace campaigns, in unison with international 
institutions, have highlighted the importance of avoiding the 
creation of dependency, being sensitive to the needs of local 
ownership, and being careful not to offend local or district officials 
and governments. They adhere to the injunction ‘do no harm’, 
often now written into the mandates of various international 
organizations, while expanding the range of human rights and 
extending the quality of peace experienced after war.
Such dynamics mean that civil society actors are often described 
as ‘norm entrepreneurs’. They privilege democracy, human rights, A radical phase
75
and forms of development in their micro-level interventions in 
society as well as in the realm of international relations. They 
contribute to a local, grass-roots peace, based upon local 
community consent and legitimacy in the context of a global, 
transnational civil society of networks between civil society 
organizations. The work of OXFAM, Amnesty International, 
Greenpeace, and many other groups concerned with issues like 
development and human rights, have contributed to the 
civil peace.
These organizations have not been uncontroversial. Some 
commentators argue that NGOs and non-state actors are thinly 
veiled fronts for powerful state interests, in that they are 
dependent on state funding and so support state interests, 
particularly with respect to foreign policy, trade, and the 
extraction of primary resources. Donor states, agencies, and IFIs 
generally subcontract work to NGOs precisely because of their 
access to, and legitimacy within, civil society, and also because 
humanitarian, social, educational, conflict resolution, and 
developmental tasks play a significant role in the reconstruction of 
the state. Sometimes, however, it may be the case that organizations 
in civil society represent views and groupings opposed to peace, 
such as those resting on nationalist or sectarian identities or links, 
or engage in unequal and exploitative relationships with other 
socio-economic groups in society.
The development and mobilization of the civil peace and its civil 
society actors has helped alter the nature of the state from one 
that was often feudal or authoritarian to one that was more 
democratic, observing the rights of its diverse citizens, and also 
working for a modicum of equality between them. This also 
indicates the citizen’s capacity to campaign for change and reform 
at the international level. These developments have enabled a 
re-envisioning of peace since the latter part of the 20th century. It 
depends on a range of processes in close association with major 
donor states (mainly northern states), international organizations Peace
76
like the UN, agencies like the United Nations Development 
Programme (UNDP) or United Nations High Commission for 
Refugees (UNHCR), or the World Bank. The World Bank, the 
Asian Development Bank, and the World Trade Organization, 
among many others, now encourage state relationships with civil 
society (even if some critics would argue that unmitigated 
capitalism undermines civil society at the same time). Overall, this 
has further enabled the civil peace to develop from the bottom up 
and from within society.
Recent human security approaches follow this logic. They involve 
a commitment to a just and sustainable settlement to conflict, the 
reframing of security debates to include a broader understanding 
of human security, and the involvement of external non-state 
actors and indigenous non-state actors. This concept has been 
widely accepted in key policy circles and in global civil society’s 
interconnected space that links civil society, NGOs, international 
agencies, and development donors. It was formative of the UN’s 
Sustaining Peace agenda discussions from 2015, which has begun 
to lay out the groundwork for the theoretical connection of 
peacemaking approaches with conceptions of justice, in particular 
global justice.77
Chapter 8
The development of an 
international peace 
architecture
At the international level, geopolitics and the diplomatic and 
military balance of power dating back to the Congress of Vienna 
of 1815, and the Concert of Europe, formed the first stage of an 
international peace architecture (IPA). These were balancing 
strategies used by the great powers and statesmen over the course 
of the 19th century.
The second stage, which emerged at the end of the First World 
War, attempted to add democracy, self-determination, 
international law, and organization to the IPA framework, to 
respond to the obvious limitations of the first stage and the 
dynamics that had led to the First World War.
The ideological struggle that then marked much of the 20th 
century between communism and capitalism, and the process of 
decolonization for the former empires (leading to many new states 
by the 1960s that expected a place at the international table), 
represented a third layer of the IPA. It emphasized more 
substantially the expansion of rights that stage two, relating to 
human rights, equality, and citizenship, had begun. This 
development in the architecture also led to demands for more 
social equality and for a more equal north‒south 
international order.Peace
78
Such dynamics were also slowly brought into thinking about 
regional and local peace settlements. They were not present in UN 
peacekeeping and mediation attempts in the Congo or Cyprus in 
the 1960s, but by the 1990s they had become more influential in 
conflict-affected countries such as Cambodia, Democratic 
Republic of Congo, Sierra Leone, or the Balkans. After the end of 
the Cold War, the development of stage four emerged, resting on 
the geopolitical stability provided by the so-called ‘unipolar 
moment’. This stage offered a framework that came to be known 
as liberal peacebuilding.
Stages five and six of the IPA emerged soon afterwards. Stage five 
focused on the rebuilding of the state in the context of American 
hegemony and global capitalism, seeing the state as the main 
vehicle for peace (whereas liberal peace amplified the role of the 
UN and international actors in creating checks and balances 
against war and violence). Stage six is currently in process, and 
seems to offer two potential paths: the possibility of connecting 
peace with global justice according to scholarly research findings 
(including work on global inequality, decolonialism, reconciliation, 
sustainability, and planetary concerns), or a nationalist retraction 
that started in stage five from the liberal goals of stage four, 
perhaps utilizing new technologies of power (digital surveillance 
and other Orwellian forms).
The evolution of an IPA: layers one to three
The Congress of Vienna and its subsequent ‘Concert of Europe’ 
system had maintained a very basic level of negative peace 
during the 19th century after 1815 between vying imperial 
powers and states. By the end of the century, reliance on 
high-level diplomacy for international peace was beginning to 
look ineffective in the face of the emergence of industrialized 
modes of warfare, the enormous expansion of trade and 
technology, and the growing political consciousness of 
mobilizing masses around the world.The development of an international peace architecture
79
With respect to the latter, along with demands for equality and the 
vote in newly mobilized populations in the West, the emergence of 
conscientious objection during the First World War was one of the 
best-known elements of what was becoming a broader anti-war 
stance. Conscientious objectors were often imprisoned by the state 
(in Britain’s case) until pacifism became recognized as a legitimate 
concern of citizens, for whom civilian work could legally be a 
substitute for active military service. The process that led to this 
was strongly supported by Cambridge University philosopher 
Bertrand Russell (1872–1970), who was at various times a liberal, 
a socialist, and a pacifist.
Campaigns for new forms of world government, to enhance 
interdependence through trade, and for disarmament, were 
also significant. The profits and advantages of war were no longer 
as narrowly understood, as the writings of Norman Angell 
(1872–1967), a famous anti-war campaigner in the early 
20th century, made clear. Both Russell and Angell increased the 
popular appeal of such ideas.
Prominent businessmen of the era also became involved in 
promoting world peace, most famously Andrew Carnegie, who 
used his enormous wealth from the American steel industry in the 
early 20th century to support trusts and organizations engaged in 
peace work, as well as funding the construction of the Peace 
Palace at The Hague. This now houses the International Court of 
Justice, among other institutions.
The First World War was a great disruption for the various peace 
movements, but it also allowed their different contributions to 
begin to coalesce in a second stage of the IPA. After the First 
World War there emerged a discussion of the value of a liberal and 
democratic form of peace along with the foundation of the League 
of Nations. These were the basis for an attempt to build a positive 
peace through adding a second and more complex framework for 
peace to the evolving international system. Peace henceforth was Peace
80
to include disarmament, global institutions created to manage 
conflict, collective action, arbitration over disputes between states, 
and a Secretariat, as well as a Council whose role it was to enforce 
the peace. It needed to be internationally organized, given a legal, 
political, and almost constitutional shape, rather than merely 
dependent upon luck in the workings of the balance of power by 
statesmen in their talking shops, as in the 19th century. The 
understanding of peace was broadening and deepening. A High 
Commission for Refugees was created to deal with the acute 
post-war refugee problem. Another institution was to manage the 
colonial system, which was beginning to collapse because of 
charges of injustice and because of armed resistance, as well as 
calls for self-determination from colonial subjects along with the 
economic and military exhaustion of the colonial powers.
The Treaty of Versailles was shaped by US President Wilson’s 
(1856–1924) ‘Fourteen Points’, which were intended to make the 
world ‘safe for democracy’ through self-determination and consent 
rather than through domination or occupation. They were 
remarkably similar to Kant’s ‘articles’ for perpetual peace. 
However, the US Senate rejected the treaty and the USA did not 
join the League, though Wilson received the Nobel Peace Prize in 
1919 for his efforts.
It very soon became apparent that the first two stages of the IPA, 
the first aimed at moderating geopolitics and the second at 
introducing self-determination and liberal democracy, were not 
enough to deal with newly emerging conflicts during this period. 
The political mobilization of citizens had been spurred by 
industrialization, world war, and new ideologies. For example, the 
foundation of the International Labour Organization (ILO) in 
1919 was partly a result of the activism of workers and a growing 
awareness of the importance of the concept of social justice. The 
ILO became the first specialized agency of the UN in 1946 and 
was subsequently to set international standards to mitigate the The development of an international peace architecture
81
exploitative dynamics that had so often led to civil conflict. By the 
1930s an ideological conflict was brewing that stages one and two 
of the IPA could not respond to, and would eventually lead to the 
Cold War after the dead-end of fascism. Social justice considerations 
spurred a new stage of the IPA after the Second World War, which 
led to the welfare state as a compromise to hold back the advances 
of socialism and communism in the West.
Even in the inter-war period, often viewed as the bleakest of epochs 
marked by financial and political crises, a World Disarmament 
Conference was convened in 1932. Several major peace movements 
continued to operate, including the British Peace Pledge Union, the 
Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom, War 
Resisters International, and various Quaker organizations.
During this period, most famously, Mahatma Gandhi introduced 
the approaches of satyagraha (truth) and ahimsa (non-violence), 
in an attempt to secure India’s independence from the British 
Empire through non-violent methods. These were combined in a 
non-violent campaign for social justice, development, and 
equality, hoping to avoid a violent insurgency and civil war. He 
used these methods to undermine British colonialism in India, but 
they had a wider impact on the legitimacy of colonialism around 
the world, rebutting its claim to represent a ‘civilizing mission’ and 
exposing its oppressive and racist character. Stage three in the IPA 
would have to stabilize stages one and two and also deal with both 
ideological and decolonization dynamics of violence.
In 1932, continuing a long-standing academic engagement with 
peace, Albert Einstein (1879–1955), well known for developing the 
general theory of relativity, and Sigmund Freud (1856–1939), the 
father of psychoanalysis, joined forces to add their intellectual 
credibility to the various peace movements with an article called 
‘Why War?’ They debated the human capacity to avoid war. 
Freud wrote,Peace
82
How long shall we have to wait before the rest of mankind become 
pacifists too? There is no telling.. .But one thing we can say: 
whatever fosters the growth of civilization works at the same time 
against war.
Einstein returned to the issue in 1955 when he published a 
manifesto with Bertrand Russell designed to prevent a nuclear 
conflict, calling on world leaders to seek peaceful solutions to 
international conflict. It exhorted its readers thus: ‘[w]e appeal, as 
human beings, to human beings: Remember your humanity and 
forget the rest.’ Russell himself was later to associate the peace 
movement with the creation of a world government, as did 
H. G. Wells (1866–1946), a prolific English writer, socialist, 
pacifist, and campaigner on social issues.
Consolidation of the international architecture 
after the Second World War: layers three to four
The new peace that was to follow the war was principally 
developed according to an American consensus. Cordell Hull 
(1871–1955), the longest-serving US Secretary of State for 
President Roosevelt, who received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1945 
for his role in establishing the United Nations, introduced a 
Reciprocal Trade Act in 1934 to open up international trade as a 
counter to economic nationalism. This was reflected in the 
Atlantic Charter of 1941 signed by British Prime Minister Winston 
Churchill and US President Roosevelt, which laid out the 
internationalist case (though mainly in the global north) for 
cooperation, free trade, self-determination, decolonization, and 
the disarmament of aggressive states.
The new peace framework spanned the UN Charter, the emerging 
Cold War confrontation between the USA and the USSR, and the 
creation of security, political, and economic arrangements between 
the USA, the Western industrial countries, and Japan. This system 
included a military settlement and an institutional framework. The development of an international peace architecture
83
It was developed by a mixture of public and private approaches 
and organizations, including the US Commission to Study the 
Basis of a Just and Durable Peace, and the Council for Foreign 
Affairs, and Britain’s Chatham House.
This ‘idealist’ version of peace engendered in Wilsonianism was 
now becoming firmly institutionalized in the UN system, which 
drew together, via an alphabet soup of acronyms, liberal 
internationalism, self-determination, liberal democracy, and 
human rights. It was formalized at the conferences of Dumbarton 
Oaks in 1944 and San Francisco in 1945. Peace had by now 
come to engender the rejection of interstate war, the provision 
of humanitarian resources, development, financial regulation 
and adjustment, and human rights. Though the Security 
Council was its primary security organization, the UN’s 
specialized agencies, funds, and programmes suggested a much 
broader view of peace. The World Health Organization, the 
International Labour Organization, the Food and Agriculture 
Organization, the UN Development Programme, the World 
Food Programme, the UN International Children’s Emergency 
Fund, among others, were functional organizations established 
in order to support a peace resting on social justice. The UN 
system did not evolve only from the liberal attempt to moderate 
the victor’s peace and its underpinning political realism, but 
also as a response to the legitimate challenges for social justice, 
at both a material and ideological level: in other words, in 
response to the ideological struggle that would soon be known 
as the Cold War.
Perhaps the most notable statement on peace during this period 
was Roosevelt’s belief that the American Senate’s rejection of 
Wilson’s peace in 1920 had been mistaken, and that there was 
now no turning back from the construction of a liberal 
international order of democratic states, open markets, and 
international cooperation. In this order there would be no place 
for formal imperialism or colonialism.Peace
84
The International Military Tribunal, set up by the Allies in 1945 to 
try Nazi war criminals at Nuremberg, provided another important 
strand of this layer of the IPA. The tribunal had three main 
jurisdictions, one of which was ‘crimes against peace’. Crimes 
against humanity and war crimes were the most recognized of its 
jurisdictions, however. The Allies defined a crime against peace as 
one that involved planning, preparing, or initiating an aggressive 
war. This soon led to a new wave of legal development with 
respect to crimes against humanity.
The new system was buttressed by both security guarantees and 
economic redistribution. NATO played an important military 
(if only mainly symbolic) role in ensuring that the post-war system 
would be sustained by a collective security framework (though its 
capacity to oppose the military power of the Soviet Union was 
always somewhat questionable). The Truman Doctrine, designed 
to contain communism in Turkey and Greece, was US President 
Harry Truman’s attempt, from 1947, ‘. ..to support free people who 
are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by 
outside pressures’. Marshall Aid (1948–52), a massive American 
programme named after US Secretary of State George Marshall, 
was intended to rebuild Europe and prevent the spread of 
communism.
The ‘containment order’ which emerged as part of the 1947 
Truman Doctrine indicated that there were large parts of the 
world which would be subject to an alternative, or a more 
traditional and limited, concept of peace. They would effectively 
be isolated from the liberal peace both through Western policy 
and through their compliance with the USSR.
The Declaration of Human Rights in 1947, lobbied for by Eleanor 
Roosevelt, rapidly became a cornerstone of new thinking and 
policies. The human rights discourse was derived especially from 
the work of Western thinkers such as Locke and Mill who put 
forward the view that individuals have an innate set of rights The development of an international peace architecture
85
within the liberal tradition. Implicitly, human rights and peace are 
equated in much of the literature: one cannot exist without the 
other. This allowed the UN to base its work on a widely agreed set 
of standards.
In 1955, the Bandung Conference in Indonesia, attended by 29 
newly independent states from the global south including India 
and Indonesia and representing nearly 1.5 billion people, began a 
political movement that saw itself as an alternative to the existing 
post-Cold War order and its inherent instability. Driven by the 
process of decolonization and related to the ideological struggle 
and the socialist challenge to Western politics, in 1961, the 
Non-Aligned Movement formed. It was led by Yugoslavia, 
Indonesia, India, Egypt, and other states that wanted an 
alternative approach to politics and development. Briefly at least, 
it promoted the development of states in the global south as a 
counterweight to the dominant ideologies of the ongoing Cold 
War. New voices from the global south were now beginning to 
enter a debate about the nature of international order, until then 
mainly dominated by the empires and states of the global north. 
Thus, stage three of the IPA also had to deal with the claims of 
former colonial subjects who now sought independence and 
equality, as made clear in the UN General Assembly by the 1966 
Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights. Social and 
transnational movements in the global north continued to make 
themselves felt by campaigning on issues from disarmament to 
civil rights, labour, apartheid, and other aspects of social justice. 
These would henceforth underpin aspirations for a more 
sophisticated form after the Second World War, as a stage three 
framework began to emerge for the IPA.
This also illustrated the influence of more critical thinking about 
peace and development and a range of post-colonial scholars who 
were by now arguing that the international system required a 
radical restructuring if inequality and structural violence were to 
be ended and social justice achieved. Thus, stage three of the Peace
86
architecture challenged the notion of ‘basic’ human rights, arguing 
that they needed to be further expanded, and this was connected 
to the development of social democracy or the welfare state in 
post-war Europe, as well as to decolonization. This in turn also 
entailed a substantial attempt to change the nature of the global 
political economy so that it was more conducive to the development 
of post-colonial states by the 1970s. After the emergence of the 
Non-Aligned Movement in the UN General Assembly in the 1960s 
there followed an attempt to build a New International Economic 
Order in the 1970s (which was roundly rejected by the West). 
In addition, the connection of human rights with foreign policy 
in the Helsinki Final Act of 1974 appeared to consolidate these 
developments, all with substantial implications for a positive 
peace agenda.
The peace movement also attracted the attention of US 
President John F. Kennedy, who said in a speech in Washington 
in 1963:
I speak of peace, therefore, as the necessary rational end of rational 
men. . .world peace, like community peace, does not require that 
each man love his neighbour—it requires only that they live together 
in mutual tolerance . ..our problems are man-made—therefore they 
can be solved by man.
During this period, United Nations peacekeeping emerged as a 
new tool to mitigate or prevent conflicts within and between 
states. It aimed primarily at preventing small conflicts from 
igniting a superpower conflict. During the period leading up to 
the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1989–90 both Mikhail 
Gorbachev, influenced by the Russell–Einstein Manifesto, and US 
President Ronald Reagan agreed that nuclear wars could not be 
won and that significant conventional and non-conventional 
disarmament was required. The anti-nuclear movement had long 
argued for this cause (as the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament 
demonstrated from 1957 onwards).The development of an international peace architecture
87
Another contribution of this era that cemented the institutional 
framework for peace came from the Geneva Conventions (1949). 
These extended the earlier treaty in 1864 that established the 
International Red Cross, as well as standards for international 
law pertaining to humanitarianism in wartime, the treatment 
of prisoners, the wounded, and the protection of civilians. 
International law has been crucial for the institutional peace 
framework as a set of binding rules between states that provides a 
stable international order. The International Court of Justice, 
founded by the UN Charter in 1945, later the European Court 
of Human Rights, established on the basis of the Council of 
Europe’s 1950 European Convention on Human Rights, and the 
International Criminal Court, created by the Rome Statute in 
2002, were also the results of the evolving institutional peace 
framework. The development of consent-based governance 
frameworks at the international and national levels has now 
produced a significant array of norms, laws, and instruments for 
peace and justice. In terms of the institutional peace, the body of 
law about the conduct of war, international humanitarian law, and 
international human rights law, while slow, cumbersome, and 
sometimes unenforceable, has been particularly significant.
With these developments it was becoming possible to see the 
beginnings of the fourth layer of the IPA, which was waiting in the 
wings for the end of the Cold War. It would enable a much more 
ambitious system of liberal peacebuilding, and liberal 
internationalism to emerge.
A regional architecture for peace has also been vital to the 
developing international architecture. The EU emerged from a 
post-war attempt to pacify the relationship between the main 
European states, move away from nationalism, pool resources, 
and create common goals. It later began to harmonize trade, law, 
diplomacy, and foreign policy. In 1952 the European Coal and 
Steel Community was created as the first step towards a European 
federation, followed by the 1957 Treaty of Rome, which created Peace
88
the European Economic Community and a customs union. Later, 
the European Union became the most successful regional attempt 
to maintain peace and order so far. It is a sophisticated successful 
example of regional conflict resolution and transformation at the 
social level, as well as constitutional and institutional reform and 
development, premised upon the stabilization of geopolitics.
A network of other regional organizations is emerging around the 
world, perhaps most notably the African Union. Established in 
2001 as a successor to the Organization of African Unity (founded 
in 1963), consisting of 54 African states, it aims at promoting 
solidarity, assisting in political and socio-economic integration 
and cooperation, as well as supporting security, democracy, 
human rights, and development.
By this point, the IPA had incorporated responses to geopolitics, 
through balancing and building up international collaboration in 
stages one and two. It had also incorporated responses to civil war 
through democracy, law, and rights in stage two, which also began 
to formalize international institutions as a response to regional 
wars. In stage three it had begun to respond to wider justice claims 
in terms of economics and independence for the industrialized 
populations of the West and for decolonized states. By mid-century, 
it was becoming a sprawling edifice, aimed at preventing 
international, regional, and civil war. It was decentralized, little 
understood, and difficult to manage, and was expanding rapidly. Yet, 
the idea of a peace agreement and the practices of peacekeeping 
by the 1960s were still limited to questions of basic security and 
power, as the UN missions in Egypt (UNEF 1 and 2, 1956‒67 and 
1973‒9) and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (ONUC, 
1960‒4) illustrated.
However, the international system now comprised different layers 
and frameworks and increasingly there was a growing confluence 
between the aims of social mobilization for more emancipatory 
forms of peace and the interests of great powers. These forces The development of an international peace architecture
89
were to reshape conflict-affected states, at least while they were 
aligned, inducing reform via pressure from below and above, 
cemented by a peace agreement. It also provided the basis for the 
advent of liberal peacebuilding by the end of the century, supported 
by international actors—mediators, peacekeepers, peacebuilders, 
donors, and NGOs, which supported civil society and state reform. 
They were now supported by many of the dominant peacebuilding 
actors, agencies, and states, such as the UN, World Bank, or key 
donors like the USA, UK, Japan, or the EU.
Peace after the Cold War
By the end of the century the international peacebuilding 
architecture was focused on redesigning the international and 
states-system, and enabling civil society in the context of scientific 
advances, and on the governance of the global economy. 
It incorporated a very powerful critique desiring social justice, 
implying much greater international equality was required. 
It pointed to even wider notions of global justice and sustainability. 
As Kant inferred long ago in the 17th century, social justice 
requires global justice. Yet, this architecture is also subject to 
numerous international contradictions, it is very complex, 
inter-generational, and requires substantial material support from 
diverse constituencies, and populations who are required to act in 
solidarity with others in distant war-torn countries.
After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the liberal peace became, 
for the West at least, the leading response to conflict, war, and 
violence. An awareness of the global, regional, state, and local 
dynamics of peace, and its social, economic, political, and cultural 
dimensions, had now coalesced around the benefits of democracy 
and capitalism, some social welfare on the part of the state, and an 
international architecture of peace and development led by the 
UN. UN Conventions, documents, committees, agencies, and 
organizations now began to emerge and focus on improving the 
local, state, and global dynamics of social, political, economic, and Peace
90
institutional aspects of peace. The most important of these were 
An Agenda for Peace in 1992, the Cairo Population Summit of 1992, 
the Rio de Janeiro ‘Earth Summit’ of 1992, the Beijing Women’s 
Summit of 1995, the UN Millennium Declaration of 2000, and 
Responsibility to Protect in 2005. Together all of these developments 
contributed to stage four of the evolution of the IPA.
Stage four was perhaps the most successful stage of the 
architecture yet, in that it stabilized the previous stages and 
offered a concrete strategy for dealing with post-Cold War 
conflicts, though it was not without its limitations. It provided a 
platform for a convergence of peacemaking, peacekeeping, 
peacebuilding, development, state reform, international 
institutionalization and law, social movements, and civil society 
actors. Liberal, internationalist, idealist, and pacifist movements, 
associated with humanitarianism, the formation of international 
institutions like the UN, international law, democracy, free trade, 
and forms of economic redistribution, were at the forefront of 
what appeared to be popular mobilization and non-violent 
strategies aimed at a wider peace.
Thus, liberal peace incorporated a diverse array of aspects. Once 
security is assured (a negative peace) the next stage is to create a 
positive peace. A ceasefire, disarmament, demilitarization, and 
demobilization, was crucially important in the first instance, 
followed by a viable political settlement and state reform.
This stage also saw the elevation of voices from the global south, 
along with a range of what might be called ‘subaltern’ actors: 
women’s groups, marginalized identity groups, the poor and 
disadvantaged, and many others. They also slowly built up their 
local and global networks of advocacy in local society, the state, 
and international institutions, demanding expanded rights for 
identity, equality, justice, and reconciliation, as well as security 
and development. They added to the chorus and activities relating The development of an international peace architecture
91
to the reform of the old warlike (often patriarchal) sovereignties of 
empire or state. Long-standing racist, patriarchal, and colonial 
understandings of peace, and even more sophisticated versions 
based on liberal internationalism, have gradually broadened.
War was becoming increasingly undermined as a political tool 
except where there were significant threats against the international 
community, or for humanitarian reasons, to overthrow occasional 
renegade and terrorist-supporting regimes, as in Bosnia, Sierra 
Leone, or Afghanistan and Iraq. That is not to say that it was 
absent, as shown by the recent and extended wars in Syria and 
Yemen, or the so-called ‘hybrid war’ (which includes traditional 
warfare, irregular warfare, and cyber tactics) as used by Russia in 
Syria or Ukraine, amongst others in the 2010s. Such ‘innovation’ 
in warfare, however, normally led to innovation in the 
international peace architecture.
Thus, the UN continued to develop its capacity for peace along 
with the expanding donor system. International law was 
increasingly taken seriously even if not enforced. Nuclear and 
other disarmament became internationally accepted. Expectations 
about peace also now included issues relating to civil society, 
human rights, gender, development, and extended into research 
and education. Policymaking on peace, development, security, 
rights, and needs advanced significantly, even if the redress of 
direct or structural violence has so far been uneven. Concepts like 
human security (as opposed to state security) became part of the 
institutional agenda in the UN system in the 1990s, emphasizing 
the human consequences of conflict and dimensions of peace. All 
of these elements of the IPA meant it had become the most 
complex and effective framework for peace ever seen.
Such complexity entailed substantial cost, risks, and needed 
heavyweight leadership, not to mention political will, which in 
practice was only intermittently provided by the USA.Peace
92
Into the 21st century: layers five to six
Variations on the liberal peace also began to emerge by the 2000s, 
often supported by the newer actors and organizations, the 
emerging countries and a range of local and transnational actors, 
on the world stage. Most recognized states play a role in various 
international organizations—from the UN to the IMF, World 
Bank, European Union, Organization for Security and 
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the AU, and many other regional 
organizations—that contribute to peace, development, and 
security in the many parts of today’s world where war has occurred 
or still threatens. At the elite or state level diplomats and 
international officials utilize tools such as negotiation, mediation, 
conflict resolution, peacebuilding, statebuilding, or development 
processes. International peacekeepers’ military, peacekeeping, and 
humanitarian intervention may provide a platform for these tools. 
Peace in positive or even hybrid form is a local and international, 
collective aspiration, even if a ‘will to power’ (implying at best a 
negative peace) has often captured the world’s headlines.
By the 2000s after problems with liberal peacebuilding in 
Cambodia, Bosnia, and other cases around the world, and with the 
advent of the War on Terror, statebuilding shifted the focus for 
peacebuilding from human rights and democracy back towards 
regional security. This was a stage five response to the new 
synergies between civil war and terrorism that were emerging, 
especially in the Middle East. This appeared to be a regressive step 
for the IPA, as seen in Iraq after 2004, as it focused mainly on 
regional security, the stabilization of the state as the vehicle of 
domestic and international order, and matters of trade as opposed 
to rights and democracy. On paper, the UN, global civil society, 
and scholars were already developing a stage six as a response to 
heightened nationalism, populism, inequality, injustice, and 
unsustainability, as well as to the disruptions caused by hybrid 
forms of war and violence as well as new technologies and their The development of an international peace architecture
93
applications for violence. This led by the 2010s to discussions 
about the Sustainable Development and Sustaining Peace agendas 
(2015/18).
The overall international architecture has evolved via the work 
of many often disconnected groups over the centuries as an 
inter-generational, multifaceted response to the changing 
problems of war. Multiple layers of peace praxis have been placed 
upon previous layers to deal with each new type of war, and have 
been embedded in social, state, and international organization, 
networks, law, and institutions. They have always emerged as a 
response to the last war, after the event, and have a limited 
predictive capacity. The techniques and underpinning systems of 
war always seem to be far ahead. The overall structure of the IPA 
is politically and scientifically complex, under-resourced and 
expensive to maintain, ambitious, and thus fragile. It is at risk of 
collapse if a new layer (layer six) cannot stabilize the previous 
layers or respond to new and emerging types of conflict 
quickly enough.94
Chapter 9
Peacekeeping, peacebuilding, 
and statebuilding
As the liberal peace coalesced in modern international relations in 
the fourth stage of the development of an IPA, there emerged 
different approaches, which are examined in this chapter. These 
involved a range of processes designed to manage, resolve, or 
transform conflict:
(a) Peacekeeping, diplomacy, and mediation: a first generation 
approach aimed at a negative peace, from the 1950s 
onwards (created during the 1956 Suez Crisis), in which neutral 
military intervention brought about ceasefires often through 
the UN;
(b) Civil society efforts: a second generation approach from the late 
1960s more focused on law, rights, social reconciliation, and a 
positive peace;
(c) by the 1990s, a third generation of approaches focused on 
building liberal peace through bringing together development, 
peacekeeping, peacebuilding, statebuilding, democratization, 
creating a rule of law, promoting human rights, civil society, and 
capitalism. This also offered a positive form of peace;
(d) a fourth generation approach, still developing, which combines 
the liberal peace with a recognition of local and contextual peace 
traditions. This may produce positive hybrid forms of peace.Peacekeeping, peacebuilding, and statebuilding

Conflict management after the Second 
World War: international mediation 
and peacekeeping
The thinking that underlies the victor’s peace contributed to 
modern ‘conflict management’ approaches, which aimed at 
maintaining a negative peace. This represented a first generation 
of attempts to manage international conflict and stabilize the 
international system during the Cold War. However, during this 
period, most wars were barely addressed by such tools, and 
instead were fought to a conclusion (such as in the Korean war 
1950‒3). Conflict management approaches have sometimes 
included the use of force by coalitions of states, but more often 
tools such as UN peacekeeping, high-level diplomacy (meaning 
the involvement of senior politicians, statesmen and women, 
and international bureaucrats like the UN Secretary General), 
and the use of international mediation. Such processes often 
produced ‘zero-sum’ outcomes in which a negative peace 
consisted of unstable relations between ‘winners’ and ‘losers’ in 
a conflict. Such de-escalation was useful during the Cold War, 
when nuclear conflict between the superpowers was always 
plausible.
To this effect, the UN Charter stated:
All Members shall settle their international disputes by peaceful 
means in such a manner that international peace and security, and 
justice, are not endangered.
The parties to any dispute, the continuance of which is likely to 
endanger the maintenance of international peace and security, 
shall, first of all, seek a solution by negotiation, enquiry, mediation, 
conciliation, arbitration, judicial settlement, resort to regional 
agencies or arrangements, or other peaceful means of their 
own choice.Peace
96
These binding statements are central to any modern conception 
of conflict management, aimed at maintaining international 
security. Negative peace during much of the Cold War involved 
the preservation of the territorial integrity of states, often after 
decolonization or after a proxy war between the USA and the 
USSR (although many wars during this period received no such 
treatment, as with the Vietnam War from 1955 and its outcome in 
1975, because the superpowers were involved). The human rights 
of citizens were of secondary importance at best.
Reaching a ceasefire agreement, withdrawing foreign forces, 
establishing law and order, and achieving a comprehensive peace 
agreement at the diplomatic level were the key components of 
conflict management approaches, following closely the first stage 
in the IPA and its tradition of geopolitical balancing and the 
maintenance of the existing states system. It aimed at supporting 
a basic minimum order without any overt violence. To achieve this 
any third parties involved in mediation or peacekeeping had to be 
neutral and impartial or, alternatively, work according to their 
power and interests. International mediation as a diplomatic 
activity required interactions between states over territory, 
alliances, constitutional agreements, or boundaries, often led by a 
leader or by the UN. As mediation became more sophisticated, 
according to William Zartman (a professor of political science at 
Johns Hopkins University), it enabled the search for windows of 
opportunity provided by ‘hurting stalemates’ (where disputants are 
caught up in a painful situation where they could not win on the 
battlefield but neither could they afford to give up the struggle) and 
‘ripe moments’ (where new opportunities arise for a settlement to 
occur). The disputants might be more likely to settle and mediators, 
diplomats, and peacekeeping operations would be able to mobilize.
Though not mentioned by name in the UN Charter, UN 
peacekeeping was probably the most innovative of modern 
conflict management approaches, but it still reflected the close Peacekeeping, peacebuilding, and statebuilding
97
control of UN Security Council members of international matters 
and was not designed to settle a conflict. Peacekeeping was 
developed by the UN Secretary General and his team in 1956 
during the Suez Crisis in order to prevent it from sparking a major 
conflict between the superpowers.
This early type of peacekeeping involved four main principles: 
that the force should be defensive rather than offensive; that it 
should not include troops drawn from major powers (to enhance 
its neutrality); that it should be impartial; and that it should have 
consent and not intervene in the dispute. In this way a small and 
symbolic force, cheaply run, could offer symbolic support for 
peace and security, help uphold the UN Charter, and not take 
great risks because it had the consent of the parties to the dispute, 
whether the superpowers in the UN Security Council or armies 
and guerrilla fighters on the ground. It could also provide a calmer 
environment in which peace talks might be held.
The earliest forms of peacekeeping were essentially observer 
missions or disengagement missions (as in the missions in 
Kashmir in 1947 or the Middle East in 1948), but they quickly 
developed into forms intended to provide the conditions of 
stability in which diplomacy, mediation, and negotiation could 
begin alongside peacekeeping forces (as in Cyprus from 1964 
onwards). This was a response to the long-term problems of 
geopolitics, which ultimately, as with stages two and three of the 
IPA, require political settlements to be mediated and the 
aspirations of society to be met. Many of the peacekeeping 
missions since 1956, and the Suez Crisis (1956–7), aimed at 
facilitating independence of colonial territories, enabling colonial 
powers to withdraw while saving face. They were aimed at 
preventing small wars, as in Cyprus in 1963 or 1974, from 
escalating into major conflicts. They normally patrolled agreed 
ceasefires, and tried to oversee the withdrawal of troops and create 
conditions in which a peace agreement might be plausible, as after Peace
98
the Suez Crisis in 1956 or in Cyprus from 1964. In other words 
they tried to support a negative peace, but soon realized that more 
was required if the conflict was not to flare up upon their 
departure.
After the end of the Cold War many conflicts did flare up, in the 
Balkans, Africa, Central America, and Africa. UN peacekeeping 
again endeavoured to implement the terms of prior peace 
agreements negotiated by the UN Secretary General or other 
international mediators in places such as Namibia (1989–90), 
where an agreement between South Africa and local leaders led to 
Namibian Independence overseen by the UN. There were also 
similar UN forces sent around this time to implement agreements 
which brought civil wars to an end in Angola and Mozambique. 
Observer missions also monitored the transition into peace after 
the end of civil wars in Nicaragua and El Salvador.
More ambitious missions also occurred, as in Cambodia where the 
UN also acted as a transitional government during the process of 
building a democracy (1992–3). They became more involved in 
building a liberal form of peace. By the late 1990s and under 
increasing pressure, the UN was trying to conduct peacekeeping 
without clear local consent, as in Bosnia-Herzegovina, exposing 
peacekeepers and international staff to the risk of being drawn 
into the conflict rather than being perceived as neutral third parties.
The evolution of peacekeeping occurred because the practice of 
conflict management in places like DR Congo or Cyprus in the 
early 1960s had failed to cope with the weaknesses of a negative 
peace or respond to local demands for a positive peace. Early 
forms of peacekeeping achieved some mitigation of open violence 
but rarely a comprehensive peace settlement (perhaps with the 
exception of the Camp David Accords between Israel and Egypt 
after wars in 1967 and 1973, though this was mediated with some 
persuasiveness by US President Carter in 1978). Negative peace 
suffered from the same weakness as the victor’s peace: it needed Peacekeeping, peacebuilding, and statebuilding
99
permanent military and material guarantees, otherwise any peace 
process it engendered might collapse. This evolution highlighted 
the significance of further innovation in the IPA.
Peace through conflict resolution
A second generation attempt to address the underlying dynamics 
of conflict, and to resolve and reconcile conflicting parties, focused 
on the rights and needs of citizens rather than states. This 
reflected broader developments in stages two and three in the IPA.
It aimed at creating a ‘win–win’ outcome (where all parties felt they 
had won as a result of the peace process) driven by responding to 
the needs of civil society in particular. It focused on the root 
causes of conflict from the perspective of individuals, groups, and 
societies, and on mutual accommodation. It is often described as 
‘track II’, track I being formal diplomacy, mediation, and 
negotiation. From this perspective, conflict arises out of a 
repression of basic human needs and is a social as well as a 
psychological phenomenon. Second generation approaches saw 
injustice as a source of social unrest and human needs offered a 
framework for understanding the causes of conflict, how it might 
be resolved, and how reconciliation and justice could be achieved, 
rather than merely managing enmity. This civil society-oriented 
discourse aimed to construct a positive peace addressing the 
societal roots of conflict and discriminatory and inequitable social, 
economic, and political structures.
From this theoretical basis a number of new methods for 
peacemaking emerged. Citizen diplomacy, conflict resolution, and 
similar track II approaches became common from the 1990s in 
places such as Cyprus, the Middle East, Northern Ireland, or Sri 
Lanka as an alternative and innovative way to reconcile societies. 
Informal ‘back channels’ were created between a range of political 
and informal civil society actors across conflict lines. Meetings 
often took place between social groups to discuss local matters Peace
100
and how to improve everyday life, as well as to discuss broader 
visions of a peace process. Informal channels of communication 
often facilitated a peace process at the official level and improved 
security significantly.
This was particularly successful in Northern Ireland when the 
peace process began after 1994. It took place at both the elite and 
the social level, and was cemented by massive civil society and 
economic investment from the British government and the EU 
to iron out structural and economic inequalities between its 
communities. There was also a parallel agreement between the 
main governments involved and the creation of new and improved 
political institutions (the Good Friday Agreement of 1998). 
However, the potential of these approaches in other locations 
such as Israel/Palestine and Sri Lanka was not realized despite 
some promise in the 1990s. Their peace processes reverted to 
nationalistic, power-driven, formal processes, and eventually 
were not able to overcome the usual problems associated with 
sovereignty, territorialism, militarization, and nationalism. 
Conflict resolution approaches have, however, made it clear that 
in any society a peace process should meet political, social, and 
economic needs and rights. It was also an essential contribution to 
the emerging fourth layer of the IPA.
Conflict transformation, peacebuilding, 
and statebuilding
This approach was soon augmented by conflict transformation 
theory, which argued for a process that transforms the relationships, 
interests, and nature of state and society which feed a conflict. This 
is a long-term and multidimensional process, aimed at addressing 
the roots of conflict, including perceptions, communications, 
inequality, and social injustice. Liberal peacebuilding was heavily 
indebted to such approaches, in that it was soon realized that a 
more ambitious process such as conflict transformation would 
require more complex peace processes. After 1990, liberal Peacekeeping, peacebuilding, and statebuilding
101
peacebuilding involved large-scale and external forms of 
intervention, in countries like Cambodia, Bosnia, Sierra Leone, 
Timor-Leste, Afghanistan, and many others.
There were varying estimates, but by its recent peak in 2008 
about 110,000 personnel were deployed in conflict or post-conflict 
countries populated by a total of 100 million people. These 
operations include a range of components, such as military 
intervention, democratization, and development, managed by 
international organizations such as the UN and the World Bank, 
foreign donors, and many regional and international agencies. 
They aimed to build a positive peace in liberal capitalist and 
democratic form, and focused on security, democracy, human 
rights, the rule of law, development, free trade, and a vibrant civil 
society.
Stage four in the IPA reframed geopolitical balancing, 
peacekeeping, mediation, and peace processes to expand liberal 
democracy, capitalism, and international law across the world as a 
solution to civil and regional wars of various types. Liberal 
peacebuilding linked peace and security directly with development, 
democracy, the rule of law, human rights, and a vibrant civil 
society in a modern state framework. This is embedded in a 
system of global governance, international law, and trade.
This top-down architecture only offered part of the picture, 
however. Peacebuilding was initially theorized in the peace 
research literature as a grass-roots, bottom-up process in which a 
local consensus within society led to a positive peace, representing 
the earlier claims for self-determination, welfare, and development 
that had emerged with stages two to four of the IPA. As the 
concept evolved, it came to represent a convergence with the 
agendas of human rights, development, democratization, and 
human security, and in practice it also had to bring together 
conflicting interests of major states in the UN Security Council 
after the end of the Cold War. It was in part based upon the Peace
102
development of more ambitious and integrated forms of 
peacekeeping, which evolved rapidly from multidimensional 
forms at first with the consent of local actors and in a multilateral 
form, and then, on occasion, without their consent. As a result, the 
demands on the role of the UN and its supporting actors 
multiplied and diversified enormously in terms of the tasks they 
undertook to build peace and the many locations around the 
world where they did so.
A number of UN documents, starting with An Agenda for Peace
in 1992, described this new stage in the IPA in detail. This UN 
document, akin to a Cold War peace settlement, described 
peacebuilding as ‘action to identify and support structures which 
will tend to strengthen and solidify peace in order to avoid a 
relapse into conflict’. In 2007 the UN Secretary General provided 
a comprehensive definition:
Peacebuilding involves a range of measures targeted to reduce the 
risk of lapsing or relapsing into conflict by strengthening national 
capacities at all levels for conflict management, and to lay the 
foundations for sustainable peace and development. Peacebuilding 
strategies must be coherent and tailored to specific needs of the 
country concerned, based on national ownership, and should 
comprise a carefully prioritized, sequenced, and therefore relatively 
narrow set of activities aimed at achieving the above objectives.
However, this approach was constrained by geopolitical concerns, 
the need to consider sovereign states and their right of 
non-intervention, as well as its implicit claim that peace should 
be built according to a universal formula. As with peacekeeping 
from the 1960s, most peacebuilding operations in the 1990s 
took place in the global south. This gave the impression that 
northern countries were pacifying disadvantaged populations 
rather than responding to more substantive political claims for 
security (often meaning human security), justice, and 
development.Peacekeeping, peacebuilding, and statebuilding
103
Since the early 1990s UN Integrated Missions have endeavoured 
to support the broad ambitions of peacebuilding, as in the 
Balkans in the early 1990s along with other actors (such as 
NATO, the EU, and the OSCE). The early post-Cold War 
peacekeeping operations in Namibia, Cambodia, Angola, 
Mozambique, and El Salvador seemed to offer the hope that the 
peace engendered by UN intervention could go beyond 
patrolling ceasefires and would instead contribute to the 
democratization and liberal reform of failing and failed states. 
This blueprint was also used in Cambodia, Bosnia, Kosovo, 
Sierra Leone, Liberia, DR Congo, and East Timor and others 
during the 1990s and 2000s. Liberal peacebuilding came to 
represent a multilevel approach, attempting to address the local, 
state, and regional aspects of, and actors in, conflict. It became 
multidimensional in nature in that it brought together a wide 
range of actors who were able to deal with a wide range of issues 
and dynamics. As the concept of security expanded so too 
emerged pressure for international law and human rights to 
expand further than their 1940s version.
The record has been mixed. Many operations in different locations 
resulted in authoritarian regimes and a significant percentage 
have failed. This was because the process was inconsistent in its 
design, was inefficient and ill coordinated by international actors, 
thus losing localized legitimacy with conflict-affected populations. 
Deficiencies also arose because local elites blocked peace processes 
in order to defend their interests, even if it meant 
stalemate or war.
To avoid such tendencies, international administration of 
post-conflict environments (meaning that the UN or specific groups 
of states assume responsibility) became more common in the 
1990s and 2000s. This approach was used in Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
Kosovo, and Timor-Leste. In Afghanistan and Iraq in the 2000s, 
more coercive approaches were used, prioritizing regional and 
international stability and reforming the state (a process often Peace
104
now called ‘statebuilding’). Both approaches only achieved a 
negative peace if at all.
Peacebuilding approaches drew upon the idea that peace can be 
built by external actors such as the UN, donors, NGOs, and 
foreign militaries, based on liberal norms to create a liberal state. 
By the start of the 21st century, an even more ambitious agenda 
emerged via the Millennium Development Goals (2000) and a 
doctrine called the Responsibility to Protect (2005). This implied 
that sovereignty entailed responsibility for citizens, and if a state 
undermined the human rights of its citizens, committed acts of 
genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity, and ethnic 
cleansing, the international community might intervene. These 
trajectories kept developing, with the 2015 UN Sustainable 
Development Goals, and its subsequent Sustaining Peace agenda 
(2018), incorporating new knowledge about local legitimacy and 
sustainability into peace frameworks.
In sum liberal peacebuilding continued the shift towards a positive 
understanding of peace, to which end the UN Peacebuilding 
Commission was established in 2005. Working in countries such as 
Burundi, Sierra Leone, Guinea Bissau, and the Central African 
Republic, the UN Peacebuilding Commission, Peacebuilding Fund, 
and Peacebuilding Support Office were involved in integrating and 
coordinating the range of processes that peacebuilding involved.
Liberal peacebuilding was widely criticized for resting on military 
intervention, being inefficient, and ill coordinated, for assuming 
that promoting democracy, human rights, and trade were enough 
to make peace, and for not paying enough attention to local 
preferences and needs. On average, many peace settlements 
during this period remained partially unimplemented or frozen, 
though improvements in peace and security around the world 
were achieved. Such approaches were also resisted by states such 
as Russia and China, among others, on the grounds that they 
undermined their own regional interests (such as Russia’s Peacekeeping, peacebuilding, and statebuilding
105
influence in the Balkans), represented northern/Western 
hegemony, and were an attack on sovereignty. By the 2000s, such 
countries were developing their own peacekeeping, peacebuilding, 
and development strategies. Most notable, perhaps, was China’s 
‘Belt and Road’ project to connect China with developing markets 
and to stabilize them in China’s interests via debt dependency and 
authoritarian capitalism (as opposed to liberal democracy).
Statebuilding
In the early 2000s, a new doctrine called statebuilding emerged, 
which represented a significant retreat from the normative 
aspirations of the liberal peace (relating to human rights in 
particular). It focused on the basic security and economic 
functions of the state. It represented a fifth stage in the 
development of the IPA, the first stage which involved a retreat 
from the expanding norms and rights that had previously been 
associated with liberal peacebuilding. Increasing state weaknesses 
in the areas of security, crime, and terrorism were seen as the 
main threats to international peace and security, especially in 
relation to states like Afghanistan, Somalia, North Korea, 
Pakistan, and others. Such failing and post-conflict states had 
become breeding grounds for a dangerous mix of terrorism, 
poverty, crime, trafficking, and humanitarian catastrophe, which 
might have spilt over into other states.
The aim of statebuilding was to create prosperous and stable liberal 
states framed by a ‘good governance’ agenda, via externalized 
strategies of intervention. Statebuilding was designed to produce 
an intervention with a small or ‘light footprint’—as in Afghanistan 
before the 2021 withdrawal of American forces—rather than a 
form of trusteeship. According to a 1997 World Bank report, ‘The 
State in a Changing World’, this type of state framework should 
have a set of core functions, ranging from the minimalist functions 
of security, law, and order, to the ‘activist’ functions associated 
with legitimate institutions, public services, welfare, and social Peace
106
support. Statebuilding was assumed to capture both local and 
international forms of legitimacy and especially the local desire for 
sovereignty and modernization. Its genealogy reached back to the 
more substantial reconstruction and nation-building experiments 
after the US civil war, in Germany and Japan, and much of 
Western Europe after the Second World War. Statebuilding was 
favoured by the USA after the 9/11 attacks but suffered serious 
flaws: a lack of a peace dividend and a failure to improve security, 
everyday peace, or social justice, as graphically illustrated in 
contemporary Afghanistan and Iraq.
Assessing recent achievements
Liberal peacebuilding and statebuilding represent the most 
advanced Western and global consensus on the importance of 
international institutions and open markets, and on democracy 
and human rights, in preventing conflict as well as attending to its 
underlying causes. Stage four in the IPA seemed to stabilize the 
previous layers and offer concrete potential for ending war more 
substantially. There was, however briefly, a wide-ranging consensus 
also including non-Western states (though non-developed and 
subaltern actors were less represented). It had some success in 
reducing violence and inducing some compliance with liberal 
norms, institutions, law, and markets. Yet there have been few 
outright ‘successes’ to speak of, partly because the peace dividend 
was weak, cultural norms were not recognized, and nationalism 
and territorialism were maintained because the IPA still depended 
on state-centric systems and approaches. Peace settlements, 
statebuilding, and peacebuilding have tended to lead to a negative 
peace. The number of interstate and civil wars have been reduced, 
as have the number of deaths, however. Thus, this is at least a 
basis for a more positive peace to emerge.
However, many of the UN attempts at democratization since the 
end of the Cold War suffered some form of authoritarian regime 
within several years. Many peace processes stagnated or became Peacekeeping, peacebuilding, and statebuilding
107
frozen during the stage five engagement with statebuilding, 
during which the international community lost impetus and 
focused more on questions affecting northern states’ security, 
particularly with the onset of the War on Terror. In addition, 
international financial institutions like the World Bank and 
International Monetary Fund used structural adjustment and 
development projects that failed to provide the sorts of economic 
opportunities and welfare that would be expected to provide a 
quick ‘peace dividend’. The relationship between peacebuilding 
and justice has also been controversial. Justice often remained 
subservient to stability, particularly because stage five moved 
human rights into a secondary category, and some influential 
individuals and organizations in conflict environments continued 
to be implicated in violence, corruption, or crimes against 
humanity. In effect, liberal peacebuilding and statebuilding 
became systems of governance rather than processes of justice, 
reconciliation, and restitution.
There have been several common complaints:
(i) that there are not enough resources available;
(ii) that there was a lack of local capacity, skill, participation, or 
consent;
(iii) that there was a lack of coordination and too much duplication 
amongst the international actors;
(iv) that the process was mainly owned by international actors rather 
than by its recipients;
(v) that the issues that face society in social and welfare terms were 
ignored;
(vi) that peacebuilding and statebuilding were mainly driven by 
neoliberal marketization and development agendas rather than 
reconciliation;
(vii) that it perpetuated local and international inequality and elite 
predation.Peace
108
Over time blockages to peacekeeping, international mediation, 
conflict resolution, and transformation, as well as peacebuilding 
and statebuilding, have grown. Blocking tactics may evolve into 
more concerted attempts at spoiling a peace process. Such 
counter-peace strategies have become embedded in many peace 
processes, intractable conflicts, and frozen conflicts around the 
world, as in Cyprus, Abkhazia, Bosnia, and Kosovo, and 
many others.
Despite the promise of stage four of the IPA, what emerged with 
stage five were fragile states across conflict-affected regions such 
as the Caucasus or the Balkans, propped up by weakened 
international actors, from the UN, the World Bank, to national 
donors or international NGOs. However, much had been learned 
about peacebuilding through such experiences, including the need 
for locally legitimate systems of authority, political and economic 
frameworks, society, religion, and culture to be part of any 
framework for peace. Hybrid forms of peace and political order 
were now beginning to emerge as a response.109
Chapter 10
Hybrid forms of peace, 
peace formation, and 
counter-peace
In a step beyond liberal peace frameworks, hybrid forms of peace 
have emerged in diverse locations around the world. They 
represent a platform on which a stage six layer of the IPA is being 
built, pointing in sum to the incorporation of issues of historical 
injustice, global inequality, and long-term sustainability into peace 
processes and related activities (as identified in the UN’s recent 
Sustaining Peace Agenda (2018)). Local patterns of politics based 
on everyday, contextual social, cultural, and historical norms, 
identities, and material resources influence peace along with 
Western/northern peace approaches. Hybrid political order and 
hybrid peace is formed through political contestation involving a 
range of actors, their preferences, and security interests. In some 
cases, a negative hybrid peace may be emerging.
An everyday form of peace is its objective, complementing the 
liberal peace that emerged from the internationalist dreams of the 
20th century. It raises the question—in an era when the West is no 
longer internationally dominant—of how local forms of legitimacy, 
or alternative political, social, and economic systems, and norms 
of peace can engage with international forms. Can international 
understandings of a liberal human rights regime (part of the civil 
peace and crucial to a liberal social contract) be reconciled with 
local, customary, or religious practices in very diverse locations 
around the world? How can the material demands for a peace Peace
110
dividend be met after war in this context? A hybrid form of peace 
may therefore be more localized and networked, but it also has to 
deal with the very significant global inequalities that remain 
between states and societies around the world.
Hybrid political orders
Hybrid forms of peaceful political order, especially in intractable 
and frozen conflicts and blocked peace processes, are widespread. 
This is especially in those cases arising since the end of the Second 
World War, from the Korean Peninsula to the Middle East, the 
Balkans, or Colombia. In Somalia, despite the collapsed nature of 
the state, many local communities have organized themselves to 
maintain stability, justice, and the economy through customary 
and ad hoc informal institutions, as notably in Puntland and 
Somaliland. In Timor-Leste, as in Liberia, Mozambique, Sierra 
Leone, Guatemala, the Solomon Islands, and many others, 
international and local cooperation has produced a specifically 
contextual version of peace, to varying degrees incorporating 
customary practices.
There is the potential for positive hybrid forms, as in Timor-Leste 
or Sierra Leone, where local customary law and governance may 
be slowly reshaping and aligning with the modern state. Local 
organizations, operating in civil society, often informally, and 
combining local customs and justice with the emerging modern 
state, have been vital to this process, though elites may also resist 
the required reforms and compromises. Thousands of 
internationally supported local development committees and 
NGOs have been essential to this process. It may require, as in 
Afghanistan, difficult compromises with tribal groups and their 
historical practices, including the Taliban and various warlords, 
which would certainly involve significant reform on their part too. 
The risk—as in Afghanistan—is that it slides into failure rather 
than a positive peace outcome. In Cambodia a negative outcome 
has been the emergence of an authoritarian democracy, though a Hybrid forms of peace, peace formation, and counter-peace
111
vibrant civil society, particularly in the realms of human rights, 
has kept pressure on the government. In Bosnia-Herzegovina, the 
conditions of a weak, post-war state have only been partially 
alleviated by both international support and local communities’ 
attempts at mitigating them, but there has been an acute risk of 
the Dayton Agreement of 1995 collapsing over the last decade.
However, this concept capitalizes on the core of the conflict 
resolution, transformation, and peacebuilding agendas. It 
addresses human needs and root causes, connecting the new state 
or polity with older, locally recognizably legitimate agendas and 
engages with grass roots and the most marginalized members of 
post-conflict polities and their political, social, cultural, and 
economic claims. Whether this provides a basis for a positive form 
of hybrid peace to emerge, or a frozen conflict and a negative form 
of hybrid peace, depends on the development of the overall IPA 
and political will to further refine it.
Recent attempts to refine international policies have followed this 
line of thought over the last decade, most notably with the UN’s 
Sustainable Development Goals (2015) and the Sustaining Peace 
agenda (2017), presaging a new stage six in the IPA. These 
documents point to the significance of the relationship between 
global justice, sustainability, local legitimacy, and the overall IPA.
Local contributions and everyday peace
Local groups have often formed to bring about peace for 
themselves on a small and now widely replicated scale. Everyday 
forms of peace centre around the small things individuals and 
groups can do to de-escalate and avoid local conflict in their 
everyday lives, which over time might lead to more ambitious 
social and political peacemaking strategies. For example, in the 
1990s conflict resolution workshops run in Cyprus by mainly 
American or European scholars allowed Cypriots, many of whom 
had long preferred accommodation and pluralism on the island to Peace
112
nationalism and violence, to meet across the militarized buffer 
zone, which had divided Greek and Turkish Cypriots since 1974 or 
even earlier. Despite problems, local participants were able to use 
the process to build a wider peace constituency, which allowed a 
sophisticated form of everyday coexistence to emerge amongst the 
members of these ‘inter-communal groups’. By the 2000s, formal 
peacemaking attempts recognized the importance of such civil 
society movements, after years of ignoring their potential, and 
they even gained their own building in the bufferzone, which has 
hosted an array of political, social, and cultural activities. 
However, their impact on the political process has been limited in 
recent times.
In Mozambique and Namibia, since the end of their conflicts in 
the 1990s, governments or internationals have not addressed 
social and economic issues fully, given the history of colonization 
and white settlement. Civil society is often described as weak or 
absent, dependent upon fickle donor priorities and funds. 
Nevertheless, local organizations have continued to engage in 
human rights, development, education, or training work, often 
within a subsistence context (meaning they do not receive any 
donor or international support). In Mozambique, one NGO uses 
traditional musical instruments in rural areas to teach people 
about pluralism, peace, and coexistence. Another organization 
developed its own small arms decommissioning project, which 
earned worldwide fame. Weapons are turned into sculptures and 
pieces of art, such as The Throne of Weapons, made by the 
Mozambican artist Cristovao Canhavato from decommissioned 
weapons collected after the end of the civil war in 1992. Such 
small activities often have a broader social significance even if 
political and economic obstacles to peace remain. Their ambitions 
are captured in a famous sculpture outside the UN Building in 
New York (see Figure 8).
In Guatemala, a prosperous European settler community has 
dominated politics and the economy before and even since the Hybrid forms of peace, peace formation, and counter-peace

peace process of the 1990s. The majority community of Mayan 
people often live in rural settings in relative poverty. They have 
developed numerous ways of preserving their culture and identity 
and have increasingly become more successful in finding spaces in 
which they can survive and coexist with the modern state, as well 
as to have their culture and cosmology included in national and 
international fora.
In Sri Lanka, despite very difficult circumstances for any peace 
process during the 2000s, certain local organizations such as the 
National Peace Council have navigated around the problems of 
separatist violence, nationalism and majoritarianism, and ethnic 
and religious chauvinism. The organization, among others, has 
supported rights and pluralism and with skill that other 
internationals, such as mediators from countries like Norway, 
foreign donors, or the UN, have not been able to emulate. While 
the latter have been undermined by rapacious local politics, local 
organizations, working in the areas of human rights and 
peacebuilding, have managed to maintain their roles of advocacy 
and accountability despite difficult, changing local conditions.
In both Kosovo and Bosnia-Herzegovina after the wars and 
during the late 1990s and early 2000s, international actors 
became frustrated with their local counterparts’ tendencies to 
obstruct institutional reforms designed to bring the liberal state 
into being, particularly where these demanded social, cultural, 
political, and economic, reform. The result in Bosnia was deadlock 
over the reform of the state while in Kosovo it brought into being 
a contested state. In Bosnia a number of civil society organizations 
on the ground, involved in human rights and transitional justice 
matters and cultural projects, emerged in an attempt to speed up 
progress in resolving the country’s various problems (though not 
necessarily conforming to international expectations of a liberal 
peace). In Kosovo, a range of organizations had undertaken to 
provide many of the services that the state had refused them 
during the 1980s, and after the war in 1999 they emerged from Hybrid forms of peace, peace formation, and counter-peace
115
the shadows to become part of the new state. Both phenomena 
denote a potential hybrid form of peace and state emerging from 
localized, everyday processes.
In Timor-Leste since independence in 2002 and during the UN 
peacekeeping operation and especially after the recurrence of 
violence in 2006, local actors have been crucial in building a 
hybrid peace that has both social and political dimensions. Two of 
the most visible examples were the return to the landscape of 
‘sacred houses’ and the creation of a social welfare system. Sacred 
houses are centres of family and social life, where local politics, 
arrangements, and economic support are decided, and where 
celebrations and ceremonies take place that bind communities, 
including conflict resolution ceremonies (see Figure 9). Their 
re-emergence is indicative of a deeper stabilization where 
international approaches had failed.
In other cases, such as the Solomon Islands, similar dynamics 
emerged. Most communities gain their law and justice,

Timor-Leste.Peace

representation, and welfare from localized, customary, or 
church-oriented institutions and processes. The modern state 
appears to them to be distant and often predatory, as do 
international markets. Similarly, Afghanistan’s former President 
Hamid Karzai developed his ‘big tent’ strategy to try to be 
inclusive of difficult actors such as the Taliban and a range of 
factions after the war from 2001. However, these attempts at 
creating states that were more inclusive of powerful actors as well 
as a broad range of civil actors have had mixed results. In 
Afghanistan, it led to its co-option by warlords, and in many other 
cases, authoritarian outcomes have emerged.
In all of these cases, the growing role of Chinese and Russian 
interests over the last 20 years has also played a role in both 
supporting a weak state and diverting it away from human 
rights-based approaches. In turn, this has deflected hybrid forms 
of peace away from establishing a relationship between the state, 
everyday legitimacy, and human rights, towards authoritarian 
models which are often populist in nature, as has also been seen 
since the 2007 war in Sri Lanka.
Encouragingly for liberal peacebuilding’s supporters, however, 
civil society actors still seek to develop relations with international 
peacebuilders and donors. Yet, inequality and social exclusion 
(i.e. very high statistical indicators of poverty and inequality) are 
often little changed from the point at which a peace process 
began. This means that there has not been much of a peace 
dividend in everyday life (though there may have been a security 
dividend) in many conflict-affected societies.
Peace formation
It is widely accepted by archaeologists and anthropologists that 
peace systems emerge side by side with violence and war, and 
many of the innovations in the IPA have originally emerged from Hybrid forms of peace, peace formation, and counter-peace
117
social sources. They may become locked into law, constitutions, 
doctrines, and practices at either state or international levels, one 
consolidating the other. Thus, social innovation has historically 
helped form peace, in turn shaping the state, regional, and 
international system. Trust networks, civil society, and social 
movements mobilize over issues pertaining to violence, inequality, 
identity, and unsustainability, which undermine peace and justice, 
thus renegotiating subsequent political order. Even with limited 
power and resources, extensive networks and grounded forms of 
legitimacy are the basis of peace formation. But this often 
represents an asymmetric challenge against political, economic, 
and military power.
Peace formation may draw on social, kin, and customary 
networks. It may include many different types of association, from 
unions to charities or regional trade networks. It may require 
formal international support for civil society. A rich web of 
relationships and networks is emerging from the local to the 
global that oppose embedded injustices and inequalities, 
encapsulated by the concept of global civil society. This operates 
transnationally and transversally (thus transcending traditional 
state boundaries and power structures through formal and 
informal networks) often with access to excellent scientific data as 
well as systems of political and social legitimacy. The capacity for 
self-organization for non-violent resistance or to provide support, 
public services, and even security and policing, where the state is 
non-existent or incapable, has been a common occurrence, as the 
case of Somalia has illustrated since the early 1990s. It is often 
aimed at providing public services—health, education, and basic 
security and needs—in an everyday setting. It may even play a role 
of organizing basic provisions, security, and services in everyday 
life during wartime, as has arisen during the desperate 
circumstances of the Syrian war. Yet, this phenomenon has limited 
capacity and is certainly no replacement for a peace agreement, a 
well-ordered state, and stable regional order.Peace
118
Basing peace projects on locally legitimate institutions, processes, 
customs, identities, and actors and their needs is vital for 
consensus and grounded legitimacy, however. Any such process 
will inevitably be a political choice, probably best made by a wide 
range of actors on the ground and enabled internationally. These 
processes blur the lines between formal and informal dynamics, 
the state, custom, and the traditional. Often women’s groups are 
at the forefront, from Liberia to Bangladesh and Brazil. It places 
society, the village, the community, and the city at the centre of 
peace, rather than the state, security, and markets, and sheds light 
on the bottom-up dynamics necessary for the construction of a 
legitimate political order. It may utilize new forms of media and 
communications, not to mention transport and trade connections, 
or informal networks through academic or global social 
movements or INGOs. Without external support, of course, what 
such local mobilization can achieve in terms of peace formation 
may be very limited. Likewise, without local peace formation 
dynamics, international actors will probably be ineffective in 
promoting change or transformation, resulting in at best a 
negative hybrid form of peace where power is centralized and 
legitimacy is weak.
There were hints of peace formation in early post-Cold War 
peacebuilding frameworks. In post-war El Salvador UNESCO 
supported a Programme on ‘Establishing a Culture of Peace’ in 
1992 that recognized that human development, poverty reduction, 
and addressing root causes also meant engaging with peace in 
cultural terms. By 1995, programmes were under way in 
Mozambique, Burundi, and the Philippines among other 
countries, to connect peacemaking with social values, 
assumptions, and historical perspectives and structures, 
eventually becoming part of a national culture. This approach was 
aimed at respect for difference, solidarity, and social justice in 
general, and the establishment of a wide range of venues and 
spaces of dialogue in which rights, representation, and justice Hybrid forms of peace, peace formation, and counter-peace
119
might emerge. They would eventually coalesce into institutions, 
it was hoped. Local peace architectures link grass-roots 
organizations, local peace councils and committees, with local and 
national governmental institutions, as well as the international 
system more generally, notably its norms and institutional 
framework.
After the Lome Peace Accord in Sierra Leone in 1999, a 
Commission for the Consolidation of Peace was established along 
with national Commissions for Democracy, Human Rights, and 
others. The UN Peacebuilding Commission also helped to 
coordinate these. A parliamentary group also containing civil 
society members was established to work on a ‘national peace 
infrastructure’, which has included a range of fora, including a 
women’s forum. Similarly, in Timor-Leste UNDP supported a 
Ministry of Peacebuilding’s engagement with land and gender 
issues. Local peace councils of elders and activists became 
integrated into formal decentralized government as well as a 
National Peace Council, aimed at mediating conflict using local 
tools. Gradually the local structure built up into a national 
structure, with varying degrees of success. Nepal also established a 
Ministry of Peace and Reconstruction along similar lines, as did 
South Sudan.
In Somaliland in the early 1990s, localized peace agreements 
led by local elders utilizing customary law eventually resulted 
in a constitutional structure that included elected party 
representatives as well as a clan-oriented upper house. 
This grew out of widespread but localized peace conferences 
and discussions across Somaliland driven by the grass roots as 
well as business, clan, and political leaders, which has resulted 
in a reasonably stable polity, though it is as yet unrecognized as 
a state. Similarly, there was hope in Afghanistan, after 2001, 
that long-standing traditions of conflict resolution by tribal 
elders, village councils, the jirga dialogues, and the Peace Peace
120
Shuras or Councils, at local, district, and national level might 
contribute to peace.
In Kenya after the post-election violence of 2007, an Open Forum 
was created and a Citizen’s Agenda for Peace was developed. 
This was based on a peace movement started previously by a 
group of women in 1993, which led to the formation of a series of 
peace committees. This process drew in a number of ministries 
and levels of government and the media, and was also connected 
to the high-level peace process. Crucially, it was driven and 
legitimized by civil society aiming at substantial political reform, 
in a process that is still ongoing.
These innovations in civil society peacemaking have had varying 
degrees of success, mainly because of the asymmetric nature of 
their challenges against powerful actors and the degree of their 
international support. Better understanding of such local peace 
formation dynamics, which were significant for peace and reform 
for the state and the region, influenced the 2011 Busan Agreement 
on a ‘New Deal for Engagement in Fragile States’ amongst the 
main international donors. This emphasized the need for 
legitimate politics, people’s security, and justice, drawing on 
the Millennium Development Goals (2000). The G7+ (an 
organization of so-called ‘fragile states’—the ‘club that everyone 
wants to leave’—including Timor-Leste, Somalia, Sierra Leone, 
and 15 others) influenced this agreement. Such developments 
brought to the fore the notion that societies build peace, not solely 
donors or state elites. This meant ‘putting the last first’ (an insight 
from Development Studies), which was also reflected in the UN 
and World Bank’s report, Pathways to Peace (2017). The 
Sustainable Development Goals (2015) and the subsequent 
Sustaining Peace agenda (2017) further illustrated the close 
convergence of such practices, innovative research, and 
international policymaking on peace issues. Broadly speaking, 
insights of the various debates about peace and the IPA were now 
connected to wider questions about justice and sustainability.Hybrid forms of peace, peace formation, and counter-peace
121
Blockages to peace and counter-peace processes
Despite such progress, many peace processes have become frozen 
and open conflict has often restarted. The Russian regime’s attack 
on Ukraine in 2022, coming long after the unsuccessful Minsk 
Agreements between the two countries in 2014, is one such 
example of why frozen or stalemated peace agreements can 
become so dangerous. Blockages in the peace process have 
commonly emerged across a wide range of cases over the last 
30 years, where such agreements remain unimplemented or are 
impeded, often heralding a new war. Designing peace according to 
the needs, claims, and identities of the most marginalized and 
affected in conflict societies raises the age-old relationship 
between peace and power. Peace depends on the powerful laying 
down arms and power and agreeing to a compromise. Including 
social actors with little hard power is unlikely unless outside 
international actors, themselves with sufficient leverage, support 
peace formation and reject powerful elites’ continuing control of 
politics. This is essentially what happened in the Northern Ireland 
conflict, where the EU and the USA made enormous efforts. Yet, 
elite actors, both domestic and international, control the levers 
and resources of the states system, and so have little incentive to 
support social claims, even if it offers longer-term legitimacy for a 
peace process. In Northern Ireland, in order to meet the multiple 
claims of the two main social groups, local elites as well as the 
British government had to accept a dilution of sovereignty and 
weakening of borders, as well as strengthening rights and the 
principle of equality. Despite this lesson, the tendency to connect 
any agreement and process to security, territorial sovereignty, and 
systems of power-sharing, however, has resulted in many 
contemporary frozen conflicts and peace processes.
Such problems are indicative of how blockages in a complex peace 
process emerge, often connected to polarized power structures 
connecting social groups with elites and international allies, Peace
122
or resting on contradictions between rights, identity, borders, and 
territorial control. Even more extreme is when they begin to add 
up to a parallel counter-peace framework. This represents a 
conservative tradition, concerned with preserving customs, 
territorial structures, centralized power, social, economic, and 
political stratifications, as well as balancing geopolitics. More 
authoritarian and illiberal forms of peace have emerged in 
examples such as Cambodia or Sri Lanka. Increasingly, an array of 
forces and actors have found ways of spoiling, blocking, and 
deflecting peace praxis, its liberal framework, and tendency to 
expand human rights into new terrains. Counter-peace strategies, 
following the logic of counter-revolution, operate to preserve 
privileges, power, and resources, often long held and thought to 
represent order. They have evolved to spoil and check 
peacekeeping, mediation, diplomacy, constitutional reform, 
human rights, economic redistribution, and equality. Violence 
remains proscribed but blockages lead to frozen conflicts and very 
lengthy peace engagements, as from the Golan Heights to Cyprus 
and the Balkans, which are always in danger of collapsing back 
into war—as in Ukraine in 2022.123
Epilogue: new agendas 
for peace
The historical evolution of peace can be summarized as follows. 
The ancient to the medieval period saw the development of the 
victor’s peace, wise governance to avoid war, truces and 
treaty-making to end wars, the realization of the advantages 
of achievement of prosperity, and a growing role for religious 
and social movements, which preached philosophical pluralism 
and pacifism.
The Enlightenment period added a concern with domestic and 
international law and norms to govern state behaviour, the liberal 
social contract (the constitutional peace), social movements for 
anti-slavery, enfranchisement, disarmament and pacifism, labour 
movements, human rights, and free trade.
The modern period saw these interests extend into social and 
gender issues, as well as equality and social justice (which is 
known as the civil peace). It also saw the emergence of 
international organizations, law, and conventions, forming an 
institutional peace. Other matters also emerged in the context of 
decolonization and the collapse of the Soviet Union, including 
self-determination, development, aid, the democratic peace, and 
trade. To achieve these, humanitarian intervention, liberal 
peacebuilding, and neoliberal statebuilding were developed, along 
with processes of transitional justice, in post-conflict countries Peace
124
around the world. Over time all of these developments coalesced 
into an international peace architecture, complex and 
fragmentary, but significant nonetheless.
With the notable return of authoritarian nationalism, with Russia’s 
war in Ukraine in 2022, Russia’s apparent alliance with China and 
other regional powers, and nationalist ideologies competing with 
Western versions of liberal peace, there is also a major question as 
to what version of peace and international order the global south 
might prefer. Will such states opt for a victor’s peace and 
realpolitik all over again, will new alternatives emerge, and would 
they be built on the existing international peace architecture?
New agendas and the IPA
The older notions of peace still play an important role as 
foundational layers of the IPA. Peacemaking and the complex 
machinery it requires has advanced considerably throughout 
history, even though it remains far from ideal. When confronted 
with transnational problems and political tensions which relate to 
inequality, environmental unsustainability, injustice, the arms 
trade, human trafficking, nuclear proliferation, urban conflict, and 
the use of new technologies, new agendas for peace are emerging. 
As peace systems have become more complex, with new layers and 
tools being added as conflict, violence, and war evolve, they have 
also become more costly and require more political will.
The evolution of the IPA has brought together the victor’s peace 
applied to imperial and industrial state orders in stage one, which 
remains relevant in policy thinking and influences conflict 
management approaches. Stage two, the constitutional and liberal 
peace, were significant attempts to move beyond the cruder 
versions of the victor’s peace, by focusing on democracy, human 
rights, development, and free trade, and placing the West as the 
leader of the IPA. This has provided the basis for the bulk of 
post-Enlightenment advances in peace thinking and practices. Epilogue
125
Similarly, the third strand of the IPA, which dealt with expanded 
(ECOSOC) rights after industrialized warfare ended in 1945, and 
decolonization thereafter, was also influential. This is now the goal 
of much of the UN system, and represents the main contribution 
of the 20th century, being consolidated in stage four, the liberal 
peacebuilding system, after the end of the Cold War.
The four components of the liberal peace—victor’s, constitutional, 
institutional, and civil peace, as well as the first, second, and third 
generation approaches to peacemaking—depend upon a mix of 
external actors’ intervention, local agency, and legitimacy. The 
liberal peace is depicted in Figure 10 and the first three generations 
of peacemaking can be summarized as in Figure 11.

126
However, after failures from Somalia to Rwanda and the Balkans, 
the IPA began to shift into a more limited neoliberal framework 
for peace in stage five as was applied in Afghanistan and Iraq. 
Given the failures in the 2010s and onwards in Libya, Syria, 
Yemen, Afghanistan, and other cases, stage six is as yet 
undetermined. It must stabilize many frozen conflicts and open 
wars, from Syria to Ukraine, as well as deal with new phenomena 
and technologies in warfare (AI and automated weapons, 
proliferation of small arms and worse, hybrid warfare, urban 
violence, and more), as well as nationalism, populism, inequality, 
authoritarianism, and environmental unsustainability.
A new layer of the IPA is now required to deal with new conflict 
dynamics and the demands for a form of peace more closely 
connected with justice. This process will probably not lead to a 
world government (to the disappointment of some liberal 
internationalists and the relief of others attuned to nationalism, 
political, and identity differences), however, but instead may 
indicate a world community made up of interlocking, pluralist, or 
‘pluriversal’ ‘peaces’: a ‘Grand Design’ to quote the Duc de Sully 
(1560‒1641), a 17th-century philosopher. It may include different

types of states, institutions, and norms, as well as new transnational 
and transversal networks that include official, civil, and social 
actors and groups. It reaffirms that only cooperation, inclusivity, 
pluralism, and redistribution can maintain an ever-evolving IPA. 
The UNESCO definition of a ‘culture of peace’ (cited above) 
represents a sophisticated institutional understanding of peace. 
The more recent Sustaining Peace agenda the UN is developing 
(2018) connects such thinking to political, diplomatic, military, and 
economic tools, in the broader context of justice and sustainability 
issues, which is a further step forward. Yet, as the World Bank has 
estimated, 1.5 billion people are still affected by conflict.
A new layer of the IPA and generation of peace thinking and 
practice may involve hybrid, empathetic, emancipatory notions of 
peace resting upon pluralism and international responses to 
inequality, meaning local and global redistribution, sustainability 
and global justice, the recognition of a range of everyday and 
transnational peace agencies, and participatory forms of 
democracy from the local to the global. Rather than being 
externally imposed it might form locally and be enabled in 
multiple ways by a range of international and local actors 
cooperating with each other (as with the local infrastructures for 
peace already mentioned). It requires historical, distributive, and 
global justice.
Overall, the IPA represents a response to past conflicts and to 
prevent future conflict. It has often reflected the interests and 
ideologies of dominant actors in the international system. Even so, 
as this volume has illustrated, approaches to peace are developing 
quickly and with far-reaching effects for improving everyday lives 
for humanity. Much more remains to be done, however.
The outcome of the rich, global, historical heritage of peace 
thinking and peacemaking spanning the arts to history and 
politics, as well as social struggles for equality outlined in this 
short study, is the emergence of interconnected and multiple Peace
128
forms of peace. Its culmination lies in a general recognition that 
the vast majority of humanity have preferred, and actively worked 
towards, a culture of peace. Many have worked for this selflessly 
throughout human history, across all fields of human knowledge, 
leaving an inestimable legacy upon which future generations can 
continue to build.Further reading

A Very Short Introduction
Joseph M. Siracusa
Like making war, diplomacy has been around a very long
time, at least since the Bronze Age. It was primitive by
today’s standards, there were few rules, but it was a
recognizable form of diplomacy. Since then, diplomacy has
evolved greatly, coming to mean different things, to different
persons, at different times, ranging from the elegant to the
inelegant. Whatever one’s definition, few could doubt that the
course and consequences of the major events of modern
international diplomacy have shaped and changed the global
world in which we live. Joseph M. Siracusa introduces the
subject of diplomacy from a historical perspective, providing
examples from significant historical phases and episodes to
illustrate the art of diplomacy in action.
‘Professor Siracusa provides a lively introduction to diplomacy
through the perspective of history.’
Gerry Woodard, Senior Fellow in Political Science at the University of
Melbourne and former Australasian Ambassador in Asia
www.oup.com/vsiHuman Rights
A Very Short Introduction
Andrew Clapham
An appeal to human rights in the face of injustice can be a
heartfelt and morally justified demand for some, while for others
it remains merely an empty slogan. Taking an international
perspective and focusing on highly topical issues such as torture,
arbitrary detention, privacy, health and discrimination, this Very
Short Introduction will help readers to understand for themselves
the controversies and complexities behind this vitally relevant
issue. Looking at the philosophical justification for rights, the
historical origins of human rights and how they are formed in law,
Andrew Clapham explains what our human rights actually are,
what they might be, and where the human rights movement is
heading.
www.oup.com/vsiThe United
Nations
A Very Short Introduction
Jussi M. Hanhima¨ki
With this much-needed introduction to the UN, Jussi Hanhima¨ki
engages the current debate over the organization’s effectiveness
as he provides a clear understanding of how it was originally
conceived, how it has come to its present form, and how it
must confront new challenges in a rapidly changing world. After
a brief history of the United Nations and its predecessor, the
League of Nations, the author examines the UN’s successes
and failures as a guardian of international peace and security,
as a promoter of human rights, as a protector of international law,
and as an engineer of socio-economic development.

Relations
A Very Short Introduction
Paul Wilkinson
Of undoubtable relevance today, in a post-9-11 world of
growing political tension and unease, this Very Short
Introduction covers the topics essential to an understanding of
modern international relations. Paul Wilkinson explains the
theories and the practice that underlies the subject, and
investigates issues ranging from foreign policy, arms control,
and terrorism, to the environment and world poverty. He
examines the role of organizations such as the United Nations
and the European Union, as well as the influence of ethnic
and religious movements and terrorist groups which also play
a role in shaping the way states and governments interact.
This up-to-date book is required reading for those seeking a
new perspective to help untangle and decipher international
events.
www.oup.com/vsiThe European
Union
A Very Short Introduction
John Pinder & Simon Usherwood
This Very Short Introduction explains the European Union in plain
English. Fully updated for 2007 to include controversial and
current topics such as the Euro currency, the EU’s enlargement,
and its role in ongoing world affairs, this accessible guide shows
how and why the EU has developed from 1950 to the present.
Covering a range of topics from the Union’s early history and
the ongoing interplay between ‘eurosceptics’ and federalists, to
the single market, agriculture, and the environment, the authors
examine the successes and failures of the EU, and explain the
choices that lie ahead in the 21st century.
www.oup.com/vsiThe U.S Congress
A Very Short Introduction
Donald Richie
The world’s most powerful national legislature, the U. S.
Congress, remains hazy as an institution. This Very Short
Introduction to Congress highlights the rules, precedents, and
practices of the Senate and House of Representatives, and
offers glimpses into their committees and floor proceedings to
reveal the complex processes by which they enact legislation.
In The U.S. Congress, Donald A. Ritchie, a congressional
historian for more than thirty years, takes readers on a
fascinating, behind-the-scenes tour of Capitol Hill-pointing out
the key players, explaining their behaviour, and translating
parliamentary language into plain English.
www.oup.com/vsiFree Speech
A Very Short Introduction
Nigel Warburton
‘I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death
your right to say it’ This slogan, attributed to Voltaire, is frequently
quoted by defenders of free speech. Yet it is rare to find anyone
prepared to defend all expression in every circumstance,
especially if the views expressed incite violence. So where do
the limits lie? What is the real value of free speech? Here, Nigel
Warburton offers a concise guide to important questions facing
modern society about the value and limits of free speech:
Where should a civilized society draw the line? Should we be free
to offend other people’s religion? Are there good grounds for
censoring pornography? Has the Internet changed everything?
This Very Short Introduction is a thought-provoking, accessible,
and up-to-date examination of the liberal assumption that free
speech is worth preserving at any cost.
‘The genius of Nigel Warburton’s Free Speech lies not only in
its extraordinary clarity and incisiveness. Just as important is the
way Warburton addresses freedom of speech - and attempts to
stifle it - as an issue for the 21st century. More than ever, we need
this book.’
Denis Dutton, University of Canterbury, New Zealand
www.oup.com/vsiCitizenship
A Very Short Introduction
Richard Bellamy
Interest in citizenship has never been higher. But what does it
mean to be a citizen of a modern, complex community? Why is
citizenship important? Can we create citizenship, and can we
test for it? In this fascinating Very Short Introduction, Richard
Bellamy explores the answers to these questions and more in a
clear and accessible way. He approaches the subject from a
political perspective, to address the complexities behind the
major topical issues. Discussing the main models of citizenship,
exploring how ideas of citizenship have changed through time
from ancient Greece to the present, and examining notions of
rights and democracy, he reveals the irreducibly political nature
of citizenship today.
‘Citizenship is a vast subject for a short introduction, but Richard
Bellamy has risen to the challenge with aplomb.’
Mark Garnett, TLS
www.oup.com/vsiAmerican Political
Parties and
Elections
A Very Short Introduction
Sandy L. Maisel
Few Americans and even fewer citizens of other nations
understand the electoral process in the United States. Still fewer
understand the role played by political parties in the electoral
process or the ironies within the system. Participation in elections
in the United States is much lower than in the vast majority of
mature democracies. Perhaps this is because of the lack of
competition in a country where only two parties have a true
chance of winning, despite the fact that a large number of
citizens claim allegiance to neither and think badly of both.
Studying these factors, you begin to get a very clear picture
indeed of the problems that underlay this much trumpeted
electoral system.
www.oup.com/vsiPrivacy
A Very Short Introduction
Raymond Wacks
Professor Raymond Wacks is a leading international expert
on privacy. For more than three decades he has published
numerous books and articles on this controversial subject.
Privacy is a fundamental value that is under attack from several
quarters. Electronic surveillance, biometrics, CCTV, ID cards,
RFID codes, online security, the monitoring of employees,
the uses and misuses of DNA, - to name but a few - all raise
fundamental questions about our right to privacy. This Very Short
Introduction also analyzes the tension between free speech
and privacy generated by intrusive journalism, photography,
and gratuitous disclosures by the media of the private lives
of celebrities. Professor Wacks concludes this stimulating
introduction by considering the future of privacy in our society.
