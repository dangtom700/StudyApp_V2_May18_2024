In preparing this new edition, we were struck by how the cliché of “living in changing 
times” is becoming almost ironic. The events of each day remind us that things are mov￾ing far more quickly and unpredictably than we could ever have imagined. Consider the 
U.S. economic turmoil brought on by the mortgage- lending crisis and the record price of 
crude oil, which seemingly rises independent of consumption. Or think about the run￾up to the 2008 U.S. presidential election. It strikes us as just a bit surreal to see the word 
CHANGE plastered on the speaker’s podium and waved by supporters every time Barack 
Obama comes out to speak. Not to be outdone, Hillary Clinton’s key selling point is her 
emphasis that she has the ability to lead change. By the time the next edition of this book 
comes out, a new president will be well into her or his first term and we will no doubt 
have experienced a lot of change. 
Nor is change confined to the United States. As we write this, the new prime min￾ister of France is shaking up that country’s work rules, organizations, and policies. 
Beijing is preparing to host the Olympic Games and show the world a whole new 
China. Countries in Africa are dealing with drought, AIDS, military dictatorships, and 
the emergence of democracy. The war in Iraq remains a point of contention among 
many, and the Middle East remains embroiled in controversy and seemingly intrac￾table problems.
Nor is change restricted to governments and organizations. Our personal lives are 
embedded in change and the dilemmas it poses. Individuals and families are finding 
that the pace of change exceeds their physical and mental capacity to cope with it. As 
people experience change accelerating, they tend to feel overwhelmed and alienated. 
They experience what sociologists call “anomie,” a state of being characterized by 
the lack of social norms or anchors of stable and shared values. Many Americans, for 
example, want more time with their families but feel compelled to work longer hours, 
make more money, and satisfy escalating needs; they espouse diversity but push other 
cultures to do it “the American way”; they argue that technology will find an answer 
to the global warming problem and so justify acquiring a Hummer. 
Nor is change limited to social systems and their environments. Organization 
Development—the field of planned change itself—is changing. In a time of unprec￾edented change, our views of how and when planned change occurs, who leads and 
controls it, and what contributes to its success are all changing. Since the last edition 
of this text, three OD handbooks have been published, a special issue of the Journal of 
Applied Behavioral Science has been devoted to “reinvigorate OD” and another special 
issue on international OD is on its way, and volumes on change management and 
organization transformation have continued to flood the bookstores. Conversations 
among OD practitioners and scholars about where the field is and should be headed 
have become more vigorous. The drive to understand and do something about change 
continues unabated.
In times like these, books on OD and change have never been more relevant and 
necessary. For our part, this is the ninth edition of the market-leading text in the field. 
OD is an applied field of change that uses behavioral science knowledge to increase 
prefacexvi
the capacity for change, and to improve the functioning and performance of organiza￾tions. OD is more than change management, however, and the field would do well to 
differentiate itself from the mechanistic, programmatic assumptions that organization 
change can simply be scripted by various methods of “involving” people and “enroll￾ing” them in the change. OD is not concerned about change for change’s sake, a way 
to implement the latest fad, or a pawn for doing management’s bidding. It is about 
learning and improving in ways that make individuals, groups, organizations, and 
ultimately the world better off and more capable of managing change in the future. 
Moreover, OD is more than a set of values. It is not a front for the promulgation of 
humanistic and spiritual beliefs nor a set of interventions that boil down to “holding 
hands and singing Kumbaya.” It is a set of testable ideas and practices about how social 
and technical systems can coexist to produce individual satisfaction and sustainable 
organizational results. Finally, OD is more than a set of tools and techniques. It is not 
a bunch of “interventions” looking to be applied in whatever organization that comes 
along. It is an integrated theory and practice aimed at increasing the effectiveness of 
organizations.
In today’s reality, OD is often misunderstood and its relevance questioned. As men￾tioned above, OD is often used synonymously with change management; it is often 
defined and overly constrained by its association with a set of “touchy-feely” values; 
and it is often described as a hammer looking for a nail. As a result, it is open to discus￾sion whether OD is up to the task of facilitating the changes that organizations need to 
exist and thrive in the world today. This is OD’s challenge in the decade and century 
ahead. Can it implement change and teach the system to change itself at the same 
time? Will it cling to its humanistic traditions and focus on functioning or increase its 
relevance by integrating more performance-related values? How will OD incorporate 
values related to globalization, cultural integration, the concentration of wealth, and 
environmental sustainability? Can it afford not to address the issues that threaten an 
organization’s survival? These are heady questions for a field barely 55 years old.
The original edition of this text, authored by OD pioneer Edgar Huse in 1975, 
became a market leader because it faced the relevance issue. It took an objective, 
research perspective and placed OD practice on stronger theoretical footing. Ed showed 
that, in some cases, OD did produce meaningful results but that additional work was 
still needed. Sadly, Ed passed away following the publication of the second edition. His 
wife, Mary Huse, asked Tom Cummings to revise the book for subsequent editions. 
With the fifth edition, Tom asked Chris Worley to work with him in writing the text.
The most recent editions have had an important influence on the perception of 
OD. While maintaining the book’s strengths of even treatment and unbiased report￾ing, the newer editions made even larger strides in placing OD on a strong theoretical 
foundation. They broadened the scope and increased the relevance of OD by includ￾ing interventions that had a content component, including work design, employee 
involvement, and organization structure. They took another step toward relevance 
and suggested that OD had begun to incorporate a strategic perspective. This strategic 
orientation proposed that OD could be as concerned with performance issues as it was 
with human potential. Effective OD, from this newer perspective, relied as much on 
knowledge about organization theory and econo mics as it did on the behavioral sci￾ences. It is our greatest hope that the current edition continues this tradition of rigor 
and relevance.
REVISIONS TO THE NINTH EDITION
Our goal in the ninth edition is to update the field once again. Although we have retained 
several features of the prior editions, we have made some important changes. 
Prefacexvii
Strategic Emphasis
In keeping with the increasingly strategic focus of OD, we have expanded the strategic 
interventions part of the book from two chapters to three chapters. Chapter 20 now 
describes transformational change and focuses on the interventions and processes 
associated with episodic forms of large-scale change. There is a whole new section on 
organization redesign interventions. Chapter 21 is devoted to describing continuous 
change in organizations, with a new section on built-to-change organizations. Finally, 
Chapter 22 now combines interventions about multiple organizations, including trans￾organizational development, mergers and acquisitions, joint ventures, and networks. 
Human Resources Interventions
In addition, the human resources interventions part of the text has been completely 
reorganized and revised. The original two chapters have been expanded to three chap￾ters. While we retained the performance management chapter, there is a new chapter 
on developing talent (Chapter 18) that includes training, leadership development, 
career management, and coaching. Chapter 19 has been refocused on managing work￾force diversity, wellness, and stress. 
Key Chapter Revisions
Other chapters have received important updates and improvements. In Chapter 14—
“Restructuring Organizations”—a new section on “customer-centric” organizations 
was added to reflect important advances in this area. In Chapter 24—“OD in Health 
Care, School Systems, the Public Sector, and Family-Owned Businesses”—each sec￾tion has been completely re-written by new guest authors. Finally, Chapter 25—“Future 
Directions in Organization Development”—has received a thorough revision based on 
the authors’ recent research.
DISTINGUISHING PEDAGOGICAL FEATURES
The text is designed to facilitate the learning of OD theory and interventions. We 
maintained the chapter sequence from the previous edition. Based on feedback from 
reviewers, this format more closely matches the OD process. Instructors can teach the 
process and then link OD practice to the interventions. 
Organization
The ninth edition is organized into seven parts. Following an introductory chapter 
that describes the definition and history of OD, Part 1 provides an overview of orga￾nization development. It discusses the fundamental theories that underlie planned 
change (Chapter 2) and describes the people who practice it (Chapter 3). Part 2 is an 
eight-chapter description of the OD process. It describes how OD practitioners enter 
and contract with client systems (Chapter 4); diagnose organizations, groups, and jobs 
(Chapters 5 and 6); collect, analyze, and feedback diagnostic data (Chapters 7 and 8); 
design interventions (Chapter 9); lead and manage change (Chapter 10); and evaluate 
and institutionalize change (Chapter 11). In this manner, professors can focus on the 
OD process without distraction. Parts 3, 4, 5, and 6 then cover the major OD interven￾tions used today according to the same classification scheme used in previous editions 
of the text. Part 3 covers human process interventions; Part 4 describes technostruc￾tural approaches; Part 5 presents interventions in human resources management; and 
Part 6 addresses strategic change interventions. In the final section, Part 7, we cover 
special applications of OD, including international OD (Chapter 23); OD in health 
care, family businesses, schools, and the public sector (Chapter 24); and the future of 
Prefacexviii
OD (Chapter 25). We believe this ordering provides professors with more flexibility in 
teaching OD.
Applications
Within each chapter, we describe actual situations in which different OD techniques 
or interventions were used. These applications provide students with a chance to see 
how OD is actually practiced in organizations. In the ninth edition, more than 33% 
of the applications are new and many others have been updated to maintain the 
text’s currency and relevance. In response to feedback from reviewers, almost all of 
the applications describe a real situation in a real organization (although sometimes 
we felt it necessary to use disguised names). In many cases, the organizations are 
large public companies that should be readily recognizable. We have endeavored 
to write applications based on our own OD practice or that have appeared in the 
popular literature. In addition, we have asked several of our students to submit 
descriptions of their own practice and these applications appear throughout the text. 
The time and effort to produce these vignettes of OD practice for others is gratefully 
acknowledged. 
Cases
At the end of each major part in the book, we have included cases to permit a more 
in-depth discussion of the OD process. Seven of the 16 cases are new to the ninth edi￾tion. We have kept some cases that have been favorites over the years but have also 
replaced some of the favorites with newer ones. Also in response to feedback from 
users of the text, we have endeavored to provide cases that vary in levels of detail, 
complexity, and sophistication to allow the professor some flexibility in teaching the 
material to either undergraduate or graduate students.
Internet Resources
Throughout the book, we have tried to provide references to the Internet, particularly 
to sites related to the organizations discussed. Although these sites are often updated, 
moved, or altogether abandoned (so we cannot guarantee that the links will be main￾tained as cited), these provide students with an opportunity to explore the information 
available on the Internet.
Audience
This book can be used in a number of different ways and by a variety of people. First, 
it serves as a primary textbook in organization development for students at both the 
undergraduate and graduate levels. Second, the book can also serve as an independent 
study guide for individuals wishing to learn more about how organization develop￾ment can improve productivity and human satisfaction. Third, the book is intended to 
be of value to OD professionals, executives and administrators, specialists in such fields 
as personnel, training, occupational stress, and human resources management, and 
anyone interested in the complex process known as organization development. 
EDUCATIONAL AIDS AND SUPPLEMENTS
Instructor’s Manual with Test Bank (ISBN: 0-324-58057-6)
To assist instructors in the delivery of a course on organization development, an 
instructor’s manual is available. It has been revised in response to feedback from users. 
The manual contains material that can improve the student’s appreciation of OD and 
improve the instructor’s effectiveness in the classroom.
Prefacexix
Chapter Objectives and Lecture Notes For each chapter, summary learning objec￾tives provide a quick orientation to the chapter’s material. The material in the chapter 
is then outlined and comments are made concerning important pedagogical points, 
such as crucial assumptions that should be noted for students, important aspects of 
practical application, and alternative points of view that might be used to enliven class 
discussion.
Exam Questions A variety of multiple choice, true/false, and essay questions are 
suggested for each chapter. Instructors can use these questions directly or to suggest 
additional questions reflecting the professor’s own style. 
Case Notes For each case in the text, teaching notes have been developed to assist 
instructors in preparing for case discussions. The notes provide an outline of the case, 
suggestions about where to place the case during the course, discussion questions to 
focus student attention, and an analysis of the case situation. In combination with the 
professor’s own insights, the notes can help to enliven the case discussion or role plays.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
Our friends and colleagues are always asking about “the text.” “Why did you include 
that?” “Why didn’t you include this?” “When are you going to revise it again?” “I have 
some suggestions that might improve this section.” And so on. It is gratifying, after 
eight (and now nine) editions, that people find the book provocative, refer to it, use it 
to guide their practice, and assign it as required reading in their courses. Even though 
the text is revised every three years or so, it seems to be a common subject of con￾versation whenever we get together with our OD colleagues and students. When it 
does come time for revision, it provides us a chance to refresh, renew, and reestablish 
Prefacexx
our relationship with them. “What have you heard about what’s new in OD?” “How’s 
your family?” “Do you think we should reorganize the book?” “What’s next in your 
career?” “Did you see that article in (pick a journal or magazine)?” “What have you 
been reading lately?”
And then the research, reading, writing, editing, and proofing begins. Writing, 
debates, and editing occupy most of our time. “Can we say that better, more efficiently, 
and more clearly?” “Should we create a new section or revise the existing one?” “Do 
you really think people want to read that?” The permission requests go out and come 
in quickly . . . at least most of them. Follow up faxes, reminder e-mails, and urgent 
phone calls are made. The search for new cases and applications is an ongoing activity. 
“Where can we find good descriptions of change?” “Would you be willing to write up 
that case?” Deadlines come . . . and go. The copy editing process is banter between two 
strangers. “No, no, no, I meant to say that.” “Yes, that’s a good idea, I hadn’t thought 
of that.” Six months into it, our wives start to ask, “When will it be done?” Then, the 
result of having done this before, they ask, “no, I meant when will it be done, done?” 
When the final proofs arrive, things start to look finished. We get to see the art work 
and the cover design, and a new set of problems emerge. “Where did that come from?” 
“No, this goes there, that goes here.” Doesn’t this sound fun? 
So, yes, we continue to hope that our readers, colleagues, and friends ask us about 
“the text.” We like talking about it, discussing it, and hearing about what we did right 
or wrong. But please don’t ask us about writing “the text.” We’re very happy to be done 
(yes, done, done).
Finally, we’d like to thank those who supported us in this effort. We are grateful to our 
families: Chailin Cummings and the Worley clan, Debbie, Sarah, Hannah, and Samuel. 
We would also like to thank our students for their comments on the previous edition, 
for contributing many of the applications, and for helping us to try out new ideas and 
perspectives. A particular word of thanks goes to Gordon Brooks, Brigette Worthen, and 
the Pepperdine MSOD faculty (Ann Feyerherm, Miriam Lacey, Terri Egan, and Gary 
Mangiofico). Our colleagues at USC’s Center for Effective Organizations—Ed Lawler, 
Sue Mohrman, John Boudreau, Alec Levenson, Jim O’Toole, Jay Conger, and Jay 
Galbraith—have been consistent sources of support and intellectual inquiry. As well,

Preface1
General Introduction to Organization 
Development
This is a book about organization development 
(OD)—a process that applies a broad range of 
behavioral science knowledge and practices to 
help organizations build their capacity to change 
and to achieve greater effectiveness, includ￾ing increased financial performance, customer 
satisfaction, and organization member engage￾ment. Organization development differs from 
other planned change efforts, such as project 
management or innovation, because the focus 
is on building the organization’s ability to assess 
its current functioning and to achieve its goals. 
Moreover, OD is oriented to improving the total 
system—the organization and its parts in the con￾text of the larger environment that affects them.
This book reviews the broad background of 
OD and examines assumptions, strategies and 
models, intervention techniques, and other 
aspects of OD. This chapter provides an intro￾duction to OD, describing first the concept 
of OD itself. Second, it explains why OD has 
expanded rapidly in the past 50 years, both 
in terms of people’s need to work with and 
through others in organizations and in terms 
of organizations’ need to adapt in a complex 
and changing world. Third, it reviews briefly 
the history of OD, and fourth, it describes the 
evolution of OD into its current state. This intro￾duction to OD is followed by an overview of the 
rest of the book.
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT DEFINED
Organization development is both a professional field of social action and an area of 
scientific inquiry. The practice of OD covers a wide spectrum of activities, with seem￾ingly endless variations upon them. Team building with top corporate management, 
structural change in a municipality, and job enrichment in a manufacturing firm are all 
examples of OD. Similarly, the study of OD addresses a broad range of topics, including 
the effects of change, the methods of organizational change, and the factors influenc￾ing OD success.
A number of definitions of OD exist and are presented in Table 1.1. Each definition 
has a slightly different emphasis. For example, Burke’s description focuses attention 
on culture as the target of change; French’s definition is concerned with OD’s long￾term interest and the use of consultants; and Beckhard’s and Beer’s definitions address 
the process of OD. More recently, Burke and Bradford’s definition broadens the range 
and interests of OD. Worley and Feyerherm suggested that for a process to be called 
organization development, (1) it must focus on or result in the change of some aspect 
of the organizational system; (2) there must be learning or the transfer of knowledge 
or skill to the client system; and (3) there must be evidence of improvement in or an 
intention to improve the effectiveness of the client system.1
 The following definition 
incorporates most of these views and is used in this book: Organization development is a 
systemwide application and transfer of behavioral science knowledge to the planned development, 2 CHAPTER 1 General Introduction to Organization Development
improvement, and reinforcement of the strategies, structures, and processes that lead to organiza￾tion effectiveness. This definition emphasizes several features that differentiate OD from 
other approaches to organizational change and improvement, such as management 
consulting, innovation, project management, and operations management. The defi￾nition also helps to distinguish OD from two related subjects, change management and 
organization change, that also are addressed in this book.
First, OD applies to changes in the strategy, structure, and/or processes of an entire 
system, such as an organization, a single plant of a multiplant firm, a department 
or work group, or individual role or job. A change program aimed at modifying an 
organization’s strategy, for example, might focus on how the organization relates to a 
wider environment and on how those relationships can be improved. It might include 
changes both in the grouping of people to perform tasks (structure) and in methods 
of communicating and solving problems (process) to support the changes in strategy. 
Similarly, an OD program directed at helping a top management team become more 
effective might focus on interactions and problem-solving processes within the group. 
This focus might result in the improved ability of top management to solve company 
problems in strategy and structure. This contrasts with approaches focusing on one or 
only a few aspects of a system, such as technological innovation or operations manage￾ment. In these approaches, attention is narrowed to improvement of particular prod￾ucts or processes, or to development of production or service delivery functions.
Second, OD is based on the application and transfer of behavioral science knowledge 
and practice, including microconcepts, such as leadership, group dynamics, and work 
design, and macroapproaches, such as strategy, organization design, and international 
Definitions of Organization Development
Organization development is a planned process of change in an organization’s 
culture through the utilization of behavioral science technology, research, and 
theory. (Warner Burke)2
Organization development refers to a long-range effort to improve an organization’s 
problem-solving capabilities and its ability to cope with changes in its external 
environment with the help of external or internal behavioral-scientist consultants, 
or change agents, as they are sometimes called. (Wendell French)3
Organization development is an effort (1) planned, (2) organization-wide, and 
(3) managed from the top, to (4) increase organization effectiveness and health 
through (5) planned interventions in the organization’s “processes,” using 
behavioral science knowledge. (Richard Beckhard)4
Organization development is a systemwide process of data collection, diagnosis, 
action planning, intervention, and evaluation aimed at (1) enhancing congruence 
among organizational structure, process, strategy, people, and culture; (2) developing 
new and creative organizational solutions; and (3) developing the organization’s self￾renewing capacity. It occurs through the collaboration of organizational members 
working with a change agent using behavioral science theory, research, and 
technology. (Michael Beer)5
Based on (1) a set of values, largely humanistic; (2) application of the behavioral 
sciences; and (3) open systems theory, organization development is a system￾wide process of planned change aimed toward improving overall organization 
effectiveness by way of enhanced congruence of such key organization dimensions 
as external environment, mission, strategy, leadership, culture, structure, information 
and reward systems, and work policies and procedures. (Warner Burke and David 
Bradford)6

relations. These subjects distinguish OD from such applications as management consult￾ing, technological innovation, or operations management that emphasize the economic, 
financial, and technical aspects of organizations. These approaches tend to neglect the 
personal and social characteristics of a system. Moreover, OD is distinguished by its 
intent to transfer behavioral science knowledge and skill so that the system is more 
capable of carrying out planned change in the future.
Third, OD is concerned with managing planned change, but not in the formal sense 
typically associated with management consulting or project management, which tends 
to comprise programmatic and expert-driven approaches to change. Rather, OD is 
more an adaptive process for planning and implementing change than a blueprint for 
how things should be done. It involves planning to diagnose and solve organizational 
problems, but such plans are flexible and often revised as new information is gathered 
as the change program progresses. If, for example, there was concern about the perfor￾mance of a set of international subsidiaries, a reorganization process might begin with 
plans to assess the current relationships between the international divisions and the 
corporate headquarters and to redesign them if necessary. These plans would be modi￾fied if the assessment discovered that most of the senior management teams were not 
given adequate cross-cultural training prior to their international assignments.
Fourth, OD involves the design, implementation, and the subsequent reinforce￾ment of change. It moves beyond the initial efforts to implement a change program 
to a longer-term concern for appropriately institutionalizing new activities within the 
organization. For example, implementing self-managed work teams might focus on 
ways in which supervisors could give workers more control over work methods. After 
workers had more control, attention would shift to ensuring that supervisors contin￾ued to provide that freedom. That assurance might include rewarding supervisors for 
managing in a participative style. This attention to reinforcement is similar to training 
and development approaches that address maintenance of new skills or behaviors, 
but it differs from other change perspectives that do not address how a change can be 
institutionalized.
Finally, OD is oriented to improving organizational effectiveness. Effectiveness is 
best measured along three dimensions. First, OD affirms that an effective organization 
is adaptable; it is able to solve its own problems and focus attention and resources on 
achieving key goals. OD helps organization members gain the skills and knowledge 
necessary to conduct these activities by involving them in the change process. Second, 
an effective organization has high financial and technical performance, including 
sales growth, acceptable profits, quality products and services, and high productiv￾ity. OD helps organizations achieve these ends by leveraging social science practices 
to lower costs, improve products and services, and increase productivity. Finally, an 
effective organization has satisfied and loyal customers or other external stakeholders 
and an engaged, satisfied, and learning workforce. The organization’s performance 
responds to the needs of external groups, such as stockholders, customers, suppli￾ers, and government agencies, which provide the organization with resources and 
legitimacy. Moreover, it is able to attract and motivate effective employees, who then 
perform at higher levels. Other forms of organizational change clearly differ from OD 
in their focus. Management consulting, for example, primarily addresses financial 
performance, whereas operations management or industrial engineering focuses on 
productivity.
Organization development can be distinguished from change management and 
organizational change. OD and change management both address the effective imple￾mentation of planned change. They are both concerned with the sequence of activities, 
processes, and leadership issues that produce organization improvements. They differ, 
however, in their underlying value orientation. OD’s behavioral science foundation 
supports values of human potential, participation, and development in addition to 4 CHAPTER 1 General Introduction to Organization Development
performance and competitive advantage. Change management focuses more narrowly 
on values of cost, quality, and schedule.7
 As a result, OD’s distinguishing feature is its 
concern with the transfer of knowledge and skill so that the system is more able to 
manage change in the future. Change management does not necessarily require the 
transfer of these skills. In short, all OD involves change management, but change man￾agement may not involve OD.
Similarly, organizational change is a broader concept than OD. As discussed above, 
organization development can be applied to managing organizational change. However, 
it is primarily concerned with managing change in such a way that knowledge and skills 
are transferred to build the organization’s capability to achieve goals and solve problems. 
It is intended to change the organization in a particular direction, toward improved 
problem solving, responsiveness, quality of work life, and effectiveness. Organizational 
change, in contrast, is more broadly focused and can apply to any kind of change, includ￾ing technical and managerial innovations, organization decline, or the evolution of a 
system over time. These changes may or may not be directed at making the organization 
more developed in the sense implied by OD.
The behavioral sciences have developed useful concepts and methods for helping 
organizations to deal with changing environments, competitor initiatives, technologi￾cal innovation, globalization, or restructuring. They help managers and administrators 
to manage the change process. Many of these concepts and techniques are described 
in this book, particularly in relation to managing change.
THE GROWTH AND RELEVANCE OF ORGANIZATION 
DEVELOPMENT
In each of the previous editions of this book, we argued that organizations must 
adapt to increasingly complex and uncertain technological, economic, political, and 
cultural changes. We also argued that OD could help an organization to create effec￾tive responses to these changes and, in many cases, to proactively influence the 
strategic direction of the firm. The rapidly changing conditions of the past few years 
confirm our arguments and accentuate their relevance. According to several observ￾ers, organizations are in the midst of unprecedented uncertainty and chaos, and 
nothing short of a management revolution will save them.8
 Three major trends are 
shaping change in organizations: globalization, information technology, and manage￾rial innovation.9
First, globalization is changing the markets and environments in which organizations 
operate as well as the way they function. New governments, new leadership, new mar￾kets, and new countries are emerging and creating a new global economy with both 
opportunities and threats.10 The toppling of the Berlin Wall symbolized and energized 
the reunification of Germany; the European Union created a cohesive economic block 
that alters the face of global markets; entrepreneurs appeared in Russia, the Balkans, 
and Siberia to transform the former Soviet Union; terrorism has reached into every 
corner of economic and social life; and China is emerging as an open market and global 
economic influence. The rapid spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) 
and its economic impact clearly demonstrated the interconnectedness among the social 
environment, organizations, and the global economy.
Second, information technology is redefining the traditional business model by 
changing how work is performed, how knowledge is used, and how the cost of doing 
business is calculated. The way an organization collects, stores, manipulates, uses, 
and transmits information can lower costs or increase the value and quality of prod￾ucts and services. Information technology, for example, is at the heart of emerging 
e-commerce strategies and organizations. Amazon.com, Yahoo!, and eBay are among CHAPTER 1 General Introduction to Organization Development 5
the survivors of a busted dot-com bubble, Google has emerged as a major competitor 
to Microsoft, and the amount of business being conducted on the Internet is pro￾jected to grow at double-digit rates. Moreover, the underlying rate of innovation is 
not expected to decline. Electronic data interchange—a state-of-the-art technology 
application a few years ago—is now considered routine business practice. The ability 
to move information easily and inexpensively throughout and among organizations 
has fueled the downsizing, delayering, and restructuring of firms. The Internet has 
enabled a new form of work known as telecommuting; organization members from 
Captial One and Cigna can work from their homes without ever going to the office. 
Finally, information technology is changing how knowledge is used. Information that 
is widely shared reduces the concentration of power at the top of the organization. 
In choosing “You” as the 2006 Person of the Year, Time magazine noted that the year 
was “a story about community and collaboration on a scale never seen before. It’s 
about . . . Wikipedia . . . YouTube and . . . MySpace. It’s about the many wresting power 
from the few and helping one another for nothing and how that will not only change 
the world, but also change the way the world changes (emphasis added).”11 Organization 
members now share the same key information that senior managers once used to 
control decision making.
Third, managerial innovation has responded to the globalization and information technol￾ogy trends and has accelerated their impact on organizations. New organizational forms, 
such as networks, strategic alliances, and virtual corporations, provide organizations with 
new ways of thinking about how to manufacture goods and deliver services. The strategic 
alliance, for example, has emerged as one of the indispensable tools in strategy imple￾mentation. No single organization, not even IBM, Mitsubishi, or General Electric, can 
control the environmental and market uncertainty it faces. Sun Microsystems’ network is 
so complex that some products it sells are never touched by a Sun employee. In addition, 
change innovations, such as downsizing or reengineering, have radically reduced the size 
of organizations and increased their flexibility; new large-group interventions, such as the 
search conference and open space, have increased the speed with which organizational 
change can take place; and organization learning interventions have acknowledged and 
leveraged knowledge as a critical organizational resource.12 Managers, OD practitioners, 
and researchers argue that these forces not only are powerful in their own right but are 
interrelated. Their interaction makes for a highly uncertain and chaotic environment for 
all kinds of organizations, including manufacturing and service firms and those in the 
public and private sectors. There is no question that these forces are profoundly affecting 
organizations.
Fortunately, a growing number of organizations are undertaking the kinds of 
organizational changes needed to survive and prosper in today’s environment. They 
are making themselves more streamlined and nimble, more responsive to external 
demands, and more ecologically sustainable. They are involving employees in key 
decisions and paying for performance rather than for time. They are taking the initia￾tive in innovating and managing change, rather than simply responding to what has 
already happened.
Organization development plays a key role in helping organizations change them￾selves. It helps organizations assess themselves and their environments and revitalize 
and rebuild their strategies, structures, and processes. OD helps organization mem￾bers go beyond surface changes to transform the underlying assumptions and values 
governing their behaviors. The different concepts and methods discussed in this book 
increasingly are finding their way into government agencies, manufacturing firms, mul￾tinational corporations, service industries, educational institutions, and not-for-profit 
organizations. Perhaps at no other time has OD been more responsive and practically 
relevant to organizations’ needs to operate effectively in a highly complex and chang￾ing world.6 CHAPTER 1 General Introduction to Organization Development
OD is obviously important to those who plan a professional career in the field, either 
as an internal consultant employed by an organization or as an external consultant 
practicing in many organizations. A career in OD can be highly rewarding, providing 
challenging and interesting assignments working with managers and employees to 
improve their organizations and their work lives. In today’s environment, the demand 
for OD professionals is rising rapidly. For example, large professional services firms 
must have effective “change management” practices to be competitive. Career oppor￾tunities in OD should continue to expand in the United States and abroad.
Organization development also is important to those who have no aspirations to 
become professional practitioners. All managers and administrators are responsible for 
supervising and developing subordinates and for improving their departments’ perfor￾mance. Similarly, all staff specialists, such as financial analysts, engineers, information 
technologists, or market researchers, are responsible for offering advice and counsel to 
managers and for introducing new methods and practices. Finally, OD is important to 
general managers and other senior executives because OD can help the whole organi￾zation be more flexible, adaptable, and effective.
Organization development can also help managers and staff personnel perform their 
tasks more effectively. It can provide the skills and knowledge necessary for establish￾ing effective interpersonal relationships. It can show personnel how to work effectively 
with others in diagnosing complex problems and in devising appropriate solutions. It 
can help others become committed to the solutions, thereby increasing chances for 
their successful implementation. In short, OD is highly relevant to anyone having to 
work with and through others in organizations.
A SHORT HISTORY OF ORGANIZATION 
DEVELOPMENT
A brief history of OD will help to clarify the evolution of the term as well as some of the 
problems and confusion that have surrounded it. As currently practiced, OD emerged 
from five major backgrounds or stems, as shown in Figure 1.1. The first was the growth 
of the National Training Laboratories (NTL) and the development of training groups, 
otherwise known as sensitivity training or T-groups. The second stem of OD was the 
classic work on action research conducted by social scientists interested in applying 
research to managing change. An important feature of action research was a technique 
known as survey feedback. Kurt Lewin, a prolific theorist, researcher, and practitioner 
in group dynamics and social change, was instrumental in the development of T-groups, 
survey feedback, and action research. His work led to the creation of OD and still serves 
as a major source of its concepts and methods. The third stem reflects a normative view 
of OD. Rensis Likert’s participative management framework and Blake and Mouton’s 
Grid® OD suggest a “one best way” to design and operate organizations. The fourth 
background is the approach focusing on productivity and the quality of work life. The 
fifth stem of OD, and the most recent influence on current practice, involves strategic 
change and organization transformation.
Laboratory Training Background
This stem of OD pioneered laboratory training, or the T-group—a small, unstruc￾tured group in which participants learn from their own interactions and evolving 
group processes about such issues as interpersonal relations, personal growth, lead￾ership, and group dynamics. Essentially, laboratory training began in the summer 
of 1946, when Kurt Lewin and his staff at the Research Center for Group Dynamics 
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) were asked by the Connecticut 
Interracial Commission and the Committee on Community Interrelations of the CHAPTER 1 General Introduction to Organization Development 7

American Jewish Congress for help in research on training community leaders. A 
workshop was developed, and the community leaders were brought together to 
learn about leadership and to discuss problems. At the end of each day, the research￾ers discussed privately what behaviors and group dynamics they had observed. The 
community leaders asked permission to sit in on these feedback sessions. Reluctant 
at first, the researchers finally agreed. Thus, the first T-group was formed in which 
people reacted to data about their own behavior.13 The researchers drew two conclu￾sions about this first T-group experiment: (1) Feedback about group interaction was 
a rich learning experience, and (2) the process of “group building” had potential for 
learning that could be transferred to “back-home” situations.14
As a result of this experience, the Office of Naval Research and the National Education 
Association provided financial backing to form the National Training Laboratories, and 
Gould Academy in Bethel, Maine, was selected as a site for further work (since then, 
Bethel has played an important part in NTL). The first Basic Skill Groups were offered 
in the summer of 1947. The program was so successful that the Carnegie Foundation 
provided support for programs in 1948 and 1949. This led to a permanent program for 
NTL within the National Education Association.
In the 1950s, three trends emerged: (1) the emergence of regional laboratories, 
(2) the expansion of summer program sessions to year-round sessions, and (3) the 
expansion of the T-group into business and industry, with NTL members becom￾ing increasingly involved with industry programs. Notable among these industry 
efforts was the pioneering work of Douglas McGregor at Union Carbide, of Herbert 
Shepard and Robert Blake at Esso Standard Oil (now ExxonMobil), of McGregor and 
Richard Beckhard at General Mills, and of Bob Tannenbaum at TRW Space Systems.15

Applications of T-group methods at these companies spawned the term “organization 
development” and, equally important, led corporate personnel and industrial relations 
specialists to expand their roles to offer internal consulting services to managers.16
Over time, T-groups have declined as an OD intervention. They are closely associ￾ated with that side of OD’s reputation as a “touchy-feely” process. NTL, as well as 
UCLA and Stanford, continues to offer T-groups to the public, a number of proprietary 
programs continue to thrive, and Pepperdine University and American University con￾tinue to utilize T-groups as part of master’s level OD practitioner education. The practi￾cal aspects of T-group techniques for organizations gradually became known as team 
building—a process for helping work groups become more effective in accomplishing 
tasks and satisfying member needs. Team building is one of the most common and 
institutionalized forms of OD today.
Action Research and Survey Feedback Background
Kurt Lewin also was involved in the second movement that led to OD’s emergence as a 
practical field of social science. This second background refers to the processes of action 
research and survey feedback. The action research contribution began in the 1940s with 
studies conducted by social scientists John Collier, Kurt Lewin, and William Whyte. 
They discovered that research needed to be closely linked to action if organization 
members were to use it to manage change. A collaborative effort was initiated between 
organization members and social scientists to collect research data about an organiza￾tion’s functioning, to analyze it for causes of problems, and to devise and implement 
solutions. After implementation, further data were collected to assess the results, and 
the cycle of data collection and action often continued. The results of action research 
were twofold: Members of organizations were able to use research on themselves to 
guide action and change, and social scientists were able to study that process to derive 
new knowledge that could be used elsewhere.
Among the pioneering action research studies were the work of Lewin and his 
students at the Harwood Manufacturing Company17 and the classic research by Lester 
Coch and John French on overcoming resistance to change.18 The latter study led to the 
development of participative management as a means of getting employees involved in 
planning and managing change. Other notable action research contributions included 
Whyte and Edith Hamilton’s famous study of Chicago’s Tremont Hotel19 and Collier’s 
efforts to apply action research techniques to improving race relations when he was 
commissioner of Indian affairs from 1933 to 1945.20 These studies did much to establish 
action research as integral to organization change. Today, it is the backbone of many 
OD applications.
A key component of most action research studies was the systematic collection of 
survey data that were fed back to the client organization. Following Lewin’s death in 
1947, his Research Center for Group Dynamics at MIT moved to Michigan and joined 
with the Survey Research Center as part of the Institute for Social Research. The 
institute was headed by Rensis Likert, a pioneer in developing scientific approaches to 
attitude surveys. His doctoral dissertation at Columbia University developed the widely 
used 5-point “Likert Scale.”21
In an early study by the institute, Likert and Floyd Mann administered a 
companywide survey of management and employee attitudes at Detroit Edison.22
The feedback process that evolved was an “interlocking chain of conferences.” The 
major findings of the survey were first reported to the top management and then 
transmitted throughout the organization. The feedback sessions were conducted in 
task groups, with supervisors and their immediate subordinates discussing the data 
together. Although there was little substantial research evidence, the researchers 
intuitively felt that this was a powerful process for change.CHAPTER 1 General Introduction to Organization Development 9
In 1950, eight accounting departments asked for a repeat of the survey, thus gen￾erating a new cycle of feedback meetings. In four departments, feedback approaches 
were used, but the method varied; two departments received feedback only at the 
departmental level; and because of changes in key personnel, nothing was done in the 
remaining two departments.
A third follow-up study indicated that more significant and positive changes, such 
as job satisfaction, had occurred in the departments receiving feedback than in the two 
departments that did not participate. From those findings, Likert and Mann derived 
several conclusions about the effects of survey feedback on organization change. This 
led to extensive applications of survey-feedback methods in a variety of settings. The 
common pattern of data collection, data feedback, action planning, implementation, 
and follow-up data collection in both action research and survey feedback can be seen 
in these examples.
Normative Background
The intellectual and practical advances from the laboratory training stem and the action 
research/survey-feedback stem were followed closely by the belief that a human rela￾tions approach represented a “one best way” to manage organizations. This normative 
belief was exemplified in research that associated Likert’s Participative Management 
(System 4, as outlined below) style and Blake and Mouton’s Grid OD program with 
organizational effectiveness.23
Likert’s Participative Management Program characterized organizations as having one 
of four types of management systems:24
Exploitive authoritative systems (System 1) exhibit an autocratic, top-down 
approach to leadership. Employee motivation is based on punishment and occa￾sional rewards. Communication is primarily downward, and there is little lateral 
interaction or teamwork. Decision making and control reside primarily at the top of 
the organization. System 1 results in mediocre performance.
Benevolent authoritative systems (System 2) are similar to System 1, except 
that management is more paternalistic. Employees are allowed a little more inter￾action, communication, and decision making but within boundaries defined by 
management.
Consultative systems (System 3) increase employee interaction, communication, 
and decision making. Although employees are consulted about problems and deci￾sions, management still makes the final decisions. Productivity is good, and employ￾ees are moderately satisfied with the organization.
Participative group systems (System 4) are almost the opposite of System 1. 
Designed around group methods of decision making and supervision, this system fos￾ters high degrees of member involvement and participation. Work groups are highly 
involved in setting goals, making decisions, improving methods, and appraising 
results. Communication occurs both laterally and vertically, and decisions are linked 
throughout the organization by overlapping group membership. System 4 achieves 
high levels of productivity, quality, and member satisfaction.
Likert applied System 4 management to organizations using a survey-feedback process. 
The intervention generally started with organization members completing the Profile of 
Organizational Characteristics.25 The survey asked members for their opinions about both 
the present and ideal conditions of six organizational features: leadership, motivation, 
communication, decisions, goals, and control. In the second stage, the data were fed 
back to different work groups within the organization. Group members examined the 
discrepancy between their present situation and their ideal, generally using System 4 
•

•10 CHAPTER 1 General Introduction to Organization Development
as the ideal benchmark, and generated action plans to move the organization toward 
System 4 conditions.
Blake and Mouton’s Grid Organization Development originated from research about 
managerial and organizational effectiveness.26 Data gathered on organizational excel￾lence from 198 organizations located in the United States, Japan, and Great Britain 
found that the two foremost barriers to excellence were planning and communica￾tions.27 Each of these barriers was researched further to understand its roots, and the 
research resulted in a normative model of leadership—the Managerial Grid.
According to the Managerial Grid, an individual’s style can be described according 
to his or her concern for production and concern for people.28 A concern for produc￾tion covers a range of behaviors, such as accomplishing productive tasks, developing 
creative ideas, making quality policy decisions, establishing thorough and high-quality 
staff services, or creating efficient workload measurements. Concern for production is 
not limited to things but also may involve human accomplishment within the organi￾zation, regardless of the assigned tasks or activities. A concern for people encompasses 
a variety of issues, including concern for the individual’s personal worth, good working 
conditions, a degree of involvement or commitment to completing the job, security, a 
fair salary structure and fringe benefits, and good social and other relationships. Each 
dimension is measured on a 9-point scale and results in 81 possible leadership styles.
For example, 1,9 managers have a low concern for production and a high concern 
for people: They view people’s feelings, attitudes, and needs as valuable in their own 
right. This type of manager strives to provide subordinates with work conditions that 
provide ease, security, and comfort. On the other hand, 9,1 managers have a high 
concern for production but a low concern for people: They minimize the attitudes and 
feelings of subordinates and give little attention to individual creativity, conflict, and 
commitment. As a result, the focus is on the work organization.
Blake and Mouton proposed that the 9,9 managerial style is the most effective in 
overcoming the communications barrier to corporate excellence. The basic assumptions 
behind this managerial style differ qualitatively and quantitatively from those underly￾ing the other managerial styles, which assume there is an inherent conflict between the 
needs of the organization and the needs of people. By showing a high concern for both 
people and production, managers allow employees to think and to influence the organi￾zation, thus promoting active support for organizational plans. Employee participation 
means that better communication is critical; therefore, necessary information is shared 
by all relevant parties. Moreover, better communication means self-direction and self￾control, rather than unquestioning, blind obedience. Organizational commitment arises 
out of discussion, deliberation, and debate over major organizational issues.
One of the most structured interventions in OD, Blake and Mouton’s Grid 
Organization Development has two key objectives: to improve planning by develop￾ing a strategy for organizational excellence based on clear logic, and to help managers 
gain the necessary knowledge and skills to supervise effectively. It consists of six phases 
designed to analyze an entire business and to overcome the planning and communi￾cations barriers to corporate excellence. The first phase is the Grid Seminar, a 1-week 
program where participants analyze their personal style and learn methods of problem 
solving. Phase two consists of team development and phase three involves intergroup 
development. In phase four, an ideal model of organizational excellence is developed 
and in phase five, the model is implemented. The final phase consists of an evaluation 
of the organization.
Despite some research support, the normative approach to change has given way 
to a contingency view that acknowledges the influence of the external environment, 
technology, and other forces in determining the appropriate organization design 
and management practices. Still, Likert’s participative management and Blake and 
Mouton’s Grid OD frameworks are both used in organizations today.CHAPTER 1 General Introduction to Organization Development 11
Productivity and Quality-of-Work-Life Background
The contribution of the productivity and quality-of-work-life (QWL) background to OD 
can be described in two phases. The first phase is described by the original projects devel￾oped in Europe in the 1950s and their emergence in the United States during the 1960s. 
Based on the research of Eric Trist and his colleagues at the Tavistock Institute of Human 
Relations in London, early practitioners in Great Britain, Ireland, Norway, and Sweden 
developed work designs aimed at better integrating technology and people.29 These 
QWL programs generally involved joint participation by unions and management in the 
design of work and resulted in work designs giving employees high levels of discretion, 
task variety, and feedback about results. Perhaps the most distinguishing characteristic of 
these QWL programs was the discovery of self-managing work groups as a form of work 
design. These groups were composed of multiskilled workers who were given the neces￾sary autonomy and information to design and manage their own task performances.
As these programs migrated to America, a variety of concepts and techniques were 
adopted and the approach tended to be more mixed than in European practice. For 
example, two definitions of QWL emerged during its initial development.30 QWL was 
first defined in terms of people’s reaction to work, particularly individual outcomes 
related to job satisfaction and mental health. Using this definition, QWL focused pri￾marily on the personal consequences of the work experience and how to improve 
work to satisfy personal needs.
A second definition of QWL defined it as an approach or method.31 People defined 
QWL in terms of specific techniques and approaches used for improving work.32 It was 
viewed as synonymous with methods such as job enrichment, self-managed teams, 
and labor–management committees. This technique orientation derived mainly from 
the growing publicity surrounding QWL projects, such as the General Motors–United 
Auto Workers project at Tarrytown and the Gaines Pet Food plant project. These pio￾neering projects drew attention to specific approaches for improving work.
The excitement and popularity of this first phase of QWL in the United States lasted 
until the mid-1970s, when other more pressing issues, such as inflation and energy 
costs, diverted national attention. However, starting in 1979, a second phase of QWL 
activity emerged. A major factor contributing to the resurgence of QWL was growing 
international competition faced by the United States in markets at home and abroad. It 
became increasingly clear that the relatively low cost and high quality of foreign-made 
goods resulted partially from the management practices used abroad, especially in 
Japan. Books extolling the virtues of Japanese management, such as Ouchi’s Theory Z,
33
made best-seller lists.
As a result, QWL programs expanded beyond their initial focus on work design to 
include other features of the workplace that can affect employee productivity and satis￾faction, such as reward systems, work flows, management styles, and the physical work 
environment. This expanded focus resulted in larger-scale and longer-term projects than 
had the early job enrichment programs and shifted attention beyond the individual 
worker to work groups and the larger work context. Equally important, it added the 
critical dimension of organizational efficiency to what had been up to that time a primary 
concern for the human dimension.
At one point, the productivity and QWL approach became so popular that it was 
called an ideological movement. This was particularly evident in the spread of qual￾ity circles within many companies. Popularized in Japan, quality circles are groups of 
employees trained in problem-solving methods that meet regularly to resolve work￾environment, productivity, and quality-control concerns and to develop more efficient 
ways of working. At the same time, many of the QWL programs started in the early 
1970s were achieving success. Highly visible corporations, such as General Motors, Ford, 
and Honeywell, and unions, such as the United Automobile Workers, the Oil, Chemical, 
and Atomic Workers, the Communications Workers of America, and the Steelworkers, 12 CHAPTER 1 General Introduction to Organization Development
were more willing to publicize their QWL efforts. In 1980, for example, more than 
1,800 people attended an international QWL conference in Toronto, Canada. Unlike 
previous conferences, which were dominated by academics, the presenters at Toronto 
were mainly managers, workers, and unionists from private and public corporations.
Today, this second phase of QWL activity continues primarily under the banner of 
“employee involvement” (EI) as well as total quality management and six-sigma pro￾grams, rather than of QWL. For many OD practitioners, the term EI signifies, more than 
the name QWL, the growing emphasis on how employees can contribute more to run￾ning the organization so it can be more flexible, productive, and competitive. Recently, 
the term “employee empowerment” has been used interchangeably with the term 
EI, the former suggesting the power inherent in moving decision making downward 
in the organization.34 Employee empowerment may be too restrictive, however. Because 
it draws attention to the power aspects of these interventions, it may lead practitioners 
to neglect other important elements needed for success, such as information, skills, 
and rewards. Consequently, EI seems broader and less restrictive than does employee 
empowerment as a banner for these approaches to organizational improvement.
Strategic Change Background
The strategic change background is a recent influence on OD’s evolution. As organ￾izations and their technological, political, and social environments have become more 
complex and more uncertain, the scale and intricacies of organizational change have 
increased. This trend has produced the need for a strategic perspective from OD and 
encouraged planned change processes at the organization level.35
Strategic change involves improving the alignment among an organization’s envi￾ronment, strategy, and organization design.36 Strategic change interventions include 
efforts to improve both the organization’s relationship to its environment and the fit 
between its technical, political, and cultural systems.37 The need for strategic change 
is usually triggered by some major disruption to the organization, such as the lifting 
of regulatory requirements, a technological breakthrough, or a new chief executive 
officer coming in from outside the organization.38
One of the first applications of strategic change was Richard Beckhard’s use of open 
systems planning.39 He proposed that an organization’s environment and its strategy 
could be described and analyzed. Based on the organization’s core mission, the differ￾ences between what the environment demanded and how the organization responded 
could be reduced and performance improved. Since then, change agents have proposed 
a variety of large-scale or strategic-change models;40 each of these models recognizes that 
strategic change involves multiple levels of the organization and a change in its culture, 
is often driven from the top by powerful executives, and has important effects on per￾formance. More recently, strategic approaches to OD have been extended into mergers 
and acquisitions, alliance formation, and network development.41
The strategic change background has significantly influenced OD practice. For exam￾ple, implementing strategic change requires OD practitioners to be familiar with com￾petitive strategy, finance, and marketing, as well as team building, action research, and 
survey feedback. Together, these skills have improved OD’s relevance to organizations 
and their managers.
EVOLUTION IN ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
Current practice in organization development is strongly influenced by these five 
backgrounds as well as by the trends shaping change in organizations. The laboratory 
training, action research and survey feedback, normative, and QWL roots of OD are 
evident in the strong value focus that underlies its practice. The more recent influence CHAPTER 1 General Introduction to Organization Development 13
of the strategic change background has greatly improved the relevance and rigor of OD 
practice. They have added financial and economic indicators of effectiveness to OD’s 
traditional measures of work satisfaction and personal growth. All of the backgrounds 
support the transfer of knowledge and skill to the client system and the building of 
capacity to better manage change in the future.
Today, the field is being influenced by the globalization and information technology 
trends described earlier. OD is being carried out in many more countries and in many 
more organizations operating on a worldwide basis. This is generating a whole new 
set of interventions as well as adaptations to traditional OD practice.42 In addition, OD 
must adapt its methods to the technologies being used in organizations. As information 
technology continues to influence organization environments, strategies, and struc￾tures, OD will need to manage change processes in cyberspace as well as face-to-face. 
The diversity of this evolving discipline has led to tremendous growth in the number 
of professional OD practitioners, in the kinds of organizations involved with OD, and 
in the range of countries within which OD is practiced.
The expansion of the OD Network (http://www.odnetwork.org), which began in 
1964, is one indication of this growth. It has grown from 200 members in 1970 to 2,800 
in 1992 to 4,031 in 1999 and has remained stable with about 4,000 in 2007. At the same 
time, Division 14 of the American Psychological Association, formerly known as the 
Division of Industrial Psychology, has changed its title to the Society for Industrial and 
Organizational Psychology (http://www.siop.org). In 1968, the American Society for 
Training & Development (http://www.astd.org) set up an OD division, which currently 
operates as the OD/Leadership Community with more than 2,000 members. In 1971, 
the Academy of Management established a Division of Organization Development and 
Change (http://www.aom.pace.edu/odc), which currently has more than 2,600 mem￾bers. Pepperdine University (http://bschool. pepperdine.edu/programs/msod), Bowling 
Green State University (http://www.bgsu.edu), and Case Western Reserve University 
(http://www.cwru.edu) offered the first master’s degree programs in OD in 1975, and 
Case Western Reserve University began the first doctoral program in OD. Organization 
development now is being taught at the graduate and undergraduate levels in a large 
number of universities.43
In addition to the growth of professional societies and educational programs in OD, the 
field continues to develop new theorists, researchers, and practitioners who are building 
on the work of the early pioneers and extending it to contemporary issues and conditions. 
The first generation of contributors included Chris Argyris, who developed a learning and 
action-science approach to OD;44 Warren Bennis, who tied executive leadership to stra￾tegic change;45 Edie Seashore, who keeps interpersonal relationships and diversity in the 
forefront of practice;46 Edgar Schein, who developed process approaches to OD, including 
the key role of organizational culture in change management;47 Richard Beckhard, who 
focused attention on the importance of managing transitions;48 and Robert Tannenbaum, 
who sensitized OD to the personal dimension of participants’ lives.49
Among the second generation of contributors are Warner Burke, whose work has 
done much to make OD a professional field;50 Larry Greiner, who has brought the 
ideas of power and evolution into the mainstream of OD;51 Edward Lawler III, who 
has extended OD to reward systems and employee involvement;52 Anthony Raia and 
Newton Margulies, who together have kept our attention on the values underlying 
OD and what those mean for contemporary practice;53 and Peter Vaill, Craig Lundberg, 
Billie Alban, Barbara Bunker, and David Jamieson, who continue to develop OD as a 
practical science.54
Included among the newest generation of OD contributors are Dave Brown, whose 
work on action research and developmental organizations has extended OD into 
community and societal change;55 Thomas Cummings, whose work on sociotechni￾cal systems, self-designing organizations, and transorganizational development has 14 CHAPTER 1 General Introduction to Organization Development
led OD beyond the boundaries of single organizations to groups of organizations and 
their environments;56 Max Elden, whose international work in industrial democracy 
draws attention to the political aspects of OD;57 Richard Woodman, William Pasmore, 
Rami Shani, and Jerry Porras, who have done much to put OD on a sound research 
and conceptual base;58 and Peter Block, who has focused attention on consulting skills, 
empowerment processes, and reclaiming our individuality.59 Others making important 
contributions to the field include Ken Murrell, who has focused attention on the inter￾nationalization of OD;60 Sue Mohrman, who has forged a link between organization 
design and OD;61 Chris Worley, who has pushed the integration of OD with strategy 
and organization design;62 David Cooperrider and Jim Ludema, who have turned our 
attention toward the positive aspects of organizations;63 and Bob Marshak, who alerts 
us to the importance of symbolic and covert processes during change.64 These academic 
contributors are joined by a large number of internal OD practitioners and external 
consultants who lead organizational change.
Many different organizations have undertaken a wide variety of OD efforts. In 
many cases, organizations have been at the forefront of innovating new change tech￾niques and methods as well as new organizational forms. Larger corporations that 
have engaged in organization development include General Electric, Boeing, Texas 
Instruments, American Airlines, DuPont, Intel, Hewlett-Packard, Microsoft, General 
Foods, Procter & Gamble, IBM, Raytheon, Wells Fargo Bank, the Hartford Financial 
Services, and Limited Brands. Traditionally, much of the work was considered confi￾dential and was not publicized. Today, however, organizations increasingly are going 
public with their OD efforts, sharing the lessons with others.
OD work also is being done in schools, communities, and local, state, and federal gov￾ernments. Several reviews of OD projects were directed primarily at OD in public admin￾istration.65 Extensive OD work was done in the armed services, including the army, 
navy, air force, and coast guard, although OD activity and research activities have ebbed 
and flowed with changes in the size and scope of the military. Public schools began using 
both group training and survey feedback relatively early in the history of OD.66 Usually, 
the projects took place in suburban middle-class schools, where stresses and strains of 
an urban environment were not prominent and ethnic and socioeconomic differences 
between consultants and clients were not high. In more recent years, OD methods have 
been extended to urban schools and to colleges and universities.
Organization development is increasingly international. It has been applied in 
nearly every country in the world. These efforts have involved such organizations as 
Saab (Sweden), Imperial Chemical Industries (England), Shell Oil Company, Orrefors 
(Sweden), Akzo-Nobel (The Netherlands), the Beijing Arbitration Commission and 
Neusoft Corporation (China), Air New Zealand, and Vitro (Mexico).
Although it is evident that OD has expanded vastly in recent years, relatively few of 
the total number of organizations in the United States are actively involved in formal 
OD programs. However, many organizations are applying OD approaches and tech￾niques without knowing that such a term exists.
OVERVIEW OF THE BOOK
This book presents the process and practice of organization development in a logical flow, 
as shown in Figure 1.2. Part 1 provides an overview of OD that describes the process of 
planned change and those who perform the work. It consists of two chapters. Chapter 2 
discusses the nature of planned change and presents some models describing the change 
process. Planned change is viewed as an ongoing cycle of four activities: entering and 
contracting, diagnosing, planning and implementing, and evaluating and institutional￾izing. Chapter 3 describes the OD practitioner and provides insight into the knowledge 
and skills needed to practice OD and the kinds of career issues that can be expected.Overview of the Book

CHAPTER 1 General Introduction to Organization Development 15
Part 2 is composed of eight chapters that describe the process of organization devel￾opment. Chapter 4 characterizes the first activity in this process: entering an organiza￾tional system and contracting with it for organization development work. Chapters 5, 
6, 7, and 8 present the steps associated with the next major activity of the OD process: 
diagnosing. This involves helping the organization understand its current functioning 16 CHAPTER 1 General Introduction to Organization Development
and discover areas for improvement. Chapters 5 and 6 present an open-systems 
model to guide diagnosis at three levels of analysis: the total organization, the group 
or department, and the individual job or position. Chapters 7 and 8 review methods 
for collecting, analyzing, and feeding back diagnostic data. Chapters 9 and 10 address 
issues concerned with the third activity: designing OD interventions and implement￾ing change. Chapter 9 presents an overview of the intervention design process. Major 
kinds of interventions are identified, and the specific approaches that make up the next 
four parts of the book are introduced. Chapter 10 discusses the process of leading and 
managing change. It identifies key factors contributing to the successful implementa￾tion of change programs. Chapter 11 describes the final activity of the planned change 
process: evaluating OD interventions and establishing them as a permanent part of 
organizational functioning.
Parts 3 through 6 present the major interventions used in OD today. Part 3 (Chapters 
12 and 13) is concerned with human process interventions aimed at the social pro￾cesses occurring within organizations. These are the oldest and most traditional inter￾ventions in OD. Chapter 12 describes interpersonal and group process approaches, 
such as process consultation, third-party interventions, and team building. Chapter 13 
presents more systemwide process approaches, such as organizational confrontation 
meetings, intergroup relations, and large-group interventions.
Part 4 (Chapters 14, 15, and 16) reviews technostructural interventions that are 
aimed at organization structure and at better integrating people and technology. 
Chapter 14 is about restructuring organizations; it describes the alternative methods 
of organizing work activities as well as processes for downsizing and reengineering 
the organization. Chapter 15 presents interventions for improving employee involve￾ment. These change programs increase employee knowledge, power, information, 
and rewards through parallel structures, total quality management, and high-involve￾ment organizations. Chapter 16 describes change programs directed at work design, 
both of individual jobs and of work groups, for greater employee satisfaction and 
productivity.
Part 5 (Chapters 17, 18, and 19) presents human resource management interven￾tions that are directed at integrating people into the organization. These interventions 
are associated traditionally with the human resource function in the organization and 
increasingly have become a part of OD activities. Chapter 17 concerns the process of 
performance management. This is a cycle of activities that helps groups and individu￾als to set goals, appraise work, and reward performance. Chapter 18 discusses inter￾ventions that build human talent and capital in the organization, including coaching, 
career planning and development, and management and leadership development. 
Chapter 19 presents two interventions that address and leverage workforce diversity 
and improve employee wellness.
Part 6 (Chapters 20, 21, and 22) concerns strategic interventions that focus on 
organizing the firm’s resources to gain a competitive advantage in the environment. 
These change programs generally are managed from the top of the organization and 
take considerable time, effort, and resources. Chapter 20 presents three interventions 
having to do with organization transformation, including integrated strategic change, 
organization design, and culture change. Chapter 21 describes continuous change inter￾ventions, including self-design, learning and knowledge management, and creating 
built to change organizations. Finally, Chapter 22 describes three transorganizational 
interventions: merger and acquisition integration processes, alliance formation and 
management, and network development and change.
Part 7 (Chapters 23, 24, and 25) is concerned with special topics in OD. Chapter 23 
describes the practice of OD in international settings. OD in organizations operating 
outside of the United States requires modification of the interventions to fit the coun￾try’s cultural context. Organization development in worldwide organizations is aimed CHAPTER 1 General Introduction to Organization Development 17
at improving the internal alignment of strategy, structure, and process to achieve 
global objectives. Furthermore, the practice of OD in global social change organizations 
promotes sustainable development and improves human potential in emerging coun￾tries. Chapter 24 presents broad applications of OD in different kinds of organizations, 
including educational, government, family-owned, and health care agencies. Finally, 
Chapter 25 examines the future of organization development, including the trends 
affecting the field and the prospects for its influence on organization effectiveness.
SUMMARY
This chapter introduced OD as a planned change discipline concerned with apply￾ing behavioral science knowledge and practices to help organizations achieve greater 
effectiveness. Managers and staff specialists must work with and through people to 
achieve organizational objectives, and OD can help them form effective relationships 
with others. Organizations are faced with rapidly accelerating change, and OD can 
help them cope with the consequences of change. The concept of OD has multiple 
meanings. The definition provided here resolved some of the problems with earlier 
definitions. The history of OD reveals its five roots: laboratory training, action research 
and survey feedback, normative approaches, productivity and quality of work life, and 
strategic change. The current practice of OD goes far beyond its humanistic origins by 
incorporating concepts from organization strategy and design that complement the 
early emphasis on social processes. The continued growth in the number and diversity 
of OD approaches, practitioners, and involved organizations attests to the health of the 
discipline and offers a favorable prospect for the future.

Chapter 2 The Nature of Planned Change
Chapter 3 The Organization Development Practitioner
Overview of Organization
Development
part 1The Nature of Planned Change
The pace of global, economic, and technological 
development makes change an inevitable fea￾ture of organizational life. However, change that 
happens to an organization can be distinguished 
from change that is planned by its members. In 
this book, the term change will refer to planned 
change. Organization development is directed 
at bringing about planned change to increase 
an organization’s effectiveness and capability to 
change itself. It is generally initiated and imple￾mented by managers, often with the help of an 
OD practitioner from either inside or outside of 
the organization. Organizations can use planned 
change to solve problems, to learn from experi￾ence, to reframe shared perceptions, to adapt 
to external environmental changes, to improve 
performance, and to influence future changes.
All approaches to OD rely on some theory 
about planned change. The theories describe 
the different stages through which planned 
change may be effected in organizations and 
explain the temporal process of applying OD 
methods to help organization members man￾age change. In this chapter, we first describe 
and compare three major theories of organiza￾tion change that have received considerable 
attention in the field: Lewin’s change model, the 
action research model, and the positive model. 
Next, we present a general model of planned 
change that integrates the earlier models and 
incorporates recent conceptual advances in 
OD. The general model has broad applicability 
to many types of planned change efforts and 
serves to organize the chapters in this book. We 
then discuss different types of change and how 
the process can vary depending on the change 
situation. Finally, we present several critiques of 
planned change.
THEORIES OF PLANNED CHANGE
Conceptions of planned change have tended to focus on how change can be imple￾mented in organizations.1
 Called “theories of changing,” these frameworks describe 
the activities that must take place to initiate and carry out successful organizational 
change. In this section, we describe and compare three theories of changing: Lewin’s 
change model, the action research model, and the positive model. These frameworks 
have received widespread attention in OD and serve as the primary basis for a general 
model of planned change.
Lewin’s Change Model
One of the earliest models of planned change was provided by Kurt Lewin.2
 He conceived 
of change as modification of those forces keeping a system’s behavior stable. Specifically, 
a particular set of behaviors at any moment in time is the result of two groups of forces: 
those striving to maintain the status quo and those pushing for change. When both sets of 
forces are about equal, current behaviors are maintained in what Lewin termed a state of 
“quasi-stationary equilibrium.” To change that state, one can increase those forces pushing 
224 PART 1 Overview of Organization Development
for change, decrease those forces maintaining the current state, or apply some combination 
of both. For example, the level of performance of a work group might be stable because 
group norms maintaining that level are equivalent to the supervisor’s pressures for change 
to higher levels. This level can be increased either by changing the group norms to support 
higher levels of performance or by increasing supervisor pressures to produce at higher 
levels. Lewin suggested that decreasing those forces maintaining the status quo produces 
less tension and resistance than increasing forces for change and consequently is a more 
effective change strategy.
Lewin viewed this change process as consisting of the following three steps, which 
are shown in Figure 2.1(A):
Unfreezing. This step usually involves reducing those forces maintaining the 
organization’s behavior at its present level. Unfreezing is sometimes accomplished
through a process of “psychological disconfirmation.” By introducing information
that shows discrepancies between behaviors desired by organization members 
and those behaviors currently exhibited, members can be motivated to engage in 
change activities.3
Moving. This step shifts the behavior of the organization, department, or individ￾ual to a new level. It involves intervening in the system to develop new behaviors, 
values, and attitudes through changes in organizational structures and processes.
Refreezing. This step stabilizes the organization at a new state of equilibrium. It 
is frequently accomplished through the use of supporting mechanisms that rein￾force the new organizational state, such as organizational culture, rewards, and 
structures.
Lewin’s model provides a general framework for understanding organizational 
change. Because the three steps of change are relatively broad, considerable effort has 
gone into elaborating them. For example, the planning model developed by Lippitt, 
Watson, and Westley arranges Lewin’s model into seven steps: scouting, entry, diagno￾sis (unfreezing), planning, action (moving), stabilization and evaluation, and termina￾tion (refreezing).4
 Similarly, Kotter’s eightwstage process can be mapped onto Lewin’s 
phases: establishing a sense of urgency, creating the guiding coalition, developing a 
vision and strategy, and communicating the change vision (unfreezing); empowering 
broad-based action, generating short-term wins (moving); and consolidating gains and 
producing more change, and anchoring new approaches in the culture (refreezing).5
Lewin’s model remains closely identified with the field of OD, however, and is used 
to illustrate how other types of change can be implemented. For example, Lewin’s 
three-step model has been used to explain how information technologies can be imple￾mented more effectively.6
Action Research Model
The classic action research model focuses on planned change as a cyclical process in 
which initial research about the organization provides information to guide subsequent 
action. Then the results of the action are assessed to provide further information to 
guide further action, and so on. This iterative cycle of research and action involves con￾siderable collaboration among organization members and OD practitioners. It places 
heavy emphasis on data gathering and diagnosis prior to action planning and imple￾mentation, as well as careful evaluation of results after action is taken.
Action research is traditionally aimed both at helping specific organizations imple￾ment planned change and at developing more general knowledge that can be applied 
to other settings.7
 Although action research was originally developed to have this 
dual focus on change and knowledge generation, it has been adapted to OD efforts 
in which the major emphasis is on planned change.8
 Figure 2.1(B) shows the cyclical

phases of planned change as defined by the original action research model. There are 
eight main steps.
Problem Identification. This stage usually begins when an executive in the orga￾nization or someone with power and influence senses that the organization has 
one or more problems that might be solved with the help of an OD practitioner.
Consultation with a Behavioral Science Expert. During the initial contact, the 
OD practitioner and the client carefully assess each other. The practitioner has his 
or her own normative, developmental theory or frame of reference and must be

conscious of those assumptions and values.9
 Sharing them with the client from the 
beginning establishes an open and collaborative atmosphere.
Data Gathering and Preliminary Diagnosis. This step is usually completed by 
the OD practitioner, often in conjunction with organization members. It involves 
gathering appropriate information and analyzing it to determine the underlying 
causes of organizational problems. The four basic methods of gathering data are 
interviews, process observation, questionnaires, and organizational performance 
data (unfortunately, often overlooked). One approach to diagnosis begins with 
observation, proceeds to a semistructured interview, and concludes with a ques￾tionnaire to measure precisely the problems identified by the earlier steps.10 When 
gathering diagnostic information, OD practitioners may influence members from 
whom they are collecting data. In OD, any action by the OD practitioner can be 
viewed as an intervention that will have some effect on the organization.11
Feedback to a Key Client or Group. Because action research is a collaborative 
activity, the diagnostic data are fed back to the client, usually in a group or work￾team meeting. The feedback step, in which members are given the information gath￾ered by the OD practitioner, helps them determine the strengths and weaknesses 
of the organization or unit under study. The consultant provides the client with all 
relevant and useful data. Obviously, the practitioner will protect confidential sources 
of information and, at times, may even withhold data. Defining what is relevant 
and useful involves consideration of privacy and ethics as well as judgment about 
whether the group is ready for the information or if the information would make 
the client overly defensive.
Joint Diagnosis of the Problem. At this point, members discuss the feedback 
and explore with the OD practitioner whether they want to work on identified 
problems. A close interrelationship exists among data gathering, feedback, and 
diagnosis because the consultant summarizes the basic data from the client mem￾bers and presents the data to them for validation and further diagnosis. An impor￾tant point to remember, as Schein suggests, is that the action research process is 
very different from the doctor–patient model, in which the consultant comes in, 
makes a diagnosis, and prescribes a solution. Schein notes that the failure to estab￾lish a common frame of reference in the client–consultant relationship may lead 
to a faulty diagnosis or to a communication gap whereby the client is sometimes 
“unwilling to believe the diagnosis or accept the prescription.” He believes that 
“most companies have drawers full of reports by consultants, each loaded with 
diagnoses and recommendations which are either not understood or not accepted 
by the ‘patient.’ ”12
Joint Action Planning. Next, the OD practitioner and the client members 
jointly agree on further actions to be taken. This is the beginning of the moving 
process (described in Lewin’s change model), as the organization decides how 
best to reach a different quasi-stationary equilibrium. At this stage, the specific 
action to be taken depends on the culture, technology, and environment of the 
organization; the diagnosis of the problem; and the time and expense of the 
intervention.
Action. This stage involves the actual change from one organizational state to 
another. It may include installing new methods and procedures, reorganizing 
structures and work designs, and reinforcing new behaviors. Such actions typically 
cannot be implemented immediately but require a transition period as the organi￾zation moves from the present to a desired future state.13
Data Gathering After Action. Because action research is a cyclical process, data 
must also be gathered after the action has been taken to measure and determine 
the effects of the action and to feed the results back to the organization. This, in 
turn, may lead to rediagnosis and new action.

8.CHAPTER 2 The Nature of Planned Change 27
The action research model underlies most current approaches to planned change and 
is often considered synonymous with OD. Recently, it has been refined and extended 
to new settings and applications, and consequently, researchers and practitioners have 
made requisite adaptations of its basic framework.14
Trends in the application of action research include movement from smaller subunits 
of organizations to total systems and communities.15 In these larger contexts, action 
research is more complex and political than in smaller settings. Therefore, the action 
research cycle is coordinated across multiple change processes and includes a diversity 
of stakeholders who have an interest in the organization. (We describe these applica￾tions more thoroughly in Chapters 20, 21, and 22.) Action research also is applied 
increasingly in international settings, particularly in developing nations in the southern 
hemisphere.16 Embedded within the action research model, however, are “northern 
hemisphere” assumptions about change. For example, action research traditionally views 
change more linearly than do Asian cultures, and it treats the change process more col￾laboratively than do Latin American and African countries. To achieve success in these 
settings, action research is tailored to fit cultural assumptions. (See “Different Types of 
Planned Change” below and Chapter 23.) Finally, action research is applied increasingly 
to promote social change and innovation, as demonstrated most clearly in community 
development and global social change projects.17 These applications are heavily value 
laden and seek to redress imbalances in power and resource allocations across different 
groups. Action researchers tend to play an activist role in the change process, which is 
often chaotic and conflictual. (Chapter 23 reviews global social change processes.)
In light of these general trends, contemporary applications of action research have sub￾stantially increased the degree of member involvement in the change process. This contrasts 
with traditional approaches to planned change, whereby consultants carried out most of 
the change activities, with the agreement and collaboration of management.18 Although 
consultant-dominated change still persists in OD, there is a growing tendency to involve 
organization members in learning about their organization and how to change it. Referred 
to as “participatory action research,” “action learning,” “action science,” or “self-design,” 
this approach to planned change emphasizes the need for organization members to learn 
firsthand about planned change if they are to gain the knowledge and skills needed to 
change the organization.19 In today’s complex and changing environment, some argue that 
OD must go beyond solving particular problems to helping members gain the competence 
needed to change and improve the organization continually.20
In this modification of action research, the role of OD consultants is to work with 
members to facilitate the learning process. Both parties are “co-learners” in diagnosing the 
organization, designing changes, and implementing and assessing them.21 Neither party 
dominates the change process. Rather, each participant brings unique information and 
expertise to the situation, and they combine their resources to learn how to change the 
organization. Consultants, for example, know how to design diagnostic instruments and 
OD interventions, and organization members have “local knowledge” about the organiza￾tion and how it functions. Each participant learns from the change process. Organization 
members learn how to change their organization and how to refine and improve it. OD 
consultants learn how to facilitate complex organizational change and learning.
The action research model will continue to be the dominant methodological basis 
for planned change in the near future. But the basic philosophy of science on which 
traditional action research operates is also evolving and is described below.
The Positive Model
The third model of change, the positive model, represents an important departure from 
Lewin’s model and the action research process. Those models are primarily deficit based; 
they focus on the organization’s problems and how they can be solved so it functions 28 PART 1 Overview of Organization Development
better. The positive model focuses on what the organization is doing right. It helps 
members understand their organization when it is working at its best and builds off those 
capabilities to achieve even better results. This positive approach to change is consistent 
with a growing movement in the social sciences called “positive organizational scholar￾ship,” which focuses on positive dynamics in organizations that give rise to extraordinary 
outcomes.22 Considerable research on expectation effects also supports this model of 
planned change.23 It shows that people tend to act in ways that make their expectations 
occur. Thus, positive expectations about the organization can create an anticipation that 
energizes and directs behavior toward making those beliefs happen.
The positive model has been applied to planned change primarily through a pro￾cess called appreciative inquiry (AI).24 As a “reformist and rebellious” form of social 
constructionism, AI explicitly infuses a positive value orientation into analyzing and 
changing organizations.25 Social constructionism assumes that organization members’ 
shared experiences and interactions influence how they perceive the organization and 
behave in it.26 Because such shared meaning can determine how members approach 
planned change, AI encourages a positive orientation to how change is conceived and 
managed. It promotes broad member involvement in creating a shared vision about 
the organization’s positive potential. That shared appreciation provides a powerful and 
guiding image of what the organization could be.
Drawing heavily on AI, the positive model of planned change involves five phases 
that are depicted in Figure 2.1(C).
Initiate the Inquiry. This first phase determines the subject of change. It empha￾sizes member involvement to identify the organizational issue they have the 
most energy to address. For example, members can choose to look for successful 
male–female collaboration (as opposed to sexual discrimination), instances of cus￾tomer satisfaction (as opposed to customer dissatisfaction), particularly effective 
work teams, or product development processes that brought new ideas to market 
especially fast. If the focus of inquiry is real and vital to organization members, the 
change process itself will take on these positive attributes.
Inquire into Best Practices. This phase involves gathering information about the 
“best of what is” in the organization. If the topic is organizational innovation, then 
members help to develop an interview protocol that collects stories of new ideas that 
were developed and implemented in the organization. The interviews are conducted 
by organization members; they interview each other and tell stories of innovation in 
which they have personally been involved. These stories are pulled together to create 
a pool of information describing the organization as an innovative system.
Discover the Themes. In this third phase, members examine the stories, both 
large and small, to identify a set of themes representing the common dimensions of 
people’s experiences. For example, the stories of innovation may contain themes 
about how managers gave people the freedom to explore a new idea, the sup￾port organization members received from their coworkers, or how the exposure 
to customers sparked creative thinking. No theme is too small to be represented; 
it is important that all of the underlying mechanisms that helped to generate and 
support the themes be described. The themes represent the basis for moving from 
“what is” to “what could be.”
Envision a Preferred Future. Members then examine the identified themes, chal￾lenge the status quo, and describe a compelling future. Based on the organization’s 
successful past, members collectively visualize the organization’s future and 
develop “possibility propositions”—statements that bridge the organization’s cur￾rent best practices with ideal possibilities for future organizing.27 These propositions 
should present a truly exciting, provocative, and possible picture of the future. 
1.

3.
4.CHAPTER 2 The Nature of Planned Change 29
Based on these possibilities, members identify the relevant stakeholders and critical 
organization processes that must be aligned to support the emergence of the envi￾sioned future. The vision becomes a statement of “what should be.”
Design and Deliver Ways to Create the Future. The final phase involves the 
design and delivery of ways to create the future. It describes the activities and cre￾ates the plans necessary to bring about the vision. It proceeds to action and assess￾ment phases similar to those of action research described previously. Members 
make changes, assess the results, make necessary adjustments, and so on as they 
move the organization toward the vision and sustain “what will be.” The process 
is continued by renewing the conversations about the best of what is.
Comparisons of Change Models
All three models—Lewin’s change model, the action research model, and the posi￾tive model—describe the phases by which planned change occurs in organizations. As 
shown in Figure 2.1, the models overlap in that their emphasis on action to imple￾ment organizational change is preceded by a preliminary stage (unfreezing, diagnosis, 
or initiate the inquiry) and is followed by a closing stage (refreezing or evaluation). 
Moreover, all three approaches emphasize the application of behavioral science knowl￾edge, involve organization members in the change process to varying degrees, and 
recognize that any interaction between a consultant and an organization constitutes an 
intervention that may affect the organization. However, Lewin’s change model differs 
from the other two in that it focuses on the general process of planned change, rather 
than on specific OD activities.
Lewin’s model and the action research model differ from the positive approach in 
terms of the level of involvement of the participants and the focus of change. Lewin’s 
model and traditional action research emphasize the role of the consultant with rela￾tively limited member involvement in the change process. Contemporary applications 
of action research and the positive model, on the other hand, treat both consultants 
and participants as co-learners who are heavily involved in planned change. In addi￾tion, Lewin’s model and action research are more concerned with fixing problems than 
with focusing on what the organization does well and leveraging those strengths.
GENERAL MODEL OF PLANNED CHANGE
The three models of planned change suggest a general framework for planned change 
as shown in Figure 2.2. The framework describes the four basic activities that practi￾tioners and organization members jointly carry out in organization development. The 
arrows connecting the different activities in the model show the typical sequence of 
events, from entering and contracting, to diagnosing, to planning and implementing 
change, to evaluating and institutionalizing change. The lines connecting the activi￾ties emphasize that organizational change is not a straightforward, linear process but 
involves considerable overlap and feedback among the activities. Because the model 
serves to organize the remaining parts of this book, Figure 2.2 also shows which spe￾cific chapters apply to the four major change activities.
Entering and Contracting
The first set of activities in planned change concerns entering and contracting 
(described in Chapter 4). Those events help managers decide whether they want 
to engage further in a planned change program and to commit resources to such a 
process. Entering an organization involves gathering initial data to understand the 
problems facing the organization or to determine the positive areas for inquiry. Once 
5.30 PART 1 Overview of Organization Development
this information is collected, the problems or opportunities are discussed with man￾agers and other organization members to develop a contract or agreement to engage 
in planned change. The contract spells out future change activities, the resources 
that will be committed to the process, and how OD practitioners and organization 
members will be involved. In many cases, organizations do not get beyond this early 
stage of planned change because one or more situations arise: Disagreements about 
the need for change surface, resource constraints are encountered, or other methods 
for change appear more feasible. When OD is used in nontraditional and interna￾tional settings, the entering and contracting process must be sensitive to the context 
in which the change is taking place.
Diagnosing
In this stage of planned change, the client system is carefully studied. Diagnosis can 
focus on understanding organizational problems, including their causes and conse￾quences, or on collecting stories about the organization’s positive attributes. The diag￾nostic process is one of the most important activities in OD. It includes choosing an 
appropriate model for understanding the organization and gathering, analyzing, and 
feeding back information to managers and organization members about the problems 
or opportunities that exist.
Diagnostic models for analyzing problems (described in Chapters 5 and 6) explore 
three levels of activities. Organization issues represent the most complex level of analy￾sis and involve the total system. Group-level issues are associated with department 
and group effectiveness. Individual-level issues involve the way jobs are designed and 
performed.
Gathering, analyzing, and feeding back data are the central change activities in diag￾nosis. Chapter 7 describes how data can be gathered through interviews, observations, 
survey instruments, or such archival sources as meeting minutes and organization 
charts. It also explains how data can be reviewed and analyzed. In Chapter 8, we describe 
the process of feeding back diagnostic data. Organization members, often in collaboration 
with an OD practitioner, jointly discuss the data and their implications for change.
Planning and Implementing Change
In this stage, organization members and practitioners jointly plan and implement OD 
interventions. They design interventions to achieve the organization’s vision or goals 
and make action plans to implement them. There are several criteria for designing 
interventions, including the organization’s readiness for change, its current change 
capability, its culture and power distributions, and the change agent’s skills and abilities

(discussed in Chapter 9). Depending on the outcomes of diagnosis, there are four major 
types of interventions in OD:
Human process interventions at the individual, group, and total system levels 
(Chapters 12 and 13)
Interventions that modify an organization’s structure and technology
(Chapters 14, 15, and 16)
Human resources interventions that seek to improve member performance and 
wellness (Chapters 17, 18, and 19)
Strategic interventions that involve managing the organization’s relationship to its 
external environment and the internal structure and process necessary to support 
a business strategy (Chapters 20, 21, and 22).
Chapters 23 and 24 present specialized information for carrying out OD in interna￾tional settings and in such nontraditional organizations as schools, health care institu￾tions, family-owned businesses, and the public sector.
Implementing interventions is concerned with leading and managing the change 
process. As discussed in Chapter 10, it includes motivating change, creating a desired 
future vision of the organization, developing political support, managing the transition 
toward the vision, and sustaining momentum for change.
Evaluating and Institutionalizing Change
The final stage in planned change involves evaluating the effects of the intervention 
and managing the institutionalization of successful change programs so they persist. 
(Those two activities are described in Chapter 11.) Feedback to organization mem￾bers about the intervention’s results provides information about whether the changes 
should be continued, modified, or suspended. Institutionalizing successful changes 
involves reinforcing them through feedback, rewards, and training.
Application 2.1 describes the initiation of a planned change process in a government 
organization. It provides especially rich detail on the planning and implementing phase 
of change, and on how people can be involved in the process.28
DIFFERENT TYPES OF PLANNED CHANGE
The general model of planned change describes how the OD process typically unfolds 
in organizations. In actual practice, the different phases are not nearly as orderly as 
the model implies. OD practitioners tend to modify or adjust the stages to fit the needs 
of the situation. Steps in planned change may be implemented in a variety of ways, 
depending on the client’s needs and goals, the change agent’s skills and values, and 
the organization’s context. Thus, planned change can vary enormously from one situ￾ation to another.
To understand the differences better, planned change can be contrasted across situations 
on three key dimensions: the magnitude of organizational change, the degree to which 
the client system is organized, and whether the setting is domestic or international.
Magnitude of Change
Planned change efforts can be characterized as falling along a continuum ranging 
from incremental changes that involve fine-tuning the organization to fundamental 
changes that entail radically altering how it operates.29 Incremental changes tend to 
involve limited dimensions and levels of the organization, such as the decision-making 
processes of work groups. They occur within the context of the organization’s existing 
business strategy, structure, and culture and are aimed at improving the status quo.

Planned Change at the San Diego County 
Regional Airport Authority
The San Diego County Regional Airport Authority 
(SDCRAA) was created by a California state law 
in October 2001; this gave it the responsibility to 
establish and operate airports within San Diego 
County. Most importantly, from Thella Bowens’s 
perspective, the law required the San Diego 
Unified Port District (Port of San Diego) to trans￾fer operation of San Diego’s international airport 
to the SDCRAA by January 2003. Bowens was the 
current senior director of the Aviation Division 
within the Port of San Diego that was responsible 
for operating the San Diego International Airport. 
When the law was passed, she was named Interim 
Executive Director of the SDCRAA, and assigned 
an interim advisory board to help manage the 
transition.
Bowens’s tenure with the organization gave her 
an important understanding of the organization’s 
operations and its history. For example, the San 
Diego International Airport accounted for about 
$4.3 billion or roughly 4% of San Diego’s regional 
economy. Forecasts called for air travel to more 
than double to 35 million passengers by 2030, and 
contribute up to $8 billion to the regional econ￾omy. In addition, Bowens had participated in the 
Aviation Division’s strategic planning process in 
2001. She was well positioned to lead this effort.
As she thought about managing the start-up 
of the SDCRAA, two broad but interdependent 
categories of initial activity emerged: developing 
the transition plan and dealing with the legal and 
regulatory issues.
DEVELOPING THE TRANSITION PLAN
In April 2002, Bowens took the senior team from 
the old Aviation Division to an off-site workshop to 
discuss the creation and management of an effec￾tive transition process. This group understood the 
importance of SDCRAA quickly becoming a stand￾alone agency and the need to be seen differently in 
the marketplace. The group recommended revising 
the existing strategic plan, to hire staff to research, 
discuss, and create a transition plan, and to con￾duct retreats with employees from multiple organi￾zational levels. In response, Bowens chartered the 
Airport Transition Team to ensure the smooth and 
seamless transfer of operations and public services 
provided by the airport without regard to which 
agency was responsible for their provision.
In May 2002, seven employees were handpicked 
from the Aviation Division to become members of 
the Airport Transition Team and relieved of their 
day-to-day job responsibilities so they could focus 
on the transition. The selection criteria included 
the ability to work within a process yet think out￾side of the box, to communicate well with others 
in a team, and to influence directors and man￾agers without having formal authority. A one￾and-a-half-day kick-off meeting was held to set 
expectations, to communicate goals and respon￾sibilities, and to initiate the team. A “war room” 
was established for the team to keep records, hold 
meetings, and serve as a communication hub. The 
team named themselves the “Metamorphs.”
Many Metamorph members came from differ￾ent parts of the organization and, having never 
worked together, needed to rely on each other to 
effectively design the transition process. Senior 
team member Angela Shafer-Payne, then director 
of Airport Business and Administration, worked 
closely with the Metamorphs and led formal team￾building activities throughout the year. Through 
their work together, the Metamorphs discovered 
how large and daunting the organizational change 
was and yet appreciated the unique, once-in-a￾lifetime opportunity to make an impact. As one 
member put it, “How many times in your life can 
you say that you helped put together a brand-new 
organization?”
The Metamorphs decided that to meet their char￾ter, any transition plan had to be designed spe￾cifically to minimize disruption to customers and 
service, minimize airport and nonairport financial 
impacts, and properly address and resolve all legal 
and regulatory matters. These criteria guided the 
creation of 12 functional teams (which expanded 
later to 19). Responsibility for the teams was 
divided among the transition team members, 
and each team was composed of employees 
from the old Aviation Division and other Port 
of San Diego departments. Their mission was to CHAPTER 2 The Nature of Planned Change 33
collect data, establish new or parallel functions 
for the SDCRAA, and highlight any issues related 
to the start-up of that particular function. Once 
the teams were in place, they were given tools to 
use and questions that needed to be addressed. 
Each team set aside time to review all of the 
records in each functional area. For example, 
the human resources functional team consisted 
of Aviation Division employees, HR professionals 
from the Port of San Diego, and Port attorneys; 
it was charged with developing the actual transi￾tion mechanism, HR operations, and HR organi￾zational structure. Another team focused on the 
environmental issues involved in the transition. 
They examined over 100 different environmental 
permits held by the Port of San Diego to under￾stand if SDCRAA needed a similar permit, needed 
to be a co-permittee with the Port of San Diego, 
or if the SDCRAA could stand alone. If it were a 
stand-alone situation, then documentation would 
be prepared to transfer the permit.
To ensure that no issues fell through the cracks, 
three distinct peer reviews were held in the sum￾mer and fall of 2002. The peer review panels were 
staffed by professionals within the aviation indus￾try, people who had experienced a transition of 
some type within an organization, or those who 
were integral to the start-up of the organization. 
The first peer review panel examined the transi￾tion plan and offered advice on whether to add 
any other critical and/or missing components. The 
second peer review panel, consisting of mostly 
human resources professionals, examined the 
proposed organizational structure. The final peer 
review panel focused on the IT systems portion of 
the transition plan because of technology’s critical 
role in the overall success of many of the internal 
processes.
DEALING WITH THE LEGAL AND 
REGULATORY ISSUES
By January 2002, the SDCRAA was not yet a full 
agency and had only one employee, Thella Bowens. 
Despite all the work of the Metamorphs and the 
functional teams, and sometimes because of it, 
Bowens also had to interface with the California 
legislature. The original legislation (California 
Senate Bill AB93 [2001–2002]) provided a frame￾work for setting up the new agency but left many 
questions unanswered, including issues relating to 
property transfer (SDCRAA would lease land from 
the Port on a 66-year lease) and the transitioning 
of employees from one public agency to another. 
To provide clarity and another layer of under￾standing, “clean-up” legislation (SB 1896) was 
passed in mid-2002. Together with the original bill, 
the legislation protected employees to ensure no 
loss of jobs or benefits. This gave the Metamorphs 
additional information and guidance to deal with 
employee contract issues. For example, in the 
middle of the transition planning process, the 
Port District had to renegotiate its union contract. 
The Metamorphs had to work closely with the 
airport’s external counsel, the Port of San Diego 
counsel, and state senators to ensure a smooth 
negotiation.
Finally, Bowens and the Metamorphs had to address 
changes to federal security regulations outlined in 
the Aviation and Transportation Security Act that 
resulted from the September 11, 2001, attacks. 
Those events caused a number of disruptions for 
many stakeholders in the air transportation indus￾try. They required the transition plan to include 
a component that focused on keeping costs con￾tained to enable aviation partners, the airlines, the 
gate gourmets, and tenants, to weather the storm.
IMPLEMENTATION AND EVALUATION
The final transition plan was presented to the 
interim board and then to the Board of Port 
Commissioners for approval in October 2002. The 
approved plan was comprised of several compon￾ents, including an IT conversion plan and the 
process for formally transferring responsibility to 
the SDCRAA, but the key elements were human 
resources and communication plans.
The human resources plan specified the transition 
of 145 budgeted Aviation Division employees to 
52 vacancies plus the 90 other positions identified 
by the Metamorphs to make the organization whole. 
The plan called for all of the positions to be filled by 
mid-2005. The human resources plan also provided 
for the purchase of services, like the Harbor Police, 
from the Port of San Diego until mid-2005.
The communication plan was critical to the imple￾mentation phase. The Metamorphs regularly car￾ried information about their progress to coworkers
in their respective departments. In addition, com￾munication meetings with the entire organization,
called “all hands meetings,” were held to provide 34 PART 1 Overview of Organization Development
information about the transition. The Airport 
Transition Plan contained a special emphasis on 
the needs of the employee. Bowens understood 
the sociotechnical nature of change and did not 
want the human factor to be forgotten in the midst 
of all the legal, technical, and other transitions. 
She included a number of change management 
education sessions for all employees. The change 
management education sessions were developed to 
reassure employees; to encourage genuine, candid, 
frequent, high-quality communications; and to 
neutralize anxiety and fears.
During the sessions, employees were (1) updated 
on the progress of the transition; (2) introduced 
to change theories, models, and concepts; and 
(3) encouraged to share their issues, fears, anxieties, 
concerns, and creative ideas. Employee input was 
organized into themes, then documented and com￾municated to Bowens and her direct reports. The 
leadership team was committed to answering ques￾tions and addressing concerns that emerged from 
the change management sessions. Airport managers 
met regularly to select and answer questions for 
publication in the organization newsletter or live 
communication at “all hands meetings.” In addition, 
the employee satisfaction survey was updated with 
questions to learn about transition concerns.
Thella Bowens was named President and CEO of 
the SDCRAA on January 1, 2003. By June 2003, 
the SDCRAA had received awards based on superb 
customer service and outstanding levels of perform￾ance. The SDCRAA, based on all available metrics, 
is successfully operating San Diego’s international 
airport and serving over 15.2 million passengers 
on 620 daily flights in and out of the airport. Part 
of the success is due to the way the transition plan 
was developed. Because of the broad participation 
in its creation, many employees understood the 
plan. When issues arose, identifying the personnel 
to become part of an ad hoc problem-solving group 
already familiar with the topic was easy.
“Ms. Bowens accomplished the extraordinary job 
of leading a successful transition of the airport from 
the Unified Port of San Diego to the Authority,” 
said Joseph W. Craver, Authority (SDCRAA) 
Chairman. “She is highly regarded and respected 
for both her breadth of knowledge of aviation 
management issues and her visionary leader￾ship.” Thella Bowens added, “Fortunately, we’ve 
been supported by very dedicated professional 
employees who have exhibited great resolve and 
sheer hard work through the transition process, 
and continue to do so as we create a ‘world-class’ 
organization.”
Fundamental changes, on the other hand, are directed at significantly altering how the 
organization operates. They tend to involve several organizational dimensions, includ￾ing structure, culture, reward systems, information processes, and work design. They 
also involve changing multiple levels of the organization, from top-level management 
through departments and work groups to individual jobs.
Planned change traditionally has been applied in situations involving incremental 
change. Organizations in the 1960s and 1970s were concerned mainly with fine-tuning 
their bureaucratic structures by resolving many of the social problems that emerged 
with increasing size and complexity. In those situations, planned change involves a 
relatively bounded set of problem-solving activities. OD practitioners are typically 
contracted by managers to help solve specific problems in particular organizational 
systems, such as poor communication among members of a work team or low cus￾tomer satisfaction scores in a department store. Diagnostic and change activities tend 
to be limited to the defined issues, although additional problems may be uncovered 
and may need to be addressed. Similarly, the change process tends to focus on those CHAPTER 2 The Nature of Planned Change 35
organizational systems having specific problems, and it generally terminates when the 
problems are resolved. Of course, the change agent may contract to help solve addi￾tional problems.
In recent years, OD has been increasingly concerned with fundamental change. As 
described in Chapter 1, the greater competitiveness and uncertainty of today’s environ￾ment have led a growing number of organizations to alter drastically the way in which 
they operate. In such situations, planned change is more complex, extensive, and 
long term than when applied to incremental change.30 Because fundamental change 
involves most features and levels of the organization, it is typically driven from the top, 
where corporate strategy and values are set. Change agents help senior executives cre￾ate a vision of a desired future organization and energize movement in that direction. 
They also help them develop structures for managing the transition from the present to 
the future organization and may include, for example, a program management office 
and a variety of overlapping steering committees and redesign teams. Staff experts also 
may redesign many features of the firm, such as performance measures, rewards, plan￾ning processes, work designs, and information systems.
Because of the complexity and extensiveness of fundamental change, OD profes￾sionals often work in teams comprising members with different yet complementary 
areas of expertise. The consulting relationship persists over relatively long time periods 
and includes a great deal of renegotiation and experimentation among consultants and 
managers. The boundaries of the change effort are more uncertain and diffuse than 
those in incremental change, thus making diagnosis and change seem more like dis￾covery than like problem solving. (We describe complex strategic and transformational 
types of change in more detail in Chapters 20, 21, and 22.)
It is important to emphasize that fundamental change may or may not be develop￾mental in nature. Organizations may drastically alter their strategic direction and way 
of operating without significantly developing their capacity to solve problems and to 
achieve both high performance and quality of work life. For example, firms may simply 
change their marketing mix, dropping or adding products, services, or customers; they 
may drastically downsize by cutting out marginal businesses and laying off managers 
and workers; or they may tighten managerial and financial controls and attempt to 
squeeze more out of the labor force. On the other hand, organizations may undertake 
fundamental change from a developmental perspective. They may seek to make them￾selves more competitive by developing their human resources; by getting managers 
and employees more involved in problem solving and innovation; and by promoting 
flexibility and direct, open communication. The OD approach to fundamental change 
is particularly relevant in today’s rapidly changing and competitive environment. To 
succeed in this setting, firms such as General Electric, Kimberly-Clark, ABB, Hewlett￾Packard, and Motorola are transforming themselves from control-oriented bureaucra￾cies to high-involvement organizations capable of changing and improving themselves 
continually.
Degree of Organization
Planned change efforts also can vary depending on the degree to which the organi￾zation or client system is organized. In overorganized situations, such as in highly 
mechanistic, bureaucratic organizations, various dimensions such as leadership styles, 
job designs, organization structure, and policies and procedures are too rigid and 
overly defined for effective task performance. Communication between management 
and employees is typically suppressed, conflicts are avoided, and employees are apa￾thetic. In underorganized organizations, on the other hand, there is too little constraint 
or regulation for effective task performance. Leadership, structure, job design, and 
policy are poorly defined and fail to direct task behaviors effectively. Communication 36 PART 1 Overview of Organization Development
is fragmented, job responsibilities are ambiguous, and employees’ energies are dis￾sipated because they lack direction. Underorganized situations are typically found in 
such areas as product development, project management, and community develop￾ment, where relationships among diverse groups and participants must be coordinated 
around complex, uncertain tasks.
In overorganized situations, where much of OD practice has historically taken place, 
planned change is generally aimed at loosening constraints on behavior. Changes in 
leadership, job design, structure, and other features are designed to liberate suppressed 
energy, to increase the flow of relevant information between employees and manag￾ers, and to promote effective conflict resolution. The typical steps of planned change—
entry, diagnosis, intervention, and evaluation—are intended to penetrate a relatively 
closed organization or department and make it increasingly open to self-diagnosis and 
revitalization. The relationship between the OD practitioner and the management 
team attempts to model this loosening process. The consultant shares leadership of the 
change process with management, encourages open communications and confronta￾tion of conflict, and maintains flexibility in relating to the organization.
When applied to organizations facing problems in being underorganized, planned 
change is aimed at increasing organization by clarifying leadership roles, structuring 
communication between managers and employees, and specifying job and departmen￾tal responsibilities. These activities require a modification of the traditional phases of 
planned change and include the following four steps:31
Identification. This step identifies the relevant people or groups who need to be 
involved in the change program. In many underorganized situations, people and 
departments can be so disconnected that there is ambiguity about who should be 
included in the problem-solving process. For example, when managers of differ￾ent departments have only limited interaction with each other, they may disagree 
or be confused about which departments should be involved in developing a new 
product or service.
Convention. In this step, the relevant people or departments in the company are 
brought together to begin organizing for task performance. For example, depart￾ment managers might be asked to attend a series of organizing meetings to discuss 
the division of labor and the coordination required to introduce a new product.
Organization. Different organizing mechanisms are created to structure the newly 
required interactions among people and departments. This might include creating 
new leadership positions, establishing communication channels, and specifying 
appropriate plans and policies.
Evaluation. In this final step, the outcomes of the organization step are assessed. 
The evaluation might signal the need for adjustments in the organizing process or 
for further identification, convention, and organization activities.
In carrying out these four steps of planned change in underorganized situations, the 
relationship between the OD practitioner and the client system attempts to reinforce 
the organizing process. The consultant develops a well-defined leadership role, which 
might be autocratic during the early stages of the change program. Similarly, the con￾sulting relationship is clearly defined and tightly specified. In effect, the interaction 
between the consultant and the client system supports the larger process of bringing 
order to the situation.
Application 2.2 is an example of planned change in an underorganized situation. 
In this case, the change agent is a person from industry who identifies a multifaceted 
problem: University research that should be helpful to manufacturing organizations is 
not being shaped, coordinated, or transferred. In response, he forms an organization to 
tighten up the relationships between the two parties.32

Planned Change in an Underorganized System
The Institute for Manufacturing and Automation 
Research (IMAR) was founded in 1987 in Los 
Angeles by a group of manufacturing indus￾try members. In its earliest stages of develop￾ment, one person who had a clear picture of the 
obstacles to manufacturing excellence was Dale 
Hartman, IMAR’s executive director and former 
director for manufacturing at Hughes Aircraft 
Company. He and several other industry associ￾ates pinpointed the predominant reasons for 
flagging competitiveness: needless duplication of 
effort among manufacturing innovators; difficul￾ties in transferring technological breakthroughs 
from university to industry; frequent irrelevance 
of university research to the needs of industry; 
and the inability of individual industry members 
to commit the time and funds to research projects 
needed for continued technological advances.
Hartman and his colleagues determined that 
organizations should create a pool of funds for 
research and concluded that the research would 
most efficiently be carried out in existing uni￾versity facilities. They worked through at least 
several plans before they arrived at the idea of the 
IMAR consortium. The U.S. Navy had been inter￾ested in joint efforts for innovations in artificial 
intelligence, but its constraints and interests were 
judged to be too narrow to address the problems 
that Hartman and the others identified.
Networking with other industry members—TRW, 
Hughes, Northrop, and Rockwell—and two uni￾versities with which Hughes had been engaging 
in ongoing research—the University of Southern 
California (USC) and University of California, Los 
Angeles (UCLA)—this original group formed a 
steering committee to investigate the viability of 
a joint research and development consortium. 
Each of the six early planners contributed $5,000 
as seed money for basic expenses. The steering 
committee, based on experience in cooperative 
research, determined that a full-time person 
was needed to assume leadership of the consor￾tium. Members of the committee persuaded Dale 
Hartman to retire early from Hughes and take on 
IMAR’s leadership full-time. Hartman brought 
with him a wealth of knowledge about barri￾ers to innovation and technology transfer, and a 
solid reputation in both industry and academia 
that was crucial for the success of multiple-sector 
partnerships. As a former Hughes networker, he 
knew how to lobby state and federal government 
sources for funds and legislation that promoted 
industry innovation. He also knew a host of tal￾ented people in southern California whom he 
would persuade to become IMAR members.
In his 30 years in manufacturing, Hartman found 
that university-driven research had not pro￾duced a respectable yield of usable information. 
University research was frequently irrelevant to 
industry needs and seldom provided for transfer of 
usable innovation to the plant floor. Industry was 
only tangentially involved in what the university 
was doing and Hartman saw little opportunity 
for the two sectors to benefit from a partnership. 
Therefore, it was determined that IMAR would 
be user-driven. Industry would set the agenda by 
choosing projects from among university propos￾als that promised to be of generic use to industry 
members, and it would benefit by influencing the 
direction of research and receiving earlyinforma￾tion about research results.
In the next several months, the steeringcommit￾tee and Hartman met regularly to define common 
research needs and locate funding sources. They 
sought industry sponsors from high-technology 
companies with an understanding of the prob￾lems in manufacturing research and a desire to 
do more than merely supply money. They wanted 
members who would be willing to get involved in 
IMAR’s programs. Furthermore, they wanted all 
members to be able to use the results of IMAR’s 
generic research while not competing directly with 
each other. Finally, they decided that they wanted 
a relatively small membership. If the membership 
grew too large, it might become unwieldy and 
thus obstruct efforts to get things done.
IMAR’s industrial advisory board was formed with 
six industrial organizations represented—Xerox, 
Hughes, TRW, Northrup, IBM, and Rockwell—in 
addition to USC and UCLA. Members were to 
pay $100,000 each and make a three-year com￾mitment to IMAR. With initial objectives in place 
and a committed membership, Hartman was 
already searching for additional funding sources. 
He was successful in getting a bill introduced in 
California’s state legislature, later signed by the 38 PART 1 Overview of Organization Development
governor, that authorized the state department 
of commerce to fund IMAR $200,000. Moreover, 
IMAR was able to tie into the Industry–University 
Cooperative Research Center Program (IUCRCP) 
of the National Science Foundation (NSF) by 
forming an industry–university consortium called 
the Center for Manufacturing and Automation 
Research (CMAR). NSF funded CMAR with a $2 
million grant and a five-year commitment. NSF 
funding in particular was sought because of the 
instant credibility that NSF sponsorship gives to 
such an institute.
NSF requested that several more universities be 
added to the consortium. In addition, an NSF eval￾uator was to be present at all IMAR meetings and 
conduct ongoing evaluation of CMAR’s progress. 
IMAR already had UCLA and USC among its 
members and now added four university affiliates 
to work on research projects: the University of 
California, Irvine; University of California, Santa 
Barbara; Caltech; and Arizona State University. 
The IMAR steering committee then voted to fund 
research projects at an affiliated university only if 
it involved cooperation with either USC or UCLA. 
Each of the four university affiliates was paired 
with either USC or UCLA. Each affiliate univer￾sity was selected because it provided expertise in 
an area of interest to IMAR’s industrial member￾ship. Arizona State, for example, had expertise 
in knowledge-based simulation systems in indus￾trial engineering, a field of special concern to 
IMAR’s membership. IMAR funded a number of 
projects, including projects between the affiliated 
universities, between joint investigators at USC 
and UCLA, and independent projects at USC and 
UCLA. Figure 2.3 shows IMAR’s structure.
CMAR operated under the auspices of IMAR 
with the same board of directors serving both 
consortia. There are two codirectors of CMAR: 
Dr. George Bekey, chairman of the Computer 
Science Department at USC, and Dr. Michel 
Melkanoff, director of UCLA’s Center for Integrated 
Manufacturing. As codirectors they had an indi￾rect reporting relationship to Dale Hartman. Their 
responsibilities included distributing the research 
funds and serving as the focal point on their 
respective campuses. Questions from project team 
members are directed to one or the other codirec￾tor, depending on the project. Each of the codi￾rectors takes responsibility for managing project 
team members and providing rewards, such as 
reduced course loads, to research professors wher￾ever possible.
The codirectors further work to encourage infor￾mal ties with industry members. For example,
Dr. Bekey initiated efforts to have IMAR represent￾atives regularly visit others’ facilities to encourage 
them to cooperate and share ideas. That practice 
further deepens each industrial member’s commit￾ment to IMAR because the representatives were 
associating with one another and other colleagues 
in the workplace. In the event that an industry 
or university representative left, an associate was 
more likely to be there to take his or her place. 
Further, Bekey noted that the association between 
industry and university helped industry to over￾come its short-term orientation and helped uni￾versity people appreciate applied problems and 
manufacturing needs.
IMAR’s board of directors set the research agenda 
at annual reviews in which it made recommenda￾tions for topics to be funded. IMAR took these rec￾ommendations and translated them into “requests 
for proposals” that were circulated among the 
participating university members. CMAR’s codi￾rectors then solicited proposals from the univer￾sity membership. Researchers’ proposals were 
evaluated and ranked by industry representatives 
and then passed back to the industry advisory 
board, which made final determinations on which 
projects would be funded.
Not only did IMAR engage in research projects, 
such as microelectronics, digital computers, lasers, 
and fiber optics, it worked to resolve critical 
problems for manufacturing innovation research. 
One area of study was technology transfer. IMAR 
established a pilot production facility that Hartman 
called “a halfway house for manufacturing.” The 
facility permitted basic research to be brought to 
maturity and was capable of producing deliverable 
parts. The facility also engaged in systems-level 
research in such areas as management and sys￾tems software, and provided an excellent training 
ground for students.
Another strength of IMAR was its affiliation 
with an NSF evaluator who was appointed to 
follow the progress of the industry–university 
cooperative research center. Dr. Ann Marczak 
was IMAR’s initial NSF evaluator. NSF conducted 
regular audits of the 39 IUCRCPs it sponsored 
and made information available about survey 
results, others’ reports of what works, and so CHAPTER 2 The Nature of Planned Change 39
forth. Dr. Marczak served a valuable function 
to IMAR as an objective source of feedback. 
After her first evaluation, for example, Marczak 
recommended that a project team be formed to 
conduct ongoing progress assessment for each 
of the research projects IMAR sponsored. The 
evaluator’s findings also served as NSF’s means of 
determining how well each of the funded centers 
was performing. A center was judged successful if 
after five years it could exist without NSF funds. 
NSF also evaluated each center in terms of how 
much industry money its projects generated, how 
much additional money the center generated in 
research projects, the number of patents granted,

products produced, and the satisfaction of faculty 
and industry participants.
After two years of operation, IMAR had dealt 
with many of the problems that so frequently 
plague collaborative research and development 
efforts among organizations. It had a well-defined 
purpose that was strongly supported by its mem￾bers. It was well structured and had a good 
balance of resources and needs among its mem￾bership. Formal and informal communication 
networks were established. It had strong leader￾ship. Members of IMAR respected Hartman for 
his technological expertise and skills as a net￾worker. Hartman had a strong sense of IMAR’s 
mission. After a discussion with him, one got the 
sense that there was not an obstacle he would 
not overcome. His vision continued to inspire 
commitment among the IMAR membership. As 
one member put it, “You end up wanting to see 
what you can do for the cause.”
Not only did IMAR have the commitment of a 
full-time leader and strong feedback from its 
NSF evaluator, it involved user-driven research. 
Although the research was basic, it was chosen 
by the users themselves to benefit all members of 
the consortium. If the research had been applied, 
it would have been more difficult for members to 
find projects yielding information that all of them 
could use. The involvement of multiple universi￾ties further provided the talent of top researchers 
in diverse areas of technological expertise. Finally, 
NSF was furnishing a large proportion of the 
funding for the first five years as well as regular 
evaluations.
Domestic vs. International Settings
Planned change efforts have traditionally been applied in North American and 
European settings, but they are increasingly used outside of these cultures. Developed 
in Western societies, OD reflects the underlying values and assumptions of these cul￾tural settings, including equality, involvement, and short-term time horizons. Under 
these conditions, it works quite well. In other societies, a different set of cultural values 
and assumptions can be operating and make the application of OD problematic. In con￾trast to Western societies, for example, the cultures of most Asian countries are more 
hierarchical and status conscious, less open to discussing personal issues, more con￾cerned with “saving face,” and have a longer time horizon for results. These cultural 
differences can make OD more difficult to implement, especially for North American or 
European practitioners; they may simply be unaware of the cultural norms and values 
that permeate the society.
The cultural values that guide OD practice in the United States, for example, include 
a tolerance for ambiguity, equality among people, individuality, and achievement 
motives. An OD process that encourages openness among individuals, high levels of 
participation, and actions that promote increased effectiveness is viewed favorably. 
The OD practitioner is also assumed to hold these values and to model them in the 
conduct of planned change. Most reported cases of OD involve Western-based organi￾zations using practitioners trained in the traditional model and raised and experienced 
in Western society.
When OD is applied outside of North America or Europe (and sometimes even 
within these settings), the action research process must be adapted to fit the cultural 
context. For example, the diagnostic phase, which is aimed at understanding the 
current drivers of organization effectiveness, can be modified in a variety of ways. 
Diagnosis can involve many organization members or include only senior executives; CHAPTER 2 The Nature of Planned Change 41
be directed from the top, conducted by an outside consultant, or performed by internal 
consultants; or involve face-to-face interviews or organizational documents. Each step 
in the general model of planned change must be carefully mapped against the cultural 
context.
Conducting OD in international settings can be highly stressful on OD practitioners.
To be successful, they must develop a keen awareness of their own cultural biases, be 
open to seeing a variety of issues from another perspective, be fluent in the values and 
assumptions of the host country, and understand the economic and political context of 
business in the host country. Most OD practitioners are not able to meet all of those cri￾teria and partner with a “cultural guide,” often a member of the client organization, to 
help navigate the cultural, operational, and political nuances of change in that society.
CRITIQUE OF PLANNED CHANGE
Despite their continued refinement, the models and practice of planned change are still 
in a formative stage of development, and there is considerable room for improvement. 
Critics of OD have pointed out several problems with the way planned change has 
been conceptualized and practiced.
Conceptualization of Planned Change
Planned change has typically been characterized as involving a series of activities for 
carrying out effective organization development. Although current models outline a 
general set of steps to be followed, considerably more information is needed to guide 
how those steps should be performed in specific situations. In an extensive review and 
critique of planned change theory, Porras and Robertson argued that planned change 
activities should be guided by information about (1) the organizational features that 
can be changed, (2) the intended outcomes from making those changes, (3) the causal 
mechanisms by which those outcomes are achieved, and (4) the contingencies upon 
which successful change depends.33 In particular, they noted that the key to organiza￾tional change is change in the behavior of each member and that the information avail￾able about the causal mechanisms that produce individual change is lacking. Overall, 
Porras and Robertson concluded that the information necessary to guide change is only 
partially available and that a good deal more research and thinking are needed to fill 
the gaps. Chapters 12 through 24 on OD interventions review what is currently known 
about change features, outcomes, causal mechanisms, and contingencies.
A related area where current thinking about planned change is deficient is knowl￾edge about how the stages of planned change differ across situations. Most models 
specify a general set of steps that are intended to be applicable to most change efforts. 
However, the previous section of this chapter showed how change activities can vary 
depending on such factors as the magnitude of change, the degree to which the client 
system is organized, and whether the change is being conducted in a domestic or an 
international setting. Considerably more effort needs to be expended identifying situ￾ational factors that may require modifying the general stages of planned change. That 
would likely lead to a rich array of planned change models, each geared to a specific 
set of situational conditions. Such contingency thinking is greatly needed in planned 
change.
Planned change also tends to be described as a rationally controlled, orderly process. 
Critics have argued that although this view may be comforting, it is seriously mislead￾ing.34 They point out that planned change has a more chaotic quality, often involving 
shifting goals, discontinuous activities, surprising events, and unexpected combina￾tions of changes. For example, executives often initiate changes without plans that 
clarify their strategies and goals. As change unfolds, new stakeholders may emerge 42 PART 1 Overview of Organization Development
and demand modifications reflecting previously unknown or unvoiced needs. Those 
emergent conditions make planned change a far more disorderly and dynamic process 
than is customarily portrayed, andconceptions need to capture that reality.
Most descriptions of planned change typically describe a beginning, middle, and end 
to the process. Critics have argued that planned change models that advocate evalu￾ation and institutionalization processes reinforce the belief that the organization will 
“refreeze” into some form of equilibrium following change.35 In the face of increasing 
globalization and technological change, it is unlikely that change will ever “be over.” 
Executives, managers, and organization members must be prepared for constant 
change in a variety of organizational features that are not obvious in most models of 
planned change.
Finally, the relationship between planned change and organizational performance 
and effectiveness is not well understood. OD traditionally has had problems assessing 
whether interventions are producing observed results. The complexity of the change 
situation, the lack of sophisticated analyses, and the long time periods for producing 
results have contributed to weak evaluation of OD efforts. Moreover, managers have 
often accounted for OD efforts with post hoc testimonials, reports of possible future 
benefits, and calls to support OD as the right thing to do. In the absence of rigorous 
assessment and measurement, it is difficult to make resource allocation decisions 
about change programs and to know which interventions are most effective in certain 
situations.
Practice of Planned Change
Critics have suggested several problems with the way planned change is carried out.36
Their concerns are not with the planned change model itself but with how change 
takes place and with the qualifications and activities of OD practitioners.
A growing number of OD practitioners have acquired skills in a specific technique, 
such as team building, total quality management, AI, large-group interventions, or gain 
sharing, and have chosen to specialize in that method. Although such specialization 
may be necessary, it can lead to a certain myopia given the complex array of techniques 
that define OD. Some OD practitioners favor particular techniques and ignore other 
strategies that might be more appropriate, tending to interpret organizational problems 
as requiring the favored technique. Thus, for example, it is not unusual to see consul￾tants pushing such methods as diversity training, reengineering, organization learning, 
or self-managing work teams as solutions to most organizational problems.
Effective change depends on a careful diagnosis of how the organization is function￾ing. Diagnosis identifies the underlying causes of organizational problems, such as poor 
product quality and employee dissatisfaction, or determines the positive opportunities 
that need to be promoted. It requires both time and money, and some organizations 
are not willing to make the necessary investment. Rather, they rely on preconceptions 
about what the problem is and hire consultants with skills appropriate to solve that 
problem. Managers may think, for example, that work design is the problem, so they 
hire an expert in job enrichment to implement a change program. The problem may 
be caused by other factors such as poor reward practices, however, and job enrichment 
would be inappropriate. Careful diagnosis can help to avoid such mistakes.
In situations requiring complex organizational changes, planned change is a long￾term process involving considerable innovation and learning on-site. It requires a 
good deal of time and commitment and a willingness to modify and refine changes as 
the circumstances require. Some organizations demand more rapid solutions to their 
problems and seek quick fixes from experts. Unfortunately, some OD consultants are 
more than willing to provide quick solutions.37 They sell prepackaged programs for 
organizations to adopt. Those programs appeal to managers because they typically CHAPTER 2 The Nature of Planned Change 43
include an explicit recipe to be followed, standard training materials, and clear time 
and cost boundaries. The quick fixes have trouble gaining wide organizational support 
and commitment, however, and seldom produce the positive results that have been 
advertised.
Other organizations have not recognized the systemic nature of change. Too often, 
they believe that intervention into one aspect or subpart of the organization will be 
sufficient to ameliorate the problems, and they are unprepared for the other changes 
that may be necessary to support a particular intervention. For example, at Verizon, 
the positive benefits of an employee involvement program did not begin to appear until 
after the organization redesigned its reward system to support the cross-functional 
collaboration necessary to solve highly complex problems. Changing any one part or 
feature of an organization often requires adjustments in the other parts to maintain an 
appropriate alignment. Thus, although quick fixes and change programs that focus on 
only one part or aspect of the organization may resolve some specific problems, they 
generally do not lead to complex organizational change or increase members’ capacity 
to carry out change.38
SUMMARY
Theories of planned change describe the activities necessary to modify strategies, 
structures, and processes to increase an organization’s effectiveness. Lewin’s change 
model, the action research model, and the positive model offer different views of the 
phases through which planned change occurs in organizations. Lewin’s change model 
views planned change as a three-step process of unfreezing, moving, and refreezing. 
It provides a general description of the process of planned change. The action research 
model focuses on planned change as a cyclical process involving joint activities 
between organization members and OD practitioners. It involves multiple steps that 
overlap and interact in practice: problem identification, consultation with a behavioral 
science expert, data gathering and preliminary diagnosis, feedback to a key client or 
group, joint diagnosis of the problem, joint action planning, action, and data gathering 
after action. The action research model places heavy emphasis on data gathering and 
diagnosis prior to action planning and implementation, and on assessment of results 
after action is taken. In addition, change strategies often are modified on the basis of 
continued diagnosis, and termination of one OD program may lead to further work 
in other areas of the firm. The positive model is oriented to what the organization is 
doing right. It seeks to build on positive opportunities that can lead to extraordinary 
performance.
Planned change theories can be integrated into a general model. Four sets of 
activities—entering and contracting, diagnosing, planning and implementing, and 
evaluating and institutionalizing—can be used to describe how change is accomplished 
in organizations. These four sets of activities also describe the general structure of the 
chapters in this book. The general model has broad applicability to planned change. 
It identifies the steps an organization typically moves through to implement change 
and specifies the OD activities needed to effect change. Although the planned change 
models describe general stages of how the OD process unfolds, there are different 
types of change depending on the situation. Planned change efforts can vary in terms 
of the magnitude of the change, the degree to which the client system is organized, 
and whether the setting is domestic or international. When situations differ on those 
dimensions, planned change can vary greatly. Critics of OD have pointed out several 
problems with the way planned change has been conceptualized and practiced, and 
specific areas where planned change can be improved.44 PART 1 Overview of Organization Development

38. Beer, Eisenstat, and Spector, “Change Programs.”The Organization Development 
Practitioner
Chapters 1 and 2 provided an overview of the 
field of organization development and a descrip￾tion of the nature of planned change. This 
chapter extends that introduction by examining 
the people who perform OD. A closer look at 
OD practitioners can provide a more personal 
perspective on the field and can help us under￾stand how and why OD relies so heavily on 
personal relationships between practitioners and 
organization members.
Much of the literature about OD practitioners 
views them as internal or external consultants 
providing professional services—diagnosing 
systems, developing interventions, and helping 
to implement them. More recent perspectives 
expand the practice scope to include profes￾sionals in related disciplines, such as industrial 
psychology and strategic management, as well 
as line managers who have learned how to 
carry out OD to change and develop their 
organizations.
A great deal of opinion and some research 
studies have focused on the necessary skills and 
knowledge of an effective OD practitioner. Studies 
of the profession provide a comprehensive list of 
basic skills and knowledge that all effective OD 
practitioners must possess.
Most of the relevant literature focuses on 
people specializing in OD as a profession and 
addresses their roles and careers. The OD 
practitioner’s role can be described in relation to 
its position: internal to the organization, external 
to it, or in a team comprising both internal and 
external consultants. The OD practitioner’s role 
can also be examined in terms of its marginal￾ity in organizations, of the emotional demands 
made on the practitioner, and of where it 
fits along a continuum from client-centered to 
consultant-centered functioning. Finally, organi￾zation development is an emerging profession 
providing alternative opportunities for gain￾ing competence and developing a career. The 
stressful nature of helping professions, however, 
suggests that OD practitioners must cope with 
the possibility of professional burnout.
As in other helping professions, such as 
medicine and law, values and ethics play an 
important role in guiding OD practice and 
in minimizing the chances that clients will be 
neglected or abused.
WHO IS THE ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT 
PRACTITIONER?
Throughout this text, the term organization development practitioner refers to at least three 
sets of people. The most obvious group of OD practitioners are those people specializing in 
OD as a profession. They may be internal or external consultants who offer professional
services to organizations, including their top managers, functional department heads, 
and staff groups. OD professionals traditionally have shared a common set of humanistic 
values promoting open communications, employee involvement, and personal growth 
and development. They tend to have common training, skills, and experience in the 
social processes of organizations (for example, group dynamics, decision making, and 
3CHAPTER 3 The Organization Development Practitioner 47
communications). In recent years, OD professionals have expanded those traditional 
values and skill sets to include more concern for organizational effectiveness, com￾petitiveness, and bottom-line results, and greater attention to the technical, structural, 
and strategic parts of organizations. That expansion, mainly in response to the highly 
competitive demands facing modern organizations, has resulted in a more diverse set of 
OD professionals geared to helping organizations cope with those pressures.1
The second set of people to whom the term OD practitioner applies are those special￾izing in fields related to OD, such as reward systems, organization design, total quality, 
information technology, and business strategy. These content-oriented fields increas￾ingly are becoming integrated with OD’s process orientation, particularly as OD projects 
have become more comprehensive, involving multiple features and varying parts of 
organizations. The integrated strategic change intervention described in Chapter 20, for 
example, is the result of marrying OD with business strategy.2
 A growing number of pro￾fessionals in these related fields are gaining experience and competence in OD, mainly 
through working with OD professionals on large-scale projects and through attending 
OD training sessions. For example, most of the large accounting firms diversified into 
management consulting and change management.3
 In most cases, professionals in these 
related fields do not subscribe fully to traditional OD values, nor do they have extensive 
OD training and experience. Rather, they have formal training and experience in their 
respective specialties, such as industrial engineering, information systems, or health care. 
They are OD practitioners in the sense that they apply their special competence within 
an OD-like process, typically by engaging OD professionals and managers to design and 
implement change programs. They also practice OD when they apply their OD com￾petence to their own specialties, thus spreading an OD perspective into such areas as 
compensation practices, work design, labor relations, and planning and strategy.
The third set of people to whom the term applies are the increasing number of man￾agers and administrators who have gained competence in OD and who apply it to their 
own work areas. Studies and recent articles argue that OD increasingly is applied by 
managers rather than by OD professionals.4
 Such studies suggest that the faster pace 
of change affecting organizations today is highlighting the centrality of the manager in 
managing change. Consequently, OD must become a general management skill. Along 
those lines, Kanter studied a growing number of firms, such as General Electric, Hewlett￾Packard, and 3M, where managers and employees have become “change masters.”5
 They 
have gained the expertise to introduce change and innovation into the organization.
Managers tend to gain competence in OD through interacting with OD professionals
in actual change programs. This on-the-job training frequently is supplemented with 
more formal OD training, such as the various workshops offered by the National Training 
Laboratories (NTL), USC’s Center for Effective Organizations, the Center for Creative 
Leadership, the Gestalt Institute, UCLA’s Extension Service, and others. Line manag￾ers increasingly are attending such external programs. Moreover, a growing number of 
organizations, including Capital One, Disney, and General Electric, have instituted in￾house training programs for managers to learn how to develop and change their work 
units. As managers gain OD competence, they become its most basic practitioners.
In practice, the distinctions among the three sets of OD practitioners are blurring.
A growing number of managers have transferred, either temporarily or permanently, 
into the OD profession. For example, companies such as Procter & Gamble have trained 
and rotated managers into full-time OD roles so that they can gain skills and experi￾ence needed for higher-level management positions. Also, it is increasingly common 
to find managers using their experience in OD to become external consultants. More 
OD practitioners are gaining professional competence in related specialties, such as 
business process reengineering, reward systems, and organization design. Conversely, 
many specialists in those related areas are achieving professional competence in OD. 
Cross-training and integration are producing a more comprehensive and complex kind 48 PART 1 Overview of Organization Development
of OD practitioner—one with a greater diversity of values, skills, and experience than 
a traditional practitioner.
COMPETENCIES OF AN EFFECTIVE ORGANIZATION 
DEVELOPMENT PRACTITIONER
The literature about OD competencies reveals a mixture of personality traits, experiences, 
knowledge, and skills presumed to lead to effective practice. For example, research on 
the characteristics of successful change practitioners yields the following list of attributes 
and abilities: diagnostic ability, basic knowledge of behavioral science techniques, empa￾thy, knowledge of the theories and methods within the consultant’s own discipline, 
goal-setting ability, problem-solving ability, ability to perform self-assessment, ability to 
see things objectively, imagination, flexibility, honesty, consistency, and trust.6
 Although 
these qualities and skills are laudable, there has been relatively little consensus about 
their importance to effective OD practice.
Two projects currently seek to define, categorize, and prioritize the skills and knowl￾edge required of OD practitioners. In the first effort, a broad and growing list of well￾known practitioners and researchers are asked to review and update a list of professional 
competencies. The most recent list has grown to 187 statements in nine areas of OD 
practice, including entry, start-up, assessment and feedback, action planning, inter￾vention, evaluation, adoption, separation, and general competencies.7
 The statements 
range from “staying centered in the present, focusing on the ongoing process” and 
“understanding and explaining how diversity will affect the diagnosis of the culture” to 
“basing change on business strategy and business needs” and “being comfortable with 
quantum leaps, radical shifts, and paradigm changes.” Recent items added to the list 
relate to international OD, large-group interventions, and transorganization skills.
To understand the relative importance of this long list, Worley and his colleagues col￾lected data from 364 OD practitioners.8
 The average respondent had six–ten years of OD 
experience, a master’s degree, and came from the United States. The results suggested 
an underlying structure to the list. Twenty-three competencies were generated that 
reflected both the skills and knowledge necessary to conduct planned change processes 
and the individual characteristics necessary to be an effective OD practitioner. Similar 
to other lists, the competencies included the ability to evaluate change, work with 
large-scale change efforts, create implementation plans, and manage diversity. One of 
the more surprising results, however, was the emergence of “self mastery” as the most 
important competence. The results supported the long-held belief that good OD practi￾tioners know themselves and that such knowledge forms the basis of effective practice.
The second project, sponsored by the Organization Development and Change 
Division of the Academy of Management,9
 seeks to develop a list of competen￾cies to guide curriculum development in graduate OD programs. More than 40 OD 
practitioners and researchers worked to develop the two competency lists shown in 
Table 3.1. First, foundation competencies are oriented toward descriptions of an exist￾ing system. They include knowledge from organization behavior, psychology, group 
dynamics, management and organization theory, research methods, and business 
practices. Second, core competencies are aimed at how systems change over time. They 
include knowledge of organization design, organization research, system dynamics, 
OD history, and theories and models for change; they also involve the skills needed to 
manage the consulting process, to analyze and diagnose systems, to design and choose 
interventions, to facilitate processes, to develop clients’ capability to manage their own 
change, and to evaluate organization change.
The information in Table 3.1 applies primarily to people specializing in OD as a pro￾fession. For them, possessing the listed knowledge and skills seems reasonable, espe￾cially in light of the growing diversity and complexity of interventions in OD.

competence in those areas may take considerable time and effort, and it is questionable 
whether the other two types of OD practitioners—managers and specialists in related 
fields—also need that full range of skills and knowledge. It seems more reasonable to 
suggest that some subset of the items listed in Table 3.1 should apply to all OD prac￾titioners, whether they are OD professionals, managers, or related specialists. Those 
items would constitute the practitioner’s basic skills and knowledge. Beyond that back￾ground, the three types of OD practitioners likely would differ in areas of concentration.
OD professionals would extend their breadth of skills across the remaining categories 
in Table 3.1; managers would focus on the functional knowledge of business areas; and 
related specialists would concentrate on skills in their respective areas.
Knowledge and Skill Requirements of OD Practitioners
[Table 3.1]PART 1 Overview of Organization Development
Based on the data in Table 3.1 and the other studies available, all OD practitioners
should have the following basic skills and knowledge to be effective.
Intrapersonal Skills or “Self-Management” Competence. Despite the growing knowl￾edge base and sophistication of the field, organization development is still a human 
craft. As the primary instrument of diagnosis and change, practitioners often must 
process complex, ambiguous information and make informed judgments about its rel￾evance to organizational issues.
The core competency of analysis and diagnosis listed in Table 3.1 includes the ability
to inquire into one’s self, and as noted above, it remains one of the cornerstone skills 
in OD.10 Practitioners must have the personal centering to know their own values,
feelings, and purposes as well as the integrity to behave responsibly in a helping 
relationship with others. Bob Tannenbaum, one of the founders of OD, argued that 
self-knowledge is the most central ingredient in OD practice and suggested that prac￾titioners are becoming too enamored with skills and techniques.11 There are data to 
support his view. A study of 416 OD practitioners found that 47% agreed with the 
statement, “Many of the new entrants into the field have little understanding of or 
appreciation for the history or values underlying the field.”12 Because OD is a highly 
uncertain process requiring constant adjustment and innovation, practitioners must 
have active learning skills and a reasonable balance between their rational and emo￾tional sides. Finally, OD practice can be highly stressful and can lead to early burnout, 
so practitioners need to know how to manage their own stress.
Interpersonal Skills. Practitioners must create and maintain effective relationships with 
individuals and groups within the organization and help them gain the competence 
necessary to solve their own problems. Table 3.1 identifies group dynamics, comparative 
cultural perspectives, and business functions as foundation knowledge, and managing 
the consulting process and facilitation as core skills. All of these interpersonal competen￾cies promote effective helping relationships. Such relationships start with a grasp of the 
organization’s perspective and require listening to members’ perceptions and feelings to 
understand how they see themselves and the organization. This understanding provides 
a starting point for joint diagnosis and problem solving. Practitioners must establish trust 
and rapport with organization members so that they can share pertinent information 
and work effectively together. This requires being able to converse in members’ own 
language and to give and receive feedback about how the relationship is progressing.
To help members learn new skills and behaviors, practitioners must serve as role mod￾els of what is expected. They must act in ways that are credible to organization members 
and provide them with the counseling and coaching necessary to develop and change. 
Because the helping relationship is jointly determined, practitioners need to be able to 
negotiate an acceptable role and to manage changing expectations and demands.
General Consultation Skills. Table 3.1 identifies the ability to manage the consult￾ing process and the ability to design interventions as core competencies that all OD 
practitioners should possess. OD starts with diagnosing an organization or department 
to understand its current functioning and to discover areas for further development. 
OD practitioners need to know how to carry out an effective diagnosis, at least at a 
rudimentary level. They should know how to engage organization members in diagnosis,
how to help them ask the right questions, and how to collect and analyze information. 
A manager, for example, should be able to work with subordinates to determine jointly 
the organization’s or department’s strengths or problems. The manager should know 
basic diagnostic questions (see Chapters 5 and 6), some methods for gathering informa￾tion, such as interviews or surveys, and some techniques for analyzing it, such as force￾field analysis or statistical means and distributions (see Chapters 7 and 8).
In addition to diagnosis, OD practitioners should know how to design and 
execute an intervention. They need to be able to define an action plan and to gain 
52CHAPTER 3 The Organization Development Practitioner 53
commitment to the program. They also need to know how to tailor the intervention 
to the situation, using information about how the change is progressing to guide 
implementation (see Chapter 11). For example, managers should be able to develop 
action steps for an intervention with subordinates. They should be able to gain their 
commitment to the program (usually through participation), sit down with them and 
assess how it is progressing, and make modifications if necessary.
Organization Development Theory. The last basic tool OD practitioners should have 
is a general knowledge of organization development, such as is presented in this 
book. They should have some appreciation for planned change, the action research 
model, and the positive approaches to managing change. They should be familiar with 
the range of available interventions and the need for evaluating change programs. 
Perhaps most important is that OD practitioners should understand their own role in 
the emerging field of organization development, whether it is as an OD professional, a 
manager, or a specialist in a related area.
THE PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT 
PRACTITIONER
Most of the literature about OD practitioners has focused on people specializing in 
OD as a profession. In this section, we discuss the role and typical career paths of OD 
professionals.
Role of Organization Development Professionals
Position Organization development professionals have positions that are either internal 
or external to the organization. Internal consultants are members of the organization and 
may be located in the human resources department or report directly to a line manager. 
They may perform the OD role exclusively, or they may combine it with other tasks, 
such as compensation practices, training, or employee relations.13 Many large organiza￾tions, such as Boeing, Raytheon, Disney, Microsoft, Philip Morris, Procter & Gamble, 
Weyerhaeuser, Kimberly Clark, and Citigroup, have created specialized OD consulting 
groups. These internal consultants typically have a variety of clients within the organiza￾tion, serving both line and staff departments.
External consultants are not members of the client organization; they typically work 
for a consulting firm, a university, or themselves. Organizations generally hire external 
consultants to provide a particular expertise that is unavailable internally, to bring a 
different and potentially more objective perspective into the organization development 
process, or to signal shifts in power.14 Table 3.2 describes the differences between these 
two roles at each stage of the action research process.15
During the entry process, internal consultants have clear advantages. They have 
ready access to and relationships with clients, know the language of the organization, 
and have insights about the root cause of many of its problems. This allows internal 
consultants to save time in identifying the organization’s culture, informal practices, 
and sources of power. They have access to a variety of information, including rumors, 
company reports, and direct observations. In addition, entry is more efficient and 
congenial, and their pay is not at risk. External consultants, however, have the advan￾tage of being able to select the clients they want to work with according to their own 
criteria. The contracting phase is less formal for internal consultants and there is less 
worry about expenses, but there is less choice about whether to complete the assign￾ment. Both types of consultants must address issues of confidentiality, risk project ter￾mination (and other negative consequences) by the client, and fill a third-party role.
During the diagnosis process, internal consultants already know most organization 
members and enjoy a basic level of rapport and trust. But external consultants often 
have higher status than internal consultants, which allows them to probe difficult PART 1 Overview of Organization Development

The Differences Between External and Internal Consulting

issues and assess the organization more objectively. In the intervention phase, both 
types of consultants must rely on valid information, free and informed choice, and 
internal commitment for their success.16 However, an internal consultant’s strong ties 
to the organization may make him or her overly cautious, particularly when powerful 
others can affect a career. Internal consultants also may lack certain skills and experi￾ence in facilitating organizational change. Insiders may have some small advantages in 
54CHAPTER 3 The Organization Development Practitioner 55
being able to move around the system and cross key organizational boundaries. Finally, 
the measures of success and reward differ from those of the external practitioner in the 
evaluation process.
A promising approach to having the advantages of both internal and external OD 
consultants is to include them both as members of an internal–external consulting 
team.17 External consultants can combine their special expertise and objectivity with 
the inside knowledge and acceptance of internal consultants. The two parties can use 
complementary consulting skills while sharing the workload and possibly accomplish￾ing more than either would by operating alone. Internal consultants, for example, can 
provide almost continuous contact with the client, and their external counterparts 
can provide specialized services periodically, such as two or three days each month. 
External consultants also can help train their organization partners, thus transferring 
OD skills and knowledge to the organization.
Although little has been written on internal–external consulting teams, studies 
suggest that the effectiveness of such teams depends on members developing strong, 
supportive, collegial relationships. They need to take time to develop the consulting 
team, confronting individual differences and establishing appropriate roles and rela￾tionships. Members need to provide each other with continuous feedback and also 
make a commitment to learn from each other. In the absence of these team-building 
and learning activities, internal–external consulting teams can be more troublesome 
and less effective than either internal or external consultants working alone.
Application 3.1 provides a personal, first-person account of the internal and external 
consulting positions as well as interactions between them.18
Marginality A promising line of research on the professional OD role centers on 
the issue of marginality.19 The marginal person is one who successfully straddles the 
boundary between two or more groups with differing goals, value systems, and behav￾ior patterns. Whereas in the past, the marginal role always was seen as dysfunctional, 
marginality now is seen in a more positive light. There are many examples of marginal 
roles in organizations: the salesperson, the buyer, the first-line supervisor, the integra￾tor, and the project manager.
Evidence is mounting that some people are better at taking marginal roles than 
are others. Those who are good at it seem to have personal qualities of low dogma￾tism, neutrality, open-mindedness, objectivity, flexibility, and adaptable information￾processing ability. Rather than being upset by conflict, ambiguity, and stress, they thrive 
on it. Individuals with marginal orientations are more likely than others to develop 
integrative decisions that bring together and reconcile viewpoints among opposing 
organizational groups and are more likely to remain neutral in controversial situations. 
Thus, research suggests that the marginal role can have positive effects when it is filled 
by a person with a marginal orientation. Such a person can be more objective and bet￾ter able to perform successfully in linking, integrative, or conflict-laden roles.20
A study of 89 external OD practitioners and 246 internal ones (response rates of 
59% and 54%, respectively) showed that external professionals were more comfort￾able with the marginal role than were internal professionals. Internal consultants with 
more years of experience were more marginally oriented than were those with less 
experience.21 These findings, combined with other research on marginal roles, suggest 
the importance of maintaining the OD practitioner’s marginality, with its flexibility, 
independence, and boundary-spanning characteristics.
Emotional Demands The OD practitioner role is emotionally demanding. Research 
and practice support the importance of understanding emotions and their impact on the 
practitioner’s effectiveness.22 The research on emotional intelligence in organizations 
suggests a set of abilities that can aid OD practitioners in conducting successful change 
efforts. Emotional intelligence refers to the ability to recognize and express emotions The Internal Consultant’s View
I am an agent of change. I am also a member of 
this organization. I was hired for my OD skills, 
but also for the fact that I was seen as a “cultural 
fit.” Sometimes I struggle between my dual roles 
of “team member” and “free radical.” After all, it 
is my job to disrupt the status quo around here, 
helping leaders to find ways to make the organiza￾tion more effective.
I have the great advantage of knowing and under￾standing how my organization works—its pro￾cesses, policies, norms, and areas of resistance. I 
can usually anticipate how difficult a given change 
will be for members of the organization, and where 
the resistance will come from. Because I believe in 
the mission of my organization, I am able to cope 
with the inevitable challenges of the change pro￾cess. Still, I am frequently a magnet for resistance 
and a receptacle of institutional anxiety. While 
I understand how people can be frustrated and 
frightened by change, it can still be difficult for me 
to bear the disruption I help to create.
To keep myself sharp and healthy, I breathe, run, 
meditate, and read. I take every learning oppor￾tunity that comes my way, and work diligently to 
create and maintain a network of colleagues who 
can support me through the rough patches. I find 
that my best support comes not from friends, but 
from people who know and understand the hard 
work of planned change.
As an internal consultant, I have exposure to 
many of the same people over time—executives, 
managers, and employees get to know who I am 
and what I do. I get to know who they are and 
what they do. I have the opportunity to lever￾age my executive relationships from project to 
project; over time the executives here have come 
to understand my work and trust my skills as a 
consultant. This understanding and trust saves us 
time and energy each time we work together. Of 
course, I realize that if I fail one of my executive 
clients, my life in this organization could become 
less pleasant. That can stress me out when I’m 
working on a messy or unpopular project. After 
all, my performance review is affected by client 
feedback, and my compensation is tied to people’s 
perceptions of my performance. This can make it 
difficult to press forward with risky interventions. 
I am proud of my reputation around here—proud 
of the fact that I have built solid relationships at 
the executive level, that managers respect my 
work, and that employees value having me in the 
organization. Still, I am ever aware that I must 
walk the fine line between “respected insider” and 
“paid agitator.”
Sometimes I’m lonely—often I’m the only OD per￾son working in an organization; sometimes there 
are two or more of us, but we’re always spread 
so thin that connecting is difficult and truly sup￾porting one another is virtually impossible. I may 
work with other staff people—HR for instance—
but they don’t always understand my role and 
can’t really relate to my challenges. Sometimes 
they can be resentful of my relationship with the 
client, which makes me feel alienated. I enjoy my 
client groups, but I must be careful not to over￾identify with them; the greatest value I bring to 
my clients is a clean “outsider” perspective. I can’t 
do hard change efforts with them if I’m worried 
about them liking me. Being a lone ranger can be 
thrilling, but being an outsider can get tiring.
Occasionally I bring in an external consultant to 
work on a specific project or problem in my organi￾zation. This can be both challenging and rewarding 
for me. It is time consuming to bring an outsider up 
to speed on my organization’s business, processes, 
and politics. I seek external consultants who will 
fit in our culture, while helping us see our issues 
more clearly and realistically. I enjoy the process 
of partnering with people who have exposure to 
other organizations, who possess different skills 
and strengths from mine, and who understand the 
inherent discomfort of the change process. Still, 
this can be risky, because my reputation will be 
affected by this person’s work and the outcomes 
we are able to achieve. When it works best, my 
partnership with the external consultant leads to 
improved effectiveness for my organization, while 
affording me a valued learning opportunity and 
professional support.
Personal Views of the Internal and External 
Consulting Positions
application 3.1CHAPTER 3 The Organization Development Practitioner 57
The best thing to me about being an internal 
consultant is knowing that I am contributing to 
the mission of my organization with every client I 
work with, every day.
The External Consultant’s View
I am an agent of change. I work for many different 
organizations of varying sizes with different mis￾sions and goals. I spend most of my time helping 
managers, HR people, and internal consultants 
initiate and manage change—both planned and 
unplanned. I enjoy the variety in my work and 
the learning that comes from seeing the way 
change happens in different organizations and 
contexts.
But it is hard being an “outsider.” I must work 
quickly to understand each new organization 
I work with. As an outsider it can be frustrating 
to navigate the inner workings of the organiza￾tion—its politics, pecking order, and culture—and 
to root out what’s important and what’s not. In 
my role, I’m not around while the unglamorous, 
time-consuming, and important work of nurturing 
a change along is being done. So, although 
I experience the risk and excitement of some part 
of the change, I do not always get to experience 
the whole change process from start to finish. 
I rarely get to see the project bear fruit and the 
organization become more effective as a result of 
the work I’ve done. Sometimes the process feels 
incomplete, and I almost always wonder how 
much I’ve actually helped.
Being an external consultant is both rewarding 
and risky work. On the one hand, I am seen as 
an expert. I am appreciated for my assistance, 
applauded for my knowledge, and liked for my 
interpersonal skills. I have the benefit of many 
revenue sources, so I’m never overly dependent 
on one client. I am often rewarded handsomely for 
my time and effort, although most people mistake 
“daily fee” as actual income and forget about self￾employment taxes and the health benefits I have 
to pay myself. The other truth is that I am always 
at risk—economic crises, budget cuts, personnel 
changes, executive shake ups, organizational poli￾tics, and the occasional hostile HR person are but a 
few of the land mines an external consultant faces. 
For the most part, I feel pleased and rewarded for 
my work as a consultant. But I always know that 
my situation is dependent on my client’s situation, 
and I can never afford to get too comfortable.
When I’m hired by an executive or manager, 
sometimes the HR person or internal consultant 
may be resistant, feeling threatened by my 
presence. When this happens, I have to find ways 
to address their concern, partner with them, and 
still do the important work of organizational 
change. Sometimes just creating space for the 
conversation by using simple probes—“You seem 
very concerned about this situation” or “You must 
feel pretty unsupported right now”—help me 
uncover their discomfort so we can move forward. 
Sometimes these relationships are difficult 
throughout the engagement. It’s the downside of 
being brought in as an “expert.”
I am asked by clients to perform a wide variety of 
tasks ranging from content expert to process expert 
to personal coach. Regardless of the request, 
however, I am frequently aware of an unspoken 
need on the part of the client—manager, HR 
person, or internal consultant—to have me sup￾port his or her project, position, or person. When 
the request is to support a project, it is usually 
clear. When the request is to support a position, it 
is less clear but typically surfaces during the course 
of our work together. However, when the request 
is to support the individual personally, the request 
is almost never overt. This is where my self￾as-instrument work serves me best, helping me to 
understand the unspoken—the question behind 
the question. While my goal is always to help my 
client organizations become more effective, I never 
forget that change can happen many different ways 
and at multiple levels of the system. It is my work 
to be aware of opportunities to intervene, and to 
have the skill and courage to do so as an outsider.58 PART 1 Overview of Organization Development
appropriately, to use emotions in thought and decisions, and to regulate emotion in 
one’s self and in others.23 It is, therefore, a different kind of intelligence from problem￾solving ability, engineering aptitude, or the knowledge of concepts. In tandem with 
traditional knowledge and skill, emotional intelligence affects and supplements ratio￾nal thought; emotions help prioritize thinking by directing attention to important 
information not addressed in models and theories. In that sense, some researchers 
argue that emotional intelligence is as important as cognitive intelligence.24
Reports from OD practitioners support the importance of emotional intelligence in 
practice. From the client’s perspective, OD practitioners must understand emotions 
well enough to relate to and help organization members address resistance, commit￾ment, and ambiguity at each stage of planned change. Despite the predominant focus 
on rationality and efficiency, almost any change process must address important and 
difficult issues that raise emotions such as the fear of failure, rejection, anxiety, and 
anger.25 OD practitioners can provide psychological support, model appropriate emo￾tional expression, reframe client perspectives, and provide resources. OD practitioners 
must also understand their own emotions. Ambiguity, unfamiliarity, or denial of emo￾tions can lead to inaccurate and untimely interventions. For example, a practitioner 
who is uncomfortable with conflict may intervene to defuse an argument between two 
managers because of the discomfort he or she feels, not because the conflict is destruc￾tive. In such a case, the practitioner is acting to address a personal need rather than 
intervening to improve the system’s effectiveness.
Evidence suggests that emotional intelligence increases with age and experience.26
Research also supports the conclusion that competence with emotions can be devel￾oped through personal growth processes such as sensitivity training, counseling, and 
therapy. It seems reasonable to suggest that professional OD practitioners dedicate 
themselves to a long-term regimen of development that includes acquiring both cogni￾tive learning and emotional intelligence.
Use of Knowledge and Experience The professional OD role has been described in 
terms of a continuum ranging from client centered (using the client’s knowledge and 
experience) to consultant centered (using the consultant’s knowledge and experience), 
as shown in Figure 3.1. Traditionally, OD consultants have worked at the client- centered
end of the continuum. Organization development professionals, relying mainly on pro￾cess consultation and team building (see Chapter 12), have been expected to remain 
neutral, refusing to offer expert advice on organizational problems. Rather than con￾tracting to solve specific problems, the consultant has tended to work with organization 
members to identify problems and potential solutions, to help them study what they are 
doing now and consider alternative behaviors and solutions, and to help them discover 
whether, in fact, the consultant and they can learn to do things better. In doing that, the 
OD professional has generally listened and reflected upon members’ perceptions and 
ideas and helped clarify and interpret their communications and behaviors.
The recent proliferation of OD interventions in the structural, human resource man￾agement, and strategy areas has expanded that limited definition of the professional OD 
role to include the consultant-centered end of the continuum. In many of the newer 
approaches, the consultant may have to take on a modified role of expert, with the 
consent and collaboration of organization members. For example, managers trying to 
bring about a major structural redesign (see Chapter 14) may not have the appropri￾ate knowledge and expertise to create and manage the change and need the help of an 
OD practitioner with experience in this area. The consultant’s role might be to present 
the basic concepts and ideas and then to struggle jointly with the managers to select an 
approach that might be useful to the organization and to decide how it might best be 
implemented. In this situation, the OD professional recommends or prescribes particular 
changes and is active in planning how to implement them. This expertise, however, is 
always shared rather than imposed.CHAPTER 3 The Organization Development Practitioner 59
With the development of new and varied intervention approaches, the OD profes￾sional’s role needs to be seen as falling along the entire continuum from client cen￾tered to consultant centered. At times, the consultant will rely mainly on organization 
members’ knowledge and experiences to identify and solve problems. At other times, 
it will be more appropriate to take on the role of an expert, withdrawing from that role 
as managers gain more knowledge and experience.
Careers of Organization Development Professionals
In contrast to such long-standing occupations as medicine and law, organization devel￾opment is an emerging practice, still developing the characteristics of an established 
profession: a common body of knowledge, educational requirements, a recognized 
code of ethics, and rules and methods for governing conduct. People enter professional 
OD careers from various educational and work backgrounds. Because they do not have 
to follow an established career path, they have some choice about when to enter or 
leave an OD career and whether to be an internal or external consultant.27
Despite the looseness or flexibility of the field, most professionals have had specific 
training in OD. That training can include relatively short courses (one day to two weeks), 
programs, and workshops conducted within organizations or at outside institutions 
(such as NTL, USC, University Associates, Columbia University, the University of 
Michigan, Stanford University, and UCLA). OD training also can be more formal and 
lengthy, including master’s programs (for example, at Pepperdine University, American 
University, Benedictine University, Bowling Green State University, Case Western 
Reserve University, Loyola University, and the Fielding Institute) and doctoral training 
(for example, at Benedictine University, Pepperdine University, Case Western Reserve 
University, Columbia University Teachers College, USC, the Fielding Institute, George 
Washington University, UCLA, and Stanford University).
As might be expected, career choices widen as people gain training and experience 
in OD. Those with rudimentary training tend to be internal consultants, often taking on 
OD roles as temporary assignments on the way to higher managerial or staff positions.

Use of Consultant’s Versus Client’s Knowledge and Experience
[Figure 3.1]60 PART 1 Overview of Organization Development
Holders of master’s degrees generally are evenly split between internal and external con￾sultants. Those with doctorates may join a university faculty and do consulting part-time, 
join a consulting firm, or seek a position as a relatively high-level internal consultant.
External consultants tend to be older, to have more managerial experience, and to spend 
more of their time in OD than do internal practitioners. However, one study suggested 
there were no differences between internal and external consultants in pay or years of 
consulting experience.28 Perhaps the most common career path is to begin as an internal 
consultant, gain experience and visibility through successful interventions or publishing, 
and then become an external consultant. A field study found that internal consultants 
acquired greater competence by working with external consultants who purposely helped 
develop them. This development took place through a tutorial arrangement of joint diag￾nosis and intervention in the organization, which gave the internal consultants a chance 
to observe and learn from the model furnished by the external consultants.29
There is increasing evidence that an OD career can be stressful, sometimes leading to 
burnout.30 Burnout comes from taking on too many jobs, becoming overcommitted, and 
generally working too hard. The number-one complaint of OD practitioners is constant 
traveling.31 OD work often requires six-day work weeks, with some days running as long 
as 15 hours. Consultants may spend a week working with one organization or department 
and then spend the weekend preparing for the next client. They may spend 50–75% of 
their time on the road, living in planes, cars, hotels, meetings, and restaurants. Indeed, one 
practitioner has suggested that the majority of OD consultants would repeat the phrase 
“quality of work life for consultants” this way: “Quality of work life? For consultants?”32
OD professionals increasingly are taking steps to cope with burnout. They may shift 
jobs, moving from external to internal roles to gain more predictable hours or avoid 
travel. They may learn to pace themselves better and to avoid taking on too much work. 
Many are engaging in fitness and health programs and are using stress-management 
techniques, such as those described in Chapter 19.
PROFESSIONAL VALUES
Values have played an important role in organization development from its begin￾ning. Traditionally, OD professionals have promoted a set of values under a humanistic 
framework, including a concern for inquiry and science, democracy, and being helpful.33
They have sought to build trust and collaboration; to create an open, problem-solving 
climate; and to increase the self-control of organization members. More recently, OD 
practitioners have extended those humanistic values to include a concern for improving
organizational effectiveness (for example, to increase productivity or to reduce turn￾over) and performance (for example, to increase profitability). They have shown an 
increasing desire to optimize both human benefits and production objectives.34
The joint values of humanizing organizations and improving their effectiveness have 
received widespread support in the OD profession as well as increasing encouragement 
from managers, employees, labor leaders, and government officials. Indeed, it would be 
difficult not to support those joint concerns. But in practice, OD professionals face serious 
challenges in simultaneously pursuing greater humanism and organizational effective￾ness.35 More practitioners are experiencing situations in which there is conflict between 
employees’ needs for greater meaning and the organization’s need for more effective and 
efficient use of its resources. For example, expensive capital equipment may run most 
efficiently if it is highly programmed and routinized, but people may not derive satisfac￾tion from working with such technology. Should efficiency be maximized at the expense 
of people’s satisfaction? Can technology be changed to make it more humanly satisfying 
while remaining efficient? What compromises are possible? How do these trade-offs shift 
when they are applied in different social cultures? These are the value dilemmas often 
faced when we try to optimize both human benefits and organizational effectiveness.CHAPTER 3 The Organization Development Practitioner 61
In addition to value issues within organizations, OD practitioners are dealing more and 
more with value conflicts with powerful outside groups. Organizations are open systems 
and exist within increasingly turbulent environments. For example, hospitals are fac￾ing complex and changing task environments. This has led to a proliferation of external 
stakeholders with interests in the organization’s functioning, including patients, suppliers, 
medical groups, insurance companies, employers, the government, stockholders, unions, 
the press, and various interest groups. Those external groups often have different and com￾peting values for judging the organization’s effectiveness. For example, stockholders may 
judge the firm in terms of earnings per share, the government in terms of compliance with 
equal employment opportunity legislation, patients in terms of quality of care, and ecology 
groups in terms of hazardous waste disposal. Because organizations must rely on these 
external groups for resources and legitimacy, they cannot simply ignore these competing 
values. They must somehow respond to them and try to reconcile the different interests.
Recent attempts to help firms manage external relationships suggest the need for 
new interventions and competence in OD.36 Practitioners must have not only social 
skills like those proposed in Table 3.1 but also political skills. They must understand the 
distribution of power, conflicts of interest, and value dilemmas inherent in managing 
external relationships, and be able to manage their own role and values with respect 
to those dynamics. Research suggests this is especially true in interorganizational and 
international applications of OD.37 Interventions promoting collaboration and sys￾tem maintenance may be ineffective in this larger arena, especially when there are 
power and dominance relationships among organizations and competition for scarce 
resources. Under those conditions, OD practitioners may need more power-oriented 
interventions, such as bargaining, coalition forming, and pressure tactics.
For example, organizations are coming under increasing pressure to align their prac￾tices with ecologically sound design principles. Popular and scientific concerns over global 
warming, toxic waste, natural resource depletion, and sustainability each have formida￾ble nonprofit groups, citizen action committees, and professional lobbyists representing 
them. In addition, an increasing number of consulting firms are marketing products and 
processes to help organizations achieve a more sustainable relationship with the environ￾ment. In response, firms have “gone green,” announced contributions to environmental 
funds, and created alliances with environmental nongovernmental groups. Many argue 
that these changes are more window dressing than real, more political than operational, 
and more public relations than substantive. To be fair, a number of organizations have 
made important changes in their philosophies, strategies, and resource allocations. As 
a result, the relationships between organizations and environmental groups range from 
benign to hostile to collaborative. People practicing OD in such settings may need to 
help organizations manage these relationships and implement strategies to manage their 
constituencies effectively. That effort will require political skills and greater attention to 
how the OD practitioner’s own values fit with those of the organization.
PROFESSIONAL ETHICS
Ethical issues in OD are concerned with how practitioners perform their helping rela￾tionship with organization members. Inherent in any helping relationship is the poten￾tial for misconduct and client abuse. OD practitioners can let personal values stand in 
the way of good practice or use the power inherent in their professional role to abuse 
(often unintentionally) organization members.
Ethical Guidelines
To its credit, the field of OD always has shown concern for the ethical conduct of its 
practitioners. There have been several articles and symposia about ethics in OD.38
In addition, statements of ethics governing OD practice have been sponsored by the 62 PART 1 Overview of Organization Development
Organization Development Institute (http://members.aol.com/ODInst/ethics.htm), the 
American Society for Training & Development (http://www.astd.org), and a consor￾tium of professional associations in OD. The consortium has sponsored an ethical code 
derived from a large-scale project conducted at the Center for the Study of Ethics in 
the Professions at the Illinois Institute of Technology. The project’s purposes included 
preparing critical incidents describing ethical dilemmas and using that material for pre￾professional and continuing education in OD, providing an empirical basis for a state￾ment of values and ethics for OD professionals, and initiating a process for making the 
ethics of OD practice explicit on a continuing basis.39 The ethical guidelines from that 
project appear in the appendix to this chapter.
Ethical Dilemmas
Although adherence to statements of ethics helps prevent the occurrence of ethical 
problems, OD practitioners still encounter ethical dilemmas. Figure 3.2 is a process 
model that explains how ethical dilemmas can occur in OD. The antecedent condi￾tions include an OD practitioner and a client system with different goals, values, needs, 
skills, and abilities. The entry and contracting phase of planned change is intended to 
address and clarify these differences. As a practical matter, however, it is unreason￾able to assume that all of the differences will be identified and resolved. Under such 
circumstances, the subsequent intervention process or role episode is almost certainly 
subject to role conflict and role ambiguity. Neither the client nor the OD practitioner is 
clear about respective responsibilities. Each party is pursuing different goals, and each 
is using different skills and values to achieve those goals. The role conflict and ambi￾guity may produce five types of ethical dilemmas: misrepresentation, misuse of data, 
coercion, value and goal conflict, and technical ineptness.
Misrepresentation Misrepresentation occurs when OD practitioners claim that an 
intervention will produce results that are unreasonable for the change program or 
the situation. The client can contribute to the problem by portraying inaccurate goals 
and needs. In either case, one or both parties are operating under false pretenses and 
an ethical dilemma exists. For example, in an infamous case called “The Undercover 
Change Agent,” an attempt was made to use sensitivity training in an organization 
whose top management did not understand it and was not ready for it. The OD consul￾tant sold this interpersonally intense intervention as the activity that would solve the 
problems facing the organization. After the president of the firm made a surprise visit to 
the site where the training was being held, the consultant was fired because the nature 
and style of the sensitivity training was in direct contradiction to the president’s concepts 
about leadership.40 Misrepresentation is likely to occur in the entering and contracting 
phases of planned change when the initial consulting relationship is being established. 
To prevent misrepresentation, OD practitioners need to gain clarity about the goals of 
the change effort, and to explore openly with the client its expected effects, its relevance 
to the client system, and the practitioner’s competence in executing the intervention.
Misuse of Data Misuse of data occurs when information gathered during the OD pro￾cess is used punitively. Large amounts of information are invariably obtained during 
the entry and diagnostic phases of OD. Although most OD practitioners value openness 
and trust, it is important that they be aware of how such data are going to be used. It 
is a human tendency to use data to enhance a power position. Openness is one thing, 
but leaking inappropriate information can be harmful to individuals and to the organi￾zation. It is easy for a consultant, under the guise of obtaining information, to gather 
data about whether a particular manager is good or bad. When, how, or if this infor￾mation can be used is an ethical dilemma not easily resolved. To minimize misuse of 
data, practitioners should reach agreement up front with organization members about CHAPTER 3 The Organization Development Practitioner 63
how data collected during the change process will be used. This agreement should be 
reviewed periodically in light of changing circumstances.
Coercion Coercion occurs when organization members are forced to participate in an 
OD intervention. People should have the freedom to choose whether to participate 
in a change program if they are to gain self-reliance to solve their own problems. In 
team building, for example, team members should have the option of deciding not 
to become involved in the intervention. Management should not decide unilaterally 
that team building is good for members. However, freedom to make a choice requires 
knowledge about OD. Many organization members have little information about 
OD interventions, what they involve, and the nature and consequences of becoming 
involved with them. This makes it imperative for OD practitioners to educate clients 
about interventions before choices are made for implementing them.
Coercion also can pose ethical dilemmas for the helping relationship between OD 
practitioners and organization members. Inherent in any helping relationship are pos￾sibilities for excessive manipulation and dependency, two facets of coercion. Kelman 
pointed out that behavior change “inevitably involves some degree of manipulation 
and control, and at least an implicit imposition of the change agent’s values on the cli￾ent or the person he [or she] is influencing.”41 This places the practitioner on two horns 
of a dilemma: (1) Any attempt to change is in itself a change and thereby a manipula￾tion, no matter how slight, and (2) there exists no formula or method to structure a 
change situation so that such manipulation can be totally avoided. To attack the first 
aspect of the dilemma, Kelman stressed freedom of choice, seeing any action that limits 
freedom of choice as being ethically ambiguous or worse. To address the second aspect, 
Kelman argued that the OD practitioner must remain keenly aware of her or his own 
value system and alert to the possibility that those values are being imposed on a client. 
In other words, an effective way to resolve this dilemma is to make the change effort as 
open as possible, with the free consent and knowledge of the individuals involved.

A Role Episodic Model of Ethical Dilemmas
[Figure 3.2]64 PART 1 Overview of Organization Development
The second facet of coercion that can pose ethical dilemmas for the helping relation￾ship involves dependency. Helping relationships invariably create dependency between 
those who need help and those who provide it.42 A major goal in OD is to lessen clients’ 
dependency on consultants by helping clients gain the knowledge and skills to address 
organizational problems and manage change themselves. In some cases, however, 
achieving independence from OD practitioners can result in clients being either coun￾terdependent or overdependent, especially in the early stages of the relationship. To 
resolve dependency issues, consultants can openly and explicitly discuss with the cli￾ent how to handle the dependency problem, especially what the client and consultant 
expect of one another. Another approach is to focus on problem finding. Usually, the 
client is looking for a solution to a perceived problem. The consultant can redirect the 
energy to improved joint diagnosis so that both are working on problem identification 
and problem solving. Such action moves the energy of the client away from depen￾dency. Finally, dependency can be reduced by changing the client’s expectation from 
being helped or controlled by the practitioner to a greater focus on the need to manage 
the problem. Such a refocusing can reinforce the understanding that the consultant is 
working for the client and offering assistance that is at the client’s discretion.
Value and Goal Conflict This ethical conflict occurs when the purpose of the change 
effort is not clear or when the client and the practitioner disagree over how to achieve 
the goals. The important practical issue for OD consultants is whether it is justifiable to 
withhold services unilaterally from an organization that does not agree with their values 
or methods. OD pioneer Gordon Lippitt suggested that the real question is the following: 
Assuming that some kind of change is going to occur anyway, doesn’t the consultant 
have a responsibility to try to guide the change in the most constructive fashion pos￾sible?43 That question may be of greater importance and relevance to an internal consul￾tant or to a consultant who already has an ongoing relationship with the client.
Argyris takes an even stronger stand, maintaining that the responsibilities of pro￾fessional OD practitioners to clients are comparable to those of lawyers or physicians, 
who, in principle, may not refuse to perform their services. He suggests that the very 
least the consultant can do is to provide “first aid” to the organization, as long as the 
assistance does not compromise the consultant’s values. Argyris suggests that if the Ku 
Klux Klan asked for assistance and the consultant could at least determine whether 
the KKK was genuinely interested in assessing itself and willing to commit itself to 
all that a valid assessment would entail concerning both itself and other groups, 
the consultant should be willing to help. If later the Klan’s objectives proved to be 
less than honestly stated, the consultant would be free to withdraw without being 
compromised.44
Technical Ineptness This final ethical dilemma occurs when OD practitioners try to 
implement interventions for which they are not skilled or when the client attempts a 
change for which it is not ready. Critical to the success of any OD program is the selec￾tion of an appropriate intervention, which depends, in turn, on careful diagnosis of 
the organization. Selecting an intervention is closely related to the practitioner’s own 
values, skills, and abilities. In solving organizational problems, many OD consultants 
emphasize a favorite intervention or technique, such as team building, total quality 
management, or self-managed teams. They let their own values and beliefs dictate the 
change method.45 Technical ineptness dilemmas also can occur when interventions do 
not align with the ability of the organization to implement them. Again, careful diag￾nosis can reveal the extent to which the organization is ready to make a change and 
possesses the skills and knowledge to implement it.
Application 3.2 presents an ethical dilemma that arises frequently in OD consulting.46
What points in the process represent practical opportunities to intervene? Do you agree 
with Todd’s resolution to the problem? What other options did she have?Kindred Todd and the Ethics of OD
Kindred Todd had just finished her master’s degree 
in organization development and had landed her 
first consulting position with a small consult￾ing company in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. The 
president, Larry Stepchuck, convinced Todd that 
his growing organization offered her a great oppor￾tunity to learn the business. He had a large number 
of contacts, an impressive executive career, and 
several years of consulting experience behind him.
In fact, the firm was growing; adding new clients 
and projects as fast as its president could hire 
consultants. A few weeks after Todd was hired, 
Stepchuck assigned her to a new client, a small 
oil and gas company. “I’ve met with the client for 
several hours,” he told her. “They are an impor￾tant and potentially large opportunity for our 
firm. They’re looking to us to help them address 
some long-range planning issues. From the way 
they talk, they could also use some continuous 
quality improvement work as well.”
As Todd prepared for her initial meeting with the 
client, she reviewed financial data from the firm’s 
annual report, examined trends in the client’s 
industry, and thought about the issues that young 
firms face. Stepchuck indicated that Todd would 
first meet with the president of the firm to discuss 
initial issues and next steps.
When Todd walked into the president’s office, she 
was greeted by the firm’s entire senior manage￾ment team. Team members expressed eagerness 
to get to work on the important issues of how to 
improve the organization’s key business processes. 
They believed that an expert in continuous qual￾ity improvement (CQI), such as Todd, was exactly 
the kind of help they needed to increase efficiency 
and cut costs in the core business. Members began 
to ask direct questions about technical details 
of CQI, the likely timeframe within which they 
might expect results, how to map key processes, 
and how to form quality improvement teams to 
identify and implement process improvements.
Todd was stunned and overwhelmed. Nothing that 
Stepchuck said about the issues facing this com￾pany was being discussed and, worse, it was clear 
that he had sold her to the client as an “expert” in 
CQI. Her immediate response was to suggest that 
all of their questions were good ones, but that 
they needed to be answered in the context of the 
long-range goals and strategies of the firm. Todd 
proposed that the best way to begin was for team 
members to provide her with some history about 
the organization. In doing so, she was able to 
avert disaster and embarrassment for herself and 
her company, and to appear to be doing all the 
things necessary to begin a CQI project. The meet￾ing ended with Todd and the management team 
agreeing to meet again the following week.
Immediately the next day, Todd sought out the 
president of her firm. She reported on the results 
of the meeting and her surprise at being sold to 
this client as an expert on CQI. Todd suggested that 
her own competencies did not fit the needs of the 
client and requested that another consultant—one 
with expertise in CQI—be assigned to the project.
Larry Stepchuck responded to Todd’s concerns: “I’ve 
known these people for over ten years. They don’t 
know exactly what they need. CQI is an important 
buzzword. It’s the flavor of the month and if that’s 
what they want, that’s what we’ll give them.” He also 
told her that there were no other consultants avail￾able for this project. “Besides,” he said, “the president 
of the client firm just called to say how much he 
enjoyed meeting with you and was looking forward 
to getting started on the project right away.”
Kindred Todd felt that Stepchuck’s response to her 
concerns included a strong, inferred ultimatum: If 
you want to stay with this company, you had bet￾ter take this job. “I knew I had to sink or swim with 
this job and this client,” she later reported.
As Todd reflected on her options, she pondered 
the following questions:
• How can I be honest with this client and thus 
not jeopardize my values of openness and 
honesty?
• How can I be helpful to this client?
• How much do I know about quality improve￾ment processes?
• How do I satisfy the requirements of my 
employer?
• What obligations do I have?
• Who’s going to know if I do or don’t have the 
credentials to perform this work?
• What if I fail?
application 3.266 PART 1 Overview of Organization Development
After thinking about those issues, Todd summarized 
her position in terms of three dilemmas: a dilemma 
of self (who is Kindred Todd?), a dilemma of compe￾tence (what can I do?), and a dilemma of confidence 
(do I like who I work for?). Based on the issues, Todd 
made the following tactical decisions. She spent two 
days at the library reading about and studying total 
quality management and CQI. She also contacted 
several of her friends and former classmates who 
had experience with quality improvement efforts. 
Eventually, she contracted with one of them to be 
her “shadow” consultant—to work with her behind 
the scenes on formulating and implementing an 
intervention for the client.
Based on her preparation in the library and the 
discussions with her shadow consultant, Kindred 
Todd was able to facilitate an appropriate and 
effective intervention for the client. Shortly after 
her assignment was completed, she resigned from 
the consulting organization.
SUMMARY
This chapter has examined the role of the organization development practitioner. The 
term OD practitioner applies to three sets of people: individuals specializing in OD as a 
profession, people from related fields who have gained some competence in OD, and 
managers having the OD skills necessary to change and develop their organizations 
or departments. Comprehensive lists enumerate core and advanced skills and knowl￾edge that an effective OD specialist should possess, but a smaller set of basic skills and 
knowledge is applicable for all practitioners at all levels. These include four kinds of 
background: intrapersonal skills, interpersonal skills, general consultation skills, and 
knowledge of OD theory.
The professional OD role can apply to internal consultants who belong to the orga￾nization undergoing change, to external consultants who are members of universities 
and consulting firms or are self-employed, and to members of internal–external con￾sulting teams. The OD practitioner’s role may be described aptly in terms of marginal￾ity and emotional demands. People with a tolerance for marginal roles seem especially 
suited for OD practice because they are able to maintain neutrality and objectivity 
and to develop integrative solutions that reconcile viewpoints among opposing orga￾nizational departments. Similarly, the OD practitioner’s emotional intelligence and 
awareness are keys to implementing the role successfully. Whereas in the past the OD 
practitioner’s role has been described as standing at the client end of the continuum 
from client-centered to consultant-centered functioning, the development of new and 
varied interventions has shifted the role of the OD professional to cover the entire 
range of that continuum.
Although OD is still an emerging field, most practitioners have specific training 
that ranges from short courses and workshops to graduate and doctoral education. No 
single career path exists, but internal consulting is often a stepping-stone to becoming 
an external consultant. Because of the hectic pace of OD practice, specialists should be 
prepared to cope with high levels of stress and the possibility of career burnout.
Values have played a key role in OD, and traditional values promoting trust, col￾laboration, and openness have been supplemented recently with concerns for improving 
organizational effectiveness and productivity. OD specialists may face value dilemmas in 
trying to jointly optimize human benefits and organization performance. They also may CHAPTER 3 The Organization Development Practitioner 67
encounter value conflicts when dealing with powerful external stakeholders, such as the 
government, stockholders, and customers. Dealing with those outside groups may take 
political skills, as well as the more traditional social skills.
Ethical issues in OD involve how practitioners perform their helping role with clients. 
As a profession, OD always has shown a concern for the ethical conduct of its practitio￾ners, and several ethical codes for OD practice have been developed by various profes￾sional associations. Ethical dilemmas in OD arise around misrepresentation, misuse of 
data, coercion, value and goal conflict, and technical ineptness.

APPENDIX
Ethical Guidelines for an Organization Development/Human Systems 
Development (OD/HSD) Professional
Sponsored by the Human Systems Development Consortium (HSDC), a significant 
integrative effort by Bill Gellermann has been under way to develop “A Statement of 
Values and Ethics for Professionals in Organization and Human System Development.” 
HSDC is an informal collection of the leaders of most of the professional associations 
related to the application of the behavioral and social sciences. A series of drafts based 
on extensive contributions, comments, and discussions involving many professionals 
and organizations has led to the following version of this statement.
As an OD/HSD Professional, I commit to supporting and acting in accordance with 
the following guidelines:
I. Responsibility for Professional Development and Competence
A. Accept responsibility for the consequences of my acts and make every effort to 
ensure that my services are properly used.
B. Recognize the limits of my competence, culture, and experience in providing services 
and using techniques; neither seek nor accept assignments outside those limits without 
clear understanding by the client when exploration at the edge of my competence is 
reasonable; refer client to other professionals when appropriate.
C. Strive to attain and maintain a professional level of competence in the field, including
1. broad knowledge of theory and practice in
a. applied behavioral science generally.
b. management, administration, organizational behavior, and system behavior 
specifically.
c. multicultural issues including issues of color and gender.
d. other relevant fields of knowledge and practice.
2. ability to
a. relate effectively with individuals and groups.
b. relate effectively to the dynamics of large, complex systems.
c. provide consultation using theory and methods of the applied behavioral sciences.
d. articulate theory and direct its application, including creation of learning 
experiences for individuals, small and large groups, and for whole systems.
D. Strive continually for self-knowledge and personal growth; be aware that “what is in 
me” (my perceptions of myself in my world) and “what is outside me” (the realities 
that exist apart from me) are not the same; be aware that my values, beliefs, and 
aspirations can both limit and empower me and that they are primary determinants 
of my perceptions, my behavior, and my personal and professional effectiveness.
E. Recognize my own personal needs and desires and deal with them responsibly in 
the performance of my professional roles.
F. Obtain consultation from OD/HSD professionals who are native to and aware of the 
specific cultures within which I work when those cultures are different from my own.
II. Responsibility to Clients and Significant Others
A. Serve the short- and long-term welfare, interests, and development of the cli￾ent system and all its stakeholders; maintain balance in the timing, pace, and 
magnitude of planned change so as to support a mutually beneficial relationship 
between the system and its environment.CHAPTER 3 The Organization Development Practitioner 71
B. Discuss candidly and fully goals, costs, risks, limitations, and anticipated out￾comes of any program or other professional relationship under consideration; 
seek to avoid automatic confirmation of predetermined conclusions, either the 
client’s or my own; seek optimum involvement by client system members in 
every step of the process, including managers and workers’ representatives; fully 
inform client system members about my role, contribution, and strategy in work￾ing with them.
C. Fully inform participants in any activity or procedure as to its sponsorship, nature, 
purpose, implications, and any significant risk associated with it so that they can 
freely choose their participation in any activity initiated by me; acknowledge that 
their choice may be limited with activity initiated by recognized authorities; be par￾ticularly sensitive to implications and risks when I work with people from cultures 
other than my own.
D. Be aware of my own personal values, my values as an OD/HSD professional, the 
values of my native culture, the values of the people with whom I am working, and 
the values of their cultures; involve the client system in making relevant cultural 
differences explicit and exploring the possible implications of any OD/HSD interven￾tion for all the stakeholders involved; be prepared to make explicit my assumptions, 
values, and standards as an OD/HSD professional.
E. Help all stakeholders while developing OD/HSD approaches, programs, and the 
like, if they wish such help; for example, this could include workers’ representatives 
as well as managers in the case of work with a business organization.
F. Work collaboratively with other internal and external consultants serving the same 
client system and resolve conflicts in terms of the balanced best interests of the client 
system and all its stakeholders; make appropriate arrangements with other internal 
and external consultants about how responsibilities will be shared.
G. Encourage and enable my clients to provide for themselves the services I pro￾vide rather than foster continued reliance on me; encourage, foster, and support 
self-education and self-development by individuals, groups, and all other human 
systems.
H. Cease work with a client when it is clear that the client is not benefiting or the 
contract has been completed; do not accept an assignment if its scope is so limited 
that the client will not benefit or it would involve serious conflict with the values 
and ethics outlined in this statement.
I. Avoid conflicts of interest.
1. Fully inform the client of my opinion about serving similar or competing orga￾nizations; be clear with myself, my clients, and other concerned stakeholders 
about my loyalties and responsibilities when conflicts of interest arise; keep 
parties informed of these conflicts; cease work with the client if the conflicts 
cannot be adequately resolved.
2. Seek to act impartially when involved in conflicts between parties in the client 
system; help them resolve their conflicts themselves, without taking sides; if 
necessary to change my role from serving as impartial consultant, do so explic￾itly; cease work with the client, if necessary.
3. Identify and respond to any major differences in professionally relevant values 
or ethics between myself and my clients with the understanding that conditions 
may require ceasing work with the client.
4. Accept differences in the expectations and interests of different stakeholders and 
realize that those differences cannot be reconciled all the time.
J. Seek consultation and feedback from neutral third parties in case of conflict 
between myself and my client.72 PART 1 Overview of Organization Development
K. Define and protect the confidentiality of my client–professional relationships.
1. Make limits of confidentiality clear to clients/participants.
2. Reveal information accepted in confidence only to appropriate or agreed-upon 
recipients or authorities.
3. Use information obtained during professional work in writings, lectures, or other 
public forums only with prior consent or when disguised so that it is impossible 
from my presentations alone to identify the individuals or systems with whom I 
have worked.
4. Make adequate provisions for maintaining confidentiality in the storage and dis￾posal of records; make provisions for responsibly preserving records in the event 
of my retirement or disability.
L. Establish mutual agreement on a contract covering services and remuneration.
1. Ensure a clear understanding of and mutual agreement on the services to be 
performed; do not shift from that agreement without both a clearly defined 
professional rationale for making the shift and the informed consent of the 
clients/participants; withdraw from the agreement if circumstances beyond my 
control prevent proper fulfillment.
2. Ensure mutual understanding and agreement by putting the contract in writ￾ing to the extent feasible, yet recognize that
a. the spirit of professional responsibility encompasses more than the letter of the 
contract.
b. some contracts are necessarily incomplete because complete information is 
not available at the outset.
c. putting the contract in writing may be neither necessary nor desirable.
3. Safeguard the best interests of the client, the profession, and the public by 
making sure that financial arrangements are fair and in keeping with appropri￾ate statutes, regulations, and professional standards.
M. Provide for my own accountability by evaluating and assessing the effects of my work.
1. Make all reasonable efforts to determine if my activities have accomplished the 
agreed-upon goals and have not had other undesirable consequences; seek to undo 
any undesirable consequences, and do not attempt to cover up these situations.
2. Actively solicit and respond with an open mind to feedback regarding my work 
and seek to improve.
3. Develop, publish, and use assessment techniques that promote the welfare and best 
interests of clients/participants; guard against the misuse of assessment results.
N. Make public statements of all kinds accurately, including promotion and advertis￾ing, and give service as advertised.
1. Base public statements providing professional opinions or information on sci￾entifically acceptable findings and techniques as much as possible, with full 
recognition of the limits and uncertainties of such evidence.
2. Seek to help people make informed choices when making statements as part 
of promotion or advertising.
3. Deliver services as advertised and do not shift without a clear professional 
rationale and the informed consent of the participants/clients.
III. Responsibility to the Profession
A. Act with due regard for the needs, special competencies and obligations of my col￾leagues in OD/HSD and other professions; respect the prerogatives and obligations of 
the institutions or organizations with which these other colleagues are associated.CHAPTER 3 The Organization Development Practitioner 73
B. Be aware of the possible impact of my public behavior upon the ability of col￾leagues to perform their professional work; perform professional activity in a way 
that will bring credit to the profession.
C. Work actively for ethical practice by individuals and organizations engaged in 
OD/HSD activities and, in case of questionable practice, use appropriate channels 
for confronting it, including
1. direct discussion when feasible.
2. joint consultation and feedback, using other professionals as third parties.
3. enforcement procedures of existing professional organizations.
4. public confrontation.
D. Contribute to continuing professional development by
1. supporting the development of other professionals, including mentoring with 
less experienced professionals.
2. contributing ideas, methods, findings, and other useful information to the 
body of OD/HSD knowledge and skill.
E. Promote the sharing of OD/HSD knowledge and skill by various means including
1. granting use of my copyrighted material as freely as possible, subject to a mini￾mum of conditions, including a reasonable price defined on the basis of profes￾sional as well as commercial values.
2. giving credit for the ideas and products of others.
IV. Social Responsibility
A. Strive for the preservation and protection of fundamental human rights and the 
promotion of social justice.
B. Be aware that I bear a heavy social responsibility because my recommendations 
and professional actions may alter the lives and well-being of individuals within 
my client systems, the systems themselves, and the larger systems of which they 
are subsystems.
C. Contribute knowledge, skill, and other resources in support of organizations, pro￾grams, and activities that seek to improve human welfare; be prepared to accept 
clients who do not have sufficient resources to pay my full fees at reduced fees or 
no charge.
D. Respect the cultures of the organization, community, country, or other human 
system within which I work (including the cultures’ traditions, values, and moral 
and ethical expectations and their implications), yet recognize and constructively 
confront the counterproductive aspects of those cultures whenever feasible; be 
sensitive to cross-cultural differences and their implications; be aware of the cul￾tural filters which bias my view of the world.
E. Recognize that accepting this statement as a guide for my behavior involves hold￾ing myself to a standard that may be more exacting than the laws of any country in 
which I practice.
F. Contribute to the quality of life in human society at large; work toward and support 
a culture based on mutual respect for each other’s rights as human beings; encour￾age the development of love, trust, openness, mutual responsibility, authentic and 
harmonious relationships, empowerment, participation, and involvement in a spirit 
of freedom and self-discipline as elements of this culture.
G. Engage in self-generated or collaborative endeavor to develop means for helping 
across cultures.
H. Serve the welfare of all the people of Earth, all living things, and their environment.2

part 2Entering and Contracting
The planned change process described in
Chapter 2 generally starts when one or more 
managers or administrators sense an opportunity 
for their organization, department, or group, 
believe that new capabilities need to be devel￾oped, or decide that performance could be 
improved through organization development. The 
organization might be successful yet have room 
for improvement. It might be facing impend￾ing environmental conditions that necessitate a 
change in how it operates. The organization could 
be experiencing particular problems, such as 
poor product quality, high rates of absenteeism, 
or dysfunctional conflicts among departments. 
Conversely, the problems might appear more 
diffuse and consist simply of feelings that the 
organization should be “more innovative,” “more 
competitive,” or “more effective.”
Entering and contracting are the initial steps 
in the OD process. They involve defining in a 
preliminary manner the organization’s problems 
or opportunities for development and estab￾lishing a collaborative relationship between 
the OD practitioner and members of the client 
system about how to work on those issues. 
Entering and contracting set the initial param￾eters for carrying out the subsequent phases 
of OD: diagnosing the organization, planning 
and implementing changes, and evaluating 
and institutionalizing them. They help to define 
what issues will be addressed by those activi￾ties, who will carry them out, and how they will 
be accomplished.
Entering and contracting can vary in complex￾ity and formality depending on the situation. 
In those cases where the manager of a work 
group or department serves as his or her own 
OD practitioner, entering and contracting typi￾cally involve the manager and group members 
meeting to discuss what issues to work on and 
how they will jointly meet the goals they set. 
Here, entering and contracting are relatively 
simple and informal. They involve all relevant 
members directly in the process—with a mini￾mum of formal procedures. In situations where 
managers and administrators are considering 
the use of professional OD practitioners, either 
from inside or from outside the organization, 
entering and contracting tend to be more 
complex and formal.1
 OD practitioners may 
need to collect preliminary information to 
help define the problematic or development 
issues. They may need to meet with represen￾tatives of the client organization rather than 
with the total membership; they may need to 
formalize their respective roles and how the 
change process will unfold. In cases where the 
anticipated changes are strategic and large in 
scale, formal proposals from multiple consult￾ing firms are requested and legal contracts are 
drawn up.
This chapter first discusses the activities and 
content-oriented issues involved in entering 
into and contracting for an OD initiative. Major 
attention here will be directed at complex 
processes involving OD professionals and client 
organizations. Similar entering and contracting 
issues, however, need to be addressed in even 
the simplest OD efforts, where managers serve 
as OD practitioners for their own work units. 
Unless there is clarity and agreement about 
what issues to work on, who will address them 
and how that will be accomplished, and what 
timetable will be followed, subsequent stages 
of the OD process are likely to be confusing and 
ineffective. The chapter concludes with a discus￾sion of the interpersonal process issues involved 
in entering and contracting for OD work.
476 PART 2 The Process of Organization Development
ENTERING INTO AN OD RELATIONSHIP
An OD process generally starts when a member of an organization or unit contacts 
an OD practitioner about potential help in addressing an organizational issue.2
 The 
organization member may be a manager, staff specialist, or some other key participant; 
the practitioner may be an OD professional from inside or outside of the organization. 
Determining whether the two parties should enter into an OD relationship typically 
involves clarifying the nature of the organization’s current functioning and the issue(s) 
to be addressed, the relevant client system for that issue, and the appropriateness of 
the particular OD practitioner.3
 In helping assess these issues, the OD practitioner may 
need to collect preliminary data about the organization. Similarly, the organization 
may need to gather information about the practitioner’s competence and experience.4
This knowledge will help both parties determine whether they should proceed to 
develop a contract for working together.
This section describes the activities involved in entering an OD relationship: clarify￾ing the organizational issue, determining the relevant client, and selecting the appro￾priate OD practitioner.
Clarifying the Organizational Issue
When seeking help from OD practitioners, organizations typically start with a present￾ing problem—the issue that has caused them to consider an OD process. It may be 
specific (decreased market share, increased absenteeism) or general (“we’re growing 
too fast,” “we need to prepare for rapid changes”). The presenting problem often has 
an implied or stated solution. For example, managers may believe that because costs 
are high, laying off members of their department is the obvious answer. They may 
even state the presenting problem in the form of a solution: “We need to downsize our 
organization.”
In many cases, however, the presenting problem is only a symptom of an underlying 
problem. For example, high costs may result from several deeper causes, including ineffec￾tive new product development or manufacturing processes, inappropriate customer service 
policies and procedures, or conflict between two interdependent groups. The issue facing 
the organization or department must be clarified early in the OD process so that subse￾quent diagnostic and intervention activities are focused correctly.5
Gaining a clearer perspective on the organizational issue may require collecting pre￾liminary data.6
 OD practitioners often examine company records and interview a few key 
members to gain an introductory understanding of the organization, its context, and the 
nature of the presenting problem. Those data are gathered in a relatively short period of 
time—typically over a few hours to one or two days. They are intended to provide enough 
rudimentary knowledge of the organizational issue to enable the two parties to make 
informed choices about proceeding with the contracting process.
The diagnostic phase of OD involves a far more extensive assessment of the problem￾atic or development issue than occurs during the entering and contracting stage. The 
diagnosis also might discover other issues that need to be addressed, or it might lead to 
redefining the initial issue that was identified during the entering and contracting stage. 
This is a prime example of the emergent nature of the OD process: Things may change 
as new information is gathered and new events occur.
Determining the Relevant Client
A second activity in entering an OD relationship is defining the relevant client for 
addressing the organizational issue.7
 Generally, the relevant client includes those 
organization members who can directly impact the change issue, whether it is solving 
a particular problem or improving an already successful organization or department. 
Unless these members are identified and included in the entering and contracting CHAPTER 4 Entering and Contracting 77
process, they may withhold their support for and commitment to the OD process. In 
trying to improve the productivity of a unionized manufacturing plant, for example, 
the relevant client may need to include union officials as well as managers and staff 
personnel. It is not unusual for an OD project to fail because the relevant client was 
inappropriately defined.
Determining the relevant client can vary in complexity depending on the situation. 
In those cases where the organizational issue can be addressed in a specific organiza￾tion unit, client definition is relatively straightforward. Members of that unit constitute 
the relevant client. They or their representatives must be included in the entering 
and contracting process. For example, if a manager asked for help in improving the 
decision-making process of his or her team, the manager and team members would 
be the relevant client. Unless they are actively involved in choosing an OD practitio￾ner and defining the subsequent change process, there is little likelihood that OD will 
improve team decision making.
Determining the relevant client is more complex when the organizational issue 
cannot readily be addressed in a single unit. Here, it may be necessary to expand the 
definition of the client to include members from multiple units, from different hierar￾chical levels, and even from outside of the organization. For example, the manager of 
a production department may seek help in resolving conflicts between his or her unit 
and other departments in the organization. The relevant client would extend beyond 
the boundaries of the production department because that department alone cannot 
resolve the issue. The client might include members from all departments involved 
in the conflict as well as the executive to whom all of the departments report. If that 
interdepartmental conflict also involved key suppliers and customers from outside of 
the firm, the relevant client might include members of those groups.
In such complex situations, OD practitioners need to gather additional information 
about the organization to determine the relevant client, generally as part of the pre￾liminary data collection that typically occurs when clarifying the issue to be addressed. 
When examining company records or interviewing personnel, practitioners can seek 
to identify the key members and organizational units that need to be involved. For 
example, they can ask organization members questions such as these: Who can directly 
impact the organizational issue? Who has a vested interest in it? Who has the power 
to approve or reject the OD effort? Answers to those questions can help determine 
who is the relevant client for the entering and contracting stage, although the client 
may change during the later stages of the OD process as new data are gathered and 
changes occur. If so, participants may have to return to and modify this initial stage of 
the OD effort.
Selecting an OD Practitioner
The last activity involved in entering an OD relationship is selecting an OD practitioner 
who has the expertise and experience to work with members on the organizational 
issue. Unfortunately, little systematic advice is available on how to choose a competent 
OD professional, whether from inside or outside of the organization.8
 To help lower 
the uncertainty of choosing from among external OD practitioners, organizations may 
request that proposals be submitted. In these cases, the OD practitioner must take all 
of the information gathered in the prior steps and create an outline of how the process 
might unfold. Table 4.1 provides one view of the key elements of such a proposal. It sug￾gests that a written proposal include project goals, outlines of action plans, a list of roles 
and responsibilities, recommended interventions, and proposed fees and expenses.
For less formal and structured selection processes, the late Gordon Lippitt, a pio￾neering practitioner in the field, suggested several criteria for selecting, evaluating, and 
developing OD practitioners.9
 Lippitt listed areas that managers should consider before 78 PART 2 The Process of Organization Development
selecting a practitioner—including their ability to form sound interpersonal relation￾ships, the degree of focus on the problem, the skills of the practitioner relative to the 
problem, the extent that the consultant clearly informs the client as to his or her role 
and contribution, and whether the practitioner belongs to a professional association. 
References from other clients are highly important. A client may not like the consul￾tant’s work, but it is critical to know the reasons for both pleasure and displeasure. One 
important consideration is whether the consultant approaches the organization with 
openness and an insistence on diagnosis or whether the practitioner appears to have a 
fixed program that is applicable to almost any organization.
Certainly, OD consulting is as much a person specialization as it is a task specialization. 
The OD professional needs not only a repertoire of technical skills but also the personal￾ity and interpersonal competence to use himself or herself as an instrument of change. 
Regardless of technical training, the consultant must be able to maintain a boundary 
position, coordinating among various units and departments and mixing disciplines, 
theories, technology, and research findings in an organic rather than in a mechanical 
way. The practitioner is potentially the most important OD technology available.
Thus, in selecting an OD practitioner perhaps the most important issue is the fun￾damental question, “How effective has the person been in the past, with what kinds 
of organizations, using what kinds of techniques?” In other words, references must be 
checked. Interpersonal relationships are tremendously important, but even con artists 
have excellent interpersonal relationships and skills.
The burden of choosing an effective OD practitioner should not rest entirely with the 
client organization.10 As described in the Ethical Dilemmas section of Chapter 3, con￾sultants also bear a heavy responsibility in finding whether there is a match between 
their skills and knowledge and what the organization or department needs. Few man￾agers are sophisticated enough to detect or to understand subtle differences in expertise 
among OD professionals, and they often do not understand the difference between 
Text not available due to copyright restrictionsCHAPTER 4 Entering and Contracting 79
intervention specialties. Thus, practitioners should help educate potential clients, being 
explicit about their strengths and weaknesses and their range of competence. If OD 
professionals realize that a good match does not exist, they should inform the client 
and help them find more suitable help.
Application 4.1 describes the entering process at Alegent Health, a large health care 
system in Nebraska and western Iowa. The entry process was largely “virtual” in that 
the researchers worked through two consultants who were conducting OD interven￾tions on a regular basis. The case highlights how OD work can come in different forms 
and through different channels. It also reflects how quickly the “entry” process can 
occur. This is the first in a series of applications based on the Alegent project that will 
be used throughout the text.
DEVELOPING A CONTRACT
The activities of entering an OD relationship are a necessary prelude to developing 
an OD contract. They define the major focus for contracting, including the relevant 
parties. Contracting is a natural extension of the entering process and clarifies how 
the OD process will proceed. It typically establishes the expectations of the parties, the 
time and resources that will be expended, and the ground rules under which the par￾ties will operate.
The goal of contracting is to make a good decision about how to carry out the OD 
process.11 It can be relatively informal and involve only a verbal agreement between 
the client and the OD practitioner. A team leader with OD skills, for example, may 
voice his or her concerns to members about how the team is functioning. After some 
discussion, they might agree to devote one hour of future meeting time to diagnosing 
the team with the help of the leader. Here, entering and contracting are done together, 
informally. In other cases, contracting can be more protracted and result in a formal 
document. That typically occurs when organizations employ outside OD practitioners. 
Government agencies, for example, generally have procurement regulations that apply 
to contracting with outside consultants.12
Regardless of the level of formality, all OD processes require some form of explicit 
contracting that results in either a verbal or a written agreement. Such contracting 
clarifies the client’s and the practitioner’s expectations about how the OD process will 
take place. Unless there is mutual understanding and agreement about the process, 
there is considerable risk that someone’s expectations will be unfulfilled.13 That can 
lead to reduced commitment and support, to misplaced action, or to premature termi￾nation of the process.
The contracting step in OD generally addresses three key areas:14 setting mutual 
expectations or what each party expects to gain from the OD process; the time and 
resources that will be devoted to it; and the ground rules for working together.
Mutual Expectations
This part of the contracting process focuses on the expectations of the client and the 
OD practitioner. The client states the services and outcomes to be provided by the OD 
practitioner and describes what the organization expects from the process and the 
consultant. Clients usually can describe the desired outcomes, such as lower costs or 
higher job satisfaction. Encouraging them to state their wants in the form of outcomes, 
working relationships, and personal accomplishments can facilitate the development 
of a good contract.15
The OD practitioner also should state what he or she expects to gain from the OD 
process. This can include opportunities to try new interventions, report the results to 
other potential clients, and receive appropriate compensation or recognition.PART 2 The Process of Organization Development
Entering Alegent Health
Alegent Health (AH) is a five-hospital system that 
serves the greater Omaha, Nebraska, and west￾ern Iowa region. Alegent was formed when two 
religious-sponsored health care systems merged to 
leverage health care industry changes and bargain 
more powerfully with physicians and insurance 
providers. The system had its own managed care 
insurance program, was implementing a consumer￾directed health care program for its employees, and 
had about 100 employed physicians in addition to 
the physicians with privileges at its hospitals.
Two well-known OD consultants had been work￾ing with AH for about two years, doing a variety of 
OD work. By far, the largest piece of work was the 
design and delivery of large-group interventions 
known as decision accelerators (DAs) to create 
strategies for the major clinical service areas, such 
as orthopedics, cardiology, and women’s and chil￾dren’s services. [Note: large-group interventions 
are multi-stakeholder meetings of over 50 people—
see Chapter 13 for more information.]
At an organization design conference in April, 
one of the consultants was talking with research￾ers from the Center for Effective Organizations at 
USC. The conversation turned to a discussion of 
the work at AH and the possibility of evaluating the 
change effort. The researchers were excited about 
the organization development and large-group 
intervention work in the health care context. The 
consultant agreed to pitch the idea to AH’s Chief 
Innovation Officer (CIO).
Following some additional background conver￾sations with the researchers and the CIO, the con￾sultant sent the following email in June:
Dear CIO:
I would like to introduce you to the Center 
for Effective Organization researchers. As 
we discussed, the researchers are very inter￾ested in the work being done at AH and will 
be calling you early next week to discuss the 
possibility of doing a research project on 
the Decision Accelerator effort. The form of 
research is typically action research, meaning 
the data will be valuable for Alegent in not 
only defining the impact and effectiveness 
of the DA but learning how to position 
this capability for improved Alegent orga￾nizational effectiveness. This can be quite 
valuable as Alegent moves into this next 
round of change and transformation.
Thanks all.
The researchers spent the next few days talking to 
the two consultants about the organization, its his￾tory, strategy, structure, and culture, as well as the 
motivation for the large-group, decision accelerator 
process. They also collected data on AH through the 
Internet. Alegent was indeed a unique organiza￾tion. It was highly successful from a financial point 
of view, had a new CEO who had been brought in 
from Florida, and had a strong faith-based mission.
In the first phone call with the CIO, the researchers 
introduced themselves, described the mission of the 
research center, and their interest in doing a case 
study of change at Alegent. The CIO talked about 
the history of change at AH and asked questions 
about the value the project would have for them. He 
saw several benefits, including the opportunity to 
generate a history of the change, to learn about the 
impacts of the change process on the organization’s 
culture and members, and to build a database that 
could be used to advance the health system’s objec￾tive of “changing the face of health care.” The call 
ended with the agreement that the CIO would talk 
with others in the organization, including the CEO, 
and that the researchers should begin to put togeth￾er a project purpose, cost estimate, and schedule.
In the second call, the researchers presented their 
understanding of the project as a case study 
assessment of how innovation was created and 
implemented at Alegent. They described a way of 
working with organizations—the establishment of a 
“study team” composed of several key stakeholders 
in the organization. The study team would meet, 
before the project officially began, to review the 
objectives of the study and ensure that the work 
was relevant to the organization. There was some 
conversation about who might be on that team, 
including the CEO, CFO, the hospital presidents, 
and the VPs of the clinical service areas.
Subsequent email exchanges among the consultants, 
the CIO, and the researchers led to a verbal agree￾ment that the project should begin in October. The 
CIO believed there was much to gain from the project, 
and asked the Director of the Right Track office (this 
was the internal name AH had given to the decision 
accelerator) to lead the contracting process and to help 
the researchers schedule meetings and interviews.

Time and Resources
To accomplish change, the organization and the OD practitioner must commit time and 
resources to the effort. Each must be clear about how much energy and how many 
resources will be dedicated to the change process. Failure to make explicit the neces￾sary requirements of a change process can quickly ruin an OD effort. For example, a 
client may clearly state that the assignment involves diagnosing the causes of poor pro￾ductivity in a work group. However, the client may expect the practitioner to complete 
the assignment without talking to the workers. Typically, clients want to know how 
much time will be necessary to complete the assignment, who needs to be involved, 
how much it will cost, and so on.
Block has suggested that resources can be divided into two parts.16 Essential require￾ments are things that are absolutely necessary if the change process is to be successful. 
From the practitioner’s perspective, they can include access to key people or informa￾tion, enough time to do the job, and commitment from certain stakeholder groups. The 
organization’s essential requirements might include a speedy diagnosis or assurances 
that the project will be conducted at the lowest price. Being clear about the constraints 
on carrying out the assignment will facilitate the contracting process and improve the 
chances for success. Desirable requirements are those things that would be nice to have 
but are not absolutely necessary, such as access to special resources or written rather 
than verbal reports.
Ground Rules
The final part of the contracting process involves specifying how the client and the OD 
practitioner will work together. The parameters established may include such issues 
as confidentiality, if and how the OD practitioner will become involved in personal or 
interpersonal issues, how to terminate the relationship, and whether the practitioner 
is supposed to make expert recommendations or help the manager make decisions. 
For internal consultants, organizational politics make it especially important to clarify 
issues of how to handle sensitive information and how to deliver “bad news.”17 Such 
process issues are as important as the needed substantive changes. Failure to address 
the concerns may mean that the client or the practitioner has inappropriate assump￾tions about how the process will unfold.
Application 4.2 describes the contracting process for the evaluation project at Alegent 
Health. In this case, the contracting process was much more complicated than the entry 
process. What would you list as the strengths and weaknesses of this example?
INTERPERSONAL PROCESS ISSUES IN ENTERING
AND CONTRACTING
The previous sections on entering and contracting addressed the activities and content￾oriented issues associated with beginning an OD project. In this final section, we 
discuss the interpersonal issues an OD practitioner must be aware of to produce a 
successful agreement. In most cases, the client’s expectations, resources, and working 
relationship requirements will not fit perfectly with the OD practitioner’s essential and 
desirable requirements. Negotiating the differences to improve the likelihood of success 
can be intra- and interpersonally challenging.
Entering and contracting are the first exchanges between a client and an OD prac￾titioner. Establishing a healthy relationship at the outset makes it more likely that the 
client’s desired outcomes will be achieved and that the OD practitioner will be able 
to improve the organization’s capacity to manage change in the future. As shown in 
Figure 4.1, this initial stage is full of uncertainty and ambiguity. On the one hand, the 
client is likely to feel exposed, inadequate, or vulnerable. The organization’s current PART 2 The Process of Organization Development
Contracting with Alegent Health
Following the verbal approval of the CIO to begin 
the work, the researchers began working with 
the Right Track director and the consultants to 
formulate an agreement on how to proceed with 
the case study and assessment. The contracting 
process proceeded on two parallel paths. One 
path was the specification of the formal contract—
who, what, how much, and why—and the second 
path was the project scheduling—who, when, and 
where.
Formal Contracting Process
The formal contracting process required the 
researchers to propose a purpose, cost estimate, 
and schedule for the case study. The researchers’ 
initial proposal looked like this: 
The first work stream was the DA archives. The 
researchers had learned, through the consultants 
and the Right Track director, that the Right Track 
staff kept nearly verbatim transcripts and descrip￾tions of each of the decision accelerator meetings 
that took place. Thus, the researchers proposed an 
analysis of those documents as an important work 
stream in the process. The second work stream, rep￾resenting the bulk of the data collection, would be 
two rounds of interviews with executives, manag￾ers, and staff involved in the change process. Finally, 
the project would be governed by a study team who 
would work to frame project objectives, receive the 
feedback and assist in data interpretation, and help 
to transfer the learnings back to the organization.
In addition to the timeline, the research proposal 
outlined the purpose of the project; the likely ben￾efits to Alegent; the estimated costs for interviews, 
data analysis, and direct expenses; the support 
resources expected from Alegent, including the 
establishment of the study team; a statement about 
data confidentiality; and some suggested publica￾tion outlets. The Right Track director reviewed the 
document and asked for some additional detail. As 
described in the “Project Scheduling Process” section 
below, the start date had slipped to early November.
Dear Right Track Director
We got a message from the consultants that 
you need a little extra “drill down detail” on the 
case study assessment project. We’ve taken a 
stab at such a document and it is attached.
The document includes a one-page descrip￾tion of proposed dates, activities, and infor￾mation to be gathered. Please let me know 
if this meets your needs.
The document also lists a set of potential 
questions for the initial round of interviews.

Data Collection Plan—Right Track Assessment Project84 PART 2 The Process of Organization Development
Shortly thereafter, the Right Track director sent the 
following email:
CEO Researchers,
Thanks for this added info. I, along with 
one of my staff members, have taken this 
along with all the documentation you have 
sent me to date and have attempted to cre￾ate one cohesive document that can serve 
as the contract, statement of work, action 
plan, cost estimate, etc . . . This document is 
attached for your review.
I have also tried to answer some of the out￾standing questions we have had in this docu￾ment and have tried to further narrow the 
onsite dates and activities to include the inter￾view list and the two questions you mentioned 
below. On your questions I think the two-year 
window is appropriate and I preferred option 
2 which is incorporated in the attached.
Please review this latest document and provide 
any feedback and/or changes you might have 
to us all. I will be out of town for a few days but 
my staff can keep the process moving through 
Legal and the CIO’s office in my absence. I can 
also be reached via cell phone through the 
rest of the week as needed. Thanks.
The attachment referred to in the Right Track direc￾tor’s email was a standard, corporate consulting 
contract, with the researchers’ proposal and revised 
schedule attached as the scope of work. Within the 
standard contract was a paragraph noting that all 
surveys, data, and documents created during the 
project would become the exclusive property of the 
Alegent Health corporation. The paragraph directly 
contradicted the confidentiality statement in the 
researchers’ proposal. A number of conversations 
among the consultants, the researchers, and the dif￾ferent Alegent departments ensued. Eventually, a 
paragraph was written that was satisfactory to all par￾ties and allowed for the researchers to use the data 
in their publications, but also gave Alegent the right 
to review, edit, and approve any articles, chapters, or 
descriptions of the organization change effort.
Project Scheduling Process
The project scheduling process—which was done 
in parallel with the formal contracting process 
described above—involved working with the Right 
Track office to pick dates, schedule interviews, 
communicate with interviewees, and set up other 
logistical requirements to begin the study. Following 
a few introductory emails, and based on the CIO’s 
interest in beginning in October, the researchers sent 
the following message in early September:
Hi Right Track Director:
With the CIO’s approval, we’re ready to begin 
the Right Track assessment project. The con￾sultants and the researchers are very excited 
about the effort. We need your help to set up 
the first couple of days in October, ideally on 
the 17th and 18th.
On the 17th, we’d like to have a meeting of 
the “study team.” This can be in the morn￾ing or afternoon, whichever best fits into the 
CIO’s schedule.
The balance of the 17th and all day on the 
18th should be 60-minute interviews with 
the senior leadership of Alegent. Based on 
our discussions with the consultants and the 
CIO, the list for the initial round of interviews 
would be 10 to 12 of the following people:
[List of top 15 executives and 7 key physicians]
Thanks for your help.
In response, the Right Track director sent back the 
following email:
CEO Researchers:
Welcome aboard and looking forward to 
working with you on this effort. Is there a 
specific reason you are targeting 10/17 & 18? 
I ask because there is a DA scheduled those 
two days that some of these folks are suppose 
to be in and that I will be helping to support. It 
is actually an external group, namely the Boy 
Scouts. Are you planning to come that week 
because of that or is this just a coincidence? 
My contact info is enclosed. Thanks.
Thus, there was some initial confusion on the start 
date of the project, and subsequent phone calls and 
emails clarified that starting the project in November 
would be a better fit for the Alegent organization. 
Some initial dates that fit in the researchers’ sched￾ule were not good for the Alegent executives and 
physicians, while dates that were good for Alegent 
didn’t fit with the researchers’ schedule.
Eventually, the beginning of the project was pushed 
back to early December, and the researchers flew to 
Omaha to begin the interviewing process. In the rush 
to schedule interviews, make travel arrangements, 
and finalize the interview questions and survey items, 
the meeting of the “study team” was over looked.CHAPTER 4 Entering and Contracting 85
effectiveness and the request for help may seem to the client like an admission that 
they are incapable of solving the problem or providing the leadership necessary to 
achieve a set of results. Moreover, they are entering into a relationship where they 
may feel unable to control the activities of the OD practitioner. As a result, they feel 
vulnerable because of their dependency on the practitioner to provide assistance. 
Consciously or unconsciously, feelings of exposure, inadequacy, or vulnerability may 
lead the client to resist coming to closure on the contract. The OD practitioner must be 
alert to the signs of resistance, such as asking for extraordinary amounts of detail, and 
be able to address them skillfully.
On the other hand, the OD practitioner may have feelings of empathy, unworthi￾ness, and dependency. The practitioner may overidentify with the client’s issues and 
want to be so helpful that he or she agrees to unreasonable deadlines or inadequate 
resources. The practitioner’s desire to be seen as competent and worthy may lead to an 
agreement on a project for which the practitioner has few skills or experience. Finally, 
in response to reasonable client requests, the practitioner may challenge the client’s 
motivation and become defensive. Schein notes that OD practitioners too often under￾estimate or ignore the power and impact of entry and contracting as an intervention in 
their own right.18 With even the simplest request for help, there are a myriad of things 
the OD practitioner, entering a system for the first time, does not know. Establishing a 
relationship with a client must be approached carefully; the initial contacts and conver￾sations must represent a model of how the OD process will be conducted. As a result, 
actually coming to agreement during the contracting phase can be difficult and intense. 
A number of complex emotional and psychological issues are in play, and OD practi￾tioners must be mindful of their own as well as the client’s perspectives. Attending to 
those issues as well as to the content of the contract will help increase the likelihood 
of success.

SUMMARY
Entering and contracting constitute the initial activities of the OD process. They set 
the parameters for the phases of planned change that follow: diagnosing, planning and 
implementing change, and evaluating and institutionalizing it. Organizational entry 
involves clarifying the organizational issue or presenting problem, determining the 
relevant client, and selecting an OD practitioner. Developing an OD contract focuses 
on making a good decision about whether to proceed and allows both the client and 
the OD practitioner to clarify expectations about how the change process will unfold. 
Contracting involves setting mutual expectations, negotiating time and resources, and 
developing ground rules for working together.Diagnosing Organizations
Diagnosing organizations is the second 
major phase in the general model of planned 
change described in Chapter 2 (Figure 2.2). 
It follows the entering and contracting stage 
(Chapter 4) and precedes the planning and 
implementation phase. When done well, diag￾nosis clearly points the organization and the 
OD practitioner toward a set of appropriate 
intervention activities that will improve organi￾zation effectiveness.
Diagnosis is the process of understanding a 
system’s current functioning. It involves collect￾ing pertinent information about current opera￾tions, analyzing those data, and drawing 
conclusions for potential change and improve￾ment. Effective diagnosis provides the system￾atic knowledge of the organization needed to 
design appropriate interventions. Thus, OD 
interventions derive from diagnosis and include 
specific actions intended to improve organiza￾tional functioning. (Chapters 12 through 22 pres￾ent the major interventions used in OD today.)
This chapter is the first of four chapters that 
describe different aspects of the diagnostic pro￾cess. This chapter presents a general definition of 
diagnosis and discusses the need for diagnostic 
models in guiding the process. Diagnostic models 
derive from conceptions about how organizations 
function, and they tell OD practitioners what 
to look for in diagnosing organizations, depart￾ments, groups, or jobs. They serve as a road map 
for discovering current functioning. A general, 
comprehensive diagnostic model is presented 
based on open systems theory. This chapter con￾cludes with a description and application of an 
organization-level diagnostic model. Chapter 6 
describes and applies diagnostic models at the 
group and job levels. Chapters 7 and 8 complete 
the diagnostic phase by discussing processes of 
data collection, analysis, and feedback.
WHAT IS DIAGNOSIS?
Diagnosis is the process of understanding how the organization is currently function￾ing, and it provides the information necessary to design change interventions. It gen￾erally follows from successful entry and contracting, which set the stage for successful 
diagnosis. Those processes help OD practitioners and client members jointly determine 
organizational issues to focus on, how to collect and analyze data to understand them, 
and how to work together to develop action steps from the diagnosis. In another sense, 
diagnosis is happening all the time. Managers, organization members, and OD practi￾tioners are always trying to understand the drivers of organization effectiveness, and 
how and why change is proceeding in a particular way.
Unfortunately, the term diagnosis can be misleading when applied to organizations. It 
suggests a model of organization change analogous to the medical model of diagnosis: An 
organization (patient) experiencing problems seeks help from an OD practitioner (doc￾tor); the practitioner examines the organization, finds the causes of the problems, and 
prescribes a solution. Diagnosis in organization development, however, is much more 
collaborative than such a medical perspective implies and does not accept the implicit 
assumption that something is wrong with the organization.
588 PART 2 The Process of Organization Development
First, the values and ethical beliefs that underlie OD suggest that both organization 
members and change agents should be involved in discovering the determinants of 
current organization effectiveness. Similarly, both should be involved actively in devel￾oping appropriate interventions and implementing them. For example, a manager 
might seek an OD practitioner’s help to reduce absenteeism in his or her department. 
The manager and an OD consultant jointly might decide to diagnose the cause of the 
problem by examining company absenteeism records and by interviewing selected 
employees about possible reasons for absenteeism. Alternatively, they might examine 
employee loyalty and discover the organizational elements that encourage people to 
stay. Analysis of those data could uncover determinants of absenteeism or loyalty in 
the department, thus helping the manager and the OD practitioner jointly to develop 
an appropriate intervention to address the issue.
Second, the medical model of diagnosis also implies that something is wrong with 
the patient and that one needs to uncover the cause of the illness. In those cases 
where organizations do have specific problems, diagnosis can be problem oriented, 
seeking reasons for the problems. On the other hand, as suggested by the absenteeism 
example above, the OD practitioner and the client may choose one of the newer views 
of organization change and frame the issue positively. Additionally, the client and the 
OD practitioner may be looking for ways to enhance the organization’s existing func￾tioning. Many managers involved with OD are not experiencing specific organizational 
problems. Here, diagnosis is development oriented. It assesses the current functioning 
of the organization to discover areas for future development. For example, a manager 
might be interested in using OD to improve a department that already seems to be 
functioning well. Diagnosis might include an overall assessment of both the task per￾formance capabilities of the department and the impact of the department on its indi￾vidual members. This process seeks to uncover specific areas for future development of 
the department’s effectiveness.
In organization development, diagnosis is used more broadly than a medical defini￾tion would suggest. It is a collaborative process between organization members and the 
OD consultant to collect pertinent information, analyze it, and draw conclusions for 
action planning and intervention. Diagnosis may be aimed at uncovering the causes of 
specific problems, focused on understanding effective processes, or directed at assess￾ing the overall functioning of the organization or department to discover areas for 
future development. Diagnosis provides a systematic understanding of organizations so 
that appropriate interventions may be developed for solving problems and enhancing 
effectiveness.
THE NEED FOR DIAGNOSTIC MODELS
Entry and contracting processes can result in a need to understand either a whole 
system or some part, process, or feature of the organization. To diagnose an organiza￾tion, OD practitioners and organization members need to have an idea about what 
information to collect and analyze. Choices about what to look for invariably depend 
on how organizations are perceived. Such perceptions can vary from intuitive hunches 
to scientific explanations of how organizations function. Conceptual frameworks that 
people use to understand organizations are referred to as “diagnostic models.”1
 They 
describe the relationships among different features of the organization, as well as its 
context and its effectiveness. As a result, diagnostic models point out what areas to 
examine and what questions to ask in assessing how an organization is functioning.
However, all models represent simplifications of reality and therefore choose certain 
features as critical. As discussed in Chapter 2, the positive model of change supports 
the conclusion that focusing attention on those features, often to the exclusion of oth￾ers, can result in a biased diagnosis. For example, a diagnostic model that relates team CHAPTER 5 Diagnosing Organizations 89
effectiveness to the handling of interpersonal conflict would lead an OD practitioner 
to ask questions about relationships among members, decision-making processes, and 
conflict resolution methods. Although relevant, those questions ignore other group 
issues such as the composition of skills and knowledge, the complexity of the tasks 
performed by the group, and member interdependencies. Thus, diagnostic models and 
processes must be chosen carefully to address the organization’s presenting problems 
as well as to ensure comprehensiveness.
Potential diagnostic models are everywhere. Any collection of concepts and rela￾tionships that attempts to represent a system or explain its effectiveness can poten￾tially qualify as a diagnostic model. Major sources of diagnostic models in OD are the 
thousands of articles and books that discuss, describe, and analyze how organizations 
function. They provide information about how and why certain organizational sys￾tems, processes, or functions are effective. The studies often concern a specific facet of 
organizational behavior, such as employee stress, leadership, motivation, problem solv￾ing, group dynamics, job design, and career development. They also can involve the 
larger organization and its context, including the environment, strategy, structure, and 
culture. Diagnostic models can be derived from that information by noting the dimen￾sions or variables that are associated with an organization’s effectiveness.
Another source of diagnostic models is OD practitioners’ experience in organiza￾tions. That field knowledge is a wealth of practical information about how organi￾zations operate. Unfortunately, only a small part of that vast experience has been 
translated into diagnostic models that represent the professional judgments of people 
with years of experience in organizational diagnosis. The models generally link diag￾nosis with specific organizational processes, such as group problem solving, employee 
motivation, or communication between managers and employees. The models list 
specific questions for diagnosing such processes.
This chapter presents a general framework for diagnosing organizations rather 
than trying to cover the range of OD diagnostic models. The framework describes 
the systems perspective prevalent in OD today and integrates several of the more 
popular diagnostic models. The systems model provides a useful starting point for 
diagnosing organizations or departments. (Additional diagnostic models that are 
linked to specific OD interventions are presented in Chapters 12 through 22).
OPEN SYSTEMS MODEL
This section introduces systems theory, a set of concepts and relationships describ￾ing the properties and behaviors of things called systems—organizations, groups, and 
people, for example. Systems are viewed as unitary wholes composed of parts or sub￾systems; the system serves to integrate the parts into a functioning unit. For example, 
organization systems are composed of departments, such as sales, operations, and 
finance. The organization serves to coordinate behaviors of its departments so that they 
function together in service of a goal or strategy. The general diagnostic model based on 
systems theory that underlies most of the OD is called the “open systems model.”
Organizations as Open Systems
As shown in Figure 5.1, the open systems model recognizes that organizations exist 
in the context of a larger environment that affects how the organization performs and 
in turn is affected by how the organization interacts with it. The model suggests that 
organizations operate within an external environment, takes specific inputs from the envi￾ronment, and transforms those inputs using social and technical processes. The outputs
of the transformation process are returned to the environment and can be used as 
feedback to the organization’s functioning.The Organization as an Open System

90 PART 2 The Process of Organization Development
The open systems model also suggests that organizations and their subsystems—
departments, groups, and individuals—share a number of common features that explain 
how they are organized and function. For example, open systems display a hierarchical 
ordering. Each higher level of system is composed of lower-level systems: Systems at the 
level of society are composed of organizations; organizations comprise are composed of 
groups (departments); and groups comprise are composed of individuals. Although sys￾tems at different levels vary in many ways—in size and complexity, for example—they 
have a number of common characteristics by virtue of being open systems, and those 
properties can be applied to systems at any level.
The following open systems properties are described below: environments; inputs, 
transformations, and outputs; boundaries; feedback; equifinality; and alignment.
Environments Organizational environments are everything beyond the boundaries of 
the system that can indirectly or directly affect performance and outcomes. Open sys￾tems, such as organizations and people, exchange information and resources with their 
environments. They cannot completely control their own behavior and are influenced 
in part by external forces. Organizations, for example, are affected by such environ￾mental conditions as the availability of labor and human capital, raw material, cus￾tomer demands, competition, and government regulations. Understanding how these 
external forces affect the organization can help explain some of its internal behavior.
Inputs, Transformations, and Outputs Any organizational system is composed of three 
related parts: inputs, transformations, and outputs. Inputs consist of human resources 
or other resources, such as information, energy, and materials, coming into the system. 
Inputs are part of and acquired from the organization’s external environment. For 
example, a manufacturing organization acquires raw materials from an outside supplier. 
Similarly, a hospital nursing unit acquires information concerning a patient’s condition 
from the attending physician. In each case, the system (organization or nursing unit) 
obtains resources (raw materials or information) from its external environment.
Transformations are the processes of converting inputs into outputs. In organizations, 
a production or operations function composed of both social and technological compo￾nents generally carries out transformations. The social component consists of people 
and their work relationships, whereas the technological component involves tools, 
techniques, and methods of production or service delivery. Organizations have devel￾oped elaborate mechanisms for transforming incoming resources into goods and ser￾vices. Banks, for example, transform deposits into mortgage loans and interest income. 
Schools attempt to transform students into more educated people. Transformation CHAPTER 5 Diagnosing Organizations 91
processes also can take place at the group and individual levels. For example, research 
and development departments can transform the latest scientific advances into new 
product ideas, and bank tellers can transform customer requests into valued services.
Outputs are the results of what is transformed by the system and sent to the envi￾ronment. Thus, inputs that have been transformed represent outputs ready to leave the 
system. Group health insurance companies receive premiums, healthy and unhealthy 
individuals, and medical bills; transform them through physician visits and record 
keeping; and export treated patients and payments to hospitals and physicians.
Boundaries The idea of boundaries helps to distinguish between systems and envi￾ronments. Closed systems have relatively rigid and impenetrable boundaries, whereas 
open systems have far more permeable borders. Boundaries—the borders, or limits, of 
the system—are easily seen in many biological and mechanical systems. Defining the 
boundaries of social systems is more difficult because there is a continuous inflow and 
outflow through them. For example, where are the organizational boundaries in the 
following case? An individual customer installing a wireless home network gets a mes￾sage that the software is conflicting with another piece of software from the Internet 
service provider (ISP). The customer calls the network software provider who talks to 
the ISP technical support people and provides technical support and suggestions that 
resolve the conflict. The customer feels completely supported by the process and never 
knew that the network software technical support person he or she was talking to was 
in India. The continued development of the Internet will continue to challenge the 
notion of boundaries in open systems.
The definition of a boundary is somewhat arbitrary because a social system has mul￾tiple subsystems and the boundary line for one subsystem may not be the same as that 
for a different subsystem. As with the system itself, arbitrary boundaries may have to 
be assigned to any social organization, depending on the variable to be stressed. The 
boundaries used for studying or analyzing leadership, for instance, may be quite dif￾ferent from those used to study intergroup dynamics.
Just as systems can be considered relatively open or closed, the permeability of 
boundaries also varies from fixed to diffuse. The boundaries of a community’s police 
force are probably far more rigid and sharply defined than those of the community’s 
political parties. Conflict over boundaries is always a potential problem within an orga￾nization, just as it is in the world outside the organization.
Feedback As shown in Figure 5.1, feedback is information regarding the actual per￾formance or the output results of the system. Not all such information is feedback, 
however. Only information used to control the future functioning of the system 
is considered feedback. Feedback can be used to maintain the system in a steady 
state (for example, keeping an assembly line running at a certain speed) or to 
help the organization adapt to changing circumstances. McDonald’s, for example, 
has strict feedback processes to ensure that a meal in one outlet is as similar 
as possible to a meal in any other outlet. On the other hand, a salesperson in the field 
may report that sales are not going well and may insist on some organizational change 
to improve sales. A market research study may lead the marketing department to rec￾ommend a change to the organization’s advertising campaign.
Equifinality In closed systems, a direct cause-and-effect relationship exists between 
the initial condition and the final state of the system: When a computer’s “on” switch 
is pushed, the system powers up. Biological and social systems, however, operate quite 
differently. The idea of equifinality suggests that similar results or outputs may be 
achieved with different initial conditions and in many different ways. This concept sug￾gests that a manager can use varying degrees of inputs into the organization and can 
transform them in a variety of ways to obtain satisfactory outputs. Thus, the function 92
of management is not to seek a single rigid solution but rather to develop a variety of 
satisfactory options. Systems and contingency theories suggest that there is no universal 
best way to design an organization. Organizations and departments providing routine 
services, such as Earthlink’s, AOL’s, or Microsoft’s Internet services, could be designed 
quite differently and still achieve the same result. Similarly, customer service functions 
at major retailers, software manufacturers, or airlines could be designed according to 
similar principles.
Alignment A system’s overall effectiveness is partly determined by the extent to 
which the different subsystems are aligned with each other. This alignment or fit con￾cerns the relationships between the organization and its environment, between inputs 
and transformations, between transformations and outputs, and among the subsys￾tems of the transformation process. Diagnosticians who view the relationships among 
the various parts of a system as a whole are taking what is referred to as “a systemic 
perspective.”
Alignment refers to a characteristic of the relationship between two or more parts. 
It represents the extent to which the features, operations, and characteristics of one 
system support the effectiveness of another system. Just as the teeth in two wheels of 
a watch must mesh perfectly for the watch to keep time, so do the parts of an orga￾nization need to mesh for it to be effective. For example, General Electric attempts to 
achieve its goals through a strategy of diversification and a divisional structure that 
focuses attention and resources on specific businesses such as medical systems, light￾ing, and consumer electronics. A functional structure would not be a good fit with 
the strategy because it is more efficient for each division to focus on one product line 
than for one manufacturing department to try to make CT scanners, light bulbs, and 
refrigerators. The systemic perspective suggests that diagnosis is the search for misfits 
among the various parts and subsystems of an organization.
Diagnosing Organizational Systems
When viewed as open systems, organizations can be diagnosed at three levels. The 
highest level is the overall organization and includes the design of the company’s strat￾egy, structure, and processes. Large organization units, such as divisions, subsidiaries, 
or strategic business units, also can be diagnosed at that level. The next lowest level 
is the group or department, which includes group design and devices for structuring 
interactions among members, such as norms and work schedules. The lowest level is 
the individual position or job. This includes ways in which jobs are designed to elicit 
required task behaviors.
Diagnosis can occur at all three organizational levels, or it may be limited to issues 
occurring at a particular level. The key to effective diagnosis is knowing what to look 
for at each level as well as how the levels affect each other.2
 For example, diagnosing 
a work group requires knowledge of the variables important for group functioning and 
how the larger organization design affects the group. In fact, a basic understanding of 
organization-level issues is important in almost any diagnosis because they serve as 
critical inputs to understanding groups and individuals.
Figure 5.2 presents a comprehensive model for diagnosing these different organ￾izational systems. For each level, it shows (1) the inputs that the system has to work 
with, (2) the key design components of the transformation subsystem, and (3) the 
system’s outputs.
The relationships shown in Figure 5.2 illustrate how each organization level affects 
the lower levels. The external environment is the key input to organization design 
decisions. Organization design is an input to group design, which in turn serves as an 
input to job design. These cross-level relationships emphasize that organizational lev￾els must fit with each other if the organization is to operate effectively. For example, 
PART 2 The Process of Organization DevelopmentCHAPTER 5 Diagnosing Organizations 93
organization structure must fit with and support group task design, which in turn must 
fit with individual job design.
The following discussion on organization-level diagnosis and the discussion in 
Chapter 6 on group- and job-level diagnosis provide general overviews of the dimen￾sions (and their relationships) that need to be understood at each level. It is beyond the 
scope of this book to describe in detail the many variables and relationships reported

in the extensive literature on organizations. However, specific diagnostic questions are 
identified and concrete examples are included as an introduction to this phase of the 
planned change process.
ORGANIZATION-LEVEL DIAGNOSIS
The organization level of analysis is the broadest systems perspective typically taken 
in diagnostic activities. The model shown in Figure 5.2(A) is similar to other popular 
organization-level diagnostic models. These include Weisbord’s six-box model,3
 Nadler 
and Tushman’s congruency model,4
 Galbraith’s star model,5 and Kotter’s organiza￾tion dynamics model.6
 Figure 5.2(A) proposes that an organization’s transformation 
processes, or design components, represent the way the organization positions and 
organizes itself within an environment (inputs) to achieve specific outputs. The com￾bination of design component elements is called a “strategic orientation.”7
To understand how a total organization functions, it is necessary to examine par￾ticular inputs, design components, and the alignment of the two sets of dimensions. 
Figure 5.2(A) shows that two key inputs affect the way an organization designs its 
strategic orientation: the general environment and the task environment or industry 
structure.
Organization Environments and Inputs
At the organization level of analysis, the external environment is the key input. We first 
describe different types of environments that can affect organizations. Then we identify 
environmental dimensions that influence organizational responses to external forces.
Environmental Types There are two classes of environments: the general environ￾ment and the task environment.8
 We will also describe the enacted environment, 
which reflects members’ perceptions of the general and task environments.
The general environment consists of all external forces and elements that can influence 
an organization and affect its effectiveness.9
 The environment can be described in terms 
of the amount of uncertainty present in social, technological, economic, ecological, 
and political/regulatory forces. Each of these forces can affect the organization in both 
direct and indirect ways. For example, the outbreak of SARS (severe acute respiratory 
syndrome) directly affected the demand uncertainty for tourism, airline, and other 
industries in Singapore, Hong Kong, Beijing, and Toronto. Cathay Pacific and Singapore 
Airlines had to ground much of their fleet as demand plummeted. The general environ￾ment also can affect organizations indirectly by virtue of the linkages between external 
agents. Any business that was dependent on tourism or travel, such as restaurants, 
hotels, and museums, was also affected by the SARS outbreak. Similarly, an organiza￾tion may have trouble obtaining raw materials from a supplier because a national union 
is grieving a management policy, a government regulator is bringing a lawsuit, or a 
consumer group is boycotting their products. Thus, components of the general environ￾ment can affect the organization without having any direct connection to it.
An organization’s task environment or industry structure is another important input 
into strategic orientation. Michael Porter defines an organization’s task environment 
by five forces: supplier power, buyer power, threats of substitutes, threats of entry, and 
rivalry among competitors.10 First, strategic orientations must be sensitive to powerful 
suppliers who can increase prices (and therefore lower profits) or force the organiza￾tion to pay more attention to the supplier’s needs than to the organization’s needs. 
For example, unions represent powerful suppliers of labor that can affect the costs 
of any organization within an industry. Second, strategic orientations must be sensi￾tive to powerful buyers. Powerful retailers, such as Wal-Mart and Costco, can force 
Procter & Gamble, Johnson & Johnson, or other suppliers to lower prices or deliver CHAPTER 5 Diagnosing Organizations 95
their products in particular ways. Third, strategic orientations must be sensitive to the 
threat of new firms entering into competition. Profits in the restaurant business tend to 
be low because of the ease of starting a new restaurant. Fourth, strategic orientations 
must be sensitive to the threat of new products or services that can replace existing 
offerings. Ice cream producers must carefully monitor their costs and prices because 
it is easy for a consumer to purchase frozen yogurt or other types of desserts instead. 
Finally, strategic orientations must be sensitive to rivalry among existing competitors. 
If many organizations are competing for the same customers, for example, then the 
strategic orientation must monitor product offerings, costs, and structures carefully if 
the organization is to survive and prosper. Together, these forces play an important role 
in determining the success of an organization, whether it is a manufacturing or service 
firm, a nonprofit organization, or a government agency.
In addition to understanding what inputs are at work, the environment can be 
understood in terms of its rate of change and complexity.11 The rate of change in an 
organization’s general environment or industry structure can be characterized along a 
dynamic–static continuum. Dynamic environments change rapidly and unpredictably 
and suggest that the organization adopt a flexible strategic orientation. Dynamic envi￾ronments are high in uncertainty compared to static environments that do not change 
frequently or dramatically. The complexity of the environment refers to the number of 
important elements in the general environment and industry structure. For example, 
software development organizations face dynamic and complex environments. Not 
only do technologies, regulations, customers, and suppliers change rapidly, but all of 
them are important to the firm’s survival. On the other hand, manufacturers of glass 
jars face more stable and less complex environments.
While general environments and task environments describe the specific, objective 
pressures an organization faces, the organization must first recognize those pressures. 
The enacted environment consists of the organization members’ perception and repre￾sentation of its general and task environments. Weick suggested that environments 
must be perceived before they can influence decisions about how to respond to them.12
Organization members must actively observe, register, and make sense of the environ￾ment before it can affect their decisions about what actions to take. Thus, only the 
enacted environment can affect which organizational responses are chosen. The general 
and task environments, however, can influence whether those responses are successful 
or ineffective. For example, members may perceive customers as relatively satisfied with 
their products and may decide to make only token efforts at developing new products. 
If those perceptions are wrong and customers are dissatisfied with the products, the 
meager product development efforts can have disastrous organizational consequences. 
As a result, an organization’s enacted environment should accurately reflect its general 
and task environments if members’ decisions and actions are to be effective.
Environmental Dimensions Environments also can be characterized along dimen￾sions that describe the organization’s context and influence its responses. One perspec￾tive views environments as information flows and suggests that organizations need to 
process information to discover how to relate to their environments.13 The key dimen￾sion of the environment affecting information processing is information uncertainty, or 
the degree to which environmental information is ambiguous. Organizations seek to 
remove uncertainty from the environment so that they know best how to transact 
with it. For example, organ izations may try to discern customer needs through focus 
groups and surveys and attempt to understand competitor strategies through press 
releases, sales force behaviors, and knowledge of key personnel. The greater the 
uncertainty, the more information processing is required to learn about the environ￾ment. This is particularly evident when environments are complex and rapidly chang￾ing. These kinds of environments pose difficult information processing problems for 96 PART 2 The Process of Organization Development
organizations. For example, global competition, technological change, and financial 
markets have created highly uncertain and complex environments for many multina￾tional firms and have severely strained their information processing capacity.
Another perspective views environments as consisting of resources for which 
organizations compete.14 The key environmental dimension is resource dependence, 
or the degree to which an organization relies on other organizations for resources. 
Organizations seek to manage critical sources of resource dependence while remaining 
as autonomous as possible. For example, firms may contract with several suppliers of 
the same raw material so that they are not overly dependent on one vendor. Resource 
dependence is extremely high for an organization when other organizations control 
critical resources that cannot be obtained easily elsewhere. Resource criticality and 
availability determine the extent to which an organization is dependent on the envi￾ronment and must respond to its demands. An example is the tight labor market for 
information systems experts experienced by many firms in the late 1990s.
These two environmental dimensions—information uncertainty and resource depen￾dence—can be combined to show the degree to which organizations are constrained 
by their environments and consequently must be responsive to their demands.15 As 
shown in Figure 5.3 organizations have the most freedom from external forces when 
information uncertainty and resource dependence are both low. In such situations, 
organizations do not need to respond to their environments and can behave relatively 
independently of them. U.S. automotive manufacturers faced these conditions in the 
1950s and operated with relatively little external constraint or threat. Organizations are 
more constrained and must be more responsive to external demands as information 
uncertainty and resource dependence increase. They must perceive the environment 
accurately and respond to it appropriately. As described in Chapter 1, organizations 
such as financial institutions, high-technology firms, and health care facilities are fac￾ing unprecedented amounts of environmental uncertainty and resource dependence. 
Their existence depends on recognizing external challenges and responding quickly and 
appropriately to them.
Design Components
Figure 5.2(A) shows that a strategic orientation is composed of five major design com￾ponents—strategy, technology, structure, measurement systems, and human resources 
systems—and an intermediate output—culture. Effective organizations align their 
design components to each other and to the environment.
A strategy represents the way an organization uses its resources (human, economic, 
or technical) to achieve its goals and gain a competitive advantage.16 It can be described 
by the organization’s mission, goals and objectives, strategic intent, and functional 
policies. A mission statement describes the long-term purpose of the organization, the 
range of products or services offered, the markets to be served, and the social needs 
served by the organization’s existence. Goals and objectives are statements that provide 
explicit direction, set organization priorities, provide guidelines for management deci￾sions, and serve as the cornerstone for organizing activities, designing jobs, and setting 
standards of achievement. Goals and objectives should set a target of achievement 
(such as 50% gross margins, an average employee satisfaction score of 4 on a 5-point 
scale, or some level of productivity); provide a means or system for measuring achieve￾ment; and provide a deadline or time frame for accomplishment.17
A strategic intent is a succinct label or metaphor that describes how the organ ization 
intends to leverage five dimensions of strategy to achieve its goals and objectives. 
For example, Starbucks’ metaphorical strategic intent can be described as “creating 
great experiences.” Great experiences are created combining five points of strategic 
intent. First, they create great experiences by shifting the breadth of coffees, drinks, CHAPTER 5 Diagnosing Organizations 97
food, music, and other offerings. Second, they can alter the aggressiveness with which 
they promote themselves or develop new products/services. Third, Starbucks empha￾sizes certain points of differentiation, such as price, quality, service, and surroundings 
to distinguish themselves from the competition. Fourth, they must orchestrate their 
short-term goals with long-term plans, and finally, they can adjust the economic logic
they use to generate revenues and hold down costs.18 Finally, functional policies are 
the methods, procedures, rules, or administrative practices that guide decision making 
and convert plans into actions. In the semiconductor business, for example, Intel had 
a policy of allocating about 30% of revenues to research and development to maintain 
its lead in microprocessors production.
Technology is concerned with the way an organization converts inputs into products 
and services. It represents the core transformation process and includes production 
methods, work flow, and equipment. Automobile companies have traditionally used 
an assembly line technology to build cars and trucks. Two features of the technological 
core have been shown to influence other design components: technical interdepen￾dence and technical uncertainty.19 Technical interdependence involves ways in which 
the different parts of a technological system are related. High interdependence requires 
considerable coordination among tasks, such as might occur when departments must 
work together to bring out a new product. Technical uncertainty refers to the amount 
of information processing and decision making required during task performance. 
Generally, when tasks require high amounts of information processing and decision 
making, they are difficult to plan and routinize. The technology of car manufacturing is 
relatively certain and moderately interdependent. As a result, automobile manufactur￾ers can specify in advance the behaviors workers should exhibit and how their work 
should be coordinated.
The structural system describes how attention and resources are focused on task 
accomplishment. It represents the basic organizing mode chosen to (1) divide the overall

to environmentwork of an organization into subunits that can assign tasks to individuals or groups and 
(2) coordinate these subunits for completion of the overall work.20 Structure, therefore, 
needs to be closely aligned with the organization’s technology.
Two ways of determining how an organization divides work are to examine its for￾mal structure or to examine its level of differentiation and integration. Formal struc￾tures divide work by function (accounting, sales, or production), by product or service 
(Chevrolet, Buick, or Pontiac), by customer (large, medium, or small enterprise), or by 
some combination of both (a matrix composed of functional departments and prod￾uct groupings). These are described in more detail in Chapter 14. The second way to 
describe how work is divided is to specify the amount of differentiation and integra￾tion there is in a structure. Applied to the total organization, differentiation refers to 
the degree of similarity or difference in the design of two or more subunits or depart￾ments.21 In a highly differentiated organization, there are major differences in design 
among the departments. Some departments are highly formalized with many rules 
and regulations, others have few rules and regulations, and still others are moderately 
formal or flexible.
The way an organization coordinates the work across subunits is called integration. 
Integration is achieved through a variety of lateral mechanisms, such as plans and sched￾ules, budgets, project managers, liaison positions, integrators, cross- departmental task 
forces, and matrix relationships.22 The amount of integration required in a structure is 
a function of (1) the amount of uncertainty in the environment, (2) the level of differ￾entiation in the structure, and (3) the amount of interdependence among departments. 
As uncertainty, differentiation, and interdependence increase, more sophisticated inte￾gration devices are required.
Measurement systems are methods of gathering, assessing, and disseminating infor￾mation on the activities of groups and individuals in organizations. Such data tell how 
well the organization is performing and are used to detect and control deviations from 
goals. Closely related to structural integration, measurement systems monitor organi￾zational operations and feed data about work activities to managers and members so 
that they can better understand current performance and coordinate work. Effective 
information and control systems clearly are linked to strategic objectives; provide accu￾rate, understandable, and timely information; are accepted as legitimate by organization 
members; and produce benefits in excess of their cost.
Human resources systems include mechanisms for selecting, developing, appraising, 
and rewarding organization members. These influence the mix of skills, personalities, 
and behaviors of organization members. The strategy and technology provide important 
information about the skills and knowledge required if the organization is to be success￾ful. Appraisal processes identify whether those skills and knowledge are being applied 
to the work, and reward systems complete the cycle by recognizing performance that 
contributes to goal achievement. Reward systems may be tied to measurement systems 
so that rewards are allocated on the basis of measured results. (Specific human resources 
systems, such as rewards and career development, are discussed in Chapters 17 and 18.)
Organization culture is the final design component. It represents the basic assump￾tions, values, and norms shared by organization members.23 Those cultural elements 
are generally taken for granted and serve to guide members’ perceptions, thoughts, 
and actions. For example, McDonald’s culture emphasizes efficiency, speed, and con￾sistency. It orients employees to company goals and suggests the kinds of behaviors 
necessary for success. In Figure 5.2(A), culture is shown as an intermediate output 
from the five other design components because it represents both an outcome and a 
constraint. It is an outcome of the organization’s history and environment24 as well 
as of prior choices made about the strategy, technology, structure, measurement sys￾tems, and human resources systems. It is also a constraint in that it is more difficult 
to change than the other components. In that sense, it can either hinder or facilitate 
98 PART 2 The Process of Organization DevelopmentCHAPTER 5 Diagnosing Organizations
change. In diagnosis, the interest is in understanding the current culture well enough 
to determine its alignment with the other design factors. Such information may partly 
explain current outcomes, such as performance or effectiveness. (Culture is discussed 
in more detail in Chapter 20.)
Outputs
The outputs of a strategic orientation can be classified into three components. First, 
organization performance refers to financial outputs such as sales, profits, return on 
investment (ROI), and earnings per share (EPS). For nonprofit and government agen￾cies, performance often refers to the extent to which costs were lowered or budgets 
met. Second, productivity concerns internal measurements of efficiency, such as sales 
per employee, waste, error rates, quality, or units produced per hour. Third, stake￾holder satisfaction reflects how well the organization has met the expectations of 
different groups. Customer satisfaction can be measured in terms of market share or 
focus-group data; employee satisfaction can be measured in terms of an opinion sur￾vey; investor satisfaction can be measured in terms of stock price or analyst opinions.
Alignment
The effectiveness of an organization’s current strategic orientation requires knowledge of 
the above information to determine the alignment among the different elements.
Does the organization’s strategic orientation fit with the inputs? For example, 
the organization’s products and services should respond to real needs or demands in 
the environment. Similarly, the organization should be designed in such a way that 
it supports general environmental demands, such as operating in an ecologically 
sustainable manner.
Do the design components fit with each other? For example, if the elements of 
the external environment (inputs) are fairly similar in their degree of certainty, then 
an effective organization structure (design factor) should have a low degree of dif￾ferentiation. Its departments should be designed similarly because each faces similar 
environmental demands. On the other hand, if the environment is complex and each 
element presents different amounts of uncertainty, a more differentiated structure is 
warranted. Chevron Oil Company’s regulatory, ecological, technological, and social 
environments differ greatly in their amount of uncertainty. The regulatory environ￾ment is relatively slow paced and detail oriented. Accordingly, the regulatory affairs 
function within Chevron is formal and bound by protocol. On the other hand, in the 
technological environment, new methods for discovering, refining, and distributing 
oil and oil products are evolving at a rapid pace. Those departments are much more 
flexible and adaptive, very different from the regulatory affairs function.
Analysis
Application 5.1 describes the Steinway organization and provides an opportunity to 
perform the following organization-level analysis.25 A useful starting point is to ask how 
well the organization is currently functioning. Steinway has excellent market shares 
in the high-quality segment of the grand piano market, a string of improving financial 
measures, and strong customer loyalty. However, the data on employee satisfaction are 
mixed (there are both long-tenured people and an indication that workers are leav￾ing for other jobs), and the financial improvements appear modest when contrasted 
with the industry averages. Understanding the underlying causes of these effectiveness 
issues begins with an assessment of the inputs and strategic orientation and then pro￾ceeds to an evaluation of the alignments among the different parts. In diagnosing the 
inputs, two questions are important.

99Steinway’s Strategic Orientation
Steinway & Sons, which turned 150 years old in 
April 2003, is generally regarded as the finest 
piano maker in the world. Founded in 1853 by 
the Steinway family, the firm was sold to CBS in 
1972, taken private in 1985 by John and Robert 
Birmingham, and sold again in 1995 to Dana 
Messina and Kyle Kirkland, who took it public 
in 1996. Steinway & Sons is the piano division 
of the Steinway Musical Instruments Company 
that also owns Selmer Instruments and other 
manufacturers of band instruments (http://www.
steinwaymusical.com). Piano sales in 2002 were 
$169 million, down 7.6% from the prior year 
and mirroring the general economic downturn. 
Since going public, Steinway’s corporate revenues 
have grown a compounded 6–7% a year, while 
EPS have advanced, on average, a compounded 
11%. The financial performance for the overall 
company in 2002 was slightly below industry 
averages.
The Steinway brand remains one of the company’s 
most valuable assets. The company’s president 
notes that despite only 2% of all keyboard unit 
sales in the United States, they have 25% of the 
sales dollars and 35% of the profits. Their market 
share in the high-end grand piano segment is 
consistently over 80%. For example, 98% of the 
piano soloists at 30 of the world’s major sym￾phony orchestras chose a Steinway grand during 
the 2000/2001 concert season. Over 1,300 of the 
world’s top pianists, all of whom own Steinways 
and perform solely on Steinways, endorse the 
brand without financial compensation.
Workers at Steinway & Sons manufacturing plants 
in New York and Germany have been with the 
company for an average of 15 years, often over 
20 or 30 years. Many of Steinway’s employees 
are descendants of parents and grandparents who 
worked for the company.
The External Environment
The piano market is typically segmented into grand 
pianos and upright pianos, with the former being a 
smaller but higher-priced segment. In 1995, about 
550,000 upright pianos and 50,000 grand pianos were 
sold. Piano customers can also be segmented into 
professional artists, amateur pianists, and institutions 
such as concert halls, universities, and music schools. 
The private (home) market accounts for about 90% 
of the upright piano sales and 80% of the grand 
piano sales, with the balance being sold to institu￾tional customers. New markets in Asia represent 
important new growth opportunities.
The piano industry has experienced several 
important and dramatic changes for such a tradi￾tional product. Industry sales, for example, dropped 
40% between 1980 and 1995. Whether the decline 
was the result of increased electronic keyboard 
sales, a real decline in the total market, or some 
temporary decline was a matter of debate in the 
industry. Since then, sales growth has tended to 
reflect the ups and downs of the global economy.
Competition in the piano industry has also changed. 
In the United States, several hundred piano makers 
at the turn of the century had consolidated to 
eight by 1992. The Baldwin Piano and Organ 
Company is Steinway’s primary U.S. competitor. It 
offers a full line of pianos under the Baldwin and 
Wurlitzer brand names through a network of over 
700 dealers. In addition to relatively inexpensive 
upright pianos produced in high-volume plants, 
Baldwin also makes handcrafted grand pianos that 
are well respected and endorsed by such artists 
as Dave Brubeck and Stephen Sondheim, and by 
the Boston, Chicago, and Philadelphia orches￾tras. Annual sales are in the $100 million range; 
Baldwin was recently sold to the Gibson Guitar 
Company. The European story is similar. Only 
Bösendorfer of Austria and Fazioli of Italy remain 
as legitimate Steinway competitors.
Several Asian companies have emerged as impor￾tant competitors. Yamaha, Kawai, Young Chang, 
and Samick collectively held about 35% of the 
vertical piano market and 80% of the grand piano 
market in terms of units and 75% of global sales in 
1995. Yamaha is the world’s largest piano manu￾facturer with sales of over $1 billion and a global 
market share of about 35%. Yamaha’s strategy has 
been to produce consistent piano quality through 
continuous improvement. A separate handcrafted 
concert grand piano operation has also tried to use 
continuous improvement methods to create con￾sistently high-quality instruments. More than any 
other high-quality piano manufacturer, Yamaha 
has been able to emulate and compete with 
Steinway.
application 5.1CHAPTER 5 Diagnosing Organizations 101
The Steinway Organization
Steinway & Sons offers several different pianos, 
including two brands (Steinway and the less 
expensive Boston brand) and both upright and 
grand piano models. The company handcrafts its 
grand pianos in New York and Germany, and sells 
them through more than 200 independent dealers. 
About half of the dealers are in North and South 
America and approximately 85% of all Steinway 
pianos are sold through this network. The company 
also owns seven retail outlets in New York, New 
Jersey, London, Munich, Hamburg, and Berlin.
The dealer network is an important part of Steinway’s 
strategy because of its role in the “concert bank” 
program. Once artists achieve a certain status, they 
are invited to become part of this elite group. The 
performer can go to any local dealer, try out differ￾ent pianos, and pick the one they want to use at a 
performance for only the cost of bringing the piano 
to the concert hall. The concert bank contains over 
300 pianos in more than 160 cities. In return for 
the service, Steinway is given exclusive use of the 
performer’s name for publicity purposes.
Creating a Steinway concert grand piano is an art, an 
intricate and timeless operation (although alternate 
methods have been created and improved, the basic 
process hasn’t changed much). It requires more than 
12,000 mostly handcrafted parts and more than 
a little magic. The tone, touch, and sound of each 
instrument is unique, and 120 technical patents 
and innovations contribute to the Steinway sound. 
Two years are required to make a Steinway grand as 
opposed to a mass-produced piano that takes only 
about 20 days. There are three major steps in the 
production process: wood drying (which takes about 
a year), parts making, and piano making.
Wood-drying operations convert moisture-rich 
lumber into usable raw material through air￾drying and computer-controlled kilns. Time is a 
critical element in this process because slow and 
natural drying is necessary to ensure the best 
sound-producing qualities of the wood. Even after 
all the care of the drying process, the workers reject 
approximately 50% of the lumber.
After drying, the parts-making operations begin. 
The first of these operations involves bending of the 
piano rim (the curved side giving a grand piano its 
familiar shape). These rims are formed of multiple 
layers of specially selected maple that are manually 
forced into a unified shape, held in presses for several 
hours, and then seasoned for 10 weeks before being 
joined to other wooden parts. During this time, the 
sounding board (a specially tapered Alaska Sitka 
spruce panel placed inside the rim to amplify the 
sound) and many other case parts are made. The 
final critical operation with parts making involves 
the fabrication of the 88 individual piano action 
sets that exist inside a piano. Piano “actions” are 
the intricate mechanical assemblies—made almost 
completely of wood and some felt, metal, and 
leather—that transmit finger pressure on the piano 
keys into the force that propels the hammers that 
strike the strings. The action is a particularly impor￾tant part of a piano because this mechanical linkage 
gives Steinways their distinctive feel. In the action 
department, each operator was responsible for 
inspecting his or her own work, with all assembled 
actions further subject to 100% inspection.
Piano-making operations include “bellying,” fin￾ishing, and tone regulating. The bellying process 
involves the precise and careful fitting of the 
soundboard, iron piano plate, and rim to each 
other. It requires workers to lean their stomachs 
against the rim of the piano to complete this task. 
Because of individual variations in material and 
the high degree of precision required, bellying 
takes considerable skill and requires several hours 
per piano. After the bellying operations, pianos 
are strung and moved to the finishing department. 
During finishing, actions and keyboards are indi￾vidually fit to each instrument to accommodate 
differences in materials and tolerances to produce 
a working instrument. The final piano-making 
step involves tone regulating. Here, the pianos 
are “voiced” for Steinway sound. Unlike tuning, 
which involves the loosening and tightening of 
strings, voicing requires careful adjustments to 
the felt surrounding the hammers that strike the 
strings. This operation is extremely delicate and is 
performed by only a small handful of tone regula￾tors. The tone regulators at Steinway are widely 
considered to be among the most skilled artisans 
in the factory. Their voicing of a concert grand can 
take as much as 20 to 30 hours. All tone regulators 
at Steinway have worked for the company in vari￾ous other positions before reaching their present 
posts, and several have more than 20 years with 
the firm. Finally, after tone regulation, all pianos 
are polished, cleaned, and inspected one last time 
before packing and shipment.
Steinway produced more than 3,500 pianos in 2002 
at its New York and Hamburg, Germany, plants. 102
Almost 430 people work in the New York plant and 
all but about 100 of them work in production. They 
are represented by the United Furniture Worker’s 
union. Seventy-five percent of the workers are paid 
on a straight-time basis; the remainder, primarily 
artisans, are paid on piece rates. Keeping workers has 
proved increasingly difficult as well-trained Steinway 
craftspeople are coveted by other manufacturers, 
and many of the workers could easily set up their 
own shop to repair or rebuild older Steinway pianos. 
Excess inventories due to weak sales both pre- and 
post-September 11 forced Steinway to adjust its 
production schedule; workers in its New York plant 
reported to work every other week rather than lay 
off the highly skilled workers needed to build its 
pianos.
What is the company’s general environment? Steinway’s external environ￾ment is only moderately uncertain and not very complex. Socially, Steinway is an 
important part of a country’s artistic culture and the fine arts. It must be aware of 
fickle trends in music and display an appropriate sensitivity to them. Politically, 
the organization operates on a global basis and so must be attuned to different 
governmental and country requirements in its distribution and sales networks. The 
manufacturing plant in Hamburg, Germany, suggests an important political depen￾dency that must be monitored. Technologically, Steinway appears reasonably 
concerned about the latest breakthroughs in piano design, materials, and construc￾tion. They are aware of alternative technologies, such as the assembly line process 
at Yamaha, but prefer the classic methods they have always used. Ecologically, 
Steinway must be mindful. Their product requires lumber and they are very picky 
(some would say wasteful) about the choices, rejecting many pieces. It is likely 
that environmentalists would express concern over how Steinway uses this natural 
resource. Together, these environmental forces paint a relatively moderate level 
of uncertainty. Most of these issues are knowable and can be forecast with some 
confidence. In addition, while there are several environmental elements that need 
to be addressed, not all of them are vitally important. The environment is not very 
complex.
What is the company’s task environment? Steinway’s industry is moder￾ately competitive and profit pressures can be mapped by looking at five key 
forces. First, the threat of entry is fairly low. There are some important barriers 
to cross if an organization wanted to get into the piano business. For example, 
Steinway, Yamaha, and Baldwin have very strong brands and dealer networks. 
Any new entrant would need to overcome these strong images to get people to 
buy their product. Second, the threat of substitute products is moderate. On the 
one hand, electronic keyboards have made important advances and represent 
an inexpensive alternative to grand and upright pianos. On the other hand, the 
sophisticated nature of many of the artists and audiences suggests that there are 
not many substitutes for a concert grand piano. Third, the bargaining power of 
suppliers, such as providers of labor and raw materials, is high. The labor union 
has effective control over the much-sought-after craft workers who manufacture 
and assemble grand pianos. Given the relatively difficult time that most high-end 
piano manufacturers have in holding onto these highly trained employees, the 
1.
2.
102 PART 2 The Process of Organization DevelopmentCHAPTER 5 Diagnosing Organizations 103
organization must expend considerable resources to retain them. Similarly, given 
the critical nature of wood to the final product, lumber suppliers can probably 
exert significant influence. Fourth, the bargaining power of buyers varies by 
segment. In the high-end segment, the number of buyers is relatively small and 
sophisticated, and the small number of high-quality pianos means that customers 
can put pressure on prices although they are clearly willing and able to pay more 
for quality. In the middle and lower segments, the number of buyers is much 
larger and fragmented. It is unlikely that they could collectively exert influence 
over price. Finally, the rivalry among firms is severe. A number of well-known 
and well-funded domestic and international competitors exist. Almost all of them 
have adopted marketing and manufacturing tactics similar to Steinway’s in the 
high-end segment, and they are competing for the same customers. The extensive 
resources available to Yamaha as a member of their keiretsu, for example, sug￾gest that it is a strong and long-term competitor that will work hard to unseat 
Steinway from its position. Thus, powerful buyers and suppliers as well as keen 
competition make the piano industry only moderately attractive and represent 
the key sources of uncertainty.
The following questions are important in assessing Steinway’s strategic orientation:
What is the company’s strategy? Steinway’s primary strategy is a sophisticated 
niche and differentiation strategy. They attempt to meet their financial and other 
objectives by offering a unique and high-quality product to sophisticated artists. 
However, its product line does blur the strategy’s focus. With both Boston and 
Steinway brands and both upright and grand models, a question about Steinway’s 
commitment to the niche strategy could be raised. No formal mission or goals are 
mentioned in the case and this makes it somewhat difficult to judge the effective￾ness of the strategy. But it seems reasonable to assume a clear intent to maintain its 
dominance in the high-end segment. However, with new owners in 1995, it is also 
reasonable to question whether goals of profitability or revenue growth, implying 
very different tactics, have been sorted out.
What are the company’s technology, structure, measurement systems, and 
human resources systems? First, Steinway’s core technology is highly uncertain 
and moderately interdependent. The manufacturing process is craft based and 
dependent on the nature of the materials. Each piano is built and adjusted with 
the specific characteristics of the wood in mind. So much so that each piano has 
a different sound that is produced as a result of the manufacturing process. The 
technology is moderately interdependent because the major steps in the process 
are not linked in time. Making the “action sets” is independent of the “bellying” 
process, for example. Similarly, the key marketing program, the concert bank, is 
independent of manufacturing. Second, the corporate organization is divisional 
(pianos and band instruments), while the piano subsidiary appears to have a func￾tional structure. The key functions are manufacturing, distribution, and sales. A 
procurement, finance, and human resources group is also reasonable to assume. 
Third, formal measurement systems within the production process are clearly pres￾ent. There are specific mentions of inspections by both the worker and the orga￾nization. For example, 100% inspection (as opposed to statistical sampling) costs 
time and manpower and no doubt is seen as critical to quality. In addition, there 
must be some system of keeping track of work-in-progress, finished goods, and 
concert bank system inventories. Fourth, the human resources system is highly 
developed. The reward system includes both hourly and piece rate processes; the 
union relationships; worker retention programs; and global hiring, compensation, 
benefits, and training programs.
1.
2.104 PART 2 The Process of Organization Development
What is Steinway’s culture? While there is little specific information, Steinway’s 
culture can be inferred. The dominant focus on the high-end segment, the craft 
nature of the production process, the importance of the concert bank program, and 
the long history of family influence all point to culture of quality, craftsmanship, 
and responsiveness. These values are manifest in the way the organization chooses 
its raw materials, the way it caters to its prized customers, the care in the produc￾tion process, and the image it works to retain.
Now that the organization inputs, design components, and outputs have been 
assessed, it is time to ask the crucial question about how well they fit together. The first 
concern is the fit between the environmental inputs and the strategic orientation. The 
moderate complexity and uncertainty in the general environment argue for a strategy 
that is flexible enough to address the few critical dependencies but formal enough to 
control. Its focus on the high-end segment of the industry and the moderate breadth 
in its product line support this flexibility. On the one hand, the flexible and responsive 
manufacturing process supports and defends its preeminence as the top grand piano in 
the world. On the other hand, this also mitigates the powerful buyer forces in this seg￾ment. Its moderate product line breadth gives it some flexibility and efficiency as well. 
It can achieve some production efficiencies in the upright and medium-market grand 
piano segments, and its brand image helps in marketing these products. The alignment 
between its strategic orientation and its environment appears sound.
The second concern is the alignment of the design components. With respect to 
strategy, the individual elements of Steinway’s strategy are mostly aligned. Steinway 
clearly intends to differentiate its product by serving the high-end segment with unique 
high-quality pianos. But a broad product line (both uprights and grands as well as two 
brand names) could dilute the focus. The market for higher-priced and more special￾ized concert grands is much smaller than the market for moderately priced uprights 
and limits the growth potential of sales unless Steinway wants to compete vigorously 
in the emerging Asian markets where the Asian companies have a proximity advan￾tage. That hypothesis is supported by the lack of clear goals in general and policies 
that support neither growth nor profitability. However, there appears to be a good fit 
between strategy and the other design components. The differentiated strategic intent 
requires technologies, structures, and systems that focus on creating sophisticated and 
unique products, specialized marketing and distribution, and the concert bank pro￾gram. The flexible structure, formal inspection systems, and responsive culture would 
seem well suited for that purpose.
The technology appears well supported and aligned with the structure. The pro￾duction process is craft based and deliberately ambiguous. The functional structure 
promotes specialization and professionalization of skills and knowledge. Specific tasks 
that require flexibility and adaptability from the organization are given a wide berth. 
Although a divisional structure overlays Steinway’s corporate activities, the piano 
division’s structure is functional but not rigid, and there appears to be a cultural will￾ingness to be responsive to the craft and the artists they serve. In addition, the concert 
bank program is important for two reasons. First, it builds loyalty into the customer 
and ensures future demand. Second, it is a natural source of feedback on the instru￾ments themselves, keeping the organization close to the artist’s demands and emerging 
trends in sound preferences. Finally, the well-developed human resources system sup￾ports the responsive production and marketing functions as well as the global nature 
of the enterprise.
Steinway’s culture of quality and responsiveness promotes coordination among the 
production tasks, serves as a method for socializing and developing people, and estab￾lishes methods for moving information around the organization. Clearly, any change 
effort at Steinway will have to acknowledge this role and design an intervention

accordingly. The strong culture will either sabotage or facilitate change depending on 
how the change process aligns with the culture’s impact on individual behavior.
Based on this diagnosis of the Steinway organization, at least two intervention 
possibilities are suggested. First, in collaboration with the client, the OD practitioner 
could suggest increasing Steinway’s clarity about its strategy. In this intervention, the 
practitioner would want to talk about formalizing—rather than changing—Steinway’s 
strategy because the culture would resist such an attempt. However, there are some 
clear advantages to be gained from a clearer sense of Steinway’s future goals, its busi￾nesses, and the relationships among them. Second, Steinway could focus on increasing 
the integration and coordination of its structure, measurement systems, and human 
resources systems. The difficulty of retaining key production personnel warrants 
continuously improved retention systems as well as efforts to codify and retain key 
production knowledge in case workers do leave. This would apply to the marketing 
and distribution functions as well since they control an important interface with the 
customer.
SUMMARY
This chapter presented background information for diagnosing organizations, groups, 
and individual jobs. Diagnosis is a collaborative process, involving both managers and 
consultants in collecting pertinent data, analyzing them, and drawing conclusions for 
action planning and intervention. Diagnosis may be aimed at discovering the causes of 
specific problems, or it may be directed at assessing the organization or department to 
find areas for future development. Diagnosis provides the necessary practical under￾standing to devise interventions for solving problems and improving organization 
effectiveness.
Diagnosis is based on conceptual frameworks about how organizations function. 
Such diagnostic models serve as road maps by identifying areas to examine and ques￾tions to ask in determining how an organization or department is operating.
The comprehensive model presented here views organizations as open systems. 
The organization serves to coordinate the behaviors of its departments. It is open to 
exchanges with the larger environment and is influenced by external forces. As open 
systems, organizations are hierarchically ordered; that is, they are composed of groups, 
which in turn are composed of individual jobs. Organizations also display six key open 
systems properties: environments; inputs, transformations, and outputs; boundaries; 
feedback; equifinality; and alignment.
An organization-level diagnostic model was described and applied. It consists of 
environmental inputs; a set of design components called a strategic orientation; and 
a variety of outputs, such as performance, productivity, and stakeholder satisfaction. 
Diagnosis involves understanding each of the parts in the model and then assess￾ing how the elements of the strategic orientation align with each other and with the 
inputs. Organization effectiveness is likely to be high when there is good alignment.

Figure 6.1 replicates the comprehensive model introduced in Chapter 5 but highlights 
the group and individual-level models. It shows the inputs, design components, out￾puts, and relational fits for group-level diagnosis. The model is similar to other popular 
group-level diagnostic models such as Hackman and Morris’s task group design model,1
McCaskey’s framework for analyzing groups,2
 and Ledford, Lawler, and Mohrman’s 
participation group design model.3
Inputs
Organization design is clearly the major input to group design. It consists of the design 
components characterizing the larger organization within which the group is embed￾ded: technology, structure, measurement systems, and human resources systems, 
as well as organization culture. Technology can determine the characteristics of the 
group’s task; structural systems can specify the level of coordination required among 
groups. The human resources and measurement systems, such as performance 
appraisal and reward systems, play an important role in determining team function￾ing.4
 For example, individual-based, forced ranking performance appraisal and reward 
systems tend to interfere with team functioning because members may be concerned 
with maximizing their individual performance to the detriment of team performance. 
Collecting information about the group’s organization design context can greatly 
improve the accuracy of diagnosis.

Diagnosing Groups and Jobs
Chapter 5 introduced diagnosis as the second 
major phase in the general model of planned 
change. Based on open systems theory, a com pre￾hensive diagnostic framework for organ ization-, 
group-, and job-level systems was described. The 
organization-level diagnostic model was elabo￾rated and applied. After the organization level, 
the next two levels of diagnosis are the group 
and job. Many large organizations have groups 
or departments that are themselves relatively 
large, like the operating divisions at Viacom, 
Akzo-Nobel, or United Technologies. Diagnosis 
of large groups can follow the dimensions and 
relational fits applicable to organization-level 
diagnoses. In essence, large groups or depart￾ments operate much like organizations, and 
their functioning can be assessed by diagnosing 
them as organizations.
Small departments and groups, however, can 
behave differently from large organizations; they 
need their own diagnostic models to reflect those 
differences. In the first section of this chapter, 
we discuss the diagnosis of work groups. Such 
groups generally consist of a relatively small 
number of people working face-to-face on a 
shared task. Work groups are prevalent in all 
sizes of organizations. They can be relatively 
permanent and perform an ongoing function, or 
they can be temporary and exist only to perform 
a certain task or to make a specific decision.
Finally, we describe and apply a diagnostic 
model of an individual job—the smallest unit 
of analysis in organizations. An individual job 
is constructed to perform a specific task or 
set of tasks. How jobs are designed can affect 
individual and organizational effectiveness.108 PART 2 The Process of Organization Development
Design Components
Figure 6.1(B) shows that groups have five major components: goal clarity, task struc￾ture, group composition, team functioning, and performance norms.
Goal clarity involves how well the group understands its objectives. In general, 
goals should be moderately challenging; there should be a method for measuring,

monitoring, and feeding back information about goal achievement; and the goals 
should be clearly understood by all members.
Task structure is concerned with how the group’s work is designed. Task structures 
can vary along two key dimensions: coordination of members’ efforts and regulation 
of their task behaviors.5
 The coordination dimension involves the degree to which 
group tasks are structured to promote effective interaction among group members. 
Coordination is important in groups performing interdependent tasks, such as surgical 
teams and problem-solving groups. It is relatively unimportant, however, in groups 
composed of members who perform independent tasks, such as a group of telephone 
operators or salespeople. The regulation dimension involves the degree to which mem￾bers can control their own task behaviors and be relatively free from external controls 
such as supervision, plans, and programs. Self-regulation generally occurs when mem￾bers can decide on such issues as task assignments, work methods, production goals, 
and membership. (Interventions for designing group task structure are discussed in 
Chapter 16.)
Group composition concerns the membership of groups. Members can differ on a 
number of dimensions having relevance to group behavior. Demographic variables, 
such as age, education, experience, and skills and abilities, can affect how people 
behave and relate to each other in groups. Demographics can determine whether 
the group is composed of people having task-relevant skills and knowledge, includ￾ing interpersonal skills. People’s internal needs also can influence group behaviors. 
Individual differences in social needs can determine whether group membership is 
likely to be satisfying or stressful.6
Team functioning is the underlying basis of group life. How members relate to each 
other is important in work groups because the quality of relationships can affect task per￾formance. In some groups, for example, interpersonal competition and conflict among 
members result in their providing little support and help for each other. Conversely, 
groups may become too concerned about sharing good feelings and support and spend 
too little time on task performance. In organization development, considerable effort 
has been invested in helping work group members develop healthy interpersonal rela￾tions, including an ability and a willingness to share feelings and perceptions about 
members’ behaviors so that interpersonal problems and task difficulties can be worked 
through and resolved.7
 Group functioning, therefore, involves task-related activities, 
such as advocacy and inquiry; coordinating and evaluating activities; and the group 
maintenance function, which is directed toward holding the group together as a cohe￾sive team and includes encouraging, harmonizing, compromising, setting standards, 
and observing.8
 (Interpersonal interventions are discussed in Chapter 12.)
Performance norms are member beliefs about how the group should perform its task 
and include acceptable levels of performance.9
 Norms derive from interactions among 
members and serve as guides to group behavior. Once members agree on performance 
norms, either implicitly or explicitly, then members routinely perform tasks according 
to those norms. For example, members of problem-solving groups often decide early in 
the life of the group that decisions will be made through voting; voting then becomes a 
routine part of group task behavior. (Interventions aimed at helping groups to develop 
appropriate performance norms are discussed in Chapter 12.)
Outputs
Group effectiveness has two dimensions: performance and quality of work life. 
Performance is measured in terms of the group’s ability to control or reduce costs, 
increase productivity, or improve quality. This is a “hard” measure of effectiveness. 
In addition, effectiveness is indicated by the group member’s quality of work life. It 
concerns work satisfaction, team cohesion, and organizational commitment.110 PART 2 The Process of Organization Development
Fits
The diagnostic model in Figure 6.1(B) shows that group design components must fit 
inputs if groups are to be effective in terms of performance and the quality of work life. 
Research suggests the following fits between the inputs and design dimensions:
Group design should be congruent with the larger organization design. Organization 
structures with low differentiation and high integration should have work groups 
that are composed of highly skilled and experienced members performing highly 
interdependent tasks. Organizations with differentiated structures and formalized 
human resources and information systems should spawn groups that have clear, 
quantitative goals and that support standardized behaviors. Although there is little 
direct research on these fits, the underlying rationale is that congruence between 
organization and group designs supports overall integration within the company. 
When group designs are not compatible with organization designs, groups often 
conflict with the organization.10 They may develop norms that run counter to 
organizational effectiveness, such as occurs in groups supportive of horseplay, 
goldbricking, and other counterproductive behaviors.
When the organization’s technology results in interdependent tasks, coordination 
among members should be promoted by goal clarity, task structure, group compo￾sition, performance norms, and team functioning. Conversely, when technology 
permits independent tasks, the design components should promote individual task 
performance.11 For example, when coordination is needed, task structure might phys￾ically locate related tasks together; group composition might include members with 
similar interpersonal skills and social needs; performance norms would support task￾relevant interactions; and healthy interpersonal relationships would be developed.
3. When the technology is relatively uncertain and requires high amounts of informa￾tion processing and decision making, then task structure, group composition, per￾formance norms, and team functioning should promote self-regulation. Members 
should have the necessary freedom, information, and skills to assign members 
to appropriate tasks, to decide on production methods, and to set performance 
goals.12 When technology is relatively certain, group designs should promote stan￾dardization of behavior, and groups should be externally controlled by supervisors, 
schedules, and plans.13 For example, when self-regulation is needed, task structure 
might be relatively flexible and allow the interchange of members across group 
tasks; composition might include members with multiple skills, interpersonal com￾petencies, and social needs; performance norms would support complex problem 
solving; and efforts would be made to develop healthy interpersonal relations.
Analysis
Application 6.1 presents an example of applying group-level diagnosis to a top￾management team engaged in problem solving.
The group is having a series of ineffective problem-solving meetings. Members 
report a backlog of unresolved issues, poor use of meeting time, lack of follow-through 
and decision implementation, and a general dissatisfaction with the team meetings. 
Examining group inputs and design components and seeing how the two fit can help 
explain the causes of those group problems.
The key issue in diagnosing group inputs is the design of the larger organization within 
which the group is embedded. The Ortiv Glass Corporation’s design is relatively differen￾tiated. Each plant is allowed to set up its own organization design. Similarly, although 
no specific data are given, the company’s technology, structure, measurement systems, 
human resources systems, and culture appear to promote flexible and innovative behav￾iors at the plant level. Indeed, freedom to innovate in the manufacturing plants is prob￾ably an outgrowth of the firm’s OD activities and participative culture.
1.
2.Top-Management Team at Ortiv Glass 
Corporation
The Ortiv Glass Corporation produces and markets 
plate glass for use primarily in the construction 
and automotive industries. The multiplant com￾pany has been involved in OD for several years 
and actively supports participative management 
practices and employee involvement programs. 
Ortiv’s organization design is relatively organic, 
and the manufacturing plants are given freedom 
and encouragement to develop their own organi￾zation designs and approaches to participative 
management. It recently put together a problem￾solving group made up of the top-management 
team at its newest plant.
The team consisted of the plant manager and 
the managers of the five functional departments 
reporting to him: engineering (maintenance), 
administration, human resources, production, and 
quality control. In recruiting managers for the 
new plant, the company selected people with good 
technical skills and experience in their respective 
functions. It also chose people with some mana￾gerial experience and a desire to solve problems 
collaboratively, a hallmark of participative manage￾ment. The team was relatively new, and members 
had been working together for only about five 
months.
The team met formally for two hours each week 
to share pertinent information and to deal with 
plantwide issues affecting all of the departments, 
such as safety procedures, interdepartmental rela￾tions, and personnel practices. Members described 
these meetings as informative but often chaotic in 
terms of decision making. The meetings typically 
started late as members straggled in at different 
times. The latecomers generally offered excuses 
about more pressing problems occurring elsewhere 
in the plant. Once started, the meetings were often 
interrupted by “urgent” phone messages for vari￾ous members, including the plant manager, and in 
most cases the recipient would leave the meeting 
hurriedly to respond to the call.
The group had problems arriving at clear decisions 
on particular issues. Discussions often rambled 
from topic to topic, and members tended to post￾pone the resolution of problems to future meet￾ings. This led to a backlog of unresolved issues, 
and meetings often lasted far beyond the two-hour 
limit. When group decisions were made, members 
often reported problems in their implementation. 
Members typically failed to follow through on 
agreements, and there was often confusion about 
what had actually been agreed upon. Everyone 
expressed dissatisfaction with the team meetings 
and their results.
Relationships among team members were cordial 
yet somewhat strained, especially when the team 
was dealing with complex issues in which mem￾bers had varying opinions and interests. Although 
the plant manager publicly stated that he wanted 
to hear all sides of the issues, he often interrupted 
the discussion or attempted to change the topic 
when members openly disagreed in their views 
of the problem. This interruption was typically 
followed by an awkward silence in the group. In 
many instances, when a solution to a pressing 
problem did not appear forthcoming, members 
either moved on to another issue or they infor￾mally voted on proposed options, letting majority 
rule decide the outcome. Members rarely discussed 
the need to move on or vote; rather, these behav￾iors emerged informally over time and became 
acceptable ways of dealing with difficult issues.
application 6.1112 PART 2 The Process of Organization Development
In the case of decision-making groups such as this one, organization design also 
affects the nature of the issues that are worked on. The team meetings appear to be 
devoted to problems affecting all of the functional departments. This suggests that the 
problems entail high interdependence among the functions; consequently, high coor￾dination among members is needed to resolve them. The team meetings also seem 
to include many issues that are complex and not easily solved, so there is probably a 
relatively high amount of uncertainty in the technology or work process. The causes of 
the problems or acceptable solutions are not readily discernible. Members must process 
considerable information during problem solving, especially when there are different 
perceptions and opinions about the issues.
Diagnosis of the team’s design components answers the following questions:
How clear are the group’s goals? The team’s goals seem relatively clear; they 
are to solve problems. There appears to be no clear agreement, however, on the 
specific problems to be addressed. As a result, members come late because they 
have “more pressing” problems needing attention.
What is the group’s task structure? The team’s task structure includes 
face-to-face interaction during the weekly meetings. That structure allows members 
from different functional departments to come together physically to share infor￾mation and to solve problems mutually affecting them. It facilitates coordination of 
problem solving among the departments in the plant. The structure also seems to 
provide team members with the freedom necessary to regulate their task behaviors 
in the meetings. They can adjust their behaviors and interactions to suit the flow of 
the discussion and problem-solving process.
What is the composition of the group? The team is composed of the plant man￾ager and managers of five functional departments. All members appear to have task￾relevant skills and experience, both in their respective functions and in their manage￾rial roles. They also seem to be interested in solving problems collaboratively. That 
shared interest suggests that members have job-related social needs and should feel 
relatively comfortable in group problem-solving situations.
What are the group’s performance norms? Group norms cannot be observed 
directly but must be inferred from group behaviors. The norms involve member 
beliefs about how the group should perform its task, including acceptable levels 
of performance. A useful way to describe norms is to list specific behaviors that 
complete the sentences “A good group member should . . .” and “It’s okay to . . . .” 
Examination of the team’s problem-solving behaviors suggests the following per￾formance norms are operating in the example:
“It’s okay to come late to team meetings.”
“It’s okay to interrupt meetings with phone messages.”
“It’s okay to leave meetings to respond to phone messages.”
“It’s okay to hold meetings longer than two hours.”
“A good group member should not openly disagree with others’ views.”
“It’s okay to vote on decisions.”
“A good group member should be cordial to other members.”
“It’s okay to postpone solutions to immediate problems.”
“It’s okay not to follow through on previous agreements.”
5. What is the nature of team functioning in the group? The case strongly 
suggests that interpersonal relations are not healthy on the management team. 
Members do not seem to confront differences openly. Indeed, the plant manager 
purposely intervenes when conflicts emerge. Members feel dissatisfied with the 
meetings, but they spend little time talking about those feelings. Relationships are 
strained, but members fail to examine the underlying causes.

•CHAPTER 6 Diagnosing Groups and Jobs 113
The problems facing the team can now be explained by assessing how well the group 
design fits the inputs. The larger organization design of Ortiv is relatively differenti￾ated and promotes flexibility and innovation in its manufacturing plants. The firm 
supports participative management, and the team meetings can be seen as an attempt 
to implement that approach at the new plant. Although it is too early to tell whether 
the team will succeed, there does not appear to be significant incongruity between the 
larger organization design and what the team is trying to do. Of course, team problem 
solving may continue to be ineffective, and the team might revert to a more autocratic 
approach to decision making. In such a case, a serious mismatch between the plant 
management team and the larger company would exist, and conflict between the two 
would likely result.
The team’s issues are highly interdependent and often uncertain, and meetings are 
intended to resolve plantwide problems affecting the various functional departments. 
Those problems are generally complex and require the members to process a great 
deal of information and create innovative solutions. The team’s task structure and 
composition appear to fit the nature of team issues. The face-to-face meetings help 
to coordinate problem solving among the department managers, and except for the 
interpersonal skills, members seem to have the necessary task-relevant skills and expe￾rience to drive the problem-solving process. There appears, however, to be a conflict 
in the priority between the problems to be solved by the team and the problems faced 
by individual managers.
More important, the key difficulty seems to be a mismatch between the team’s per￾formance norms and interpersonal relations and the demands of the problem-solving 
task. Complex, interdependent problems require performance norms that support shar￾ing of diverse and often conflicting kinds of information. The norms must encourage 
members to generate novel solutions and to assess the relevance of problem-solving 
strategies in light of new issues. Members need to address explicitly how they are using 
their knowledge and skills and how they are weighing and combining members’ indi￾vidual contributions.
In our example, the team’s performance norms fail to support complex problem solv￾ing; rather, they promote a problem-solving method that is often superficial, haphazard, 
and subject to external disruptions. Members’ interpersonal relationships reinforce 
adherence to the ineffective norms. Members do not confront personal differences or 
dissatisfactions with the group process. They fail to examine the very norms contributing 
to their problems. In this case, diagnosis suggests the need for group interventions aimed 
at improving performance norms and developing healthy interpersonal relations.
INDIVIDUAL-LEVEL DIAGNOSIS
The final level of organizational diagnosis is the individual job or position. An 
organization consists of numerous groups; a group, in turn, is composed of several 
individual jobs. This section discusses the inputs, design components, and relational 
fits needed for diagnosing jobs. The model shown in Figure 6.1(C) is similar to other 
popular job diagnostic frameworks, such as Hackman and Oldham’s job diagnostic 
survey and Herzberg’s job enrichment model.14
Inputs
Three major inputs affect job design: organization design, group design, and the per￾sonal characteristics of jobholders.
Organization design is concerned with the larger organization within which the indi￾vidual job is the smallest unit. Organization design is a key part of the larger context 
surrounding jobs. Technology, structure, measurement systems, human resources 114
systems, and culture can have a powerful impact on the way jobs are designed and on 
people’s experiences in jobs. For example, company reward systems can orient employ￾ees to particular job behaviors and influence whether people see job performance as 
fairly rewarded. In general, technology characterized by relatively uncertain tasks and 
low interdependency is likely to support job designs allowing employees flexibility and 
discretion in performing tasks. Conversely, low-uncertainty work systems are likely to 
promote standardized job designs requiring routinized task behaviors.15
Group design concerns the larger group or department containing the individual job. 
Like organization design, group design is an essential part of the job context. Task 
structure, goal clarity, group composition, performance norms, and team functioning 
serve as inputs to job design. They typically have a more immediate impact on jobs 
than do the larger, organization design components. For example, group task struc￾ture can determine how individual jobs are grouped together—as in groups requiring 
coordination among jobs or in ones comprising collections of independent jobs. Group 
composition can influence the kinds of people who are available to fill jobs. Group 
performance norms can affect the kinds of job designs that are considered acceptable, 
including the level of jobholders’ performances. Goal clarity helps members to priori￾tize work, and group functioning can affect how powerfully the group influences job 
behaviors. When members maintain close relationships and the group is cohesive, 
group norms are more likely to be enforced and followed.16
Personal characteristics of individuals occupying jobs include their age, education, 
experience, and skills and abilities. All of these can affect job performance as well 
as how people react to job designs. Individual needs and expectations can also affect 
employee job responses. For example, individual differences in growth need—the need 
for self-direction, learning, and personal accomplishment—can determine how much 
people are motivated and satisfied by jobs with high levels of skill variety, autonomy, 
and feedback about results.17 Similarly, work motivation can be influenced by people’s 
expectations that they can perform a job well and that good job performance will result 
in valued outcomes.18
Design Components
Figure 6.1(C) shows that individual jobs have five key dimensions: skill variety, task 
identity, task significance, autonomy, and feedback about results.19
Skill variety identifies the degree to which a job requires a range of activities and 
abilities to perform the work. Assembly line jobs, for example, generally have limited 
skill variety because employees perform a small number of repetitive activities. On 
the other hand, most professional jobs, include a great deal of skill variety because 
people engage in diverse activities and employ several different skills in performing 
their work.
Task identity measures the degree to which a job requires the completion of a 
relatively whole, identifiable piece of work. Skilled craftspeople, such as tool-and-die 
makers and carpenters, generally have jobs with high levels of task identity. They are 
able to see a job through from beginning to end. Assembly line jobs involve only a 
limited piece of work and score low on task identity.
Task significance identifies the degree to which a job has a significant impact on other 
people’s lives. Custodial jobs in a hospital are likely to have more task significance than 
similar jobs in a toy factory because hospital custodians are likely to see their jobs as 
affecting someone else’s health and welfare.
Autonomy indicates the degree to which a job provides freedom and discretion in 
scheduling the work and determining work methods. Assembly line jobs generally 
have little autonomy: The work pace is scheduled, and people perform prepro￾grammed tasks. College teaching positions have more autonomy: Professors usually 
114 PART 2 The Process of Organization DevelopmentCHAPTER 6 Diagnosing Groups and Jobs 115
can determine how a course is taught, even though they may have limited say over 
class scheduling.
Feedback about results involves the degree to which a job provides employees with 
direct and clear information about the effectiveness of task performance. Assembly 
line jobs often provide high levels of feedback about results, whereas college profes￾sors must often contend with indirect and ambiguous feedback about how they are 
performing in the classroom.
Those five job dimensions can be combined into an overall measure of job enrichment. 
Enriched jobs have high levels of skill variety, task identity, task significance, autonomy, 
and feedback about results. They provide opportunities for self-direction, learning, and 
personal accomplishment at work. Many people find enriched jobs internally motivat￾ing and satisfying. (Job enrichment is discussed more fully in Chapter 16.)
Fits
The diagnostic model in Figure 6.1(C) suggests that job design must fit job inputs to 
produce effective job outputs, such as high quality and quantity of individual perfor￾mance, low absenteeism, and high job satisfaction. Research reveals the following fits 
between job inputs and job design:
Job design should be congruent with the larger organization and group designs 
within which the job is embedded.20 Both the organization and the group serve as 
a powerful context for individual jobs or positions. They tend to support and rein￾force particular job designs. Highly differentiated and integrated organizations and 
groups that permit members to self-regulate their behavior fit enriched jobs. These 
larger organizations and groups promote autonomy, flexibility, and innovation at 
the individual job level. Conversely, bureaucratic organizations and groups relying 
on external controls are congruent with job designs scoring low on the five key 
dimensions. Both organizations and groups reinforce standardized, routine jobs. As 
suggested earlier, congruence across different levels of organization design promotes 
integration of the organization, group, and job levels. Whenever the levels do not fit 
each other, conflict is likely to emerge.
2. Job design should fit the personal characteristics of the jobholders if they are to 
perform effectively and derive satisfaction from work. Generally, enriched jobs fit 
people with strong growth needs.21 These people derive satisfaction and accom￾plishment from performing jobs involving skill variety, autonomy, and feedback 
about results. Enriched jobs also fit people possessing moderate to high levels of 
task-relevant skills, abilities, and knowledge. Enriched jobs generally require com￾plex information processing and decision making; people must have comparable 
skills and abilities to perform effectively. Jobs scoring low on the five job dimen￾sions generally fit people with rudimentary skills and abilities and with low growth 
needs. Simpler, more routinized jobs requiring limited skills and experience fit 
better with people who place a low value on opportunities for self-direction and 
learning. In addition, because people can grow through education, training, and 
experience, job design must be monitored and adjusted from time to time.
Analysis
Application 6.2 presents an example of applying individual-level diagnosis to job 
design. The university is considering a change in the job design of a program admin￾istrator. The application provides information about the current job and asks whether 
or not the proposed change makes sense. Examination of the inputs and job design 
features and how the two fit can help to make predictions about the advisability of the 
change.
1.Job Design at Pepperdine University
The Graziadio School of Business and Management 
(GSBM) at Pepperdine University is one of the 
largest business schools in the country and has the 
third largest part-time MBA program. The school 
also provides graduate education aimed at differ￾ent markets including an executive MBA (EMBA), 
a presidential/key executive MBA (PKE), and a 
specialized master’s degree in organization devel￾opment (MSOD). The MSOD program’s curriculum 
consists of 10 four-unit classes over 22 months. 
Eight of the classes are conducted off-site during 
eight-day sessions at both domestic and interna￾tional locations. The MSOD program office consists 
of a faculty director, a program administrator, and 
an administrative assistant. In response to cost-cut￾ting initiatives at the university level, a proposal 
was being considered to alter the job designs of the 
MSOD program staff.
The MSOD Program Administrator, the focus of 
this application, was responsible for marketing and 
recruiting new students, managing the delivery 
logistics of the off-site program, managing the stu￾dents’ registration and financial relationships with 
the university, and maintaining relationships with 
the MSOD alumni. The marketing and recruiting 
duties involved working with the Program Director 
and the Director of Marketing for GSBM to develop 
marketing tactics including advertisements, bro￾chures, conference marketing and support, and 
other market development activities. The recruit￾ing process involved explaining the curriculum to 
prospective applicants, overseeing the application 
process for each applicant, working with the fac￾ulty to have qualified applicants interviewed, and 
managing the admissions process. This too had to 
be coordinated with the director and the admin￾istrative assistant. Once a class was admitted, the 
Program Administrator worked with various off￾site facilities to establish room and board rates and 
catering services; managed the faculty’s travel and 
teaching requirements; managed various interses￾sion activities including the final exam; managed 
the students’ enrollment and graduation proc￾esses including their interface with the university’s 
registrar and finance office and the school’s financial 
aid office; and coached students through the pro￾gram. After graduation, the Program Administrator 
served as an unofficial placement service, hooking 
up eligible graduates with prospective employers 
who called looking for MSOD talent, provided 
career guidance, and worked with the program’s 
alumni organization to sponsor conferences and 
other alumni activities.
Each of the above activities was somewhat program￾mable in that they occurred at specific times of the 
year and could be scheduled. However, because 
each applicant, student, class, or graduate was 
somewhat unique, the specific tasks or actions 
could not always be specified in advance and there 
were a number of exceptions and unique situations 
that arose during each day, month, or year.
The MSOD Program Administrator has worked 
with the MSOD program for over 15 years and 
was a fixture in both the MSOD and the general 
OD communities. Year over year, the Program 
Administrator delivered qualified applicants in 
excess of available space although that task had 
become increasingly difficult in the face of tui￾tion increases, increasingly restrictive corporate 
policies on tuition reimbursement, and the ups 
and downs of the economy. He has handled both 
routine and nonroutine administrative details 
professionally, displays and reports a high level of 
job satisfaction and commitment to the program, 
and has been complimented formally and infor￾mally by the students in the program. In fact, each 
cohort develops its own relationship with the 
administrator and he becomes a de facto member 
of almost every class. The alumni considered the 
Program Administrator a key and integral part of 
the MSOD program. The set of duties described 
above has evolved considerably over the Program 
Administrator’s tenure. In particular, he has 
become more involved and responsible for mar￾keting and recruiting activities, and the alumni 
relations duties have been added in response to 
alumni requests that cannot be filled by tradi￾tional university departments.
In an effort to improve efficiencies, and in 
recognition of the MSOD Program Administrator’s 
outstanding productivity, a proposal was being 
considered by GSBM administration to change 
the design of his job. The proposal suggested that 
the MSOD Program Administrator continue to 
perform all of the current duties of the position 
application 6.2CHAPTER 6 Diagnosing Groups and Jobs 117
Diagnosis of individual-level inputs answers the following questions:
What is the design of the larger organization within which the individual 
jobs are embedded? Although the example says little about the organization’s 
design, a number of inferences are possible. The school’s administration was 
attempting to reward the Program Administrator with a more enriched job. This 
suggests that the culture of the organization was supportive of employee involve￾ment. The proposed change was also being considered, however, as part of an 
efficiency drive. The school is large in size, hosting the third largest part-time MBA 
program. This helps to explain, at the organization level, why a specialized master’s 
degree has been paired with two executive MBA programs and differentiated from 
the large part-time MBA program. To the extent the OD program has different stu￾dents or different marketing, delivery, and alumni relations processes, there may 
be difficult points of integration.
What is the design of the group containing the individual jobs? Three indi￾vidual jobs were grouped together according to the type of program. In this case, a 
faculty director, program administrator, and administrative assistant comprise the 
program office, but the office is clearly dependent on other university and school 
functions, such as the registrar’s office and financial aid, as well as with the teach￾ing faculty. Each of the three roles has specific duties, but there is a clear sense 
that all three roles are highly interdependent. The Program Administrator must 
coordinate with the director on marketing, admissions, and curriculum decisions 
and with the administrative assistant on recruiting, program delivery, and routine 
administrative processes. Interaction during task performance is thus intense, and 
although partly scheduled, the work also must deal with a high number of excep￾tions.
3. What are the personal characteristics of jobholders? The application provides 
some clues about the Program Administrator’s personal characteristics. First, he 
has stayed in the position for more than 15 years; this speaks to a loyalty or com￾mitment trait. Second, his role has evolved considerably and suggests at least a 
moderate amount of growth need strength.

and, in addition, provide administrative support to 
two PKE classes from their initial class to gradua￾tion. The duties of administrating the PKE program 
would be similar in nature to the delivery aspects 
of the MSOD program, including working with 
faculty to support their teaching efforts, manag￾ing textbook ordering processes, and providing 
different facilities logistics activities. It would not 
include marketing, recruiting, and alumni devel￾opment activities. He would receive additional 
compensation for the increased responsibilities and 
a title change. The new position would share, with 
the EMBA program administrator, the supervision 
of an assistant program administrator, who would 
in turn supervise a pool of administrative assist￾ants. The assistant program administrator would 
also report to the EMBA Program Administrator. 
The MSOD/PKE program administrator would be 
shared between the MSOD program director and a 
director of EMBA/PKE programs.118 PART 2 The Process of Organization Development
Diagnosis of individual jobs involves the following job dimensions:
How much skill variety is included in the job? The Program Adminis trator’s 
role involves a wide variety of tasks, including recruiting students; advising 
prospective and current students on career opportunities; making input into 
marketing strategies and tactics; handling routine and nonroutine administrative 
matters such as registration, grade changes, and graduation processes; supervision 
of an administrative assistant; coordination with other functions and departments 
within the school and university; traveling to several sessions and handling logis￾tics details; negotiating with a variety of resort properties on rooming costs, menus, 
meal costs, and room setup; working with alumni; and a variety of other tasks.
How much task identity does the job contain? The Program Adminis trator’s 
job is “all of a piece.” He sees and follows individuals through an entire process, 
as applicants, students, and alumni. He sees them as individuals, as professionals, 
and as members of a family or other community.
How much task significance is involved in the job? The Program Admini￾strator’s task significance is very high. As a result of his work, he brings potential 
students into a well-respected program, works with them during their matricula￾tion, advises them on their experiences in the program, and takes great pride in 
having an important hand in their personal and professional development. The 
opportunity to be integrally involved in a transformational educational process 
results in high task significance.
How much autonomy is included in the job? There is a moderate-to-high 
amount of autonomy and it has evolved and increased over the years of experi￾ence in the job. The Program Administrator’s long tenure suggests that he is able 
to handle, without much supervision, almost every aspect of his job.
5. How much feedback about results does the job contain? Assuming a tra￾ditional performance management process, the Program Administrator probably 
receives feedback from the director on his performance and on his strengths and 
weaknesses as a supervisor; from program evaluations, he receives feedback on how 
the program office is perceived in terms of its service quality; and from the students, 
he receives feedback on his willingness and ability to provide support and guidance. 
In short, the Program Administrator receives a lot of feedback about his work.
When the job characteristics are examined together, the program administrator job 
appears to contain high levels of enrichment. Task variety, task identity, task sig￾nificance, autonomy, and feedback about results are all high. Over time, the level 
of enrichment appears to have increased because skill variety and autonomy have 
increased.
The hypothesis that the job is currently well designed can be tested by assessing 
how well the job design fits the inputs. The fit between the job and the organization 
context is not clear. As a specialized master’s degree that is different from an execu￾tive MBA program, the MSOD program office and the administrator’s job in particu￾lar have evolved to be somewhat independent of the other programs. There doesn’t 
appear to be much sharing of tasks despite obvious opportunities such as student 
registration, graduation, book ordering, and others. Either the program is sufficiently 
different from the MBA programs that it warrants such independence or there are 
some important opportunities for improved efficiencies from the proposed change. 
The program administrator job is well fit to the other roles in the program office and 
to the worker’s personal characteristics. For example, the technology of recruiting 
and educating students and managing the alumni is at least moderately, if not highly, 
uncertain and very interdependent. Tasks that are uncertain require considerable 
information processing and decision making. Organic and enriched jobs fit such tasks, 
1.

4.CHAPTER 6 Diagnosing Groups and Jobs 119
and the program administrator job has gradually evolved to fit the high levels of 
uncertainty and interdependence.
In this context, the proposed change to the program administrator job needs to be 
addressed. Will the changes likely improve productivity, enhance quality, or increase 
job satisfaction? In general, the answer appears to be “no.” For example, the proposed 
change argues that adding new responsibilities will increase task variety, task identity, 
and task significance. However, the addition of the PKE classes does not increase the 
skill variety of the incumbent. There are, in fact, no new skills required to administer 
the PKE classes and adding these responsibilities may actually unbalance the existing 
skill mix. That is, under the new job, the program delivery component of the job will 
increase dramatically with respect to the other skills and more or less dominate the 
mix. This could actually result in a decreased perception of task variety.
The proposed change also argues that task significance will increase since the Program 
Administrator would be able to affect the lives of MSOD program participants as well as 
the lives of PKE participants. There is some merit to this idea, but it must be tempered 
with knowledge from the change in task identity. The MSOD Program Administrator’s 
task identity, as described in the application, is high while the task identity for the PKE 
program is relatively low. In the PKE program, the Program Administrator would inter￾act with the students only during the program; he has no involvement in the recruiting 
process and no involvement with them as alumni. Thus, any increase in the number 
of people his job affects (task significance) is likely to be offset by the reduced involve￾ment he has with about half of these people (task identity).
Finally, the proposed change argues that the incumbent is being given more respon￾sibility, which is true, but he will have less autonomy. The new MSOD/PKE program 
administrator position will have two bosses: the MSOD program director and the EMBA/
PKE director. Thus, the Program Administrator will probably have more, not less, super￾vision as the MSOD program director ensures that the MSOD program objectives are 
addressed, and the EMBA/PKE program director ensures that his or her program objec￾tives are being addressed.
Examining the proposed changes against the dimensions of job enrichment suggests 
an intervention dilemma in this case. Should the school’s administration continue 
with the proposed change? The hoped-for efficiencies may or may not materialize. The 
skills and knowledge of the Program Administrator may in fact be applied to improve 
productivity, but will it do so at the cost to the Program Administrator’s work satisfac￾tion? Over time, such a solution may not be sustainable. If the change is implemented, 
interventions probably should be aimed at mitigating the negative implications in task 
identity, task significance, and autonomy. The MSOD director and the EMBA/PKE 
director need to clearly work out expectations of the Program Administrator and fig￾ure out methods to allow the Program Administrator to perform certain tasks that he 
finds more rewarding. (Interventions for matching people, technology, and job design 
are discussed in Chapter 16.) If the proposed changes are not implemented, alterna￾tive structural arrangements within the executive programs organization will have to 
be examined.
SUMMARY
In this chapter, diagnostic models associated with groups and individuals were described 
and applied. Each of the models derives from the open systems view of organiza￾tions developed in Chapter 5. Diagnostic models include the input, design component 
(transformation processes), and output dimensions needed to understand groups and 
individual jobs.120 PART 2 The Process of Organization Development

Group diagnostic models take the organization’s design as the primary input; examine 
goal clarity, task structure, group composition, performance norms, and team func￾tioning as the key design components; and list group performance and member qual￾ity of work life as the outputs. As with any open-systems model, the alignment of 
these parts is the key to understanding effectiveness.
At the individual job level, organization design, group design, and characteristics 
of each job are the salient inputs. Task variety, task significance, task identity, auton￾omy, and feedback work together to produce outputs of work satisfaction and work 
quality.Collecting and Analyzing 
Diagnostic Information
Organization development is vitally dependent 
on organization diagnosis: the process of 
collecting information that will be shared with 
the client in jointly assessing how the organ￾ization is functioning and determining the 
best change intervention. The quality of the 
information gathered, therefore, is a critical 
part of the OD process. In this chapter, we dis￾cuss several key issues associated with collect￾ing and analyzing diagnostic data on how an 
organization or department functions.
Data collection involves gathering informa￾tion on specific organizational features, such 
as the inputs, design components, and outputs 
presented in Chapters 5 and 6. The process 
begins by establishing an effective relation ship 
between the OD practitioner and those from 
whom data will be collected and then choosing 
data collection techniques. Four methods can 
be used to collect data: questionnaires, inter￾views, observations, and unobtrusive meas￾ures. Data analysis organizes and examines 
the information to make clear the underlying 
causes of an organizational problem or to iden￾tify areas for future development. The next step 
in the cyclical OD process is the feedback of 
data to the client system, an important process 
described in Chapter 8. The overall process of 
data collection, analysis, and feedback is shown 
in Figure 7.1.
THE DIAGNOSTIC RELATIONSHIP
In most cases of planned change, OD practitioners play an active role in gathering 
data from organization members for diagnostic purposes. For example, they might 
interview members of a work team about causes of conflict among members; they 
might survey employees at a large industrial plant about factors contributing to poor 
product quality. Before collecting diagnostic information, practitioners need to estab￾lish a relationship with those who will provide and subsequently use it. Because the 
nature of that relationship affects the quality and usefulness of the data collected, it 
is vital that OD practitioners clarify for organization members who they are, why the 
data are being collected, what the data gathering will involve, and how the data will 
be used.1
 That information can help allay people’s natural fears that the data might be 
used against them and gain members’ participation and support, which are essential to 
developing successful interventions.
Establishing the diagnostic relationship between the consultant and relevant orga￾nization members is similar to forming a contract. It is meant to clarify expectations 
and to specify the conditions of the relationship. In those cases where members have 
been directly involved in the entering and contracting process described in Chapter 4, 
the diagnostic contract will typically be part of the initial contracting step. In situations 
where data will be collected from members who have not been directly involved in 
entering and contracting, however, OD practitioners will need to establish a diagnostic 
7122 PART 2 The Process of Organization Development
contract as a prelude to diagnosis. The answers to the following questions provide the 
substance of the diagnostic contract:2
Who am I? The answer to this question introduces the OD practitioner to the 
organization, particularly to those members who do not know the consultant and 
yet will be asked to provide diagnostic data.
Why am I here, and what am I doing? These answers are aimed at defining the 
goals of the diagnosis and data-gathering activities. The consultant needs to pres￾ent the objectives of the action research process and to describe how the diagnostic 
activities fit into the overall developmental strategy.
Who do I work for? This answer clarifies who has hired the consultant, whether 
it be a manager, a group of managers, or a group of employees and managers. One 
way to build trust and support for the diagnosis is to have those people directly 
involved in establishing the diagnostic contract. Thus, for example, if the consul￾tant works for a joint labor–management committee, representatives from both 
sides of that group could help the consultant build the proper relationship with 
those from whom data will be gathered.
What do I want from you, and why? Here, the consultant needs to specify 
how much time and effort people will need to give to provide valid data and 
subsequently to work with these data in solving problems. Because some people 
may not want to participate in the diagnosis, it is important to specify that such 
involvement is voluntary.
How will I protect your confidentiality? This answer addresses member 
concerns about who will see their responses and in what form. This is especially 
critical when employees are asked to provide information about their attitudes 
or perceptions. OD practitioners can either ensure confidentiality or state that 
full participation in the change process requires open information sharing. In the 
first case, employees are frequently concerned about privacy and the possibility of 
being punished for their responses. To alleviate concern and to increase the likeli￾hood of obtaining honest responses, the consultant may need to assure employees 
of the confidentiality of their information, perhaps through explicit guarantees of 
response anonymity. In the second case, full involvement of the participants in 
their own diagnosis may be a vital ingredient of the change process. If sensitive 
issues arise, assurances of confidentiality can co-opt the OD practitioner and thwart 
meaningful diagnosis. The consultant is bound to keep confidential the issues that 
are most critical for the group or organization to understand.3
 OD practitioners 
must think carefully about how they want to handle confidentiality issues.

Who will have access to the data? Respondents typically want to know whether 
they will have access to their data and who else in the organization will have simi￾lar access. The OD practitioner needs to clarify access issues and, in most cases, 
should agree to provide respondents with their own results. Indeed, the collabora￾tive nature of diagnosis means that organization members will work with their 
own data to discover causes of problems and to devise relevant interventions.
What’s in it for you? This answer is aimed at providing organization members 
with a clear delineation of the benefits they can expect from the diagnosis. This 
usually entails describing the feedback process and how they can use the data to 
improve the organization.
Can I be trusted? The diagnostic relationship ultimately rests on the trust estab￾lished between the consultant and those providing the data. An open and honest 
exchange of information depends on such trust, and the practitioner should pro￾vide ample time and face-to-face contact during the contracting process to build 
this trust. This requires the consultant to listen actively and discuss openly all ques￾tions raised by participants.
Careful attention to establishing the diagnostic relationship helps to promote the three 
goals of data collection.4
 The first and most immediate objective is to obtain valid informa￾tion about organizational functioning. Building a data collection contract can ensure that 
organization members provide honest, reliable, and complete information.
Data collection also can rally energy for constructive organizational change. A good 
diagnostic relationship helps organization members start thinking about issues that 
concern them, and it creates expectations that change is possible. When members trust 
the consultant, they are likely to participate in the diagnostic process and to generate 
energy and commitment for organizational change.
Finally, data collection helps to develop the collaborative relationship necessary for 
effecting organizational change. The diagnostic stage of action research is probably 
the first time that most organization members meet the OD practitioner, and it can 
be the basis for building a longer-term relationship. The data collection contract and 
subsequent data-gathering and feedback activities provide members with opportuni￾ties for seeing the consultant in action and for knowing her or him personally. If the 
consultant can show employees that he or she is trustworthy, is willing to work with 
them, and is able to help improve the organization, then the data collection process 
will contribute to the longer-term collaborative relationship so necessary for carrying 
out organizational changes.
METHODS FOR COLLECTING DATA
The four major techniques for gathering diagnostic data are questionnaires, interviews, 
observations, and unobtrusive measures. Table 7.1 briefly compares the methods and 
lists their major advantages and problems. No single method can fully measure the kinds 
of variables important to OD because each has certain strengths and weaknesses.5
 For 
example, perceptual measures, such as questionnaires and surveys, are open to self￾report biases, such as respondents’ tendency to give socially desirable answers rather 
than honest opinions. Observations, on the other hand, are susceptible to observer 
biases, such as seeing what one wants to see rather than what is really there. Because 
of the biases inherent in any data collection method, more than one method should be 
used when collecting diagnostic data. If data from the different methods are compared 
and found to be consistent, it is likely that the variables are being measured validly. For 
example, questionnaire measures of job discretion could be supplemented with observa￾tions of the number and kinds of decisions employees are making. If the two kinds of 
data support each other, job discretion is probably being assessed accurately. If the two 
6.
7.
8.124 PART 2 The Process of Organization Development
kinds of data conflict, the validity of the measures should be examined further— perhaps 
by using a third method, such as interviews.
Questionnaires
One of the most efficient ways to collect data is through questionnaires. Because 
they typically contain fixed-response queries about various features of an organ￾ization, these paper-and-pencil measures can be administered to large numbers of 
people simultaneously. Also, they can be analyzed quickly, especially with the use 
of computers, thus permitting quantitative comparison and evaluation. As a result, 
data can easily be fed back to employees. Numerous basic resource books on survey 
methodology and questionnaire development are available.6
Questionnaires can vary in scope, some measuring selected aspects of organizations 
and others assessing more comprehensive organizational characteristics. They also 
can vary in the extent to which they are either standardized or tailored to a specific 
organization. Standardized instruments generally are based on an explicit model of 
organization, group, or individual effectiveness and contain a predetermined set of 
questions that have been developed and refined over time. For example, Table 7.2 
presents a standardized questionnaire for measuring the job design dimensions 
identified in Chapter 6: skill variety, task identity, task significance, autonomy, and 
feedback about results. The questionnaire includes three items or questions for each

dimension, and a total score for each job dimension is computed simply by adding 
the responses for the three relevant items and arriving at a total score from 3 (low) 
to 21 (high). The questionnaire has wide applicability. It has been used in a variety of 
organizations with employees in both blue-collar and white-collar jobs.
Several research organizations have been highly instrumental in developing and 
refining surveys. The Institute for Social Research at the University of Michigan (http://
www.isr.umich.edu) and the Center for Effective Organizations at the University of 
Southern California (http://ceo-marshall.usc.edu) are two prominent examples. Two 
of the Institute’s most popular measures of organizational dimensions are the Survey of 
Organizations and the Michigan Organizational Assessment Questionnaire. Few other instru￾ments are supported by such substantial reliability and validity data.7
 Other examples 
of packaged instruments include Weisbord’s Organizational Diagnostic Questionnaire, 
Dyer’s Team Development Survey, Cameron and Quinn’s Organizational Culture Assessment 
Instrument, and Hackman and Oldham’s Job Diagnostic Survey.

 In fact, so many ques￾tionnaires are available that rarely would an organization have to create a totally new 
one. However, because every organization has unique problems and special jargon for 
referring to them, almost any standardized instrument will need to have organization￾specific additions, modifications, or omissions.
On the other hand, customized questionnaires are tailored to the needs of a 
particular client. Typically, they include questions composed by consultants or organi￾zation members, receive limited use, and do not undergo longer-term development. 
They can be combined with standardized instruments to provide valid and reliable data 
focused toward the particular issues facing an organization.
Questionnaires, however, have a number of drawbacks that need to be taken into 
account in choosing whether to employ them for data collection. First, responses are 
limited to the questions asked in the instrument. They provide little opportunity to 
probe for additional data or to ask for points of clarification. Second, questionnaires 
tend to be impersonal, and employees may not be willing to provide honest answers. 
Third, questionnaires often elicit response biases, such as the tendency to answer ques￾tions in a socially acceptable manner. This makes it difficult to draw valid conclusions 
from employees’ self-reports.
Interviews
A second important measurement technique is the individual or group interview. 
Interviews are probably the most widely used technique for collecting data in OD. 
They permit the interviewer to ask the respondent direct questions. Further prob￾ing and clarification is, therefore, possible as the interview proceeds. This flexibility 
is invaluable for gaining private views and feelings about the organization and for 
exploring new issues that emerge during the interview.
Interviews may be highly structured—resembling questionnaires—or highly unstruc￾tured—starting with general questions that allow the respondent to lead the way. 
Structured interviews typically derive from a conceptual model of organ ization function￾ing; the model guides the types of questions that are asked. For example, a structured 
interview based on the organization-level design components identified in Chapter 5 
would ask managers specific questions about technology, strategy, organization struc￾ture, measurement systems, human resources systems, and organization culture.
Unstructured interviews are more general and include the following broad ques￾tions about organizational functioning:
What are the major goals or objectives of the organization or department?
How does the organization currently perform with respect to these purposes?
What are the strengths and weaknesses of the organization or department?
What barriers stand in the way of good performance?

Although interviewing typically involves one-to-one interaction between an OD prac￾titioner and an employee, it can be carried out in a group context. Group interviews 
save time and allow people to build on others’ responses. A major drawback, however, 
is that group settings may inhibit some people from responding freely.
A popular type of group interview is the focus group or sensing meeting.
9
 These are 
unstructured meetings conducted by a manager or a consultant. A small group of 10 to 
15 employees is selected to represent a cross section of functional areas and hierarchical 
levels or a homogeneous grouping, such as minorities or engineers. Group discussion is 
frequently started by asking general questions about organizational features and func￾tioning, an intervention’s progress, or current performance. Group members are then 
encouraged to discuss their answers more fully. Consequently, focus groups and sens￾ing meetings are an economical way to obtain interview data and are especially effec￾tive in understanding particular issues in greater depth. The richness and validity of the 
information gathered will depend on the extent to which the manager or the consul￾tant develops a trust relationship with the group and listens to member opinions.
Another popular unstructured group interview involves assessing the current state 
of an intact work group. The manager or the consultant generally directs a question to 
the group, calling its attention to some part of group functioning. For example, group 
members may be asked how they feel the group is progressing on its stated task. The 
group might respond and then come up with its own series of questions about barriers 
to task performance. This unstructured interview is a fast, simple way to collect data 
about group behavior. It allows members to discuss issues of immediate concern and 
to engage actively in the questioning and answering process. This technique is limited, 
however, to relatively small groups and to settings where there is trust among employ￾ees and managers and a commitment to assessing group processes.
Interviews are an effective method for collecting data in OD. They are adaptive, 
allowing the interviewer to modify questions and to probe emergent issues during the 
interview process. They also permit the interviewer to develop an empathetic relation￾ship with employees, frequently resulting in frank disclosure of pertinent information.
A major drawback of interviews is the amount of time required to conduct and ana￾lyze them. Interviews can consume a great deal of time, especially if interviewers take 
full advantage of the opportunity to hear respondents out and change their questions 
accordingly. Personal biases also can distort the data. Like questionnaires, interviews 
are subject to the self-report biases of respondents and, perhaps more important, to 
the biases of the interviewer. For example, the nature of the questions and the interac￾tions between the interviewer and the respondent may discourage or encourage certain 
kinds of responses. These problems suggest that interviewing takes considerable skill to 
gather valid data. Interviewers must be able to understand their own biases, to listen 
and establish empathy with respondents, and to change questions to pursue issues that 
develop during the course of the interview.
Observations
One of the more direct ways of collecting data is simply to observe organizational behav￾iors in their functional settings. The OD practitioner may do this by walking casually 
through a work area and looking around or by simply counting the occurrences of spe￾cific kinds of behaviors (for example, the number of times a phone call is answered after 
three rings in a service department). Observation can range from complete participant 
observation, in which the OD practitioner becomes a member of the group under study, 
to more detached observation, in which the observer is clearly not part of the group or 
situation itself and may use film, videotape, and other methods to record behaviors.
Observations have a number of advantages. They are free of the biases inherent 
in self-report data. They put the practitioner directly in touch with the behaviors in 
question, without having to rely on others’ perceptions. Observations also involve 128 PART 2 The Process of Organization Development
real-time data, describing behavior occurring in the present rather than the past. This 
avoids the distortions that invariably arise when people are asked to recollect their 
behaviors. Finally, observations are adaptive in that the consultant can modify what 
he or she chooses to observe, depending on the circumstances.
Among the problems with observations are difficulties interpreting the meaning 
underlying the observations. Practitioners may need to devise a coding scheme to 
make sense out of observations, and this can be expensive, take time, and introduce 
biases into the data. Because the observer is the data collection instrument, personal 
bias and subjectivity can distort the data unless the observer is trained and skilled in 
knowing what to look for; how, where, and when to observe; and how to record data 
systematically. Another problem concerns sampling: Observers not only must decide 
which people to observe, they also must choose the time periods, territory, and events 
in which to make those observations. Failure to attend to these sampling issues can 
result in highly biased samples of observational data.
When used correctly, observations provide insightful data about organization and 
group functioning, intervention success, and performance. For example, observations 
are particularly helpful in diagnosing the interpersonal relations of members of work 
groups. As discussed in Chapter 6, interpersonal relationships are a key component 
of work groups; observing member interactions in a group setting can provide direct 
information about the nature of those relationships.
Unobtrusive Measures
Unobtrusive data are not collected directly from respondents but from secondary 
sources, such as company records and archives. These data are generally available in 
organizations and include records of absenteeism or tardiness; grievances; quantity and 
quality of production or service; financial performance; meeting minutes; and corre￾spondence with key customers, suppliers, or governmental agencies.
Unobtrusive measures are especially helpful in diagnosing the organization, group, 
and individual outputs presented in Chapters 5 and 6. At the organization level, for 
example, market share and return on investment usually can be obtained from com￾pany reports. Similarly, organizations typically measure the quantity and quality of the 
outputs of work groups and individual employees. Unobtrusive measures also can help 
to diagnose organization-level design components—structure, work systems, control 
systems, and human resources systems. A company’s organization chart, for example, 
can provide useful information about organization structure. Information about con￾trol systems usually can be obtained by examining the firm’s management information 
system, operating procedures, and accounting practices. Data about human resources 
systems often are included in a company’s personnel manual.
Unobtrusive measures provide a relatively objective view of organizational function￾ing. They are free from respondent and consultant biases and are perceived as being 
“real” by many organization members. Moreover, unobtrusive measures tend to be 
quantified and reported at periodic intervals, permitting statistical analysis of behaviors 
occurring over time. Examining monthly absenteeism rates, for example, might reveal 
trends in employee withdrawal behavior.
The major problems with unobtrusive measures occur in collecting such informa￾tion and drawing valid conclusions from it. Company records may not include data 
in a form that is usable by the consultant. If, for example, individual performance 
data are needed, the consultant may find that many firms only record production 
information at the group or departmental level. Unobtrusive data also may have 
their own built-in biases. Changes in accounting procedures and in methods of 
recording data are common in organizations, and such changes can affect company 
records independently of what is actually happening in the organization. For exam￾ple, observed changes in productivity over time might be caused by modifications CHAPTER 7 Collecting and Analyzing Diagnostic Information 129
in methods of recording production rather than by actual changes in organizational 
functioning.
Despite these drawbacks, unobtrusive data serve as a valuable adjunct to other diag￾nostic measures, such as interviews and questionnaires. Archival data can be used in 
preliminary diagnosis, identifying those organizational units with absenteeism, griev￾ance, or production problems. Then, interviews might be conducted or observations 
made in those units to discover the underlying causes of the problems. Conversely, 
unobtrusive data can be used to cross-check other forms of information. For example, 
if questionnaires reveal that employees in a department are dissatisfied with their jobs, 
company records might show whether that discontent is manifested in heightened with￾drawal behaviors, in lowered quality work, or in similar counterproductive behaviors.
SAMPLING
Before discussing how to analyze data, the issue of sampling needs to be emphasized. 
Application of the different data collection techniques invariably raises the following 
questions: “How many people should be interviewed and who should they be?” “What 
events should be observed and how many?” “How many records should be inspected 
and which ones?”10
Sampling is not an issue in many OD cases. Because OD practitioners collect inter￾view or questionnaire data from all members of the organization or department in 
question, they do not have to worry about whether the information is representative 
of the organization or unit.
Sampling becomes an issue in OD, however, when data are collected from selected 
members, behaviors, or records. This is often the case when diagnosing organiza￾tion-level issues or large systems. In these cases, it may be important to ensure that 
the sample of people, behaviors, or records adequately represents the characteristics 
of the total population. For example, a sample of 50 employees might be used to assess 
the perceptions of all 300 members of a department. A sample of production data might 
be used to evaluate the total production of a work group. OD practitioners often find 
that it is more economical and quicker to gather a sampling of diagnostic data than to 
collect all possible information. If done correctly, the sample can provide useful and 
valid information about the entire organization or unit.
Sampling design involves considerable technical detail, and consultants may need to 
become familiar with basic references in this area or to obtain professional help.11 The 
first issue to address is sample size, or how many people, events, or records are needed 
to carry out the diagnosis or evaluation. This question has no simple answer: The nec￾essary sample size is a function of population size, the confidence desired in the quality 
of the data, and the resources (money and time) available for data collection.
First, the larger the population (for example, the number of organization mem￾bers or total number of work outcomes) or the more complex the client system (for 
example, the number of salary levels that must be sampled or the number of different 
functions), the more difficult it is to establish a “right” sample size. As the population 
increases in size and complexity, the less meaning one can attach to simple measures, 
such as an overall average score on a questionnaire item. Because the population 
comprises such different types of people or events, more data are needed to ensure an 
accurate representation of the potentially different subgroups. Second, the larger the 
proportion of the population that is selected, the more confidence one can have about 
the quality of the sample. If the diagnosis concerns an issue of great importance to 
the organization, then extreme confidence may be needed, indicative of a very large 
sample size. Third, limited resources constrain sample size. If resources are limited but 
the required confidence is high, then questionnaires will be preferred over interviews 
because more information can be collected per member per dollar.130 PART 2 The Process of Organization Development
The second issue to address is sample selection. Probably the most common approach 
to sampling diagnostic data in OD is a simple random sample, in which each member, 
behavior, or record has an equal chance of being selected. For example, assume that an 
OD practitioner would like to select 50 people randomly out of the 300 employees at 
a manufacturing plant. Using a complete list of all 300 employees, the consultant can 
generate a random sample in one of two ways. The first method is to use a random 
number table printed in the back of almost any statistics text; the consultant would 
pick out the employees corresponding to the first 50 numbers under 300 beginning 
anywhere in the table. The second method is to pick every sixth name (300/50 = 6) 
starting anywhere in the list.
If the population is complex, or many subgroups need to be represented in the 
sample, a stratified sample may be more appropriate than a random one. In a stratified 
sample, the population of members, events, or records is segregated into a number 
of mutually exclusive subpopulations and a random sample is taken from each sub￾population. For example, members of an organization might be divided into three 
groups (managers, white-collar workers, and blue-collar workers), and a random 
sample of members, behaviors, or records could be selected from each grouping to 
reach diagnostic conclusions about each of the groups.
Adequate sampling is critical to gathering valid diagnostic data, and the OD litera￾ture has paid little attention to this issue. OD practitioners should gain rudimentary 
knowledge in this area and use professional help if necessary.
TECHNIQUES FOR ANALYZING DATA
Data analysis techniques fall into two broad classes: qualitative and quantitative. 
Qualitative techniques generally are easier to use because they do not rely on numeri￾cal data. That fact also makes them more open to subjective biases but also easier to 
understand and interpret. Quantitative techniques, on the other hand, can provide 
more accurate readings of the organizational problem.
Qualitative Tools
Of the several methods for summarizing diagnostic data in qualitative terms, two of the 
most important are content analysis and force-field analysis.
Content Analysis A popular technique for assessing qualitative data, especially inter￾view data, is content analysis, which attempts to summarize comments into meaningful 
categories. When done well, a content analysis can reduce hundreds of interview com￾ments into a few themes that effectively summarize the issues or attitudes of a group 
of respondents. The process of content analysis can be quite formal, and specialized 
references describe this technique in detail.12 In general, however, the process can be 
broken down into three major steps. First, responses to a particular question are read 
to gain familiarity with the range of comments made and to determine whether some 
answers are occurring over and over again. Second, based on this sampling of com￾ments, themes are generated that capture recurring comments. Themes consolidate 
different responses that say essentially the same thing. For example, in answering the 
question “What do you like most about your job?” different respondents might list 
their coworkers, their supervisors, the new machinery, and a good supply of tools. The 
first two answers concern the social aspects of work, and the second two address the 
resources available for doing the work. Third, the respondents’ answers to a question 
are then placed into one of the categories. The categories with the most responses rep￾resent those themes that are most often mentioned.
Force-Field Analysis A second method for analyzing qualitative data in OD derives from 
Kurt Lewin’s three-step model of change. Called force-field analysis, this method organizes CHAPTER 7 Collecting and Analyzing Diagnostic Information 131
information pertaining to organizational change into two major categories: forces for 
change and forces for maintaining the status quo or resisting change.13 Using data collected 
through interviews, observations, or unobtrusive measures, the first step in conducting 
a force-field analysis is to develop a list of all the forces promoting change and all those 
resisting it. Then, based either on the OD practitioner’s personal belief or perhaps on input 
from several members of the client organization, a determination is made of which of the 
positive and which of the negative forces are most powerful. One can either rank the order 
or rate the strength of the different forces.
Figure 7.2 illustrates a force-field analysis of the performance of a work group. The 
arrows represent the forces, and the length of the arrows corresponds to the strength 
of the forces. The information could have been collected in a group interview in which 
members were asked to list those factors maintaining the current level of group per￾formance and those factors pushing for a higher level. Members also could have been 
asked to judge the strength of each force, with the average judgment shown by the 
length of the arrows.
This analysis reveals two strong forces pushing for higher performance: pressures from 
the supervisor of the group and competition from other work groups performing similar 
work. These forces for change are offset by two strong forces for maintaining the status 
quo: group norms supporting present levels of performance and well-learned skills that 
are resistant to change. According to Lewin, efforts to change to a higher level of group 
performance, shown by the darker band in Figure 7.2, should focus on reducing the 
forces maintaining the status quo. This might entail changing the group’s performance 
norms and helping members to learn new skills. The reduction of forces maintaining the 
status quo is likely to result in organizational change with little of the tension or conflict 
typically accompanying change caused by increasing the forces for change.
Application 7.1 describes another installment in the change evaluation process at 
Alegent Health. (The introduction of this longitudinal case began in Chapter 4.) In this 
application, the research team collected data from interviews and questionnaires, but

[Figure 7.2]Collecting and Analyzing Diagnostic 
Data at Alegent Health
The two applications in Chapter 4 described the 
entry and contracting processes at the Alegent Health 
(AH) organization. As a result of a recent merger 
and the hiring of a new CEO and chief innovation 
officer (CIO), the organization had implemented 
a series of large-group interventions, known as 
decision accelerators (DAs), to generate innovative 
strategies in the six clinical service areas of women’s 
and children’s services, oncology, behavioral health, 
neuroscience, orthopedics, and cardiology. Alegent 
Health then hired two OD researchers to evaluate 
its change progress. The evaluation was intended to 
help AH understand what had changed, what had 
been learned, the impact of those changes, and how 
they might extend those changes and learnings into 
the future. The diagnostic phase involved the col￾lection and analysis of unobtrusive, interview, and 
survey data.
Unobtrusive Measures
Immediately following each DA, the Right Track 
office (a group set up to manage the DA experi￾ence) compiled a report listing participant names 
and affiliations, an agenda, instructions and elapsed 
times for each activity and process, photographs of 
different activities and all small-group outputs, 
and nearly verbatim transcripts of the large-group 
reports outs, activity debriefings, and discussions.
These reports were analyzed to understand the 
process and outcomes associated with the each 
DA. The researchers created a coding scheme and 
process to capture the characteristics of the partici￾pants, the nature of the process, and a description 
of the DA outputs. Two coders analyzed the data to 
ensure the reliability of the analysis.
First, the results suggested that the DAs varied in 
their composition. For example, some DAs were 
composed of higher percentages of physicians or 
community members than other DAs. Second, 
some DAs were more “intense” than others as 
indicated by the amount of debate over decisions 
or issues, the number of different stakeholders who 
participated in the debates and discussions, and the 
extent to which the DA’s activities deviated from 
the preset agenda. Finally, some DAs produced 
comprehensive visions and strategies for the clini￾cal area, while others produced visions that were 
more narrowly focused.
Interview Measures
A second data set consisted of interviews with 
various stakeholder groups. Initial interviews 
were conducted with executives and physicians 
about (1) the context of change at Alegent, includ￾ing organization history, strategy, and recent 
changes; (2) their reflections on the DA process; 
and (3) clinical area implementation progress. The 
researchers conducted a second round of inter￾views with people who were closely connected 
with the implementation of each clinical service 
area strategy. They were asked questions about 
the clarity of action plans, the level of involve￾ment of different people, and implementation 
progress. Finally, a third set of interviews were 
conducted with a sample of staff nurses who 
had not participated in the original DAs or been 
directly involved in implementation activities, 
such as steering committees or design teams.
Each set of interview data was content analyzed for 
key themes and perspectives. A few of the summary 
results from the initial interviews are presented 
here.
When asked, “How clear were the action plans 
coming out of the DA?”, the executives were evenly 
split in their beliefs that the action plans were clear 
as opposed to the plans being essentially absent. 
Executives were also asked, “What is going well/not 
so well in implementation of the different service 
line strategies?” About 20% of executives believed 
that the strategies were aligned with the mission/
vision of the health system and that the DAs had 
provided a clear vision to work toward. However, 
more than half of executives expressed concern that 
the organization lacked a real change capability. 
Executives were also concerned about being over￾whelmed by change, insufficient communication, 
and the need to involve stakeholders more.
When asked, “What would you list as the ‘high 
points’ or ‘best success stories’ of the DA process?” 
and “What have been some of the least successful 
activities/concerns?”, the answers were more positive 
than negative. Nearly all of the interviewees noted 
application 7.1CHAPTER 7 Collecting and Analyzing Diagnostic Information 133
the improved relationships with physicians, and 
more than a third of executives said there had been 
some good learnings on how to increase the speed of 
decision making. Both of these results reflected cul￾tural changes in the organization that were among 
the purposes for conducting the DAs. On the nega￾tive side, a small percentage of executives noted the 
continued difficulties associated with coordinating 
the operations of a multihospital system.
Another area of interview data concerned execu￾tive perceptions of how the DA might evolve in 
the future. There was a strong generic belief that 
the DA needed to evolve to fit the changed organ￾izational conditions and a widespread perception 
that this should include a more explicit focus on 
execution, better change governance, and better 
follow-up and communication.
In addition to these initial interview results, data 
from the second round of implementation inter￾views were used to develop six cases studies, one for 
each clinical service area. They described the initial 
DA event and the subsequent decisions, activities, 
and events for the 18 months following the forma￾tion of the clinical strategies. Importantly, the case 
studies listed the organizational changes that most 
people agreed had been implemented in the first 
18 months. Each case study was given to the VP in 
charge of the clinical area for validation.
Survey Measures
The researchers also collected two sets of survey data. 
The first survey, administered during the initial round 
of executive and physician interviews, asked them to 
rate several dimensions of clinical area strategy and 
progress. The second survey was administered to 
people who attended a “review DA” for three of the 
six clinical areas. It too measured perceptions of clini￾cal strategy and progress.
The survey data were organized into three catego￾ries and analyzed by a statistical program. The first 
category measured five dimensions of strategy for 
each clinical area: comprehensiveness, innovative￾ness, aggressiveness, congruence with Alegent’s 
strategy, and business focus. Both executives and 
managers rated the clinical strategies highest on 
comprehensiveness and lowest on congruence 
with Alegent’s mission. Executives also rated the 
strategies lower on innovativeness. In all dimen￾sions and for each clinical area, managers rated the 
five dimensions higher than executives did.
The second category measured how well the imple￾mentation process was being managed. Executives 
“somewhat agreed” that the clinical area strategies 
were associated with a clear action plan; however, 
there was considerable variance, suggesting that 
some clinical areas had better action plans than 
others. Similarly, managers “somewhat agreed” 
that change governance systems exists and that 
change was coordinated.
The third category assessed implementation success. 
As with the strategy dimensions, managers rated 
overall implementation progress higher than execu￾tives did, but both groups were somewhat guarded 
(between neutral and agree) in their responses. 
Managers were asked a more detailed set of ques￾tions about implementation. There was more agree￾ment that the clinical strategies were the “right thing 
to do” and had helped to “build social capital” in the 
organization, but they were neutral with respect to 
whether “people feel involved” in the change.
also used observation and unobtrusive measures. The analysis used a combination of 
qualitative and quantitative techniques. What do you see as the strengths and weak￾nesses of the data collection and analysis process?
Quantitative Tools
Methods for analyzing quantitative data range from simple descriptive statistics of 
items or scales from standard instruments to more sophisticated, multivariate analysis 
of the underlying instrument properties and relationships among measured variables.14
The most common quantitative tools are means, standard deviations, and frequency 134 PART 2 The Process of Organization Development
distributions; scattergrams and correlation coefficients; and difference tests. These 
measures are routinely produced by most statistical computer software packages. 
Therefore, mathematical calculations are not discussed here.
Means, Standard Deviations, and Frequency Distributions One of the most eco￾nomical and straightforward ways to summarize quantitative data is to compute a 
mean and standard deviation for each item or variable measured. These represent the 
respondents’ average score and the spread or variability of the responses, respectively. 
These two numbers easily can be compared across different measures or subgroups. For 
example, Table 7.3 shows the means and standard deviations for six questions asked 
of 100 employees concerning the value of different kinds of organizational rewards. 
Based on the 5-point scale ranging from 1 (very low value) to 5 (very high value), the data 
suggest that challenging work and respect from peers are the two most highly valued 
rewards. Monetary rewards, such as pay and fringe benefits, are not as highly valued.
But the mean can be a misleading statistic. It only describes the average value and 
thus provides no information on the distribution of the responses. Different patterns 
of responses can produce the same mean score. Therefore, it is important to use the 
standard deviation along with the frequency distribution to gain a clearer understand￾ing of the data. The frequency distribution is a graphical method for displaying data that 
shows the number of times a particular response was given. For example, the data in 
Table 7.3 suggest that both pay and praise from the supervisor are equally valued with 
a mean of 4.0. However, the standard deviations for these two measures are very dif￾ferent at 0.71 and 1.55, respectively. Table 7.4 shows the frequency distributions of 
the responses to the questions about pay and praise from the supervisor. Employees’ 
responses to the value of pay are distributed toward the higher end of the scale, with 
no one rating it of low or very low value. In contrast, responses about the value of 
praise from the supervisor fall into two distinct groupings: Twenty-five employees felt 
that supervisor praise has a low or very low value, whereas 75 people rated it high or 
very high. Although both rewards have the same mean value, their standard devia￾tions and frequency distributions suggest different interpretations of the data.
In general, when the standard deviation for a set of data is high, there is considerable 
disagreement over the issue posed by the question. If the standard deviation is small, 
the data are similar on a particular measure. In the example described above, there is 
disagreement over the value of supervisory praise (some people think it is important, but 
others do not), but there is fairly good agreement that pay is a reward with high value.
Scattergrams and Correlation Coefficients In addition to describing data, quantita￾tive techniques also permit OD consultants to make inferences about the relation￾ships between variables. Scattergrams and correlation coefficients are measures of the

strength of a relationship between two variables. For example, suppose the problem 
being faced by an organization is increased conflict between the manufacturing depart￾ment and the engineering design department. During the data collection phase, infor￾mation about the number of conflicts and change orders per month over the past year is 
collected. The data are shown in Table 7.5 and plotted in a scattergram in Figure 7.3.
A scattergram is a diagram that visually displays the relationship between two vari￾ables. It is constructed by locating each case (person or event) at the intersection of

its value for each of the two variables being compared. For example, in the month 
of August, there were eight change orders and three conflicts, whose intersection is 
shown in Figure 7.3 as an .
Three basic patterns can emerge from a scattergram, as shown in Figure 7.4. The 
first pattern is called a positive relationship because as the values of x increase, so do 
the values of y. The second pattern is called a negative relationship because as the 
values of x increase, the values of y decrease. Finally, there is the “shotgun” pattern

[Figure 7.4]CHAPTER 7 Collecting and Analyzing Diagnostic Information 137
wherein no relationship between the two variables is apparent. In the example shown 
in Figure 7.3, an apparently strong positive relationship exists between the number of 
change orders and the number of conflicts between the engineering design department 
and the manufacturing department. This suggests that change orders may contribute 
to the observed conflict between the two departments.
The correlation coefficient is simply a number that summarizes data in a scattergram. Its 
value ranges between 1.0 and −1.0. A correlation coefficient of 1.0 means that there 
is a perfectly positive relationship between two variables, whereas a correlation of − 1.0 
signifies a perfectly negative relationship. A correlation of 0 implies a “shotgun” scatter￾gram where there is no relationship between two variables.
Difference Tests The final technique for analyzing quantitative data is the differ￾ence test. It can be used to compare a sample group against some standard or norm to 
determine whether the group is above or below that standard. It also can be used to 
determine whether two samples are significantly different from each other. In the first 
case, such comparisons provide a broader context for understanding the meaning of 
diagnostic data. They serve as a “basis for determining ‘how good is good or how bad 
is bad.’ ”15 Many standardized questionnaires have standardized scores based on the 
responses of large groups of people. It is critical, however, to choose a comparison 
group that is similar to the organization being diagnosed. For example, if 100 engineers 
take a standardized attitude survey, it makes little sense to compare their scores against 
standard scores representing married males from across the country. On the other 
hand, if industry-specific data are available, a comparison of sales per employee (as a 
measure of productivity) against the industry average would be valid and useful.
The second use of difference tests involves assessing whether two or more groups 
differ from one another on a particular variable, such as job satisfaction or absentee￾ism. For example, job satisfaction differences between an accounting department and 
a sales department can be determined with this tool. Given that each group took the 
same questionnaire, their means and standard deviations can be used to compute a 
difference score (t-score or z-score) indicating whether the two groups are statistically 
different. The larger the difference score relative to the sample size and standard devia￾tion for each group, the more likely that one group is more satisfied than the other.
Difference tests also can be used to determine whether a group has changed its score 
on job satisfaction or some other variable over time. The same questionnaire can be 
given to the same group at two points in time. Based on the group’s means and stan￾dard deviations at each point in time, a difference score can be calculated. The larger 
the score, the more likely that the group actually changed its job satisfaction level.
The calculation of difference scores can be very helpful for diagnosis but requires the OD 
practitioner to make certain assumptions about how the data were collected. These assump￾tions are discussed in most standard statistical texts, and OD practitioners should consult 
them before calculating difference scores for purposes of diagnosis or evaluation.16
SUMMARY
This chapter described several different methods for collecting and analyzing diagnostic 
data. Because diagnosis is an important step that occurs frequently in the planned 
change process, a working familiarity with these techniques is essential. Methods of 
data collection include questionnaires, interviews, observation, and unobtrusive mea￾sures. Methods of analysis include qualitative techniques, such as content analysis and 
force-field analysis, and quantitative techniques, such as the determination of mean, 
standard deviation, and frequency distributions; scattergrams and correlation coeffi￾cients; as well as difference tests.138 PART 2 The Process of Organization Development

NOTESFeeding Back Diagnostic Information
Perhaps the most important step in the diagnostic 
process is feeding back diagnostic information 
to the client organization. Although the data 
may have been collected with the client’s help, 
the OD practitioner often organizes and presents 
them to the client. Properly analyzed and mean￾ingful data can have an impact on organizational 
change only if organization members can use the 
information to devise appropriate action plans. 
A key objective of the feedback process is to be 
sure that the client has ownership of the data.
As shown in Figure 8.1, the success of data 
feedback depends largely on its ability to arouse 
organizational action and to direct energy 
toward organizational problem solving. Whether 
feedback helps to energize the organization 
depends on the content of the feedback data 
and on the process by which they are fed back 
to organization members.
In this chapter, we discuss criteria for 
developing both the content of feedback 
information and the processes for feeding it 
back. If these criteria are overlooked, the client 
is not apt to feel ownership of the problems 
facing the organization. A flexible and potentially 
powerful technique for data feedback that has 
arisen out of the wide use of questionnaires in 
OD work is known as survey feedback. Its central 
role in many large-scale OD efforts warrants a 
special look.
DETERMINING THE CONTENT OF THE FEEDBACK
In the course of diagnosing the organization, a large amount of data is collected. In 
fact, there is often more information than the client needs or can interpret in a realistic 
period of time. If too many data are fed back, the client may decide that changing 
is impossible. Therefore, OD practitioners need to summarize the data in ways that 
enable clients to understand the information and draw action implications from it. The 
techniques for data analysis described in Chapter 7 can inform this task. Additional 
criteria for determining the content of diagnostic feedback are described below.
Several characteristics of effective feedback data have been described in the 
literature.1
 They include the following nine properties:
Relevant. Organization members are likely to use feedback data for problem solv￾ing when they find the information meaningful. Including managers and employ￾ees in the initial data collection activities can increase the relevance of the data.
Understandable. Data must be presented to organization members in a form that 
is readily interpreted. Statistical data, for example, can be made understandable 
through the use of graphs and charts.
Descriptive. Feedback data need to be linked to real organizational behaviors if 
they are to arouse and direct energy. The use of examples and detailed illustrations 
can help employees gain a better feel for the data.
Verifiable. Feedback data should be valid and accurate if they are to guide action. 
Thus, the information should allow organization members to verify whether the 
1.

findings really describe the organization. For example, questionnaire data might 
include information about the sample of respondents as well as frequency distribu￾tions for each item or measure. Such information can help members verify whether 
the feedback data accurately represent organizational events or attitudes.
Timely. Data should be fed back to members as quickly as possible after being col￾lected and analyzed. This will help ensure that the information is still valid and is 
linked to members’ motivations to examine it.
Limited. Because people can easily become overloaded with too much infor￾mation, feedback data should be limited to what employees can realistically process 
at one time.
Significant. Feedback should be limited to those problems that organization 
members can do something about because it will energize them and help direct 
their efforts toward realistic changes.

PART 2 The process of organization Development

Comparative. Feedback data can be ambiguous without some benchmark as a ref￾erence. Whenever possible, data from comparative groups should be provided to give 
organization members a better idea of how their group fits into a broader context.
Unfinalized. Feedback is primarily a stimulus for action and thus should spur further 
diagnosis and problem solving. Members should be encouraged, for example, to use 
the data as a starting point for more in-depth discussion of organizational issues.
CHARACTERISTICS OF THE FEEDBACK PROCESS
In addition to providing effective feedback data, it is equally important to attend to 
the process by which that information is fed back to people. Typically, data are pro￾vided to organization members in a meeting or series of meetings. Feedback meetings 
provide a forum for discussing the data, drawing relevant conclusions, and devising 
preliminary action plans. Because the data might include sensitive material and evalu￾ations about organization members’ behaviors, people may come to the meeting with 
considerable anxiety and fear about receiving the feedback. This anxiety can result in 
defensive behaviors aimed at denying the information or providing rationales. More 
positively, people can be stimulated by the feedback and the hope that desired changes 
will result from the feedback meeting. Because people are likely to come to feedback 
meetings with anxiety, fear, and hope, OD practitioners need to manage the feedback 
process so that constructive discussion and problem solving occur. The most important 
objective of the feedback process is to ensure that organization members own the data. 
Ownership is the opposite of resistance to change and refers to people’s willingness to 
take responsibility for the data, their meaning, and the consequences of using them 
to devise a change strategy.2
 If the feedback session results in organization members 
rejecting the data as invalid or useless, then the motivation to change is lost and mem￾bers will have difficulty engaging in a meaningful process of change.
Ownership of the feedback data is facilitated by the following five features of suc￾cessful feedback processes:3
Motivation to work with the data. People need to feel that working with the 
feedback data will have beneficial outcomes. This may require explicit sanction and 
support from powerful groups so that people feel free to raise issues and to iden￾tify concerns during the feedback sessions. If people have little motivation to work 
with the data or feel that there is little chance to use the data for change, then the 
information will not be owned by the client system.
Structure for the meeting. Feedback meetings need some structure or they may 
degenerate into chaos or aimless discussion. An agenda or outline for the meeting 
and the presence of a discussion leader can usually provide the necessary direc￾tion. If the meeting is not kept on track, especially when the data are negative, 
ownership can be lost in conversations that become too general. When this hap￾pens, the energy gained from dealing directly with the problem is lost.
Appropriate attendance. Generally, people who have common problems and 
can benefit from working together should be included in the feedback meeting. This 
may involve a fully intact work team or groups comprising members from different 
functional areas or hierarchical levels. Without proper representation in the meet￾ing, ownership of the data is lost because participants cannot address the problem(s) 
suggested by the feedback.
Appropriate power. It is important to clarify the power possessed by the group. 
Members need to know on which issues they can make necessary changes, on 
which they can only recommend changes, and over which they have no control. 
Unless there are clear boundaries, members are likely to have some hesitation 
about using the feedback data for generating action plans. Moreover, if the group 
8.

CHAPTER 8 Feeding Back Diagnostic Information142 PART 2 The process of organization Development
has no power to make changes, the feedback meeting will become an empty 
exercise rather than a real problem-solving session. Without the power to address 
change, there will be little ownership of the data.
Process help. People in feedback meetings require assistance in working together 
as a group. When the data are negative, there is a natural tendency to resist the 
implications, deflect the conversation onto safer subjects, and the like. An OD prac￾titioner with group process skills can help members stay focused on the subject and 
improve feedback discussion, problem solving, and ownership.
When combined with effective feedback data, these features of successful feedback 
meetings enhance member ownership of the data. They help to ensure that organi￾zation members fully discuss the implications of the diagnostic information and that 
their conclusions are directed toward relevant and feasible organizational changes.
Application 8.1 presents excerpts from some training materials that were delivered 
to a group of internal facilitators at a Fortune 100 telecommunications company.4
 It 
describes how the facilitators were trained to deliver the results of a survey concern￾ing problem solving, team functioning, and perceived effectiveness.
SURVEY FEEDBACK
Survey feedback is a process of collecting and feeding back data from an organ￾ization or department through the use of a questionnaire or survey. The data are 
analyzed, fed back to organization members, and used by them to diagnose the 
organization and to develop interventions to improve it. Because questionnaires 
often are used in organization diagnosis, particularly in OD efforts involving large 
numbers of participants, and because it is a powerful intervention in its own right, 
survey feedback is discussed here as a special case of data feedback.
As discussed in Chapter 1, survey feedback is a major technique in the history and 
development of OD. Originally, this intervention included only data from question￾naires about members’ attitudes. However, attitudinal data can be supplemented 
with interview data and more objective measures, such as productivity, turnover, and 
absenteeism.5
 Another trend has been to combine survey feedback with other OD 
interventions, including work design, structural change, large-group interventions, 
and intergroup relations. These change methods are the outcome of the planning 
and implementation phase following from survey feedback and are described fully in 
Chapters 12 through 23.
What Are the Steps?
Survey feedback generally involves the following five steps:6
Members of the organization, including those at the top, are involved in 
preliminary planning of the survey. In this step, all parties must be clear about 
the level of analysis (organization, department, or small group) and the objectives 
of the survey. Because most surveys derive from a model about organizational or 
group functioning, organization members must, in effect, approve that diagnostic 
framework. This is an important initial step in gaining ownership of the data and 
in ensuring that the right problems and issues are addressed by the survey.
Once the objectives are determined, the organization can use one of the stand￾ardized questionnaires described in Chapter 7, or it can develop its own survey 
instrument. If the survey is developed internally, pretesting the questionnaire is 
essential to ensure that it has been constructed properly. In either case, the survey 
items need to reflect the objectives established for the survey and the diagnostic 
issues being addressed.

1.Training OD Practitioners in Data Feedback
As part of a large-scale, employee involvement (EI) 
program, a large telecommunications company and 
the Communications Workers of America union 
were working to build an internal organization 
development consulting capability. This involved 
the hiring and development of several union and 
management employees to work with managers, 
facilitate EI problem-solving team meetings, and 
assist in the implementation of recommended 
changes. The implementation process included 
an evaluation component and the EI facilitators 
were expected to collect and feed back data to the 
organization.
The data collected included observation of various 
work processes and problem-solving meetings; 
unobtrusive measures such as minutes from all 
meetings, quarterly income statements, operational 
reports, and communications; and questionnaire 
and interview data. A three-page questionnaire 
was administered every three months and it asked 
participants on EI problem-solving teams for their 
perceptions of team functioning and performance. 
Internal EI facilitators were appointed from both 
management and union employees, and part of 
their work required them to feed back the results 
of the quarterly surveys.
To provide timely feedback to the problem￾solving teams, the EI facilitators were trained to 
deliver survey feed back. Some of the material 
developed for that training is summarized below.
I. Planning for a Survey-Feedback 
Session
The success of a survey-feedback meeting often 
has more to do with the level of preparation for 
the meeting than with anything else. There are 
several things to do in preparing for a survey￾feedback meeting.
A. Distribute copies of the feedback report in 
advance. This enables people to devote 
more time at the meeting to problem 
solving and less to just digesting the data. 
This is especially important when a large 
quantity of data is being presented.
B. Think about substantive issues in advance. 
Formulate your own view of what the 
data suggest about the strengths and 
weaknesses of the group. Does the general 
picture appear to be positive or problem￾atic? Do the data fit the experience of the 
group as you know it? What issues do the 
data suggest need group attention? Is the 
group likely to avoid any of these issues? 
If so, how will you help the group con￾front the difficult issues?
C. Make sure you can answer likely technical 
questions about the data. Survey data have 
particular strengths and weaknesses. Be 
able to acknowledge that the data are not 
perfect, but that a lot of effort has gone 
into ensuring that they are reliable and 
valid.
D. Plan your introduction to the survey-feedback 
portion of the meeting. Make the introduction 
brief and to the point. Remind the group 
of why it is considering the data, set the 
stage for problem solving by pointing out 
that many groups find such data helpful in 
tracking their progress, and be prepared to 
run through an example that shows how 
to understand the feedback data.
II. Problem Solving with Survey￾Feedback Data
A. Chunk the feedback. If a lot of data are being 
fed back, use your knowledge of the group 
and the data to present small portions of 
data. Stop periodically to see if there are 
questions or comments about each section 
or “chunk” of data.
B. Stimulate discussion on the data. What fol￾lows are various ways to help get the 
discussion going.
1. Help clarify the meaning of the data 
by asking
• What questions do you have about 
what the data mean?
• What does [a specific number] 
mean?
• Does anything in the data surprise 
you?
• What do the data tell you about 
how we’re doing as a group?
application 8.1144 PART 2 The process of organization Development
2. Help develop a shared diagnosis 
about the meaning of the data by 
commenting
• What I hear people saying is . . . 
Does everyone agree with that?
• Several people are saying that . . . 
is a problem. Do we agree that this 
is something the group needs to 
address?
• Some people seem to be saying . . . 
while other comments suggest . . . 
Can you help me understand how 
the group sees this?
• The group has really been strug￾gling with [specific issue that the 
facilitator is familiar with], but the 
data say that we are strong on this. 
Can someone explain this?
3. Help generate action alternatives by 
asking
• What are some of the things we 
can do to resolve . . . ?
• Do we want to brainstorm some 
action steps to deal with . . . ?
C. Focus the group on its own data. The major 
benefit of survey feedback for EI teams 
will be in learning about the group’s own 
behavior and outcomes. Often, however, 
groups will avoid dealing with issues 
concerning their own group in favor of 
broader and less helpful discussions about 
what other groups are doing right and 
wrong. Comments you might use to help 
get the group on track include:
• What do the data say about how we 
are doing as a group?
• There isn’t a lot we can do about 
what other groups are doing. What 
can we do about the things that are 
under our control?
• The problem you are mentioning 
sounds like one this group also is fac￾ing [explain]. Is that so?
D. Be prepared for problem-solving discussions 
that are only loosely connected to the data. It 
is more important for the group to use 
the data to understand itself better and 
to solve problems than it is to follow any 
particular steps in analyzing the data. 
Groups often are not very systematic in 
how they analyze survey-feedback data. 
They may ignore issues that seem obvious 
to them and instead focus on one or two 
issues that have meaning for them.
E. Hot issues and how to deal with them. 
Survey data can be particularly helpful 
in addressing some hot issues within 
the group that might otherwise be over￾looked. For example, a group often will 
prefer to portray itself as very effective 
even though group members privately 
acknowledge that such is not the case. 
If the data show problems that are not 
being addressed, you can raise this issue 
as a point for discussion. If someone 
denies that group members feel there is 
a problem, you can point out that the 
data come from the group and that group 
members reported such-and-such on the 
survey. Be careful not to use a parental 
tone; if you sound like you’re wagging 
your finger at or lecturing the group, 
you’re likely to get a negative reaction. 
Use the data to raise issues for discussion 
in a less emotional way.
Ultimately, the group must take responsibility for 
its own use of the data. There will be times when 
you see the issues differently from the way group 
members see them or times when it appears cer￾tain to you that the group has a serious problem 
that it refuses to acknowledge. A facilitator can￾not push a group to do something it’s not ready 
to do, but he or she can poke the group at times 
to find out if it is ready to deal with tough issues. 
“A little irritation is what makes a pearl in the 
oyster.”CHAPTER 8 Feeding Back Diagnostic Information 145
The survey instrument is administered to all members of the organization 
or department. This breadth of data collection is ideal, but it may be appropriate 
to administer the instrument to only a sample of members because of cost or time 
constraints. If so, the size of the sample should be as large as possible to improve 
the motivational basis for participation in the feedback sessions.
The OD consultant usually analyzes the survey data, tabulates the results, 
suggests approaches to diagnosis, and trains client members to lead the 
feedback process.
Data feedback usually begins at the top of the organization and cascades 
downward to groups reporting to managers at successively lower levels.
This waterfall approach ensures that all groups at all organizational levels involved 
in the survey receive appropriate feedback. Most often, members of each organiza￾tion group at each level discuss and deal with only that portion of the data involv￾ing their particular group. They, in turn, prepare to introduce data to groups at the 
next lower organizational level if appropriate.
Data feedback also can occur in a “bottom-up” approach. Initially, the data for 
specific work groups or departments are fed back and action items proposed. At 
this point, the group addresses problems and issues within its control. The group 
notes any issues that are beyond its authority and suggests actions. That informa￾tion is combined with information from groups reporting to the same manager, 
and the combined data are fed back to the managers who review the data and the 
recommended actions. Problems that can be solved at this level are addressed. In 
turn, their analyses and suggestions regarding problems of a broader nature are 
combined, and feedback and action sessions proceed up the hierarchy. In such a 
way, the people who most likely will carry out recommended action get the first 
chance to propose suggestions.
Feedback meetings provide an opportunity to work with the data. At each 
meeting, members discuss and interpret their data, diagnose problem areas, and 
develop action plans. OD practitioners can play an important role during these 
meetings,7 facilitating group discussion to produce accurate understanding, focus￾ing the group on its strengths and weaknesses, and helping to develop effective 
action plans.
Although the preceding steps can have a number of variations, they generally reflect the 
most common survey-feedback design. Application 8.2 presents a contemporary exam￾ple of how the survey-feedback methodology can be adapted to serve strategic purposes. 
The application describes how Prudential Real Estate Affiliates combines attitudinal sur￾veys with hard measures to increase change ownership in real estate sales offices.8
Survey Feedback and Organizational Dependencies
Traditionally, the steps of survey feedback have been applied to work groups and orga￾nizational units with little attention to dependencies among them. Research suggests, 
however, that the design of survey feedback should vary depending on how closely the 
participating units are linked with one another.9
 When the units are relatively inde￾pendent and have little need to interact, survey feedback can focus on the dynamics 
occurring within each group and can be applied to the groups separately. When there is 
greater dependency among units and they need to coordinate their efforts, survey feed￾back must take into account relationships among the units, paying particular attention 
to the possibility of intergroup conflict. In these situations, the survey-feedback process 
needs to be coordinated across the interdependent groups. The process will typically 
be managed by special committees and task forces representing the groups. They will 
facilitate the intergroup confrontation and conflict resolution generally needed when 
relations across groups are diagnosed.

5.Operations Review and Survey Feedback
at Prudential Real Estate Affiliates
Prudential Real Estate Affiliates, Inc. (PREA) is a 
subsidiary of the Prudential Insurance Company 
of America. Throughout the United States, it 
franchises the Prudential name to independently 
owned and operated real estate offices that help 
people buy and sell homes and commercial real 
estate. PREA works with approximately 1,200 of 
these offices. Although some real estate firms are 
large, multioffice organizations, many are small 
independent offices with an owner/manager and 
several sales associates. PREA’s primary work is 
to help the offices do their job better by offering 
a range of support services, including technical 
support, sales training, advertising, and business 
assistance.
PREA has adapted successfully the survey-feedback 
technology to assist its customers in improving 
profitability, productivity, and sales associate work 
satisfaction. The survey-feedback methodology is 
called an “operations review.” It is a voluntary 
service annually provided free of charge to any 
office. PREA describes the operations review as 
an “interactive process.” Each office manager is 
required to gather internal information about its 
operations and to send the data to PREA. In addi￾tion, each sales associate completes a confidential 
43-item opinion survey that is returned directly to 
PREA for analysis.
These data are entered into a database, and a four￾color report is produced. The report is then fed 
back to the owner/manager of a single office or to 
the management team in the larger offices. In the 
best cases, all or part of the data is then shared with 
the sales associates at a sales meeting. The data are 
discussed, areas of improvement are identified, and 
action plans are developed. “When there are dis￾crepancies, especially on the sales force attitudes, 
it is a great opportunity for discussion,” says Skip 
Newberg, one of the process designers.
The data are presented in three major areas: finan￾cial performance, including income, expense, and 
profit ratios; productivity, including units sold or 
revenues per full-time sales associate; and man￾agement practices, including office climate, service 
orientation, and sales associates’ attitudes. The data 
for each question are presented in colorful graphs 
that compare the office’s productivity with that of 
similar offices (in terms of size or structure) and 
with the productivity of the top-performing sales 
office in the country. “Presenting the data in this 
simple way has an impact. Reams of computer 
printouts with numbers are not interesting. . . . 
Graphs and colors grab a manager’s attention,” says 
Newberg.
Although the financial and productivity data are 
important, it is the management practices data 
that get the most attention in the feedback proc￾ess. Newberg believes that “the power is not in 
the printed book; the power is in the skill of the 
people who sit down with the sales office people 
and help them interpret it. A skilled person can 
show an office their strengths and weaknesses in 
such a way that they can use the data to make 
improvements.” The “management practices” sec￾tion examines three areas that are related to sales 
office performance: climate, service orientation, 
and fundamental attitudes. Climate refers to the 
associates’ perceptions of the extent and degree to 
which their work and well-being are promoted by 
management and other associates. It also indicates 
the degrees to which associates have a sense of 
pride in their office. Items in the survey, such as 
“This real estate office is considered to be a leader 
by others in the market” and “We get a lot of cus￾tomers in this office based on customer referrals,” 
tap that dimension. Service orientation refers to an 
office’s emphasis on service quality and customer 
satisfaction. To assess this dimension, the survey 
asks sales associates to agree or disagree with 
statements such as “Our office places so much 
emphasis on selling to customers that it is difficult 
to serve customers properly” and “Our advertising 
is consistent with the service we deliver.” Finally, 
fundamental attitudes of sales associates and their 
perceptions of management’s attitudes can range 
from optimistic to pessimistic. The survey taps 
these attitudes with statements such as “Clients 
have no loyalty regardless of how you treat them” 
and “Giving customers truly excellent custom serv￾ice takes too much; it’s just not worth it.”
application 8.2CHAPTER 8 Feeding Back Diagnostic Information 147
Including sales office performance next to sales asso￾ciates’ opinions and attitudes provides an impor￾tant motivational aspect to the feedback process. 
Newberg believes that “there isn’t a manager alive 
who doesn’t want to know how they compare to 
their peers. The profit and productivity information 
gets the office’s attention and makes it easier to get 
the message across.” The message he refers to is the 
results of research conducted by PREA. It has pro￾duced some remarkable evidence of relationships 
between sales office performance and the attitudes 
and opinions of the sales associates. For example, 
PREA’s research has provided strong evidence of a 
positive relationship between the fundamental atti￾tudes of sales associates and sales office profitability.
Invariably during the feedback session, owner/ 
managers or senior managers say, “OK, that’s 
great—sales associate attitudes and office perform￾ance are related. But how can I improve sales 
associate attitudes?” Glenn Sigmund, a PREA 
manager who has worked extensively with the 
operations review, says, “If we can get managers to 
this point, we have their interest, motivation, and 
most importantly, commitment to address change.” 
Additional research by PREA found certain key 
behaviors, practices, and policies that were directly 
related to positive scores on fundamental attitudes, 
service orientation, and office climate. These prac￾tices and policies give the sales office something 
tangible to work with and implement.
Response to the system has been favorable. More 
than 20,000 sales associates have taken the sur￾vey, and many offices are back for the third year 
of feedback. One CEO from a large multioffice 
firm said, “This is one of the most valuable serv￾ices PREA offers. Our managers see it as a great 
tool and one of the best mechanisms for feedback 
from our sales associates to check how we’re 
really doing.” Another manager in a smaller office 
reported that “the operations review has had a 
definite impact. It helps us focus on carrying out 
our business plan and increase profits. We also use 
it to help our sales associates plan how to improve 
their own effectiveness.”
Limitations of Survey Feedback
Although the use of survey feedback is widespread in contemporary organizations, the 
following limits and risks have been identified:10
Ambiguity of purpose. Managers and staff groups responsible for the 
survey-feedback process may have difficulty reaching sufficient consensus about 
the purposes of the survey, its content, and how it will be fed back to participants. 
Such confusion can lead to considerable disagreement over the data collected and 
paralysis about doing anything with them.
Distrust. High levels of distrust in the organization can render the survey feedback 
ineffective. Employees need to trust that their responses will remain anonymous and 
that management is serious about sharing the data and solving problems jointly.
Unacceptable topics. Most organizations have certain topics that they do not 
want examined. This can severely constrain the scope of the survey process, par￾ticularly if the neglected topics are important to employees.
Organizational disturbance. The survey-feedback process can unduly disturb 
organizational functioning. Data collection and feedback typically infringe on 
employee work time. Moreover, administration of a survey can call attention to 
issues with which management is unwilling to deal, and can create unrealistic 
expectations about organizational improvement.

Results of Survey Feedback
Survey feedback has been used widely in business organizations, schools, hospitals, 
federal and state governments, and the military. The navy has used survey feedback 
in more than 500 navy commands. More than 150,000 individual surveys were com￾pleted, and a large bank of computerized research data was generated. Promising 
results were noted among survey indices on nonjudicial punishment rates, incidence 
of drug abuse reports, and performance of ships undergoing refresher training (a posto￾verhaul training and evaluation period).11 Positive results have been reported in such 
diverse areas as an industrial organization in Sweden and the Israeli Army.12
One of the most important studies of survey feedback was done by Bowers, who 
conducted a five-year longitudinal study (the Intercompany Longitudinal Study) of 
23 organizations in 15 companies involving more than 14,000 people in both white￾collar and blue-collar positions.13 In each of the 23 organizations studied, repeat 
measurements were taken. The study compared survey feedback with three other 
OD interventions: interpersonal process consultation, task process consultation, and 
laboratory training. The study reported that survey feedback was the most effective of 
the four treatments and the only one “associated with large across-the-board positive 
changes in organization climate.”14 Although these findings have been questioned on 
a number of methodological grounds,15 the original conclusion that survey feedback 
is effective in achieving organizational change was supported. The study suggested 
that any conclusions to be drawn from action research and survey-feedback studies 
should be based, at least in part, on objective operating data.
Comprehensive reviews of the literature reveal differing perspectives on the 
effects of survey feedback. In one review, survey feedback’s biggest impact was on 
attitudes and perceptions of the work situation. The study suggested that survey 
feedback might best be viewed as a bridge between the diagnosis of organizational 
problems and the implementation of problem-solving methods because little evi￾dence suggests that survey feedback alone will result in changes in individual 
behavior or organizational output.16 This view is supported by research suggesting 
that the more the data were used to solve problems between initial surveys and later 
surveys, the more the data improved.17 Another study suggested that survey feed￾back has positive effects on both outcome variables (for example, productivity, costs, 
and absenteeism) and process variables (for example, employee openness, decision 
making, and motivation) in 53% and 48%, respectively, of the studies measuring 
those variables. When compared with other OD approaches, survey feedback was 
only bettered by interventions using several approaches together—for example, 
change programs involving a combination of survey feedback, process consultation, 
and team building.18 On the other hand, another review found that, in contrast to 
laboratory training and team building, survey feedback was least effective, with only 
33% of the studies that measured hard outcomes reporting success. The success rate 
increased to 45%, however, when survey feedback was combined with team build￾ing.19 Finally, a meta-analysis of OD process interventions and individual attitudes 
suggested that survey feedback was not significantly associated with overall satis￾faction or attitudes about co-workers, the job, or the organization. Survey feedback 
was able to account for only about 11% of the variance in satisfaction and other 
attitudes.20
Studies of specific survey-feedback interventions identify conditions that improve 
the success of this technique. One study in an urban school district reported difficul￾ties with survey feedback and suggested that its effectiveness depends partly on the 
quality of those leading the change effort, members’ understanding of the process, 
the extent to which the survey focuses on issues important to participants, and the 
degree to which the values expressed by the survey are congruent with those of the CHAPTER 8 Feeding Back Diagnostic Information 149
respondents.21 Another study in the military concluded that survey feedback works 
best when supervisors play an active role in feeding back data to employees and 
helping them to work with the data.22 Similarly, a field study of funeral coopera￾tive societies concluded that the use and dissemination of survey results increased 
when organization members were closely involved in developing and carrying out 
the project and when the consultant provided technical assistance in the form of 
data analysis and interpretation.23 Finally, a long-term study of survey feedback in 
an underground mining operation suggested that continued, periodic use of survey 
feedback can produce significant changes in organizations.24
SUMMARY
This chapter described the process of feeding back data to a client system. It 
concerned identifying the content of the data to be fed back and designing a feedback 
process that ensures ownership of the data. Feeding back data is a central activity in 
almost any OD program. If members own the data, they will be motivated to solve 
organizational problems. A special application of the data collection and feedback 
process is called survey feedback. It is one of the most accepted processes in orga￾nization development, enabling practitioners to collect diagnostic data from a large 
number of organization members and to feed back that information for purposes of 
problem solving. Survey feedback highlights the importance of contracting appro￾priately with the client system (discussed in Chapters 4 and 7), establishing relevant 
categories for data collection, and feeding back the data as necessary steps for diag￾nosing organizational problems and developing interventions for resolving them.

An organization development intervention is 
a sequence of activities, actions, and events 
intended to help an organization improve its 
performance and effectiveness. Intervention 
design, or action planning, derives from careful 
diagnosis and is meant to resolve specific 
problems and to improve particular areas of 
organizational functioning identified in the 
diagnosis. OD interventions vary from standard￾ized programs that have been developed and 
used in many organizations to relatively unique 
programs tailored to a specific organization or 
department.
This chapter serves as an overview of the 
intervention design process: It describes criteria 
that define effective OD interventions and 
identifies contingencies that guide successful 
intervention design. Finally, the various types 
of OD interventions presented in this book 
are introduced. Parts 3 through 6 of this book 
describe fully the major interventions used in 
OD today.
WHAT ARE EFFECTIVE INTERVENTIONS?
The term “intervention” refers to a set of sequenced planned actions or events intended 
to help an organization increase its effectiveness. Interventions purposely disrupt the 
status quo; they are deliberate attempts to change an organization or subunit toward a 
different and more effective state. In OD, three major criteria define an effective inter￾vention: (1) the extent to which it fits the needs of the organization; (2) the degree 
to which it is based on causal knowledge of intended outcomes; and (3) the extent to 
which it transfers change management competence to organization members.
The first criterion concerns the extent to which the intervention is relevant to the 
organization and its members. Effective interventions are based on valid information 
about the organization’s functioning; they provide organization members with oppor￾tunities to make free and informed choices; and they gain members’ internal commit￾ment to those choices.1
Valid information is the result of an accurate diagnosis of the organization’s functioning. 
It must reflect fairly what organization members perceive and feel about their primary 
concerns and issues. Free and informed choice suggests that members are actively involved 
in making decisions about the changes that will affect them. This principle also means 
that they can choose not to participate and that interventions will not be imposed on 
them. This is an important distinction between change management—where a change 
legitimately can be imposed on people—and OD—where the intent of the change pro￾cess is to build capacity for change and increase effectiveness. Internal commitment means 
that organization members accept ownership of the intervention and take responsibility 
for implementing it. If interventions are to result in meaningful changes, management, 
staff, and other relevant members must be committed to carrying them out.
The second criterion of an effective intervention involves knowledge of outcomes. 
Because interventions are intended to produce specific results, they must be based on 
9152 PART 2 The Process of Organization Development
valid knowledge that those outcomes actually can be produced. Otherwise there is 
no scientific basis for designing an effective OD intervention. Unfortunately—and in 
contrast to other applied disciplines, such as medicine and engineering—knowledge 
of intervention effects is in a rudimentary stage of development in OD. Much of the 
evaluation research lacks sufficient rigor to make strong causal inferences about the 
success or failure of change programs. (Chapter 11 discusses how to evaluate OD pro￾grams rigorously.) Moreover, few attempts have been made to examine the compara￾tive effects of different OD techniques. All of these factors make it difficult to know 
whether one method is more effective than another.
Despite these problems, more attempts are being made to assess systematically the 
strengths and weaknesses of OD interventions and to compare the impact of different 
techniques on organization effectiveness.2
 Many of the OD interventions that will be 
discussed briefly here and in more depth in Parts 3 through 6 have been subjected to 
evaluative research; chapters on the various change programs explore the research 
appropriate to them.
The third criterion of an effective intervention involves the extent to which it enhances 
the organization’s capacity to manage change. The values underlying OD suggest that fol￾lowing an intervention, organization members should be better able to carry out planned 
change activities on their own. From active participation in designing and implementing 
the intervention, they should gain knowledge and skill in managing change. Competence 
in change management is essential in today’s environment, where technological, social, 
economic, and political changes are rapid and persistent. Many organizations, such as 
Capital One, The Hartford, The Limited Brands, and Microsoft, recognize this need and 
are systematically building their change management capabilities.
HOW TO DESIGN EFFECTIVE INTERVENTIONS
Designing OD interventions requires paying careful attention to the needs and dynam￾ics of the change situation and crafting a change program that will be consistent 
with the previously described criteria of effective interventions. Current knowledge 
of OD interventions provides only general prescriptions for change. There is scant 
precise information or research about how to design interventions or how they can 
be expected to interact with organizational conditions to achieve specific results.3
Moreover, because the ability to implement most OD interventions is highly depen￾dent on the skills and knowledge of the change agent, the design of an intervention 
will depend to some extent on the expertise of the practitioner.
Two major sets of contingencies that can affect intervention success have been dis￾cussed in the OD literature: those having to do with the change situation (including 
the practitioner) and those related to the target of change. Both kinds of contingencies 
need to be considered in designing interventions.
Contingencies Related to the Change Situation
Researchers have identified a number of contingencies present in the change situa￾tion that can affect intervention success. These include individual differences among 
organization members (for example, needs for autonomy), organizational factors (for 
example, management style and technical uncertainty), and dimensions of the change 
process itself (for example, degree of top-management support). Unless these factors are 
taken into account, designing an intervention will have little impact on organizational 
functioning or, worse, it may produce negative results. For example, to resolve motiva￾tional problems among blue-collar workers in an oil refinery, it is important to know 
whether interventions intended to improve motivation (for example, job enrichment) 
will succeed with the kinds of people who work there. In many cases, knowledge of CHAPTER 9 Designing Interventions 153
these contingencies results in modifying or adjusting the change program to fit the set￾ting. In applying a reward-system intervention to an organization, the changes might 
have to be modified depending on whether the firm wants to reinforce individual or 
team performance.
Although knowledge of contingencies is still at a rudimentary stage of development 
in OD, researchers have discovered several situational factors that can affect interven￾tion success.4
 These factors include contingencies for many of the interventions reviewed 
in this book, and they will be discussed in respective chapters describing the change 
programs. The more generic contingencies that apply to all OD interventions are pre￾sented below. They include situational factors that must be considered in designing any 
intervention: the organization’s readiness for change, its change capability, its cultural 
context, and the change agent’s skills and abilities.
Readiness for Change Intervention success depends heavily on the organization being 
ready for planned change. Indicators of readiness for change include sensitivity to pres￾sures for change, dissatisfaction with the status quo, availability of resources to support 
change, and commitment of significant management time. When such conditions are 
present, interventions can be designed to address the organizational issues uncovered 
during diagnosis. When readiness for change is low, however, interventions need to focus 
first on increasing the organization’s willingness to change.5
Capability to Change An organization’s change capability is a function of the change￾related knowledge and skills present in the organization, the resources and systems 
devoted to change, and the organization’s experience with change.6 First, managing 
planned change requires particular knowledge and skills (as outlined in Chapter 10), 
including the ability to motivate change, to lead change, to develop political support, 
and to sustain momentum. Second, change requires an infrastructure to support the 
transition. Program and project management offices, consulting resources, and shared 
models of the change process are necessary to oversee execution. Finally, an organiza￾tion must have experience with and learnings from change to have a change capability. 
If an organization does not have these resources, then a preliminary training interven￾tion may be needed before members can engage meaningfully in intervention design.
Cultural Context The national culture within which the organization is embedded can 
exert a powerful influence on members’ reactions to change, so intervention design 
must account for the cultural values and assumptions held by organization members. 
Interventions may have to be modified to fit the local culture, particularly when OD 
practices developed in one culture are applied to organizations in another culture.7
For example, a team-building intervention designed for top managers at an American 
firm may need to be modified when applied to the company’s foreign subsidiaries. 
(Chapter 23 will describe the cultural values of different countries and show how 
interventions can be modified to fit different cultural contexts.)
Capabilities of the Change Agent Many failures in OD result when change agents 
apply interventions beyond their competence. In designing interventions, OD practi￾tioners should assess their experience and expertise against the requirements needed 
to implement the intervention effectively. When a mismatch is discovered, practition￾ers can explore whether the intervention can be modified to fit their talents better, 
whether another intervention more suited to their skills can satisfy the organization’s 
needs, or whether they should enlist the assistance of another change agent who can 
guide the process more effectively. The ethical guidelines under which OD practitioners 
operate require full disclosure of the applicability of their knowledge and expertise to 
the client situation. Practitioners are expected to intervene within their capabilities or 
to recommend someone more suited to the client’s needs.154 PART 2 The Process of Organization Development
Contingencies Related to the Target of Change
OD interventions seek to change specific features or parts of organizations. These tar￾gets of change are the main focus of interventions, and researchers have identified 
two key contingencies related to change targets that can affect intervention success: 
the organizational issues that the intervention is intended to resolve and the level of 
organizational system at which the intervention is expected to have a primary impact.
Organizational Issues Organizations need to address certain issues to operate effectively. 
Figure 9.1 lists these issues along with the OD interventions that are intended to resolve 
them. (The parts and chapters of this book that describe the specific interventions are 
also identified in the figure.) It shows the following four interrelated issues that are key 
targets of OD interventions:
1. Strategic issues. Organizations need to decide what products or services they will 
provide and the markets in which they will compete, as well as how to relate to 
their environments and how to transform themselves to keep pace with changing 
conditions. These strategic issues are among the most critical ones facing organi￾zations in today’s changing and highly competitive environments. OD methods 
aimed at these issues are called strategic interventions. The methods are among the 
most recent additions to OD and include integrated strategic change, mergers and 
acquisitions, alliance and network development, and organization learning.
2. Technological and structural issues. Organizations must decide how to divide 
work into departments and then how to coordinate among those departments to 
support strategic directions. They also must make decisions about how to deliver 
products or services and how to link people to tasks. OD methods for dealing with 
these structural and technological issues are called technostructural interventions 
and include OD activities relating to organization design, employee involvement, 
and work design.
3. Human resources issues. These issues are concerned with attracting competent 
people to the organization, setting goals for them, appraising and rewarding their per￾formance, and ensuring that they develop their careers and manage stress. OD tech￾niques aimed at these issues are called human resources management interventions.
4. Human process issues. These issues have to do with social processes occurring 
among organization members, such as communication, decision making, lead￾ership, and group dynamics. OD methods focusing on these kinds of issues are 
called human process interventions; included among them are some of the most 
common OD techniques, such as conflict resolution and team building.
Consistent with systems theory as described in Chapter 5, these organizational issues 
are interrelated and need to be integrated with one another. The double-headed arrows 
connecting the different issues in Figure 9.1 represent the fits or linkages among them. 
Organizations need to match answers to one set of questions with answers to other sets 
of questions to achieve high levels of effectiveness. For example, decisions about gaining 
competitive advantage need to fit with choices about organization structure, setting goals 
for and rewarding people, communication, and problem solving.
The interventions presented in this book are intended to resolve these different 
concerns. As shown in Figure 9.1, particular OD interventions apply to specific issues. 
Thus, intervention design must create change methods appropriate to the organiza￾tional issues identified in diagnosis. Moreover, because the organizational issues are 
themselves linked together, OD interventions similarly need to be integrated with 
one another. For example, a goal-setting intervention that tries to establish motivat￾ing goals may need to be integrated with supporting interventions, such as a reward 
system that links pay to goal achievement.CHAPTER 9 Designing Interventions 155

The key point is to think systemically.8
 Interventions aimed at one kind of 
organizational issue will invariably have repercussions on other kinds of issues. Careful 
thinking about how OD interventions affect the different kinds of issues and how 
different change programs might be integrated to bring about a broader and more 
coherent impact on organizational functioning is critical to effective OD intervention.
Organizational Levels In addition to facing interrelated issues, organizations function at 
different levels: individual, group, organization, and transorganization. Thus, organiza￾tional levels are targets of change in OD. Table 9.1 lists OD interventions in terms of the 
level of organization that they primarily affect. For example, some technostructural inter￾ventions affect mainly individuals and groups (for example, work design), whereas others 
impact primarily the total organization (for example, structural design).
It is important to emphasize that only the primary level affected by the interven￾tion is identified in Table 9.1. Many OD interventions also have a secondary impact on 
the other levels. For example, structural design affects mainly the organization level, 
but it can have an indirect effect on groups and individuals because it sets the broad 
parameters for designing work groups and individual jobs. Again, practitioners need to 
think systemically. They must design interventions to apply to specific organizational 
levels, address the possibility of cross-level effects, and perhaps integrate interventions 
affecting different levels to achieve overall success.9
 For example, an intervention to 
create self-managed work teams may need to be linked to organization-level changes 
in measurement and reward systems to promote team-based work.
OVERVIEW OF INTERVENTIONS
The OD interventions discussed in Parts 3 through 6 of this book are briefly described 
below. They represent the major organization change methods used in OD today.
Human Process Interventions
Part 3 of the book presents interventions focusing on people within organizations and the 
processes through which they accomplish organizational goals. These processes include 
communication, problem solving, group decision making, and leadership. This type of 
intervention is deeply rooted in the history of OD and represents the earliest change 
programs characterizing OD. Human process interventions derive mainly from the dis￾ciplines of psychology and social psychology and the applied fields of group dynamics 
and human relations. Practitioners applying these interventions generally value human 
fulfillment and expect that organizational effectiveness follows from improved function￾ing of people and organizational processes.10
Chapter 12 discusses human process interventions related to interpersonal relation￾ships and group dynamics. These include the following three interventions:
1. Process consultation. This intervention focuses on interpersonal relations and 
social dynamics occurring in work groups. Typically, a process consultant helps 
group members diagnose group functioning and devise appropriate solutions to 
process problems, such as dysfunctional conflict, poor communication, and ineffec￾tive norms. The aim is to help members gain the skills and understanding neces￾sary to identify and solve problems themselves.
2. Third-party intervention. This change method is a form of process consultation 
aimed at dysfunctional interpersonal relations in organizations. Interpersonal con￾flict may derive from substantive issues, such as disputes over work methods, or 
from interpersonal issues, such as miscommunication. The third-party intervener 
helps people resolve conflicts through such methods as problem solving, bargain￾ing, and conciliation.CHAPTER 9 Designing Interventions 157

Types of Interventions and Organization Levels
[Table 9.1]158 PART 2 The Process of Organization Development
3. Team building. This intervention helps work groups become more effective 
in accomplishing tasks. Like process consultation, team building helps members 
diagnose group processes and devise solutions to problems. It goes beyond group 
processes, however, to include examination of the group’s task, member roles, 
and strategies for performing tasks. The consultant also may function as a resource 
person offering expertise related to the group’s task.
Chapter 13 presents human process interventions that are more systemwide than 
those described in Chapter 12. They typically focus on the total organization or an 
entire department, as well as on relations between groups. These include the following 
three change programs:
1. Organization confrontation meeting. This change method mobilizes organ￾ization members to identify problems, set action targets, and begin working on 
problems. It is usually applied when organizations are experiencing stress and 
when management needs to organize resources for immediate problem solving. 
The intervention generally includes various groupings of employees in identifying 
and solving problems.
2. Intergroup relations. These interventions are designed to improve interactions 
among different groups or departments in organizations. The microcosm group 
intervention involves a small group of people whose backgrounds closely match 
the organizational problems being addressed. This group addresses the problem 
and develops means to solve it. The intergroup conflict model typically involves a 
consultant helping two groups understand the causes of their conflict and choose 
appropriate solutions.
3. Large-group interventions. These interventions involve getting a broad vari￾ety of stakeholders into a large meeting to clarify important values, to develop 
new ways of working, to articulate a new vision for the organization, or to solve 
pressing organizational problems. Such meetings are powerful tools for creating 
awareness of organizational problems and opportunities and for specifying valued 
directions for future action.
Technostructural Interventions Part 4 of the book presents interventions focusing on 
an organization’s technology (for example, task methods and job design) and structure 
(for example, division of labor and hierarchy). These change methods are receiving 
increasing attention in OD, especially in light of current concerns about productivity 
and organizational effectiveness. They include approaches to employee involvement, 
as well as methods for designing organizations, groups, and jobs. Technostructural 
interventions are rooted in the disciplines of engineering, sociology, and psychol￾ogy and in the applied fields of sociotechnical systems and organization design. 
Practitioners generally stress both productivity and human fulfillment and expect that 
organization effectiveness will result from appropriate work designs and organization 
structures.11
In Chapter 14, we discuss the following three technostructural interventions con￾cerned with restructuring organizations:
1. Structural design. This change process concerns the organization’s division of 
labor—how to specialize task performances. Interventions aimed at structural 
design include moving from more traditional ways of dividing the organization’s 
overall work (such as functional, self-contained unit, and matrix structures) to 
more integrative and flexible forms (such as process-based, customer-centric, 
and network-based structures). Diagnostic guidelines exist to determine which CHAPTER 9 Designing Interventions 159
structure is appropriate for particular organizational environments, technologies, 
and conditions.
2. Downsizing. This intervention reduces costs and bureaucracy by decreasing the 
size of the organization through personnel layoffs, organization redesign, and out￾sourcing. Each of these downsizing methods must be planned with a clear under￾standing of the organization’s strategy.
3. Reengineering. This recent intervention radically redesigns the organization’s 
core work processes to create tighter linkage and coordination among the differ￾ent tasks. This workflow integration results in faster, more responsive task perfor￾mance. Reengineering is often accomplished with new information technology 
that permits employees to control and coordinate work processes more effectively. 
Reengineering often fails if it ignores basic principles and processes of OD.
Chapter 15 is concerned with employee involvement (EI). This broad category of 
interventions is aimed at improving employee well-being and organizational effec￾tiveness. It generally attempts to move knowledge, power, information, and rewards 
downward in the organization. EI includes parallel structures (such as cooperative 
union–management projects and quality circles), total quality management, and high￾involvement plants.
Chapter 16 discusses work design. These change programs are concerned with design￾ing work for work groups and individual jobs. The intervention includes engineer￾ing, motivational, and sociotechnical systems approaches that produce traditionally 
designed jobs and work groups; enriched jobs that provide employees with greater 
task variety, autonomy, and feedback about results; and self-managing teams that can 
govern their own task behaviors with limited external control.
Human Resources Management Interventions Part 5 of the book focuses on interven￾tions used to develop, integrate, and support people in organizations. These practices 
include career planning, reward systems, goal setting, and performance appraisal—
change methods that traditionally have been associated with the human resources 
function in organizations. In recent years, interest has grown in integrating human 
resources management with OD. Human resources management interventions are 
rooted in labor relations and in the applied practices of compensation and benefits, 
employee selection and placement, performance appraisal, and career development. 
Practitioners in this area typically focus on the people in organizations, believing that 
organizational effectiveness results from improved practices for integrating employees 
into organizations.
Chapter 17 deals with interventions concerning performance management, includ￾ing the following change programs:
1. Goal setting. This change program involves setting clear and challenging goals. It 
attempts to improve organization effectiveness by establishing a better fit between 
personal and organizational objectives. Managers and subordinates periodically 
meet to plan work, review accomplishments, and solve problems in achieving 
goals.
2. Performance appraisal. This intervention is a systematic process of jointly 
assessing work-related achievements, strengths, and weaknesses. It is the primary 
human resources management intervention for providing performance feedback 
to individuals and work groups. Performance appraisal represents an important 
link between goal setting and reward systems.
3. Reward systems. This intervention involves the design of organizational 
rewards to improve employee satisfaction and performance. It includes innovative 
approaches to pay, promotions, and fringe benefits.160 PART 2 The Process of Organization Development
Chapter 18 focuses on these three change methods associated with developing orga￾nizational talent:
1. Coaching and mentoring. This intervention helps managers and executives to 
clarify their goals, deal with potential stumbling blocks, and improve their perfor￾mance. It often involves a one-on-one relationship between the OD practitioner 
and the client and focuses on personal learning that gets transferred into organiza￾tional results and more effective leadership skills.
2. Career planning and development. This intervention helps people choose organi￾zations and career paths and attain career objectives. It generally focuses on managers 
and professional staff and is seen as a way of improving the quality of their work life.
3. Management and leadership. Among the oldest strategies for organizational 
change, training and development interventions increase organization members’ 
skills and knowledge. The focus of these interventions is on building the competen￾cies needed to lead the organization in the future and includes traditional classroom 
lectures as well as simulations, action learning, and case studies.
Chapter 19 describes two interventions for supporting organization members:
1. Managing workforce diversity. This change program makes human resources 
practices more responsive to a variety of individual needs. Important trends, such as 
the increasing number of women, ethnic minorities, and physically and mentally chal￾lenged people in the workforce, require a more flexible set of policies and practices.
2. Employee stress and wellness. These interventions include employee assistance 
programs (EAPs) and stress management. EAPs are counseling programs that help 
employees deal with substance abuse and mental health, marital, and financial 
problems that often are associated with poor work performance. Stress manage￾ment programs help workers cope with the negative consequences of stress at 
work. They help managers reduce specific sources of stress, such as role conflict 
and ambiguity, and provide methods for reducing such stress symptoms as hyper￾tension and anxiety.
Strategic Interventions Part 6 of the book considers interventions that link the inter￾nal functioning of the organization to the larger environment and transform the orga￾nization to keep pace with changing conditions. These change programs are among 
the newest additions to OD. They are implemented organizationwide and bring about 
a fit between business strategy, structure, culture, and the larger environment. The 
interventions derive from the disciplines of strategic management, organization theory, 
economics, and anthropology.
In Chapter 20, we discuss interventions that transform the way the organization 
relates to its environment or operates internally:
1. Integrated strategic change. This comprehensive OD intervention describes 
how planned change can make a value-added contribution to strategic manage￾ment. It argues that business strategies and organizational systems must be changed 
together in response to external and internal disruptions. A strategic change plan 
helps members manage the transition between a current strategy and organization 
design and the desired future strategic orientation.
2. Organization design. This intervention addresses the organization’s architecture, 
or the extent to which structure, work design, human resource practices, and 
management and information systems are in alignment and support each other. It 
is a systemic view of the organization that attempts to direct member behavior in 
a consistent and strategic direction.CHAPTER 9 Designing Interventions 161
3. Culture change. This intervention helps organizations develop cultures (behav￾iors, values, beliefs, and norms) appropriate to their strategies and environments. It 
focuses on developing a strong organization culture to keep organization members 
pulling in the same direction.
Chapter 21 addresses strategic interventions that shape the collaborative strategies of 
organizations:
1. Mergers and acquisitions. This intervention describes how OD practitioners can 
assist two or more organizations to form a new entity. Addressing key strategic, 
leadership, and cultural issues prior to the legal and financial transaction helps to 
smooth operational integration.
2. Alliances. This collaborative intervention helps two organizations pursue a set of 
private and common goals through the sharing of resources, including intellec￾tual property, people, capital, technology, capabilities, or physical assets. Effective 
alliance development generally follows a process of strategy formulation, partner 
selection, alliance structuring and start-up, and alliance operation and adjustment.
3. Networks. This intervention helps to develop relationships among three or more 
organizations to perform tasks or solve problems that are too complex for single 
organizations to resolve. It helps organizations recognize the need for partnerships 
and develop appropriate structures for implementing them. It also addresses how 
to manage change within existing networks.
In the final chapter of Part 6, we discuss three interventions that are designed to sup￾port continuous change:
1. Self-designing organizations. This change program helps organizations gain 
the capacity to alter themselves fundamentally. It is a highly participative process 
involving multiple stakeholders in setting strategic directions and designing and 
implementing appropriate structures and processes. Organizations learn how to 
design and implement their own strategic changes.
2. Organization learning and knowledge management. This intervention 
describes two interrelated change processes: organization learning (OL), which 
seeks to enhance an organization’s capability to acquire and develop new knowl￾edge, and knowledge management (KM), which focuses on how that knowledge 
can be organized and used to improve organization performance. These interven￾tions move the organization beyond solving existing problems so as to become 
capable of continuous improvement.
3. Built to change organizations. This approach to continuous change challenges 
traditional design principles that view stability and equilibrium as the keys to success. 
These principles support the belief that change is costly and should be avoided. Built 
to change organizations, on the other hand, assume that the source of effectiveness 
is the ability to change continuously. The features, skills and knowledge, and pro￾cesses of leading and managing these adaptable organizations are described.
SUMMARY
This chapter presented an overview of interventions currently used in OD. An inter￾vention is a set of planned activities intended to help an organization improve its 
performance and effectiveness. Effective interventions are designed to fit the needs of 
the organization, are based on causal knowledge of intended outcomes, and transfer 
competence to manage change to organization members.162 PART 2 The Process of Organization Development
Intervention design involves understanding situational contingencies such as indi￾vidual differences among organization members and dimensions of the change process 
itself. Four key organizational factors—readiness for change, capability to change, 
cultural context, and the capabilities of the change agent—affect the design and imple￾mentation of almost any intervention.
Furthermore, OD interventions seek to change specific features or parts of organ￾izations. These targets of change can be classified based on the organizational issues 
that the intervention is intended to resolve and the level of organizational system at 
which the intervention is expected to have a primary impact. Four types of OD inter￾ventions are addressed in this book: (1) human process programs aimed at people 
within organizations and their interaction processes; (2) technostructural methods 
directed at organization technology and structures for linking people and technology; 
(3) human resources management interventions focused at integrating people into the 
organization successfully; and (4) strategic programs targeted at how the organization 
uses its resources to gain a competitive advantage in the larger environment. For each 
type of intervention, specific change programs at different organization levels are dis￾cussed in Parts 3 through 6 of this book.

NOTESLeading and Managing Change
After diagnosis reveals the causes of problems 
or identifies opportunities for development, 
organization members begin planning and 
subsequently leading and implementing the 
changes necessary to improve organization 
effectiveness and performance. A large part of 
OD is concerned with interventions for improving 
organizations. The previous chapter discussed 
the design of interventions and introduced the 
major ones currently used in OD. Chapters 
12 through 20 describe those interventions in 
detail. This chapter addresses the key activities 
associated with successfully leading and 
managing organizational changes.
Change can vary in complexity from the 
introduction of relatively simple processes into a 
small work group to transforming the strategies 
and design features of the whole organization. 
Although change management differs across sit￾uations, in this chapter we discuss tasks that must 
be performed in managing any kind of organiza￾tional change. (Tasks applicable to specific kinds 
of changes are examined in the chapters on 
intervention in Parts 3 through 6.)
OVERVIEW OF CHANGE ACTIVITIES
The OD literature has directed considerable attention at leading and managing 
change. Much of the material is highly prescriptive, advising managers about how 
to plan and implement organizational changes. For example, one study suggested 
that successful managers in continuously changing organizations (1) provide 
employees with clear responsibility and priorities, including extensive communica￾tion and freedom to improvise; (2) explore the future by experi menting with a wide 
variety of low-cost probes; and (3) link current projects to the future with predict￾able (time-paced rather than event-paced) intervals and choreographed transition 
procedures.1 Traditionally, change management has focused on identifying sources 
of resistance to change and offering ways to overcome them.2
 Other contributions 
have challenged the focus on resistance and have been aimed at creating visions 
and desired futures, gaining political support for them, and managing the transition 
of the organization toward them.3 Still others have described the learning practices 
and leader behaviors that accelerate complex change.4
The diversity of practical advice for managing change can be organized into five 
major activities, as shown in Figure 10.1. The activities contribute to effective change 
management and are listed roughly in the order in which they typically are performed. 
Each activity represents a key element in change leadership.5
 The first activity involves 
motivating change and includes creating a readiness for change among organization 
members and helping them address resistance to change. Leadership must create an 
environment in which people accept the need for change and commit physical and

psychological energy to it. Motivation is a critical issue in starting change because 
ample evidence indicates that people and organizations seek to preserve the status 
quo and are willing to change only when there are compelling reasons to do so. The 
second activity is concerned with creating a vision and is closely aligned with leader￾ship activities. The vision provides a purpose and reason for change and describes the 
desired future state. Together, they provide the “why” and “what” of planned change. 
The third activity involves developing political support for change. Organizations are com￾posed of powerful individuals and groups that can either block or promote change, and 
leaders and change agents need to gain their support to implement changes. The fourth CHAPTER 10 Leading and Managing Change 165
activity is concerned with managing the transition from the current state to the desired 
future state. It involves creating a plan for managing the change activities as well as 
planning special management structures for operating the organization during the 
transition. The fifth activity involves sustaining momentum for change so that it will be 
carried to completion. This includes providing resources for implementing the changes, 
building a support system for change agents, developing new competencies and skills, 
and reinforcing the new behaviors needed to implement the changes.
Each of the activities shown in Figure 10.1 is important for managing change. 
Although little research has been conducted on their relative contributions, organiza￾tional leaders must give careful attention to each activity when planning and imple￾menting organizational change. Unless individuals are motivated and committed to 
change, getting movement on the desired change will be extremely difficult. In the 
absence of vision, change is likely to be disorganized and diffuse. Without the support 
of powerful individuals and groups, change may be blocked and possibly sabotaged. 
Unless the transition process is managed carefully, the organization will have difficulty 
functioning while it moves from the current state to the future state. Without efforts 
to sustain momentum for change, the organization will have problems carrying the 
changes through to completion. Thus, all five activities must be managed effectively 
to realize success.
In the following sections of this chapter, we discuss more fully each of these change 
activities, directing attention to how leaders contribute to planning and implementing 
organizational change.
MOTIVATING CHANGE
Organizational change involves moving from the known to the unknown. Because the 
future is uncertain and may adversely affect people’s competencies, worth, and cop￾ing abilities, organization members generally do not support change unless compelling 
reasons convince them to do so. Similarly, organizations tend to be heavily invested 
in the status quo, and they resist changing it in the face of uncertain future benefits. 
Consequently, a key issue in planning for action is how to motivate commitment to 
organizational change. As shown in Figure 10.1, this requires attention to two related 
tasks: creating readiness for change and overcoming resistance to change.
Creating Readiness for Change
One of the more fundamental axioms of OD is that people’s readiness for change 
depends on creating a felt need for change. This involves making people so dissatisfied
with the status quo that they are motivated to try new work processes, technologies, 
or ways of behaving. Creating such dissatisfaction can be difficult, as anyone knows 
who has tried to lose weight, stop smoking, or change some other habitual behavior. 
Generally, people and organizations need to experience deep levels of hurt before 
they will seriously undertake meaningful change. For example, IBM, GM, and Sears 
experienced threats to their very survival before they undertook significant change 
programs. The following three methods can help generate sufficient dissatisfaction to 
produce change:
Sensitize organizations to pressures for change. Innumerable pressures for 
change operate both externally and internally to organizations. As described in 
Chapter 1, modern organizations face unprecedented environmental pressures to 
change themselves, including heavy foreign competition, rapidly changing tech￾nology, and the draw of global markets. Internal pressures to change include new 
leadership, poor product quality, high production costs, and excessive employee 
1.166 PART 2 The Process of Organization Development
absenteeism and turnover. Before these pressures can serve as triggers for change, 
however, organizations must be sensitive to them. The pressures must pass beyond 
an organization’s threshold of awareness if managers are to respond to them. 
Many organizations, such as Kodak, Polaroid, and Northwest Airlines, set their 
thresholds of awareness too high and neglected pressures for change until those 
pressures reached disastrous levels.6
Organizations can make themselves more sensitive to pressures for change by 
encouraging leaders to surround themselves with devil’s advocates; by cultivating 
external networks that comprise people or organizations with different perspec￾tives and views; by visiting other organizations to gain exposure to new ideas and 
methods; and by using external standards of performance, such as competitors’ 
progress or benchmarks, rather than the organization’s own past standards of per￾formance.7
 At Wesley Long Community Hospital, in Greensboro, North Carolina, 
for example, managers visited the Ritz-Carlton Hotel, Marconi Commerce Systems’ 
high-involvement plant, and other hospitals known for high quality to gain 
insights about revitalizing their own organization.
Reveal discrepancies between current and desired states. In this approach 
to generating a felt need for change, information about the organization’s cur￾rent functioning is gathered and compared with desired states of operation. (See 
“Creating a Vision,” below, for more information about desired future states.) 
These desired states may include organizational goals and standards, as well as a 
general vision of a more desirable future state.8
 Significant discrepancies between 
actual and ideal states can motivate organization members to initiate corrective 
changes, particularly when members are committed to achieving those ideals. A 
major goal of diagnosis, as described in Chapters 5 and 6, is to provide members 
with feedback about current organizational functioning so that the information 
can be compared with goals or with desired future states. Such feedback can ener￾gize action to improve the organization. At Waste Management, Sunbeam, and 
Banker’s Trust, for example, financial statements had reached the point at which 
it was painfully obvious that drastic renewal was needed.9
Convey credible positive expectations for the change. Organization mem￾bers invariably have expectations about the results of organizational changes. The 
positive approaches to planned change described in Chapter 2 suggest that these 
expectations can play an important role in generating motivation for change.10
Expectations can serve as a self-fulfilling prophecy, leading members to invest 
energy in change programs that they expect will succeed. When members expect 
success, they are likely to develop greater commitment to the change process and 
to direct more energy into the constructive behaviors needed to implement it.11 The 
key to achieving these positive effects is to communicate realistic, positive expecta￾tions about the organizational changes. Research suggests that information about 
why the change is occurring, how it will benefit the organization, and how people 
will be involved in the design and implementation of the change was most helpful.12
Organization members also can be taught about the benefits of positive expectations 
and be encouraged to set credible positive expectations for the change program.
Overcoming Resistance to Change
Change can generate deep resistance in people and in organizations, thus making 
it difficult, if not impossible, to implement organizational improvements.13 At a per￾sonal level, change can arouse considerable anxiety about letting go of the known 
and moving to an uncertain future.14 People may be unsure whether their existing 
skills and contributions will be valued in the future, or may have significant questions 
about whether they can learn to function effectively and to achieve benefits in the 
2.
3.CHAPTER 10 Leading and Managing Change 167
new situation. At the organization level, resistance to change can come from three 
sources.15 Technical resistance comes from the habit of following common procedures 
and the consideration of sunk costs invested in the status quo. Political resistance can 
arise when organizational changes threaten powerful stakeholders, such as top execu￾tive or staff personnel, or call into question the past decisions of leaders.16 Organization 
change often implies a different allocation of already scarce resources, such as capital, 
training budgets, and good people. Finally, cultural resistance takes the form of systems 
and procedures that reinforce the status quo, promoting conformity to existing values, 
norms, and assumptions about how things should operate.
There are at least three major strategies for dealing with resistance to change:17
Empathy and support. A first step in overcoming resistance is learning how 
people are experiencing change. This strategy can identify people who are having 
trouble accepting the changes, the nature of their resistance, and possible ways 
to overcome it, but it requires a great deal of empathy and support. It demands a 
willingness to suspend judgment and to see the situation from another’s perspec￾tive, a process called active listening. When people feel that those people who are 
responsible for managing change are genuinely interested in their feelings and 
perceptions, they are likely to be less defensive and more willing to share their 
concerns and fears. This more open relationship not only provides useful informa￾tion about resistance but also helps establish the basis for the kind of joint problem 
solving needed to overcome barriers to change.
Communication. People resist change when they are uncertain about its conse￾quences. Lack of adequate information fuels rumors and gossip and adds to the 
anxiety generally associated with change. Effective communication about changes 
and their likely results can reduce this speculation and allay unfounded fears. It 
can help members realistically prepare for change. However, communication is 
also one of the most frustrating aspects of managing change. Organization mem￾bers constantly receive data about current operations and future plans as well as 
informal rumors about people, changes, and politics. Managers and OD practi￾tioners must think seriously about how to break through this stream of informa￾tion. One strategy is to make change information more salient by communicating 
through a new or different channel. If most information is delivered through 
memos and emails, then change information can be delivered through meetings 
and presentations. Another method that can be effective during large-scale change 
is to deliberately substitute change information for normal operating information. 
This sends a message that changing one’s activities is a critical part of one’s job.
Participation and involvement. One of the oldest and most effective strategies 
for overcoming resistance is to involve organization members directly in planning 
and implementing change. Participation can lead both to designing high- quality 
changes and to overcoming resistance to implementing them.18 Members can 
provide a diversity of information and ideas, which can contribute to making the 
innovations effective and appropriate to the situation. They also can identify pitfalls 
and barriers to implementation. Involvement in planning the changes increases 
the likelihood that members’ interests and needs will be accounted for during the 
intervention. Consequently, participants will be committed to implementing the 
changes because doing so will suit their interests and meet their needs. Moreover, 
for people having strong needs for involvement, the act of participation itself can 
be motivating, leading to greater effort to make the changes work.19
Application 10.1 describes how an OD consultant helped the sexual violence preven￾tion unit of the Minnesota Department of Health generate commitment to a change 
process when the unit’s leader left shortly after the change process began.20

3.Motivating Change in the Sexual Violence 
Prevention Unit of Minnesota’s Health 
Department
Addressing the prevention of sexual violence is a 
complex challenge. Unlike cigarette smoking or 
automobile accidents, sexual violence is not only 
a health issue, but a social issue connected to 
people’s attitudes, beliefs, norms, and taboos. The 
sexual violence prevention unit of Minnesota’s 
health department decided to undertake a five-year 
strategic planning effort to address the “primary 
prevention” of sexual violence. Primary preven￾tion is defined as activities that focus on preventing 
sexual violence before it occurs. While there have 
been numerous successful investments focused on 
dealing with victims or addressing what happens 
after an assault, there was a clear need for primary 
prevention.
There were two driving forces for the plan. First, 
the Centers for Disease Control had identified 
sexual violence as a key health issue and was 
providing grants to states for the development of 
primary prevention plans. Second, Minnesota was 
a recognized leader in sexual violence prevention 
work. The health department worked closely with 
the Minnesota Coalition Against Sexual Violence 
(MNCASA), a primary recipient of state funding, 
and other stakeholders who were working on sex￾ual violence prevention. This coalition had been 
meeting for several years to develop education in 
primary prevention and to engage in a cross-sector 
dialogue on the issue.
The two primary objectives of the project were to:
• Create a strategic plan for the primary pre￾vention of sexual violence in the state of 
Minnesota.
• Mobilize a broad range of individuals and organi￾zations to take action in the primary prevention 
of sexual violence.
This application describes the activities associ￾ated with motivating change within the sexual 
violence prevention unit to create the strategic 
planning process. Application 10.3 describes the 
activities associated with managing the various 
stakeholders involved with this change and the 
large-group intervention that kicked off the stra￾tegic planning and implementation effort.
Beginning the Project
The sexual violence prevention unit hired a 
local OD consulting firm to facilitate the strategic 
planning process. Everyone in the unit believed 
that strategic planning was the next right step. 
Community members wanted action. In fact, they 
had stopped meeting in a dialogue forum because 
they felt they were not making progress in address￾ing the issue systemically or strategically.
The project got off to a rough start. The day after 
the OD consultant began working with the unit, the 
unit director resigned. She had been a major force 
in bringing the project to fruition, and her departure 
represented a key challenge for the consultants. In 
the interim, the unit’s program director and adminis￾trator stepped in to provide content leadership with 
the help of the director of MNCASA. Her departure 
also created a strong need to mobilize the members of 
the unit and to recruit the necessary external stake￾holders with content knowledge and community 
reputation to galvanize action in the community.
To focus the key stakeholders on the change effort, 
the OD consultants met with the departing director 
to identify a range of community stakeholders to 
interview. The interviews were critical in building 
the consultants’ knowledge of the issue and quickly 
establishing relationships with key stakeholders. 
They also helped identify community members 
who could provide leadership on the project.
Motivating Commitment
As part of the internal effort to reinforce commit￾ment to the change process, a steering committee 
was formed. It consisted of project leaders from the 
health department, the OD consultants, and six 
community members. This committee was respon￾sible for identifying and recruiting other internal 
and external stakeholders to participate in the 
planning process. They also served as advisors to 
the OD consultants on selecting the best forum to 
conduct the planning, reviewing draft agendas, and 
providing feedback on plan drafts. They were asked 
to convene for two meetings as well as provide 
input on plans and written reports virtually.
application 10.1CHAPTER 10 Leading and Managing Change 169
All of the steering committee members were 
volunteers recruited by the project leaders and OD
consultants after the initial interviews. The 
OD consultants were part of the identification 
and recruitment process because they had formed 
relationships with several of the members through 
previous work and had established strong rap￾port through their interviews. The community 
members of the committee were chosen not 
only because of their expertise and history in the 
field, locally and nationally, but because they 
had good process skills. Another criterion for 
participation was diversity. It was important that 
this group include members who could speak 
for underrepresented groups, such as Native 
American, Hispanic, African American, and youth 
segments. Everyone who was asked to participate 
wanted to be part of this effort.
Despite this high level of commitment to the proj￾ect, time was a big constraint. To use time well, the 
consultants asked for two meetings. In between 
meetings, they drafted proposals for the group to 
react to, rather than asking members to decide on 
the work to be done by the group. When members 
could not be at a meeting, the consultants got their 
input individually, both before and after the meet￾ing. Because of their commitment to prevention, 
all of the steering committee members stayed in 
close contact with the consultants and responded 
promptly to all requests.
CREATING A VISION
The second activity in leading and managing change involves creating a vision of what 
members want the organization to look like or become. It is one of the most popular 
yet least understood practices in management.21 Generally, a vision describes the core 
values and purpose that guide the organization as well as an envisioned future toward 
which change is directed. It provides a valued direction for designing, implementing, 
and assessing organizational changes. The vision also can energize commitment to 
change by providing members with a common goal and a compelling rationale for why 
change is necessary and worth the effort. However, if the vision is seen as impossible 
or promotes changes that the organization cannot implement, it actually can depress 
member motivation. For example, George Bush’s unfulfilled “thousand points of light” 
vision was emotionally appealing, but it was too vague and contained little inherent 
benefit. In contrast, John Kennedy’s vision of “putting a man on the moon and return￾ing him safely to the earth” was just beyond engineering and technical feasibility. In 
the context of the 1960s, it was bold, alluring, and vivid; it provided not only a pur￾pose but a valued direction for the country. Recent research suggests that corporations 
with carefully crafted visions can significantly outperform the stock market over long 
periods of time.22
Creating a vision is considered a key element in most leadership frameworks.23
Organization or subunit leaders are responsible for effectiveness, and they must take 
an active role in describing a desired future and energizing commitment to it. In the 
best cases, leaders encourage participation in developing the vision to gain wider input 
and support. For example, they involve subordinates and others who have a stake 
in the changes. The popular media frequently offer accounts of executives who have 
helped to mobilize and direct organizational change, including Nobuhiko Kawamoto 
of Honda and Jack Welch at General Electric. Describing a desired future is no less 
CHAPTER 10 Leading and Managing Change170 PART 2 The Process of Organization Development
important for people leading change in small departments and work groups than for 
senior executives. At lower organizational levels, there are ample opportunities to 
involve employees directly in the visioning process.
Developing a vision is heavily driven by people’s values and preferences for what 
the organization should look like and how it should function. The envisioned future 
represents people’s ideals, fantasies, or dreams of what they would like the organiza￾tion to look like or become. Unfortunately, dreaming about the future is discouraged 
in most organizations because it requires creative and intuitive thought processes that 
tend to conflict with the rational, short-term, analytical methods prevalent there.24
Consequently, leaders may need to create special conditions in which to describe a 
desired future, such as off-site workshops or exercises that stimulate creative thinking.
Research suggests that compelling visions are composed of two parts: (1) a rela￾tively stable identity or core ideology that describes the organization’s core values 
and purpose, and (2) an envisioned future with bold goals and a vivid description of 
the desired future state that reflects the specific change under consideration.25
Describing the Core Ideology
The fundamental basis of a vision for change is the organization’s core ideology. It 
describes the organization’s core values and purpose and is relatively stable over time. 
Core values typically include three to five basic principles or beliefs that have stood the 
test of time and best represent what the organization stands for. Although the vision 
ultimately describes a desired future, it must acknowledge the organization’s historical 
roots—the intrinsically meaningful core values and principles that have guided and 
will guide the organization over time. Core values are not “espoused values”; they are 
the “values in use” that actually inform members what is important in the organiza￾tion. The retailer Nordstrom, for example, has clear values around the importance of 
customer service; toymaker Lego has distinct values around the importance of families; 
and the Disney companies have explicit values around wholesomeness and imagina￾tion. These values define the true nature of these firms and cannot be separated from 
them. Thus, core values are not determined or designed; they are discovered and 
described through a process of inquiry.
Members can spend considerable time and energy discovering their organiza￾tion’s core values through long discussions about organizational history, key events, 
founder’s beliefs, the work people actually do, and the “glue” that holds the organiza￾tion together.26 In many cases, organizations want the core values to be something they 
are not. For example, many U.S. firms want “teamwork” to be a core value despite 
strong cultural norms and organizational practices that reward individuality.
The organization’s core purpose is its reason for being, the idealistic motivation that 
brings people to work each day and gives work meaning.27 A core purpose is not a 
strategy. Purpose describes why the organization exists and the organization’s under￾standing of its image, brand, and reputation; strategy describes how an objective will 
be achieved. Research suggests that organization purposes may fall into one of four 
categories and that organizations often create a slogan or metaphor that captures the 
real reason they are in business.28 For example, Heroism, refers to a purpose that exorts 
members to do great things. Dell Computer, Microsoft, and Ford were all founded to 
change the world for the better. Henry Ford wanted to “build a machine to improve the 
world.” Discovery, a core purpose for Apple, Sony, and 3M, refers to an innate desire to 
learn new things. A third purpose, Altruism, infers a belief in serving others. Disney’s 
return to prominence in the late 1980s and 1990s was guided by the essential purpose 
of “making people happy” and Whole Foods, Ben and Jerry’s, and The Body Shop all 
take on the responsibility of being serving the greater good. Tata Corporation’s purpose 
of “what India needs next” has supported their growth for over 100 years. Finally, 
Bershire Hathaway and Toyota reflect the purpose of Excellence.CHAPTER 10 Leading and Managing Change 171
Hatch’s concept of organization identity is simlar to purpose and core ideology.29
Identity—the way core values, purpose, brand, and reputation are integrated—provides 
guidelines for the strategic choices that will work and can be implemented versus those 
that will not work because they contradict the true nature of the organization. Lawler 
and Worley suggested that the real power of an organization’s identity was its ability 
to consistently support and encourage change even though identity itself remained 
fairly stable.30 An envisioned future can be compelling and emotionally powerful to 
members only if it aligns with and supports the organization’s core values, purpose, 
and identity.31
Constructing the Envisioned Future
The core ideology provides the context for the envisioned future. Unlike core values 
and purpose, which are stable aspects of the organization and must be discovered, the 
envisioned future is specific to the change project at hand and must be created. The 
envisioned future varies in complexity and scope depending on the changes being 
considered. A relatively simple upgrading of a work group’s word-processing software 
requires a less complex envisioned future than the transformation of a government 
bureaucracy.
The envisioned future typically includes the following two elements that can be 
communicated to organization members:32
Bold and valued outcomes. Descriptions of envisioned futures often include 
specific performance and human outcomes that the organization or unit would like 
to achieve. These valued outcomes can serve as goals for the change process and 
standards for assessing progress. For example, BHAGs (Big, Hairy, Audacious Goals) 
are clear, tangible, energizing targets that serve as rallying points for organization 
action. They can challenge members to meet clear target levels of sales growth or 
customer satisfaction, to overcome key competitors, to achieve role-model status in 
the industry, or to transform the organization in some meaningful way. For exam￾ple, in 1990 Wal-Mart Stores made a statement of intent “to become a $125 billion 
company by the year 2000.” (Net sales in 1999 exceeded $137.6 billion.) Following 
the downsizing of the U.S. military budget, Rockwell proposed the following bold 
outcome for its change efforts: “Transform this company from a defense contractor 
into the best diversified high-technology company in the world.”
Desired future state. This element of the envisioned future specifies, in vivid 
detail, what the organization should look like to achieve bold and valued out￾comes. It is a passionate and engaging statement intended to draw organization 
members into the future. The organizational features described in the statement 
help define a desired future state toward which change activities should move. This 
aspect of the visioning process is exciting and compelling. It seeks to create a word 
picture that is emotionally powerful to members and motivates them to change.
Application 10.2 describes how Premier recognized the need for change and built a 
vision of the future for their organization.33
DEVELOPING POLITICAL SUPPORT
From a political perspective, organizations can be seen as loosely structured coalitions 
of individuals and groups having different preferences and interests.34 For example, 
shop-floor workers may want secure, high-paying jobs, and top executives may be 
interested in diversifying the organization into new businesses. The marketing depart￾ment might be interested in developing new products and markets, and the production 
department may want to manufacture standard products in the most efficient ways.

2.Creating a Vision at Premier
Premier (http://www.premierinc.com) is a leading 
health care alliance collectively owned by more 
than 200 independent hospitals and health care 
systems in the United States. Together, the owners 
operate or are affiliated with nearly 1,500 hospitals 
and other health care sites. Premier resulted from 
the 1995 merger of Chicago-based Premier Health 
Alliance, San Diego-based American Healthcare 
Systems, and The SunHealth Alliance of Charlotte, 
North Carolina. Premier offers a comprehensive 
array of services and products through its compan￾ies and business units, including group purchasing, 
consulting services, technology management ser￾vices, insurance services, benchmarking and market 
intelligence services, and legislative advocacy.
Two and a half years after the organization’s forma￾tion, a comprehensive organizational assessment 
suggested that Premier had not been successful in 
establishing a common organizational culture. Many 
of its services and employees continued to operate 
in a fractured or isolated fashion relating largely to 
their prior organization and its geographic location. 
As a result, Premier’s strategy and business model 
were poorly understood, and more importantly, 
not well implemented. The assessment pointed to 
a growing lack of trust in the organization. Premier 
executives conceded that the organization was 
culturally adrift and without a well-understood or 
widely accepted sense of direction.
Another key finding of the assessment con￾cerned the organization’s vision. Shortly after the 
merger, a new set of values, mission, and vision 
statements had been developed. The statements 
themselves were clear and compelling; however, 
they had been developed by a relatively small 
group of executives. At best, most employees did 
not feel much ownership of the values; at worst, 
they saw the failure of top management to behave 
consistently with the values as evidence that they 
were not trusted, supported, or important.
In the fall of 1997, Premier hired Richard Norling 
as COO. Norling had been a chief executive at one 
of the health care systems that owned Premier, 
and his arrival signaled the potential for change 
and new possibilities. At his former organization, 
Norling had initiated and sustained a comprehen￾sive OD effort, based on identifying core organi￾zational values and the behaviors that supported 
them. The experience of that health care system had 
demonstrated that core values shaped and accepted 
by an organization’s employees could build a deep 
sense of community in the organization, and lead to 
greater levels of trust and commitment that could 
be harnessed to enhance organization performance 
and effectiveness. Given Premier’s emerging prob￾lem, a similar approach made sense.
In the spring of 1998, Premier executives deter￾mined to address these issues by building on the 
values and mission statements that had been 
developed earlier. Their intent was to involve a 
large number of employees in validating Premier’s 
values, specifying the behaviors that supported 
them, and identifying ways in which the values 
could be integrated into the routines and pro￾cesses of the organization—all of which would 
(they hoped) infect the organization with a 
renewed sense of identity and enthusiasm.
The first step in Premier’s change process was plan￾ning and conducting a three-day 200-employee 
values conference. The conference was designed by 
a team of employees representing a diagonal slice 
of the organization and assisted by an OD prac￾titioner. At the conference, employees examined 
Premier’s business model and their organizational 
culture; developed and recommended a set of core 
organizational values for the organization; crafted 
an envisioned future; and identified and proposed 
strategies for employee involvement, integration, 
and organization transformation companywide.
Following the conference, the team of Premier 
employees who had planned the meeting was asked 
to become a permanent committee, charged with 
refining and implementing plans and recommenda￾tions that the conference participants had generated.
Ultimately, input was obtained from over 60% of 
the workforce and 16 actions were recommended 
and approved by senior management. Some of 
those actions included:
• Incorporating the values into Premier’s per￾formance management/performance appraisal 
system
• Incorporating the values into the recruitment 
and selection process by developing sample 
interview questions for use by hiring managers 
aimed at helping them learn whether prospec￾tive employees would be a good match to 
Premier’s organizational culture
application 10.2CHAPTER 10 Leading and Managing Change 173
• Instituting an annual meeting of approximately 
200 employees from all parts of Premier modeled 
after the 1998 values conference. The agenda 
should be focused on business issues, strategy, 
and organizational culture and values. Rotate 
those invited so that every Premier employee 
has an opportunity to attend every three to five 
years.
The outcome of the vision and values effort follows:
Core Values
6 Integrity of the individual and the enterprise
6 A passion for performance and a bias for 
action, creating real value for all stakehold￾ers, and leading the pace
6 Innovation: seeking breakthrough opportu￾nities, taking risks, and initiating meaningful 
change
6 Focus on people: showing concern and respect 
for all with whom we work, building collab￾orative relationships with the community, our 
customers, co-workers, and business associates
Core Purpose
To improve the health of communities
Core Roles of the Enterprise
6 Improve quality, reduce costs

FOUNDATION STATEMENTS
CORE IDEOLOGY
ENVISIONED FUTURE
10–30 Year Goal
Premier’s owners will be the leading health care systems in their markets, and, with them,
Premier will be the major influence in reshaping health care
Vivid Description
By the year 2020,we will have changed the world’s 
view of U.S. health care to “the best and most cost￾effective” at sustaining the good health of popula￾tions. In the United States, the health care industry 
will be considered the best managed and most 
innovative of all the economic sectors.
Across the nation, our owners, physicians, and other 
allies will lead the local transformations that are the 
building blocks of a reshaped health care system.
These transformations will begin to make public 
health and health services indistinguishable, engaging 
citizens and civic resources in endeavors that attack 
the causes of illness and injury. Through efforts 
that go far beyond providing treatment, people will 
have a sense of responsibility for their own personal 
health and the health of their communities.
Together in Premier, we will invent new and supe￾rior models of delivering health services, and we 
will leverage the size, linkages, and resources of 
Premier to deliver those services to more people, 
at a lower cost and higher quality, than any oth￾ers. Our owners will operate at costs in the lowest 
quarter among all similar organizations at qual￾ity levels in the highest quarter. We will research 
and use the most effective and seamless clinical 
approaches to achieve superior health outcomes 
and increased values. Our competitive edge will be 
the unmatched ability to transfer and act on our 
collective experience and innovation.
Our owners will earn recognition as the most val￾ued community resource for health. As a result of 
their efforts,“Premier” will be viewed as the hall￾mark of quality and value that all others seek to 
emulate. When people see our emblem, they will 
associate it with health care improvement and 
advances in health status.
Demonstrating a better way and supported by 
our constituencies, we will build consensus for 
national policy directions that stimulate and 
reward health and healthy communities.
We will indeed be premier.174 PART 2 The Process of Organization Development
These different groups or coalitions compete with one another for scarce resources and 
influence. They act to preserve or enhance their self-interests while managing to arrive 
at a sufficient balance of power to sustain commitment to the organization and achieve 
overall effectiveness.
Given this political view, attempts to change the organization often threaten the 
balance of power among groups, thus resulting in political conflicts and struggles.35
Individuals and groups will be concerned with how the changes affect their own power 
and influence, and they will act accordingly. Some groups will become less powerful; 
others will gain influence. Those whose power is threatened by the change will act 
defensively and seek to preserve the status quo. For example, they may try to present 
compelling evidence that change is unnecessary or that only minor modifications are 
needed. On the other hand, those participants who will gain power from the changes 
will push heavily for them, perhaps bringing in seemingly impartial consultants to 
legitimize the need for change. Consequently, significant organizational changes are 
frequently accompanied by conflicting interests, distorted information, and political 
turmoil.
Methods for managing the political dynamics of organizational change are relatively 
recent additions to OD. Traditionally, OD has neglected political issues mainly because 
its humanistic roots promoted collaboration and power sharing among individuals and 
groups.36 Today, change agents are paying increased attention to power and politi￾cal activity, particularly as they engage in strategic change involving most parts and 
features of organizations. Some practitioners are concerned, however, about whether 
power and OD are compatible.
A growing number of advocates suggest that OD practitioners can use power in 
positive ways.37 They can build their own power base to gain access to other power 
holders within the organization. Without such access, those who influence or make 
decisions may not have the advantage of an OD perspective. OD practitioners can use 
power strategies that are open and aboveboard to get those in power to consider OD 
applications. They can facilitate processes for examining the uses of power in organiza￾tions and help power holders devise more creative and positive strategies than political 
bargaining, deceit, and the like. They can help power holders confront the need for 
change and can help ensure that the interests and concerns of those with less power 
are considered. Although OD professionals can use power constructively in organiza￾tions, they probably will continue to be ambivalent and tense about whether such uses 
promote OD values and ethics or whether they represent the destructive, negative side 
of power. That tension seems healthy, and we hope that it will guide the wise use of 
power in OD.
As implied in Figure 10.2, managing the political dynamics of change includes the 
following activities: assessing the change agent’s power, identifying key stakeholders, 
and influencing stakeholders.
Assessing Change Agent Power
The first task is to evaluate the change agent’s own sources of power. This agent may 
be the leader of the organization or department undergoing change, or he or she may 
be the OD consultant if professional help is being used. By assessing their own power 
base, change agents can determine how to use it to influence others to support changes. 
They also can identify areas in which they need to enhance their sources of power.
Greiner and Schein, in the first OD book written entirely from a power perspective,
identified three key sources of personal power in organizations (in addition to one’s for￾mal position): knowledge, personality, and others’ support.38 Knowledge bases of power 
include having expertise that is valued by others and controlling important information. 
OD professionals typically gain power through their expertise in organizational change. CHAPTER 10 Leading and Managing Change 175
Personality sources of power can derive from change agents’ charisma, reputation, and 
professional credibility. Charismatic leaders can inspire devotion and enthusiasm for 
change from subordinates. OD consultants with strong reputations and professional 
credibility can wield considerable power during organ izational change. Others’ support 
can contribute to individual power by providing access to information and resource 
networks. Others also may use their power on behalf of the change agent. For example, 
leaders in organizational units undergoing change can call on their informal networks 
for resources and support, and encourage subordinates to exercise power in support of 
the change.
Identifying Key Stakeholders
Having assessed their own power bases, change agents should identify powerful individ￾uals and groups with an interest in the changes, such as staff groups, unions, departmen￾tal managers, and top-level executives. These key stakeholders can thwart or support 
change, and it is important to gain broad-based support to minimize the risk that a single 
interest group will block the changes. As organizations have become more global, net￾worked, and customer focused, and change has become more strategic, it is also impor￾tant to identity key external stakeholders. Customers, regulatory agencies, suppliers, and 
the local community, for example, can exert considerable influence over change.
Identifying key stakeholders can start with the simple question, “Who stands to gain 
or to lose from the changes?” Once stakeholders are identified, creating a map of their 
influence may be useful.39 The map could show relationships among the stakeholders 
in terms of who influences whom and what the stakes are for each party. This would 
provide change agents with information about which people and groups need to be 
influenced to accept and support the changes.
Influencing Stakeholders
This activity involves gaining the support of key stakeholders to motivate a critical mass 
for change. There are at least three major strategies for using power to influence others 
in OD: playing it straight, using social networks, and going around the formal system.40
Figure 10.2 links these strategies to the individual sources of power discussed above.
Text not available due to copyright restrictions176 PART 2 The Process of Organization Development
The strategy of playing it straight is very consistent with an OD perspective, and thus 
it is the most widely used power strategy in OD. It involves determining the needs of 
particular stakeholders and presenting information about how the changes can benefit 
them. This relatively straightforward approach is based on the premise that information 
and knowledge can persuade people about the need and direction for change. The success 
of this strategy relies heavily on the change agent’s knowledge base. He or she must have 
the expertise and information to persuade stakeholders that the changes are a logical way 
to meet their needs. For example, a change agent might present diagnostic data, such as 
company reports on productivity and absenteeism or surveys of members’ perceptions of 
problems, to generate a felt need for change among specific stakeholders. Other persuasive 
evidence might include educational material and expert testimony, such as case studies and 
research reports, demonstrating how organizational changes can address pertinent issues.
The second power strategy, using social networks, is more foreign to OD and involves 
forming alliances and coalitions with other powerful individuals and groups, dealing 
directly with key decision makers, and using formal and informal contacts to gain 
information. In this strategy, change agents attempt to use their social relationships 
to gain support for changes. As shown in Figure 10.2, they use the individual power 
base of others’ support to gain the resources, commitment, and political momentum 
needed to implement change. This social networking might include, for example, 
meeting with other powerful groups and forming alliances to support specific changes. 
This would likely involve ensuring that the interests of the different parties—labor and 
management, for example—are considered in the change process. Many union and 
management quality-of-work-life efforts involve forming such alliances. This strategy 
also might include using informal contacts to discover key roadblocks to change and to 
gain access to major decision makers who need to sanction the changes.
The power strategy of going around the formal system is probably least used in OD 
and involves purposely circumventing organizational structures and procedures to get 
the changes made. Existing organizational arrangements can be roadblocks to change, 
and working around the barriers may be more expedient and effective than taking the 
time and energy to remove them. As shown in Figure 10.2, this strategy relies on a 
strong personality base of power. The change agent’s charisma, reputation, or profes￾sional credibility lend legitimacy to going around the system and can reduce the likeli￾hood of negative reprisals. For example, managers with reputations as winners often 
can bend the rules to implement organizational changes. Their judgment is trusted by 
those whose support they need to enact the changes. This power strategy is relatively 
easy to abuse, however, and OD practitioners should consider carefully the ethical issues 
and possible unintended consequences of circumventing formal policies and practices.
Application 10.3 shows how Minnesota’s sexual violence prevention unit recruited 
external and internal stakeholders into the strategic planning process. They used the 
social networks of people with clear interests in the subject to support the planning 
and implementation of change.
MANAGING THE TRANSITION
Implementing organization change involves moving from an existing organization state 
to a desired future state. Such movement does not occur immediately but, as shown in 
Figure 10.3, instead requires a transition period during which the organization learns 
how to implement the conditions needed to reach the desired future. Beckhard and 
Harris pointed out that the transition may be quite different from the present state of the 
organization and consequently may require special management structures and activi￾ties.41 They identified three major activities and structures to facilitate organizational 
transition: activity planning, commitment planning, and change-management struc￾tures. A fourth set of activities involves managing the learning process during change.Developing Political Support for the Strategic 
Planning Project in the Sexual Violence 
Prevention Unit
Application 10.1 described the beginning of the 
sexual violence prevention unit’s project to develop 
a five-year plan for primary prevention. The plan’s 
unique purpose was to mobilize statewide efforts 
to prevent sexual violence before it occurs. In this 
application, the process that the committee used to 
identify and manage the political stakeholders—
both internal and external—is described.
Identifying and Recruiting Stakeholder 
Participation
The steering committee interviewed representa￾tives from various stakeholder groups, coalitions, 
and state agencies. The results of the interviews 
suggested (1) a need for broad involvement, espe￾cially from underrepresented groups, such as com￾munities of color, immigrant communities, gay and 
lesbian groups, and youth and (2) a desire among 
those involved to move from a period of dialogue 
and education toward taking collective action.
In response to this data, the OD consultant pro￾posed a two-day strategic planning retreat for 
a large group of stakeholders. This format was 
selected because of the strong desire voiced in 
the interviews to get to action. The steering com￾mittee confirmed this approach was preferable 
to stretching the planning over weeks of shorter 
meetings.
The unit administrator was essential in pulling 
together the list of stakeholders who were invited 
to participate. The goal was to get as many stake￾holders as possible involved, and she knew the 
majority of people who were active in sexual vio￾lence prevention work in the state. The steering 
committee reviewed and augmented the initial 
list to create a diverse group of 80 stakeholders to 
invite to the retreat. This group included people 
from the many groups, coalitions, state agen￾cies, and underrepresented communities across 
Minnesota.
Invitations to attend the retreat were sent out via 
email. The OD consultants crafted the invitation 
and the Health Unit Director sent them out. The 
steering committee members also contacted per￾sonally any invitees they knew and encouraged 
them to attend. The Health Unit Administrator 
was instrumental in communicating with those 
invited. Follow-up reminders and phone calls 
were made to ensure that an RSVP was received 
from everyone invited to attend. In addition, there 
were regular communications on the progress of 
the planning effort in newsletters, meetings, and 
conferences through strong communication chan￾nels that were already in place. An important 
constraint to this process was the nature of the 
physical facility that was to hold the meeting (see 
below). The steering committee had to balance 
the need for broad participation with the limits of 
the meeting space. One tool they used was to limit 
participation to the first 50 people who signed up. 
This encouraged people to sign up early to secure 
their space at the retreat.
Because primary sexual violence prevention was 
a central concern to most of these stakeholders, 
there was little resistance in terms of interest in 
participating. Other hurdles, however, had to 
be addressed, including the costs associated with 
attending the conference, travel issues, and the 
time to attend. The Health Department was able 
to secure funding to cover participants’ costs. 
However, the steering committee had to work 
hard to find a meeting site that was within com￾muting distance from many cities but that would 
was also be able to provide rooms for those travel￾ing from the out-state area.
Given the budget constraints and the diverse 
needs of this group, there were challenges secur￾ing a suitable meeting location. In the end, a 
Catholic retreat center fit many of the physical 
requirements of the conference, but presented 
another set of challenges. For a few stakeholder 
groups, there were negative perceptions about the 
perceived role of the church in sexual violence, 
the location lacked air conditioning, and there 
was no handicap access.
The planners of the project were also able to build on 
several efforts that the health department had pre￾viously used to gain stakeholder involvement. For 
several years, the department hosted a forum called 
the Sexual Violence Prevention Action Council. This 
application 10.3178 PART 2 The Process of Organization Development
group had been engaged in education and dialogue 
on the issue. Diverse stakeholders were already 
coming together around the issues and had adopted 
a framework developed by the Prevention Institute 
called the “Spectrum of Prevention.” Without this 
foundational work, it would have been risky to 
attempt to get stakeholders aligned around a strate￾gic plan in a two-day meeting.
Finally, another tool the steering committee initi￾ated for gaining involvement was an online sur￾vey. This survey was sent to all invitees so that 
even those who could not attend the retreat would 
have a voice in the planning. The survey was also 
sent to others who were not invited to the retreat 
and people were encouraged to pass the survey 
on to other stakeholders who might be interested 
in this plan. Close to 100 people responded to the 
survey. A majority of respondents provided con￾tact information and volunteered to help with the 
plan implementation.
Conducting the Meeting
Fifty invitees were able to attend the planning 
retreat. Using a large-group process over two 
days, participants worked together to create the 
framework of a strategic plan. Part of the planned 
agenda was to have stakeholders sign up for an 
action team toward the end of the two days. The 
dilemma faced during the session was in trying 
to get both focused strategies and a very diverse 
group of stakeholders to take action. Actions 
would need to occur both at the state level and 
within individual communities. The steering com￾mittee was not sure, going into the meeting, that 
team sign-up process would work. They agreed to 
meet during lunch on the second day to review 
the work and determine how to move the group 
toward action.
During the lunch meeting, the group decided 
that the strategies were not clear enough to cre￾ate teams at the meeting. While the group was 
concerned about losing people’s action commit￾ment, they believed it was more important to 
have teams that made strategic sense and utilized 
limited resources well. After lunch, the strategies 
and success indicators were posted on the wall. 
Consultants then used a multivoting process to 
identify six priorities for action.
Following the retreat, the OD consultants devel￾oped a proposed structure for action around 
these six priorities and sent this to the steering 
committee members for review. Their feedback 
was incorporated into an action structure that 
was included in the written strategic plan. Health 
department staff members then took over the 
planning and launching of these teams.
Sustaining Momentum
When the strategic planning project had begun, 
the head of the sexual violence prevention unit 
had left the organization, and the position had 
gone unfilled throughout the project. Just prior 
to the retreat, a well-known state leader in sexual 
violence work, Patty Wetterling, agreed to fill the 
position. Seventeen years earlier, Wetterling’s 
young son had been abducted in their small 
Minnesota town and was never found. Her work 
in establishing new laws regarding abductions as 
an advocate and state legislator, as well as a run 
for the U.S. Senate, made Wetterling a perfect 
choice to provide statewide leadership in imple￾menting the strategic plan.
Activity Planning
Activity planning involves making a road map for change, citing specific activities and 
events that must occur if the transition is to be successful. It should clearly identify, 
temporally orient, and integrate discrete change tasks, and it should explicitly link 
these tasks to the organization’s change goals and priorities. Activity planning also 
should gain top-management approval, be cost effective, and remain adaptable as feed￾back is received during the change process.CHAPTER 10 Leading and Managing Change 179
An important feature of activity planning is that visions and desired future states can 
be quite general when compared with the realities of implementing change. As a result, it 
may be necessary to supplement them with midpoint goals as part of the activity plan.42
Such goals represent desirable organizational conditions between the current state and 
the desired future state. For example, if the organization is implementing continuous 
improvement processes, an important midpoint goal can be the establishment of a certain 
number of improvement teams focused on understanding and controlling key work pro￾cesses. Midpoint goals are clearer and more detailed than desired future states, and thus 
they provide more concrete and manageable steps and benchmarks for change. Activity 
plans can use midpoint goals to provide members with the direction and security they 
need to work toward the desired future.
Commitment Planning
This activity involves identifying key people and groups whose commitment is needed 
for change to occur and formulating a strategy for gaining their support. Although 
commitment planning is generally a part of developing political support, discussed 
above, specific plans for identifying key stakeholders and obtaining their commitment 
to change need to be made early in the change process.
Change-Management Structures
Because organizational transitions tend to be ambiguous and to need direction, special 
structures for managing the change process need to be created. These management 
structures should include people who have the power to mobilize resources to pro￾mote change, the respect of the existing leadership and change advocates, and the 
interpersonal and political skills to guide the change process. Alternative management 
structures include the following:43
The chief executive or head person manages the change effort.
A project manager temporarily is assigned to coordinate the transition.
A steering committee of representatives from the major constituencies involved in 
the change jointly manage the project.
Natural leaders who have the confidence and trust of large numbers of affected 
employees are selected to manage the transition.
A cross section of people representing different organizational functions and levels 
manages the change.
A “kitchen cabinet” representing people whom the chief executive consults with 
and confides in manages the change effort.
Learning Processes
Most organization changes involve the acquisition of new knowledge and skills that 
support new behaviors. Research at the Center for Effective Organizations suggests that 
change can be implemented more quickly when leaders consciously design learning

[Figure 10.3]180 PART 2 The Process of Organization Development
processes into the transition.44 Four practices, supported by a continuous dialogue and 
conversation process, were associated with accelerated transitions. The first learning 
practice, creating a system view of the organization, involves creating a model of work 
and change that allows individual organizational members to see how their efforts con￾tribute to organizational functioning and performance. When people can see how their 
efforts support change, it is easier for them to pick up new skills and knowledge; there 
is a context created that demands new behaviors.
The second learning practice, creating shared meaning, describes the use of models, 
language, tools, and processes that provide people with a way to making sense of the 
change. Most organization change is accompanied by considerable anxiety as the orga￾nization begins moving from the known to the unknown. By creating common ways 
of viewing the change, work, customers, and the new organization, people develop a 
shared view of the new reality. This shared view lowers anxiety and allows organiza￾tion members to learn new skills and behaviors more quickly.
Engaging in “after-action reviews” or other processes that reflect on experience is 
the third learning practice. In this activity, initial attempts to try out new activities, 
new processes, or new behaviors are assessed and reviewed. Organization members 
get to ask, “how well did we do?” and “what can we learn from that?” The answers 
to these questions are then used to redesign or redefine correct behavior and applied 
again. When people get timely and supportive feedback on new behaviors, their ability 
to learn more quickly increases.
The final learning practice involves decentralizing implementation processes and deci￾sions to the lowest levels possible in the organization, what the researchers called “local 
self-design.” Complex organization change contains too many variables, uncertainties, 
and local contingencies to be completely programmed from the top of the organization. 
By allowing organizational units in the lower organization levels to be responsible for 
the implementation of change, the overall change is accelerated. It is important in this 
process of local self-design to ensure that the organizational units have a clear under￾standing of their boundaries. That is, senior leaders in the organization need to be clear 
about what resources are available for change, the timeline within which the change 
must occur, and the things that cannot be changed in achieving the change goals.
These four learning practices are held together by conversation and dialogue. More 
than any other single practice, it is the opportunity to discuss the organization change—
to create shared meaning, to understand how each individual fits into the change, to 
reflect on experience, and to discuss the change at local levels—that integrates the prac￾tices and accelerates implementation. Leading change, therefore, is largely a function of 
creating opporutnities for organization members to discuss change activities.
Application 10.4 shows how Hewlett-Packard and Compaq used all of these techniques 
to manage the integration activities associated with this acquisition. Despite research 
indications of a high proportion of failed acquisition processes, the extraordinary detail 
used in this process, and the bank of institutionalized knowledge (see Application 11.2), 
the HP–Compaq integration process received very positive reviews.45
SUSTAINING MOMENTUM
Once organizational changes are under way, explicit attention must be directed to 
sustaining energy and commitment for implementing them. The initial excitement 
and activity of changing often dissipate in the face of practical problems of trying to 
learn new ways of operating. A strong tendency exists among organization members 
to return to old behaviors and well-known processes unless they receive sustained sup￾port and reinforcement for carrying the changes through to completion. In this section, 
we present approaches for sustaining momentum for change. The subsequent tasks 
of assessing and stabilizing changes are discussed in Chapter 11. The following five Transition Management in the HP–Compaq 
Acquisition
In the Fall of 2001, Carly Fiorina announced 
HP’s intent to acquire Compaq Corporation. Over 
the next nine months, a proxy fight ensued as 
many shareholders and employees challenged 
the wisdom of the proposed change. Wall Street 
analysts and organization researchers too debated 
whether or not the acquisition made sense, espe￾cially given the size of the change and the rather 
dismal history of performance in acquisition 
cases. Scott McNealy, chief executive of rival Sun 
Microsystems Inc., predicted “a slow-motion col￾lision of two garbage trucks.”
Within days of the initial announcement, how￾ever, Fiorina and Michael Capellas, then CEO of 
Compaq, met with Webb McKinney, a 19-year HP 
veteran, and Jeff Clarke, Compaq’s CFO and survi￾vor of Compaq’s acquisition of Digital Equipment 
Corporation. These two men were named to lead 
the transition process, one that would involve rede￾ploying a combined 145,000 workers in 160 coun￾tries including more than 15,000 layoffs, untangling 
163 overlapping product lines, and producing 
$2.5 billion dollars in promised cost reductions.
It was no accident that McKinney and Clarke were 
asked to lead the integration team. Both were senior 
managers with substantial followings and excel￾lent reputations. Days after their initial meeting, 
they began recruiting managers in equal numbers; 
Clarke rounded up Compaq talent and McKinney 
lined up their HP matches. Within weeks of the 
merger’s announcement, the integration group, 
called the “clean team,” had 500 members; by 
March 2002, more than 900. Even after the merger 
closed in May 2002, it kept growing, peaking at 
more than 1,000 full-time employees. By establish￾ing such a huge body of outstanding managers and 
reassuring them that their jobs would be safe even 
if the merger failed, Clarke and McKinney were 
able to coax them to share in confidence everything 
they knew. It also kept most of them motivated to 
stay—another critical benchmark.
In addition to getting the right people on board, 
McKinney and Clarke set up an assembly line 
for decision making. Their research on successful 
and unsuccessful acquisitions and Clarke’s experi￾ence with the Digital acquisition, convinced them 
that slow decision making and the lack of a clear 
decision-making process was like a cancer in the 
transition process. In response, they created the 
“adopt and go” strategy: Get cross-company pairs 
of managers to meet daily to determine the best 
choice or best course of action on any particular 
issue. Weekly meetings kept the pace fast. If any 
issues couldn’t be resolved by the teams, McKinney 
and Clarke would jump in. If those two couldn’t 
resolve the impasse, they’d pass it to a committee 
chaired by Fiorina.
In addition to getting the right people on board 
and setting up a decision process built for speed, 
the transition team organized to create activity 
plans for the key issues facing the integration, 
including people, products, culture, day-one 
activities, and day-to-day operations. Excerpts 
and examples from some of those plans are over￾viewed below.
• The “adopt and go” process was used to decide 
which products to keep and which to discontinue. 
At weekly presentations with McKinney and 
Clarke, managers had to offer up one for elimi￾nation. In contrast to Compaq’s merger with 
Digital, HP executives made quick product deci￾sions and every week pored over progress charts 
with red, green, and yellow markers to review 
how each product exit was proceeding. Red and 
yellow markers indicated a task was troubled; 
green signaled a task going well. In four months, 
a road map for product lines emerged and helped 
to close redundant warehouses and factories, 
ultimately saving $500 million in procurement 
costs. In the end, while many Compaq products 
beat out HP’s, such as Compaq’s iPac over HP’s 
Jornada, the HP brand survived.
• The “adopt and go” process also helped HP make 
the hard decisions about personnel appointments. 
HP appointed its top three tiers of executives 
before the acquisition was finalized and made new 
levels of appointments every few weeks. While 
not perfect—rumors that Compaq people were 
favored in the sales organization—Clarke con￾tends that all decisions were made “by the book.”
application 10.4182 PART 2 The Process of Organization Development
• HP created a team to deal specifically with 
melding the corporate cultures and hired con￾sultants to document the differences. To address 
perceptions that Compaq employees were “shoot 
from the hip cowboys” and that HP staff were 
“bureaucrats,” the team created a series of cul￾tural workshops. They were designed to identify 
the various cultures and subcultures, and then 
integrate them. For example, key sales manag￾ers and about two dozen salespeople from both 
HP and Compaq held a workshop designed to 
address sales integration and transition issues. 
Many attendees first looked at each other sus￾piciously. Following some ice-breaker exercises, 
however, an HP representative talked about 
how they had been working with key customer 
SBC, the telecommunications company. That 
was followed by a Compaq rep discussing how 
they sold to SBC. Then the big group drew up 
a 100-day work plan for selling to SBC in the 
future, including a weekly conference call for 
the team every Friday. The progress from these 
sessions was tracked by a team of 650 part-time 
internal “cultural consultants,” who also contin￾ued in their normal jobs at the company.
The cultural workshops delivered in the first 
quarter after the deal was signed set the stage for 
a further cultural integration. The workshops wel￾comed everyone to the new team, described the 
HP business, HP’s values and operating models, 
the roles and objectives of different groups, and 
how people were expected to work together. All 
of this material was pushed out into the HP market 
before the launch, inviting a few thousand of the 
top HP managers to an orientation and education 
session on what to do, how to communicate, and 
the details of the new HP and their roles in it.
• The clean team also made extensive “day one” 
plans. Day one readiness included plans to 
address customers, issues of leadership and 
structure, and internal administrative issues. 
The new HP was launched with everyone on 
the same email, not a paycheck missed, and 
every sign changed the morning of launch day. 
Customers participated heavily in the transi￾tion process. Customer councils, interviews, 
research, information sessions, education, and 
other data were included in the knowledge 
transfer to groups that faced the customer. 
The go-to-market plans were detailed, with 
playbooks given to each group manager who 
touched the customers, so that on launch 
day they knew what to do, what to say to 
a customer, where to get information. Each 
customer was given a buddy from the other 
company at the same level so that he or she 
could contact that person and get whatever 
information the customer needed. There was 
an enormous amount of detail, down to the 
script of what to say, what answers to give to 
specific questions, where to get further infor￾mation, and how to transition an inquiry to 
the right person.
By most measures, the work has paid off: HP has 
met the integration goals that Chairman and Chief 
Executive Carleton S. Fiorina set for the merged 
company. The biggest of these is cost-savings, which 
have surpassed expectations. By mid-2003, HP said 
it saved $734 million—14% more than projected—
from payroll cuts and better terms with its suppliers.
activities can help to sustain momentum for carrying change through to completion: 
providing resources for change, building a support system for change agents, develop￾ing new competencies and skills, reinforcing new behaviors, and staying the course.
Providing Resources for Change
Implementing organization change generally requires additional financial and human 
resources, particularly if the organization continues day-to-day operations while trying 
to change itself. These extra resources are needed for such change activities as train￾ing, consultation, data collection and feedback, and special meetings. Extra resources CHAPTER 10 Leading and Managing Change 183
also are helpful to provide a buffer as performance drops during the transition period. 
Organizations can underestimate seriously the need for special resources devoted to 
the change process. Significant organizational change invariably requires considerable 
management time and energy, as well as the help of consultants. A separate “change 
budget” that exists along with capital and operating budgets can earmark the resources 
needed for training members in how to behave differently and for assessing progress 
and making necessary modifications in the change program.46 Unless these extra 
resources are planned for and provided, meaningful change is less likely to occur.
Building a Support System for Change Agents
Organization change can be difficult and filled with tension, not only for participants 
but for change agents as well.47 They often must often give members emotional support, 
but they may receive little support themselves. They often must maintain “psychological 
distance” from others to gain the perspective needed to lead the change process. This 
separation can produce considerable tension and isolation, and change agents may need 
to create their own support system to help them cope with such problems. A support 
system typically consists of a network of people with whom the change agent has close 
personal relationships—people who can give emotional support, serve as a sounding 
board for ideas and problems, and challenge untested assumptions. For example, OD 
professionals often use trusted colleagues as “shadow consultants” to help them think 
through difficult issues with clients and to offer conceptual and emotional support. 
Similarly, a growing number of companies, such as Procter & Gamble, The Hartford, 
TRW, and The Limited Brands, are forming internal networks of change agents to pro￾vide mutual learning and support.
Developing New Competencies and Skills
Organizational changes frequently demand new knowledge, skills, and behaviors from 
organization members. In many cases, the changes cannot be implemented unless 
members gain new competencies. For example, employee-involvement programs 
often require managers to learn new leadership styles and new approaches to problem 
solving. Change agents must ensure that such learning occurs. They need to provide 
multiple learning opportunities, such as traditional training programs, on-the-job coun￾seling and coaching, and experiential simulations, covering both technical and social 
skills. Because it is easy to overlook the social component, change agents may need to 
devote special time and resources to helping members gain the social skills required 
to implement changes. As part of McKesson’s commitment to quality, the corporation 
identified specially selected high performers to become six-sigma black belts and then 
promoted them accordingly to signal the importance of these skills and knowledge in 
career planning. In addition, senior managers in all of the divisions are required to 
attend training that builds new problem-solving skills, team behaviors, and a commit￾ment to the quality philosophy.48
Reinforcing New Behaviors
In organizations, people generally do those things that bring them rewards. Consequently, 
one of the most effective ways to sustain momentum for change is to reinforce the 
kinds of behaviors needed to implement the changes. This can be accomplished by 
linking formal rewards directly to the desired behaviors. For example, Integra Financial 
encouraged more teamwork by designing a rewards and recognition program in which 
the best team players got both financial rewards and management attention, and 
a variety of behaviors aimed at promoting self-interest were directly discouraged.49
(Chapter 17 discusses several reward-system interventions.) In addition, desired behav￾iors can be reinforced more frequently through informal recognition, encouragement, 184 PART 2 The Process of Organization Development
and praise. Perhaps equally important are the intrinsic rewards that people can experi￾ence through early success in the change effort. Achieving identifiable early successes 
can make participants feel good about themselves and their behaviors, and thus rein￾force the drive to change.
Staying the Course
Change requires time, and many of the expected financial and organizational ben￾efits from change lag behind its implementation. If the organization changes again 
too quickly or abandons the change before it is fully implemented, the desired results 
may never materialize. There are two primary reasons that managers do not keep 
a steady focus on change implementation. First, many managers fail to anticipate 
the decline in performance, productivity, or satisfaction as change is implemented. 
Organization members need time to practice, develop, and learn new behaviors; they 
do not abandon old ways of doing things and adopt a new set of behaviors overnight. 
Moreover, change activities, such as training, extra meetings, and consulting assis￾tance, are extra expenses added onto current operating expenditures. There should 
be little surprise, therefore, that effectiveness declines before it gets better. However, 
perfectly good change projects often are abandoned when questions are raised about 
short-term performance declines. Patience and trust in the diagnosis and interven￾tion design work are necessary.
Second, many managers do not keep focused on a change because they want to 
implement the next big idea that comes along. When organizations change before they 
have to, in response to the latest management fad, a “flavor-of-the-month” cynicism 
can develop. As a result, organization members provide only token support to a change 
under the (accurate) notion that the current change won’t last. Successful organiza￾tional change requires persistent leadership that does not waver unnecessarily.
Application 10.5 describes the transformation at the Veterans Hospital 
Administration and how the leadership team sustained momentum for change by 
instituting a performance management system and utilizing evaluation feedback to 
modify the change process.50
SUMMARY
In this chapter, we described five kinds of activities that change agents must carry out 
when planning and implementing changes. The first activity is motivating change, 
which involves creating a readiness for change among organization members and over￾coming their resistance. The second activity concerns creating a vision that builds on 
an organization’s core ideology. It describes an envisioned future that includes a bold 
and valued outcome and a vividly described desired future state. The core ideology and 
envisioned future articulate a compelling reason for implementing change. The third 
task for change agents is developing political support for the changes. Change agents 
first must assess their own sources of power, then identify key stakeholders whose sup￾port is needed for change and devise strategies for gaining their support. The fourth 
activity concerns managing the transition of the organization from its current state to 
the desired future state. This requires planning a road map for the change activities, as 
well as planning how to gain commitment for the changes. It also may involve creating 
special change-management structures and a set of learning processes that accelerate 
the transition. The fifth change task is sustaining momentum for the changes so that 
they are carried to completion. This includes providing resources for the change pro￾gram, creating a support system for change agents, developing new competencies and 
skills, reinforcing the new behaviors required to implement the changes, and staying 
the course.CHAPTER 10 Leading and Managing Change 185

at the Veterans Health Administration
The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is a 
federally funded and centrally administered health 
care system for veterans. It is one of the country’s 
largest health care delivery systems, with 172 
hospitals, 132 nursing homes, 73 home health 
care programs, 40 residential care programs, and 
more than 600 outpatient clinics. The VHA’s 1999 
budget of over $17 million covered a workforce of 
approximately 180,000 individuals.
In the mid-1990s, a number of pressures threat￾ened the organization’s existence and its ability to 
change, including an overreliance on outmoded 
and unprofitable in-patient services; a series of 
health care reforms that threatened to place the 
VHA in direct competition with more efficient, 
for-profit, managed care organizations; a congres￾sional budgeting process that threatened to freeze 
the organization’s budget; and a primary customer 
base that was aging and dwindling. In addition, 
the agency’s management systems and culture 
were deeply rooted in a command-and-control, 
military-style mind-set. Decision making was 
highly centralized and bureaucratic. Politically, 
the VHA had multiple stakeholders with differ￾ent and sometimes conflicting interests regarding 
agency priorities and activities. Finally, the VHA 
operated within a framework of extensive rules 
and regulations that constrained the agency’s abil￾ity to adapt, limited the agency’s ability to treat 
patients on an outpatient basis, or contract for 
services with private-sector organizations.
In response to these conditions, Congress 
appointed Dr. Kenneth Kizer, an organizational 
outsider, to transform the VHA. Dr. Kizer pulled 
together a leadership team composed mostly of 
respected insiders and developed a vision for 
change and related documents that provided a 
comprehensive statement of purpose and goals 
for the transformation. The documents made clear 
that the “transformation would fundamentally 
change the way veterans health care is provided” 
and that this would include “increasing ambula￾tory care access points and a marked emphasis on 
providing primary care, decentralizing decision 
making, and integrating the delivery assets to 
provide a seamless continuum of care.” The vision 
documents also established high standards for 
the transformation. The VHA was to provide care 
at a level that “must be demonstratively equal 
to, or better than, what is available in the local 
community.”
In cooperation with Congress, important reforms 
were initiated, including patient eligibility 
requirements that provided the agency with 
more flexibility to shift patient care to outpatient 
settings, expanded authority to contract with 
private-sector organizations, and the ability to 
market its services to veterans who lacked priority 
status under the traditional eligibility require￾ments. Congress formalized these reforms in 
the Veterans Eligibility Reform Act of 1996 and 
allowed the VHA to make important shifts in its 
product and service mix.
As these initial changes in strategy were being 
implemented, the VHA’s senior leadership team 
reorganized the VHA’s operating units into 22 
networks known as Veterans Integrated Service 
Networks. Within this structure, the networks 
replaced hospitals as the primary planning and 
budgeting units within the VHA. In addition, 
much of the authority for operational decision 
making was effectively transferred from head￾quarters to the networks. The role of the VHA 
headquarters, which as part of the transformation 
had its staff cut by more than one-third, was to set 
overall policy and to provide technical support to 
network managers.
The new structure stimulated experimentation 
and entrepreneurial activity. For example, in an 
effort to save money and streamline care, network 
directors consolidated hospitals in more than 45 
locations where two or more facilities operated 
in close proximity to each other. Network direc￾tors also implemented many innovative organi￾zational arrangements to coordinate patient care 
across operating units within the same network. 
Other arrangements often featured managed care 
principles related to primary care and preventive 
services.
With the transformation under way, Dr. Kizer 
and the leadership team began to implement 
changes intended to maintain the momentum. 
These included commitment to a performance 
application 10.5188 PART 2 The Process of Organization Development
management system and an evaluation process 
that helped the leadership team understand how 
the change could be adapted.
The most important reinforcement for change was 
the creation and implementation of an account￾ability system for network directors. Each direc￾tor was required to sign a performance contract 
that stipulated a set of outcomes to which he or 
she would be held accountable. The contracts 
provided directors with financial incentives in 
the form of a bonus for achieving performance 
goals. The goals were to change each year to 
reflect different agency priorities, such as imple￾menting new programs or functions, achieving 
quantitatively measurable improvements in key 
efficiency and quality indicators for their network 
(e.g., patient satisfaction), or core competencies 
in such areas as interpersonal effectiveness. To 
monitor performance, the senior leadership team 
used existing data and measurement systems and 
also created new ones. Routinely generated and 
disseminated were reports that provided feedback 
on each network’s relative performance on key 
measures for the transformation.
The VHA’s senior leadership team’s ability to stay 
the course was tested when the accountability 
system was challenged by upper-level manag￾ers. The new accountability system entailed the 
development of new performance measures, and 
managers complained about the inadequacy of 
the data, the unreliability of the measures, and 
the potential to “game” the system. They also 
objected to the number and attainability of per￾formance goals.
Many of the complaints were valid and the lead￾ership team took the opportunity to improve the 
databases and measures. However, the leadership 
team also believed the value of the new account￾ability system exceeded its short-term, techni￾cal limitations. The new accountability system’s 
emphasis on performance data had a symbolic 
significance. In fact, managers at lower levels of 
the agency began measuring the performance 
of their own units or departments in ways that 
supported the transformation agenda. These new 
performance systems often came to be known 
by such clinically oriented nicknames as “pulse 
points” and “vital signs.” The result was a sub￾stantial shift in focus among VHA managers—a 
shift away from inputs, such as how large is my 
budget and how many staff do I have, to that of 
outputs as defined by the goals in network direc￾tors’ performance contracts. Moreover, the focus 
of the senior leadership team was reportedly not 
on whether network directors precisely met each 
and every goal stipulated in their contracts but 
rather on whether they met the spirit of their 
contracts in the sense that performance was mov￾ing in a direction that promoted the transforma￾tion agenda.
In addition to the new accountability system, an 
evaluation process pointed out two important 
areas for the leadership to focus on in sustaining 
the transformation’s momentum. First, the evalu￾ation pointed to the need for an improved com￾munications process. To inform employees about 
the transformation, the senior leadership team 
distributed written notices and videotapes, held 
town meetings, and conducted video-conferences. 
Employee surveys and focus group interviews 
suggested that frontline employees, including 
physicians in nonsupervisory positions, had sub￾stantially less understanding of the purpose and 
nature of the transformation than did those to 
whom they reported. As a result, the leadership 
team revised communication channels and the 
data and information that was communicated to 
VHA members.
Second, the evaluation pointed out that training 
and education programs had been forgotten and 
represented an important opportunity to institu￾tionalize the structural changes. That is, although 
the new structure helped achieve credibility for 
the transformation and helped stimulate innova￾tions, it also placed managers in situations they 
were ill-prepared to handle. Many managers 
struggled in their efforts to adapt to a structure 
that now called for them to make innovative and 
strategic decisions in a turbulent environment. 
Such decision making was not the common expe￾rience of most VHA managers, who had spent 
much of their careers carrying out directives from 
agency headquarters. As a result, planned training 
and education programs were initiated to provide 
managers with the skills to conduct sophisticated 
analyses for strategic and marketing plans, capital 
investment decisions, and contract negotiations 
with private-sector organizations.Evaluating and Institutionalizing 
Organization Development Interventions
This chapter focuses on the final stage of the 
organization development cycle—evaluation 
and institutionalization. Evaluation is con￾cerned with providing feedback to practitio￾ners and organization members about the 
progress and impact of interventions. Such 
information may suggest the need for further 
diagnosis and modification of the change 
program, or it may show that the intervention 
is successful. Institutionalization is a process 
for maintaining a particular change for an 
appropriate period of time. It ensures that the 
results of successful change programs persist 
over time.
Evaluation processes consider both the imple￾mentation success of the intended intervention 
and the long-term results it produces. Two key 
as pects of effective evaluation are measure￾ment and research design. The persistence of 
interven tion effects is examined in a framework 
showing the organiza tion characteristics, inter￾vention dimensions, and processes contributing 
to institutionalization of OD interventions in 
organizations.
EVALUATING ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT 
INTERVENTIONS
Assessing OD interventions involves judgments about whether an intervention 
has been implemented as intended and, if so, whether it is having desired results. 
Managers investing resources in OD efforts increasingly are being held accountable 
for results—being asked to justify the expenditures in terms of hard, bottom-line out￾comes. More and more, managers are asking for rigorous assessment of OD interven￾tions and are using the results to make important resource allocation decisions about 
OD, such as whether to continue to support the change program, to modify or alter it, 
or to terminate it and try something else.
Traditionally, OD evaluation has been discussed as something that occurs after the 
intervention. Chapters 12 through 23, for example, present evaluative research about 
the interventions after discussions of the respective change programs. That view can be 
misleading, however. Decisions about the measurement of relevant variables and the 
design of the evaluation process should be made early in the OD cycle so that evalua￾tion choices can be integrated with intervention decisions.
There are two distinct types of OD evaluation: one intended to guide the imple￾mentation of interventions and another to assess their overall impact. The key issues 
in evaluation are measurement and research design.
Implementation and Evaluation Feedback
Most discussions and applications of OD evaluation imply that evaluation is some￾thing done after intervention. It is typically argued that once the intervention is 
implemented, it should be evaluated to discover whether it is producing the intended 
11190 PART 2 The Process of Organization Development
effects. For example, it might be expected that a job enrichment program would lead 
to higher employee satisfaction and performance. After implementing job enrichment, 
evaluation would involve assessing whether these positive results indeed did occur. 
This after-implementation view of evaluation is only partially correct. It assumes that 
interventions have been implemented as intended and that the key purpose of evalua￾tion is to assess their effects. However, in many, if not most, organization development 
programs, implementing interventions cannot be taken for granted.1
 Most OD inter￾ventions require significant changes in people’s behaviors and ways of thinking about 
organizations, but they typically offer only broad prescriptions for how such changes 
are to occur. For example, job enrichment (see Chapter 16) calls for adding discretion, 
variety, and meaningful feedback to people’s jobs. Implementing such changes requires 
considerable learning and experimentation as employees and managers discover how to 
translate these general prescriptions into specific behaviors and procedures. This learn￾ing process involves much trial and error and needs to be guided by information about 
whether behaviors and procedures are being changed as intended.2
 Consequently, we 
should expand our view of evaluation to include both during- implementation assessments 
about if and how well changes are actually being implemented and after- implementation
evaluation of whether they are producing expected results.
Both kinds of evaluation provide organization members with feedback about inter￾ventions. Evaluation aimed at guiding implementation may be called implementation 
feedback, and assessment intended to discover intervention outcomes may be called 
evaluation feedback. Figure 11.1 shows how the two kinds of feedback fit with the 
diagnostic and intervention stages of OD. The application of OD to a particular organ￾ization starts with a thorough diagnosis of the situation (Chapters 5 through 8), which 
helps identify particular organizational problems, areas for improvement, or strengths 
to leverage as well as the likely drivers underlying them. Next, from an array of pos￾sible interventions (Chapters 12 through 23), one or some set is chosen as a means of 
improving the organization. The choice is based on knowledge linking interventions to 
diagnosis (Chapter 9) and change management (Chapter 10).

In most cases, the chosen intervention provides only general guidelines for 
organizational change, leaving managers and employees with the task of translating 
those guidelines into specific behaviors and procedures. Implementation feedback 
informs this process by supplying data about the different features of the intervention 
itself, perceptions of the people involved, and data about the immediate effects of the 
intervention. These data, collected repeatedly and at short intervals, provide a series of 
snapshots about how the intervention is progressing. Organization members can use 
this information, first, to gain a clearer understanding of the intervention (the kinds of 
behaviors and procedures required to implement it) and, second, to plan for the next 
implementation steps. This feedback cycle might proceed for several rounds, with each 
round providing members with knowledge about the intervention and ideas for the 
next stage of implementation.
Once implementation feedback informs organization members that the intervention 
is sufficiently in place and accepted, evaluation feedback begins. In contrast to imple￾mentation feedback, it is concerned with the overall impact of the intervention and with 
whether resources should continue to be allocated to it or to other possible interventions. 
Evaluation feedback takes longer to gather and interpret than does implementation feed￾back. It typically includes a broad array of outcome measures, such as performance, job 
satisfaction, productivity, and turnover. Negative results on these measures tell members 
either that the initial diagnosis was seriously flawed or that the wrong intervention was 
chosen. Such feedback might prompt additional diagnosis and a search for a more effec￾tive intervention. Positive results, on the other hand, tell members that the intervention 
produced expected outcomes and might prompt a search for ways to institutionalize the 
changes, making them a permanent part of the organization’s normal functioning.
An example of a job enrichment intervention helps to clarify the OD stages and 
feedback linkages shown in Figure 11.1. Suppose the initial diagnosis reveals that 
employee performance and satisfaction are low and that jobs being overly structured 
and routinized are an underlying cause of this problem. An inspection of alternative 
interventions to improve productivity and satisfaction suggests that job enrichment 
might be applicable for this situation. Existing job enrichment theory proposes that 
increasing employee discretion, task variety, and feedback can lead to improvements 
in work quality and attitudes and that this job design and outcome linkage is espe￾cially strong for employees who have growth needs—needs for challenge, autonomy, 
and development. Initial diagnosis suggests that most of the employees have high 
growth needs and that the existing job designs prevent the fulfillment of these needs. 
Therefore, job enrichment seems particularly suited to this situation.
Managers and employees now start to translate the general prescriptions offered 
by job enrichment theory into specific behaviors and procedures. At this stage, the 
intervention is relatively broad and must be tailored to fit the specific situation. To 
implement the intervention, employees might decide on the following organizational 
changes: job discretion can be increased through more participatory styles of supervi￾sion; task variety can be enhanced by allowing employees to inspect their job outputs; 
and feedback can be made more meaningful by providing employees with quicker and 
more specific information about their performances.
After three months of trying to implement these changes, the members use imple￾mentation feedback to see how the intervention is progressing. Questionnaires and 
interviews (similar to those used in diagnosis) are administered to measure the different 
features of job enrichment (discretion, variety, and feedback) and to assess employees’ 
reactions to and understanding of the changes. Company records are analyzed to show 
the short-term effects on productivity of the intervention. The data reveal that pro￾ductivity and satisfaction have changed very little since the initial diagnosis. Employee 
perceptions of job discretion and feedback also have shown negligible change and they 
are confused about the expectations of managers, but perceptions of task variety have 192 PART 2 The Process of Organization Development
shown significant improvement. In-depth discussion and analysis of this first round of 
implementation feedback help supervisors gain a better feel for the kinds of behaviors 
needed to move toward a participatory leadership style. This greater clarification of one 
feature of the intervention leads to a decision to involve the supervisors in leadership 
training to develop the skills and knowledge needed to lead participatively. A deci￾sion also is made to make job feedback more meaningful by translating such data into 
simple bar graphs, rather than continuing to provide voluminous statistical reports.
After these modifications have been in effect for about three months, members gather 
a second round of implementation feedback to see how the intervention is progressing. 
The data now show that productivity and satisfaction have moved moderately higher 
than in the first round of feedback and that employee perceptions of task variety and 
feedback are both high. Employee perceptions of discretion, however, remain relatively 
low. Members conclude that the variety and feedback dimensions of job enrichment 
are sufficiently implemented but that the discretion component needs improvement. 
They decide to put more effort into supervisory training and to ask OD practitioners to 
provide online counseling and coaching to supervisors about their leadership styles.
After four more months, a third round of implementation feedback is sought. The 
data now show that satisfaction and performance are significantly higher than in the 
first round of feedback and moderately higher than in the second round. The data 
also show that discretion, variety, and feedback are all high, suggesting that the job 
enrichment intervention has been successfully implemented. Now evaluation feed￾back is used to assess the overall effectiveness of the program.
The evaluation feedback includes all the data from the satisfaction and performance 
measures used in the implementation feedback. Because both the immediate and broader 
effects of the intervention are being evaluated, additional outcomes are examined, such 
as employee absenteeism, maintenance costs, and reactions of other organizational units 
not included in job enrichment. The full array of evaluation data might suggest that after 
one year from the start of implementation, the job enrichment program is having the 
expected effects and thus should be continued and made more permanent.
Measurement
Providing useful implementation and evaluation feedback involves two activities: 
selecting the appropriate variables and designing good measures.
Selecting Appropriate Variables Ideally, the variables measured in OD evaluation 
should derive from the theory or conceptual model underlying the intervention. The 
model should incorporate the key features of the intervention as well as its expected 
results. The general diagnostic models described in Chapters 5 and 6 meet this cri￾terion, as do the more specific models introduced in Chapters 12 through 23. For 
example, the job-level diagnostic model described in Chapter 6 proposes several major 
features of work: task variety, feedback, and autonomy. The theory argues that high 
levels of these elements can be expected to result in high levels of work quality and 
satisfaction. In addition, as we shall see in Chapter 16, the strength of this relationship 
varies with the degree of employee growth need: the higher the need, the more that 
job enrichment produces positive results.
The job-level diagnostic model suggests a number of measurement variables for imple￾mentation and evaluation feedback. Whether the intervention is being implemented 
could be assessed by determining how many job descriptions have been rewritten to 
include more responsibility or how many organization members have received cross 
training in other job skills. Evaluation of the immediate and long-term impact of job 
enrichment would include measures of employee performance and satisfaction over 
time. Again, these measures would likely be included in the initial diagnosis, when the 
company’s problems or areas for improvement are discovered.CHAPTER 11 Evaluating and Institutionalizing OD Interventions 193
Measuring both intervention and outcome variables is necessary for implementation 
and evaluation feedback. Unfortunately, there has been a tendency in OD to measure 
only outcome variables while neglecting intervention variables altogether.3
 It generally 
is assumed that the intervention has been implemented, and attention, therefore, is 
directed to its impact on such organizational outcomes as performance, absenteeism, 
and satisfaction. As argued earlier, implementing OD interventions generally takes con￾siderable time and learning. It must be empirically determined that the intervention has 
been implemented; it cannot simply be assumed. Implementation feedback serves this 
purpose, guiding the implementation process and helping to interpret outcome data. 
Outcome measures are ambiguous without knowledge of how well the intervention 
has been implemented. For example, a negligible change in measures of performance 
and satisfaction could mean that the wrong intervention has been chosen, that the 
correct intervention has not been implemented effectively, or that the wrong variables 
have been measured. Measurement of the intervention variables helps determine the 
correct interpretation of outcome measures.
As suggested above, the selection of intervention variables to be measured should 
derive from the conceptual framework underlying the OD intervention. OD research 
and theory increasingly have come to identify specific organizational changes needed to 
implement particular interventions (much of that information is discussed in Chapters 12 
through 23). These variables should guide not only implementation of the interven￾tion but also choices about what change variables to measure for evaluative purposes. 
Additional sources of knowledge about intervention variables can be found in the 
numerous references at the end of each of the chapters on intervention in this book and 
in several of the books in the Wiley Series on Organizational Assessment and Change.4
The choice of what outcome variables to measure also should be dictated by inter￾vention theory, which specifies the kinds of results that can be expected from particular 
change programs. Again, the material in this book and elsewhere identifies numerous 
outcome measures, such as job satisfaction, intrinsic motivation, organizational com￾mitment, absenteeism, turnover, and productivity.
Historically, OD assessment has focused on attitudinal outcomes, such as job satis￾faction, while neglecting hard measures, such as performance. Increasingly, however, 
managers and researchers are calling for development of behavioral measures of OD 
outcomes. Managers are interested primarily in applying OD to change work-related 
behaviors that involve joining, remaining, and producing at work, and are assessing 
OD more frequently in terms of such bottom-line results. Macy and Mirvis have done 
extensive research to develop a standardized set of behavioral outcomes for assessing 
and comparing intervention results.5 Table 11.1 lists eleven outcomes, including their 
behavioral definitions and recording categories. The outcomes are in two broad cat￾egories: participation-membership, including absenteeism, tardiness, turnover, internal 
employment stability, and strikes and work stoppages; and performance on the job, 
including productivity, quality, grievances, accidents, unscheduled machine downtime 
and repair, material and supply overuse, and inventory shrinkage. All of the outcomes 
should be important to most managers, and they represent generic descriptions that 
can be adapted to both industrial and service organizations.
Designing Good Measures Each of the measurement methods described in Chapter 7 
has advantages and disadvantages. Many of these characteristics are linked to the extent 
to which a measurement is operationally defined, reliable, and valid. These assessment 
characteristics are discussed below.
Operational definition. A good measure is operationally defined; that is, it specifies the 
empirical data needed, how they will be collected and, most important, how they will 
be converted from data to information. For example, Macy and Mirvis developed oper￾ational definitions for the behavioral outcomes listed in Table 11.1 (see Table 11.2).6194 PART 2 The Process of Organization Development

Text not available due to copyright restrictions196 PART 2 The Process of Organization Development
They consist of specific computational rules that can be used to construct measures 
for each of the behaviors. Most of the behaviors are reported as rates adjusted for the 
number of employees in the organization and for the possible incidents of behavior. 
These adjustments make it possible to compare the measures across different situations 
and time periods. These operational definitions should have wide applicability across 
both industrial and service organizations, although some modifications, deletions, and 
additions may be necessary for a particular application.
Operational definitions are extremely important in measurement because they pro￾vide precise guidelines about what characteristics of the situation are to be observed and 
how they are to be used. They tell OD practitioners and the client system exactly how 
diagnostic, intervention, and outcome variables will be measured.
Reliability. Reliability concerns the extent to which a measure represents the “true” 
value of a variable—that is, how accurately the operational definition translates data 
into information. For example, there is little doubt about the accuracy of the number of 
cars leaving an assembly line as a measure of plant productivity. Although it is possible 
to miscount, there can be a high degree of confidence in the measurement. On the other 
hand, when people are asked to rate their level of job satisfaction on a scale of 1 to 5, 
there is considerable room for variation in their response. They may just have had an 
argument with their supervisor, suffered an accident on the job, been rewarded for high 
levels of productivity, or been given new responsibilities. Each of these events can sway 
the response to the question on any given day. The individuals’ “true” satisfaction score 
is difficult to discern from this one question and the measure lacks reliability.7
OD practitioners can improve the reliability of their measures in four ways. First, rigor￾ously and operationally define the chosen variables. Clearly specified operational defini￾tions contribute to reliability by explicitly describing how collected data will be converted 
into information about a variable. An explicit description helps to allay the client’s con￾cerns about how the information was collected and coded.
Second, use multiple methods to measure a particular variable. As discussed in 
Chapter 7, the use of questionnaires, interviews, observations, and unobtrusive mea￾sures can improve reliability and result in a more comprehensive understanding of the 
organization. Because each method contains inherent biases, several different methods 
can be used to triangulate on dimensions of organizational issues. If the independent 
measures converge or show consistent results, the dimensions or problems likely have 
been diagnosed accurately.8
Third, use multiple items to measure the same variable on a questionnaire. For 
example, in Hackman and Oldham’s Job Diagnostic Survey for measuring job charac￾teristics (Chapter 16), the intervention variable “autonomy” is operationally defined 
by the average of respondents’ answers to the following three questions (measured on 
a 7-point scale):9
The job permits me to decide on my own how to go about doing the work.
The job denies me any chance to use my personal initiative or judgment in carry￾ing out the work. [reverse scored]
The job gives me considerable opportunity for independence and freedom in how 
I do the work.
By asking more than one question about “autonomy,” the survey increases the accu￾racy of its measurement of this variable. Statistical analyses (called psychometric tests) are 
readily available for assessing the reliability of perceptual measures, and OD practitio￾ners should apply these methods or seek assistance from those who can apply them.10
Similarly, there are methods for analyzing the content of interview and observational 
data, and OD evaluators can use these methods to categorize such information so that 
it can be understood and replicated.11

3.CHAPTER 11 Evaluating and Institutionalizing OD Interventions 197
Fourth, use standardized instruments. A growing number of standardized ques￾tionnaires are available for measuring OD intervention and outcome variables. 
For example, the Center for Effective Organizations at the University of Southern 
California (http://ceo-marshall.usc.edu) and the Institute for Social Research at the 
University of Michigan (http://www.isr.umich.edu) have developed comprehen￾sive survey instruments to measure the features of many of the OD interventions 
described in this book, as well as their attitudinal outcomes.12 Considerable research 
and testing have gone into establishing measures that are reliable and valid. These 
survey instruments can be used for initial diagnosis, for guiding implementation of 
interventions, and for evaluating immediate and long-term outcomes.
Validity. Validity concerns the extent to which a measure actually reflects the vari￾able it is intended to reflect. For example, the number of cars leaving an assembly line 
might be a reliable measure of plant productivity, but it may not be a valid measure. 
The number of cars is only one aspect of productivity; they may have been produced 
at an unacceptably high cost. Because the number of cars does not account for cost, it 
is not a completely valid measure of plant productivity.
OD practitioners can increase the validity of their measures in several ways. First, 
ask colleagues and clients if a proposed measure actually represents a particular vari￾able. This is called face validity or content validity. If experts and clients agree that the 
measure reflects the variable of interest, then there is increased confidence in the 
measure’s validity. Second, use multiple measures of the same variable, as described in 
the section about reliability, to make preliminary assessments of the measure’s criterion
or convergent validity. That is, if several different measures of the same variable corre￾late highly with each other, especially if one or more of the other measures have been 
validated in prior research, then there is increased confidence in the measure’s validity. 
A special case of criterion validity, called discriminant validity, exists when the proposed 
measure does not correlate with measures that it is not supposed to correlate with. For 
example, there is no good reason for daily measures of assembly line productivity to 
correlate with daily air temperature. The lack of a correlation would be one indicator 
that the number of cars is measuring productivity and not some other variable. Finally, 
predictive validity is demonstrated when the variable of interest accurately forecasts 
another variable over time. For example, a measure of team cohesion can be said to be 
valid if it accurately predicts improvements in team performance in the future.
It is difficult, however, to establish the validity of a measure until it has been used. To 
address this concern, OD practitioners should make heavy use of content validity processes 
and use measures that already have been validated. For example, presenting proposed 
measures to colleagues and clients for evaluation prior to measurement has several positive 
effects: It builds ownership and commitment to the data collection process and improves 
the likelihood that the client system will find the data meaningful. Using measures that 
have been validated through prior research improves confidence in the results and provides 
a standard that can be used to validate any new measures used in collecting the data.
Research Design
In addition to measurement, OD practitioners must make choices about how to design 
the evaluation to achieve valid results. The key issue is how to design the assessment to 
show whether the intervention did in fact produce the observed results. This is called 
internal validity. The secondary question of whether the intervention would work simi￾larly in other situations is referred to as external validity. External validity is irrelevant 
without first establishing an intervention’s primary effectiveness, so internal validity is 
the essential minimum requirement for assessing OD interventions. Unless managers 
can have confidence that the outcomes are the result of the intervention, they have no 
rational basis for making decisions about accountability and resource allocation.198 PART 2 The Process of Organization Development
Assessing the internal validity of an intervention is, in effect, testing a hypothesis—
namely, that specific organizational changes lead to certain outcomes. Moreover, testing 
the validity of an intervention hypothesis means that alternative hypotheses or explana￾tions of the results must be rejected. That is, to claim that an intervention is successful, it 
is necessary to demonstrate that other explanations—in the form of rival hypotheses—do 
not account for the observed results. For example, if a job enrichment program appears 
to increase employee performance, such other possible explanations as new technology, 
improved raw materials, or new employees must be eliminated.
Accounting for rival explanations is not a precise, controlled, experimental process 
such as might be found in a research laboratory.13 OD interventions often have a num￾ber of features that make it difficult to determine whether they produced the observed 
results. They are complex and often involve several interrelated changes that obscure 
whether individual features or combinations of features are accounting for the results. 
Many OD interventions are long-term projects and take considerable time to produce 
desired outcomes. The longer the time period of the change program, the greater 
are the chances that other factors, such as technology improvements, will emerge to 
affect the results. Finally, OD interventions usually are applied to existing work units 
rather than to randomized groups of organization members. Ruling out alternative 
explanations associated with randomly selected intervention and comparison groups 
is, therefore, difficult.
Given the problems inherent in assessing OD interventions, practitioners have 
turned to quasi-experimental research designs.
14 These designs are not as rigorous and 
controlled as are randomized experimental designs, but they allow evaluators to rule 
out many rival explanations for OD results other than the intervention itself. Although 
several quasi-experimental designs are available, those with the following three fea￾tures are particularly powerful for assessing changes:
Longitudinal measurement. This involves measuring results repeatedly over 
relatively long time periods. Ideally, the data collection should start before the 
change program is implemented and continue for a period considered reasonable 
for producing expected results.
Comparison unit. It is always desirable to compare results in the intervention 
situation with those in another situation where no such change has taken place. 
Although it is never possible to get a matching group identical to the intervention 
group, most organizations include a number of similar work units that can be used 
for comparison purposes.
Statistical analysis. Whenever possible, statistical methods should be used to 
rule out the possibility that the results are caused by random error or chance. 
Various statistical techniques are applicable to quasi-experimental designs, and 
OD practitioners should apply these methods or seek help from those who can 
apply them.
Table 11.3 provides an example of a quasi-experimental design having these three 
features. The intervention is intended to reduce employee absenteeism. Measures of 
absenteeism are taken from company monthly records for both the intervention and 
comparison groups. The two groups are similar yet geographically separate subsid￾iaries of a multiplant company. Table 11.3 shows each plant’s monthly absenteeism 
rate for four consecutive months both before and after the start of the intervention. 
The plant receiving the intervention shows a marked decrease in absenteeism in the 
months following the intervention, whereas the control plant shows comparable 
levels of absenteeism in both time periods. Statistical analyses of these data suggest 
that the abrupt downward shift in absenteeism following the intervention was not 
attributable to chance variation. This research design and the data provide relatively 
strong evidence that the intervention was successful.

3.CHAPTER 11 Evaluating and Institutionalizing OD Interventions 199
Quasi-experimental research designs using longitudinal data, comparison groups, 
and statistical analysis permit reasonable assessments of intervention effectiveness. 
Repeated measures often can be collected from company records without directly 
involving members of the experimental and comparison groups. These unobtrusive 
measures are especially useful in OD assessment because they do not interact with the 
intervention and affect the results. More obtrusive measures, such as questionnaires 
and interviews, are reactive and can sensitize people to the intervention. When this 
happens, it is difficult to know whether the observed findings are the result of the 
intervention, the measuring methods, or some combination of both.
Multiple measures of intervention and outcome variables should be applied to mini￾mize measurement and intervention interactions. For example, obtrusive measures 
such as questionnaires could be used sparingly, perhaps once before and once after 
the intervention. Unobtrusive measures, such as the behavioral outcomes shown in 
Tables 11.1 and 11.2, could be used repeatedly, thus providing a more extensive time 
series than the questionnaires. When used together, the two kinds of measures should 
produce accurate and non-reactive evaluations of the intervention.
The use of multiple measures also is important in assessing perceptual changes result￾ing from interventions. Considerable research has identified three types of change—
alpha, beta, and gamma—that occur when using self-report, perceptual measures.15
Alpha change refers to movement along a measure that reflects stable dimensions 
of reality. For example, comparative measures of perceived employee discretion 
might show an increase after a job enrichment program. If this increase represents 
alpha change, it can be assumed that the job enrichment program actually increased 
employee perceptions of discretion.
Beta change involves the recalibration of the intervals along some constant measure 
of reality. For example, before-and-after measures of perceived employee discretion 
can decrease after a job enrichment program. If beta change is involved, it can explain 
this apparent failure of the intervention to increase discretion. The first measure of dis￾cretion may accurately reflect the individual’s belief about the ability to move around 
and talk to fellow workers in the immediate work area. During implementation of 
the job enrichment intervention, however, the employee may learn that the ability to 
move around is not limited to the immediate work area. At a second measurement of 
discretion, the employee, using this new and recalibrated understanding, may rate the 
current level of discretion as lower than before.
Gamma change involves fundamentally redefining the measure as a result of an 
OD intervention. In essence, the framework within which a phenomenon is viewed 
changes. For example, the presence of gamma change would make it difficult to com￾pare measures of employee discretion taken before and after a job enrichment program. 
The measure taken after the intervention might use the same words, but they represent 
an entirely different concept. As described above, the term “discretion” may originally 
refer to the ability to move about the department and interact with other workers. After 
the intervention, discretion might be defined in terms of the ability to make decisions 
about work rules, work schedules, and productivity levels. In sum, the job enrichment 
intervention changed the way discretion is perceived and how it is evaluated.

These three types of change apply to perceptual measures. When changes other 
than alpha ones occur, interpreting measurement changes becomes far more difficult. 
Potent OD interventions may produce both beta and gamma changes, and this severely 
complicates interpretations of findings reporting change or no change. Further, the 
distinctions among the three different types of change suggest that the heavy reliance 
on questionnaires, so often cited in the literature, should be balanced by using other 
measures, such as interviews and unobtrusive records. Analytical methods have been 
developed to assess the three kinds of change, and OD practitioners should gain famil￾iarity with these recent techniques.16
Application 11.1 describes the implementation and evaluation feedback that were 
developed for the Alegent Health project. It is a sophisticated example of how data can 
be used to guide current implementation and evaluate the effectiveness of an interven￾tion. But the evaluation is not perfect. What are the strengths and weaknesses of the 
assessment? How could it have been improved? How much confidence do you have in 
the lessons learned from this organization?
INSTITUTIONALIZING ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGES
Once it is determined that changes have been implemented and are effective, attention 
is directed at institutionalizing the changes—maintaining them as a normal part of the 
organization’s functioning for an appropriate period of time.17 In complex and uncer￾tain environments, some changes are only part of a long journey of organization adap￾tation. Innovating new products is not a one-time change but a continuous process 
that must be implemented over and over again. Other changes, such as the process for 
appraising performance, need to persist. For example, there is little to be gained from 
making front-line supervisors learn a new performance rating system every year.
Lewin described change as occurring in three stages: unfreezing, moving, and 
refreezing. Institutionalizing an OD intervention concerns refreezing. It involves the 
long-term persistence of organizational changes: To the extent that changes persist, 
they can be said to be institutionalized. Such changes are not dependent on any one 
person but exist as a part of the culture of an organization. This means that numer￾ous others share norms about the appropriateness of the changes.
How planned changes become institutionalized has not received much attention in 
the OD literature. Rapidly changing environments have led to admonitions from con￾sultants and practitioners to “change constantly,” to “change before you have to,” and 
“if it’s not broke, fix it anyway.” Such a context has challenged the utility of the institu￾tionalization concept. Why endeavor to make any change permanent given that it may 
require changing again soon? However, the admonitions also have resulted in institu￾tionalization concepts being applied in new ways. Change itself has become the focus 
of institutionalization. Built to change, organization learning, and self-design interven￾tions described in Chapter 21 all are aimed at enhancing the organization’s change 
capability.18 In this vein, processes of institutionalization take on increased utility. This 
section presents a framework for identifying factors and processes that contribute to the 
institutionalization of OD interventions, including the process of change itself.
Institutionalization Framework
Figure 11.2 presents a framework that identifies organization and intervention 
characteristics and institutionalization processes affecting the degree to which change 
programs are institutionalized.19 The model shows that two key antecedents—organization 
and intervention characteristics—affect different institutionalization processes operating 
in organizations. These processes, in turn, affect various indicators of institutionaliza￾tion. The model also shows that organization characteristics can influence intervention Evaluating Change at Alegent Health
In July and August of 2005, Alegent Health (AH) 
conducted six large-group interventions or “decision 
accelerators” (DAs) to generate innovative strategies 
for the six clinical service areas. Researchers at 
USC’s Center for Effective Organizations contracted 
with AH to assess the impact of the interventions 
and help the organization learn how to leverage 
further change. The applications in Chapter 4 
described how the researchers entered and con￾tracted with the organization, and Application 7.1 
described the data collection and analysis process. 
In this application, we describe the implemen￾tation and evaluation feedback the researchers 
generated.
In terms of implementation feedback, the collected 
data described perceptions of change progress 
and employee involvement. For example, execu￾tive interviews and surveys from people who 
participated in “review DAs” to reflect on imple￾mentation progress and plan future changes 
supported a positive assessment of overall progress. 
People generally agreed that the implementation 
of the clinical strategies was going well. They were 
positive about the social capital that had been 
created by the DAs, especially between manag￾ers and physicians, as well as the evidence of 
culture change. Nearly everyone in the organiza￾tion believed that the clinical strategies were the 
“right thing to do.” In addition to these positive 
findings, there was some concern about feeling 
involved in the change.
That is, the DAs were a great energizer for the orga￾nization, generated comprehensive strategies, and 
catalyzed important changes. However, the data 
also contained some reservations about the organi￾zation’s ability to leverage the changes. As described 
in Application 7.1, the implementation approaches 
were mostly informal; the organization was afraid 
that too many dedicated change processes and sys￾tems might slow down the change process. The data 
revealed a more complex set of issues.
First, executives and some physicians understood 
the roles, decisions, and processes related to 
implementation more than operational manag￾ers and other physicians. The six clinical ser￾vices cases studied described an intense period 
of business planning following the DAs. Senior 
management, all of whom had participated in 
the original six DAs, drove this process and were 
quite clear about the resulting priorities and ini￾tiatives. This clarity, however, was not widely 
shared by the hospital COOs, many physicians, 
and many operational managers. This resulted in a 
perception of a strong connection between strategy 
formulation and implementation at the top of the 
organization, but a weak perception in the middle 
of the organization. Managers and nurses felt 
overwhelmed—they heard about change with little 
context, and believed that the speed of change was 
slower rather than faster because “everything was 
important.” Similarly, many physicians who were 
energized by the DAs wanted to know “where’s the 
change?” While exceptions to this observation did 
exist, there was a general sense that senior man￾agers were more involved and saw more change 
than others.
Second, the absence of formal change management 
processes made important resource allocation deci￾sions, trade-offs on technology, and coordination of 
quality processes across the system more difficult. 
There was no visible mechanism, for example, to 
decide how quality programs should be rolled out 
or where to pilot electronic medical record systems. 
The lack of formal change management systems 
(action plans, governance mechanisms, learning 
practices) following the DAs was related to some 
feelings among all stakeholder groups that change 
was slow in coming and overwhelming when it did 
come. Most people correctly viewed the strategies 
created by the DAs as high-level plans providing 
general direction. However, the process for devel￾oping action plans and implementation activities 
was not visible to many people. Ad hoc change 
systems emerged based on the nature of the strat￾egy implementation activities and these helped to 
focus attention and resources. Interestingly, these 
systems all started to emerge about one year after 
the original DAs.
Based on these implementation data, and the data 
presented in Application 7.1 about how the DA 
needed to evolve, the researchers recommended 
(1) creating different versions of the DA to address 
different issues and (2) formalizing some change 
processes so that the resourcing, execution, and 
communication of change were more coordinated. 
However, their overall recommendation was to 
application 11.1202 PART 2 The Process of Organization Development
continue using the DA for strategy formulation and 
visioning, as well as tactical and implementation￾oriented issues.
In terms of evaluation feedback, the analysis of 
the activities described in the DA reports provided 
some important conclusions. For example, the 
composition of the DAs, or the mix of AH manag￾ers and staff, physicians, community members, 
and other stakeholders, affected the processes 
and outcomes. First, in DAs where there was a 
higher proportion of physicians, there was a nar￾rower range of stakeholder participation and an 
increased likelihood that the group would deviate 
from the agenda. In addition, there was a weak 
relationship between higher percentages of com￾munity participants and all DA processes. That is, 
when the DA had more community participants, 
there was broader participation in the discussions, 
the debates were more intense, and the DA stayed 
on track.
Second, the composition of the DA had differen￾tial impacts on the outcomes of meeting. When 
the DA had a high percentage of physicians, the 
resulting vision was less comprehensive. On the 
other hand, when the DA had a high concentration 
of community participants, the vision was more 
comprehensive. These results were reflected in the 
survey data as well. The percentage of community 
participants was positively related to perceptions 
that the strategy was more innovative but less 
aggressive and business oriented. The concentra￾tion of physicians in the DA tended to have oppo￾site relationships with the strategy dimensions.
When these data were fed back to the organiza￾tion, the researchers specifically pointed out that 
these findings did not suggest that it was wrong to 
involve physicians or that a higher percentage of 
community members was better. To the contrary, 
the fundamental assumption of DA interventions 
was that a broader mix of stakeholders contrib￾utes to a better solution. This data did suggest that 
not all stakeholder groups are created equal. Too 
many of any type of stakeholder group may lead 
to lopsided discussions and sway the agenda. In 
several of the DAs for example, almost half of the 
participants were physicians, making it likely that 
this constituency would disproportionately impact 
the flow of the meeting.
The table below summarizes many of the findings 
from the Alegent project.
EVALUATION QUESTION DATA
 Does Alegent’s strategy, purpose, and 
organization support change?
• – Yes—Many powerful internal and external 
forces are pushing for and supporting change
 How effective were the original six DAs in 
achieving intended outcomes?
• – Very effective—The DAs generated a lot 
of energy for change, healed physician 
relationships, and utilized good thinking
• What DA characteristics made a difference? – The DA’s composition was an important 
influence on its processes and outcomes
 How do executives and managers characterize 
the service line strategies?

characteristics. For example, organizations having powerful unions may have trouble 
gaining internal support for OD interventions.
Organization Characteristics
Figure 11.2 shows that the following three key dimensions of an organization can 
affect intervention characteristics and institutionalization processes:
Congruence. This is the degree to which an intervention is perceived as being 
in harmony with the organization’s managerial philosophy, strategy, and 
1.
Overall, the researchers concluded that:
1. There was a demonstrable and palpable change 
in a variety of organization features that if not 
directly tied to the DA were certainly hastened 
by it. A large number of specific strategic, 
operational, and practice-oriented changes con￾nected with each clinical area had been imple￾mented relatively quickly. In addition, there 
was substantial agreement that the culture 
was changing, as evidenced by new language, 
regular and extensive use of DAs, collabora￾tive decision making, openness to innovation, 
confidence in leadership, and openness to joint 
ventures with the physicians. Finally, there 
was broad agreement that the DA process rep￾resented a visible and tangible effort to address 
physician relationships and clearly moved those 
relationships in a positive direction.
2. The organization’s initial use of the DA process 
as a strategic visioning intervention persists in the 
minds of most organization members. Alegent 
Health can productively apply the technology 
and principles to other, more implementation￾oriented issues. On the other hand, DAs cannot 
do everything, and complementary governance 
and implementation processes are necessary.

structure; its current environment; and other changes taking place.20 When an 
intervention is congruent with these dimensions, the probability is improved 
that it will be supported and sustained. Congruence can facilitate persistence 
by making it easier to gain member commitment to the intervention and to dif￾fuse it to wider segments of the organization. The converse also is true: Many 
OD interventions promote employee participation and growth. When applied 
in highly bureaucratic organizations with formalized structures and autocratic 
managerial styles, participative interventions are not perceived as congruent 
with the organization’s managerial philosophy.
Stability of environment and technology. This involves the degree to which 
the organization’s environment and technology are changing. The persistence 
of change is favored when environments are stable. Under these conditions, it 
makes sense to embed the change in an organization’s culture and organization 
design processes. On the other hand, volatile demand for the firm’s products or 
services can lead to reductions in personnel that may change the composition of 
the groups involved in the intervention or bring new members on board at a rate 
faster than they can be socialized effectively.
Unionization. Diffusion of interventions may be more difficult in unionized 
settings, especially if the changes affect union contract issues, such as salary and 
fringe benefits, job design, and employee flexibility. For example, a rigid union 
contract can make it difficult to merge several job classifications into one, as might 
be required to increase task variety in a job enrichment progrom. It is important to 
emphasize, however, that unions can be a powerful force for promoting change, 
particularly when a good relationship exists between union and management
Intervention Characteristics
Figure 11.2 shows that the following five major features of OD interventions can affect 
institutionalization processes:
Goal specificity. This involves the extent to which intervention goals are spe￾cific rather than broad. Specificity of goals helps direct socializing activities (for 
example, training and orienting new members) to particular behaviors required 
to implement the intervention. It also helps operationalize the new behaviors so 
that rewards can be linked clearly to them. For example, an intervention aimed 
only at increasing product quality is likely to be more focused and readily put into 
operation than a change program intended to improve quality, quantity, safety, 
absenteeism, and employee development.
Programmability. This involves the degree to which the changes can be pro￾grammed or the extent to which the different intervention characteristics can be 
specified clearly in advance to enable socialization, commitment, and reward allo￾cation. For example, job enrichment specifies three targets of change: employee 
discretion, task variety, and feedback. The change program can be planned and 
designed to promote those specific features.
Level of change target. This concerns the extent to which the change target is the 
total organization, rather than a department or small work group. Each level of orga￾nization has facilitators and inhibitors of persistence. Departmental and group change 
are susceptible to countervailing forces from others in the organization. These can 
reduce the diffusion of the intervention and lower its ability to impact organization 
effectiveness. However, this does not preclude institutionalizing the change within a 
department that successfully insulates itself from the rest of the organization. Such 
insulation often manifests itself as a subculture within the organization.21
Targeting the intervention toward wider segments of the organization, on the 
other hand, can also help or hinder change persistence. A shared belief about the

3.CHAPTER 11 Evaluating and Institutionalizing OD Interventions 205
intervention’s value can be a powerful incentive to maintain the change, and pro￾moting a consensus across organizational departments exposed to the change can 
facilitate institutionalization. But targeting the larger system also can inhibit institu￾tionalization. The intervention can become mired in political resistance because of 
the “not invented here” syndrome or because powerful constituencies oppose it.
Internal support. This refers to the degree to which there is an internal support 
system to guide the change process. Internal support, typically provided by an 
internal consultant, can gain commitment for the changes and help organization 
members implement them. External consultants also can provide support, espe￾cially on a temporary basis during the early stages of implementation. For example, 
in many interventions aimed at implementing high-involvement organizations 
(see Chapter 15), both external and internal consultants provide change support. 
The external consultant typically brings expertise on organizational design and 
trains members to implement the design. The internal consultant generally helps 
members relate to other organ izational units, resolve conflicts, and legitimize the 
change activities within the organization.
Sponsorship. This concerns the presence of a powerful sponsor who can initi￾ate, allocate, and legitimize resources for the intervention. Sponsors must come 
from levels in the organization high enough to control appropriate resources, and 
they must have the visibility and power to nurture the intervention and see that 
it remains viable. There are many examples of OD interventions that persisted 
for several years and then collapsed abruptly when the sponsor, usually a top 
administrator, left the organization. There also are numerous examples of middle 
managers withdrawing support for interventions because top management did not 
include them in the change program.
Institutionalization Processes
The framework depicted in Figure 11.2 shows the following five institutionalization pro￾cesses that can directly affect the degree to which OD interventions are institutionalized:
Socialization. This concerns the transmission of information about beliefs, prefer￾ences, norms, and values with respect to the intervention. Because implementation 
of OD interventions generally involves considerable learning and experimentation, 
a continual process of socialization is necessary to promote persistence of the change 
program. Organization members must focus attention on the evolving nature of the 
intervention and its ongoing meaning. They must communicate this information 
to other employees, especially new members of the organization. Transmission of 
information about the intervention helps bring new members onboard and allows 
participants to reaffirm the beliefs, norms, and values underlying the intervention.22
For example, employee involvement programs often include initial transmission of 
information about the intervention, as well as retraining of existing participants and 
training of new members. Such processes are intended to promote persistence of 
the program as new behaviors are learned and new members introduced.
Commitment. This binds people to behaviors associated with the intervention. It 
includes initial commitment to the program, as well as recommitment over time. 
Opportunities for commitment should allow people to select the necessary behaviors 
freely, explicitly, and publicly. These conditions favor high commitment and can pro￾mote stability of the new behaviors. Commitment should derive from several organi￾zational levels, including the employees directly involved and the middle and upper 
managers who can support or thwart the intervention. In many early employee 
involvement programs, for example, attention was directed at gaining workers’ 
commitment to such programs. Unfortunately, middle managers were often ignored 
and considerable management resistance to the interventions resulted.

2.206 PART 2 The Process of Organization Development
Reward allocation. This involves linking rewards to the new behaviors required 
by an intervention. Organizational rewards can enhance the persistence of changes 
in at least two ways. First, a combination of intrinsic and extrinsic rewards can 
reinforce new behaviors. Intrinsic rewards are internal and derive from the oppor￾tunities for challenge, development, and accomplishment found in the work. 
When interventions provide these opportunities, motivation to perform should 
persist. This behavior can be further reinforced by providing extrinsic rewards, 
such as money, for increased contributions. Because the value of extrinsic rewards 
tends to diminish over time, it may be necessary to revise the reward system to 
maintain high levels of desired behaviors.
Second, new behaviors will persist to the extent that rewards are perceived 
as equitable by employees. When new behaviors are fairly compensated, people 
are likely to develop preferences for those behaviors. Over time, those prefer￾ences should lead to normative and value consensus about the appropriateness 
of the intervention. For example, many employee involvement programs fail to 
persist because employees feel that their increased contributions to organizational 
improvements are unfairly rewarded. This is especially true for interventions 
relying exclusively on intrinsic rewards. People argue that an intervention that 
provides opportunities for intrinsic rewards also should provide greater pay or 
extrinsic rewards for higher levels of contribution to the organization.
Diffusion. This refers to the process of transferring changes from one system to 
another. Diffusion facilitates institutionalization by providing a wider organizational 
base to support the new behaviors. Many interventions fail to persist because they 
run counter to the values, purpose, or identity of the larger organization. Rather 
than support the intervention, the larger organization rejects the changes and 
often puts pressure on the change target to revert to old behaviors. Diffusion of a 
change to other organizational units reduces this counter-implementation force. It 
tends to lock in behaviors by providing normative consensus from other parts of 
the organization. Moreover, the act of transmitting institutionalized behaviors to 
other systems reinforces commitment to the changes.
Sensing and calibration. This involves detecting deviations from desired interven￾tion behaviors and taking corrective action. Institutionalized behaviors invariably 
encounter destabilizing forces, such as changes in the environment, new technolo￾gies, and pressures from other departments to nullify changes. These factors cause 
some variation in performances, preferences, norms, and values. To detect this varia￾tion and take corrective actions, organizations must have some sensing mechanism. 
Sensing mechanisms, such as implementation feedback, provide information about 
the occurrence of deviations. This knowledge can then initiate corrective actions 
to ensure that behaviors are more in line with the intervention. For example, if a 
high level of job discretion associated with a job enrichment intervention does not 
persist, information about this problem might initiate corrective actions, such as 
renewed attempts to socialize people or to gain commitment to the intervention.
Indicators of Institutionalization
Institutionalization is not an all-or-nothing concept but reflects degrees of persistence 
in a change. Figure 11.2 shows five indicators of the extent of an intervention’s per￾sistence. The extent to which the following factors are present or absent indicates the 
degree of institutionalization:
Knowledge. This involves the extent to which organization members have knowl￾edge of the behaviors associated with an intervention. It is concerned with whether 
members know enough to perform the behaviors and to recognize the consequences

of that performance. For example, job enrichment includes a number of new behav￾iors, such as performing a greater variety of tasks, analyzing information about task 
performance, and making decisions about work methods and plans.
Performance. This is concerned with the degree to which intervention behaviors 
are actually performed. It may be measured by counting the proportion of relevant 
people performing the behaviors. For example, 60% of the employees in a particu￾lar work unit might be performing the job enrichment behaviors described above. 
Another measure of performance is the frequency with which the new behaviors 
are performed. In assessing frequency, it is important to account for different varia￾tions of the same essential behavior, as well as highly institutionalized behaviors 
that need to be performed only infrequently.
Preferences. This involves the degree to which organization members privately 
accept the organizational changes. This contrasts with acceptance based primar￾ily on organizational sanctions or group pressures. Private acceptance usually is 
reflected in people’s positive attitudes toward the changes and can be measured 
by the direction and intensity of those attitudes across the members of the work 
unit receiving the intervention. For example, a questionnaire assessing members’ 
perceptions of a job enrichment program might show that most employees have 
a strong positive attitude toward making decisions, analyzing feedback, and per￾forming a variety of tasks.
Normative consensus. This focuses on the extent to which people agree about 
the appropriateness of the organizational changes. This indicator of institutional￾ization reflects how fully changes have become part of the normative structure of 
the organization. Changes persist to the degree members feel that they should sup￾port them. For example, a job enrichment program would become institutionalized 
to the extent that employees support it and see it as appropriate to organizational 
functioning.
Value consensus. This is concerned with social consensus on values relevant to 
the organizational changes. Values are beliefs about how people ought or ought 
not to behave. They are abstractions from more specific norms. Job enrichment, for 
example, is based on values promoting employee self-control and responsibility. 
Different behaviors associated with job enrichment, such as making decisions and 
performing a variety of tasks, would persist to the extent that employees widely 
share values of self-control and responsibility.
These five indicators can be used to assess the level of change persistence. The more the 
indicators are present in a situation, the higher will be the degree of institutionalization. 
Further, these factors seem to follow a specific development order: knowledge, perfor￾mance, preferences, norms, and values. People must first understand new behaviors or 
changes before they can perform them effectively. Such performance generates rewards 
and punishments, which in time affect people’s preferences. As many individuals come to 
prefer the changes, normative consensus about their appropriateness develops. Finally, if 
there is normative agreement about the changes reflecting a particular set of values, over 
time there should be some consensus on those values among organization members.
Given this developmental view of institutionalization, it is implicit that whenever 
one of the last indicators is present, all the previous ones are automatically included 
as well. For example, if employees normatively agree with the behaviors associated 
with job enrichment, then they also have knowledge about the behaviors, can perform 
them effectively, and prefer them. An OD intervention is fully institutionalized only 
when all five factors are present.

a new set of behaviors through structural change. It describes how culture and reward 
systems can play a strong role in both supporting and constraining change.23

5.Institutionalizing Structural Change
at Hewlett-Packard
In May 2002, the hotly contested acquisition of 
Compaq by Hewlett-Packard (http://www.hp.com) 
was finalized. Unlike the major organization 
changes before it, the acquisition challenged the 
abilities of this perennial “most admired company” 
to execute a complex structural change. The success 
of the integration process described in Application 
10.4 is partly due to a store of institutionalized 
knowledge and capability within the HP organiza￾tion. This application describes a number of large￾scale structural changes at HP. Its repeated ability to 
carry out such change speaks to the institutional￾ized capability to manage change.
Since its founding in 1939, HP has implemented suc￾cessfully no fewer than a dozen major organizational 
changes, including the transition from a high-tech 
entrepreneurial start-up to a professionally man￾aged company; from a small instruments business 
to a leading computer company; from a company 
oriented around complex-instruction-set computing 
technology to reduced-instruction-set computing 
technology; from a technology/engineering-based 
company to a market/brand-driven company; and, 
since the appointment of Carly Fiorina as CEO, from 
a “pure products” company to a services company.
HP’s electronics and computer business was 
characterized by highly volatile technological and 
market change. It had to quickly adopt, innovate, 
and implement a variety of technological and organi￾zational changes just to survive. HP’s traditional and 
current strategies were built on innovation, differen￾tiation, and high quality. Another important feature 
of HP, and one of its more enduring characteristics, 
is the “HP Way”—a cultural artifact that supports a 
participative management style and emphasizes 
commonness of purpose and teamwork on one 
hand and individual freedom and initiative on the 
other. Over time, however, the HP Way has been 
both a constraint to and a facilitator of change.
For example, the HP Way has been at the root of 
the company’s difficulties in institutionalizing struc￾tural and behavioral changes to bring about more 
cooperation among the computer divisions. The 
initial structural change occurred in 1982 when HP 
trans formed itself from a producer of high-quality 
electro nic measuring instruments into a computer 
company. At the time, computers and computer￾related equipment accounted for only about one￾third of revenues and HP was structured into more 
than 50 highly autonomous and decentralized 
product divisions focused on specialized niche mar￾kets. Individual engineers came up with innovative 
ideas and “bootstrapped” new products any way 
they could. Organization members were encour￾aged to work with other engineers in other depart￾ments within the same division, but there was little 
incentive to coordinate the development of tech￾nologies across divisions. This focus on the individ￾ual was supported by a performance management 
system that measured and rewarded “sustained 
contributions;” the key to success for an individual 
was working with many people in the division. HP 
prospered by maximizing each of its parts.
Former CEO John Young’s decision to focus on 
computers fundamentally shifted the keys to suc￾cess. Computer production required a coordinated 
effort among the different component divisions and 
market shares large enough to encourage software 
vendors to write programs for their machines. In a 
culture that supported individual contributions over 
divisional cooperation, Young placed all the instru￾ments divisions into one group and all the compu￾ter divisions into another group, a basic design that 
persisted until the spin-off of the Agilent instru￾ments business in 1999. In addition, he centralized 
research, marketing, and manufacturing, which had 
previously been assigned to the divisions. Problems 
quickly arose. In one case, the company’s new and 
highly touted graphics printer would not work with 
its HP3000 minicomputer. The operating software, 
made by a third HP division, would not allow the 
two pieces of hardware to interface.
In response, the computer group formed com￾mittees to figure out what new technologies to 
pursue, which to ignore, which of HP’s products 
should be saved, and which would be shelved. As 
the committees came up with recommendations, 
the committees themselves kept multiplying. The 
company’s entrenched culture, built around the 
HP Way’s philosophy of egalitarianism and mutual 
respect, promoted consensus: Everyone had to 
have a hand in making a decision.
application 11.2CHAPTER 11 Evaluating and Institutionalizing OD Interventions 209
By 1988, the organization chart still showed 
a predominantly decentralized divisional struc￾ture. What it didn’t show was the overwhelm￾ing number of committees that slowed decision 
making and product development. In one case, it 
took seven months and nearly a hundred people 
on nine committees to name the company’s new 
software product. This web of committees, origi￾nally designed to foster communication among 
HP’s operating divisions, had pushed up costs 
and slowed development. In the rapidly changing 
world of software, personal computers, minicom￾puters, and printers, the HP Way was hamstringing 
the organization’s success. The ethic of individual 
freedom balanced by teamwork had produced an 
unwieldy bureaucracy.
After a series of delays of important new products, 
John Young reorganized the computer group. In 
late 1990, he eliminated most of the committees 
and removed layers of management by dividing 
the computer business into two groups: one to 
handle personal computers and peripherals sold 
through dealers, and the other to handle sales of 
workstations and minicomputers to big customers. 
To match the organization structure, the previ￾ously centralized corporate salesforce was split 
and assigned to particular divisions. This change 
focused HP’s computer systems on the market and 
restored much of the autonomy to the divisions. 
The balance between individuality and common 
purpose that characterized the original HP Way 
was unleashed, leading to several years of strong 
revenue and profit growth.
In 1993, and before he was officially installed as the 
new CEO, Lewis Platt announced that HP would 
pursue the convergence of several base technolo￾gies, such as wireless communication, printing, 
and measurement, to create whole new products 
for the converging computer, communication, and 
consumer electronics markets. Implementing such 
a strategy again depended on strong coordination 
among HP’s product divisions. To ensure that the 
gains in cooperation were not lost as HP embarked 
on its new strategy, CEO Platt tied division manag￾ers’ incentive compensation to working coopera￾tively with other divisions to create new products 
that used multiple-division technologies.
The new structure was also a big success. Growth 
in the printer and PC markets drove revenues from 
$13.2 billion in 1990 to $38.4 billion in 1996, with 
profits growing in the same proportions. In 1996, 
they were the fifth-most-admired company in the 
United States. In the Internet world, however, their 
success was short-lived, and critics argued that 
Platt’s subsequent attention to “soft” issues such as 
work/life balance and promoting diversity, rather 
than launching an Internet strategy, resulted in 
stalled growth. For 1997 and 1998, and aided by the 
Asian financial crisis, growth rates slipped to single 
digits. In the summer of 1998, Platt believed that HP 
had simply become too big and complex. In March 
1999, he announced and implemented the spin-off 
of HP’s $7.6 billion instruments division, the busi￾ness on which the company had been founded.
Shortly after being named HP’s fourth CEO in 1999, 
and the first to come from outside the company, 
Carly Fiorina laid out her agenda: create a compel￾ling vision for HP, implement a structure to support 
the vision, and launch a marketing campaign to 
build the HP brand. The vision called for a shift from 
a stand-alone products company to a services com￾pany. The structural change involved merging the 
four major product divisions into a group focused 
on computing and a group focused on printing. This 
structure for the first time united HP’s laser and 
inkjet printing divisions and furthered the oppor￾tunities for computer products to coordinate their 
activities. Fiorina also announced a major marketing 
campaign focused on the HP Way’s value of innova￾tion. Then, in the fall of 2001, Fiorina announced 
the intended acquisition of Compaq computers.
The lessons of history have not been lost on the 
CEO. The acquisition process pulled knowledge 
from the experiences of other mergers and other 
changes within HP; it acknowledged the strengths 
and weaknesses of the HP Way; and structural 
changes have been backed up with changes in 
the compensation system. Few organizations have 
implemented as many major changes and still 
maintained both strong financial performance and 
corporate reputation. HP’s history of seeing the 
need for, implementing, and reaping the benefits of 
structural change is a testament to its ability to insti￾tutionalize change, as these examples demonstrate.210 PART 2 The Process of Organization Development

NOTES
SUMMARY
We discussed in this chapter the final two stages of planned change—evaluating inter￾ventions and institutionalizing them. Evaluation was discussed in terms of two kinds of 
necessary feedback: implementation feedback, concerned with whether the interven￾tion is being implemented as intended, and evaluation feedback, indicating whether the 
intervention is producing expected results. The former comprises collected data about 
features of the intervention, perceptions of the people involved, and its immediate 
effects, which are fed back repeatedly and at short intervals. The latter comprises data 
about the long-term effects of the intervention, which are fed back at long intervals.
Evaluation of interventions also involves decisions about measurement and research 
design. Measurement issues focus on selecting variables and designing good measures. 
Ideally, measurement decisions should derive from the theory underlying the interven￾tion and should include measures of the features of the intervention and its immediate 
and long-term consequences. Further, these measures should be operationally defined, 
reliable, and valid and should involve multiple methods, such as a combination of ques￾tionnaires, interviews, and company records.
Research design focuses on setting up the conditions for making valid assessments of 
an intervention’s effects. This involves ruling out explanations for the observed results 
other than the intervention. Although randomized experimental designs are rarely fea￾sible in OD, quasi-experimental designs exist for eliminating alternative explanations.
OD interventions are institutionalized when the change program persists and becomes 
part of the organization’s normal functioning. A framework for understanding and 
improving the institutionalization of interventions identified organization characteristics 
(congruence, stability of environment and technology, and unionization) and intervention 
characteristics (goal specificity, programmability, level of change target, internal support, 
and sponsorship) that affect institutionalization processes. The framework also described 
specific institutionalization processes (socialization, commitment, reward allocation, diffu￾sion, and sensing and calibration) that directly affect indicators of intervention persistence 
(knowledge, performance, preferences, normative consensus, and value consensus).CHAPTER 11 Evaluating and Institutionalizing OD Interventions 211

of my engagements. The person calling identi￾fied himself as Robert Denton, the plant man￾ager of Kenworth Motors’ Seattle truck 
manufacturing operations. Denton said he’d 
gotten my name from Charles Wright, a client 
of mine in Seattle. Charlie is the OD manager 
for a major timber products company. I’d been 
doing several projects with Charlie’s group of 
internal consultants for the past three years 
and occasionally served as the OD group’s 
consultant. Denton noted that Charlie and he 
were members of the same sailing club. He 
went on to say that when, as someone rela￾tively new to Seattle, he’d asked Charlie if he 
knew any consultants, Charlie had spoken 
highly of me. I remember thinking that 
Charlie probably wouldn’t have mentioned 
me unless he thought I could be useful to 
Denton. My trust in Charlie’s competence and 
judgment was very high.
Denton went on to explain that he’d been the 
plant manager for only eight months, that 
things seemed to be going well, but that he 
had a gnawing sense that things could be bet￾ter. I must have murmured something appro￾priate because Denton invited me to visit him 
and become acquainted with his operation.
I was both flattered by and interested in 
Denton’s invitation. After all, I thought to 
myself, it’s nice to be wanted, a consulting 
engagement might come out of it, I always 
wanted to get behind the gate of the Kenworth 
plant, and Denton sounded like a basically 
smart guy and nice besides. However, reality 
intruded into my thoughts, as it often does.
THOUGHTS ON THE ROAD
I reminded Denton that I lived across the state 
in Spokane and added that I had limited time 
available in the short run. I noted that I had 
plans to visit Seattle in three weeks and could 
see him then, otherwise it might not be for a 
month. Denton sounded almost eager as he 
agreed to a 10 A.M. appointment on April 11.
The drive westward from Spokane across the 
state of Washington on Interstate 90 begins 
with several hours of boring highway. I had 
purposely put off thinking about my appoint￾ment with Robert Denton until I was on the 
road. As the interstate stretched out over the 
rolling sagebrush hills and checkered wheat 
fields, I turned my thoughts to Kenworth 
Motors and Denton. Uppermost in my mind 
was that I was about to talk with a man I 
knew little about, consult with a firm I knew 
very little about, and I had no focused agenda. 
What should I say and do?
As the miles went by, I envisioned several 
alternative scenarios for my upcoming 
appointment with Robert Denton, the plant 
manager of the truck manufacturing division 
of Kenworth Motors Corporation. I saw his 
office in several possible ways. It could be 
spartan and centrally located to the produc￾tion floor. It could be conventionally furnished 
but of a fair size. It could be large. It might 
even be opulent. It could be personalized 
with mementos of career, hobbies, or family. 
It might be far from the production floor, or 
even in a separate building. The more I tried 
to envision Denton’s office, the more alterna￾tives came to mind. So I focused on Denton, 
trying to imagine him from the voice cues on 
the telephone—not old, probably fit, probably 
clean shaven. Again the futility of trying to 
imagine came home to me.
What did I think I knew? I didn’t know much 
beyond a handful of facts about his title and 
his job tenure, the fact that he knew Charlie, 
believed things were generally going OK at 
the plant, and had some vague notion some￾thing wasn’t quite right. I also had the distinct 
impression he had been fairly eager to talk 
with me—after all, he’d initiated calling me 
Kenworth MotorsSELECTED CASES 213
and had quickly settled for an appointment 
convenient to me.
What did I really want to accomplish when I 
met with Denton? The more I considered this 
question, the more I pared down my answers. 
At minimum, it seemed for me a low-cost 
situation—a couple of hours of my time, per￾haps some impressions of me that would be 
communicated to Charlie (though I believed 
Charlie and I had a relationship of mutual 
respect and trust based on a lot of shared 
work). On the other hand, there was 
potentially a lot to gain—perhaps another 
consulting job, perhaps more visibility and 
reputation in Seattle, which would be good 
for my business.
I decided I couldn’t plan for our meeting in 
much detail; about all I could reasonably do 
was to be true to the posture I found to be use￾ful in situations like this. I had to be myself, be 
as real as possible. I see myself as a curious, 
friendly person who basically likes others. I 
also know I can be bold and thought I might 
have to be to get the conversation going, to 
help Denton become clear as to why we were 
talking together, and to clarify my role.
I also wanted to leave our meeting with a 
decision to either go forward or not. While I 
didn’t mind investing a little time, my time 
was valuable. I also felt strongly, as I always 
do, that I didn’t want to work with anyone 
who I didn’t basically like as a person or who 
didn’t seem to genuinely want to do some real 
work. Seeing the Cascade mountains on the 
horizon, I began to feel easier. I’d be myself, 
whatever happened. Only one question 
nagged: Could Denton and I connect swiftly 
enough so there would be time to push for 
clarity in our possible work relationship?
MAKING CONTACT
At the Kenworth plant, the uniformed guard 
at the plant gate checked his clipboard, 
slipped around my car, and copied down my 
license plate number. Returning to my open 
window, he pointed ahead to a one-story 
brick building attached to the multistoried 
plant and told me I could park in the space in 
front and then go inside and identify myself 
to the receptionist.
The floor of the wide hallway inside the 
double glass doors of the office building was 
freshly waxed. Framed photographs of trucks 
and large buildings lined the walls. A middle￾aged woman in a suit looked up from her 
desk and smiled. After I identified myself, 
she led me down a side corridor to an alcove 
and informed the secretary there who I was 
and that I was there to see Mr. Denton. She 
then turned to me, smiled again, and wished 
me a good day. The seated secretary told me 
Mr. Denton was expecting me, but was on 
the telephone. She gestured toward a bank 
of chairs and asked me to wait. As I sat 
down, I observed the corridor traffic, busy 
but quiet. I settled back to wait.
About 10 minutes later, a man of medium 
height and build wearing a sports jacket over 
an open-collared shirt came through the door 
behind the secretary and walked directly to 
me. He extended his hand, smiled, introduced 
himself as Bob Denton and motioned me into 
his office.
The office was larger than I expected. It was 
paneled and a large Persian rug was centered 
on the floor. At one end were a clean desk 
with side chairs and a table full of papers 
behind it. At the other side of the office were 
a couch and two stuffed chairs around a low 
coffee table. Drapes framed one large window 
that looked out on the parking lot. Denton 
asked if I wanted coffee, and I said I did. He 
went to the door and asked the secretary to 
bring us both coffee and added we were not to 
be disturbed. While waiting for the coffee, we 
sat on the two stuffed chairs and made small 
talk. He asked about my drive across the state; 
I asked about the framed sailing prints on the 
wall and whether he’d been sailing lately. We 
chatted about the Sonics, the Kingdome, and 
the coming World’s Fair in Vancouver. After 214 PART 2 The Process of Organisation Development
our coffee arrived, I asked him to tell me 
about his plant and products.
Denton spoke excitedly for 10 or 12 minutes 
on a wide range of topics— the daily produc￾tion rate of 23 trucks, the cost of a truck, the 
sales order backlog, some equipment updat￾ing just finished, his coming to this job from 
a plant in the Midwest, his spending a lot of 
time lately with the next year’s budget, and 
so forth. My impression of Denton was that 
he was highly involved in his work. He 
spoke rapidly but clearly with enthusiasm. 
Finally, he leaned back, smiled, and said, 
“Well, I’ve been going on, haven’t I?” I 
remember thinking I liked Denton’s ease and 
his willingness to talk about his plant and 
himself. I’d already learned a lot about the 
plant and his job without more than looking 
interested. Denton certainly did seem lik￾able, and he was younger and more casual 
than I expected.
GETTING DOWN TO BUSINESS
I clearly recall my response to Denton’s ques￾tion. “Actually, I’ve appreciated your sharing 
all this background with me. I’ve always been 
curious about this plant. Years ago, I had a 
part-time job when I was in college and used 
to deliver some industrial supplies in this end 
of town and always wanted to know what 
happened in this plant. All I could see from 
the road were those lines of big shiny trucks. 
It’s nice to know they’re built with care. But 
you asked for this meeting, Bob. Remember 
you told me that while things were going well 
here you sensed something wasn’t quite right. 
Can you tell me a little more now?”
“Not really. I know the plant is doing fine. I 
feel pretty much on top of my job. I like what 
I’m doing here very much. My department 
heads—all nine of them—are all good people. 
All but two have been here quite a while. 
They’re dependable, damn good at what they 
do, get along fine, and basically are good man￾agers,” he said.
“I get along good with everyone. I go out in 
the plant every day and circulate around. 
Things are moving smoothly. My two newer 
managers —one runs our purchasing and 
inventory, the other is in personnel—couldn’t 
be working out better. Yet some things nag at 
me that I can’t put my finger on. I guess it boils 
down to some crazy notion I have that while 
we get along fine and work together well, we 
haven’t jelled together as a team quite like I’d 
hoped.”
I bombarded Denton with questions, trying to 
find something that didn’t hang together or 
might indicate a problem. No matter what I 
asked about—from union relations to accounts 
receivable, from engineering-production rela￾tions to turnover figures—Denton’s responses 
were consistently factual and full, and every￾thing seemed to be in remarkably good shape.
I caught myself from going on with more 
questions. Instead I said, “Bob, everything 
I’ve been asking about tells me you’re OK. 
Maybe things here really are OK. Maybe 
you’ve just got some apprehension that things 
couldn’t be that good. After all, you’ve been 
here long enough to really know. While there 
is some chance that you’re not well informed, 
and some things aren’t so hot, the odds are 
against it. About all I can suggest is whether 
you might want someone like me to indepen￾dently confirm how things are going.” Denton 
smiled as if to himself and replied, “Hmm, 
maybe, what would you suggest?”
“What’s usually done in situations like this, if 
there is the interest and if there is the money 
to pay for it, is to engage someone like me to 
spend a few days interviewing a sample of 
managers and other key staff people to see 
what might turn up.”
“From what you’ve heard so far, do you think 
that makes sense here?” Denton asked.
“Frankly, I don’t know. It might be worth it to 
you just to learn things really are OK. What 
usually happens, however, is that I do find out 
about something that could be improved. After SELECTED CASES 215
all that’s what I’m supposed to be good at, find￾ing problems. One way or another, Bob, the 
mere fact I was here would have some impact. 
The word would spread pretty fast that some 
outsider was snooping around. What impact 
that might have I can’t say. If things really are 
OK, my presence might mean little. If there are 
real problems, my being here would probably 
create some tensions, it could raise expecta￾tions that something would be done about 
them, and it could even cause problems.”
Denton nodded, “I see what you mean. If you 
came in, it would cost me some bucks, it would 
have some risks in how my people reacted; 
one way or another I’d have to do something.” 
He paused and then went on. “Well, to tell the 
truth, I don’t want to upset things if they’re 
OK, but just finding out whether they are or 
not appeals to me. Isn’t there some other way 
to do this?”
Bob Denton seemed to me to be open to some 
minimal work by me. He’d responded as I’d 
hoped to my candidness about the risks of 
some conventional diagnostic snooping. He’d 
really seemed to pay attention to what I’d 
said, and I was beginning to like him and was 
intrigued with the situation. At times like this, 
my thought processes seem to jump into high 
gear. After all, a careful response was called 
for and there were a number of considerations 
to factor in. The things I recall noting to 
myself went like this: apparently some mini￾mal motivation on Bob’s part; my real lack of 
information about the Kenworth situation; 
my own schedule for the coming months—
which was pretty full; my intuition that prob￾ably nothing major was wrong with Bob and 
his managers; and that whatever I proposed 
had to be of modest cost.
LET’S HAVE A RETREAT
I said to Bob: “Let me sketch out one idea that 
comes to mind. We could do a modest retreat. 
You, your department managers, and I could 
meet away from here for a couple of days, say 
on a weekend, to jointly explore how things 
are going. At minimum, I see several probable 
outcomes from such a meeting: everyone 
would get somewhat better acquainted with 
one another; we’d know better if there were 
serious issues to tackle; we’d have the experi￾ence of jointly going through problem identi￾fication; and you’d get a sense of whether or 
not your team was open to working with an 
outsider like myself.”
I paused and went on: “Such a meeting would 
be relatively efficient. It wouldn’t take time 
away from work, and it wouldn’t cost an arm 
and a leg.” Bob nodded, sipped his coffee and 
looked at me intently. “OK,” he said, “I can see 
your points. Just what would we be doing?”
Seeing Bob’s interest as well as warming to 
the idea myself, I went on to outline a retreat. 
I suggested doing it at a country club or lodge 
within a few hours’ drive of Seattle. This set￾ting was to provide a symbolic break from the 
customary business environment, and because 
it would cost everyone weekend time and the 
company the expense of travel, food, and 
lodging, it would show Bob’s seriousness 
about the event. I then suggested we begin 
with cocktails and dinner on a Friday eve￾ning, work all day Saturday with appropriate 
breaks, and conclude by noon Sunday. Again, 
Bob nodded. He then asked, “But what would 
we do? What would you charge?”
I did some quick calculations and responded, 
“As for my fee, I’d have to bill you for a mini￾mum of three days at my daily rate of $___ per 
day, and travel expenses—assuming Kenworth 
would provide food and lodging. As for what 
we’d actually do, that’s more difficult to say 
exactly. Frankly, while I have several ways to 
get us started, I’d need to play it by ear. In gen￾eral, it would be my responsibility to see we 
talked straight and a lot with one another to 
surface our concerns both big and small. I’m 
afraid you’d have to trust me on this.” I said 
this last couple of sentences with some trepida￾tion, knowing from my experience that most 216 PART 2 The Process of Organisation Development
managers would want much more clarity, but 
I needed to know how Bob was viewing me.
I was surprised at what happened next. 
Denton quickly agreed to have a retreat 
weekend as I’d outlined. We also selected a 
weekend a month-and-a-half away. He would 
find a site and let me know. In addition, we 
agreed he would use the phrase “a communi￾cations workshop” when he informed partici￾pants. Glancing at my watch as I left Denton’s 
office, I saw it was just 11:30.

The partners of Square One Consulting were 
having lunch at Peppercorn Dining on the
campus of All-American University. Although 
Square One was headquartered nearby, most 
of the consultants’ business was conducted in 
other cities. The partners were enjoying having 
the opportunity to attend a seminar on a cam￾pus in their hometown. By chance, Drew 
Randall, the manager of Pep-percorn, noticed 
the trio and recognized Erica, who had worked 
her way through college as a student manager 
at the dining unit. Drew pulled up a chair and 
started to catch up on the two years that had 
transpired since she had graduated. The other 
consultants, Roger and Lynn, listened as they 
began to reminisce about the “good old days” 
at Peppercorn.
Erica recalled the time a swim test coincided 
with her first shift at the dining hall. She 
called to let the unit know she would be 
detained, and she finally arrived about an 
hour late. When Erica entered the unit, she 
was greeted by a supervisor who took her 
downstairs to change into the uniform of blue 
pants, blue-and-white-checkered shirt, a hair 
net, and a name tag, an outfit similar to what 
was being worn by the current employees. 
Erica was then taken to the dish room and 
informed she was receiving a verbal warning 
for being late. As the group laughed, the con￾sultants chided Erica further by commenting 
that her sense of timing hadn’t changed. Drew, 
however, suggested that times had changed.
DEVELOPING A CONTRACT
The consultants were eager to learn about Pep￾percorn, and Erica, eager to learn about the 
changes Drew had alluded to, asked about 
current operations at the unit. Drew, sipping on 
his coffee, commented, “Staffing is a nightmare. 
We can’t find qualified people anywhere; 
recruiting and retention has become a constant 
challenge.” Drew went on to explain that the 
labor market in the county had become tight 
due to the prosperous Reagan years. Garden 
County had become a boomtown and, as a 
result, the university was having difficulty 
gaining employees. Roger wondered aloud 
about the general steps Peppercorn had taken 
to offset the current labor shortage.
Drew, sensing the consultant’s interest, openly 
discussed his perceptions of the dining unit. 
He stated:
I would like to make Peppercorn a more 
pleasant place for everyone to work. I get 
great productivity out of these guys and 
they really care. It’s just that there needs to 
be something more. Maybe morale is a little 
low. There’s not much creativity involved in 
most of the tasks, but the cooks feel great 
when they sell out of stuff. However, when 
we sell out, it’s probably because the fore￾cast was incorrect rather than as a response 
to a good product. I take a humanistic man￾agement approach, maybe they just need 
some kind of support. On the other hand, 
I may give them too much autonomy since 
I let them manage themselves to a large 
degree.
I believe that scheduling is management’s 
right. I base my scheduling on operational 
need. Ultimately, the manager is responsible 
for the success or failure of the operation, 
therefore, I should have the right to put the 
people where I deem best. You know, niche 
management. Although, I did inherit a lot of 
the schedule.
As Erica tentatively nodded her head in 
response to Drew’s comments, Roger and 
Lynn caught each other’s gaze and shrugged 
inquisitively. By the consultants’ behavior, it 
was apparent they were wondering about the 
meaning behind Drew’s words. However, 
because he was obviously in the mood to talk, 
the consultants did not interrupt.
Peppercorn Dining218 PART 2 The Process of Organisation Development
Warming up to his listeners, Drew continued, 
“Some employees have been at Peppercorn, 
working in the same position, for 20 plus 
years. Bob, the day cook, has been working 
here for 28 years. Can you believe that Doug, 
the night cook, has been here for 10 years 
and is waiting for Bob to retire so that he can 
transfer to the day shift? Doug may have to 
wait a long time since Bob won’t be retiring 
for at least 15 years. It’s hard for me to believe 
that Doug looks forward to that time and that 
he refuses to transfer to another dining unit.”
“That’s amazing,” said Roger. “You seem to 
have loyal employees. It must be easy to man￾age people who know their job so well.”
Drew responded:
It’s not that simple. The union contract forms 
a second set of rules and operating parame￾ters. The contract deals with turnover, sick 
leave, pay, promotion, and all of the other 
usual stuff. It seems that there is no reward 
for non-sickness, but there is a reward for 
sickness. Now people get one and a half 
times the pay for sick days if they are on 
overtime. If they are on overtime, absentee￾ism is more of a contractual issue than a 
workplace issue.
Frankly, I believe that staffing affects attitudes 
and attitudes affect quality; both of which 
affect productivity. Increased productivity 
means making better use of time. Perhaps 
I should structure the tasks in a better way, 
but managing and working behind the lines 
makes it difficult for me to see the trees 
through the forest. There’s no time for any￾one to stand back and see what’s happening.
Drew paused and, as if speaking more to him￾self than to the consultants, said, “Since I’ve 
been so busy, maybe I’ve lost track of some of 
my priorities.” Turning to the consultants, 
Drew inquired about their experience with 
situations of this type and what advice they 
might offer.
The partners explained they are usually con￾tacted by organizations when management 
believes an external opinion could provide a 
fresh outlook on operations. They went on to 
state they normally begin their work by 
performing an operations audit, the results of 
which are presented to management. Additi￾onally, when the situation warrants, strategic 
interventions are designed to facilitate the 
achievement of management objectives. The 
partners further indicated they believe it is 
essential to become familiar with an organiza￾tion before appropriate suggestions can be 
made.
Without hesitation, Drew said to the consul￾tants, “The situation here at Peppercorn has 
been concerning me for quite some time. 
I know that you must be very busy, but per￾haps you could find the time to work with 
me. Erica already knows a lot about the oper￾ation, and it wouldn’t take long for her to 
become reacquainted.”
Because the consultants were planning to be 
in the area for several days to attend the 
seminar and to complete some paperwork, 
Erica suggested they observe operations at 
Peppercorn. The group, discussing Erica’s 
suggestion, agreed that the first stage should be 
a preliminary evaluation of the unit, followed 
by a feedback session with management. Then, 
based on the outcome, management could 
conduct an in-depth operations audit. Drew 
concurred that evaluation and feedback could 
be useful first steps in achieving his goals.
He restated that his goals for Peppercorn were 
to increase productivity and to improve morale 
among the workers.
The consultants concluded their discussion by 
telling Drew they would drop off a written 
contract by the following afternoon. The con￾tract would include their fee structure as well 
as a schedule of the dates and times they 
would like to be on the premises.
REVIEWING BACKGROUND 
INFORMATION
Two days later, the team gathered around the 
table in Roger’s office to discuss the Peppercorn 
consultation. Roger and Lynn initiated the 
discussion by reintroducing the subject of SELECTED CASES 219
Erica’s objectivity. It became obvious that all 
three of the partners were concerned about 
how Erica’s past experiences would bias her 
view of the operation. The partners also dis￾cussed the fact that Erica’s views would influ￾ence Roger and Lynn’s perceptions of the 
dining unit. Although Erica believed she
could recognize and work with her bias, she 
suggested she focus on gathering current 
managerial data. Because their time was lim￾ited, Lynn recommended that Erica also con￾duct a few on-site interviews with people who 
would be more candid with an old friend than 
with strangers.
As he was reaching for a notepad, Roger 
asked Erica about the general operating pro￾cedures and the key personnel at Peppercorn. 
Erica began outlining the operation:
Peppercorn’s hours are 11 A.M. to 7:30 P.M., 
Monday through Friday. When I first started, 
we served about 1,500 to 1,600 lunches and 
900 to 1,000 dinners daily. By the time I 
graduated, the counts were down by about 
30 percent at lunch and approximately 
50 percent at dinner.
When I was a student worker at Peppercorn, 
there were full-time employees, all of whom 
were union members. There were also stu￾dent workers, and we had our own student 
management staff. When I first started 
working, there were more student workers 
than when I graduated. Some of the gaps 
were filled by full-time temporary workers.
Lynn pointed out that it would be important 
to determine if these changes were affecting 
the operation. Erica agreed and indicated that 
by the time she had graduated, minor con￾flicts were arising between student and tem￾porary workers at Peppercorn. Erica continued 
her briefing by providing an overview of the 
key personnel during her tenure with All￾American Dining, the parent organization of 
Peppercorn.
Erica stated:
Drew is obviously the manager of Peppercorn. 
He was also the manager of the Salt Mill 
over at the “B”-School. He was responsible 
to Stan O’Malley, one of the assistant direc￾tors of All-American Dining. Stan supervised 
Drew and Beth Clarkson, the manager of 
food service in the student union.
John Cerrano was the receiving clerk. He 
always worked closely with Drew. There 
never seemed to be any problems with his 
work; he always knew where everything was 
because he received the goods and then put 
them in storage. John, or “Bo-bo” as we 
called him, was the shop steward. He had a 
close relationship with most of the employ￾ees and a bunch of us used to go out drinking 
with him regularly.
Matt Copperfield was definitely a key player. 
Matt was the professional supervisor who 
handled inventory, purchasing, scheduling, 
and other administrative tasks. It always 
seemed as if he was at the heart of the opera￾tion. I can’t remember her name, but there 
was a secretary who was also in a pivotal 
position. She had access to a lot of informa￾tion and she was the source and respondent 
of all official Peppercorn communication.
The student supervisors were the only other 
key players that I can think of at this point, 
and they had extensive responsibilities which 
included daily management, scheduling, and 
hiring of the student workers.
The partners’ conversation shifted to the amo￾unt of time available for the investigation. 
Lynn asked her partners how much time they 
thought was necessary for conducting the ini￾tial investigation. “Well, Lynn,” replied Roger, 
“based on the information we have so far, it’s 
possible that the longtime employees may not 
be as open as we might like. They may be 
protective of their turf.” Lynn agreed but 
added that they shouldn’t jump to any con￾clusions. She noted that often it was the old￾time employees who were most interested in 
talking about their work.
The consultants agreed that three days should 
be an ample amount of time to gather the nec￾essary data and to develop a presentation for 
the management of Peppercorn Dining. The 
consultants concluded the meeting by agreeing 
that Lynn would concentrate on the production 220 PART 2 The Process of Organisation Development
areas of the unit while Roger would survey 
front-of-house operations.
DAY ONE: INTERVIEWS 
AND OBSERVATIONS
Lynn was the first to arrive at Peppercorn the 
following morning. As she approached the 
facility, she noticed that three female employ￾ees were smoking cigarettes on the loading 
dock, joking around with a purveyor. Lynn 
introduced herself and lingered with the 
workers for a few minutes.
Back of House
Entering the kitchen from the loading dock, 
Lynn noticed it was clean and most of the 
equipment looked relatively new. The kitchen 
had fairly good fluorescent lighting, and natu￾ral lighting was provided by windows in the 
pot washing and food preparation areas.
As Lynn placed her coat and briefcase on a 
rack in the storage area, she observed that the 
dry goods were neatly arranged, although the 
supplies were not plentiful. From the store￾room doorway, she could see that the workers 
were busy, but not rushed. The members of 
the kitchen staff chatted as they worked and 
they appeared to know what tasks to perform 
without needing direction.
The kitchen was divided into five areas (as 
shown in Exhibit 1). After introducing her self 
to the workers and taking a brief tour of the 
kitchen, Lynn positioned herself near the 
walk-in cooler where she could easily see most 
of the kitchen operations. She noticed that the 
walk-in cooler and freezer were clean and were 
stocked with a moderate amount of supplies. 
She also observed that the workers’ uniforms 
were clean. However, some of the workers 
were wearing aprons and some were not. As if 
reading her thoughts, a student worker passing 
through the room commented to no one in 
particular, “We’re out of aprons again. Oh well, 
it’s no big deal.” Lynn wondered what else 
might not be a “big deal” to the workers.
The doors to the dining facility were opened 
at 10:55 A.M. at which time the pantry work￾ers took a break.
Bob, the day chef, was grilling sandwiches in 
the tilt brazier while Robert, the day cook, was 
breading pork. Robert moved between food 
preparation, the fryer, and the steamer. During 
lunch service, the kitchen staff appeared to
be relaxed. Although there was not much 
talking, they did joke with each other from 
time to time.
Shortly after 11:00 A.M., a man wearing a 
chefs uniform entered the kitchen and greeted 
the other workers. He then took a clipboard 
and a stack of computer printouts to a table 
near where Lynn was standing. Lynn felt a bit 
awkward until he introduced himself as Doug, 
the dinner chef.
Lynn explained she was observing the facility 
in order to become familiar with the opera￾tion. Doug showed interest in Lynn’s curiosity 
and stated:
I want the kitchen to run as smoothly as 
possible. I believe that it takes organization, 
mor-ale, communication, and a system to 
have an efficient operation. Communication 
is important. I ask the servers how things 
are working out so that I know if I should 
change anything. I try to maintain a routine 
system so there won’t be many questions 
during service. I train all of my workers and 
I enjoy having the opportunity to teach. I’ve 
been in food service for 25 years and at 
Peppercorn for 10 years. I started working 
in the food service industry when I was 
about 11.
I think that Peppercorn has the best food on 
campus. Some of my own recipes have been 
accepted by management and are now a part 
of the menu computer bank. I’ve also devel￾oped ideas that have been adopted here and 
at other campus dining facilities. For exam￾ple, I started the trend of keeping plastic tast￾ing spoons by the steam kettles. I’m also the 
person who started using a yellow marker to 
highlight important items on the computer 
printouts.SELECTED CASES 221
As Lynn and Doug were talking, a man came 
over and listened to their conversation. Doug’s 
speech became hesitant in this man’s pres￾ence. After only a few minutes, the man left. 
Lynn wondered who the man was and why 
he had such an effect on Doug. From the way 
he was dressed, there was no way to deter￾mine if he worked at Peppercorn, was from 
the union, or was part of the All-American 
management staff.

Coincidentally, Doug explained to Lynn that 
the man was Larry, the professional supervisor. 
He went on to say Larry plans the menus and 
tries to balance the use of ovens and kettles 
so the equipment is not overloaded. According 
to Doug, Larry prints out the menus from a 
computer located in the office. Doug added 
that the computer system does not always 
work the way it should. The system is supposed 
to print menus, compile order lists, and check 222 PART 2 The Process of Organisation Development

the inventory. Doug commented, “Sometimes 
it works well, and sometimes not. Sometimes 
the menus have to be changed at the last min￾ute because of short stock. We haven’t had 
any salt all semester. This is mostly a result of 
computer errors.”
Doug went on to talk about some of his 
co-workers. Bob, the lunch chef, has been at 
Peppercorn for 28 years. Chris, the assistant 
dinner chef, has been with the unit for about 
three years. Chris, who moved to the kitchen 
from the short-order station, was trained by 
Doug. They enjoy sharing ideas and they 
always try to prepare the food a day in 
advance.
While Lynn was talking with Doug, she could 
see the cafeteria line by way of a pass-through 
window. She noticed that a steady flow of 
diners was entering the facility. Realizing that 
Doug enjoyed talking about the unit and 
being curious about Doug’s responses, Lynn 
felt comfortable continuing the conversation. 
Observing a student supervisor restocking the 
hot food line, Lynn asked Doug how he felt 
about working with students.
He replied, “Some student workers are 
reliable, while others are less committed.” 
Lynn asked Doug about the role of the 
student supervisor and in response Doug 
called the student over. The student seemed 
unhurried and went on to explain that student 
supervisors do not have any power over the 
regular workers; only over temps and other 
students. Students have their own manage￾ment structure that includes a student 
coordinator, managers, and pay clerk. The 
student personnel coordinator handles com￾plaints. Temps and regular workers take com￾plaints to the regular personnel worker. More 
temps have been needed recently since there 
are less student workers at Peppercorn than 
in previous years.
As Lynn, Doug, and the student were talking, 
Larry entered the kitchen again. When the 
student noticed him, he quickly went back to 
work restocking the food line.
The activity in the kitchen seemed to be 
getting busier, and Lynn decided she should 
move to another position so Doug could 
continue his work. Before she left, Doug 
com-mented about the union. He stated, 
“Skilled workers are on the same union 
contract as unskilled workers. I think that this 
arrangement holds back the skilled workers 
and helps the unskilled to get ahead. It 
doesn’t work well, and we don’t even have a 
shop steward. The only way that I can move 
up in the organ ization is to become part of 
management.”
Lynn bid Doug farewell and went into the 
service area to get some lunch. As she went 
through the cafeteria line, she noticed Roger 
observing the cafeteria service. Lynn invited 
him to join her for lunch, but Roger declined, 
saying he had just begun his observation and 
he wanted to spend some time watching ser￾vice during the busiest hours.
Service Areas
Roger immediately noticed the line servers 
interacted a great deal with the customers. He 
also noted there was no portion control. The 
students would ask the line servers for “a little 
more spaghetti, just meatballs, no corn, more 
sauce, or a small cup of soup.” Each customer 
wanted the standard portions or combinations 
of food items altered to meet their personal 
needs, and they were accommodated.
The first line server plates the entrees and the 
second worker serves the side dishes (see 
Exhibit 2). The workers must communicate in 
order to properly fill each order. The overall 
atmosphere in the serving area was relaxed. 
Roger timed the service and discovered it took 
two to four minutes for a customer to enter 
the line and be served during a busy period.
As the flow of customers slowed, Roger initi￾ated a conversation with a line worker who 
introduced herself as Carrie. She told Roger 
she had been at Peppercorn for 10 years and 
was a door checker for 9½ of those years. She 
explained the door checker made sure that 224 PART 2 The Process of Organisation Development
only diners on the university meal plan were 
allowed in the noncash dining area. She went 
on to say she had become bored with her 
position. She was also dissatisfied with her 
former hours, which were from 11 A.M. to 
7:30 P.M. Carrie attained her new position 
with Drew’s help. He facilitated a trade 
between her and a line server. Now that the 
swap is final, Carrie believes the other woman, 
who is now the door checker, may not think 
the trade was equitable.
During his conversation with Carrie, Roger 
saw the chef come out of the kitchen and pick 
up an empty pan. The chef lingered for a min￾ute. He appeared to be watching the line ser￾vice. Roger returned his attention to Carrie 
and continued the conversation by asking her 
about line staffing. Carrie explained, “Usually 
there are three main workers on the line, two 
full-timers at one station and one student or 
temp at the other. We choose our own positions 
on the line and we usually stick to the same 
spots. When it gets busy, additional student 
workers fill in. Today one full-timer is sick, so 
a temp from another area filled the position. 
Sometimes they can’t find substitutes, so we 
just have to work that much harder.”
Roger stepped aside as a student worker 
carrying a tray of soup cups began to restock 
the service line. Roger apologized for any 
inconvenience and explained he was a member 
of a group learning about the operations at 
Peppercorn. Roger asked the student if he 
could take a moment to tell him about the 
relationship between student and nonstudent 
workers.
The student explained that Peppercorn is 
supposed to be staffed primarily by students. 
The students are grouped into three segments: 
student managers, student supervisors, 
and student workers. However, he said, “Since 
the supply of students has been diminishing 
over the years, more temps have had to fill 
the positions. There’s a lot of tension between 
students and temps as well as between stu￾dents and full-timers. This isn’t surprising 
since the students supervise the operation. 
They call us ‘students’ as opposed to ‘supervi￾sors’ and we seem to be stereotyped.”
He clarified his statement, saying, “There’s a 
discrepancy with age, economic status, and 
experience in many cases. Only the full- timers 
and the professional managers are not under 
the supervision of students. Students have
a difficult time supervising older people, and 
older people have a difficult time taking 
orders from young people who they probably 
consider similar to their own children.”
The student went back to work, leaving Roger 
to his thoughts. He was reminded of the con￾versation that he had with his partners about 
the conflicts between student and nonstudent 
workers. It was becoming clear to Roger that 
this was an important issue.

Just as Roger was beginning to consider the 
problems that can arise from role conflict and 
role ambiguity, he was startled by the sound 
of shattering glass. Roger turned in time to 
notice a student stepping away from a bro￾ken glass, acting as if nothing had happened. 
Several dishwashers, on their way to the 
drink station, also saw the broken glass as 
they walked by. Roger was curious to see how 
long it would take for someone to clean up 
the mess. Two minutes later, a dishwasher 
returned and swept up the glass. During this 
time, a student supervisor was informed of 
the problem. Roger noted she never returned 
to make sure the situation was corrected.
Roger followed the dishwasher toward the 
dish room. As he rounded the corner of the 
serving area, Roger heard the sound of blaring 
rock music. Roger had to weave his way 
through a narrow passage that was blocked 
with customers at the cashier’s station.
As he entered the dish room through an open 
doorway, Roger was greeted by a mixture of 
machinery noise, loud music, and a hot, humid 
atmosphere. The machinery was arranged in a 
pattern that allowed many people to perform 
different tasks simultaneously. The five work￾ers gave Roger a cursory glance and continued 
with their tasks.
Roger, feeling a bit out of place and self￾conscious, stood to one side of the work area 
and watched the activity. There was a lot of 
joking, talking, and interacting as the workers 
sorted and cleaned dishes, silverware, glasses, 
and trays. Full dish trays were stacked at the 
rinse station. Each rack was rinsed and then 
sent through the dishwashing machine. When 
the dishes completed their cycle, a worker 
sorted the dishes. Roger noted the worker put 
several freshly washed dishes into racks with 
dirty dishes. He also noticed the silverware 
was run through the dishwasher twice.
Roger wanted to know why the silverware 
had to go through the wash cycle two times, 
so he asked the dish sorter who was positioned 
at the end of the line. The sorter said, “We’re 
concerned that plates and especially the silver 
are clean. We wouldn’t want people catching 
something from someone else.”
The sorter asked Roger what he was doing in 
the dish room. Roger explained and then 
asked the worker how long he had been at 
Peppercorn. The worker said he had been at 
Peppercorn for a year. Further discussion rev￾ealed the worker is on a split shift. He works 
from noon to 4 P.M. and then from 6 P.M. until 
10 P.M. He said he likes having a midday 
break in order to get things done in his per￾sonal life. He explained that he knew three of 
the other workers before he started the job. 
Because he was the newest employee in the 
dish room, he was stationed at the hottest 
position. He pointed out that the two full 
timers he worked with had held their posi￾tions for four and two years, respectively. The 
other three workers, including him, were 
temps.
The worker finished sorting and left the dish 
room to get his co-workers a cold drink. Roger 
went over to the area where workers were 
scraping and sorting dirty plates. The dishes 
and filled racks were piling up. Roger noted 
the dish machine was not able to keep up 
with the demand. He also saw that the paper 
items were shredded with the food scraps and 
that Styrofoam was sorted separately.
The oldest woman in the dish room yelled out 
from time to time, “Come on, keep it movin’.” 
Roger spent a few more minutes observing. 
As he recalled Erica’s story about her first day 
at Peppercorn, Roger wondered why there 
were no students working in the dish room. 
As he was leaving, a student supervisor came 
in to get trays for the service area.
Roger proceeded to the cashier station where 
he found the dish sorter chatting with the 
cashier. After a minute, the sorter returned to 
the dish room. Roger struck up a conversation 
with the cashier. After briefing her about his 
project, the cashier proceeded to tell Roger 226 PART 2 The Process of Organisation Development
about some of her observations and experi￾ences at Peppercorn.
She explained that the cashier’s job is a full￾time, nonunion position she has held for two 
years. She replaced the person who is currently 
the secretary. She enjoys having the opportu￾nity to meet people and getting to know the 
regulars, but she has found that some of the 
students are rude.
The cashier stated, “I usually get along well 
with management. Everyone has their good 
and bad days. I was a manager in my previ￾ous job, so I understand what Drew has to 
deal with. I also understand the problems 
that the student supervisors have.” Roger 
wondered what the cashier meant by this 
statement. What does Drew have to deal with 
and what problems do the student supervi￾sors really have to deal with? Thus far, he had 
noted that the operation appeared effective, 
although some communication problems 
were evident.
The cashier, seeing Drew passing by, stopped 
him and asked him for more change and small 
bills. Roger asked if it was standard procedure 
for her to ask managers for more money, or if 
she was able to get it herself. She replied she 
is authorized to get cash, but it is difficult for 
her to leave her station.
While the cashier was waiting for Drew to 
return, Roger asked her about work condi￾tions. The cashier replied:
I get cold in the winter because I’m so close 
to the entrance and the wind blows in. It’s 
ironic because the rest of the workers com￾plain about it being too hot at their stations. 
Peppercorn is built over heating ducts, so it’s 
very hot everywhere except at my station. 
People’s biggest complaint is the heat. There 
isn’t adequate ventilation or air flow. Another 
common complaint is that there’s not enough 
room in the dining, kitchen, and service 
areas. This is because Peppercorn used to be 
a riding stable.
In the winter I get sick easily, but I only miss 
about five days per year. I’ve learned to live 
with not feeling well on the job. I have a 
sore back every night because I set on a bar 
stool all day.
Before Roger could inquire if she had ever 
talked to management about her work condi￾tions, she stated, “I’m the only cashier. I have 
to call on the secretary when it’s really busy, 
but I know she has a lot of work to do. I also 
restock silverware. This entails shutting down 
the register, running to the dish room, and 
then restocking before the register line gets 
too long. Our job descriptions say that if some￾one sees something that needs doing, they are 
supposed to do it. Therefore, during slow peri￾ods I help clean tables, do the menu board, 
and look around for other things to do.”
Roger asked the cashier about her plans for 
the future, and she explained she would like 
to have a secretarial job so she could get away 
from food service for a while. The cashier 
went on to say there are temps and students 
that make more money than she does as a 
full-timer and this disparity makes her resent￾ful. The wages seem to be based on job posi￾tion or union membership. Only four positions 
are nonunion. These positions include the 
cashier, secretary, supervisor, and manager. 
The rest of the workers at Peppercorn are 
temporary, union members, or students. The 
cashier added there are only five single people 
on the staff.
When Roger asked the cashier about the rela￾tionship between student and full-time work￾ers, she replied there is a lot of pressure in the 
dish room. She believes the pressure builds up 
because the student supervisors never send 
student workers in to help. The supervisors’ 
excuse is that they are short of help elsewhere. 
Drew returned with the cash, and Roger went 
to see if he could find his partners.
Administrative Information
Roger found Lynn and Erica sitting in the dining 
area. Erica was telling Lynn she had arranged 
for them to have dinner with some students 
that evening. Roger sat down with his partners SELECTED CASES 227
and asked Erica if she could clarify some details 
about the organizational structure.
Erica responded, “There are three tiers of 
management at Peppercorn (Exhibit 3). There 
is the professional management staff, which 
consists of Drew and Larry. They oversee the 
full-time workers. There are also student man￾agers and student supervisors. The student 
managers oversee student supervisors as well 
as the student workers. The student supervi￾sors are responsible for daily operations. The 
student workers and the temporary employees 
report to them. It seems, however, that the 
temporary workers also report to, and are 
trained by, the professional managers.”
Roger and Lynn interjected that they had 
noticed difficulties between the students and 
the other workers at Peppercorn. Lynn asked 
Erica if she would clarify the distinction between 
the different levels of employees. Erica clarified 
the organizational structure stating:
There are full-time union employees, full￾time nonunion temporary employees, and 
student labor. Full-time employees hold the 
positions of cooks, short order chefs, pantry 
workers, and cashiers. In past years, students 
filled all the other supplementary positions, 
including dishwashers, servers, cooks, help￾ers, short order helpers, pantry helpers, bever￾age servers, and serving area floaters. For the 
past four to five years, fewer students have 
wanted jobs at Peppercorn. This phenomena 
has resulted in the addition of the third type 
of employee, the full-time temporary worker.
Erica went on to tell her partners that she had 
gathered enough information to update them 
on the key players at All-American Dining.

She explained that Larry Pendleton is the new 
professional supervisor, replacing Matt Cop￾perfield at Peppercorn. In the central office, 
Nancy Lawrence is still the director of All￾American Dining (Exhibit 4). She has been 
spending a great deal of time traveling to dif￾ferent universities in order to analyze their 
food service operations. Stan O’Malley is still 
an assistant director of All-American Dining. 
Although there is a central office, each unit is 
independently operated.
Roger asked Erica is she had the opportunity 
to speak with any employees and if she had 
been able to uncover any information about 
management-employee relations. Erica told 
her partners she had spoken with John 
Cerrano and some of the pantry workers.
Erica went on to say she and John spoke about 
changes that had occurred at Peppercorn 
since she had left. John told Erica the lack of 
student help has hurt operations at the unit. 
For example, a special dining event that Pep￾percorn sponsored last night was difficult for 
the workers. There were virtually no students 
on the staff. As a result, the full-time workers 
and temps had to pick up the slack.
John also commented that Larry doesn’t listen 
to his advice about ordering food. John spends 
a lot of his time getting food items that should 
have come in from the suppliers from the other 
units on campus. According to John, Larry 
doesn’t have the respect of the staff. He doesn’t 
take anyone’s advice and acts like a know- it￾all. The situation is made worse because Larry 
doesn’t do his job very well.
Erica went on to discuss the pantry workers 
stating:
The workers seemed to indicate a general 
belief that the management of AIl-American 
Dining, as well as the management at Pep￾percorn, doesn’t really care about them. 
They mentioned how All-American’s previ￾ous personnel director used to visit the dif￾ferent dining units at least once a month and 
talk with the full-time employees. During 
that time, the workers felt that someone 
cared about them. They said that the new 
personnel director doesn’t come around at 
all and probably doesn’t even know who the 
full-time employees are.
The workers also told me that there is mini￾mal union representation for food service 
employees. According to the workers, food 
service members are a minority faction of the 
union and aren’t considered important unless 
a strike is in progress. Apparently, the union’s 
primary concern is with maintenance work￾ers, groundskeepers, janitors, and bus drivers. 
There’s no shop steward and union officials 
don’t come to Peppercorn unless there is an 
official grievance.
Lynn added that Doug had also commented 
on the union. She stated, “Based on what we 
have heard so far, no one is thrilled with the 
union. Workers and management alike seem 
to find the union a burden.”
Roger asked Erica about how each unit on the 
campus was staffed. Erica explained that the 
units were independently staffed and at the 
beginning of each semester, the different units 
held recruitment campaigns.
Erica became quite excited as she stated, “OK, 
enough of the routine stuff. One thing that I 
found out today is that the university is build￾ing a new 400-seat dining facility. Also, a pri￾vately funded food service operation that will 
include a variety of dining concepts is opening 
nearby. Of course, these things will impact 
Peppercorn, but the scoop is that Drew will be 
the manager of the new facility!”
Erica, acting quite pleased, sat back, smiled, 
and waited for her partners to respond. Lynn 
paused only for a moment and then, turning 
to Erica, said, “This isn’t making much sense, 
but, before I ask the obvious, why don’t you 
tell us the rest of the facts?”
Erica, a little disappointed at the response her 
comment evoked, went on to explain that 
Drew would be leaving Peppercorn in about 
five months and that Eric Weston, the current 
vending manager, would take charge of the 
unit as soon as Drew left.229 SELECTED CASES Department of Dining Services [Exhibit 4] Assistant Director Dining Services Assistant Director Dining Services Assistant Director Dining Services Assistant Director Adminstrative Services Systems Purchasing Manager Personnel Manager Accounting Supervisor Catering Supervisor Catering Manager Vending Manager Esprit Operations Manager Catacombs Manager Baker Hall Supervisor Peppercorn Supervisor Peppercorn/ Salt Mill Manager Salt Mill Supervisor Baker/Roberts Manager Roberts Hall Supervisor Nachos Operations Manager Executive Dietitian Chef Chef Chef Assistant Chef Catering Supervisor Nickles/ Short Stop Supervisor Supervisor Supervisor Supervisor Supervisor Supervisor Journey’s End Supervisor Supervisor Supervisor Supervisor Supervisor Meal Plan Coordinator Student Unions Operations Manager Director230 PART 2 The Process of Organisation Development
As Lynn and Erica began to engage in an 
intense discussion about the future of Pepper￾corn dining, Roger, in true form, looked at 
his watch and stated, “Well, not only do we 
have a contract, we also have a dinner 
engagement in 20 minutes. Let’s get some 
fresh air before we meet with the students!” 
The partners began laughing and, recogniz￾ing the sanity of Roger’s comment, decided a 
break was in order.
Dinner with Student Managers
After freshening up, the trio returned to 
Peppercorn to meet the students for dinner. 
Molly, the student coordinator, and Shaun, the 
student personnel manager, were waiting for 
the consultants at Peppercorn’s main entrance. 
The five of them went through the cafeteria 
line and then entered the dining room, where 
they found a quiet table to have their dinner.
Shaun seemed to know why the consultants 
had asked them to dinner and began to tell 
them about his tenure at Peppercorn. Shaun 
explained that when he had started at Pep￾percorn four years ago, there were two to 
three times the number of student workers. He 
went on to say more students made the work 
fun and the operation ran more efficiently. 
Shaun explained it is hard for the students 
who have been at Peppercorn for a long time 
because they know how it used to be.
Molly agreed with Shaun, saying students 
would work at Peppercorn because it had a 
reputation for being social. “To attract student 
workers,” Molly said, “Peppercorn must 
become special, more conducive to meeting 
students’ needs. In the early days, students 
were proud to be Peppies and looked forward 
to seeing their co-workers.” She proceeded to 
say they have to treat students well because 
they can’t risk alienating anyone. They can’t 
afford to fire students or give them too many 
warnings.
Erica asked the students to comment on work￾ing with the temporary workers. Shaun said, 
“The temp-student relationship is not great. 
Temps are under the student supervisors’ 
authority, but it doesn’t really work that way. 
Temps are less efficient than students, but they 
are needed to fill the vacant positions. They 
are probably not as efficient because they have 
less loyalty to Peppercorn than the students.”
Molly interjected, “This year, no students and 
temps work in the same areas except for 
emergencies. Temps are trained by the profes￾sional management but are supervised by 
students. Last year, it was unclear who was in 
charge of the temps. This year it is better. 
Most things are written in manuals.
“The regular and temporary workers don’t 
talk much to the students,” continued Molly. 
“Temps and full-timers think students are 
stupid; they have an attitude toward students. 
It’s hard for the students to get cooperation 
and respect from the temps.”
Lynn asked the students about their relation￾ships with Drew. Shaun and Molly explained 
that while most students don’t interact with 
Drew frequently, they, as supervisors, meet 
with him regularly. Most of the students think 
Drew is rude and cold and unapproachable, 
but they have found he can be very patient. 
Additionally, many students don’t believe 
Drew is knowledgeable about food service 
operations. Molly and Shaun have discovered 
that he is, in fact, an astute person. They 
attributed his reputation to a lack of accessi￾bility, noting that Drew is generally more 
accessible to the full-time and temporary 
workers than to the students.
Lynn further inquired about the students’ reac￾tions to the forthcoming management changes. 
Molly replied, “Since most of the students 
don’t work closely with Drew, we really can’t 
foresee the change having much of an effect on 
them. Most students don’t have any precon￾ceived ideas about the new management.”
Shaun disagreed with Molly stating, “It’s going 
to be hard for a new manager to come in mid￾year. The transition will cause problems since the 
new manager won’t have the experience. I think 
that the new manager should change things SELECTED CASES 231
quickly. New student workers are recruited by 
us in the spring and meet their supervisors when 
they begin working in the fall. They immediately 
have some respect for their supervisor. I think 
that the new manager will be in a bind.”
Molly said she believed the change would 
have a greater effect on the full-time and tem￾porary workers than on the students. She has 
heard some workers mention they are con￾cerned because Peppercorn’s future is unclear. 
Many of the full-time workers are loyal to 
Drew; they have become comfortable with his 
management style.
Roger, addressing Molly, asked about com￾munication at Peppercorn. Molly responded:
Communication has been a major problem. 
The students thought that if they left me 
notes, things would get done. I would 
take the notes to management, but impor￾tant things were not noted as being impor￾tant. Mostly, the problems were repair and 
maintenance issues. People brooded that 
things didn’t get done quickly. They didn’t 
realize that most things have to go through a 
lot of channels, which takes time. There is so 
much paperwork involved. Now the stu￾dents make special notations when issues 
are urgent so that I can establish priorities.
An area that is related to communication is 
ordering. There are a lot of problems with 
Larry. Last year, we had a problem with the 
person who filled a similar job but the job 
description has changed. Last year, the kitchen 
workers were getting burnt out. Larry revised 
the menus and for a while the kitchen seemed 
better. Larry just doesn’t do his job well 
and we constantly run out of things.
Roger asked about the student pay structure 
at Peppercorn. Molly told him the pay rate 
has been changed twice. The effect is that 
workers are kept on the same pay grade 
because the raises push people back to level 
one. The only workers who benefit from the 
changes are the student managers.
Shaun noted that one of the most frustrating 
situations at Peppercorn was the lack of student 
interest, something that could not be con￾trolled. Even when the wages were raised, no 
one applied for jobs. Shaun added that the stu￾dent supervisors are upset about paying for 
their meal plan tickets because many of them 
worked their way through school.
It was getting late and the students had to attend 
classes the next morning. The consultants 
thanked the students for being so candid with 
them. After the students left, the consultants 
discussed their impressions of Peppercorn.
Roger commented that their earlier concerns 
about the willingness of employees to speak 
with them were unfounded. Lynn agreed, 
noting that although most of the workers 
seemed to be quite open, Doug was an excep￾tion. He was eager to talk, but the discussion 
seemed contrived. He seemed to be conveying 
information that he thought she should know 
and was careful to portray himself and the 
operation in a favorable light. Lynn said 
she thought he was concerned about possible 
repercussions from his responses.
Lynn went on to recount the interactions she 
had observed earlier in the day between Larry, 
Doug, and the student supervisor. She then 
commented, “Larry is an interesting player. All 
of the workers mention him. He seems to have 
a lot of power over the other workers, yet 
he seems to govern by fear. The workers become 
timid in his presence, nonetheless, they don’t 
appear to have much respect for him.”
Picking up on Lynn’s train of thought, Roger 
noted that in his conversations and observations 
throughout the day, he had begun to wonder 
about the social system at the unit. He com￾mented, “Although the organization was highly 
stratified, operations still seem to run smoothly. 
While workers may be timid around Larry and 
even fear Drew, the fact that operations are 
smooth and that the workers appear to be loyal 
indicates that personality conflicts and role 
ambiguity are symptoms of a larger problem.”
“That’s true,” said Erica. “The unit always had 
a reputation for being a social environment. In 
the past, we were able to overlook personality 
and role conflicts because there was a strong 
culture at the unit.”232 PART 2 The Process of Organisation Development
Noticing that the cleaning crew was beginning 
to break down the dining room, the partners 
decided to call it a night.
DAY TWO: INTERVIEWS 
AND OBSERVATIONS
Erica arrived at the dining hall at 10:30 A.M. As 
she climbed the stairs beside the loading dock, 
she noticed a worker was in the car wash, 
hosing down the trash cans. As she entered 
the kitchen, Erica spotted Drew helping out in 
the pantry. They greeted each other cordially 
and chatted for a few minutes. Drew, taking 
off his lab coat, said he was due at a meeting 
on the other side of the campus.
Erica left the kitchen and went into the office to 
gather more information on the structure and 
operations of Peppercorn. When she entered 
through the open office door, she found Larry 
working at the computer, placing orders with 
the central purchasing system. Larry explained 
to Erica that the computer system had not been 
working properly. It is supposed to generate 
order lists and inventories based on the menus 
that he inputs. He indicated, however, there 
must be some problem with the system because 
the orders are not coming in, and when they 
do, they frequently are late. After providing 
Erica with some literature such as employee 
handbooks, Larry suggested she talk to Patricia, 
the secretary at the main office.
Erica followed Larry’s suggestion and on her 
way out of the unit she met Roger. She 
explained she was planning to visit the main 
office and said she would meet her partners in 
the late afternoon to discuss her findings.
Roger wandered around the unit for over an 
hour, observing the lunch service. During the 
first hour, the cafeteria was packed with 
customers. Roger noticed the student supervi￾sors were busy refilling the salad and beverage 
stations. Shaun helped by restocking glasses 
and trays. The cafeteria line became long and 
at one point, Drew, having returned from his 
meeting, helped serve food. Roger noted that 
by the end of the lunch period, the cafeteria 
was short on silverware.
As the lunch service slowed, Roger decided to 
take a look at the student office. As he entered 
the downstairs dining room, he immediately 
noticed it was very hot, that a large percent￾age of the tables were dirty, and that many of 
the light bulbs in the dining room needed 
replacement. Roger located the student office 
and what appeared to be a small gathering or 
meeting area.
From the open office doorway, Roger could 
see a bank of time cards on the wall. Roger 
also noted the office contained a suggestion 
box. As he peered in the door, he was greeted 
by the sound of a woman’s voice. Roger 
entered and introduced himself. In response, 
the woman identified herself as Sarah Lange. 
Roger asked Sarah if she would be willing to 
discuss her work experiences at Peppercorn.
Sarah began by saying she had worked at 
Peppercorn for three years and had been a 
student supervisor two years. Sarah stated, 
“Working at Peppercorn is not as much fun as 
it used to be. Although the job was never easy, 
it has become increasingly difficult. As super￾visors, we don’t really manage any more, and 
the upper-level student managers like Shaun 
don’t work and don’t care. He won’t even 
help out when we are short staffed.”
Sarah described an incident when Naomi, 
another student supervisor, was working a 
snack shift that was understaffed. Shaun, aware 
of the problem, stayed downstairs at his desk. 
When Naomi went downstairs to ask him for 
help, he acted ambivalent. Shaun finally helped 
in the dining room for about 20 minutes.
“In contrast to Shaun,” Sarah commented, 
“Molly is willing to pitch in when we are short 
staffed, but this has caused her to become 
burnt out. Molly has a hard time dealing with 
problems that arise among the student super￾visors. A few days ago, she called a meeting 
and told us there was a new policy restricting 
the snacks that we were allowed to eat. She 
also told us that we were scheduled to work on SELECTED CASES 233
special dining programs, which are always at 
dinnertime. The whole time that Molly spoke 
with us, she was really curt and acted like she 
was annoyed. We don’t even have a student 
rep to complain to anymore. At least Molly is 
leaving at the end of the school year.”
Sarah said that although she is not very happy 
working at Peppercorn, she does not want to 
quit. She has loyalty to both her fellow workers 
and to the unit. Sarah said she would definitely 
quit if some of her friends, who are also supervi￾sors at Peppercorn, stopped working at the unit.
Roger thanked Sarah for talking with him and 
wished her luck in the future. As he walked 
up the stairs to the service area, Roger made a 
mental note to talk to his partners about 
information flow and to further discuss coali￾tions within the unit.
While Roger had been observing service, Lynn, 
who arrived at 12:30, had entered the unit 
from the loading dock. Hoping the workers 
would be less self-conscious if she was unde￾tected, Lynn quietly observed operations for 
almost an hour. During that time, Lynn noticed 
the steam kettles were draining, and much like 
the previous day, the kitchen workers appeared 
unhurried but attentive to their tasks. The 
manner in which they worked seemed highly 
professional and reflective of the long years 
the employees had worked together.
When Doug finally noticed Lynn, he greeted 
her warmly and began to chat with her. As 
Doug and Lynn were talking, a man who 
Doug said was a short-order cook walked 
through the kitchen. He stopped and stared at 
Lynn for a moment and then asked, “Are you 
with the health department or the union?” 
Lynn introduced herself and explained the 
nature of her project. The man stared at her 
again briefly and then walked away.
Doug excused himself and Lynn, left to her 
thoughts, wondered if the man had accurately 
stated the paranoia she had perceived in Doug 
the previous day. Doug returned a few minutes 
later with a cup of soup and offered it to Lynn, 
saying he thought she should have the oppor￾tunity to taste Peppercorn’s good food. As 
Lynn was finishing the soup, she saw two 
students walk through the kitchen carrying 
tacos. They proceeded to the loading dock and 
began to eat their meal. Lynn, wanting some 
fresh air, went out to the dock and began to 
converse with the students.
The students told Lynn they had worked at 
Peppercorn for three years. One of the stu￾dents said, “Peppercorn used to be a better 
place to work. We used to have more students 
working here. The unit always used to be 
cheerful, and they used to buy beer and have 
parties on Friday nights.”
Lynn asked what had caused the situation to 
change and the second student replied, “Drew 
is much tighter about things. The manage￾ment is only concerned about customers and 
not about workers. When I first started work￾ing here, we had to mop the floor, but there 
were a lot of students so it was more fun. 
Then they didn’t make us mop any more. 
Now we have to mop again, but there is not 
as much camaraderie among the workers.”
The worker continued, “What makes the situ￾ation worse is that we can’t even mop properly 
because we are always short of supplies. We 
haven’t had any bleach for a week.”
Doug came out to the loading dock and said he 
was going on break. He wanted the students to 
come inside so he could give them instructions 
before he left. Doug told the students that 
because there was not much work to be done, 
they could work at a slow pace or even sweep 
the floor so they could work their full shift.
Lynn followed Doug and the students back into 
the kitchen. Bob and Robert were finishing the 
lunch cleanup, and Chris was looking at the 
dinner menu while eating a snack. When Chris 
saw Lynn standing alone, he approached her 
and immediately began to tell her about his 
work experiences and views of Peppercorn.
Chris told Lynn he likes working at Peppercorn. 
In the same breath, he said he had recently 234 PART 2 The Process of Organisation Development
seen ads for positions at a hotel and plans on 
applying for jobs. Chris said, “I think the food 
service industry is hard. We’re always work￾ing when other people are off, and it’s hard to 
get good financial compensation.”
Chris went on to explain that the manage￾ment at Peppercorn does not give the kitchen 
staff feedback. He believes this is because man￾agement does not eat at Peppercorn often. He 
also said the management is very cost oriented 
and won’t bring in the best quality products.
Chris went on to state:
Dining used to pay for us to attend profes￾sional culinary classes. Now they don’t want 
to spend the money, so they present lectures 
by campus chefs. It doesn’t accomplish much 
since we are usually taught things that we 
already know how to make or things that 
are not within the budget constraints. It 
doesn’t make sense that they are willing to 
shell out bucks for things like unit specials 
and management classes and not spend any 
money on us.
It’s hard to get new recipes on the menu. I’ve 
tried, but I’m usually met with resistance. I 
guess that in large quantities they can’t 
afford mistakes. Once, they let us try to test 
market a new recipe by putting out small 
chaffing dishes in the meal plan dining room 
and then asking students for comments on 
the product. It worked out fairly well and 
we’ve used the recipe several times.
As Lynn was wondering about Drew’s com￾ment on being a participatory manager, Erica 
entered the kitchen and came over to tell her 
she was able to gather some information from 
the main office. Lynn thanked Chris for 
speaking with her, and she and Erica went 
into the service area to find Roger. Roger was 
chatting with some customers near the salad 
bar. When he saw his partners approaching, 
he concluded his conversation.
The consultants each purchased a beverage 
and on their way to the dining room, Roger 
told his partners that customers generally 
had a favorable impression of Peppercorn. 
They like the food but thought the service 
was too slow. The only other comment the 
customers made was that the dining areas 
were too warm. Erica added that when she 
had worked at Peppercorn there were rarely 
any complaints about the food, but they 
constantly received negative feedback about 
the heat.
After the consultants were seated, Roger asked 
Erica what she was able to discover about the 
structure of the All-American Dining organi￾zation. Erica showed her partners copies of 
the organizational chart, mission statement 
(Exhibit 5), and goals and objectives (Exhibit 6). 
Erica went on to describe a few of the things 
she had discovered that day. For example, 
menu and staffing changes had to be approved

by the central office. She also found out that 
managers are frequently transferred between 
units.
Erica then asked her partners what their 
thoughts were on the structure of All￾American Dining and what effect it had at the 
unit level. Roger suggested that from the 
information that Erica had gathered, the orga￾nization seemed highly centralized. However, 
workers at the unit level are interested in 
making their own decisions. He added that 
the structure of the organization could be 
contributing to the problems that Drew per￾ceived with productivity and morale.
Lynn, looking over the mission and goal 
statements that Erica had collected, commented, 
“All-American professes to be decentralized. 
Also, Drew believes he is a participatory 
manager. It seems as if this organ ization doesn’t 
play by its own rules. I haven’t seen any indica￾tion of participation, let alone adequate com￾munication between management and line 
employees.”
The consultants continued to talk for a while 
about the tension they had noticed at the 
unit. Since Drew was leaving, they wondered 
if their presence at the unit would have any 
affect and if the feedback session would 
really serve its purpose. The consultants 
decided they would spend several hours the 
following morning reviewing the information 
they had gathered. In order to facilitate their 
meeting, they quickly constructed
a partial list of the individuals they had 
encountered during their observations. This 
list included characteristics the consultants 
believed might be important to their analysis 
(Exhibit 7).
As the consultants sat at the table, several of 
the employees came over to speak with them. 
The workers seemed relaxed and joked with 
the consultants. Doug commented he was 
working on putting his résumé together, and 
Chris told the partners about some new reci￾pes he was developing. The pantry workers 
and dish room workers made small talk until 
the consultants said they had to depart. Roger, 
Lynn, and Erica thanked the workers for 
being so cooperative and said they hoped to 
see them sometime soon.
Questions
How effective was the OD consultants’ data 
gathering? The content of the data? The 
process of how the data were collected?
What concepts or models might help 
you analyze the data? What conclusions 
would you draw from the analysis?
How should the feedback session be 
designed?

Sunflower Incorporated is a large distribution 
company with over 5,000 employees and gross 
sales of over $700 million (1991). The com￾pany purchases and distributes salty snack 
foods and liquor to independent retail stores 
throughout the United States and Canada. 
Salty snack foods include corn chips, potato 
chips, cheese curls, tortilla chips, and peanuts. 
The United States and Canada are divided into 
22 regions, each with its own central ware￾house, salespeople, finance department, and 
purchasing department. The company distrib￾utes national as well as local brands and pack￾ages some items under private labels. The head 
office encourages each region to be autono￾mous because of local tastes and practices. The 
northeast United States, for example, con￾sumes a greater percentage of Canadian whisky 
and American bourbon, while the West con￾sumes more light liquors, such as vodka, gin, 
and rum. Snack foods in the Southwest are 
often seasoned to reflect Mexican tastes.
Early in 1989, Sunflower began using a finan￾cial reporting system that compared sales, 
costs, and profits across regions. Management 
was surprised to learn that profits varied 
widely. By 1990, the differences were so great 
that management decided some standardiza￾tion was necessary. They believed that highly 
profitable regions were sometimes using 
lower-quality items, even seconds, to boost 
profit margins. This practice could hurt Sun￾flower’s image. Other regions were facing 
intense price competition in order to hold 
market share. National distributors were 
pushing hard to increase their market share. 
Frito-lay, Bordens, Nabisco, Procter & Gamble 
(Pringles), and Standard Brands (Planter’s 
peanuts) were pushing hard to increase mar￾ket share by cutting prices and launching new 
products.
As these problems accumulated, Mr. Steelman, 
president of Sunflower, decided to create a 
new position to monitor pricing and pur￾chasing practices. Agnes Albanese was hired 
from the finance department of a competing 
organi zation. Her new title was director of 
pricing and purchasing, and she reported to 
the vice president of finance, Mr. Mobley. 
Steelman and Mobley gave Albanese great 
latitude in organizing her job and encour￾aged her to establish whatever rules and 
procedures were necessary. She was also 
encouraged to gather information from each 
region. Each region was notified of her 
appointment by an official memo sent to the 
regional managers. A copy of the memo was 
posted on each warehouse bulletin board. 
The announcement was also made in the 
company newspaper.
After three weeks on the job, Albanese decided 
that pricing and purchasing decisions should 
be standardized across regions. As a first step, 
she wanted the financial executive in each 
region to notify her of any change in local 
prices of more than 3%. She also decided that 
all new contracts for local purchases of more 
than $5,000 should be cleared through her 
office. (Approximately 60% of items distrib￾uted in the regions was purchased in large 
quantities and supplied from the home office. 
The other 40% was purchased and distributed 
within the region.) Albanese believed that the 
only way to standardize operations was for 
each region to notify the home office in 
advance of any change in prices or purchases. 
Albanese discussed the proposed policy with 
Mobley. He agreed, so they submitted a for￾mal proposal to the president and board of 
directors, who approved the plan. Sunflower 
was moving into the peak holiday season, so 
Albanese wanted to implement the new pro￾cedures right away. She decided to send an 
email to the financial and purchasing execu￾tives in each region notifying them of the new 
procedures. The change would be inserted in 
Sunflower Incorporated240 PART 2 The Process of Organisation Development
all policy and procedure manuals throughout 
Sunflower within four months.
Albanese showed a draft of the email to 
Mobley and invited his comments. Mobley 
said the Internet was an excellent idea but 
wondered if it was sufficient. The regions 
handle hundreds of items and were used to 
decentralized decision making. Mobley sug￾gested that Albanese ought to visit the regions 
and discuss purchasing and pricing policies 
with the executives. Albanese refused, saying 
that the trips would be expensive and time￾consuming. She had so many things to do at 
headquarters that a trip was impossible. 
Mobley also suggested waiting to implement 
the procedures until after the annual com￾pany meeting in three months. Albanese said 
this would take too long because the proce￾dures would not take effect until after the 
peak sales season. She believed the proce￾dures were needed now. The email went out 
the next day.
During the next few days, replies came in 
from most of the regions. The executives were 
in agreement with the email and said they 
would be happy to cooperate.
Eight weeks later, Albanese had not received 
notices from any regions about local price or 
purchase changes. Other executives who had 
visited regional warehouses indicated to her 
that the regions were busy as usual. Regional 
executives seemed to be following usual pro￾cedures for that time of year.
Questions
1. How well did Albanese manage the pric￾ing and purchasing changes at Sunflower? 
Were the changes implemented success￾fully? How would you find this out?
2. What might Albanese have done differ￾ently? What should she do now?

Information management has become a criti￾cal competency in modern high-technology 
firms. These companies simply cannot afford 
to waste time reinventing or re-justifying 
existing methodologies, and costly errors—
even injuries—can result from not having and 
following appropriate operating procedures. 
Yet, the burgeoning quantity of data, informa￾tion, and knowledge that must be retrieved 
and used has begun to tax some companies’ 
abilities to keep up. In addition, many of the 
people within these organizations are not 
trained properly or willing to deal with formal 
information systems.
You are Roberta Jackson, a concerned, experi￾enced first-level project manager working at 
the headquarters site of the manufacturing 
and distribution division (M&DDiv) of 
PolyProd, a corporation that develops, markets, 
and manufactures a variety of high technology 
products for industry and home use. You are 
convinced, based on your experience and 
some informal information that you have col￾lected, that failing to improve the current 
information management practices will cost 
PolyProd millions of dollars in direct expenses 
and could contribute to long-term market 
share declines in PolyProd products. As a 
result, you believe that it is necessary to 
change M&DDiv’s documentation processes 
and procedures. These processes govern the 
creation and use of the specifications and for￾mal procedures required by the manufacturing 
organization.
You anticipate that the undertaking will involve 
change and project management techniques 
traditional in large engineering firms, and that 
it should proceed along well-trodden paths: 
you will plan the project, “sell” it to manage￾ment and obtain the authority to begin, and 
then allocate resources and monitor progress 
until you can declare victory. The following 
sections describe the M&DDiv’s organization, 
the documentation system, and other factors 
contributing to the current situation.
THE M&DDIV ORGANIZATION 
AND CULTURE
M&DDiv manufactures and distributes a small 
but lucrative subset of PolyProd’s products 
and has five locations around the world. The 
headquarters organization is located in the 
United States. It centrally manages the other 
four sites in Canada, Asia, Africa, and Europe, 
but also allows them a lot of autonomy in 
decision-making. Each location houses both 
manufacturing and distribution processes.
The variety and complexity of M&DDiv’s prod￾ucts have increased markedly, as have the 
speed, intricacy, and expense of the unique 
high-volume automated manufacturing pro￾cesses that produce the products. As a result, 
M&DDiv has been growing rapidly during its 
entire 11-year history, experiencing exponen￾tial increases in locations, sales, capital equip￾ment, product lines, and personnel. Support 
systems, such as the information and knowl￾edge management system, have struggled to 
keep up with the growth. Moreover, the 
required hiring of many inexperienced or tem￾porary personnel has stretched the ability of 
M&DDiv to maintain the culture of PolyProd. 
These trends are expected to continue unabated 
for the foreseeable future.
The company’s business strategy charters the 
headquarters site with designing products and 
their manufacturing methodologies, and then 
with transferring the maturing manufacturing 
processes offshore to take advantage of the 
lower tax rates and cheaper labor at the four 
production locations. The key success factors 
Initiating Change in the Manufacturing 
and Distribution Division of PolyProd242 PART 2 The Process of Organisation Development
for the headquarters site are rapid design inno￾vation and time-to-volume-manufacturability. 
The priorities of the production sites are 
shippable-product volume, quality, and cost￾effectiveness.
Over the last several years, the friction devel￾oping between headquarters and the other 
locations has been increasing. The sites are 
generally dissatisfied with what they regard as 
a patronizing and demanding attitude, and 
resent policies and assignments unilaterally 
sent out by headquarters. Headquarters, in 
turn, resents the fierce and sometimes unnec￾essary individualism of the other locations. 
Throughout M&DDiv, there is a subtle but 
strong resistance to large-scale or externally 
initiated change. This is especially true when 
the change involves converging all sites to a 
single process or technology. Much of this is 
due to the pressures of maintaining high pro￾duction levels; unproven change is simply too 
risky. Historically, any attempt to institute a 
change by dictate has been doomed to failure. 
For example, announced changes typically 
take three to five years to institutionalize, and 
even after that time, there is considerable 
residual resistance or malicious compliance. 
It is not uncommon for otherwise successful 
projects to wither and die due to lack of imple￾mentation support.
Headquarters has its own internal issues. 
First, it has a long-standing tradition of con￾servatism and hardened reluctance to change. 
Second, it is still reeling from the rapid growth 
that has transformed it from a small, indepen￾dent factory into the hub of a global business. 
Finally, it is suffering from a discontinuity in 
its own cultural history: Rapid hiring and 
promotion, insufficient mentoring, heavy 
outsourcing and downsizing of certain com￾petencies, and extensive use of a temporary 
workforce in non-engineering areas has put 
extreme pressures on the once homogenous 
and intensely loyal culture.
In a static and stable environment, the rela￾tionship between headquarters and the other 
locations might be considered an acceptable 
cost of doing business. In M&DDiv, however, 
the stakes are far too high to allow it to con￾tinue. The anticipated continued growth will 
magnify all problems exponentially, and the 
seriousness of the problems could very well 
inhibit or halt that growth. Because M&DDiv’s 
revenue represents a significant portion of 
PolyProd’s bottom line, much of PolyProd’s 
total growth is contingent on M&DDiv’s con￾tinued expansion. If M&DDiv falters, PolyProd 
could well follow.
THE DOCUMENTATION PROBLEM
In PolyProd, quality is everything. The com￾pany simply cannot allow bad products to 
reach the customer, but neither can it afford 
to scrap good products that may have failed 
too-stringent tests. The precision high- volume 
manufacturing processes used by all M&DDiv 
sites utilize rigorous quality control proce￾dures to ensure the highest yield of good 
products and the lowest scrap. This is achieved 
by statistical analyses of interim results and 
by standardizing tasks and tooling as much as 
possible. This, in turn, hinges on a huge 
quantity of documentation, including mate￾rial and process specifications, operating 
instructions, maintenance information, repli￾cation data (bills of materials, assembly and 
checkout instructions, etc.), and the like. In 
summary, good products require either good 
documentation or expensive workarounds 
and corrections.
• The documentation system. The documentation 
“system” consists of a number of compo￾nents: an electronic “vault” where a vari￾ety of documents are kept, the computer 
systems and networks that allow access to 
the vault, the documents (electronic files) 
themselves, the protocols for routing and 
approving revisions, and perhaps most criti￾cal and most dangerous, all of the people 
who interact with these components. To be 
effective, a documentation system has to 
be carefully developed, actively maintained, SELECTED CASES 243
and closely protected from inappropriate 
alteration. Since products and their produc￾tion equipment migrate between sites, the 
documentation must also be portable and 
useable without extensive revision.
When a new product design is initiated, 
a suite of drawings and other specifications 
is created immediately and remains with 
the project for its whole life. The design 
engineer’s early sketches and notes are 
entered into an electronic “vault” where 
they are protected against loss and inad￾vertent change. As experiments are done 
and prototypes are created, test results 
and design refinements are added to the 
vault. As the design moves into the pre￾manufacturing stage, parts lists, materials 
specifications, assembly instructions, test 
procedures, and quality criteria are added 
to the file. When the automated equip￾ment to produce the product in volume is 
designed, its information joins the prod￾uct’s information in the vault.
The vault provides functions other 
than safekeeping. Accessed through work￾stations throughout the site, the vault 
allows engineers to “sign out” documents 
for revision, printing, or on-line viewing. 
Every time a change is made, the vault’s 
software tracks the differences between 
the old and new versions, records who 
made the changes, and routes the revised 
documentation by e-mail through an 
approval team. Once approved, the revised 
document replaces the original version, 
which is then automatically archived to 
provide an audit trail. Throughout its life, 
a document may be entirely electronic and 
viewed only on-line, printed and bound, 
printed when needed and then discarded, 
or some combination of these media.
Virtually every department in the fac￾tory uses these documents. R&D designs 
the product, manufacturing engineer￾ing uses the product specifications to 
design production equipment, materials 
engineering uses the same specifications to 
select the plastics and metals used to make 
the product, materials procurement uses 
the materials engineering documents to 
order the supplies for the production line, 
capital purchasing uses the manufacturing 
engineering documents to get contracts 
for the production lines, technical writing 
groups use all of these documents to create 
user manuals and other printed materials 
to ship with the final product, and traffic 
combs through the data to estimate the 
number and types of shipping containers 
and vehicles that will be needed. When 
the product is actually manufactured, the 
production departments continuously 
refer to the documentation for instruc￾tions on how to operate, test, and repair 
their equipment; how to order and load 
raw materials into the machinery; how to 
test the products; and how to judge the 
product’s quality.
When headquarters prepares to send a 
product and its production equipment to 
one of the other locations, the documenta￾tion is supposed to be sent first. The docu￾mentation is used at the new location to 
train employees, to guide the preparation 
of the new facility, and to ensure that all of 
the supply chain components are in place 
to provide raw materials and outbound 
shipping. Much of the documentation is 
translated into the local language for use 
by semi-skilled production workers once 
the production line is running at the new 
location.
Every department at every location is 
both a consumer and a producer of docu￾mentation, and all are completely interde￾pendent. A single error in a specification 
can cascade into a multimillion dollar 
disaster in the form of incorrect raw mate￾rials, a product that passes tests but doesn’t 
work for the customer, a produc tion line 
that won’t fit inside the factory building, 
or a huge fine from US Customs for mis￾takenly exporting restricted technology.244 PART 2 The Process of Organisation Development
• The current situation. Various departments 
within M&DDiv have invested heavily 
in the human resources, tools, and time 
needed to create and maintain the docu￾mentation process. Despite this invest￾ment, M&DDiv’s documentation is still 
regarded as unsatisfactory by the major￾ity of employees and management. For 
example, there is widespread dissatisfac￾tion with the documentation system in 
the design departments at headquarters. 
Because of past bad experiences with out￾dated or incorrect documentation, users 
distrust all documentation’s accuracy, and 
find the vault hard to access. The quality 
department is distressed by the delays in 
the correction and update cycle. Technical 
writers are unhappy with the general 
usability of the required word processors, 
graphics programs, and the vault; they 
also feel artistically constrained when 
asked to use standard templates or designs 
for their documents. They get little coop￾eration from the subject matter experts 
and reviewers they rely on for informa￾tion, and feel that creating a finished 
document can take four to five times as 
much time and effort as it should take.
The headquarters document control 
supervisors and technical-writing super￾visors also are frustrated. Their personal 
workloads have ballooned to unmanage￾able levels as they added staff to keep 
up with the increasing documentation 
requirements of M&DDiv’s growing num￾ber of products. At the same time, they are 
permitted to hire only temporary resources; 
qualified candidates became increasingly 
hard to find, and they take everything 
they have learned away with them when 
their finite-length contracts end.
The production sites share all these 
concerns and have unique issues of their 
own. They are frustrated by their inabil￾ity to get correct and complete docu￾mentation when a manufacturing process 
transfers from headquarters, even though 
the documentation is supposed to arrive 
long before the manufacturing process. 
They often must convert unusual file for￾mats or struggle to rewrite United States￾idiomatic information to meet the needs 
of their local users. They also often feel 
that they need to invent their own docu￾ment designs because global designs are 
still pending or are too specific to another 
location’s needs.
CONTRIBUTING FACTORS
As your early interest in overcoming these 
problems increased, you conducted an informal 
analysis based on interviews and observations 
at all five locations. You have concluded that 
there are a number of interrelated causes pro￾ducing M&DDiv’s documentation problems.
The primary issue is the lack of an overriding 
vision or strategy to guide the creation of a full 
and robust documentation system. To be fair, 
several years ago, M&DDiv’s senior manage￾ment chartered a documentation quality effort. 
However, this was only partially implemented, 
and the project lost momentum after some 
early successes. This sent a signal—to both the 
headquarters site and the production loca￾tions—that documentation was not really so 
important after all, much to the relief of those 
who considered documentation-related tasks 
a distraction from their “real work.” As the 
rigor of document-creation and -maintenance 
rules began to wane, the quality of the docu￾ments and the processes they supported began 
to deteriorate again. This continuing gradual 
slide at each of the locations is exacerbated by 
the lack of coordination between them. 
Decisions are made independently, based on 
local or perceived larger-scope needs, or 
occasionally on policies that were developed 
during the short-lived documentation-quality 
project. Few people consider a time horizon 
farther out than one year, and even fewer 
look forward with a global perspective.SELECTED CASES 245
There are severe integration problems between 
the different locations. The production entities 
are concerned with document control and 
simplicity. Headquarters has difficulty in 
simply collecting the information in the first 
place, and with keeping it up-to-date and 
complete as the subject matter rapidly evolves 
during the design and tuning phases. 
Headquarters often uses the documentation as 
repositories of historical or justification infor￾mation; this serves only to confuse and annoy 
the production sites, which require only the 
minimum information necessary to manufac￾ture products.
There also are internal integration problems 
within each individual location. Responsibility 
for different aspects of the documentation falls 
within several organizations: creation and 
storage technology in one, the formal pro￾cesses for acquisition and control in another, 
best practice consulting in a third, and techni￾cal writers scattered throughout several other 
departments with their “customers” (e.g., 
some writers sit within R&D, some work with 
manufacturing engineering, and still others 
are in the quality department). There are no 
rewards for communicating or collaborating, 
and the groups frequently develop similar or 
conflicting solutions to what turn out to be 
common problems.
Day-to-day operation is also less than optimal. 
The majority of involved personnel have little 
or no training or experience in the field of 
documentation. This has led to quality prob￾lems, arbitrary decision-making, inappropri￾ate prioritizing of tasks and objectives, and 
several “blind alley” projects (i.e., projects that 
start successfully but then run into insur￾mountable barriers and are abandoned). Many 
writers and document controllers are former 
production line operators who show little 
interest or aptitude during times of high need. 
Few of the external temporary personnel 
have formal technical writing experience; 
most are recently graduated English majors or 
journalists. The technical writing supervisors 
all moved laterally from production, and 
received no special training or mentoring; this 
results in inefficiency and quality problems 
within their departments.
Generally, each of the problems and frus￾trations outlined above is restricted to the 
immediately affected departments. The vari￾ous symptoms are highly distributed, are 
frequently noticeable only at the lowest levels 
of the organization, and are often concealed 
beneath their effects. For example, raw mate￾rial rejection in the receiving department might 
increase without anyone questioning whether 
the inspection checklist itself was incorrect, 
or growing headcount in the support depart￾ment might not be linked with a particular 
manufacturing location’s use of an obsolete 
adjustment procedure. These problems would 
usually be examined by the immediate depart￾ment supervisor without regard to a larger 
context, and would seldom be escalated to a 
point of visibility to upper management or 
someone with a less parochial viewpoint.
Until you began talking with people at all sites, 
most people were aware only of their own dif￾ficulties with the documentation, and were 
surprised by your interest. You found that the 
overall sense of “shared pain” in the organiza￾tion was very low, and that upper management 
was completely unaware of the magnitude, 
frequency, and very real cost of the issues.
Aside from a few informal networks and 
councils, there are no worldwide activities 
working to resolve these problems from a sys￾tem perspective. Most of the separate organi￾zations do recognize the local aspects of the 
problems, and some have projects in place to 
improve their own processes in isolation. 
However, there is no movement toward a 
larger-scale solution.
It is clear that M&DDiv is in a state of uneasy 
stasis and that external stimulus—you—will 
be needed to begin a resolution.246 PART 2 The Process of Organisation Development
YOUR PLAN TO INITIATE CHANGE
You have decided to conduct an informal dis￾cussion with Stewart Jones, the M&DDiv 
executive you deem to be the most likely 
potential sponsor for the project, to get a pre￾liminary opinion on whether your project 
would be worth proposing formally. You have 
planned your approach carefully.
Because of the engineering-intense environ￾ment in M&DDiv, you know that you must 
follow a defined, rational project manage￾ment methodology—overt “touchy-feely” 
techniques would be rejected out of hand. 
However, you also understand that changing 
the documentation process will be equal parts 
cultural change and process improvement.
You also understand the dynamics of M&DDiv 
management: They seem powerless to force 
change upon the different geographical loca￾tions, and they also are unable and unwilling 
to spend much time attempting to reach a 
consensus on the need for standardizing any￾thing. “Going to the top” won’t help. Because 
you are dealing with many branches of a very 
large organization you must face a “Catch-22” 
situation: when you appeal up the organiza￾tion chart to a level that has the power to 
command all relevant organizations, that indi￾vidual is so removed from the problem that he 
or she is unwilling to consider it unless it has 
huge demonstrable impact.
Questions
1. What is your assessment of your (Roberta’s) 
efforts to date?
2. How will you convince Stewart Jones to 
allow you to proceed with the project? 
What arguments might you use?
3. Describe how you will develop a change 
process and the critical issues you will 
face in managing the change.

part 3Interpersonal and Group Process 
Approaches
This chapter discusses change programs relat￾ing to interpersonal relations and group dynam￾ics. These interventions are among the earliest 
ones devised in OD and the most popular. 
They represent attempts to improve people’s 
working relationships with one another. The 
interventions are aimed at helping members 
of groups assess their interactions and devise 
more effective ways of working. These change 
programs represent a basic skill requirement 
for an OD practitioner.
Interpersonal and group process approaches, 
including process consultation, third-party inter￾ventions, and team building, are among the most 
enduring OD interventions. Process consultation 
helps group members understand, diagnose, 
and improve their behaviors. Through process 
consultation, the group should become better 
able to use its own resources to identify and 
solve interpersonal problems that often block 
the solving of work-related problems. Third-party 
interventions focus directly on dysfunctional 
interpersonal conflict. This approach is used 
only in special circumstances and only when 
both parties are willing to engage in the process 
of direct confrontation. Team building is aimed 
both at helping a team perform its tasks bet￾ter and at satisfying individual needs. Through 
team- building activities, group goals and norms 
become clearer. In addition, team members 
become better able to confront difficulties and 
problems and to understand the roles of indi￾viduals within the team. Among the specialized 
team-building approaches presented are inter￾ventions with ongoing teams and temporary 
teams such as project teams and task forces.
PROCESS CONSULTATION
Process consultation (PC) is a general framework for carrying out helping relationships.1
Schein defines process consultation as “the creation of a relationship that permits the 
client to perceive, understand, and act on the process events that occur in [his or her] 
internal and external environment in order to improve the situation as defined by the 
client.”2
 The process consultant does not offer expert help in the form of solutions to 
problems, as in the doctor–patient model. Rather, the process consultant works to help 
managers, employees, and groups assess and improve human processes, such as commu￾nication, interpersonal relations, decision making, and task performance. Schein argues 
that effective consultants and managers should be good helpers, aiding others in getting 
things done and in achieving the goals they have set.3
 Thus, PC is as much a philosophy 
as a set of techniques aimed at performing this helping relationship. The philosophy 
ensures that those who are receiving the help own their problems, gain the skills and 
expertise to diagnose them, and solve the problems themselves. PC is an approach to 
helping people and groups help themselves.
As a philosophy of helping in relationships, Schein proposes ten principles to guide 
the process consultant’s actions.4
12254 PART 3 Human Process Interventions
Always try to be helpful. Process consultants must be mindful of their intentions, 
and each interaction must be oriented toward being helpful.
Always stay in touch with the current reality. Each interaction should produce 
diagnostic information about the current situation. It includes data about the client’s 
opinions, beliefs, and emotions; the system’s current functioning; and the practitio￾ner’s reactions, thoughts, and feelings.
Access your ignorance. An important source of information about current reality 
is the practitioner’s understanding of what is known, what is assumed, and what is 
not known. Process consultants must use themselves as instruments of change.
Everything you do is an intervention. Any interaction in a consultative relation￾ship generates information as well as consequences. Simply conducting preliminary 
interviews with group members, for example, can raise members’ awareness of a 
situation and help them see it in a new light.
The client owns the problem and the solution. This is a key principle in all OD 
practice. Practitioners help clients solve their own problems and learn to manage 
future change.
Go with the flow. When process consultants access their own ignorance, they 
often realize that there is much about the client system and its culture that they do 
not know. Thus, practitioners must work to understand the client’s motivations and 
perceptions.
Timing is crucial. Observations, comments, questions, and other interventions 
intended to be helpful may work in some circumstances and fail in others. Process 
consultants must be vigilant to occasions when the client is open (or not open) to 
suggestions.
Be constructively opportunistic with confrontive interventions. Although 
process consultants must be willing to go with the flow, they also must be willing to 
take appropriate risks. From time to time and in their best judgment, practitioners 
must learn to take advantage of “teachable moments.” A well-crafted process obser￾vation or piece of feedback can provide a group or individual with great insight into 
their behavior.
Everything is information; errors will always occur and are the prime 
source for learning. Process consultants never can know fully the client’s reality 
and invariably will make mistakes. The consequences of these mistakes, the unex￾pected and surprising reactions, are important data that must be used in the ongoing 
development of the relationship.
When in doubt, share the problem. The default intervention in a helping rela￾tionship is to model openness by sharing the dilemma of what to do next.
Group Process
Process consultation deals primarily with the interpersonal and group processes that 
describe how organization members interact with each other. Such social processes 
directly and indirectly affect how work is accomplished. When group process promotes 
effective interactions, groups are likely to perform tasks successfully.5
 Group process 
includes:
Communications. One of the process consultant’s areas of interest is the nature 
and style of communication, or the process of transmitting and receiving thoughts, 
facts, and feelings. Communication can be overt—who talks to whom, about what, 
for how long, and how often. It can include body language, including facial expres￾sions, fidgeting, posture, and hand gestures.6
 Communication can also be covert, as 
when a manager says, “I’m not embarrassed” as his or her face turns scarlet. Covert 
communication is “hidden” and the process consultant often seeks to find the best 
way to make the message more explicit.

The functional roles of group members. The process consultant must be keenly 
aware of the different roles individual members take on in a group. Both upon 
entering and while remaining in a group, individuals must address and understand 
their self-identity, influence, and power that will satisfy personal needs while work￾ing to accomplish group goals. In addition, group members must take on roles that 
enhance (a) task-related activities, such as giving and seeking information and 
elaborating, coordinating, and evaluating activities; and (b) group-maintenance 
actions, directed toward holding the group together as a cohesive team, including 
encouraging, harmonizing, compromising, setting standards, and observing. Most 
ineffective groups perform little group maintenance, and this is a primary reason for 
bringing in a process consultant.
Group problem solving and decision making. To be effective, a group must be 
able to identify problems, examine alternatives, and make decisions. For example, 
one way of making decisions is to ignore a suggestion, as when one person makes a 
suggestion and someone else offers another before the first has been discussed. A sec￾ond method is to give decision-making power to the person in authority. Sometimes, 
decisions are made by minority rule, with the leader arriving at a decision and turn￾ing for agreement to several people who will comply. Frequently, silence is regarded 
as consent. Decisions can also be made by majority rule, consensus, or unanimous 
consent. The process consultant can help the group understand how it makes deci￾sions and the consequences of each decision process, as well as help diagnose which 
type of decision process may be the most effective in a given situation. Decision by 
unanimous consent or consensus, for example, may be ideal in some circumstances 
but too time-consuming or costly in other situations.
Group norms. Especially if a group of people work together over a period of time, it 
develops group norms or standards of behavior about what is good or bad, allowed or 
forbidden, right or wrong. The process consultant can be very helpful in assisting the 
group to understand and articulate its own norms and to determine whether those 
norms are helpful or dysfunctional. By understanding its norms and recognizing 
which ones are helpful, the group can grow and deal realistically with its environ￾ment, make optimum use of its own resources, and learn from its own experiences.7
The use of leadership and authority. A process consultant needs to understand 
processes involved in leadership and how different leadership styles can help or 
hinder a group’s functioning. In addition, the consultant can help the leader adjust 
his or her style to fit the situation.
Basic Process Interventions
For each of the interpersonal and group processes described above, a variety of inter￾ventions may be used. In broad terms, these are aimed at making individuals and 
groups more effective.8
Individual Interventions These interventions are designed primarily to help people 
be more effective in their communication with others. For example, the process con￾sultant can provide feedback to one or more individuals about their overt behaviors 
during meetings. At the covert or hidden level of communication, feedback can be 
more personal and is aimed at increasing the individual’s awareness of how their 
behavior affects others. A useful model for this process has been developed by Luft in 
what is called the Johari Window.
9
 Figure 12.1, a diagram of the Johari Window, shows 
that some personal issues are perceived by both the individual and others. This is the 
“open” window. In the “hidden” window, people are aware of their behavior, motives, 
and issues, but they conceal them from others. People with certain feelings about 
themselves or others in the work group may not share with others unless they feel safe 
and protected; by not revealing reactions they feel might be hurtful or impolite, they 
lessen the degree of communication.
•
•
•
•256 PART 3 Human Process Interventions
The “blind” window comprises personal issues that are unknown to the individual 
but that are communicated clearly to others. For example, one manager who made 
frequent business trips invariably told his or her staff to function as a team and to make 
decisions in his absence. The staff, however, consistently refused to do this because it 
was clear to them, and to the process consultant, that the manager was really saying, 
“Go ahead as a team and make decisions in my absence, but be absolutely certain they 
are the exact decisions I would make if I were here.” Only after the manager partici￾pated in several meetings in which he received feedback was he able to understand 
that he was sending a double message. Thereafter, he tried both to accept decisions 
made by others and to use management by objectives with his staff and with other 
managers. Finally, the “unknown” window represents those personal aspects that are 
unknown to both the individual and others. Because such areas are outside the realm 
of the process consultant and the group, focus is typically on the other three cells.
Individual interventions encourage people to be more open with others and to 
disclose their views, opinions, concerns, and emotions, thus reducing the size of the 
hidden window. Further, the consultant can help individuals give feedback to others, 
thus reducing the size of the blind window. Reducing the size of these two windows 
helps improve the communication process by enlarging the open window, the “self” 
that is open to both the individual and others.
Before process consultants give individual feedback, they first must observe rel￾evant events, ask questions to understand the issues fully, and make certain that the 
feedback is given to the client in a usable manner.10 The following are guidelines11 for 
effective feedback:
The giver and receiver must have consensus on the receiver’s goals.
The giver should emphasize description and appreciation.
The giver should be concrete and specific.
•
•
•

Both giver and receiver must have constructive motives.
The giver should not withhold negative feedback if it is relevant.
The giver should own his or her observations, feelings, and judgments.
Feedback should be timed to when the giver and receiver are ready.
Group Interventions These interventions are aimed at the process, content, or struc￾ture of the group. Process interventions sensitize the group to its own internal processes 
and generate interest in analyzing them. Interventions include comments, questions, 
or observations about relationships between and among group members; problem 
solving and decision making; and the identity and purpose of the group. For example, 
process consultants can help by suggesting that some part of each meeting be reserved 
for examining how these decisions are made and periodically assessing the feelings 
of the group’s members. As Schein points out, however, the basic purpose of the 
process consultant is not to take on the role of expert but to help the group share in 
its own diagnosis and do a better job in learning to diagnose its own processes: “It is 
important that the process consultant encourage the group not only to allocate time 
for diagnosis but to take the lead itself in trying to articulate and understand its own 
processes.”12
Content interventions help the group determine what it works on. They include com￾ments, questions, or observations about group membership; agenda setting, review, and 
testing procedures; interpersonal issues; and conceptual inputs on task-related topics.
Finally, structural interventions help the group examine the stable and recurring 
methods it uses to accomplish tasks and deal with external issues. They include com￾ments, questions, or observations about inputs, resources, and customers; methods for 
determining goals, developing strategies, accomplishing work, assigning responsibility, 
monitoring progress, and addressing problems; and relationships to authority, formal 
rules, and levels of intimacy.
Application 12.1 presents an example of process consultation with the top￾management team of a manufacturing firm.13
Results of Process Consultation
Although process consultation is an important part of organization development and 
has been widely practiced over the past 40 years, a number of difficulties arise in try￾ing to measure performance improvements that are a result of process consultation. 
One problem is that most process consultation is conducted with groups performing 
mental tasks (for example, decision making); the outcomes of such tasks are difficult to 
evaluate. A second difficulty with measuring PC’s effects occurs because in many cases 
process consultation is combined with other interventions in an ongoing OD program. 
Isolating the impact of process consultation from other interventions is challenging.
Kaplan’s review of process consultation studies underscored the problems of 
measuring performance effects.14 It examined published studies in three categories: 
(1) reports in which process intervention is the causal variable but performance is 
measured inadequately or not at all, (2) reports in which performance is measured 
but process consultation is not isolated as the independent variable (the case in many 
instances), and (3) research in which process consultation is isolated as the causal 
variable and performance is adequately measured. The review suggests that process 
consultation has positive effects on participants, according to self-reports of greater 
personal involvement, higher mutual influence, group effectiveness, and similar vari￾ables. However, very little, if any, research clearly demonstrates that objective task 
effectiveness was increased. In most cases, either the field studies did not directly 
measure performance or the effect of process intervention was confounded with other 
variables.

•This application, a story often told by Ed Schein 
and documented in several of his books about 
process consultation and culture, involves the 
senior management team of an organization that 
he worked with over several years. It illustrates 
well several of the principles of process consulta￾tion, such as accessing your ignorance, always 
trying to be helpful, and understanding that errors 
are the prime source of learning.
The Action Company was a large and innovative 
high-technology organization. One salient feature 
of their executive committee meetings was long 
and loud discussions. Members interrupted each 
other constantly, often got into shouting matches, 
drifted off the subject, and moved from one agenda 
point to another without any clear sense of what 
had been decided. Based on his beliefs about the 
nature of effective groups and his experiences with 
group dynamics training, the process consultant 
made several initial interventions as an “expert” 
consultant. For example, whenever he saw an 
opportunity, he would ask the group to con￾sider the consequences of interrupting each other 
repeatedly. This had the effect of communicating 
his belief that their process was “bad” and inter￾fered with the group’s task and effectiveness. He 
pointed out how important ideas were being lost 
and potentially important ideas were not getting 
a full discussion. The group invariably responded 
with agreement and a resolution to do better, but 
within 10 minutes were back to the same pattern.
As the process consultant reflected on these early 
interventions, he noticed that he was imposing on 
the group his own beliefs about what an ideal team 
should look like and how it should behave. This 
group, on the other hand, was clearly on a differ￾ent path. Over time, he discovered that this group 
had a different set of shared assumptions that were 
driving their behaviors. In short, the group was try￾ing to arrive at the “truth.” Their assumption was 
that truth was revealed in ideas and actions that 
could withstand argument and debate. If an idea 
could survive intense scrutiny, it must be true and 
was worth pursuing.
Once he understood this basic premise, the proc￾ess consultant asked himself what he could do 
that would be more helpful to the group. His 
answer was to work within the group’s assump￾tions that were driving their behavior rather than 
imposing his beliefs on them. He had to learn that 
the primary task of the group, as they saw it, was 
to develop ideas that were so sound they could 
afford to bet the company on them. Generating 
ideas and evaluating them were therefore the two 
most crucial functions that they worked on in 
meetings.
Two kinds of interventions grew out of this insight. 
First, he noticed that ideas were in fact being lost 
because so much information was being processed 
so rapidly. Partly for his own sake and partly because 
he thought it might help, he went to the flipchart 
and wrote down the main ideas as they came out.
These ideas, incomplete or undeveloped because 
the presenter had been interrupted, led to the 
second kind of intervention. Instead of punishing 
the group for its “bad” behavior, as he had done in 
the early stages of the consultation, he looked for 
opportunities to turn the conversation back over to 
the person with the idea. For example, he would 
say, “John, you were trying to make a point. Did 
we get all of that?” This created the opportunity 
to get the idea out without drawing unnecessary 
attention to the reason why it had not gotten out in 
the first place. The combination of these two kinds 
of interventions focused the group on the ideas 
that were not on the flipchart and helped them 
navigate through their complex agenda. Ideas that 
were about to be lost were written down, resur￾rected, and given a fair chance.
The lesson was clear. Until the process consultant 
understood what the group really was trying to 
do, he could not focus on the right processes and 
he did not know how to intervene helpfully. He 
had to sense what the primary task was and where 
the group was getting stuck (incomplete idea 
formulation and too-quick evaluation) before he 
could determine what kind of intervention would 
be “helpful.”
Process Consultation at Action Company
application 12.1CHAPTER 12 Interpersonal and Group Process Approaches 259
A third problem with assessing the performance effects of process consultation is 
that much of the relevant research has used people’s perceptions rather than hard 
performance measures as the index of success.15 Although much of this research shows 
positive results, these findings should be interpreted carefully until further research is 
done using more concrete measures of performance.
THIRD-PARTY INTERVENTIONS
Third-party interventions focus on conflicts arising between two or more people 
within the same organization. Conflict is inherent in groups and organizations and can 
arise from various sources, including differences in personality, task orientation, goal 
interdependence, and perceptions among group members, as well as competition for 
scarce resources. Tjosvold notes that too little consensus on the definition of conflict 
has contributed to the perception that conflict is bad. Moreover, when it is defined as 
opposing interests or divergent goals, it narrows the range of potentially productive 
interventions. He suggests that conflict is best viewed as “incompatible activities.” Such 
a definition opens up options for resolution, places responsibility for the conflict with 
the individuals involved, and allows conflict to be seen in a positive way.16
To emphasize that conflict is neither good nor bad per se is important.17 Conflict can 
enhance motivation and innovation and lead to greater understanding of ideas and 
views. On the other hand, it can prevent people from working together constructively, 
destroying necessary task interactions among group members. Consequently, third￾party interventions are used primarily in situations in which conflict significantly dis￾rupts necessary task interactions and work relationships among members.
Third-party interventions vary considerably depending on the kind of issues under￾lying the conflict. Conflict can arise over substantive issues, such as work methods, pay 
rates, and conditions of employment, or it can emerge from interpersonal issues, such 
as personalities and misperceptions. When applied to substantive issues, conflict reso￾lution interventions often involve resolving labor–management disputes through arbi￾tration and mediation. The methods used in such substantive interventions require 
considerable training and expertise in law and labor relations and generally are not 
considered part of OD practice. For example, when union and management represen￾tatives cannot resolve a joint problem, they can call upon the Federal Mediation and 
Conciliation Service to help them resolve the conflict. In addition, “alternative dispute 
resolution” (ADR) practices increasingly are offered in lieu of more expensive and 
time-consuming court trials.18 Conflicts also may arise at the boundaries of the organi￾zation, such as between suppliers and the company, between a company and a public￾policy agency, or between multiple organizations or groups.19
When conflict involves interpersonal issues, however, OD has developed approaches 
that help control and resolve it. These third-party interventions help the parties interact 
with each other directly, recognize the personal choices each party is making, and facili￾tate their diagnosis of the conflict and its resolution. The ability to facilitate conflict res￾olution is a basic skill in OD and applies to all of the process interventions discussed in 
this chapter. Consultants, for example, frequently coach clients through a conflict or 
help organization members resolve interpersonal conflicts that invariably arise during 
process consultation and team building.
Third-party interventions cannot resolve all interpersonal conflicts in organi zations, 
nor should they. Many times, interpersonal conflicts are not severe or disruptive 
enough to warrant attention. At other times, they simply may burn themselves out. 
Evidence also suggests that other methods may be more appropriate under certain 
conditions. For example, managers tend to control the process and outcomes of conflict 
resolution actively when they are under heavy time pressures, when the disputants are 260 PART 3 Human Process Interventions
not expected to work together in the future, and when the resolution of the dispute 
has a broad impact on the organization.20 Under those conditions, the third party may 
resolve the conflict unilaterally with little input from the conflicting parties.
An Episodic Model of Conflict
Interpersonal conflict often occurs in iterative, cyclical stages known as “episodes.” An 
episodic model is shown in Figure 12.2. At times, issues underlying a conflict are latent 
and do not present any manifest problems for the parties. Then something triggers the 
conflict and brings it into the open. For example, a violent disagreement or frank con￾frontation can unleash conflictual behavior. Because of the negative consequences of 
that behavior, the unresolved disagreement usually becomes latent again. And again, 
something triggers the conflict, making it overt, and so the cycle continues with the 
next conflict episode.
Conflict has both costs and benefits to the antagonists and to those in contact with 
them. Unresolved conflict can proliferate and expand. An interpersonal conflict may 
be concealed under a cause or issue that serves to make the conflict appear more legiti￾mate. Frequently, the overt conflict is only a symptom of a deeper problem.
The episodic model identifies four strategies for conflict resolution. The first three 
attempt to control the conflict, and only the last approach tries to change the basic 
issues underlying it.21 The first strategy is to prevent the ignition of conflict by arriving 
at a clear understanding of the triggering factors and thereafter avoiding or blunting 
them when the symptoms occur. For example, if conflict between the research and 
production managers is always triggered by new-product introductions, then senior 
executives can warn them that conflict will not be tolerated during the introduction of 
the latest new product. However, this approach may not always be functional and may 
merely drive the conflict underground until it explodes. As a control strategy, however, 
this method may help to achieve a temporary cooling-off period.
The second control strategy is to set limits on the form of the conflict. Conflict can be 
constrained by informal gatherings before a formal meeting or by exploration of other 
options. It also can be limited by setting rules and procedures specifying the conditions 
under which the parties can interact. For example, a rule can be instituted that union 
officials can attempt to resolve grievances with management only at weekly grievance 
meetings.

The third control strategy is to help the parties cope differently with the conse￾quences of the conflict. The third-party consultant may work with the people involved 
to devise coping techniques, such as reducing their dependence on the relationship, 
ventilating their feelings to friends, and developing additional sources of emotional 
support. These methods can reduce the costs of the conflict without resolving the 
underlying issues.
The fourth method is an attempt to eliminate or to resolve the basic issues causing 
the conflict. As Walton points out, “There is little to be said about this objective because 
it is the most obvious and straightforward, although it is often the most difficult to 
achieve.”22
Facilitating the Conflict Resolution Process
Walton has identified a number of factors and tactical choices that can facilitate the 
use of the episodic model in resolving the underlying causes of conflict.23 The follow￾ing ingredients can help third-party consultants achieve productive dialogue between 
the disputants so that they examine their differences and change their perceptions and 
behaviors: mutual motivation to resolve the conflict; equality of power between the 
parties; coordinated attempts to confront the conflict; relevant phasing of the stages of 
identifying differences and of searching for integrative solutions; open and clear forms 
of communication; and productive levels of tension and stress.
Among the tactical choices identified by Walton are those having to do with 
diagnosis, the context of the third-party intervention, and the role of the consultant. 
One of the tactics in third-party intervention is the gathering of data, usually through 
preliminary interviewing. Group-process observations can also be used. Data gathering 
provides some understanding of the nature and the type of conflict, the personality and 
conflict styles of the individuals involved, the issues and attendant pressures, and the 
participants’ readiness to work together to resolve the conflict.
The context in which the intervention occurs is also important. Consideration of 
the neutrality of the meeting area, the formality of the setting, the appropriateness 
of the time for the meeting (that is, a meeting should not be started until a time has 
been agreed on to conclude or adjourn), and the careful selection of those who should 
attend the meeting are all elements of this context.
In addition, the third-party consultant must decide on an appropriate role to assume 
in resolving conflict. The specific tactic chosen will depend on the diagnosis of the situ￾ation. For example, facilitating dialogue of interpersonal issues might include initiating 
the agenda for the meeting, acting as a referee during the meeting, reflecting and 
restating the issues and the differing perceptions of the indivi duals involved, giving 
feedback and receiving comments on the feedback, helping the individuals diagnose 
the issues in the conflict, providing suggestions or recommendations, and helping the 
parties do a better job of diagnosing the underlying problem.
Third-party consultants must develop considerable skill at diagnosis, intervention, 
and follow-up, and be highly sensitive to their own feelings and to those of others. They 
must recognize that some tension and conflict are inevitable and that although there 
can be an optimum amount and degree of conflict, too much conflict can be dysfunc￾tional for both the people involved and the larger organization. The third-party consul￾tant must be sensitive to the situation and able to use a number of different intervention 
strategies and tactics when intervention appears to be useful. Finally, he or she must 
have professional expertise in third-party intervention and must be seen by the parties 
as neutral or unbiased regarding the issues and outcomes of the conflict resolution.
Application 12.2 describes an attempt to address conflict in an information technol￾ogy unit.24 How does this description fit with the process described above? What would 
you have done differently?Conflict Management at Balt
Healthcare Corporation
Pete Brooks and Dan Gantman were managers in 
an IT department that was part of the information 
services group at Balt Healthcare Corporation, 
a large organization that provided health care 
products to a global market. Brooks was the gen￾eral manager of the IT department and had been 
working in the unit for most of his 16 years with 
Balt. The IT department had global responsibility 
for developing and maintaining the organiza￾tion’s intranets, Web sites, and internal networks. 
Brooks ran his department with a traditional and 
formal management style where communication 
traveled vertically through the hierarchy.
Gantman recently had been assigned to Brooks’s 
department to operate a small experimental group 
charged with developing E-commerce solutions for 
the organization and the industry. This was state￾of-the-art development work with enormous future 
implications for the organization as it explored 
the possibility of sales, business-to-business, and 
other supply-chain opportunities on the Internet. 
Gantman, in contrast to Brooks, had a manage￾ment style that stressed the value of open com￾munication channels to promote teamwork and 
collaboration.
The biggest challenge in Gantman’s work was 
managing the transition from design into produc￾tion. Senior management at Balt believed that by 
assigning Gantman’s team to Brooks’s organiza￾tion, the resources required to manage this transi￾tion would be more readily available to Gantman’s 
group. In fact, it was generally agreed that Brooks’s 
strengths complemented Gantman’s weaknesses. 
Whereas Gantman was a better designer, Brooks 
had operational expertise that would help in bring￾ing Gantman’s ideas on-line.
Unfortunately, the trouble started almost as soon as 
the assignment was announced. Although in front 
of their bosses, Brooks had agreed to work with 
Gantman to make the project a success, his support 
was lukewarm at best. Gantman and Brooks had a 
history of conflict in the organization. Neither one 
respected the other’s style, and prior conflicts had 
been swept under the carpet, creating a considerable 
amount of pent-up animosity. Operationally, when 
Gantman’s group needed resources to bring an idea 
on-line, Brooks announced that all of his people 
were busy and that he couldn’t assign anyone to 
help. Similarly, anytime Gantman needed access to 
a piece of hardware within the IT unit, Brooks made 
it complicated to get that access. Gantman became 
increasingly frustrated by Brooks’s lack of coopera￾tion and he was quite open about his feelings of 
being sabotaged. His complaints reached the high￾est levels of management as well as other members 
of the information services staff.
After several frustrating attempts to speak with 
Brooks about the situation, Gantman consulted 
Marilyn Young, the vice president for information 
services. Young, like others in the organization, was 
aware of the conflict. She requested assistance from 
the human resources manager and an organization 
development specialist. The OD specialist met with 
Brooks and Gantman separately to understand the 
history of the conflict and each individual’s contri￾bution to it. Although different styles were partly to 
blame, the differences in the two work processes 
were also contributing to the problem. Brooks’s 
organization was primarily routine development 
and maintenance tasks that allowed for considera￾ble preplanning and scheduling of resources. 
Gantman’s project, however, was highly creative 
and unpredictable. There was little opportunity to 
give Brooks advance notice regarding the experi￾mental team’s needs for equipment and other 
resources.
The OD specialist recommended several strategies 
to Young, including a direct confrontation, the 
purchase of additional hardware and software, and 
mandating the antagonists’ cooperation. Young 
responded that there was no available budget for 
purchasing new equipment and admitted that she 
did not have any confidence in her ability to facili￾tate the needed communication and leadership for 
her staff. She asked the OD specialist to facilitate 
a more direct process. Agreements were made in 
writing about how the process would work, includ￾ing Young meeting with Gantman and Brooks to 
discuss the problem between them and how it 
was affecting the organization. But Young did not 
follow through on the agreement. She never met 
with Brooks and Gantman at the same time and, as 
application 12.2CHAPTER 12 Interpersonal and Group Process Approaches 263
a result, the messages she sent to each were incon￾sistent. In fact, during their separate conversations, 
it appeared that Young began supporting Brooks 
and criticizing Gantman. Gantman began to with￾draw, productivity in both groups suffered, and he 
became more hostile, stubborn, and bitter.
In the end, Gantman felt sabotaged not only by 
Brooks but by Young as well. He took a leave 
of absence based on Young’s advice. His project 
was left without a leader and he ended up leav￾ing the organization. Brooks stayed on, but staff 
at all levels of the organization were upset that 
his behavior had not been questioned. Similarly, 
the organization lost a lot of respect for Young’s 
ability to address conflict. Losses in productiv￾ity and morale among staff in many areas in the 
organization resulted from the conflict between 
two employees.
TEAM BUILDING
Team building refers to a broad range of planned activities that help groups improve the 
way they accomplish tasks, help members enhance their interpersonal and problem￾solving skills, and increase team performance. Organizations comprise many different 
types of groups including permanent work groups, temporary project teams, and virtual 
teams. Team building is an effective approach to improving teamwork and task accom￾plishment in such environments. It can help problem-solving groups make maximum 
use of members’ resources and contributions. It can help members develop a high 
level of motivation to implement group decisions. Team building also can help groups 
overcome specific problems, such as apathy and general lack of member interest; loss 
of productivity; increasing complaints within the group; confusion about assignments; 
low participation in meetings; lack of innovation and initiation; increasing complaints 
from those outside the group about the quality, timeliness, and effectiveness of services 
and products; and hostility or conflicts among members.
It is equally important that team building can facilitate other OD interventions, such 
as employee involvement, work design, restructuring, and strategic change. Those 
change programs typically are designed by management teams and implemented 
through various committees and work groups. Team building can help the groups 
design high-quality change programs and ensure that the programs are accepted 
and implemented by organization members. Indeed, most technostructural, human 
resources management, and strategic interventions depend on some form of team 
building for effective implementation.
The importance of team building is well established, and its high use is expected to 
continue in the coming years. Management teams are encountering issues of greater 
complexity and uncertainty, especially in such fast-paced industries as software and 
hardware development, entertainment, and health and financial services. Team build￾ing can provide the kind of teamwork and problem-solving skills needed to tackle such 
issues. When the team represents the senior management of an organization, team 
building can be an important part of establishing a coherent corporate strategy, and can 
promote the kind of close cooperation needed to implement complex strategies and 
new forms of governance.25 As manufacturing and service technologies continue to 
develop—for example, just-in-time inventory systems, lean manufacturing, robotics, 264 PART 3 Human Process Interventions
and service quality concepts—there is increasing pressure on organizations to imple￾ment team-based work designs. Team building can assist in the development of group 
goals and norms that support high productivity and quality of work life.
The globalization of work and organizations implies that people from different cul￾tures and geographic locations will increasingly interact over complex management 
and operational tasks using a variety of information and communication technologies. 
Team-building activities for these “virtual” teams have increased substantially over the 
past several years.26 Most team building processes are based on assumptions of face-to￾face interaction and relationships are built partially on the basis of visual cues. In vir￾tual teams, research suggests that closeness between team members is created through 
proactive offers of help and support on task related issues, and maintained through 
frequent, short, and task-focused communications (often technology mediated). Thus, 
team-building can help virtual teams to examine cross-cultural issues and their impact 
on decision making and problem solving, facilitate communication processes where 
tone and body language clues are absent, and build trust.
Finally, mergers and acquisitions, restructurings, and strategic alliances continue to 
proliferate. The success of these endeavors depends partly on getting members from 
different organizations to work together effectively. Team building can facilitate the 
formation of a unified team with common goals and procedures.
In the OD literature, team building is not clearly differentiated from process consulta￾tion and group facilitation. This confusion exists because most team building includes 
process consultation—helping the group diagnose and understand its own internal 
processes—and facilitation—providing structure to a group’s interactions so that it can 
focus on an agenda and exchange information. However, process consultation is a more 
general approach to helping relationships than is team building. Team building focuses 
explicitly on helping groups perform tasks and solve problems more effectively. Process 
consultation, on the other hand, is concerned with establishing effective helping rela￾tionships in organizations while facilitation often represents a substitute for group pro￾cess. It is seen as key to effective management and consultation and can be applied to 
any helping relationship, from subordinate development to interpersonal relationships 
to group development. Thus, team building consists of process consultation plus other, 
more task-oriented interventions.
Team building is applicable in a large number of situations, from starting a new 
team, to resolving conflicts among members, to revitalizing a complacent team. Dyer 
has developed a checklist for identifying whether a team-building program is needed 
and whether the organization is ready to start such a program (Table 12.1).27 If the 
problem is a structural or technical one, an intergroup issue, an administrative mistake, 
or a conflict between only two people, team building would not be an appropriate 
change strategy.
Team-Building Activities
A team is a group of interdependent people who share a common purpose, have com￾mon work methods, and hold each other accountable.28 The nature of that interde￾pendence varies, creating the following types of teams: groups reporting to the same 
supervisor, manager, or executive; groups involving people with common organiza￾tional goals; temporary groups formed to do a specific, one-time task; groups consist￾ing of people whose work roles are interdependent; and groups whose members have 
no formal links in the organization but whose collective purpose is to achieve tasks 
they cannot accomplish alone. Another important variable in teams is location. When 
team members are in close proximity, a traditional team exists; when members are 
geographically dispersed and their interaction is mediated by information technology, 
a virtual team exists.CHAPTER 12 Interpersonal and Group Process Approaches 265
Text not available due to copyright restrictions266 PART 3 Human Process Interventions
Several factors can affect the outcomes of any specific team-building activity: the 
length of time allocated to the activity, the team’s willingness to look at its processes, 
the length of time the team has been working together, and the team’s permanence. 
Consequently, the results of team-building activities can range from comparatively 
modest changes in the team’s operating mechanisms (for example, meeting more fre￾quently or gathering agenda items from more sources) to much deeper changes (for 
example, modifying team members’ behavior patterns or the nature and style of the 
group’s management, or developing greater openness and trust).
Hackman has proposed that effective teams produce outputs that satisfy external 
stakeholders, constantly improve their team functioning, and have members that 
are learning.29 As a result, team-building activities can be classified according to their 
level and orientation (see Table 12.2). Team-building activities can focus on the fol￾lowing levels: (1) one or more individuals; (2) the group’s operation and behavior; 
or (3) the group’s relationship with the rest of the organization. They also can be 
classified according to whether their orientation is (1) diagnostic or (2) development.

[Table 12.2]
A particular team-building activity can overlap these categories, and, on occasion, 
a change in one area will have negative results in other areas. For example, a very 
cohesive team may increase its isolation from other groups, leading to intergroup con￾flict or other dysfunctional results, which in turn can have a negative impact on the 
total organization unless the team develops sufficient diagnostic skills to recognize and 
deal with such problems.
Activities Relevant to One or More Individuals
People come into groups and organizations with varying needs for achievement, inclu￾sion, influence, and belonging. These needs can be supported and nurtured by the 
team’s structure and process or they can be discouraged. Diagnostic interviews and 
survey instruments can help members to better understand their motivations, style, 
or emotions in the group context. It results in one or more of the members gain￾ing a better understanding of the way inclusion, emotions, control, and power affect 
problem solving and other group processes, and provide choices about their degree of 
involvement and commitment. Such activities provide information so that people have 
a clearer sense of how their needs and wants can or will be supported.
Developmental activities that address one or more members of the group include 
coaching, 360-degree feedback, and assistance with conflict. These interventions 
attempt to alter the group’s ongoing processes by focusing on the behaviors and atti￾tudes of individual members. For example, one team’s typical decision-making process 
included the leader having several agenda items for discussion. Each of the items, how￾ever, had a predetermined set of actions that she wanted the group to take. Most mem￾bers were frustrated by their inability to influence the conclusions. The team-building 
process consisted of coaching the team leader and group members about ways to change 
this process. The leader received feedback about specific examples of her not-so-subtle 268 PART 3 Human Process Interventions
manipulation to arrive at preconceived decisions and how group members felt about it. 
At the next meeting, the leader acknowledged the feedback and indicated her willing￾ness to be challenged about such preconceived decisions. Team members expressed 
their increased willingness to engage in problem-solving discussions, their trust in the 
leader, and their ability to make the challenge without fear of reprisal.
Activities Oriented to the Group’s Operation and Behavior
The most common focus of team-building activities is behavior related to task perfor￾mance and group process. In an effective team, task behavior and group process must 
be integrated with each other as well as with the needs and wants of the people making 
up the group. Diagnostic activities involve gathering data through the use of question￾naires or, more commonly, through interviews. The nature of the data gathered will 
vary depending on the purpose of the team-building program, the consultant’s knowl￾edge about the organization and its culture, and the people involved. The consultant 
already may have obtained a great deal of data by sitting in as a process observer at 
staff and other meetings. The data gathered also will depend on what other OD efforts 
have taken place in the organization. By whatever method obtained, however, the 
data usually include information on leadership styles and behavior; goals, objectives, 
and decision-making processes; organizational culture, communication patterns, and 
interpersonal relationships and processes; barriers to effective group functioning; and 
task and related technical problems. Diagnostic activities often establish a framework 
within which further work can be done.
Developmental activities aim to improve the group’s process and functioning. 
French and Bell have defined team development as “an inward look by the team at 
its own performance, behavior, and culture for the purposes of dropping out dysfunc￾tional behaviors and strengthening functional ones.”30A variety of team development 
activities and exercises have been described by different authors.31 They include role 
clarification, improving goal clarity and member commitment, modifying the decision￾making or problem-solving process, changing norms, increasing risk taking and trust, 
and improving communication.
Application 12.3 presents an example of a team-building meeting involving a top￾management team.
Activities Affecting the Group’s Relationship 
with the Rest of the Organization
As a team gains a better understanding of itself and becomes better able to diagnose 
and solve its own problems, it focuses on its role within the organization. A group’s 
relationship to the larger organizational context is an important aspect of group effec￾tiveness.32 Diagnostic activities focus on understanding the group’s organizational role, 
how its goals support the larger organization, or how the group interacts with other 
groups.
Developmental activities involve actions that improve or modify the group’s contri￾bution to the organization, how it acquires resources, or alters its outputs in terms of 
cost, quality, and quantity. Sometimes, the team may recognize a need for more col￾laboration with other parts of the organization and may try to establish a project team 
that crosses the boundaries of existing teams.
As the team becomes more cohesive, it usually exerts a stronger influence on other 
groups within the organization. This can lead to intergroup conflict. Because that is one 
area in which team building can have negative effects, the process consultant must help 
the group understand its role within the larger organization, develop its own diagnostic 
skills, and examine alternative action plans so that intergroup tensions and conflicts do 
not expand.application 12.3
Building the Executive Team 
at Caesars Tahoe
Caesars Tahoe is a casino, hotel, and entertain￾ment complex on the south shore of Lake Tahoe, 
Nevada. As part of the Caesars World chain, 
including Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, Caesars in 
Atlantic City, and the riverboat Caesars Indiana, 
Caesars Tahoe enjoys a reputation as a “high￾end” experience. Its history is laced with stories 
of celebrities, athletes, and some of the wealthiest 
people in the world winning and losing millions 
of dollars gambling in its casinos. Originally estab￾lished as an alternative to the Las Vegas desert, 
Caesars Tahoe is the third-largest facility in town 
in terms of casino floor space and number of 
rooms, but it has the largest showroom for head￾line talent, the highest gambling limits, and the 
highest proportion of table games such as craps, 
blackjack, and roulette.
In 1995, the Caesars World organization was pur￾chased by the ITT conglomerate, was spun off into 
the Starwood Resorts organization when ITT reor￾ganized in 1997, and then was sold to Park Place 
Entertainment when Starwood decided to focus on 
nongaming properties. As of late 1999, the Caesars 
World corporate office was waiting for the transac￾tion with Park Place to be closed formally.
The executive team at Caesars Tahoe consisted of 
an executive vice president and general manager 
(GM) for the property and seven direct reports. The 
marketing function was divided into three seg￾ments, each headed by a vice president. Far East 
marketing was responsible for recruiting “million￾dollar players” from the South Pacific region; 
national marketing was responsible for working 
with other Caesars properties to ensure that “high 
rollers” from the United States were well attended 
to; and casino marketing handled the more tradi￾tional promotion activities of advertising, special￾events coordination, entertainment bookings, and 
convention marketing. The hotel vice president 
was responsible for the front desk, housekeeping, 
maintenance, food and beverage service, and so 
on. The casino operations vice president managed 
all gambling operations. In addition, there was a 
vice president for human resources and a chief 
financial officer. The vice presidents for casino 
marketing and casino operations had been with the 
property for 10 and 20 years, respectively. No other 
member of the team had been with the property 
more than two years. In fact, the current GM was 
the 13th in 20 years.
The GM contacted an external OD consultant 
to help the executive team improve teamwork 
and clarify the core values of the organization. 
General changes in the gaming industry, higher 
than normal turnover levels in the hotel and 
casino, concerns over whether the Caesars “brand” 
had suffered in all the corporate portfolio adjust￾ments, and conflicts among his senior managers 
prompted his call. His own vision for the property 
included growing the property, reestablishing the 
Caesars brand, and investing in human resources. 
Interviews with the members of executive com￾mittee confirmed his initial descriptions about the 
team and the organization’s situation.
In consultation with the GM, the corporate OD 
consultant, and the human resources vice presi￾dent, an agenda was developed that addressed the 
goals and vision for the property, team processes 
and roles, and action plans for the future. A two-day 
off-site meeting was arranged at a local resort.
The workshop kicked off on the evening before the 
meeting with a welcome and overview of the 
agenda by the GM and a stakeholder mapping 
exercise that clarified the current mission of the 
pro perty. Team members were excused for the 
evening with the thoughts of the exercise fresh in 
their minds. On the morning of the first day, 
executive-committee members were encouraged 
to share their expectations for the meeting and to 
develop specific norms that would guide their 
behaviors during the two-day meeting. This proc￾ess was aided by an exercise in which the group 
members shared their experiences about the best 
team they had ever worked on and in that way 
identified characteristics of effec tive teams. The 
norms and characteristics were placed on flipcharts 
and hung on the wall of the meeting room. All 
members agreed to behave according to the norms 
and to assess periodically how well the norms 
were being followed. The consultant agreed to 
provide feedback on norm compliance during the 
session.270 PART 3 Human Process Interventions
The group then participated in a problem- solving 
exercise that prompted members to collaborate on 
a task. The task generated important data about 
the group’s functioning. Those observations were 
discussed, as were insights about the team gleaned 
from the results of an interpersonal style instrument 
completed by members prior to the meeting. The 
nature of the conflicts among members also was dis￾cussed. From this new basis of group understanding, 
the executive committee began to discuss their hopes 
and visions for the property. The first day ended with 
several unfinished lists of value statements, core pur￾poses, and thoughts about the strategies and markets 
served by the organization. An evaluation of the day 
asked for an overall rating and comments about what 
the group should stop, start, and continue to do.
The next day began by feeding back the data from 
the evaluation, which suggested that most people 
were satisfied with the accomplishments of the 
first day but that important issues still needed 
to be addressed. Although the agenda called for 
a flow similar to that of the day before, moving 
back and forth between teamwork-related activi￾ties and discussions about the property’s future, 
the consultant wrote several important topics on a 
flipchart and asked the group to identify the most 
important agenda items. Quickly they decided that 
they wantedto finish the core-values work and 
then discuss their core purpose.
The consultant facilitated the conversation that 
was now clearly under the control of the group 
members. Within a couple of hours, the group 
had produced a list of core values, developed a 
process for involving the rest of the organization 
in creating a final list of values, and crafted a core 
purpose that described the essence of the organi￾zation. Based on this work, the group moved to 
some initial discussions about its vision for the 
future. In addition, the group generated a list of 
key action items necessary to realize that vision. 
This was especially tricky given the uncertain 
demands of the new owner, but the group decided 
that it was important to have a clear strategy 
for themselves so that any demands from the 
new parent could be evaluated. Members also 
reasoned that the parent might ask them what 
they thought was possible and they wanted to be 
ready.
The meeting ended with the completion of a 
responsibility chart to clarify task completion 
expectations and accountabilities among the 
team members. A final evaluation of the meeting 
included process observations by the team 
members about how they had worked together 
and statements about their satisfaction with the 
results of the meeting. They all agreed that they 
had made important decisions and were leaving 
with substantial results. 
The Manager’s Role in Team Building
Ultimately, the manager is responsible for team functioning, although this responsibility 
obviously must be shared by the group itself. Therefore, it is management’s task to develop 
a work group that can regularly analyze and diagnose its own effectiveness and work pro￾cess. With the team’s involvement, the manager must diagnose the group’s effectiveness 
and take appropriate actions if it shows signs of operating difficulty or stress.
Boss and McConkie surveyed over 3,500 team building participants and found that 
92% identified the team’s leader as the single most important role in successful team 
building.33 Many managers, however, have not been trained to perform the data gath￾ering, diagnosis, planning, and action necessary to maintain and improve their teams 
continually. Thus, the issue of who should lead a team-building session is a function 
of managerial capability. The initial use of an OD consultant usually is advisable if a 
manager is aware of problems, feels that he or she may be part of the problem, and 
believes that some positive action is needed to improve the operation of the team, but 
is not sure how to go about it. Dyer has provided a checklist for assessing the need for 
a consultant (Table 12.3). Some of the questions ask the manager to examine problems CHAPTER 12 Interpersonal and Group Process Approaches 271
and establish the degree to which he or she feels comfortable in trying out new and 
different things, the degree of knowledge about team building, whether the boss might 
be a major source of difficulty, and the openness of group members.
Basically, the role of the OD consultant is to work closely with the manager (and 
members of the team) to a point at which the manager is capable of engaging in team 
development activities as a regular and ongoing part of overall managerial responsibilities. 
Assuming that the manager wants and needs a consultant, the two should work together 
in developing the initial program, keeping in mind that (1) the manager ultimately is 
responsible for all team-building activities, even though the consultant’s resources are 
available; and (2) the goal of the consultant’s presence is to help the manager learn to 
continue team development processes with minimum consultant help or without the 
ongoing help of the consultant.
Thus, in the first stages, the consultant might be much more active in data gathering, 
diagnosis, and action planning, particularly if a one- to three-day off-site workshop is 
considered. In later stages, the consultant takes a much less active role, with the man￾ager becoming more active and serving as both manager and team developer.
The Results of Team Building
The research on team building’s effectiveness has produced inconsistent results. Some 
studies have reported positive results across a range of variables including feelings, 
attitudes, and measures of performance.34 For example, one review showed that team 
building improves process measures, such as employee openness and decision making, 
Assessing the Need for a Consultant
SHOULD YOU USE AN OUTSIDE CONSULTANT TO HELP IN TEAM BUILDING?
(Circle the appropriate response.)
1. Does the manager feel comfortable in trying out something 
new and different with the staff?
Yes No ?
2. Is the staff used to spending time in an outside location 
working on issues of concern to the work unit?
Yes No ?
3. Will group members speak up and give honest data? Yes No ?
4. Does your group generally work together without a lot of 
conflict or apathy?
Yes No ?
5. Are you reasonably sure that the boss is not a major source of 
difficulty?
Yes No ?
6. Is there a high commitment by the boss and unit members to 
achieving more effective team functioning?
Yes No ?
7. Is the personal style of the boss and his or her management 
philosophy consistent with a team approach?
Yes No ?
8. Do you feel you know enough about team building to begin a 
program without help?
Yes No ?
9. Would your staff feel confident enough to begin a team￾building program without outside help?
Yes No ?
Scoring: If you have circled six or more “yes” responses, you probably do not need 
an outside consultant. If you have circled four or more “no” responses, you probably 
do need a consultant. If you have a mixture of “yes,” “no,” and ? responses, invite a 
consultant to talk over the situation and make a joint decision.

about 45% of the time and improves outcome measures, such as productivity and 
costs, about 53% of the time.35 Another review revealed that team building positively 
affects hard measures of productivity, employee withdrawal, and costs about 50% of 
the time.36
Other studies have shown less positive outcomes.37 In general, the research sup￾ports a pattern of positive changes in attitudes or satisfaction. However, less powerful 
research designs and short time frames prohibit drawing strong conclusions linking 
performance improvements to team development efforts.38 For example, one review 
of 30 studies found that only ten tried to measure changes in performance. Although 
these changes were generally positive, the studies’ research designs were relatively 
weak, reducing confidence in the findings.39 Moreover, team building rarely occurs in 
isolation. Usually, it is carried out in conjunction with other interventions leading to or 
resulting from team building itself. For this reason it is difficult to separate the effects 
of team building from those of the other interventions.
Buller and Bell have attempted to differentiate the effects of team building from 
the effects of other interventions that occur along with team building.40 Specifically, 
they tried to separate the effects of team building from the effects of goal setting, 
an intervention aimed at setting realistic performance goals and developing action 
plans for achieving them. In a rigorous field experiment, Buller and Bell exam￾ined the differential effects of team building and goal setting on productivity mea￾sures of underground miners. The results showed that team building affects the 
quality of performance and goal setting affects the quantity of performance. This 
differential impact was explained in terms of the nature of the mining task. The 
task of improving the quality of performance was more complex, unstructured, and 
interdependent than was the task of achieving quantity. This suggests that team 
building can improve group performance, particularly on tasks that are complex, 
unstructured, and interdependent. That the advantages of combining both interven￾tions were inconclusively identified in the Buller and Bell study suggests the need for 
additional studies of the differential impact of team building and other interventions 
such as goal setting.
Team building, like OD at the organization level, is a process over time, and OD 
practitioners need to be aware of the full range of reasons teams are effective. Research 
by Hackman and his colleagues have suggested that too much time may be spent try￾ing to help teams that were designed and launched incorrectly. They argue that one 
of the most important tasks of the OD practitioner is to be sure that any team gets 
chartered and launched correctly.41 In a related study where the teams’ launching was 
held constant, Woolley found that task-focused (as opposed to process-focused) inter￾ventions given at the mid-point of a team’s lifecycle had the biggest impact on team 
performance.42
The results of team building in virtual teams is still emerging, but shows that many 
of the lessons learned from face-to-face team-building practice can be transferred. 
For example, in a lab study of college students, researchers found that when com￾munications technologies were augmented to include goal setting processes, team 
functioning and team performance improved.43 Because virtual teams are usually 
geographically dispersed, they can also take advantage of a variety of asychnronous 
facilitation tools, such as bulletin boards and portals44 Hart and McCleod found that 
interpersonal closeness between members of a virtual team is created when one mem￾ber proactively helps another member to solve a problem or address a concern, and 
that the closeness is maintained by frequent, short, but content-oriented (as opposed 
to process-oriented) messages.45 Finally, Gibson and Cohen found that team perfor￾mance was enhanced by initial face-to-face team-building meetings in the start-up 
stage of a team’s work.46CHAPTER 12 Interpersonal and Group Process Approaches 273
Finally, Boss has presented considerable evidence to support the effectiveness of 
personal management interviews (PMIs) in sustaining the long-term effects of off-site 
team building.47 A PMI is a follow-up intervention that arrests the potential fade-out 
effects of off-site team building.48 A team leader negotiates roles with each member and 
then holds regular meetings with each team member to resolve problems and increase 
personal accountability. Boss and his colleagues have amassed a large, longitudinal 
data set, mostly in public administration, hospital, and health care settings. When team 
building interventions have included PMI activities (compared to those that have not 
included PMI follow ups), they have found consistent and sustained improvement in 
measures of team functioning and operational performance.
NOTES
SUMMARY
In this chapter, we presented human process interventions aimed at interpersonal 
relations and group dynamics. Among the earliest interventions in OD, these change 
programs help people gain interpersonal competence, work through interpersonal 
conflicts, and develop effective groups.
Process consultation is used not only as a way of helping groups become effective 
but also as a means whereby groups learn to diagnose and solve their own problems 
and continue to develop their competence and maturity. Important areas of activity 
include communications, roles of group members, difficulties with problem-solving and 
decision-making norms, and leadership and authority. The basic difference between 
process consultation and third-party intervention is that the latter focuses on inter￾personal dysfunctions in social relationships between two or more individuals within 
the same organization and is targeted toward resolving direct conflict between those 
individuals.
Team building is directed toward improving group effectiveness and the ways in 
which members of teams work together. Teams may be permanent or temporary or 
traditional or virtual, but their members have either common organizational aims or 
work activities. The general process of team building, like process consultation, tries to 
equip a team to handle its own ongoing problem solving.

48. Ibid.Organization Process Approaches
In Chapter 12, we presented interventions aimed 
at improving interpersonal and group proc￾esses. This chapter describes systemwide pro￾cess interventions—change programs directed 
at improving such processes as organizational 
problem solving, leadership, visioning, and task 
accomplishment between groups—for a major 
subsystem or for an entire organization.
The first type of intervention, the organiza￾tion confrontation meeting, is among the earli￾est organizationwide process approaches. It 
helps mobilize the problem-solving resources 
of a major subsystem or whole organization by 
encouraging members to identify and confront 
pressing issues.
The second organization process approach 
is called intergroup relations. It consists of two 
interventions: the intergroup conflict resolution 
meeting and microcosm groups. Both interven￾tions are aimed at diagnosing and addressing 
important organization-level processes, such 
as conflict, the coordination of organizational 
units, and diversity. The intergroup conflict 
intervention is specifically oriented toward con￾flict processes, whereas the microcosm group is 
a more generic systemwide change strategy.
The third and final systemwide process 
approach, the large-group intervention, has 
received considerable attention recently and is 
one of the fastest-growing areas in OD. Large￾group interventions get a “whole system into 
the room”1
 and create processes that allow a 
variety of stakeholders to interact simultane￾ously. A large-group intervention can be used to 
clarify important organizational values, develop 
new ways of looking at problems, articulate a 
new vision for the organization, solve cross￾functional problems, restructure operations, or 
devise an organizational strategy. It is a power￾ful tool for addressing organizational problems 
and opportunities and for accelerating the 
pace of organizational change.
ORGANIZATION CONFRONTATION MEETING
The confrontation meeting is an intervention designed to mobilize the resources of the entire 
organization to identify problems, set priorities and action targets, and begin working on 
identified problems. Originally developed by Beckhard,2
 the intervention can be used at 
any time but is particularly useful when the organization is under stress and when there 
is a gap between the top and the rest of the organization (such as when a new top man￾ager joins the organization). General Electric’s “Work-Out” program is an example of 
how the confrontation meeting has been adapted to fit today’s organizations.3
 Although 
the original model involved only managerial and professional people, it has since been 
used successfully with technicians, clerical personnel, and assembly workers.
Application Stages
The organization confrontation meeting typically involves the following steps:
 1. A group meeting of all those involved is scheduled and held in an appropriate 
place. Usually the task is to identify problems related to the work environment 
and the effectiveness of the organization.
13CHAPTER 13 Organization Process Approaches 277
 2. Groups are appointed representing all departments of the organization. Thus, 
each group might have one or more members from sales, purchasing, finance, 
operations, and quality assurance. For obvious reasons, a subordinate should not 
be in the same group as his or her boss, and top management should form its 
own group. Group size can vary from five to fifteen members, depending on such 
factors as the size of the organization and available meeting places.
 3. The point is stressed that the groups are to be open and honest and to work hard 
at identifying problems they see in the organization. No one will be criticized for 
bringing up problems and, in fact, the groups will be judged on their ability to 
do so.
 4. The groups are given an hour or two to identify organization problems. Generally, 
an OD practitioner goes from group to group, encouraging openness and assisting 
the groups with their tasks.
 5. The groups then reconvene in a central meeting place. Each group reports the 
problems it has identified and sometimes offers solutions. Because each group 
hears the reports of all the others, a maximum amount of information is shared.
 6. Either then or later, the master list of problems is broken down into categories. 
This can be done by the participants, by the person leading the session, or by the 
manager and his or her staff. This process eliminates duplication and overlap and 
allows the problems to be separated according to functional or other appropriate 
areas.
 7. Following problem categorization, participants are divided into problem- solving 
groups whose composition may, and usually does, differ from that of the origi￾nal problem-identification groups. For example, all operations problems may be 
handled by people in that subunit. Or task forces representing appropriate cross 
sections of the organization may be formed.
 8. Each group ranks the problems, develops a tactical action plan, and determines 
an appropriate timetable for completing this phase of the process.
 9. Each group then periodically reports its list of priorities and tactical plans of action 
to management or to the larger group.
10. Schedules for periodic (frequently monthly) follow-up meetings are established. At 
these sessions, the team leaders report either to top management, to the other team 
leaders, or to the group as a whole regarding their team’s progress and plans for 
future action. The formal establishment of such follow-up meetings ensures both 
continuing action and the modification of priorities and timetables as needed.
Application 13.1 presents the Work-Out process at General Electric Medical Systems 
business. It shows how the basic framework of a confrontation meeting can be adapted 
to address organizational problems such as productivity and employee involvement.4
Results of Confrontation Meetings
Because organization confrontation meetings often are combined with other 
approaches, such as survey feedback, determining specific results is difficult. In many 
cases, the results appear dramatic in mobilizing the total resources of the organization 
for problem identification and solution. Beckhard cites a number of specific examples 
in such different organizations as a food products manufacturer, a military products 
manufacturer, and a hotel.5
 Positive results also were found in a confrontation meet￾ing with 40 professionals in a research and development firm.6
The organization confrontation meeting is a classic approach for mobilizing organi￾zational problem solving, especially in times of low performance. Although the results 
of its use appear impressive, little systematic study of this intervention has been done. 
For example, although a variety of anecdotal descriptions exist, there has been no application 13.1
A Work-Out Meeting at General Electric 
Medical Systems Business
As part of the large-scale change effort, former 
CEO Jack Welch and several managers at General 
Electric devised a method for involving many 
organization members in the change process. 
Work-Out is a process for gathering the relevant 
people to discuss important issues and develop a 
clear action plan. The program has four goals: to 
use employees’ knowledge and energy to improve 
work, to eliminate unnecessary work, to build 
trust through a process that allows and encourages 
employees to speak out without being fearful, and 
to engage in the construction of an organization 
that is ready to deal with the future.
At GE Medical Systems (GEMS), internal consul￾tants conducted extensive interviews with manag￾ers throughout the organization. The interviews 
revealed considerable dissatisfaction with existing 
systems, including performance management (too 
many measurement processes, not enough focus 
on customers, unfair reward systems, and unreal￾istic goals), career development, and organizational 
climate. Managers were quoted as saying that
I’m frustrated. I simply can’t do the quality 
of work that I want to do and know how to 
do. I feel my hands are tied. I have no time. I 
need help on how to delegate and operate in 
this new culture.
The goal of downsizing and delayering is cor￾rect. The execution stinks. The concept is to 
drop a lot of “less important” work. This just 
didn’t happen. We still have to know all the 
details, still have to follow all the old policies 
and systems.
In addition to the interviews, Jack Welch spent 
some time at GEMS headquarters listening to 
and trying to understand the issues facing the 
organization.
Based on the information compiled, about 
50 GEMS employees and managers gathered for 
a five-day Work-Out session. The participants 
included the group executive who oversaw the 
GEMS business, his staff, employee relations man￾agers, and informal leaders from the key func￾tional areas who were thought to be risk takers and 
who would challenge the status quo. Most of 
the work during the week was spent unraveling, 
evaluating, and reconsidering the structures and 
processes that governed work at GEMS. Teams 
of managers and employees addressed business 
problems. Functional groups developed visions of 
where their operations were headed. An important 
part of the teams’ work was to engage in “bureauc￾racy busting” by identifying CRAP (Critical Review 
APpraisals) in the organization. Groups were asked 
to list needless approvals, policies, meetings, and 
reports that stifled productivity. In an effort to 
increase the intensity of the work and to encourage 
free thinking, senior managers were not a part of 
these discussions.
At the end of the week, the senior management 
team listened to the concerns, proposals, and 
action plans from the different teams. During the 
presentations, senior GEMS managers worked hard 
to understand the issues, communicate with the 
organization members, and build trust by sharing 
information and discussing constraints and oppor￾tunities. Most of the proposals focused on ways 
to reorganize work and improve returns to the 
organization. According to traditional Work-Out 
methods, managers must make instant, on-the-spot 
decisions about each idea in front of the whole 
group. The three decision choices are (1) approval; 
(2) rejection with clear reasons; and (3) need more 
data, with a decision to be made within a month.
The five-day GEMS session ended with individuals 
and functional teams signing close to a hundred 
written contracts to implement the new processes 
and procedures or drop unnecessary work. The 
contracts were between people, between func￾tional groups, and between levels of management. 
Other organizational contracts affected all GEMS 
members. One important outcome of the Work￾Out effort at GEMS was a decision to involve sup￾pliers in its internal e-mail network. Through that 
interaction, GEMS and a key supplier eventually 
agreed to build new-product prototypes together, 
and their joint efforts have led to further identi￾fication of ways to reduce costs, improve design 
quality, or decrease cycle times.CHAPTER 13 Organization Process Approaches 279
Work-Out at GE has been very successful but 
hard to measure in dollar terms. Since 1988, 
hundreds of Work-Outs have been held, and the 
concept has continued to evolve into best-practice 
investigations, process mapping, and change￾acceleration programs. The Work-Out process, 
however, clearly is based on the confrontation 
meeting model, where a large group of people 
gather to identify issues and plan actions to 
address problems.
published large-sample evaluation of the work out process. There is a clear need for 
evaluative research.
INTERGROUP RELATIONS INTERVENTIONS
The ability to diagnose and understand intergroup relations is important for OD practi￾tioners because (1) groups often must work with and through other groups to accom￾plish their goals; (2) groups within the organization often create problems and place 
demands on each other; and (3) the quality of the relationships between groups can 
affect the degree of organizational effectiveness. Two OD interventions—microcosm 
groups and intergroup conflict resolution—are described here. A microcosm group uses 
members from several groups to help solve organizationwide problems. Intergroup 
issues are explored in this context, and then solutions are implemented in the larger 
organization. Intergroup conflict resolution helps two groups work out dysfunctional 
relationships. Together, these approaches help improve intergroup processes and lead to 
organizational effectiveness.
Microcosm Groups
A microcosm group consists of a small number of individuals who reflect the issue 
being addressed.7
 For example, a microcosm group composed of members represent￾ing a spectrum of ethnic backgrounds, cultures, and races can be created to address 
diversity issues in the organization. This group, assisted by OD practitioners, can create 
programs and processes targeted at specific issues. In addition to addressing diversity 
problems, microcosm groups have been used to carry out organization diagnoses, solve 
communications problems, integrate two cultures, smooth the transition to a new 
structure, and address dysfunctional political processes.
Microcosm groups work through “parallel processes,” which are the unconscious 
changes that take place in individuals when two or more groups interact.8 After groups 
interact, members often find that their characteristic patterns of roles and interactions 
change to reflect the roles and dynamics of the group with whom they were relating. 
Put simply, groups seem to “infect” and become “infected” by the other groups. The 
following example given by Alderfer9
 helps to clarify how parallel processes work:
An organizational diagnosis team had assigned its members to each of five departments 
in a small manufacturing company. Members of the team had interviewed each depart￾ment head and several department members, and had observed department meetings. 
The team was preparing to observe their first meeting of department heads and were 280 PART 3 Human Process Interventions
trying to anticipate the group’s behavior. At first they seemed to have no “rational” basis 
for predicting the top group’s behavior because they “had no data” from direct observa￾tion. They decided to role-play the group meeting they had never seen. Diagnostic team 
members behaved as they thought the department heads would, and the result was 
uncanny. Team members found that they easily became engaged with one another in 
the simulated department-head meeting; emotional involvement occurred quickly for all 
participants. When the team actually was able to observe a department-head meeting, 
they were amazed at how closely the simulated meeting had approximated the actual 
session.
Thus, if a small and representative group can intimately understand and solve a com￾plex organizational problem for themselves, they are in a good position to recommend 
action to address the problem in the larger system.
Application Stages
The process of using a microcosm group to address organizationwide issues involves 
the following five steps:
Identify an issue. This step involves finding a systemwide problem to be addressed. 
This may result from an organizational diagnosis or may be an idea generated by 
an organization member or task force. For example, one microcosm group charged 
with improving organizational communications was started by a division manager. 
He was concerned that the information provided by those reporting directly to 
him differed from the data he received from informal conversations with people 
throughout the division.
Convene the group. Once an issue is identified, the microcosm group can be 
formed. The most important convening principle is that group membership needs 
to reflect the appropriate mix of stakeholders related to the issue. If the issue is 
organizational diversity, then the group should reflect the issue in terms of race, 
gender, age, disability, sexual orientation, culture, or other dimension. If the issue 
is integrating two corporate cultures following a merger, the microcosm group 
should contain people from both organizations who understand their respective 
cultures. Following the initial setup, the group itself becomes responsible for deter￾mining its membership. It will decide whether to add new members and how to 
fill vacant positions.
Convening the group also draws attention to the issue and gives the group sta￾tus. Members need to be perceived as credible representatives of the problem. This 
will increase the likelihood that organization members will listen to and follow the 
suggestions they make.
3. Provide group training. Once the microcosm group is established, training is 
provided in group problem solving and decision making. Team-building interven￾tions also may be appropriate. Group training focuses on establishing a group mis￾sion or charter, working relationships among members, group decision-making 
norms, and definitions of the problem to be addressed.
From a group-process perspective, OD practitioners may need to observe and 
comment on how the group develops. Because the group is a microcosm of 
the organization, it will tend, through its behavior and attitudes, to reflect the 
problem in the larger organization. For example, if the group is addressing diver￾sity issues in the organization, it is likely to manifest the particular dynamics 
that raised the issues in the first place. That is, the group may exhibit difficulty 
communicating across cultures or decision making may exclude or downplay 
certain group’s inputs. Recognizing, within the group, the problem or issue it 
was formed to address is the first step toward solving the problem in the larger 
system.
1.
2.CHAPTER 13 Organization Process Approaches 281
4. Address the issue. This step involves solving the problem and implementing 
solutions. OD practitioners may help the group diagnose, design, implement, and 
evaluate changes. A key issue is gaining commitment in the wider organization to 
implementing the group’s solutions. Several factors can facilitate such ownership. 
First, a communication plan should link group activities to the organization. This 
may include publishing minutes from team meetings; inviting organization mem￾bers, such as middle managers, union representatives, or hourly workers, into the 
meetings; and making presentations to different organizational groups. Second, 
group members need to be visible and accessible to management and labor. This 
can ensure that the appropriate support and resources are developed for the rec￾ommendations. Third, problem-solving processes should include an appropriate 
level of participation by organization members. Different data collection methods 
can be used to gain member input and to produce ownership of the problem and 
solutions.
5. Dissolve the group. The microcosm group can be disbanded following successful 
implementation of changes. This typically involves writing a final report or holding 
a final meeting.
Results of Microcosm Groups The microcosm group intervention derives from an 
intergroup relations theory developed by Alderfer, who has applied it to communica￾tions and race-relations problems. A microcosm group that addressed communications 
issues improved the way meetings were conducted; developed a job posting, career 
development, and promotion program; and conducted new-employee orientations.10
In addition, the group assisted in the development, administration, and feedback of an 
organizationwide employee opinion survey. Alderfer also reported seven years of lon￾gitudinal data on a race-relations advisory group in a large organization.11 Over time, 
white members showed significant improvements in their race-relations perceptions; 
African Americans consistently perceived more evidence of racism in the organization; 
and attendance at the meetings varied both over time and by race. In addition to the 
intragroup data, the case documented several changes in the organization, including 
the development of a race-relations competency document, the implementation of a 
race-relations workshop, and the creation of an upward-mobility policy.
A dearth of research exists on microcosm groups, partly because it is difficult to mea￾sure parallel processes and associate them with measures of organizational processes. 
More research on this intervention is needed.
Resolving Intergroup Conflict
The intergroup conflict intervention is designed specifically to help two groups or 
departments within an organization resolve dysfunctional conflicts. Intergroup con￾flict is neither good nor bad in itself, and in some cases, conflict among departments 
is necessary and productive for organizations.12 This applies where there is little 
interdependence among departments and conflict or competition among them can 
spur higher levels of productivity. For example, organizations structured around dif￾ferent product lines might want to promote competition among the product groups. 
This might increase each group’s productivity and add to the overall effectiveness of 
the firm.
In other organizations, especially those with very interdependent departments, 
conflict may become dysfunctional.13 Two or more groups may grow polarized, and 
their continued conflict may result in the development of defensiveness and negative 
stereotypes of the other group. Polarization can be revealed in such statements as: 
“Any solution they come up with is wrong,” “We find that nobody in that group will 
cooperate with us,” or “What do you expect of those idiots?” Particularly when inter￾group communication is necessary, the amount and quality of communication usually 282 PART 3 Human Process Interventions
drops off. Groups begin seeing the others as “the enemy” rather than in positive or 
even neutral terms. As the amount of communication decreases, the amount of mutual 
problem solving falls off as well. The tendency increases for one group to sabotage the 
efforts of the other group, either consciously or unconsciously.
Application Stages A basic strategy for improving interdepartmental or intergroup 
relationships is to change the perceptions (perhaps, more accurately, misperceptions) 
that the two groups have of each other. One formal approach for accomplishing this, 
originally described by Blake and his associates, consists of a 10-step procedure.14
 1. A consultant external to the two groups obtains their agreement to work directly 
on improving intergroup relationships. (The use of an outside consultant is highly 
recommended because without the moderating influence of such a neutral third 
party, it is almost impossible for the two groups to interact without becoming 
deadlocked and polarized in defensive positions.)
 2. A time is set for the two groups to meet—preferably away from their normal 
work situations.
 3. The consultant, together with the managers of the two groups, describes the 
purpose and objectives of the meeting: to develop better mutual relationships, 
explore the perceptions the groups have of each other, and formulate plans for 
improving the relationship. The two groups are presented the following or similar 
questions: “What qualities or attributes best describe our group?” “What qualities 
or attributes best describe the other group?” and “How do we think the other 
group will describe us?” Then, the two groups are encouraged to establish norms 
of openness for feedback and discussion.
 4. The two groups are assigned to separate rooms and asked to write their answers 
to the three questions. Usually, an outside consultant works with each group to 
help the members become more open and to encourage them to develop lists 
that accurately reflect their perceptions, both of their own image and of the other 
group.
 5. After completing their lists, the two groups reconvene. A representative from 
each group presents the written statements. Only the two representatives are 
allowed to speak. The primary objective at this stage is to make certain that the 
images, perceptions, and attitudes are presented as accurately as possible and 
to avoid the arguments that might arise if the two groups openly confront each 
other. Questions, however, are allowed to ensure that both groups clearly under￾stand the written lists. Justifications, accusations, or other statements are not 
permitted.
 6. When it is clear that the two groups thoroughly understand the content of the 
lists, they separate again. By this point, a great number of misperceptions and 
discrepancies have been brought to light.
 7. The task of the two groups (almost always with a consultant as a process observer) 
is to analyze and review the reasons for the discrepancies. The emphasis is on 
solving the problems and reducing the misperceptions. The actual or implicit 
question is not whether the perception of the other group is right or wrong but 
rather “How did these perceptions occur? What actions on the part of our group 
may have contributed to this set of perceptions?”
 8. When the two groups have worked through the discrepancies, as well as the areas 
of common agreement, they meet to share both the identified discrepancies and 
their problem-solving approaches to those discrepancies. Because the primary 
focus is on the behavior underlying the perceptions, free, open discussion is 
encouraged between the two groups, and their joint aim is to develop an overall 
list of remaining and possible sources of friction and isolation.CHAPTER 13 Organization Process Approaches 283
 9. The two groups are asked to develop specific plans of action for solving specific 
problems and for improving their relationships.
10. When the two groups have gone as far as possible in formulating action plans, at 
least one follow-up meeting is scheduled so that the groups can report on actions 
that have been implemented, identify any further problems that have emerged, 
and, where necessary, formulate additional action plans.
In addition to this formal approach to improving interdepartmental or intergroup rela￾tionships there are a number of more informal procedures. Beckhard asks each of the 
two groups to develop a list of what irritates or exasperates them about the other group 
and to predict what they think the other group will say about them.15 A more simpli￾fied approach, although perhaps not as effective, is to bring the two groups together, 
dispense with the written lists developed in isolation, and discuss only common 
problems and irritations. Finally, based on their experience at TRW Systems, Fordyce 
and Weil developed a modified approach whereby each group builds three lists—one 
containing “positive feedback” items (those things the group values and likes about 
the other group), a “bug” list (those things the group dislikes about the other group), 
and an “empathy” list (predictions about what the other group’s list contains).16 When 
the groups come together, they build a master list of major concerns and unresolved 
problems, which are assigned priorities and developed into an agenda. When they 
have completed the task, the subgroups report the results of their discussions to the 
total group, which then develops a series of action steps for improving the relations 
between the groups and commits itself to following through. For each action step, 
specific responsibilities are assigned, and an overall schedule is developed for prompt 
completion of the action steps.
Different approaches to resolving intergroup conflict form a continuum from behav￾ioral solutions to attitudinal change solutions.17 Behavioral methods are oriented to 
keeping the relevant parties physically separate and specifying the limited conditions 
under which interaction will occur. Little attempt is made to understand or change 
how members of each group see the other. Conversely, attitudinal methods, such as 
exchanging group members or requiring intense interaction with important rewards 
or opportunities clearly tied to coordination, are directed at changing how each group 
perceives the other. Here, it is assumed that perceptual distortions and stereotyping 
underlie the conflict and need to be changed to resolve it.
Most of the OD solutions to intergroup conflict reviewed in this section favor atti￾tudinal change strategies. However, such interventions typically require considerably 
more skill and time than do the behavioral solutions. Changing attitudes is difficult in 
conflict situations, especially if the attitudes are deep-seated and form an integral part 
of people’s personalities. Attitudinal change interventions should be reserved for those 
situations in which behavioral solutions might not work.
Behavioral interventions seem most applicable in situations in which task inter￾dependence between the conflicting groups is relatively low and predictable. For 
example, the task interaction between the production and the maintenance depart￾ments might be limited to scheduled periodic maintenance of machines. Here, higher 
management can physically separate the departments and specify the limited condi￾tions under which they should interact. Where the shared task requires only limited 
interaction, that interaction can be programmed and standardized.
Attitudinal change interventions seem necessary when task interdependence 
between the conflicting groups is high and unpredictable, such as might be found 
between the research and the production departments during a new-product introduc￾tion. Here, the two departments need to work together closely, often at unpredictable 
times and with novel, complex issues. When conflicts arise because of misperceptions, 
they must be worked through in terms of people’s perceptions and attitudes. The 284
shared task does not permit physical separation or limited, specific interaction. It is in 
these highly interdependent and unpredictable task situations that the conflict resolu￾tion interventions discussed in this section are most appropriate.
Application 13.2 presents an example of intergroup conflict resolved by an attitu￾dinal change intervention.18 The method reflects a variation on the traditional process 
described above and also places the intervention in a planned change context.
Results of Intergroup Conflict Interventions A number of studies have been done 
on the effects of intergroup conflict resolution. Positive results have been reported by 
several researchers in a variety of settings, including union–management relations, 
an Indian tribal council, government organizations, and for-profit firms.19 The results 
include attitudinal changes such as improved perceptions, increased trust, and less ste￾reotyping in addition to improved operational results. For example, Huse found that 
bringing representatives of different groups together to work on common work-related 
problems had a marked effect, not only on relationships among a number of different 
manufacturing groups but also on the quality of the product, which increased 62%.20
The technology for improving intergroup relations is promising. A greater distinc￾tion between attitudinal and behavioral changes needs to be made in planning effective 
intergroup interventions. A greater variety of interventions that address the practical 
difficulties of bringing two groups together is also necessary. Finally, more knowledge 
is needed about how culture affects intergroup conflict and how interventions need to 
be adjusted in cross-cultural situations.21 Growing knowledge and theory suggest that 
conflict can be either functional or dysfunctional, depending on the circumstances. 
Further research is needed to identify when conflict should be intensified and when it 
should be reduced.
LARGE-GROUP INTERVENTIONS
The third systemwide process intervention is called large-group intervention. Such 
change programs have been referred to variously as “search conferences,” “open￾space meetings,” “open-systems planning,” “world cafés,” “future searches,” “decision 
accelerators,” and “Appreciative Inquiry Summits.”22 They focus on issues that affect 
the whole organization or large segments of it, such as developing new products or 
services, responding to environmental change, redesigning the organization, or intro￾ducing new technology. The defining feature of large-group intervention is the bring￾ing together of large numbers of organization members and other stakeholders, often 
more than a hundred, for a two- to four-day meeting or conference. Here, conference 
attendees work together to identify and resolve organizationwide problems, to design 
new approaches to structuring and managing the firm, or to propose future directions 
for the organization. Large-group interventions are among the fastest-growing OD 
applications in large part because they reflect the core values of OD, including inclu￾sion, participation, and learning.23
Large-group interventions can vary on several dimensions, including purpose, size, 
length, structure, and number. The purpose of these change methods can include cre￾ating the future and setting direction, redefining work, organization structures, and 
systems, and planning or solving particular organizational problems.24 Large-group 
interventions have been run with groups of less than 50 to more than 2,000 partici￾pants and have lasted between one and five days. Some large-group processes are rela￾tively planned and structured; others are more informal. Some interventions involve 
a single large-group meeting; others include a succession of meetings to accomplish 
systemwide change in a short period of time.
Despite these differences, most large-group interventions have similar conceptual 
foundations and methods.25 These interventions have evolved over the past 30 years

Improving Intergroup Relationships in 
Johnson & Johnson’s Drug Evaluation 
Department
Johnson & Johnson (J&J) is one of the world’s 
largest manufacturers of health care products. 
The fundamental objective of the company is to 
provide scientifically sound, high-quality products 
and services to help heal the sick, cure disease, and 
improve the quality of life. In mid-2000, J&J made 
a strategic decision to merge two research and 
development organizations in the Pharmaceuticals 
Group. Departments in the Robert Wood Johnson 
Pharmaceutical Research Institute, headquar￾tered in New Jersey, and the Janssen Research 
Foundation, headquartered in Belgium, were inte￾grated to create a leading-edge global function 
called the Drug Evaluation (DE) organization. DE’s 
purpose is to rapidly generate data that allows J&J 
to make the best investment decisions about the 
drug portfolio. In the overall R&D process, the 
group is the bridge between discovery of new 
compounds and full development of a new drug. 
As a group, they are responsible for investigating 
all compounds that may be potential new products 
and making data-driven decisions in collaboration 
with the discovery and full-development groups. 
The highest-quality and highest-potential discov￾ery compounds are quickly and efficiently moved 
through preclinical development and into initial 
human trials. DE employees experience a genu￾ine and unique opportunity to shape the R&D 
pipeline in J&J and ultimately influence patient 
well-being. It is an exciting and challenging place 
to be in.
Most of the first half of 2001 was spent in merger 
and integration activity with the groups, while 
moving compounds through the pipeline. The DE 
management team has overall responsibility for 
the organization and consists of the global head of 
DE and seven direct reports representing chemical 
pharmaceuticals, clinical drug evaluation, clinical 
operations, and portfolio planning and resource 
management (PPRM), among others.
One of the groups, the PPRM group was a new 
function created to improve the efficiency of DE 
processes. They allowed the DE management team 
to accurately track compounds as they moved 
through the process and provided information in 
a consistent manner across the organization. The 
group consisted of project champions, portfolio 
planners, resource managers, and support staff. 
Project champions were the core of the PPRM 
group. When a compound is accepted into DE, the 
project champion leads a project team consisting of 
representatives from the different functions. This 
team is responsible for planning and executing the 
DE plan for their compound. The project champion 
works closely with all of the functions to ensure 
the compound progresses on schedule through the 
different stages of the process and ultimately on the 
handoff to full development.
The Clinical Drug Evaluation group was responsi￾ble for developing clinical plans that would take the 
new drug compound into human trials. The group 
consisted primarily of clinical scientists, MDs who 
were responsible for focusing on the key questions 
to be identified to achieve DE deliverables. Clinical 
scientists were also responsible for communicating 
these questions and the results from the clinical 
aspects of the project to the rest of the project team. 
The quality of the data depends on asking the right 
questions, so this role is critical to delivering busi￾ness benefits of the compound.
In the fall of 2001, the DE management team 
expressed concern that there were many issues 
surfacing about the nature of the work, roles and 
responsibilities, and the general cohesion within 
DE. This was particularly true with the clinical 
scientists and the project champions. They wor￾ried that a conflict between the schedule-oriented 
project champions and the quality-oriented clinical 
specialists was hurting department morale. The DE 
management team asked an OD practitioner to help 
with understanding and addressing these issues. 
As part of the process, the practitioner conducted 
diagnostic interviews with various members of the 
PPRM and Clinical Drug Evaluation groups. She 
found that opinions varied widely as to the nature 
of the problem and its characteristics. For example, 
some people did not perceive a problem, some 
believed it had nothing to do with the interaction 286 PART 3 Human Process Interventions
of the project champions and the clinical scientists, 
and others believed it was a lack of clear roles and 
responsibilities. Overall, seven different themes 
emerged from the data, although no single issue 
dominated. Faced with this lack of agreement on 
the issue and its causes, the practitioner, in col￾laboration with the different groups, proposed a 
three-day off-site meeting to work through the 
data and concerns.
The meeting was held in January 2002 in Villars, 
Switzerland (selected for its neutrality), and con￾sisted of exercises to improve communications and 
a process to address intergroup conflict. Members 
of the PPRM and Clinical Drug Evaluation groups 
were asked to address the following questions:
• What do we want from you?
• What we don’t want from you?
• What do we offer/give you?
• What we don’t offer/give you?
Each group was asked to discuss and come to con￾sensus about their perceptions of the other group. 
Reflecting the diagnostic data, there was a lively 
discussion within each group as perceptions were 
shared, discussed, and resolved.
When each group presented their results, typical 
responses included the following: “We want your 
expertise;” “We want everyone to be a part of the 
team;” “We want input, support and agreement, 
adequate time, and frequent interaction.” The 
groups did not want surprise decisions, delayed or 
filtered information, and responsibility for anoth￾er’s job. These themes were consistent across both 
groups.
The practitioner then opened the floor for a large￾group discussion of the presentations. Although 
a variety of issues were discussed and clarified, 
the groups noticed that they were in 90% agree￾ment. The key issue that needed to be resolved 
was the decision-making process. The practitioner 
then facilitated a discussion of how the two groups 
should make decisions and they agreed on a method 
to do so.
As a result of the meeting, the two groups reported 
improved relations and increased trust because of 
an increased understanding of each other’s per￾spectives. They developed positive, cooperative 
attitudes toward the other group, understood how 
different cultural backgrounds and working styles 
were contributing to the strained decision-making 
process, and were able to reach agreement on a 
variety of important roles and responsibilities. In 
addition, a few weeks after the meeting, the partic￾ipants said they realized the importance of setting 
the time aside to work through the issues. They 
gained an appreciation for a need to have consist￾ency in methods and tools for the teams. The DE 
management team was pleased with the results.
and represent a combination of open-systems thinking, participation and social con￾struction, and self management. Open-systems thinking, as outlined in Chapter 5, 
directs attention to how organizations interact with and are shaped by their environ￾ments. Proponents of large-group interventions suggest that an organ ization’s current 
state is the result of the intentional and unintentional interaction among many groups 
and individuals both inside and outside the organization. Changing the organization’s 
vision, structure, strategy, or work therefore requires the deliberate, face-to-face co￾ordination of these groups.
The participation and social construction assumptions support the open-systems 
view. The participation assumption suggests that a variety of organization stakeholders 
must be involved to create an accurate view of the environment and organization. The 
social construction assumption suggests that only by developing a shared understand￾ing of the environment and the organization among these stakeholders can “common 
ground” be found and coordinated action be possible. Without a broad and shared 
view, conflicts can arise about what parts of the environment or what actions are most CHAPTER 13 Organization Process Approaches 287
important. Such perceptual disagreements make planning and implementing a coher￾ent strategy difficult.26
Finally, the self-management assumption proposes that large-group processes must 
create the conditions for ownership and commitment. All large-group methods attempt 
to create a rhythm of large-group presentations balanced against small-group discus￾sions, exercises, tasks, and dialogues. Through the small-group work, participants work 
with a variety of stakeholders, build perspective, and become commited to action.
Application Stages
Conducting a large-group intervention generally involves preparing for the meeting, 
conducting it, and following up on outcomes. These activities are described below.
Preparing for the Large-Group Meeting A design team comprising OD practitioners 
and several organization members is formed to organize the event. The team gener￾ally addresses three key ingredients for successful large-group meetings: a compelling 
meeting theme, appropriate participants, and relevant tasks to address the theme.
Compelling meeting theme. Large-group interventions require a compelling 
reason or focal point for change. Although “people problems” can be an important 
focus, more powerful reasons for large-group efforts include managing impending 
mergers or reorganizations, responding to environmental threats and opportuni￾ties, or proposing radical organizational changes.27 Whatever the focal point for 
change, senior leaders need to make clear to others the purpose of the large-group 
meeting. Ambiguity about the reason for the intervention can dissipate partici￾pants’ energy and commitment to change. For example, a large-group meeting 
that successfully envisioned a hospital’s future organization design was viewed as a 
failure by a few key managers who thought that the purpose was to cut costs from 
the hospital’s budget. Their subsequent lack of support stalled the change effort.
Appropriate participants. A fundamental goal of large-group interventions is 
to “get the whole system in the room.” This involves inviting as many people as 
possible who have a stake in the conference theme and who are energized and 
committed to conceiving and initiating change. Senior managers, suppliers, union 
leaders, internal and external customers, trade-group representatives, government 
and regulatory officials, and organization members from a variety of jobs, genders, 
races, and ages are potential participants.
Relevant tasks to address the conference theme. As described below, these 
tasks typically are assigned to several subgroups responsible for examining the 
theme and drawing conclusions for action. Generally, participants rely on their 
own experience and expertise to address systemwide issues, rather than drawing 
on resources from outside of the large-group meeting. This ensures that the meet￾ing can be completed within the allotted time and that members can participate 
fully as important sources of information.
Conducting the Meeting The flow of events in a large-group meeting can vary 
greatly, depending on its purpose and the framework adopted. Most large-group pro￾cesses, however, fit within three primary frameworks: open-systems methods, open￾space methods, and positive methods. These various methods reflect different strategies 
for dealing with the four key dilemmas of large-group interventions:
The dilemma of voice refers to the problem of encouraging participation on the 
one hand and being overwhelmed if each individual wants to speak. Even when 
a large-group event is relatively small in terms of participants, time would quickly 
run out if everyone wanted to speak up in the large group.

1.288 PART 3 Human Process Interventions
The dilemma of structure refers to how tightly or loosely the meeting should be orga￾nized. Some methods, like the open-systems processes described below, can be tightly 
controlled while others, like the open-space methods, are almost unstructured. The 
dilemma is not knowing how much structure a particular group prefers, how much 
they want, or how much anxiety they are experiencing.
The egocentric dilemma refers to the problem of people holding on to their own 
personal views of right or wrong, better or worse. When individuals hold on too 
tightly, it makes large-group decision making difficult. When a large-group event 
overly represents one stakeholder group, that group can dominate the conversa￾tion and be less open to alternative points of view.
The dilemma of emotional contagion refers to a group dynamic where many 
people take on the frustrations or excitement of others. When emotional conta￾gion happens, people unconsciously give up their ownership of a problem, action, 
or solution and get swept up in the moment. It represents a large-group version 
of “groupthink” and can result in solutions that people, upon reflection, cannot 
support.
Open-Systems Methods. A variety of large-group approaches, such as search confer￾ences, open-systems planning, decision accelerators, and real-time strategic change, 
have their basis in open-systems methods and are among the more structured large￾group processes. These approaches help organizations assess their environments 
systematically and develop strategic responses to them. They help organization mem￾bers develop a strategic mission for relating to the environment and influencing it in 
favorable directions. Open-systems methods begin with a diagnosis of the existing 
environment and how the organization relates to it. They proceed to develop possible 
future environments and action plans to bring them about.28 These steps are described 
below.
Map the current environment surrounding the organization. In this step, 
the different domains or parts of the environment are identified and prioritized. 
This involves listing all external groups directly interacting with the organization, 
such as customers, suppliers, or government agencies, and ranking them in impor￾tance. Participants then are asked to describe each domain’s expectations for the 
organization’s behavior.
Assess the organization’s responses to environmental expectations. This 
step asks participants to describe how the organization currently addresses the 
environmental expectations identified in step 1.
Identify the core mission of the organization. This step helps to identify the 
underlying purpose or core mission of the organization, as derived from how it 
responds to external demands. Attention is directed at discovering the mission 
as it is revealed in the organization’s behavior, not as it is pronounced in the 
organization’s official statement of purpose. This is accomplished by examining the 
organization and environment transactions identified in steps 1 and 2 and then 
assessing the values that seem to underlie those interactions. These values provide 
clues about the actual identity or mission of the organization.
Create a realistic future scenario of environmental expectations and orga￾nization responses. This step asks members to project the organization and its 
environment into the near future, assuming no real changes in the organization. 
It asks participants to address the question, “What will happen if the organization 
continues to operate as it does at present?” Participant responses are combined to 
develop a likely organization future under the assumption of no change.
Create an ideal future scenario of environmental expectations and organi￾zation responses. Members are asked to create alternative, desirable futures. This

5.CHAPTER 13 Organization Process Approaches 289
involves going back to steps 1, 2, and 3 and asking what members ideally would 
like to see happen in the near future in both the environment and the organiza￾tion. People are encouraged to fantasize about desired futures without worrying 
about possible constraints.
Compare the present with the ideal future and prepare an action plan for 
reducing the discrepancy. This last step identifies specific actions that will move 
both the environment and the organization toward the desired future. Planning 
for appropriate interventions typically occurs in three timeframes: tomorrow, six 
months from now, and two years from now. Participants also decide on a follow￾up schedule for sharing the flow of actions and updating the planning process.
There are a number of variations on this basic model, each of which follows a similar 
pattern of creating common ground, discussing the issues, and devising an agenda for 
change. For example, search conferences begin with an exercise called “appreciating 
the past,” which asks participants to examine the significant events, milestones, and 
highlights of the organization’s previous 30 years (or less, in the case of newer organiza￾tions).29 It demonstrates that participants share a common history, although they may 
come from different organizations, departments, age groups, or hierarchical levels.
Once common ground is established, members can discuss the systemwide issue 
or theme. To promote widespread participation, members typically organize into sub￾groups of 8–10 people representing as many stakeholder viewpoints as possible. The 
subgroups may address a general question (for example, “What are the opportunities 
for new business in our global market?”) or focus on a specific issue (for example, 
“How can we improve quality and cut costs on a particular product line?”). Subgroup 
members brainstorm answers to these questions, record them on flipchart paper, and 
share them with the larger group. The whole group compares responses from the sub￾groups and identifies common themes. Other methods, such as presentations to the 
large group, small-group meetings on particular aspects of the conference theme, or 
spontaneous meetings of interest to the participants, are used to discuss the conference 
theme and distribute information to members.
The final task of large-group meetings based on open-systems methods is creating 
an agenda for change. Participants are asked to reflect on what they have learned at 
the meeting and to suggest changes for themselves, their department, and the whole 
organization. Members from the same department often are grouped together to dis￾cuss their proposals and decide on action plans, timetables, and accountabilities. Action 
items for the total organization are referred to a steering committee that addresses 
organizationwide policy issues and action plans. At the conclusion of the large-group 
meeting, the departmental subgroups and the steering committee report their conclu￾sions to all participants and seek initial commitment to change.
Application 13.3 describes the large-group decision accelerator process at Alegent 
Health. The decision accelerator model was used to generate an innovative vision and 
strategy for the key clinical areas within the health care system. It followed an open￾systems model to design and implement its large-group meeting.
Open-Space Methods. The second approach to large-group interventions attempts to 
address the four dilemmas by imposing a minimal level of formal structure. Open￾space methods temporarily restructure or “self-organize” participants around interests 
and topics associated with the conference theme. They generally follow these steps:30
Set the conditions for self-organizing. In the first step, the OD practi tioner or 
manager responsible for the large-group intervention sets the stage by announcing 
the theme of the session and the norms that will govern it. In addition, participants 
are informed that the meeting will consist of small-group discussions convened by

1.application 13.3Using the Decision Accelerator to Generate 
Innovative Strategies in Alegent’s Women’s 
and Children’s Service Line
The applications in Chapters 4, 7, and 11 described 
the process of entry, contracting, data collection, 
and evaluation in a large-group intervention at 
Alegent Health. In this application, we describe 
the Women’s and Children’s Right Track Decision 
Accelerator workshop. It was one of the initial six 
DAs intended to set a vision and strategy for the 
clinical service areas within the health system.
The Alegent Health (AH) organization is a large 
health care system in Eastern Nebraska and Western 
Iowa. It has five large hospitals and a variety of out￾patient clinics. As part of the change agenda from 
the new CEO, Wayne Sensor, a Chief Innovation 
Officer, Ted Schwab, was hired to lead in the 
development of a transformed health care system. 
Under a corporate vision that included achieving 
“world-class leadership in compassionate, faith￾based health services that measurably enriches the 
lives of families we serve through an exceptional 
commitment to quality,” Schwab engaged two OD 
consultants from California, Joel Fadem and Stu 
Winby. Fadem was a professor at UCLA who spe￾cialized in health care organizations, and Winby 
was a former internal OD consultant at Hewlett 
Packard, where he had innovated on large-group 
interventions during the HP–Compaq merger (see 
Application 10.4). Together, Schwab, Fadem, and 
Winby worked with other members of AH to 
decide on the use of large-group interventions as 
a way to generate innovative thinking, strategies, 
and decision making in the organization.
The strategic innovation process was kicked off in 
June 2005, with six large-group “decision accelera￾tors,” one for each of the clinical service lines. A 
decision accelerator is similar to other large-group 
interventions, especially those based on open￾systems thinking. It has two unique attributes that 
distinguish it from the others. First, a DA is more 
than a process; it is a physical space. Alegent Health 
not only committed to the large-group intervention 
as a method for innovation, it committed physical 
resources to maximizing the impact of the work. 
The organization leased half a floor of an office 
building in Omaha, gutted the offices, and built a 
completely flexible facility to support the DA proc￾ess (see figure below). Each DA space is designed 
to fit the situation and organization needs, but has 
several things in common. The primary working 
space is completely flexible with moveable white 
boards where small groups record their outputs and 
discussions, moveable chairs, and so on. Alegent’s 
DA space had a unique feature that proved to be 
a favorite among the participants. All of the walls 
in the space could be written on with erasable 
markers. That is, the walls of the room—and there 
was a lot of wall space—could host planned or 
impromptu meetings where the group members 
could draw what they were thinking.
Second, the DA, like other large-group interven￾tions, assumes that by getting the “whole system 
in the room,” a richer, more complete conversation 
and better decisions ensue. However, the DA does 
not assume that “all” of the necessary or available 
information is in the room and so most DA spaces 
include some kind of library with Internet-enabled 
computer terminals and other source documenta￾tion (e.g., white papers, articles, books) that might 
inform the discussion during the DA.
The Women’s and Children’s (W&C) DA was the 
fourth one conducted at AH. The agenda for the 
W&C DA was similar to others, but Fadem and 
Winby worked with the VP in charge of the clini￾cal area, Joan Neuhaus, to modify some of the 
activities to fit with the challenges, opportunities, 
and existing features of the W&C service line. For 
example, Joan wanted the group to address the 
handling of high-risk pregnancies and deliveries 
as well as thinking about women’s health issues 
more broadly. Also as part of the preparation, 
Steve Houston, who directed the facility, put 
together his team of support staff, including note 
takers who transcribed large-group discussions 
and report-outs, photographers who captured 
all small-group outputs, a graphic facilitator who 
recorded the large-group conversations in a visual 
format, and catering for the meeting. The support 
staff played a critical role in the success of a DA 
by knowing the agenda well enough to position CHAPTER 13 Organization Process Approaches 291
the physical facility in advance of any activity 
so that the participants needed only to focus on 
the content of the meeting. This included hav￾ing handouts, instructions, surveys, and other 
documents prepared in advance, which made it 
possible to handle any immediate requests from 
the facilitators.
On Day one, the participants arrived to a light 
breakfast and were immediately given a task. Using 
the white boards that were in front of the large￾group meeting space, called the theater, each par￾ticipant in the workshop was to find a marker and 
to write down the events, forces, trends, and inno￾vations that they knew of or heard about in seven 
different categories (e.g., technology, medicine/
health care, society, the economy, globally, eco￾logically, and in education). The white boards had 
been prepared in advance by Houston’s team with 
the seven categories and with each white board 
representing a particular time period: 1975–1990, 
1991–2005, and 2006–2020. After about fifteen 
minutes, the participants were asked to find two 
people they didn’t know and the trio had to share 
the things they had written down.
Following the environmental scanning activity, 
an introduction and overview of the agenda took 
place. The CEO welcomed the participants and
encouraged them to talk about the things that would

make Alegent Health a “world-class” organization. 
He referred the group to the corporate vision, 
expressed his commitment to the effort, and said 
he would be back on the last day to hear their ideas 
for creating a world-class W&C service line.
The next few activities asked participants, in small 
groups first and then in large-group report-outs, to 
think about the implications of the environmental 
events on the W&C service line by 2015, what was 
implied by the “world class” part of the Alegent 
Health vision, and the implications “world class” 
had for the W&C clinical area. For each activity, a 
relevant organizing structure was used. For exam￾ple, for discussing the implications of “world class” 
on the W&C clinical area, the groups were broken 
down into stakeholder categories. How might, for 
example, patients, the community, or physicians 
view a world-class W&C service? In each activity, 
the small groups were composed of multiple stake￾holders, including physicians, managers/executives 
from Alegent, patients and families, community 
members, and other stakeholders.
Before the day ended, Winby asked the group a 
question: “If there was one thing that you really 
want to make sure gets addressed at this meeting 
to make it a success for you, what would that 
be?” He had people write their questions on a 
piece of paper and put it into a box as they were 
leaving.
During the debrief after the first day, the facilita￾tors and support team reviewed what went well 
and any processes that needed to be improved, dis￾cussed the energy and interests of the participants, 
and sorted the “what’s most important” questions 
into similar themes in preparation for an activity 
on Day two.
Day two began with a welcome from Neuhaus and 
then the group went to work. The first activity was 
to take the work from the Day one W&C visioning 
activities and prioritize the different elements. The 
group was questioned as to what, for them, were 
the most important dimensions of a world-class 
W&C service line? In addition, the group was led 
through an exercise to determine if there were any 
technologies or regulatory events that would fun￾damentally alter the way health care was delivered 
in this area. The group discussed, for example, the 
implications of being able to deliver a child that 
was less than 20 weeks old.
In the next exercise, the facilitators asked the 
group to address the questions they had asked 
at the end of Day one. The questions had been 
categorized into six areas, including gaps in the 
community’s health care, women’s health service 
offerings, and obstetrics among others. The partici￾pants were allowed to sign up to discuss whatever 
subject interested them. In the report-out of the 
groups, an important issue that had been sim￾mering throughout Day one was surfaced. That 
is, should high-risk pregnancies and deliveries be 
centralized to one hospital and what would that 
imply? The large group debated this subject from 
a variety of perspectives. In the end, it was agreed 
that such a move made sense from the world-class 
perspective, but that it would be difficult to imple￾ment and would face much resistance.
The final activity asked the participants to synthe￾size their discussions and activities into a high-level 
“horizons map.” That is, for each of the major 
categories that had been discussed, including wom￾en’s health, obstetrics, child/adolescent medicine, 
and community health, the group was to lay out 
the key decisions, milestones, and events that 
would need to take place over the next 18 months, 
by 2010, and by 2015 to realize their vision of a 
world-class W&C clinical area.
On Day three, the senior leadership team from 
Alegent Health joined the group and listened to 
a presentation of the horizon map. The graphic 
facilitator drew the final horizons map with pic￾tures, words, and symbols, and this was used 
as the outline for the presenters. Following the 
presentations, the executives asked questions and 
discussed some of the group’s decisions. In addi￾tion, they laid out the “next steps” of the process, 
including gathering the data from all of the clini￾cal area DAs in order to resource the strategies 
appropriately.CHAPTER 13 Organization Process Approaches 293
the participants and addressing any topic they believe critical to the theme of the 
conference. Two sets of norms govern how open-space methods are applied, and 
although the norms may sound ambiguous, they are critical to establishing the 
conditions for a successful meeting.
The first set of norms concerns the “Law of Two Feet.” It encourages people to 
take responsibility for their own behavior—to go to meetings and discussions where 
they are learning, contributing, or in some way remaining interested. Moving 
from group to group is legitimized by the roles of “butterflies” and “bumblebees.” 
Butterflies attract others into spontaneous conversations and, in fact, may never 
attend a formal meeting. Bumblebees go from group to group and sprinkle knowl￾edge, information, or new ideas into different meetings.
The second set of norms is labeled the “Four Principles.” The first principle is 
“whoever comes is the right people.” It is intended to free people to begin conver￾sations with anyone at any time. It also signals that the quality of a conversation 
is what’s most important, not who’s involved. The second principle, “Whatever 
happens is the only thing that could have,” infuses the group with responsibil￾ity, encourages participants to be flexible, and prepares them to be surprised. 
“Whenever it starts is the right time” is the third principle and is aimed at encour￾aging creativity and following the natural energy in the group. The final principle, 
“When it is over, it is over,” allows people to move on and not feel like they have 
to meet for a certain time period or satisfy someone else’s requirements.
2. Create the agenda. The second step in open-space interventions is to develop a 
road map for the remainder of the conference. This is accomplished by asking partic￾ipants to describe a topic related to the conference theme that they have passion for 
and interest in discussing. This topic is written on a large piece of paper, announced 
to the group, and then posted on the community bulletin board where meeting top￾ics and locations are displayed.31 The person announcing the topic agrees to convene 
the meeting at the posted time and place. This process continues until everyone who 
wants to define a topic has been given the chance to speak. The final activity in this 
step asks participants to sign up for as many of the sessions as they have interest in. 
The open-space meeting begins with the first scheduled sessions.
3. Coordinate activity through information. During an open-space session, there 
are two ways to coordinate activities. First, each morning and evening a commu￾nity meeting is held to announce new topics that have emerged for which meet￾ing dates and times have been assigned, or to share observations and learnings. 
Second, as the different meetings occur, the conveners produce one-page summa￾ries of what happened, who attended, what subjects were discussed, and what rec￾ommendations or actions were proposed. Typically, this is done on computer in a 
room dedicated for this purpose. These summaries are posted near the community 
bulletin board in an area often labeled “newsroom.” Participants are encouraged to 
visit the newsroom and become familiar with what other groups have been discuss￾ing. The summaries also can be printed and copied for conference participants.
Positive Methods. The final large-group intervention represents a hybrid approach to the 
four dilemmas. It is distinguished from the other two methods by its use of the positive 
approach to change described in Chapter 2. In fact, many of the futuring and visioning 
exercises in the open-sytems approaches that help guide members in creating “images 
of potential” toward which the organization can grow and develop are drawn from this 
approach.32 These methods can increase members’ energy for change and build a broad 
consensus toward a new future. Like other large-group methods, these approaches can 
help look at a variety of organizational issues; however, their distinguishing feature is 
the “appreciative” framing of issues and the leveraging of the organization’s positive 
core attributes. The Appreciative Inquiry (AI) Summit approach suggests that human 294 PART 3 Human Process Interventions
organizing and change should be a relational process of inquiry, grounded in affirma￾tion and appreciation.33 The four-steps in an AI summit are as follows:
Discover the organization’s positive core. With respect to the purpose of the 
summit, participants first pair up with another person and conduct an appreciative 
interview. If the summit is organized to take advantage of a new market oppor￾tunity, the questions would generate stories about experiences where a group or 
organization was most successful in being entrepreneurial and swift. If the summit 
were about addressing poor organization coordination, the questions and stories 
would be personal experiences where two or more groups worked well together.
Following the interviews, the pairs join up with three other pairs to discuss their 
answers to the questions. What is it that is common among all these stories? What 
are the elements of successful entrepreneurship or collaboration, for example? These 
small-group conversations are then aggregated to create a broad and inclusive list of 
success factors and other themes associated with these successful experiences.
2. Dream about and envision a more desired and fulfilling future. In this step, 
participants use the themes and success factors from the first activity to develop 
compelling images of the future. In this visioning exercise, participants are encour￾aged to make bold and provocative propositions about what could be in the future. 
To arrive at a bold vision, small groups share their greatest hopes or act out skits 
and presentations that convey what they believe is possible. Unlike open system 
or open space methods, there is very little proritizing or culling out of the best or 
more compelling themes. The positive approach believes that breadth and inclu￾siveness are the most important way to galvanize organization change.
3. Design the structural and systems arrangements that will best reflect 
and support the vision or dream. Members of the summit identify the design 
features (strategies, structures, systems, processes) that will need to be in place to 
make the vision a reality. This step allows participants to articulate the dream in 
concrete terms.
4. Create the specific action plans that will fulfill the organization’s destiny.
The primary task of destiny step is to identify the projects, initiatives, and action 
plans required to implement the design criteria. Task forces are formed, teams vol￾unteer to take on projects, and any governance mechanisms needed to coordinate 
the effort are created.
Following up on Meeting Outcomes Follow-up efforts are vital to implementing the 
action plans from large-scale interventions. These efforts involve communicating the 
results of the meeting to the rest of the organization, gaining wider commitment to the 
changes, and structuring the change process. In those cases where all the members of 
the organization were involved in the large-group meeting, implementation can pro￾ceed immediately according to the timetable included in the action plans.
Results of Large-Group Interventions
In the past decade, the number of case studies describing the methods and results of 
large-group interventions has increased dramatically. Such interventions have been 
conducted at for-profit firms like Hewlett-Packard, Boeing, Kodak, Microsoft, Motorola, 
Marriott, and Rockport, and at such governmental and nongovernmental organiza￾tions as Save the Children, World Vision, the City of Carlsbad, California, and the US 
Department of Agriculture. Large-group interventions are increasingly common in 
other countries, including Pakistan, South Africa, China, Australia, England, Mexico, 
and India.34 Despite the proliferation of practice, however, Purser and Griffin lament 
that “empirical research, such as longitudinal studies, quasi-experimental field stud￾ies, and studies of large sample sizes across a wide variety of LGIs are severely lacking.

Data that is available tends to be anecdotal or single case studies from practitioners and 
consultants who have a commercial stake in promoting their own methods.”35 Yaeger, 
Sorensen, and Bengtsson’s review of AI supports this criticism. Of the 34 reported 
empirical evaluations of the AI Summit approach, all of them were case studies.36
Because these change efforts often set the stage for subsequent OD interventions, it 
is difficult to isolate their specific results from those of the other changes. Anecdotal 
evidence from practitioners and case studies suggest that benefits can include increased 
energy toward organizational change, improved feelings of community, ability to 
see “outside the box,” increased speed of change, and improved relationships with 
stakeholders.37 In addition, several case studies have documented improved business 
outcomes, such as decreased turnover, absenteeism, and costs.38 Clearly, systematic 
research is needed on this important systemwide process intervention.
SUMMARY
This chapter described three types of systemwide process interventions: confrontation 
meetings, intergroup interventions, and large-group interventions. The organization con￾frontation meeting is a way of mobilizing resources for organizational problem solving 
and seems especially relevant for organizations undergoing stress. The intergroup relations 
approaches are designed to help solve a variety of organizational problems. Microcosm 
groups can be formed to address particular issues and use parallel processes to diffuse 
group solutions to the organization. The intergroup conflict resolution approach involves a 
method for mitigating dysfunctional conflicts between groups or departments. Conflict can 
be dysfunctional in situations in which groups must work together. It may, however, pro￾mote organizational effectiveness when departments are relatively independent of each 
other. Large-group interventions are designed to focus the energy and attention of a “whole 
system” around organizational processes such as a vision, strategy, organization design, or 
culture. It is best used when the organization is about to begin a large-scale change effort 
or is facing a new situation. These three process interventions represent important, time￾honored, and successful methods of introducing change in organizations.296 PART 3 Human Process Interventions

Soon after the election of a new chief of 
surgery, the president of Lincoln Hospital 
faced a crisis. Lincoln, a 400-bed for-profit 
hospital in the southwestern United States, 
was experiencing severe problems in its oper￾ating room (OR). Forty percent of the OR 
nurses had quit during the previous eight 
months. Their replacements were significantly 
less experienced, especially in the specialty 
areas. Furthermore, not all could be replaced; 
when the crisis came to a head, the OR was 
short seven surgical nurses.
Also, needed equipment often was not 
available. On several occasions, orthopedic 
surgeons had already begun surgery before 
they realized the necessary prosthesis (for 
example, an artificial hip, finger joint, or knee 
joint) was not ready, or was the wrong size, 
or had not even been ordered. Surgery then 
had to be delayed while equipment was bor￾rowed from a neighboring hospital. Other 
serious problems also plagued the OR. For 
example, scheduling problems made life 
extremely difficult for everyone involved. 
Anesthesiologists often were unavailable 
when they were needed, and habitually tardy 
surgeons delayed everyone scheduled after 
them. The nursing shortage exacerbated these 
difficulties by requiring impossibly tight 
scheduling; even when the doctors were 
ready to begin, the scheduled nurses might 
still be occupied in one of the other operating 
rooms.
The surgeons were at odds among themselves. 
Over 30 of them were widely regarded as 
prima donnas who considered their own time 
more valuable than anyone else’s and would 
even create emergencies in order to get “prime 
time” OR slots—for which, as often as not, 
they were late. Worst of all, however, the 
doctors and nurses were virtually at war. 
Specifically, Don, the new chief of surgery, 
was at war with Mary, the veteran OR 
director; indeed, he had campaigned on a 
promise to get her fired.
Lincoln’s president was faced with a difficult 
choice. On the one hand, he needed to satisfy 
the physicians, who during the tenure of his 
predecessor had become accustomed to getting 
their way in personnel matters by thr eatening 
to take their patients elsewhere. The market 
was, as the physicians knew, incre asingly 
competitive, and the hospital was also faced 
with escalating costs, changes in government 
regulations, and strict Joint Commission on 
Accreditation of Hospitals standards. Could the 
president afford to alienate the surgeons by 
opposing their newly chosen representative—
who had a large practice of his own?
On the other hand, could he afford to sacrifice 
Mary? She had been OR director for 13 years, 
and he was generally satisfied with her. As he 
later explained,
Mary is a tough lady, and she can be hard to 
get along with at times. She also doesn’t 
smile all that much. But she does a lot of 
things right. She consistently stays within 
her budget . . . .
Furthermore, whereas Don had long been an 
outspoken critic of the hospital and was gen￾erally distrusted by its administrators, Mary 
was loyal, a strict constructionist who adhered 
firmly to hospital policies and procedures:
She is supportive of me, of the hospital, and 
of our interests. She doesn’t let the doctors 
get away with much. She has been an almost 
faultless employee for years, in the sense 
that she comes to work, gets the job done, 
never complains, and doesn’t make any 
waves. I really don’t understand the reason 
for the recent problems. I trust her and want 
to keep her. It would be extremely difficult 
to replace her.
The last point was a key one; a sister hospital 
had spent almost three years unsuccessfully 
trying to recruit an OR director.
Lincoln Hospital: Third-Party Intervention298 PART 3 Human Process Interventions
After talking with both nurses and doctors, 
the president decided not to fire Mary. Instead, 
he told both Mary and Don that they must 
resolve their differences. They were to begin 
meeting right away and keep on meeting, 
however long it took, until they got the OR 
straightened out.
The results were predictable. Neither party 
wanted to meet with the other. Mary thought 
the whole exercise was pointless, and Don saw 
it as a power struggle that he could not afford 
to lose. The president, who wanted an observer 
present, chose Terry, the new executive vice 
president and chief operating officer. Mary 
didn’t know Terry very well so she asked that 
her boss, the vice president of patient services, 
sit in. Don, who “didn’t trust either Mary or 
her boss as far as he could throw them,” 
countered with a request for a second of his 
own, the vice president for medical services. 
When the meeting finally occurred, it quickly 
degenerated into a free-for-all, as Don and 
Mary exchanged accusations, hotly defended 
themselves, and interpreted any interventions 
by the three “observers” as “ taking sides.”
DIAGNOSIS
At this point, Lincoln’s president called me. We 
negotiated a psychological contract, where the 
president shared the above historical informa￾tion, described the problem as he saw it, and 
identified his expectations of me and for the 
project. I, in turn, articulated my expectations of 
the president. We then agreed to take no steps 
until I had interviewed both Don and Mary.
Later that afternoon, Don expressed his anger 
and frustration with the hospital administra￾tion and, most of all, with Mary:
I don’t want to have anything to do with this 
lady. She is a lousy manager. Her people 
can’t stand to work with her. We don’t have 
the equipment or the supplies that we need. 
The turnover in the OR is outrageous. The 
best nurses have quit, and their replacements 
don’t know enough to come in out of the 
rain. . . . All we want is to provide quality 
patient care, and she refuses to let us do that. 
She doesn’t follow through on things.
He particularly resented Mary’s lack of 
deference.
Mary’s behavior is so disgraceful it is almost 
laughable. She shows no respect whatsoever 
for the physicians. . . . She thinks she can tell 
us what to do and order us around; and I am 
not going to put up with it any longer. When 
I agreed to take this job as chief of surgery, 
I promised my colleagues that I would clean 
up the mess that has plagued the OR for 
years. I have a mandate from them to do 
whatever is necessary to accomplish that. 
The docs are sick and tired of being abused, 
and I am going to deal with this lady head 
on. If we got rid of her, 95 percent of our 
problems would go away. She has just gone 
too far this time.
In his cooler moments, Don admitted that 
Mary was only partly to blame for the OR’s 
problems, but he still insisted she must be fired, 
if only to prove to the doctors that the hospital 
administration was concerned about those 
problems, and that something was being done.
Observation: I am always a bit suspicious 
about the objectivity of someone who has 
reached the conclusion that someone must 
be fired. There is almost always something 
else that is going on that requires more 
investigation.
Mary was both angry and bewildered. She 
saw herself as fair and consistent in dealing 
with doctors and nurses:
Things had gone relatively well until six 
months ago. At that time, some of the ortho￾pods started scheduling surgeries and then 
canceling them at the last minute, which, in 
turn, fouled up the schedule for the rest of the 
doctors. When I called them on it, Don went 
on a rampage. He is the leader of the pack, 
and now he has blood in his eyes. I have tried 
to talk with him about it, but he won’t listen.SELECTED CASES 299
And just as Don’s assessment echoed, in an 
exaggerated form, the doctors’ perception of 
Mary as an exceptionally strong-willed woman, 
Mary’s assessment of Don echoed his reputa￾tion among the orthopedic nurses and hospital 
administrators, who feared and distrusted his 
quick temper and sharp tongue:
Not only that, but I find his filthy mouth very 
offensive. I am not going to cooperate with 
him when he behaves like that. Nobody else 
talks to me that way and gets away with it. 
Nobody, I won’t put up with it. As long as he 
behaves that way, it is a waste of time to 
meet with him. I am sure that I am doing 
things that bother him, and I want the OR to 
run as smoothly as possible. But there is no 
way we can deal with these problems unless 
we can sit down and talk about them with￾out being abusive.
Clearly, both Mary and Don had strong needs 
to control other people’s behavior, while 
remaining free of control themselves. It is sig￾nificant that each used the word abuse to 
describe the other’s behavior. They did respect 
each other’s technical abilities, but morally, 
Mary saw Don as “an egotistical jerk,” and he 
saw her as a “rigid, petty tyrant.” Neither 
trusted the other, thus, each was inclined to 
misconstrue even unintentionally negative 
comments—an especially disastrous state of 
affairs in the gossipy environment at Lincoln, 
where surgeons, nurses, and administrators 
were quick to relay, and amplify, the signals of 
hostility.
It was obvious from these initial interviews 
that Don and Mary were largely contributing 
to the OR problems; but it was also obvious 
that many others had a stake in the outcome 
of their battle. I therefore went on to inter￾view the surgical head nurses, the vice presi￾dents for patient services and medical services, 
the executive vice president, the president, 
and 25 physicians.
The vice presidents and the surgical head 
nurses agreed with the president: Mary might 
not be the hospital’s most personable manager, 
but she was a good one. Her conservative, 
tenacious, no-nonsense style had earned the 
trust of administrators and the respect of OR 
nurses, as well as some physicians. As one 
nurse asserted: “Good OR managers are hard 
to find and certainly Lincoln is far better off 
with Mary than without her.”
The doctors, in general, supported Don, 
though some of them had reservations. At 
one extreme, an anesthesiologist began with a 
classic disclaimer:
Now, I want you to know that I don’t have 
any problems with Mary, personally. In fact, 
I really like her. We have been friends for 
years, and we get along just great.
Nevertheless, he was convinced the OR 
problems were “100 percent Mary’s fault. I 
have no doubt about that.” Furthermore, 
although he claimed to be, as an anesthesiolo￾gist, “a completely neutral third party in this 
whole business,” he clearly shared Don’s 
assumption that Mary’s job as an OR manager 
was to keep the surgeons happy:
Her people hate her. She is a lousy manager. 
She just can’t work with the MDs. Surgeons 
are a rare breed, and there is no changing 
them. You have got to get someone in there 
who can work with them and give them 
what they want.
His conclusion echoed Don’s: “She ought to 
be fired, if for no other reason than to prove 
that something is being done to address the 
problems in the OR.”
Observation: I am always leery of someone 
who says, “It is all her fault.” When 
someone is blamed for 100 percent of the 
problem, it usually evidences either denial 
or a coverup. There may be a completely 
innocent party in an emotionally charged 
conflict, but I have never met one. 
Emotionally charged conflicts are always 
power struggles, and it takes two parties 
to play that game.300 PART 3 Human Process Interventions
A less enthusiastic partisan, a surgeon who 
was a 10-year veteran of the Lincoln OR, was 
very conscious of the way expectations such 
as those expressed by Don and the anesthesi￾ologist were apt to be viewed by others in the 
medical community:
Quite frankly, I am embarrassed to admit that 
I am a surgeon in this town; by doing so, I am 
automatically branded as an egotistical dim￾wit. With only a few exceptions, those guys 
are a group of conceited, narcissistic techni￾cians who are so caught up with themselves 
that they have no clue about what is going 
on around them. Some of them are bullies, 
and they push the rest of us around because 
we don’t have the patient census they do.
His assessment of blame was correspondingly 
more moderate than the anesthesiologist’s: 
“A lot of people would like you to think that 
this problem is one sided, and that Mary is 
totally responsible for this mess. But that isn’t 
true.” And while he supported Don, whom he 
described as reasonable and willing to listen to 
logic, his principal wish was to avoid personal 
involvement: “I am glad he is fighting this 
battle. I won’t. The thought of getting caught 
between him and Mary scares me to death.”
This last wish was vividly elaborated by 
another surgeon, who also highlighted the 
general perception of Mary as a strong 
personality:
I don’t mess with Mary at all. I’m not stupid. 
It’s true that I don’t like some of the things 
that she does. Sometimes she is just plain 
ornery. But I also am not willing to take her 
on. In fact, at this point, I will do whatever 
she wants, whenever she wants it. If the 
other docs are smart, they won’t mess with 
her either. They can talk big in their meet￾ings, but if they have any sense, they won’t 
mess with that lady. She controls too many 
of the resources I need to do my job. So far 
she has been very helpful, and she has gone 
out of her way to do me some favors. I don’t 
want to mess that up. I think it is great that 
Don is willing to take her on, and I wish him 
success. That way, if she wins, it will be him 
that gets beat up, not me.
The high turnover among OR nurses was a 
particularly sore point among the surgeons 
in general, whose frustration was explained 
by Don:
I don’t think the administration has a clue as 
to how urgent this matter really is. It takes at 
least five years for a surgical nurse to gain the 
necessary skills to be useful. In the last two 
months, we have lost some of the best nurses 
I have ever worked with in my life. As a 
result, I had to start the training process all 
over again. It has seemed like I’ve been 
working with a group of student nurses! This 
turnover has cut my productivity by more 
than 50 percent.
Most of the doctors blamed the high turnover 
on the nursing managers’ inability to retain 
qualified personnel, whereas the managers 
blamed it on the doctors’ verbal abuse. And in 
fact, a significant number of doctors were 
widely regarded by some of their peers as well 
as by the nurses as impatient, intolerant per￾fectionists who demanded far more of others 
than they did of themselves.
From the extended interviews, it was obvious 
that while Mary had greater credibility with 
the hospital administration and Don had 
more backing from the doctors, each had a 
certain amount of power over the other’s 
constituency: Mary controlled the surgeons’ 
working conditions, while Don controlled a 
significant portion of the hospital’s patient 
flow. The OR problems could not be resolved 
without genuine cooperation from both of 
them—especially from Don, who was outside 
the formal hierarchy of the hospital and could 
not be coerced by the president.
I met again privately with each of them to 
determine whether they were honestly com￾mitted to improving their working relation￾ship. Both were skeptical about the possibility 
of real change but said they were willing to do 
everything they could to help, as long as their 
own basic values were not violated. Each 
defined the kind of help he or she was willing 
to accept from me and the circumstances 
under which that help was to be given.SELECTED CASES 301
INTERVENTION
Only at this point did actual third-party 
facilitation intervention begin. I used a design 
that included perception sharing, problem 
identification, contracting, and follow-up 
meetings. At their first formal meeting together 
with me and the three vice presidents who 
acted as observers, Mary and Don began by 
writing answers to three questions:
1. What does he or she do well?
2. What do I think I do that bugs him or her?
3. What does he or she do that bugs me?
The very process of writing things down was 
helpful. It gave them time to get used to this 
explicitly confrontational situation before 
either of them had a chance to “pop off” at the 
other, and it forced an element of rationality 
into an emotionally charged situation. Also, 
the questions required specific answers conc￾erning behaviors, not subjective generalizations 
about personalities. Listing specific behaviors 
made each of them realize that at least some of 
the things they disliked about the other could 
be changed.
They then explained these responses orally, in 
the order shown in Exhibit 1. Because of their 
mutual hostility, I thought it safer to require 
that at first they address their remarks only to 
the third party, not to each other. Each, how￾ever, was required to hear the other’s presen￾tation so each would understand the other’s 
perceptions. And because both were guaran￾teed an uninterrupted speech, each was more 
likely to listen to the other. Taking up the 
positive perceptions first helped. As Don later 
explained:
I was stunned to hear her say those positive 
things, particularly the part about me taking 
care of her family. For a long time, I had seen 
her as my enemy, and I expected only the 
worst. I was amazed that she had so much 
respect for me. As a result, many of my nega￾tive feelings for her began to leave. It is really 
tough to stay angry at someone who says so 
many nice things about you. I also found that 
I was much more willing to listen to what 
I do that bugs her. Somehow, criticism is 
always easier to take when it is accompanied 
by something positive.
It also helped that before making any accusa￾tions against each other, they were required 
to examine their own behavior. As Mary 
acknowledged, neither had ever taken the 
time to figure out specifically how he or she 
might be causing problems for the other:
It had never really occurred to me that I may 
be doing something that caused Don to react 
that way. Vaguely, I suspected that I may be 
doing something that he didn’t like, but I was 
hard pressed to identify what it was. I really 
had to stand back and say to myself, “What is 
it that I am doing that is making this working 
relationship go sour?” I had spent so much 
time concentrating on what he was doing that 
bugged me that I hadn’t looked at myself.
The oral discussion of this question made it 
obvious that neither was intentionally causing 
problems for the other, making both parties 
less hypersensitive to imaginary insults. Also, 
because both were much harder on them￾selves than they were on each other, the 
milder criticisms they did subsequently direct 
at each other were not nearly as offensive as 
they would otherwise have been.
The next step was to identify specific problems 
for Mary and Don to address. They wrote 
their responses to question three on a sheet of 
newsprint, assigning vectors to represent the 
relative seriousness of the problem. Some of 
the most serious problems could be resolved 
immediately; others were going to take lon￾ger, but at least Don and Mary now knew 
what their priorities had to be.
Finally, it became possible for them to agree on 
specific behavioral changes that might help. 
Don and Mary each defined what they wanted 
from the other and negotiated what they them￾selves were willing to undertake; I moderated 
the meeting and wrote down the decisions. 
(At the end of the meeting, Don, Mary, and 
the three observers each received a copy of 
these commitments.) Because Mary and Don 302 PART 3 Human Process Interventions
Participant Responses to Three Questions in the Third-Party 
Facilitation Model
[Exhibit 1]
What does Mary admire about Don and think he does well?
He is very concerned about patient care.
I admire him for his skills as a surgeon. I would have no problem sending a 
member of my family to him.
He is interested and wants to work out issues that we have with each other.
He can be very gentle and considerate at times.
He is well respected for his skills by his peers and by the OR nursing staff.
What does Don admire about Mary and think that she does well?
She is honest in her work.
She has met my needs in orthopedics in getting us the instruments and equipment 
we need.
She has a lot of external pressures on her and she has handled them well.
She deals well with the various groups that are pulling at her: patients, staff, 
administration, physicians.
She manages the overall picture very well in the OR.
What does Don think he does that bugs Mary?
I am impatient. (Mary agrees)
I am demanding of personnel in surgery, but everyone can’t always get what they 
want, when they want it. (Mary disagrees)
She is uncertain as to how much I am willing to support her this coming year. 
(Mary agrees)
I am not the best listener. (Mary agrees)
What does Mary think she does that bugs Don?
I don’t listen to him. (Don agrees)
I appear defensive at times. (Don agrees)
I respond to some directives in a very detailed manner. (Don agrees)
What does Mary do that bugs Don?
She is difficult to communicate with. I can talk to her, but I am not sure that she is 
listening.
She doesn’t assume the responsibility for some specific problems, such as not 
being able to do an operation without a full set of prosthesis available.
She doesn’t effectively manage the personnel that she supervises in OR. 
Specifically, there is a great deal of disruption going on. And there are also morale 
problems, particularly as they relate to their trust of her and her trust of them in 
the OR.
What does Don do that bugs Mary?
He generalizes and is not very specific with examples, even when questioned.
The staff labels him as a whiner, in terms of “nothing is ever right,” his 
complaining, etc. This also relates to laying out problems and then walking away.
He sometimes says one thing but means another—and gives mixed messages. 
An explanation of this is my asking him how things are going, he says fine, but 
then I find out that he has problems later in the day.
I do not feel a full measure of support from him, and that bugs me.
He doesn’t always listen to my concerns.

were interdependent, either could easily have 
sabotaged the other’s efforts. Therefore, in 
defining each action item, I reminded them to 
specify responsibilities for both parties:
What will Don (Mary) do to resolve this 
problem?
What will Mary (Don) do to help the other 
succeed?
This technique made both parties jointly 
responsible for resolving each problem and thus 
changed the whole dynamic of the relationship—
from mutual isolation to collaboration, from 
denial of responsibility to acceptance of respon￾sibility, and from a focus on problems to a focus 
on solutions.
During the next year, I had four more meetings 
with Don, Mary, and the three vice presidents. 
Before each meeting, I interviewed each par￾ticipant privately. At the beginning of each 
meeting, the participants gave general reports 
on what was going on, between Mary and 
Don and in the OR in general. In particular, 
I asked the two to list positive events and 
specific behaviors on each other’s part that

they appreciated. They then reviewed the 
commitments they had made during the pre￾vious meeting. In almost every case, both 
Mary and Don had kept these commitments, 
thus building a basis of trust for further com￾mitments during the latter part of the meeting. 
Where they had not kept the commitments, 
plans were made to ensure follow-through 
before the next meeting.
Questions
If you had been called by Lincoln’s presi￾dent to help resolve the problems described 
in the case, how would you have carried 
out the contracting and diagnosis stages? 
What would you have done differently 
than what the OD consultant did?
Is third-party intervention an appropriate 
intervention in this case? Other possible 
OD interventions?
How effective was the third-party

Greenfield, head Ben & Jerry’s Homemade 
Inc., an independent ice cream producer that 
has gained market share and public approba￾tion against industry competitors Häagen￾Dazs (made by Pillsbury), Frusen Glädjé (made 
by Kraft), and Steve’s. The story of the found￾ers has a romantic, antiestablishment quality 
to it that reads like a new-age entrepreneur’s 
dream.
The “boys,” childhood friends, each dropped 
out of college in the late ’60s, worked at odd 
jobs for a time, and together opened a small 
ice cream scoop shop in Burlington, Vermont, 
in 1978 with scant know-how (they learned 
ice-cream making through a $5 correspon￾dence course) and less capital (they started 
with $12,000—a third of it borrowed). But 
they had something else going for them: a 
combination of old fashioned values and new￾fangled ideas.
Neither Ben nor Jerry had any intention of 
becoming businessmen. From the start, how￾ever, both were committed to making the best 
ice cream possible and to having fun while 
doing it. More than this, these “self-styled 
Vermont hippies,” as the press calls them, were 
committed to the simple notion that business 
draws from the community and is obliged to 
give something back to it. In the early days, 
this meant giving away ice cream to loyal cus￾tomers and worthy charities. As the company 
grew to sales of near $50 million, B&J’s 
embraced what it calls a social mission to 
improve the quality of life—not only of employ￾ees, but also locally, nationally, and 
internationally—and to do so in an innovative 
and upbeat way.
The economics of B&J’s show fast-track 
growth over the past several years character￾istic of very successful startup companies (see 
Exhibit 1 from the 1988 annual report). Sales 
doubled annually from 1984 to 1986 and 
increased nearly 50 percent from 1987 to 
1988. The company is today the super￾premium market leader in Boston and New 
York City and distributes its products in gro￾cery stores and mom-and-pop convenience 
outlets in Florida, the West Coast, and parts 
of the Midwest. Some 80 franchises operate 
scoop shops in these markets, and the 
company’s “pints” manufacturing facility and 
headquarters in Burlington have become 
Vermont’s second-largest tourist attraction 
with over 600,000 visitors annually.
In addition to expanding this facility, B&J’s 
recently built a novelty plant in Springfield, 
Vermont, to manufacture ice-cream brownie 
bars and stick pops and leased space to house 
its marketing, franchising, promotion, and 
art departments. Today, over 350 people 
work at B&J’s. Production runs around the 
clock, staffed by a few dairy experts and 
many more offbeat people who gravitated to 
the company because of competitive wages, 
its funky image, and its social mission. Among 
the production staff is a team of handicapped 
employees who have distinct and important 
responsibilities.
The product side of B&J’s blends what Time
magazine calls “incredibly delicious” ice cream. 
The story goes that Ben has deficient taste 
buds, so products have to be particularly 
pungent to stir his palate. This means “double￾fudge” and “big-chunk” add-ins to the ice 
cream. Funky flavors, like “Cherry Garcia,” an 
assortment of T-shirts, Vermont “cow” 
paraphernalia, and wacky promotions all 
make word-of-mouth marketing the key to 
B&J’s commercial success. And, yes, the 
founders insist on having fun. At annual 
meetings, Jerry, trained in carnival tricks, uses

It is, however, the social mission of B&J’s that 
most distinguishes it from corporate America. 
The good works of the company are many and 
range from regular donations to community 
and social action groups to a commitment to 
buy only Vermont-based cream from area dairy 
cooperatives. B&J’s embraces socially responsi￾ble marketing and has proposed to “adopt a 
stop” in the New York subway system (which 
the company would clean and maintain in lieu 
of advertising) and begun an innovative joint 
SELECTED CASES306 PART 3 Human Process Interventions
venture with the Knowledge Society in the 
Soviet Union.
Recently, the company introduced “Peace 
Pops” as part of the “1% for Peace Campaign.” 
This effort is aimed at encouraging other 
businesses to join a movement urging the gov￾ernment to devote one percent of the defense 
budget explicitly to peaceful purposes. A new 
product featuring Brazilian nuts obtained at 
above-fair-market price from native Brazilians 
is further evidence of the founders’ social 
commitments.
INNOVATING INSIDE OF B&J’S
Ben and Jerry have been at the edge of innova￾tion since the company went public. Rather 
than seeking venture capital to expand the busi￾ness, they drew up a stock prospectus on their 
own and sold shares to Vermonters door to door. 
One in every 100 Vermont families bought in
to the tune of $750,000. When Häagen-Dazs 
tried to pressure shopkeepers to keep “Vermont’s 
finest” off their shelves, Ben and Jerry started a 
grass-roots campaign against Pillsbury replete 
with bumper stickers (What’s the Doughboy 
afraid of?) and a one-person picket line (Jerry) 
at the Pillsbury headquarters.
Ben and Jerry have tried to introduce this same 
funky and socially responsible orientation inside 
the company. The company’s mission and 
many of its policies and practices (see Exhibit 2) 
reflect the upbeat and caring values of the 
founders. A policy of “linked prosperity” ensures 
that 7.5 percent of pretax profits go to good 
works and five percent is returned to employ￾ees via profit sharing. The salary ratio between 
the top paid and least paid in B&J’s is set at five 
to one. This means, if managers want to earn 
more, they have to increase the base wage 
throughout the company.
Employees come in all shapes and sizes. Most 
are young (under 30) and many have respon￾sibilities well beyond their experience. It is a 
matter of pride to all that B&Jer’s can speak, 
act, and dress “like themselves.” Still, the 
work is demanding and the pace frenetic. The 
production room is often awash in cream, 
and the freezer crew works in chilling condi￾tions. There is nothing akin to market research 
in the company, demand is fluid and unpre￾dictable, and when I first arrived on the 
scene, the franchising and sales managers 
weren’t communicating with each other and 
neither paid attention to the marketing 
director.
In 1987, it became evident to Ben and Jerry, 
as well as to managers and employees, that 
the company’s external image—of funk, fun, 
and love—was out of sync with the atmo￾sphere inside the company. The company 
was always short on ice cream and long on 
hours, pressure, and problems. The author 
was commissioned to work with the founders 
and board of directors and with the manage￾ment and work force of the company to 
undertake organizational development and 
bring people, functions, aspirations, and 
directions together.
ENTRY
Henry Morgan, former dean of the School of 
Management at Boston University and board 
member at B&J’s, contacted me about this 
project. Henry comes from a long line of New 
England activists deeply committed to the 
improvement of the human condition. His 
family lineage traces to Hawaii where ancestors 
were missionaries, and Henry has had a career 
as an entrepreneur, management innovator, 
and social investor. In addition to his member￾ship on B&J’s board, he is active on other boards 
and is a leader in the Council of Economic 
Priorities’ efforts to promote corporate social 
responsibility.
Entry through Henry, however, posed some 
risks. For example, like Henry, I was an out￾sider coming into B&J’s where the emphasis, 
to this point, had been on “homegrown” 
innovation. Ben, Jerry, and Jeff Furman, an 
attorney and longtime B&J’s counsel, had SELECTED CASES 307
crafted the company’s innovative employment 
and investment policies. It was unclear to me 
what these three really wanted from an OD 
program. Was I being brought in to get man￾agement “aligned” behind the founders’ guid￾ing precepts as a phone conversation with 
Ben intimated? Or were the precepts them￾selves open to question and modification via 
management and employee input? If so, did it 
require an outsider to stimulate this 
reexamination? Or was I being set up?
To complicate matters, there was a division in 
the board of directors. Ben, Jerry, and Jeff 
were rather more “far out” in their aspirations 
for the company, particularly in comparison 
to the more conservative general manager, 
Fred “Chico” Lager. The former anticipated an 
outpouring of good vibes once “people power” 
was unleashed. Chico had more everyday 
concerns: feuding between management, 
unclear lines of authority and responsibility, a 
lack of operational control. More specifically, 
Ben & Jerry’s Mission and Operating Principles
[Exhibit 2]
Ben & Jerry’s, a Vermont-based ice-cream producer, is dedicated to the creation and demonstra￾tion of a new corporate concept of linked prosperity. The company has three central missions 
and several key operating principles.
Three Missions
Product Mission: To make, distribute, and sell the finest quality all natural ice cream and related 
products in a wide variety of innovative flavors made from Vermont dairy products.
Economic Mission: To operate the company on a sound financial basis of profitable growth, 
increasing value for our shareholders and creating career opportunities and financial rewards 
for our employees.
Social Mission: To recognize the central role that business plays in the structure of society by 
seeking innovative ways to improve the quality of life for a broad community—local, national, 
and international.
Operating Principles
Linked Prosperity: “As the company prospers, the community and our people prosper.” 7.5% 
of pretax profits go to the Ben & Jerry’s Foundation for distribution to community groups and 
charities. Five percent of profits are put into a profit-sharing plan. Five to one salary ratio between 
top management and entry-level production workers. To raise top pay, raise the bottom up.
Community Development: “Business has the responsibility to give back to the community.” 
Donations of ice cream by request to all Vermont non-profit organizations. Leveraged assistance 
where B&J will help non-profits stage fund-raisers selling Vermont’s finest ice cream.
Ownership Perspective: “Everybody is an owner.” Employee stock ownership, stock grants, and 
stock purchase plan. All-company “town meetings” monthly.
Integrity: “Two real guys.” All natural products. Commitment to Vermont Dairy Cooperatives. 
“What you see is what you get.” People can speak, act, and dress as they wish.
Work Hard/Have Fun: “Bend over backwards.” Pledge to meet orders, satisfy customers, make 
things right for people. “If it’s not fun, why do it?” Company celebrations. Jerry’s Joy Committee 
to spread joy in the workplace.
Human Activism/Social Change: “A model for other businesses.” One percent for Peace 
Campaign. Socially responsible marketing. Joint ventures in Israel and Moscow to spread goodwill.308 PART 3 Human Process Interventions
as an example, a freezer door was broken and 
neither the freezer, nor maintenance, nor 
production managers claimed ownership of 
the problem or took responsibility to see that 
it was fixed. That, to him, was symptomatic of 
an undeveloped organization.
Finally, there was the matter of defining OD. 
Neither Ben nor Jerry nor the board had any 
inkling about what OD is and what OD 
people do. I had to educate them about the 
field and make some kind of action proposal. 
This would mean getting to know people, 
getting a handle on their hopes and their 
problems, and learning something about the 
icecream business and conditions in the 
marketplace. Where to start? I went to a 
board meeting to check out members’ hopes 
for organization development and what they 
wanted from me.
FIRST BOARD MEETING
Ben
I want our people to love their work and have 
positive feelings about the company. Love, soul, 
kindness, consideration, generosity, fairness, 
heart.
Jerry
I want a feeling of togetherness and family feel￾ing . . . I’d like staff to feel it was their company.
Jeff
I’d like to see spirit and energy to make a 
difference in the world . . . plant seeds of new 
and different possibilities of looking at our cul￾ture and world. Not corporate America.
Chico
Something special and unique that is making 
new ground, that will be studied and appreciated 
years to come.
Henry
More open communication, listening at the top. 
More buy-in to shared values. Showing respect 
for the individual.
Merritt
Awakened enthusiasm, accomplishment, high 
morale.
At this first meeting, I asked board members to 
state their vision of the ideal organization and 
hopes for the OD effort. Ben and Jerry talked of 
peace, love, family feeling, and good vibes. Jeff 
was on a different wavelength: He articulated a 
political vision where B&J would be an exem￾plar of a radical new kind of organization. Chico 
spoke about innovativeness and excellence, 
without the radical chic or global emphasis. 
Henry’s hopes were addressed to better human 
relations and human resource management. 
Merritt, another businessman cum board mem￾ber, expressed similar sentiments.
I had the board members write their visions 
on sheets of paper, and then together we 
burned them to symbolize how energy and 
togetherness could transform things. Some 
chanting added to the ritual. It must have 
seemed a bit hokey to the board, but I have 
my own preferences and style of doing things 
and wanted to illustrate my own offbeat incli￾nations. In any case, Ben had offered me a 
wizard’s hat to signify his vision of my role. 
The fire trick fit the costuming.
That night, however, I had some misgivings. It 
was clear that, when pressed, neither Ben, 
nor Jerry, nor any board member save Chico 
would provide the day-to-day leadership 
needed to move development through the 
organization. On the contrary, the founders 
wanted to hand off the responsibility to Chico 
and his to-be-formed management team. My 
job was to help bring that team into being and 
to ensure that the team took leadership of 
B&J’s business and social missions. It was also 
to help bring the work force together in 
as-yet-undefined ways.
Should I start my work at the top? I had an 
inkling that the board was not aligned behind 
any one definition of Ben & Jerry’s. However, 
the board was not, at this time, asking for 
assistance with its work nor could the 
members openly talk about problems within 
the group. The problems, in board members’ 
eyes, rested within the organization. That 
made Chico and his team the natural focus of SELECTED CASES 309
intervention. Chico, at this time, had 20 
managers reporting to him, with responsibili￾ties ranging from running the manufacturing 
plant to handling orders for T-shirts and other 
B&J paraphernalia.
Still, I worried whether OD would directly 
reach the work force. If I worked from the top 
down, it might take months (years) to have a 
direct bearing on people’s work lives. The pro￾duction workers were full of ideas, I was told, 
and eager to become more involved. Maybe 
some form of quality-of-work-life program was 
in order wherein employees could take active 
responsibility for problem solving in their own 
areas of responsibility. My question: Were 
managers and supervisors ready for this?
The next step was to do some fact-finding in 
the company. I arranged with Chico to conduct 
interviews with all of his 20 managers, tour the 
plant, talk with production workers and sales 
personnel, and generally sniff around. That 
would lead to a diagnosis of the organization 
and an action proposal.
DIAGNOSIS
Three months of interviews with key managers 
and staff at B&J’s showed the following areas 
of strength and concern in the company:
Strengths:
High commitment to the company and its 
mission.
Norms of honesty and straightforwardness.
Smart and articulate management.
High interest in growth and learning.
Founders and general manager as role 
models.
The interviews affirmed the positive public 
side of B&J’s: Managers and employees were 
wholly dedicated to the company. Many of the 
managers had left successful jobs in other 
companies to come to B&J’s because of its 
funky atmosphere, freewheeling style, and 
socially responsible orientation. Some had 
taken salary cuts to come aboard. The managers 
•
•
•
•
•
were smart and each had his or her own view 
of how the company should develop. These 
views, taken together, pointed to a more par￾ticipatory style of management with people 
charged with higher levels of responsibility. 
This would require more training, of manag￾ers and supervisors, in both technical and 
managerial areas. They would also need to get 
organized—with more clarity about who was 
doing what and why.
The interest was there. Everybody I spoke 
with was eager to learn more and get better at 
their jobs. The commitment was also there. 
Many professed deep feelings of connection to 
Ben and Jerry and were inspired by the chance 
to take “their company” and run it. They also 
looked to Chico to teach them the ins and outs 
and looked forward to working closely with 
him as part of the “management team.”
Concerns:
People and systems not keeping pace with 
growth.
Lack of clear structure, roles, and teamwork.
Lack of common mission, direction, priorities.
People are stretched to the limit.
Founders and general manager are both 
company’s greatest strength and greatest 
weakness.
The roster of concerns shows that Ben & Jerry’s 
was underorganized for handling the challenges 
posed by rapid growth in the market place and 
work force. Interviewees talked about the 
absence of clear goals and agreed-to priorities, 
problems of communication and coordination, 
tasks half-finished and new initia tives begun, 
then dropped. No one had the time to get on 
top of things or ensure follow-through.
Furthermore, the interviewees depicted the 
founders and general manager as both the 
company’s greatest strength and its greatest 
weakness. To this point, Ben and Chico had 
access to the most relevant information and 
called most of the shots. But conflicts between 
the two were legend. Ben would push for 
better quality, faster flavor development, 
•
•
•
•
•310 PART 3 Human Process Interventions
funkier ads and promotions, while Chico 
would urge pragmatism, shuffle priorities, 
mediate tensions, and hawk expenses.
These two titans seemed to be omniscient: 
They handled hot problems and made all the 
right moves. But nobody knew how they 
worked things out or got things done. It was 
plain enough, however, that the to-be-formed 
management would have to set more of the 
direction, solve more of the problems, and 
develop systems for control and follow-through 
if participatory management and decentraliza￾tion were to be accomplished. Furthermore, 
they would have to get closer to one another 
personally and develop more trust and confi￾dence in one another, if family feeling and 
pride of ownership were to prevail.
Thus I pitched the OD effort at helping the 
board of directors to clarify the company’s mis￾sion and to cede operating responsibilities to 
management. In turn, the board was to 
empower managers to run the company in a 
strong, unified, and responsible fashion. There 
were pragmatic issues to address: the managers 
did not see themselves as a team nor had they 
worked together to formulate goals and establish 
roles and responsibilities.
There were also matters of principle on the 
agenda: many managers had no prior experi￾ence leading a company so dedicated to social 
responsibility. Several, frankly, did not fully 
buy into socially oriented company policies, 
including the active association of the com￾pany with the 1% for Peace Campaign and 
the salary ratio of five to one between the 
highest and lowest paid members of the cor￾poration. A few were chafing at the mandate 
of the founders to have “fun” at work while 
still achieving record rates of production at 
superior quality standards.
TEAMBUILDING VIA A RETREAT
The 20 managers and Chico went to an offsite 
retreat where all were blindfolded and roped 
together in their three work-related clusters 
and then charged with locating three inner 
tubes symbolically lashed together maybe 75 
yards away. The members of each cluster 
shouted out instructions or demanded them, 
took stabs at leading and then pulled back in 
frustration, while the other groups stumbled 
along vainly searching for the “goal.” One 
group finally located the tubes, then cheered 
for their own success and chided the other 
groups. This experience provided a window 
into current dynamics in the company and led 
us to examine teamwork, competition, and 
cooperation during the rest of the retreat.
Thereafter, the managers climbed ropes, 
worked on problem-solving initiatives, and 
trekked in the out of doors, all in the service 
of finding new ways to work with one another. 
One evening they talked about their personal 
lives and values through the medium of 
“mind maps.” Everyone recorded on a silhou￾ette the persons and events that had most 
shaped their character, how they wanted to 
be thought of in the company and by their 
peers, and what mark they wanted their life 
to leave behind. Several spoke of their scar￾ring experiences in Vietnam, their poignant 
efforts to cope with family trials, the impact 
their mothers, fathers, and now their spouses 
and children had on them. Many cried. There 
were hugs and cheers.
The next evening, the clusters had the oppor￾tunity to put on skits about their part of the 
organization. The manufacturing cluster 
drew from a popular game show to show 
their peers the “jeopardy” involved in mak￾ing high-volume, high-quality foodstuffs. 
The marketing and sales group selected a 
member to wear the beard of one of the 
founders and joined him in songs and dance 
about the foibles of competing with less 
socially responsible companies and the seem￾ing folly of having fun at work.
The search for the inner tubes was repeated at 
the end of the retreat. The groups quickly 
joined forces with the others to analyze the 
problem, work out a plan, figure out roles and SELECTED CASES 311
responsibilities, and establish procedures to 
stay in touch with one another. They reached 
the goal in one third of the time. The retreat 
concluded with each attendee selecting a 
“totem” to represent his or her experiences 
and developing a personal action plan to be 
implemented in the months ahead.
WHY TEAMBUILDING?
My reasons for recommending teambuilding 
to launch the OD effort at B&J’s were three￾fold. First, it was crucial for managers to 
begin to think of themselves as managers 
and as members of a management team. 
Many of the managers at B&J’s were truly 
supervisors, who worked alongside employ￾ees and focused only on the work going on 
in their own area of responsibility. To cope 
with growth, it was essential for them to 
begin to plan, set priorities, and coordinate 
efforts with one another. This meant they 
had to operate like real managers and become 
a management team.
Second, the managers would be assuming 
new responsibilities heretofore in the hands 
of the founders and general manager. I 
thought it important for them to see how 
much they had in common and how much 
affinity they had with the founders’ vision of 
the enterprise. Teambuilding provides a good 
medium for self-disclosure and helps people 
to open up about who they are and what they 
believe in. The mind maps and skits were 
designed such that people could see how they 
were all in this together. Needless to say, lash￾ing them together to search for an inner tube 
was a more literal translation of the 
message.
Finally, managers had to collectively commit to 
taking on new responsibilities and learn new 
methods for working together. The several 
exercises at the retreat were aimed at educating 
them in group management and problem￾solving skills. The ropes course, in turn, 
emphasized the importance of personal cour￾age and peer support in tackling the unknown. 
The managers left the retreat closer and charged 
up about running the show.
However, the rationale for beginning OD with 
teambuilding was rather traditional and 
conservative in character. Many OD propo￾nents eschew the top-down approach to 
development and work simultaneously at 
many levels in a company. Work teams and 
worker-management committees are starting 
points for OD in many organizations. The aim 
is to get as many people as possible, as soon 
as possible, involved in organizational 
improvement. The risk with going company￾wide with OD from the start is managerial 
resistance. Frankly, in this case, I didn’t think 
managers were ready to respond to group 
problem-solving initiatives by their subordi￾nates and teams. They were not conversant 
with techniques like brainstorming, force 
field analysis, and contingency planning—
requisites for team leaders. Nor were they 
ready, in my judgment, to cede responsibility 
as they were just assuming more of it. Instead, 
my proposal was to go slow, get management 
organized and built into a team, and then 
push OD downward.
FOLLOW UP: GOALS 
AND RESPONSIBILITIES
This began months of teambuilding with the 
newly created management group (see 
Exhibit 3). Each working cluster was charged 
with developing a mission statement for its area 
of responsibility. The cluster groups met several 
times to translate these into operating goals. 
The manufacturing group, for example, focused 
on improving production capacity and quality. 
Managers from the freezer, production, distri￾bution, and maintenance departments then 
analyzed work flow, identified their respective 
responsibilities, and made commitments to one 
another to maximize capacity and ensure qual￾ity standards. The marketing group, in turn, 
formed a steering committee to bring franchis￾ing and sales together and developed a system 312 PART 3 Human Process Interventions
to control competing pressures on the art 
department.
In turn, managers also met with their work 
groups to gather input and incorporate sugges￾tions. In that way, at least, employees were 
kept abreast of developments and had a 
chance to be involved. A safety committee was 
created, staffed by managers and workers, to 
address a broad range of concerns throughout 
the plant and headquarters facility.
Several meetings were held to coordinate 
cluster goal setting. At one session, managers 
drew pictures illustrating the degree of align￾ment between functions and the overall vision 
of the company. One artist depicted the 
founders as the sun, the functions as orbiting 
planets, and the market as a streaking comet. 
Others used stick figures to show the company 
coming together, people cheering, and crazi￾ness all around.
What resulted from these sessions was a series 
of cluster goal statements, an action agenda 
for the next year focused on tasks and goals, 
and closer interpersonal and work relation￾ships. Did teambuilding make a difference? 
Managers rated themselves as much more of 
a team and the functions say they are far 
more aligned:

CROSS-TALK
Despite the progress in organizing manage￾ment, the founders worried whether the 
funk and fun was being lost in all of this busi￾ness. There was a heated debate between 
managers and the founders over growth. The

founders hoped to limit growth in order to 
keep the company small and people con￾nected. Managers pointed out that existing 
marketing and franchise commitments would 
require growth and that B&J’s simply could 
not stiff its customers. Back and forth the talk 
went. It seemed as though the managers had 
become something of a threat to the found￾ers, who were having trouble letting go of 
promised authority.
Ben and Jerry then took the initiative to “lift 
up” the cluster goals into a unifying statement 
of the company’s economic, product, and 
social mission. To air differences, the newly 
formed management team and founders then 
met to examine their differences. Before the 
meeting, Ben had said publicly that manage￾ment “wasn’t weird enough” and expressed 
worry that the company’s social mission was 
being sacrificed to growth. The managers first 
chafed at his inference that they weren’t inter￾ested in the social mission. Then they took his 
concerns to heart. Each member of the man￾agement team came to the meeting wearing a 
mask bearing the likeness of either Ben or 
Jerry and buttons saying “We are weird.”
Together, managers and board members talked 
over issues of trust and relative powers with 
the founders, fleshed out how management 
and the board would work together, and made 
a pact that the company would remain 
committed to high quality production, good 
works, and fun.
Following the session, several actions were 
initiated to bring neglected aspects of the mis￾sion statement to life. A “Joy Committee” was 
established to ensure that spirit was kept alive 
in the company. It hosted lunches, sponsored 
social events, and launched several happen￾ings throughout the company. Employees 
were encouraged to take a more active part in 
the Ben & Jerry’s Foundation and contribute 
directly to charitable giving. Finally, a budget 
committee was created to formulate B&J’s 
first one-year plan.
Questions
Team building is typically used in OD 
to loosen up an over-organized system 
that is too rigid and bureaucratic. In this 
case, team building was aimed at pro￾viding structure to an under-organized 
system. In doing a diagnosis, what factors 
are important to consider in determining 
whether a company or team is over- or 
under-organized? What are the implica￾tions for planning an OD intervention?
Is team building a good way to launch an 
OD effort in this case? Other approaches?
What next steps would you recommend?

Technostructural Interventions
part 4In this chapter, we begin to examine tech￾nostructural interventions—change programs 
focusing on the technology and structure of 
organizations. Increasing global competition 
and rapid technological and environmental 
changes are forcing organizations to restruc￾ture themselves from rigid bureaucracies to 
leaner, more flexible designs. These new forms 
of organizing are highly adaptive and innova￾tive, but require more sophisticated managerial 
capabilities to operate successfully. They often 
result in fewer managers and employees and in 
streamlined work flows that break down func￾tional barriers.
Interventions aimed at structural design 
include moving from more traditional ways of 
dividing the organization’s overall work, such 
as functional, divisional, and matrix structures, 
to more integrative and flexible forms, such as 
process, customer-centric, and network struc￾tures. Diagnostic guidelines help determine 
which structure is appropriate for particular 
organizational environments, technologies, and 
conditions.
Downsizing seeks to reduce costs and bureau￾cracy by decreasing the size of the organization. 
This reduction in personnel can be accomplished 
through layoffs, organization redesign, and 
outsourcing, which involves moving functions 
that are not part of the organization’s core 
competence to outside contractors. Successful 
downsizing is closely aligned with the organi￾zation’s strategy.
Reengineering radically redesigns the 
organization’s core work processes to give 
tighter linkage and coordination among the dif￾ferent tasks. This work-flow integration results 
in faster, more responsive task performance. 
Reengineering often is accomplished with new 
information technology that permits employees 
to control and coordinate work processes more 
effectively.
Restructuring Organizations
STRUCTURAL DESIGN
Organization structure describes how the overall work of the organization is 
divided into subunits and how these subunits are coordinated for task completion. 
Based on a contingency perspective shown in Figure 14.1, organization structures 
should be designed to fit with at least four factors: the environment, organization 
size, technology, and organization strategy. Organization effectiveness depends on 
the extent to which its structures are responsive to these contingencies.1
Organizations traditionally have structured themselves into one of three 
forms: functional departments that are task specialized; self-contained 
divisional units that are oriented to specific products, customers, or regions; 
or matrix structures that combine both functional specialization and self￾containment. Faced with accelerating changes in competitive environments 
and technologies, however, organizations increasingly have redesigned their 
structures into more integrative and flexible forms. These more recent innova￾tions include process structures that design subunits around the organization’s 
14316 PART 4 Technostructural Interventions
core work processes, customer-centric structures that focus attention and resources 
on specific customers or customer segments, and network-based structures that 
link the organization to other, interdependent organizations. The advantages, dis￾advantages, and contingencies of the different structures are described below.
The Functional Structure
The most widely used organizational structure in the world today is the basic functional 
structure, depicted in Figure 14.2. The organization usually is divided into functional 
units, such as marketing, operations, research and development, human resources, and 
finance. This structure is based on early management theories regarding specialization,

line and staff relations, span of control, authority, and responsibility.2
 The major func￾tional units are staffed by specialists from such disciplines as engineering and account￾ing. It is considered easier to manage specialists if they are grouped together under the 
same head and if the head of the department has been trained and has experience in 
that particular discipline.
Table 14.1 lists the advantages and disadvantages of functional structures. On the 
positive side, functional structures promote specialization of skills and resources by 
grouping people who perform similar work and face similar problems. This grouping 
facilitates communication within departments and allows specialists to share their 
expertise. It also enhances career development within the specialty, whether it be 
accounting, finance, engineering, or sales. The functional structure reduces duplication 
of services because it makes the best use of people and resources.
On the negative side, functional structures tend to promote routine tasks with a 
limited orientation. Department members focus on their own tasks, rather than on the 
organization’s total task. This can lead to conflict across functional departments when 
each group tries to maximize its own performance without considering the performances 
of other units. Coordination and scheduling among departments can be difficult when 
each emphasizes its own perspective. As shown in Table 14.1, the functional structure 
tends to work best in small- to medium-size firms in environments that are relatively 
stable and certain. These organizations typically have a small number of products or 
services, and coordination across specialized units is relatively easy. This structure also is 
best suited to routine technologies in which there is interdependence within functions, 
and to organizational goals emphasizing efficiency and technical quality.

[Table 14.1]318 PART 4 Technostructural Interventions
The Divisional Structure
The divisional structure represents a fundamentally different way of organizing. Also 
known as a product or self-contained-unit structure, it was developed at about the 
same time by General Motors, Sears, Standard Oil of New Jersey (now ExxonMobil), 
and DuPont.3
 It groups organizational activities on the basis of products, services, 
customers, or geography. All or most of the resources and functions necessary to 
accomplish a specific objective are set up as a division headed by a product or divi￾sion manager. For example, General Electric has plants that specialize in making jet 
engines and others that produce household appliances. Each plant manager reports 
to a particular division or product vice president, rather than to a manufacturing vice 
president. In effect, a large organization may set up smaller (sometimes temporary) 
special-purpose organizations, each geared to a specific product, service, customer, or 
region. A typical division structure is shown in Figure 14.3. It is interesting to note that 
the formal structure within a self- contained unit often is functional in nature.
Table 14.2 lists the advantages and disadvantages of divisional structures. These 
organizations recognize key interdependencies and coordinate resources toward an 
overall outcome. This strong outcome orientation ensures departmental accountabil￾ity and promotes cohesion among those contributing to the product. These structures 
provide employees with opportunities for learning new skills and expanding knowl￾edge because workers can move more easily among the different specialties contrib￾uting to the product. As a result, divisional structures are well suited for developing 
general managers.
Divisional structures do have certain problems. They may not have enough special￾ized work to use people’s skills and abilities fully. Specialists may feel isolated from 
their professional colleagues and may fail to advance in their career specialty. The 
structures may promote allegiance to department rather than organization objectives. 
They also place multiple demands on people, thereby creating stress.

The divisional structure works best in conditions almost the opposite of those favor￾ing a functional organization, as shown in Table 14.2. The organization needs to be 
relatively large to support the duplication of resources assigned to the units. Because 
each unit is designed to fit a particular niche, the structure adapts well to uncertain 
conditions. Divisional units also help to coordinate technical interdependencies falling 
across functions and are suited to goals promoting product or service specialization and 
innovation.
The Matrix Structure
Some OD practitioners have focused on maximizing the strengths and minimizing the 
weaknesses of both the functional and the divisional structures, and this effort has 
resulted in the matrix structure.
4
 It superimposes a lateral structure that focuses on prod￾uct or project coordination on a vertical functional structure, as shown in Figure 14.4. 
Matrix organization designs originally evolved in the aerospace industry where chang￾ing customer demands and technological conditions caused managers to focus on 
lateral relationships between functions to develop a flexible and adaptable system of 
resources and procedures, and to achieve a series of project objectives. Matrix struc￾tures now are used widely in manufacturing, service, nonprofit, governmental, and 
professional organizations.5
Every matrix organization contains three unique and critical roles: the top manager, 
who heads and balances the dual chains of command; the matrix bosses (functional, 
product, or area), who share subordinates; and the “two-boss” managers, who report to 
two different matrix leaders. Each of these roles has its own unique requirements. For

example, functional matrix leaders are expected to maximize their respective technical 
expertise within constraints posed by market realities. Two-boss managers, however, 
must accomplish work within the demands of supervisors who want to achieve technical 
sophistication on the one hand, and to meet customer expectations on the other. Thus, 
a matrix organization has more than its matrix structure. It also must be reinforced by 
matrix processes, such as performance management systems that get input from both 
functional and project bosses, by matrix leadership behavior that operates comfortably 
with lateral decision making, and by a matrix culture that fosters open conflict manage￾ment and a balance of power.6
Matrix organizations, like all organization structures, have both advantages and 
disadvantages, as shown in Table 14.3. On the positive side, this structure allows 
multiple orientations. Specialized, functional knowledge can be applied to all projects. 
New products or projects can be implemented quickly by using people flexibly and by 
moving between product and functional orientations as circumstances demand. Matrix 
structures can maintain consistency among departments and projects by requiring 
communication among managers. For many people, matrix structures are motivating 
and exciting.
On the negative side, these organizations can be difficult to manage. To implement 
and maintain them requires heavy managerial costs and support. When people are 
assigned to more than one department, there may be role ambiguity and conflict, and 
overall performance may be sacrificed if there are power conflicts between functional

departments and project structures. To make matrix structures work, organization 
members need interpersonal and conflict management skills. People can get confused 
about how the matrix works, and that can lead to chaos and inefficiencies.
As shown in Table 14.3, matrix structures are appropriate under three important 
conditions.7
 First, there must be real outside pressures for a dual focus. For example, 
a matrix structure works well when there are many customers with unique demands 
on the one hand and strong requirements for technical sophistication on the other. 
The OD practitioner must work with the client system to determine whether there 
is real pressure for a dual focus. Managers often agree, without carefully testing the 
assumption, that both are important. Second, a matrix organization is appropriate 
when the organization must process a large amount of information. Circumstances 
requiring such capacity are few and include the following: when external environ￾mental demands change unpredictably; when the organization produces a broad range 
of products or services, or offers those outputs to a large number of different markets; 
when the relevant technologies evolve quickly; and when there is reciprocal inter￾dependence among the tasks in the organization’s technical core. In each case, there 
is considerable complexity in decision making and pressure on communication and 
coordination systems. Third, and finally, there must be pressures for shared resources. 
When customer demands vary greatly and technological requirements are strict, valu￾able human and physical resources are likely to be scarce. The matrix works well under

those conditions because it facilitates the sharing of scarce resources. If any one of the 
foregoing conditions is not met, a matrix organization is likely to fail.
The Process Structure
A radically new logic for structuring organizations is to form multidisciplinary teams 
around core processes, such as product development, order fulfillment, sales genera￾tion, and customer support.8 As shown in Figure 14.5, process-based structures emphasize 
lateral rather than vertical relationships.9 All functions necessary to produce a product 
or service are placed in a common unit usually managed by a role labeled a “process 
owner.” There are few hierarchical levels, and the senior executive team is relatively 
small, typically consisting of the chair, the chief operating officer, and the heads of a 
few key support services such as strategic planning, human resources, and finance.
Process structures eliminate many of the hierarchical and departmental boundaries 
that can impede task coordination and slow decision making and task performance. 
They reduce the enormous costs of managing across departments and up and down 
the hierarchy. Process-based structures enable organizations to focus most of their 
resources on serving customers, both inside and outside the firm.
The use of process-based structures is growing rapidly in a variety of manufactur￾ing and service companies. Typically referred to as “horizontal,” “boundaryless,” or 
“team-based” organizations, they are used to enhance customer service at such firms as 
American Express Financial Advisors, Healthways, Johnson & Johnson, 3M, Xerox, and

The Process-Based Structure

General Electric Capital Services. Although there is no one right way to design process￾based structures, the following features characterize this new form of organizing:10
Processes drive structure. Process-based structures are organized around the 
three to five key processes that define the work of the organization. Rather than 
products or functions, processes define the structure and are governed by a “process 
owner.” Each process has clear performance goals that drive task execution.
Work adds value. To increase efficiency, process-based structures simplify and 
enrich work processes. Work is simplified by eliminating nonessential tasks and 
reducing layers of management, and it is enriched by combining tasks so that teams 
perform whole processes.
Teams are fundamental. Teams are the key organizing feature in a process-based 
structure. They manage everything from task execution to strategic planning, are 
typically self-managing, and are responsible for goal achievement.
Customers define performance. The primary goal of any team in a process-based 
structure is customer satisfaction. Defining customer expectations and designing 
team functions to meet those expectations command much of the team’s atten￾tion. The organization must value this orientation as the primary path to financial 
performance.
Teams are rewarded for performance. Appraisal systems focus on measuring 
team performance against customer satisfaction and other goals, and then provide 
real recognition for achievement. Team-based rewards are given as much, if not 
more, weight than is individual recognition.
Teams are tightly linked to suppliers and customers. Through designated 
members, teams have timely and direct relationships with vendors and customers 
to understand and respond to emerging concerns.
Team members are well informed and trained. Successful implementation 
of a process-based structure requires team members who can work with a broad 
range of information, including customer and market data, financial information, 
and personnel and policy matters. Team members also need problem-solving and 
decision-making skills and abilities to address and implement solutions.
Table 14.4 lists the advantages and disadvantages of process-based structures. The most 
frequently mentioned advantage is intense focus on meeting customer needs, which 
can result in dramatic improvements in speed, efficiency, and customer satisfaction. 
Process-based structures remove layers of management, and consequently informa￾tion flows more quickly and accurately throughout the organization. Because process 
teams comprise different functional specialties, boundaries between departments are 
removed, thus affording organization members a broad view of the work flow and a 
clear line of sight between team performance and organization effectiveness. Process￾based structures also are more flexible and adaptable to change than are traditional 
structures.
A major disadvantage of process structures is the difficulty of changing to this new 
organizational form. These structures typically require radical shifts in mindsets, skills, 
and managerial roles—changes that involve considerable time and resources and 
can be resisted by functional managers and staff specialists. Moreover, process-based 
structures may result in expensive duplication of scarce resources and, if teams are not 
skilled adequately, in slower decision making as they struggle to define and reach con￾sensus. Finally, implementing process-based structures relies on properly identifying 
key processes needed to satisfy customer needs. If critical processes are misidentified or 
ignored altogether, performance and customer satisfaction are likely to suffer.
Table 14.4 shows that process structures are particularly appropriate for highly 
uncertain environments where customer demands and market conditions are

changing rapidly. They enable organizations to manage nonroutine technologies and 
coordinate work flows that are highly interdependent. Process-based structures gener￾ally appear in medium- to large-size organizations having several products or projects. 
They focus heavily on customer-oriented goals and are found in both domestic and 
global organizations.
Application 14.1 describes the process-based structure proposed as part of the struc￾tural change process at Healthways Corporation.
The Customer-Centric Structure
Closely related to the process-based structure, the customer-centric structure focuses sub￾units on the creation of solutions and the satisfaction of key customers or customer 
groups.11 As shown in Figure 14.7, these customer or market-facing units are supported 
by other units that develop new products, manufacture components and products, and 
manage the supply chain. A variety of organizations, including the Lord Corporation, 
DOW, IBM, and Citibank, have implemented these complex structures. Also known as 
front–back organizations, these structures excel at putting customer needs at the top 
of an organization’s agenda.
Galbraith notes that globalization, e-commerce, and the desire for solutions has greatly 
enhanced the power of the customer to demand organizational structures that service 
their needs. These new structures highlight the radical differences between product￾focused organizations, like the function or divisional strucure, and customer-centric 
organizations. As shown in Table 14.5, there are four key differences.
In a product-centric organization, the goal is to provide customers with the best prod￾uct possible and to create value by developing new products and innovative features. 
In a customer-centric structure, the organization develops the best solution for the cus￾tomer by offering a customized bundle of products, services, support, and education.

[Table 14.4]Healthways Corporation (HC) (http://www. 
healthways.com) is a provider of specialized dis￾ease management services to health plans and 
hospitals. In fiscal year 2002, HC had revenues of 
$122 million.The company, founded in 1981 as 
American Healthcorp (AMHC), originally owned 
and managed hospitals. In 1984 it offered its first 
disease management service focused on diabetes. 
Under the name Diabetes Treatment Centers of 
America, it worked with hospitals to create “cen￾ters of excellence” to improve hospital volumes and 
lower costs. After going public in 1991, it offered 
in 1993 its first diabetes management program to 
health plans—an entirely new customer segment. 
This shift in customer base was a key event in the 
company’s history, and two new disease manage￾ment programs for cardiac and respiratory diseases 
were offered in 1998 and 1999, respectively. By 
2000, hospital revenues, once 100% of the compa￾ny’s mix, had dropped to 38% as the health plan 
business grew.
The organization recognized that its current struc￾ture would not support the expected growth. As 
part of their structural change effort, the initial 
organization design and development task force 
(the ODD group) recommended a process-based 
organization structure to the senior leadership 
group. The organization was described in terms 
of five core processes: understand the market and 
plan the business, acquire and retain customers, 
build value solutions, deliver solutions and add 
value, and manage the business (Figure 14.6).
• The understand-the-market process was responsi￾ble for scanning AMHC’s external environment 
for business opportunities, trends, regulatory 
changes, and competitive intelligence. The 
process was also responsible for generating 
new product ideas, based on their environ￾mental scanning activities, and for developing 
and driving the strategic planning process of 
the organization.
• Based on the outputs of the understand- the￾market process, the build-value-solutions process
was responsible for translating business or prod￾uct opportunities into reproducible products. 
This organization was responsible for more fully 
developing the business case initially identified by 
the understand-t he - market process, developing 
performance metrics, product development 
and testing, and the development of marketing 
materials.
• The acquire-and-retain-customers process involved 
the sales and marketing organization. It was 
responsible for finalizing marketing materials, 
identifying new customers, selling and signing 
contracts, developing relationships with key 
stakeholders, implementing marketing plans, 
and responding to requests for proposals.
• The deliver-solutions-and-add-value process was 
responsible for delivering on contractual com￾mitments, account management and upselling, 
maintaining product integrity, and building 
delivery capacity.
• In the manage-the-business process, the small 
corporate headquarters staff was responsible for 
human resources, financial governance, infor￾mation technology standards, medical leader￾ship, and corporate image and branding. It was 
to act as a shared services organization support￾ing the value-adding process organizations.
Each process was to be staffed with an appropriate 
mix of functional experts. That is, the operational 
basis of the new organization was a cross- functional 
team that could represent the different perspectives 
at each stage of the business. For example, the 
acquire-and-retain-customers process included not 
only sales and marketing expertise, but functional 
expertise in account management, information 
technology, finance, medical and clinical special￾ties, and product development. In recommending 
that a core process be staffed with the appropriate 
mix of functional expertise, the task force was also 
suggesting that the structure within a core process 
be team based. That is, the acquire-and-retain￾customers process could flexibly organize cross￾functional teams to address a specific customer’s 
requirements and then recombine resources to 
pursue a different customer.
In addition, appropriate metrics for monitoring the 
effectiveness of each process as well as the relation￾ships between any two processes in the organization 
were specified. In terms of effectiveness metrics, the 
key outcome for all processes was customer satisfac￾tion. That is, the acquire-customer process was judged 
primarily on the extent to which it acquired custom￾ers and contracts that the deliver-solutions group 
Healthways’ Process Structure
application 14.1326 PART 4 Technostructural Interventions
believed could be managed. In terms of relationships, 
any new business opportunities identified by the 
understand-the-market process required certain 
approvals by senior management before being handed 
off to the build-value-solutions process. This “go-no 
go” decision assured that the organization had suf￾ficient investment resources to fund new business or 
product development and that good opportunities, 
not just a lot of opportunities, were being forwarded 
to the build-value-solutions process.

Product-centric structures have core structural features that include product groups and 
teams that are measured by product margins. The most central process is, of course, new 
product development. Customer-centric structures have a very different look and feel. 
Their core structures focus attention and resources on customers with market-facing units 
organized around large individual customers or customer segment teams that attempt to 
maximize customer profit and loss. These core units are supported by sophisticated cus￾tomer relationship management processes and processes that link the market-facing units 
with the support units. While any one of these differences may seem obvious, a careful 
look will show that the product-centric dimensions represent important and deeply rooted 
assumptions in most organizations. Deciding to execute a customer-centric organization 
is a substantial undertaking.
As shown in Table 14.6, customer-centric structures have important strengths and 
weaknesses. Customer-centric structures present one face to the customer. Divisional 
structures, for example, can confuse customers when each division sends their own 
sales team. When one team is dedicated to a customer or customer group, they develop CHAPTER 14 Restructuring Organizations 327

a deep understanding of the customer’s needs, preferences, and industry trends. This 
deep understanding results in another strength. The customer-centric structure sup￾ports the customization of solutions and so helps to build a robust customer satisfaction 
capability.
In terms of weaknesses, the customer teams can become too inwardly focused and 
lose sight of the larger organizational strategy. This can make it difficult to share learn￾ings from successful innovation or customization with the rest of the organization. One 
of the most important weaknesses of the customer-centric organization is its reliance 
on lateral mechanisms and relationships. To be effective, a customer-centric organi￾zation must have strong lateral capabilities, including information systems, capital 
allocation processes, resource prioritization systems, and the like, to integrate the front 
and back end of the organization. Few organizations have developed this capability. 
Finally, customer-centric organizations must decide where to put the marketing func￾tion. Should marketing be done by the “front” or “back” of the organization? This is a 
question not easily answered.
Customer-centric organizations work best in large organizations, where there are 
strong and powerful customer forces in the industry and where technology and 
market changes are highly complex and uncertain. In addition, as noted above, the 
organization has to have a certain amount of maturity. It is unlikely that an organiza￾tion can successfully implement a customer-centric structure without a strong lateral 
capability.
The Network Structure
A network structure manages the diverse, complex, and dynamic relationships among 
multiple organizations or units, each specializing in a particular business function or 
task.12 Organizations that utilize network structures include shamrock organizations 
and virtual, modular, or cellular corporations.13 Less formally, they have been described 
as “pizza” structures, spiderwebs, starbursts, and cluster organizations. Some of this

confusion over the definition of a network was clarified by a typology describing four 
basic types of networks.14
An internal market network exists when a single organization establishes each subunit 
as an independent profit center that is allowed to trade in services and resources 
with each other as well as with the external market. Asea Brown Boveri’s (ABB) 50 
worldwide businesses consist of 1,200 companies organized into 4,500 profit centers 
that conduct business with each other.
A vertical market network is composed of multiple organizations linked to a focal 
organization that coordinates the movement of resources from raw materials to end 
consumer. Nike, for example, has its shoes manufactured in different plants around 
the world and then organizes their distribution through retail outlets.
An intermarket network represents alliances among a variety of organizations in dif￾ferent markets and is exemplified by the Japanese keiretsu, the Korean chaebol, and 
the Mexican grupos.
An opportunity network is the most advanced form of network structure. It is a tem￾porary constellation of organizations brought together to pursue a single purpose. 
Once accomplished, the network disbands. Li and Fung is a Hong Kong–based trading 
company that pulls together a variety of specialist supplier organizations to design and 
manufacture a wide range of private-label clothing.
These types of networks can be distinguished from one another in terms of whether 
they are single or multiple organizations, single or multiple industries, and stable or 
temporary.15 For example, an internal market network is a stable, single-organization, 
single-industry structure; an opportunity network is a temporary, multiple-organization 
structure that can span several different industries.
As shown in Figure 14.8, the network structure redraws organizational boundaries 
and links separate business units to facilitate task interaction. The essence of networks 
is the relationships among organizations that perform different aspects of work. In this 
way, organizations do the things that they do well; for example, manufacturing exper￾tise is applied to production, and logistical expertise is applied to distribution. Network

organizations use strategic alliances, joint ventures, research and development con￾sortia, licensing agreements, and wholly owned subsidiaries to design, manufacture, 
and market advanced products, enter new international markets, and develop new 
technologies. Companies such as Apple Computer, Benetton, Sun Microsystems, Liz 
Claiborne, Nike, and Merck have implemented fairly sophisticated vertical market and 
intermarket network structures. Opportunity networks also are commonplace in the 
construction, fashion, and entertainment industries, as well as in the public sector.16
Network structures typically have the following characteristics:
Vertical disaggregation. This refers to the breaking up of the organization’s business 
functions, such as production, marketing, and distribution, into separate organiza￾tions performing specialized work. In the film industry, for example, separate organi￾zations providing transportation, cinematography, special effects, set design, music, 
actors, and catering all work together under a broker organization, the studio. The 
particular organizations making up the opportunity network represent an important 
factor in determining its success.17 More recently, disintermediation, or the replace￾ment of whole steps in the value chain by information technology—specifically the 
Internet—has fueled the development and numbers of network structures.
Brokers. Networks often are managed by broker organizations or “process orches￾trators” that locate and assemble member organizations. The broker may play a 
central role and subcontract for needed products or services, or it may specialize 
in linking equal partners into a network. In the construction industry, the general 
contractor typically assembles and manages drywall, mechanical, electrical, plumb￾ing, and other specialties to erect a building.
Coordinating mechanisms. Network organizations generally are not controlled by 
hierarchical arrangements or plans. Rather, coordination of the work in a network 
falls into three categories: informal relationships, contracts, and market mechanisms. 
First, coordination patterns can depend heavily on interpersonal relationships among 
individuals who have a well-developed partnership. Conflicts are resolved through 
reciprocity; network members recognize that each likely will have to compromise at 
some point. Trust is built and nurtured over time by these reciprocal arrangements. 
Second, coordination can be achieved through formal contracts, such as ownership 
control, licensing arrangements, or purchase agreements. Finally, market mecha￾nisms, such as spot payments, performance accountability, technology standards, and 
information systems, ensure that all parties are aware of each other’s activities and can 
communicate with each other.
Network structures have a number of advantages and disadvantages, as shown in 
Table 14.7.18 They are highly flexible and adaptable to changing conditions. The ability 
to form partnerships with different organizations permits the creation of a “best-of￾the-best” company to exploit opportunities, often global in nature. They enable each 
member to exploit its distinctive competence. They can accumulate and apply suffi￾cient resources and expertise to large, complex tasks that single organizations cannot 
perform. Perhaps most important, network organizations can have synergistic effects 
whereby members build on each other’s strengths and competencies, creating a whole 
that exceeds the sum of its parts.
The major problems with network organizations are in managing such complex 
structures. Galbraith and Kazanjian describe network structures as matrix organiza￾tions extending beyond the boundaries of single firms but lacking the ability to appeal 
to a higher authority to resolve conflicts.19 Thus, matrix skills of managing lateral rela￾tions across organizational boundaries are critical to administering network structures. 
Most organizations, because they are managed hierarchically, can be expected to have 
difficulties managing lateral relations. Other disadvantages of network organizations 
•
•
•CHAPTER 14 Restructuring Organizations 331
include the difficulties of motivating organizations to join such structures and of 
sustaining commitment over time. Potential members may not want to give up their 
autonomy to link with other organizations and, once linked, they may have problems 
sustaining the benefits of joining together. This is especially true if the network consists 
of organizations that are not the “best of breed.” Finally, joining a network may expose 
the organization’s proprietary knowledge and skills to others.
As shown in Table 14.7, network organizations are best suited to highly complex 
and uncertain environments where multiple competencies and flexible responses are 
needed. They seem to apply to organizations of all sizes, and they deal with complex 
tasks or problems involving high interdependencies across organizations. Network struc￾tures fit with goals that emphasize organization specialization and innovation.
Application 14.2 describes how Amazon.com’s network structure was configured to 
align with its strategy and how relationships are managed.20
DOWNSIZING
Downsizing refers to interventions aimed at reducing the size of the organization.21
This typically is accomplished by decreasing the number of employees through layoffs, 
attrition, redeployment, or early retirement or by reducing the number of organiza￾tional units or managerial levels through divestiture, outsourcing, reorganization, or 
delayering. In practice, downsizing generally involves layoffs where a certain number 
or class of organization members is no longer employed by the organization. Although 
traditionally associated with lower-level workers, downsizing increasingly has claimed 
the jobs of staff specialists, middle managers, and senior executives.
An important consequence of downsizing has been the rise of the contingent work￾force. In companies like Cisco or Motorola, less expensive temporary or permanent 
part-time workers often are hired by the same organizations that just laid off thousands 
of employees. A study by the American Management Association found that nearly a

[Table 14.7]Amazon.com’s Network Structure
Amazon.com (http://www.amazon.com) was 
launched in mid-1995 as the “Earth’s Biggest 
Bookstore.” It offered more than one million titles 
to online buyers, more than three times the num￾ber offered at traditional bookstores. Since then, 
it has evolved into a powerful network structure 
involving both other Internet retailers as well as 
more traditional retailers, including other book￾stores. At the center of it all is Amazon’s massive 
Web site, Amazon.com. By pairing Amazon’s 
state-of-the-art technology, built-in traffic, and 
industry-leading fulfillment and customer service 
processes with its partners’ products and their 
own strengths, a complex network of organiza￾tions is working together to make everyone more 
successful.
The company went public in the first quarter 
of 1997 riding the dot.com wave, and revenues 
have grown from $147.8 million in 1997 to over 
$3.93 billion in fiscal year 2002. Sales increased 
26% over fiscal year 2001. Despite this impressive 
sales growth, there was increasing pressure to 
deliver profits, which occurred for the first time in 
fiscal year 2002. From at least one point of view, 
the development of Amazon’s network structure 
is an important reason.
From the beginning, Amazon has operated as a 
virtual organization and leveraged the network 
structure. For example, it developed and operated 
its Amazon.com Web site to draw in customers and 
learn about creating an effective online customer 
experience. But the company owned little or no 
inventory, warehouses, distribution centers, or 
customer service operations. Early on, order fulfill￾ment was left to Ingram Book Distributors, one of 
the largest book wholesalers, who also contracted 
out delivery to third-party vendors, such as UPS.
In June of 1998, Amazon began selling CDs, and 
added DVDs and videos in November 1998. It 
added electronic products, toys, software, and 
video games in 1999, and tools, health and beauty 
products, kitchen products, and photo services in 
2000. It has also expanded internationally, open￾ing up the UK and German markets in 1999 and 
in Japan and France in 2000. Amazon’s first West 
Coast distribution center was built in 1996 and an 
East Coast distribution center was added in 1997. 
In 1999, in anticipation of the Christmas rush, 
Amazon built five warehouse and distribution 
facilities and several customer service centers to 
improve its order fulfillment capabilities.
Amazon’s initial forays into a broader network 
began in 1999 but were compartmentalized on 
the Web site. Non-Amazon products, such as 
used books or individuals auctioning off different 
products, were not allowed to infiltrate Amazon’s 
millions of book, CD, and DVD pages. Third-party 
products were put under “tabs” that roughly 
described the kind of commerce to be conducted, 
such as the “auction” tab or the “zShops” tab, 
which contained a variety of vendor products. 
Thus, traditional Amazon products were sepa￾rated from products offered by others. Continued 
profit pressure, however, forced the organization 
to look at relationships differently.
Jeff Bezos, company founder and CEO, stated as 
follows:
We realized that what was most important 
to the marketplace sellers was demand—
access to prospective buyers. So, the idea of 
the “single store” was to give them a level of 
access equal to our own—listing their goods 
right alongside ours.
As a result, a Web page describing Amazon’s 
product—say a DVD with the product’s image and 
other information—was altered to contain prod￾uct offerings and descriptions from other vendors, 
such as used DVDs, DVD players from Circuit City, 
and used soundtrack CDs from another partner.
With the “single store” strategy, Amazon.com 
transformed itself from an Internet retailer to 
a platform for commerce. Small businesses and 
individuals, which used to be in the Auctions or 
zShops section, were given the opportunity to 
place their products on Amazon’s most visited 
sites. In exchange for this visibility, Amazon 
developed a contract that included a fee schedule 
and described the responsibilities and activities 
that each organization would perform.
Larger organizations had more options, including 
the Merchants@amazon.com arrangement, the 
merchants.com program, the syndicated stores 
program, as well as more traditional market￾ing relationships. The Merchants@amazon.com 
arrangement gave partner organizations, such as 
application 14.2CHAPTER 14 Restructuring Organizations 333
Office Depot, Circuit City, Borders Books, and 
Toys “R” Us, access to Amazon’s customer base 
and Web site while retaining ownership of the 
inventory and the ability to set prices. Amazon 
got a service fee and commission on sales. For 
example, Amazon created a three-year partner￾ship with Circuit City that allowed Amazon 
to generate revenue on people who performed 
product research online and then made purchases 
at the store. Amazon began by selling a limited 
assortment of Circuit City products for in-store 
pickup, and then expanded its selection of Circuit 
City products in 2002, including products that 
duplicated Amazon’s product mix.
The Toys “R” Us relationship is an excellent exam￾ple of how networks operate to the advantage of 
both companies. Traditional retailers often get 60% 
of their annual sales in the final two months of the 
year; in Toys “R” Us’s case, it was more like 75%. 
In 1999, the Toys “R” Us Christmas season nearly 
ruined the company. As with many retailers, Toys 
“R” Us hoped to take advantage of the Internet 
shopping trend and opened toysrus.com. But their 
inability to fill customer orders produced such a 
large volume of customer complaints that the com￾pany was fined by the Federal Trade Commission 
for violating mail and telephone order rules. By 
partnering with Amazon, there was no need for 
Toys “R” Us to invest in an infrastructure that was 
going to be used only for eight weeks.
The Toys “R” Us case is a 10-year agreement where 
Amazon houses toy inventory, ships toys to cus￾tomers, processes payments, and performs post-sale 
customer service. Toys “R” Us retains responsibility 
for buying and pricing products. This relationship 
was based on an understanding of the strengths of 
Amazon and Toys “R” Us. Bezos noted that
There are things we’ll never be able to do 
that partners can do effortlessly. Likewise, 
we bring certain skills and a customer base 
to the table that would be very difficult for 
partners to acquire. The toys category is a 
good example.
Amazon was building key capabilities in per￾sonalizing the customer experience, making it 
possible to suggest additional purchases based on 
information provided by the buyer and previous 
purchases. For example, Amazon’s “customer 
filtering” software tracks a consumer’s purchases 
and finds other consumers in the database who 
have made similar purchases. It then recommends 
additional products assuming that the online cus￾tomer has similar tastes. Other technologies that 
Amazon can bring include payment systems and 
Web customer assistance technologies.
On the other hand, Toys “R” Us is an incredibly 
large buyer, and the Internet sales unit enjoys the 
same purchasing power as its parent. As Christmas 
approaches and particular toys or categories of 
toys attract attention, the larger buyers are more 
likely to get the last-minute shipments that come 
in from overseas manufacturers. The partnership 
works well for both.
In the Merchants.com program, Amazon operated 
third-party Web sites on behalf of the merchant. 
For example, Amazon offered its know-how to 
operate Target’s Web site (http://www.target.
com), took inventory into its distribution cen￾ters, and completed most fulfillment functions. 
In exchange, Target paid Amazon a fixed fee and 
commissions on sales. The syndicated store option 
was similar to the Merchants.com program in that 
Amazon operated the Web site. The difference 
was that Amazon offered a completely outsourced 
solution, taking responsibility for Web site devel￾opment, buying, stocking, pricing, shipping, and 
servicing the customer.
Finally, Amazon also engaged in more traditional 
marketing arrangements where the Amazon.com 
Web site served as a marketing vehicle for other 
companies. From the Amazon Web site, users 
were transferred over to the vendor’s Web site 
and Amazon received a fee based on the number 
of customers exposed to the vendor’s market￾ing message or on the number of customers 
referred. Amazon made its first set of partnerships 
with Drugstore.com, Living.com, and Wine.com 
among others. As Amazon affiliates, they paid 
Amazon placement and referral fees for advertis￾ing on the Amazon Web site. This was called the 
Amazon Commerce Network.
By excelling at particular aspects of retailing in the 
Internet environment, Amazon has been able to 
leverage those competencies into a powerful net￾work of alliances and partnerships. The network 
structure is one important reason Amazon is one 
of the few Internet startups to actually post a profit.334 PART 4 Technostructural Interventions
third of the 720 firms in the sample had rehired recently terminated employees as inde￾pendent contractors or consultants because the downsizings had not been matched by 
an appropriate reduction in or redesign of the workload.22 Overall cost reduction was 
achieved by replacing expensive permanent workers with a contingent workforce.
Over the past decade, most major U.S. corporations and government agencies have 
engaged in downsizing activities. For example, a 2004 study by Mercer Consulting 
found that 71% of their respondents had a reduction in force since January 2001 and 
another study found that 94% of companies surveyed in the U.S. and Europe down￾sized between 1993 and 1995.23 Recent government statistics show that more than 
124,000 people were laid off in July 2007, and more than 129,000 layoffs were claimed 
in June 2007.24 Other organizations have downsized by redeploying workers from one 
function or job to another. For example, AT&T, IBM, Boeing, Sears, and Xerox cut 
nearly a quarter-million jobs in 1993 and hired more than 63,000 in 1996. In IBM’s 
case, it laid off more than 69,000 people but increased its total workforce by 16,000 as 
demand was shifted from hardware to software and services.25
Downsizing is generally a response to at least four major conditions. First, it is 
associated increasingly with mergers and acquisitions. One in nine job cuts during 
1998 was the result of the integration of two organizations.26 Second, it can result 
from organization decline caused by loss of revenues and market share and by tech￾nological and industrial change. As a result of fuel oil prices, terrorism, and other 
changes, the airline industry reduced its workforce by more than 10% between early 
2002 and early 2003.27 Third, downsizing can occur when organizations implement 
one of the new organizational structures described above. For example, creation of 
network-based structures often involves outsourcing work that is not essential to 
the organization’s core competence. Fourth, downsizing can result from beliefs and 
social pressures that smaller is better.28 In the United States, there is strong conviction 
that organizations should be leaner and more flexible. Hamel and Prahalad warned, 
however, that organizations must be careful that downsizing is not a symptom of 
“corporate anorexia.”29 Organizations may downsize for their own sake and not think 
about future growth. They may lose key employees who are necessary for future 
success, cutting into the organization’s core competencies and leaving a legacy of 
mistrust among members. In such situations, it is questionable whether downsizing 
is developmental as defined in OD.
Application Stages
Successful downsizing interventions tend to proceed by the following steps:30
Clarify the Organization’s Strategy. As a first step, organization leaders specify 
corporate and business strategy and communicate clearly how downsizing relates 
to it. They seek to inform members that downsizing is not a goal in itself, but a 
restructuring process for achieving strategic objectives. Leaders need to provide 
visible and consistent support throughout the process. They can provide opportu￾nities for members to voice their concerns, ask questions, and obtain counseling 
if necessary.
Assess Downsizing Options and Make Relevant Choices. Once the strategy is clear, 
the full range of downsizing options can be identified and assessed. Table 14.8 
describes three primary downsizing methods: workforce reduction, organization 
redesign, and systemic change. A specific downsizing strategy may use elements 
of all three approaches. Workforce reduction is aimed at reducing the number 
of employees, usually in a relatively short timeframe. It can include attrition, 
retirement incentives, outplacement services, and layoffs. Organization redesign 
attempts to restructure the firm to prepare it for the next stage of growth. This 
1.
2.CHAPTER 14 Restructuring Organizations 335
is a medium-term approach that can be accomplished by merging organizational 
units, eliminating management layers, and redesigning tasks. Systemic change is a 
longer-term option aimed at changing the culture and strategic orientation of the 
organization. It can involve interventions that alter the responsibilities and work 
behaviors of everyone in the organization and that promote continual improve￾ment as a way of life in the firm.
Case, a manufacturer of heavy construction equipment, used a variety of meth￾ods to downsize, including eliminating money-losing product lines; narrowing the 
breadth of remaining product lines; bringing customers to the company headquar￾ters to get their opinions of new product design (which surprisingly resulted in 
maintaining, rather than changing, certain preferred features, thus holding down 
redesign costs); shifting production to outside vendors; restructuring debt; and 
spinning off most of its 250 stores. Eventually, these changes led to closing five 
plants and to payroll reductions of almost 35%.31 The number of jobs lost would 
have been much greater, however, if Case had not implemented a variety of down￾sizing methods.
Unfortunately, organizations often choose obvious solutions for downsizing, 
such as layoffs, because they can be implemented quickly. This action produces 
a climate of fear and defensiveness as members focus on identifying who will be 
separated from the organization. Examining a broad range of options and consid￾ering the entire organization rather than only certain areas can help allay fears 
that favoritism and politics are the bases for downsizing decisions. Moreover, 
Text not available due to copyright restrictions336 PART 4 Technostructural Interventions
participation of organization members in such decisions can have positive ben￾efits. It can create a sense of urgency for identifying and implementing options to 
downsizing other than layoffs. Participation can provide members with a clearer 
understanding of how downsizing will proceed and can increase the likelihood that 
whatever choices are made are perceived as reasonable and fair.
3. Implement the Changes. This stage involves implementing methods for reducing the 
size of the organization. Several practices characterize successful implementation. 
First, downsizing is best controlled from the top down. Many difficult decisions 
are required, and a broad perspective helps to overcome people’s natural instincts 
to protect their enterprise or function. Second, specific areas of inefficiency and 
high cost need to be identified and targeted. The morale of the organization can 
be hurt if areas commonly known to be redundant are left untouched. Third, spe￾cific actions should be linked to the organization’s strategy. Organization members 
need to be reminded consistently that restructuring activities are part of a plan to 
improve the organization’s performance. Finally, communicate frequently using a 
variety of media. This keeps people informed, lowers their anxiety over the pro￾cess, and makes it easier for them to focus on their work.
4. Address the Needs of Survivors and Those Who Leave. Most downsizing eventually 
involves reduction in the size of the workforce, and it is important to support not 
only employees who remain with the organization but also those who leave. When 
layoffs occur, employees are generally asked to take on additional responsibilities 
and to learn new jobs, often with little or no increase in compensation. This added 
workload can be stressful, and when combined with anxiety over past layoffs and 
possible future ones, it can lead to what researchers have labeled the “survivor 
syndrome.”32 This syndrome involves a narrow set of self-absorbed and risk-averse 
behaviors that can threaten the organization’s survival. Rather than working to 
ensure the organization’s success, survivors often are preoccupied with whether 
additional layoffs will occur, with guilt over receiving pay and benefits while 
coworkers are struggling with termination, and with the uncertainty of career 
advancement.
Organizations can address these survivor concerns with communication processes 
that increase the amount and frequency of information provided. Communication 
should shift from explanations about who left or why to clarification of where the 
company is going, including its visions, strategies, and goals. The linkage between 
employees’ performance and strategic success is emphasized so that remaining 
members feel they are valued. Organizations also can support survivors through 
training and development activities that prepare them for the new work they are 
being asked to perform. Senior management can promote greater involvement in 
decision making, thus reinforcing the message that people are important to the 
future success and growth of the organization.
Given the negative consequences typically associated with job loss, organizations 
have developed an array of methods to help employees who have been laid off. 
These include outplacement counseling, personal and family counseling, severance 
packages, office support for job searches, relocation services, and job retraining. 
Each service is intended to assist employees in their transition to another work 
situation.
5. Follow Through with Growth Plans. This final stage of downsizing involves imple￾menting an organization renewal and growth process. Failure to move quickly 
to implement growth plans is a key determinant of ineffective downsizing.33 For 
example, a study of 1,020 human resource directors reported that only 44% of 
the companies that had downsized in the previous five years shared details of 
their growth plans with employees; only 34% told employees how they would 
fit into the company’s new strategy.34 Organizations must ensure that employees CHAPTER 14 Restructuring Organizations 337
understand the renewal strategy and their new roles in it. Employees need cred￾ible expectations that, although the organization has been through a tough period, 
their renewed efforts can move it forward.
Application 14.3 describes the process of a strategically focused downsizing effort at 
Agilent Technologies.35 It demonstrates how a senior leader built on the firm’s strategy 
and culture, as well as important OD concepts, to manage a severe downturn in its 
business.
Results of Downsizing
The empirical research on downsizing is mostly negative.36 A review conducted by the 
National Research Council concluded, “From the research produced thus far, downsiz￾ing as a strategy for improvement has proven to be, by and large, a failure.” A number 
of studies have documented the negative productivity and employee consequences. 
One survey of 1,005 companies that used downsizing to reduce costs reported that 
fewer than half of the firms actually met cost targets. Moreover, only 22% of the 
companies achieved expected productivity gains, and consequently about 80% of the 
firms needed to rehire some of the same people that they had previously terminated. 
Fewer than 33% of the companies surveyed reported that profits increased as much as 
expected, and only 21% achieved satisfactory improvements in shareholder return on 
investment. Another survey of 1,142 downsized firms found that only about a third 
achieved productivity goals. In addition, the research points to a number of prob￾lems at the individual level, including increased stress and illness, loss of self-esteem, 
reduced trust and loyalty, and marriage and family disruptions.37
Research on the effects of downsizing on financial performance also shows nega￾tive results.38 One study examined an array of financial performance measures, such as 
return on sales, assets, and equity, in 210 companies that announced layoffs. It found 
that increases in financial performance in the first year following the layoff announce￾ments were not followed by performance improvements in the next year. In no case did 
a firm’s financial performance after a layoff announcement match its maximum levels 
of performance in the year before the announcement. These results suggest that layoffs 
may result in initial improvements in financial performance, but such gains are tempo￾rary and not sustained at even pre-layoff levels. In a similar study of 16 firms that wrote 
off more than 10% of their net worth in a five-year period, stock prices, which averaged 
16% below the market average before the layoff announcements, increased on the day 
that the restructuring was announced but then began to steadily decline. Two years 
after the layoff announcements, 10 of the 16 stocks were trading below the market by 
17–48%, and 12 of the 16 were below comparable firms in their industries by 5–45%.
These research findings paint a rather bleak picture of the success of downsizing. 
The results must be interpreted cautiously, however, for three reasons. First, many of 
the survey-oriented studies received responses from human resources specialists who 
might have been naturally inclined to view downsizing in a negative light. Second, 
the studies of financial performance may have included a biased sample of firms. If 
the companies selected for analysis had been poorly managed, then downsizing alone 
would have been unlikely to improve financial performance. There is some empirical 
support for this view because low-performing firms are more likely to engage in down￾sizing than are high-performing firms.39
Third, disappointing results may be a function of the way downsizing was implemented. 
A number of organizations, such as Florida Power and Light, General Electric, Motorola, 
Texas Instruments, Boeing, DaimlerChrysler, and Hewlett-Packard, have posted solid 
financial returns following downsizing.40 A study of 30 downsized firms in the auto￾mobile industry showed that those companies that implemented effectively the process 
described above scored significantly higher on several performance measures than did Agilent Technologies was the $8.3 billion electronic 
components, test, and measurement instruments 
business that was spun off from Hewlett-Packard 
in 1999. Agilent’s core technologies were mostly 
unfamiliar to the ordinary consumer and understood 
only by its engineering and scientific customers. 
The keys to success were technological superior￾ity and the highest levels of product quality. In 
Agilent’s first year, it seemed CEO Ned Barnholt, 
a 35-year HP veteran, had found the right formula 
when the company announced in March 2000 that 
it had developed an innovative photonic switch 
for all-optical networks. Its stock price increased 
39% in one day. Hiring increased as well and by 
November 2000, Agilent employed 47,000 people.
Agilent’s culture was closely aligned with the “HP 
Way”—a management philosophy devised by 
Hewlett and Packard (“Bill and Dave”) that spells out 
how to treat customers, shareholders, and most of all 
employees. The HP Way suggests that everyone will 
give their best if they are treated honestly, involved 
in decisions, and listened to. Barnholt adopted the HP 
Way but with a twist for the new firm. He believed 
that three “values”—speed, accountability, and 
focus—should guide Agilent practices. To reinforce 
those values, he instituted a pay-for-performance 
plan and retrained all 6,000 managers to get them 
making decisions faster and better.
By 2001, and despite its early success, Agilent was 
feeling the crunch of an overall downturn in the 
economy as well as the pressure from canceled 
orders by its primary telecommunications custom￾ers. A variety of forces, including over-capacity, 
unrealistic Wall Street expectations, the dot.com 
failures, and tight investment capital, forced many 
telecom companies to either cancel or greatly 
reduce their orders. Agilent’s response provides 
important lessons in managing in difficult times.
In March of 2001, Barnholt met with his senior 
team, most of whom had been with HP for decades, 
and discussed the implications of the telecom 
industry’s downturn. Barnholt wanted to find a 
way to cut costs temporarily. What would Bill and 
Dave do? The answer, it turned out, was written 
in history. They would do the same thing they had 
done when HP’s business soured in the 1970s: Cut 
expenses and then, if necessary, cut salaries.
Agilent provided employees with a stream of 
information—in emails, internal newsletters, and 
regular team meetings—about the business situa￾tion and the plan for addressing it, including why 
the cuts were necessary and how savings would 
help. Barnholt delivered his own take on the situ￾ation by using one of his regular communication 
channels—every quarter on the day Agilent releases 
its numbers to Wall Street, his recorded-speech on 
the state of affairs is given to employees. This time, 
everyone heard the message together—we need to 
cut costs any way we can. So Barnholt froze hiring 
and eliminated about 5,000 temporary positions. He 
then asked all employees to cut discretionary spend￾ing without explaining where, how, or how much.
The shift in the environment and management’s call 
for cost cutting translated into a variety of responses. 
For example, employees built Web sites to house 
data that once were printed out; they doubled up 
on rooms on business trips; they brought bags of 
chips to recruiting events instead of calling in cater￾ing. Without specific guidelines, no one knew how 
much they had to cut, so they tried to cut as much 
as possible. Juan Yamuni, a 33-year-old analyst in 
Agilent’s international treasury department, reflected 
the general sentiment: “Top management was good 
about guiding you instead of giving ‘direct order’ 
from upstairs.”
Through strictly volunteer efforts, the company 
cut its travel expenses 50% and its printer and PC 
purchases 70%. But that wasn’t enough to slow 
the decline in revenue per employee from $71,000 
a quarter at the end of October 2000 to $54,000 a 
quarter in April 2001. Net income per employee 
fell from $6,500 to $1,900 in the same period. At 
that point, Barnholt announced a temporary 10% 
across-the-board salary cut to get $280 million 
in annual savings. Employees cheered the move. 
“This was a matter of saving employees,” says Stacy 
Yu, 25, who handles marketing for fiber-optic 
products. “Everyone knows that we have to chip in 
to make sure that everyone else is okay.”
When sales orders continued to plummet, 
Barnholt was forced to cut staff, something that 
Hewlett and Packard had never had to. In mid￾June, Barnholt gathered his management team 
and challenged them to find a way to slash 4,000 
people, about 9% of the company, and to do it 
without making them or the survivors feel mis￾treated. That is, getting caught in a downsizing 
effort isn’t surprising, but what was surprising 
Strategic Downsizing at Agilent Technologies
application 14.3CHAPTER 14 Restructuring Organizations 339
was the way the process was conducted and the 
results it produced. Barnholt laid out a tough set 
of ground rules: Employees were to be told they 
were being let go only by their direct managers, 
and no across-the-board cuts were to take place. 
Barnholt wanted everything handled division 
by division, looking at each program and each 
employee. In keeping with his values, he wanted 
the names in a month. “I was very worried,” he 
said. “We were in new territory. Our people don’t 
have experience with this.” In fact, many of the 
employees who were eventually out of a job did 
not spend their final days updating resumes on 
company time or sabotaging customers, but by 
working harder, longer, and more productively.
To achieve these goals, Agilent went on a downsiz￾ing campaign that was two parts communication, 
one part execution. First, Barnholt knew that he 
had to set the tone. On the day Agilent would 
report its first ever quarterly loss, he broke tradi￾tion and announced the downsizing before releas￾ing the information to Wall Street and before the 
employees heard about it through the media. He 
thanked everyone for cutting costs and cutting sala￾ries, and then he presented the business situation. 
Barnholt said that downsizing was unavoidable, 
and he detailed how many people would lose their 
jobs, where the number came from, and how the 
“painful” process would work. “This is the toughest 
decision of my career,” he said. “But we’ve run out 
of alternatives.”
Second, managers had to do their part in commu￾nicating and managing the layoffs. More than 3,000 
managers went through a series of daylong training 
sessions at an outplacement firm where they role￾played and listened to the right and wrong ways to 
let people go. Back at Agilent, managers were told 
to be as honest as possible, to keep the door even 
more open than usual, and to field every question. 
For example, Dave Allen, the general manager of a 
semiconductor plant in Newark, CA, delivered the 
news. Agilent’s top management figured that they 
could save millions by shutting it down and moving 
only about 5% of Newark’s 300 people to a bigger 
plant in Colorado. Standing in the cafeteria in early 
September, he explained the cost savings and told 
the workers that almost all of them would be out of 
a job within a year. The plant, he said, would close 
by October 2002. But he also said that since the 
chips were in high demand and since the manufac￾turing process was so new, he needed everyone to 
stay focused and committed.
At first, everything went to hell. For ten days, 
production dropped. Then it went up, and up 
again. Soon, the Newark plant was producing 
more chips at a faster rate than anyone had fore￾cast. “We were brutally honest with them about 
what we’re doing, what drove the decision, what 
the timing is, what’s going to happen,” explains 
Allen. “That honesty and integrity up-front is 
critical. If you don’t have it, you lose their hearts 
and their minds, and they won’t be productive.” 
For the workers, a more basic human instinct was 
at play—like the desire to hold on to a job. “Well,” 
said Mary Dominguez, a 16-year employee at the 
plant, “maybe the Colorado plant won’t work. 
And maybe they’ll let us stay.”
At the same time they were communicating, man￾agers had to evaluate every program and position 
they oversaw to come up with the 4,000 total. 
Forms used to help in the analysis were posted on 
Agilent’s intranet; employees could see the criteria 
by which they’d be measured.
Just as people were being told whether they’d stay or 
go, September 11 hit, and with it, the likelihood of a 
quick recovery. Barnholt again met with his senior 
leaders and announced in November that another 
9% would have to be cut. From a high of 47,000, the 
organization expected to eliminate 8,000 full-time 
workers and almost 5,000 temporary workers, or 
27% of Agilent’s workforce. The downsizing process 
was repeated, with Barnholt crafting a new message 
and managers submitting new names.
“I knew that this wasn’t part of the HP Way, and 
it’s not what Bill and Dave would have wanted,” 
said one employee who joined Agilent right out 
of college. “But if they were faced with the same 
situation, they would have had to do the exact 
same thing. And even though all of us probably 
lost sleep worrying about our jobs and whether 
we’d have them or not, I know [Barnholt] prob￾ably lost a lot more having to get up there in front 
of everybody and make this announcement.”
At least part of the reason Agilent was so success￾ful in its downsizing efforts was the way it gained 
employees’ trust and managed its initial growth. 
Agilent had succeeded in turning the “us vs. them” 
of corporate downsizing into just “us.” Agilent made 
a series of smart moves involving good manage￾ment, good planning, and most of all, empathy. In 
perhaps the best measure of its success, despite the 
downsizing, Agilent was No. 31 on Fortune’s 2002’s 
list of the Best Companies to Work For.340 PART 4 Technostructural Interventions
firms that had no downsizing strategy or that implemented the steps poorly.41 Several 
studies have suggested that where downsizing programs adopt appropriate OD inter￾ventions or apply strategies similar to the process outlined above, they generate more 
positive individual and organ-izational results.42 Thus, the success of downsizing efforts 
may depend as much on how effectively the intervention is applied as on the size of the 
layoffs or the amount of delayering.
REENGINEERING
The final restructuring intervention is reengineering—the fundamental rethinking 
and radical redesign of business processes to achieve dramatic improvements in per￾formance.43 Reengineering transforms how organizations traditionally produce and 
deliver goods and services. Beginning with the Industrial Revolution, organizations 
have increasingly fragmented work into specialized units, each focusing on a limited 
part of the overall production process. Although this division of labor has enabled 
organizations to mass-produce standardized products and services efficiently, it can be 
overly complicated, difficult to manage, and slow to respond to the rapid and unpre￾dictable changes experienced by many organizations today. Reengineering addresses 
these problems by breaking down specialized work units into more integrated, cross￾functional work processes. This streamlines work processes and makes them faster 
and more flexible; consequently, they are more responsive to changes in competitive 
conditions, customer demands, product life cycles, and technologies.44
As might be expected, successful reengineering requires an almost revolutionary 
change in how organizations design their structures and their work. It identifies and 
questions the often-unexamined assumptions underlying how organizations perform 
work and why do they do it in a particular way. This effort typically results in radi￾cal changes in thinking and work methods—a shift from specialized jobs, tasks, and 
structures to integrated processes that deliver value to customers. Such revolutionary 
change differs considerably from incremental approaches to performance improve￾ment, such as continuous improvement and total quality management (Chapter 15), 
which emphasize incremental changes in existing work processes. Because reengineer￾ing radically alters the status quo, it seeks to produce dramatic increases in organization 
performance.
Reengineering seeks to leverage information technology when large-scale business 
processes, such as supply chain logistics, change radically. These complex systems 
can help organizations to break out of traditional ways of thinking about work and 
embrace entirely new ways of producing and delivering products. The most popular 
software systems, SAP and PeopleSoft, standardize information flows and help to inte￾grate data on a range of tasks and link work processes together. On the other hand, 
many reengineering projects fail because existing information systems do not provide 
the data needed to operate integrated business processes.45 Such legacy systems do not 
allow interdependent departments to interface with each other; they often require new 
information to be entered manually into separate computer systems before people in 
different work areas can access it.
Reengineering also is associated with downsizing, the shift from functional to 
process-based structures, and work design (Chapter 16). Although these interven￾tions have different conceptual and applied backgrounds, they overlap considerably 
in practice. Reengineering can result in production and delivery processes that require 
fewer people and fewer layers of management. Conversely, downsizing may require 
subsequent reengineering interventions. When downsizing occurs without fundamen￾tal changes in how work is performed, the same tasks simply are being performed with 
a smaller number of people. Thus, expected cost savings may not be realized because 
lower salaries and fewer benefits are offset by lower productivity.CHAPTER 14 Restructuring Organizations 341
Reengineering also can be linked to transformation of organization structures and 
work design. Its focus on work processes helps to break down the vertical orienta￾tion of functional and divisional organizations. The endeavor identifies and assesses 
core business processes and redesigns work to account for key task interdependencies 
running through them. That typically results in new jobs or teams that emphasize 
multifunctional tasks, results-oriented feedback, and employee empowerment—char￾acteristics associated with motivational and sociotechnical approaches to work design. 
Regrettably, reengineering initially failed to apply these approaches’ attention to indi￾vidual differences in people’s reactions to work to its own work-design prescriptions. It 
advocated enriched work and teams, without consideration for the wealth of research 
that shows that not all people are motivated to perform such work.46
Application Stages
Early reengineering efforts emphasized identifying which business processes to reen￾gineer and technically assessing the work flow. More recent efforts have extended 
reengineering practice to address issues of managing change, such as how to deal with 
resistance to change and how to manage the transition to new work processes.47 The 
following application steps are included in most reengineering efforts, although the 
order may change slightly from one situation to another:48
Prepare the Organization. Reengineering begins with clarification and assessment 
of the organization’s context, including its competitive environment, strategy, and 
objectives. This effort establishes and communicates the need for reengineering 
and the strategic direction that the process should follow. Preparing for reengineer￾ing at the Veterans Administration health care system was made easier because 
everyone agreed the health care delivery process was broken. Veterans’ groups 
were outspoken in their complaints of quality care, it was publicly ridiculed in the 
movie The Fourth of July with Tom Cruise, and many patients were figuratively 
“falling through the cracks.” The old way of doing business, reinforced by years of 
government protection and a long period of peace, seriously saddled the organiza￾tion with high costs, old systems, and siloed processes.49
The VA’s leadership, led by Kenneth Kizer, recognized that the keys to the firm’s 
success were low costs and customer satisfaction. Consequently, they set dramatic 
goals of increasing patient visits while holding annual cost per patient steady. 
Defining these objectives gave the reengineering effort a clear focus.
A final task in preparing the organization is to communicate clearly—through 
words and deeds—why reengineering is necessary and the direction it will take. 
The VA’s preparation included not only traditional communications through 
speeches, newsletters, and meetings, but visible commitments such as reorganiz￾ing the pharmacy organization and making substantial technology commitments 
to an electronic medical record system. Thus, senior executives were careful to 
communicate, both verbally and behaviorally, that they were fully committed to 
the change effort. Demonstration of such unwavering support seems necessary if 
organization members are to challenge their traditional thinking about how busi￾ness should be conducted.
2. Fundamentally Rethink the Way Work Gets Done. This step lies at the heart of 
reengineering and involves these activities: identifying and analyzing core busi￾ness processes, defining their key performance objectives, and designing new pro￾cesses. These tasks are the real work of reengineering and typically are performed 
by a cross-functional design team who is given considerable time and resources to 
accomplish them.50
a. Identify and analyze core business processes. Core processes are consid￾ered essential for strategic success. They include activities that transform inputs 
1.342 PART 4 Technostructural Interventions
into valued outputs. Core processes typically are assessed through development 
of a process map that identifies the three to five activities required to deliver an 
organization’s products or services. For a health care system, the core processes 
include the intake of patients through the primary care physician, inpatient 
and outpatient services, and medical records and billing.
Analysis of core business processes can include assigning costs to each of 
the major phases of the work flow to help identify costs that may be hidden 
in the activities of the production process. Traditional cost-accounting systems 
do not store data in process terms; they identify costs according to categories 
of expense, such as salaries, fixed costs, and supplies.51 This method of cost 
accounting can be misleading and can result in erroneous conclusions about 
how best to reduce costs. For example, most traditional accounting systems 
suggest that salaries and fringe benefits account for the largest percentage of 
total costs—an assessment that supports workforce downsizing as the most 
effective way to lower costs. An activity-based accounting system often reveals 
a different picture—that rework, errors, and delays during the workflow are 
major sources of uncessary cost.
Business processes also can be assessed in terms of value-added activities—
the amount of value contributed to a product or service by a particular step in 
the process. For example, early in the VA’s process, senior managers learned 
that only 10% of the patients covered by the VA had a primary care physician. 
By assigning a primary care physician to each veteran patient, the total cost of 
care was greatly reduced. Patients saw one physician who could address many 
issues rather than making mutliple visits to a variety of specialists. Conversely, 
organizations often engage in a variety of process activities that have little or 
no added value.
b. Define performance objectives. Challenging performance goals are set in 
this step. The highest possible level of performance for any particular process 
is identified, and dramatic goals are set for speed, quality, cost, or other mea￾sures of performance. These standards can derive from customer requirements 
or from benchmarks of the best practices of industry leaders. For example, 
at Andersen Windows, the demand for unique window shapes pushed the 
number of different products from 28,000 to more than 86,000 in 1991.52 The 
pressure on the shop floor for a “batch of one” resulted in 20% of all ship￾ments containing at least one order discrepancy. As part of its reengineering 
effort, Andersen set targets for ease of ordering, manufacturing, and delivery. 
Each retailer and distributor was sold an interactive, computerized version of 
its catalog that allowed customers to design their own windows. The resulting 
design is then given a unique “license plate number” and the specifications are 
sent directly to the factory. By 1995, new sales had tripled at some retail loca￾tions, the number of products had increased to 188,000, and fewer than 1 in 
200 shipments had a discrepancy.
c. Design new processes. This task involves designing new business processes 
to achieve breakthrough goals. It often starts with a clean sheet of paper and 
addresses the question “If we were starting this company today, what is the 
most effective and efficient way to deliver this product or service?” Each essen￾tial process is then designed according to the following guidelines:53
Begin and end the process with the needs and wants of the customer.
Simplify the current process by combining and eliminating steps.
Use the “best of what is” in the current process.
Attend to both technical and social aspects of the process.
Do not be constrained by past practice.

•CHAPTER 14 Restructuring Organizations 343
Identify the critical information required at each step in the process.
Perform activities in their most natural order.
Assume the work gets done right the first time.
Listen to people who do the work.
An important activity that appears in many successful reengineering 
efforts is implementing “early wins” or “quick hits.” Analysis of existing 
processes often reveals obvious redundancies and inefficiencies for which 
appropriate changes may be authorized immediately. These early successes 
can help generate and sustain momentum in the reengineering effort.
3. Restructure the Organization Around the New Business Processes. This last step in 
reengineering involves changing the organization’s structure to support the new 
business processes. This endeavor typically results in the kinds of process-based 
structures that were described earlier in this chapter. Reengineered organizations 
typically have the following characteristics:54
Work units change from functional departments to process teams.
Jobs change from simple tasks to multidimensional work.
People’s roles change from controlled to empowered.
The focus of performance measures and compensation shifts from activities
to results.
Organization structures change from hierarchical to flat.
Managers change from supervisors to coaches; executives change from
scorekeepers to leaders.
The VA’s experience reflects many of these features. As suggested earlier, the key to 
a reengineered organization is often its commitment to and development of an inte￾grated information system. During the VA’s reengineering, it was an electronic medical 
record system that integrated nearly every step in the patient care process. The fol￾lowing examples support how the information system radically transformed the way 
patient care was delivered:
A physician working at his desk gets a reminder that one of his patients in the hos￾pital, a 44-year-old diabetic, is due to have an eye exam. Through the system, the 
doctor asks the floor nurse to send him to the eye clinic on the second floor, where 
an ophthalmologist administers the test. An alert soon flashes on the doctor’s screen 
saying the exam has been completed.
A nurse on a different floor uses the same computer network to make sure she’s 
giving the right medication to a 60-year-old patient with high blood pressure. With 
a handheld device, she scans a bar-coded bracelet on her patient’s wrist and then 
a bar code on the drug bottle. A nearby computer linked to the hospital pharmacy 
confirms that she’s giving the right drug to the right patient.
In the Tele-Health unit, a nurse reads the vital statistics of a 57-year-old patient 
that were sent to her computer via an electronic system that the VA has rigged at 
his home. Today the news is worrisome: The patient, who is suffering from heart 
disease, has gained three pounds overnight, indicating that he’s retaining fluids. 
After a few quick phone calls to the patient and his doctor, she tells him to double 
his diuretic medication today. “We caught him before his condition got worse,” she 
says with satisfaction.
Application 14.4 describes the reengineering efforts at Honeywell’s Industrial 
Automation and Control business. It highlights the importance of mapping current 
processes and aligning the rest of the organization to support the change, especially 
information technology.55

•Honeywell (http://www.honeywell.com) is a diver￾sified technology and manufacuring organization 
that serves customers worldwide with aerospace 
products and services; control technologies for 
buildings, homes, and industry; automotive prod￾ucts; and specialty materials. Its industrial automa￾tion and control (IAC) business unit in Phoenix, 
Arizona, is responsibile for the design, manufacture, 
and configuration of world-class process control 
equipment marketed as the TDC 3000X family of 
systems. Their customer base includes refineries, 
chemical plants, and paper mills around the world.
In response to declining performance results, IAC 
management set out to implement an ISO 9000 
certified quality program named TotalPlant™ as part 
of an effort to optimize global customer satisfac￾tion. The objectives of this initiative were reducing 
defects, minimizing production cycles, and optimiz￾ing resource management. The TotalPlant™ initiative 
was a business process reengineering i ntervention 
based upon four principles: process mapping, fail￾safing, teamwork, and communication. Cross￾functional multiskilled teams were created and given 
responsibility for an entire module or product line. 
Each team member was then educated in each of the 
principles and empowered to enact them to create 
improvements within their work groups.
Process mapping is a methodology that converts 
any business activity into a graphical form. It cre￾ates a common visual language that can be used 
to enhance an employee’s ability to see beyond 
the boundaries of their work process. It is also 
the basis of radical change in business processes. 
As part of the TotalPlant™ initiative, process 
mapping consisted of eight major stages.
• The first three stages were to select the process 
to be reviewed, identify all customers, and 
set the boundaries of the process. Through 
consensus decision making, these simple steps 
kept the participants focused on the process 
being mapped. In addition, the team reviewed 
its composition to ensure that all appropriate 
functions were represented.
• Fourth, the team developed an “as is” map. 
This required them to outline and document 
the existing process. By creating a visual map 
the team was able to identify the flow of both 
the product and the information related to the 
process. Cross-functional decision points and 
dependencies became visually apparent through 
the process. Fifth, the “as is” map was used by 
the team to calculate cycle times, the elapsed 
times between the start of a process and the 
conclusion of a process, as well as the distance 
the product travels during that cycle. Both the 
mean and the range were calculated for each 
process cycle time.
• Sixth, the team identified areas of improvement 
that did not require additional costs or resources. 
Non-value-added steps, extended approval proc￾esses, and processes with highly variant cycle 
times were analyzed and either streamlined or 
completely eliminated. Following this step, the 
seventh stage was to develop a “should be” map 
that described the improved process.
• Finally, the eighth step directed the team to 
develop a process implementation plan, establish 
confirmation from a steering committee, and 
then implement it. New goals were established 
and results tracked for each of the process steps.
The second major component of the TotalPlant™ 
process was the fail-safing process. Fail-safing is a 
five-step process intended to create a product that 
is defect free by identifying and analyzing defects, 
and understanding their root causes. A root cause 
has three characteristics: (1) it is defined as being 
the cause of the defect; (2) it is possible to change 
the cause; and (3) if eliminated, the defect will be 
eliminated or at least significantly reduced. Once 
the root cause is identified, a set of alternative solu￾tions is developed to eliminate the defect in future 
product. Each alternative is evaluated for ease of 
implementation, cost, and time to implement.
Once a solution is agreed upon, the team 
implements the PDCA (Plan, Do, Check, Act) 
process to move the solution forward. Planning 
includes developing a full implementation plan, 
which includes areas impacted, timing, resource 
requirements, and costs. This becomes a living 
document outlining the action items needed to 
implement the change. “Doing” consists of exe￾cuting against the implementation plan. Once the 
new process has been implemented, the results 
are “checked” to ensure that they are in line 
Honeywell IAC’s Totalplant™
Reengineering Process
application 14.4345
with the desired results. Finally, the team must 
“act” to determine the next steps for continuous 
improvement.
Teamwork was the critical third piece of the 
TotalPlant™ process. Honeywell realized that the 
transition to a team environment needed to hap￾pen gradually. Through the process mapping and 
fail-safing process, they gave people real problems 
to solve and systematic tools with which to solve 
them. With the addition of education and training 
around teams, these “hard-skill” activities became 
the fertile soil for team development. As team 
members were asked to own the whole process, 
an environment that fosters teamwork was cre￾ated. Creativity, innovation, and risk taking were 
rewarded and the values of the organization moved 
to trust, respect, and empowerment. Managers 
were educated to support the teams, not run them 
in order to further enrich the team environment.
The final and foundational element of the 
TotalPlant™ process was communication. Top 
management’s successful communication of the 
TotalPlant™ paradigm shift was pivotal to the 
initiative’s success. Through their everyday actions, 
top management lived the values of open commu￾nication throughout the organization. In addition, 
teams were given training in conflict resolution, 
problem solving, and listening skills to enhance 
the overall effectiveness of communication within 
the teams. The creation of a positive, open envi￾ronment became critical to the success of the 
change initiative being undertaken. Top manage￾ment understood that the environment needed to 
shift to consistently support teamwork, creativity, 
and “new thinking.” The major challenges within 
the process took the form of middle-management 
resistance. The new team concepts made manag￾ers who had been functional or process experts 
move outside their comfort zone by requiring 
them to look at processes across functions and 
broaden their view of success. Top management 
was required to move from command and control 
to a more facilitative and empowering approach 
to support this type of behavior change.
In addition to the four major components of the 
TotalPlant™ process, Honeywell made significant 
changes in the technology strategy to support the 
business strategy. The information systems group 
was converted into an information technology 
shop where all technology was developed in direct 
support of the plant and its operations. All systems 
were fully integrated to optimize the timeliness and 
accurracy of information.
After three years, performance results indicated 
a reduction in defects of 70%, customer rejects 
declined by 57%, and there was a 46% reduction 
in inventory investments. Honeywell’s execution 
against their vision is what set this business pro￾cess reengineering apart from others. Top man￾agement did not just speak the vision, they lived 
and supported it through active participation in 
the entire change process. Another critical com￾ponent was that the organizational structure was 
redesigned to align with the new processes and 
strategies. Top management at Honeywell under￾stood that change of this magnitude takes time 
and therefore were able to set the organization’s 
expectations accordingly. Additionally, they com￾mitted appropriate levels of training and financial 
resources to make the initiative a success.
The Honeywell case provides some excellent 
learnings for making a reengineering initiative 
successful. First, people are the key enablers of 
change. They must be trained, developed, and 
rewarded to support the change process. Second, 
people must be able to question all of their assump￾tions. Nothing can be sacred as each process is 
deconstructed and then rebuilt. Third, process 
mapping provides people with a systematic process 
for analyzing and improving existing systems and 
processes. Next, management must be able to cre￾ate dissatisfaction with the existing process and 
allow the teams to own the solution. An environ￾ment conducive to change must be created and 
supported by management’s attitudes and behav￾iors. This includes active participation at all stages 
of the process.
However, while support and participation from 
the top is important, implementation should take 
place by empowering decision makers at the 
level where the work is being done. Honeywell 
also demonstrated that reengineering must be a 
business-driven and continuous process. Initiatives 
like fail-safing demonstrated the need to continu￾ously challenge the status quo. Stretch goals must 
be set throughout the process to keep employees 
motivated. Finally, the most critical component of 
a successful reengineering initiative is the ability to 
actively implement and execute against the plan. 
By keeping their eye on the end goal, Honeywell 
was able to successfully optimize their customer 
satisfaction through this process.

Results from Reengineering
The results from reengineering vary widely. Industry journals and the business press 
regularly contain accounts of dramatic business outcomes attributable to reengineer￾ing. On the other hand, the best-selling book on reengineering reported that as many 
as 70% of the efforts failed to meet their cost, cycle time, or productivity objectives.56
One study polled 497 companies in the United States and 1,245 companies in Europe, 
and found that 60% of U.S. firms and 75% of European firms had engaged in at 
least one reengineering project. Eighty-five percent of the firms reported little or no 
gain from the efforts.57 Despite its popularity, reengineering is only beginning to be 
evaluated systematically, and there is little research to help unravel the disparate 
results.58
One evaluation of business process reengineering examined more than one hundred 
companies’ efforts.59 In-depth analyses of 20 reengineering projects found that 11 cases 
had total business unit cost reductions of less than 5%, whereas six cases had total 
cost reductions averaging 18%. The primary difference was the scope of the business 
process selected. Reengineering key value-added processes significantly affected total 
business unit costs; reengineering narrow business processes did not.
Similarly, performance improvements in particular processes were associated 
strongly with changes in six key levers of behavior, including structure, skills, 
information systems, roles, incentives, and shared values. Efforts that addressed 
all six levers produced average cost reductions in specific processes by 35%; efforts 
that affected only one or two change levers reduced costs by 19%. Finally, the 
percentage reduction in total unit costs was associated with committed leader￾ship. Similarly, a survey of 23 “successful” reengineering cases found that they 
were characterized by a clear vision of the future, specific goals for change, use of 
information technology, top management’s involvement and commitment, clear 
milestones and measurements, and the training of participants in process analysis 
and teamwork.60
SUMMARY
This chapter presented interventions aimed at restructuring organizations. Several 
basic structures, such as the functional structure, the divisional structure, and the 
matrix configuration, dominate most organizations. Three newer forms, process-based, 
customer-centric, and network-based structures, were also described. Each of these 
structures has corresponding strengths and weaknesses, and supportive conditions 
must be assessed when determining which structure is an appropriate fit with the 
organization’s environment.
Two restructuring interventions were described: downsizing and reengineering. 
Downsizing decreases the size of the organization through workforce reduction or 
organizational redesign. It generally is associated with layoffs where a certain num￾ber or class of organization members are no longer employed by the organization. 
Downsizing can contribute to organization development by focusing on the nization’s 
strategy, using a variety of downsizing tactics, addressing the needs of all organization 
members, and following through with growth plans. Reengineering is the fundamental 
rethinking and radical redesign of business processes to achieve dramatic improve￾ments in performance. It seeks to transform how organizations traditionally produce 
and deliver goods and services. A typical reengineering project prepares the organiza￾tion, rethinks the way work gets done, and restructures the organization around the 
newly designed core processes.CHAPTER 14 Restructuring Organizations 347

Faced with competitive demands for lower 
costs, higher performance, and greater flex￾ibility, organizations are increasingly turning 
to employee involvement (EI) to enhance the 
participation, commitment, and productivity 
of their members. This chapter presents OD 
interventions aimed at moving decision making 
downward in the organization, closer to where 
the actual work takes place. This increased 
employee involvement can lead to quicker, 
more responsive decisions, continuous perfor￾mance improvements, and greater employee 
flexibility, commitment, and satisfaction.
Employee involvement is a broad term that has 
been variously referred to as “empowerment,” 
“participative management,” “engagement,” 
“work design,” “high involvement,” “industrial 
democracy,” and “quality of work life.” It covers 
diverse approaches to gaining greater participa￾tion in relevant workplace decisions. Organiza￾tions such as General Mills, The Hartford, and 
Intel have enhanced worker involvement through 
enriched forms of work; others, such as Verizon, 
Deutsche Telekom, Wells Fargo, and Boeing, 
have increased participation by forming EI teams 
that develop suggestions for improving produc￾tivity and quality; Southwest Airlines, Shell Oil, 
and Nucor Steel have sought greater participa￾tion through union–management cooperation on 
performance and quality-of-work-life issues; and 
still others, such as Texas Instruments, Kimberly￾Clark, 3M, the IRS, and Motorola, have improved 
employee involvement by emphasizing participa￾tion in quality improvement approaches.
As described in Chapter 1, current EI 
approaches evolved from earlier quality-of￾work-life efforts in Europe, Scandinavia, and the 
United States. The terms “employee involve￾ment” and “empowerment” gradually have 
replaced the designation “quality of work life,” 
particularly in the United States. A current 
definition of EI includes four elements that can 
promote meaningful involvement in workplace 
decisions: power, information, knowledge and 
skills, and rewards. These components of EI 
combine to exert powerful effects on productiv￾ity and employee well-being.
Major EI applications discussed in this chapter 
are parallel structures, including cooperative 
union–management projects and quality circles; 
total quality management; and high-involvement 
organizations. Two additional EI approaches, 
work design and reward system interventions, are 
discussed in Chapters 16 and 17, respectively.
EMPLOYEE INVOLVEMENT: WHAT IS IT?
Employee involvement is the current label used to describe a set of practices and 
philosophies that started with the quality-of-work-life movement in the late 1950s. 
The phrase “quality of work life” (QWL) was used to stress the prevailing poor qual￾ity of life at the workplace.1 As described in Chapter 1, both the term “QWL” and the 
meaning attributed to it have undergone considerable change and development. More 
recently, the term “engagement” has been popular, and a great deal of effort has been 
invested in differentiating the term. “Engagement” refers to an organization member’s 
work experience. Engaged employees are motivated, committed, and interested in 
their work.2
 Engagement, then, is the outcome of EI interventions. In this section, we 
15CHAPTER 15 Employee Involvement 351
provide a working definition of EI, document the growth of EI practices in the United 
States and abroad, and clarify the important and often misunderstood relationship 
between EI and productivity.
A Working Definition of Employee Involvement
Employee involvement seeks to increase members’ input into decisions that affect organi￾zation performance and employee well-being.3
 It can be described in terms of four key 
elements that promote worker involvement:4
Power. This element of EI includes providing people with enough authority 
to make work-related decisions covering various issues such as work methods, 
task assignments, performance outcomes, customer service, and employee selec￾tion. The amount of power afforded employees can vary enormously, from sim￾ply asking them for input into decisions that managers subsequently make, to 
managers and workers jointly making decisions, to employees making decisions 
themselves.
Information. Timely access to relevant information is vital to making effective 
decisions. Organizations can promote EI by ensuring that the necessary informa￾tion flows freely to those with decision authority. This can include data about oper￾ating results, business plans, competitive conditions, new technologies and work 
methods, and ideas for organizational improvement.
Knowledge and skills. Employee involvement contributes to organizational 
effectiveness only to the extent that employees have the requisite skills and 
knowledge to make good decisions. Organizations can facilitate EI by providing 
training and development programs for improving members’ knowledge and 
skills. Such learning can cover an array of expertise having to do with performing 
tasks, making decisions, solving problems, and understanding how the business 
operates.
Rewards. Because people generally do those things for which they are recog￾nized, rewards can have a powerful effect on getting people involved in the orga￾nization. Meaningful opportunities for involvement can provide employees with 
internal rewards, such as feelings of self-worth and accomplishment. External 
rewards, such as pay and promotions, can reinforce EI when they are linked 
directly to performance outcomes that result from participation in decision mak￾ing. (Reward systems are discussed more fully in Chapter 17.)
Those four elements—power, information, knowledge and skills, and rewards—con￾tribute to EI success by determining how much employee participation in decision 
making is possible in organizations. To the extent that all four elements are made 
available throughout, and especially in the lower levels of, the organ ization, the 
greater the employee involvement. Furthermore, because the four elements of EI 
are interdependent, they must be changed together to obtain positive results. For 
example, if organization members are given more power and authority to make 
decisions but do not have the information or knowledge and skill to make good deci￾sions, then the value of involvement is likely to be negligible. Similarly, increasing 
employees’ power, information, and knowledge and skills but not linking rewards to 
the performance consequences of changes gives members little incentive to improve 
organizational performance. The EI methods that will be described in this chapter 
vary in how much involvement is afforded employees. Parallel structures, such as 
union–management cooperative efforts and quality circles, are limited in the degree 
that the four elements of EI are moved downward in the organization. Total quality 
management and high-involvement organizations provide far greater opportunities 
for involvement.

The number of organizations using EI practices is growing in both the United States 
and Europe. In the most comprehensive, long-term study of EI applications, Lawler and 
his colleagues at the Center for Effective Organizations at the University of Southern 
California have surveyed the Fortune 1000 every three years between 1987 and 2005.5
Their data show positive trends in EI use among these firms over that time period, includ￾ing both a growing number of firms applying EI and a greater percentage of the workforce 
included in such programs. Despite these positive trends, however, their research reveals 
that the scope and depth of EI interventions are relatively modest. For EI interventions 
that don’t involve large and systematic shifts in power, information, knowledge and 
skills, and rewards, such as suggestion systems and survey feedback, most of the Fortune 
500 involve more than 20% of the workforce. But for more powerful EI interventions, 
fewer than 20% of the workforce is involved. Thus, although many large organizations 
are using EI practices, there is considerable room for their diffusion across organizations 
and throughout the workforce.
Similarly, EI has prospered outside of the United States. Countries using EI in west￾ern Europe include France, Germany, Denmark, Ireland, Sweden, Norway, Holland, 
Italy, and Great Britain.6
 Although the tremendous changes currently taking place 
in countries such as Russia, Bulgaria, the Philippines, and the People’s Republic of 
China may have dampened EI efforts, several programs are actively under way.7
Canada, Mexico, India, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, and Japan also are using 
EI. Internationally, EI may be considered a set of processes directed at changing the 
structure of the work situation within a particular cultural environment and under the 
influence of particular values and philosophies. As a result, in some instances, EI has 
been promoted by unions; in others, by management. In some cases, it has been part 
of a pragmatic approach to increasing productivity; in other cases, it has been driven 
by socialist values.8
How Employee Involvement Affects Productivity
An assumption underlying much of the EI literature is that such interventions will 
lead to higher productivity. Although this premise has been based mainly on anecdotal 
evidence and a good deal of speculation, there is now a growing body of research find￾ings to support that linkage.9
 Studies have found a consistent relationship between EI 
practices and such measures as productivity, financial performance, customer satisfac￾tion, labor hours, and waste rates.
Attempts to explain this positive linkage traditionally have followed the idea that giv￾ing people more involvement in work decisions raises their job satisfaction and, in turn, 
their productivity. There is growing evidence that this satisfaction-causes-productivity 
premise is too simplistic and sometimes wrong.
A more realistic explanation for how EI interventions can affect productivity is 
shown in Figure 15.1. EI practices, such as participation in workplace decisions, can 
improve productivity in at least three ways.10 First, such interventions can improve 
communication and coordination among employees and organizational depart￾ments, and help integrate the different jobs or departments that contribute to an 
overall task.
Second, EI interventions can improve employee motivation, particularly when they 
satisfy important individual needs. Motivation is translated into improved performance 
when people have the necessary skills and knowledge to perform well and when the 
technology and work situation allow people to affect productivity. For example, some 
jobs are so rigidly controlled and specified that individual motivation can have little 
impact on productivity.CHAPTER 15 Employee Involvement 353
Third, EI practices can improve the capabilities of employees, thus enabling them to 
perform better. For example, attempts to increase employee participation in decision 
making generally include skill training in group problem solving and communication.
Figure 15.2 shows the secondary effects of EI. These practices increase employee 
well-being and satisfaction by providing a better work environment and a more fulfill￾ing job. Improved productivity also can increase satisfaction, particularly when it leads 
to greater rewards. Increased employee satisfaction, deriving from EI interventions and 
increased productivity, ultimately can have a still greater impact on productivity by 
attracting good employees to join and remain with the organization.
In sum, EI interventions are expected to increase productivity by improving com￾munication and coordination, employee motivation, and individual capabilities.

They also can influence productivity by means of the secondary effects of increased 
employee well-being and satisfaction. Although a growing body of EI and engagement 
research supports these relationships,11 there is considerable debate over the strength 
of the association between EI and productivity.12 Recent data support the conclusion 
that relatively modest levels of EI produce moderate improvements in performance 
and satisfaction and that higher levels of EI produce correspondingly higher levels of 
performance.13
EMPLOYEE INVOLVEMENT APPLICATIONS
This section describes three major EI applications that vary in the amounts of power, 
information, knowledge and skills, and rewards that are moved downward through 
the organization (from least to most involvement): parallel structures, including coop￾erative union–management projects and quality circles; total quality management; and 
high-involvement organizations.
Parallel Structures
Parallel structures involve members in resolving ill-defined, complex problems and 
build adaptability into bureaucratic organizations.14 Also known as “collateral struc￾tures,” “dualistic structures,” or “shadow structures,”15 parallel structures operate in 
conjunction with the formal organization. They provide members with an alternative 
setting in which to address problems and to propose innovative solutions free from 
the existing, formal organization structure and culture. For example, members may 
attend periodic off-site meetings to explore ways to improve quality in their work 
area or they may be temporarily assigned to a special project or facility to devise new 
products or solutions to organizational problems. Parallel structures facilitate problem 
solving and change by providing time and resources for members to think, talk, and 
act in completely new ways. Consequently, norms and procedures for working in 
parallel structures are entirely different from those of the formal organization. This 
section describes the application steps associated with the two most common parallel 
structures, cooperative union–management projects and quality circles, and reviews 
the research on their effectiveness.
Application Stages Cooperative union–management projects and quality circle inter￾ventions fall at the lower end of the EI scale. Member participation and influence typi￾cally are restricted to making proposals and to offering suggestions for change because 
subsequent decisions about implementing the proposals are reserved for management. 
Membership in parallel structures also tends to be limited, primarily to volunteers and 
to numbers of employees for which there are adequate resources. Management heav￾ily influences the conditions under which parallel structures operate. It controls the 
amount of authority that members have in making recommendations, the amount of 
information that is shared with them, the amount of training they receive to increase 
their knowledge and skills, and the amount of monetary rewards for participation. 
Because parallel structures offer limited amounts of EI, they are most appropriate for 
organizations with little or no history of employee participation, top-down management 
styles, and bureaucratic cultures.
Cooperative union–management and quality circle programs typically are imple￾mented in the following steps:16
Define the Purpose and Scope. This first step involves defining the purpose for the 
parallel structure and initial expectations about how it will function. Organizational 
diagnosis can help clarify which specific problems and issues to address, such as pro￾ductivity, absenteeism, or service quality. In addition, management training in the use 
1.355
of parallel structures can include discussions about the commitment and resources 
necessary to implement them; the openness needed to examine organizational prac￾tices, operations, and policies; and the willingness to experiment and learn.
Form a Steering Committee. Parallel structures typically use a steering committee 
composed of acknowledged leaders of the various functions and constituencies within 
the formal organization. For example, in cooperative union–management projects, 
the steering committee would include key representatives from management, such 
as a president or chief operating officer, and each of the unions and employee groups 
involved in the project, such as local union presidents. This committee performs the 
following tasks:
Refining the scope and purpose of the parallel structure
Developing a vision for the effort
Guiding the creation and implementation of the structure
Establishing the linkage mechanisms between the parallel structure and the 
formal organization
Creating problem-solving groups and activities
Ensuring the support of senior management.
OD practitioners can play an important role in forming the steering committee. 
First, they can help to establish the team and select appropriate members. Second, 
they can assist in developing and maintaining group norms of learning and 
innovation. These norms set the tone for problem solving throughout the paral￾lel structure. Third, they can help the committee create a vision statement that 
refines the structure’s purpose and promotes ownership of it. Fourth, they can help 
committee members develop and specify objectives and strategies, organizational 
expectations and required resources, and potential rewards for participation in the 
parallel structure.
3. Communicate with Organization Members. The effectiveness of a parallel structure 
depends on a high level of involvement from organization members. Communicating 
the purpose, procedures, and rewards of participation can promote that involve￾ment. Moreover, employee participation in developing a structure’s vision and 
purpose can increase ownership and visibly demonstrate the “new way” of work￾ing. Continued communication concerning parallel structure activities can ensure 
member awareness.
4. Create Forums for Employee Problem Solving. These forums are the primary means 
of accomplishing the purpose of the parallel learning structure. The most common 
forum is the employee problem-solving group. Their formation involves selecting 
and training group members, identifying problems for the groups to work on, and 
providing appropriate facilitation. Selecting group members is important because 
success often is a function of group membership.17 Members need to represent the 
appropriate hierarchical levels, expertise, functions, and constituencies that are rel￾evant to the problems at hand. This allows the parallel structure to identify and com￾municate with the formal structure. It also provides the necessary resources to solve 
the problems. Ad hoc committees may also be formed, as when workers and manag￾ers initiate action to address an issue of interest to the parallel organization. Ad hoc 
teams are typically charged with a particular task and have a limited lifetime.
Once formed, the groups need appropriate training. This may include discussions 
about the vision of the parallel structure, the specific problems to be addressed, and 
the way those problems will be solved. As in the steering committee, group norms 
promoting openness, creativity, and integration need to be established.
Another increasingly common forum is the large-group intervention described 
in Chapter 13. Search conferences and appreciative inquiry (AI) summits can 
be used to generate a variety of ideas for change, innovations, and solutions. 
Application 15.1 describes one example of such a process.18 Roadway Express

CHAPTER 15 Employee Involvementapplication 15.1
Using the AI Summit to Build Union–
Management Relations at Roadway Express
Roadway Express was the largest subsidiary of $2.9 
billion (2001 revenues) Roadway Corp., based in 
Akron, Ohio (Roadway has since been acquired by 
Yellow). In the first three quarters of 2002, Roadway 
Express’s operating income fell 14% to $130 mil￾lion and revenue dropped 7% to $1.8 billion. In 
September, 2002, Roadway’s biggest competitor, 
Consolidated Freightways, filed for bankruptcy and 
15,000 Teamsters lost their jobs. Non-unionized 
carriers like CNF were gaining market share with 
lower costs and a more flexible workforce.
Roadway Express is a “less-than-truckload car￾rier,” which means that its trucks deliver a variety 
of packages and freight to multiple locations for 
more than one customer at a time. This places 
tremendous pressure on the organization, its man￾agers, and employees to effectively plan the deliv￾ery routes and loads in order to make a profit. 
Complicating the task, Roadway Express is heavily 
organized: 20,000 of its 27,000 employees belong 
to the Teamsters or other unions. They are paid, 
on average and including benefits, 5% above non￾unionized competitors.
To compete in an industry in which net profit 
margins are less than 5% in a good year—let alone 
in a year when business is contracting—every one 
of its 27,000 employees must be a leader. “Almost 
two-thirds of every revenue dollar is consumed 
by wages and benefits,” says Roadway president 
and COO James Staley. In comparison, Conway 
Transportation, a division of non-unionized CNF, 
only pays out 53 cents of every dollar of revenue. 
“There’s not a lot of new technology that’s going 
to make us more efficient. So future opportunities 
are going to come from our people being more 
involved in the business.”
Persuading the Teamsters and other union members 
to be more efficient and breaking down a long his￾tory of hostility between workers and management 
was no small task. Many of the programs Staley 
had seen had a way of producing a short-term 
glow and not much lasting change. Union bosses 
are naturally wary of such programs and assume 
that efficiency is just a fancy way of saying that 
some workers will be laid off and the rest made to 
work harder. The cooperative union–management 
program Staley adopted paired classroom efforts to 
educate union members on how the organization 
works with a series of AI summits to generate ideas 
and organize change efforts.
Part of the program involved teaching workers 
about the industry’s economics, competition, 
and financial status, including Roadway’s income 
statement and operating ratios. The classes 
encourage employees to think and act like own￾ers and emphasize the importance of cutting costs. 
The experience of one 36-year-old dockworker, a 
13-year veteran and union representative, dem￾onstrated how difficult change was going to be. 
The dockworker had been accused of instigating 
worker slowdowns and engaging in screaming 
matches with supervisors. At one of the business 
education seminars, a graph illustrating how 
unionized trucking companies’ market share has 
slipped from 75% to 50% since 1990 made a 
powerful argument for change. “Suddenly my 
ability to support my wife and two children 
depended on the security of the company,” he 
said. In response, he wrote a plan to improve 
service in his Greenville, South Carolina, facility 
that included teaching dockworkers to use com￾puters to communicate with customer service reps 
and keep them up-to-date on the status of freight. 
However, the plan and its implementation also 
resulted in many of his coworkers labeling him as 
a management “suck up.”
The second part of the union–management program 
involves the use of AI summits. The first AI sum￾mit process began at the Akron terminal and then 
was extended to the Winston-Salem facility in 
North Carolina. A steering committee of workers 
from across the facility was put together to plan an 
off-site meeting aimed at setting a course for the 
future. Their first task was to decide who among 
the terminal’s employees would be invited to 
attend. The goal was to create a microcosm of the 
company, with workers from all departments and 
all functions and with varying degrees of empathy 
for Roadway’s corporate objectives. A few weeks 
later, about a 100 employees gathered at a local 
Holiday Inn for the three-day off-site. Using a 
collaborative process, the trucking firm had begun CHAPTER 15 Employee Involvement 357
to engage its heavily unionized workforce in ways 
that hardly seemed possible just five years ago.
At the start of the AI summit, representatives from 
all parts of the system, workers from all functions 
who barely knew one another, participated. Having 
the whole system in the room allowed everyone 
to see each other, face-to-face, and increased the 
chances of building trust and forced people to see 
their collective purpose. On the AI summit’s first 
day, participants explored their organization’s “posi￾tive change core.” The opening question in a round 
of interviews among all the participants was, “Talk 
about a time when you felt the most alive, the most 
engaged, in your job at Roadway.” The wording was 
intentional, a signal that this wasn’t going to be the 
usual management–labor gripe session. The second 
question fed off the first: “Imagine that you’ve 
woken up after being asleep for five years. What 
would you want Roadway to look like?” When 
participants paired off to discuss their responses, 
they made a powerful discovery. “It didn’t matter 
what your job was,” said one worker who had been 
a Roadway driver for 24 years, “everyone wanted 
the same things”—things such as sustained growth, 
happy customers, and job security. In short, every￾one wanted a successful company.
Over the next two days, the AI summit participants 
moved from mission to plan. On day two, partici￾pants broke into small groups and envisioned their 
organization’s potential for positive influence and 
impact: What will the company look like in 2010? 
What will be happening in the world outside it? 
What is the best outcome we can imagine? The 
groups then reported back to the large group, 
and participants began to focus on creating an 
organization that incorporated the positive change 
core into every strategy, process, and system. The 
result was a set of action-oriented statements of 
how the organization would function. On the 
final day, participants distilled their organizational 
design into a list of “inspired actions.” They drew 
an “opportunity map” of needs and priorities and 
voted on which ones were most urgent. Then they 
organized into seven action teams. One group 
addressed the trust gap between management 
and the union. Another devised strategies to turn 
drivers—the Roadway employees who have the 
most contact with the company’s customers—into 
de facto sales reps. Other teams would address 
employee communications, performance measure￾ment and monitoring, and education. One team’s 
efforts resulted in the distribution center saving 
$118,000 a year because the workers determined 
that trucks carrying more fuel than necessary were 
getting lower miles/ gallon. If successful, these 
groups would sustain themselves long after the 
summit ended.
At another session in North Carolina, workers 
were asked to recall ideal work experience, a 
time when they were treated with respect, and 
when trucks were loaded to capacity or arrived 
on time. Assembled into nine groups, they were 
then encouraged to devise money-saving ideas. A 
team of short-haul drivers came up with 12 cost￾cutting and revenue-generating ideas. Here is one 
of the most ambitious: Have each of the 32 drivers 
in Winston-Salem deliver just one more customer 
order each hour. Using management data, the driv￾ers calculated the 288 additional daily shipments, 
at an average revenue of $212 each and with a 6% 
margin, would generate just about $1 million a 
year of operating profit.
The workers understand that their efforts to trans￾form Roadway are just the beginning. As one local 
Teamsters boss put it, “Times have changed, if we 
don’t work together, and smarter, we won’t sur￾vive.” AI summits held at Roadway over the last 
three years have focused on designing structures, 
creating faster throughput, and recasting the roles 
of supervisors and leadership at every level. Each 
involves from 200 to 400 people, and Roadway 
plans five more AI Summits in the next quarter, 
convening dockworkers, truck drivers, Teamsters, 
senior leaders, customers, suppliers, and partners 
to do strategic planning at terminals throughout 
the country.
Roadway Corporation reported increased revenues 
for the fourth quarter of 2002, up 25.7% over that 
of the same period the year before. More impor￾tantly, operating ratios improved significantly and 
the union–management programs designed to cre￾ate a more efficient delivery process had delivered 
an estimated $35 million dollars in improvements 
for the quarter. Of the top terminals leading the 
bottom-line improvements, all were sites that had 
held AI Summits.358 PART 4 Technostructural Interventions
found the AI summit to be an effective way of engaging union members in solving 
organizational problems.
Another key resource for parallel structures is facilitation support. Although this 
can be expensive, it can yield important benefits in problem-solving efficiency and 
quality. Small groups are asked to form quickly and to solve problems by cutting 
through traditional hierarchical and functional boundaries. Facilitation support 
can help charter and build the team as well as pay special attention to processes 
that encourage productivity. They can help members identify and resolve problem￾solving issues within groups. Similarly, large-group interventions require time, 
resources, and knowledge. They must be designed and facilitated well if they are 
to produce relevant results.
5. Address the Problems and Issues. Parallel structures solve problems by using an 
action research process. They diagnose specific problems, plan appropriate solu￾tions, and implement and evaluate them. Problem solving can be facilitated when 
the groups and the steering committee relate effectively to each other. This permits 
the steering committee to direct problem-solving efforts in an appropriate manner, 
to acquire the necessary resources and support, and to approve action plans. It also 
helps ensure that the solutions and changes are linked appropriately to the formal 
organization. In this manner, early attempts at change will have a better chance of 
succeeding.
6. Implement and Evaluate the Changes. This step involves implementing appropri￾ate organizational changes and assessing the results. Change proposals need the 
support of the steering committee and the formal authority structure. As changes 
are implemented, the organization needs information about their effects. This lets 
members know how successful the changes have been and if they need to be modi￾fied. In addition, feedback on changes helps the organization learn to adapt and 
innovate.
Results of Parallel Structure Approaches A large body of literature exists on the imple￾mentation and impact of parallel structure approaches to EI. The business and popular 
press are full of glowing reports about the benefit of union–management cooperative 
projects, quality circles, and other parallel structure interventions. For many people, 
especially lower-level employees, this opportunity to influence the formal organization 
leads to increased work satisfaction and task effectiveness.19 Several classic case studies, 
including General Motors’ central foundry division; the Harman plant in Bolivar and 
the Rockwell International plant in Battle Creek, Michigan (a joint UAW–GM effort); 
and the Rushton Mines in Pennsylvania support these conclusions.20
Early large-sample evaluations of parallel structures typically reported mixed 
results.21 Over a period of at least three years, the University of Michigan’s Institute 
for Social Research (ISR) studied eight major projects implemented during the 1970s. 
Although the projects showed some improvements in employee attitudes, only two 
projects showed improvements in productivity. The ISR researchers explained the 
meager productivity results in terms of the projects’ mistakes. All of the projects were 
pioneering efforts and hardly could be expected to avoid mistakes during implementa￾tion.22 Similarly, Ledford, Lawler, and Mohrman concluded that the existing research 
showed no clear positive or negative trend in the productivity effects of quality circles.23
Although the evidence of attitudinal effects was more extensive than that of productiv￾ity effects, the studies reviewed still showed mixed results for attitudinal changes.
More recent data suggest stronger relationships between employee participation and 
direct performance outcomes, such as productivity, customer satisfaction, quality, and 
speed; profitability; and employee satisfaction.24 A 1994 study by the Commission on 
the Future of Worker–Management Relations supported that conclusion. It found that 
systematically implemented programs often improve productivity and almost always CHAPTER 15 Employee Involvement 359
increase investment in employee skills and knowledge.25 “The newer projects tend to be 
much better linked to the management and union hierarchies, receive better assistance 
from a widening circle of experienced consultants, have more realistic goals, and use 
more sharply focused organizational change strategies.”26
Finally, court rulings in the early 1990s challenged the legality of some EI approaches 
under provisions of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA). This law, passed by 
Congress in 1935, gives employees the right to form labor unions and decrees that 
employers must bargain in good faith with representatives of those organizations. 
In protecting employees’ rights to collective bargaining, the NLRA precludes certain 
employer unfair labor practices, one of which is aimed at employer domination of 
a labor organization. Under the law, a committee or team of workers that meets to 
address issues related to wages, hours, or conditions of work can be considered a “labor 
organization.” If management creates the team, provides it with resources, or influ￾ences it in any way, then management may be found to dominate this so-called labor 
organization. In two legal cases involving Electromation, Inc., and DuPont, the court 
ruled that in setting up employee teams or committees to address such issues as com￾munication, cost cutting, and safety, the companies had created labor organizations 
and had dominated them unfairly. Although the NLRA does not outlaw EI teams per 
se, such interventions may be legally questionable in situations where teams address 
issues traditionally reserved for bargaining and where management influences or 
controls the teams. In response to these rulings, Congress passed legislation in 1996 
to amend the NLRA. The Teamwork for Employees and Management Act of 1995 pre￾serves legitimate EI programs without infringing on the rights of employees to bargain 
collectively.
Total Quality Management
Total quality management (TQM) is a more comprehensive approach to employee 
involvement. Also known as “continuous process improvement,” “continuous quality,” 
“lean,” and “six-sigma,” TQM grew out of a manufacturing emphasis on quality control 
and represents a long-term effort to orient all of an organization’s activities around the 
concept of quality. Quality is achieved when organizational processes reliably produce 
products and services that meet or exceed customer expectations. Although it is pos￾sible to implement TQM without employee involvement, member participation in the 
change process increases the likelihood of sustaining the results. Quality improvement 
processes were popular in the 1990s, and many organizations, including Morton Salt, 
Weyerhaeuser, Xerox, Boeing’s Airlift and Tanker Programs, Motorola, and Analog 
Devices, incorporated TQM interventions. Today, a continuous quality improvement 
capability is essential for global competitiveness.
TQM increases workers’ knowledge and skills through extensive training, provides 
relevant information to employees, pushes decision-making power downward in the 
organization, and ties rewards to performance. When implemented successfully, TQM 
also is aligned closely with a firm’s overall business strategy and attempts to direct the 
entire organization toward continuous quality improvement.27
The principles underlying TQM can be understood by examining the careers of W. 
Edwards Deming and Joseph M. Juran, the fathers of the modern quality movement. 
They initially applied statistical techniques to improve product quality at defense plants 
in the United States during World War II, but in an odd twist of fate, they found their 
ideas taking hold more in Japan than in the United States.28 When the war ended, U.S. 
businesses turned to mass-production techniques and emphasized quantity over quality 
to satisfy postwar demand. Deming, known for his statistical and sampling expertise, 
was asked by General Douglas MacArthur to conduct a census of the Japanese popu￾lation. During his discussions with Japanese officials and managers, he advocated a 360 PART 4 Technostructural Interventions
disciplined approach of “plan–do–check–adjust” to identify and improve manufactur￾ing processes that affected product quality. With such an approach, the Japanese could 
produce world-class-quality products and restore their country economically. Deming’s 
ideas eventually were codified into the “Fourteen Points” and the “Seven Deadly Sins” 
of quality summarized in Table 15.1. In honor of the ideas that helped rejuvenate the 
Japanese economy, the Union of Japanese Scientists and Engineers (JUSE) created the 
Deming Award to distinguish annually the best in quality manufacturing.
At about the same time, Juran’s publication of the Quality Control Handbook in 1951 
identified two sources of quality problems: avoidable and unavoidable costs. Avoidable 
costs included hours spent reworking defective products, processing complaints, and 
scrapping otherwise useful material. Unavoidable costs included work associated with 
inspection and other preventive measures. He suggested that when organizations 
focused on unavoidable costs to maintain quality, an important opportunity was being 
missed, and he advocated that an organization focus on avoidable costs that could be 
found in any process or activity, not just in manufacturing.
The popularity of TQM in the United States can be traced to a 1980 NBC television 
documentary titled, “If Japan Can . . . Why Can’t We?” The documentary chronicled 
Deming’s work with the Japanese and his concern that U.S. companies would not listen 
to him after the war. The documentary had a powerful impact on firms facing severe 
competition, particularly from the Japanese, and many companies, including Ford 
Motor Company, General Motors, Dow Chemical, and Hughes Aircraft, quickly sought 
Deming’s advice. Another important influence on the TQM movement in the United 
States was Philip Crosby’s book Quality Is Free.
29 He showed that improved quality can 
lower overall costs, dispelling the popular belief that high quality means higher total 
costs for the organization. With fewer parts reworked, less material wasted, and less time 
spent inspecting finished goods, the organization’s total costs actually can decline.
In 1987, Congress established the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award. It rec￾ognizes large and small organizations in business, education, and health care for quality

achievement along seven dimensions: leadership; strategic planning; customer and mar￾ket focus; measurement, analysis, and knowledge management; human resources focus; 
process management; and business results. The 2006 award winners were Premier, Inc., 
in services, MESA Products in small business, and Northern Mississippi Medical Center 
in health care. Competition for the award has grown enormously. Some large organiza￾tions have spent large sums to prepare for the contest; others have applied just to receive 
the extensive feedback from the board of examiners on how to improve quality; and still 
others feel compelled to apply because customers insist that they show progress in process 
improvement.
Another quality award is the Shingo Prize (http://www.shingoprize.org/) for busi￾ness and government organizations that achieve highly efficient production methods. 
The 2007 award winners included plants from Mexico and the United States, repre￾senting Baxter Healthcare, Raytheon, and Takata Monterrey. Numerous states have 
initiated their own quality awards. At the national level, the Carey Award is given to 
federal agencies and the Hammer Awards are given as part of the National Performance 
Review for innovation and quality improvement in the federal government.
TQM is a growing industry itself, with consulting firms, university courses, train￾ing programs, and professional associations related to quality improvement diffusing 
rapidly across industrial nations. The quality approach is supported by at least four 
major associations: the American Society for Quality (ASQ; http://www.asq.org), 
the Association for Quality and Participation (AQP; http://www.aqp.org) (formerly 
the International Quality Circle Association), the American Productivity and Quality 
Center (APQC; http://www.apqc.org), and the International Society of Six-sigma 
Professionals (ISSSP; http://www.isssp.com). These associations actively support TQM 
by sponsoring quality training workshops and conferences and serving as clearing￾houses for important information on TQM programs. The International Organization 
for Standardization (ISO) also supports TQM. Its ISO 9000 standard applies to quality 
systems, and certification requires firms to document key goals and processes, to dem￾onstrate compliance, and to create processes for improvement.
Application Stages TQM typically is implemented in five major steps. With the 
exception of gaining senior management commitment, most of the steps can occur 
somewhat concomitantly.
Gain Long-Term Senior Management Commitment. This stage involves helping 
senior executives understand the importance of long-term commitment to TQM. 
Without a solid understanding of TQM and the key success factors for implemen￾tation, managers often believe that workers are solely responsible for quality. Yet 
only senior executives have the authority and larger perspective to address the 
organizationwide, cross-functional issues that hold the greatest promise for TQM’s 
success.
Senior managers’ role in TQM implementation includes giving direction and sup￾port throughout the change process. For example, establishing organ izationwide 
TQM generally takes three or more years, although technical improvements to the 
workflow can be as quick as six to eight months. Senior managers need to clarify 
and communicate throughout the organization a totally new orientation to pro￾ducing and delivering products and services.
The longer-term and more difficult parts of implementation, however, involve 
changes in the organization’s support systems, such as customer service, finance, 
sales, and human resources. Often these systems are frozen in place by old policies 
and norms that can interfere with the new approach. Senior managers have to 
confront those practices and create new ones that support TQM and the organiza￾tion’s strategic orientation.
1.362 PART 4 Technostructural Interventions
Top executives also must be willing to allocate significant resources to TQM 
implementation, particularly to make large investments in training. For example, 
as part of its Baldrige Award preparation, Motorola developed Motorola University, 
a training organization that teaches in 27 languages. Departments at Motorola 
allocate at least 1.5% of their budgets to education, and every employee must take 
a minimum of 40 hours of training a year. This effort supports Motorola’s goal of 
“six-sigma” quality (a statistical measure of product quality that implies 99.9997% 
perfection) and of having a workforce that is able to read, write, solve problems, 
and do math at the seventh-grade level or above. When several business units 
within Motorola achieved the six-sigma target, the company demonstrated its com￾mitment to continuously improving quality with a new target of tenfold improve￾ment in key goals.
2. Train Members in Quality Methods. TQM implementation requires extensive 
training in the principles and tools of quality improvement. Depending on the 
organization’s size and complexity, such training can be conducted in a few weeks 
to more than two years. Members typically learn problem-solving skills and simple 
statistical process control (SPC) techniques, usually referred to as the seven tools 
of quality. At Cedar-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, all employees take a three￾day course on the applicability of brainstorming, histograms, flowcharts, scatter 
diagrams, Pareto charts, cause-and-effect diagrams, control charts, and other 
problem- solving procedures. This training is the beginning of a long-term process 
in continuous improvement. The knowledge gained is used to understand varia￾tions in organizational processes, to identify sources of avoidable costs, to select 
and prioritize quality improvement projects, and to monitor the effects of changes 
on product and service quality. By learning to analyze the sources of variation 
systematically, members can improve the reliability of product manufacturing or 
service delivery. For example, HCA’s West Paces Ferry Hospital used TQM methods 
to reduce direct costs attributable to antibiotic waste.30 It used flowcharts, fishbone 
diagrams, and Pareto charts to determine the major causes of unused intravenous 
preparations. Changes in the antibiotic delivery process resulted in reduced costs 
of antibiotics to the hospital of 44.5% and to patients of 45%.
The recent interest in six-sigma programs has produced an additional training 
issue. Many of the quality improvement projects (described below) require con￾siderable facilitation and support. To enable those projects, many organizations 
have committed to the development of “green belt” and “black belt” roles. These 
are internal consultants with specialized knowledge, skill, and experience in TQM 
methods that guide project team members through a specific program of process 
improvement.
3. Start Quality Improvement Projects. In this phase of TQM implementation, 
individuals and work groups apply the quality methods to identify the few 
projects that hold promise for the largest improvements in organizational pro￾cesses. They identify output variations, intervene to minimize deviations from 
quality standards, monitor improvements, and repeat this quality improvement 
cycle indefinitely. Identifying output variations is a key aspect of TQM. Such 
deviations from quality standards typically are measured by the percentage of 
defective products or, in the case of customer satisfaction, by on-time delivery 
percentages or customer survey ratings. For example, VF Corporation, a leading 
retail apparel firm, found that retailers were out of stock on 30% of their items 
100% of the time. In response, VF revamped its systems to fill orders within 
24 hours 95% of the time.
TQM is concerned not only with variations in the quality of finished products 
and services but also with variations in the steps of a process that produce a product 
or service and the levels of internal customer satisfaction. For example, Eastman CHAPTER 15 Employee Involvement 363
Chemical Company established a patent process improvement team to enhance 
the relationship between scientists and lawyers in applying for patent approvals. 
The team, made up of inventors, lab managers, and attorneys, doubled the num￾ber of patent attorneys and relocated their offices near the labs. Attorneys now 
meet with scientists during the experimental phase of research to discuss ways to 
increase the chances of yielding a patentable product or process. Patent submis￾sions have increased by 60%, and the number of patents issued to the company 
has doubled.31
Based on the measurement of output variations, each individual or work group 
systematically analyzes the cause of variations using SPC techniques. For example, 
product yields in a semiconductor manufacturing plant can go down for many rea￾sons, including a high concentration of dust particles, small vibrations in the equip￾ment, poor machine adjustments, and human error. Quality improvement projects 
often must determine which of the possible causes is most responsible, and, using that 
information, run experiments and pilot programs to determine which adjustments 
will cause output variations to drop and quality to improve. Those adjustments that 
do reduce variations are implemented across the board. Members continue to moni￾tor the quality process to verify improvement and then begin the problem-solving 
process again for continuous improvement.
4. Measure Progress. This stage of TQM implementation involves measuring orga￾nizational processes against quality standards. Knowing and analyzing the com￾petition’s performance are essential for any TQM effort because it sets minimum 
standards of quality, cost, and service and ensures the organization’s position in 
the industry over the short run. For the longer term, such analytical efforts con￾centrate on identifying world-class performance, regardless of industry, and creat￾ing stretch targets, also known as benchmarks. Benchmarks represent the best in 
organizational achievements and practices for different processes and generally are 
accepted as “world class.” For example, Nordstrom is considered the benchmark of 
customer service in the retail industry, while Disney’s customer-service orientation 
is considered a world-class benchmark.
The implied goal in most TQM efforts is to meet or exceed a competitor’s 
benchmark. Alcoa’s former chairman Paul H. O’Neill charged all of the company’s 
business units with closing the gap between Alcoa and its competitor’s benchmarks 
by 80% within two years.32 In aluminum sheet for beverage cans, for example, 
Japan’s Kobe Steel, Ltd., was the benchmark, and Wall Street estimated that 
achieving O’Neill’s goal would increase Alcoa’s earnings by one dollar per share. 
The greatest leverage for change often is found in companies from unrelated 
industries, however. For example, Alcoa might look to Nordstrom or Disney to get 
innovative ideas about customer service. Understanding benchmarks from other 
industries challenges an organization’s thinking about what is possible and pro￾motes what is referred to as “out-of-the-box thinking.”
5. Rewarding Accomplishment. In this final stage of TQM implementation, the 
organization links rewards to improvements in quality. TQM does not monitor 
and reward outcomes that are normally tracked by traditional reward systems, 
such as the number of units produced. Such measures do not necessarily reflect 
product quality and can be difficult to replace because they are ingrained in the 
organization’s traditional way of doing business. Rather, TQM rewards members 
for “process-oriented” improvements, such as increased on-time delivery, gains 
in customers’ perceived satisfaction with product performance, and reductions 
in cycle time—the time it takes a product or service to be conceived, developed, 
produced, and sold. Rewards usually are designed initially to promote finding solu￾tions to the organization’s key problems. The linkage between rewards and process￾oriented improvements reinforces the belief that continuous improvements, even 364 PART 4 Technostructural Interventions
small ones, are an important part of the new organizational culture associated 
with TQM. According to a survey of 500 firms in four countries, conducted by 
Ernst and Young and the American Quality Foundation, more than half of the 
U.S. companies studied linked executive pay to improving quality and achieving 
benchmarks.33
TQM has continued to evolve in most industrialized countries. Six-sigma programs, 
although based on the principles of TQM, attempt to drive out important sources of 
variation and achieve near perfection in the execution of critical processes in such 
large organizations as GE, Motorola, May Co., and Sun Microsystems. Application 15.2 
describes one such six-sigma effort at GE Financial Services.34
Results of Total Quality Management TQM’s emergence in the United States and the 
variations in how it is applied across organizations have made rigorous evaluation of 
results difficult. A 1999 survey of the Fortune 1000 companies showed that about 75% 
have implemented some form of TQM.35 Furthermore, 87% of the companies rated 
their TQM experience as either positive or very positive, up from 76% in 1993. The 
research also found that TQM is often associated with the implementation of other EI 
interventions. As organizations enact process improvements, they may need to make 
supporting changes in reward systems and work design.36 Finally, the study revealed 
that TQM was positively associated with performance outcomes, such as productivity, 
customer service, product/service quality, and profitability, as well as with human out￾comes, such as employee satisfaction and quality of work life.
In addition, much of the evidence is anecdotal. For example, although Boeing’s 
Airlift and Tanker program won the Baldrige Award in 1998, Boeing’s experience with 
TQM has suggested that the biggest organizational gains have come through the inte￾gration of TQM concepts with other business and strategic initiatives. TQM has helped 
Boeing be a better all-around company.
The U.S. Commerce Department’s National Institute of Standards and Technology 
routinely tracks the stock performance of Baldrige Award winners compared to the 
Standard & Poor’s 500 index. On the one hand, the Baldrige winners outperformed 
the S&P 500 significantly between 1994 and 1999.37 More recently, however, of the 
16 award recipients between 1994 and 2003, only one has outperformed the S&P 500. 
Another study of hospitals provided empirical support for the Baldrige framework.38
Significant relationships were identified between hospitals’ adherence to the Baldrige 
Criteria and their performance in the areas of patient and customer satisfaction, 
staff and work systems, and organization-specific results. However, the relationships 
between hospital quality systems and financial/market performance or health care 
outcomes were not significant. The authors recommend more longitudinal research 
because of the likely time lags between implementation and manifestation of financial￾or health-related outcomes.
Other studies also suggest positive TQM results. In a Conference Board study of 
149 large organizations, more than 30% reported improved financial performance. 
Similarly, a study of the 20 highest-point-scorers in the Baldrige competition reported 
improved employee relations, product quality, and customer satisfaction and lowered 
costs compared with other Baldrige applicants.39 These results should be interpreted 
cautiously, however, because most of the studies lack sufficient scientific rigor.
A more balanced picture of TQM effects is provided by a study of 54 firms of different 
sizes, both adopters and nonadopters of TQM. It found that TQM firms significantly out￾performed non-TQM firms. The source of the performance advantage was not the tools 
and techniques of TQM, however, but the culture, empowerment, and commitment that 
came from successful implementation. The study concluded that “these tacit resources, 
and not TQM tools and techniques, drive TQM success,” and that “ organizations that application 15.2
Six-Sigma Success Story at GE Financial
GE Financial, the consumer insurance and invest￾ment arm of the General Electric Company, helps 
individuals create and preserve wealth, protect 
assets, and enhance their lifestyles through prod￾ucts like insurance, annuities, mutual funds, 
and other personal finance methods. Today’s 
competitive environment requires that compa￾nies delight their customers and relentlessly look 
for new ways to exceed expectations. How does 
GE do this? Through six sigma. It is not a secret 
society, a slogan, or a cliché. Six sigma refers 
to a highly disciplined methodology that helps 
GE businesses focus on developing and deliver￾ing ever-improving products and services. Why 
“six sigma”? This methodology borrows the term 
“sigma” from statistics. In six sigma, the term 
describes the capability of a process to meet the 
key customer’s requirements. The higher the 
sigma, the better the process. When a process fails 
to meet the customer’s requirement, it is counted 
as a defect. The central idea behind six sigma is 
that if you can measure how many “defects” you 
have in a process, you can systematically figure 
out how to eliminate them. To illustrate how GE 
Financial uses six sigma, we begin with a short 
description of the background of GE Financial, 
and a description of how six sigma was applied to 
a typical project called “Optimization.”
GE Financial is a business that grew quickly 
by acquiring two to three different companies 
annually between 1996 and 2001. Managing this 
growth required an enormous amount of consoli￾dation and integration of people, technologies, and 
processes. Six sigma helped drive both speed and 
success in these areas. Recently, GE Financial rec￾ognized an opportunity to improve a critical proc￾ess called optimization. Optimization refers to the 
process that routinely occurs as an insurance com￾pany manages its investments. When a customer 
purchases an insurance policy, their premiums are 
invested by the insurance company in instruments, 
such as bonds, of varying yields and maturities. 
The insurance company’s goals are to pick the 
best combination of investments that will ensure 
that the premium will grow sufficiently to repay a 
customer’s future claim and to provide a profit to 
the insurer. To ensure the ability to meet the invest￾ment goals, the investment managers fine-tune the 
portfolio. The goal of this fine-tuning, or optimiza￾tion, is to maximize desirable characteristics, such 
as yield, while minimizing undesirable characteris￾tics, such as credit default and interest rate risk. The 
project at GE Financial was focused on improving 
the process of how optimization of the investment 
portfolio occurred.
A key internal customer on the GE Financial team 
knew that the current optimization process could 
be more effective if it reflected the most current 
market conditions. The team measured how long 
it took to complete a typical cycle of optimization. 
The cycle time of the process, a measure of the 
time from the start of a process until the output 
was delivered to the internal customer, took, on 
average, 84 working days. The team realized that 
to meet the customer’s requirement for an opti￾mization that reflects current market condition 
meant they needed to reduce the cycle time from 
84 days to, at most, five days. To drive the cycle 
down to an acceptable level, a six-sigma quality 
“Black Belt” (a GE Financial associate with a high 
level of expertise) was assigned. The Black Belt’s 
role is similar to that of a consultant, facilitating the 
team through changes and providing expertise in 
six-sigma methodology. A brief description of the 
steps involved in driving the process improvement 
follows.
In the first phase, the Black Belt and process 
improvement team gathered information to under￾stand the current process and the requirements 
of key stakeholders and customers. Interviews 
with the Chief Investment Officer and invest￾ment analysts resulted in greater understanding 
of the requirements for a successful project. These 
requirements included the previously mentioned 
reduction in cycle time from 84 days to five days; 
improving scalability by creating the ability to 
optimize multiple portfolios; and lastly, improv￾ing functionality by adding the ability to analyze 
several different types of risk.
As part of the first phase, the team also determined 
the project boundaries and how to allocate proper 
resources for an on-time project completion. 
Together, the customers and the improvement team 
reached a consensus on how to proceed. The port￾folio optimization project team divided the project 
into three generations of related projects. For 366 PART 4 Technostructural Interventions
example, the first-generation project would focus 
on reducing cycle time by 30% for the optimization 
of the investment portfolio. The latter-generation 
projects would then focus on improving scalability 
and capability, and they would require long-term 
technological investments in research and devel￾opment. By developing a consensus definition of 
expectations for the project, the team defined a 
long-term course for improvement, based on the 
customer’s requirements. The project team set off 
and determined how best to precisely measure the 
existing process and collect data.
Once measures were collected, the Black Belt 
helped the team analyze the data to identify the 
possible causes behind the existing cycle time for 
the process. While many causes were investigated, 
the ones that were determined to be statistically 
significant and had the greatest impact on cycle 
time were further analyzed. The in-depth analy￾sis of the process highlighted a number of areas, 
including inefficient hand-offs, time lags, and 
repetitive steps. Through discussions with the 
process experts, the team identified potential root 
causes impacting cycle time and ultimately nar￾rowed down to a “vital few” drivers of variation in 
the cycle time for the portfolio optimization.
Upon understanding the drivers of the existing cycle 
time, the improvement team, the stakeholders, and 
the process owners discussed potential improvement 
opportunities. Ultimately, the team devised specific 
improvements for each key driver. Some simply 
required a change in process and procedure, while 
others required moderate changes to systems and 
structures. For example, during the analysis, the 
team determined that different data formats drove 
cycle-time variation. A dollar amount may have 
been quoted as $100,000,000 or 100,000,000 or 
$100,000,000.00, depending on the source. This 
inconsistency forced the receiver to rework the 
formatting of multitudes of data prior to inputting 
the data into the optimization tool. This formatting 
inconsistency caused significant time delays and 
introduced a possibility for error. The solution was 
to clearly specify and communicate to data suppli￾ers both the particular data requirement and the 
format for the data as well. To facilitate the appro￾priate formatting, data templates were created 
and distributed to the data suppliers. This was a 
relatively simple solution, but nonetheless it trans￾lated to significant impact on the cycle time for the 
process. For those changes that required a proc￾ess and procedure change, the adjustments were 
documented and communicated. The changes to 
systems and structures required that well-defined 
project plans be submitted to a team from the 
Information Technology department for program￾ming actual changes to the systems. Throughout 
this project phase, the improvement team kept 
the stakeholders and process owners aware of the 
improvement plans, timelines, and any issues that 
prevented goal achievement.
When various improvements were being designed 
and eventually completed, the team communicated 
the changes in process, procedure, and technology 
to the associates involved in this optimization proc￾ess. A small-scale pilot program was developed to 
take associates through the new process, ensuring 
clear understanding of the new process and meth￾ods. The close relationship and constant commu￾nication between the team and those who worked 
the process was a key to the success of the project.
At the conclusion of the first project, the goal was 
not only achieved, but also exceeded. The 30% 
cycle-time reduction goal, from 84 days to 59 days, 
was actually exceeded, with cycle time reduced to 
42 days. This result equated to a 50% reduction in 
cycle time. Besides that improvement, the project 
team had a better sense of the process and their 
customer’s requirements. This clarity will lead to 
a speedier implementation of the next generations 
of the project where the team will seek to achieve 
the overall goal of a 95% reduction equating to the 
five-day cycle-time goal.
This case serves to illustrate three key concepts in 
the six-sigma problem-solving methodology. First, 
consistent interaction between the project team 
and the stakeholders and process owners allowed 
for realistic project expectations and set the stage 
for project success. Second, having appropriate 
project scoping and project phasing allowed for the 
setting of realistic goals and timelines. And third, 
the robust use of qualitative and quantitative data 
to properly identify root causes will ensure that the 
“right” solutions are undertaken.CHAPTER 15 Employee Involvement 367
acquire them can outperform competitors with or without the accompanying TQM ide￾ology.”40 Similarly, a study of Swedish quality award winners was compared with their 
primary competitors. The award winners consistently outperformed their competitors 
on measures of sales and profitability.41
High-Involvement Organizations
Over the past two decades, an increasing number of employee involvement projects have 
been aimed at using high-invovlement work practices to create high-involvement organ￾izations (HIOs). These interventions create organ izational conditions that support high 
levels of employee participation. What makes HIOs unique is the comprehensive 
nature of their design process. Unlike parallel structures that do not alter the formal 
organization or TQM interventions that tend to focus on particular processes, HIOs 
address almost all organization features. Structure, work design, information and 
control systems, physical layout, personnel policies, and reward systems are designed 
jointly by management and workers to promote high levels of involvement and 
performance.
Features of High-Involvement Organizations High-involvement organizations are 
designed with features congruent with one another. For example, in HIOs employees 
have considerable influence over decisions. To support such a decentralized philosophy, 
members receive extensive training in problem-solving techniques, plant operation, 
and organizational policies. In addition, both operational and issue-oriented informa￾tion is shared widely and is obtained easily by employees. Finally, rewards are tied 
closely to unit performance, as well as to knowledge and skill levels. These disparate 
aspects of the organization are mutually reinforcing and form a coherent pattern that 
contributes to employee involvement. Table 15.2 presents a list of compatible design 
elements characterizing HIOs,42 and most such organizations include several if not all 
of the following features:
Flat, lean organization structures contribute to involvement by pushing the 
scheduling, planning, and controlling functions typically performed by manage￾ment and staff groups toward the shop floor. Similarly, minienterprise, team-based 
structures that are oriented to a common purpose or outcome help focus employee 
participation on a shared objective. Participative structures, such as work councils 
and union–management committees, create conditions in which workers can influ￾ence the direction and policies of the organization.
Job designs that provide employees with high levels of discretion, task variety, and 
meaningful feedback can enhance involvement. They enable workers to influence 
day-to-day workplace decisions and to receive intrinsic satisfaction by performing 
work under enriched conditions. Self-managed teams encourage employee respon￾sibility by providing cross-training and job rotation, which give people a chance to 
learn about the different functions contributing to organizational performance.
Open information systems that are tied to jobs or work teams provide the neces￾sary information for employees to participate meaningfully in decision making. Goals 
and standards of performance that are set participatively can provide employees with a 
sense of commitment and motivation for achieving those objectives.
Career systems that provide different tracks for advancement and counseling to 
help people choose appropriate paths can help employees plan and prepare for 
long-term development in the organization. Open job posting, for example, makes 
employees aware of jobs that can further their development.
Selection of employees for HIOs can be improved through a realistic job preview 
providing information about what it will be like to work in such situations. Team

member involvement in a selection process oriented to potential and process skills 
of recruits can facilitate a participative climate.
Training employees for the necessary knowledge and skills to participate effectively 
in decision making is a heavy commitment in HIOs. This effort includes education 
on the economic side of the enterprise, as well as interpersonal skill development. 
Peer training is emphasized as a valuable adjunct to formal, expert training.
Reward systems can contribute to EI when information about them is open and 
the rewards are based on acquiring new skills, as well as on sharing gains from 
improved performance. Similarly, participation is enhanced when people can 
choose among different fringe benefits and when reward distinctions among people 
from different hierarchical levels are minimized.
Personnel policies that are participatively set and encourage stability of employ￾ment provide employees with a strong sense of commitment to the organization. 
People feel that the policies are reasonable and that the firm is committed to their 
long-term development.

Physical layouts of organizations also can enhance EI. Physical designs that sup￾port team structures and reduce status differences among employees can reinforce 
the egalitarian climate needed for employee participation. Safe and pleasant work￾ing conditions provide a physical environment conducive to participation.
These HIO design features are mutually reinforcing. “They all send a message to people 
in the organization that says they are important, respected, valued, capable of growing, 
and trusted and that their understanding of and involvement in the total organization 
is desirable and expected.”43 Moreover, these design components tend to motivate and 
focus organizational behavior in a strategic direction, and thus can lead to superior 
effectiveness and competitive advantage, particularly in contrast to more traditionally 
designed organizations.44
Application Factors At present, there is no universally accepted approach to imple￾menting the high-involvement features described here. The actual implementation 
process often is specific to the situation, and little systematic research has been devoted 
to understanding the change process itself.45 Nevertheless, at least two distinct factors 
seem to characterize how HIOs are implemented. First, implementation generally is 
guided by an explicit statement of values that members want the new organization to 
support. Typically, such values as teamwork, equity, quality, and empowerment guide 
the choice of specific design features. Values that are strongly held and widely shared 
by organization members can provide the energy, commitment, and direction needed 
to create HIOs. A second feature of the implementation process is its participative 
nature. Managers and employees take active roles in choosing and implementing the 
design features. They may be helped by OD practitioners, but the locus of control for 
the change process resides clearly within the organization. This participative change 
process is congruent with the high-involvement design being created. In essence, high￾involvement design processes promote high-involvement organizations.
Results of High-Involvement Organizations A number of studies provide support for 
the high-involvement model. For example, a survey of 98 HIOs showed that about 
75% of them perceived their performance relative to competitors as better than aver￾age on quality of work life, customer service, productivity, quality, and grievance 
rates.46 Voluntary turnover was 2%, substantially below the national average; return 
on investment was almost four times greater than industry averages; and return on 
sales was more than five times greater. Another study of the financial performance 
of U.S. companies from 1972 to 1992 revealed that the five top-performing firms—
Plenum Publishing, Circuit City, Tyson Foods, Wal-Mart, and Southwest Airlines—all 
relied heavily on EI practices for competitive advantage rather than on those factors 
typically associated with financial success, such as market leadership, profitable indus￾tries, unique technology, and strong barriers to entry.47
More recently, two studies have provided solid support for high-invovlement work 
practices. First, a study of more than 160 firms in New Zealand supported a positive 
relationship between high-involvement practices and productivity meas ured in terms 
of sales per employee.48 Second, a study of 132 large manufacturing firms found a 
strong positive relationship between high-involvement work practices and labor pro￾ductivity. The srength of the relationship varied, however, depending on the industry’s 
capital intensity, R&D intensity, and growth. For example, improving high-involve￾ment practices by one standard deviation in a high-capital-intensive industry increased 
sales per employee by 1%, a nontrivial amount.
Application 15.3 describes the implementation of a high-involvement process at Air 
Chemicals and Products.49 The case provides a good example of the broad approach 
to EI. Over time, power, information, knowledge and skill, and rewards were all 
addressed in an effective organization development process.

Building a High-Involvement Organization 
at Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.
Chris Loyd, the vice president and general 
manager of the Process Systems Group Operations 
(OPS) division of Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. 
(APCI), a Fortune 200 company, believed there was 
too much variability in key performance metrics, 
such as quality, safety, and productivity, across the 
plants in his division. Despite communication and 
implementation of several quality-related initia￾tives, a subset of plants consistently outperformed 
all others. In response, Chris commissioned a 
diagnostic process to uncover the sources of 
exemplary performance in those high-performing 
facilities.
The OPS division was responsible for ensuring 
the manufacture and delivery of high-volume 
industrial gas products directly into customer facil￾ities. The division provided oxygen, nitrogen, 
hydrogen, helium, argon, and specialty gas prod￾ucts in various states (e.g., liquid, gaseous) and 
purities to large industrial customers representing 
a variety of markets, including electronics, refining, 
pharmaceutical, steel-making, food, aerospace and 
many others.
The diagnosis identified four factors resulting in 
exceptional performance, including employee 
involvement, information access, technical capabil￾ity, and incentives. These four factors consistently 
differentiated between the high performing and 
comparison plants. In particular, the single great￾est source of variance was the level of employee 
involvement—or the extent to which organiza￾tion members at all levels participated in decision 
making—in a facility. With this learning, and 
working with Jim Byron, an internal OD consult￾ant, a high-involvement strategy was established 
to broadcast and advance involvement across the 
entire division. Loyd was convinced that elevating 
his 900-person division’s business effectiveness 
requires pervasive employee involvement in plant 
management and operations.
High Involvement Strategy
The high-involvement (HI) strategy was developed 
to influence each of the four drivers of exceptional 
performance. To address EI, the organization adopted 
the “working with others” (WWO) training process 
(described below) to model and educate organization 
members on how to solve problems in a group set￾ting. In addition, and in an effort to symbolize shared 
decision making across the division, Loyd created an 
HI Advisory Team. The group’s mandate was to carry 
forward the work of promoting employee involve￾ment. Members of the advisory team represented all 
workforce levels, from hourly employees through 
top management. The WWO training also addressed 
the technical capability factor by improving and rein￾forcing the workforce’s skills and knowledge related 
to quality-improvement processes.
The information-access factor was addressed by 
increasing the organization’s capability to share 
information. The existing intranet was enhanced 
to provide all workers with access to business 
and division information (within any constraints 
imposed by legal or financial regulations).
Finally, the incentive factor was addressed by 
adjusting the reward system of the division. A 
gain- sharing system was designed and imple￾mented to encourage team performance at the 
local level and included incentives for plants that 
were serving similar customers and geographies 
to share information and best practices with one 
another.
The Role of Training in High Involvement
A central component of the HI strategy imple￾mentation effort was the WWO training sessions. 
Each session addressed the knowledge and skills 
needed to elevate involvement in the organization 
and used them immediately to engage employees 
in making improvements to the business. That is, 
the WWO sessions not only provided information 
about employee involvement and the skills and 
knowledge required to be effective at it, the sessions 
immediately applied those competencies by engag￾ing participants in an assessment of the current 
state of involvement in the workplace, and in iden￾tifying and resolving a quality-improvement chal￾lenge in the participants’ plant. Action teams were 
spawned from these sessions to follow through on 
making changes that were not achievable within 
the WWO session itself.
Beginning with Loyd’s team, Byron led the WWO 
training sessions during the first two years of the 371
initiative and reached every member of the organi￾zation. Leadership demonstrated its commitment to 
the goal by participating in WWO sessions. As part 
of that work, a video was produced that displayed 
the leadership’s use of the WWO skills and explored 
their own personal insights into the benefits involve￾ment offered employees and the business.
As the WWO sessions progressed, participants 
who had interest in becoming WWO trainers and 
coaches, who would train their plants in using 
teamed approaches to solving local problems and 
to uncovering and realizing business opportunities, 
were identified. Within two years, every member 
of OPS received training in these core skills and 
processes and participated in making quality 
improvements to their business. More than 
100 trainer-coaches were developed to support 
teaming within local organizations.
These trainer-coaches had responsibility for 
implementing the second phase of the HI effort, 
which was to conduct a regular assessment of 
each plant’s authority and power-sharing lev￾els against goals, roles, relationships, and pro￾cedure dimensions. The assessments identified 
areas for improvement, and the trainer-coaches 
were expected to initiate changeover plans with 
the assistance of a team development tool kit and 
additional training that was specifically designed 
to lead them and their teams through an improve￾ment process. The trainer-coaches documented 
best practices on a regular basis and broadcast these 
lessons electronically to all employees through the 
enhanced intranet and to the HI Advisory Team, as 
well as distributing hard copy to local plants. They 
also met regionally to promote best practices and 
determine additional ways to increase the level 
of involvement and power sharing as a means of 
delegating more management of plant operations 
lower down the organization.
As the WWO and problem-solving processes 
unfolded, Loyd began communicating the results 
to the organization. For example, he included 
feedback on progress and accomplishment is his 
weekly telephone conferences with his North 
American subordinates and in all his presentations 
to employees (i.e., face-to-face, in-house TV). 
Two other mechanisms were used to recycle the 
measured results: (1) a yearly planning func￾tion in which managers reviewed the status of 
employee involvement within their units and 
developed personal targets and plans for achieving 
them and (2) a similar planning session focusing 
on the organization as a whole completed by the 
HI Advisory Team. To stress the importance of 
HI progress, the results of measurement helped 
determine the performance appraisal each leader 
received. Each manager’s appraisal plan required 
yearly progress in increasing employee involve￾ment within his or her plant. This strengthened 
the significance of the yearly management plan￾ning session, which included the half-day ses￾sion in which managers worked together to ana￾lyze the results from their plant’s HI assessment, 
uncover the causes of the results, target next year’s 
improvement level, and generate actions they 
personally would take to realize their individual 
improvement targets.
Sustaining High Involvement
Subsequent to the rollout phase, the HI Advisory 
Team used the results of the HI assessments to 
uncover new activities that would further organi￾zational adoption of HI. One such activity was 
sponsorship of an HI Idea Book that brought 
together the best innovations employee involve￾ment produced in each area of business function. 
The book was distributed in print and electronically. 
It was updated and used to transfer expertise and 
increase the business benefits each improvement 
generated.
WWO sessions continued for training new hires. 
Apart from training new hires, the sessions were 
used to refresh skills, while involving participants 
in solving workplace problems, generating quality 
improvements, and uncovering and executing ways 
to accomplish yearly business drivers (e.g., safety 
improvements, cost reduction, improved customer 
satisfaction, reduced service interruptions). This 
sustained use of WWO sessions strengthened the 
commitment to good communications and simul￾taneously accomplished ever-broader use of 
employee involvement.
One highly significant special use of the sessions 
was to facilitate the integration of an entire new 
organization into OPS. This integration occurred 
fours years into the HI initiative. It required 
incorporating into OPS an organization that was 
larger (1,100 employees), performed very different 
work, and had a culture that was fully top-down in 
character.
Evaluation
Over the course of its implementation, several 
evaluations were made of this HI initiative. In 
CHAPTER 15 Employee Involvement372 PART 4 Technostructural Interventions
particular, the organization tracked the movement 
of HI scores across plants in the division and 
performed a study of the return on the investment 
in the HI effort. Progress was calibrated by yearly 
measurement of involvement using an EI scale 
shown in the table below. Measurement was made 
in each plant within OPS.
HI progress was assessed by plotting the 
year-to-year changes in the prevalence of 
employee involvement throughout the work￾place. A chart depicted the percentage of plants 
and other operating groups that achieved HI 
scores of Level 3 or higher. For example, during 
the last four years, the percentage of units with 
aggregate HI scores of 3 or higher increased from 
15% to over 85%. In addition, an evaluation of 
the benefits and costs of the program resulted in a 
return on investment of 9.7:1. Most of the benefits 
flowed from improved worker productivity and 
other workplace improvements that were gener￾ated by the WWO sessions.
When Chris Loyd retired, he commented, “When I 
think about the most significant changes over the 
last 20 years, I think HI was the most important 
change we made. The technology changes were 
not as critical and the organizational restructurings 
often had little effect, but the HI changes will stay 
with us forever. In fact the HI training and its 
acceptance has been a foundation that has allowed 
us to make all other changes.”
Levels of High Involvement
LEVEL OF HI 
ADOPTION DESCRIPTION
I Managers use a top-down approach and emphasize direction of the workforce. 
They are either unaware of the HI strategy or doubt its value. The employee’s 
involvement is limited to doing assigned work, and workers see themselves as 
“hired hands.” Employees have limited access to information.
II Managers use a top-down approach, but employees are asked to provide 
input concerning business issues that are outside their immediate assignments. 
Managers are aware of HI and are willing to experiment with its use in 
accomplishing business objectives. Employees see themselves as having some say 
over the content of their work and workplace. They have some access to some 
organizational information as well as data that are relevant to their work.
III Managers use a participative approach that engages employees in thinking 
through options, recommending actions, and assessing accomplishment. 
Management still makes the final decisions but is convinced of the importance of 
involving employees in addressing business issues. Employees see themselves as 
advising on the business through their participation in problem-solving teams and 
special task forces. The employee’s knowledge about the workplace is expanded 
to provide an informed basis for team problem solving.
IV Management delegates decision-making authority to work teams that are 
empowered to manage their assigned goals and are involved in every aspect 
of business management and operations. Management is convinced of the 
importance of HI for accomplishing business objectives and has begun to redefine 
its role as to enable personnel rather than to direct them. Employees feel they 
have a direct stake in the organization’s success. Each employee has access to all 
information about the workplace so that they can participate fully in defining and 
accomplishing its objectives.CHAPTER 15 Employee Involvement 373
V Management defines itself as partners with employees on one team 
dedicated to defining and achieving business goals. Managers position 
themselves to enable the free and collaborative enterprise of the team. 
Employees experience ownership for the business and a personal 
commitment to ensuring its success. Work unit personnel operate as a 
self-led team, configuring themselves as needed to define and achieve 
corporate purposes and to coordinate with other work teams. Each employee 
has access to all information about the workplace except that information 
restricted by law.

SUMMARY
This chapter described employee involvement interventions. These technostructural 
change programs are aimed at moving organization decision making downward to improve 
responsiveness and performance and to increase member flexibility, commitment, and 
satisfaction. Different approaches to EI can be described by the extent to which power, 
information, knowledge and skills, and rewards are shared with employees.
The relationship between EI and productivity can be oversimplified. Productivity 
can be increased through improved employee communication, motivation, and skills 
and abilities. It also can be affected through increased worker satisfaction, which in 
turn results in productive employees joining and remaining with the organization.
Major EI interventions are parallel structures, including cooperative union–
management projects and quality circles, TQM, and high-involvement designs. The 
results of these approaches tend to be positive, and the quality of research supporting 
these interventions is increasing.

php, 2003).Work Design
This chapter is concerned with work design—
creating jobs and work groups that generate 
high levels of employee fulfillment and pro￾ductivity. This technostructural intervention 
can be part of a larger employee involve￾ment application, or it can be an indepen￾dent change program. Work design has been 
researched and applied extensively in organi￾zations. Recently, organizations have tended 
to combine work design with formal struc￾ture and supporting changes in goal setting, 
reward systems, work environment, and other 
performance management practices. These 
organizational factors can help structure and 
reinforce the kinds of work behaviors associ￾ated with specific work designs. (How perfor￾mance management interventions can support 
work design is discussed in Chapter 17.)
This chapter examines three approaches to 
work design. First, the engineering approach 
focuses on efficiency and simplification, and 
results in traditional job and work-group designs. 
Traditional jobs involve relatively routine and 
repetitive forms of work, where little interaction 
among people is needed to produce a service 
or product. Call center operators, data-entry 
positions, and product support representatives 
are examples of this job design. Traditional 
work groups are composed of members per￾forming routine yet interrelated tasks. Member 
interactions are typically controlled by rigid 
work flows, supervisors, and schedules, such as 
might be found on assembly lines.
A second approach to work design rests on 
motivational theories and attempts to enrich 
the work experience. Job enrichment involves 
designing jobs with high levels of meaning, 
discretion, and knowledge of results. A well￾researched model focusing on job attributes 
has helped clear up methodological problems 
with this important intervention.
The third and most recent approach to work 
design derives from sociotechnical systems 
methods, and seeks to optimize both the social 
and the technical aspects of work systems. 
This method has led to a popular form of work 
design called “self-managed teams,” which are 
composed of multi-skilled members perform￾ing interrelated tasks. Members are given the 
knowledge, information, and power necessary 
to control their own task behaviors with relatively 
little external control. New support systems and 
supervisory styles are needed to manage them.
The chapter describes each of these 
perspectives on work design, and then pres￾ents a contingency framework for integrating 
the approaches based on personal and tech￾nical factors in the workplace. When work is 
designed to fit these factors, it is both satisfying 
and productive.
THE ENGINEERING APPROACH
The oldest and most prevalent approach to designing work is based on engineering 
concepts and methods. It proposes that the most efficient work designs can be deter￾mined by clearly specifying the tasks to be performed, the work methods to be used, 
and the work flow among individuals. The engineering approach is based on the pio￾neering work of Frederick Taylor, the father of scientific management. He developed 
methods for analyzing and designing work and laid the foundation for the professional 
field of industrial engineering.1
16377
The engineering approach scientifically analyzes workers’ tasks to discover those 
procedures that produce the maximum output with the minimum input of energies 
and resources.2
 This generally results in work designs with high levels of specialization 
and specification. Such designs have several benefits: They allow workers to learn tasks 
rapidly; they permit short work cycles so performance can take place with little or no 
mental effort; and they reduce costs because lower-skilled people can be hired and 
trained easily and paid relatively low wages.
The engineering approach produces two kinds of work design: traditional jobs and 
traditional work groups. When the work can be completed by one person, such as with 
bank tellers and telephone operators, traditional jobs are created. These jobs tend to 
be simplified, with routine and repetitive tasks having clear specifications concerning 
time and motion. When the work requires coordination among people, such as on 
automobile assembly lines, traditional work groups are developed. They are composed 
of members performing relatively routine yet related tasks. The overall group task is 
typically broken into simpler, discrete parts (often called jobs). The tasks and work 
methods are specified for each part, and the parts are assigned to group members. Each 
member performs a routine and repetitive part of the group task. Members’ separate 
task contributions are coordinated for overall task achievement through such external 
controls as schedules, rigid work flows, and supervisors.3
 In the 1950s and 1960s, this 
method of work design was popularized by the assembly lines of American automobile 
manufacturers and was an important reason for the growth of American industry fol￾lowing World War II.
The engineering approach to job design is less an OD intervention than a benchmark 
in history. Critics of the approach argue that the method ignores workers’ social and 
psychological needs. They suggest that the rising educational level of the workforce and 
the substitution of automation for menial labor point to the need for more enriched 
forms of work in which people have greater discretion and are more challenged. 
Moreover, the current competitive climate requires a more committed and involved 
workforce able to make online decisions and to develop performance innovations. 
Work designed with the employee in mind is more humanly fulfilling and produc￾tive than that designed in traditional ways. However, it is important to recognize the 
strengths of the engineering approach. It remains an important work design interven￾tion because its immediate cost savings and efficiency can be measured readily, and 
because it is well understood and easily implemented and managed.
THE MOTIVATIONAL APPROACH
The motivational approach to work design views the effectiveness of organizational 
activities primarily as a function of member needs and satisfaction, and seeks to 
improve employee performance and satisfaction by enriching jobs. The motivational 
method provides people with opportunities for autonomy, responsibility, closure (that 
is, doing a complete job), and performance feedback. Enriched jobs are popular in the 
United States at such companies as Wells Fargo, The Hartford, and Hewlett-Packard.
The motivational approach usually is associated with the research of Herzberg and 
of Hackman and Oldham. Herzberg’s two-factor theory of motivation proposed that 
certain attributes of work, such as opportunities for advancement and recognition, 
which he called motivators, help increase job satisfaction.4
 Other attributes, which 
Herzberg called hygiene factors, such as company policies, working conditions, pay, and 
supervision, do not produce satisfaction but rather prevent dissatisfaction—important 
contributors because only satisfied workers are motivated to produce. Successful job 
enrichment experiments at AT&T, Texas Instruments, and Imperial Chemical Industries 
helped to popularize job enrichment in the 1960s.5
CHAPTER 16 Work Design378 PART 4 Technostructural Interventions
Herzberg’s motivational and hygiene factors are intuitively appealing. However, they 
are difficult to put into operation and measure, and that makes implementation and 
evaluation of the theory difficult. Furthermore, important worker characteristics that 
can affect whether people will respond favorably to job enrichment were not included 
in his theory. Finally, Herzberg’s failure to involve employees in the job enrichment 
process itself does not suit most OD practitioners today. Consequently, a second, well￾researched approach to job enrichment has been favored. It focuses on the attributes of 
the work itself and has resulted in a more scientifically acceptable theory of job enrich￾ment than Herzberg’s model. The research of Hackman and Oldham represents this 
more recent trend in job enrichment.6
The Core Dimensions of Jobs
Considerable research has been devoted to defining and understanding core job dimen￾sions.7
 Figure 16.1 summarizes the Hackman and Oldham model of job design. Five 
core dimensions of work affect three critical psychological states, which in turn produce 
personal and job outcomes. These outcomes include high internal work motivation, 
high-quality work performance, satisfaction with the work, and low absenteeism and 
turnover. The five core job dimensions—skill variety, task identity, task significance, 
Text not available due to copyright restrictionsCHAPTER 16 Work Design 379
autonomy, and feedback from the work itself—are described below and associated with 
the critical psychological states that they create.
Skill Variety, Task Identity, and Task Significance These three core job characteristics 
influence the extent to which work is perceived as meaningful. Skill variety refers to the 
number and types of skills used to perform a particular task. Nurses in an oncology unit 
must be able to interact successfully with patients, patient families, and physicians. They 
must also juggle a variety of medical procedures, understand and apply the latest treat￾ment therapies, and perform a variety of charting tasks. The more tasks an individual 
performs, the more meaningful the job becomes. When skill variety is increased by 
moving a person from one job to another, a form of job enrichment called job rotation is 
accomplished. However, simply rotating a person from one boring job to another is not 
likely to produce the outcomes associated with a fully enriched job.
Task identity describes the extent to which an individual performs a whole piece of 
work. For example, an employee who completes an entire wheel assembly for an air￾plane, including the tire, chassis, brakes, and electrical and hydraulic systems, has more 
task identity and will perceive the work as more meaningful than someone who only 
assembles the braking subsystem. Job enlargement, another form of job enrichment that 
combines increases in skill variety with task identity, blends several narrow jobs into one 
larger, expanded job. For example, separate machine setup, machining, and inspection 
jobs might be combined into one. This method can increase meaningfulness, job satisfac￾tion, and motivation when employees comprehend and like the greater task complexity.
Task significance represents the impact that the work has on others. In jobs with 
high task significance, such as nursing, consulting, or manufacturing something like 
sensitive parts for the space shuttle, the importance of successful task completion cre￾ates meaningfulness for the worker.
Experienced meaningfulness is expressed as an average of these three dimensions. 
Thus, although it is advantageous to have high amounts of skill variety, task identity, 
and task significance, a strong emphasis on any one of the three dimensions can, at 
least partially, make up for deficiencies in the other two.
Autonomy This refers to the amount of independence, freedom, and discretion that 
the employee has to schedule and perform tasks. Salespeople, for example, often have 
considerable autonomy in how they contact, develop, and close new accounts, whereas 
assembly-line workers often have to adhere to work specifications clearly detailed in a 
policy-and-procedure manual. Employees are more likely to experience responsibility 
for their work outcomes when high amounts of autonomy exist.
Feedback from the Work Itself This core dimension represents the information that 
workers receive about the effectiveness of their work. It can derive from the work itself, 
as when determining whether an assembled part functions properly, or it can come from 
such external sources as reports on defects, budget variances, customer satisfaction, and 
the like. Because feedback from the work itself is direct and generates intrinsic satisfac￾tion, it is considered preferable to feedback from external sources.
Individual Differences
Not all people react in similar ways to job enrichment interventions. Individual 
differences—among them, a worker’s knowledge and skill levels, growth-need strength, 
and satisfaction with contextual factors—moderate the relationships among core 
dimensions, psychological states, and outcomes. “Worker knowledge and skill” refers 
to the education and experience levels characterizing the workforce. If employees 
lack the appropriate skills, for example, increasing skill variety may not improve a 
job’s meaningfulness. Similarly, if workers lack the intrinsic motivation to grow and 
develop personally, attempts to provide them with increased autonomy may be resisted. 380 PART 4 Technostructural Interventions
(We will discuss growth needs more fully in the last section of this chapter.) Finally, 
contextual factors include reward systems, supervisory style, and coworker satisfaction. 
When the employee is unhappy with the work context, attempts to enrich the work 
itself may be unsuccessful.
Application Stages
The basic steps for job enrichment as described by Hackman and Oldham include mak￾ing a thorough diagnosis of the situation, forming natural work units, combining tasks, 
establishing client relationships, vertical loading, and opening feedback channels.8
Making a Thorough Diagnosis The most popular method of diagnosing a job is using 
the Job Diagnostic Survey (JDS) or one of its variations.9 An important output of the 
JDS is the motivating potential score, which is a function of the three psychological 
states—experienced meaningfulness, autonomy, and feedback. The survey can be used 
to profile one or more jobs, to determine whether motivation and satisfaction are really 
problems or whether the job is low in motivating potential, and to isolate specific job 
aspects that are causing difficulties. Figure 16.2 shows two jobs. Job A in engineering 
maintenance is high on all of the core dimensions. Its motivating potential score is 260 
(motivating potential scores average about 125). Job B, the routine and repetitive task 
of answering frequently asked questions in a call center, has a motivating potential 
score of 30. The score is well below average and would be even lower except for the 
job’s relatively high task significance. This job could be redesigned and improved.

The JDS also indicates how ready employees are to accept change. Employees who 
have high growth needs will respond more readily to job enrichment than will those 
with low or weak growth needs. A thorough diagnosis of the existing work system 
should be completed before implementing actual changes. The JDS measures satisfaction 
with pay, coworkers, and supervision. If there is high dissatisfaction with one or more of 
these areas, other interventions might be more helpful prior to work redesign.
Forming Natural Work Units As much as possible, natural work units should be 
formed. Although there may be a number of technological constraints, interrelated 
task activities should be grouped together. The basic question in forming natural work 
units is “How can one increase ‘ownership’ of the task?” Forming such natural units 
increases two of the core dimensions—task identity and task significance—that con￾tribute to the meaningfulness of work.
Combining Tasks Frequently, divided jobs can be put back together to form a new and 
larger one. In a Corning Glass Works plant, the task of assembling laboratory hotplates 
was redesigned by combining a number of previously separate tasks. After the change, 
each hotplate was completely assembled, inspected, and shipped by one operator, result￾ing in an increased productivity of 84%. Controllable rejects dropped from 23 to less than 
1%, and absenteeism dropped from 8 to less than 1%.10 A later analysis indicated that 
the change in productivity was the result of the intervention.11 Combining tasks increases 
task identity and allows a worker to use a greater variety of skills. The hotplate assembler 
can identify with a finished product ready for shipment, and self-inspection of his or her 
work adds greater task significance, autonomy, and feedback from the job itself.
Establishing Client Relationships When jobs are split up, the typical worker has 
little or no contact with, or knowledge of, the ultimate user of the product or service. 
Improvements often can be realized simultaneously on three of the core dimensions 
by encouraging and helping workers to establish direct relationships with the clients 
of their work. For example, when an individual from a support pool is assigned to a 
particular department, feedback increases because of the additional opportunities for 
praise or criticism of his or her work. Because of the need to develop interpersonal 
skills in maintaining the client relationship, skill variety may increase. If the worker 
is given personal responsibility for deciding how to manage relationships with clients, 
autonomy is increased.
Three steps are needed to create client relationships: (1) The client must be iden￾tified; (2) the contact between the client and the worker needs to be established as 
directly as possible; and (3) criteria and procedures are needed by which the client can 
judge the quality of the product or service received and relay those judgments back to 
the worker. For example, even customer-service representatives and data-entry opera￾tions can be set up so that people serve particular clients. In the hotplate department, 
personal nametags can be attached to each instrument. The Indiana Bell Telephone 
Company found substantial improvements in satisfaction and performance when tele￾phone directory compilers were given accountability for a specific geographic area.12
Vertical Loading The intent of vertical loading is to decrease the gap between doing 
the job and controlling the job. A vertically loaded job has responsibilities and controls 
that formerly were reserved for management. Vertical loading may well be the most 
crucial of the job-design principles. Autonomy is invariably increased. This approach 
should lead to greater feelings of personal accountability and responsibility for the work 
outcomes. For example, at an IBM plant that manufactured circuit boards for personal 
computers, assembly workers were trained to measure the accuracy and speed of pro￾duction processes and to test the quality of finished products. Their work was more 
“whole,” they were more autonomous, and the engineers who measure and test were 
free to design better products and more efficient ways to manufacture them.13382 PART 4 Technostructural Interventions
Loss of vertical loading usually occurs when someone has made a mistake. Once a 
supervisor steps in, the responsibility may be removed indefinitely. For example, many 
skilled machinists have to complete forms to have maintenance people work on a 
machine. The supervisor automatically signs the slip rather than allowing the machin￾ist to either repair the machine or ask directly for maintenance support.
Opening Feedback Channels In almost all jobs, approaches exist to open feedback 
channels and help people learn whether their performance is remaining at a constant 
level, improving, or deteriorating. The most advantageous and least threatening feed￾back occurs when a worker learns about performance as the job is performed. In the 
hotplate department at Corning Glass Works, assembling the entire instrument and 
inspecting it dramatically increased the quantity and quality of performance informa￾tion available to the operators. Data given to a manager or supervisor often can be 
given directly to the employee. Computers and other automated operations can be 
used to provide people with data not currently accessible to them. Many organizations 
simply have not realized the motivating impact of direct, immediate feedback.
Application 16.1 presents an example of job enrichment at the Hartford Insurance 
Group. The employee relations consulting services (ERCS) group provided a single, one￾stop place for managers to get answers to employee relations questions, such as how 
to document employee discipline or how to advise employees on benefit changes, and 
allowed the human resource generalists to focus on the more strategic aspects of their 
work. The initial implementation of the ERCS produced jobs low in motivating potential 
and an internal organization effectiveness consultant helped to redesign the unit.14
Barriers to Job Enrichment
As the application of job enrichment has spread, a number of obstacles to significant 
job restructuring have been identified. Most of these barriers exist in the organizational 
context within which the job design is executed. Other organizational systems and 
practices, whether technical, managerial, or personnel, can affect both the implemen￾tation of job enrichment and the lifespan of whatever changes are made.
At least four organizational systems can constrain the implementation of job 
enrichment:15
The technical system. The technology of an organization can limit job enrichment 
by constraining the number of ways jobs can be changed. For example, long-linked 
technology like that found on an assembly line can be highly programmed and 
standardized, thus limiting the amount of employee discretion that is possible. 
Technology also may set an “enrichment ceiling.” Some types of work, such as 
continuous-process production systems, may be naturally enriched so there is little 
more that can be gained from a job enrichment intervention.
The human resource system. Human resources systems can constrain job 
enrichment by creating formalized job descriptions that are rigidly defined and limit 
flexibility in changing people’s job duties. For example, many union agreements 
include such narrowly defined job descriptions that major renegotiation between 
management and the union must occur before jobs can be significantly enriched.
The control system. Control systems, such as budgets, production reports, and 
accounting practices, can limit the complexity and challenge of jobs within the sys￾tem. For example, a company working on a government contract may have such 
strict quality control procedures that employee discretion is effectively curtailed.
The supervisory system. Supervisors determine to a large extent the amount 
of autonomy and feedback that subordinates can experience. To the extent that 
supervisors use autocratic methods and control work-related feedback, jobs will be 
difficult, if not impossible, to enrich.

4.Enriching Jobs at the Hartford’s Employee 
Relations Consulting Services Group
Founded in 1810, The Hartford Financial Services 
Group, Inc. is one of the largest U.S.-based providers 
of investment products (e.g., annuities, mutual 
funds, college savings plans), life insurance, group 
and employee benefits, automobile and home￾owners’ insurance, and business insurance serving 
millions of customers worldwide—including indi￾viduals, institutions, and businesses—through 
independent agents, brokers, through financial 
institutions, and online. With 30,000 employees 
and approximately $26.5 billion in income in 2006, 
The Hartford was ranked 78th on the 2006 Fortune 
100 list.
Hartford’s corporate human resources organization 
included about 175 HR Generalists (HRGs) that 
were deployed throughout the organi zation. In 
2003, a centralized internal group known as “HR 
Source” was created to handle lower-level HR 
transactions such as basic policy, protocol, and 
benefit questions. The HRGs continued to address 
the majority of all HR-related issues that arose 
within their respective units, including work￾force planning, change management, employee 
relations, and talent management. The range of 
responsibilities meant high levels of skill variety, 
the deployment to a business unit meant high 
levels of task identity and feedback, and the rel￾evance of their work meant high levels of task 
significance. However, the HRGs were also in high 
demand; the number of requests often exceeded 
the number of important responsibilities, and 
this made autonomy difficult. HRGs reported a 
high level of stress in their work and there was 
some variation in their results depending on such 
factors as leadership expectations, the skill set of 
the HRG, geographic location, and so on.
In 2006, and in response to this data, the Employee 
Relations Consulting Services (ERCS) organization 
was created. This new organi zation centralized 
ER transactions so that the HRGs could become a 
more effective strategic partner while also provid￾ing a more consistent approach to mitigate risk and 
improve the level, speed, and accuracy of service. 
In 2007, a business decision was made to outsource 
the HR Source functions to an outside vendor. For 
questions and requests related to employee relation 
(ER) matters that fell outside the expertise of the 
outsource vendor, the case would be escalated to 
the internal ERCS organization.
ERCS thus handled higher complexity policy appli￾cation and ER issues. The structure and organi￾zation design included 12 Employee Relations 
Consultants (ERCs), all of which were prior HRGs 
with knowledge and expertise in employee rela￾tions. In the initial start-up of ERCS, cases flowed 
into ERCS electronically and were assigned to the 
next available consultant, similar to a first-in, first￾out methodology. This approach required each 
of the consultants to be well versed in all types 
of employee relations issues and maintain a high 
level of skill variety. However, since the initial face 
to the customer was through an 800 number and 
handled by a third-party service provider, the ERCS 
had the feel of a call center despite the higher-level 
service offering. As a result, a customer expecta￾tion emerged that their request would be addressed 
right away or within a very short period of time, 
even though the calls related to complex ER mat￾ters that often required partnership with internal 
legal counsel and other staff functions.
After six months, the reality of the new organization 
was that the majority of the cases coming into 
ERCS involved performance issues, terminations, 
and other difficult situations that required consid￾erable research and consultation. To resolve the 
issues, the ERCs had to consult other functional 
organizations outside of their span of control, 
such as legal representatives, medical, and ben￾efits. This added to the comp lexity, dynamics, and 
turnaround time of each case. Coupled with the 
high volume of cases received each day, a very 
stressful environment emerged. While the ERCs 
believed they were doing everything possible 
to satisfy the customers, the customers seemed 
to keep demanding more and pushing for faster 
turnaround times.
An internal OD consultant was called in to assist 
with an assessment of the change and to make 
any improvements as needed. The OD con￾sultant worked closely with the Assistant Vice 
President, Employee Relations, and affiliated HRGs 
to understand the current situation. Although 
application 16.1384 PART 4 Technostructural Interventions
the organization had received some unsolicited, 
informal feedback, the assistant vice president 
wanted a more systematic assessment. To help 
frame the diagnosis, Galbraith’s STAR model 
and various six sigma tools and techniques were 
used to create surveys that were sent out to their 
customer base primarily comprised of managers 
(70%), employees (20%), and HRGs, recruiters, 
and other third party customers (representing the 
remaining 10%).
The results suggested that most customers were 
satisfied with the model and the service with 
some opportunities for improvement. Many of 
the comments complimented the ERCs for their 
professionalism, expert knowledge, and personal 
touches like the follow-up call after a case had 
been closed. Respondents also liked the centra￾lized ERCS model and agreed that such a model 
was smoother, more consistent, and reduced the 
risk of litigation. However, customers did want 
faster case-closure times, less “phone-tag,” and a 
single point of contact for cases like progressive 
discipline that required follow-up. Employees 
wanted someone they could talk with who would 
listen and empathize with them; while the HRGs 
felt “out of the loop” and were in need of a tool 
or report that would provide them with data to 
help them understand what types of trends were 
happening in their respective areas.
The OD consultant also interviewed the ERCs and 
observed their processes while talking with others 
in the organization to better understand what was 
working and not working. In general, although 
the work design could be characterized as “mod￾erately enriched,” the relative levels of skill 
variety, task identity, and feedback had declined. 
Instead of working on a broad array of HR issues 
and forming relationships, the ERCs were focused 
on individual employee relation cases. They were 
not working with a particular business, but rather 
the “first in, first out” work assignment process 
lowered overall task identity since the ERCs might 
work with the property and casualty business 
on one case but the life insurance business on 
another. Finally, unless managers or employees 
got back to the ERC on the outcome of the case, 
there was little feedback available. The volume 
of calls was high enough that it was hard for the 
ERCs to know what had happened after they 
had counseled the manager. In fact, following 
up with a customer and determining the level of 
satisfaction was not one of the metrics for which 
they were held accountable and typically only 
unsatisfied customers would call back to discuss 
it with a manager. In addition, the ERCs missed a 
sense of appreciation from their customers. Their 
work had shifted from relationship building and 
having an effect on the business to transactional 
processing and concentrating on how quickly they 
could answer/resolve a question.
While the centralized model made perfect sense 
from a business and risk-mitigation perspective, 
there was something missing from the system. 
Surprisingly, the HRGs had similar misgivings. 
Many of them missed being involved with some 
of the employee relations issues that helped them 
understand the pulse of the organization. As a 
result, the HRGs also wanted a consistent point of 
contact that could provide data on organizational 
trends. Thus, the HRGs wanted a relationship 
with the ERCs as much as the ERCs wanted one 
with them.
Based on this data, and in collaboration with the 
ER Assistant Vice President and the corporate 
HRGs, a program of redesign and implementation 
was established. With respect to the workflow and 
organizational design, the OD consultant recom￾mended the following changes to address the key 
issues:
• ERCS services were reorganized by line of 
business and customer-type. This reorganiza￾tion increased task identity and significance by 
associating an ERC with a particular business 
unit. As a result, the ERCs could develop a 
deeper-level expertise in and awareness of a 
particular business unit’s operations while also 
monitoring trend data and proactively identify￾ing potential problem areas with recommended 
solutions This had the benefit of addressing 
the customer’s request to have an ERC more 
closely aligned to their business, developing 
an intimate link between the ERCs, the busi￾ness managers and the deployed HRGs, while 
increasing task significance and processing 
feedback. ERCs working with a particular busi￾ness had more opportunity to understand how 
their work was affecting the organization and 
to hear about how their work was received 
while still being able to maintain a consistent 
approach and rationale for resolving cases. It is 
important to note that although they appeared 
to be assigned to a particular line of business, CHAPTER 16 Work Design 385
due to the tight capacity constraints, in case of 
a spike in volume, any of the ERCs could take 
on work from another line of business.
• It was also recommended that ERCS services 
be reorganized by case complexity. This change 
created new roles (e.g., senior- and junior-level 
ERCs and subject-matter experts), increased 
skill variety, and identified a viable career path. 
ERCS could now leverage the consultants’ skill 
set, knowledge, and capability based on the 
needs of the customer and the complexity of 
the case. For example, junior and senior ERCs 
could resolve a majority of the cases that came 
to ERCS. However, certain cases required a 
very deep level of knowledge or information 
that existed only in other departments of The 
Hartford. In these cases, additional research was 
needed. The subject-matter experts often had 
the experience to resolve an issue without hav￾ing to go outside ERCS and/or the relationships 
necessary to acquire the information from other 
departments quickly. By capitalizing on subject￾matter experts, such cases could be flowed 
immediately within ERCS. This deepened the 
skill variety and allowed subject- matter experts 
to have higher task significance and to add 
value to the process.
• The ERCS created and enhanced a series 
of lateral linkages through governance and 
partnership councils. These forums were 
used to communicate the trends and other 
events transpiring within the business and/or 
within ERCS that were beneficial to the cus￾tomer. Such sessions helped to close some of 
the communication gaps and allowed for a 
strengthened partnership between ERCS and 
the HRGs, and provided another avenue to 
enhance skill variety and task identity.
In combination with other changes in structure, hir￾ing, and metrics, the work of the ERCS organization 
was greatly enriched. In particular, the new organi￾zational design aligned the internal workflow with 
the needs of the customer. It created appropriate lat￾eral relationships and management practices to sat￾isfy the task identity and task significance needs of 
the ERCs, the lines of business, and the HRGs. While 
the change is still being implemented, employee 
satisfaction is improving, quality and case-closure 
time has improved, and the HRGs are anxious to 
receive their trend reports and to build relationships 
with their respective line of business ERC. Further 
monitoring of the effectiveness and efficiency of the 
new design will continue and be revisited within a 
year to ensure its success or need for change.
Once these implementation constraints have been overcome, other factors determine 
whether the effects of job enrichment are strong and lasting.16 Consistent with the con￾tingency approach to OD, the staying power of job enrichment depends largely on how 
well it fits and is supported by other organizational practices, such as training, com￾pensation, and supervision. These practices need to be congruent with and to reinforce 
jobs having high amounts of discretion, skill variety, and meaningful feedback.
Results of Job Enrichment
Hackman and Oldham reported data from the JDS on more than a thousand people 
in about a hundred different jobs in more than a dozen organizations.17 In general, 
they found that employees whose jobs were high on the core dimensions were more 
satisfied and motivated than were those whose jobs were low on the dimensions. The 
core dimensions also were related to such behaviors as absenteeism and performance, 
although the relationship was not strong for performance. In addition, they found 
that responses were more positive for people with high growth needs than for those 
with weaker ones. Similarly, recent research has shown that enriched jobs are strongly 386 PART 4 Technostructural Interventions
correlated with mental ability.18 Enriching the jobs of workers with low growth needs or 
with low knowledge and skills is more likely to produce frustration than satisfaction.
An impressive amount of research has been done on Hackman and Oldham’s 
approach to job enrichment. In addition, a number of studies have extended and 
refined their approach, including a modification of the original JDS instrument to pro￾duce more reliable data19 and the incorporation of such other moderators as the need 
for achievement and job longevity.20 In general, research has supported the proposed 
relationships between job characteristics and outcomes, including the moderating 
effects of growth needs, knowledge and skills, and context satisfaction.21 In regard to 
context satisfaction, for example, research indicates that employee turnover, dissatis￾faction, and withdrawal are associated with dark offices, a lack of privacy, and high 
worker densities.22
Reviews of the job enrichment research also report positive effects. An analysis of 28 
studies concluded that the job characteristics are positively related to job satisfaction, 
particularly for people with high growth needs.23 Another review concluded that job 
enrichment is effective at reducing employee turnover.24 A different examination of 
28 job enrichment studies reported overwhelmingly positive results.25 Improvements 
in quality and cost measures were reported slightly more frequently than improve￾ments in employee attitudes and quantity of production. However, the studies suf￾fered from methodological weaknesses that suggest that the positive findings should 
be viewed with some caution. Another review of 16 job enrichment studies showed 
mixed results.26 Thirteen of the programs were developed and implemented solely 
by management. These studies showed significant reduction in absenteeism, turn￾over, and grievances, and improvements in production quality in only about half of 
the cases where these variables were measured. The three studies with high levels of 
employee participation in the change program showed improvements in these vari￾ables in all cases where they were measured. Although it is difficult to generalize from 
such a small number of studies, employee participation in the job enrichment program 
appears to enhance the success of such interventions.
Finally, a comprehensive meta-analysis of more than 75 empirical studies of the 
Hackman and Oldham model found modest support for the overall model.27 Although 
some modifications to the model appear warranted, the studies suggested that many 
of the more substantive criticisms were unfounded. For example, research supported 
the conclusion that the relationships between core job characteristics and psychological 
outcomes were stronger and more consistent than the relationships between core job 
dimensions and work performance, although these latter relationships did exist and 
were meaningful. The researchers also found support for the proposed linkages among 
core job dimensions, critical psychological states, and psychological outcomes. It is 
interesting that the job feedback dimension emerged as the strongest and most consis￾tent predictor of both psychological and behavioral work outcomes. The researchers 
suggested that of all job characteristics, increasing feedback had the most potential for 
improving work productivity and satisfaction. The role of growth-need strength as a 
moderator was also supported, especially between core dimensions and work perfor￾mance. Clearly, research supporting the job enrichment model is plentiful. Although 
the evidence suggests that the model is not perfect, it does appear to be a reasonable 
guide to improving the motivational outcomes of work.
THE SOCIOTECHNICAL SYSTEMS APPROACH
The sociotechnical systems (STS) approach is currently the most extensive body of 
scientific and applied work underlying employee involvement and innovative work 
designs. Its techniques and design principles derive from extensive action research 
in both public and private organizations across diverse national cultures. This section CHAPTER 16 Work Design 387
reviews the conceptual foundations of the STS approach and then describes its most 
popular application: self-managed work teams.
Conceptual Background
Sociotechnical systems theory was developed originally at the Tavistock Institute of 
Human Relations in London and has spread to most industrialized nations in a little 
more than 50 years. In Europe and particularly Scandinavia, STS interventions are 
almost synonymous with work design and employee involvement. In Canada and 
the United States, STS concepts and methods underlie many of the innovative work 
designs and team-based structures that are so prevalent in contemporary organiza￾tions. Intel Corporation, United Technologies, General Mills, and Procter & Gamble are 
among the many organizations applying the STS approach to transforming how work 
is designed and performed.
STS theory is based on two fundamental premises: that an organization or work 
unit is a combined, social-plus-technical system (sociotechnical), and that this system 
is open in relation to its environment.28
Sociotechnical System The first assumption suggests that whenever human beings 
are organized to perform tasks, a joint system is operating—a sociotechnical system. 
This system consists of two independent but related parts: a social part, including the 
people performing the tasks and the relationships among them; and a technical part, 
including the tools, techniques, and methods for task performance. These two parts are 
independent of each other because each follows a different set of behavioral laws. The 
social part operates according to biological and psychosocial laws, whereas the techni￾cal part functions according to mechanical and physical laws. Nevertheless, the two 
parts are related because they must act together to accomplish tasks. Hence, the term 
“sociotechnical” signifies the joint relationship that must occur between the social and 
the technical parts, and the word “system” communicates that this connection results 
in a unified whole.
Because a sociotechnical system is composed of social and technical parts, it follows 
that it will produce two kinds of outcomes: products, such as goods and services; and 
social and psychological consequences, such as job satisfaction and commitment. The 
key issue is how to design the relationship between the two parts so that both outcomes 
are positive (referred to as joint optimization). Sociotechnical practitioners design work 
and organizations so that the social and technical parts work well together, producing 
high levels of product and human satisfaction. This effort contrasts with the engineer￾ing approach to designing work, which focuses on the technical component, worries 
about fitting in people later, and often leads to mediocre performance at high social 
costs. The STS approach also contrasts with the motivational approach, which views 
work design in terms of human fulfillment and that can lead to satisfied employees but 
inefficient work processes.
Environmental Relationship The second major premise underlying STS theory is that 
such systems are open to their environments. As discussed in Chapter 5, open systems 
must interact with their environments to survive and develop. The environment pro￾vides the STS with necessary inputs of energy, raw materials, and information, and the 
STS provides the environment with products and services. The key issue here is how to 
design the interface between the STS and its environment so that the system has suffi￾cient freedom to function while exchanging effectively with the environment. In what 
is typically called boundary management, STS practitioners structure environmental 
relationships both to protect the system from external disruptions and to facilitate the 
exchange of necessary resources and information. This enables the STS to adapt to 
changing conditions and to influence the environment in favorable directions.388 PART 4 Technostructural Interventions
In summary, STS theory suggests that effective work systems jointly optimize the 
relationship between their social and technical parts. Moreover, such systems effec￾tively manage the boundary separating and relating them to the environment. This 
allows them to exchange with the environment while protecting themselves from 
external disruptions.
Self-Managed Work Teams
The most prevalent application of the STS approach is self-managed work teams.29
Alternatively referred to as self-directed, self-regulating, or high-performance work 
teams, these work designs consist of members performing interrelated tasks.30 Self￾managed teams typically are responsible for a complete product or service, or a major 
part of a larger production process. They control members’ task behaviors and make 
decisions about task assignments and work methods. In many cases, the team sets its 
own production goals within broader organizational limits and may be responsible for 
support services, such as maintenance, purchasing, and quality control. Team members 
generally are expected to learn many if not all of the jobs within the team’s control 
and frequently are paid on the basis of knowledge and skills rather than seniority. 
When pay is based on performance, team rather than individual performance is the 
standard.
Self-managed work teams are being implemented at a rapid rate across a range of 
industries and organizations, such as Intel, Boeing, General Mills, General Electric, and 
Motorola. A 2006 survey of Fortune 1000 companies found that 65% of these firms 
were using self-managed work teams, a small decrease compared to the 2001 data, 
but a 40% increase from 1987.31 Although this work design typically does not cover 
a majority of the workforce, this represents an impressive increase in the use of self￾managed teams.
Figure 16.3 is a model explaining how self-managed work teams perform. It summa￾rizes current STS research and shows how teams can be designed for high performance. 
Although the model is based mainly on experience with teams that perform the daily 
work of the organization (work teams), it also has relevance to other team designs, 
such as problem-solving teams, management teams, cross-functional integrating 
teams, and employee involvement teams.32 The model shows that team performance

and member satisfaction follow directly from how well the team functions: how well 
members communicate and coordinate with each other, resolve conflicts and prob￾lems, and make and implement task-relevant decisions. Team functioning, in turn, is 
influenced by three major inputs: team task design, team process interventions, and 
organization support systems. Because these inputs affect how well teams function and 
subsequently perform, they are key intervention targets for designing and implement￾ing self-managed work teams.
Team Task Design Self-managed work teams are responsible for performing particular 
tasks; consequently, how the team is designed for task performance can have a power￾ful influence on how well it functions. Task design generally follows from the team’s 
mission and goals that define the major purpose of the team and provide direction for 
task achievement. When a team’s mission and goals are closely aligned with corporate 
strategy and business objectives, members can see how team performance contributes 
to organization success. This can increase member commitment to team goals.
Team task design links members’ behaviors to task requirements and to each other. 
It structures member interactions and performances. Three task-design elements are 
necessary for creating self-managed work teams: task differentiation, boundary con￾trol, and task control.33 Task differentiation involves the extent to which the team’s task 
is autonomous and forms a relatively self-completing whole. High levels of task dif￾ferentiation provide an identifiable team boundary and a clearly defined area of team 
responsibility. At Johnsonville Sausage, for example, self-managed teams comprise 
7–14 members each. Each team is large enough to accomplish a set of interrelated tasks 
but small enough to allow face-to-face meetings for coordination and decision making. 
In many hospitals, self-managed nursing teams are formed around interrelated tasks 
that together produce a relatively whole piece of work. Thus, nursing teams may be 
responsible for particular groups of patients, such as those in intensive care or undergo￾ing cancer treatments, or they may be accountable for specific work processes, such as 
those in the laboratory, pharmacy, or admissions office.
Boundary control involves the extent to which team members can influence 
transactions with their task environment—the types and rates of inputs and outputs. 
Adequate boundary control includes a well-defined work area; group responsibility 
for boundary-control decisions, such as quality assurance (which reduces depen￾dence on external boundary regulators, such as inspectors); and members sufficiently 
trained to perform tasks without relying heavily on external resources. Boundary 
control often requires deliberate cross-training of team members to take on a variety 
of tasks. This makes members highly flexible and adaptable to changing conditions. It 
also reduces the need for costly overhead because members can perform many of the 
tasks typically assigned to staff experts, such as those in quality control, planning, and 
maintenance.
Task control involves the degree to which team members can regulate their own 
behavior to provide services or to produce finished products. It includes the freedom 
to choose work methods, to schedule activities, and to influence production goals to 
match both environmental and task demands. Task control relies heavily on team 
members having the power and authority to manage equipment, materials, and 
other resources needed for task performance. This “work authority” is essential if 
members are to take responsibility for getting the work accomplished. Task control 
also requires that team members have accurate and timely information about team 
performance to allow them to detect performance problems and make necessary 
adjustments.
Task control enables self-managed work teams to observe and control technical 
variances as quickly and as close to their source as possible. Technical variances arise 
from the production process and represent significant deviations from specific goals or 390 PART 4 Technostructural Interventions
standards. In manufacturing, for example, abnormalities in raw material, machine oper￾ation, and work flow are sources of variance that can adversely affect the quality and 
quantity of the finished product. In service work, out-of-the-ordinary requests, special 
favors or treatment, or unique demands create variances that can place stress on the pro￾cess. Technical variances traditionally are controlled by support staff and managers, but 
this can take time and add greatly to costs. Self-managed work teams, on the other hand, 
have the freedom, skills, and information needed to control technical variances online 
when they occur. This affords timely responses to production problems and reduces the 
amount of staff overhead needed.
Team Process Interventions A second key input to team functioning involves team 
process interventions. As described in Chapter 12, teams may develop ineffective 
social processes that impede functioning and performance, such as poor communica￾tion among members, dysfunctional roles and norms, and faulty problem solving and 
decision making. Team process interventions, such as process consultation and team 
building, can resolve such problems by helping members address process problems and 
moving the team to a more mature stage of development. Because self-managed work 
teams need to be self-reliant, members generally acquire their own team process skills. 
They may attend appropriate training programs and workshops or they may learn on 
the job by working with OD practitioners to conduct process interventions on their 
own teams. Although members’ process skills generally are sufficient to resolve most 
of the team’s process problems, OD experts occasionally may need to supplement the 
team’s skills and help members address problems that they are unable to resolve.
Organization Support Systems The final input to team functioning is the extent to 
which the larger organization is designed to support self-managed work teams. The suc￾cess of such teams clearly depends on support systems that are quite different from tra￾ditional methods of managing.34 For example, a bureaucratic, mechanistic organization 
is not highly conducive to self-managed teams. An organic structure, with flexibility 
among units, relatively few formal rules and procedures, and decentralized authority, 
is much more likely to support and enhance the development of self-managed work 
teams. This explains why such teams are so prevalent in high-involvement organiza￾tions (described in Chapter 15). Their different features, such as flat, lean structures, 
open information systems, and team-based selection and reward practices, all reinforce 
teamwork and responsible self-management.
A particularly important support system for self-managed work teams is the exter￾nal leadership. Self-managed teams exist along a spectrum ranging from having only 
mild influence over their work to near-autonomy. In many circumstances, such teams 
take on a variety of functions traditionally handled by management. These can include 
assigning members to individual tasks, determining the methods of work, scheduling, 
setting production goals, and selecting and rewarding members. These activities do not 
make external supervision obsolete, however. That leadership role usually is changed 
to two major functions: working with and developing team members, and assisting the 
team in managing its boundaries.35
Working with and developing team members is a difficult process and requires a 
different style of managing than do traditional systems. The team leader (often called 
a team facilitator) helps team members organize themselves in a way that allows 
them to become more independent and responsible. He or she must be familiar with 
team-building approaches and must assist members in learning the skills to perform 
their jobs. Recent research suggests that the leader needs to provide expertise in self￾management.36 This may include encouraging team members to be self-reinforcing 
about high performance, to be self-critical of low performance, to set explicit perfor￾mance goals, to evaluate goal achievement, and to rehearse different performance 
strategies before trying them.CHAPTER 16 Work Design 391
If team members are to maintain sufficient autonomy to control variance from 
goal attainment, the leader may need to help them manage team boundaries. Where 
teams have limited control over their task environment, the leader may act as a buf￾fer to reduce environmental uncertainty. This can include mediating and negotiat￾ing with other organizational units, such as higher management, staff experts, and 
related work teams. Research suggests that better managers spend more time in lateral 
interfaces.37
These new leadership roles require new and different skills, including knowledge of 
sociotechnical principles and group dynamics, understanding of both the task environ￾ment and the team’s technology, and ability to intervene in the team to help members 
increase their knowledge and skills. Leaders of self-managed teams also should have 
the ability to counsel members and to facilitate communication among them.
Many managers have experienced problems trying to fulfill the complex demands 
of leading self-managed work teams. The most typical complaints mention ambiguity 
about responsibilities and authority, lack of personal and technical skills and organiza￾tional support, insufficient attention from higher management, and feelings of frustra￾tion in the supervisory job.38 Attempts to overcome these problems have been made 
in the following areas:39
Recruitment and selection. Recruitment has been directed at selecting team 
leaders with a balanced mixture of technical and social skills. Those with extensive 
technical experience have been paired with more socially adept leaders so that 
both can share skills and support each other.
Training. Extensive formal and on-the-job training in human relations, group 
dynamics, and leadership styles has been instituted for leaders of self- managed 
work teams. Such training is aimed at giving leaders concepts for understanding 
their roles, as well as hands-on experience in team building, process consultation, 
and third-party intervention (see Chapter 12).
Evaluation and reward systems. Attempts have been made to tie team leader 
rewards to achievements in team development. Leaders prepare developmental plans 
for individual workers and the team as a whole, and set measurable benchmarks for 
progress. Performance appraisals of leaders are conducted within a group format, 
with feedback supplied by team members, peers, and higher-level management.
Leadership support systems. Leaders of self-managed work teams have been 
encouraged to develop peer support groups. Team leaders can meet off-site to 
share experiences and to address issues of personal and general concern.
Use of freed-up time. Team leaders have been provided with a mixture of strat￾egies to apply their talents beyond the immediate work team. A team leader has 
more time when the team has matured and taken on many managerial functions. 
In those cases, team leaders have been encouraged to become involved in such 
areas as higher-level planning and budgeting, companywide training and develop￾ment, and individual career development.
Application Stages
STS work designs have been implemented in a variety of settings, including 
manufacturing firms, hospitals, schools, and government agencies. Although the spe￾cific implementation strategy is tailored to the situation, a common method of change 
underlies many of these applications. It generally involves high worker participation 
in work design and implementation. Such participative work design allows employees 
to translate their special knowledge of the work situation into relevant designs, and 
employees with ownership over the design process are likely to be highly committed 
to implementing the outcomes.40

5.392 PART 4 Technostructural Interventions
STS applications generally proceed in six steps:41
Sanctioning the Design Effort. At this step, workers receive the necessary 
protection and support to diagnose their work system and to create an appropriate 
work design. In many unionized situations, top management and union officials 
jointly agree to suspend temporarily the existing work rules and job classifications 
so that employees have the freedom to explore new ways of working. Management 
also may provide workers with sufficient time and external help to diagnose their 
work system and devise alternative work structures. In cases of redesigning exist￾ing work systems, normal production demands may be reduced during the rede￾sign process. Also, workers may be given some job and wage security so that they 
feel free to try new designs without fear of losing their jobs or money.
Diagnosing the Work System. This step includes analyzing the work system 
to discover how it is operating. Knowledge of existing operations (or of intended 
operations, in the case of a new work system) is the basis for creating an appro￾priate work design. STS practitioners have devised diagnostic models applicable 
to work systems that make products or deliver services. The models analyze a 
system’s technical and social parts and assess how well the two fit each other. The 
task environment facing the system also is analyzed to see how well it is meeting 
external demands, such as customer quality requirements.
Generating Appropriate Designs. Based on the diagnosis, the work system 
is redesigned to fit the situation. Although this typically results in self-managed 
work teams, it is important to emphasize that the diagnosis may reveal that tasks 
are not very interdependent and that an individual-job work design, such as an 
enriched job, might be more appropriate. Two important STS principles guide the 
design process.
The first principle, compatibility, suggests that the process of designing work 
should fit the values and objectives underlying the approach. For example, the major 
goals of STS design are joint optimization and boundary management. A work￾design process compatible with those objectives would be highly participative, 
involving those having a stake in the work design, such as employees, managers, 
engineers, and staff experts. They would jointly decide how to create the social and 
technical components of work, as well as the environmental exchanges. This partici￾pative process increases the likelihood that design choices will be based simultane￾ously on technical, social, and environmental criteria. How well the compatibility 
guideline is adhered to can determine how well the work design subsequently is 
implemented.42
The second design principle is called minimal critical specification. It suggests that 
STS designers should specify only those critical features needed to implement the work 
design. All other features of the design should be left free to vary with the circum￾stances. In most cases, minimal critical specification identifies what is to be done, 
not how it will be accomplished. This allows employees considerable freedom to 
choose work methods, task allocations, and job assignments to match changing 
conditions.
The output of this design step specifies the new work design. In the case of self￾managed teams, this includes the team’s mission and goals, an ideal work flow, 
the skills and knowledge required of team members, a plan for training members 
to meet those requirements, and a list of the decisions the team will make now as 
well as the ones it should make over time as members develop greater skills and 
knowledge.
Specifying Support Systems. As suggested above, organizational support sys￾tems may have to be changed to support new work designs. When self- managed 
teams are designed, for example, the basis for pay and measurement systems may

need to change from individual to team performance to facilitate necessary task 
interaction among workers.
Implementing and Evaluating the Work Designs. This stage involves mak￾ing necessary changes to implement the work design and evaluating the results. 
For self-managing teams, implementation generally requires a great amount of 
training so that workers gain the necessary technical and social skills to perform 
multiple tasks and to control task behaviors. It also may entail developing the 
team through various team-building and process- consultation activities. OD con￾sultants often help team members carry out these tasks with a major emphasis 
on helping them gain competence in this area. Evaluation of the work design 
is necessary both to guide the implementation process and to assess the overall 
effectiveness of the design. In some cases, the evaluation information suggests 
the need for further diagnosis and redesign efforts.
Continual Change and Improvement. This last step points out that STS design￾ing never is complete but rather continues as new things are learned and new con￾ditions are encountered. Thus, the ability to design and redesign work continually 
needs to be built into existing work designs. Members must have the skills and 
knowledge to assess their work unit continually and to make necessary changes 
and improvements. From this view, STS designing rarely results in a stable work 
design but instead provides a process for modifying work continually to fit chang￾ing conditions and to make performance improvements.
Application 16.2 describes how one of ASEA Brown Boveri’s plants implemented self￾managed teams.43 It clearly demonstrates the importance of aligning the systems to sup￾port self-management as well as the process of gradually increasing the team’s autonomy 
and responsibility.
Results of Self-Managed Teams
Research on STS design efforts is extensive. For example, a 1994 bibliography by 
researchers at Eindhoven University of Technology in The Netherlands found 3,082 
English-language studies.44 As with reports on job enrichment, most of the published 
reports on self-managed teams show favorable results.45
A series of famous case studies at General Foods’ Gaines Pet Food/Topeka plant, the 
Saab-Scania engine assembly plant, and Volvo’s Kalmar and Uddevalla plants provide 
one set of positive findings.46 In each case, productivity and other technical measures 
of efficiency and quality improved significantly. In addition, measures of job satisfac￾tion and other attitudes also improved. Perhaps most importantly, these improvements 
were sustained over time.
A second set of studies supporting the positive impact of sociotechnical design teams 
comes from research comparing self-managed teams with other interventions. For 
example, a longitudinal comparative study of self-managed teams and job enrichment 
conducted in a Midwestern U.S. food-processing plant found that one year after start-up, 
production was 133% higher than originally planned, start-up costs were 7.7% lower 
than expected, and employee attitudes were extremely positive about the change.47
This study also permitted a comparison of self-managing groups with job enrichment, 
which occurred in another department of the company. Both interventions included 
survey feedback. The self-managing project involved technological changes, whereas 
the job enrichment program did not. The results showed that the interventions had 
similar positive effects in terms of employee attitudes, but only the self-managing 
project had significant improvements in productivity and costs. Thus, the productivity 
improvements may not be attributed solely to the self-managed teams but might also 
be the result of the technological changes.

Moving to Self-Managed Teams at ABB
The ASEA Brown Boveri (ABB) Industrial Systems 
plant in Columbus, Ohio, was part of ABB’s 
Industrial and Building Systems division. It pro￾duced low-volume, made-to-order industrial proc￾ess and quality control systems. A single system 
included mechanical and hydraulic machinery, 
high-speed computer processors, and high-speed/
high-accuracy measurement sensors that incor￾porated infrared, microwave, and other optical 
technologies packaged for severe environments. 
Customers for these control systems included the 
pulp and paper, chemical, petrochemical, pharma￾ceutical, metals, textiles, and food industries.
Overall demand for industrial control systems 
expanded steadily during the 1980s. But in 1990, 
demand dropped sharply and competition from 
international manufacturers increased. Ken Morris 
became vice president of manufacturing at the 
Columbus plant in 1991. Unfortunately, Morris 
arrived at a time when the manufacturing perfor￾mance at the Columbus plant had not kept pace 
with the global market. Overhead costs above 
industry averages and low quality of suppliers’ 
products combined to produce a net loss for 4 
straight years. Morris recognized another sign of 
trouble when he repeatedly observed employees 
from different departments meeting separately 
with the same customers and not communicating 
with the other departments about the discussions 
they had with their mutual customers. “We had 
a silo-based organization. No one knew what the 
other was doing,” Morris explained.
Based on this and other information, Morris’s 
original idea was to create more flexibility for 
employees to work with customers and suppliers. 
“I had done a lot of reading about teams,” he 
said, “and I knew that a lot of folks in the indus￾try were talking about moving to total quality 
management or teams over the next few years. 
But I wasn’t interested in teaming for teaming’s 
sake. Whatever we did had to keep us alive, and 
I didn’t have years to do it. I had to do some￾thing now.” Morris laid out a change plan that 
would radically reshape the structure and sys￾tems that governed the Columbus plant. At the 
center of the reorganization was the concept of 
the high- performance work system. Eventually,
19 teams—12 production process teams and seven 
continuous improvement teams—would be the 
fundamental work units of the 186-employee 
plant.
ABB’s move to a high-performance, team-based 
work system proceeded in a stepwise fashion, each 
step building on the previous one. Morris began 
the effort by preparing both his leadership team 
and the plant’s employees for the coming changes. 
An off-site meeting was used to educate members 
of his leadership staff on the basics of team-based 
organizations and to gain their ownership in the 
plant’s new direction. One output of the retreat 
was the formation of a “high-performance work 
system” design team that worked for six months 
to create a change plan. Another important output 
was the new mission for the ABB Columbus plant: 
“To become recognized as the best time-based
competitor in the world” by developing a customer￾focused environment with a passion for process 
management and waste reduction, and a desire to 
unleash the power of people. Morris also began 
to hold quarterly meetings with all plant employ￾ees and to share information with them about 
competitors, the industry, planning, and financial 
conditions. For most employees the inaugural 
quarterly meeting was the first time they had 
heard that the plant was operating at a loss.
Implementing the high-performance work system 
at ABB Columbus was formally initiated by adopt￾ing a set of industry benchmarks for products and 
processes in 1991. These quality measurements 
became the first goals for the plant’s production 
system. In this way, Morris and his team hoped to 
get the manufacturing and supply processes under 
control. Implementation continued with technical 
changes in the work flow, including adoption of 
a just-in-time production process and installation 
of a new, fully integrated management informa￾tion system. These changes dramatically increased 
the interdependency between steps in the work 
flow. The organization structure was changed 
from functional silos to a process-based structure 
in November 1993.
As the structure evolved, ABB emphasized train￾ing as a key to its success. “Education and 
training shifted us to the paradigm we wanted. 
Without that investment, we would have only 
seen incremental improvements,” said Morris. 
application 16.2CHAPTER 16 Work Design 395
“The quantum improvements we achieved were 
possible because we created a new vision of what 
was possible and then taught ourselves how to 
achieve it.” Every ABB employee participated in 
a rigorous program of high-performance work 
systems, just-in-time manufacturing systems, 
conflict resolution, and ISO 9000 standards and 
processes. As noted by human resources internal 
consultant Mari Jo Cary, “The high-performance 
work system created a business environment to 
produce a quality product and on-time deliv￾ery at the right price for our customers.” Plant 
employees continued to spend 4.5% of their time 
on training and education. These preparatory 
changes allowed for establishing the first process 
teams and process improvement teams following 
the restructuring.
The movement toward a team-based organization 
was slow and frustrating. The changes came at a 
time of falling production that increased unit costs 
and of rising turnover at all levels of the organiza￾tion. Furthermore, negative attitudes toward teams 
surfaced in the 1992 employee survey. Employee 
complaints continued to rise about the frequency 
of meetings, team goals that seemed unreachable, 
and the time it took to operate as a team.
The 12 process teams were formed around three 
key product lines and five support processes, 
such as supply management, engineering, metal 
fabrication, traffic management, and financial 
and human resources support. Each team con￾sisted of 6–15 members who, in addition to their 
manufacturing responsibilities, could serve as a 
coordinator for one of the seven team functions: 
time management, quality, safety, just-in-time 
processes, supply management, communications, 
and continuous improvement. Each team was 
chartered by its process owner—a senior-level 
manager for that product line who was responsi￾ble for two or three teams. Each charter described 
the team’s purpose and vision, the roles and 
responsibilities of team members, processes for 
selection and dismissal, and norms of team mem￾ber behavior.
While the production and support process teams 
were charged with meeting the benchmark stan￾dards for cycle time, quality, and cost, the seven 
process improvement teams worked to enhance 
efficiency and effectiveness within and across the 
production process teams. For example, a supply 
management process improvement team initiated 
a supplier excellence certification process. Each 
supplier was rated on a “report card.” Those who 
didn’t rate well were eliminated from the list of 
eligible suppliers; those who rated well received 
contracts. Eventually, continuous improvement 
in the supply management process led to elimina￾tion of all inspections of incoming material, the 
direct delivery of supplies to the point of use rather 
than into inventory, the elimination of a 115,000-
square-foot storage facility, and the creation of a 
planner/supply management expert role for each 
production process team.
A key feature of ABB’s transition to a fully 
self-managed team environment was the 
teams’ gradual adoption of more and more 
responsibility and decision-making author￾ity. ABB developed 24 “points of implementa￾tion,” outlining responsibilities common to all 
teams. These 24 key team functions ranged 
from simple tasks (e.g., housekeeping, equip￾ment maintenance, and control of scrap mate￾rial), to more difficult functions (e.g., vacation 
scheduling, control of materials and inven￾tory, and job design), to advanced team func￾tions (e.g., conflict resolution, selection of new
members, and, ultimately, compensation decisions). 
Initially, all teams were assigned a low level of 
accountability and empowerment (level 1) for each 
of the 24 points. At that stage, the team had little 
ownership for the function. Although the process 
owner worked with the team, accountability for 
team behaviors rested with that owner. Higher 
levels of empowerment increased the amounts of 
responsibility, authority, and accountability over 
key functions. At level 4, the team developed 
and implemented plans without review, and 
team accountability rested with team members. 
Boundary management and compensation deci￾sions were shared with the process owner.
To reach the highest level of autonomy and 
accountability (level 4), a team first had to be 
introduced to the meaning and concept of the 
particular function. The team’s next step was to 
take the function and create a plan to implement 
and perform ongoing management of that func￾tion. The third step was to demonstrate that it had 
the ability to implement the plan and manage the 
function without assistance. As the final step in 
becoming accountable for a function, the process 
owner signified that the team was fully empowered 
for future actions within this function. These396 PART 4 Technostructural Interventions
points of implementation laid out a clear road map 
for each team and provided it with clear boundar￾ies regarding its level of autonomy, responsibility, 
and accountability.
By 1995, each team was completely self- managed. 
All functions traditionally conducted by a man￾ager or team leader were handled by the team. 
Teams answered directly to their process owner 
and customers, and in 1996 began conducting 
their own performance evaluations using a 360-
degree process. When the teams required knowl￾edge or skills outside of their existing capabilities, 
they called upon subject-matter experts within 
the plant who provided support in such areas as 
order management, price/cost quoting, material 
sourcing and control, production, inventory con￾trol, product quality, packing, and invoicing.
The results of ABB’s effort were impressive. By 
1994, the Columbus plant had achieved the fol￾lowing performance improvements:
• Warranty costs had been reduced by 74%.
• Revenue generated per person was up 212%.
• Work-in-progress turnover was up 222%.
• Total cycle time had been reduced from
16.2 weeks to 4.3 weeks, a 73% reduction.
• Seven managers and 25 supervisors had been 
replaced with five process owners.
By 1995, the Columbus plant had posted a profit 
for the first time since 1990, and all key financial 
and performance objectives were met or exceeded. 
In addition, its 95.3% on-time-to-customer rating 
was recognized as a best-in-class benchmark, and 
the plant was named among Industry Week’s top 
10 plants.
More recently, a rigorous field experiment in a telecommunications company com￾pared self-managed teams with traditionally designed work groups performing the 
same types of tasks. The study found significant differences between the two groups 
in job satisfaction, growth-needs satisfaction, social-needs satisfaction, and group sat￾isfaction. Self-managing group members and higher-level managers perceived group 
performance as superior to traditionally managed groups. In contrast to these overall 
findings, however, objective measures of service quality and customer satisfaction did 
not differ between the two types of groups.48
A third set of positive results comes from reviews, or meta-analyses, of other stud￾ies. One review examined 16 studies and showed that when productivity, costs, and 
quality were measured, improvements occurred in more than 85% of the cases.49
Significant reductions in employee turnover and absenteeism rates and improvements 
in employee attitudes were reported in about 70% of the cases where these variables 
were measured. Certain methodological weaknesses in the studies suggest, however, 
that the positive results should be viewed carefully. Another review of 12 studies of 
self-managed groups showed improvements in hard performance measures in about 
67% of the cases where such measures were taken.50 Both of these reviews also 
included job enrichment studies, as reported earlier in this chapter. The relative impact 
of self-managing groups seems about equal to that of job enrichment, especially when 
the latter includes worker participation in the design process.
Three more recent meta-analyses also provide general support for self- managed 
teams. In a review of all STS work-design studies conducted in the 1970s, researchers 
found a strong positive relationship between the installation of self-managed teams 
and the attitudinal and economic gains.51 These designs were found to increase 
employee satisfaction; to reduce production costs through group member innovations; CHAPTER 16 Work Design 397
and to decrease absenteeism, turnover, and accident rates. The researchers reported 
little evidence for claims of increased productivity primarily because of the lack of suf￾ficient reported data. In a technical and comprehensive meta-analysis, researchers con￾cluded that self-managed teams do produce increases in productivity and reductions 
in escape behavior, such as absenteeism, but that these effects varied widely. Higher 
results were associated with high levels of work-group autonomy, supporting changes 
in the reward system, interventions that did not include technological changes, and 
applications outside of the United States.52 Finally, a detailed and comprehensive meta￾analysis of 131 North American field experiments reported that work innovations, 
such as autonomous and semiautonomous work groups, were more likely to have a 
positive impact on financial-performance measures, including costs, productivity, and 
quality, than were behavioral or attitudinal variables.53 Considerable variation in the 
size of the positive effect, however, led the researchers to suggest that organization 
change was risky. Only when other organizational features such as reward systems, 
information systems, and performance appraisal systems changed simultaneously was 
the probability of positive results increased.
Although the majority of studies report positive effects of self-managing groups, 
some research suggests a more mixed assessment. A field experiment studying the 
long-term effects of self-managed groups showed improvements in job satisfaction 
but no effects on job motivation, work performance, organizational commitment, 
mental health, or voluntary turnover.54 The company did lower indirect overhead 
costs, however, by reducing the number of supervisors. This study, which received 
an award from the Academy of Management for quality research, concluded that the 
major benefits of self-managed teams are economic, deriving from the need for less 
supervision. Another study found that the introduction of self-managed teams into an 
independent insurance agency threatened the personal control and autonomy of indi￾vidual employees.55 The groups that were implemented without employee participa￾tion exerted strong pressures to follow rigid procedures. Group leaders focused on the 
concerns of younger, inexperienced employees and ignored older workers’ requests for 
less red tape and more freedom. The older employees felt that the groups undermined 
their individual discretion, autonomy, and initiative. The study concluded that unless 
self-managed teams are implemented and managed properly, individual members’ 
autonomy and motivation can be constrained inadvertently.
DESIGNING WORK FOR TECHNICAL 
AND PERSONAL NEEDS
This chapter has described three approaches to work design: engineering, motivational, 
and sociotechnical. Trade-offs and conflicts among the approaches must be recognized. 
The engineering approach produces traditional jobs and work groups and focuses on effi￾cient performance. It downplays employee needs and emphasizes economic outcomes. 
The motivational approach designs jobs that are stimulating and demanding and highlights 
the importance of employee need satisfaction. Research suggests, however, that increased 
satisfaction may not generate improvements in productivity. Finally, the STS approach 
integrates social and technical aspects, but it may not be practical in all situations.
In this final section, we attempt to integrate the three perspectives by providing a 
contingency framework that suggests that any of the three approaches can be effective 
when applied in the appropriate circumstances. Work design involves creating jobs and 
work groups for high levels of employee satisfaction and productivity. A large body of 
research shows that achieving such results depends on designing work to match specific 
factors operating in the work setting, factors that involve the technology for producing 
goods and services and the personal needs of employees. When work is designed to fit 
or match these factors, it is most likely to be both productive and humanly satisfying.398 PART 4 Technostructural Interventions
The technical and personal factors affecting work-design success provide a con￾tingency framework for choosing among the four different kinds of work designs 
discussed in the chapter: traditional jobs, traditional work groups, enriched jobs, and 
self-managed teams.
Technical Factors
Two key dimensions can affect change on the shop floor: technical interdependence, 
or the extent to which cooperation among workers is required to produce a product or 
service; and technical uncertainty, or the amount of information processing and decision 
making employees must do to complete a task.56 In general, the degree of technical inter￾dependence determines whether work should be designed for individual jobs or for work 
groups. When interdependence is low and there is little need for worker cooperation—
as, for example, in field sales and call centers—work can be designed for individual 
jobs. Conversely, when interdependence is high and employees must cooperate—as 
in production processes like coal mining, assembly lines, and writing software—work 
should be designed for groups composed of people performing interacting tasks.
The second dimension, technical uncertainty, determines whether work should be 
designed for external forms of control, such as supervision, scheduling, or standardization, 
or for worker self-control. When technical uncertainty is low and little information has 
to be processed by employees, work can be designed for external control, such as might 
be found on assembly lines and in other forms of repetitive work. On the other hand, 
when technical uncertainty is high and people must process more information and 
make decisions, work should be designed for high levels of employee self-control, such 
as might be found in professional work and hospital emergency rooms.
Figure 16.4 shows the different types of work designs that are most effective, from 
a purely technical perspective, for different combinations of interdependence and 
uncertainty. In quadrant 1, where technical interdependence and uncertainty are both 
low, such as might be found in call centers, jobs should be designed traditionally with 
Text not available due to copyright restrictionsCHAPTER 16 Work Design 399
limited amounts of employee interaction and self-control. When task interdependence 
is high but uncertainty is low (quadrant 2), such as work occurring on assembly lines, 
work should be designed for traditional work groups in which employee interaction 
is scheduled and self-control is limited. When technical interdependence is low but 
uncertainty is high (quadrant 3), such as in field sales, work should be structured for 
individual jobs with internal forms of control, such as in enriched jobs. Finally, when 
both technical interdependence and uncertainty are high (quadrant 4), such as might 
be found in a continuous-process chemical plant, work should be designed for self￾managed teams in which members have the multiple skills, discretion, and information 
necessary to control their interactions around the shared tasks.
Personal-Need Factors
Most of the research identifying individual differences in work design has focused on 
selected personal traits. Two types of personal needs can influence the kinds of work 
designs that are most effective: social needs, or the desire for significant social relation￾ships; and growth needs, or the desire for personal accomplishment, learning, and 
development.57 In general, the degree of social needs determines whether work should 
be designed for individual jobs or work groups. People with low needs for social rela￾tionships are more likely to be satisfied working on individualized jobs than in interact￾ing groups. Conversely, people with high social needs are more likely to be attracted to 
group forms of work than to individualized forms.
The second individual difference, growth needs, determines whether work designs 
should be routine and repetitive or complex and challenging. People with low growth 
needs generally are not attracted to jobs offering complexity and challenge (that is, 
enriched jobs) but are more satisfied performing routine forms of work that do not 
require high levels of decision making. On the other hand, people with high growth 
needs are satisfied with work offering high levels of discretion, skill variety, and mean￾ingful feedback. Performing enriched jobs allows them to experience personal accom￾plishment and development.
It is often difficult for OD practitioners to accept that some people have low social 
and growth needs, particularly in light of the social and growth values underlying 
much OD practice. It is important to recognize, however, that individual differences do 
exist. Assuming that all people have high growth needs or want high levels of social 
interaction can lead to recommendations for enriched work or self-managed teams 
when they are not warranted.
It is important to emphasize that people who have low growth or social needs are 
not inferior to those placing a higher value on those factors; they simply are different. 
It is necessary also to recognize that people can change their needs through personal 
growth and experience. OD practitioners must be sensitive to individual differences in 
work design and careful not to force their own values on others. Many consultants, 
eager to be seen on the cutting edge of practice, recommend self-managed teams in all 
situations, without careful attention to technological and personal considerations.
Figure 16.5 shows the different types of work designs that are most effective for the 
various combinations of social and growth needs. When employees have relatively 
low social and growth needs (quadrant 1), traditional jobs are most effective. When 
employees have high social needs but low growth needs (quadrant 2), traditional work 
groups, such as might be found on an assembly line, are most appropriate. These allow 
for some social interaction but limited amounts of challenge and discretion. When 
employees have low social needs but high growth needs (quadrant 3), enriched jobs 
are most satisfying. Here, work is designed for individual jobs that have high levels of 
task variety, discretion, and feedback about results. A research scientist’s job is likely 
to be enriched, as is that of a skilled craftsperson. Finally, when employees have high 400 PART 4 Technostructural Interventions
social and growth needs (quadrant 4), work should be designed for self-managed teams 
that offer significant social interaction around complex and challenging tasks. A team 
of astronauts in a space shuttle resembles a self-managed work group, as does a group 
managing the control room of an oil refinery or a group of nurses in a hospital unit.
Meeting Both Technical and Personal Needs
Jointly satisfying technical and human needs to achieve work-design success is likely 
to occur only in limited circumstances. When the technical conditions of a company’s 
production processes (as shown in Figure 16.4) are compatible with the personal needs 
of its employees (as shown in Figure 16.5), the respective work designs combine read￾ily and can satisfy both. On General Motors’ assembly lines, for example, the technol￾ogy is highly interdependent but low in uncertainty (quadrant 2 in Figure 16.4). Much 
of the production is designed around traditional work groups in which task behaviors 
are standardized and interactions among workers are scheduled. Such work is likely 
to be productive and fulfilling to the extent that General Motors’ production workers 
have high social needs and low growth needs (quadrant 2 in Figure 16.5).
When technology and people are incompatible—for example, when an organiza￾tion has quadrant 1 technology and quadrant 4 worker needs—at least two kinds of 
changes can be made to design work that satisfies both requirements.58 One strategy is 
to change technology or people to bring them more into line with each other. This is a 
key point underlying STS approaches. For example, technical interdependence can be 
reduced by breaking long assembly lines into more discrete groups. In Sweden, Volvo 
redesigned the physical layout and technology for assembling automobiles and trucks to 
promote self-managed teams. Modifying people’s needs is more complex and begins by 
matching new or existing workers to available work designs. For example, companies 
can assess workers’ needs through standardized tests and use the information gleaned 
from them to counsel employees and help them locate jobs compatible with their 
Text not available due to copyright restrictionsCHAPTER 16 Work Design 401
needs. Similarly, employees can be allowed to volunteer for specific work designs—a 
common practice in STS projects. This matching process is likely to require high levels 
of trust and cooperation between management and workers, as well as a shared com￾mitment to designing work for high performance and employee satisfaction.
A second strategy for accommodating both technical and human requirements is to 
leave the two components unchanged and create compromise work designs that only par￾tially fulfill the demands of either component. The key issue is to decide to what extent one 
contingency will be satisfied at the expense of the other. For example, when capital costs 
are high relative to labor costs, such as in highly automated plants, work design is likely to 
favor the technology. Conversely, in many service jobs where labor is expensive relative 
to capital, organizations may design work for employee motivation and satisfaction at the 
risk of shortchanging their technology. These examples suggest a range of possible compro￾mises based on different weightings of technical and human demands. Careful assessment 
of both types of contingencies and of the cost–benefit trade-offs is necessary to design an 
appropriate compromise work design.
Clearly, the strategy of designing work to bring technology and people more into 
line with each other is preferable to the compromise work-design strategy. Although 
the latter approach seems necessary when there are heavy constraints on changing 
the contingencies, in many cases those constraints are more imagined than real. The 
important thing is to understand the technical and personal factors existing in a par￾ticular situation and to design work accordingly. Traditional jobs and traditional work 
groups will be successful in certain situations (as shown in Figures 16.4 and 16.5); in 
other settings, enriched jobs and self-managed teams will be more effective.
SUMMARY
In this chapter, we discussed three different approaches to work design and described 
a contingency framework to determine the approach most likely to result in high pro￾ductivity and worker satisfaction. The contingency framework reconciles the strengths 
and weaknesses of each approach. The engineering approach produces traditional jobs 
and traditional work groups. Traditional jobs are highly simplified and involve routine 
and repetitive forms of work, rather than coordination among people to produce a 
product or service. Traditional jobs achieve high productivity and worker satisfaction 
in situations characterized by low technical uncertainty and interdependence and low 
growth and social needs.
Traditional work groups are composed of members who perform routine yet inter￾related tasks. Member interactions are controlled externally, usually by rigid work 
flows, schedules, and supervisors. Traditional work groups are best suited to conditions 
of low technical uncertainty but high technical interdependence. They fit people with 
low growth needs but high social needs.
The motivational approach produces enriched jobs involving high levels of skill 
variety, task identity, task significance, autonomy, and feedback from the work itself. 
Enriched jobs achieve good results when the technology is uncertain but does not 
require high levels of coordination and when employees have high growth needs and 
low social needs.
Finally, the STS approach is associated with self-managed teams. These groups are 
composed of members performing interrelated tasks. Members are given the multiple 
skills, autonomy, and information necessary to control their own task behaviors with 
relatively little external control. Many OD practitioners argue that self-managed teams 
represent the work design of the 2000s because high levels of technical uncertainty 
and interdependence are prevalent in today’s workplaces and because today’s workers 
often have high growth and social needs.402 PART 4 Technostructural Interventions

OVERVIEW
In 1995, the City of Carlsbad, California, an 
oceanfront community of about 75,000 peo￾ple, was emerging from the worst recession in 
its history. In response to a call from the City 
Council and nationwide efforts to operate 
governments in a more businesslike manner, 
the City Manager led the organization through 
a comprehensive strategic planning process. 
Through highly participative methods, includ￾ing focus groups and a large-group community 
visioning process, a new city mission and 
vision (Exhibit 1) and a set of values to guide 
decision making (Exhibit 2) were developed. 
In addition, several important strategic initia￾tives, including a new information system and 
a revised performance appraisal and incentive 
compensation process were started.

Manager’s assessment of the organization’s

design pointed to misalignments in the city’s 
structure. He convened a small representative 
task force of managers to design a new struc￾ture. The result was a reorganization of the 
city into five major service areas (MSAs), such 
as community development, safety services 
(e.g., fire, police), and public works.

effort suggested that a large majority of the

internal and external stakeholders viewed the 
changes positively and believed that they had 
improved customer focus and employee com￾mitment. The results also promised to reduce 
operating costs and to create an organization 
that could absorb the expected growth in 
demand for new and better services.
The Public Works Department
The largest of the new MSAs, Public Works, 
consisted of six previously independent depart￾ments responsible for engineering services; 
parks, streets, facilities, and fleet maintenance; 
and a legally separate water district owned by 
the city (Exhibit 3). The new organization was 
expected to design, construct, and maintain the 
infrastructure for the growing city. The new 
Public Works Director was excited about the 
prospect of designing his new MSA according to 
the vision and values created by the city during 
its strategic change efforts. In line with those 
values, he saw the opportunity to implement 
the new design in participative and empowering 
ways, and he wanted to take advantage of the 
city’s general plan that called for new buildings 
to house the engineering staff and the public 
works yard.
In consultation with an OD consultant, diag￾nostic interviews and focus groups with a 
variety of employees and other stakeholders 
were commissioned. The data can be summa￾rized as follows:
• Each of the previously independent departments 
had their own way of doing things. They were 
suspicious of the reasons for the structural 
change. The water district employees were 
particularly cohesive.
• Many of the work processes in each department 
were similar. For example, the buildings, 
parks, and street departments each had 
equipment and work assignments involv￾ing the maintenance of restrooms, painting, 
landscaping, and light construction. The 
engineering department for the waterdistrict 
was largely redundant with the engineering 
department in the City, and both the City 
and the water district owned several pieces 
of large and expensive equipment.

• Most of the departments lacked formal goals

understand the implications of the data and to 
design an action plan to describe and refine 
the new structure.

Human Resource Management 
InterventionsPerformance Management
In this chapter, we discuss human resources 
management interventions concerned with 
managing individual and group performance. 
Performance management involves goal setting, 
performance appraisal, and reward systems that 
align member work behavior with business 
strategy, employee involvement, and workplace 
technology. Goal setting describes the interac￾tion between managers and employees in jointly 
defining member work behaviors and outcomes. 
Orienting employees to the appropriate kinds of 
work outcomes can reinforce the work designs 
described in Chapter 16 and support the orga￾nization’s strategic objectives. Goal setting can 
clarify the duties and responsibilities associated 
with a particular job or work group. When 
applied to jobs, goal setting can focus on 
individual goals and can reinforce individual 
contributions and work outcomes. When 
applied to work groups, it can be directed at 
group objectives and can reinforce members’ 
joint actions and overall group outcomes. One 
popular and classic approach to goal setting is 
called management by objectives.
Performance appraisal involves collecting 
and disseminating performance data to improve 
work outcomes. It is the primary human resources 
management intervention for providing perfor￾mance feedback to individuals and work groups. 
Performance appraisal is a systematic process 
of jointly assessing work-related achievements, 
strengths, and weaknesses. It also can facilitate 
career counseling, provide information about 
the strength and diversity of human resources in 
the company, and link employee performance 
with rewards.
Reward systems are concerned with elicit￾ing and reinforcing desired behaviors and work 
outcomes through compensation and other forms 
of recognition. They can support goal setting and 
feedback systems by acknowledging the kinds 
of behaviors required to implement a particular 
work design or support a business strategy. Like 
goal setting, reward systems can be oriented to 
individual jobs and goals or to group functions 
and objectives. Moreover, they can be geared 
to traditional work designs that require external 
forms of control or to enriched, self-regulating 
designs that require employee self-control. 
Several innovative and effective reward systems 
are used in organizations today.
Performance management interventions 
traditionally are implemented by the human 
resources department within organizations, 
whose managers have special training in these 
areas. Because of the breadth and depth of 
knowledge required to carry out these kinds 
of change programs successfully, practitioners 
tend to specialize in one part of the human 
resources function, such as performance 
appraisal or compensation.
The interest in integrating human resources 
management with organization development 
continues unabated. In many companies, such as 
AG Communication Systems, BP, Microsoft, Intel, 
Colgate-Palmolive, and Johnson & Johnson, 
organization development is a separate function 
of the human resources department. As OD prac￾titioners increasingly have become involved in 
organization design and employee involvement, 
they have realized the need to bring human 
resources practices more in line with the new 
designs and processes. Consequently, human 
resource specialists now frequently help initiate 
OD projects. For example, a large electronics firm 
expanded the role of compensation specialists 
to include initiation of work-design projects. The 
compensation people at this firm, who tradition￾ally were consulted by OD practitioners after the 
work design had taken place, were dissatisfied

A MODEL OF PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT
Performance management is an integrated process of defining, assessing, and reinforc￾ing employee work behaviors and outcomes.1 Organizations with a well-developed 
performance management process often outperform those without this element of 
organization design.2
 As shown in Figure 17.1, performance management includes 
practices and methods for goal setting, performance appraisal, and reward systems. 
These practices jointly influence the performance of individuals and work groups. 
with this secondary role and wanted to be more 
proactive. In most cases, human resource prac￾titioners continue to specialize in their respec￾tive areas, but they become more sensitive to 
and competent in organization development. 
Similarly, OD practitioners continue to focus on 
planned change while becoming more knowl￾edgeable about human resources management.
We begin by describing a performance 
management model. It shows how goal setting, 
performance appraisal, and rewards are closely 
linked and difficult to separate in practice, but 
how each element is distinct and has its own 
dynamics. Following the model, each aspect of 
performance management is discussed and its 
impact on performance evaluated.

A Performance Management Model
[Figure 17.1]422 PART 5 Human Resource Management Interventions
Goal setting specifies the kinds of performances that are desired; performance 
appraisal assesses those outcomes; reward systems provide the reinforcers to ensure 
that desired outcomes are repeated. Because performance management occurs in a 
larger organizational context, at least three contextual factors determine how these 
practices affect work performance: business strategy, workplace technology, and 
employee involvement.3
 High levels of work performance tend to occur when goal 
setting, performance appraisal, and reward systems are aligned jointly with these 
contextual factors.
Business strategy defines the goals and objectives, policies, and intended relation￾ships between the organization and its environment to compete successfully, and 
performance management focuses, assesses, and reinforces member work behaviors 
toward those objectives and intentions. This ensures that work behaviors are strategi￾cally driven.
Workplace technology affects whether performance management practices should be 
based on the individual or the group. When technology is low in interdependence and 
work is designed for individual jobs, goal setting, performance appraisal, and reward 
systems should be aimed at individual work behaviors. Conversely, when technology 
is highly interdependent and work is designed for groups, performance management 
should be aimed at group behaviors.4
Finally, the level of employee involvement in an organization should determine the 
nature of performance management practices. When organizations are highly bureau￾cratic, with low levels of participation, then goal setting, performance appraisal, and 
reward systems should be formalized and administered by management and staff per￾sonnel. In high-involvement situations, on the other hand, performance management 
should be heavily participative, with both managers and employees setting goals and 
appraising and rewarding performance. In high-involvement organizations, for exam￾ple, employees participate in all stages of performance management, and are heavily 
involved in both designing and administering its practices.
GOAL SETTING
Goal setting involves managers and subordinates in jointly establishing and clarifying 
employee goals. In some cases, such as management by objectives, it also can facili￾tate employee counseling and support. In other cases, such as the balanced scorecard, 
it generates goals in several defined categories, at different organizational levels, to 
establish clear linkages with business strategy.5
 The process of establishing challenging 
goals involves managing the level of participation and goal difficulty. Once goals have 
been established, the way they are measured is an important determinant of member 
performance.6
Goal setting can affect performance in several ways. It influences what people think 
and do by focusing their behavior in the direction of the goals, rather than elsewhere. 
Goals energize behavior, motivating people to put forth the effort to reach difficult 
goals that are accepted, and when goals are difficult but achievable, goal setting 
prompts persistence over time. Goal-setting interventions have been implemented in 
such organizations as 3M, Time Warner, Clear Channel Communications, and Price 
Waterhouse Coopers.
Characteristics of Goal Setting
An impressive amount of research underlies goal-setting interventions and practices;7
 it 
has revealed that goal setting works equally well in both individual and group settings.8
This research has identified two major processes that affect positive outcomes: establish￾ment of challenging goals and clarification of goal measurement.CHAPTER 17 Performance Management 423
Establishing Challenging Goals
The first element of goal setting concerns establishing goals that are perceived as chal￾lenging but realistic and to which there is a high level of commitment. This can be 
accomplished by varying the goal difficulty and the level of employee participation 
in the goal-setting process. Increasing the difficulty of employee goals, also known as 
stretch goals, can increase their perceived challenge and enhance the amount of effort 
expended to achieve them.9
 Thus, more difficult goals tend to lead to increased effort 
and performance, as long as they are seen as feasible. If goals are set too high, however, 
they may lose their motivating potential and employees will give up when they fail 
to achieve them. An important method for increasing the acceptance of a challenging 
goal is to collect benchmarks or best-practice referents. When employees see that other 
people, groups, or organizations have achieved a specified level of performance, they 
are more motivated to achieve that level themselves.
Another aspect of establishing challenging goals is to vary the amount of participation 
in the goal-setting process. Having employees participate can increase motivation and 
performance, but only to the extent that members set higher goals than those typically 
assigned to them. Participation also can convince employees that the goals are achievable 
and can increase their commitment to achieving them.
All three contextual factors play an important role in establishing challenging goals. 
First, there must be a clear “line of sight” between the business strategy goals and the 
goals established for individuals or groups. This is a key strength of the balanced score￾card approach to goal setting. When the group is trying to achieve goals that are not 
aligned with the business strategy, performance can suffer and organization members 
can become frustrated. Second, employee participation in goal setting is more likely 
to be effective if employee involvement policies in the organization support it. Under 
such conditions, participation in goal setting is likely to be seen as legitimate, resulting 
in the desired commitment to challenging goals. Third, when tasks are highly inter￾dependent and work is designed for groups, group-oriented participative goal setting 
tends to increase commitment.10
Clarifying Goal Measurement
The second element in the goal-setting process involves specifying and clarifying the 
goals. When given specific goals, workers perform higher than when they are simply 
told to “do their best” or when they receive no guidance at all. Specific goals reduce 
ambiguity about expectations and focus the search for appropriate behaviors.
To clarify goal measurement, objectives should be operationally defined. For exam￾ple, a group of employees may agree to increase productivity by 5%—a challenging and 
specific goal. But there are a variety of ways to measure productivity, and it is impor￾tant to define the goal operationally to be sure that the measure can be influenced by 
employee or group behaviors. For example, a productivity goal defined by sales per 
employee may be inappropriate for a manufacturing group.
Clarifying goal measurement also requires that employees and supervisors negoti￾ate the resources necessary to achieve the goals—for example, time, equipment, raw 
materials, and access to information. If employees cannot have appropriate resources, 
the targeted goal may have to be revised.
Contextual factors also play an important role in the clarifying process. Goal specifi￾cation and clarity can be difficult in high-technology settings where the work often is 
uncertain and highly interdependent. Increasing employee participation in clarifying 
goal measurement can give employees ownership of a nonspecific but challenging goal. 
Employee involvement policies also can impact the way goals are clarified. The entire 
goal-setting process can be managed by employees and work teams when employee 
involvement policies and work designs favor it. Finally, the process of specifying and 424 PART 5 Human Resource Management Interventions
clarifying goals is extremely difficult if the business strategy is unclear. Under such con￾ditions, attempting to gain consensus on the measurement and importance of goals can 
lead to frustration and resistance to change.
Application Stages
Based on these features of the goal-setting process, OD practitioners have developed 
specific approaches to goal setting. The following steps characterize those applications:
Diagnosis. The first step is a thorough diagnosis of the job or work group, of 
employee needs, and of the three context factors, business strategy, workplace 
technology, and level of employee involvement. This provides information about 
the nature and difficulty of specific goals, the appropriate types and levels of par￾ticipation, and the necessary support systems.
Preparation for Goal Setting. This step prepares managers and employees to engage 
in goal setting, typically by increasing interaction and communication between 
managers and employees, and offering formal training in goal-setting methods. 
Specific action plans for implementing the program also are made at this time.
Setting of Goals. In this step challenging goals are established and methods for goal 
measurement are clarified. Employees participate in the process to the extent that 
contextual factors support such involvement and to the extent that they are likely 
to set higher goals than those assigned by management.
Review. At this final step the goal-setting process is assessed so that modifications 
can be made, if necessary. The goal attributes are evaluated to see whether the 
goals are energizing and challenging and whether they support the business strat￾egy and can be influenced by the employees.
Management by Objectives
A common form of goal setting used in organizations is management by objectives (MBO). 
This method is chiefly an attempt to align personal goals with business strategy by 
increasing communications and shared perceptions between the manager and subordi￾nates, either individually or as a group, and by reconciling conflict where it exists.
All organizations have goals and objectives; all managers have goals and objec￾tives. In many instances, however, those goals are not stated clearly, and managers 
and subordinates have misunderstandings about what those objectives are. MBO is an 
approach to resolving these differences in perceptions and goals. MBO is characterized 
by systematic and periodic manager–subordinate meetings designed to accomplish orga￾nizational goals by joint planning of the work, periodic reviewing of accomplishments, 
and mutual solving of problems that arise in the course of getting the job done.
MBO has its origin in two different backgrounds: organizational and developmental. 
The organizational root of MBO was developed by Drucker, who emphasized that orga￾nizations need to establish objectives in eight key areas: “market standing; innovation; 
productivity; physical and financial resources; profitability; manager performance and 
development; worker performance and attitude; and public responsibility.”11 Drucker’s 
work was expanded by Odiorne, whose first book on MBO stressed the need for quan￾titative measurement.12
According to Levinson,13 MBO’s second root is found in the work of McGregor, 
who stressed the qualitative nature of MBO and its use for development and growth 
on the job.14 McGregor attempted to shift emphasis from identifying weaknesses to 
analyzing performance in order to define strengths and potentials. He believed that this 
shift could be accomplished by having subordinates reach agreement with their bosses 
on major job responsibilities; then, individuals could develop short-term performance 
goals and action plans for achieving those goals, thus allowing them to appraise their 
1.

own performance. Subordinates then would discuss the results of this self-appraisal 
with their supervisors and develop a new set of performance goals and plans. This 
emphasis on mutual understanding and performance rather than personality would 
shift the supervisor’s role from judge to helper, thereby reducing both role conflict 
and ambiguity. The second root of MBO reduces role ambiguity by making goal set￾ting more participative and transactional, by increasing communication between role 
incumbents, and by ensuring that both individual and organizational goals are identi￾fied and achieved.
An MBO program often goes beyond the one-on-one, manager–subordinate rela￾tionship to focus on problem-solving discussions involving work teams as well. Setting 
goals and reviewing individual performance are considered within the larger context 
of the job. In addition to organizational goals, the MBO process gives attention to indi￾viduals’ personal and career goals and tries to make those and the organizational goals 
more complementary. The target-setting procedure allows real (rather than simulated) 
subordinate participation in goal setting, with open, problem-centered discussions 
among team members, supervisors, and subordinates.
There are six basic steps in implementing an MBO process.15
Work-group involvement. In the first step of MBO, the members of the primary 
work group define overall group and individual goals and establish action plans for 
achieving them. If this step is omitted or if organizational goals and strategies are 
unclear, the effectiveness of an MBO approach may be greatly reduced over time.
Joint manager–subordinate goal setting. Once the work group’s overall goals 
and responsibilities have been determined, attention is given to the job duties and 
responsibilities of the individual role incumbents. Roles are carefully examined in 
light of their interdependence with the roles of others outside the work group.
Establishment of action plans for goals. The subordinate develops action plans 
for goal accomplishment, either in a group meeting or in a meeting with the imme￾diate manager. The action plans reflect the individual style of the subordinate, not 
that of the supervisor.
Establishment of criteria, or yardsticks, of success. At this point, the man￾ager and the subordinate agree on the success criteria for the goals that have been 
established—criteria that are not limited to easily measurable or quantifiable data. 
A more important reason for jointly developing the success criteria is to ensure 
that the manager and the subordinate have a common understanding of the task 
and what is expected of the subordinate. Frequently, the parties involved discover 
that they have not reached a mutual understanding. The subordinate and the 
manager may have agreed on a certain task, but in discussing how to measure its 
success, they find that they have not been communicating clearly. Arriving at a 
joint understanding and agreement on success criteria is the most important step 
in the entire MBO process.
Review and recycle. Periodically, the manager reviews work progress, either 
in the larger group or with the subordinate. There are three stages in this review 
process. First, the subordinate takes the lead, reviewing progress and discussing 
achievements and the obstacles faced. Next, the manager discusses work plans 
and objectives for the future. Last, after the action plans have been made, a more 
general discussion covers the subordinate’s future ambitions and other factors of 
concern. In this final phase, a great deal of coaching and counseling usually takes 
place.
Maintenance of records. In many MBO programs, the working documents of 
the goals, criteria, yardsticks, priorities, and due dates are forwarded to a third 
party. Although the evidence is indirect, it is likely that the MBO program, as an 
OD effort, suffers when the working papers are reviewed regularly by a third party,

such as higher management or the personnel department. Experience shows that 
when the working papers routinely are passed on, they are less likely to reflect 
open, honest communication within the supervisor–subordinate pair or the work 
group. Often they represent instead an effort to impress the third party or to com￾ply with institutionalized rules and procedures.
Application 17.1 describes the goal-setting process at Siebel Systems. It shows how 
goal-setting processes can be linked with business strategies and performance appraisal 
processes, and how they both can be supported by the organization’s information 
systems.16
Effects of Goal Setting and MBO
The impact of goal setting has been researched extensively and shown to be a particu￾larly effective OD intervention and a key part of an overall performance management 
process. For example, a study by the Center for Effective Organizations at USC showed 
a strong correlation between perceptions of performance management effectiveness 
and goals that are jointly set by managers and workers and when those goals are tied 
to strategy.17 The research results on MBO generally are positive but less consistent than 
are the findings on goal setting.
Goal setting appears to produce positive results over a wide range of jobs and orga￾nizations.18 It has been tested on data-entry operators, logging crews, clerical work￾ers, engineers, and truck drivers, and it has produced performance improvements of 
between 11% and 27%. Moreover, four meta-analyses of the extensive empirical evi￾dence supporting goal setting concluded that the proposed effects of goal difficulty, goal 
specificity, and participation in goal setting generally are substantiated across studies 
and with both groups and individuals.19 Longitudinal analyses support the conclusion 
that the gains in performance are not short-lived.20 A field study of the goal-setting 
process, however, failed to replicate the typical positive linear relationship between 
goal difficulty and performance, raising some concern about the generalizability of the 
method from the laboratory to practice.21 Additional research has attempted to iden￾tify potential factors moderating the results of goal setting, including task uncertainty, 
amount and quality of planning, personal need for achievement, education, past goal 
successes, and supervisory style.22 Some support has been found for the moderators. 
For example, when the technical context is uncertain, goals tend to be less specific and 
people need to engage in more search behavior to establish meaningful goals.
The existing research on MBO effectiveness is large but mixed.23 However, it suggests 
that a properly designed MBO program can have positive organizational results. Carroll 
and Tosi conducted a long-term study of an MBO program at Black & Decker,24 first 
evaluating the program and then using those data to help the company revise and 
improve it. This resulted in greater use of and satisfaction with the program. The 
researchers concluded that top-management support for MBO is the most important 
factor in implementing such programs. Many programs are short-lived, however, and 
wither on the vine because they have been installed without adequate diagnosis of the 
context factors. In particular, MBO’s focus can be too much on vertical alignment of indi￾vidual and organizational goals and not enough on the horizontal issues that exist when 
tasks or groups are interdependent.
PERFORMANCE APPRAISAL
Performance appraisal is a feedback system that involves the direct evaluation of indi￾vidual or work-group performance by a supervisor, manager, or peers. Most organi￾zations have some kind of evaluation system that is used for performance feedback, 
PART 5 Human Resource Management Interventionsapplication 17.1
The Goal-Setting Process at Siebel Systems
In the late 1990s, Siebel Systems was the leading 
provider of customer relationship management 
(CRM) software. Unlike other large enterprise 
resource system providers, such as PeopleSoft and 
SAP that provided and supported a broad array of 
information systems application, Seibel focused on 
the specialized customer relationship niches. There 
was a general concern among top management 
that the way they managed workforce performance 
was no longer adequate. Despite considerable suc￾cess, they needed a solution that would enable the 
company to consistently execute its strategy across 
all global locations. Tom Siebel was afraid that the 
“strategy execution” gap—the difference between 
what people knew they should do and what they 
were actually doing—was too big.
Leveraging their industry-leading capabilities 
in CRM software, they developed an “employee 
relationship management” (ERM) system called 
“mySiebel.” Deployed in December 2000, it provided 
planning and performance management, training, 
content management, workforce collaboration, and 
employee support. mySiebel streamlined many pro￾cesses within the company, including performance 
evaluation, communication of objectives, and 
expense reporting. Siebel executives credited the 
implementation of mySiebel with a substantial 
improvement in employee satisfaction. Here’s how 
the process worked.
The week after the end of each quarter, the executive 
committee—the top 15 senior managers—spent 
three days (Thursday, Friday, and Saturday) in a 
retreat analyzing the results of the prior quarter and 
establishing objectives for the upcoming months. 
Corporate quarterly objectives were discussed and 
agreed to during the meeting. Then, by the seventh 
calendar day of the month following the off-site 
meeting, Tom Siebel’s personal objectives and those 
of his direct reports were posted on the performance 
management module of mySiebel. By the 15th, 
these objectives had been translated into objectives 
for the functions and business units that reported to 
the VPs and posted on mySiebel. By the 21st of the 
month, every employee had posted and received 
feedback on their individual quarterly objectives. 
The objectives served as the key metrics that would 
be used to evaluate their performance over the next 
three months.
Through mySiebel, all employees could view the 
objectives of any other employee, including those 
of Tom Siebel himself and other members of the 
executive committee. This allowed people to under￾stand how others were allocating their time and 
attention.
Based on Siebel’s core values, customer satisfac￾tion was a shared objective for everyone. There 
was also a clear understating among all employees 
that if some activity was not related to your list of 
objectives, you should not be doing it. Employees 
all the way up to executives were encouraged to 
be clear about what you would NOT be doing.
The individual performance evaluation process 
ran parallel to the objective-setting process. Each 
manager was responsible for evaluating his or her 
direct subordinates by the 15th of the first month 
of each new quarter. The review and feedback 
had to be posted on the mySiebel performance 
management module. But unlike the posting of 
objectives, which were accessible to everyone 
inside the company, performance evaluations 
were visible only to the managers to whom the 
employee reported. Accordingly, only Tom Siebel, 
as CEO, could access everybody’s performance 
evaluations.
Bonuses were tied to the achievement of quar￾terly objectives. For people involved in delivery 
projects, a large part of their objectives and com￾pensation were tied to sales targets and customer 
satisfaction scores. For sales people, part of the 
bonus was held back and paid out over the course 
of a year based on quarterly customer satisfaction 
scores. The salesperson could lose some bonus if 
the implementation suffered. The bonus could be 
as much as 40% of salary and the company was 
heavily involved in stock ownership. Employees 
owned 40% of the company (including the 15% 
that Tom Siebel owned). As part of its workforce 
improvement initiative, and in a policy similar 
to General Electric’s, Siebel Systems had a policy 
of ranking and discharging the bottom 5% of 
employees every six months.
The process of performance management was 
part of and was supported by information system 
architecture. The information system not only 
pushed information to employees but also allowed 428 PART 5 Human Resource Management Interventions
them to pull the information they needed. 
After logging on, each employee had their own 
“home page” that contained a different corpo￾rate announcement or story every day. This 
pushed current communications and corporate 
agenda items to the employee. It also contained 
an area that suggested training opportunities for 
given work and career paths. Each employee was 
expected to complete five Web-based training 
modules per quarter. The system also allowed 
employees to pull corporate data and information, 
detailed information about corporate strategies, 
products, and customer information, performance 
data, and competitor and market information. 
It provided real-time access to any project in

pay administration, and, in some cases, counseling and developing employees.25 Thus, 
performance appraisal represents an important link between goal-setting processes 
and reward systems. One recent survey of over 300 North American companies, for 
example, found that 65% reported a link between performance ratings and rewards, 
46% used the system equally for performance development and decision making, and 
53% of the organizations believed the system was aligned with organizational values 
and priorities.26
Abundant evidence, however, indicates that organizations do a poor job apprais￾ing employees.27 As one study put it, “The appraisal of performance appraisals is not 
good . . . In fact, our review indicates that, regardless of a program’s stated purpose, 
few studies show positive effects.”28 Another study found that only 55% believed 
the appraisal process adequately distinguished between poor, average, and good per￾formers.29 Consequently, a growing number of firms have sought ways to improve 
performance appraisal. Some innovations have been made in enhancing employee 
involvement, balancing organizational and employee needs, and increasing the num￾ber of raters.30 These newer forms of appraisal are being used in such organizations as 
Alliant Energy, Goldman Sachs, Intel, and Monsanto.
The Performance Appraisal Process
Table 17.1 summarizes several common elements of performance appraisal systems.31
For each element, two contrasting features are presented, representing traditional 
bureaucratic approaches and newer, high-involvement approaches. Performance 
appraisals are conducted for a variety of purposes, including affirmative action, pay 
and promotion decisions, and human resources planning and development. Because 
each purpose defines what performances are relevant and how they should be mea￾sured, separate appraisal systems are often used. For example, appraisal methods for 
pay purposes are often different from systems that assess employee development or 
promotability. Employees also have a variety of reasons for wanting appraisal, such 
as receiving feedback for career decisions, getting a raise, and being promoted. Rather 
than trying to meet these multiple purposes with a few standard appraisal systems, the 
new appraisal approaches are more tailored to balance the multiple organizational and 
employee needs. This is accomplished by actively involving the appraisee, coworkers, 
and managers in assessing the purposes of the appraisal at the time it takes place and 
adjusting the process to fit that purpose. Thus, at one time the appraisal process might CHAPTER 17 Performance Management 429
focus on pay decisions, another time on employee development, and still another time 
on employee promotability. Actively involving all relevant participants can increase the 
chances that the purpose of the appraisal will be correctly identified and understood 
and that the appropriate appraisal methods will be applied.
The new methods tend to expand the appraiser role beyond managers to include 
multiple raters, such as the appraisee, peers or coworkers, and direct reports and others 
having direct exposure to the manager’s or employee’s performance. Also known as 360-
degree feedback, this broader approach is used more for member development than for 
compensation purposes.32 This wider involvement provides a number of different views 
of the appraisee’s performance. It can lead to a more comprehensive assessment of the 
employee’s performance and can increase the likelihood that both organizational and 
personal needs will be taken into account. The key task is to form an overarching view 
of the employee’s performance that incorporates all of the different appraisals. Thus, the 
process of working out differences and arriving at an overall assessment is an important 
aspect of the appraisal process. This improves the appraisal’s acceptance, the accuracy of 
the information, and its focus on activities that are critical to the business strategy.
The newer methods also expand the role of the appraisee. Traditionally, the 
employee is simply a receiver of feedback. The supervisor unilaterally completes a 
form concerning performance on predetermined dimensions, usually personality traits, 
such as initiative or concern for quality, and presents its contents to the appraisee. The 
newer approaches actively involve appraisees in all phases of the appraisal process. The 
appraisee joins with superiors and staff personnel in gathering data on performance 
and identifying training needs. This active involvement increases the likelihood that 
the content of the performance appraisal will include the employee’s views, needs, and 
criteria, along with those of the organization. This newer role for employees increases 
their acceptance and understanding of the feedback process.
Performance measurement is typically the source of many problems in appraisal 
because it is seen as subjective. Traditionally, performance evaluation focused on the 
consistent use of prespecified traits or behaviors. To improve consistency and validity 
of measurement, considerable training is used to help raters (supervisors) make valid 
assessments. This concern for validity stems largely from legal tests of performance 
appraisal systems and leads organizations to develop measurement approaches, such as 
the behaviorally anchored rating scale (BARS) and its variants. In newer approaches, valid￾ity is not only a legal or methodological issue but a social issue as well; all appropriate

participants are involved in negotiating acceptable ways of measuring and assessing 
performance. Increased participation in goal setting is a part of this new approach. All 
participants are trained in methods of measuring and assessing performance. Because it 
focuses on both objective and subjective measures of performance, the appraisal process 
is more understood, accepted, and accurate.
The timing of performance appraisals traditionally are fixed by managers or staff 
personnel and are based on administrative criteria, such as yearly pay decisions. Newer 
approaches increase the frequency of feedback. In 1997, 78% of appraisals were per￾formed annually; in 2003, over 40% of companies surveyed conducted appraisals two 
times per year.33 Another study found that 63% of high-growth companies reviewed 
performance more than once per year versus 22% of the low-growth companies.34
Although it may not be practical to increase the number of formal appraisals, the fre￾quency of informal feedback can increase, especially when strategic objectives change 
or when the technology is highly uncertain. In those situations, frequent perfor￾mance feedback is necessary for appropriate adaptations in work behavior. The newer 
approaches to appraisal increase the timeliness of feedback and give employees more 
control over their work.
Application Stages
The process of designing and implementing a performance appraisal system has received 
increasing attention. OD practitioners have recommended the following six steps:35
Select the Right People. For political and legal reasons, the design process needs 
to include human resources staff, legal representatives, senior management, and 
system users. Failure to recognize performance appraisal as part of a complex per￾formance management system is the single most important reason for design prob￾lems. Members representing a variety of functions need to be involved in the design 
process so that the essential strategic and organizational issues are addressed.
Diagnose the Current Situation. A clear picture of the current appraisal process is 
essential to designing a new one. Diagnosis involves assessing the contextual fac￾tors (business strategy, workplace technology, and employee involvement), cur￾rent appraisal practices and satisfaction with them, work design, and the current 
goal-setting and reward system practices. This information is used to define the 
current system’s strengths and weaknesses.
Establish the System’s Purposes and Objectives. The ultimate purpose of an 
appraisal system is to help the organization achieve better performance. Managers, 
staff, and employees can have more specific views about how the appraisal process 
can be used. Potential purposes can include serving as a basis for rewards, career 
planning, human resources planning, and performance improvement or simply 
giving performance feedback.
Design the Performance Appraisal System. Given the agreed-upon purposes of the 
system and the contextual factors, the appropriate elements of an appraisal system 
can be established. These should include choices about who performs the appraisal, 
who is involved in determining performance, how performance is measured, 
and how often feedback is given. Criteria for designing an effective performance 
appraisal system include timeliness, accuracy, acceptance, understanding, focus on 
critical control points, and economic feasibility.
First, the timeliness criterion recognizes the time value of information. 
Individuals and work groups need to get performance information before evalu￾ation or review. When the information precedes performance evaluation, it can 
be used to engage in problem-solving behavior that improves performance and 
satisfaction. Second, the information contained in performance feedback needs to 
be accurate. Inaccurate data prevent employees from determining whether their 
1.

PART 5 Human Resource Management Interventions431
performance is above or below the goal targets and discourage problem-solving 
behavior. Third, the performance feedback must be accepted and owned by the 
people who use it. Participation in the goal-setting process can help to ensure this 
commitment to the performance appraisal system. Fourth, information contained 
in the appraisal system needs to be understood if it is to have problem-solving 
value. Many organizations use training to help employees understand the oper￾ating, financial, and human resources data that will be fed back to them. Fifth, 
appraisal information should focus on critical control points. The information 
received by employees must be aligned with important elements of the business 
strategy, employee performance, and reward system. For example, if the business 
strategy requires cost reduction but workers are measured and rewarded on the 
basis of quality, the performance management system may produce the wrong 
kinds of behavior. Finally, the economic feasibility criterion suggests that an 
appraisal system should meet a simple cost–benefit test. If the costs associated with 
collecting and feeding back performance information exceed the benefits derived 
from using the information, then a simpler system should be installed.
Experiment with Implementation. The complexity and potential problems associ￾ated with performance appraisal processes strongly suggest using a pilot test of the 
new process to spot, gauge, and correct any flaws in the design before it is imple￾mented systemwide.
Evaluate and Monitor the System. Although the experimentation step may have 
uncovered many initial design flaws, ongoing evaluation of the system once it is 
implemented is important. User satisfaction from human resources staff, manager, 
and employee viewpoints is an essential input. In addition, the legal defensibility of 
the system should be tracked by noting the distribution of appraisal scores against 
age, sex, and ethnic categories.
Application 17.2 describes evolution of the performance management system at 
Capital One. It demonstrates the importance of involvement and learning in the pro￾cess, the importance of being responsive to the business situation, and how systems 
can be designed for flexibility.
Effects of Performance Appraisal
Despite the poor track record organizations have in implementing appraisal processes 
well, the research supports the linkage between feedback and performance.36 Early 
studies concluded that objective feedback as a means for improving individual and 
group performance has been “impressively effective” and has been supported by a 
large number of literature reviews over the years.37 Another researcher concluded that 
“objective feedback does not usually work, it virtually always works.”38 In field studies 
where performance feedback contained behavior-specific information, median per￾formance improvements were over 47%; when the feedback concerned less-specific 
information, median performance improvements were over 33%. In a meta-analysis of 
performance appraisal interventions, feedback was found to have a consistently posi￾tive effect across studies.39 In addition, although most appraisal research has focused 
on the relationship between performance and individuals, several studies have demon￾strated a positive relationship between group performance and feedback.40
REWARD SYSTEMS
Organizational rewards are powerful incentives for improving employee and 
work-group performance. As pointed out in Chapter 16, rewards also can produce 
high levels of employee satisfaction. OD traditionally has relied on intrinsic rewards, 
such as enriched jobs and opportunities for decision making, to motivate employee

CHAPTER 17 Performance Managementapplication 17.2
Adapting the Appraisal Process 
at Capital One Financial
Capital One is one of the largest financial services 
organizations in the United States. Its original 
credit card business began in 1993 when they 
were part of Signet Bank, and their success led to 
a spin-off and subsequent public offering in 1994. 
Since then, Capital One has expanded the credit 
card business, entered the auto loan and home 
mortgage businesses, grown internationally, and 
most recently acquired two traditional banks.
Capital One has always had a strong human 
resource management function and the organiza￾tion has done a great job adapting a robust human 
resource strategy to shifting business conditions. 
Carol Anderson, who leads the performance man￾agement process, notes, “One overlay to the whole 
performance management strategy, and one of the 
reasons we’ve had some success in this area, is that 
the actual philosophy and core infrastructure of 
the program has not changed. For example, we’ve 
always had a system that included 360-degree 
feedback and well-grounded compensation mod￾els.” Driven by the business situation and feedback 
about the performance management process, the 
organization has modified the appraisal process, 
the mix of reward components, and the specific 
issues that are appraised. In addition, they have 
learned from their experiences.
One of the early changes in the performance man￾agement system came in 2000. On the business 
front, Capital One was diversifying away from credit 
cards and into other financial services and needed 
to identify and develop talent for the future. The 
organization set up a performance management 
design team who initiated a benchmarking pro￾gram as part of their review and revision process. 
To their surprise, most benchmark companies said, 
“we benchmark you.” That is, most of the organ￾izations they talked to noted that their appraisal 
system was based on the Capital One model. The 
notion of a full and detailed performance review, 
including the 360-degree feedback, was the best in 
class. But the system wasn’t delivering the results 
the organization wanted.
In particular, a relatively young and inexperienced 
group of managers and an ill-defined 7-point rating 
scale resulted in little differentiation in performance 
(e.g., there were a lot of 4, 5, and 6 ratings and very 
few 1, 2, or 3s), poor participation, and the larg￾est proportion of complaints in the all-employee 
surveys. Initial attempts to address the lack of dif￾ferentiation resulted in the announcement that a 
forced distribution system—where a percentage 
of employees had to be in high, medium, and low 
ratings—would be used. It wasn’t a full GE-type 
model where the bottom 10% of the employees 
were let go, but it tried to impress upon manag￾ers the need to differentiate. Given the relative 
maturity of managers at the time and the lack of 
participation in the process, the change got little 
traction; it was poorly executed and had little effect 
on the number or type of complaints. In the con￾text of the growth and diversification in the busi￾ness and the need for talent, this was not the right 
process.
As the design team regrouped, it committed to 
preserving the high feedback culture, competencies 
model, and detailed written performance aspect of 
the model. The organization had always viewed 
performance management as an evaluation oppor￾tunity, and with that as a core, the design team set 
about looking at what could be changed.
One of the shifts they proposed was to lighten 
the administrative load. The team noted that the 
detailed evaluations, ratings, and feedback pro￾cesses were forcing managers to spend about half 
the year in the performance management process. 
They recommended creating a system that would 
provide managers with the tools to manage associ￾ate performance without forcing the distribution. 
That principle led to the decision to automate the 
process, with the automation of the 360-degree 
feedback process leading the way.
The design team also recommended shifting the 
rating scale. Based on employee ratings of com￾petencies and performance, managers computed a 
non-intuitive overall score that was more confusing 
than helpful. For example, although a −4 score 
was interpreted as “meeting expectations,” that’s 
not the way employees felt after receiving it. The 
design team recommended shifting from 7-point 
to a 5-point rating scale and adopting a simple 
interpretation scheme where low scores meant that CHAPTER 17 Performance Management 433
action and development were required and moder￾ate scores reflected strong (but not exceptional) 
performance. Learning from their prior implemen￾tation experiences, these revisions were supported 
by local champions in each business unit. Rather 
than announcing the changes, these local champi￾ons helped managers put the process in place with 
some consistency but not at the expense of driving 
business results.
In the 2003, a new set of business conditions 
resulted in additional adaptations to the system. 
First, changes in the regulations governing stock 
option recognition and expensing led the organi￾zation to shift its eligibility qualifications. In prior 
years, nearly all employees were eligible for salary 
increases, bonuses, and some equity compensa￾tion. With the regulation change, the organization 
tightened the eligibility criteria for equity awards 
for managers as well as the basis for awarding 
stock compensation.
Second, although Capital One maintained everyone’s 
eligibility for bonus compensation, a corporate initia￾tive to clarify the organization’s values led the per￾formance management design team to clarify what 
had always been an assumption in the system—that 
rewards were based on results as well as competence. 
The list of values and behaviors reflecting the corpo￾rate values needed to be integrated with and aligned 
to the existing competency models. Moreover, the 
forecasted business growth and diversification sug￾gested that the organization was going to need 
many new competencies. As a result, the team rec￾ommended specifying and rewarding competency 
development as 50% of the appraisal process, or that 
bonus compensation was tied to equal parts of cur￾rent results and the learning of new competencies. 
Managers’ and associates’ bonuses depended on 
achieving results set during goal-setting meetings as 
well as learning and development activities. Such 
a system supported the development of a flexible 
workforce.
The organization’s recognition that it needed to 
be more flexible and agile drove the first shift in 
organizational-level competencies. The effort to build 
a change capability (see Application 21.3) suggested 
that the competencies models reflect an emphasis 
on learning about and being capable of managing 
change. Based on the success of prior changes in 
the performance management system, formal, local 
champions in the form of senior VPs who repre￾sented their line of business were made a part of the 
design team. This expanded design team increased 
the number of change-related behaviors in the com￾petency models and asked Capital One University 
to highlight them in change-related training. This 
sent a clear message about the importance of these 
behaviors for the future. As a result, between 2003 
and 2005, managers and associates were appraised 
not only on their current business results, but on 
the development of change management skills and 
knowledge. The champions were able to reinforce 
the importance of the new behaviors in the local 
implementation of the performance management 
process and provided important synergies for the 
change capability implementation.
As a result of these changes, Capital One managers 
came to believe that meeting aggressive but achiev￾able goals required them to lead change and build 
new operational capabilities. Achieving results—
50% of their appraisal score—were unlikely unless 
the manager actively drove change in their organ￾izations. The other 50% of the appraisal score 
depended on the extent to which associates and 
managers were demonstrating the values and 
competencies of the corporation related to change. 
As one manager remarked, “if I lead change in the 
group but leave my people behind, I’m not doing 
my job and my bonus is at risk.”
A new strategic imperative around “customer expe￾rience” has driven the most recent shift in the per￾formance appraisal system. Senior managers asked 
Anderson’s design team to ensure that the compe￾tency models, recruitment, selection, and perfor￾mance management systems support the values and 
behaviors leading to outstanding customer experi￾ences. “There’s been a lot of interest in how the 
competencies are structured to reflect our increasing 
interest in customer experience. One camp is advo￾cating for adding a whole new and separate compe￾tency in customer experience that is populated with 
a set of behaviors. Another group is arguing that 
customer experience competencies should be inte￾grated into the existing competencies, that customer 
experience should be as natural to everyone as the 
change-related competencies. As the competencies 
are decided, and in keeping with Capital One’s over￾all performance management philosophy, achieving 
these competencies will continue to be 50% of the 
appraisal rating.
For the other 50% focused on results, executives 
were clear about how to orchestrate the reinforce￾ment process. “We expect that customer experience 
CHAPTER 17 Performance Managementmetrics will be presented to associates during the 
2007 round of appraisals. In the following year, 
objectives around customer experience will be a part 
of associate goal-setting activities, but there won’t be 
any rewards attached to achievement. Then in the 
third cycle, we expect that all associates will be held 
accountable for achievement of customer experi￾ence results.” That is, compensation will be tied to 
the achievement of great customer experiences.
The Capital One performance management system 
has adapted with the times and has addressed a 
variety of issues, including process concerns, busi￾ness needs, and human capital development. Its 
ongoing balance of rewarding results and the devel￾opment of competencies allow Capital One to not 
only adjust the criteria for current performance but 
also encourage associates and managers to learn 
new skills for future success.
434 PART 5 Human Resource Management Interventions
performance. Early quality-of-work-life interventions were based mainly on the 
intrinsic satisfaction derived from performing challenging, meaningful types of work. 
More recently, OD practitioners have expanded their focus to include extrinsic 
rewards: pay; various incentives, such as stock options, bonuses, and gain sharing; 
promotions; and benefits. They have discovered that both intrinsic and extrinsic 
rewards can enhance performance and satisfaction.41
OD practitioners increasingly are attending to the design and implementation of 
reward systems. This recent attention to rewards has derived partly from research in 
organization design and employee involvement. These perspectives treat rewards as an 
integral part of an organization.42 They hold that rewards should be congruent with 
other organizational systems and practices, such as the organization’s structure, top 
management’s human relations philosophy, and work designs. Many reward system 
features contribute to both employee fulfillment and organizational effectiveness. In 
this section, we describe the structural features of a reward system and how rewards 
affect individual and group performance; discuss four specific rewards, including skill￾based pay, performance-based pay, gain sharing, and promotions; and the process 
issues involved in establishing and administrating reward systems.
Structural and Motivational Features of Reward Systems
A reward system is an important part of an organization’s design and must be aligned 
with the strategy, structure, employee involvement, and work. The design features of 
a reward system are summarized in Table 17.2.43
Person/job Based vs. Performance Based. One of the first and most important 
design choices is the focus or basis of the reward system. The most prevalent system 
is the job-based system. Here, job descriptions are created for each position in the 
organization and a value is attached to the work performed. Pay is based on that 
valuation process. More recently, reward systems have been crafted around the per￾son in the job and the value brought by their skills and knowledge. Skill-based pay 
and knowledge-based pay are important examples of this system. The other major 
alternative is to base rewards on the performance achieved by a job or person. In this 
system, pay is contingent on the outcomes produced.
•CHAPTER 17 Performance Management 435
Individual vs. Group Rewards. The interdependency among work tasks is another 
important reward system contingency. When work is complex and the performance 
of one task depends on prior tasks, the appropriate work design is team based 
because successfully adding value requires tight coordination. This tight coordination 
is reinforced by reward systems that recognize group-level outputs. When work tasks 
are independent, individual reward systems incent individual behavior.
Internal and External Equity. Member satisfaction and motivation can be influ￾enced by design features that ensure that the organization’s pay policies are equi￾table or fair. Internal equity involves whether similar rewards are given to people 
holding similar jobs or performing similarly in the organization. Internal inequities 
typically occur when employees are paid a similar salary or hourly wage regardless 
of their position or level of performance. Many organizations work hard to establish 
practices to ensure that people who are doing similar kinds of activities have simi￾lar levels of compensation. External equity involves comparing the organization’s 
rewards with those of other organizations in the same labor market. Most human 
resources policies commit to a reward and compensation system relative to the mar￾ket. Organizations can decide to pay below, at, or above market rates. In their quest 
for attracting and retaining scarce human resource talent, many organizations have 
had to commit to above-market pay schemes. When an organization’s reward level 
does not compare favorably with the level of other organizations, employees are 
likely to feel inequitably rewarded and may leave.
Hierarchy. Although not often a formal policy, many organizations offer different 
types of rewards based on a position’s level in the organization structure. The recent 
concerns over CEO pay reflect the increasing prevalence of hierarchical reward 
systems.44 In hierarchical systems, senior managers have access to a variety of per￾quisites, such as reserved parking, corporate transportation, financial aid, or health 
benefits that others do not.
Rewards Mix. This design feature involves specifying the extent to which differ￾ent types of rewards are included in the overall reward strategy. These rewards

can include pay in various forms, including base salary, bonuses, commissions, and 
stock; benefits, such as health care, insurance, child care, leaves, and education; and 
perquisites, including preferred office space, cell phones, cars, or health club mem￾berships. Recent changes in the laws governing the expensing of stock options are 
changing the way stock is viewed as part of the rewards mix. In addition, although 
pay receives most of the attention in reward systems, the contribution of other 
rewards, such as benefit programs and status incentives, should not be underes￾timated. For example, rising health care costs and increasing interest in retaining 
important skills and competencies have resulted in a variety of benefit innovations 
to increase the value of this reward.45
Security. Organizations, such as IBM and AT&T, once offered organization members 
lifetime employment as a formal policy. Today, the rapid expansion and contraction 
of markets and the realities of downsizing have dramatically altered the psychologi￾cal employment contract. Instead of job security, a more instrumental relationship 
has emerged. However, organizations can and do make commitments to people and 
job security and this remains an important feature of reward systems.
Seniority. Many reward systems include an implicit or explicit policy concerning 
the value of longevity. Organizations, especially unionized companies covered by a 
collective bargaining agreement, often have built-in rewards for increasing lengths 
of service.
The structural features of a reward system represent important design choices avail￾able to human resources and other senior managers. These features interact with work 
design and employee involvement practices to produce goal-directed behavior and 
task performance. Considerable research has been done on how different rewards and 
reward system features affect individual and group performance. The most popular 
model describing this relationship is value expectancy theory. In addition to explaining 
how performance and rewards are related, it suggests requirements for designing and 
evaluating reward systems.
The value expectancy model46 posits that employees will expend effort to achieve 
performance goals that they believe will lead to outcomes that they value. This effort 
will result in the desired performance goals if the goals are realistic, if employees 
fully understand what is expected of them, and if they have the necessary skills and 
resources. Ongoing motivation depends on the extent to which attaining the desired 
performance goals actually results in valued outcomes. Consequently, key objectives 
of reward systems interventions are to identify the intrinsic and extrinsic outcomes 
(rewards) that are highly valued and to link them to the achievement of desired per￾formance goals.
Based on value expectancy theory, the ability of rewards to motivate desired behav￾ior depends on these five factors:47
Availability. For rewards to reinforce desired performance, they must be not only 
desired but also available. Too little of a desired reward is no reward at all. For 
example, pay increases are often highly desired but unavailable. Moreover, pay 
increases that are below minimally accepted standards may actually produce nega￾tive consequences.48
Timeliness. Like effective performance feedback, rewards should be given in a 
timely manner. A reward’s motivating potential is reduced to the extent that it is 
separated in time from the performance it is intended to reinforce.
Performance contingency. Rewards should be closely linked with particular per￾formances. If the goal is met, the reward is given; if the target is missed, the reward 
is reduced or not given. The clearer the linkage between performance and rewards, 
the better able rewards are to motivate desired behavior. Unfortunately, this crite-

rion often is neglected in practice. Many, if not most, employees nationwide believe 
that there is no linkage between pay and performance.49 If salary increases are con￾centrated at certain levels, almost everyone, regardless of performance level, will get 
about the same raise.
Durability. Some rewards last longer than others. Intrinsic rewards, such as 
increased autonomy and pride in workmanship, tend to last longer than extrinsic 
rewards. Most people who have received a salary increase realize that it gets spent 
rather quickly.
Visibility. To leverage a reward system, it must be visible. Organization members 
must be able to see who is getting the rewards. Visible rewards, such as placement 
on a high-status project, promotion to a new job, and increased authority, send sig￾nals to employees that rewards are available, timely, and performance contingent.
Reward systems interventions are used to elicit and maintain desired levels of perfor￾mance. To the extent that rewards are available, durable, timely, visible, and perfor￾mance contingent, they can support and reinforce organizational goals, work designs, 
and employee involvement. The next sections describe four types of rewards. Skill￾based pay, pay for performance, gain sharing, and promotions can be used to reward 
individual, team, or organization performance. Each system represents a flexible inter￾vention that is effective in improving employee performance and satisfaction.
Skill- and Knowledge-Based Pay Systems
The most traditional reward system is individual and job based. The characteristics of 
a particular job are determined, and pay is made comparable to what other organiza￾tions pay for jobs with similar characteristics. Pay increases are primarily a function 
of cost-of-living adjustments (COLA) or small merit pools that are awarded with little 
relationship to performance. This job evaluation and reward method tends to result 
in pay systems with high external and internal equity. However, it fails to reward 
employees for all of the skills that they have, discourages people from learning new 
skills, and results in a view of pay as an entitlement.50
Some organizations, such as General Mills, United Technologies, Frito-Lay, Procter 
and Gamble, and General Foods, have worked to resolve these problems by designing 
pay systems according to people’s skills and abilities. A recent survey found that almost 
24% of the Fortune 1000 use skill- or knowledge-based pay to at least some extent.51
By focusing on the individual, rather than the job, skill-based pay systems reward 
learning and growth.
Skill-based pay systems must first establish the skills needed for effective operations, 
identify the optimal skill profile and number of employees needed with each skill, 
price each skill and skill set, develop rules to sequence and acquire skills, and develop 
methods to measure member skill acquisition.52 Typically, employees are paid accord￾ing to the number of different jobs that they can perform. For example, in General 
Mill’s Squeeze-It plant, new employees were paid a starting wage at the low end of 
the skilled worker wage rate for premium employers in the community. They are then 
assigned to any one of four skill blocks corresponding to a particular set of activities in 
the production process. For each skill block there are three levels of skill. Pay is based 
on the level of skill in each of the skill blocks; the more proficient the skill in each block 
and the more blocks one is proficient at, the higher the pay. After all skill blocks are 
learned at the highest level, the top rate is given.53 This progression in skills typically 
takes two years to complete, and employees are given support and training to learn 
the new jobs.
Skill-based pay systems have a number of benefits. They contribute to organizational 
effectiveness by providing a more flexible workforce and by giving employees a broad 
4.

perspective on how the entire plant operates. This flexibility can result in leaner staffing 
and fewer problems with absenteeism, turnover, and work disruptions. Skill-based pay 
can lead to durable employee satisfaction by reinforcing individual development and by 
producing an equitable wage rate.54
The three major drawbacks of skill-based pay schemes are the tendency to “top 
out,” the expense, and the lack of performance contingency. Top-out occurs when 
employees learn all the skills there are to learn and then run up against the top end of 
the pay scale, with no higher levels to attain. Some organizations have resolved this 
topping-out effect by installing a gain-sharing plan after most employees have learned 
all relevant jobs. Gain sharing, discussed later in this section, ties pay to organizational 
effectiveness, allowing employees to push beyond previous pay ceilings. Other orga￾nizations have resolved this effect by making base skills obsolete and adding new 
ones, thus raising the standards of employee competence. Skill-based pay systems 
also require a heavy investment in training, as well as a measurement system capable 
of indicating when employees have learned the new jobs. These systems typically 
increase direct labor costs, as employees are paid highly for learning multiple tasks. In 
addition, because pay is based on skill and not performance, the workforce could be 
highly paid and flexible but not productive.
Like most new personnel practices, limited evaluative research exists on the effec￾tiveness of these interventions. Long-term assessment of the Gaines Pet Food plant 
revealed that the skill-based pay plan contributed to both organizational effectiveness 
and employee satisfaction. Several years after the plant opened, workers’ attitudes 
toward pay were significantly more positive than those of people working in other simi￾lar plants that did not have skill-based pay. Gaines workers reported much higher levels 
of pay satisfaction, as well as feelings that their pay system was fairly administered.55
A national survey of skill-based pay plans sponsored by the U.S. Department of 
Labor concluded that such systems increase workforce flexibility, employee growth 
and development, and product quality and quantity while reducing staffing needs, 
absenteeism, and turnover.56 These results appear contingent on management com￾mitment to the plan and having the right kind of people, particularly those with inter￾personal skills, motivation, and a desire for growth and development. This study also 
showed that skill-based pay is applicable across a variety of situations, including both 
manufacturing and service industries, production and staff employees, new and old 
sites, and unionized and nonunionized settings. Finally, in a 1996 survey of Fortune 
1000 companies, 42% indicated that skill-based pay systems were successful or very 
successful, down from 52% in 1993.57
Performance-Based Pay Systems
In addition to person- or job-based reward systems, organizations have devised many 
ways of linking pay to performance,58 making it the fastest-growing and most popu￾lar segment of pay-based reward systems. Studies suggest that 60–70% of businesses 
have some form of performance-based or variable pay system.59 They are used in such 
organizations as American Express, Frito-Lay, and DOW. Pay-for-performance plans 
tend to vary along three dimensions: (1) the organizational unit by which performance 
is measured for reward purposes—an individual, group, or organization basis; (2) the 
way performance is measured—the subjective measures used in supervisors’ ratings or 
objective measures of productivity, costs, or profits; and (3) what rewards are given for 
good performance—salary increases, stock, or cash bonuses. Table 17.3 lists different 
types of performance-based pay systems varying along these dimensions and rates them 
in terms of other relevant criteria.
In terms of linking pay to performance, individual pay plans are rated highest, fol￾lowed by group plans and then organization plans. The last two plans score lower on CHAPTER 17 Performance Management 439
this factor because pay is not a direct function of individual behavior. At the group and 
organization levels, an individual’s pay is influenced by the behavior of others and by 
external market conditions. Generally, stock and bonus plans tie pay to performance 
better than do salary plans. The amount of awarded stock may vary sharply from year 
to year, whereas salary increases tend to be more stable because organizations seldom 
cut employees’ salaries. Finally, objective measures of performance score higher than 
subjective measures. Objective measures, such as profit or costs, are more credible, and 
people are more likely to see the link between pay and objective measures.
Most of the pay plans in Table 17.3 do not produce negative side effects, such as 
workers falsifying data and restricting performance. The major exceptions are indi￾vidual bonus plans. These plans, such as piece-rate systems, tend to result in negative 
effects, particularly when trust in the plan is low. For example, if people feel that piece￾rate quotas are unfair, they may hide work improvements for fear that quotas may be 
adjusted higher.
As might be expected, group- and organization-based pay plans encourage coopera￾tion among workers more than do individual plans. Under the former, it is generally to 
everyone’s advantage to work well together because all share in the financial rewards 
of higher performance. The organization plans also tend to promote cooperation among 
functional departments. Because members from different departments feel that they 
Text not available due to copyright restrictions440 PART 5 Human Resource Management Interventions
can benefit from each other’s performance, they encourage and help each other make 
positive contributions.
From an employee’s perspective, Table 17.3 suggests that the least acceptable pay 
plans are individual bonus programs. Employees tend to dislike such plans because they 
encourage competition among individuals and because they are difficult to administer 
fairly. Such plans may be inappropriate in some technical contexts. For example, tech￾nical innovations typically lead engineers to adjust piece-rate quotas upward because 
employees should be able to produce more with the same effort. Workers, on the other 
hand, often feel that the performance worth of such innovations does not equal the 
incremental change in quotas, thus resulting in feelings of pay inequity. Table 17.3 
suggests that employees tend to favor salary increases to bonuses. This follows from 
the simple fact that a salary increase becomes a permanent part of a person’s pay, but 
a bonus does not.
The overall ratings in Table 17.3 suggest that no one pay-for-performance plan scores 
highest on all criteria. Rather, each plan has certain strengths and weaknesses that 
depend on a variety of contingencies. As business strategies, organization performance, 
and other contingencies change, the pay-for-performance system also must change. 
At Lincoln Electric, a longtime proponent and model for incentive pay, growth into 
international markets, poor managerial decisions, and other factors have put pressure 
on the bonus plan. In one instance, a poor acquisition decision hurt earnings and left 
the organization short of cash for the bonus payout. The organization borrowed money 
rather than risk losing employees’ trust. Financially weakened by the acquisition, and 
in combination with the other changes, Lincoln Electric has initiated a planned change 
effort to examine its pay-for-performance process and recommend a new approach.60
When all criteria are taken into account, however, the best performance-based pay 
systems seem to be group and organization bonus plans that are based on objective 
measures of performance and individual salary-increase plans. These plans are rela￾tively good at linking pay to performance. They have few negative side effects and at 
least modest employee acceptance. The group and organization plans promote coop￾eration and should be used where there is high task interdependence among workers, 
such as might be found on assembly lines. The individual plan promotes competition 
and should be used where there is little required cooperation among employees, such 
as in field sales jobs.
Gain-Sharing Systems
As the name implies, gain sharing involves paying employees a bonus based on improve￾ments in the operating results of an organization. Although not traditionally associated 
with employee involvement, gain sharing increasingly has been included in comprehen￾sive employee involvement projects. Many organizations, such as Nucor, Weyerhaeuser, 
and 3M, are discovering that when designed correctly, gain-sharing plans can contribute 
to employee motivation, involvement, and performance.
Developing a gain-sharing plan requires making choices about the following design 
elements:61
Process of design. The success of a gain-sharing system depends on employee 
acceptance and cooperation. Recommended is a participative approach that involves 
a cross section of employees to design the plan and be trained in gain-sharing con￾cepts and practice. The task force should include people who are credible and rep￾resent both management and nonmanagement interests.
Organizational unit covered. The size of the unit included in the plan can vary 
widely, from departments or plants with less than 50 employees to companies 
with several thousand people. A plan covering the entire plant would be ideal in 
•
•CHAPTER 17 Performance Management 441
situations where there is a freestanding plant with good performance measures 
and an employee size of less than 500. When the number of employees exceeds 
500, multiple plans may be installed, each covering a relatively discrete part of the 
company.
Bonus formula. Gain-sharing plans are based on a formula that generates a bonus 
pool, which is divided among those covered by the plan. Although most plans are 
custom-designed, there are two general considerations about the nature of the bonus 
formula. First, a standard of performance must be developed that can be used as a 
baseline for calculating improvements or losses. Some plans use past performance 
to form a historical standard, whereas others use engineered or estimated standards. 
When available, historical data provide a relatively fair standard of performance; 
engineer-determined data can work, however, if there is a high level of trust in the 
standard and how it is set. Second, the costs included in arriving at the bonus must 
be chosen. The key is to focus on those costs that are most controllable by employees. 
Some plans use labor costs as a proportion of total sales; others include a wider range 
of controllable costs, such as those for materials and utilities.
Sharing process. Once the bonus formula is determined, it is necessary to decide 
how to share gains when they are obtained. This decision includes choices about 
what percentage of the bonus pool should go to the company and what percentage to 
employees. In general, the company should take a percentage low enough to ensure 
that the plan generates a realistic bonus for employees. Other decisions about divid￾ing the bonus pool include who will share in the bonus and how the money will be 
divided among employees. Typically, all employees included in the organizational 
unit covered by the plan share in the bonus. Most plans divide the money on the basis 
of a straight percentage of total salary payments.
Frequency of bonus. Most plans calculate a bonus monthly. This typically fits with 
organizational recording needs and is frequent enough to spur employee motivation. 
Longer payout periods generally are used in seasonal businesses or where there is a 
long production or billing cycle for a product or service.
Change management. Organizational changes, such as new technology and prod￾uct mixes, can disrupt the bonus formula. Many plans include a steering committee 
to review the plan and to make necessary adjustments, especially in light of signifi￾cant organizational changes.
The participative system. Many gain-sharing plans include a participative system 
that helps to gather, assess, and implement employee suggestions and improve￾ments. These systems generally include a procedure for formalizing suggestions and 
different levels of committees for assessing and implementing them.
Although gain-sharing plans are tailored to each situation, three major plans are used 
most often: the Scanlon plan, the Rucker plan, and Improshare. The most popular pro￾gram is the Scanlon plan, and was pioneered in such firms as Donnelly Corporation, De 
Soto, Midland-Ross, and Dana Corporation. The incentive part of the Scanlon plan gen￾erally includes a bonus formula based on a ratio measure comparing total sales volume 
to total payroll expenses. This measure of labor cost efficiency is relatively responsive to 
employee behaviors and is used to construct a historical base rate at the beginning of the 
plan. Savings resulting from improvements over this base make up the bonus pool. The 
bonus is often split equally between the company and the employees, with all members 
of the organization receiving bonuses of a percentage of their salaries. The Rucker plan 
and Improshare use different bonus formulas and place less emphasis on worker partici￾pation than does the Scanlon plan.62
More recently, goal-sharing plans have also emerged. Like gain sharing, goal- sharing 
plans pay bonuses when performance exceeds a standard, but differ in that goal￾sharing plans are not based on historical and well-understood performance measures. 
•
•
•
•
•442 PART 5 Human Resource Management Interventions
Rather, goal-sharing plans use changing strategic objectives as the primary standard of 
performance. Thus, goal sharing is a more flexible reward system than gain sharing.
Gain-sharing plans tie the goals of workers to the organization’s goals. It is to the 
financial advantage of employees to work harder, to cooperate with each other, to 
make suggestions, and to implement improvements. Reviews of the empirical litera￾ture and individual studies suggest that when such plans are implemented properly, 
organizations can expect specific improvements.63 A study sponsored by the General 
Accounting Office found that plans in place for more than five years averaged annual 
savings of 29% in labor costs;64 there also is evidence to suggest that they work in 
50% to 80% of the reported cases.65 A report on four case studies in manufacturing 
and service settings noted significant increases in productivity (32% in manufacturing 
and 11% in services), as well as in several other measures.66 A longitudinal field study 
employing experimental and control groups supports gain sharing’s positive effect over 
time and even after the group’s bonus is discontinued.67 Other reported results include 
enhanced coordination and teamwork; cost savings; acceptance of technical, market, 
and methods changes; demands for better planning and more efficient management; 
new ideas as well as effort; reductions in overtime; more flexible union–management 
relations; and greater employee satisfaction.68
Gain-sharing plans are better suited to certain situations than to others, and 
Table 17.4 lists conditions favoring such plans. In general, gain sharing seems suited 
to small organizations with a good market, simple measures of historical performance, 
and production costs controllable by employees. Product and market demand should 
be relatively stable, and employee–management relations should be open and based on 
trust. Top management should support the plan, and support services should be willing 
and able to respond to increased demands. The workforce should be interested in and 
knowledgeable about gain sharing and should be technically proficient in its tasks.
Application 17.3 describes the reward system at Lands’ End Direct Merchants.69
It describes a variety of reward system design features as well as how a number of differ￾ent types of rewards can be mixed together to produce an overall reward system.
Promotion Systems
Like decisions about pay increases, many decisions about promotions and job move￾ments in organizations are made in a top-down, closed manner: Higher-level managers 
decide whether lower-level employees will be promoted. This process can be secre￾tive, with people often not knowing that a position is open, that they are being con￾sidered for promotion, or the reasons why some people are promoted but others are 
not. Without such information, capable people who might be interested in a new job 
may be overlooked. Furthermore, because employees may fail to see the connection 
between good performance and promotions, the motivational potential of promotions 
is reduced. Finally, emphasizing promotions as a reward focuses attention on advance￾ment instead of developing new skills and knowledge and can lead to reduced flex￾ibility in the workforce.
Fortunately, this is changing. Most organizations today have tried to reduce the 
secrecy surrounding promotions and job changes by openly posting the availability of 
new jobs and inviting people to nominate themselves.70 Although open job posting 
entails extra administrative costs, it can lead to better promotion decisions. Open post￾ing increases the pool of available personnel by ensuring that interested people will be 
considered for new jobs and that capable people will be identified. Open posting also 
can increase employee motivation by showing that a valued reward is available and 
contingent on performance.
Some organizations have increased the accuracy and equity of job-change decisions 
by including peers and subordinates in the decision-making process. Peer and sub￾ordinate judgments about a person’s performance and promotability help bring all 443
relevant data to bear on promotion decisions. Such participation can increase the 
accuracy of these decisions and can make people feel that the basis for promotions 
is equitable. In many self-regulating work teams, for example, the group interviews 
and helps select new members and supervisors. This helps ensure that new people 
will fit in and that the group is committed to making that happen. Evidence from 
high-involvement plants suggests that participation in selecting new members can 
lead to greater group cohesiveness and task effectiveness.71
Reward-System Process Issues
Thus far, we have discussed different reward systems and assessed their strengths and 
weaknesses. Considerable research has been conducted on the process aspect of reward 
systems. Process refers to how pay and other rewards typically are administered in the 
organization. At least two process issues affect employees’ perceptions of the reward

Revising the Reward System
at Lands’ End
Lands’ End Direct Merchants is an international 
catalog retailer employing a seasonal workforce 
that varies between 5,500 and 8,500 full- and 
part-time staff. It is widely recognized as one of 
the best companies to work for as a result of its 
participative culture, employment practices, and 
rewards. The company operates through a simple 
belief in employees “doing the right thing.” This 
philosophy has helped to make the company an 
employer of choice.
The organization has been proactively rethinking 
and implementing specific aspects of its reward sys￾tem over a four-year period to help Lands’ End stay 
ahead of other companies. The reward system is a 
mix of competitive pay, innovative benefits, work–
life initiatives, and a variety of internal opportunities 
that encourage organization members to progress.
The firm’s reward strategy is guided by principles 
such as maintaining direct and clear communica￾tion channels regarding any aspect of employment 
practice; encouraging the free exchange of infor￾mation, ideas, and suggestions; and where possible, 
eliminating any causes and conditions that lead to 
inequities, complaints, or employee dissatisfaction. 
For example, an employee job-evaluation commit￾tee annually reviews and analyzes pay rates in dif￾ferent organizations and industries. This task force, 
composed of a variety of employees, then assigns 
specific wage levels to work positions. As a result, 
rates are perceived as fair by individuals while 
Lands’ End itself learns more about how to value 
jobs and work based on predefined factors such as 
knowledge, skills, environment, and responsibility.
In the area of pay, one of the key changes has 
been a shift from rewarding a job population to 
rewarding the person. For example, under the old 
reward system, all salaried people used to receive 
a cash bonus based on sales volume and profits 
for the entire company. Now, each job is assigned 
an annual-incentive-plan target expressed as a 
percentage of base salary. Payouts on the plan are 
dependent on actual pretax profit performance 
of the whole company and the business-units￾against-performance goals established each year by 
the board. Individual bonuses are based 50% on 
business-unit performance and 50% on corporate 
performance, thus linking individual effort to both 
local and organizational results.
In addition to the above changes in the pay system, 
the organization is piloting a gain-sharing-style 
bonus plan designed by a departmental task force 
for a small, 20-person unit. It is being progres￾sively deployed across the operations organization. 
Five operations departments have so far designed 
plans to link people’s effort and knowledge to 
business-unit results—in both cost and quality 
terms. Each operations department has its own 
performance measures. For example, employees 
in the order-filling department are measured on a 
cost-per-piece and quality basis. These changes are 
being made to introduce group- or departmental￾level performance rewards in addition to individual 
pay and annual-incentive-plan bonuses.
An individual reward system for the large hourly 
workforce supplements the bonus system. The 
in-puts to the system are the employee job-evalua￾tion committee’s assignment of wage grades to jobs. 
Each grade has a minimum and maximum hourly 
rate, with six steps in between. Full- and part-time 
employees can progress through these six steps and 
increase their pay by completing a required num￾ber of hours in the job and satisfactorily meeting 
four generic performance standards that are spe￾cifically interpreted for each job and function. The 
four performance standards are as follows:
• Service: helpfulness and support for customers 
and colleagues
• Quality: how well the job is done
• Quantity: a measure of individual productivity
• Reliability: a measure of dependability.
These four performance standards are reviewed 
during performance reviews with immediate 
supervisors throughout the year. An individual’s 
ratings are based on achieving jointly set personal 
goals that are tied to
• The four performance standards
• Job responsibilities and competencies
• Personal aspirations
• Business-unit objectives
• The spirit of Lands’ End principles of doing 
business.CHAPTER 17 Performance Management 445
Pay increases within a grade are given auto￾matically until the maximum within grade rate 
is achieved. Then annual company increases only 
are received until the employee enters a new 
grade. The system is based on giving credit for 
hours worked in each grade, although individu￾als can be promoted to a higher grade and begin 
the process again. Hourly employees can also 
receive an annual performance bonus based on 
annual-incentive-plan computations that is typi￾cally between 2% and 4% of earnings.
Lands’ End is also attempting to repackage work￾life benefits to suit individual preferences, and so 
get greater value from its significant investments 
in this area. The main elements of the work–life 
benefits are as follows:
• Plans for health care and additional retirement 
health care
• Child-care leave, summer camps, and provi￾sion of an on-site day-care center
• Health promotion and sports facilities
• A range of time-off-with-pay schemes, for mat￾ters ranging from family member illness to child 
adoption
• Employee-assistance programs to support life 
changes or crises
• Flexible working hours
• Education opportunities with financial support
• Job share and a six-week “try a job” work￾experience scheme
• An emergency fund to help employees who 
suffer loss because of fire, tornado, or flood.
Lands’ End also offers between $35 and $1,000 
to employees who recommend people who 
subsequently come to work for the company. 
More than half of job applicants from outside the 
company are usually referrals.
The guiding principle in Lands’ End’s thinking to 
pay the person rather than a given job population, 
repackage incentives and not reinvent them, and 
manage individuals rather than the compensation 
plan or system itself for best results has been 
simplicity. Through the reward system revision 
process, the organization has learned the impor￾tance of (1) involving and educating leaders and 
top managers to gain the confidence of business 
partners; (2) clearly stating the business case; 
(3) listening to others and inviting feedback on the 
basis of engagement and respect; (4) continually 
challenging yourself to stay abreast of new devel￾opments or options that are emerging in the areas 
of compensation and benefits; and (5) achieving a 
level of change with which people feel comfortable 
to encourage participation in ongoing dialogue.
system: who should be involved in designing and administering the reward system, 
and what kind of communication should exist with respect to rewards.72
Traditionally, reward systems are designed by top managers and compensation spe￾cialists and are simply imposed on employees. Although this top-down process may 
result in a consistent system, it cannot ensure that employees will understand and trust 
it, and more often than not, it results in a system that does not improve performance. 
In the absence of trust, workers are more likely to develop negative perceptions of the 
reward system. There is growing evidence that employee participation in the design 
and administration of a reward system can increase employee understanding and can 
contribute to feelings of control over and commitment to the plan. In fact, research 
supports that when managers “own” the performance management process and see it 
as a way to manage workforce performance, there are more positive attitudes toward 
the overall system as well as improved performance. In contrast, there is no relation￾ship between attitudes about the system and the extent to which human resources 
“owns” the process.73446 PART 5 Human Resource Management Interventions
Lawler and Jenkins described a small manufacturing plant where a committee 
of workers and managers designed a pay system, after studying alternative plans 
and collecting salary survey data.74 This resulted in a plan that gave control over 
salaries to members of work groups. Team members behaved responsibly in setting 
wage rates. They gave themselves 8% raises, which fell at the 50th percentile in 
the local labor market. Moreover, the results of a survey administered six months 
after the start of the new pay plan showed significant improvements in turnover, 
job satisfaction, and satisfaction with pay and its administration. Lawler attrib￾uted these improvements to employees having greater information about the pay 
system. Participation led to employee ownership of the plan and feelings that it was 
fair and trustworthy.
Communication about reward systems also can have a powerful impact on employee 
perceptions of pay equity and on motivation. Most organizations maintain secrecy 
about pay rates, especially in the managerial ranks. Managers typically argue that 
secrecy is preferred by employees. It also gives managers freedom in administering pay 
because they do not have to defend their judgments. There is evidence to suggest, how￾ever, that pay secrecy can lead to dissatisfaction with pay and to reduced motivation. 
Dissatisfaction derives mainly from people’s misperceptions about their pay relative to 
the pay of others. Research shows that managers tend to overestimate the pay of peers 
and of people below them in the organization and that they tend to underestimate the 
pay of superiors. These misperceptions contribute to dissatisfaction with pay because 
regardless of a manager’s pay level, it will seem small in comparison to the perceived 
pay level of subordinates and peers. Perhaps worse, potential promotions will appear 
less valuable than they actually are.
Secrecy can reduce motivation by obscuring the relationship between pay and per￾formance. For organizations having a performance-based pay plan, secrecy prevents 
employees from testing whether the organization is actually paying for performance; 
employees come to mistrust the pay system, fearing that the company has something 
to hide. Secrecy can also reduce the beneficial impact of accurate performance feed￾back. Pay provides people with feedback about how they are performing in relation 
to some standard. Because managers overestimate the pay of peers and subordinates, 
they will consider their own pay low and thus perceive performance feedback more 
negatively than it really is. Such misperceptions about performance discourage those 
managers who are actually performing effectively.
Fortunately, more organizations are openning up their pay information. A recent 
study of Fortune 1000 companies found that 61% had some form of open pay policy 
covering at least a quarter of the workforce.75 For organizations having a history of 
secrecy, initial steps toward an open reward system should be modest. For example, an 
organization could release information on pay ranges and median salaries for different 
jobs. Organizations with unions generally publish such data for lower-level jobs, and 
extending that information to all jobs would not be difficult. Once organizations have 
established higher levels of trust about pay, they might publicize information about 
the size of raises and who receives them. Finally, as organizations become more demo￾cratic, with high levels of trust among managers and workers, they can push toward 
complete openness about all forms of rewards.
It is important to emphasize that both the amount of participation in designing 
reward systems and the amount of frankness in communicating about rewards should 
fit the rest of the organization design and managerial philosophy. Clearly, high levels 
of participation and openness are congruent with democratic organizations. It is ques￾tionable whether authoritarian organizations would tolerate either one.CHAPTER 17 Performance Management 447
SUMMARY
This chapter presented three types of human resources management interventions: 
goal setting, performance appraisal, and reward systems. Although all three change 
programs are relatively new to organization development, they offer powerful methods 
for managing employee and work-group performance. They also help enhance worker 
satisfaction and support work design, business strategy, and employee involvement 
practices.
Principles contributing to the success of goal setting include establishing challenging 
goals and clarifying measurement. These are accomplished by setting difficult but fea￾sible goals, managing participation in the goal-setting process, and being sure that the 
goals can be measured and influenced by the employee or work group. The most com￾mon form of goal setting—management by objectives—depends on top-management 
support and participative planning to be effective.
Performance appraisals represent an important link between goal setting and 
reward systems. As part of an organization’s feedback and control system, they provide 
employees and work groups with information they can use to improve work outcomes. 
Appraisals are becoming more participative and developmental. An increasing number 
of people are involved in collecting performance data, evaluating an employee’s perfor￾mance, and determining how the appraisee can improve.
Reward systems interventions elicit, reinforce, and maintain desired performance. 
They can be oriented to individual jobs, work groups, or organizations and affect both 
performance and employee well-being. In addition to traditional job-based compensa￾tion systems, the major reward systems interventions in use today are skill-based pay, 
pay for performance, gain sharing, and promotions. Each of the plans has strengths 
and weaknesses when measured against criteria of performance contingency, equity, 
availability, timeliness, durability, and visibility. The critical process of implementing 
a reward system involves decisions about who should be involved in designing and 
administering it and how much information about pay should be communicated.

PART 5 Human Resource Management InterventionsDeveloping Talent
This is the second chapter on human resource 
management interventions. It presents three 
interventions concerned with managing talent 
in organizations. First, coaching interventions 
attempt to improve an individual’s ability to set 
and meet goals, lead change, improve interper￾sonal relations, handle conflict, or address style 
issues. These resource-intense interventions 
focus on the skills, knowledge, and capabilities 
of an organization member, usually a manager 
or executive but in the case of mentoring can 
also apply to individual contributors. Second, 
career planning and development interventions 
address different professional needs and con￾cerns as members progress through their 
work lives. Third, management and leadership 
development processes are human resource 
interventions that attempt to transfer know￾ledge and skills to many individuals. They can 
include in-house training programs, external 
educational opportunities, action-learning proj￾ects, and other activities. In the following chapter, 
we present interventions that address workforce 
diversity, stress, and employee wellness.
COACHING AND MENTORING
Coaching involves working with organizational members, typically managers and 
executives, on a regular basis to help them clarify their goals, deal with potential 
stumbling blocks, and improve their performance. This intervention is highly 
personal and generally involves a one-on-one relationship between the OD prac￾titioner and the client. Almost every OD intervention involves some coaching. 
However, the intervention described here helps managers to gain perspective on 
their dilemmas and transfer their learning into organizational results; it increases 
their leadership skill and effectiveness.1
Similar to coaching, mentoring involves establishing a relationship between a 
manager or someone more experienced and another organization member who 
is less experienced. Unlike coaching, mentoring is often more directive, with 
the mentor intentionally transferring specific knowledge and skill and guiding 
the client’s activities, perhaps as part of a career development process (see 
career planning and development processes in the next section).2
Coaching can be seen as a specialized form of OD, one that is focused on 
using the principles of applied behavioral science to increase the capacity 
and effectiveness of individuals as opposed to groups or organizations. It is 
one of the fastest-growing areas of OD practice. The International Coach 
Federation (http://www.coachfederation.org), founded in 1995, grew to over 
5,500 members in 2002 and doubled to over 11,000 members in 2006. 
CoachVille (http://www.coachville.com), the largest professional network and 
trainer of coaches worldwide, has over 30,000 members. They both offer coaching 
certification programs and standards to professionalize the field.
Coaching is itself a skill that any OD practitioner or manager can develop.3
 It 
involves using guided inquiry, active listening, reframing, and other techniques to help 
individuals see new or different possibilities and to direct their efforts toward what
18452 PART 5 Human Resource Management Interventions
matters most to them. When done well, coaching improves personal productivity and 
builds capacity in individuals to lead more effectively. Unfortunately, despite growing 
professionalism in the coaching field, the process can be technique driven, especially 
when formulas, tools, and advice are substituted for experience, good judgment, facili￾tation, and compassion.
What Are the Goals?
Coaching typically addresses one or more of the following goals: assisting an executive 
to more effectively execute some transition, such as a merger integration or downsiz￾ing; addressing a performance problem; or developing new behavioral skills as part of 
a leadership development program. In any case, coaching is often confused with ther￾apy.4
 Most coaching approaches acknowledge that coaching is not therapy. While both 
coaching and therapy focus on personal development, coaching assumes that the client 
is healthy rather than suffering from some pathology. Coaching is also primarily future 
and action oriented rather than focused on the past, as are many therapeutic models. 
Coaching involves helping clients understand how their behaviors are contributing to 
the current situation. Such understanding is often difficult to achieve and often deeply 
personal. Therefore, the limits of a coach’s skills and abilities must be acknowledged. 
Many coaching failures have been attributed to working too far from the practical 
application of behavioral principles, or too close to the boundaries of therapy, and to 
the failure of the coach to understand the difference.
Application Stages
The coaching process closely follows the process of planned change outlined in Chapter 
2, including entry and contracting, assessment, debriefing (feedback), action plan￾ning, intervention, and assessment.5 The mentoring process is similar except that the 
assessment is generally presumed and the process moves straight to action planning 
interventions.
Establish the principles of the relationship. The initial phases of a coaching 
intervention involve establishing the goals of the engagement; the parameters of 
the relationship, such as schedules, resources, and compensation; and ethical con￾siderations, such as confidentiality and boundary issues.
Conduct an assessment. This process can be personal or systemic. In a personal 
assessment, the client is guided through an assessment framework.6
 It can involve 
a set of interview questions that elicit development opportunities or a more formal 
personal-style instrument, such as the Myers–Briggs Type Indicator, the FIRO-B, or 
DISC profile. Other instruments, including the Hogan’s battery of tests, the Minnesota 
Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI), or the “Big 5” instrument, can also be 
used, but they require extensive training and certification. OD practitioners should 
carefully consider the ethics of using different instruments and their qualifications 
for administering and interpreting the results. In a systemic assessment, the client’s 
team, peers, and relevant others are engaged in the process. The most common 
form of systemic assessment involves a 360-degree feedback process.
Debrief the results. The coach and client review the assessment data and agree 
on a diagnosis. The principles of data feedback outlined in Chapter 8 apply here. 
The purpose of the feedback session is to get the client to move to action. In light 
of the assessment data, intervention goals can be further refined and revised if 
necessary.
Develop an action plan. The specific activities the client and coach will engage 
in are outlined. These can include new actions that will lead to goal achievement, 
learning opportunities that build knowledge and skill, or projects to demonstrate 
1.

competence. Developing an action plan can be the most difficult part of the process 
because the client must own the results of the assessment and begin to see new 
possibilities for action. The action plan should also include methods and milestones 
to monitor progress and to evaluate the effectiveness of the coaching process.
Implement the action plan. In addition to the elements of the action plan listed 
above, much of the coaching process involves one-on-one meetings between the 
coach and the client. In these sessions, the coach supports and encourages the 
client to act on her/his intentions. A considerable amount of skill is required to 
confront, challenge, and facilitate learning.
Assess the results. At appropriate intervals, the coach and client review and 
evaluate the results of implementation. Based on this information, the goals or 
action plans can be revised, or the process can be terminated.
The Results of Coaching and Mentoring
Although coaching has been practiced for many years, the number of studies assess￾ing its effectiveness is small but growing. Most of the evidence remains anecdotal 
and case based although a few large sample studies have been conducted.7
 The case 
evidence cites diverse benefits depending on the nature of the client’s objectives. For 
example, one study found that coaching improved personal productivity, quality, 
working relationships, and job satisfaction. The return was estimated to be 5.7 times 
the initial investment.8
 Another study reported that managers found positive results 
with respect to their personal lives, social interactions with others, and the skills and 
knowledge that were important to their work.9
In one of the few experimental studies, a pre–post test design in a government 
organization found that the experimental group receiving coaching made significant 
improvements compared to the control group on two of six measures. The experi￾mental group improved significantly with respect to “acting in a balanced way” and in 
beliefs about their ability to set goals. The relatively weak coaching intervention, last￾ing only four months and consisting of only one to eight meetings, may explain the 
lack of more robust results during that time period.10 Clearly, more rigorous studies are 
necessary to judge the effectiveness of coaching interventions.
The modest research on mentoring suggests that it is relatively prevalent in organiza￾tions. About two-thirds of top executives report having a mentor or sponsor during their 
early career stages, when learning, growth, and advancement were most prominent. 
Effective mentors were willing to share knowledge and experience, were knowledge￾able about the company and the use of power, and were good counselors. Mentored 
executives, in contrast to executives who did not have mentors, received slightly more 
compensation, had more advanced college degrees, had engaged in career planning 
prior to mentoring, and were more satisfied with their careers and their work.11
Research also shows that mentoring is critical for minority and female employees. 
One recent study of mentoring minorities stresses that a strong network of mentors 
is critical to advancement, and that the mentor of minorities must understand the 
challenges that race presents to career development and advancement.12 Similarly, 
women face unique challenges, and must address some of the same issues.
CAREER PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT INTERVENTIONS
Organizations are becoming more and more reliant on their “intellectual capital.” The 
war for talent, the changing nature of the workforce, shifting social expectations about 
work and family, and increasingly knowledge-based strategies have pressured organi￾zations to rethink their role in managing careers and developing their human capital.13
Providing career planning and development opportunities as well as management and 
5.

leadership development programs help to recruit and retain skilled and knowledgeable 
workers. Many talented job candidates, especially minorities and women, are showing 
preference and more loyalty for employers who offer career and leadership develop￾ment opportunities.
Career planning and development interventions are an important tool in developing 
and retaining an effective workforce. Growing numbers of managers and professional 
staff are seeking more control over their work lives. Organization members, especially 
women, minorities, mid-career workers, and new college recruits, are not willing to 
have their careers “just happen” and are taking an active role in planning and manag￾ing them.14 For example, a study by the Hay Group found that technology professionals 
were willing to leave their jobs for better career development opportunities.15
Many organizations—General Electric, Xerox, Intel, Ciba-Geigy, Cisco Systems, 
Quaker Oats, and Novotel UK, among others—have adapted their career planning 
and development programs to meet the needs of their members. These programs have 
attempted to improve the quality of work life for managers and professionals, enhance 
their performance, increase employee retention, and respond to equal employment 
and affirmative action legislation. Companies have discovered that organizational 
growth and effectiveness require career development programs to ensure that needed 
talent will be available. Competent managers are often the scarcest resource. Many 
companies also have experienced the high costs of turnover among recent college grad￾uates, including MBAs; the turnover can reach 50% after five years. Career planning 
and development help attract and hold such highly talented people and can increase 
the chances that their skills and knowledge will be used.
What Are the Goals?
Career planning and development interventions provide the appropriate resources, 
tools, and processes necessary to help organization members plan and attain their 
career objectives. A career consists of a sequence of work-related positions occupied by 
a person during the course of a lifetime.16 Career planning is concerned with individu￾als choosing jobs, occupations, and organizations at each stage of their careers. Career 
development involves helping employees attain career objectives.17 Although both of 
these interventions generally are aimed at managerial and professional employees, a 
growing number of programs are including lower-level employees, particularly those 
in white-collar jobs.
Research suggests that employees progress through at least four distinct career 
stages as they mature and gain experience. Each stage has unique concerns, needs, 
and challenges.
The establishment stage (ages 21–26). This phase is the outset of a career when 
people are generally uncertain and may be stressed about their competence and 
potential. They are dependent on others, especially bosses and more experienced 
employees, for guidance, support, and feedback. At this stage, people are making 
initial choices about committing themselves to a specific career, organization, and 
job. They are exploring possibilities while learning about their own capabilities.
The advancement stage (ages 26–40). During this phase, employees become 
independent contributors who are concerned with achieving and advancing in 
their chosen careers. They have typically learned to perform autonomously and 
need less guidance from bosses and closer ties with colleagues. This settling-down 
period also is characterized by attempts to clarify the range of long-term career 
options.
The maintenance stage (ages 40–60). This phase involves leveling off and hold￾ing on to career successes. Many people at this stage have achieved their greatest 
1.
2.
3.CHAPTER 18 Developing Talent 455
advancements and are now concerned with helping less-experienced subordinates. 
For those who are dissatisfied with their career progress, this period can be con￾flictual and depressing, as characterized by the term “midlife crisis.” People often 
reappraise their circumstances, search for alternatives, and redirect their career 
efforts. Success in these endeavors can lead to continuing growth, whereas failure 
can lead to early decline.
The withdrawal stage (age 60 and above). This final stage is concerned with 
leaving a career. It involves letting go of organizational attachments and getting 
ready for greater leisure time and retirement. The employee’s major contributions 
are imparting knowledge and experience to others. For those people who are gen￾erally satisfied with their careers, this period can result in feelings of fulfillment 
and a willingness to leave the career behind.
The different career stages represent a broad developmental perspective on people’s 
jobs. They provide insight into the personal and career issues that people are likely to 
face at different career phases. These issues can be potential sources of stress because 
employees are likely to go through the phases at different rates, and to experience 
personal and career issues differently at each stage. For example, one person may 
experience the maintenance stage as a positive opportunity to develop less-experi￾enced employees; another person may experience the maintenance stage as a stressful 
leveling off of career success.
Application Stages
The two primary applications steps are establishing a mechanism for career planning 
and assembling an appropriate set of career development processes.
Establish a Career Planning Mechanism Career planning involves setting individual 
career objectives. It is highly personalized and generally includes assessing one’s inter￾ests, capabilities, values, and goals; examining alternative careers; making decisions that 
may affect the current job; and planning how to progress in the desired direction. This 
process results in people choosing jobs, occupations, and organizations. It determines, 
for example, whether individuals will accept or decline promotions and transfers and 
whether they will stay with or leave the company for another job or for retirement.
Individual responsibility for careers and career planning has increased significantly, 
and recent estimates project that an individual career beginning now will involve an 
average of eight major job and/or organization changes. The U.S. Department of Labor 
estimates that the average annual turnover in an organization is 20%. Such turnover 
rates are not confined to the United States. Turnover among professional employees 
in China was over 18% in 2006.18 Further, as organizations downsize and restructure, 
there is less trust in the organization to provide job security. In the past, when employ￾ees more frequently spent their entire career in one organization, careers were judged 
in terms of advancement and promotion upward in the organ izational hierarchy. Today, 
they are defined in more holistic ways to include a person’s attitudes, experiences, and 
ability to perform. For example, individuals may make numerous job changes to acquire 
additional responsibilities, skills, and knowledge within or across organizations, or they 
can remain in the same job, acquiring and developing new skills, and have a success￾ful career. Similarly, people may move horizontally through a series of jobs in different 
functional areas of the firm. Although they may not be promoted upward in the hier￾archy, their broadened job experiences constitute a successful career.
The four career stages can be used to make career planning more effective. Table 18.1 
shows the different career stages and the career planning issues relevant at each phase. 
Applying the table to a particular employee involves first diagnosing the person’s 
existing career stage—establishment, advancement, maintenance, or withdrawal. Next, 
4.456 PART 5 Human Resource Management Interventions
available career planning resources are used to help the employee address pertinent 
issues. Career planning programs include some or all of the following resources:
Communication about career opportunities and resources available to employees 
within the organization
Workshops to encourage employees to assess their interests, abilities, and job situa￾tions and to formulate career development plans
Career counseling by managers or human resources personnel
Self-development materials, such as books, videotapes, and other media, directed 
toward identifying life and career issues
Assessment programs that provide various tests of vocational interests, aptitudes, 
and abilities relevant to setting career goals.
According to Table 18.1, the company should provide members in the establishment 
stage with considerable communication and counseling about available career paths 
and the skills and abilities needed to progress in them. Workshops, self-development 
materials, and assessment techniques should be aimed at helping employees assess 
their interests, aptitudes, and capabilities and at linking that information to possible 
careers and jobs. Considerable attention should be directed to giving employees con￾tinual feedback about job performance and to counseling them about how to improve 
it. The supervisor–subordinate relationship is especially important for these feedback 
and development activities.
In the advancement stage, organizations should provide members with communica￾tion and counseling about challenging assignments and possibilities for more exposure 
and demonstration of skills. This communication and counseling should help clarify 
the range of possible long-term career options and provide members with some idea 
about where they stand in achieving them. Workshops, developmental materials, and 
assessment methods should be aimed at helping employees develop wider collegial

relationships, join with effective mentors and sponsors, and develop more creativity 
and innovation. These activities also should help people assess both career and per￾sonal life spheres and integrate them more successfully.
At the maintenance stage, the firm should provide individuals with communica￾tions about the broader organization and how their desires and roles might fit into it. 
Workshops, developmental materials, counseling, and assessment techniques should 
be aimed at helping employees to assess and develop skills to train and coach others.
Organizations should provide members in the withdrawal stage with communica￾tions and counseling about options for post-retirement work and financial security, 
and it should convey the message that the employee’s experience in the organization 
is still valued. Retirement planning workshops and materials can help employees gain 
the skills and information necessary to make a successful transition from work to non￾work life. They can prepare people to shift their attention away from the organization 
to other interests and activities.19
Effective career planning and development requires a comprehensive program inte￾grating both corporate business objectives and employee career needs. As shown in 
Figure 18.1, this is accomplished through human resources planning aimed at devel￾oping and maintaining a workforce to meet business objectives. It includes recruiting 
new talent, matching people to jobs, helping them develop careers and perform effec￾tively, and preparing them for satisfactory retirement. Career planning activities feed 
into and support career development and human resources planning activities.
Assemble an Appropriate Set of Career Development Processes Career develop￾ment interventions help individuals achieve their career objectives. Career development 
follows closely from career planning and includes organizational practices that help 
employees implement those plans. Career development can be integrated with people’s 
career needs by linking it to different career stages. As described earlier, employees 
progress through distinct career stages, each with unique issues relevant to career 
planning: establishment, advancement, maintenance, and withdrawal. Career develop￾ment interventions help members implement these plans. Table 18.2 identifies career 
development interventions, lists the career stages to which they are most relevant, and 
defines their key purposes and intended outcomes. It shows that career development 
practices may apply to one or more career stages and that many interventions double as 
both career development processes and interventions in their own right. Performance 
management, for example, is relevant to all stages, but especially in establishment 
and advancement stages, and is an important independent intervention (Chapter 17). 
Career development interventions also can contribute to different organizational out￾comes such as lowering turnover and costs and enhancing member satisfaction.
Career development interventions traditionally have been applied to younger 
employees who have a longer time period to contribute to the firm than do older 
members. Managers often stereotype older employees as being less creative, alert, and 
productive than younger workers and consequently provide them with less career 
development support. However, the aging of the workforce has focused new attention 
on older workers, including a focus on the pace and organization of work, physical 
and psychological factors, and ergonomic factors.20 Table 18.2 suggests that the OD 
field has kept pace with these trends: six of the eight interventions presented there 
apply to the withdrawal stage. This emphasis is likely to remain as the U.S. workforce 
continues to gray. To sustain a highly committed and motivated workforce, organi￾zations increasingly will have to address the career needs of older employees. They 
will have to recognize and reward the contributions that older workers make to the 
company. Workforce diversity interventions, discussed in the next chapter, are a posi￾tive step in that direction.
We present eight interventions that can be mixed and matched to meet the needs of 
a diverse workforce, including realistic job previews, assessment centers, job rotation 458 PART 5 Human Resource Management Interventions
and challenging assignments, consultative roles and mentoring, performance manage￾ment, developmental training, work–life balance, and phased retirement.
Realistic Job Preview. This intervention provides applicants with credible expectations 
about the job during the recruitment process. It provides recruits with information 
about whether the job is likely to be consistent with their needs and career plans. 
Knowledge resulting from realistic job previews can be especially useful during the 
establishment stage, when people are most in need of full and balanced information 
about organizations and jobs. It also can help employees during the advancement 
stage, when job changes are likely to occur because of promotion. Research suggests 
that people may develop unrealistic expectations about the organization and job. They 
can suffer from “reality shock” when those expectations are not fulfilled and may leave 
the organization or stay and become disgruntled and unmotivated. To overcome these 
problems, organizations such as Texas Instruments, Prudential Insurance, and Johnson 
& Johnson provide new recruits with information about both the positive and the nega￾tive aspects of the company and the job. They furnish recruits with booklets, talks, and 
site visits showing what organizational life is really like. Such information reduces the 
chances that employees will develop unrealistic job expectations, become disgruntled, 
and leave the company, especially when their tenure is viewed over the long term.21

Assessment Centers. This intervention was traditionally designed to help organizations 
select and develop employees with high potential for managerial jobs. More recently, 
assessment centers have been extended to career development and to selection of 
people to fit new work designs, such as self-managing teams.22 Assessment centers can 460 PART 5 Human Resource Management Interventions
be designed and operated “in house,” but are often contracted out to consulting firms 
that specialize in selection and assessment psychology.
When used to evaluate managerial capability, assessment centers typically process 
12–15 people at a time and require them to spend two to three days on site. Participants 
are given a comprehensive interview, take several tests of mental ability and knowl￾edge, and participate in individual and group exercises intended to simulate managerial 
work. An assessment team consisting of experienced managers and human resources 
specialists observes the behaviors and performance of each candidate. This team arrives 
at an overall assessment of each participant’s managerial potential, including a rating 
on several items believed to be relevant to managerial success in the organization, and 
pass the results to management for use in making promotion decisions.
Assessment centers have been applied to career development as well, where the 
emphasis is on feedback of results to participants. Trained staff help participants hear and 
understand feedback about their strong and weak points. They help participants become 
clearer about career advancement and identify training experiences and job assignments 
to promote that progress. When used for developmental purposes, assessment centers 
can provide employees with the support and direction needed for career development. 
They can demonstrate that the company is a partner rather than an adversary in that 
process. Although assessment centers can help people’s careers at all stages of develop￾ment, they seem particularly useful at the advancement stage, when employees need to 
assess their talents and capabilities in light of long-term career commitments.
Job Rotation and Challenging Assignments. The purpose of these interventions is to 
provide employees with the experience and visibility needed for career advancement 
or with the challenge needed to revitalize a stagnant career at the maintenance stage. 
A more formalized approach to job rotation is called job pathing or career ladders, which 
specify a sequence of jobs to reach a career objective, although the notion of a job path 
in the new economy is being challenged.23 Job rotation and challenging assignments 
are less planned and may not be as oriented to promotion opportunities. Job rotation 
during the establishment and advancement stages help members develop new skills, 
knowledge, and competencies in new jobs. Organization members in the advancement 
stage may be moved into new job areas after they have demonstrated competence in 
a particular work specialty. Research suggests that employees who receive challeng￾ing job assignments early in their careers do better in later jobs.24 Companies such as 
Corning, Hewlett-Packard, American Crystal Sugar Company, and Fidelity Investments 
identify “comers” (managers under 40 with potential for assuming top management 
positions) and “hipos” (high-potential candidates) and provide them with cross￾divisional job experiences during the advancement stage. These job transfers provide 
managers with a broader range of skills and knowledge as well as opportunities to 
display their managerial talent to a wider audience of corporate executives. Such 
exposure helps the organization identify members who are capable of handling senior 
executive responsibilities; it helps the members decide whether to seek promotion to 
higher positions or to particular departments. Retaining “hipos” is seen as critical to 
success in today’s highly competitive labor market.25 To reduce the risk of transferring 
employees across divisions or functions, some firms create “fallback positions.” These 
jobs are identified before the transfer, and employees are guaranteed that they can 
return to them without negative consequences if the transfers or promotions do not 
work out. Fallback positions reduce the risk that employees in the advancement stage 
will become trapped in a new job assignment that is neither challenging nor highly 
visible in the company.
In the maintenance stage, challenging assignments or job pathing can help revitalize 
veteran employees by providing them with new challenges and opportunities for 
learning and contribution. Research on enriched jobs suggests that people are most 
responsive to them during the first one to three years on a job, when enriched jobs CHAPTER 18 Developing Talent 461
are likely to be seen as challenging and motivating.26 People who have leveled off and 
remain on enriched jobs for three years or more tend to become unresponsive to them, 
and may no longer be motivated and satisfied by enriched jobs. One way to prevent 
this loss of job motivation—especially among mid-career employees who are likely to 
remain on jobs for longer periods of time than are people in the establishment and 
advancement phases—is to rotate workers to new, more challenging jobs at about 
three-year intervals, or to redesign their jobs at those times. Such job changes would 
keep employees responsive to challenging jobs and sustain motivation and satisfaction 
during the maintenance phase.27
Consultative Roles. This role involves opportunities to apply wisdom and knowledge 
to help others develop in their careers and solve organizational problems, and is most 
frequently offered to employees in the maintenance and withdrawal stages. Such 
roles, which can be structured around specific projects or problems, involve offering 
advice and expertise to those responsible for resolving the issues, thus increasing the 
organization’s problem-solving abilities. For example, a large aluminum-forging manu￾facturer was having problems developing accurate estimates of the cost of producing 
new products. The sales and estimating departments lacked the production experience 
to make accurate bids for potential new business, thus either losing customers or los￾ing money on products. The company temporarily assigned an old-line production 
manager who was nearing retirement to consult with the salespeople and estimators 
about bidding on new business. The consultant applied his years of forging experience 
to help the sales and estimating people make more accurate estimates. In about a year, 
the sales staff and estimators gained the skills and invaluable knowledge necessary to 
make more accurate bids. Perhaps equally important, the pre-retirement production 
manager felt that he had made a significant contribution to the company—something 
he had not experienced for years.
In contrast to coaching and mentoring, consultative roles are not necessarily focused 
directly on guiding or sponsoring younger employees’ careers. They are directed at 
helping others deal with complex problems or projects. Similarly, in contrast to mana￾gerial positions, consultative roles do not include the performance evaluation and 
control inherent in being a manager. They are based more on wisdom and experience 
than on authority. Consequently, consultative roles provide an effective transition 
for moving pre-retirement managers into more support-staff positions. They free up 
managerial positions for younger employees while allowing older managers to apply 
their experience and skills in a more supportive and less threatening way than might 
be possible from a strictly managerial role.
Developmental Training. Training and development interventions are among the old￾est strategies for organizational change.28 They provide new or existing organ ization 
members with the skills and knowledge they need to perform work. The focus of train￾ing interventions has broadened from classroom methods aimed at hourly workers 
to varied methods, including simulations, action learning, computer-based or online 
training, and case studies, intended for all levels and types of organization members.
Training and development is a large practice area with growing importance in organ￾izations. The American Society of Training and Development (ASTD) (http://www.
astd.org), the largest professional organization, has over 70,000 members worldwide. 
According to its most recent state-of-the-industry report, U.S. companies spent about 
$109 billion on learning and development in 2005,29 more than doubling the amount 
spent in 2000.30 Training and development represents an important organization 
investment accounting for about 2% of a company’s payroll.
This intervention is applicable to all career stages and helps employees gain the 
skills and knowledge for successfully fulfilling current job responsibilities. It may 
include workshops and training materials oriented to communications or supervising 
others as well as technical aspects of work. It can also involve substantial investments 462 PART 5 Human Resource Management Interventions
in education, such as tuition reimbursement programs that assist members in achiev￾ing advanced degrees. Developmental training interventions generally are aimed at 
increasing the organization’s reservoir of skills and knowledge, and can be related to 
increased retention and performance.31 This enhances its capability to implement per￾sonal and organizational strategies.
Performance Management. One of the most effective interventions during the estab￾lishment and advancement phases is the integration of performance management 
systems with career development conversations. As suggested in the discussions of 
goal setting and performance appraisal interventions (Chapter 17), employees need 
continual feedback about goal achievement as well as the necessary support to improve 
their performances. Feedback and support, in the form of coaching, developmental 
training, or management development (described below), are particularly relevant 
when employees are establishing careers. They will have concerns about how to per￾form the work, whether they are performing up to expectations, and whether they 
are gaining the necessary skills for advancement. A manager can facilitate career 
establishment by providing feedback on performance and on-the-job training. These 
activities can help employees get the job done while meeting their career development 
needs. Companies such as Intel and Monsanto, for example, are effective at integrating 
performance management processes with employee career development. They sepa￾rate the career development aspect of performance appraisal from the salary review 
component, thus ensuring that employees’ career needs receive as much attention as 
salary issues. Feedback and support interventions can increase employee performance, 
satisfaction, and morale, and provide a systematic way to monitor the development of 
human resources in the firm, at little or no cost.32
Work–Life Balance Interventions. This OD intervention helps employees better inte￾grate and balance work and home life. Restructuring, downsizing, and increased global 
competition have contributed to longer work hours and more stress. Generation X’ers 
and baby-boomers approaching the withdrawal career stage are rethinking their priori￾ties and seeking to restore some balance in a work- dominated life. Organizations from 
a variety of industries—such as grocers Wegmans and Whole Foods, The Container 
Store in retailing, and Methodist Health Systems in health care, which topped Fortune’s 
2007 “100 Best Companies to Work For”—are responding to these concerns so they 
can attract, retain, and motivate the best workforce.33 In addition, many cities, such 
as Boston, San Francisco, Denver, and Birmingham, are identifying and publishing a 
“Best Companies” list.34
Early work–life balance programs started with a focus on women with young chil￾dren in the workforce, but now these programs serve men and women, all ages, and 
all family and life situations. Work–life programs continue to not only focus on depen￾dent care of both children and elders, but also focus on job scheduling and flexibility, 
paid and unpaid leaves, employee wellness, concierge services, and others. Work–life 
balance planning helps members better manage the interface between work or paid 
employment and all the work and responsibilities associated with a person’s life.
Although these interventions can apply to all career stages, they are especially rel￾evant during advancement. This is because of the increased number of dual-career 
households. Transfer to another location—a common occurrence during the advance￾ment stage—usually means that the working partner must also relocate. In many 
cases, the company employing the partner must either lose the employee or arrange 
a transfer to the same location. Dual careers also affect expatriate assignments, and 
being able to facilitate or accommodate a spouse or partner’s wish to work may make 
the difference in terms of an employee accepting such an assignment. Similar problems 
can occur in recruiting employees. A recruit may not join an organization if its location 
does not provide career opportunities for the partner.CHAPTER 18 Developing Talent 463
Phased Retirement. This provides older employees with an effective way of withdrawing 
from the organization and establishing a productive leisure life, by gradually reducing 
work hours and moving to full retirement.35 A recent study of women over 35 indi￾cates a strong interest for phased retirement plans, which may put new demands on 
related human resource management programs.36 Employees gradually devote less of 
their time to the organization and more time to leisure pursuits (which to some might 
include developing a new career). For example, people may use the extra time off 
work to take courses, to gain new skills and knowledge, and to create opportunities 
for productive leisure. IBM, for example, once offered tuition rebates for courses on 
any topic taken within three years of retirement.37 Many IBM pre-retirees used this 
program to prepare for second careers.
Equally important, phased retirement lessens the reality shock often experienced 
by those who retire all at once. It helps employees grow accustomed to leisure life and 
withdraw emotionally from the organization. A growing number of companies have 
some form of phased retirement. Pepperdine University and the University of Southern 
California, for example, implemented a phased retirement program for professors that 
allows them some choice about part-time employment starting at age 55. The program 
is intended to provide more promotional positions for younger academics and to give 
older professors greater opportunities to establish a leisure life and still enjoy many 
benefits of the university.
Application 18.1 describes how the HR organization within PepsiCo evolved its 
career planning and development processes.38
The Results of Career Planning and Development
As shown in this section, career planning and development is a broad field within orga￾nization development. A variety of studies have examined individual aspects of career 
development. For example,
Realistic job previews have been associated with reduced turnover and training 
costs, and increased organization commitment and job satisfaction39
Assessment centers have been associated with career advancement when the par￾ticipant works on the recommended areas of improvement40
Challenging assignments and job rotations have helped “plateaued employees” 
(those with little chance of further advancement) increase their work satisfaction 
and productivity if the organization supports lateral (as opposed to strictly vertical) 
job changes41
General training programs in organizations have produced documented returns on 
investment from 16% to 492%42
Work–life balance interventions have led to beneficial outcomes for both employees 
and organizations, including increased creativity, morale, and effectiveness, and 
decreased absenteeism and turnover.43
This variety of career planning and development interventions also makes program 
evaluation very difficult, although the overall assessment of its impact on retention 
and motivation remains positive.

•PepsiCo’s Career Planning 
and Development Framework
PepsiCo has a long and well-deserved history of 
innovative employee and leadership development 
practices. However, in the late 1990s, a significant 
number of strategic and organizational changes, 
including the spin-off of Tricon and the Pepsi 
Bottling Group and the acquisition of Tropicana and 
Quaker, had left employees feeling unsure about 
the requirements for success in the organization. 
In particular, employees wanted to know more 
about how to build a successful career within the 
new organization. Moreover, and because of Pepsi’s 
traditionally entrepreneurial and autonomous cul￾ture, each business unit had set up its own way of 
developing employees. In this new organization, 
employees wanted more information about how 
to take advantage of cross-business unit and cross￾functional opportunities.
In response, senior management tasked the 
internal OD group to partner with the HR organiza￾tion and line managers to develop tools and pro￾cesses to address these concerns. Their initial efforts 
resulted in:
• The PepsiCo Leadership Model that outlined lead￾ership competencies and provided a frame￾work for the 360-degree feedback process
• A career development Web-resource called 
MyDevelopNet that provided assessment tools 
and development resources
• A cross-business unit job posting process called 
MyCareerConnection that listed open jobs in other 
functions and business units.
Although these tools and processes became an 
important part of PepsiCo’s career planning and 
development process, people continued to want 
more detail and support regarding what it took to 
build a successful career in a given function.
The interest in functional careers was somewhat at 
odds with Pepsi’s strong division-focused culture. 
To shift from a business unit–focused approach to 
a broader and standardized enterprise view, the 
organization needed to explore the importance of 
consistency in language and processes across spe￾cialties but within functions. The HR function was 
selected to pilot the approach—to set the agenda, 
lead the initiative, and resolve any problems inher￾ent in the design and implementation process. 
The task force, representing the ten specialties 
within global HR (e.g., compensation, benefits, 
diversity, staffing, OD), was established in 2003 to 
develop a fully integrated career solution within 
the HR function. It was chartered with the follow￾ing objectives:
1. Provide employees access to career information
that will allow greater ownership of their devel￾opment and enhanced development planning 
discussions with their managers
2. Provide consistent language around competencies, 
leadership skills, and the critical experiences required 
for career progression in the HR function at 
PepsiCo
3. Provide greater clarity regarding different opportu￾nities and choices rather than prescribed paths.
If properly designed and implemented, the inter￾vention would result in a stronger and more 
capable HR function—one that speaks a consistent 
language across very different types of specialties, 
and has a greater emphasis on individual develop￾ment and career growth. In addition, it would pave 
the way for similar efforts in other major functions 
such as sales, marketing, finance, operations, and 
R&D. Based on this diagnosis, the HR Careers Task 
Force adopted a five step, OD-related process that 
emphasized input from key stakeholders across the 
function as well as early involvement and partici￾pation in the process.
The first step was to develop an appropriate com￾petency model for the HR function. The task force 
collected lists of HR competencies from internal 
and external sources, including business-unit 
models, professional associations, and the litera￾ture. Importantly, although several business units 
had their own competency list, a successful inter￾vention required a list that worked well with all 
employees in HR. The resulting model consisted of 
12 competencies that were measured by 50 spe￾cific areas of applied knowledge and practice.
The second step was to identify the jobs that 
would be part of the solution. The task force 
believed that it was unrealistic to analyze and 
include every job in a function. Rather, the team 
identified key positions with multiple incumbents 
within each of the ten HR specialties. These jobs 
application 18.1CHAPTER 18 Developing Talent 465
represented consistent, sustainable, long-term 
roles to which employees could aspire as part of 
their career planning. The final list of key jobs 
comprised the target for their work.
The third step was to validate and calibrate the 
competencies for each of these key jobs. To do 
that, the task force created a “job modeling” sur￾vey that sampled the incumbents in the key jobs 
across the entire HR function. The first 50 ques￾tions represented the key HR competencies identi￾fied in Step 1, and asked participants to rate the 
proficiency level required to do the job well. The 
next set of questions were drawn from the PepsiCo 
Leadership Model to understand the leadership 
emphasis required in the job, and the final sec￾tion asked about the experiences the incumbents 
were gaining from the role. For example, did the 
job provide the opportunity to partner with other 
divisions, manage a merger or acquisition process, 
or apply organization design skills?
The fourth step required the task force to build 
the key job database so that it could be used by 
managers and employees. That is, whenever a 
manager, HR professional, or executive coach sat 
down with an employee to have a career conver￾sation, the database needed to be able to address 
at least three questions:
1. Where are the jobs (level, location, specialty 
area)?
2. What are the different accountabilities, experi￾ences, and competencies required for the job?
3. How do I get to the next job from where I am?
The database was designed to provide informa￾tion on each of these questions and to facilitate 
rich career discussions. Data elements in the 
profiles included overall position description, key 
accountabilities, requisite functional and leader￾ship competencies, experiences gained, typical 
next jobs within and across levels and functions, 
required education and experience, and interac￾tions with other roles.
To facilitate the database’s use, additional 
supporting tools were developed, including the 
following:
• An interactive online tool that allowed employees 
to view all of the key jobs in the function and 
their own division with typical next steps identi￾fied for each position
• The ability to initiate self-assessments against 
functional or leadership competencies and 
compare those with either the current job or 
any other job in the database
• The ability to request a manager’s assessment 
of an employee against the same competencies 
for comparison and discussion
• A HR Resource Guide containing development 
tips, tactics, and resources to help employees 
build their functional competencies
• A behavioral interviewing guide to assist in job 
interviews and placements
• New training resources and modules to sup￾port deeper knowledge acquisition in key 
areas of need.
The database and tools were shared with manag￾ers, functional VPs, and senior leaders to ensure 
that the jobs were properly calibrated against oth￾ers both within and across HR divisions. This data 
feedback stage was time-consuming but ensured 
the product was of high quality and high validity, 
created additional buy-in on the part of leaders 
to actually use the tools, and allowed leaders to 
reevaluate the nature and accountabilities of the 
jobs in question.
The final step of the process involved implement￾ing the system and evaluating its acceptance and 
use for areas in need of adjustment. Each HR spe￾cialty created their own integrated rollout strategy 
based on current initiatives and available resources. 
Certain key messages and tools supporting the 
framework and their relationship to existing HR 
processes were standardized to ensure a common 
language and approach to career development.466 PART 5 Human Resource Management Interventions
executives for strategic leadership roles.44 A large number of organizations offer lead￾ership development programs, including Procter & Gamble, Federal Express, PepsiCo, 
Cisco Systems, IBM, Microsoft, and Hewlett-Packard.
Management and leadership development interventions can be differentiated from 
career development. In management and leadership development, the focus is on 
developing the skills and knowledge the organization believes will be necessary to 
implement future strategies and manage the business. In career development, the focus 
is on building the skills and knowledge the individual believes will best equip them for 
the career they prefer. Ideally, there is considerable overlap between the two.
A recent survey of over 600 executives by the Center for Effective Organizations 
and Heidrick and Struggles strongly agreed that preparing leaders was an important 
top-management team function, but was “uncertain” about the extent to which their 
top-management team performed this function well—the lowest score among the ten 
functions listed. This section describes the purpose and goals of leadership develop￾ment interventions, the application steps and conditions for transfer, and the research 
support for this intervention.
What Are the Goals?
The term training is typically used when the goal is development of the workforce, 
while the terms management development and leadership development are normally applied 
when the goal is development of the organization’s management and executive talent. 
There is a wide range of training and development interventions, and not all involve 
OD. For leadership development to be considered an OD intervention, it must focus 
on changing the skills and knowledge of a group of organization members to improve 
their effectiveness or to build the capabilities of an organization system.45 For example, 
a leadership development program that provides information about the organization’s 
strategy would not qualify as an OD intervention.
Application Stages
Management and leadership development interventions generally follow a pro￾cess of needs assessment, setting instructional objectives and design, delivery, and 
evaluation.46
Perform a needs assessment. Similar to the diagnostic process in the general 
model of planned change, a needs assessment typically determines the compe￾tencies believed to characterize effective leaders in the organization. This can be 
done by interviewing well-respected executives or reviewing lists of published 
leadership competencies. The logic assumes that if the right leadership skills and 
knowledge can be identified, a program can be developed to educate and equip 
participants with these competencies. McCall has challenged this approach and 
suggested that good leaders develop competencies from experience, not training. 
As a result, a needs assessment must gather data on the strategy, the organization, 
and the individuals who might attend the leadership program.47
The strategy assessment involves understanding the knowledge and experiences 
future leaders will need to execute the business strategy. It includes tasks, activities, 
and decisions that participants should perform better after training as well as the 
conceptual frameworks that guide these activities. This can be done by identifying 
the top three to five external and internal leadership challenges facing the busi￾ness48 and the experiences that might help build the competence to deal with 
them. For example, the Hartford Financial Services Group believes that its long his￾tory of success has created an internal culture that favors stability over change. In 
the face of increasing competition and more demanding customers, its leadership 
1.CHAPTER 18 Developing Talent 467
development program included the analysis of a business situation and activities 
intended to create change readiness in a relevant portion of the organization.
The organization assessment focuses on the systems that may affect the ability 
to transfer learning and developmental experiences back to the organization. 
For transfer to occur, participants must be provided with the opportunity and 
appropriate conditions to apply their new skills, knowledge, and abilities to the 
work situation. The organization assessment determines whether the necessary 
support exists in the organization to make leadership development worthwhile. 
For example, if executives are generally unwilling to send their managers to the 
program for fear of losing them to promotion, then the organ ization assessment 
would suggest addressing management’s readiness for change before implement￾ing the program.
The final element, individual assessment, aims to understand the existing pool 
of people who should be candidates for the program. Such an assessment would 
include their current level and ranges of skills, knowledge, and abilities. Recently, 
leadership development programs have begun to focus on the personal growth of 
the participants, and so an important part of the assessment would be to under￾stand individuals’ attitudes toward personal reflection and its role in leadership 
effectiveness.
Develop the objectives and design of the training. This step first establishes 
outcome objectives for development intervention. These objectives should describe 
both the results expected from a competent leader and how those results were 
achieved. For a leadership development program, an appropriate objective might 
be “the ability to produce an acceptable strategic plan for a strategic business unit” 
or “to increase participants’ commitment to the strategic direction of the corpora￾tion.”
The design of the training involves making choices from among a wide variety 
of techniques. The more traditional methods of classroom lectures, 360-degree 
feedback, simulations, case studies, or experiential exercises have been augmented 
by more recent emphases on rotational assignments, on-the-job training, coaching, 
or action-learning projects.
Deliver the training. This stage implements the development program. Participants 
apply, or are invited, to attend the program, complete the activities included in its 
design, and return to their normal work routines.
Evaluate the training. This final step assesses the training to determine whether 
it met its objectives. The four criteria most commonly used to evaluate training 
effectiveness are reaction, learning, behavior, and results.49 Reaction is the most 
commonly used evaluation criterion and refers simply to the participants’ initial 
judgment about the training’s usefulness. It is often assessed via questionnaires 
completed immediately following the training activity. The learning criterion refers 
to whether or not participants acquired the knowledge that should have been 
transferred during the training; it stops short of assessing performance or behavior 
on the job. This can be assessed via interview or questionnaire. The behavior cri￾terion assesses whether new skills and abilities gained in the training are actu￾ally applied to job activities. These data can be collected through observation or 
through interviews with the participant’s manager. The final criterion, results, 
determines whether or not the training can be credited with improvements in the 
participant’s or the system’s effectiveness.
Application 18.2 describes a management development program at Microsoft 
Corporation. The company was interested in building the strategic competence of its 
middle managers and making the organization more capable.

4.Leading Your Business at Microsoft 
Corporation
Microsoft is the largest software development 
organization and one of the most successful busi￾nesses in the world. In its relatively short history, 
growth has characterized almost every aspect of 
the company. Growth not only fueled Microsoft’s 
reputation and no small number of millionaires, 
but also demanded that the Microsoft organiza￾tion mature. As technologies, products, markets, 
and revenues grew, so did the opportunities for 
professional advancement. Software development 
engineers that wanted to guide, shape, and man￾age the organization’s growth found plenty of 
chances to become managers, directors, and vice 
presidents.
After years of double-digit growth, senior manage￾ment at Microsoft worried that promotion of the 
young and brilliant technologists it had recruited 
was occurring too fast. While they understood 
technology, they were ill prepared to manage 
strategy, structure, people, and change. Interviews 
with successful and unsuccessful Microsoft man￾agers about the competencies necessary to lead a 
business confirmed these suspicions. CEO Steve 
Ballmer believed that the speed of change in 
the software industry demanded leadership from 
the middle of the organization where people 
were closest to the technology and custom￾ers. He commissioned Microsoft’s Management 
Development Group (MDG) to create a series of 
workshops aimed at developing the future lead￾ers of the organization. Three courses were envi￾sioned for the series, including one focused on 
strategic thinking and strategic change.
The MDG group contacted an OD practitioner 
with a background in educational interventions, 
strategy, and large-scale systems change. Together 
with the internal OD practitioners and other 
members of the MDG organization, the OD practi￾tioner interviewed additional managers, discussed 
program philosophy and company culture, shared 
strategy and strategic change concepts, and pro￾posed a variety of methods to transfer the topics 
of strategic leadership to the participants.
After several weeks of discussions, a two-day work￾shop design began to emerge. It consisted of a 
variety of learning technologies and was based on 
a principle and philosophy of self-managed learn￾ing. That is, the OD practitioner and the MDG 
consultants assumed that the participants, already 
having achieved a middle-management position, 
would possess a broad range of experiences and 
knowledge. The purpose of the workshop would 
be to marry that experience with the concepts 
from strategy and change. A number of delivery 
methods, including lectures, videos, experiential 
exercises, and case studies, were used to expose the 
participants to certain topics, such as goals and goal 
setting, distinctive competencies, environmental 
scanning, strategy, and strategy implementation. 
At the beginning of the workshop, the participants 
would be allowed to form “peer consulting teams” 
and, following an input module, the teams would 
work individually and then in groups to apply the 
concepts to their own business. In this way, the par￾ticipants actually left the workshop with a roughed￾out strategic plan.
The design was “beta tested” with a group of 
about 20 middle managers, and their comments, 
reactions, and suggestions were used to make 
adjustments to different parts of the workshop 
design. For example, the peer consulting groups 
turned out to be a very powerful idea and all of 
the groups wanted more time at the beginning 
of the workshop to explain their business so 
that the other members of the group had a good 
understanding of the competitive issues. After the 
beta workshop, the program was marketed to all 
middle managers at the Redmond, Washington, 
headquarters. Eventually, middle managers in 
Asia, Canada, and Europe were included. Over 
two years, about 500 of Microsoft’s most impor￾tant future leaders went through the workshop.
Ten days after the workshop, an evaluation was 
emailed to all participants for the reactions and 
feedback. This provided an ongoing database to 
ensure that the program continued to meet the 
needs of the middle managers. In addition, a quali￾tative study of the workshop’s impact was con￾ducted about a year into the program. A variety of 
information about how participants had used the 
workshop was gathered. Most participants rated 
the course highly, found the materials relevant and 
application 18.2CHAPTER 18 Developing Talent 469
useful, had applied many of the frameworks and 
models in their day-to-day work, and appreciated 
the opportunity to stop and think about their busi￾ness. The most highly rated feature of the class was 
the peer-to-peer learning and the business view the 
participants gained, and there were few examples 
of direct impact on the organization. However, only 
a few cases of dramatic success were found, includ￾ing a substantial increase in strategic focus, clarity, 
and profitability within one of the Microsoft Office 
groups; a merger between two groups that was 
conceived during the workshop and then executed 
successfully after the program; and the launching 
of a new strategy within groups of the MSN and 
Xbox organizations. In each of these cases, the 
managers reported implementing the ideas and 
plans worked out in the workshop and involving 
their direct reports in additional discussions. These 
additional inputs along with the original plans 
became the basis for implementing changes.
The Results of Development Interventions
Despite the prevalence of management and leadership development interventions in 
the workplace and the hundreds of self-reported case studies in industry magazines, 
most of the evaluation research consists of only reactions, the weakest measure of 
effectiveness.50 A few more rigorous assessments, however, provide some evidence 
about leadership development effects. For example, a leadership development program 
at Catholic Healthcare Partners that involved 360-degree feedback and action-learn￾ing projects indicated both organizational and individual improvements. The greatest 
individual improvements occurred in self-awareness, setting and achieving goals, and 
working across boundaries. The greatest organization benefits were an increased focus 
on strategy and goals setting, more effective teams, and members feeling more empow￾ered in their work.51 Leadership development programs have reported increased orga￾nizational productivity and decreased turnover and increased sales.52
In a book-length evaluation of a leadership development program for school super￾intendents in the state of Florida, the most common outcomes of the program included 
the development of strategies and competencies for continuous learning, personal 
change in specific areas, and progress on learning projects undertaken by groups of 
participants. However, the researchers note that less than 50% of the participants 
reported such outcomes and that most participants reported no or very little change on 
a survey instrument. Relevant to the reported outcomes, the researchers found that no 
particular element of the program was more or less effective. Finally, the researchers 
speculated that much of the variation in results was due to the participants themselves. 
Those superintendents who were in “fine tuning” mode had little to learn while those 
in a “role expansion” or “new perspectives” mode reported more positive outcomes.53
SUMMARY
This chapter presented three major human resources interventions: coaching and men￾toring interventions, career planning and development interventions, and leadership 
and management development interventions. Although these kinds of change programs 470
generally are carried out by human resources specialists, OD practitioners are gaining 
competence in these areas and are increasingly involved in these interventions.
Coaching interventions are aimed at helping individuals. Although it can be an 
integral part of other OD interventions, it is aimed at helping individuals clarify their 
goals, deal with potential stumbling blocks, learn to lead change, and improve their 
performance.
Career planning and development and management and leadership development 
interventions are intended to improve the organization’s ability to develop and retain a 
valuable workforce. Career planning involves helping people choose jobs, occupations, 
and organizations at different stages of their careers. It is a highly personalized process 
that includes assessing one’s interests, values, and capabilities; examining alternative 
careers; and making relevant decisions. Career development helps employees achieve 
career objectives. Effective efforts in that direction include linking corporate business 
objectives, human resources needs, and the personal needs of employees. Different 
career development needs and practices exist and are relevant to each of the four 
stages of people’s careers.
Management and leadership development programs build leadership skills, often in 
alignment with a predetermined set of competencies, socialize managers and leader￾ship in a set of values believed to be important to the success of the organization, and 
help execute strategic change agendas. Leadership development is one of the most 
popular OD interventions today.

PART 5 Human Resource Management Interventions19
Managing Workforce Diversity
and Wellness
This chapter presents two additional human 
resources management interventions in 
organizations. Increasing workforce diversity 
pro-vides an especially challenging environ￾ment for human resources management, and 
an attractive opportunity for line manag￾ers looking for a source of innovation. The 
mix of age, gender, race, sexual orientation, 
disabilities, and culture and value orienta￾tions in the modern workforce is increasingly 
varied. Management’s perspectives, strategic 
responses, and implementation approaches 
can help address pressures posed by this 
diversity and leverage this resource for orga￾nization effectiveness. In addition, wellness 
interventions, such as stress management 
programs and employee assistance programs 
(EAPs), are addressing several important social 
trends, such as the relationship and interac￾tion between professional and personal roles 
and lives, fitness and health consciousness, 
and drug and alcohol abuse.
WORKFORCE DIVERSITY INTERVENTIONS
Several profound trends are shaping the labor markets of modern organizations. 
Researchers suggest and managers confirm that contemporary workforce charac￾teristics are radically different from what they were just 20 years ago. Employees 
represent every ethnic background and color; range from highly educated to illiter￾ate; vary in age from 18 to 80; may appear perfectly healthy or may have a terminal 
illness; may be single parents or part of dual-income, divorced, same-sex, or tradi￾tional families; and may be physically or mentally challenged.
Workforce diversity is more than a euphemism for cultural or racial differences. 
Such a definition is too narrow and focuses attention away from the broad range of 
issues that a diverse workforce poses. Diversity results from people who bring dif￾ferent resources and perspectives to the workplace and who have distinctive needs, 
preferences, expectations, and lifestyles.1
 Organizations must design human resources 
systems that account for these differences if they are to attract and retain a productive 
workforce and if they want to turn diversity into a competitive advantage.
What Are the Goals?
Figure 19.1 presents a general framework for managing diversity in organizations.2
First, the model suggests that an organization’s diversity approach is a function of 
internal and external pressures for and against diversity. Social norms and globalization 
support the belief that organization performance is enhanced when the workforce’s 
diversity is embraced as an opportunity. But diversity is often discouraged by those who 
fear that too many perspectives, beliefs, values, and attitudes dilute concerted action. 
Second, management’s perspective and priorities with respect to diversity can range from 
resistance to active learning and from marginal to strategic. For example, organizations 474 PART 5 Human Resource Management Interventions
can resist diversity by implementing only legally mandated policies such as affirmative 
action, equal employment opportunity, or Americans with Disabilities Act require￾ments. On the other hand, a learning and strategic perspective can lead management 
to view diversity as a source of competitive advantage. For example, a health care 
organization with a diverse customer base can can not only improve perceptions of 
service quality by having a more diverse physician base, it can embrace diversity by 
tailoring the range of services to that market and building systems and processes that 
are flexible. Third, within management’s priorities, the organization’s strategic responses
can range from reactive to proactive. Diversity efforts at Texaco and Denny’s had little 
momentum until a series of embarrassing race-based events forced a response. Fourth, 
the organization’s implementation style can range from episodic to systemic. A diversity 
approach will be most effective when the strategic responses and implementation style 
fit with management’s intent and internal and external pressures.
Unfortunately, organizations have tended to address workforce diversity pres sures 
in a piecemeal fashion; only five percent of more than 1,400 companies surveyed in 
the mid-1990s thought they were doing a “very good job” of managing diversity.3
As each trend makes itself felt, the organization reacts with appropriate but narrow 
responses. For example, as the percentage of women in the workforce increased, many 
organizations simply added maternity leaves to their benefits packages; as the number of 
physically challenged workers increased and when Congress passed the Americans with 
Disabilities Act in 1990, organizations changed their physical settings to accommodate 
wheelchairs. Demographers warn, however, that these trends are not only powerful 
by themselves but will likely interact with each other to force organizational change. 
Thus, a growing number of organizations, such as Bank of America, PepsiCo, Procter 
& Gamble, and Yahoo, are taking bolder steps. They are not only adopting learning

perspectives with respect to diversity, but systemically weaving diversity-friendly values 
and practices into the cultural fabric of the organization.
Application Stages
Many of the OD interventions described in this book can be applied to the strategic 
responses and implementation of workforce diversity, as shown in Table 19.1. It sum￾marizes several of the internal and external pressures facing organizations, including 
age, gender, race, disability, culture and values, and sexual orientation.4 For example, 
the median age of the workforce is increasing, women make up a larger percentage of 
the workforce, and globalization is increasing the number of different cultural values 
present in the workplace. The table also reports the major trends characterizing those 
dimensions, organizational implications and workforce needs, and specific OD inter￾ventions that can address those implications.
Age To address age diversity, organization development interventions, such as work 
design, wellness programs (discussed below), career planning and development, 
and reward systems must be adapted to these different age groups and demographic 
cohorts.5
 For the older employee, work designs can reduce the physical components or 
increase the knowledge and experience components of a job. At Builder’s Emporium,

a chain of home improvement centers, the store clerk job was redesigned to eliminate 
heavy lifting by assigning night crews to replenish shelves and emphasizing sales abil￾ity instead of strength. Generation-X workers will likely require more challenge and 
autonomy. Wellness programs can be used to address the physical and mental health 
of both generations. Career planning and development programs will have to recog￾nize the different career stages of each cohort and offer resources tailored to that stage. 
Finally, reward system interventions may offer increased health benefits, time off, and 
other perks for the older workforce while using promotion, ownership, and pay to 
attract and motivate the scarcer, younger workforce.
Gender Work design, reward systems, and career development are among the more 
important interventions for addressing issues arising out of the gender trend. For 
example, jobs can be modified to accommodate the special demands of working moth￾ers. A number of organizations, such as AstraZeneca, Volkswagen of America, and 
Hewlett-Packard, have instituted job sharing, by which two people perform the tasks 
associated with one job. The firms have done this to allow their female employees to 
pursue both family and work careers. Reward system interventions, especially fringe 
benefits, can be tailored to offer special leaves to mothers and fathers, child-care 
options, flexible working hours, and health and wellness benefits. The Container Store 
offers a family-friendly shift from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. so that working mothers can easily 
drop off and pick up kids from school. Career development interventions help main￾tain, develop, and retain a competent and diverse workforce. Recent research on career 
development programs suggests that organizations consider the assumptions embed￾ded in their career development programs to ensure programs are not biased toward 
masculine experiences and worldviews, especially those related to careers.6
Unfortunately, many programs over the last several years have tended to focus more 
on the symptoms, as opposed to sources of gender inequity.7
 Recent research suggests 
that once an organization recognizes the problem, diagnosis through interviews with 
employees is critical to addressing the sources of gender inequity. The research further 
suggests that using a strategy of small interventions, “small wins,” or small initiatives 
that combine behavior and understanding and that target the organization’s specific 
issues are more effective. For example, one European retail company discovered upon 
interviewing its employees that a key issue in turnover among female employees was 
the company’s lack of discipline regarding time. Last-minute scheduling, meeting over￾runs, and tardiness wreaked havoc on female employees trying to manage work and 
home responsibilities. Company leadership began a more disciplined approach to time, 
resulting in greater efficiency and effectiveness. Resolving such issues requires careful 
and organization-specific diagnosis and intervention.
Race/Ethnicity Race continues to be an important issue in diversity interventions, 
especially as organizations work to increase diversity among top leadership and board 
members. Training can increase the likelihood that effective diversity management 
programs rely on data (not impressions or perceptions) and are responsive, move 
beyond eliminating obvious racism to eradicating more subtle forms as well, elimi￾nate vague selection and promotion criteria which can let discrimination persist, link 
diversity management to individual performance appraisals, and develop and enforce 
appropriate rules.8
 For example, 20% of Verizon’s board of directors and 20% of its 
total management team are African American; Wyndham Hotels established a diversity 
officer position that reports to the CEO, and General Mills and Citicorp work with non￾profit firm Minority Leadership Talent to identify, recruit, and retain black and Hispanic 
candidates. Mentoring programs can ensure that minorities in the advancement stage 
get the appropriate coaching and that successful minority managers and executives get 
the chance to share their wisdom and experience with others.CHAPTER 19 Managing Workforce Diversity and Wellness 477
Sexual Orientation Diversity in sexual and affectional orientation, including gay, 
lesbian, and bisexual individuals and couples, increasingly is affecting the way that 
organizations think about human resources. The primary organizational implication 
of sexual orientation diversity is discrimination. Gay men and lesbians often are reti￾cent to discuss how organizational policies can be less discriminatory because they 
fear their openness will lead to unfair treatment. People can have strong emotional 
reactions to sexual orientation. When these feelings interact with the gender, culture, 
and value trends described in this section, the likelihood of both overt and uncon￾scious discrimination is high, especially around the often-misperceived relationship 
between sexual orientation and AIDS/HIV.
Interventions aimed at this dimension of workforce diversity are relatively new 
in OD and are being developed as organizations encounter sexual orientation 
issues in the workplace. The most frequent response is education and training. This 
intervention increases members’ awareness of the facts and decreases the likelihood 
of overt discrimination. While sexual orientation is not protected under federal equal 
employment opportunity (EEO) laws, many cities and states have passed legislation 
protecting sexual orientation. Human resources practices having to do with EEO and 
fringe benefits also can help to address sexual orientation parity issues. Most orga￾nizations have modified their EEO statements to address sexual orientation, includ￾ing 61% of Fortune 500 companies.9
 Firms such as Ben & Jerry’s, Boeing, Northop 
Grumman, Hilton, and Google have communicated strongly to members and outsiders 
that decisions with respect to hiring, promotion, transfer, and so on cannot (and 
will not) be made with respect to a person’s sexual orientation. Similarly, organiza￾tions are increasingly offering domestic-partner benefit plans, and now over 5,000 
employers offer domestic-partner benefits.10 Companies such as Motorola, Shell Oil, 
Microsoft, and Apple as well as governments and universities have extended health 
care and other benefits to the same-sex partners of their members.
Disability The organizational implications of the disability trend represent both oppor￾tunity and adjustment. The productivity of physically and mentally disabled workers 
often surprises managers. Training is required to increase managers’ awareness of this 
opportunity and to create a climate where accommodation requests can be made with￾out fear.11 Employing disabled workers, however, also means a need for more compre￾hensive health care, new physical workplace layouts, new attitudes toward working 
with the disabled, and challenging jobs that use a variety of skills.
OD interventions, including work design, career planning and development, and 
performance management, can be used to integrate the disabled into the workforce. 
For example, traditional approaches to job design can simplify work to permit physically 
handicapped workers to complete an assembly task. Career planning and development 
programs need to focus on making disabled workers aware of career opportunities. Too 
often these employees do not know that advancement is possible, and they are left 
feeling frustrated. Career paths need to be developed for these workers.
Performance management interventions, including goal setting, monitoring, and 
coaching performance, aligned with the workforce’s characteristics are important. 
At Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Florida, for example, a supervisor learned sign lan￾guage to communicate with a deaf employee whose productivity was low but whose 
quality of work was high. Two other deaf employees were transferred to that super￾visor’s department, and over a two-year period, the performance of the deaf workers 
improved 1,000% with no loss in quality.
Culture and Values Cultural diversity has broad organizational implications. Different 
cultures represent a variety of values, work ethics, and norms of correct behavior. 
Not all cultures want the same things from work, and simple, piecemeal changes in 478 PART 5 Human Resource Management Interventions
specific organizational practices will be inadequate if the workforce is culturally diverse. 
Management practices will have to be aligned with cultural values and support both 
career and family orientations. English is a second language for many people. This implies 
that jobs of all types (processing, customer contact, production, and so on) may need to 
be adjusted for English-speaking customers, but it also represents opportunity. If there 
are large non-English-speaking markets, the organization has an important resource for 
reaching those markets. Finally, the organization will be expected to satisfy both extrinsic 
and monetary needs, as well as intrinsic and personal growth needs.
Several planned change interventions, including employee involvement, reward 
systems, and career planning and development, can be used to adapt to cultural diver￾sity. Employee involvement practices can be adapted to the needs for participation in 
decision making. People from certain cultures, such as Scandinavia, are more likely 
to expect and respond to high-involvement policies; other cultures, such as Latin 
America, view participation with reservation. (See the discussion of cultural values 
in Chapter 23.) Participation in an organization can take many forms, from sugges￾tion systems and attitude surveys to high-involvement work designs and performance 
management systems. Organizations can maximize worker productivity by basing the 
amount of power and information workers have on cultural and value orientations.
Reward systems can focus on increasing flexibility. For example, flexible working 
hours enable employees to meet personal obligations without sacrificing organizational 
objectives. Many organizations have implemented this innovation, and most report 
that the positive benefits outweigh the costs. Work locations also can be varied. Many 
organizations, including Capital One, Hewlett-Packard, and Sun Microsystems, allow 
workers to spend part of their time telecommuting from home. Other flexible benefits, 
such as floating holidays, allow people from different cultures to match important reli￾gious and family occasions with work schedules.
Child-care and dependent-care assistance also support different lifestyles. For 
example, at Stride Rite Corporation, the Stride Rite Intergenerational Day Care Center 
houses 55 children between the ages of 15 months and six years as well as 24 elders 
over 60 years old. The center was established after an organizational survey deter￾mined that 25% of employees provided some sort of elder care and that an additional 
13% anticipated doing so within five years.
Finally, career planning and development programs can help workers identify 
advancement opportunities that are in line with their cultural values. Some cultures 
value technical skills over hierarchical advancement; others see promotion as a prime 
indicator of self-worth and accomplishment. By matching programs with people, job 
satisfaction, productivity, and employee retention can be improved.
The Results for Diversity Interventions
Workforce diversity interventions are growing rapidly in OD. Despite this growth, 
most evaluation efforts are survey oriented and somewhat cursory. A national sur￾vey in the late 1990s found that 75% of firms either have or plan to begin diversity 
efforts.12 Research suggests that diversity interventions are especially prevalent in 
large organizations with diversity-friendly senior management and human resources 
policies,13 and an internal evaluation of a diversity training program in a large manu￾facturing firm showed positive attitudinal changes over a three month period with 
respect to emotional reactions, making judgments, behavioral reactions, and orga￾nizational impacts.14 Although existing evidence shows that diversity interventions 
are growing in popularity, there is still ambiguity about the depth of organizational 
commitment to such practices and the contingencies that moderate the relationship 
between commitment and performance.15
Recently, however, a more complete evaluation of diversity management 
programs revealed positive results.16 Using data collected by the Equal Employment CHAPTER 19 Managing Workforce Diversity and Wellness 479
Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and survey data from organizations, researchers 
divided diversity programs into three categories: structures of responsibility, such as 
affirmative action plans, diversity commitees and task forces, and diversity managers; 
educational programs, such as diversity training and diversity feedback for manag￾ers; and networking and mentoring programs. The data displayed a clear pattern. 
Structural programs were associated with significant increases in overall managerial 
diversity. Education and feedback programs were not followed by increases in mana￾gerial diversity. Finally, programs that attempted to increase the networking among 
different groups were associated with modest increases in management diversity. 
Importantly, the presence of structural interventions improved the effect of the other 
two interventions. In efforts to reduce inequality in the workplace, the researchers 
suggest that the popularity of individually based diversity interventions should be 
reviewed carefully. A great deal more research like this is needed to understand these 
newer interventions and their outcomes.
Application 19.1 describes a workforce diversity intervention at Baxter Export, 
showing how diversity can exist in many areas and how organizations can employ a 
range of interventions to make the workplace more flexible.17
EMPLOYEE STRESS AND WELLNESS INTERVENTIONS
In the past two decades, organizations have become increasingly aware of the rela￾tionship between employee wellness and productivity.18 The American Stress Institute 
(www.stress.org) estimates that job stress costs U.S. business over $300 billion annually 
due to increased absenteeism, employee turnover, diminished productivity, medical, 
legal and insurance expenses, and workers’ compensation payments. Stress manage￾ment and wellness interventions, including EAPs, have grown because organizations 
are interested in retaining a skilled workforce and concerned for the welfare of their 
employees. Companies such as Johnson & Johnson, Weyerhaeuser, Federal Express, 
Quaker Oats, and Abbott Laboratories are sponsoring a wide range of fitness, wellness, 
and stress management programs.
What Are the Goals?
Individual well-being or wellness comprises “the various life/non-work satisfactions 
enjoyed by individuals, work/job-related satisfactions, and general health.”19 Health 
is a subcomponent of well-being and includes both mental/psychological and physi￾cal/physiological factors. In addition, a person’s work setting, personality traits, and 
stress-coping skills affect overall well-being. In turn, well-being impacts personal and 
organizational outcomes, including absenteeism, productivity, and health insurance 
costs.20
Concern has been growing in organizations about managing the dysfunction caused 
by stress. A study by O’Toole and Lawler concluded that the price most workers and 
managers have paid to get more interesting and enriched jobs is an increased amount 
of stress.21 Stress has been linked to hypertension, heart attacks, diabetes, asthma, 
chronic pain, allergies, headache, backache, various skin disorders, cancer, immune 
system weakness, and a decrease in the number of white blood cells and changes in 
their function. It can also lead to alcoholism and drug abuse, two problems that are 
reaching epidemic proportions in organizations and society. For organizations, these 
personal effects can result in costly health benefits, absenteeism, turnover, and low 
performance. One study reported that one in three workers said they have thought 
about quitting because of stress; one in two workers said job stress reduced their pro￾ductivity; and one in five workers said they took sick leave in the month preceding the 
survey because of stress.22 Another study estimates that each employee who suffers 
from a stress-related illness loses an average of 16 workdays per year.23PART 5 Human Resource Management Interventions
Embracing Employee Diversity 
at Baxter Export
Baxter Export Corporation is an 85-person unit 
responsible for international logistics at Baxter 
Healthcare, a $5.4 billion maker of health care 
products. Their diversity practices are the first 
steps in response to an 18-month study by Baxter 
International. A survey of 1,000 employees found 
that among salaried employees, most work–life 
tensions were driven by the need for greater bal￾ance and the desire for flexibility.
Work–life tensions are prevalent at Baxter Export. 
The pressures of a globally competitive business 
require analysts, who make around $40,000 
annually, to manage the flow of catheters, dialysis 
solutions, intravenous tubes, and other products 
to subsidiaries and customers around the world. 
As a result, many two-income families have been 
forced into intensive arrangements.
One analyst’s day ends with e-mails and voicemails 
from Saudi Arabia, Oman, and Panama; a confer￾ence call that runs over the allotted time; and the 
anxiety from expectations that dinner should be 
ready by 5:30 p.m. An on-time dinner is important 
because her husband, who has picked up their 
three-year-old from day care and their seven-year￾old from grade school, has to leave for one of his 
two night jobs. The week will also include a Cub 
Scout meeting, grocery shopping, other kids’ activi￾ties, and errands. “We’re kind of used to it . . . it’s 
our life,” the analyst says.
Another employee’s day begins at 6:30 a.m. 
because it’s easier to communicate with customers 
in South Africa and New Zealand, and she can pick 
up her daughter from day care by 4 p.m. Getting 
home sooner is also important because of the full￾time care required by her mother-in-law, who was 
recently diagnosed with cancer. “I was working 
overtime, often until 7 p.m.,” she explains. “I’d 
get home in time to give my daughter her bottle, 
then put her to sleep. I said, ‘this is ridiculous.’” 
The flexible work hours and at least one day a 
week spent telecommuting ease the burden.
At Baxter Export, 30% of its employees use 
telecommuting, job-sharing, or working part￾time to build flexibility into their schedules. John 
Linder, the manager who oversees the analysts, is 
convinced that acknowledging and easing tensions 
in the workplace is good business. Although he 
doesn’t work at home himself, he believes that 
his people are 10% more productive on the days 
they telecommute. Baxter’s willingness to accom￾modate problems, he adds, also pays off in higher 
commitment. Still, telecommuters are held to rules 
that limit disruption. They can’t work more than
two days a week out of the office. Any more than 
that and it begins to affect the cohesiveness of 
the group. In addition, everyone has to be in on 
Wednesdays for meetings, and they must pay for 
call-waiting on their home phones (Latin American 
customers, especially, don’t like voicemail).
With all their flexibility, however, Baxter Export 
employees still struggle to find balance. Most 
spend 45–50 hours a week on the job. There is 
a solution, but it is no easy fix: The division is 
entering a thorough restructuring that is altering 
not just its own jobs and processes but also those 
throughout the corporation.
Griff Lewis, the executive vice president who over￾sees Baxter Export, notes that the unit’s volume is 
growing at 12–15% per year, and he does not have 
the budget to add corresponding staff. Just to keep 
people’s hours reasonable, never mind reducing 
them, he has to find ways to lift productivity—
rethinking processes, redesigning jobs, and elimi￾nating unnecessary tasks.
Over the next five years, therefore, Baxter will have 
to move to an automated allocation system that 
requires overseas customers, rather than Baxter 
Export analysts, to prepare demand forecasts and 
enter orders. That system would route orders 
directly to U.S. warehouses and, as a result, decrease 
each analyst’s workload by three days per month 
within two years. Also, Lewis expects to standard￾ize processes across the 120 countries his depart￾ment services, eliminating extraneous tasks and 
allowing employees to address mostly exceptional 
orders and higher-level issues.
Already, such schemes have relieved the 60-hour 
weeks that were commonplace a few years ago. 
Lewis’s restructuring is complicated by his division’s 
web of relationships with the many units of its 
application 19.1CHAPTER 19 Managing Workforce Diversity and Wellness 481
Applications Stages
Stress and wellness interventions involve (1) diagnosing stress and being aware of its 
causes and (2) alleviating and coping with stress to improve wellness.
Diagnosing Stress and Becoming Aware of Its Causes Stress refers to the reaction of 
people to their environments. It involves both physiological and psychological responses 
to environmental conditions, causing people to change or adjust their behaviors. Stress 
is generally viewed in terms of the fit of people’s needs, abilities, and expectations with 
environmental demands, changes, and opportunities.24 A good person–environment 
fit results in positive reactions to stress; a poor fit leads to the negative consequences 
already described. Stress is generally positive when it occurs at moderate levels and 
contributes to effective motivation, innovation, and learning. For example, a promo￾tion is a stressful event that is experienced positively by most employees. On the other 
hand, stress can be dysfunctional when it is excessively high (or low) or persists over 
a long period of time. It can overpower a person’s coping abilities and cause physical 
and emotional exhaustion. For example, a boss who is excessively demanding and 
unsupportive can cause subordinates undue tension, anxiety, and dissatisfaction. Those 
factors, in turn, can lead to withdrawal behaviors, such as absenteeism and turnover; 
to ailments, such as headaches and high blood pressure; and to lowered performance. 
Situations in which there is a poor fit between employees and the organization pro￾duce negative stress consequences.
A tremendous amount of research has been conducted on the causes and conse￾quences of work stress. Figure 19.2 identifies specific occupational stressors, potential 
dysfunctional consequences, and interventions to address stress. People’s individual 
differences determine the extent to which the stressors are perceived negatively. For 
example, people with strong social support perceive the stressors as less stressful than 
those who do not have such support. This greater perceived stress can lead to such 
negative consequences as anxiety, poor decision making, increased blood pressure, and 
low productivity.
The stress model shows that almost any dimension of the organization, including 
the physical environment, structure, roles, or relationships, can cause negative stress. 
This suggests that much of the material covered so far in this book provides knowledge 
about work-related stressors, and implies that virtually all of the OD interventions 
included in the book can play a role in stress management. Team building, employee 
involvement, reward systems, and career planning and development all can help 
global parent. Baxter’s U.S. manufacturing division, 
for instance, maintains as little inventory as possible. 
When demand overseas exceeds expectations, 
Lewis’s analysts cannot always find product easily. 
If managers in Brazil cram in last-minute orders to 
meet quarterly quotas, someone at Baxter Export 
has to work late to meet requirements on time.
The attempts to build flexibility into the work 
schedules and think systemically about reducing

alleviate stressful working conditions. Thus, to some degree stress management has 
been under discussion throughout this book. Here, the focus is on those occupational 
stressors and stress management techniques that are unique to the stress field and that 
have received the most systematic attention from stress researchers.
Workplace Stressors. Figure 19.2 identifies several organizational sources of stress, 
including the physical environment, individual situations, group pressures, and 
organizational conditions. Extensive research has been done on three key individual 
sources of stress: the individual items related to work overload, role conflict, and role 
ambiguity.
Research relating workload to stress outcomes reveals that both too much or too 
little work can have negative consequences. Apparently, when the amount of work 
is in balance with people’s abilities and knowledge, stress has a positive impact on 
performance and satisfaction, but when workload either exceeds employees’ abilities 
(overload) or fails to challenge them (underload), people experience stress negatively. 
This negative experience can lead to lowered self-esteem and job dissatisfaction,

nervous symptoms, increased absenteeism, and reduced participation in organizational 
activities.25
People’s roles at work also can be a source of stress. A role can be defined as the 
sum total of expectations that the individual and significant others have about how 
the person should perform a specific job. Problems arise when there is role ambiguity 
and the person does not clearly understand what others expect of him or her, or when 
there is role conflict and the employee receives contradictory expectations that cannot 
be satisfied at the same time.26 Extensive studies of role ambiguity and conflict suggest 
that both conditions are prevalent in organizations, especially among managerial jobs 
where clarity often is lacking and job demands often are contradictory.27 For example, 
managerial job descriptions typically are so general that it is difficult to know precisely 
what is expected on the job. Similarly, managers spend most of their time interact￾ing with people from other departments, and opportunities for conflicting demands 
abound in these lateral relationships. Role ambiguity and conflict can cause severe 
stress, resulting in increased tension, dissatisfaction, and withdrawal, and reduced 
commitment and trust in others.
Individual Differences. Figure 19.2 identifies two classes of individual differences that 
can affect how people respond to workplace stressors: cognitive/affective characteris￾tics and biological/demographic characteristics. Much research has been devoted to the 
cognitive/affective category, especially the Type A behavior pattern, which is charac￾terized by impatience, competitiveness, and hostility. Type A personalities (in contrast 
to Type Bs) invest long hours working under tight deadlines, and put themselves under 
extreme time pressure by trying to do more and more work in less and less time. Type 
A people are especially prone to stress. For example, a longitudinal study of 3,500 men 
found that Type As had twice as many heart diseases, five times as many second heart 
attacks, and twice as many fatal heart attacks as did Type Bs.28
Stress management is directed at preventing negative stress outcomes either by 
changing the organizational conditions causing the stress or by enhancing employees’ 
abilities to cope with them. This preventive approach starts from a diagnosis of the cur￾rent situation, including employees’ self-awareness of their own stress and its sources. 
This diagnosis provides the information needed to develop an appropriate stress man￾agement program. There are two methods for diagnosing stress.
Charting stressors involves identifying organizational and personal stressors operating 
in a particular situation. Guided by a conceptual model like that shown in Figure 19.2, 
data can be collected through questionnaires and interviews about environmental and 
personal stressors. For example, researchers at the University of Michigan’s Institute 
for Social Research have developed standardized instruments for measuring most of 
the stressors shown in Figure 19.2. Similarly, there are specific instruments for mea￾suring the individual differences, such as hardiness, social support, and Type A or B 
behavior pattern. In addition to perceptions of stressors, it is necessary to measure 
stress consequences, such as subjective moods, performance, job satisfaction, absen￾teeism, blood pressure, and cholesterol level. Various instruments and checklists have 
been developed for obtaining people’s perceptions of negative consequences, and 
these can be supplemented with hard measures taken from company records, medical 
reports, and physical examinations.
Once measures of the stressors and consequences are obtained, the two sets of data 
must be related to reveal which stressors contribute most to negative stress in the 
situation under study. For example, a relational analysis might show that qualitative 
overload and role ambiguity are highly related to employee fatigue, absenteeism, and 
poor performance, especially for Type A employees. This kind of information points to 
specific organizational conditions that must be improved to reduce stress. Moreover, 
it identifies the kinds of employees who may need special counseling and training in 
stress management.484 PART 5 Human Resource Management Interventions
Health profiling is aimed at identifying stress symptoms so that corrective action can 
be taken. Many firms contract with local health care facilities to provide the service. 
It starts with a questionnaire asking people for their medical history; personal habits; 
current health; and vital signs, such as blood pressure, cholesterol level, and triglyc￾eride levels. It also may include a physical examination if some of the information is 
not readily available. Information from the questionnaire and physical examination 
is then analyzed, usually by a computer that outlines the individual’s health profile. 
This profile compares the individual’s characteristics with those of an average person 
of the same gender, age, and race. The profile identifies the person’s future health 
prospects, typically by placing him or her in a health-risk category with a known 
probability of fatal disease, such as cardiovascular risk. The health profile also indi￾cates how the health risks can be reduced by making personal and environmental 
changes such as dieting, exercising, or traveling.
Alleviating and Coping with Stress to Improve Wellness After diagnosing the pres￾ence and causes of stress, the next step in stress management is to do something about 
it. OD interventions for reducing negative stress tend to fall into two groups: those 
aimed at changing the organizational conditions causing stress and those directed at 
helping people to cope better with stress. Because stress results from the interaction 
between people and the environment, both strategies are needed for effective stress 
management. Five such interventions are described below.
Role Clarification. This involves helping employees better understand the demands 
of their work roles. A manager’s role is embedded in a network of relationships with 
other managers, each of whom has specific expectations about how the manager 
should perform the role. Role clarification is a systematic process for revealing others’ 
expectations and arriving at a consensus about the activities constituting a particular 
role. There are several role clarification methods that follow a similar strategy.29 First, 
the people relevant to defining a particular role are identified (e.g., members of a 
managerial team, a boss and subordinate, and members of other departments relating 
to the role holder) and brought together at a meeting, usually in a location away from 
the organization.
Second, the role holder discusses his or her perceived job duties and responsibilities 
and the other participants are encouraged to comment on and to agree or disagree with 
the role holder’s perceptions. An OD practitioner may act as a process consultant to facili￾tate interaction and reduce defensiveness. Third, when everyone has reached consensus 
on defining the role, the role holder is responsible for writing a description of the activities 
that are seen now as constituting the role. A copy of the role description is distributed to 
all participants to ensure that they fully understand and agree with the role definition. 
Fourth, the participants periodically check to see whether the role is being performed as 
intended and make modifications if necessary.
Supportive Relationships. Building supportive relationships is aimed at helping 
employees cope with stress rather than at changing the stressors themselves. It involves 
establishing trusting and genuinely positive relationships among employees, including 
bosses, subordinates, and peers. Supportive relations have been a hallmark of organiza￾tion development and are a major part of such interventions as team building, inter￾group relations, employee involvement, work design, goal setting, and career planning 
and development. Considerable research shows that supportive relationships can buf￾fer people against stress.30 When people feel that relevant others really care about what 
happens to them and are willing to help, they can cope with stressful conditions.
Work Leaves. In the United States, employees work more hours and take less time off 
than in most other developed countries. For example, Americans worked an average CHAPTER 19 Managing Workforce Diversity and Wellness 485
of 1,878 hours per year while workers in the United Kingdom averaged 1,711, those in 
France averaged 1,532, and German workers averaged 1,467. Only Korean employees 
worked more than Americans. Similarly, other countries offer longer and more flexible 
work leave arrangements, with vacation minimums often subject to government mandate. 
The United States and Japan average ten days’ annual vacation, and the United Kingdom, 
France, and Germany average 22, 25, and 24 days, respectively.31 While some differences 
can be explained by cultural values or government policies, the potential to affect wellness 
through work leaves should not be ignored.
As organizations struggle to minimize the effects of work stress, paid and unpaid 
work leaves are receiving increasing attention. Paid leaves include vacation, holi￾days, personal days, as well as maternity and paternity leaves. The comparative 
statistics suggest that globalization may place increasing pressure on vacation allow￾ances. As with vacation time, the United States lags behind other countries in regard
to maternity and paternity leaves. Although the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA) 
guarantees parents a 12-week unpaid leave, and more people are taking advantage of 
FMLA unpaid leave, many employees cannot afford to take it, and firms at the top of 
Fortune’s “Best Companies to Work For” list have responded with paid maternity and 
paternity leaves.32 Another key work leave intervention is paid sabbaticals, typically 
received after a specified tenure of service. For example, Perkins Coie, a Seattle law firm 
with approximately 1,400 employees, offers eight-week paid sabbaticals. In one recent 
survey, 19% of companies, including Deloitte and Touche, Microsoft and Intel, offered 
sabbaticals, but only five percent with pay.33 Sabbaticals are a way of avoiding burnout 
and renewing employee creativity and commitment.
Unpaid leaves, or leaves of absence, also offer employees a chance to renew and to 
bring new experiences to the organization, while guaranteeing a job for them upon 
their return. For example, personal growth leaves or social service leaves may allow 
an employee to explore an individual interest or cause. Such a leave is an exchange, 
offering the employee a chance for time off, renewal, and pursuit of a given interest, 
while retaining a valued employee for the organization.
Health Facilities. A growing number of organizations are providing facilities for help￾ing employees cope with stress. Elaborate exercise facilities are maintained by such 
firms as Qualcomm, Xerox, Weyerhaeuser, Google, and PepsiCo, and a majority of 
the Fortune 500 operate corporate cardiovascular fitness programs. Employees at 
Aetna can earn a financial incentive for their involvement in weight management 
and fitness programs. Before starting such programs, employees must take an exercise 
tolerance test and have the approval of either a private or a company doctor. Each 
participant is then assigned a safe level of heart response to the various parts of the 
fitness program.
In addition to exercise facilities, some companies, such as McDonald’s and Equitable 
Life Assurance Society, provide biofeedback facilities in which managers take relax￾ation breaks using biofeedback devices to monitor respiration and heart rate. Feedback 
of such data helps managers lower their respiration and heart rates. Some companies 
provide time for employees to meditate, and other firms have stay-well programs that 
encourage healthy diets and lifestyles.
Employee Assistance Programs. This final stress and wellness intervention is an 
organizational intervention and a method for helping individuals directly. EAPs help 
identify, refer, and treat workers whose personal problems affect their performance.34
While some large companies still provide an in-house EAP, most outsource their EAPs. 
Initially started in the 1940s to combat alcoholism, these programs have expanded to 
deal with emotional, family, marital, and financial problems, and, more recently, drug 
abuse. For example, the 2002 National Survey on Drug Use and Health suggested that 486
71% of current illicit drug users aged 18 or older were working full- or part-time. 
Another study of workplace-related drug testing showed a decline in workplace drug 
use from 1998 to 1999, but a slight increase from 1999 to 2000.35 Alcohol and drug 
use costs U.S. business an estimated $102 billion per year in lost productivity, acci￾dents, and turnover.36 Britain’s Royal College of Psychiatrists warned that up to 30% 
of employees in British companies would experience mental health problems and that 
115 million workdays were lost each year as a result of depression.37 Other factors, too, 
have contributed to increased problems: altered family structures, the growth of single￾parent households, the increase in divorce, greater mobility, and changing modes of 
child rearing are all fairly recent phenomena that have added to the stress experienced 
by employees. These trends indicate that an increasing number of employees need 
assistance with personal problems, and the research suggests that EAP use increases 
during downsizing and restructuring.38
When other stress management interventions are not effective or when employees 
have particular types of wellness and/or health issues, employee assistance programs 
provide a means of responding to employee wellness problems, including extreme 
or chronic stress, drug and alcohol abuse, problems with child and/or elder care, 
grief, and financial problems.39 Central to the philosophy underlying EAPs is the 
belief that although the organization has no right to interfere in the private lives of 
its employees, it does have a right to impose certain standards of work performance 
and to establish sanctions when these are not met. Anyone whose work perfor￾mance is impaired because of a personal problem is eligible for admission into an 
EAP program. Successful EAPs have been implemented at General Motors, Johnson 
& Johnson, Motorola, Burlington Northern Railroad, and Dominion Foundries and 
Steel Company.
Numerous Web sites, including the Employee Assistance Professionals Association, 
share or provide at minimal cost detailed guidelines on establishing an EAP. These 
steps include developing an appropriate EAP policy, deciding to insource or outsource 
the program, communicating the program to organization members, and providing 
training on EAP use. Recent changes in health care privacy as a result of the Health 
Insurance Portability and Privacy Act (HIPAA) impact on EAPs, related health insur￾ance benefits, data requirements, and how such data and information can be used and 
shared.40
The Results of Stress Management and 
Wellness Interventions
The variety of stress management and wellness interventions makes it difficult to 
provide overall conclusions, but the numerous studies about stress and any particular 
intervention do add up to a positive recommendation. For example, the research on 
role clarification supports this intervention. One study found that it reduced stress and 
role ambiguity and increased job satisfaction.41 Another study reported that it improved 
interpersonal relationships among group members and contributed to improved pro￾duction and quality.42 Like many of the other studies in this area, the findings should 
be interpreted carefully because of weak research designs and perceptual measures.
The research on supportive relationships suggests that organizations must become 
more aware of their value in helping employees cope with stress. They may need to 
build supportive, cohesive work groups in situations that are particularly stressful, such 
as introducing new products, solving emergency problems, and handling customer 
complaints. For example, firms such as Procter & Gamble and the Hartford Financial 
Services Group have recognized that internal OD consultation can be extremely stress￾ful, and so they have encouraged internal OD practitioners to form support teams 
PART 5 Human Resource Management InterventionsCHAPTER 19 Managing Workforce Diversity and Wellness 487
to help each other cope with the demands of the role. Equally important, organiza￾tions need to direct more attention to ensuring that managers provide the support 
and encouragement necessary to help subordinates cope with stress. For example, 
Pepperdine University’s executive programs often include a module on helping subor￾dinates cope with stress, and firms are training managers to be more sensitive to stress 
and more supportive and helpful to subordinates.
Preliminary evidence suggests that fitness programs can reduce absenteeism and 
coronary risk factors, such as high blood pressure, body weight, percentage of body 
fat, and triglyceride levels.43 A review of the research, however, suggests that fitness 
programs primarily result in better mental health and resistance to stress and that such 
organizational improvements as reduced absenteeism and turnover and improved per￾formance are more uncertain.44
The amount of research on EAP-related issues is quite large, as a look through dedicated 
journals, such as the Journal for Workplace Behavioral Health or Employee Assistance Quarterly, 
will attest. There is less research on the overall impact of EAPs, although one study demon￾strated that EAPs can positively affect absenteeism, turnover, and job performance.45 Other 
researchers have been focusing on the integration of EAPs with work–life balance interven￾tions and broader wellness services.46
Application 19.2 describes the evolution of an EAP and wellness program at Johnson & 
Johnson and demonstrates how such programs can be implemented in large, decentral￾ized organizations.47
SUMMARY
This chapter presented two important human resources interventions: workforce 
diversity interventions and employee stress and wellness interventions. Like coach￾ing, career planning and development, and leadership development presented in 
Chapter 18, these change programs generally are carried out by human resources 
specialists but have become an important part of OD practice.
Workforce diversity interventions are designed to adapt human resources practices 
to an increasingly diverse workforce. Age, gender, race, sexual orientation, disability, 
and culture and value trends point to a more complex set of human resources demands. 
Within such a context, OD interventions (e.g., job design, performance management, 
and employee involvement practices) have to be adapted to a diverse set of personal 
preferences, needs, and lifestyles.
Employee stress and wellness interventions, such as work leaves and employee 
assistance programs, recognize the important link between worker health and orga￾nizational productivity. A model for understanding work-related stress includes 
occupational stressors; individual differences, which affect how people respond to 
the stressors; stress outcomes; and interventions to increase wellness or decrease 
stress. The two main steps in stress management are diagnosing stress and its causes, 
and alleviating stressors and helping people to cope with stress. Two methods for 
diagnosing stress are charting stressors and health profiling. Techniques for alle￾viating stressful conditions include role clarification and supportive relationships. 
Means for helping workers cope with stress are developing supportive relationships 
and participating in activities at health and fitness facilities. Finally, EAPs identify, 
refer, and treat employees and their families for such problems as marital difficulties, 
drug and alcohol abuse, emotional disturbances, and financial crises. EAPs not only 
preserve the dignity of the individual but also recognize the organization’s right to 
expect certain work behaviors.488 PART 5 Human Resource Management Interventions

Johnson & Johnson (J&J) is the most diversified 
health care corporation in the world. It grosses more 
than $36 billion a year and employs approximately 
101,800 people at 190 companies in 51 countries. 
The J&J companies are decentralized and directly 
responsible for their own operations. Corporate 
management is committed to this structure because 
of the many proven advantages to the businesses 
and people involved, such as the development of 
general managers, faster product development, 
and a closer connection with the customer. Its 
philosophy is embodied in a document called “Our 
Credo,” a section of which makes a commitment to 
the welfare of its employees.
J&J has a long history of commitment to health, 
wellness, and stress management programs. For 
example, based on a successful pilot project 
in its Ethicon division during the 1970s, J&J’s 
top management decided to implement EAPs 
throughout the rest of the company. The J&J 
EAPs were in-house treatment programs that 
offered employees and family members confiden￾tial, professional assistance for problems related 
to alcohol and drug abuse, as well as marital, 
family, emotional, and mental health difficul￾ties. The major goal was to help clients assume 
responsibility for their own behavior and, if it was 
destructive to themselves or others, to modify it. 
Employees could enter an EAP by self- referral 
or by counseling from their supervisor. The pro￾gram emphasized the necessity of maintaining 
complete confidentiality when counseling the 
employee or family member to protect both the 
client’s dignity and job.
The EAPs were implemented between 1980 and 
1985 in three phases. The first phase consisted of 
contacting the managers and directors of personnel 
for each of the decentralized divisions and assess￾ing their divisions’ EAP needs. An educational 
process was initiated to inform managers and 
directors about the EAP. This EAP training was 
then conducted in each of the personnel depart￾ments of the divisions. The second phase included 
a formal presentation to the management board 
of each division. It included information about the 
EAP and about an alcohol and drug component 
for executives. In the third phase, cost estimates 
were developed for EAP use and for employment 
of an EAP administrator to implement the pro￾gram in each division. In addition, the corporate 
director of assistance programs established a qual￾ity assurance program to review all EAP activities 
biennially.
Eventually, more than 90% of all domestic 
employees had direct access to an EAP, and the 
remaining employees had telephone access. There 
were EAPs at all major J&J locations through￾out the United States, Puerto Rico, and Canada. 
Programs also operated in Brazil and England. A 
study of J&J’s EAP in the New Jersey area showed 
that clients with drug abuse, emotional, or mental 
health problems who availed themselves of EAP 
services were treated at substantial savings to the 
company.
The EAPs were ultimately integrated with J&J’s 
original wellness program known as Live for Life. 
This program was initiated by the chairman of the 
board in 1979, when he committed to provide all 
employees and their families with the opportunity 
to become the healthiest employees of any corpo￾ration in the world. The program brought together 
experts in health care education, behavior change, 
and disease management to create a program to 
improve the health and productivity of workers. 
The Live for Life program offered classes in nutri￾tion, weight reduction, and smoking cessation. In 
addition, small gymnasiums with workout equip￾ment, aerobics rooms, and swimming pools were 
made available. In the late 1980s and 1990s the 
combined programs became known as Live for 
Life Assistance programs. Health, safety, benefits, 
wellness, and EAPs worked together to promote 
employee well-being in the workplace.
The current Johnson & Johnson Health and 
Wellness Program is an outgrowth of those early 
programs. It has undergone several transforma￾tions in the past two decades to respond to shift￾ing business requirements and changing employee 
health needs. The Johnson & Johnson Health and 
Wellness Program includes disability manage￾ment, occupational health, employee assistance, 
work–life programs, and wellness and fitness 
Johnson & Johnson’s Health 
and Wellness Program
application 19.2CHAPTER 19 Managing Workforce Diversity and Wellness 491
programs. The program is often studied by other 
corporations because of its integrated service 
deliveries.
In 1995, Johnson & Johnson’s health and fitness 
group took a simple step that catapulted par￾ticipation in the company’s wellness program from 
26% to 90%. Patricia Flynn, vice president of 
Johnson & Johnson’s health care system, described 
how J&J offered every employee a $500 health￾benefits credit in exchange for completing an 
annual health-risk assessment before enrolling in 
the plan. Although the company had offered the 
assessment optionally for years as part of its well￾ness program, it was not until the incentive was 
attached that employees flocked to it. “People think 
they are fit and might not want to bother with an 
assessment,” Flynn says. “This incentive got them 
to do it.”
In the past, organization members were given 
incentives for participating in various wellness 
programs, but the company’s focus has shifted 
all of its incentive dollars toward risk assessment. 
“We are confident that once employees know 
what their risks are, then we can make a posi￾tive impact on their health,” says Jennifer Bruno, 
director of business planning. Early studies con￾ducted at the company showed that even those 
employees who took the assessment but had no 
follow-up support through wellness programs 
showed improvements in their health.
But for Johnson & Johnson, the assessment is 
just the beginning. The aggregate data helps 
the health care group choose the right wellness 
programs for the exact needs of the population, 
Bruno says. The program developers aren’t guess￾ing at employees’ health interests or expecting 
them to know what programs they will benefit 
from, she says. They use the hard data to guide 
their wellness program choices. “We are making 
better use of our health care dollars, thanks to the 
assessment information.”
For example, the initial assessment showed that 
the employees had three areas of risk: high choles￾terol, high blood pressure, and inactivity. The com￾pany now regularly offers exercise and counseling 
programs to help employees reduce cholesterol and 
blood pressure and manage weight. Bruno says 
there are also subtle modifications to the work￾place environment that contribute to a healthy 
culture, such as nutritious choices in the cafeteria, 
scales in all of the bathrooms, and a nonsmoking 
environment.
Since the assessment and resulting wellness 
programs were implemented, costs have decreased 
significantly at Johnson & Johnson. Between 
1995 and 1999, medical care costs decreased by 
$225 per person due to lower administrative and 
medical utilization, an annual total savings of $8.5 
million. Participating employees had significantly 
lower medical expenses and improved health￾risk factors in categories such as high cholesterol, 
high blood pressure, and smoking. Importantly, 
the savings grew over time, with most of the sav￾ings attained in the third or fourth year after the 
program’s inception. For those employees who 
were discovered to be at high risk for a disease and 
then got their risk reduced, the savings was $390 
per year.
The Johnson & Johnson Health and Wellness 
program demonstrates a long-term commitment 
to its strategy, its industry, and its people. The 
execution and coordination of the different well￾ness components has paid off handsomely for 
many stakeholders.selected cases Scenario #1
“Pat, I just can’t do it. I know you want me to 
go to New York tonight, but I can’t make a 
trip like this at the last minute.”
“Chris, you are the best attorney we have for 
these negotiations—we need you.”
“I appreciate the compliment, but I can’t 
arrange the care for my mother and my daugh￾ter on four hours notice. I told you during my 
performance appraisal about the demands I am 
under—in terms of carrying my own workload 
and part of Sidney’s [a co-worker] during this 
parental leave time. In addition, like I said, I have 
two elderly parents, one needing daily care, 
my toddler daughter, and I am moving next 
week. I know you want me to progress and 
I appreciate it, but you know I work hard—I 
work overtime every week—but I can’t do 
what you want this time. I’m sorry. I’ll talk to 
you later.”
Pat hangs up the phone and thinks, “Okay, 
I know I am asking a lot, but how do I resolve 
these issues? It’s frustrating that Sidney is out 
on twelve weeks leave—geez!!!—and it’s only 
going to get worse. Chris is my best person . . . 
why isn’t Chris more committed? And doesn’t 
Sidney know that twelve weeks off creates 
hardships for everyone else? How can I get 
them to do more?”
Chris walks to the parking lot thinking, “Boy, 
I thought I made a good move in coming here. 
But Pat is worse than the partners I used to 
work for. What am I going to do? Oh well, at 
least the job market for attorneys is good.”
Scenario #2
“Francis, I appreciate your help these last few 
weeks. I never could have exceeded all my 
goals or facilitated my team exceeding its goal 
if you hadn’t connected me with Kyle’s Elder 
Care Referral Service. I feel like I would have 
had to take at least five to seven days off to 
gather the same information that Kyle had 
immediately available. And then I would have 
spent another week or two—not two days—
getting my dad settled. I don’t know why he 
decided to retire to Ireland, but he is delighted 
with the arrangements, and is doing well.”
“That’s okay, Blair, I’m happy to help. Thank 
you for the excellent job you’ve been doing. 
I really appreciate it. Let’s talk about next 
month’s key goals.”
Blair had been the project lead during the 
implementation of a new quality process in 
the laboratory, and despite an above-average 
workload the last month, had successfully 
met the project’s objectives. Francis thought, 
“It was touch and go when Blair’s dad suddenly 
wanted to retire to Ireland, and wanted to 
move immediately. Thank heaven I remem￾bered reading about Kyle and the Elder Care 
Referral Service.”
Blair left Francis’ office with a smile, thinking, 
“Francis is great to work for . . . I can’t even 
consider any of the calls I’m getting from 
other hospitals or headhunters. It’s just great 
to work for someone who understands that 
work is just one part of life.”
Scenario #3
Robin, department head for pediatrics at 
HealthCo’s second largest hospital, had asked 
to meet with Mercer, the director of pediatrics 
for HealthCo.
“Mercer, thanks for your time. As you know 
I’m fifty-six this year, and I want to talk to you 
about my retirement. I have many interests 
beyond my medical practice, and also want 
more time with my family and community. 
What I would like to do is begin working part￾time after this first year. What I’m thinking is 
that I would work thirty hours a week for two 
years, still holding clinic hours two days week. 
Then the next three to five years I would like 
Employee Benefits at HealthCoSELECTED CASES 493
to transition to full-time retirement. What 
I would like is to work twenty or so hours per 
week for those years, working with medical 
school students and on research projects.”
“Well, Robin, as you know, we don’t have any 
formal retirement policy except to fully retire. 
I’m going to have to talk to HR about this. You 
have extensive experience and expertise, and 
I don’t want to lose that. I’m just not sure 
what HR or the Physicians’ Council will say.”
“I understand. My first choice is to remain 
with HealthCo, but I know there are organiza￾tions that would be interested in my working 
part-time. When can you get back to me?”
“Give me a couple of weeks, Robin.”
“Okay.”
Mercer began to think about Robin’s request, 
already hearing HR raise issues like benefits, 
ongoing participation in retirement funding, and 
precedents being set. But Mercer didn’t want to 
lose Robin’s expertise. And Robin’s idea of 
working with the medical students might let 
HealthCo create a unique internship and resi￾dency experience, which would let HealthCo 
attract the top students.
BACKGROUND
The people in these three scenarios work for 
HealthCo, a fully integrated, nonprofit health 
care organization with nine major medical 
centers and thirty-six affiliated clinics, 
rehabilitation units, therapy facilities, hospice 
and geriatric units, and other highly specialized 
centers. Located in the eastern United States, 
HealthCo has about 6,700 employees. Like 
other health care companies, it employs a dis￾proportionate number of women, especially 
in nursing and patient care, allied health ser￾vices, and support staff. The backgrounds of 
Pat, Francis, and Mercer, all managers at 
HealthCo, are provided below.
Pat is the chief counsel of HealthCo’s internal 
legal department. Pat has worked for HealthCo 
for five years, after fifteen years in a major 
law firm in Washington, D.C. It has been a 
difficult transition from the “do-anything, 
24/7” pace of the firm to the “slower, less 
professional” pace of HealthCo. Pat is married 
and has three kids. Pat’s spouse is also an 
attorney. Pat’s staff is primarily full-time and 
works “nine to five.” The department is very 
busy, often with a workload that significantly 
exceeds the day-to-day capacity of the staff.
Francis serves as the director of laboratory ser￾vices for the largest hospital. The laboratory is 
staffed around the clock and can be called on 
to perform routine and emergency procedures 
at any time. The new quality process that Blair 
helped to implement was critical to the lab 
supporting the hospital’s status as the primary 
emergency and critical-care facility in the 
region. Francis, who had started in a research 
lab prior to joining HealthCo, felt the pressure 
of staffing a 24/7 lab. Having never married, 
Francis could not imagine juggling marriage 
and children in addition to the demands of 
having two parents and five siblings and their 
families living nearby. Francis tried to help the 
lab’s employees with family or life demands, 
but did so on a personal basis, and not because 
the hospital had many such benefits 
available.
Mercer is a nationally known pediatrician 
with fifteen years experience, and was recently 
hired to head HealthCo’s pediatrics organiza￾tion. Mercer’s expertise and management 
capabilities were stretched in a positive way 
by the demands of such a large and compre￾hensive pediatric practice. Thriving on that 
challenge, Mercer had been very successful 
since taking over the organization. Marrying 
after medical school to another physician, 
Mercer felt grateful for being able to work the 
hours required to fully learn and understand 
this new position. Mercer knew a number of 
people on the pediatric staff, including a 
number of the pediatricians. Many of them 
felt Mercer worked way too much, and more￾over, worried Mercer expected the same of 
them. Mercer knew that younger physicians 494 PART 5 Human Resource Management Interventions
weren’t as keen on the 24/7 doctor lifestyle 
that Mercer’s father had lived.
RECENT EVENTS
A couple of weeks after Pat’s conversation 
with Chris, Francis’ with Blair, and Mercer’s 
with Robin, a senior staff meeting was called 
to discuss current issues and the coming year’s 
strategic initiatives. The CEO, Dr. Palmer, 
recently had became focused on employee 
retention, after Human Resources reported 
that HealthCo’s turnover was 1.5 times the 
industry average. While HealthCo was 
competitive about salary, benefits seemed to 
be an area needing improvement. Further, the 
recent issue of Fortune, which identified the 
“Best Companies to Work For,” raised 
Dr. Palmer’s awareness of the growing impor￾tance of work–life programs and policies.
Dr. Palmer realized that HealthCo did not pro￾vide many of the benefits offered by these 
“best companies.” In fact, very few health care 
companies made the list. Palmer conceded 
that the twenty-four hours a day, seven days 
a week nature of health care organizations 
probably complicated the provision of work–
life benefits. However, Palmer also saw a 
potential competitive advantage in being a 
leader in providing such benefits, especially 
when combined with the competitive salary 
and merit structure HealthCo offered. 
Dr. Palmer remembered that a survey had 
been done of HealthCo female employees by 
an outside research team, and that one area of 
the survey was work–life issues. A review of 
the data revealed a number of benefits seen as 
important to the female employees of HealthCo 
(see Table 1). The research also had suggested 
that the immediate supervisor played a vital 
role in the employee’s ability to successfully 
balance work and life, and the employee’s sat￾isfaction with her work–life balance. An imme￾diate supervisor’s direct support of work–life 
balance was significantly linked to other 
important outcomes, such as job satisfaction, 
organizational commitment, and intent to 
leave the organization.
Dr. Palmer raised the question of offering 
work–life benefits at the senior staff meeting. 
Dr. Palmer noted that while funding was not 
unlimited, of course, HealthCo’s recent 
financial performance would permit budget 
allocations to such benefits, and might also be 
offset by reduced turnover costs or improved 
productivity.
Pat immediately stated, “I can barely get my 
staff together now with all the work we have 
going on. And, I certainly can’t hold their 
hands. They would never be coddled this way 
in a law firm. People work the hours needed, 
no questions asked.” Francis said, “I can see 
the difference such benefits would make, but 
how do I make this work in a 24/7 department? 
While Legal might see it as difficult, I see it as 
impossible, especially any movement away 
from traditional shifts.” A nursing director 
commented thoughtfully, “Some hospitals are 
considering shorter, split shifts, and longer 
shifts to create flexibility—there might be 
something to that.” A number of departments 
immediately argued such scheduling was a 
leader’s nightmare, and that the company’s 
existing two hours of flextime in a number of 
departments created serious issues. The V.P. of 
finance for the hospital spoke up, “I don’t see 
why people with children should be treated 
differently—it’s their choice to have children. 
I have a life, too, and you don’t see me asking 
for special arrangements. I have employees 
asking me to work from home—how do 
I appraise their performance if they primarily 
work at home?” Mercer thought about Robin’s 
request, wondering if other baby-boomer 
emp loyees would soon be making similar 
requests.
Dr. Palmer listened to what was quickly 
becoming a heated discussion, noting the var￾ied and complicated reactions of the different 
directors, vice presidents, and other top leaders 
of the organization. Dr. Palmer commented, SELECTED CASES 495

Strategic Change Interventions
part 6Transformational Change
This chapter presents interventions for trans￾forming organizations—that is, for changing the 
basic character of the organization, including 
how it is structured and how it relates to its envi￾ronment. These frame-breaking and sometimes 
revolutionary interventions go beyond improv￾ing the organization incrementally, focusing 
instead on changing the way it views itself 
and its environment. They bring about impor￾tant alignments between the organization and 
its competi tive environment and among the 
organization’s strategy, design elements, and 
culture.
Transformational change can occur in res￾ponse to or in anticipation of major changes in 
the organization’s environment or technology. 
In addition, these changes often are associated 
with significant revision of the firm’s business 
strategy, which, in turn, may require modifying 
internal structures and processes as well as its 
corporate culture to support the new direction. 
Such fundamental change entails a new para￾digm for organizing and managing organiza￾tions. It involves qualitatively different ways of 
perceiving, thinking, and behaving in organiza￾tions. Movement toward this new way of operat￾ing requires senior executives to take an active 
leadership role. The change process is charac￾terized by considerable innovation as members 
discover new ways of improving the organiza￾tion and adapting it to changing conditions.
Transformational change is an emerging part 
of organization development, and there is some 
confusion about its meaning and definition. This 
chapter starts with a description of several major 
features of transformational change. Against 
this background, three kinds of interventions 
are discussed: integrated strategic change, 
organization design, and culture change.
Integrated strategic change is a compre￾hensive OD intervention aimed at a single 
organization or business unit. It suggests that 
business strategy and organization design must 
be aligned and changed together to respond 
to external and internal disruptions. A strategic 
change plan helps members manage the tran￾sition between the current strategic orientation 
and the desired future strategic orientation.
Organization design addresses the different 
elements that comprise the “architecture” of the 
organization, including structure, work design, 
human resources practices, and manage ment 
and information systems. It seeks to fit or align 
these components with each other so they direct 
members’ behaviors in a strategic direction.
An organization’s culture is the pattern of 
assumptions, values, and norms that are more 
or less shared by organization members. A grow￾ing body of research has shown that culture can 
affect strategy formulation and implementation 
as well as the firm’s ability to achieve high levels 
of performance. Culture change involves help￾ing senior executives and administrators diag￾nose the existing culture and make necessary 
alterations in the basic assumptions and values 
underlying organizational behaviors.
CHARACTERISTICS OF TRANSFORMATIONAL CHANGE
As the twenty-first century unfolds, a large number of organizations are radically 
altering how they operate and relate to their environments.1
 Increased global com￾petition is forcing many organizations to downsize or consolidate and become leaner, 
more efficient, and flexible. Deregulation is pushing firms in the financial services, 
20506 PART 6 Strategic Change Interventions
telecommunications, and airline industries to rethink business strategies and reshape 
how they operate. Public demand for less government intervention and lowered defi￾cits is forcing public sector agencies to streamline operations and to deliver more for 
less. Rapid changes in technologies render many organizational practices obsolete, 
pushing firms to be continually innovative and nimble.
Organization transformation implies radical changes in how members perceive, 
think, and behave at work. These changes go far beyond making the existing organi￾zation better or fine-tuning the status quo. They are concerned with fundamentally 
altering the prevailing assumptions about how the organization functions and relates 
to its environment. Changing these assumptions entails significant shifts in corporate 
values and norms and in the structures and organizational arrangements that shape 
members’ behaviors. Not only is the magnitude of change greater, but the change 
fundamentally alters the qualitative nature of the organization.
Change Is Triggered by Environmental and Internal Disruptions
Organizations are unlikely to undertake transformational change unless significant 
reasons to do so emerge. Power, emotion, and expertise are vested in the existing 
organizational arrangements, and when faced with problems, organizations are more 
likely to fine-tune those structures than to alter them drastically. Thus, in most cases, 
organizations must experience or anticipate a severe threat to survival before they will 
be motivated to undertake transformational change.2
 Such threats arise when envi￾ronmental and internal changes render existing organizational strategies and designs 
obsolete. The changes threaten the very existence of the organization as it presently is 
constituted.
In studying a large number of organization transformations, Tushman, Newman, 
and Romanelli showed that transformational change occurs in response to at least 
three kinds of disruption:3
Industry discontinuities—sharp changes in legal, political, economic, and tech￾nological conditions that shift the basis for competition within an industry
Product life cycle shifts—changes in product life cycle that require different 
business strategies
Internal company dynamics—changes in size, corporate portfolio strategy, or 
executive turnover.
These disruptions severely jolt organizations and push them to question their business 
strategy and, in turn, their mission, values, structure, systems, and procedures.
Change Is Aimed at Competitive Advantage
Transformational change is concerned with choices organizations make to improve 
their competitive performance. To establish a competitive advantage, organizations 
must achieve a favored position vis-à-vis their competitors or perform internally in 
ways that are unique, valuable, and difficult to imitate.4
 Although typically associated 
with for-profit firms, these competitive criteria can also apply to nonprofit and gov￾ernmental organizations. Activities that are unique, valuable, and difficult to imitate 
enhance the organization’s performance by establishing a competitive advantage over 
its rivals.
Uniqueness All organizations possess a unique bundle of resources and processes
which, individually or in combination, represent the source of competitive advantage. 
An important task in transformational change is to understand these unique organi￾zational features. For example, resources can be financial, such as access to low-cost

capital; reputational, such as brand image or a history of product quality; technological, 
such as patents, know-how, or a strong research and development department; and 
human, such as excellent labor–management relationships or employees with scarce 
and valuable skills. Apple’s reputation as a leading-edge innovator of consumer elec￾tronic products, such as the iPod and iPhone, makes a powerful case for how resources 
alone can represent a unique advantage.
An organization’s processes—regular patterns of organizational activity involving 
a sequence of tasks performed by individuals5
—use resources to produce goods and 
services. For example, a software development process combines computer resources, 
programming languages, typing skills, knowledge of computer languages, and customer 
requirements to produce a new software application. Other organizational processes 
include new product development, strategic planning, appraising member perfor￾mance, making sales calls, fulfilling customer orders, and the like. When resources and 
processes are formed into capabilities that allow the organization to perform complex 
activities better than others, a distinctive competence is identified.6
 Collins found that 
a key determinant in an organization’s transition from “good to great” was a clear 
understanding and commitment to the one thing an organization does better than 
anyone else.7
Value Organizations achieve competitive advantage when their unique resources 
and processes are arranged in such a way that products or services either warrant 
a higher-than-average price or are exceptionally low in cost. Both advantages are 
valuable according to a performance/price criterion. Products and services with 
highly desirable features or capabilities, although expensive, are valuable because of 
their ability to satisfy customer demands for high quality or some other performance 
dimension. BMW automobiles are valuable because the perceived benefits of superior 
handling exceed the price paid. On the other hand, outputs that cost little to pro￾duce are valuable because of their ability to satisfy customer demands at a low price. 
Hyundai automobiles are valuable because they provide basic transportation at a low 
price. BMW and Hyundai are both profitable, but they achieve that outcome through 
different value propositions.
Difficult to Imitate Finally, competitive advantage is sustainable when unique and 
valuable resources and processes are difficult to mimic or duplicate by other organiza￾tions.8
 Organizations have devised a number of methods for making imitation difficult. 
For example, they can protect their competitive advantage by making it difficult for 
other firms to identify their distinctive competence. Disclosing unimportant informa￾tion at trade shows or forgoing superior profits can make it difficult for competitors to 
identify an organization’s strengths. Organizations also can aggressively pursue a range 
of opportunities, thus raising the cost for competitors who try to replicate their suc￾cess. Finally, organizations can seek to retain key human resources through attractive 
compensation and reward practices like those described in Chapter 17, thereby making 
it more difficult and costly for competitors to attract such talent.
The success of a competitive strategy depends on organization responses that result 
in unique, valuable, and difficult-to-imitate advantages. Transformational change 
assists organizations in developing these advantages and managing strategic change.
Change Is Systemic and Revolutionary
Transformational change involves reshaping the organization’s design elements and 
culture. These changes can be characterized as systemic and revolutionary because the 
entire nature of the organization is altered fundamentally. Typically driven by senior 
executives, change may occur rapidly so that it does not get mired in politics, individ￾ual resistance, and other forms of organizational inertia.9
 This is particularly pertinent 508 PART 6 Strategic Change Interventions
to changing the different features of the organization, such as structure, information 
systems, human resources practices, and work design. These features tend to reinforce 
one another, thus making it difficult to change them in a piecemeal manner.10 They 
need to be changed together and in a coordinated fashion so that they can mutually 
support each other and the new cultural values and assumptions.11 Ultimately, these 
changes should motivate and direct people’s behavior in a new strategic direction. 
They are considered transformational when a majority of individuals in an organiza￾tion change their behavior.12
Long-term studies of organizational evolution underscore the revolutionary nature 
of transformational change.13 They suggest that organizations typically move through 
relatively long periods of smooth growth and operation. These periods of convergence 
or evolution are characterized by incremental changes. At times, however, most 
organizations experience severe external or internal disruptions that render existing 
organizational arrangements ineffective. Successful firms respond to these threats to 
survival by transforming themselves to fit the new conditions. These periods of total 
system and quantum changes represent abrupt shifts in the organization’s structure, 
culture, and processes. If successful, the shifts enable the organization to experience 
another long period of smooth functioning until the next disruption signals the need 
for drastic change.14
These studies of organization evolution and revolution point to the benefits of 
implementing transformational change as rapidly as possible. The faster the organiza￾tion can respond to disruptions, the quicker it can attain the benefits of operating in a 
new way. Rapid change enables the organization to reach a period of smooth growth 
and functioning sooner, thus providing it with a competitive advantage over those 
firms that change more slowly.
Change Demands a New Organizing Paradigm
Organizations undertaking transformational change are, by definition, involved in 
second-order or gamma types of change.15 Gamma change involves discontinuous shifts 
in mental or organizational frameworks.16 Creative metaphors, such as “organization 
learning” or “continuous improvement,” are often used to help members visual￾ize the new paradigm.17 Increases in technological change, concern for quality, and 
worker participation have led many organizations to shift their organizing paradigm. 
Characterized as the transition from a “control-based” to a “commitment-based” orga￾nization, the features of the new paradigm include leaner, more flexible structures; 
information and decision making pushed down to the lowest levels; decentralized 
teams and business units accountable for specific products, services, or customers; and 
participative management and teamwork. This new organizing paradigm is well suited 
to changing conditions.
Change Is Driven by Senior Executives and Line Management
A key feature of transformational change is the active role of senior executives and line 
managers in all phases of the change process.18 They are responsible for the strategic 
direction and operation of the organization and actively lead the transformation. They 
decide when to initiate transformational change, what the change should be, how it 
should be implemented, and who should be responsible for directing it. Because exist￾ing executives may lack the talent, energy, and commitment to undertake these tasks, 
they may be replaced by outsiders who are recruited to lead the change. Research on 
transformational change suggests that externally recruited executives are three times 
more likely to initiate such change than are existing executives.19
The critical role of executive leadership in transformational change is clearly emerg￾ing. Lucid accounts of transformational leaders describe how executives, such as Jack CHAPTER 20 Transformational Change 509
Welch at General Electric, Lou Gerstner at IBM, and Sir Colin Marshall at British 
Airways, actively managed both the organizational and personal dynamics of transfor￾mational change.20 The work of Nadler, Tushman, and others points to three key roles 
for executive leadership of such change:21
Envisioning. Executives must articulate a clear and credible vision of the new 
strategic orientation. They also must set new and difficult standards for perfor￾mance, and generate pride in past accomplishments and enthusiasm for the new 
strategy.
Energizing. Executives must demonstrate personal excitement for the changes 
and model the behaviors that are expected of others. Behavioral integrity, cred￾ibility, and “walking the talk” are important ingredients.22 They must communicate 
examples of early success to mobilize energy for change.
Enabling. Executives must provide the resources necessary for undertaking signif￾icant change and use rewards to reinforce new behaviors. Leaders also must build 
an effective top-management team to manage the new organization and develop 
management practices to support the change process.
Change Involves Significant Learning
Transformational change requires much learning and innovation.23 Organizational 
members must learn how to enact the new behaviors required to implement new 
strategic directions. This typically involves trying new behaviors, assessing their 
consequences, and modifying them if necessary. Because members usually must learn 
qualitatively different ways of perceiving, thinking, and behaving, the learning process 
is likely to be substantial and to involve much unlearning. It is directed by a vision of the 
future organization and by the values and norms needed to support it. Learning occurs 
at all levels of the organization, from senior executives to lower-level employees.
Because the environment itself is likely to be changing during the change process, 
transformational change rarely has a delimited time frame but is likely to persist as 
long as the firm needs to adapt to change. Learning how to manage change continu￾ously can help the organization keep pace with a dynamic environment. It can provide 
the built-in capacity to fit the organization continually to its environment. Chapter 21 
presents OD interventions for helping organizations gain this capability for continuous 
change and learning.
INTEGRATED STRATEGIC CHANGE
Integrated strategic change (ISC) extends traditional OD processes into the content￾oriented discipline of strategic management. It is a deliberate, coordinated process 
that leads gradually or radically to systemic realignments between the environment 
and a firm’s strategic orientation, and that results in improvement in performance 
and effectiveness.24
The ISC process was initially developed by Worley, Hitchin, and Ross in response 
to managers’ complaints that good business strategies often are not implemented.25
Research suggests that too little attention is given to the change process and human 
resources issues necessary to execute strategy.26 The predominant paradigm in stra￾tegic management—formulation and implementation—artificially separates strate￾gic thinking from operational and tactical actions; it ignores the contributions that 
planned change processes can make to implementation.27 In the traditional process, 
senior managers and strategic planning staff prepare economic forecasts, competi￾tor analyses, and market studies. They discuss these studies and rationally align the 
firm’s strengths and weaknesses with environmental opportunities and threats to 
1.

3.510 PART 6 Strategic Change Interventions
form the organization’s strategy.28 Then, implementation occurs as middle managers, 
supervisors, and employees hear about the new strategy through memos, restructur￾ing announcements, changes in job responsibilities, or new departmental objectives. 
Consequently, because participation has been limited to top management, there is little 
understanding of the need for change and little ownership of the new behaviors, initia￾tives, and tactics required to achieve the announced objectives.
Key Features ISC, in contrast to the traditional process, was designed to be a highly 
participative process. It has three key features:29
The relevant unit of analysis is the organization’s strategic orientation comprising its 
strategy and organization design. Strategy and the design that supports it must be 
considered as an integrated whole.
Creating the strategic plan, gaining commitment and support for it, planning its 
implementation, and executing it are treated as one integrated process. The ability 
to repeat such a process quickly and effectively when conditions warrant is valu￾able, rare, and difficult to imitate. Thus, a strategic change capability represents a 
sustainable competitive advantage.30
Individuals and groups throughout the organization are integrated into the analysis, 
planning, and implementation process to create a more achievable plan, to maintain 
the firm’s strategic focus, to direct attention and resources on the organization’s key 
competencies, to improve coordination and integration within the organization, and 
to create higher levels of shared ownership and commitment.
Application Stages The ISC process is applied in four phases: performing a strategic
analysis, exercising strategic choice, designing a strategic change plan, and implement￾ing the plan. The four steps are discussed sequentially here but actually unfold in 
overlapping and integrated ways. Figure 20.1 displays the steps in the ISC process and 
its change components. An organization’s existing strategic orientation, identified as

its current strategy (S1) and organization design (O1

orientation (S2
/O2
) by the strategic change plan.
Performing the strategic analysis. The ISC process begins with a diagnosis of the 
organization’s readiness for change and its current strategy and organization design 
(S1
/O1
). The most important indicator of readiness is senior management’s willing￾ness and ability to carry out strategic change. Greiner and Schein suggest that the 
two key dimensions in this analysis are the leader’s willingness and commitment 
to change and the senior team’s willingness and ability to follow the leader’s initia￾tive.31 Organizations whose leaders are not willing to lead and whose senior manag￾ers are not willing and able to support the new strategic direction when necessary 
should consider team-building processes to ensure their commitment.
The second stage in strategic analysis is understanding the current strategy and 
organization design. The process begins with an examination of the organization’s
industry as well as its current financial performance and effectiveness. This infor￾mation provides the necessary context to assess the current strategic orientation’s 
viability. Porter’s model of industry attractiveness32 and the environmental 
framework introduced in Chapter 5 are the two most relevant models for analyz￾ing the environment.
Next, the current strategic orientation is described to explain current levels of 
performance and human outcomes. Several models for guiding this diagnosis exist.33
For example, the organization’s current strategy, structure, and processes can be 
assessed according to the model and methods introduced in Chapter 5. A metaphor 
or other label that describes how the organization’s mission, objectives, and 
business policies lead to improved performance can be used to represent strategy. 
3M’s traditional strategy of “differentiation” aptly summarizes its mission to solve 
unsolved problems innovatively, its goal of having a large percentage of current 
revenues come from products developed in the last five years, and its policies that 
support innovation, such as encouraging engineers to spend up to 15% of their 
time on new projects. An organization’s objectives, policies, and budgets signal 
which parts of the environment are important, and allocate and direct resources to 
particular environmental relationships.34 Intel’s new-product development objec￾tives and allocation of more than 20% of revenues to research and development 
signal the importance of its linkage to the technological environment.
The organization’s design is described by the structure, work design, informa￾tion system, and human resources system. Other models for understanding the 
organization’s strategic orientation include the competitive positioning model35
and other typologies.36 These frameworks assist in assessing customer satisfaction; 
product and service offerings; financial health; technological capabilities; and orga￾nizational culture, structure, and systems.
The strategic analysis process actively involves organization members. Large 
group conferences; employee focus groups; interviews with salespeople, custom￾ers, and purchasing agents; and other methods allow a variety of employees and 
managers to participate in the diagnosis and increase the amount and relevance 
of the data collected. This builds commitment to and ownership of the analysis; 
should a strategic change effort result, members are more likely to understand why 
and be supportive of it.
Exercising strategic choice. Once the existing strategic orientation is understood, 
a new one must be designed. For example, the strategic analysis might reveal mis￾fits among the organization’s environment, strategic orientation, and performance. 
These misfits can be used as inputs for crafting the future strategy and organiza￾tion design. Based on this analysis, senior management formulates visions for the 
future and broadly defines two or three alternative sets of strategies and objectives 
1.
2.512
for achieving those visions. Market forecasts, employees’ readiness and willingness 
to change, competitor analyses, and other projections can be used to develop the 
alternative future scenarios.37 The different sets of strategies and objectives also 
include projections about the organization design changes that will be necessary to 
support each alternative. Although participation from other organizational stake￾holders is important in the alternative generation phase, choosing the appropri￾ate strategic orientation ultimately rests with top management and cannot easily 
be delegated. Senior executives are in the unique position of viewing a strategy 
from a general-management position. When major strategic decisions are given to 
lower-level managers, the risk of focusing too narrowly on a product, market, or 
technology increases.
This step determines the content or “what” of strategic change. The desired 
strategy (S2
) defines the products or services to offer, the markets to be served, and 
the way these outputs will be produced and positioned. The desired organization 
design (O2
) specifies the organization structures and processes necessary to support 
the new strategy. Aligning an organization’s design with a particular strategy can 
be a major source of superior performance and competitive advantage.38
Designing the strategic change plan. The strategic change plan is a comprehen￾sive agenda for moving the organization from its current strategy and organization 
design to the desired future strategic orientation. It represents the process or “how” 
of strategic change. The change plan describes the types, magnitude, and schedule 
of change activities, as well as the costs associated with them. It also specifies how 
the changes will be implemented, given power and political issues; the nature of 
the organizational culture; and the current ability of the organization to implement 
change.39
Implementing the plan. The final step in the ISC process is the actual 
implementation of the strategic change plan. This draws heavily on knowledge 
of motivation, group dynamics, and change processes. It deals continuously with 
such issues as alignment, adaptability, teamwork, and organizational and personal 
learning. Implementation requires senior managers to champion the different 
elements of the change plan. They can, for example, initiate action and allocate 
resources to particular activities, set high but achievable goals, and provide feed￾back on accomplishments. In addition, leaders must hold people accountable to the 
change objectives, institutionalize the changes that occur, and be prepared to solve 
problems as they arise. This final point recognizes that no strategic change plan 
can account for all of the contingencies that emerge. There must be a willingness 
to adjust the plan as implementation unfolds to address unforeseen and unpredict￾able events and to take advantage of new opportunities.
Application 20.1 describes an integrated strategic change process at Microsoft Canada 
and demonstrates how the process was refined over time as the organization built its 
capability in strategic management.
ORGANIZATION DESIGN
Organization design configures the organization’s structure, work design, human 
resources practices, and management and information systems to guide members’ 
behaviors in a strategic direction. This intervention typically occurs in response to a 
major change in the organization’s strategy that requires fundamentally new ways 
for the organization to function and members to behave. It involves many of the 
organizational features discussed in previous chapters such as restructuring organ￾izations (Chapter 14), work design (Chapter 16), and performance management 
(Chapter 17). Because they all significantly affect member behavior, organization

PART 6 Strategic Change InterventionsManaging Strategic Change 
at Microsoft Canada
Microsoft Canada is a subsidiary of the Microsoft 
Corporation responsible for the marketing, sales, 
and service of the full range of software products, 
including the Windows operating systems, the 
Office productivity suite, a variety of .Net products, 
and the Xbox video game console. The organization 
marketed to a variety of segments, such as software 
application developers, small and medium busi￾ness, and large enterprises, through a broad range 
of partners that worked directly with the client 
organizations to install and optimize the software’s 
use. A small service organization, along with the 
partner, provided consulting support to clients.
Prior to 2001, Microsoft Canada had been part of 
the North American subsidiary. Under this struc￾ture, the large U.S. market was clearly the focus 
of attention for Microsoft’s server, desktop, and 
other software products. However, Frank Clegg, 
President of Microsoft Canada, argued that the 
Canadian market was different and underdevel￾oped. It had a different mix of customers than did 
the United States, different competitors, and differ￾ent growth opportunities. Moreover, software sales 
and personal computer shipments as a percentage 
of the market’s size and growth were below world￾wide averages. These differences, Clegg argued, 
warranted a specialized strategy.
As the fiscal year ended, Clegg and his newly appoint￾ed Director of Strategic Planning, Sandra Palmero, 
wanted to seize the opportunity to define a uniquely 
Canadian strategy. Prior to becoming Director of 
Strategic Planning, Palmero had been Director 
of Marketing and Corporate Communications in 
Microsoft Canada. There, with Richard Reynolds, 
her senior marketing manager, they had crafted 
and implemented a participative process of strategic 
planning. Palmero contacted the OD practitioner 
who had worked with them and contracted to 
design and implement a strategic planning process 
for the Canadian organization. Over a two-month 
period, Palmero conceived of a series of workshops 
involving the Canadian Leadership Team (CLT). 
This team represented a broad cross section of the 
organization, including representatives from the 
legal staff, human resources, Microsoft’s consulting 
and service business, marketing managers, customer 
support, and managers responsible for different seg￾ments of Microsoft’s business, including enterprise 
customers, small and medium business, Xbox, and 
the Microsoft Network (MSN).
The strategic analysis phase consisted of prelimi￾nary work by several members of the CLT as well 
as initial exercises during the first workshop. 
Members of the CLT each prepared an analysis of 
their respective area of responsibility. For example, 
the enterprise sales manager provided historical 
growth rates in revenues, developed forecasts for 
market growth and Microsoft’s share, described 
current levels of customer satisfaction, and a tech￾nology road map of products being developed by 
the Redmond headquarters organization. In addi￾tion to these specific analyses, Palmero contracted 
with a market-research firm to provide overall 
descriptions of the Canadian information technol￾ogy market. Finally, a competitor analysis was 
performed to develop an understanding of likely 
strategies, goals, and initiatives from key competi￾tors such as IBM, Oracle, and Sun Microsystems, as 
well as the competitive threat posed by the Linux 
operating system software.
During the first workshop, the CLT used the pre￾work data to perform an environmental scan. They 
discussed, debated, and ultimately came to some 
agreements about the trends affecting the organi￾zation. Based on that scan, the group engaged in 
a vision and value formulation exercise and set 
out an initial list of short- and long-term goals. 
These activities led to several important decisions 
for the new marketing organization. For example, 
the vision and values exercise produced impor￾tant insights about what the Canadian organiza￾tion stood for, its uniqueness compared to other 
marketing subsidiaries within the Microsoft organi￾zation, and its strengths in competing as a Canadian 
organization. The values also informed discussions 
about future goals and the strategy for achiev￾ing them. Importantly, the Canadian leadership 
realized that customer loyalty would and should 
become a driving force for the organization. This 
realization led to passionate discussions about the 
relative emphasis in the organization on revenues 
versus customer satisfaction and loyalty. It also led 
application 20.1514 PART 6 Strategic Change Interventions
to the development of a Big Hairy Audacious Goal 
(BHAG) that the members of the CLT believed 
would be challenging but achievable.
The first workshop ended with a number of assign￾ments, unresolved issues, and excitement about 
the future. In between the first and second work￾shops, members of the CLT worked with their own 
organizations. Issues, decisions, and questions that 
were addressed within the CLT were discussed 
throughout the organization. The most important 
discussion concerned the BHAG and the relative 
emphasis of revenues and customer loyalty over 
the short and the long term. A consensus began 
to emerge that the right and proper strategy for 
Microsoft Canada was to argue for a slower growth 
rate in revenues in the short term, invest in cus￾tomer satisfaction and loyalty, and then leverage 
that loyalty for a more secure stream of revenues 
in the future.
Frank Clegg took this idea to the executives in 
Redmond and discussed the implications of this 
strategy, including revenue projections, budget 
implications, the risks involved, and how the strat￾egy aligned with corporate and other marketing 
organizations’ initiatives. The results of these con￾versations became the subject of opening discus￾sions at the second workshop.
The cautious but positive support from the corpo￾rate organization allowed the CLT to move forward 
on its strategic intent. In the second workshop, the 
organization’s mission and values were finalized, 
year-by-year revenue goals were agreed upon to 
achieve the BHAG, and these goals were broken 
down and assigned to specific groups and managers. 
Finally, key customer and partner-loyalty programs 
were established and outlined. Ownership for the 
different initiatives was assigned and a strategic 
change plan emerged. Clegg pressed the group on 
its decision to emphasize customer loyalty and 
challenged the group with several scenarios that 
tempted them to trade off satisfaction for revenue. 
These scenarios helped cement the CLT’s commit￾ment to their strategy.
An important part of the strategic change plan that 
emerged was a discussion and decision to tie the 
individual performance appraisals of CLT members 
to the achievement of both revenue and customer 
satisfaction goals. The CLT as a whole also staked 
their end-of-fiscal-year bonuses to the achieve￾ment of customer satisfaction, rather than revenue 
goals.
The strategic change efforts at Microsoft Canada are 
important for several reasons. First, the Canadian 
organization’s realization of the importance of 
customer satisfaction and loyalty was influential in 
moving the larger Microsoft Corporation to exam￾ine its values in this area. Business Week reported 
on the changes Steve Ballmer was making in the 
organization; they reflected the increased impor￾tance of customer loyalty in Microsoft’s strategy 
and structure changes. Second, the organization 
learned how to organize a strategic planning effort. 
In the two years since this effort began, Sandra 
Palmero has built a stronger strategic planning 
organization and has taken more and more respon￾sibility for driving the strategic planning process. 
Even as the corporate Microsoft organization was 
making important changes in its reporting struc￾ture, financial systems, and business processes, the 
Canadian organization was able to adapt using its 
own resources and knowledge. Finally, the BHAG 
has become an institutionalized part of the organi￾zation that drives thinking and decision making in 
the organization.
design constructs them to fit with each other so they all mutually reinforce the 
desired behavior in the new strategic direction. This comprehensive intervention 
contrasts sharply with piecemeal approaches that address the design elements sepa￾rately and thus risk misaligning them with each other and sending mixed signals 
about desired behaviors. For example, many organizations have experienced prob￾lems implementing team-based structures because their existing information and 
reward systems emphasize individual-based performance.CHAPTER 20 Transformational Change 515
Conceptual Framework
A key notion in organization design is “fit,” “congruence,” or “alignment” among the 
organizational elements.40 Figure 20.2 presents a systems model showing the differ￾ent components of organization design and the interdependencies among them. It 
highlights the idea that the organization is designed to support a particular strategy 
(strategic fit) and that the different design elements must be aligned with each other 
and all work together to guide members’ behavior in that strategic direction (design 
fit). Research shows that the better these fits, the more effective the organization is 
likely to be.41
Most of the design components have been described previously in this book, so they 
are reviewed briefly below.
Strategy determines how the organization will use its resources to gain compe titive 
advantage. It may focus on introducing new products and services (innovation strat￾egy), controlling costs and reducing prices (cost-minimization strategy), or some 
combination of both (imitation strategy). Strategy sets the direction for organization 
design by identifying the criteria for making design choices and the organizational 
capabilities needed to make the strategy happen.
Structure has to do with how the organization divides tasks, assigns them to 
departments, and coordinates across them. It generally appears on an organization 
chart showing the chain of command—where formal power and authority reside 
and how departments relate to each other. Structures can be highly formal and pro￾mote control and efficiency, such as a functional structure; or they can be loosely 
defined and flexible and favor change and innovation, such as a matrix, process, or 
network structure.
Work design specifies how tasks are performed and assigned to jobs or groups. It 
can create traditional jobs and groups that involve standard tasks with little task 
variety and decision making, or enriched jobs and self-managed teams that involve 
highly variable, challenging, and discretionary work.

Human resources practices involve selecting people and training, developing, 
and rewarding them. These methods can be oriented to hiring and paying people 
for specific jobs, training them when necessary, and rewarding their individual per￾formance. Conversely, human resources practices can also select people to fit the 
organization’s culture, continually develop them, and pay them for learning mul￾tiple skills and contributing to business success.
Management and information systems have to do with how employees are 
led and the nature and kinds of information they are provided to guide their work. 
Managers can lead through command and control, relying on hierarchical author￾ity and the chain of command; or they can be highly participative and facilitate 
employee involvement in decision making. Information systems can be highly cen￾tralized, with limited access and data sharing; or they can be open and distribute 
copious information throughout the organization.
Table 20.1 shows how these design components can be configured into two radically 
different organization designs: mechanistic, supporting efficiency and control, and 
organic, promoting innovation and change.42 Mechanistic designs have been prevalent 
in organizations for over a century; they propelled organizations into the industrial 
age. Today, competitive conditions require many organizations to be more flexible, fast, 
and inventive.43 Thus, organization design is aimed more and more at creating organic 
designs, both in entirely new start-ups and in existing firms that reconfigure mechanis￾tic designs to make them more organic. Designing a new organization is much easier 
than redesigning an existing one in which multiple sources of inertia and resistance to 
change are likely embedded.
As shown in Table 20.1, a mechanistic design supports an organization strategy
emphasizing cost minimization, such as might be found at Wal-Mart and McDonalds or

other firms competing on price. The organization tends to be structured into functional 
departments, with employees performing similar tasks grouped together for maximum 
efficiency. The managerial hierarchy is the main source of coordination and control. 
Accordingly, work design follows traditional principles, with jobs and work groups 
being highly standardized with minimal decision making and skill variety. Human 
resources practices are geared toward selecting people to fit specific jobs and training 
them periodically when the need arises. Employees are paid on the basis of the job 
they perform, share a standard set of fringe benefits, and achieve merit raises based 
on their individual performance. Management practices stress command and control, 
with power concentrated at the top of the organization and orders flowing downward 
through the chain of command. Similarly, information systems are highly centralized, 
limited in access, and do not permit sharing data widely in the organization. When 
taken together, all of these design elements direct organizational behavior toward effi￾ciency and cost minimization.
Table 20.1 shows that an organic design supports an organization strategy aimed at 
innovation, such as might be found at 3M, Apple Computer, and Intel or other firms 
competing on new products and services. All the design elements are geared to getting 
employees directly involved in the innovation process, facilitating interaction among 
them, developing and rewarding their knowledge and expertise, and providing them 
with relevant and timely information. Consequently, the organization’s structure tends 
to be flat, lean, and flexible like the matrix, process, and network structures described 
in Chapter 14. Work design is aimed at employee motivation and decision making with 
enriched jobs and self-managed teams. Human resources practices focus on attracting, 
motivating, and retaining talented employees. They send a strong signal that employ￾ees’ knowledge and expertise are key sources of competitive advantage. Members are 
selected to fit an organization culture valuing participation, teamwork, and invention. 
Training and development are intense and continuous. Members are rewarded for 
learning multiple skills, have choice about fringe benefits, and gain merit pay based on 
the business success of their work unit. Management practices are highly participative 
and promote employee involvement. Information systems are highly open and inclu￾sive, providing relevant and timely information throughout the organization. In sum, 
these design choices guide members’ behaviors toward change and innovation.
Application Stages Organization design can be applied to the whole organization or 
to a major subpart such as a large department or stand-alone unit. It can start from 
a clean slate in a new organization or reconfigure an existing organization design. To 
construct the different design elements appropriately requires broad content knowl￾edge of them. Thus, organization design typically involves a team of OD practitioners 
with expertise in corporate strategy, organization structure, work design, human 
resources practices, and management and information systems. This team works 
closely with senior executives who are responsible for determining the organization’s 
strategic direction and leading the organization design intervention. The design pro￾cess itself can be highly participative, involving stakeholders from throughout the 
organization. This can increase the design’s quality and stakeholders’ commitment to 
implementing it.44
Organization design generally follows the three broad steps outlined below.45
Although they are presented sequentially, in practice they are highly interactive, often 
feeding back on each other and requiring continual revision as the process unfolds.
Clarifying the design focus. This preliminary stage involves assessing the 
organization to create the overall framework for design. It starts with examining 
the organization’s strategy and objectives and determining what organization capa￾bilities are needed to achieve them. These become the design criteria for making
1.518 PART 6 Strategic Change Interventions
choices about how to configure the design components. Then, the organization
is assessed against these design criteria to uncover gaps between how it currently 
functions and is designed and the desired capabilities. This gap analysis identifies 
current problems the design intervention should address. It provides information 
for determining which design elements will receive the most attention and the 
likely magnitude and time frame of the design process.
Designing the organization. This key step in organization design involves config￾uring the design components to support the organization’s strategy and objectives. 
It starts with a broad outline of how the organization should be structured and 
how the design components should fit together to form a particular design usu￾ally falling somewhere along the continuum from mechanistic to organic. Senior 
executives responsible for the overall direction of the organization typically design 
this overarching structure. Next, the design process addresses the specific details of 
the components, which involves generating alternatives and making specific design 
choices. A broader set of organizational members often participates in these deci￾sions, relying on its own as well as experts’ experience and know-how, knowledge 
of best practices, and information gained from visits to other organizations willing 
to share design experience. This stage results in an overall design for the organiza￾tion, detailed designs for the components, and preliminary plans for how they will 
fit together and be implemented.
Implementing the design. The final step involves making the new design hap￾pen by putting into place the new structures, practices, and systems. It draws 
heavily on the methods for leading and managing change discussed in Chapter 10 
and applies them to the entire organization or subunit, and not just limited parts. 
Because organization design generally involves large amounts of transformational 
change, this intervention can place heavy demands on the organization’s resources 
and leadership expertise. Members from throughout the organization must be 
motivated to implement the new design; all relevant stakeholders must support 
it politically. Organization designs usually cannot be implemented in one step but 
must proceed in phases that involve considerable transition management. They 
often entail significant new work behaviors and relationships that require exten￾sive and continuous organization learning.
Application 20.2 describes organization design at Deere & Company.46 It illustrates how 
the different design elements must fit together and reinforce each other to promote a 
high-performance organization.
CULTURE CHANGE
The topic of organization culture is becoming a very important one to companies, 
and the number of culture change interventions has grown accordingly. Organization 
culture is also the focus of growing research and OD application and has spawned a 
number of best-selling management books starting with Theory Z, The Art of Japanese 
Management, and In Search of Excellence and, more recently, Built to Last and Corporate 
Culture and Performance.47 Organization culture is seen as a major strength of such 
companies as Herman Miller, Intel, PepsiCo, Motorola, Hewlett-Packard, Southwest 
Airlines, and Levi Strauss. A growing number of managers appreciate the power of 
corporate culture in shaping employee beliefs and actions. A well-conceived and 
well-managed organization culture, closely linked to an effective business strat￾egy, can mean the difference between success and failure in today’s demanding 
environments.

3.Organization Design at Deere & Company
Deere & Company, one of the world’s leading 
producers of agricultural, construction, forestry, 
and turf care equipment, has a rich history of dedi￾cated employees, quality products, and loyal cus￾tomers. When Robert W. Lane, an 18-year veteran 
of Deere, became Chairman and CEO in August 
of 2000, however, economic and organizational 
problems were threatening this tradition. The com￾pany’s operations were capital intensive, extremely 
decentralized, and spread across a diversity of 
products with highly cyclical business cycles. This 
meant that overall company profitability required 
constant vigilance and comparison of profit margins 
across products with an eye to reducing cyclical 
swings and to optimizing the whole business and 
not just a particular business unit. Unfortunately, 
Deere focused too loosely on managing assets and 
profit margins and was too decentralized to do 
business this way, often wasting economic value. 
Lane described the firm as “asset heavy and margin 
lean.” Moreover, Deere was having problems keep￾ing pace with a rapidly changing and demanding 
global business environment.
With the support of a unified senior team, Lane 
immediately created a plan to manage assets more 
efficiently, to make a new generation of products 
geared to emerging market demands, and to reduce 
the firm’s vulnerability to cyclical swings and uncer￾tain agriculture and construction markets which 
together accounted for about 70% of Deere’s sales.
To make the plan work over the next several months, 
Lane made a number of related changes in the 
company’s management and information systems, 
structure, and human resources practices.
Deere’s redesign effort started with a simple yet 
powerful approach to measuring firm performance: 
shareholder value added (SVA), which is net oper￾ating profit after taxes minus cost of capital. Because 
this value-based metric is straightforward and 
intuitive, it was easily understood and embraced by 
operating people throughout the firm. SVA became 
the central tool for managing the company’s busi￾ness. It provided a common performance measure 
that could be applied to every product; it addressed 
the fundamental question, What value does this 
product add to Deere’s shareholders?
Consistent with this new performance measure, 
Deere restructured its largest division, agriculture, 
into two business units: worldwide harvesting and 
tractors/implements. This enabled each new unit to 
focus more diligently on the underlying econo mics 
of its products. It also provided for a far more inte￾grated business than the previous structure allowed. 
Thus, for example, worldwide harvesting could now 
get its combine harvester factories in Asia, Europe, 
and North America to all work together as one 
global product team with common metrics. It could 
also do the same for its factories that made cotton 
pickers and so on.
Next, Lane introduced an online performance 
management system to align goals and rewards 
with SVA. All 18,000 salaried employees now had 
to develop goals that were explicitly linked to the 
firm’s goals. Specific SVA targets were set for each 
product line at various points in the business cycle. 
High expectations for improvements in operating 
performance and SVA growth were set and widely 
communicated. Then, rewards were tied directly to 
progress on meeting those objectives. The simplic￾ity and consistency of this system focused employ￾ee behaviors on the economics of the business 
and reinforced the need to continuously improve 
performance and raise SVA.
Finally, Lane made significant changes in Deere’s 
talent mix to better meet the higher performance 
standards and the increasing demands of global 
competition. Employee selection and training 
practices were oriented to acquiring and developing 
a workforce with a strong customer orientation and 
collaborative skills. Employees needed to under￾stand customer needs fully so they could respond 
with appropriate technological solutions and prod￾uct innovations. They needed to be able to work 
together in teams on a worldwide basis.
Six years into Deere’s organization redesign, finan￾cial results were remarkable. In contrast to 2003, the 
firm’s 2006 net income more than doubled and rev￾enues were up almost 50%. In 2006, SVA was near 
$1 billion. Perhaps more important, Deere’s culture 
had shifted from mainly family values to those pro￾moting a high-performance organization.

Concept of Organization Culture
Despite the increased attention and research devoted to corporate culture, there is still 
some confusion about what the term “culture” really means when applied to organiza￾tions.48 Martin argues that culture can be viewed from an integrated, a differentiated, 
or a fragmented perspective.49 The integrated view focuses on culture as an organiza￾tionally shared phenomenon; it represents a stable and coherent set of beliefs about 
the organization and its environment. In contrast to the integrated perspective, the 
differentiated view argues that culture is not monolithic but that it is best seen in terms 
of subcultures that exist throughout the organization. While each subculture is locally 
stable and shared, there is much that is different across the subcultures. Finally, the 
fragmented view holds that culture is always changing and is dominated by ambiguity 
and paradox. Summarizing an organization’s culture from a fragmented viewpoint is 
somewhat meaningless.
Despite these different cultural views, there is some agreement about the elements 
or features of culture that are typically measured. They include the artifacts, norms, 
values, and basic assumptions that are more or less shared by organization members. 
The meanings attached to these elements help members make sense out of everyday life 
in the organization. The meanings signal how work is to be done and evaluated, and 
how employees are to relate to each other and to significant others, such as customers, 
suppliers, and government agencies.
As shown in Figure 20.3, organization culture includes four major elements existing 
at different levels of awareness:50
Artifacts. Artifacts are the highest level of cultural manifestation. They are the 
visible symbols of the deeper levels of culture, such as norms, values, and basic 
1.

[Figure 20.3]

Assumptions

Norms
ArtifactsCHAPTER 20 Transformational Change 521
assumptions. Artifacts include members’ behaviors, clothing, and language; and 
the organization’s structures, systems, procedures, and physical aspects, such 
as décor, space arrangements, and noise levels. At Nordstrom, a high-end retail 
department store, the policy and procedure manual is rumored to be one sentence, 
“Do whatever you think is right.” In addition, stores promote from within; pay 
commissions on sales to link effort and compensation; provide stationery for sales￾people to write personal notes to customers; and expect buyers to work as sales￾people to better understand the customer’s expectations. By themselves, artifacts 
can provide a great deal of information about the real culture of the organization 
because they often represent the deeper assumptions. The difficulty in their use 
during cultural analysis is interpretation; an outsider (and even some insiders) has 
no way of knowing what the artifacts represent, if anything.
Norms. Just below the surface of cultural awareness are norms guiding how 
members should behave in particular situations. These represent unwritten rules 
of behavior. Norms generally are inferred from observing how members behave 
and interact with each other. At Nordstrom, norms dictate that it’s okay for mem￾bers to go the extra mile to satisfy customer requests, and it’s not okay for sales￾people to process customers who were working with another salesperson.
Values. The next-deeper level of awareness includes values about what ought to 
be in organizations. Values tell members what is important in the organization and 
what deserves their attention. Because Nordstrom values customer service, the sales 
representatives pay strong attention to how well the customer is treated. Obviously, 
this value is supported by the norms and artifacts.
Basic assumptions. At the deepest level of cultural awareness are the 
taken-for-granted assumptions about how organizational problems should be 
solved. These basic assumptions tell members how to perceive, think, and feel about 
things. They are nonconfrontable and nondebatable assumptions about relating to 
the environment and about human nature, human activity, and human relation￾ships. For example, a basic assumption at Nordstrom is the belief in the fundamental 
dignity of people; it is morally right to treat customers with extraordinary service so 
that they will become loyal and frequent shoppers.
In summary, culture is defined as the pattern of artifacts, norms, values, and basic 
assumptions about how to solve problems that works well enough to be taught to oth￾ers.51 Culture is a process of social learning; it is the outcome of prior choices about and 
experiences with strategy and organization design. It is also a foundation for change that 
can either facilitate or hinder organization transformation. For example, the cultures of 
many companies (e.g., IBM, JCPenney, Sony, Disney, Microsoft, and Hewlett-Packard) 
are deeply rooted in the firm’s history. They were laid down by strong founders and have 
been reinforced by top executives and corporate success into customary ways of perceiv￾ing and acting. These customs provide organization members with clear and often widely 
shared answers to such practical issues as “what really matters around here,” “how do 
we do things around here,” and “what we do when a problem arises.”
Organization Culture and Organization Effectiveness
The interest in organization culture derives largely from its presumed impact on orga￾nization effectiveness. Considerable speculation and increasing research suggest that 
organization culture has both direct and indirect relationships with effectiveness.
Indirectly, culture affects performance through its influence on the organization’s 
ability to implement change. A particular pattern of values and assumptions that once 
was a source of strength for a company can become a major liability in successfully 
implementing a new strategy.52 Case studies of organization transformation are full of 
2.
3.
4.522 PART 6 Strategic Change Interventions
accounts where the change failed because the culture did not support the new strategy, 
including AT&T’s failed integration of NCR, Daimler-Benz’s troubles with Chrysler, 
and Prudential Insurance’s difficulties in diversifying into other financial services.
The growing appreciation that culture can play a significant role in implementing 
new strategy has fueled interest in the topic, especially in those firms needing to adapt 
to turbulent environments. A number of practitioners and academics have focused 
on helping firms implement new strategies by bringing culture more in line with the 
new direction.53 Indeed, much of the emphasis in the 1970s on formulating busi￾ness strategy shifted to organization culture in the 1980s as firms discovered cultural 
roadblocks to implementing a strategy. Along with this emerging focus on organiza￾tion culture, however, came the sobering reality that cultural change is an extremely 
difficult and long-term process. Some experts doubt whether large firms actually can 
bring about fundamental changes in their cultures; those who have accomplished 
such feats estimate that the process takes from 6 to 15 years.54 For example, Alberto￾Culver’s performance in its core business was suffering, and senior management, with 
the help of an employee opinion survey, realized that the culture was not aligned 
with the changing business needs. Beginning with the commitment of influential top 
managers, a management restructuring, explicit values, and new roles and practices, 
Alberto-Culver began a culture change intervention that took over seven years. Its 
efforts have been rewarded with increased sales and pretax profit growth.55
Indirectly, culture can also affect performance through its influence on a firm’s ability 
to operate in different countries. Multinationals may face problems doing business in 
other countries, especially when their corporate culture does not fit with the national 
culture. For example, Disney learned this lesson the hard way when it tried to export its 
Americanized service culture to Euro Disney outside of Paris. Its European employees 
were disgruntled with the strict dress and grooming code; customers who were accus￾tomed to having wine with their meals balked at Disney’s policy of not serving alcoholic 
beverages. This cultural mismatch resulted in serious labor problems and lower guest 
attendance than expected.56 Four Seasons Hotel and Resorts, on the other hand, made 
a relatively smooth transition into the French market by keeping its core service values 
while modifying its norms, procedures, and artifacts to fit with the French culture.57
Directly, evidence suggests that, in addition to affecting the implementation of busi￾ness strategy, corporate culture can affect organization performance. Comparative stud￾ies of Japanese and American management methods suggest that the relative success 
of Japanese companies in the 1980s could be partly explained by their strong corporate 
cultures emphasizing employee participation, open communication, security, and equal￾ity.58 A study of the productivity of university research departments in the UK showed 
a strong relationship between productivity and organization cultures emphasizing team￾work, information flow, and employee involvement.59 Another study of American firms 
showed a similar pattern of results.60 Using survey measures of culture and Standard & 
Poor’s financial ratios as indicators of organizational effectiveness, the results showed that 
firms whose cultures support employee participation in decision making, adaptable work 
methods, sensible work designs, and reasonable and clear goals perform significantly 
higher (financial ratios about twice as high) than do companies scoring low on those 
factors. Moreover, the employee participation element of corporate culture showed dif￾ferences in effectiveness among the firms only after three years; the other measures of 
culture showed differences in all five years. This suggests that changing some parts of cor￾porate culture, such as participation, should be considered as a long-term investment.
Another study of 207 firms in 22 different industries examined relationships 
between financial performance and the strength of a culture, the strategic appropriate￾ness of a culture, and the adaptiveness of a culture.61 First, there were no significant 
performance differences between organizations with widely shared values and those CHAPTER 20 Transformational Change 523
with little agreement around cultural assumptions. Second, there was a significant 
relationship between culture and performance when the organization emphasized the 
“right” values—values that were critical to success in a particular industry. Finally, 
performance results over time supported cultures that emphasized anticipating and 
adapting to environmental change.
These findings suggest that the strength of an organization’s culture can be both an 
advantage and a disadvantage. Under stable conditions, widely shared and strategically 
appropriate values can contribute significantly to organization performance. However, 
if the environment is changing, strong cultures can be a liability. Unless they also 
emphasize adaptiveness, the organization may experience wide swings in performance 
during transformational change. This line of thought was recently given empirical 
support.62 In a study of over 150 large, publicly traded companies from 19 industries, 
organizations with strong cultures had more reliable performance outcomes—that is, 
the strength of the culture was related to the predictability of performance. However, 
when the environment was more uncertain and dynamic, this reliability faded. In 
stable environments, strong cultures can provide efficiency in decision making and 
operations. In volatile environments, the strength of the culture can become a weak￾ness if it stunts creativity. Organizations with strong cultures are less able to exploit 
new environmental opportunities, unless of course, the culture emphasizes innovation 
and change.
Diagnosing Organization Culture
Culture change interventions generally start by diagnosing the organization’s exist￾ing culture to assess its fit with current or proposed business strategies. This requires 
uncovering and understanding the shared assumptions, values, norms, and artifacts that 
characterize an organization’s culture. OD practitioners have developed a number of 
useful approaches for diagnosing organization culture. These approaches fall into three 
different yet complementary perspectives: the behavioral approach, the competing val￾ues approach, and the deep assumption approach. Each diagnostic perspective focuses 
on particular aspects of organization culture, and together the approaches can provide a 
comprehensive assessment of these complex phenomena.
The Behavioral Approach
This method of diagnosis emphasizes the surface level of organization culture—the pattern 
of behaviors that produce business results.63 It is among the more practical approaches 
to culture diagnosis because it assesses key work behaviors that can be observed.64 The 
behavioral approach provides specific descriptions about how tasks are performed and 
how relationships are managed in an organization. For example, Table 20.2 summa￾rizes the organization culture of an international banking division as perceived by its 
managers. In this classic case, the data were obtained from a series of individual and 
group interviews asking managers to describe “the way the game is played,” as if they 
were coaching a new organization member. Managers were asked to give their impres￾sions in regard to four key relationships—companywide, boss– subordinate, peer, and 
interdepartment—and in terms of six managerial tasks—innovating, decision making, 
communicating, organizing, monitoring, and appraising/rewarding. These perceptions 
revealed a number of implicit norms for how tasks are performed and relationships 
managed at the division.
Cultural diagnosis derived from a behavioral approach can also be used to assess the 
cultural risk of trying to implement organizational changes needed to support a new 
strategy. Significant cultural risks result when changes that are highly important to 
implementing a new strategy are incompatible with the existing patterns of behavior. 524 PART 6 Strategic Change Interventions
Knowledge of such risks can help managers determine whether implementation plans 
should be changed to manage around the existing culture, whether the culture should be 
changed, or whether the strategy itself should be modified or abandoned.
The Competing Values Approach
This perspective assesses an organization’s culture in terms of how it resolves a set of 
value dilemmas.65 The approach suggests that an organization’s culture can be under￾stood in terms of two important “value pairs”; each pair consists of contradictory val￾ues placed at opposite ends of a continuum, as shown in Figure 20.3. The two value 
pairs are (1) internal focus and integration versus external focus and differentiation 
and (2) flexibility and discretion versus stability and control. Organizations continually 
struggle to satisfy the conflicting demands placed on them by these competing values. 
For example, when faced with the competing values of internal versus external focus, 
organizations must choose between attending to the integration problems of internal 
Text not available due to copyright restrictionsCHAPTER 20 Transformational Change 525
operations and the competitive issues in the external environment. Too much empha￾sis on the environment can result in neglect of internal efficiencies. Conversely, too 
much attention to the internal aspects of organizations can result in missing important 
changes in the competitive environment.
The competing values approach commonly collects diagnostic data about the com￾peting values with a survey designed specifically for that purpose.66 It provides mea￾sures of where an organization’s existing values fall along each of the dimensions. 
When taken together, these data identify an organization’s culture as falling into one of 
the four quadrants shown in Figure 20.3: clan culture, adhocracy culture, hierarchical 
culture, and market culture. For example, if an organization’s values are focused on 
internal integration issues and emphasize innovation and flexibility, it manifests a clan 
culture. On the other hand, a market culture characterizes values that are externally 
focused and emphasizes stability and control.
The Deep Assumptions Approach
This final diagnostic approach emphasizes the deepest levels of organization culture—
the generally unexamined, but tacit and shared assumptions that guide member behav￾ior and that often have a powerful impact on organization effectiveness. Diagnosing 
culture from this perspective typically begins with the most tangible level of awareness 
and then works down to the deep assumptions.
Diagnosing organization culture at the deep assumptions level poses at least three 
difficult problems for collecting pertinent information.67 First, culture reflects the more 
or less shared assumptions about what is important, how things are done, and how 
people should behave in organizations. People generally take cultural assumptions for 
granted and rarely speak of them directly. Rather, the company’s culture is implied in 
concrete behavioral examples, such as daily routines, stories, rituals, and language. 
This means that considerable time and effort must be spent observing, sifting through, 
and asking people about these cultural outcroppings to understand their deeper signifi￾cance for organization members. Second, some values and beliefs that people espouse 
have little to do with the ones they really hold and follow. People are reluctant to admit 
this discrepancy, yet somehow the real assumptions underlying idealized portrayals of 
culture must be discovered. Third, large, diverse organizations are likely to have several 
subcultures, including countercultures going against the grain of the wider organiza￾tion culture. Assumptions may not be shared widely and may differ across groups in 
the organization. This means that focusing on limited parts of the organization or on 
a few select individuals may provide a distorted view of the organization’s culture 
and subcultures. All relevant groups in the organization must be identified and their 
cultural assumptions sampled. Only then can practitioners judge the extent to which 
assumptions are shared widely.
OD practitioners emphasizing the deep assumptions approach have developed a 
number of useful techniques for assessing organization culture.68 One method involves 
an iterative interviewing process involving both outsiders and insiders.69 Outsiders help 
members uncover cultural elements through joint exploration. The outsider enters the 
organization and experiences surprises and puzzles that are different from what was 
expected. The outsider shares these observations with insiders, and the two parties 
jointly explore their meaning. This process involves several iterations of experienc￾ing surprises, checking for meaning, and formulating hypotheses about the culture. It 
results in a formal written description of the assumptions underlying an organizational 
culture.
A second method for identifying the organization’s basic assumptions brings 
together a group of people for a culture workshop—for example, a senior manage￾ment team or a cross section of managers, old and new members, labor leaders, and 526 PART 6 Strategic Change Interventions
staff.70 The group first brainstorms a large number of the organization’s artifacts, such 
as behaviors, symbols, language, and physical space arrangements. From this list, the 
values and norms that would produce such artifacts are deduced. In addition, the val￾ues espoused in formal planning documents are listed. Finally, the group attempts to 
identify the assumptions that would explain the constellation of values, norms, and 
artifacts. Because basic assumptions generally are taken for granted, they are difficult 
to articulate. A great deal of process consultation skill is required to help organization 
members see the underlying assumptions.
Application Stages There is considerable debate over whether changing something 
as deep-seated as organization culture is possible.71 Those advocating culture change 
generally focus on the more surface elements of culture, such as norms and artifacts. 
These elements are more changeable than the deeper elements of values and basic 
assumptions. They offer OD practitioners a more manageable set of action levers 
for changing organizational behaviors. Some would argue, however, that unless the 
deeper values and assumptions are changed, organizations have not really changed 
their culture.
Those arguing that implementing culture change is extremely difficult, if not impos￾sible, typically focus on the deeper elements of culture (values and basic assump￾tions). Because these deeper elements represent assumptions about organizational life, 
members do not question them and have a difficult time envisioning anything else. 
Moreover, members may not want to change their cultural assumptions. The culture 
provides a strong defense against external uncertainties and threats.72 It represents past 
solutions to difficult problems. Members also may have vested interests in maintaining 
the culture. They may have developed personal stakes, pride, and power in the culture 
and may strongly resist attempts to change it. Finally, cultures that provide firms with a 
competitive advantage may be difficult to imitate, thus making it hard for less success￾ful firms to change their cultures to approximate the more successful ones.73
Given the problems with cultural change, most practitioners in this area suggest that 
changes in corporate culture should be considered only after other, less difficult and 
less costly solutions have been applied or ruled out.74 Attempts to overcome cultural 
risks when strategic changes are incompatible with the existing culture might include 
ways to manage around that culture. Consider, for example, a single-product organiza￾tion with a functional focus and a history of centralized control that is considering an 
ambitious product-diversification strategy. The firm might manage around its existing 
culture by using business teams to coordinate functional specialists around each new 
product. Another alternative to changing culture is to modify strategy to bring it more 
in line with culture. The single-product organization just mentioned might decide to 
undertake a less ambitious strategy of product diversification.
Despite problems in changing corporate culture, large-scale cultural change may be 
necessary in certain situations: if the firm’s culture does not fit a changing environment; 
if the industry is extremely competitive and changes rapidly; if the company is medio￾cre or worse; if the firm is about to become a very large company; or if the company is 
smaller and growing rapidly.75 Organizations facing these conditions need to change their 
cultures to adapt to the situation or to operate at higher levels of effectiveness. They may 
have to supplement attempts at cultural change with other approaches, such as manag￾ing around the existing culture and modifying strategy.
Although knowledge about changing corporate culture is in a formative stage, the 
following practical advice can serve as guidelines for cultural change:76
Formulate a Clear Strategic Vision. Effective cultural change should start from a clear 
vision of the firm’s new strategy and of the shared values and behaviors needed to 
make it work.77 This vision provides the purpose and direction for cultural change. It 
1.CHAPTER 20 Transformational Change 527
serves as a yardstick for defining the firm’s existing culture and for deciding whether 
proposed changes are consistent with the core values of the organization. A useful 
approach to providing clear strategic vision is development of a statement of corporate 
purpose, listing in straightforward terms the firm’s core values. For example, Johnson 
& Johnson calls its guiding principles “Our Credo.” It describes several basic values 
that guide the firm, including, “We believe our first responsibility is to the doctors, 
nurses and patients, to mothers and all others who use our products and services”; 
“Our suppliers and distributors must have an opportunity to make a fair profit”; “We 
must respect [employees’] dignity and recognize their merit”; and “We must maintain 
in good order the property we are privileged to use, protecting the environment and 
natural resources.”78
Display Top-Management Commitment. Cultural change must be managed from the 
top of the organization. Senior executives and administrators have to be strongly 
committed to the new values and need to create constant pressures for change. 
They must have the staying power to see the changes through.79 For example, 
when Jack Welch was CEO at General Electric, he enthusiastically pushed a policy 
of cost cutting, improved productivity, customer focus, and bureaucracy busting for 
more than ten years to every plant, division, group, and sector in his organization. 
His efforts were rewarded with a Fortune cover story lauding his organization for 
creating more than $52 billion in shareholder value during his tenure.80
Model Culture Change at the Highest Levels. Senior executives must communicate 
the new culture through their own actions. Their behaviors need to symbolize the 
kinds of values and behaviors being sought. In the few publicized cases of success￾ful culture change, corporate leaders have shown an almost missionary zeal for 
the new values; their actions have symbolized the values forcefully.81 For example, 
when the Four Seasons hotel chain agreed to operate the George V hotel in Paris, 
it not only remodeled the hotel; it had to implement a culture consistent with 
its corporate brand and strategy, which were both “North American” in nature. 
Didier Le Calvez, General Manager of the Four Seasons George V, made a number 
of controversial decisions, including agreeing to the 35-hour work week, hiring an 
executive chef, and implementing a performance appraisal process. The nature of 
these decisions symbolized his understanding of French culture on the one hand 
and the importance of the Four Seasons’s standards on the other. In addition, 
Le Calvez was very visible on the property, meeting the French union officials 
for lunch, finding constructive ways to correct behavior in line with the Four 
Seasons’s service expectations, and participating in the interview and selection of 
all employees.82
Modify the Organization to Support Organizational Change. Cultural change 
generally requires supporting modifications in organization structure, human 
resources systems, information and control systems, and management styles. 
These organizational features can help to orient people’s behaviors to the new 
culture.83 They can make people aware of the behaviors required to get things 
done in the new culture and can encourage performance of those behaviors. For 
example, Carol Lavin Bernick, President of Alberto-Culver North America, created 
the “growth development leader” or GDL to support the cultural imperatives of 
honesty, ownership, trust, commitment, and teamwork. Each of the 70 GDLs men￾tors about a dozen key people in the organization to ensure they create and follow 
through on their “individual economic value-add” (IEV) statements. In turn, Ms. 
Bernick meets with the GDLs every six weeks to symbolize the importance of their 
work.84
Select and Socialize Newcomers and Terminate Deviants. One of the most effective 
methods for changing corporate culture is to change organizational membership. 
People can be selected and terminated in terms of their fit with the new culture.

5.528 PART 6 Strategic Change Interventions
This is especially important in key leadership positions, where people’s actions can 
significantly promote or hinder new values and behaviors. For example, Gould, in 
trying to change from an auto parts and battery company to a leader in electronics, 
replaced about two-thirds of its senior executives with people more in tune with 
the new strategy and culture. Jan Carlzon of Scandinavian Airlines (SAS) replaced 
13 out of 15 top executives in his turnaround of the airline. Another approach is to 
socialize newly hired people into the new culture. People are most open to organiza￾tional influences during the entry stage, when they can be effectively indoctrinated 
into the culture. For example, companies with strong cultures like Samsung, Procter 
& Gamble, and 3M attach great importance to socializing new members into the 
company’s values.
Develop Ethical and Legal Sensitivity. Cultural change can raise significant ten￾sions between organization and individual interests, resulting in ethical and legal 
problems for practitioners. This is particularly pertinent when organizations are 
trying to implement cultural values promoting employee integrity, control, equi￾table treatment, and job security—values often included in cultural change efforts. 
Statements about such values provide employees with certain expectations about 
their rights and about how they will be treated in the organization. The organi￾zation needs to follow through with behaviors and procedures supporting and 
protecting these implied rights, or risk violating ethical principles and, in some 
cases, legal employment contracts. Recommendations for reducing the chances of 
such ethical and legal problems include setting realistic values for culture change 
and not promising what the organization cannot deliver; encouraging input from 
throughout the organization in setting cultural values; providing mechanisms for 
member dissent and diversity, such as internal review procedures; and educating 
managers about the legal and ethical pitfalls inherent in cultural change and help￾ing them develop guidelines for resolving such issues.
Application 20.3 presents an example of culture change at IBM. It illustrates how 
important cultural principles are used to shape behavior during a period of organiza￾tional growth and how culture can be used to facilitate merger and acquisition integra￾tion processes.85
SUMMARY
In this chapter, we presented interventions for helping organizations transform them￾selves. These changes can occur at any level in the organization, but their ultimate 
intent is to change the total system. They typically happen in response to or in antici￾pation of significant environmental, technological, or internal changes. These changes 
may involve alterations in the firm’s strategy, which, in turn, may lead to changing its 
design and culture.
Integrated strategic change is a comprehensive intervention for responding to com￾plex and uncertain environmental pressures. It gives equal weight to the strategic and 
organizational factors affecting organization performance and effectiveness. In addition, 
these factors are highly integrated during the process of assessing the current strategy 
and organization design, selecting the desired strategic orientation, developing a strategic 
change plan, and implementing it.
Organization design involves the organization’s structure, work design, human 
resources practices, and management and information systems. It aligns these com￾ponents with the organization’s strategy and with each other so they mutually direct 
behavior to execute the strategy. This results in organization designs that vary along a 
6.CHAPTER 20 Transformational Change 529
continuum form mechanistic to organic depending on the requirements of the firm’s 
strategy. Organization design typically starts with assessing the organization to clarify 
the design focus. Then the design components are configured to support the organiza￾tion’s strategy. Finally, implementation involves putting the new structures, practices, 
and systems into place using many of the methods for leading and managing change 
described in Chapter 10.
Organization culture includes the pattern of basic assumptions, values, norms, and 
artifacts shared by organization members. It influences how members perceive, think, 
and behave at work. Culture affects whether firms can implement new strategies and 
whether they can operate at high levels of excellence. Culture change interventions 
start with diagnosing the organization’s existing culture. This can include assessing 
the cultural risks of making organizational changes needed to implement strategy. 
Changing corporate culture can be extremely difficult and requires clear strategic 
vision, top-management commitment, symbolic leadership, supporting organizational 
changes, selection and socialization of newcomers and termination of deviants, and 
sensitivity to legal and ethical issues.

IBM began in 1914 as a maker of cheese slicers, 
scales, and tabulating machines. Thomas Watson, 
its founder who became famous for the “Think” 
watchword, created the company on three values 
called “Basic Beliefs:” “respect for the individual,” 
“the best customer service,” and “the pursuit of 
excellence.” Based on these values, IBM grew into 
one of the great industrial giants of the world, rou￾tinely hailed as a “best managed company.”
By the late 1980s and the early 1990s, however, 
IBM’s enormous success had an unintended con￾sequence. The firm became complacent; its basic 
beliefs provided a rationale for stability. “Respect 
for the individual” had morphed into an entitle￾ment mentality where lifetime employment was 
reinforced by cultural norms. The “pursuit of 
excellence” gave way to corporate arrogance and 
a failure to listen to customers or the marketplace 
because IBM knew what was right. Finally, its 
devotion to large, centralized computer systems 
rather than PC-based distributed architectures led 
to its downfall. IBM’s stock price dropped 75%
between August 1987 and September 1993.
To turn things around, IBM appointed Lou Gerstner 
CEO in 1991. When asked how he would lead IBM, 
this former GE executive retorted: “The last thing 
IBM needs right now is a vision.” Over the next few 
years, Gerstner cut IBM’s workforce in half, abo￾lished lifetime employment, and refocused business 
strategy from hardware to software and services. 
The spectacular success that followed is regarded as 
one of the great turnarounds in business history.
So what would you do as the CEO who followed 
Gerstner? Sam Palmisano, a lifetime IBM employee, 
was appointed CEO in 2002. He strongly felt that 
IBM’s continued success depended on relaying its 
foundation. “We couldn’t be casual about tinkering 
with the DNA of a company like IBM. We had to 
come up with a way to get the employees to create 
the value system, to determine the company’s prin￾ciples. Watson’s Basic Beliefs, however distorted 
they might have become over the years, had to be 
the starting point.”
To clarify and shift IBM’s culture, Palmisano 
orchestrated a process that began with the corpora￾tion’s top 300 executives. Together, they generated 
the basic categories for the new values, including 
respect, customer, excellence, and innovation. 
These categories were tested in focus groups and 
broad surveys with more than 1,000 employees 
across levels, locations, and functions. Based on 
this input, three proposed values—commitment 
to the customer, excellence through innovation, 
and integrity that earns trust—were submitted 
to “ValuesJam,” a 72-hour process where all 
employees at IBM were invited to comment on 
the proposed values via IBM’s intranet. ValuesJam 
organized employee discussion around four forums. 
A company values forum asked general questions 
about the importance of values. A “first draft” dis￾cussion asked for reactions to the three proposed 
values. A third forum asked about IMB’s value 
in society, and a fourth asked people to describe 
IBM when it was at its best. Including Palmisano, 
50,000 employees made over 10,000 comments 
about the company’s culture and identity. The fol￾lowing were some early-on comments:
• “The only value in IBM today is the stock price.”
• “Company values (ya right).”
• “I feel we talk a lot about trust and taking risks, 
but at the same time, we have endless audits, 
mistakes are punished and not seen as a wel￾come part of learning, and managers (and oth￾ers) are consistently checked.”
• “There appears to be great reluctance among 
our junior executive community to challenge 
the view of our senior execs.”
• “ Many times I have heard expressions like ‘would 
you tell Sam that his strategy is wrong?’”
However, after initial feedback about why things 
weren’t working or wouldn’t work, the debate 
turned more positive. Eventually, a small design 
team took all the comments, looked for themes, and 
revised the proposed values into “dedication to every 
client’s success,” “innovation that matters—for our 
company and for the world,” and “trust and per￾sonal responsibility in all relationships.” Palmisano 
announced them in November 2003. The feedback, 
in the form of postings on the intranet and more 
than a thousand emails sent directly to Palmisano, 
was “these are fine . . . show me.”
In the final stage of the culture intervention, 
Palmisano sponsored a series of change projects to 
demonstrate how the values would be used to make 
application 20.3534 PART 6 Strategic Change Interventions
decisions and manage the company. One project 
was dubbed, the “$100 million bet on trust.” It was 
in response to a story that Palmisano heard about 
an IBM employee prototyping software for a client 
in Tokyo who immediately needed a software engi￾neer based in Austin to help configure a server. The 
employee couldn’t get the help right away because 
a charge code was first needed so there would be a 
way to account for the software engineer’s time. In 
effect, employees were unable to respond quickly 
to client needs because financial control processes 
required several levels of management approval. 
Although the money would usually be approved, 
it was often too late to be responsive. To address 
these issues, the $100 million bet on trust gave each 
manger in a pilot group up to $5,000 annually to 
spend, no questions asked, to respond to extraordi￾nary situations that would help generate business, 
to develop client relationships, or to respond to an 
IBMer’s emergency need. Subsequent evaluation 
showed that the money was being spent wisely. 
There were several examples of teams winning 
deals and delighting clients with a small amount 
of immediately available cash. Consequently, the 
program was extended to all 22,000 first-line 
managers. Palmisano was convinced that allowing 
line managers to take some reasonable risk and 
trusting them with those decisions would pay off. 
More importantly, the program symbolized living 
the IBM values.
Another important change to reflect the values 
better involved setting prices. ValuesJam surfaced 
many stories about the difficulty of pricing a cus￾tomer solution that involved a variety of products 
and services from multiple IBM groups. Since 
each brand and business unit had its own P&L, an 
across-IBM bid was usually pulled apart by each unit 
and run through the financial accounting sys tem as 
separate bids for individual products and services. 
This made it extremely difficult to come up with 
an all-inclusive price, which ran counter to IBM’s 
value of client success and the strategy of being 
able to offer a total solution—hardware, software, 
services, and financing. In one classic case, IBM’s 
CFO was putting together a deal for his partner￾ship account that involved hardware, software, and 
services. He was told by the finance function that 
he couldn’t price it as an integrated solution. In 
other words, IBM’s CFO was told he couldn’t offer 
the deal he was proposing!
In response, IBM developed an integrated bid 
system to better reflect its values. All of the people 
who set prices for clients were brought together and 
told, “You work for IBM. When there’s a cross-IBM 
bid with multiple products, you price it on the IBM 
income statement, not on the income statements 
of each product.” This led to a series of intense 
meetings with senior executives about allocating 
integrated bids to business-unit P&Ls. IBM made it 
work because it was the right thing to do in aligning 
the organization to its values.
The IBM culture change was led by senior 
executives and involved the whole organization in 
dis cussing and debating the firm’s values and iden￾tity. There was remarkable agreement on what the 
values should be. The debate, as it turned out, 
wasn’t over the values themselves but on whether 
IBM would be willing and able to live with them. 
To make this happen, specific organization changes 
were made that symbolized the values in use.SELF-DESIGNING ORGANIZATIONS
A growing number of researchers and practitioners have called for self-designing orga￾nizations that have the built-in capacity to transform themselves continually to achieve 
high performance in today’s competitive and changing environments.3
 Mohrman and 
Cummings have developed a self-design change strategy that involves an ongoing 
series of designing and implementing activities carried out by managers and employees 
at all levels of the firm.4
 The approach helps members translate corporate values and 
general prescriptions for change into specific structures, processes, and behaviors suited 
Continuous Change
This chapter describes interventions that enable 
organizations to change themselves continually. 
These change processes are relatively new to 
OD and are still being developed and refined. 
They are aimed at the growing number of orga￾nizations facing highly turbulent environments, 
such as firms in high-technology, entertainment, 
and biotechnology industries, where timing is 
critical, technological change is rapid, and 
competitive pressures are unrelenting and diffi￾cult to predict. In these situations, standard 
sources of competitive advantage—strategy, 
organization design, and core competencies—
erode quickly and provide only temporary 
advantage. What is needed are dynamic 
capabilities1
 built into the organization that 
enable it to renew forms of competitive advan￾tage constantly to adapt to a rapidly shifting 
environment.
Continuous change interventions extend 
transformational change into a nonstop process 
of strategy setting, organization designing, 
and implementing the change.2
 Rather than 
focus on creating and implementing a particular 
strategy and organization design, continuous 
change addresses the underlying structures, 
processes, and activities for generating new 
forms of competitive advantage. Thus, the focus 
is on learning, changing, and adapting—on how 
to produce a constant flow of new strategies 
and designs and not just on how to transform 
existing ones.
Self-designing organizations have the capa￾bility to alter themselves fundamentally and 
continuously. Creating them is a highly partici￾pative process in which multiple stakehold￾ers set strategic direction, design appropriate 
structures and processes, and implement them. 
This intervention includes considerable inno￾vation and learning as organizations gain the 
capacity to design and implement significant 
changes continually.
Learning organizations are those with the 
ability to learn how to change and improve 
themselves constantly. Distinct from individual 
learning, this intervention helps organizations 
move beyond solving existing problems to gain 
the capability to improve constantly. It results 
in the development of a learning organization 
where empowered members take responsibility 
for changing the organization and learning how 
to do this better and better.
Built-to-change organizations include design 
elements and managerial practices that are all 
geared for change not just normal operations. 
This intervention provides design and implemen￾tation guidelines for building change capability 
into the structures, processes, and behaviors of 
the organization so that it can respond continually 
to a rapidly changing environment.
21536 PART 6 Strategic Change Interventions
to their situations. It enables them to tailor changes to fit the organization and helps 
them continually adapt the organization to changing conditions.
The Demands of Adaptive Change
Mohrman and Cummings developed the self-design strategy in response to a number 
of demands facing organizations having to adapt to turbulent environments. These 
demands strongly suggest the need for self-design, in contrast to more traditional 
approaches to organization change that emphasize ready-made programs and see 
change as a periodic event. Although organizations prefer the control and certainty 
inherent in traditional change, the five requirements for adaptive change reviewed 
below argue against this strategy:
Adaptive change generally involves altering most features of the organization and 
achieving a fit among them and with the firm’s strategy. This suggests the need for a 
systemic change process that accounts for these multiple features and relationships.5
Adaptive change generally occurs in situations experiencing rapid change and 
uncertainty. This means that changing is never totally finished, as new structures 
and processes will continually have to be modified to fit changing conditions. Thus, 
the change process needs to be dynamic and iterative, with organizations continu￾ally changing themselves.6
Current knowledge about adaptive change provides only general prescriptions 
for change. Organizations need to learn how to translate that information into 
specific structures, processes, and behaviors appropriate to their situations. This 
generally requires considerable on-site innovation and learning as members learn 
by doing—trying out new structures and behaviors, assessing their effectiveness, 
and modifying them if necessary. Thus, adaptive change calls for constant organi￾zational learning.7
Adaptive change invariably affects many organization stakeholders, including 
owners, managers, employees, and customers. These different stakeholders are 
likely to have different goals and interests related to the change process. Unless 
the differences are revealed and reconciled, enthusiastic support for change may be 
difficult to achieve. Consequently, the change process must attend to the interests 
of multiple stakeholders.8
Adaptive change needs to occur at multiple levels of the organization if new strate￾gies are to result in changed behaviors throughout the firm. Top executives must 
formulate a corporate strategy and clarify a vision of what the organization needs 
to look like to support it. Middle and lower levels of the organization need to put 
those broad parameters into operation by creating structures, procedures, and 
behaviors to implement the strategy.9
Application Stages
The self-design strategy accounts for these demands of adaptive change. It focuses on 
all features of the organization (for example, structure, human resources practices, and 
technology) and designs them to support the business strategy. It is a dynamic and an 
iterative process aimed at providing organizations with the built-in capacity to change 
and redesign themselves continually as the circumstances demand. The approach pro￾motes organizational learning among multiple stakeholders at all levels of the firm, 
providing them with the knowledge and skills needed to transform the organization 
and continually improve it.
Figure 21.1 outlines the self-design approach. Although the process is described in 
three stages, in practice the stages merge and interact iteratively over time. Each stage 
is described below:

Laying the Foundation. This initial stage provides organization members with 
the basic knowledge and information needed to get started with adaptive change. 
It involves three kinds of activities. The first is acquiring knowledge about how 
organizations function, about organizing principles for achieving high perfor￾mance, and about the self-design process. This information is generally gained 
through reading relevant material, attending in-house workshops, and visiting 
other organizations that successfully have adapted themselves. This learning 
typically starts with senior executives or with those managing the change pro￾cess and cascades to lower organizational levels if a decision is made to proceed 
with self-design. The second activity in laying the foundation involves valuing —
determining the corporate values that will guide the change process. These val￾ues represent those performance outcomes and organizational conditions that 
will be needed to implement the corporate strategy. They are typically written in 
a values statement that is discussed and negotiated among multiple stakeholders 
at all levels of the organization. The third activity is diagnosing the current orga￾nization to determine what needs to be changed to enact the corporate strategy 
and values. Organization members generally assess the different features of the 
organization, including its performance. They look for incongruities between 
its functioning and its valued performances and conditions. In the case of an 
entirely new organization, members diagnose constraints and contingencies in 
the situation that need to be taken into account in designing the organization.
Designing. In this second stage of self-design, organization designs and innovations 
are generated to support corporate strategy and values. Only the broad parameters 
of a new organization are specified; the details are left to be tailored to the levels 
and groupings within the organization. Referred to as “minimum specification 
design,” this process recognizes that designs need to be refined and modified as 
they are implemented throughout the firm.
Implementing and Assessing. This last stage involves implementing the designed 
organization changes. It includes an ongoing cycle of action learning: changing 
structures and behaviors, assessing progress, and making necessary modifications. 
Information about how well implementation is progressing and how well the 
new organizational design is working is collected and used to clarify design and 
implementation issues and to make necessary adjustments. This learning process 
continues not only during implementation but indefinitely as members periodically 
assess and improve the design and alter it to fit changing conditions. The feedback

loops shown in Figure 21.1 suggest that the implementing and assessing activities 
may lead back to affect subsequent activities of designing, diagnosing, valuing, and 
acquiring knowledge. This iterative sequence of activities provides organizations 
with the capacity to transform and improve themselves continually.
The self-design strategy is applicable to existing organizations needing to change them￾selves, as well as to new organizations. It is also applicable to changing the total orga￾nization or only some subunits. The way self-design is managed and unfolds can also 
differ. In some cases, it follows the existing organization structure, starting with the 
senior executive team and cascading downward across organizational levels. In other 
cases, the process is managed by special design teams that are sanctioned to set broad 
parameters for valuing and designing for the rest of the organization. The outputs of 
these teams are then implemented across departments and work units, with consider￾able local refinement and modification.
Application 21.1 describes the change process at American Healthways. The appli￾cation describes how the structural change effort used the self-design approach on an 
overall basis and as the basis for each of the task forces as well.
LEARNING ORGANIZATIONS
The second continuous change intervention is aimed at helping organizations develop 
and use knowledge to change and improve themselves constantly. It includes two 
interrelated change processes: organization learning (OL), which enhances an orga￾nization’s capability to acquire and develop new knowledge, and knowledge man￾agement (KM), which focuses on how that knowledge can be organized and used 
to improve performance. Both OL and KM are crucial in today’s complex, rapidly 
changing environments. They can be a source of strategic renewal, and they can 
enable organizations to acquire and apply knowledge more quickly and effectively 
than competitors, thus establishing a sustained competitive advantage.10 Moreover, 
when knowledge is translated into new products and services, it can become a key 
source of wealth creation for organizations.11 OL and KM are among the most wide￾spread and fastest-growing interventions in OD. They are the focus of an expand￾ing body of research and practice, and have been applied in such diverse firms as 
McKinsey, L. L. Bean, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, Allegheny-Ludlum 
Steel, Boeing, Microsoft, and the U.S. Army.
Conceptual Framework
Like many new interventions in OD, there is some ambiguity about the concepts 
underlying OL and KM.12 Sometimes the terms “organization learning” and “knowl￾edge management” are used interchangeably to apply to the broad set of activities 
through which organizations learn and organize knowledge; other times, they are used 
separately to emphasize different aspects of learning and managing knowledge. This 
confusion derives in part from the different disciplines and applications traditionally 
associated with OL and KM.13
OL interventions emphasize the organizational structures and social processes that 
enable employees and teams to learn and to share knowledge. They draw heavily on the 
social sciences for conceptual grounding and on OD interventions, such as team building, 
structural design, and employee involvement, for practical guidance. In organizations, 
OL change processes typically are associated with the human resources function and 
may be assigned to a special leadership role, such as chief learning officer.
KM interventions, on the other hand, focus on the tools and techniques that enable 
organizations to collect, organize, and translate information into useful knowledge. 
They are rooted conceptually in the information and computer sciences and, in application 21.1
Self-Design at American 
Healthways Corporation
The senior leaders at American Healthways (AHMC) 
clearly sensed a need to look at the organization’s 
design in the context of the expected rapid growth 
of its health plan business. AMHC had identified 
an important and growing niche (proactive disease 
management) in the growing health care industry. 
They had crafted an impressive strategy but recog￾nized that the current structure was insufficient to 
the task.
A university-based OD practitioner initially recom￾mended a task force and a series of workshops to 
choose an appropriate organization design for the 
company. The task force and workshop idea was 
guided by a self-design philosophy. The organiza￾tion knew its structure was inadequate and that it 
needed a new way of operating, but it did not have 
a broad range of skills or experience in operating 
a large organization. This led the OD practitioner 
to believe that the self-design model would be the 
best approach. As the organization considered what 
structure to implement, it also needed to learn and 
build the capacity to change itself.
To date, there have been three organization design 
and development (ODD) task forces, and each one 
has been guided by the self-design strategy. The 
first ODD task force was dedicated to laying the 
foundation; their output was the recommenda￾tion to pursue a process-based structure. The 
second ODD task force was responsible for design￾ing; they were charged with putting “meat on the 
bones” of the approved structure. The third ODD 
task force began implementing the new design as 
well as developing more sophisticated long-term 
implementation templates.
The first ODD task force’s activities were dominated 
by laying the foundation activities. Members of 
the task force, representing most of the organi￾zation’s key functional areas, read extensively on 
organization design, interviewed other organiza￾tions who had adopted different structures, and 
studied alternative change processes. As a result 
of the knowledge acquired through this process, 
the task force became aware that the organiza￾tion lacked a clear vision and “big hairy audacious 
goal” (BHAG) that most change management 
frameworks listed as a key success factor. This 
insight led the task force to instigate a vision and 
strategy effort to clarify the organization’s purpose, 
to forecast revenues, and to understand the orga￾nization’s strategic intent. Within the context of a 
clearer strategy, the task force was able to examine 
the pros and cons of alternative structures and to 
ground their recommendation in business terms. 
The first ODD task force also engaged in diagnostic 
activities. This process allowed the group to better 
understand the current organization’s strengths 
and weaknesses, to test the initial draft of the 
BHAG, to alert the organization to the task force’s 
activities, and to ensure that the new organization 
aligned with the organization’s culture. Finally, the 
task force spent a considerable amount of time dis￾cussing and debating the values that would guide 
the new organization. A culture initiative was 
proceeding concomitantly with the ODD task force 
and the outputs of their work were an important 
input to these discussions.
The first ODD task force used the knowledge and 
information generated in the laying-the-foundation 
phase to design three alternative structures that they 
believed would meet the needs of the future orga￾nization. Each of the alternative structures was for￾malized with high-level charts, pros and cons, and 
a business case rationale. The group discussed the 
structures and debated their relative strengths and 
weaknesses in the context of the diagnostic infor￾mation, values, and strategy of the organization. 
The design phase concluded with a recommenda￾tion to senior management to adopt the process￾based structure. The recommendation of the first 
ODD task force was debated and approved by mem￾bers of AMHC’s senior management team, several of 
whom had been on the task force. The senior team 
recommended that another task force be created to 
expand on the recommended structure.
The second ODD task force’s activities were pre￾dominantly focused on the design phase of the 
self-design strategy. In addition to a few original 
task force members, the second task force consisted 
of organization members representing a broader 
range of functions and levels in the organization. 
This ensured that knowledge and understanding of 
the process-based structure generated in the first 540 PART 6 Strategic Change Interventions
task force would be passed along to a larger set of 
managers in the organization. More importantly, 
the second task force was expected to model the 
type of cross-functional team that would be the 
centerpiece of the new structure. As a result, 
the laying-the-foundation phase of the second task 
force included acquiring knowledge about cross￾functional and self-managed teams and continu￾ous improvement processes. The rationale for the 
process-based structure was reviewed and the val￾ues guiding the structural choice were discussed by 
the team. However, the primary work of the sec￾ond ODD task force was to add detail to each of the 
core processes, conceptualize and define the cor￾porate office organization, create design principles 
to aid managers in understanding why functions 
and processes were assigned in certain ways, create 
financial statements reflecting expected operating 
expenses in the new design, and create additional 
timelines and implementation templates to guide 
execution of the new structure. The second task 
force ended with a presentation of roles, report￾ing relationships, metrics, and control and reward 
mechanisms to the senior management team.
As the organization debated how to implement the 
structure, learnings from the first two task forces 
were applied. That is, both groups had developed 
important insights about the operation of a process￾based organization and recommended that the 
next group to manage the change process had to 
be the senior management team itself. As a result, 
the COO appointed the senior management team 
to be the third ODD task force. The primary focus 
of this group would be implementation, the third 
phase of the self-design strategy. Despite several 
senior managers’ participation on the first two task 
forces, the entire senior management team was not 
intimately familiar with the logic and operation of 
the process-based organization, nor had this group 
operated as a cross-functional team. By having the 
COO’s direct reports operate as a cross-functional 
team, ownership for the new structure would be 
placed squarely on the shoulders of those who 
would guide its implementation and an important 
symbol of the new organization structure would be 
established. Early in the life of the third task force, 
and based on its recommendation, the COO and 
CEO renamed and replaced the old senior manage￾ment team with the executive leadership group 
structure that would be responsible for operating 
the new organization. In addition, several key pro￾cess owners were named to begin the implemen￾tation. The third ODD task force also developed 
more detailed implementation guidelines, includ￾ing a variety of measures to monitor the success 
of the structure’s implementation and methods to 
keep the organization’s focus on meeting customer 
needs during the transition.
The design and implementation of the process-based 
structure at AMHC has been driven by the phi￾losophy and logic of the self-design strategy. It has 
produced important insights and changes in the way 
managers at the organization viewed its strategy, 
culture, and operations. Most importantly, the pro￾cess itself has built capacity and knowledge into the 
system. A variety of managers in different functions 
and levels of the organization have a deeper under￾standing of the structure’s rationale and important 
experiences working on cross-functional teams. 
This knowledge and experience will serve the orga￾nization well as it implements the process-based 
structure.
practice, emphasize electronic forms of knowledge storage and transmission such as 
intranets, data warehousing, and knowledge repositories. Organizationally, KM appli￾cations often are located in the information systems function and may be under the 
direction of a chief information or technology officer.
There is also confusion about the concept of organization learning itself, about 
whether it is an individual- or organization-level process. Some researchers and prac￾titioners describe OL as individual learning that occurs within an organization context; 
thus, it is the aggregate of individual learning processes occurring within an organiza￾tion.14 Others characterize it in terms of organization processes and structures; they CHAPTER 21 Continuous Change 541
emphasize how learning is embedded in routines, policies, and organization cultures.15
Snyder has proposed an integration of the two perspectives that treats organization 
learning as a relative concept.16 Individuals do learn in organizations but that learning 
may or may not contribute to OL. Learning is organizational to the extent that
It is done to achieve organization purposes.
It is shared or distributed among members of the organization.
Learning outcomes are embedded in the organization’s systems, structures, and culture.
To the extent that these criteria are met, organization learning is distinct from individ￾ual learning. Thus, it is possible for individual members to learn while the organization 
does not. For example, a member may learn to serve the customer better without ever 
sharing such learning with other members. Conversely, it is possible for the organiza￾tion to learn without individual members learning. Improvements in equipment design 
or work procedures, for example, reflect OL, even if these changes are not understood 
by individual members. Moreover, because OL serves the organization’s purposes and 
is embedded in its structures, it stays with the organization, even if members change.
A key premise underlying much of the literature on OL and KM is that such interven￾tions will lead to higher organization performance. Although their positive linkage to 
performance is assumed, the mechanisms through which OL and KM translate into per￾formance improvements are rarely identified or explained. Understanding those mecha￾nisms, however, is essential for applying these change processes in organizations.
Based on existing research and practice, Figure 21.2 provides an integrative frame￾work for understanding OL and KM interventions,17 summarizing the elements of these 
change processes and showing how they combine to affect organization performance. 
This framework suggests that specific characteristics, such as structure and human 
resources systems, influence how well organization learning processes are carried out. 
These learning processes affect the amount and kind of knowledge that an organization 
possesses; that knowledge, in turn, directly influences performance outcomes, such as 
product quality and customer service. As depicted in Figure 21.2, the linkage between 
organization knowledge and performance depends on the organization’s competitive 
strategy. Organization knowledge will lead to high performance to the extent that it

is both relevant and applied effectively to the strategy. For example, customer-driven 
organizations require timely and relevant information about customer needs. Their 
success relies heavily on members having that knowledge and applying it effectively in 
their work with customers.
Figure 21.2 also shows how OL and KM are interrelated. OL interventions address how 
organizations can be designed to promote effective learning processes, and how those 
learning processes themselves can be improved. KM interventions focus on the outcomes 
of learning processes, on how strategically relevant knowledge can be effectively organized 
and used throughout the organization. Each of the key elements of OL and KM—organi￾zation characteristics, organization learning processes, and organization knowledge—are 
described below along with the interventions typically associated with them.
Organization Learning Interventions
As shown in Figure 21.2, there are several organization features that can promote 
effective learning processes, including structure, information systems, human 
resources practices, culture, and leadership. Consequently, many of the interven￾tions described in this book can help organizations develop more effective learning 
capabilities. Human resources management interventions—performance appraisal, 
reward systems, and career planning and development—can reinforce members’ 
motivation to gain new skills and knowledge. Technostructural interventions, such 
as process-based and network structures, self-managing work teams, and reengi￾neering, can provide the kinds of lateral linkages and teamwork needed to process, 
develop, and share diverse information and knowledge. Human process changes, 
including team building, search conferences, and intergroup relations interventions, 
can help members develop the kinds of healthy interpersonal relationships that 
underlie effective OL. Strategic interventions, such as integrated strategic change 
and alliances, can help organizations gain knowledge about their environments and 
develop values and norms that promote OL.
Characteristics of a Learning Organization OL practitioners have combined 
many of these interventions into the design and implementation of what is com￾monly referred to as the “learning organization.” It is an organization “skilled at 
creating, acquiring, interpreting, transferring, and retaining knowledge, and at 
purposefully modifying its behavior to reflect new knowledge and insights.”18 Much 
of the literature on the learning organization is prescriptive and proposes how orga￾nizations should be designed and managed to promote effective learning. Although 
there is relatively little systematic research to support these premises, there is grow￾ing consensus among researchers and practitioners about specific organizational 
features that characterize the learning organization.19 These qualities are mutually 
reinforcing and fall into five interrelated categories:
Structure—Organization structures emphasize teamwork, lesser number of layers, 
strong lateral relations, and networking across organizational boundaries both inter￾nal and external to the firm. These features promote information sharing, involve￾ment in decision making, systems thinking, and empowerment.
Information systems—Organization learning involves gathering and processing 
information, and consequently, the information systems of learning organizations 
provide an infrastructure for OL. These systems facilitate rapid acquisition, process￾ing, and sharing of rich, complex information and enable people to manage knowl￾edge for competitive advantage.
Human resources practices—Human resources, including appraisal, rewards, and 
training, are designed to account for long-term performance and knowledge devel￾opment; they reinforce the acquisition and sharing of new skills and knowledge.

Organization culture—Learning organizations have strong cultures that promote 
openness, creativity, and experimentation among members. These values and norms 
provide the underlying social support needed for successful learning. They encourage 
members to acquire, process, and share information; they nurture innovation and pro￾vide the freedom to try new things, to risk failure, and to learn from mistakes.
Leadership—Like most interventions aimed at continous change, OL and KM 
depend heavily on effective leadership throughout the organization. The leaders 
of learning organizations actively model the openness, risk taking, and reflection 
necessary for learning. They also communicate a compelling vision of the learning 
organization and provide the empathy, support, and personal advocacy needed to 
lead others in that direction.
Organization Learning Processes The organization characteristics described above affect 
how well members carry out organization learning processes. As shown in Figure 21.2, 
these processes consist of four interrelated activities: discovery, invention, production, 
and generalization.20 Learning starts with discovery when errors or gaps between desired 
and actual conditions are detected. For example, sales managers may discover that sales 
are falling below projected levels and set out to solve the problem. Invention is aimed 
at devising solutions to close the gap between desired and current conditions; it includes 
diagnosing the causes of the gap and creating appropriate solutions to reduce it. The sales 
managers may learn that poor advertising is contributing to the sales problem and may 
devise a new sales campaign to improve sales. Production processes involve implement￾ing solutions, and generalization includes drawing conclusions about the effects of the 
solutions and extending that knowledge to other relevant situations. For instance, the 
new advertising program would be implemented, and if successful, the managers might 
use variations of it with other product lines. Thus, these four learning processes enable 
members to generate the knowledge necessary to change and improve the organization.
Organizations can apply the learning processes described above to three types of 
learning.21 First, single-loop learning or adaptive learning is focused on improving the 
status quo. This is the most prevalent form of learning in organizations and enables 
members to reduce errors or gaps between desired and existing conditions. It can pro￾duce incremental change in how organizations function. The sales managers described 
above engaged in single-loop learning when they looked for ways to reduce the differ￾ence between current and desired levels of sales.
Second, double-loop learning or generative learning is aimed at changing the status quo. 
It operates at a more abstract level than does single-loop learning because members 
learn how to change the existing assumptions and conditions within which single￾loop learning operates. This level of learning can lead to transformational change, 
where the status quo itself is radically altered. For example, the sales managers may 
learn that sales projections are based on faulty assumptions and models about future 
market conditions. This knowledge may result in an entirely new conception of future 
markets, with corresponding changes in sales projections and product development 
plans. It may lead the managers to drop some products that had previously appeared 
promising, develop new ones that were not considered before, and alter advertising 
and promotional campaigns to fit the new conditions.
The third type of learning is called deuterolearning, which involves learning how 
to learn. Here learning is directed at the learning process itself and seeks to improve 
how organizations perform single- and double-loop learning. For example, the sales 
managers might periodically examine how well they perform the processes of discov￾ery, invention, production, and generalization. This could lead to improvements and 
efficiencies in how learning is conducted throughout the organization.
Practitioners have developed change strategies designed specifically for organization 
learning processes. Although these interventions are relatively new in OD and do not 
•
•544 PART 6 Strategic Change Interventions
follow a common change process, they tend to focus on cognitive aspects of learning 
and how members can become more effective learners. In describing these change 
strategies, we draw heavily on the work of Argyris and Schon and of Senge and his 
colleagues because it is the most developed and articulated work in OL practice.22
From this perspective, organization learning is not concerned with the organization 
as a static entity but as an active process of sense making and organizing. Based on the 
interpretive model of change (Chapter 2), members socially construct the organiza￾tion as they continually act and interact with each other and learn from those actions 
how to organize themselves for productive achievement. This active learning process 
enables members to develop, test, and modify mental models or maps of organiza￾tional reality. Called theories in use, these cognitive maps inform member behavior and 
organizing.23 They guide how members make decisions, perform work, and organize 
themselves. Unfortunately, members’ theories in use can be faulty, resulting in ineffec￾tive behaviors and organizing efforts. They can be too narrow and fail to account for 
important aspects of the environment; they can include erroneous assumptions that 
lead to unexpected negative consequences. Effective OL can resolve these problems by 
enabling members to learn from their actions how to detect and correct errors in their 
mental maps, and thus it can promote more effective organizing efforts.
The predominant mode of learning in most organizations is ineffective, however, 
and may even intensify errors. Referred to as Model I learning, it includes values and 
norms that emphasize unilateral control of environments and tasks, and protection 
of oneself and others from information that may be hurtful.24 These norms result in 
a variety of defensive routines that inhibit learning, such as withholding information 
and feelings, competition and rivalry, and little public testing of theories in use and the 
assumptions underlying them. Model I is limited to single-loop learning, where exist￾ing theories in use are reinforced.
A more effective approach to learning, called Model II learning, is based on values 
promoting valid information, free and informed choice, internal commitment to the 
choice, and continuous assessment of its implementation.25 This results in minimal 
defensiveness, with greater openness to information and feedback, personal mastery 
and collaboration with others, and public testing of theories in use. Model II applies 
to double-loop learning, where theories in use are changed, and to deuterolearning, 
where the learning process itself is examined and improved.
Application Stages OL interventions are aimed at helping organization members 
learn how to change from Model I to Model II learning. Like all learning, this change 
strategy includes the learning processes of discovery, invention, production, and gen￾eralization. Although the phases are described linearly below, in practice they form a 
recurrent cycle of overlapping learning activities.
Discover Theories in Use and Their Consequences. This first step involves uncover￾ing members’ mental models or theories in use and the consequences that follow 
from behaving and organizing according to them. Depending on the size of the cli￾ent system, this may directly involve all members, such as a senior executive team, 
or it may include representatives of the system, such as a cross section of members 
from different levels and areas.
OL practitioners have developed a variety of techniques to help members iden￾tify their theories in use. Because these theories generally are taken for granted 
and rarely examined, members need to generate and analyze data to infer the 
theories’ underlying assumptions. One approach is called dialogue, a variant of the 
human process interventions described in Chapter 12.26 It involves members in 
genuine exchange about how they currently address problems, make decisions, 
and interact with each other and relevant others, such as suppliers, customers, and 
competitors. Participants are encouraged to be open and frank with each other, to 
1.CHAPTER 21 Continuous Change 545
behave as colleagues, and to suspend individual assumptions as much as possible. 
OL practitioners facilitate dialogue sessions using many of the human process tools 
described in Chapter 12, such as process consultation and third-party intervention. 
As a result, group members are encouraged to inquire into their own and others’ 
ways of thinking, to advocate for certain beliefs, and to reflect on the assumptions 
that lead to those beliefs. Dialogue can result in clearer understanding of existing 
theories in use and their behavioral consequences and enable members to uncover 
faulty assumptions that lead to ineffective behaviors and organizing efforts.
A second method of identifying theories in use involves constructing an action map
of members’ theories and their behavioral consequences.27 OL practitioners typically 
interview members about recurrent problems in the organization, why they are occur￾ring, actions that are taken to resolve them, and outcomes of those behaviors. Based 
on this information, an action map is constructed showing interrelationships among 
the values underlying theories in use, the action strategies that follow from them, and 
the results of those actions. Such information is fed back to members so that they can 
test the validity of the map, assess the effectiveness of their theories in use, and identify 
factors that contribute to functional and dysfunctional learning in the organization.
A third technique for identifying theories in use and revealing assumptions is 
called the left-hand, right-hand column.
28 It starts with each member selecting a specific 
example of a situation where he or she was interacting with others in a way that 
produced ineffective results. The example is described in the form of a script and is 
written on the right side of a page. For instance, it might include statements such as, 
“I told Larry that I thought his idea was good.” “Joyce said to me that she did not 
want to take the assignment because her workload was too heavy.” On the left-hand 
side of the page, the member writes what he or she was thinking but not saying at 
each phase of the exchange. For example, “When I told Larry that I thought his idea 
was good, what I was really thinking is that I have serious reservations about the idea, 
but Larry has a fragile ego and would be hurt by negative feedback.” “Joyce said she 
didn’t want to take the assignment because her workload is too heavy, but I know 
it’s because she doesn’t want to work with Larry.” This simple yet powerful exercise 
reveals hidden assumptions that guide behavior and can make members aware of 
how erroneous or untested assumptions can undermine work relationships.
A fourth method that helps members identify how mental models are created 
and perpetuated is called the ladder of inference, as shown in Figure 21.3.29
It demonstrates how far removed from concrete experience and selected data 
are the assumptions and beliefs that guide our behavior. The ladder shows viv￾idly how members’ theories in use can be faulty and lead to ineffective actions. 
People may draw invalid conclusions from limited experience; their cultural and 
personal biases may distort meaning attributed to selected data. The ladder of 
inference can help members understand why their theories in use may be invalid 
and why their behaviors and organizing efforts are ineffective. Members can start 
with descriptions of actions that are not producing intended results and then back 
down the ladder to discover the reasons underlying those ineffective behaviors. 
For example, a service technician might withhold from management valuable 
yet negative customer feedback about product quality, resulting in eventual loss 
of business. Backing down the ladder, the technician could discover an untested 
belief that upper management does not react favorably to negative information 
and may even “shoot the messenger.” This belief may have resulted from assump￾tions and conclusions that the technician drew from observing periodic layoffs and 
from hearing widespread rumors that the company is out to get troublemakers 
and people who speak up too much. The ladder of inference can help members 
understand the underlying reasons for their behaviors and help them confront the 
possibility that erroneous assumptions are contributing to ineffective actions.546 PART 6 Strategic Change Interventions
Invent and Produce More Effective Theories in Use. Based on what is discovered in 
the first phase of this change process, members invent and produce theories in use 
that lead to more effective actions and that are more closely aligned with Model II 
learning. This involves double-loop learning as members try to create and enact new 
theories. In essence, members learn by doing; they learn from their invention and 
production actions how to invent and produce more effective theories in use. As 
might be expected, learning how to change theories in use can be extremely difficult. 
There is a strong tendency for members to revert to habitual behaviors and modes 
of learning. They may have trouble breaking out of existing mindsets and seeing 
new realities and possibilities. OL practitioners have developed both behavioral and 
conceptual interventions to help members overcome these problems.
Behaviorally, practitioners help members apply the values underlying 
Model II learning—valid information, free choice, and internal commitment—to 
question their experience of trying to behave more consistently with Model II.30
They encourage members to confront and talk openly about how habitual actions 
and learning methods prevent them from creating and enacting more effective 
theories. Once these barriers to change are discussed openly, members typically 
discover that they are changeable. This shared insight often leads to the inven￾tion of more effective theories for behaving, organizing, and learning. Subsequent 
experimentation with trying to enact those theories in the workplace is likely to 
produce more effective change because the errors that invariably occur when try￾ing new things now can be discussed and hence corrected.

Conceptually, OL practitioners teach members systems thinking to help them 
invent more effective theories in use.31 It provides concepts and tools for detecting 
subtle but powerful structures that underlie complex situations. Learning to see 
such structures can help members understand previously unknown forces operat￾ing in the organization. This information is essential for developing effective theo￾ries for organizing, particularly in today’s complex, changing world.
Systems thinking generally requires a radical shift in how members view the 
world: from seeing parts to seeing wholes; from seeing linear cause–effect chains to 
seeing interrelationships; from seeing static entities to seeing processes of change. 
Practitioners have developed a variety of exercises and tools to help members 
make this conceptual shift. These include systems diagrams for displaying circles of 
influence among system elements; system archetypes describing recurrent struc￾tures that affect organizations; computerized microworlds where new strategies 
can be tried out under conditions that permit experimentation and learning; and 
games and experiential exercises demonstrating systems principles.32
Continuously Monitor and Improve the Learning Process. This final stage involves 
deuterolearning—learning how to learn. As described earlier, learning is directed 
at the learning process itself and at how well Model II learning characteristics are 
reflected in it. This includes assessing OL strategies and the organizational struc￾tures and processes that contribute to them. Members assess periodically how well 
these elements facilitate single- and double-loop learning. They generalize posi￾tive findings to new or changing situations and make appropriate modifications to 
improve OL. Because these activities reflect the highest and most difficult level of 
OL, they depend heavily on members’ capability to do Model II learning. Members 
must be willing to question openly their theories in use about OL; they must be 
willing to test publicly the effectiveness of both their learning strategies and those 
of the wider organization.
Knowledge Management Interventions
The key outcome of organization learning processes is organization knowledge. It 
includes what members know about organizational processes, products, customers, and 
competitive environments. Such knowledge may be explicit and exist in codified forms 
such as documents, manuals, and databases; or it may be tacit and reside mainly in 
members’ skills, memories, and intuitions.33 Fueled by innovations in information tech￾nology, KM interventions have focused heavily on codifying organization knowledge 
so it can be readily accessed and applied to organizational tasks. Because tacit knowl￾edge is difficult if not impossible to codify, attention has also been directed at how such 
knowledge can be shared informally across members and organizational units.
Knowledge and Performance Organization knowledge contributes to organization 
performance to the extent that it is relevant and applied effectively to the organization’s 
competitive strategy, as shown in Figure 21.2. Moreover, organization knowledge is 
particularly valuable when it is unique and cannot easily be obtained by competitors.34
Thus, organizations seek to develop or acquire knowledge that distinctly adds value for 
customers and that can be leveraged across products, functions, business units, or geo￾graphical regions. For example, Wal-Mart excels at managing its unique distribution 
system across a wide variety of regional stores. Honda is particularly successful at lever￾aging its competence in producing motors across a number of product lines, including 
automobiles, motorcycles, generators, outboard motors, and lawn mowers.35
Because organization knowledge plays a crucial role in linking organization learning 
processes to organization performance, increasing attention is being directed at how firms 
can acquire and use it effectively. Studies have demonstrated how many Japanese com￾panies and such American firms as Hewlett-Packard and Motorola achieve competitive 
3.548 PART 6 Strategic Change Interventions
advantage through building and managing knowledge effectively.36 These knowledge 
capabilities have been described as “core competencies,”37 “invisible assets,”38 and 
“intellectual capital,”39 thus suggesting their contribution to organization performance. 
Mohrman and her colleagues have looked at organizations through a knowledge lens.40
They have shown how firms can fine tune their organization designs so that each design 
element, such as structure, rewards, work design, and managerial processes, contributes 
to creating and leveraging knowledge for competitive advantage.
There is growing emphasis both in the accounting profession and in many industries 
on developing measures that capture knowledge capital.41 For many organizations, the 
value of intellectual assets far exceeds the value of physical and financial assets; intel￾lectual assets are usually worth three- to four-times tangible book value.42 Moreover, 
the key components of cost in many of today’s organizations are research and develop￾ment, intellectual assets, and services, rather than materials and labor, which are the 
focus of traditional cost accounting. Dow Chemical, for example, has developed a pro￾cess for measuring and managing intellectual capital.43 The method first defines the role 
of knowledge in the firm’s business strategy, then assesses current knowledge assets and 
deficiencies, and finally assembles a knowledge portfolio. This process enables Dow to 
manage knowledge almost as rigorously as it manages its tangible assets.
Application Stages KM interventions are growing rapidly in OD and include a range 
of change strategies and methods. Although there is no universal approach to KM, 
these change processes address the essential steps for generating, organizing, and dis￾tributing knowledge within organizations:
Generating Knowledge. This stage involves identifying the kinds of knowledge that 
will create the most value for the organization and then creating mechanisms for 
increasing that stock of knowledge. It starts with examination of the organization’s 
competitive strategy—how it seeks to create customer value to achieve profitable 
results. Strategy provides the focus for KM; it identifies those areas where knowledge 
is likely to have the biggest payoff. For example, competitive strategies that empha￾size customer service, such as those found at McKinsey and Nordstrom, place a pre￾mium on knowledge about customer needs, preferences, and behavior. Strategies 
favoring product development, like those at Microsoft and Hoffman-LaRoche, ben￾efit from knowledge about technology and research and development. Strategies 
focusing on operational excellence, such as those at Motorola and Chevron, value 
knowledge about manufacturing and quality improvement processes.
Once the knowledge required for competitive strategy is identified, organizations 
need to devise mechanisms for acquiring or creating that knowledge. Externally, 
organizations can acquire other companies that possess the needed knowledge, 
or they can rent it from knowledge sources such as consultants and university 
researchers.44 Internally, organizations can facilitate communities of practice—infor￾mal networks among employees performing similar work to share expertise and 
solve problems together.45 They can also create more formal groups for knowledge 
generation, such as R&D departments, corporate universities, and centers of excel￾lence. Organizations can bring together people with different skills, ideas, and 
values to generate new products or services. Called creative abrasion, this process 
breaks traditional frames of thinking by having diverse perspectives rub creatively 
against each other to develop innovative solutions.46
Organizing Knowledge. This phase includes putting valued knowledge into a form 
that organizational members can use readily. It may also involve refining knowl￾edge to increase its value to users. KM practitioners have developed tools and 
methods for organizing knowledge that form two broad strategies: codification and 
personalization.47
1.
2.CHAPTER 21 Continuous Change 549
Codification approaches rely heavily on information technology. They categorize 
and store knowledge in databases where it can be accessed and used by appropri￾ate members. This strategy works best for explicit forms of knowledge that can be 
extracted from people, reports, and other data sources, and then organized into mean￾ingful categories called “knowledge objects” that can be reused for various purposes. 
The economic rationale underlying this strategy is to invest once in a knowledge asset 
and then to reuse it many times. Management consulting firms such as McKinsey and 
Bain extract key knowledge objects from consulting reports, benchmark data, and 
market segmentation analyses, and then place them in an electronic repository for 
people to use. This enables them to apply knowledge assets across various projects and 
clients, thus achieving scale in knowledge reuse to grow their business.
Personalization strategies for organizing knowledge focus on the people who 
develop knowledge and on how they can share it person-to-person. This approach 
emphasizes tacit knowledge, which cannot be codified and stored effectively in 
computerized information systems. Such knowledge is typically accessed through 
personal conversations, direct contact, and ongoing dialogue with the people who 
possess it. Thus, KM practitioners have developed a variety of methods for facilitat￾ing personal exchanges between those with tacit knowledge and those seeking it. 
For example, Bain and Company fosters networking among its employees through 
transferring people across offices, encouraging the prompt return of phone calls 
from colleagues, brainstorming sessions, and cross-functional project teams. 
Hughes, Microsoft, and Time-Life have created “knowledge maps” that identify 
valued competencies, skills, and knowledge and show people where to go and 
whom to contact to access them.48
Distributing Knowledge. This final stage of KM creates mechanisms for members 
to gain access to needed knowledge. It overlaps with the previous phase of KM 
and involves making knowledge easy for people to find and encouraging its use 
and reuse. KM practitioners have developed a variety of methods for distribut￾ing knowledge, generally grouped as three approaches: self-directed distribution, 
knowledge services and networks, and facilitated transfer.49
Self-directed distribution methods rely heavily on member control and initiative for 
knowledge dissemination. They typically include databases for storing knowledge 
and locator systems for helping members find what they want. Databases can include 
diverse information such as articles, analytical reports, customer data, and best practices. 
Locator systems can range from simple phone directories to elaborate search engines. 
Self-directed knowledge transfer can involve either “pull” or “push” systems.50 The 
former lets members pull down information they need, when they need it; the latter 
makes knowledge available to members by sending it out to them. Fluor Corporation, 
for example, placed job requirements and career ladder information on its intranet and 
let employees access the information on an “as needed” basis.
Knowledge services and networks promote knowledge transfer by providing specific 
assistance and organized channels for leveraging knowledge throughout the organiza￾tion. KM services include a variety of support for knowledge distribution, such as help 
desks, information systems, and knowledge packages. They may also involve special 
units and roles that scan the flow of knowledge and organize it into more useful forms, 
such as “knowledge departments,” “knowledge managers,” or “knowledge integrators.”51
Knowledge networks create linkages among organizational members for sharing knowl￾edge and learning from one another. These connections can be electronic, such as those 
occurring in chat rooms, intranets, and discussion databases, or they may be personal, 
such as those taking place in talk rooms, knowledge fairs, and communities of practice.
Facilitated transfer of organization knowledge involves specific people who assist 
and encourage knowledge distribution. These people are trained to help members 
3.550 PART 6 Strategic Change Interventions
find and transmit knowledge as well as gain access to databases and other knowledge 
services. They may also act as change agents helping members implement knowledge 
to improve organization processes and structures. For example, BP’s “Shared Learning 
Program” includes dedicated practitioners, called “quality/ progress professionals,” who 
coach employees in best practices and how to use them.52
Application 21.2 describes how Motorola created a KM system at its manufacturing 
facility in Penang, Malaysia. It shows how KM evolves in practice and the benefits of 
integrating it with the organization’s culture.53
Outcomes of OL and KM
Given the popularity of OL and KM interventions, research about their effects in 
organizations is growing. The Society for Organizational Learning (SoL: http://www.
solonline.org) at MIT is engaged in a variety of research efforts that focus on capacity 
building, dialogue, and other aspects of OL processes. For example, Volvo and IKEA 
applied learning processes in their implementation of environmentally sustainable 
organization designs. Other organizations claim considerable success with the lad￾der of inference, the left-hand/right-hand column tool, and systems thinking. The 
Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, for example, used the left-hand/right-hand 
column to increase collaboration between the English and French radio and TV orga￾nizations and to create a new vocabulary for sharing resources. Shani and Docherty 
reported how OD interventions aimed at designing and implementing organization 
learning mechanisms contributed to positive performance outcomes in firms in Israel, 
Sweden, the UK, and the United States.54 Studies of transfer of best practices and 
KM by the American Productivity & Quality Center reveal a number of performance 
improvements in such companies as Buckman Laboratories, Texas Instruments, CIGNA 
Property & Casualty, and Chevron.55 Among the reported outcomes were increases in 
new product sales, manufacturing capacity, and corporate profits, as well as reductions 
in costs, service delivery time, and start-up time for new ventures. A study of 40 firms 
in Europe, Japan, and the United States found that in contrast to poorer performing 
companies, higher performing firms were better at creating, distributing, and applying 
knowledge.56 A recent study of KM in 131 Korean companies showed that those that 
combined strategies for managing both internal-oriented tacit knowledge and external￾oriented objective knowledge performed the best.57
Despite these success stories, there appears to be considerable room for improving 
OL interventions. A longitudinal analysis of Royal Dutch Shell described its rise and fall 
as a “premier learning organization” and questioned whether such a strategy could be 
institutionalized.58 Argyris and Schon state that they are unaware of any organization 
that has fully implemented a double-loop learning (Model II) system.59 Accenture, a 
pioneer in KM, experienced problems applying a standardized KM system across its 
global operations primarily because it did not take into account local and regional 
differences in how knowledge is generated and used.60 A comprehensive study of KM 
in 431 U.S. and European firms also suggests that organizations may have more prob￾lems implementing KM practices than is commonly reported in the popular media.61
Only 46% of the companies reported above-average performance in “generating new 
knowledge.” Ratings were even lower for “embedding knowledge in processes, prod￾ucts, and/or services” (29%) and “transferring existing knowledge into other parts of 
the organization” (13%). Another study of 31 KM projects across 20 organizations 
revealed that KM contributed to the fundamental transformation of only three of the 
firms studied.62 Many of the companies, however, reported operational improvements 
in product development, customer support, software development, patent manage￾ment, and education and training. Because many of the existing reports of OL and KM 
outcomes are case studies or anecdotal reports, more systematic research is need to 
assess the effects of these popular interventions.application 21.2
Implementing a Knowledge Management 
System at Motorola Penang
Launched in 1974, Motorola Penang (MP) has 
become one of the largest and most respected 
hi-tech companies in Malaysia. The 3,500-person 
company produces two-way communication prod￾ucts for public safety and enterprise applications, 
including Motorola’s iDEN and WiMAX chipsets. 
MP is structured into supply chain and R&D units. 
Supply chain includes forecasting, purchasing, 
manufacturing, quality, and logistics functions. 
MP’s factory is highly automated and includes 21 
manufacturing lines with more than 12 million 
units’ capacity. It exports more than US$1 billion 
worth of products annually.
Since mid-1990s, Malaysia’s manufacturing sector 
faced severe competitive pressures. Globalization, 
combined with increased raw materials costs, prod￾uct complexity, and customer expectations, pushed 
MP to rethink how it did business. At the same 
time, the firm’s strong reputation and manufactur￾ing capability encouraged other Motorola businesses 
to transfer their products to the Penang facility. As 
a result, MP became a “condo factory” where mul￾tiple product groups from multiple businesses oper￾ated on the same production floor. This diversity of 
products, technologies, and employees combined 
with the 24  7, three-shift operating system posed 
challenging problems. As each new product group 
was added, it tended to work independently and did 
not communicate with other product groups. Rather 
than jointly solve common problems, resources 
were wasted, manpower was poorly utilized, and 
opportunities for cost and productivity improve￾ment went untapped. Because of MP’s increased 
scale and complexity of operations, knowledge 
sharing became extremely difficult. Information 
about online performance, machine maintenance 
history, and the outcomes of troubleshooting was 
not captured and leveraged for efficient learning 
and improvement. On top of all this, MP needed to 
re-skill existing employees and get new hires up to 
speed to support the product growth.
To address these challenges, MP’s Engineering 
Director brought together the different manufac￾turing leaders to form an “integrated knowledge 
management system” team. The team’s aim was 
to maximize knowledge sharing at the factory to 
make problem solving more proactive, effective, and 
efficient. An integrated system for data gathering and 
retrieval was envisioned. It would break down com￾munication barriers, facilitate problem solving and 
change, and support more “on-demand” training.
The team started by diagnosing MP’s existing 
knowledge-sharing processes. It concluded that 
the implementation of an integrated KM system 
needed to account for the organization’s culture, 
especially its behavioral norms and shared lan￾guage. Specifically, to communicate effectively 
and efficiently, the new KM system would need to 
be based on a clear and understandable platform 
or taxonomy. A good taxonomy would enable 
users to navigate easily to needed documents and 
quickly assess their relevance and apply them 
to specific problems. The KM system would also 
need to be aligned to corporate goals so people 
could visualize the “big picture” and see where 
their contributions applied. Perhaps most impor￾tant, the new system would need to proactively 
involve individuals in action planning and learn￾ing, thus taking advantage of MP’s long tradition of 
employee participation.
Next, the team designed the new KM system to fit 
these requirements. It structured the system into 
three layers (see figure below). Senior executives 
defined the top layer, which included the overall 
business goals that drive performance at MP. The 
middle layer translated those goals downward to the 
firm’s various organizational and functional units 
having to do with specific products or functions. The 
bottom and most fundamental layer included the 
concrete actions needed to drive performance and 
achieve results. They represented the day-to-day 
performances of the engineers, technicians, and 
line operators. The new KM system reflected MP’s 
language and therefore enabled users across the 
organization to share a common “mind map” for 
synchronizing their actions toward common goals 
and performance. Hence, it was given the name 
“Actions to Performance.”
Implementing the Actions to Performance sys￾tem took almost a decade. The change strategy 
started small, with only a few groups participating. 552 PART 6 Strategic Change Interventions
For example, MP’s engineers used a paper-based 
“problem-cause-solution” tracking system to record 
their daily troubleshooting activities on manufac￾turing operations. This information was compiled 
and used in daily operations meetings where 
engineers spoke with coworkers across product 
lines to identify shared technical problems, to offer 
solutions, and to create new knowledge that might 
be used for future problem solving. As the process 
gained acceptance, additional people and groups 
got involved. Eventually, the paper-based tracking 
process migrated into a computerized database sys￾tem. Leveraging Motorola’s intranet system tools, 
knowledge sharing became more sophisticated 
and efficient. When information was published 
electronically, knowledge sharing among engineers 
could occur without time and space constraints. 
Knowledge could be searched and retrieved any￾time and anywhere.
Next, corporate initiatives were leveraged to cre￾ate greater awareness and use of the KM system 
among MP’s entire workforce. Company-wide 
programs, such as Teaming for Excellence and 
Technical Symposium, directly involved front-line 
technicians and operators in managing knowledge. 
Kiosk stations were set up on the production floor 
to provide key information on machine perform￾ance, quality, and problem-solving histories. The 
human resources department incorporated KM 
training into people’s development plans, tied KM 
to larger workforce transformations, and helped 
nurture a continuous improvement culture.
MP’s recent introduction of Digital Six Sigma (DSS) 
provided another opportunity to integrate the KM 
system with other organization processes. DSS 
focused on aligning the organization’s business 
goals to major initiatives to achieve them. As part 
of this effort, the online KM system evolved into 
a broader user interface that was Web-based and 
user friendly. It provided a “digital dashboard” 
that displayed performance measures continu￾ously. People could log in to this system anytime, 
anywhere in the world and obtain real-time infor￾mation. The digital dashboard enabled managers, 
engineers, and workers to make good decisions and 
take timely actions. Another KM interface helped 
people perform specific data analyses to support 
decisions about machine downtime, maintenance, 
and quality. Still another user interface facilitated 
data entry so that users could provide feedback 
on actions that had been taken. When line opera￾tors performed basic troubleshooting tasks on the

Motorola Penang has reaped numerous benefits 
from its integrated KM system. Once line operators 
mastered the system, they used the information to 
perform basic machine troubleshooting. In addition, 
best practices were shared across the organization 
and people took ownership to improve MP’s per￾formance. The KM system provided a common 
communication platform for workers, staff, and 
managers. It promoted a culture of continuous 
improvement and knowledge sharing. The online 
availability of performance data in real time facili￾tates MP’s move toward a virtual factory. In terms 
of hard numbers, MP’s total quality has improved 
threefold, and defect levels for all manufacturing 
lines have been reduced by at least 50%.
BUILT-TO-CHANGE ORGANIZATIONS
One of the newest continuous change interventions involves designing an entire 
organization for change and not just for normal operations. Based on extensive action 
research at the University of Southern California’s Center for Effective Organizations, 
Lawler and Worley have developed a built-to-change (B2C) approach to designing 
organizations.63 It is based on the simple fact that most organizations are designed 
for stability and dependable operations. Their design elements and managerial prac￾tices reinforce predictable behaviors aimed at sustaining a particular competitive 
advantage. Lawler and Worley argue that many change efforts are unsuccessful, not 
because of human resistance or lack of visionary leadership, but because organizations 
are designed to be stable. Such built-in stability can be a recipe for failure in rapidly 
changing environments. In these situations, the ability to change constantly is the best 
sustainable source of competitive advantage. The B2C intervention helps organizations 
design themselves for change.
Design Guidelines
The B2C intervention includes guidelines such as the following for how organization 
design components can be configured to promote change:
Managing Talent. B2C designs are geared to selecting, developing, and mana￾ging the right talent for change. Selection practices seek quick learners who want 
to take initiative, desire professional growth, and thrive on change. Employment 
contracts specify clearly that change is to be expected and support for change is a 
condition of employment and a path to success. Rather than specific job descrip￾tions, members are encouraged to discover what needs to be done by frequent 
goal-setting reviews where tasks are constantly assessed and revised. Training and 
development are continuous and aimed at supporting change and gaining value￾added skills and knowledge.
Reward System. Rewards play a key role in motivating and reinforcing change 
in B2C organizations. Individual or team bonuses are tied directly to change goals, 
learning new things, and performing new tasks well. This establishes a clear line of 
sight between rewards and change activities. Bonuses can include one-time rewards 
given at the end of a particular change effort, or rewards targeted to different phases 554 PART 6 Strategic Change Interventions
of the change process. B2C designs also shift the basis of rewards from jobs to people. 
Members are rewarded for what they can do, not for the particular job they perform. 
Because jobs and tasks are continually changing, people are motivated to learn new 
skills and knowledge, thus keeping pace with change and enhancing their long-term 
value to the organization.
Structure. B2C designs emphasize flat, lean, and flexible organization structures 
that can be reconfigured quickly when the circumstances demand. These organic 
designs—process, matrix, and network structures, for example—put decision making 
into the hands of those closest to the work and the environment. They enable mem￾bers to process information, share it with relevant others, and make decisions rapidly. 
Organic designs keep the organization closely connected with the environment, so 
that it can detect external changes and create innovative responses to them.
Information and Decision Processes. In B2C organizations, information and 
decision making are moved throughout the organization to wherever they are 
needed. These performance-based systems ensure that information is transparent 
and current and that it provides a clear picture of how the organization is per￾forming relative to its competitors. They enable organizations to make timely and 
relevant decisions to keep pace with changing conditions.
Leadership. B2C designs stress the importance of shared leadership throughout 
the organization. Rather than having the organization rely on centralized sources 
of power and control, these designs spread leadership across multiple levels of the 
organization. This speeds decision making and response rates because those lower in 
the organization need not have to wait for top-down direction. It provides leadership 
experience and skills to a broad array of members, thus developing a strong cadre 
of leadership talent. Shared leadership supports continuous change by spreading 
change expertise and commitment across the organization. It increases the chances 
that competent leaders will be there to keep the change process moving forward.
Application Stages
Lawler and Worley stress that not all organizations should be built to change, though 
most could benefit from applying some B2C principles. This intervention is mainly for 
organizations having problems adapting to complex and rapidly changing environments. 
For them, the following five initiatives can help the transition to a B2C organization:
Create a Change-Friendly Identity. This first stage addresses organization 
identity—the established set of core values, norms, and beliefs shared by organiza￾tion members. Similar to organization culture, identity is the most stable part of an 
organization; it is deep-seated, taken for granted, and guides decisions and behaviors 
like an invisible hand. Organization identity can promote or hinder the transition 
to B2C depending on whether it supports change or stability. In many traditionally 
designed organizations, values and norms reinforce stability and predictability, thus 
making change difficult. To move toward a change-friendly identity requires sur￾facing existing values and norms, assessing their relevance to change, and making 
appropriate adjustments. This typically involves highly interactive sessions where 
relevant stakeholders openly discuss and debate questions about the organization’s 
identity and how it can be “reframed” to be more change friendly. Attention is 
directed at creating values and norms that focus behavior on the organization’s 
environment and help members see change as necessary and natural. To enhance 
member commitment to a new change-friendly identity, these new or reframed 
values and norms are placed in the context of important external pressures facing 
the organization and what these mean for its effectiveness. The organization’s exist￾ing design is also assessed in relation to the new identity, and plans are made for 
changing specific components using the B2C guidelines outlined above.
1.CHAPTER 21 Continuous Change 555
Pursue Proximity. This step helps the organization get closer to current and 
possible future environments. Starting from the organization’s identity, the 
intervention looks outward to gain a clearer picture of environmental demands 
and opportunities. Rather than try to predict what’s going to happen, attention 
is directed at developing scenarios of possible and desired future environments. 
Senior executives commit significant time to thinking about the future and to 
creating possible paths to future success using various scenario-planning meth￾ods. They identify how the organization’s core competencies and capabilities can 
contribute to making desired futures happen. This is then translated into a robust 
strategy for what needs to be done to move the organization and the competitive 
environment in the desired directions.
Build an Orchestration Capability. This stage helps the organization gain the 
ability to implement the strategy and to execute change effectively. It first specifies 
the events and decisions necessary to make the strategy happen, including how 
new competencies will be developed, if necessary. Then, based on the B2C belief 
that the ability to change is the key to competitive advantage, attention is directed 
at building this change capability into the organization. This involves three related 
activities. First, change management skills are developed widely in the organization 
by hiring people with those skills and by training existing managers and employees 
to acquire those skills. Second, an organization effectiveness function is created 
with competencies in strategic planning, organization design, and change manage￾ment. This center of excellence is usually staffed by professionals from the strategic 
planning and human resources functions; they provide advice and facilitation for 
planning and executing change in the organization. Third, organization members 
learn how to apply their change capability by engaging in organizational changes 
and reflecting on that experience. This so-called “learning by doing” is essential for 
building an orchestration capability. It provides members with the hands-on expe￾rience and reflective learning necessary to hone their change skills in action.
Establish Strategic Adjustment as a Normal Condition. This step involves 
creating dynamic alignment in implementing strategy, developing new capabilities, 
and fitting organization design elements to emerging environmental demands. In 
fast-paced environments, the organization must continually make strategic adjust￾ments as part of normal operations. It must constantly work at changing and 
coordinating all of the organization design elements so that they promote new 
strategies and capabilities and respond to shifting environmental demands and 
opportunities. Keys to making strategic adjustment a standard practice include 
pushing decision making downward in the organization, sharing relevant informa￾tion widely, giving members the relevant skills and knowledge, and measuring and 
rewarding the right things. These “employee empowerment” practices (described 
in Chapter 15) reinforce the enormous value placed on human resources in B2C 
organizations; they also provide the structures, talent, and systems to support con￾tinual change and adjustment.
Seek Virtuous Spirals. This last stage involves bringing all of the prior processes 
together to pursue a series of temporary competitive advantages. This so-called 
“hit and run” approach rests on the logic that in turbulent environments, suc￾cess results from identifying future opportunities, organizing to take advantage of 
them, and then moving on to the next opportunity when things change. Because 
specific sources of competitive advantage do not last long, B2C organizations con￾tinually modify their capabilities and designs to take advantage of emerging pros￾pects. They constantly work to balance the short and long runs, to keep close to 
an unfolding environment, to sustain dynamic alignment among their design ele￾ments and capabilities. When they do this for long periods of time, a virtuous spiral 
results. The organization’s design and capabilities support a successful strategy,

which in turn provides the rewards and motivation to create even better designs 
and capabilities for newer strategies, and so on. In rapidly changing environments, 
B2C organizations are more capable of seeking and creating virtuous spirals than 
traditional organizations.
Application 21.3 describes how Capital One Financial created a built-to-change organi￾zation. It shows how change capability is built into the firm’s strategy, design features, 
and culture.
SUMMARY
In this chapter, we presented interventions for helping organizations change themselves 
continually. These change processes are particularly applicable for organizations facing 
turbulent environments where traditional sources of competitive advantage erode quickly. 
Building change capabilities directly into the organization is essential to constantly renew 
forms of competitive advantage to keep pace with a rapidly shifting environment.
A self-design change strategy helps a firm gain the capacity to design and implement 
its own continuous change. Self-design involves multiple levels of the firm and mul￾tiple stakeholders and includes an iterative series of activities: acquiring knowledge, 
valuing, diagnosing, designing, implementing, and assessing.
Organization learning and knowledge management interventions help organiza￾tions develop and use knowledge to change and improve themselves continually. 
Organization learning interventions address how organizations can be designed to 
promote effective learning processes and how those learning processes themselves can 
be improved. An organization designed to promote learning can create a continuous 
stream of valuable knowledge. Knowledge management focuses on how that knowl￾edge can be organized and used to improve organization performance.
Built-to-change organizations are designed for change, not stability. They are based 
on design guidelines that promote change capability in the firm’s talent management, 
reward systems, structure, information and decision processes, and leadership. In a 
rapidly changing environment, this change capability can be a source of sustained 
competitive advantage.

Capital One, a leading financial services firm and a 
top issuer of credit cards in the United States, has 
built an organization that does not view change 
as an unwanted intruder or as an afterthought to 
get resistors to buy into a new initiative. Rather, 
change capability is integrated into every aspect of 
Capital One’s strategy, structure, and culture. This 
enables the firm to execute change routinely.
Capital One treats strategic planning as a continuous 
process of exploring alternative futures and gaining 
momentary advantages in a fast-paced competitive 
environment. According to Mike McDermott, former 
Director of Organization Effectiveness, “Strategic 
thinking goes pretty deep on two levels. On one 
level, the strategic planning department runs a 
variety of scenarios that look several years out.” 
As described by CEO and Founder Rich Fairbank, 
“Eighty percent of strategy is figuring out where 
the world is going, and twenty percent is figuring 
out what you are going to do in response. If you 
can figure out whe``re the world is going, what you 
need to do usually becomes obvious.” For example, 
Capital One might explore the broader forces affect￾ing interest rates or the impact of changes in China’s 
monetary policy. Each business line, in turn, would 
consider how these future trends might affect 
its particular business. “On another level,” notes 
McDermott, “the executive committee meets regu￾larly to discuss and debate a set of annual ‘impera￾tives’ or bold challenges. The imperatives are just 
that . . . they are things that must be done if we are 
to achieve our long-term vision.” They are intended 
to provide Capital One with a series of temporary 
competitive advantages.
This robust strategizing enables Capital One to “test 
and learn” how best to compete in a constantly 
changing environment. It combines educated 
guesses about how the environment is changing 
with rigorous analysis of consumer behaviors to 
produce testable propositions about what credit 
services to offer specific consumer groups. When 
a consumer group and its associated service reach 
a certain threshold of business, a potential com￾petitive advantage exists. The service then is broad￾ened to a larger customer base. Because consumer 
profiles, competitor behaviors, and other market 
forces are constantly changing, however, any cur￾rent advantage is fleeting and new ones must be 
identified to grow revenues. Moreover, to mon￾etize a competitive advantage even in the short 
run, Capital One must often modify its human 
capital, resources, systems, and structures. Thus, it 
constantly renews itself as it moves from one com￾petitive advantage to the next.
To adapt quickly to gain new competitive advan￾tages, Capital One has developed a highly agile 
organization design. It begins with hiring people 
who have a passion for excellence, collaborate well 
with others, and thrive in a changing environment. 
Once hired, associates are given challenging work 
assignments and opportunities to develop new 
skills as business needs change. Complimenting 
the selection process is a decentralized and fluid 
organization structure, with few layers of manage￾ment and decision making pushed downward in 
the organization. Associates are allowed to take 
on a variety of tasks without having to worry 
about job descriptions and pay grades. An adapt￾able performance management system completes 
Capital One’s flexible design. It focuses on both 
performance and development. Rewards are tied 
directly to current results as well as to developing 
competencies the organization believes are impor￾tant for its future.
The final feature of Capital One’s built-to-change 
organization involves change capability. In the 
past, the firm’s aggressive growth often left associ￾ates feeling overwhelmed by the rapidly changing 
product/service offerings. Adding to the stress 
were frequent updates in associates’ knowledge 
base, reorganizations that tested their ability to 
remain flexible and to take on new assignments, 
and modifications in work processes and methods 
to maintain customer satisfaction. To make change 
manageable and even routine, Capital One charged 
McDermott with developing the firm’s change 
capability. With the help of a design team com￾posed of HR generalists and line managers, he cre￾ated a unique approach to change management.
Most organizations develop change capability by 
deploying HR generalists to facilitate change in 
business units or by creating a center of excellence

at Capital One Financial560 PART 6 Strategic Change Interventions
in change management staffed mainly by OD pro￾fessionals. Capital One created a more embedded 
strategy. It rooted change skills and responsibili￾ties directly into the roles of line managers. This 
promised to radically shorten the cycle time of 
change because managers would have the exper￾tise needed to carry out most changes on their 
own. But tasking managers with change manage￾ment responsibilities raised important questions 
about Capital One’s commitment to change capa￾bility as a source of competitive advantage. Critics 
argued, “Shouldn’t the focus of line managers 
be on getting business results?” The design team 
answered affirmatively, of course, but then added 
that in fast changing environments, this was not 
enough to succeed. Managers needed to be able to 
combine their business expertise with knowledge 
about change so that strategies to acquire new 
competitive advantages could be implemented 
faster and their benefits gained sooner.
Capital One’s embedded approach was based on 
a standardized change methodology that every￾one shared and learned. Called ADKAR, it pro￾posed that successful change followed a process of
(1) creating awareness of the need for change, 
(2) having the desire to change, (3) possessing the 
knowledge to change, (4) having the ability to change, 
and (5) being reinforced for change. The change 
model included a common language and mindset for 
thinking and communicating about organizational 
change; it afforded Capital One a highly efficient 
approach to change management. For example, 
service changes often required cooperation among 
the credit card business, IT services, and the regula￾tory compliance and HR departments. Because all 
parties were familiar and comfortable with the same 
change model, coordination costs and change cycle 
times were significantly reduced. This contrasted to 
earlier times when Capital One employed over 17 
different change models and more than 160 differ￾ent change tools throughout the firm.
To implement the new change method, McDermott’s 
team applied three action levers: knowledge/skill 
acquisition, visible demonstrations, and alignment 
with performance management. First, Capital 
One’s corporate university offered two courses to 
build people’s change knowledge and skill. One 
course, attended by both managers and staff, went 
deep into the change methodology and provided 
the opportunity to apply it to existing change 
projects. This helped participants learn by doing, 
while driving change in the organization. The 
second course was a one-day program designed 
for line managers. It provided an overview of the 
methodology and linked it to the organization’s 
values and leadership competencies. This helped 
managers see the connection between change 
capability and performance management.
Second, McDermott’s team targeted several large￾scale change projects as visible demonstrations of 
the change model. This created an internal “buzz” 
for the methodology and encouraged people to learn 
how to apply it. For example, McDermott’s team 
highlighted change initiatives coming out of a stra￾tegic imperative called ACE (Achieving Corporate 
Excellence): a large-scale systems conversion proj￾ect, an HR reengineering effort, and a workplace 
redesign process called the Future of Work.
Third, McDermott’s team worked closely with a 
group revising Capital One’s performance man￾agement system to ensure that it measured and 
rewarded change management competencies. 
Together, the two groups increased the number of 
change-related behaviors that were rated, assessed, 
and rewarded. This sent a clear message about the 
importance of these behaviors for the future.
Capital One’s built-to-change organization is widely 
accepted and firmly entrenched in the firm’s cul￾ture. Change capability is treated like a muscle that 
gets better with exercise. Not surprisingly, Capital 
One engages in lots of change and is getting better 
and better at it. Its change capability is a key source 
of sustained competitive advantage. As one execu￾tive put it, “We can take on more change because 
with this new muscle, it doesn’t seem like we are 
changing all that much. It feels like we are chang￾ing less because we are capable of handling more 
change than our competitors.”Transorganizational Change
This chapter describes interventions that move 
beyond the single organization to include 
merging, allying, or networking with other 
organizations. These multiorganization change 
programs are becoming more prevalent in OD 
as organizations extend their boundaries to 
keep pace with highly complex and rapidly 
changing environments. Under these condi￾tions, organizations may merge with or acquire 
other firms to gain essential capabilities and 
resources, to operate at a larger scale, and to 
enter new markets. They may form strategic 
alliances with other organizations to share costs 
and expertise and to manage their exchanges 
more efficiently. They may join with other firms 
to tackle complex problems and projects that 
single organizations cannot accomplish.
Transorganizational change helps organiza￾tions create and sustain such multiorganization 
linkages. It helps organizations transcend the 
perspective of a single organization and address 
the needs and concerns of all involved organi￾zations. This represents a fundamental shift in 
strategic orientation because the strategies, 
goals, structures, and processes of two or more 
organizations become interdependent and 
must be coordinated and aligned. This raises 
the scope and complexity of change processes; 
it increases the chances that conflicts and mis￾understandings will occur. Transorganizational 
change calls for OD practitioners to move to 
a higher level of diagnosis and intervention 
that straddles the boundaries of different 
organizations, attends to their unique and often 
conflicting needs, and brings structure to what 
is frequently an underorganized and highly 
uncertain process. Practitioners are having to 
develop new concepts, skills, and expertise for 
implementing these change interventions.
Because transorganizational change is rela￾tively new to OD, this chapter starts with an 
explanation of the rationale underlying multi￾organization arrangements. Then, three kinds 
of interventions are described: mergers and 
acquisitions, strategic alliances, and networks.
Mergers and acquisitions leverage the 
strengths (or shore up the weaknesses) of one 
organization by combining with another organi￾zation. This transorganizational change involves 
integrating many of the interventions previ￾ously discussed in this text, including human 
process, technostructural, and human resources 
management interventions. Research and 
practice in mergers and acquisitions strongly 
suggest that OD practices can contribute to 
implementation success.
Alliance interventions, including joint ven￾tures, franchising, and long-term contracts, help 
to develop the relationship between organiza￾tions that believe the benefits of cooperation 
outweigh the costs of lowered autonomy and 
control. These increasingly common arrange￾ments require each organization to understand 
its goals and strategy in the relationship, build 
and leverage trust, and ensure that it is receiv￾ing the expected benefits.
Finally—and building on the knowledge of 
alliances—network interventions are concerned 
with helping a group or system of organizations 
engage in relationships to perform tasks or to 
solve problems that are too complex and mul￾tifaceted for a single organization to resolve. 
These multiorganization systems abound in 
today’s environment and include research and 
development consortia, public–private part￾nerships, and constellations of profit-seeking 
organizations. They tend to be loosely coupled 
and nonhierarchical, and consequently they 
22562 PART 6 Strategic Change Interventions
TRANSORGANIZATIONAL RATIONALE
More and more, organizations are linking with other organizations to achieve their 
objectives. These transorganizational strategies can provide additional resources for 
large-scale research and development; spread the risks of innovation; apply diverse 
expertise to complex problems and tasks; make information or technology available 
to learn and develop new capabilities; position the organization to achieve economies 
of scale or scope; and gain access to new, especially international, marketplaces.1 For 
example, pharmaceutical firms form strategic alliances to distribute noncompeting 
medications and to avoid the high costs of establishing sales organizations; firms from 
different countries form joint ventures to overcome restrictive trade barriers; and high￾technology firms form research consortia to undertake significant and costly research 
and development for their industries.
More generally, however, transorganizational strategies allow organizations to per￾form tasks that are too costly and complicated for single organizations to perform.2
These tasks include the full range of organizational activities, including purchasing raw 
materials, hiring and compensating organization members, manufacturing and service 
delivery, obtaining investment capital, marketing and distribution, and strategic plan￾ning. The key to understanding transorganizational strategies is recognizing that these 
individual tasks must be coordinated with each other. Whenever a good or service from 
one of these tasks is exchanged between two units (individuals, departments, or orga￾nizations), a transaction occurs. Transactions can be designed and managed internally 
within the organization’s structure, or externally between organizations. For example, 
organizations can acquire a raw materials provider and operate these tasks as part of 
internal operations or they can collaborate with a raw material supplier through long￾term contracts in an alliance.
Economists and organization theorists have spent considerable effort investigat￾ing when transorganizational strategies work best. They have developed frameworks, 
primarily transaction cost theory and agency theory, that are useful for understanding 
these interventions.3
 As a rule, transorganizational strategies work well when trans￾actions occur frequently and are well understood. Many organizations, for example, 
outsource their payroll tasks because the inputs, such as hours worked, pay rates, and 
employment status; the throughputs, such as tax rates and withholdings; and the out￾puts occur regularly and are governed by well-known laws and regulations. Moreover, 
if transactions involve people, equipment, or other assets that are unique to the task, 
then transorganizational linkage is the preferred approach. For example, Microsoft 
works with a variety of value-added resellers, independent software vendors, and small 
and large consulting businesses to bring their products to customers ranging in size 
from individual consumers to the largest business enterprises in the world. An internal 
sales and service department to handle the unique demands of each customer segment 
would be much more expensive to implement and would not deliver the same level 
of quality as the partner organizations. In general, relationships between and among 
organizations become more formalized as the frequency of interaction increases, the 
type of information and other resources that are exchanged become more proprietary, 
and the number of different types of exchanges increases.4
Cummings has referred to groups of organizations that have joined together for a com￾mon purpose as transorganizational systems (TSs).5
 TSs are functional social systems existing 
intermediately between single organizations on the one hand and societal systems on the 
require methods different from most traditional 
OD interventions that are geared to single 
organizations. These methods help organiza￾tions recognize the need for transorganiza￾tional partnerships and develop coordinating 
structures for carrying them out.CHAPTER 22 Transorganizational Change 563
other. These multiorganization systems can make decisions and perform tasks on behalf 
of their member organizations, although members maintain their separate organizational 
identities and goals. This separation distinguishes TSs from mergers and acquisitions.
In contrast to most organizational systems, TSs tend to be underorganized. 
Relationships among member organizations are loosely coupled; leadership and power 
are dispersed among autonomous organizations, rather than hierarchically centralized; 
and commitment and membership are tenuous as member organizations act to main￾tain their autonomy while jointly performing. These characteristics make creating and 
managing TSs difficult.6
 Potential member organ izations may not perceive the need to 
join with other organizations. They may be concerned with maintaining their auton￾omy or have trouble identifying potential partners. U.S. firms, for example, are tradi￾tionally “rugged individualists” preferring to work alone rather than to join with other 
organizations. Even if organizations decide to join together, they may have problems 
managing their relationships and controlling joint performances. Because members 
typically are accustomed to hierarchical forms of control, they may have difficulty 
managing lateral relations among independent organizations. They also may have dif￾ficulty managing different levels of commitment and motivation among members and 
sustaining membership over time. The network interventions described in this chapter 
can help TSs understand and address these problems.
Mergers and Acquisitions
Mergers and acquisitions (M&As) involve the combination of two organizations. The 
term merger refers to the integration of two previously independent organizations into 
a completely new organization; acquisition involves the purchase of one organization 
by another for integration into the acquiring organization. M&As are distinct from the 
interventions described later in this chapter because at least one of the organizations 
ceases to exist. The stressful dynamics associated with M&As led one researcher to call 
them the “ultimate change management challenge.”7
Organizations have a number of reasons for wanting to acquire or merge with other 
firms, including diversification or vertical integration; gaining access to global mar￾kets, technology, or other resources; and achieving operational efficiencies, improved 
innovation, or resource sharing.8
 As a result, M&As have become a preferred method 
for rapid growth and strategic change. In 2007, for example, the worth of M&A deals 
reached an all-time high of over $4.4 trillion globally, with 40% of that total involving 
cross-border M&As.9
 Recent large transactions include Cerberus and Chrysler, AT&T 
and Bell South, Google and YouTube, News Corporation and Dow Jones, Royal Bank 
of Scotland and ABN Amro, Nestle and Gerber Products, Walt Disney Company and 
Pixar, P&G and Gillette, and Wachovia and Golden West Financial.
Despite M&As’ popularity, they have a questionable record of success.10 Among the 
reasons commonly cited for merger failure are inadequate due diligence processes, lack of 
a compelling strategic rationale, unrealistic expectations of synergy, paying too much for 
the transaction, conflicting corporate cultures, and failure to move quickly.
M&A interventions typically are preceded by an examination of the organization’s 
strategy. Executives must decide whether their strategic goals should be achieved 
by either an internal change or a multiorganization arrangement, such as an M&A, 
strategic alliance, or network. Mergers and acquisitions are preferred when internal 
development is considered too slow or when strategic alliances or networks do not offer 
sufficient control over key resources to meet the firm’s objectives.
In addition to the OD issues described here, M&As are complex changes that involve 
legal and financial knowledge beyond the scope of this text. OD practitioners are 
encouraged to seek out and work with specialists in these other relevant disciplines. 
The focus here is on how OD can contribute to M&A success.564 PART 6 Strategic Change Interventions
Application Stages
Mergers and acquisitions involve three major phases as shown in Table 22.1: precombi￾nation, legal combination, and operational combination.11 OD practitioners can make 
substantive contributions to the precombination and operational combination phases 
as described below.
Precombination Phase This first phase consists of planning activities designed to 
ensure the success of the combined organization. The organization that initiates the 
M&A must identify a candidate organization, work with it to gather information about 
each other, and plan the implementation and integration activities. Research shows 
that precombination activities are critical to M&A success.12 These include:
Search for and Select Candidate. This involves developing screening criteria to 
assess and narrow the field of candidate organizations, agreeing on a first-choice 
candidate, assessing regulatory compliance, establishing initial contacts, and for￾mulating a letter of intent. Criteria for choosing an M&A partner can include lead￾ership and management characteristics, market access resources, technical or 
financial capabilities, physical facilities, and so on. OD practitioners can add value 
at this stage of the process by encouraging screening criteria that include manage￾rial, organizational, and cultural components as well as technical and financial 
aspects. In practice, financial issues tend to receive greater attention at this stage,

with the goal of maximizing shareholder value. Failure to attend to cultural and 
organizational issues, however, can result in diminished shareholder value during 
the operational combination phase.13
Identifying potential candidates, narrowing the field, agreeing on a first choice, 
and checking regulatory compliance are relatively straightforward activities. They 
generally involve investment brokers and other outside parties who have access 
to databases of organizational, financial, and technical information. The final two 
activities, making initial contacts and creating a letter of intent, are aimed at deter￾mining the candidate’s interest in the proposed merger or acquisition.
Create an M&A Team. Once there is initial agreement between the two organiza￾tions to pursue a merger or acquisition, senior leaders from the respective orga￾nizations appoint an M&A team to establish the business case, to oversee the due 
diligence process, and to develop a merger integration plan.14 This team typically 
comprises senior executives and experts in such areas as business valuation, tech￾nology, organization, and marketing. OD practitioners can facilitate formation of 
this team through human process interventions, such as team building and process 
consultation, and help the team establish clear goals and action strategies. They 
can also help members define a leadership structure, apply relevant skills and 
knowledge, and ensure that both organizations are represented appropriately. The 
group’s leadership structure, or who will be accountable for the team’s accomplish￾ments, is especially critical. In an acquisition, an executive from the acquiring firm 
is typically the team’s leader. In a merger of equals, the choice of a single individual 
to lead the team is more difficult, but essential. The outcome of this decision and 
the process used to make it are the first outward symbols of how this transorgani￾zational change will be conducted.
Establish the Business Case. The purpose of this activity is to develop a prima facie 
case that combining the two organizations will result in a competitive advantage 
that exceeds their separate advantages.15 It includes specifying the strategic vision, 
competitive strategy, and systems integration potential for the M&A. OD practitio￾ners can facilitate this discussion to ensure that each issue is fully explored. If the 
business case cannot be justified on strategic, financial, or operational grounds, the 
M&A should be revisited, terminated, or another candidate should be considered.
Strategic vision represents the organizations’ combined capabilities. It synthe￾sizes the strengths of the two organizations into a viable new organization. For 
example, AT&T had a clear picture of its intentions in acquiring NCR: to “link peo￾ple, organizations, and their information in a seamless global computer network.”
Competitive strategy describes the business model for how the combined organiza￾tion will add value in a particular product market or segment of the value chain, how 
that value proposition is best performed by the combined organization (compared 
with competitors), and how it will be difficult to imitate. The purpose of this activity 
is to force the two organizations to go beyond the rhetoric of “these two organiza￾tions should merge because it’s a good fit.” The AT&T and NCR acquisition struggled, 
in part, because NCR management was told simply to “look for synergies.”16
Systems integration specifies how the two organizations will be combined. It 
addresses how and if they can work together. It includes such key questions as: 
Will one firm be acquired and operated as a wholly owned subsidiary? Does the 
transaction imply a merger of equals? Are layoffs implied, and if so, where? On 
what basis can promised synergies or cost savings be achieved?
Perform a Due Diligence Assessment. This involves evaluating whether the two 
organizations actually have the managerial, technical, and financial resources that 
each assumes the other possesses. It includes a comprehensive review of each orga￾nization’s articles of incorporation, stock option plans, organization charts, and so 
on. Financial, operational, technical, logistical, and human resources inventories

are evaluated along with other legally binding issues. The discovery of previously 
unknown or unfavorable information can halt the M&A process.
Although due diligence assessment traditionally emphasizes the financial aspects 
of M&As, this focus is increasingly being challenged by evidence that culture clashes 
between two organizations can ruin expected financial gains.17 Thus, attention to 
the cultural features of M&As is becoming more prevalent in due diligence assess￾ment. For example, Abitibi-Price applied a cultural screen as part of its due diligence 
activities along with financial and operational criteria. The process sought to iden￾tify the fit between Abitibi’s values and those of possible merger candidates. Stone 
Consolidated emerged as both a good strategic and cultural fit with Abitibi. This 
cultural assessment contributed heavily to the success of the subsequent merger. 
OD expertise can contribute significantly to M&A cultural assessment; it can help 
organizations carry out cultural due diligence sytematically and objectively.
The scope and detail of due diligence assessment depend on knowledge of the 
candidate’s business, the complexity of its industry, the relative size and risk of 
the transaction, and the available resources. Due diligence activities must reflect 
symbolically the vision and values of the combined organizations. An overly zeal￾ous assessment, for example, can contradict promises of openness and trust made 
earlier in the transaction. Missteps at this stage can lower or destroy opportunities 
for synergy, cost savings, and improved shareholder value.18
Develop Merger Integration Plans. This stage specifies how the two organizations 
will be combined.19 It defines integration objectives; the scope and timing of inte￾gration activities; organization design criteria; Day 1 requirements; and who does 
what, where, and when. The scope of these plans depends on how integrated the 
organizations will be. If the candidate organization will operate as an independent 
subsidiary with an “arm’s-length” relationship to the parent, merger integration 
planning need only specify those systems that will be common to both organiza￾tions. A full integration of the two organizations requires a more extensive plan.
Merger integration planning starts with the business case conducted earlier and 
involves more detailed analyses of the strategic vision, competitive strategy, and 
systems integration for the M&A. For example, assessment of the organizations’ 
markets and suppliers can reveal opportunities to serve customers better and to 
capture purchasing economies of scale. Examination of business processes can iden￾tify best operating practices; which physical facilities should be combined, left alone, 
or shut down; and which systems and procedures are redundant. Capital budget 
analysis can show which investments should be continued or dropped. Typically, 
the M&A team appoints subgroups composed of members from both organizations 
to perform these analyses. OD practitioners can conduct team-building and process￾consultation interventions to improve how those groups function.
Next, plans for designing the combined organization are developed. They include 
the organization’s structure, reporting relationships, human resources policies, 
information and control systems, operating logistics, work designs, and customer￾focused activities.
The final task of integration planning involves developing an action plan for 
implementing the M&A. This specifies tasks to be performed, decision-making 
authority and responsibility, and timelines for achievement. It also includes a 
process for addressing conflicts and problems that will invariably arise during the 
implementation process.
Legal Combination Phase This phase of the M&A process involves the legal and 
financial aspects of the transaction. The two organizations settle on the terms of the 
deal, register the transaction with and gain approval from appropriate regulatory 
agencies, communicate with and gain approval from shareholders, and file appropriate 
5.CHAPTER 22 Transorganizational Change 567
legal documents. In some cases, an OD practitioner can provide advice on negotiating 
a fair agreement, but this phase generally requires knowledge and expertise beyond 
that typically found in OD practice.
Operational Combination Phase This final phase involves implementing the merger 
integration plan. In practice, it begins during due diligence assessment and may con￾tinue for months or years following the legal combination phase.20 M&A implementa￾tion includes the three kinds of activities described below.
Day 1 Activities. These include communications and actions that officially start the 
implementation process. For example, announcements may be made about key 
executives of the combined organization, the location of corporate headquarters, 
the structure of tasks, and areas and functions where layoffs will occur. Special 
attention is paid to sending important symbolic messages to organization members, 
investors, and regulators about the soundness of the merger plans and the changes 
that are critical to accomplishing strategic and operational objectives.21
Operational and Technical Integration Activities. These involve the physical 
moves, structural changes, work designs, and procedures that will be implemented 
to accomplish the strategic objectives and expected cost savings of the M&A. The 
merger integration plan lists these activities, which can be large in number and 
range in scope from seemingly trivial to quite critical. For example, American 
Airlines’s acquisition of Reno Air involved changing Reno’s employee uniforms, 
the signage at all airports, marketing and public relations campaigns, repainting air￾planes, and integrating the route structures, among others. When these integration 
activities are not executed properly, the M&A process can be set back. American’s 
poor job of clarifying the wage and benefit programs caused an unauthorized pilot 
“sickout” that cancelled many flights and left thousands of travelers stranded. 
Integrating the reservation, scheduling, and pricing systems was also a critical activ￾ity. Failure to execute this task quickly could have caused American tremendous 
logistical problems, increased safety risks, and further alienated customers.
Cultural Integration Activities. These tasks are aimed at building new values and 
norms in the combined organization. Successful implementation melds both the 
technical and cultural aspects of the combined organization. For example, members 
from both organizations can be encouraged to solve business problems together, 
thus addressing operational and cultural integration issues simultaneously.22
The M&A literature contains several practical suggestions for managing the opera￾tional combination phase.23 First, the merger integration plan should be implemented 
sooner rather than later, and quickly rather than slowly. Integration of two organi￾zations generally involves aggressive financial targets, short timelines, and intense 
public scrutiny. Moreover, the change process is often plagued by culture clashes and 
political fighting. Consequently, organizations need to make as many changes as pos￾sible in the first hundred days following the legal combination phase. Quick move￾ment in key areas has several advantages. It preempts unanticipated organization 
changes that might thwart momentum in the desired direction; it reduces organiza￾tion members’ uncertainty about when things will happen; and it lessens members’ 
anxiety about the M&A’s impact on their personal situation. All three of these condi￾tions can prevent desired collaboration and other benefits from occurring.
Second, integration activities must be communicated clearly and promptly to a 
variety of stakeholders, including shareholders, regulators, customers, and orga￾nization members. M&As can increase uncertainty and anxiety about the future, 
especially for members of the involved organizations who often inquire: Will I 
have a job? Will my job change? Will I have a new boss? These kinds of questions 
can dominate conversations, reduce productive work, and spoil opportunities for 
1.
2.
3.568 PART 6 Strategic Change Interventions
collaboration. To reduce ambiguity, organizations can provide concrete answers 
through a variety of channels including company newsletters, email and intranet 
postings, press releases, video and in-person presentations, one-on-one interaction 
with managers, and so on.
Third, members from both organizations need to work together to solve implemen￾tation problems and to address customer needs. Such coordinated tasks can clarify 
work roles and relationships and contribute to member commitment and motivation. 
Moreover, when coordinated activity is directed at customer service, it can assure 
customers that their interests will be considered and satisfied during the merger.
Fourth, organizations need to assess the implementation process continually to 
identify integration problems and needs. The following questions can guide the 
assessment process:24
Have savings estimated during precombination planning been confirmed or 
exceeded?
Has the new entity identified and implemented shared strategies or oppor tunities?
Has the new organization been implemented without loss of key personnel?
Was the merger and integration process seen as fair and objective?
Is the combined company operating efficiently?
Have major problems with stakeholders been avoided?
Did the process proceed according to schedule?
Were substantive integration issues resolved?
Are people highly motivated (more so than before)?
Mergers and acquisitions are among the most complex and challenging interven￾tions facing organizations and OD practitioners. Application 22.1 describes the key 
issues that Sprint and Nextel faced in the first two years of their merger. It clearly 
demonstrates the importance of human issues in mergers and the role that OD can 
play in the process.
STRATEGIC ALLIANCE INTERVENTIONS
A strategic alliance is a formal agreement between two or more organizations to pursue a 
set of private and common goals through the sharing of resources, including intellectual 
property, people, capital, technology, capabilities, or physical assets.25 It is an important 
strategy for such organizations as British Petroleum, Eli Lilly, Corning Glass, Federal 
Express, IBM, Starbucks, Cisco Systems, Millennium Pharmaceuticals, and Siebel 
Systems. The term strategic alliance generally refers to any collaborative effort between 
two or more organizations, including licensing agreements, franchises, long-term con￾tracts, and joint ventures. Franchising is a common collaborative strategy.26 Companies 
such as McDonald’s, Kinko’s, or Holiday Inn license their name and know-how to inde￾pendent organizations that deliver the service and leverage the brand name for market￾ing. A joint venture is a special type of strategic alliance where a third organization, jointly 
owned and operated by two (or more) organizations, is created.27 Joint ventures between 
domestic and foreign firms, such as Fuji–Xerox, can help overcome trade barriers and 
facilitate technology transfer across nations. The New United Motor Manufacturing, 
Inc., in Fremont, California, for example, is a joint venture between General Motors and 
Toyota to produce automobiles using Japanese teamwork methods.
Application Stages
The development of effective strategic alliances generally follows a process of strategy 
formulation, partner selection, alliance structuring and start-up, and alliance operation 
and adjustment.

•The Sprint and Nextel Merger:
The First Two Years
In August 2005, the telecom giants Sprint and 
Nextel announced plans to merge into a single 
company called Sprint Nextel Corp. The merger 
combined Sprint’s brand awareness with Nextel’s 
large federal market, giving the new company a 
vast portfolio of customers while opening up a host 
of new business opportunities. While the merger’s 
financial/legal side was straightforward, the task of 
combining the two companies into one could not 
have been more difficult. The two telecoms differed 
on almost every dimension. Sprint’s culture was 
traditional and bureaucratic; Nextel’s was entre￾preneurial and flexible. The firms had different 
networks, products, technologies, and processes; 
their human resources infrastructures and practices 
were completely different, as were their ages, busi￾ness cycles, and customer bases.
From the start, executives at Sprint Nextel knew that 
the human element would be crucial to merger suc￾cess. Employees at both firms were highly talented, 
experienced, and motivated, and it was imperative 
that they remain with the merged firm and become 
committed to its success. To make this happen, 
Sprint Nextel’s HR group took the early lead in 
implementing the merger. It was charged with tak￾ing a systemic look at the legacy companies to iden￾tify their best practices and to develop what would 
be best for employees in the merged firm. Equally 
important, HR needed to ensure that employees 
received timely and accurate information about the 
merger, especially what changes to expect and how 
they would affect their work lives.
HR worked closely with corporate communications 
on the pre-merger announcement and initial com￾munications program. It started with an inspiring 
webcast shown to all employees featuring the CEOs 
of both firms. This was followed quickly by sched￾uled road shows at which executives visited the 
opposite firm’s facilities to meet employees, discuss 
the merger, and answer questions. This personal 
communication was supplemented with periodic 
newsletters, webcasts, and online information 
updating employees on the merger’s progress. Sprint 
Nextel’s intranet included a “rumor mill” icon where 
employees could get correct information on ques￾tions related to the merger. The goal of all of this 
communication was to present a consistent message 
about the merger that was up-to-date, accurate, and 
addressed employees’ major concerns.
An initial worry, for example, concerned the loca￾tion of the new firm’s corporate headquarters. 
Nextel was headquartered in Reston, Virginia, and 
Sprint in Overland Park, Kansas. Executives and 
staff at the two locations were concerned about 
where the new head office would be located and 
whether they would need to endure the hard￾ship of having to move to a new locality. To quell 
rumors and reduce disruptions to employees’ lives, 
Sprint Nextel quickly announced that it would 
retain both company headquarters, with execu￾tive headquarters being located in Reston and 
operational headquarters in Overland Park. Only 
78 employees wound up having to relocate.
Another concern had to do with the inevitable 
workforce reductions that follow major mergers. 
Because Sprint and Nextel operated in the same 
industry, duplications and redundancies in jobs 
were common when the two firms merged, espe￾cially when their legacy systems and procedures 
were integrated during implementation. With HR’s 
lead, reductions were handled with a good deal of 
personal care and respect to those leaving the firm, 
roughly 5,000 out of about 65,000 employees in 
the merger’s first two years. Separation packages 
and severance benefits were fair and generous, 
resulting in many people voluntarily taking them. 
Those who chose to leave, for instance, received 
severance pay based on criteria existing either just 
before the merger date or at the time of termination, 
whichever resulted in the highest payout.
To assess the merger’s progress, HR periodically 
surveyed employees and fed that information back 
to executives so they could take corrective actions. 
During the merger’s first two years, data showed 
high ratings for management quality and employee 
engagement in work. Scores for employee com￾mitment to the new firm and intent to stay were 
lower, however, suggesting the need to address and 
resolve those issues. In commenting on the how 
well the new firm was developing its own cultural 
identity, Sandra Price, the head of HR, suggested 
an informal indicator of merger development: how 
often she heard the word “legacy” connected to the 
employees of the former firms. Price reported that 
“sometime between the 12th and 15th months, I 
began hearing that word less,” and now at the two￾year mark, “I seldom hear it anymore [as applied 
to employees].”
application 22.1570 PART 6 Strategic Change Interventions
Alliance Strategy Formulation. The first step in developing strategic alliances is 
to clarify the business strategy and understand why an alliance is an appropriate 
method to implement it. About one-half to two-thirds of alliances fail to meet their 
financial objectives, and the number one reason for that failure is the lack of a clear 
strategy.28 For example, Collins found that alliance success was heavily influenced 
by the alignment of the partner to the company’s “hedgehog concept” or what it 
is best at doing.29 If the organization understood its passion, distinctive capabili￾ties, and economic drivers, it was more likely to develop alliances that supported 
its strategy. Thus, it is important to pursue alliances according to a “collaboration 
logic.”30 The alliance must be seen as a more effective way of organizing and oper￾ating than developing new capabilities to perform the work in-house; acquiring or 
merging with another organization; or buying the capabilities from another orga￾nization in a transactional relationship.
Partner Selection. Once the reasons for a strategic alliance are clear, the search for an 
appropriate partner or partners begins. Alliances always involve a cost/benefit trade￾off; while the organization typically gains access to new markets or new capabilities, 
it does so at the cost of yielding some autonomy and control over its activities.
Similar to identifying merger and acquisition candidates discussed previously, 
this step involves developing screening criteria, agreeing on candidates, establish￾ing initial contacts, and formulating a letter of intent. A good alliance partnership 
will leverage both similarities and differences to create competitive advantage. 
Compatible management styles, cultures, goals, information technologies, or opera￾tions are important similarities that can smooth alliance formation and implementa￾tion. However, different perspectives, technologies, capabilities, and other resources 
can complement existing ones and be good sources of learning and value in the 
partnership. These differences can also be a source of frustration for the alliance. 
OD practitioners can add value at this stage of the process by helping potential alli￾ance partners explore and understand their similarities and differences. In addition, 
the way the alliance begins and proceeds is an important ingredient in building 
trust, a characteristic of successful alliances explored more fully in the next step.
Alliance Structuring and Start-up. Following agreement to enter into an alliance, 
the focus shifts to how to structure the partnership and build and leverage trust 
in the relationship. First, an appropriate governance structure must be chosen and 
can include medium-to-long-term contracts, minority equity investments, equal 
equity partnerships, or majority equity investments. As the proportion of equity 
investment increases, the costs, risk, and amount of required management atten￾tion also increase.31 In general, partners need to know how expenses, profits, risk, 
and knowledge will be shared.
Second, research increasingly points to “relational quality” as a key success fac￾tor of long-term alliances.32 Strategic alliances shift the nature of the relationship 
from the simple exchange of goods, services, or resources with no necessary 
expectation of a future relationship to one where there is a clear expectation of 
future exchange. The organizations in the relationship must act in good faith to 
ensure the future. This requires trust, “a psychological state comprising the inten￾tion to accept vulnerability based upon positive expectations of the intentions or 
behavior” of another firm or individual representing the organization. It implies 
an expectation that the organization will subordinate its self-interest to the “joint 
interest” of the alliance under most conditions.33
Trust can increase or decrease over the life of the alliance. Early in the alliance 
formation process, it can serve as an initial reservoir of comfort and confidence 
based on perceptions of the organizations’ reputation, prior success, and other 
sources. These same factors can also contribute to a lack of initial trust. Trust can be 
increased or decreased by new assessments of the others’ capabilities, competence, 
1.

3.CHAPTER 22 Transorganizational Change 571
and ethical behavior. OD practitioners can assist in this initial start-up phase by mak￾ing implicit perceptions of trust explicit and getting the involved parties to set appro￾priate expectations.34 During the structuring and start-up phase, trust can increase 
through direct activities as a function of the number, frequency, and importance of 
interactions; differences between expectations and reality; the nature of mistakes 
and how they are resolved; and attributions made about partners’ behavior.
Alliance Operation and Adjustment. Once the strategic alliance is functioning, the full 
range of OD interventions described in this text can be applied. Team building, conflict 
resolution, large-group interventions, work design, employee involvement, strategic 
planning, and culture change efforts have all been reported in alliance work.35 OD 
practitioners should pay particular attention to helping each partner in the alliance 
clarify the capabilities contributed, the lessons learned, and the benefits received.
Diagnosing the state of the strategic alliance and making the appropriate adjust￾ments is a function of understanding whether the environment has changed in 
ways that make transorganizational linkage unnecessary, whether partner goals 
and capabilities have changed the nature of the relationship and interdependence, 
and whether the alliance is successfully generating outcomes. The long-term suc￾cess of the Fuji-Xerox joint venture, for example, has been due to the willingness 
and ability of the two organizations to adjust the relationship in terms of ownership, 
profit sharing, new product development responsibilities, and market access.36
Application 22.2 describes an alliance-building intervention between two firms 
in India.37 It shows how, despite good intentions, OD projects can encoun ter vex￾ing problems, especially in cross-cultural alliance contexts.
NETWORK INTERVENTIONS
Network interventions help organizations join together for a common purpose; their 
use is growing rapidly in today’s highly competitive, global environment.38 In the 
private sector, research and development consortia, for example, allow companies to 
share resources and risks associated with large-scale research efforts. Networks among 
airlines with regional specializations can combine to provide worldwide coverage; 
Japanese keiretsu, Korean chaeobols, or Mexican grupos can enable different organiza￾tions to take advantage of complementary capabilities among them. In the public 
sector, partnerships between government and business provide the resources and ini￾tiative to undertake complex urban renewal projects, such as Baltimore’s Inner Harbor 
Project and Pittsburgh’s Neighborhood Housing Services. Networks of business, labor, 
government, education, finance, community organizations, and economic develop￾ment agencies, such as the New Baldwin Corridor Coalition, can help coordinate ser￾vices, promote economies, and avoid costly overlap and redundancy.39
Managing the development of multiorganization networks involves two types of 
change: (a) creating the initial network and (b) managing change within an established 
network. Both change processes are complex and not well understood. First, the initial 
creation of networks recognizes their underorganized nature. Forming them into a 
more coherent, operating whole involves understanding the relationships among the 
participating organizations and their roles in the system, as well as the implications 
and consequences of organizations leaving the network, changing roles, or increasing 
their influence. Second, change within existing networks must account for the rela￾tionships among member organizations as a whole system.40 The multiple and complex 
relationships involved in networks produce emergent phenomena that cannot be fully 
explained by simply knowing the parts. Each organization in the network has goals 
that are partly related to the good of the network and partly focused on self-interest. 
How the network reacts over time is even more difficult to capture and is part of the 
emerging science of complexity.41

Building Alliance Relationships
Maharashtra Hybrid Seeds Company Limited 
(MAHYCO), the leading producer and marketer 
of hybrid seeds in India, formed a strategic alli￾ance to expand and extend its business. Founded 
in 1964 by B. R. Barwale, the father of the green 
revolution in India, MAHYCO was family owned 
and run. Mr. Barwale’s son was the firm’s man￾aging director (MD) and several family members 
played critical roles in its daily management. In 
1998, the company opened a state-of-the-art 
research and development complex, the same 
year that B. R. Barwale received the World Food 
Prize for his work on hybrid seed development.
In the early 1990s, MAHYCO first made contact 
with Monsanto India Private Limited as a potential 
business partner with complementary capabilities. 
Monsanto India was part of the Monsanto Company, 
a publicly held multinational corporation based in 
the United States, and the leading global developer 
of transgenic plants using biotechnology. Monsanto’s 
focus on biotechnology, part of the firm’s larger 
transformation from chemicals to biotechnology, 
gave it the lead in introducing insect- and herbicide￾resistant genetic traits in plants. With a presence in 
India since 1947, Monsanto India had a sales and 
marketing organization with a research facility and 
formulation plant.
During the next few years, the two companies 
explored a strategic alliance primarily through 
personal relationships among MAHYCO’s MD 
and two key executives from Monsanto India, an 
Indian operations manager and an expatriate from 
the United States. The MD had strong interest 
in progressive business practices; the operations 
manager, keen business savvy and local knowl￾edge; and the expatriate, tremendous technical 
knowledge and cultural sensitivity. These qualities 
helped the three executives forge a strong per￾sonal bond based on respect, friendship, and trust. 
Consequently in 1998, Monsanto made an equity 
investment in MAHYCO. The two companies 
believed that their complementary resources and 
capabilities could be leveraged to develop com￾petitive advantage for the alliance. For example, 
MAHYCO could apply Monsanto’s biotechnologi￾cal know-how to its vast germ plasma inventory 
to create plants that would support the food 
production and fiber needs of South Asia. Even 
with Monsanto’s long-term presence in India, 
MAHYCO could provide it with better access to 
India’s markets, government officials, and regula￾tory agencies.
In moving the alliance forward, however, both firms 
recognized that their different corporate cultures 
posed a special challenge. MAHYCO’s culture was 
characterized by high levels of loyalty and com￾mitment, owing to its family background and close 
connection to the noble effort of bringing biotech￾nology to India. The firm’s management–employee 
relationship was highly formal, with little employee 
involvement in decisions and low comfort with 
change. Monsanto, on the other hand, was nearly 
opposite on all of these dimensions. It was a large 
fast-paced organization undergoing considerable 
change. Its people were in constant flux as its busi￾ness models and plans were changing. Many were 
new to the organization and just learning their 
positions, while the experienced people were lead￾ing the company’s conversion from chemicals to 
biotechnology.
Given these organizational differences and the 
fact that neither partner could know in advance 
how long the alliance would last, MAHYCO 
employees were fearful that Monsanto would buy 
out or consume MAHYCO and thereby threaten 
their careers. Adding to the ambiguity and stress, 
MAHYCO’s MD openly expressed hope that the 
alliance would help the firm become more profes￾sionally managed and malleable, and less patriar￾chal and rigid.
Building on the strong personal bond between the 
three executives at the top of the two firms, an 
alliance-building intervention was considered to 
develop trust and collaboration at lower organiza￾tional levels. In preparing for the change program, 
an OD team interviewed 44 people from Monsanto 
India and MAHYCO. Numerous opportunities 
and obstacles to alliance success were identified. 
Members of both organizations wanted to learn 
more about their partner’s business and culture. 
They expressed excitement about combining their 
resources in the alliance and cited the importance 
of collaboration and mutual understanding to 
make it work. Four critical success factors emerged 
from the interviews: clear vision and mission for 
the alliance, key initiatives and goals, mutual trust CHAPTER 22 Transorganizational Change 573
and operating norms, and support for each firm’s 
internal change plans.
The OD team then met with the top leaders at 
MAHYCO and Monsanto India and proposed an 
appreciative inquiry (AI) process for the alliance￾building program. It would involve multiple orga￾nizational levels and include all relevant alliance 
stakeholders. AI would help participants create 
common ground, discover each other’s capabilities, 
and envision the alliance’s future. The proposed 
intervention was approved by Monsanto India 
but surprisingly rejected by MAHYCO, which was 
uncomfortable with the AI process. Specifically, 
MAHYCO’s leaders believed they did not know 
enough about Monsanto India to engage in an open, 
loosely structured process for developing relation￾ships and setting alliance direction and strategy. 
Moreover, they felt that AI would give too much 
decision-making power to middle managers, take 
too much time, and be seen as too childish for grown 
men with many years of experience. As a compro￾mise, MAHYCO agreed that its R&D people would 
engage in AI with their Monsanto India counter￾parts, but the MAHYCO executive team would only 
participate in a more formal management education 
(ME) session to learn more about the alliance and 
their partner. Thus, two different alliance-building 
interventions were conducted in late 1998.
The AI session was attended by 32 participants 
representing four cross-alliance R&D teams. One of 
those teams—the Cotton team—had already been 
formed and was actively working on a joint proj￾ect. An opening exercise encouraged participants 
to build relationships that go beyond name tags. 
It was followed by an information session where 
participants learned about the alliance partners and 
the purpose for the alliance. They gained insight 
about each firm’s core strengths and the synergies 
that could be derived from the alliance. In fact, 
this exercise had such a strong impact that the 
design of the subsequent ME session was modi￾fied to include it. The AI session then moved from 
learning to envisioning. Participants were asked to 
imagine how the alliance would be publicly recog￾nized by the year 2005. They imagined an alliance 
that would increase the nutrient content of pulse 
crops, create nitrogen-fixating plants, develop new 
insect-resistant crops, and spawn a “gene revolu￾tion” (a playful allusion to the Green Revolution). 
Moreover, the alliance would create plants that 
produce hydrocarbons and new color fibers and 
ensure the Asian food supply. Many participants 
experienced the envisioning process as energizing; 
others, mostly from the Cotton team, however, 
were skeptical and viewed it as “waste of our time.” 
Despite this criticism, the subsequent dialogue 
revealed productive ways to address the alliance 
vision and to create action plans. For example, 
one R&D team that had not met prior to the ses￾sion developed several recommendations on how 
to improve information sharing between the two 
companies.
The ME session was conducted in a more tradi￾tional presentation format than the AI session 
and included MAHYCO’s top-30 managers and 
Monsanto India’s top 10. It was geared to provid￾ing participants with better understanding of the 
alliance partners—their history, current business, 
future opportunities, and expectations for the alli￾ance. After formal introductions, the ME session 
involved presentations on alliance management 
and Monsanto’s biotechnology strategy. The latter 
was mainly for the benefit of MAHYCO’s execu￾tives. Then, participants learned about each firm’s 
core competencies and how they translated into 
alliance benefits. Interestingly, this part of the ses￾sion evolved into a somewhat awkward discussion 
about “professionalism” in the MAHYCO organiza￾tion. The ensuing dialogue about changing from a 
family business to a more professional firm raised 
issues of trust, loyalty, respect, and so on, all top￾ics difficult to address in this formal setting. With 
facilitation from the OD team, the ME session 
shifted to question-and-answer discussions geared 
to increase cross-firm communication and under￾standing. The ME session ended with discussion 
of the top executives’ role in making the alliance 
successful. Participants generated ideas for the next 
steps in developing the alliance and positioning 
it and biotechnology in India. They assumed no 
further responsibility, however, for implementing 
them, leaving it up to the Director of Monsanto 
India and the MAHYCO MD to determine the next 
steps and to make them happen.
In sum, the AI and ME alliance-building inter￾ventions differed considerably in their respective 
purposes, participants, processes, and outcomes. 
The AI session encouraged learning, relationship 
building, and co-creation of future alliance plans, 
whereas the ME session was intended to convey 
information about the alliance and its partner 
organizations. To assess intervention results, the 574 PART 6 Strategic Change Interventions
OD team administered questionnaires to all par￾ticipants at the beginning and end of both sessions. 
In addition, a follow-up survey was administered 
to all participants via email four months later 
to explore any longitudinal effects of the inter￾ventions. Seventy-two percent of AI participants 
returned the email survey, while only half of the 
ME participants did. Participants in the AI session 
reported significantly greater levels of relation￾ship building, collaboration, and follow-through 
in alliance project development than did the ME 
session participants. ME participants indicated that 
they missed the opportunity to build relationships. 
Participants in both sessions reported increased 
levels of mutual understanding, thereby laying the 
foundation for future alliance development.
Over the next six years, many of the same issues 
that showed up in the alliance-building sessions 
still persisted, to the dismay of the OD team. These 
included concerns over trust and collaboration, 
unwillingness to change, and inequalities in com￾pensation and available equipment between the 
two partners. People who were roadblocks in 1998 
were still roadblocks in 2003. Aspects of corporate 
control and decision making were still frustrat￾ing the alliance, making it difficult to chart its 
own future and success. The inherent differences 
between the two partner organizations continued 
to challenge alliance leadership.
On reflection, members of the OD team learned 
from their alliance experience. They realized 
that their original views about the AI and ME 
interventions were overly optimistic, even naive. 
What they observed during the AI session was 
only surface-level dialogue, the result of a design 
that minimized tension and fostered collaboration. 
They concluded that alliance partners as well as 
OD professionals need to enhance their business 
and cultural knowledge prior to participating in a 
cross-cultural alliance intervention. From a busi￾ness perspective, for example, it would be helpful 
for participants to diagnose their own organiza￾tion prior to the alliance-building activities. This 
would provide valuable insight into the firm’s 
collaborative orientation and alliance capability, 
providing a realistic basis for determining how best 
to create and develop the alliance. From a cultural 
perspective, it would be helpful to appreciate the 
diverse ways in which people from different cul￾tures are likely to react to alliance interventions 
such as AI and ME. In intergroup encounters, for 
example, people from more implicit cultures (such 
as India) tend to share only a shade of what they 
believe and feel. In contrast, people from more 
explicit cultures (such as the United States) tend 
to be more open and forward in such interactions. 
Such understanding would be invaluable in design￾ing how best to build alliance relationships. Finally, 
the OD team concluded that alliance building is not 
a one-time event but an ongoing process. It needs 
continuous organizational support and attention to 
the structures and processes that sustain optimal 
levels of collaboration and trust among alliance 
partners.
Creating the Network
OD practitioners have evolved a unique form of planned change aimed at creating 
networks and improving their effectiveness.42 In laying out the conceptual boundar￾ies of network development, also known as transorganization development, Cummings 
described the practice as following the phases of planned change appropriate for 
underorganized systems (see Chapter 2).43 The four stages are shown in Figure 22.1 
along with key issues that need to be addressed at each stage. The stages and issues 
are described below.
Identification Stage. This initial stage of network development involves identifying 
existing and potential member organizations best suited to achieving their collective 
objectives. Identifying potential members can be difficult because organizations may 
not perceive the need to join together or may not know enough about each other 
1.CHAPTER 22 Transorganizational Change 575
to make membership choices. These problems are typical when trying to create a 
new network. Relationships among potential members may be loosely coupled or 
nonexistent; thus, even if organizations see the need to form a network, they may 
be unsure about who should be included.
The identification stage is generally carried out by one or a few organizations 
interested in exploring the possibility of creating a network. OD practitioners work 
with these initiating organizations to clarify their own goals, such as product or 
technology exchange, learning, or market access, and to understand the trade-off 
between the loss of autonomy and the value of collaboration. Change agents also 
help specify criteria for network membership and identify organizations meet￾ing those standards. Because networks are intended to perform specific tasks, a 
practical criterion for membership is how much organizations can contribute to 
task performance. Potential members can be identified and judged in terms of 
the skills, knowledge, and resources that they bring to bear on the network task. 
Practitioners warn, however, that identifying potential members also should take 
into account the political realities of the situation.44 Consequently, key stakehold￾ers who can affect the creation and subsequent performance of the network are 
identified as possible members.
An important difficulty at this stage can be insufficient leadership and cohesion 
among participants to choose potential members. In these situations, OD practi￾tioners may need to play a more activist role in creating the network.45 They may 
need to bring structure to a group of autonomous organizations that do not see the 
need to join together or may not know how to form relationships. In several cases 
of network development, change agents helped members create a special leader￾ship group that could make decisions on behalf of the participating organizations.46
This leadership group comprised a small cadre of committed members and was able 
to develop enough cohesion among members to carry out the identification stage. 
The OD activist role requires a good deal of leadership and direction. For example, 
change agents may need to educate potential network members about the benefits 
of joining together. They may need to structure face-to-face encounters aimed at 
sharing information and exploring interaction possibilities.
Convention Stage. Once potential network members are identified, the convention 
stage is concerned with bringing them together to assess whether formalizing the 
network is desirable and feasible. This face-to-face meeting enables potential mem￾bers to explore mutually their motivations for joining and their perceptions of the

joint task. They work to establish sufficient levels of motivation and task consensus 
to form the network.
Like the identification stage, this phase of network creation generally requires 
considerable direction and facilitation by OD practitioners. Existing stakehold￾ers may not have the legitimacy or skills to perform the convening function, and 
practitioners can serve as conveners if they are perceived as legitimate and cred￾ible by the attending organizations. This necessitates that change agents maintain 
a neutral role, treating all members alike.47 They need to be seen by members as 
working on behalf of the total system, rather than as being aligned with particu￾lar organizations or views. When practitioners are perceived as neutral, network 
members are more likely to share information with them and to listen to their 
inputs. Such neutrality can enhance change agents’ ability to mediate conflicts 
among members. It can help them uncover diverse views and interests and forge 
agreements among stakeholders. OD practitioners, for example, can act as media￾tors, ensuring that members’ views receive a fair hearing and that disputes are 
equitably resolved. They can help to bridge the different views and interests and 
achieve integrative solutions. In many cases, practitioners come from research 
centers or universities with reputations for neutrality and expertise in networks.48
Because participating organizations tend to have diverse motives and views and 
limited means for resolving differences, change agents may need to structure and 
manage interactions to facilitate airing of differences and arriving at consensus 
about forming the network. They may need to help organizations work through 
differences and reconcile self-interests with those of the larger network.
Organization Stage. When the convention stage results in a decision to create a 
network, members then begin to organize themselves for task performance. This 
involves developing the structures and mechanisms that promote communication 
and interaction among members and that direct joint efforts to the task at hand.49
It includes the organizations to be involved in the network and the roles each 
will play; the communication and relationships among them; and the control 
system that will guide decision making and provide a mechanism for monitoring 
performance. For example, members may create a coordinating council to man￾age the network and a powerful leader to head it. They might choose to formalize 
exchanges among members by developing rules, policies, and formal operating 
procedures. When members are required to invest large amounts of resources 
in the network, such as might occur in an industry-based research consortium, 
the organizing stage typically includes voluminous contracting and negotiating 
about members’ contributions and returns. Here, corporate lawyers and financial 
analysts play key roles in specifying the network structure. They determine how 
costs and benefits will be allocated among member organizations as well as the 
legal obligations, decision-making responsibilities, and contractual rights of mem￾bers. OD practitioners can help members define competitive advantage for the 
network as well as the structural requirements necessary to support achievement 
of its goals.
Evaluation Stage. This final stage of creating a network involves assessing how 
the network is performing. Members need feedback so they can identify problems 
and begin to resolve them. This generally includes information about performance 
outcomes and member satisfactions, as well as indicators of how well members are 
interacting jointly. Change agents can periodically interview or survey member 
organizations about various outcomes and features of the network and feed that 
data back to network leaders. Such information enables network leaders to make 
necessary operational modifications and adjustments. It may signal the need to 
return to previous stages in the process to make necessary corrections, as shown 
by the feedback arrows in Figure 22.1.

4.CHAPTER 22 Transorganizational Change 577
Managing Network Change
In addition to developing new networks, OD practitioners may need to facilitate 
change within established networks. Planned change in existing networks derives 
from an understanding of the “new sciences,” including complexity, nonlinear systems, 
catastrophe, and chaos theories. From these perspectives, organization networks are 
viewed as complex systems displaying the following properties:50
The behavior of a network is sensitive to small differences in its initial conditions. 
How the network was established and formed—the depth and nature of trust among 
the partners, who was selected (and not selected) to be in the network, and how the 
network was organized—play a key role in its willingness and ability to change.
Networks display “emergent” properties or characteristics that cannot be explained 
through an analysis of the parts: “Given the properties of the parts and the laws of 
their interaction, it is not a trivial matter to infer the properties of the whole.”51 The 
tools of systems thinking and the understanding of emergence in complex systems 
are still being developed and applied.52
A variety of network behaviors and patterns, both expected and unexpected, can 
emerge from members performing tasks and making decisions according to simple 
rules to which everyone agreed. This is amply demonstrated in Senge’s “beer game” 
simulation where a retailer, a wholesaler, and a brewery each acts according to the 
simple rule of maximizing its own profit. Participants in the simulation routinely 
end up with enormous inventories of poor- selling beer, delayed deliveries, excess 
capacity, and other problems. Without an understanding of the “whole” system, the 
nature of interdependencies within the system, and timely and complete informa￾tion, each part, acting in its own self-interest, destroys itself.53 Apparently random 
changes in networks may simply be chaotic patterns that are not understood. These 
patterns cannot be known in advance but represent potential paths of change that 
are the result of the complex interactions among members in the network.
The process of change in complex systems such as networks involves creating instabil￾ity, managing the tipping point, and relying on self-organization. These phases roughly 
follow Lewin’s model of planned change described in Chapter 2. Change in a network 
requires an unfreezing process where the system becomes unstable. Movement in the 
system is described by the metaphor of a “tipping point” where changes occur rapidly 
as a result of information processing. Finally, refreezing involves self-organization. The 
descriptions below represent rudimentary applications of these concepts to networks; 
research and practice in changing networks are still in a formative stage.
Create Instability in the Network. Before change in a network can occur, 
relationships among member organizations must become unstable. A network’s 
susceptibility to instability is a function of members’ motivations for structure 
versus agency.54 Structure refers to the organization’s expected role in the network 
and represents a source of stability. All things being equal, network members tend 
to behave and perform according to their agreed-upon roles. For example, most 
routine communications among the network members are geared toward increas￾ing stability and working together. A manufacturing plant in Nike’s network is 
expected to produce a certain number of shoes at a certain cost with certain fea￾tures. Nike headquarters in Beaverton, Oregon, plans on the plant behaving this 
way. On the other hand, agency involves self-interest which can create instability 
in the network. Each member of the network is trying to maximize its own per￾formance in the context of the network. Changes in member goals and strategies, 
the ratio of costs and benefits in network membership, and so on, can affect the 
willingness and ability of members to contribute to network performance. When

a plant in Nike’s network grows to a sufficient size, it may decide to alter its role 
in the network. As the ratio of agency to structure increases, the instability of the 
network rises, thus enabling change to occur.
OD practitioners can facilitate instability in a network by changing the pattern 
of communication among members. They can, for example, encourage organiza￾tions to share information. Technology breakthroughs, new product introductions, 
changes in network membership, or changes in the strategy of a network member 
all represent fluctuations that can increase the susceptibility of the network to 
change. Another important aspect of changing the pattern of information is to 
ask who should get the information. Understanding and creating instability is dif￾ficult because the nature of members’ connectedness also influences the system’s 
susceptibility. Some organizations are more connected than others; most organiza￾tions are closely connected to several others, but relatively unconnected to many. 
This makes creating a sense of urgency for change difficult. Diagnosis of the rela￾tionships among member organizations can provide important information about 
organizations that are central to network communications.55
Manage the Tipping Point. Although instability provides the impetus and 
opportunity for change, the direction, type, and process of change are yet to be 
determined. An unstable network can move to a new state of organization and 
performance, return to its old condition, or simply cease to exist. At this point, 
network members, individually and collectively, make choices about what to do. 
OD practitioners can help them through this change period. Recent studies sug￾gest the following guides for facilitating network change:56
a. The Law of the Few. A new idea, practice, or other change spreads because of a 
relatively few but important roles in the network. Connectors, mavens, and 
salespeople help an innovation achieve sufficient awareness and credibility 
throughout the network to be considered viable. Connectors are individuals who 
occupy central positions in the network and are able to tap into many different 
network audiences. They have “Rolodex” power; they are quickly able to alert 
and connect with a wide variety of people in many organizations. Mavens are 
“information sinks.” They passionately pursue knowledge about a particular 
subject and are altruistically willing to tell anyone who is interested everything 
they know about it. The key to the maven’s role is trust. People who speak to 
mavens know that they are getting unbiased information, that there is no “hid￾den agenda,” just good data. Finally, salespeople are the champions of change 
and are able to influence others to try new ideas, do new things, or consider 
new options. Thus, the first key factor in changing a network is the presence of 
communication channels occupied by connectors, mavens, and salespeople.
OD practitioners can fill any of these roles. They can, if appropriate, be 
mavens on a particular subject and act as a source of unbiased information about 
a new network practice, aspects of interpersonal relationships that network 
members agree is slowing network response, or ideas about information systems 
that can speed communication. Less frequently, OD practitioners can be connec￾tors, ensuring that any given message is seeded throughout the network. This is 
especially true if the change agent was part of the network’s formation. In this 
case, the practitioner might have extensive relationships with organizations in 
the network. Thus, networking skills, such as the ability to manage lateral rela￾tions among autonomous organizations in the relative absence of hierarchical 
control, are indispensable to practitioners of network change. Change agents 
must be able to span the boundaries of diverse organizations, link them together, 
and facilitate exchanges among them.57 OD practitioners can also play the role 
of salesperson. Although it is in line with the “activist” role described earlier in 
the practice of network creation, it is not a traditional aspect of OD practice. 
2.CHAPTER 22 Transorganizational Change 579
The wisdom of having a change agent as the champion of an idea rather than a 
key player in the organization network is debatable. The change agent and net￾work members must understand the trade-offs in sacrificing the OD practitioner’s 
neutrality for influence. If that trade-off is made, the change agent will need the 
political competence to understand and resolve the conflicts of interest and value 
dilemmas inherent in systems made up of multiple organizations, each seeking 
to maintain autonomy while jointly interacting. Political savvy can help change 
agents manage their own roles and values in respect to those power dynamics.
b. Stickiness. The second ingredient in network change is stickiness. For a new idea 
or practice to take hold, the message communicated by the connectors, mavens, 
and salespeople must be memorable. A memorable or sticky message is not a 
function of typical communication variables, such as frequency of the mes￾sage, loudness, or saliency. Stickiness is often a function of small and seemingly 
insignificant characteristics of the message, such as its structure, format, and 
syntax, as well as its emotional content, practicality, or sequencing with other 
messages. OD practitioners can help network members develop sticky messages 
for communicating about network change. Brainstorming alternative phrases, 
using metaphors to symbolize meaning, or enlisting the help of marketing and 
communications specialists can increase the chance of developing a sticky mes￾sage. Since the ingredients of stickiness are often not obvious, several iterations 
of a message’s structure may be necessary to create memorable communication 
about network change.
c. The Power of Context. Finally, a message must be meaningful and relevant to 
network members. Meaning derives from the context of the network. When 
network members are feeling pressure to innovate or move quickly in response 
to external demands, for example, messages about new cost-cutting initiatives 
or a new financial reporting system may be uninteresting and easily neglected. 
On the other hand, a message linking these changes to expected improvements 
in network performance may be seen as relevant. OD practitioners can help 
members understand the network’s current climate or “conversation”; they can 
help members determine the appropriate timing and relevance of proposed com￾munications about network change.58
When the right people communicate a network change, present and package 
it appropriately, and distribute it in a timely fashion, implementation is likely to 
move forward swiftly. When there is insufficient information, interest, or rel￾evance, network change is likely to stall.
Rely on Self-Organization. Networks tend to exhibit “self-organizing” behavior. 
Network members seek to reduce uncertainty in their environment, while the 
network as a whole drives to establish more order in how it functions. OD prac￾titioners can rely on this self-organizing feature to refreeze change. Once change 
has occurred in the network, a variety of controls can be leveraged to institu￾tionalize it. For example, communication systems can spread stories about how 
the change is affecting different members, diffusing throughout the network, or 
contributing to network effectiveness. This increases the forces for stability in the 
network. Individual organizations can communicate their commitment to the 
change in an effort to lower agency forces that can contribute to instability. Each 
of these messages signifies constraint and shows that the different parts of the 
network are not independent of each other.
Application 22.3 describes the behaviors of organizations within the Toyota network 
in response to a crisis. The application demonstrates the fragility of collaborative net￾works, their robust and responsive capabilities, and the importance of the law of the 
few, stickiness, and context.59
3.Fragile and Robust—Network Change 
in Toyota Motor Corporation
The Toyota Motor Corporation is one of the best 
car companies in the world. It is efficient, flex￾ible, and routinely produces many of the world’s 
best-engineered cars with the lowest costs in the 
industry. However, Toyota is not one company but 
a Japanese keiretsu, a group of about 200 compa￾nies united in supplying Toyota with everything 
from dashboards to headlights. The network is 
integrated by the Toyota Production System (TPS), 
a collection of total quality management, just-in￾time inventory systems, and concurrent engineer￾ing processes that have been adopted by most 
Japanese and American firms. But Toyota’s system 
is different because of the close-knit family culture 
that supports TPS and explains why costs are kept 
so low to insure global competitiveness. Members 
of the keiretsu routinely exchange personnel, share 
intellectual property, and assist each other at the 
cost of their own time and resources, all without 
the requirement of formal contracts or detailed 
record keeping.
One of the keiretsu members, Aisin Seiki, produces 
P-valves, a part that helps to prevent skidding 
by controlling pressure on the rear brakes. The 
fist-size P-valves are not complicated, but require 
precision manufacturing in specialized facilities 
using custom-designed drills and gauges because 
their role is so critical to safety. By 1997, Aisin was 
producing all but 1% of the P-valves for Toyota’s 
20 plants because of its efficiency, costs, and qual￾ity. Aisin’s only P-valve manufacturing factory, 
the Kariya plant, produced 32,500 valves a day, 
and because of the success of their just-in-time 
system, Toyota held between four hours’ and two 
days’ worth of P-values in stock. Production at the 
Kariya plant was, therefore, a critical element of 
Toyota’s supply chain. As Duncan Watts succinctly 
stated, “No factory, no P-valves. No P-valves, no 
brakes. No brakes, no cars.” Toyota’s general man￾ager of production control conceded that depend￾ing on a single source and holding essentially no 
inventory was a calculated risk, but it also kept 
Toyota’s production lean.
On Saturday, February 1, 1997, the Kariya plant 
burned down. By 9:00 A.M., the fire had destroyed 
most of the factory’s 506 highly specialized 
machines and all the production lines for P-valves. 
Toyota estimated that more than two weeks would 
be needed just to restore a few milling machines 
to partial production, and six months to order new 
machines.
At the time, Toyota’s auto plants were operating at 
full capacity to meet strong domestic demand and 
serve the U.S. market. About 30 production lines 
were producing more than 15,000 cars a day. By 
Wednesday, February 5, all production had ceased. 
Across the entire Kobe industrial zone, Toyota’s 
own plants, and the facilities and workers supply￾ing them, were closed. Economists estimated that 
Toyota’s shutdown would damage Japan’s annual 
industrial output by 0.1 percentage point each day. 
The brittleness of the system to such a relatively 
small failure points to the fragility of networks and 
networked organizations.
But the rapidity with which the system responded 
and recovered also points to the robustness and 
adaptability of networks. Although many experts 
thought Toyota couldn’t recover for weeks or 
months, its car factories started up again within 
five days after the fire, and by the following 
Thursday, 36 different suppliers, aided by more 
than 150 other subcontractors, had nearly 50 
separate lines producing small batches of P-valves. 
As soon as Thursday, February 6, two of Toyota’s 
plants had reopened, and by the following Monday, 
little more than a week after the crisis had begun, 
production of almost 14,000 cars a day had been 
restored. A week after that, the daily volume was 
right back at its pre-disaster level.
The speed of the recovery is especially amazing 
given that none of individual firms in the Toyota 
group that helped Aisin had had the capability to 
do so. Very few firms that became emergency pro￾ducers of P-valves, or the firms involved indirectly 
as suppliers, had any prior experience making the 
valves, nor did they have access to the kind of spe￾cialized tools that had been destroyed in the fire. 
The interesting question, therefore, is not why did 
they stage so dramatic a recovery, but how?
Aisin and Toyota managers realized immediately 
that the recovery task was beyond their capabilities 
application 22.3CHAPTER 22 Transorganizational Change 581
as an individual firm and beyond the capabilities 
of their immediate suppliers. A much broader 
effort would be required, and one over which they 
would have little direct control. Before the fire was 
out, Aisin officials organized a committee to assess 
the damage, notify customers and labor unions 
and, following Japanese custom, visit neighbors 
to apologize. Over 300 cellular phones, 230 extra 
phone lines, and several dozen sleeping bags were 
ordered.
At 8:00 A.M., Aisin asked Toyota to help. Kosuke 
Ikebuchi, a Toyota senior managing director, set 
up a “war room” at Toyota headquarters to direct 
the damage-control operation. Toyota also sent 
more than 400 engineers to Aisin. Later that 
morning, having set up an emergency response 
headquarters, Aisin sent out a distress call to 
other keiretsu members, defining the problem 
broadly and asking for help. Within hours, they 
had begun making blueprints for the valve, 
improvising tooling systems, and setting up make￾shift production lines.
On Saturday afternoon, Toyota and Aisin invited 
some of their major parts suppliers to a second war 
room, at Aisin headquarters. It quickly became a 
hectic scene, with officials shouting out for cop￾ies of the blueprints of different P-valves while 
Toyota executives divvied up valve-making assign￾ments. Despite the face-to-face meeting of several 
companies, being helpful wasn’t easy. The firms 
involved in the recovery effort lacked the tools and 
expertise specific to P-valve production. As a result, 
they were forced to invent novel manufacturing 
procedures in real time, and to solve both design 
and production problems simultaneously. To make 
matters worse, Aisin’s expertise rested largely with 
its own processes; it was often of little help in 
overcoming technical obstacles. And finally, Aisin 
became extremely difficult to contact. Even after 
installing hundreds of additional phone lines, so 
much information was flowing in and out in the 
form of queries, suggestions, solutions, and new 
problems, that the company was often unreach￾able, leaving the makeshift supply chain largely 
on its own.
Unfortunately, the capacity of this initial group 
of suppliers was insufficient. So Toyota purchas￾ing officials called more parts makers to a Sunday 
afternoon meeting. These officials, like those who 
had met on Saturday, were also part of the Toyota 
family. “It was crucial because we knew each other, 
we knew the face of the people,” Mr. Ikebuchi says. 
For example, Masakazu Ishikawa, a former Toyota 
manager whose division had designed Toyota 
P-valves, was now Executive Vice President of 
Somic Ishikawa Inc., a supplier of brake parts and 
suspension ball joints. Mr. Ishikawa called Somic’s 
top production engineers and asked them to meet 
at the office at 8:00 P.M. Sunday. They stayed there 
until after midnight plotting to hire out some of 
their current factory work to free up machines to 
make the Toyota parts.
At 6:00 A.M. Monday, Somic’s four designers began 
an eight-stage design process. Staying up 40 hours, 
the engineers designed jigs, and then they called in 
some favors from Somic’s chain of suppliers. For 
example, Somic got a machine-tool maker, Meiko 
Machinery Co., to turn down other orders and put 
30 workers on round-the-clock shifts to make the 
jigs it needed. Somic drafted technical and admin￾istrative staffers to help man the machines. On 
February 6, right on schedule, it delivered its first 
P-valves to Toyota.
The above example provides an important glimpse 
into the many different problem-solving and net￾work-related activities that were taking place. 
Other examples included the Taiho Kogyo Co., a 
bearing maker that searched nationwide for special 
machine tools and still delivered 500 P-valves on 
Thursday, and Brother, a sewing and fax machine 
maker that had never made car parts, which spent 
about 500 man-hours refitting a milling machine 
to make just 40 valves a day.
Early in the week after the fire, even Toyota’s 
Mr. Ikebuchi had doubts about the goal of resum￾ing production in all plants by Friday. But the sup￾plier group came through. Trucks bearing the first 
1,000 usable P-valves rolled in late Wednesday. 
On Thursday, 3,000 more arrived, and on Friday, 
5,000. Slowly, Toyota’s assembly lines started up 
again.
The recovery story demonstrates how all the years 
of experience with the TPS paid off. All the compa￾nies involved possessed a common understanding 
of how problems should be approached and solved. 
To them, simultaneous design and engineering was 
an everyday activity, and because Aisin knew this, 
they were able to specify their requirements to a 
minimum level of detail, allowing potential suppli￾ers the greatest possible latitude in deciding how to 582 PART 6 Strategic Change Interventions
proceed. Even more important, while the particu￾lar situation was unfamiliar, the idea of cooperating 
was not. Because many of the firms involved in the 
recovery effort had previously exchanged person￾nel and technical information with Aisin, and also 
with each other, they could make use of lines of 
communication, information resources, and social 
ties that were already established. They under￾stood and trusted each other, an arrangement 
that facilitated not only the rapid dissemination of 
information (including seven descriptions of their 
mistakes) but also the mobilization and commit￾ment of resources.
In effect then, the companies of the Toyota 
group managed to pull off two recovery efforts 
simultaneously. First, they redistributed the stress 
of a major failure from one firm to hundreds of 
firms, thus minimizing the damage to any one 
member of the group. And second, they recom￾bined the resources of those same firms in multiple 
distinct and original configurations to produce an 
equivalent output of P-valves. They did all this 
without generating any additional breakdowns, 
with very little central direction, and almost com￾pletely in the absence of formal contracts. And they 
did it in just three days.
SUMMARY
In this chapter, we describe transorganizational change interventions that move beyond 
the single organization to include merging, allying, or networking with other organiza￾tions. These change programs enable organizations to extend their boundaries to keep 
pace with highly complex and rapidly changing environments. They help organizations 
create and sustain multiorganization linkages. Because transorganizational interventions 
transcend a single organization, attention is directed at the strategies, objectives, struc￾tures, and processes of two or more interdependent organizations. This raises the scope 
and complexity of change and requires OD practitioners to develop new concepts, skills, 
and expertise.
Mergers and acquisitions interventions involve combining two or more organi￾zations to achieve strategic and financial objectives. They generally involves three 
phases: precombination, legal combination, and operational combination. The M&A 
process has been dominated by financial and technical concerns, but experience and 
research strongly support the contribution that OD practitioners can make to M&A 
success.
Strategic alliance interventions help organizations create partnerships with other 
organizations to share resources and capabilities for competitive advantage. They include 
licensing agreements, franchises, long-term contracts, and joint ventures. The develop￾ment of strategic alliances generally follows a process of strategy formulation, partner 
selection, alliance structuring and start-up, and alliance operation and adjustment.
Network interventions must address two types of change. First, because 
multiorganization systems tend to be underorganized, the initial development of the 
network follows the stages of planned change relevant to underorganized systems: 
identification, convention, organization, and evaluation. Second, the management of 
change within a network also must acknowledge the distributed nature of influence 
and adopt methods of change that rely on the law of the few, the power of context, 
and the stickiness factor.CHAPTER 22 Transorganizational Change 583

study of 115 multibillion-dollar, global mergers 
between 1993 and 1996 where 58% failed to create 
“substantial returns for shareholders,” measured by 
tangible returns in the form of dividends and stock 
price appreciation; a Mercer Management Consulting 
study of all mergers from 1990 to 1996 where nearly 
half “destroyed” shareholder value; a Price￾WaterhouseCoopers study of 97 acquirers that com￾pleted deals worth $500 million or more from 1994 
to 1997 and where two-thirds of the buyer’s stocks 
dropped on announcement of the transaction and “a 
year later” a third of the losers still were lagging the 
levels of peer-company shares or the stock market in 
general; and a European study of 300 companies 
that found that planning for restructuring was poorly 
thought out and underfunded. Similarly, despite the 
large amount of writing on the subject, a large pro￾portion of firms involved in mergers have not gotten 
the message that postmerger integration is the key to 
success. For example, in the A. T. Kearny study, only 
39% of the cases had set up a management team in 
the first hundred days and only 28% had a clear 
vision of corporate goals when the acquisition 
began.

Organization Development 
in Global Settings
This chapter describes the practice of organiza￾tion development in international settings. It 
presents the contingencies and practice issues 
associated with OD in organizations outside the 
United States, in worldwide organizations, and 
in global social change organizations. The appli￾cability and effectiveness of OD in countries and 
cultures outside of the United States are the 
subject of intense debate, however. Because OD 
was developed predominantly by American and 
Western European practitioners, its practices 
and methods are heavily influenced by the val￾ues and assumptions of industrialized cultures. 
Thus, the traditional approaches to planned 
change may promote management practices 
that conflict with the values and assumptions 
of other societies. Will Chinese cultural values, 
for example, be preserved or defended as an 
increasing number of European and American 
organizations establish operations in that coun￾try? How should OD be conducted in an Indian 
firm operating in the United States? On the 
other hand, some practitioners believe that OD 
can result in organizational improvements in any 
culture.1
 Despite different points of view on this 
topic, the practice of OD in international set￾tings can be expected to expand dramatically. 
The rapid development of foreign economies 
and firms, along with the evolution of the global 
marketplace, is creating organizational needs 
and opportunities for change.
In designing and implementing planned 
change for organizations operating outside the 
United States, OD practice must account for 
two important contingencies: alignment 
between the cultural values of the host country 
and traditional OD values, and the host coun￾try’s level of economic development. Preliminary 
research suggests that failure to adapt OD 
interventions to these cultural and economic 
contingencies can produce disastrous results.2
For example, seve ral OD concepts, including 
dialogue, truthfulness, and performance man￾agement, do not always work in all countries.3
Dialogue assumes that “all differences can be 
bridged if you get people together in the right 
context.” However, mediation, arbitration, or 
traditional negotiations are more acceptable in 
some cultures. Similarly, truth fulness, a very 
North American notion, is culturally relativistic 
and as a value depends on whether you are 
American, Asian, Middle Eastern, or from some 
other culture. Finally, the process and content 
of performance evaluation can also depend on 
culture.4
In worldwide organizations, managers can use 
OD to help firms operate in multiple countries. 
Referred to as international, global, multinational, 
or transnational corporations, these firms must 
fit their organizational strategies, structures, 
and processes to different cultures. OD can 
help members gain the organizational skills and 
knowledge needed to operate across cultural 
boundaries, enhancing organizational effective￾ness through better alignment of people and 
systems with international strategy.
Finally, OD is playing an increasingly impor￾tant role in global social change. Practitioners 
using highly participative approaches are influ￾encing the development of evolving countries, 
providing a voice to underrepresented social 
classes, and bridging the gap between cultures 
facing similar social issues. The application of 
planned change processes in these settings 
represents one of the newest and most excit￾ing areas of OD.CHAPTER 23 Organization Development in Global Settings 615
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT OUTSIDE 
THE UNITED STATES
Organization development is being practiced increasingly in organizations outside of 
the United States.5
 Survey feedback interventions have been used at Air New Zealand 
and at the Air Emirates (United Arab Republic); work design interventions have been 
implemented in Gamesa (Mexico); large-group interventions have been used in Vitro 
(Mexico); structural interventions have been completed at Neusoft Corporation (China); 
and merger and acquisition integration interventions have been used at Akzo-Nobel 
(The Netherlands).6
 This international diffusion of OD derives from three important 
trends: the rapid development of foreign economies, the increasing worldwide avail￾ability of technical and financial resources, and the emergence of a global economy.7
The dramatic restructuring of socialist and communist economies and the rapid 
economic growth of developing countries are numbing in scope and impact. The U.S. 
government estimates that world gross domestic product will grow an average of about 
3.1% between 2005 and 2017, from $36.1 trillion to $52.2 trillion. Projected growth 
rates in East Asia and Pacific and South Asia remain strong. The European Union con￾tinues its push for integration through fiscal policies, the admission of new countries, 
and the rationalizing of economic standards. Political transformations in the Middle 
East, China, Russia, and South Africa will produce both uncertainty and new growth￾oriented economies.
Organizations operating in these rejuvenated or newly emerging economies are 
increasingly turning to OD practices to embrace opportunities and improve effective￾ness. In China, for example, economic reforms are breaking up the “work units”—
operational business units organized with housing, health care, education, food service, 
and other infrastructure organizations—that used to dominate the Chinese economy. 
As these work units are disbanded so that the operational unit can address “market fac￾ing” issues, the social fabric of China is severely shocked. A variety of nongovernmen￾tal organizations (NGOs) have formed to help China develop a “civil society.” Many 
of these organizations, such as Global Village of Beijing, Friends of the Earth, and the 
Green Earth Volunteers, are using appreciative inquiry interventions to identify best 
practices and capacity-building processes. Ways of working together are being devel￾oped and networks of these NGOs are coming together to assist the homeless, build 
environmental awareness, and deliver childcare. Other interventions, including work 
design, survey feedback, and leadership development, represent efforts to increase 
ownership, commitment, and productivity in Chinese organizations.
The second trend contributing to OD applications in global settings is the unprec￾edented availability of technological and financial resources on a worldwide scale. The 
development of the Internet and e-commerce has increased foreign governments’ and 
organizations’ access to enormous information resources and fueled growth and devel￾opment. The increased availability of capital and technology, for example, was cited as 
a primary reason for the rise of Chilean firms in the 1980s.8
 Information technology, 
in particular, is making the world “smaller” and more interdependent. As organizations 
outside the United States adopt new technology, the opportunity increases to apply 
techniques that facilitate planned change. OD interventions can smooth the transition 
to a new reporting structure, clarify roles and relationships, and reduce the uncertainty 
associated with implementing new techniques and practices.
The final trend fueling international OD applications is the emergence of a global 
economy.9
 The continued growth of China’s economy, the spread of terrorism on a 
worldwide basis, and the impact of global warming aptly demonstrate how interdepen￾dent the world’s markets have become. Many foreign organizations are maturing and 
growing by entering the global business community. Lowered trade barriers, deregula￾tion, and privatization aid this international expansion. The established relationships 616 PART 7 Special Applications of Organization Development
and local knowledge that once favored only a small number of worldwide organiza￾tions no longer are barriers to entry into many countries.10 As organizations expand 
globally, they are faced with adapting structures, information systems, coordinating 
processes, and human resources practices to worldwide operations in a variety of 
countries. This has led to OD interventions geared to planned change across different 
cultures and economies.
The success of OD in settings outside the United States depends on two key contin￾gencies: cultural context and economic development. First, OD interventions need to be 
responsive to the cultural values and organizational customs of the host country if the 
changes are to produce the kinds of positive results shown in the United States.11 For 
example, team-building interventions in Latin American countries can fail if there is too 
much emphasis on personal disclosure and interpersonal relationships. Latin Americans 
typically value masculinity and a devotion to family, avoid conflict, and are status con￾scious. They may be suspicious of human process interventions that seek to establish 
trust, openness, and equality, and consequently they may resist them actively. The more 
a country’s cultural values match the traditional values of OD, the less likely it is that an 
intervention will have to be modified. Second, a country’s economic development can 
affect the success of OD interventions.12 For example, organizations operating in countries 
with moderate levels of economic development may need business-oriented interventions 
more than OD kinds of changes. Indeed, little may be gained from addressing interper￾sonal conflict in a top-management team if the organization has difficulty getting products 
shipped or delivering service.
Cultural Context
Researchers have proposed that applying OD in different countries requires a “ context￾based” approach to planned change.13 This involves fitting the change process to the 
organization’s cultural context, including the values held by members in the particular 
country or region. These beliefs inform people about behaviors that are important and 
acceptable in their culture. Cultural values play a major role in shaping the customs 
and practices that occur within organizations as well, influencing how members react 
to phenomena having to do with power, conflict, ambiguity, time, and change.
There is a growing body of knowledge about cultural diversity and its effect on 
organizational and management practices.14 Researchers have identified five key values 
that describe national cultures and influence organizational customs: context orienta￾tion, power distance, uncertainty avoidance, achievement orientation, and individual￾ism (Table 23.1).15
Context Orientation This value describes how information is conveyed and time 
is valued in a culture. In low-context cultures, such as Scandinavia and the United 
States, information is communicated directly in words and phrases. By using more 
specific words, more meaning is expressed. In addition, time is viewed as discrete 
and linear—as something that can be spent, used, saved, or wasted. In high- context 
cultures, on the other hand, the communication medium reflects the message more 
than the words, and time is a fluid and flexible concept. For example, social cues in 
Japan and Venezuela provide as much, if not more, information about a particular 
situation than do words alone. Business practices in high-context cultures emphasize 
ceremony and ritual. For example, knowing how to exchange business cards, partici￾pate in a reception, or conducting a banquet in China honors the client and facili￾tates business relationships. How one behaves is an important signal of support and 
compliance with the way things are done. Structures are less formal in high-context 
cultures; there are few written policies and procedures to guide behavior. Because 
high-context cultures view time as fluid, punctuality for appointments is less a prior￾ity than is maintaining relationships.CHAPTER 23 Organization Development in Global Settings 617
Power Distance This value concerns the way people view authority, status differences, 
and influence patterns. People in high power-distance regions, such as Latin America 
and Eastern Europe, tend to accept unequal distributions of power and influence, 
and consequently autocratic and paternalistic decision-making practices are the norm. 
Organizations in high power-distance cultures tend to be centralized, with several hier￾archical levels and a large proportion of supervisory personnel. Subordinates in these 
organizations represent a lower social class. They expect to be supervised closely and 
believe that power holders are entitled to special privileges. Such practices would be 
inappropriate in low power-distance regions, such as Scandinavia, where participative 
decision making and egalitarian methods prevail.

[Table 23.1]618 PART 7 Special Applications of Organization Development
Uncertainty Avoidance This value reflects a preference for conservative practices and 
familiar and predictable situations. People in high uncertainty-avoidance regions, such 
as Asia, prefer stable routines over change and act to maintain the status quo. They 
do not like conflict and believe that company rules should not be broken. In regions 
where uncertainty avoidance is low, such as in many European countries, ambiguity is 
less threatening. Organizations in these cultures tend to favor fewer rules, higher levels 
of participation in decision making, more organic structures, and more risk taking.
Achievement Orientation This value concerns the extent to which the culture 
favors the acquisition of power and resources. Employees from achievement-oriented 
cultures, such as Asia and Latin America, place a high value on career advancement, 
freedom, and salary growth. Organizations in these cultures pursue aggressive goals 
and can have high levels of stress and conflict. Organizational success is measured 
in terms of size, growth, and speed. On the other hand, workers in cultures where 
achievement is less of a driving value, such as those in Scandinavia, prize the social 
aspects of work, including working conditions and supervision, and typically favor 
opportunities to learn and grow at work.
Individualism This value is concerned with looking out for oneself as opposed to one’s 
group or organization. In high-individualism cultures, such as the United States and 
Australia, personal initiative and competitiveness are valued strongly. Organizations 
in individualistic cultures often have high turnover rates and individual rather than 
group decision-making processes. Employee empowerment is supported when mem￾bers believe that it improves the probability of personal gain. These cultures encour￾age personal initiative, competitiveness, and individual autonomy. Conversely, in low 
individualism countries, such as China, Japan, and Mexico, allegiance to one’s group is 
paramount. Organizations operating in these cultures tend to favor cooperation among 
employees and loyalty to the company.
Economic Development
In addition to cultural context, an important contingency affecting OD success inter￾nationally is a country’s level of industrial and economic development. For example, 
although long considered an industrial economy, Russia’s political and economic trans￾formation, and the concomitant increases in uncertainties over infrastructure, corrup￾tion, cash flow, and exchange rates, has radically altered assumptions underlying business 
practices. Thus, economic development can be judged from social, economic, and politi￾cal perspectives.16 For example, it can be reflected in a country’s management capability 
as measured by information systems and skills; decision-making and action-taking capa￾bilities; project planning and organizing abilities; evaluation and control technologies; 
leadership, motivational, and reward systems; and human selection, placement, and 
development levels. The United Nations’ Human Development Programme has created 
a Human Development Index that assesses a country’s economic development in terms 
of life expectancy, educational attainment, and adjusted real income.
Subsistence Economies Countries such as Pakistan, Nepal, Nigeria, Uganda, and 
Rwanda have relatively low degrees of development and their economies are primar￾ily agriculture-based. Their populations consume most of what they produce, and any 
surplus is used to barter for other needed goods and services. A large proportion of 
the population is unfamiliar with the concept of “employment.” Working for someone 
else in exchange for wages is not common or understood, and consequently few large 
organizations exist outside of the government. In subsistence economies, OD interven￾tions emphasize global social change and focus on creating conditions for sustainable 
social and economic progress. These change methods are described in the last section 
of this chapter.CHAPTER 23 Organization Development in Global Settings 619
Industrializing Economies Malaysia, Venezuela, India, Turkey, the Philippines, Iran, 
and the People’s Republic of China are moderately developed and tend to be rich in 
natural resources. An expanding manufacturing base that accounts for increasing 
amounts of the country’s gross domestic product fuels economic growth. The rise of 
manufacturing also contributes to the formation of a class system including upper-, 
middle-, and low-income groups. Organizations operating in these nations generally 
focus on efficiency of operations and revenue growth. Consequently, OD interventions 
address strategic, structural, and work design issues.17 They help organizations identify 
domestic and international markets, develop clear and appropriate goals, and structure 
themselves to achieve efficient performance and market growth.
Industrial Economies Highly developed countries, such as Sweden, Japan, France, 
and the United States, emphasize nonagricultural industry. In these economies, manu￾factured goods are exported and traded with other industrialized countries; investment 
funds are available both internally and externally; the workforce is educated and 
skilled; and technology is often substituted for labor. Because the OD interventions 
described in this book were developed primarily in industrial economies, they can 
be expected to have their strongest effects in those contexts. Their continued success 
cannot be ensured, however, because these countries are advancing rapidly to postin￾dustrial conditions. Here, OD interventions will need to fit into economies driven 
by information and knowledge, where service outpaces manufacturing, and where 
national and organizational boundaries are more open and flexible.
How Cultural Context and Economic Development 
Affect OD Practice
The contingencies of cultural context and economic development can have powerful 
effects on the way OD is carried out in various countries.18 They can determine whether 
change proceeds slowly or quickly; involves few or many members; is directed by hier￾archical authority or by consensus; and focuses on business, organizational, or human 
process issues. For example, planned change processes in Russia require more clarity in 
roles, the development of common understandings, changes in how an organization’s 
vision is communicated, and the insightful use of symbols and signals.19 When the two 
contingencies are considered together, they reveal four different international settings 
for OD practice, as shown in Figure 23.1. These different situations reflect the extent 
to which a country’s culture fits with traditional OD values of direct and honest com￾munication, sharing power, and improving their effectiveness and the degree to which 
the country is economically developed.20
In Figure 23.1, the degree of economic development is restricted to industrializing 
and highly industrialized regions. Subsistence economies are not included because they 
afford little opportunity to practice traditional OD; in those contexts, a more appropri￾ate strategy is global social change, discussed later in this chapter. In general, however, 
the more developed the economy, the more OD is applied to the organizational and 
human process issues described in this book. In less developed situations, OD focuses 
on business issues, such as procuring raw materials, producing efficiently, and market￾ing successfully.21 On the other hand, when the country’s culture supports traditional 
OD values, the planned change process can be applied to organizational and human 
process issues with only small adjustments.22 The more the cultural context differs from 
OD’s traditional values profile, the more the planned change process will need to be 
modified to fit the situation.
Low Cultural Fit, Moderate Industrialization This context is least suited to traditional 
OD practice. It includes industrializing economies with cultural values that align poorly 
with OD values, including many Middle East nations, such as Iraq, Iran, and the United 620 PART 7 Special Applications of Organization Development
Arab Republic; the South Pacific region, including Malaysia and the Philippines; and 
certain South American countries, such as Brazil, Ecuador, Guatemala, and Nicaragua. 
These regions are highly dependent on their natural resources and have a relatively 
small manufacturing base. They tend to be high-context cultures with values of high 
power distance and achievement orientation and of moderate uncertainty avoidance. 
They are not a bad fit with OD values because these cultures tend toward moderate or 
high levels of collectivism, especially in relation to family.
These settings require change processes that fit local customs and that address busi￾ness issues. As might be expected, little is written on applying OD in these countries, 
and there are even fewer reports of OD practice. Cultural values of high power distance 
and achievement are inconsistent with traditional OD activities emphasizing openness, 
collaboration, and empowerment. Moreover, executives in industrializing economies 
frequently equate OD with human process interventions, such as team building, train￾ing, and conflict management. They perceive OD as too soft to meet their business needs. 
For example, Egyptian and Filipino managers tend to be autocratic, engage in protracted 
decision making, and focus on economic and business problems. Consequently, orga￾nizational change is slow paced, centrally controlled, and aimed at achieving technical 
rationality and efficiency.23
These contextual forces do not influence all organizations in the same way. A recent 
study of 20 large-group interventions in Mexico suggests that culture may not be as con￾straining as has been hypothesized.24 Similarly, in an apparent exception to the rule, the 
president of Semco S/A (Brazil), Ricardo Semler, designed a highly participative organiza￾tion.25 Most Semco employees set their own working hours and approve hires and pro￾motions. Information flows downward through a relatively flat hierarchy, and strategic 
decisions are made participatively by companywide vote. Brazil’s cultural values are not 
as strong on power distance and masculinity as in other Latin American countries, and 
that may explain the apparent success of this high-involvement organization. It suggests 
that OD interventions can be implemented within this cultural context when strongly 
supported by senior management.

settings support the kinds of OD processes described in this book, especially techno￾structural and strategic interventions that focus on business development. According 
to data on economic development and cultural values, relatively few countries fit this 
context. India’s industrial base and democratic society are growing rapidly and may fit 
this contingency. Similarly, South Africa’s recent political and cultural changes make it 
one of the most interesting settings in which to practice OD.26
South Africa is an industrializing economy. Its major cities are the manufacturing 
hubs of the economy, although agriculture and mining still dominate in rural areas. 
The country’s values are in transition and may become more consistent with OD 
values. South Africans customarily have favored a low-context orientation; relatively 
high levels of power distance; and moderate levels of individualism, uncertainty avoid￾ance, and achievement orientation. Organizations typically have been bureaucratic 
with authoritarian management, established career paths, and job security primarily 
for Caucasian employees. These values and organizational conditions are changing, 
however, as the nation’s political and governance structures are transformed. Formerly, 
apartheid policies reduced uncertainty and defined power differences among citizens. 
Today, free elections and the abolishment of apartheid have increased uncertainty dras￾tically and established legal equality among the races. These changes are likely to move 
South Africa’s values closer to those underlying OD. If so, OD interventions should 
become increasingly relevant to that nation’s organizations.
A study of large South African corporations suggests the directions that OD is 
likely to take in that setting.27 The study interviewed internal OD practitioners about 
key organizational responses to the political changes in the country, such as the 
free election of Nelson Mandela, abolishment of apartheid, and the Reconstruction 
and Development Program. Change initiatives at Spoornet, Eskom, and Telkom, for 
example, centered around two strategic and organizational issues. First, the political 
changes opened up new international markets, provided access to new technologies, 
and exposed these organizations to global competition. Consequently, these firms 
initiated planned change efforts to create corporate visions and identify strategies for 
entering new markets and acquiring new technologies. Second, the political changes 
forced corporations to modify specific human resources and organizational practices. 
The most compelling change was mandated affirmative action quotas. At Spoornet, 
Eskom, and Telkom, apartheid was thoroughly embedded in the organizations’ struc￾tures, policies, and physical arrangements. Thus, planned change focused on revising 
human resources policies and practices. Similarly, organizational structures that had fit 
well within the stable environment of apartheid were outmoded and too rigid to meet 
the competitive challenges of international markets. Planned changes for restructuring 
these firms were implemented as part of longer-term strategies to change corporate 
culture toward more egalitarian and market-driven values.
Low Cultural Fit, High Industrialization This international setting includes industrial￾ized countries with cultures that fit poorly with traditional OD values. Many countries 
in Central America, Eastern Asia, and Eastern Europe fit this description. Reviews 
of OD practice in those regions suggest that planned change includes all four types 
of interventions described in this book, although the change process itself is adapted 
to local conditions.28 For example, Mexico, Venezuela, China, Japan, and Korea are 
high-context cultures where knowledge of local mannerisms, customs, and rituals is 
required to understand the meaning of communicated information. To function in such 
settings, OD practitioners must know not only the language but the social customs as 
well. Similarly, cultural values emphasizing high levels of power distance, uncertainty 
avoidance, and achievement orientation foster organizations where roles, status differ￾ences, and working conditions are clear; where autocratic and paternalistic decisions 
are expected; and where the acquisition of wealth and influence by the powerful is 622 PART 7 Special Applications of Organization Development
accepted. OD interventions that focus on social processes and employee empowerment 
are not favored naturally in this cultural context and consequently need to be modified 
to fit the situations.
Japanese and Korean organizations, such as Matsushita, Nissan, Toyota, Fujitsu, 
NEC, and Hyundai, provide good examples of how OD interventions can be tailored 
to this global setting. These firms are famous for continuous improvement and TQM 
practices; they adapt these interventions to fit the Asian culture. Roles and behaviors 
required to apply TQM are highly specified, thereby holding uncertainty to a relatively 
low level. Teamwork and consensus decision-making practices associated with qual￾ity improvement projects also help to manage uncertainty. When large numbers of 
employees are involved, information is spread quickly and members are kept informed 
about the changes taking place. Management controls the change process by regulating 
the implementation of suggestions made by the problem-solving groups. Because these 
interventions focus on work processes, teamwork and employee involvement do not 
threaten the power structure. Moreover, TQM and continuous improvement do not 
alter the organization radically but produce small, incremental changes that can add 
up to impressive gains in long-term productivity and cost reduction.
In these cultures, OD practitioners also tailor the change process itself to fit local 
conditions. Mexican companies, for example, expect OD practitioners to act as experts 
and to offer concrete advice on how to improve the organization. To be successful, 
OD practitioners need sufficient status and legitimacy to work with senior manage￾ment and to act in expert roles.29 Status typically is associated with academic creden￾tials, senior management experience, high-level titles, or recommendations by highly 
placed executives and administrators. As might be expected, the change process in 
Latin America is autocratic and driven downward from the top of the organization. 
Subordinates or lower-status people generally are not included in diagnostic or imple￾mentation activities because inclusion might equalize power differences and threaten 
the status quo. Moreover, cultural norms discourage employees from speaking out or 
openly criticizing management. There is relatively little resistance to change because 
employees readily accept changes dictated by management.
In Asia, OD is an orderly process, driven by consensus and challenging performance 
goals. Organizational changes are implemented slowly and methodically, so trust builds 
and change-related uncertainty is reduced. Changing too quickly is seen as arrogant, 
divisive, and threatening. At the China Association for the International Exchange of 
Personnel, the move from a government bureau to a “market-facing” organization has 
been gradual but consistent. Managers have been encouraged to contact more and 
more foreign organizations, to develop relationships and contracts, and to learn mar￾keting and organization development skills. Because Asian values promote a cautious 
culture that prizes consensus, dignity, and respect, OD tends to be impersonal and to 
focus mainly on work-flow improvements. Human process issues are rarely addressed 
because people are expected to act in ways that do not cause others to “lose face” or 
to bring shame to the group.
Application 23.1 describes an action research project in China designed to increase 
the capacity of human resource and training departments. The OD practitioners, who 
were from Switzerland, and the participants report on the learnings they had as a 
result of the program. As you look at the design and implementation of the program, 
what do you see as the pros and cons of their work?30
High Cultural Fit, High Industrialization This last setting includes industrialized coun￾tries with cultural contexts that fit well with traditional OD values. Much of the OD 
practice described in this book was developed in these situations, particularly in the 
United States.31 To extend our learning, we will focus on how OD is practiced in other 
nations in this global setting, including the Scandinavian countries—Sweden, Norway, Modernizing China’s Human Resource 
Development and Training Functions
The economic, political, and cultural changes sweep￾ing through the People’s Republic of China (PRC) 
are complex in both scope and breadth. China 
has evolved from an isolated and underdeveloped 
country to an economic growth engine. Since 1979, 
China’s GDP has more than quadrupled as a result 
of its transition to a “market-facing” economy. 
Despite clear intentions to conduct the transition in 
ways that honor, support, and reinforce the Chinese 
culture, balancing these changes has not been easy. 
For example, the 70,000 state-owned enterprises 
have been forced to reinvent themselves through 
financial restructuring, massive downsizings, and 
upgrading the competencies of their employees. In 
the mid-1990s, the capability to manage the human 
resource consequences of breaking up the old work 
units, downsizing various parts of the organization, 
and developing managers just didn’t exist inside 
the country. China’s training and human resource 
development departments were ill prepared to 
respond to these demands. As a context for OD, 
China represents a set of cultural values that are 
very different from Europe and North America.
In an effort to assist in the development of China’s 
human resource development capacity, OD prac￾titioners from the Center for Socio-Eco-Nomic 
Development (CSEND) in Switzerland were called 
in to act as technical advisors to a unit of the 
Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) Organization 
Department. A separate training institute called 
the China Training Centre for Senior Personnel 
Management Officials (CTCSPMO) was established 
and initial institution building efforts were financed 
by the United Nations Development Program 
(UNDP).
One output of the CTCSPMO was the Sino-Swiss 
bilateral project (SSBP), a program designed to 
increase the institutional capacity of Chinese 
public administrators to manage change. The 
strategy was to work with a small group of expe￾rienced training managers and trainers to apply 
the concepts and techniques of modern manage￾ment training and organization development. The 
Chinese participants were to form the vanguard of 
a new generation of Chinese public management 
trainers and HRD managers and to act as a catalyst 
in bringing about the institutional development of 
their respective organizations.
In designing the program, the Chinese and 
Swiss partners had to ensure that the skills and 
knowledge of human resource and organization 
development would be transferred not only to the 
participants but also to the administrative systems 
and training institutions involved in the program. 
Based on observations and interviews with Chinese 
government officials, communist party members, 
faculty members at different Chinese educational 
institutions, and training and human resource man￾agers in Chinese organizations, the OD practitio￾ners recommended a combination of action learning
(AL) and action research (AR) methods. AR and AL 
were seen as appropriate techniques because they 
had not been tried before in China, offered viable 
tools for developing internal capacity for continu￾ous improvement and for systemwide multilevel 
intervention, and were centrally concerned with 
transferring capacity to the client system. These 
action-based approaches constituted a pioneering 
attempt of international know-how transfer.
During the initial preparatory phase between 
September 1993 and March 1994, the 60 selected 
participants were given intensive English-language 
courses. Then, beginning in March 1994, the pro￾gram began with a series of “programmed learning” 
workshops followed by a “workplace application” 
experience. The cycle of programmed learning 
and workplace application was then repeated. 
Following each workplace application period, a 
conference was organized to review the project 
work and its findings, to exchange experiences, and 
to reflect on the learnings generated. The two cycles 
were completed in December 1996.
The programmed learning workshops covered 10 
different topic areas, such as comparative public 
administration, human resource management, organ￾izational theory and development, adult learning 
theories and methods, and training management. 
These topics were taught in the classrooms by foreign 
experts in Beijing. The workplace application proj￾ects involved creating groups of participants from 
similar provincial areas or functional responsibilities 
to address actual human resource, training and 
application 23.1624 PART 7 Special Applications of Organization Development
development, or organizational change issues. The 
project organization consulted with the Chinese 
partner organization, CTCSPMO, to approve a vari￾ety of learning projects, including the redesign of a 
management development program for senior party 
officials in Beijing, developing a training program 
for managers guiding large infrastructure projects, 
and research on human resources and motivation 
practices in state-owned enterprises.
In addition to the project work, the workplace 
application groups were instructed to meet every 
two weeks either face-to-face or by phone. Practically, 
most of the meetings were by phone due to physi￾cal distance. The purpose of these meetings was to 
reflect on the project’s progress, review how topics 
from the learning workshop were being applied, 
and to capture personal learnings. The participants 
were also asked to keep a journal and the group was 
assigned a facilitator to work with them.
In reviewing the first two rounds of learning and 
action, several observations were made. First, the 
Chinese participants learned:
• to participate actively in the learning process 
and take responsibility for the relevance of their 
learning;
• to redefine the role of a “good” trainer/teacher;
• to question each other and the trainer/teacher’s 
statements as “facts,” “opinion,” or “truth”;
• to challenge the widely held belief that “the bird 
who raise its head will be shot first”; and
• to perceive the social process and group dynamics 
of learning as beneficial, not chaotic or lacking 
discipline.
In addition, the OD practitioners learned:
• to question and to reflect on their own assump￾tions concerning Chinese culture, organizations, 
human relations, and management theories;
• to confront their own cultural biases in a 
foreign environment that had its own logic in 
getting things done;
• to find ways to work as a team with the 
Chinese facilitators, who had different ways of 
relating;
• to refrain from assuming responsibility for the 
Chinese partners;
• to facilitate rather than dominate; and
• to sustain the interest and commitment of 
the CTCSPMO and facilitators to the action 
research and action learning approach.
Reactions from different stakeholders, including 
the Deputy Directors of the provincial organization 
department of the CCP, the Deputy Commissioner 
of the State Commission of the Nationalities, the 
Academic Dean of the Central Party School, and the 
Directors of Training of the Ministry of Personnel 
and the State Economic and Trade Commission, 
were in general positive. They found the results 
of the action research informative and the recom￾mended solutions helpful. A reportedly high rate of 
project recommendation implementation was later 
verified by a team of international independent 
reviewers, and a final project evaluation conducted 
in October 1997 confirmed the initial positive 
assessment.
The SSBP program allowed the Chinese government 
and the CCP to acquire cutting edge know-how in 
management development and training. At the 
same time, they were able to review the vari￾ous training programs being provided for senior 
government officials, enterprise executives, and 
party officials in China. Based on the findings from 
action learning projects, the training department 
of the CCP revised their training requirements, 
adjusted their training approach, and added more 
skill-based topics to the curriculum.
Finland, and Denmark—and countries with a strong British heritage, such as Great 
Britain, Northern Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand.
Scandinavians enjoy a high standard of living and strong economic development. 
Because their cultural values most closely match those traditionally espoused in OD, 
organizational practices are highly participative and egalitarian. OD practice tends 
to mirror these values. Multiple stakeholders, such as managers, unionists, and staff CHAPTER 23 Organization Development in Global Settings 625
personnel, actively are involved in all stages of the change process, from entry and 
diagnosis to intervention and evaluation. This level of involvement is much higher 
than that typically occurring in the United States. It results in a change process that 
is heavily oriented to the needs of shop-floor participants. Norwegian labor laws, for 
example, give unionists the right to participate in technological innovations that can 
affect their work lives. Such laws also mandate that all employees in the country have 
the right to enriched forms of work.
Given this cultural context, it is not surprising that Scandinavian companies pioneered 
sociotechnical interventions to improve productivity and quality of work life. Sweden’s 
Saab and Volvo restructured automobile manufacturing around self-managed work 
groups. Denmark’s Patent Office and Norway’s Shell Oil demonstrated how union–
management cooperative projects can enhance employee involvement throughout 
the organization. In many cases, national governments were involved heavily in these 
change projects by sponsoring industrywide improvement efforts. The Norwegian gov￾ernment, for example, was instrumental in introducing industrial democracy to that 
nation’s companies. It helped union and management in selected industries implement 
pilot projects to enhance productivity and quality of work life. The results of these socio￾technical experiments were then diffused throughout the Norwegian economy. In many 
ways, the Scandinavian countries have gone further than other global regions in linking 
OD to national values and policies.
Countries associated with the United Kingdom tend to have values consistent with a 
low-context orientation, moderate to high individualism and achievement orientation, 
and moderate to low power distance and uncertainty avoidance. This cultural pattern 
results in personal relationships that often seem indirect to Americans. For example, 
a British subordinate who is told to think about a proposal is really being told that the 
suggestion has been rejected. These values also promote organizational policies that are 
steeped in formality, tradition, and politics. The United Kingdom’s long history tends to 
reinforce the status quo, and consequently resistance to change is high.
OD practice in the United Kingdom parallels the cultural pattern described above. 
In Great Britain, for example, sociotechnical systems theory was developed by 
practitioners at the Tavistock Institute of Human Relations.32 Applications such as 
self-managed work groups, however, have not readily diffused within British organi￾zations. The individualistic values and inherently political nature of this culture tend 
to conflict with interventions emphasizing employee empowerment and teamwork. 
In contrast, the Scandinavian cultures are far more supportive of sociotechnical prac￾tice and have been instrumental in diffusing it worldwide.
The emergence of the European Union has served as a catalyst for change in many 
organizations. Companies such as Akzo Nobel, Unilever, BMW, and Credit Lyonnais 
are actively engaged in strategic change interventions. At L’Oreal, CEO Lindsay Owen￾Jones implemented an aggressive strategy of acquiring and integrating cosmetic firms, 
driving the international business, and building its brand.33 More limited interventions, 
such as team building, conflict resolution, and work redesign, are being carried out in 
such organizations as Carrefour and British Telecom.
WORLDWIDE ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
An important trend facing many business firms is the emergence of a global 
marketplace. Driven by competitive pressures, lowered trade barriers, and advances 
in information technologies, the number of companies offering products and services 
in multiple countries is increasing rapidly. The organizational growth and complex￾ity associated with managing worldwide operations is challenging. Executives must 
choose appropriate strategic orientations for operating across cultures and geographical 626 PART 7 Special Applications of Organization Development
locations, and under diverse governmental and environmental requirements. They 
must be able to adapt corporate policies and procedures to a range of local conditions. 
Moreover, the tasks of controlling and coordinating operations in different nations 
place heavy demands on information and control systems and on managerial skills 
and knowledge.
Worldwide organization development applies to organizations that are operating 
across multiple geographic and cultural boundaries. This contrasts with OD in organi￾zations that operate outside the United States but within a single cultural and economic 
context. This section describes the emerging practice of OD in worldwide organizations, 
a relatively new but important area of planned change.
Worldwide Strategic Orientations
Worldwide organizations can be defined in terms of three key facets.34 First, they offer 
products or services in more than one country and actively manage substantial direct 
investments in those countries. Consequently, they must relate to a variety of demands, 
such as unique product requirements, tariffs, value-added taxes, governmental regula￾tions, transportation laws, and trade agreements. Second, worldwide firms must balance 
product and functional concerns with geographic issues of distance, time, and culture. 
American tobacco companies, for example, face technological, moral, and organizational 
issues in determining whether to market cigarettes in less-developed countries, and if 
they do, they must decide how to integrate manufacturing and distribution operations on 
a global scale. Third, worldwide companies must carry out coordinated activities across 
cultural boundaries using a wide variety of personnel, including expatriates, short-term 
and extended business travelers, and local employees. Workers with different cultural 
backgrounds must be managed in ways that support the overall goals and image of the 
organization.35 The company must therefore adapt its human resources policies and 
procedures to fit the culture and accomplish operational objectives. From a managerial 
perspective, selecting executives to head foreign operations is an important decision in 
worldwide organizations.
How these three facets of products/services, organization, and personnel are 
arranged enable firms to compete in the global marketplace.36 Worldwide organiza￾tions can offer certain products or services in some countries and not in others; they 
can centralize or decentralize operations; and they can determine how to work with 
people from different cultures. Despite the many possible combinations of characteris￾tics, researchers have found that two dimensions are useful in guiding decisions about 
choices of strategic orientation.
As shown in Figure 23.2, managers need to assess two key success factors: the 
degrees to which there is a need for global integration or for local responsiveness. 
Global integration refers to whether or not business success requires tight coordination 
of people, plants, equipment, products, or service delivery on a worldwide basis. For 
example, Intel’s “global factory” designs chips in multiple countries, manufactures 
the chips in a variety of locations around the world, assembles and tests the finished 
products in different countries, and then ships the chips to customers. All of this activ￾ity must be coordinated carefully. Local responsiveness, on the other hand, is the extent 
to which business success is dependent on customizing products, services, support, 
packaging, and other aspects of operations to local conditions. Based on that infor￾mation, worldwide organizations generally implement one of four types of strategic 
orientations: international, global, multinational, or transnational. Table 23.2 presents 
these orientations in terms of the diagnostic framework described in Chapter 5. Each 
strategic orientation is geared to specific market, technological, and organizational 
requirements. OD interventions that support each orientation are also included in 
Table 23.2.CHAPTER 23 Organization Development in Global Settings 627
The International Strategic Orientation
The international orientation exists when the key success factors of global integration 
and local responsiveness are low. This is the most common label given to organizations 
making their first attempts at operating outside their own country’s markets. Success 
requires coordination between the parent company and the small number of foreign 
sales and marketing offices in chosen countries. Similarly, local responsiveness is low 
because the organization exports the same products and services offered domestically. 
When an organization has decided to expand internationally, it has most often deter￾mined that:
other country-markets appear to offer specific advantages large enough to exceed 
the tangible and intangible costs of implementing a new strategy,
the organization’s products, services, and value propositions are sufficiently power￾ful to counteract the initial disadvantages of operating in a foreign location, and
the organizational capabilities exist to extract value from the foreign operations in 
excess of simpler contracting or licensing of the organization’s technology, products, 
or services in the foreign location.37
Characteristics of the International Design The goal of the international orienta￾tion is to increase total sales by adding revenues from non-domestic markets. By using 
existing products/services, domestic operating capacity is extended and leveraged. As 
a result, most domestic companies will enter international markets by extending their 
product lines first into nearby countries and then expanding to more remote areas. For 
example, most U.S.-based companies first offer their products in Canada or Mexico. 
After a certain period of time, they begin to set up operations in other countries.
To support this goal and operations strategy, an “international division” is given 
responsibility for marketing, sales, and distribution, although it may be able to set up 
joint ventures, licensing agreements, distribution territories/franchises, and in some 
cases, manufacturing plants. The organization basically retains its original structure

and operating practices. The information system governing the division is typically 
looser, however. While expecting returns on its investment, the organization recog￾nizes the newness of the venture and gives the international division some “free rein” 
to establish an international presence.
Finally, roles in the new international division are staffed with volunteers from the 
parent company, often with someone who has appropriate foreign language training, 
experience living overseas, or eagerness for an international assignment. Little training 
or orientation for the position is offered as the organization is generally unaware of the 
requirements for being successful in international business.

Characteristics and Interventions for Worldwide Strategic Orientations
[Table 23.2]CHAPTER 23 Organization Development in Global Settings 629
Implementing the International Orientation Changing from a domestic to an interna￾tional organization represents an incremental shift in scope for most firms, and is typically 
handled as a simple extension of the existing strategy into new markets. Despite the logic 
of such thinking, the shift is neither incremental nor simple and OD can play an impor￾tant role in making the transition smoother and more productive.
Strategic planning, technostructural, and human resource interventions can help to 
implement an international orientation. Managers can use integrated strategic change 
or an organization redesign process to design and manage the transition from the old 
strategic orientation to the new one. Environmental scans, competitor analyses, and 
market studies can be done to calibrate expectations about revenue goals and deter￾mine the levels of investment necessary to support the division. Team building and 
large-group interventions, such as search conferences, can aid the process through 
which senior executives gather appropriate information about international mar￾kets, distinctive competencies, and culture, and then choose a strategic orientation. 
Similarly, managers can apply technostructural interventions to design an appropriate 
organization structure, to define new tasks and work roles, and to clarify reporting 
relationships between corporate headquarters and foreign-based units. Based on these 
decisions, OD interventions can help the organization to implement the change.
Managers and staff can also apply human resources management interventions to 
train and prepare managers and their families for international assignments and to 
develop selection methods and reward systems relevant to operating internationally.38
Since these are the organization’s first experiences with international business, OD 
practitioners can alert key managers and potential candidates for the international 
assignments to the need for cultural training. Candidates can be directed to out￾sourced offerings on cross-cultural skills, local country customs, and legal/regulatory 
conditions. OD practitioners can also assist the human resource organization to design 
or modify existing compensation and benefits packages, or set up policies around 
housing, schooling, and other expenses associated with the relocation.
This initial movement into the international arena enables domestic organizations to 
learn about the demands of the global marketplace, thus providing important knowl￾edge and experience with the requirements for success in more sophisticated strategies. 
OD practitioners should help the organization set up learning practices and commu￾nication systems so that information about international experiences are shared with 
others, especially senior managers.
The Global Strategic Orientation
This orientation exists when the need for global integration is high but the need for 
local responsiveness is low. The global orientation is characterized by a strategy of 
marketing standardized products in different countries. It is an appropriate orientation 
when there is little economic reason to offer products or services with special features 
or locally available options. Manufacturers of office equipment, consumer goods, com￾puters and semiconductors, tires, and containers, for example, can offer the same basic 
product in almost any country.
Characteristics of the Global Design The goal of efficiency dominates this orientation. 
Production efficiency is gained through volume sales and a small number of large manu￾facturing plants, and managerial efficiency is achieved by centralizing product design, 
manufacturing, distribution, and marketing decisions. Global integration is supported by 
the close physical proximity of major functional groups and formal control systems that 
balance inputs, production, and distribution with worldwide demand. Many Japanese 
firms, such as Honda, Sony, NEC, and Matsushita, used this strategy in the 1970s and 
early 1980s to grow in the international economy. In Europe, Nestlé exploits economies 
of scale in marketing by advertising well-known brand names around the world. The 630 PART 7 Special Applications of Organization Development
increased number of microwave and two-income families, for example, allowed Nestlé 
to push its Nescafé coffee and Lean Cuisine low-calorie frozen dinners to dominant 
market-share positions in Europe, North America, Latin America, and Asia. Similarly, a 
Korean noodle maker, Nong Shim Company, avoided the 1999 financial crisis by staying 
focused on efficiency. Yoo Jong Suk, Nong Shim’s head of strategy, went against recom￾mendations to diversify and stated, “All we want is to be globally recognized as a ramyon 
maker.”39
In the global orientation, the organization tends to be centralized with a global 
product structure. Presidents of each major product group report to the CEO and 
form the line organization. Each of these product groups is responsible for worldwide 
operations. Information systems in global orientations tend to be quite formal with 
local units reporting sales, costs, and other data directly to the product president. The 
predominant human resources policy integrates people into the organization through 
ethnocentric selection and staffing practices. These methods seek to fill key foreign 
positions with personnel from the home country where the corporation headquarters 
is located.40 Key managerial jobs at Volvo, Siemens, Nissan, and Michelin, for example, 
are often occupied by Swedish, German, Japanese, and French citizens, respectively. 
Ethnocentric policies support the global orientation because expatriate managers are 
more likely than host-country nationals to recognize and comply with the need to 
centralize decision making and to standardize processes, decisions, and relationships 
with the parent company. Although many Japanese automobile manufacturers have 
decentralized production, Nissan’s global strategy has been to retain tight, centralized 
control of design and manufacturing, ensure that almost all of its senior foreign manag￾ers are Japanese, and have even low-level decisions emerge from face-to-face meetings 
in Tokyo.
Implementing the Global Orientation OD interventions can be used to refine and 
support the global strategic orientation as well as assist in the transition from an inter￾national orientation.
Planned Change in the Global Orientation. Several OD interventions support the 
implementation of this orientation. Career planning, role clarification, employee 
involvement, conflict management, and senior management team building help 
the organization achieve improved operational efficiency. For example, role clari￾fication interventions, such as job enrichment or goal setting, and conflict man￾agement can formalize and standardize organizational activities. This ensures that 
each individual knows specific details about how, when, and why a job needs to be 
done. As a result, necessary activities are described and efficient transactions and 
relationships are created. Similarly, Intel has used training interventions to ensure 
consistent implementation of a variety of company-standard business practices, 
such as meeting protocols, performance management processes, and reporting 
accountability.
 Senior management team building can improve the quality of strategic deci￾sions. Centralized policies make the organization highly dependent on this group 
and can exaggerate decision-making errors. In addition, interpersonal conflict 
can increase the cost of coordination or cause significant coordination mistakes. 
Process interventions at this level can help to improve the speed and quality of 
decision making and improve interpersonal relationships.
 Career planning can help home-country personnel develop a path to senior 
management by including foreign subsidiary experiences and cross-functional 
assignments as necessary qualifications for advancement. At the country level, 
career planning can emphasize that advancement beyond regional operations is 
limited for host-country nationals. OD can help here by developing appropriate 
1.CHAPTER 23 Organization Development in Global Settings 631
career paths within the local organization or in technical, non-managerial areas. 
Finally, employee empowerment can support efficiency goals by involving mem￾bers in efforts at cost reduction, work standardization, and minimization of coor￾dination costs.
The Transition to a Global Orientation. In addition to fine tuning this strategic ori￾entation, OD can help the organization transition from an international to a global 
strategic orientation. The organization’s experience with the international strategic 
orientation has helped to build basic knowledge and skills in international business. 
The successful transition to a global strategy assumes that managers believe global 
integration is more important than local responsiveness and that the organization 
has strong centralized operating capabilities. If either the assessment of key success 
factors or the organization’s competencies are inaccurate, implementation will be 
more difficult and performance will suffer.
 The decision to favor global integration over local responsiveness must be 
rooted in a strong belief that the worldwide market is relatively homogenous 
in character. That is, products and services, support, distribution, or marketing 
activities can be standardized without negatively affecting sales or customer loy￾alty. This decision should not be made lightly, and OD practitioners can help to 
structure rigorous debate and analysis of this key success factor.
 In addition to information about the market, organizations must take into 
account their distinctive competencies when choosing a global strategy. The key 
organizational and operational competence necessary for success in a global strat￾egy is the ability to coordinate a complex, worldwide organization. The global 
strategy is facilitated when culture and core competencies are more suited for 
centralized decision making, when the organization has experience with supply -
chain management, and when it is comfortable with enterprise resource and 
material resource planning processes. Centralization favors a global orientation 
because the orientation favors tight, global coordination.
 Once companies develop a strategic orientation for competing internationally, 
they create an organization design to support it. Information like that found in 
Table 23.2 is useful for designing structures, information systems, and personnel 
practices for specific strategic orientations. OD practitioners can help to design 
change management programs to implement these features.
Application 23.2 describes how one organization faced the challenges of implementing 
a global strategy.41 They tried to find the right balance between strong headquarters 
control and local responsiveness. The OD practitioner in the case describes her data, 
actions, and results. Would you do things differently?
The Multinational Strategic Orientation
This strategic orientation exists when the need for global integration is low, but the 
need for local responsiveness is high. It represents a strategy that is conceptually quite 
different from the global strategic orientation.
Characteristics of the Multinational Design A multinational strategy is characterized 
by a product line that is tailored to local conditions and is best suited to markets that 
vary significantly from region to region or country to country. At American Express, for 
example, charge card marketing is fitted to local values and tastes. The “Don’t leave home 
without it” and “Membership has its privileges” themes seen in the United States had to 
be translated to “Peace of mind only for members” in Japan because of the negative con￾notations of “leaving home” and “privilege.”42
The multinational orientation emphasizes a decentralized, global division structure. 
Each region or country is served by a divisional organization that operates autonomously 
2.Implementing the Global Strategy: Changing 
the Culture of Work in Western China
China has a strong culture, but one that allows it, 
paradoxically, to assimilate other ideas and phi￾losophies. For example, Buddhism was added to 
Confucianism during the heydays of the Silk Road 
and China has adapted to globalization quickly 
since it began market reforms in the early 1990s. 
For many firms entering China, the question is, 
Will China assimilate Western cultural ways from 
the multinational corporations that enter, or will 
they insist on a Chinese cultural process of doing 
business? This application describes the process one 
American technology company utilizing a global 
worldwide strategy used in opening a manufactur￾ing plant in a western Chinese province. The story 
is told from the perspective of the internal OD 
consultant who was charged with plant start-up 
support.
In 2003, a major U.S. multinational broke ground 
for a new set of factories in the “second tier” 
Chinese city of Chengdu. A city of more than ten 
million people in Western China, Chengdu is 
correctly considered the heartland of Chinese 
culture with a strong tradition of Taoism and a 
relaxed, friendly culture. In contrast, the multi￾national technology company came to western 
China with a strong business-centered, “just get 
results,” U.S. culture. While the organization had 
facilities all over the world, and several in China, 
it had not started-up a true greenfield plant as 
the first MNC in a city in more than ten years. 
In keeping with the firm’s global strategy, the 
corporate headquarters expected each plant to 
integrate seamlessly with other plants in the sup￾ply chain. Low costs and meeting the technical 
specifications of the product were the key meas￾ures of performance.
The first time I saw the factory site in Chengdu 
it was bare dirt with the wind blowing dust over 
what had been a farmer’s field. Even as the build￾ings came out of the ground—an office building, 
one factory and then another, a large warehouse, 
and a training center—the local culture of Chengdu 
was being challenged in the way it thought about 
safety. In China, construction projects have a tra￾ditional algorithm for safety: the millions of Yuan 
(the local currency) spent in construction was 
proportionate to the number of deaths resulting 
from it. This project was different. Not only were 
there no deaths, there were no injuries more seri￾ous than cut fingers. Subcontractors were required 
to wear hard hats, steel-toed shoes, goggles, and 
the like, and not everyone liked it. One subcontrac￾tor walked off the job believing the safety equip￾ment was too burdensome.
About 30 expatriates were brought in to manage the 
site. They were experienced company employees 
from four different cultures: Malaysia, Philippines, 
Costa Rica, and the United States. Most were 
Malaysian; very few were American. The first local 
employees hired were support personnel in human 
resources, accounting, and purchasing. They were 
trained in their jobs in the way that the company 
expected them to work. The first Chinese factory 
workers were part of the Early Involvement Team 
(EIT), and they were sent to another of the com￾pany’s factories to learn the correct processes and 
behaviors necessary to run the production lines. 
When the EIT returned, they were to teach the 
next generation of employees. While this training 
could be considered just learning the job, it was 
also a culture change for people who had never 
worked in a Western high-tech factory. Ramping 
up this factory to production required that we hire 
and integrate 100 to 200 people per month; 70%
of those hired were recent college graduates.
As the OD manager, my job was to set up systems to 
transmit the culture and develop leaders, managers, 
and teams. I began with the site’s Vision, Mission, 
and Guiding Principles. To help the team begin the 
process, I defined the Vision as “the best we could 
be,” the Mission as “our marching orders—what the 
corporation expected of us” and Guiding Principles 
as “how we make decisions and treat each other.” 
We utilized two off-site sessions with the “whole 
system in the room.” Inclusive processes employ￾ing exercises and conversations about what was 
important to people were used to formulate begin￾ning statements. After we had a set of draft state￾ments, I formed small teams of Chinese leaders 
who debated the elements of Vision, Mission, and 
Guiding Principles. The teams came to consensus for 
each statement to ensure that both the English and 
application 23.2CHAPTER 23 Organization Development in Global Settings 633
Chinese words we used reflected Chinese culture 
and spoke in a way that fit the Chinese thought proc￾esses. We unpacked each statement using Chinese 
metaphors to provide depth of meaning. Essentially, 
we were defining the site’s specific culture, which 
while congruent with the corporation, was specific 
to this site and its chosen values. When completed, 
these statements went back to the site leadership for 
ratification. To disseminate the Vision, Mission, and 
Guiding Principles, each leader, whether expatriate 
or local Chinese, took responsibility to waterfall the 
message to their team using dialogues to explore 
the meaning of the statements for the team. It was 
not enough to have posters on the wall, or simply 
tell people what they were. People needed to talk 
through the meaning and come to some conclusion 
for themselves as to their own belief. Additionally, 
people needed to see that leadership practiced what 
they espoused. So, when an important site decision 
was made, its fit with the Guiding Principles was 
publicly communicated. When certain initiatives 
were begun, such as management training, it was 
tied to the site Vision. Only because people could 
see the Vision, Mission, and Guiding Principles in 
practice did they become real.
Before the first building was under construction, I 
came to Chengdu to do the initial cultural research 
for the site. I interviewed university students, busi ness 
leaders, and Chinese cultural experts in Chengdu. I 
found a disparity between how the middle manag￾ers viewed management and leadership and what 
the young, university students wanted in a man￾ager. As this was the first multinational organiza￾tion in Chengdu, most of the middle managers we 
hired were from state-owned enterprises with a 
very top-down, hierarchical culture. The university 
students expected Western-style, consensual deci￾sion-making—a clear mismatch even within the 
Chinese culture. Management training and coach￾ing would be required to help middle managers 
learn to work in a consensual way.
To accomplish that, we engaged the expatriate site 
leaders as teachers and mentors in a nine-month 
management development program that included 
two outdoor “adventure-style” sessions. The first 
program placed the initial outdoor session after four 
months of activities. I found that in the classroom, 
Chinese managers could “talk the talk,” but when 
we put them in the team decision-making situations 
of the outdoor sessions, they were unable to make 
productive decisions. In the second management 
development program, I placed the outdoor ses￾sion earlier so that the Chinese managers would 
understand the required managerial behaviors 
right away. We eventually graduated more than 50 
managers with two-thirds of them receiving pro￾motions within a year of completion.
The organization had a number of key espoused 
values in its culture, including quality, safety, and 
business practice excellence. These were primary 
and nonnegotiable values. While that may seem 
the arbitrary hubris of a foreign multinational, 
I found that the Chinese employees appreciated 
these three values, especially safety. As mentioned 
above, China has a poor record of workplace 
safety. When asked about this value, many people 
responded that “the company cares for my life.” 
Rather than seeing it as an imposition of a foreign 
cultural value, they found it fit the Chinese value 
of renqing or human heartedness.
The company also employed six values as basic to its 
culture. However, these values were really expected 
behaviors, such as discipline, risk taking, and being 
open and direct. In my work in Chengdu, I designed 
and implemented a process to develop those values 
as part of the expected behaviors of the site. I had 
learned that “telling-teaching,” or putting posters 
on the wall, was not very effective in this culture, 
so I engaged a cadre of volunteer “ambassadors” for 
each value. They used a positive approach of catch￾ing people “doing it right” and rewarding them in a 
public ceremony with a “Star of Chengdu Culture” 
award. To create a common understanding of each 
value, we again used an interactive and participative 
process. We provided materials that allowed and 
encouraged every manager to have a conversation 
with their team as to the meaning of that particular 
value. We endeavored to make the materials rele￾vant to a Chinese audience using Chinese stories and 
situations to illustrate the meaning of the value.
However, not all these values fit within Chinese 
culture, and this created cultural dilemmas for 
Chinese employees. Being open and direct was one 
example of a value that did not fit. Generally, the 
organization talked about being open and direct in 
terms of “constructive confrontation,” which the 
Chinese employees shortened to “con con.” In my 
interviews, I found that this value was both the 
most difficult and the least practiced. The Chinese 
employees related con con to a lack of harmony 
rather than a method of solving problems directly 
and easily. It was antithetical to Chinese culture. 634 PART 7 Special Applications of Organization Development
Chinese employees who learned to practice con 
con in the workplace found themselves out of step 
when those behaviors were used with their family 
and friends outside of the factory. Essentially they 
had to bifurcate their life, learning to be one way 
inside the organization and another way outside. 
When I asked people what they lost by coming 
to work at the factory, employees often noted 
that they had lost some friends because they were 
now different from the Chinese culture at large. 
Practicing con con was a big part of that. They also 
told me of many instances in which they appeared 
to the expatriates as though they were practicing 
con con, when in fact they were practicing har￾mony. They felt that harmony was a better long￾term solution to the problem at hand than creating 
a situation in which fellow workers lost “face.” 
They talked about finding a “middle way” to do 
business that allowed problem solving while still 
maintaining harmonious relationships.
If real cultural differences can keep people from 
assimilating into an organization, the question 
be comes, “Did these skilled Chinese workers actu￾ally assimilate into the factory culture, or did they 
simply appear to apply the organization’s value 
system while maintaining traditional Chinese val￾ues?” While much of the work on Values, Mission, 
and Guiding Principles was well accepted and 
understood, the Chinese workers in this situation 
had difficulty placing con con into a usable frame￾work that worked in their social setting because it 
did not align with the Chinese value of harmony. 
Since con con was a foundational behavior/value 
for the company, such a misfit reveals a lack of real 
assimilation into the corporate culture.
Some Chinese lament that China is losing her 
cultural traditions as the country becomes part of 
the global economy. At least in Chengdu, I did not 
find that to be true. People described themselves 
as traditional Chinese who practiced their own 
culture and struggled with those organizational 
processes that did not fit Chinese culture. They 
continued to look for the middle way that allows 
them to maintain their Chinese cultural values 
while moving into a capitalistic future. Just as China 
assimilated Buddhism into their Confucian practices 
millenniums ago, they see the value of assimilating 
some Western practices into their way of doing 
business, but it will still be capitalism with a Chinese 
face—a middle way.
PART 7 Special Applications of Organization Development
and reports to headquarters. This results in a highly differentiated and loosely coordi￾nated corporate structure. Operational decisions, such as product design, manufacturing, 
and distribution, are decentralized and tightly integrated at the local level. For example, 
laundry soap manufacturers offer product formulas, packaging, and marketing strategies 
that conform to the different environmental regulations, types of washing machines, 
water hardness, and distribution channels in each country. On the other hand, planning 
activities are often centralized at corporate headquarters to achieve important efficiencies 
necessary for worldwide coordination of emerging technologies and of resource alloca￾tion. A profit-center control system allows local autonomy as long as profitability is main￾tained. Examples of multinational corporations include Hoechst and BASF of Germany, 
IBM and Procter & Gamble of the United States, and Fuji Xerox of Japan. Each of these 
organizations encourages local subsidiaries to maximize effectiveness within their geo￾graphic region.
People are integrated into multinational firms through polycentric or regiocentric 
personnel policies because these firms believe that host-country nationals can under￾stand native cultures most clearly.43 By filling positions with local citizens who appoint 
and develop their own staffs, the organization aligns the needs of the market with 
the ability of its subsidiaries to produce customized products and services. The distinc￾tion between a polycentric and a regiocentric selection process is one of focus. In a CHAPTER 23 Organization Development in Global Settings 635
polycentric selection policy, a subsidiary represents only one country; in the regiocen￾tric selection policy, a slightly broader perspective is taken and key positions are filled 
by regional citizens (that is, people who might be called Europeans, as opposed to 
Belgians or Italians).
Implementing the Multinational Orientation The decentralized and locally coordi￾nated multinational orientation suggests the need for a complex set of OD interven￾tions. When applied to a subsidiary operating in a particular country or region, the OD 
processes described earlier in the chapter for organizations outside the United States 
are relevant. The key is to tailor OD to fit the specific cultural and economic context 
where the subsidiary is located.
Planned Change in the Multinational Orientation. When OD is applied across dif￾ferent regions and countries, interventions must account for differences in cultural 
and economic conditions that can affect its success. Appropriate interventions for 
multinational corporations include intergroup relations, local management team 
building, sophisticated management selection and development practices, and 
changes to reward systems. Team building remains an important intervention. 
Unlike team building for the senior management team in global orientations, the 
local management teams require attention in multinational firms. This presents a 
challenge for OD practitioners because polycentric selection policies can produce 
management teams with different cultures at each subsidiary. Thus, a program 
developed for one subsidiary may not work with a different team at another sub￾sidiary, given the different cultures that might be represented.
 Intergroup interventions to improve relations between local subsidiaries and the 
parent company are also important for multinational companies. Decentralized deci￾sion making and regiocentric selection can strain corporate–subsidiary relations. Local 
management teams, operating in ways appropriate to their cultural context, may not 
be understood by corporate managers from another culture. OD practitioners can help 
both groups understand these differences by offering training in cultural diversity and 
appreciation. They can also smooth parent–subsidiary relationships by focusing on the 
profit-center control system or other criteria as the means for monitoring and measur￾ing subsidiary effectiveness.
Management selection, development, and reward systems also require special 
attention in multinational firms. Managerial selection for local or regional subsidiar￾ies requires finding technically and managerially competent people who also pos￾sess the interpersonal competence needed to interface with corporate headquarters. 
Because these people may be difficult to find, management development programs 
can teach the necessary cross-cultural skills and abilities. Such programs typically 
involve language, cultural awareness, and technical training; they can also include 
managers and staff from subsidiary and corporate offices to improve communica￾tions between the two areas. Finally, reward systems need to be aligned with the 
decentralized structure. Significant proportions of managers’ total compensation 
could be tied to local profit performance, thereby aligning reward and control sys￾tems.
The Transition to Multinational. Organization development activities can also help 
to facilitate the transition from an international to a multinational orientation. 
Much of the recommended activity in transitioning to a global orientation applies 
here as well, except that it must be customized to the issues facing a multinational 
strategy. For example, the successful transition to a multinational strategy assumes 
that managers believe local responsiveness is more important than global integra￾tion and that the organization is comfortable with the ambiguity of managing 
decentralized operations.
1.
2.636 PART 7 Special Applications of Organization Development
The decision to favor local responsiveness over global integration must be made 
with the same analytic rigor described earlier. In this case, the analysis must sup￾port the belief that the worldwide market is relatively heterogeneous in character. 
That is, that products and services, support, distribution, or marketing activities 
must be customized and localized to drive overall sales. Similarly, the organization 
must have the managerial, technical, and organizational competence to achieve 
profit margins from businesses operating around the globe. The multinational strat￾egy is facilitated when culture and core competencies are more suited for decen￾tralized decision making, and when the organization can manage high amounts of 
ambiguity and complexity.
Once companies develop a strategic orientation for competing internationally, 
they create an organization design to support it. Information like that found in 
Table 23.2 is useful for designing structures, information systems, and personnel 
practices for specific strategic orientations. OD practitioners can help to design 
change management programs to implement these features.
The Transnational Strategic Orientation
This orientation exists when the need for global integration and local responsiveness 
are both high. It represents the most complex and ambitious worldwide strategic ori￾entation and reflects the belief that any product or service can be made anywhere and 
sold everywhere.44
Characteristics of the Transnational Design The transnational strategy combines cus￾tomized products with both efficient and responsive operations; the key goal is learning. 
This is the most complex worldwide strategic orientation because transnationals can 
manufacture products, conduct research, raise capital, buy supplies, and perform many 
other functions wherever in the world the job can be done optimally. They can move 
skills, resources, and knowledge to regions where they are needed.
The transnational orientation combines the best of global and multinational ori￾entations and adds a third attribute—the ability to transfer resources both within the 
firm and across national and cultural boundaries. Otis Elevator, a division of United 
Technologies, developed a new programmable elevator using six research centers in 
five countries: a U.S. group handled the systems integration; Japan designed the special 
motor drives that make the elevators ride smoothly; France perfected the door systems; 
Germany created the electronics; and Spain produced the small-geared components.45
Other examples of transnational firms include General Electric, Asea Brown Boveri 
(ABB), Motorola, Electrolux, and HP.
Transnational firms organize themselves into global matrix and network struc￾tures especially suited for moving information and resources to their best use. In the 
matrix structure, local divisions similar to the multinational structure are crossed 
with product groups at the headquarters office. The network structure treats each 
local office, including headquarters, product groups, and production facilities, as self￾sufficient nodes that coordinate with each other to move knowledge and resources to 
their most valued place. Because of the heavy communication and logistic demands 
needed to operate these structures, transnationals have sophisticated information 
systems. State-of-the-art information technology is used to move strategic and opera￾tional information throughout the system rapidly and efficiently. Organizational 
learning and knowledge management practices (Chapter 21) gather, organize, 
and disseminate the knowledge and skills of members who are located around the 
world.
People are integrated into transnational firms through a geocentric selection policy that 
staffs key positions with the best people, regardless of nationality.46 This staffing practice 
recognizes that the distinctive competence of a transnational firm is its capacity to optimize CHAPTER 23 Organization Development in Global Settings 637
resource allocation on a worldwide basis. Unlike global and multinational firms, which 
spend more time training and developing managers to fit the strategy, the transnational 
firm attempts to hire the right person from the beginning. Recruits at any of HP’s foreign 
locations, for example, are screened not only for technical qualifications but for personality 
traits that match the company’s cultural values.
Implementing the Transnational Orientation There are two perspectives on change in 
a transnational strategy.
Planned Change in the Transnational Orientation. Transnational companies 
require OD interventions that can improve their ability to achieve efficient global 
integration under highly decentralized decision-making conditions. These inter￾ventions include extensive management selection and development practices in 
support of the geocentric policies described above, intergroup relations, and devel￾opment and communication of a strong corporate vision and culture. Knowledge 
management interventions help develop a worldwide repository of information 
that enables members’ learning.
Effective transnational firms have well-developed vision and mission statements 
that communicate the values and beliefs underlying the firm’s culture and guide 
its operational decisions. ABB’s mission statement, for example, went through a 
multicultural rewriting when the company recognized that talking about profit 
was an uncomfortable activity in some cultures.47 OD processes that increase 
member participation in the construction or modification of these statements can 
help members gain ownership of them. Research into the development of corpo￾rate credos at the British computer manufacturer ICL, SAS, and Apple Computer 
showed that success was more a function of the heavy involvement of many 
managers than the quality of the statements themselves.48
Once vision and mission statements are crafted, management training can focus 
on clarifying their meaning, the values they express, and the behaviors required 
to support those values. This process of gaining shared meaning and developing a 
strong culture provides a basis for social control. Because transnationals need flex￾ibility and coordination, they cannot rely solely on formal reports of sales, costs, 
or demand to guide behavior. This information often takes too much time to com￾pile and distribute. Rather, the corporate vision and culture provide transnational 
managers with the reasoning and guidelines for why and how they should make 
decisions.
This form of social control supports OD efforts to improve management selection 
and development, intergroup relationships, and strategic change. The geocentric 
selection process can be supplemented by a personnel policy that rotates managers 
through different geographical regions and functional areas to blend people, per￾spectives, and practices. At such organizations as GE, ABB, Coca-Cola, and Colgate, 
a cadre of managers with extensive foreign experience is being developed. Rotation 
throughout the organization also improves the chances that when two organiza￾tional units must cooperate, key personnel will know each other and make coor￾dination more likely. The corporate vision and culture can also become important 
tools in building cross-functional or interdepartmental processes for transferring 
knowledge, resources, or products. Moreover, they can provide guidelines for 
formulating and implementing strategic change, and serve as a social context for 
designing appropriate structures and systems at local subsidiaries.
The Transition to the Transnational Orientation. In addition to implementing 
planned changes that support the development of the transnational orientation, 
OD can help firms make the complex transition to a transnational strategy. 
Although many firms take on the international orientation, a much smaller 
1.
2.638 PART 7 Special Applications of Organization Development
number of firms are large enough to become global or multinational. The require￾ments for successfully operating a transnational orientation—global integration 
and local responsiveness—are sufficiently restrictive and demanding that only a 
small fraction of organizations should pursue this strategy. As a result, knowledge 
about the transition to transnational is still being developed.
Global and multinational organizations tend to evolve into a transnational 
orientation because of changes in the organization’s environment, markets, or 
technologies.49 In the global orientation, for example, environmental changes can 
challenge the logic of centralized and efficient operations. For example, the success 
of Japanese automobile manufacturers employing a global strategy caused employ￾ment declines in the U.S. auto industry and overall trade imbalances. Consumer 
and government reactions forced Japanese firms to become more responsive to 
local conditions. Conversely, consumer preference changes can reduce the needs 
for tailored products and locally responsive management that are characteristic of 
the multinational strategy. The typical response is to centralize many decisions and 
activities.
Thus, the evolution to a transnational orientation is a complex strategic change 
effort requiring the acquisition of two additional capabilities. First, global organiza￾tions need to learn to trust distant operations, and multinational organizations 
need to become better at coordination. Second, both types of organizations need 
to acquire the ability to transfer resources efficiently around the world. Much of 
the difficulty in evolving to a transnational strategy lies in developing these addi￾tional capabilities.
In the transition from a global to a transnational orientation, the firm must 
acquire the know-how to operate a decentralized organization and learn to transfer 
knowledge, skills, and resources among disparate organizational units operating in 
different countries. In this situation, the administrative challenge is to encourage 
creative over centralized thinking and to let each functional area operate in a way 
that best suits its context. For example, if international markets require increasingly 
specialized products, then manufacturing needs to operate local plants and flexible 
delivery systems that can move raw materials to where they are needed, when they 
are needed. OD interventions that can help this transition include training efforts 
that increase the tolerance for differences in management practices, control systems, 
performance appraisals, and policies and procedures; reward systems that encourage 
entrepreneurship and performance at each foreign subsidiary; and efficient organiza￾tion designs at the local level.
The global orientation strives to achieve efficiency through centralization and 
standardization of products and practices. In the case of organizational systems, 
this works against the establishment of highly specialized and flexible policies 
and resists the movement of knowledge, skills, and resources. Training interven￾tions that help managers develop an appreciation for the different ways that 
effectiveness can be achieved will aid the global organization’s move toward 
transnationalism.
Changes in reward systems can also help the global firm evolve. By changing 
from a highly quantitative, centralized, pay-for-performance system characteristic 
of a global orientation, the organization can reward people who champion new 
ideas and provide incentives for decentralized business units. This more flexible 
reward system promotes coordination among subsidiaries, product lines, and staff 
groups. In addition, the transition to a transnational orientation can be aided by 
OD practitioners working with individual business units, rather than with senior 
management at headquarters. Working with each subsidiary on issues relating to 
its own structure and function sends an important message about the importance 
of decentralized operations.CHAPTER 23 Organization Development in Global Settings 639
Finally, changing the staffing policy is another important signal to organiza￾tion members that a transition is occurring. Under the global orientation, an 
ethnocentric policy supported standardized activities. By staffing key positions 
with the best people, rather than limiting the choice to just parent-country indi￾viduals, the symbols of change are clear and the rewards for supporting the new 
orientation are visible.
In moving from a multinational to a transnational orientation, products, tech￾nologies, and regulatory constraints can become more homogeneous and require 
more efficient operations. The competencies required to compete on a transna￾tional basis, however, may be located in many different geographic areas. The need 
to balance local responsiveness against the need for coordination among organi￾zational units is new to multinational firms. They must create interdependencies 
among organizational units through the flow of parts, components, and finished 
goods; the flow of funds, skills, and other scarce resources; or the flow of intel￾ligence, ideas, and knowledge. For example, as part of Ford’s transition to a trans￾national company, the redesign of the Tempo automobile was given to one person 
in the UK. He coordinated all features of the new car for both sides of the Atlantic 
and used the same platform, engines, and other parts. Ford used teleconferencing 
and computer links, as well as extensive air travel, to manage the complex task of 
meshing car companies on two continents.50
In such situations, OD is an important activity because complex interdepen￾dencies require sophisticated and nontraditional coordinating mechanisms.51 OD 
interventions, such as intergroup team-building or cultural awareness and inter￾personal skills training, can help develop the communication linkages necessary 
for successful coordination. In addition, the inherently “matrixed” structures of 
worldwide firms and the cross-cultural context of doing business in different coun￾tries tend to create conflict. OD interventions, such as role clarification, third-party 
consultation, and mediation techniques, can help to solve such problems.
The transition to a transnational firm is difficult and threatens the status quo. 
Under the multinational orientation, each subsidiary is encouraged and rewarded 
for its creativity and independence. Transnational firms, however, are effective 
when physically or geographically distinct organizational units coordinate their 
activities. The transition from independent to interdependent business units can 
produce conflict as the coordination requirements are worked through. OD practi￾tioners can help mitigate the uncertainty associated with the change by modifying 
reward systems to encourage cooperation and spelling out clearly the behaviors 
required for success.
GLOBAL SOCIAL CHANGE
The newest and perhaps most exciting applications of organization development in 
international settings are occurring in global social change organizations (GSCOs).52
These organizations generally are not for profit and nongovernmental. They typically 
are created at the grassroots level to help communities and societies address such 
important problems as unemployment, race relations, sustainable development, home￾lessness, hunger, disease, and political instability. In international settings, GSCOs are 
heavily involved in the developing nations. Examples include the World Conservation 
Union (IUCN), the Hunger Project, the Nature Conservancy, the Mountain Forum, 
International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War, and the Asian Coalition 
for Agrarian Reform and Rural Development (ANGOC). Many practitioners who help 
create and develop these GSCOs come from an OD background and have adapted their 
expertise to fit highly complex, global situations. This section describes global social 
change organizations and how OD is practiced in them.640 PART 7 Special Applications of Organization Development
Global Social Change Organizations
Global social change organizations are part of a social innovation movement to foster 
the emergence of a global civilization.53 They exist under a variety of names, includ￾ing development organizations (DOs), international nongovernmental organizations 
(INGOs), social movement organizations (SMOs), international private voluntary 
organizations, and bridging organizations.54 They exist to address complex social prob￾lems, including overpopulation, ecological degradation, the increasing concentration of 
wealth and power, the lack of management infrastructures to facilitate growth, and the 
lack of fundamental human rights. The efforts of many GSCOs to raise awareness and 
mobilize resources toward solving these problems culminated in the United Nations’ 
Conference on Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro in June 1992, where 
leaders from both industrialized and less-developed countries met to discuss sustain￾able development.55 More recently, the Kyoto Protocol and the Global Compact have 
focused attention on global warming and social responsibility and how countries and 
organizations can cooperate to address these concerns.
GSCOs have the following characteristics:56
They assert, as their primary task, a commitment to serve as an agent of change in 
creating environmentally and socially sustainable world futures; their transforma￾tional missions are articulated around the real needs of people and the earth.
They have discovered and mobilized innovative social-organizational architectures 
that make possible human cooperation across previously polarizing or arbitrarily 
constraining boundaries.
They hold values of empowerment, or people-centered forms of action, in the 
accomplishment of their global change mission, emphasizing the central role of 
people as both means and ends in any development process.
They are globally and locally linked in structure, membership, or partnership and 
thereby exist, at least in identity and practice (maybe not yet legally), as entities 
beyond the nation-state.
They are multiorganizational and often cross-sectoral. They can be business, gov￾ernmental, or not for profit. Indeed, many of the most significant global change 
organizing innovations involve multiorganization partnerships bridging sectoral 
boundaries in new hybrid forms of business, intergovernmental, and private vol￾untary sectors.
GSCOs therefore differ from traditional for-profit firms on several dimensions.57 First, 
they typically advocate a mission of social change—the formation and development 
of better societies and communities. “Better” typically means more just (Amnesty 
International, Hunger Project), peaceful (International Physicians for the Prevention 
of Nuclear War), or ecologically conscious (Nature Conservancy, the Global Village 
of Beijing, the Mountain Forum, IUCN, World Wildlife Fund). Second, the mission 
is supported by a network structure. Most GSCO activity occurs at the boundary or 
periphery between two or more organizations.58 Unlike most industrial firms that focus 
on internal effectiveness, GSCOs are directed at changing their environmental context. 
For example, World Vision coordinated the efforts of more than a hundred organi￾zations to address the human consequences of Ceausescu’s Romanian government. 
Third, GSCOs generally have strong values and ideologies that justify and motivate 
organization behavior. These “causes” provide intrinsic rewards to GSCO members 
and a blueprint for action.59 The ideological position that basic human rights include 
shelter has directed Habitat for Humanity to erect low-cost homes in a wide variety of 
underdeveloped communities. Fourth, GSCOs interact with a broad range of external 
and often conflicting constituencies. To help the poor, GSCOs often must work with 
•

the rich; to save the ecology, they must work with developers; to empower the masses, 
they must work with the powerful few. This places a great deal of pressure on GSCOs 
to reconcile pursuit of a noble cause with the political reality of power and wealth. 
Fifth, managing these diverse external constituencies often creates significant organi￾zational conflict. On the one hand, GSCOs need to create specific departments to serve 
and represent particular stakeholders. On the other hand, they are strongly averse 
to bureaucracy and desire collegial and consensus- seeking cultures. The conflicting 
perspectives of the stakeholders, the differentiated departments, and the ideological 
basis of the organization’s mission can produce a contentious internal environment. 
For example, the International Relief and Development Agency was created to pro￾mote self-help projects in Third World countries using resources donated from First 
World countries. As the agency grew, departments were created to represent differ￾ent stakeholders: a fund-raising group handled donors, a projects department worked 
in the Third World, a public relations department directed media exposure, and a 
policy information department lobbied the government. Each department adapted 
to fit its role. Fund-raisers and lobbyists dressed more formally, took more moderate 
political positions, and managed less participatively than did the projects departments. 
These differences were often interpreted in political and ideological terms, creating 
considerable internal conflict.60 Sixth, GSCO membership often is transitory. Many 
people are volunteers, and the extent and depth of their involvement varies over time 
and by issue. Turnover is quite high.
Application Stages
Global social change organizations are concerned with creating sustainable change in 
communities and societies. This requires a form of planned change in which the practi￾tioner is heavily involved, many stakeholders are encouraged and expected to participate, 
and “technologies of empowerment” are used. Often referred to as “participatory action 
research,”61 planned change in GSCOs typically involves three types of activities: building 
local organization effectiveness, creating bridges and linkages with other relevant organi￾zations, and developing vertical linkages with policymakers.
Building the Local Organization Although GSCOs are concerned primarily with 
changing their environments, a critical issue in development projects is recognizing 
the potential problems inherent in the GSCO itself. Because the focus of change is 
their environment, members of GSCOs are often oblivious to the need for internal 
development. Moreover, the complex organizational arrangements of a network make 
planned change in GSCOs particularly challenging.
OD practitioners focus on three activities in helping GSCOs build themselves into 
viable organizations: using values to create the vision, recognizing that internal conflict 
is often a function of external conditions, and understanding the problems of success. 
For leadership to function effectively, the broad purposes of the GSCO must be clear 
and closely aligned with the ideologies of its members. Singleness of purpose can be 
gained from tapping into the compelling aspects of the values and principles that the 
GSCO represents. For example, the Latin American Division of the Nature Conservancy 
held annual two-day retreats. Each participant prepared a white paper concerning his 
or her area of responsibility: the issues, challenges, major dilemmas or problems, and 
ideas for directions the division could take. Over the course of the retreat, participants 
actively discussed each paper. They had broad freedom to challenge the status quo 
and to question previous decisions. By the end of the retreat, discussions produced a 
clear statement about the course that the division would take for the following year. 
People left with increased clarity about and commitment to the purpose and vision of 
the division.62642 PART 7 Special Applications of Organization Development
Developing a shared vision can align individual and organizational values. Because 
most activities occur at the boundary of the organization, members are often spread 
out geographically and are not in communication with each other. A clearly crafted 
vision allows people in disparate regions and positions to coordinate their activities. 
At the Hunger Project, for example, OD practitioners asked organization members, 
“What is your job or task in this organization?” The GSCO president responded, “That 
is simple. My work is to make the end of hunger an idea whose time has come.” A 
receptionist answered, “My task in this organization is to end hunger. I don’t just 
answer phones or set up meetings. In everything I do, I am working to end hunger.”63
Because of the diverse perspectives of the different stakeholders, GSCOs often face 
multiple conflicts. In working through them, the organizational vision can be used as 
an important rallying point for discovering how each person’s role contributes to the 
GSCO’s purpose. The affective component of a GSCO vision gives purpose to members’ 
lives and work.
Another way to manage conflict is to prevent its occurrence. At the Hunger Project, 
the “committed listener” and “breakthrough” processes give GSCO members an oppor￾tunity to seek help before conflict becomes dysfunctional. Every member of the organi￾zation has a designated person who acts as a committed listener. When things are not 
going well, or someone is feeling frustrated in their ability to accomplish a goal, they can 
talk it out with this colleague. The role of the committed listener is to listen intently, to 
help the individual understand the issues, and to think about framing or approaching 
the problem in new ways. This new perspective is called a “breakthrough”—a creative 
solution to a potentially conflictual situation.
Finally, a GSCO’s success can create a number of problems. The very accomplish￾ment of its mission can take away its reason for existence, thus causing an identity 
crisis. For example, a GSCO that succeeds in creating jobs for underprivileged youth 
can be dissolved because its funding is redirected toward organizations that have not 
yet met their goals, because its goals change, or simply because it has accomplished its 
purpose. During these times, the vital social role that these organizations play needs to 
be emphasized. GSCOs often represent bridges between the powerful and powerless, 
between the rich and poor, and between the elite and oppressed, and as such may need 
to be maintained as legitimate parts of the community.
Another problem can occur when GSCO success produces additional demands for 
greater formalization. New people must be hired and acculturated; greater control 
over income and expenditures has to be developed; new skills and behaviors have 
to be learned. The need for more formal systems often runs counter to ideological 
principles of autonomy and freedom and can produce a profound resistance to change. 
Employees’ participation during diagnosis and implementation can help them com￾mit to the new systems. In addition, new employment opportunities, increased job 
responsibilities, and improved capabilities to carry out the GSCO’s mission can be used 
to encourage commitment and reduce resistance to the changes.
Alternatively, the organization can maintain its autonomy through structural 
arrangements. The Savings Development Movement (SDM) of Zimbabwe was a 
grassroots effort to organize savings clubs, the proceeds of which helped farmers 
buy seed in volume. Its success in creating clubs and helping farmers lower their 
costs caused the organization to grow very rapidly. Leaders chose to expand SDM 
not by adding staff but by working with the Ministry of Agriculture to provide tech￾nical support to the clubs and with the Ministry of Community Development and 
Women’s Affairs to provide training. The savings clubs remained autonomous and 
locally managed. This reduced the need for formal systems to coordinate the clubs 
with government agencies. The SDM office staff did not grow, but the organization 
remained a catalyst, committed to expanding participation rather than providing 
direct services.64CHAPTER 23 Organization Development in Global Settings 643
Creating Horizontal Linkages Successful social change projects often require a net￾work of local organizations with similar views and objectives. Such projects as creating 
a civil society in China, turning responsibility for maintenance and control over small 
irrigation systems to local water users in Indonesia, or teaching leadership skills in 
South Africa require that multiple organizations interact. Consequently, an important 
planned change activity in GSCOs is creating strong horizontal linkages to organiza￾tions in the community or society where the development project is taking place. 
The China Brief (http://www.chinadevelopmentbrief.com), for example, publishes a 
newsletter describing the activities of different NGOs focused on environmental, child 
welfare, and other issues. Like-minded NGOs can then contact each other and support 
common interests. Similarly, GSCOs aimed at job development not only must recruit, 
train, and market potential job applicants but also must develop relationships with 
local job providers and government authorities. The GSCO must help these organiza￾tions commit to the GSCO’s vision, mobilize resources, and create policies to support 
development efforts.
The ability of GSCOs to sustain themselves depends on establishing linkages with 
other organizations whose cooperation is essential to preserving and expanding their 
efforts. Unfortunately, members of GSCOs often view local government officials, 
community leaders, or for-profit organizations as part of the problem. Rather than 
interacting with these stakeholders, GSCOs often “protect” themselves and their ide￾ologies from contamination by these outsiders. Planned change efforts to overcome 
this myopia are similar to the transorganizational development interventions discussed 
in Chapter 2. GSCO members are helped to identify, convene, and organize these key 
external organizations. For example, following the earthquakes in Mexico City in 1985, 
the Committee of Earthquake Victims was established to prevent the government and 
landlords from evicting low-income tenants from their destroyed housing. The com￾mittee formed relationships with other GSCOs concerned with organizing the poor 
or with responding to the disaster. The committee also linked up with local churches, 
universities, charitable organizations, and poor urban neighborhood organizations. 
It bargained with the government and appealed to the media to scuttle attempts at 
widespread eviction proceedings. This pressure culminated in agreement around a set 
of principles for reconstruction in Mexico City.65
Developing Vertical Linkages GSCOs also must create channels of communication 
and influence upward to governmental and policy-level decision-making processes. 
These higher-level decisions often affect the creation and eventual success of GSCO 
activities. For example, the Global Village of Beijing (GVB) is a nongovernmental 
organization that raises the environmental consciousness of people in China. GVB 
leveraged its relationships with journalists and the government to produce a weekly 
television series on government channels to discuss and promote environmentally 
friendly practices, such as recycling, and to expose the Chinese people to environmen￾tal projects in different countries. When the Chinese government proposed new envi￾ronmental regulations and policies as part of the World Trade Organization admission 
process, GVB helped assess the proposals.66 More recently, GVB’s founder, Liao Xiaoyi, 
sat on Beijing’s successful 2008 summer Olympics Committee and drafted a “green 
Olympics movement” proposal that addressed concerns about Beijing’s pollution.67
Vertical linkages can also be developed by building on a strong record of success. 
The Institute of Cultural Affairs (ICA) is concerned with the “application of methods 
of human development to communities and organizations all around the world.” With 
more than 100 offices in 39 nations, ICA trains and consults with small groups, com￾munities, organizations, and voluntary associations, in addition to providing leadership 
training for village leaders, conducting community education programs, and running 
ecological preservation projects. Its reputation has led to recognition and credibility: 644 PART 7 Special Applications of Organization Development
It was given consultative status by the United Nations in 1985, and it has category II 
status with the Food and Agriculture Organization, working relation status with the 
World Health Organization, and consultative status with UNICEF.
Application 23.3 describes the work of Floresta and gives a brief account of how the 
organization operates, including the process of change and development.68 The opening 
of Floresta’s Mexico program provides important clues about the development of vertical 
and horizontal linkages and how GSCOs work within a clear vision.
Change Agent Roles and Skills
Planned change in global social change organizations is a relatively new application 
of organization development in international settings. The number of practitioners is 
small but growing, and the skills and knowledge necessary to carry out OD in these 
situations are being developed. The grassroots, political, and ideological natures of 
many international GSCOs require change agent roles and skills that are quite different 
from those in more formal, domestic settings.69 GSCO change agents typically occupy 
stewardship and bridging roles. The steward role derives from the ideological and grass￾roots activities associated with GSCOs. It asks the change agent to be a co-learner or 
co-participant in achieving global social change. This type of change is “sustainable,” 
or ecologically, politically, culturally, and economically balanced. Change agents must, 
therefore, work from an explicit value base that is aligned with GSCO activities. For 
example, change agents are not usually asked, “What are your credentials to carry out 
this project?” Instead, practitioners are asked, “Do you share our values?” or “What do 
you think of the plight of the people we are serving?” Stewardship implies an orienta￾tion toward the development of sustainable solutions to local and global problems.
The second role, bridging, derives from the grassroots and political activities of many 
GSCOs. Bridging is an appropriate title for this role because it metaphorically reflects 
the core activities of GSCOs and the change agents who work with them. Both are 
mainly concerned with connecting and integrating diverse elements of societies and 
communities toward sustainable change, and with transferring ideas among individu￾als, groups, organizations, and societies.
Carrying out the steward and the bridging roles requires communication, negotiation, 
and networking skills. Communication and negotiation skills are essential for GSCO 
change agents because of the asymmetrical power bases extant in grassroots develop￾ment efforts. GSCOs are relatively powerless compared with governments, wealthy 
upper classes, and formal organizations. Given the diverse social systems involved, there 
often is no consensus about a GSCO’s objectives. Moreover, different constituencies may 
have different interests, and there may be histories of antagonism among groups that 
make promulgation of the development project difficult. The steward and the bridging 
roles require persuasive articulation of the GSCO’s ideology and purpose at all times, 
under many conditions, and to everyone involved.
The change agent must also be adept at political compromise and negotiation.70
Asymmetrical power contexts represent strong challenges for stewardship and bridging. 
To accomplish sustainable change, important trade-offs often are necessary. The effec￾tive change agent needs to understand the elements of the ideology that can and cannot 
be sacrificed and when to fight or walk away from a situation.
Networking skills represent a significant part of the action research process as applied 
in GSCO settings. Networking takes place at two levels. First, in the steward role, prac￾titioners bring to the GSCO specific knowledge of problem solving, technologies of 
empowerment using processes that socially construct and make sense of the surrounding 
conditions, and organization design.71 The participants bring local knowledge of political 
players, history, culture, and ecology. A “cogenerative dialogue” or “collective reflection” 
process emerges when these two frames of reference interact to produce new ideas, Social and Environmental Change at Floresta
application 23.3
Floresta is a nongovernmental organization founded 
on the premise that many environmental and social 
problems can be addressed effectively by harnessing 
basic economic forces. Its mission is to attack the 
economic problems in developing countries that 
cause and are caused by deforestation. Deforestation 
can be stemmed if it is economically advantageous 
for people to change their practices and take care 
of their environment. Similarly, poverty can be 
addressed optimally by providing long-term oppor￾tunities for people to change their own situations.
Floresta brings hope and long-term opportunity 
to the people affected by these problems through 
technically appropriate, business-based programs 
that lead to self-sufficiency. This fundamental 
vision has remained unchanged for 17 years.
Originally developed to meet the environmental, 
economic, and spiritual needs of the rural people 
of the Dominican Republic, Floresta provides local 
farmers with a loan of several thousand dollars each 
over a seven-year period through the Agroforestry 
Revolving Loan Fund. These loans are used to estab￾lish agroforests consisting of fast-growing trees that 
are harvested for wood products, as well as fruit 
trees and more traditional short-term crops. The 
loans are not a handout. The farmers begin to pay 
back their loans with their first tree harvest. That 
money is used to enter more farmers in the program. 
This process offers significant economic gains to the 
farmers (often up to a 500% or 600% increase in
income) while healing environmental scars.
Although the loan fund is the heart of Floresta’s 
program, farmers also receive technical training 
and marketing assistance. For example, agrofor￾estry is different from traditional farming, and 
involves much more than simply planting trees. 
Each farmer must learn to plant, care for, and 
eventually harvest his or her trees in a sustain￾able manner. In addition, farmers receive training 
in soil care, harvesting, and marketing as well as 
financial planning assistance for the first surplus 
money they earn. Finally, a common problem 
faced by subsistence farmers is market access. The 
individual beneficiary must have not only a mar￾ket for his or her products but also an economical 
way to get those products to that market. Floresta 
provides services in both of those areas.
More than 300 families have benefited or are 
benefiting from Floresta’s program in the Dominican 
Republic. Of these, 20 have completed repayment of 
their loans and now have self-sufficient, 6-acre 
agroforestry farms that are producing at several 
times the rate of their former subsistence farms. 
They no longer have any obligation to Floresta, and 
the money that was loaned to them is now available 
to other needy farmers. The farmers, however, fre￾quently are eager to continue their relationship with 
Floresta because of Floresta’s marketing services and 
the community spirit that Floresta engenders. The 
farmers’ achievements validate the Floresta model, 
supporting it with real-life success.
Scott Sabin, executive director of Floresta, 
described his approach to social and environ￾mental change as he brought the program into 
Mexico:
I first met the people in the Mixtec village of 
El Oro in 1996, and for the past year our team 
had been working closely with them to diag￾nose some of the economic and environmen￾tal problems of the region, and to begin to 
develop solutions. We have become quite 
comfortable with many of the local people and 
several of them typically accompany us as we 
visit some of the other villages in the munici￾pality of Santo Domingo Nuxaa. The make up 
of the team varies, but usually consists of rep￾resentatives from AMEXTRA, government 
forestry offices, local municipalities, and sev￾eral other consultants. I represent Floresta. 
Over the past two years and many visits, we 
had built up quite a feeling of camaraderie.
Floresta partnered with the Mexican agency, 
AMEXTRA, to bring this team together and 
to ensure that Floresta’s agroforestry pro￾gram in Oaxaca would be well thought out 
and appropriate. Floresta has considerable 
experience in the Dominican Republic, but 
the mountains of Mexico are completely dif￾ferent ecologically, economically, and cultur￾ally. It is a big mistake to assume that the 
identical solution can work everywhere.
Working with the people of El Oro, we 
studied the local problems from both the 646 PART 7 Special Applications of Organization Development
possibilities, and insights.72 When both the practitioner and the participants contribute to 
sustainable solutions, the stewardship role is satisfied.
Second, in the bridging role, networking skills create conditions that enable diverse 
stakeholders to interact and solve common problems or address common issues. 
Change agents must be able to find common ground so that different constituencies 
can work together. Networking requires the capability to tap multiple sources of infor￾mation and perspective, often located in very different constituencies. Action becomes 
possible through these networks.
But bridging also implies making linkages among individual, group, GSCO, and 
social levels of thought. Ideas are powerful fuel in international grassroots develop￾ment projects. Breakthrough thinking by individuals to see things in new ways can 
provide the impetus for change at the group, GSCO, social, and global levels. This was 
community and technical perspectives. We 
worked to incorporate the community itself 
into the data collection and the investiga￾tion. For example, the Mixtec people tend 
to be cautious around outsiders. They also 
tend to be very communal, and every step 
along the way they voted as to whether or 
not they wished to continue working with 
us. So far we have passed all the votes 
unanimously, but stories of other develop￾ment workers who had not been so fortu￾nate always made me uneasy. Now we are 
working on implementing solutions and 
with promoters from El Oro, sharing these 
ideas with other communities.
Firewood and charcoal are the biggest sources 
of income for most of the villages. For example, 
I once observed and interviewed five family 
members, ranging in age from the mid-60s to 
6, making charcoal. It was the primary source 
of income for the family. They had crops, too, 
but in years when there was drought, they 
were forced to rely more on charcoal. They 
were able to sell 25-kilogram bags of charcoal 
for 14 pesos a bag, or less than two dollars 
each. They made 30 bags of charcoal at a time 
and they did it about three times a year. 
Roughly calculated, this family of five subsisted 
on about 160 dollars per year.
The problem faced by the family is one of pov￾erty, and tragically, the solution that they have 
chosen, the only solution they can choose, is 
leading toward their own ultimate demise and 
the destruction of the mountains around 
them. That is, an important cause of defores￾tation in the tropics is the subsistence farmer 
who must continually move to find fertile soil 
and who sells wood for fuel. Deforestation is a 
product of desperation and hunger, rather 
than of greed. Farmers are faced daily with the 
need to cut trees for their immediate survival. 
It quickly becomes a vicious cycle, as the tree￾less hillsides erode at an alarming rate and the 
topsoil pollutes rivers and streams. Without 
vegetation, the hills no longer hold water and 
quickly become unproductive. Rural families 
are often left with no alternative but migra￾tion to overcrowded cities. Any solution to 
deforestation must address their needs first.
In the Mixteca, Floresta has helped the com￾munity of El Oro to establish nine agroforestry 
demonstration farms, a community tree nursery, 
and an Agroforestry Development Committee. It 
is also establishing connections between the local 
church and churches in the United States. A saw￾mill and community-based reforestation and forest 
management plan is being implemented. This will 
replace the concessions that currently are being 
sold to large logging companies. Together with the 
Mixtec people, who already realize the precari￾ous nature of the situation, Floresta is helping to 
diversify and improve the rural economy.CHAPTER 23 Organization Development in Global Settings 647
demonstrated by U2’s Bono and U.S. Treasury secretary Paul O’Neill during their 2002 
visit to understand and develop solutions to poverty in Africa. The change agent in 
international GSCO settings must play a variety of roles and use many skills. Clearly, 
stewardship and bridging roles are important in facilitating GSCO accomplishment. 
Other roles and skills will likely emerge over time. Change agents, for example, are 
finding it increasingly important to develop “imaginal literacy” skills—the ability to 
see the possibilities, rather than the constraints, and the ability to develop sustainable 
solutions by going outside the boxes to create new ideas.73
SUMMARY
This chapter has examined the practice of international organization development in 
three areas. In organizations outside the United States, traditional approaches to OD 
need to be adapted to fit the cultural and economic development context in which 
they are applied. This adaptation approach recognizes that OD practices may be 
culture-bound: What works in one culture may be inappropriate in another. The cul￾tural contexts of different geographical regions were examined in terms of five values: 
context orientation, power distance, uncertainty avoidance, achievement orientation, 
and individualism. This approach also recognizes that not all OD interventions may be 
appropriate. The prevailing economic situation may strongly favor business-oriented 
over process-oriented interventions. The process of OD under different cultural and 
economic conditions was also described, although the descriptions are tentative. As OD 
matures, its methods will become more differentiated and adaptable.
OD activities to improve international, global, multinational, and transnational 
strategic orientations increasingly are in demand. Each of these strategies responds 
to specific environmental, technological, and economic conditions. Interventions in 
worldwide organizations require a strategic and organizational perspective on change 
to align people, structures, and systems.
Finally, the OD process in global social change organizations was discussed. This 
relatively new application of OD promotes the establishment of a global civiliza￾tion. Strong ideological positions regarding the fair and just distribution of wealth, 
resources, and power fuel this movement. By strengthening local organizations, 
building horizontal linkages with other like-minded GSCOs, and developing vertical 
linkages with policy-making organizations, a change agent can help the GSCO become 
more effective and alter its external context. To support roles of stewardship and 
bridging, change agents need communication, negotiation, and networking skills.

Organization Development
in Nonindustrial Settings: Health Care, 
School Systems, the Public Sector, 
and Family-Owned Businesses
Organization development may be practiced 
in various types of organizations in both 
the private and the public sectors. In recent 
years, we have also seen growing applica￾tions of OD in service industries as this entire 
sector continues to grow. Historically, most 
published material on OD has focused on 
applications in industrial and manufacturing 
organizations. There is some evidence that 
traditional applications of OD may need to be 
modified if they are to extend beyond the nar￾row industrial model. However, it is likely true 
that applications of OD need to be modified 
in order to be extended into any new industry 
or unique organizational setting or situation.
This chapter presents broad applications of 
OD in nonindustrial settings. In previous edi￾tions of this book, a person with knowledge 
and experience in OD in a particular kind of 
organization was asked to contribute a section 
for this chapter. For this edition, we requested 
Jean Ann Larson, chief learning officer at 
Beaumont Hospitals in metro Detroit, to exam￾ine OD in health care. Linda Purrington and Paul 
Sparks from Pepperdine University’s Graduate 
School of Education and Psychology agreed to 
describe how OD is applied in school systems. 
Ray Patchett and Val Brown from the City of 
Carlsbad, California, discuss OD applications 
in the public sector, and Otis Baskin, profes￾sor of management at Pepperdine University’s 
Graziadio School of Business and Management, 
reports on OD in family businesses. Each 
author stresses the similarities and differences 
between how OD is traditionally practiced in 
industrial organizations and how it applies in 
these nonindustrial settings. Their conclusions 
suggest the need for a greater diversity of diag￾nostic methods, interventions, and values when 
using OD in nonindustrial environments.
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT IN HEALTH CARE*
Health care is a dynamic and complex industry experiencing significant growth and 
change. In 2006, health care expenditures accounted for 16% of GDP in the United States 
as compared to about 9% of GDP in other Organization for Economic Development 
(OECD) countries. In addition to having one of the highest percentages of GDP, the U.S. 
annual rate of increase is almost double that of most developed nations. These expendi￾tures are also highly concentrated. For example, in the United States, a small population 
* Written by Jean Ann Larson, chief learning officer at Beaumont Hospitals in metro Detroit.652 PART 7 Special Applications of Organization Development
bears a disproportionately high share of health care expenses; about 5% of health care 
spenders account for almost half the health care spending.
The debates affecting the eventual definition of care, care delivery, financing, and 
access to care are being held in the halls of Congress and in the boardrooms of large 
and small employers, and found in the countless daily interactions between care 
providers and those they serve. In August of 2007, the Kaiser Family Foundation’s 
Health Tracking Poll asked respondents to select two most important issues for the 
government to address. Health care was the second most cited issue at 27% just after 
the Iraq war.1
The health care industry represents a challenging context within which to practice 
OD. For example, compared to other industries, such as software development, manu￾facturing, or retail, health care differs along several dimensions:
Though it is beginning to change, consumers are often insulated from the economic 
consequences of their major health care decisions, including lifestyle choices, health 
habits, which hospital to go to, and where to get outpatient services. Access to the 
health care system and the cost of care are mostly determined by insurance provided 
through Medicare (a federally funded program for the elderly and disabled), Medicaid 
(a combined federal/state-funded program for the poor), or private insurance, the 
majority of which is provided through employers.
The key providers of care are not all connected through an employment agreement. 
The hospital or any other setting where care is delivered does not typically employ the 
physician. Rather, most caregivers, with the exception of certain specialties, such as 
radiology, clinical pathology, or emergency medicine, have to apply for “privileges” to 
work at a hospital or any other care setting. Physicians often do not exclusively work 
at one hospital or outpatient facility. They behave more as independent businessper￾sons. In some cases, they compete directly with hospitals, clinics, and other outpatient 
facilities for patients and revenues.
Hospitals, a key component of the health care system, are primarily not for profit 
and face several challenges related to their ability to create sustainable revenue to 
support operations. They are heavily regulated by government and dependent on 
it for their revenue base. For example, Medicare accounts for an average of 38% of 
hospital revenues, while Medicaid accounts for an additional 13%. In some rural 
areas, Medicare and Medicaid account for almost 70% of hospital revenues, effec￾tively serving as the national health insurance plan.
In addition, the law requires hospitals to care for all patients regardless of their abil￾ity to pay, prompting the need to grow revenue in other areas. Hospitals are subject 
to fines if they do not serve these patients, and they are paid a set fee, regardless of 
the costs incurred in treating the patients.
Moreover, demand often outstrips facility capacity in many geographical areas and 
medical specialties. In many states, capital expenditures are often regulated by 
Certificate of Need (CON) laws, so even if the organization has the capital, additional 
capacity cannot be provided easily or quickly. This situation results in angry com￾munities and physicians as patients must survive long waits in hallways for available 
beds, or ambulances are deferred due to overcrowding.
Trends in Health Care
Health care practitioners and leaders acknowledge several important trends. The trends 
include the erosion of comprehensive health insurance and access to care, movement 
toward the electronic medical record, the stabilization of physician–hospital relation￾ships, a growing reliance on philanthropy, employer support of consumer-directed 
health care, the loss of baby-boomer caregivers and managers, increased need to manage 
•

•CHAPTER 24 Organization Development in Nonindustrial Settings 653
new clinical technology, and quality as a strategic and regulatory imperative. Many of 
these trends affect not only the health care industry but also society as a whole.
Erosion of Comprehensive Health Insurance and Access to Care The United States is 
the only major industrialized country without universal health care. Despite its wealth 
and commitment of 16% of the gross domestic product to health care—twice the per 
capita spending of the typical industrialized nation—almost 47 million Americans do 
not have health insurance coverage.2
 The consequences of gaps in health insurance 
in the market-driven health system are becoming clear. A recent scorecard on the 
U.S. health care system finds that access, quality, and efficiency are intricately linked.3
Failure to ensure stable universal participation in the health care system leads to avoid￾able deaths, missed opportunities to prevent disease and complications, lost economic 
productivity, and high administrative costs.4
 A recent article in the Wall Street Journal
tells the tragic story of a woman diagnosed with breast cancer who fell through all the 
cracks, and even with safe guards for those without financial means, was unable to get 
the care her disease required. Many physicians who reviewed her story felt that under 
better circumstances and adequate health care insurance coverage, it is likely that she 
would still be alive today, or at least would not have experienced such suffering at the 
end of her life. The story evoked passionate editorials about a system that lets some￾thing like this happen.5
Moving Toward the Electronic Medical Record Health care providers are challenged 
to continuously improve the productivity of their processes and practices, even as they 
are required to spend more time documenting and reporting on the care they deliver. 
They must effectively and efficiently meet the often- conflicting demands of payers, reg￾ulators, and patients. These pressures affect not only the way providers use their time, 
but also their financial health and their ability to deliver high-quality health care.
Given this complex environment, the promise of the electronic medical record (EMR) 
is being touted as a big part of the solution. The EMR concept is simple— everyone who 
is treated by a health care provider has their medical history entered into an electronic 
database that can be transferred to any location whenever the patient needs care. The 
initial expectations of such a system are also simple. With easier access, less manual 
transcription of information, and more clinical information at the point of care, there 
should be significant reductions in health care costs and increased patient safety and 
outcomes. Less visible at first, but equally significant, are the elimination of potential 
duplicate tests and the opportunities for more accurate coding, improved clinical pro￾ductivity, and more complete clinical documentation.6
The Stabilization of Physician–Hospital Relationships Changes in the health care 
industry, such as lower reimbursements and newer less-invasive technologies, are 
causing a significant amount of anxiety among physicians and health care leaders 
because these changes affect where and how physicians deliver services. For example, 
as diagnostic equipment gets smaller and easier to use, it is easier for physicians to 
provide these modalities in their offices instead of in the hospital. At the same time, 
the reimbursements for these advanced technologies are getting smaller, reducing the 
profitability of providing the service in any venue. In addition, these changes will con￾tinue to put pressures on the often-already-strained relationships between physicians 
and hospitals.7 For the past ten years, reimbursement methodologies have pitted hos￾pitals and doctors against each other, often shifting income from one group to another 
because of the overall decline in federal and state health-spending budgets. In some 
cases, in order to hold state budgets constant, not only is money moved out of health 
care, even the dollars remaining in health care are shifted between physicians and hos￾pitals from one year to the next. For example, one year, the hospitals are reimbursed 
at a higher rate at the expense of physicians’ payment (that is, physicians receiving 654 PART 7 Special Applications of Organization Development
a reduced rate of payment), while the following budget cycle reverses the relative 
fortunes of physicians and hospitals. In the next decade, however, the imbalance of 
payments to hospitals and physicians that has affected the social contract between 
physicians and hospitals will begin to stabilize. Physicians will choose to invest with 
hospitals in joint-venture projects in which each will have opportunities to participate 
and to make management decisions. Win–win outcomes are possible as each side will 
have an ownership interest.8
A Growing Reliance on Philanthropy Health care philanthropy is undergoing signifi￾cant change as the health care field faces two defining challenges: the increasing reliance 
of hospitals on philanthropy to address capital shortfalls and the heightened scrutiny 
not-for-profit hospitals are encountering regarding their tax-exempt status. Hospitals are 
increasingly depending on philanthropy to address declining operating margins, needed 
capital improvements, and the lack of understanding among local communities, the 
press, and politicians. To survive in this environment, successful development officers, 
chief executive officers, and chief financial officers are redefining the role of philanthropy 
in the hospital–foundation relationship. In short, they are counting on philanthropy to 
cover more and more capital expenditures.9
Employer Support of Consumer-Directed Health care The costs of the U.S. health 
care system are increasing annually at nearly twice the rate of overall inflation, 
and there is little evidence that this trend will decline. Health care expenditures are 
expected to reach 20% of gross domestic product by 2015. Employers are understand￾ably concerned about these ever-rising costs.10 Increased cost-sharing is one of the 
most common actions that employers have taken to control costs and give employees 
and their dependents a financial stake in health care decisions. Respondents to the 
“Futurescan” survey agreed almost unanimously (98%) that employers will continue 
down this path.11
Employers increasingly believe that new health plans, such as consumer-directed 
health plans that encourage preventive care and require employees to share the costs 
of their health care decisions, can be an antidote to consumers with unlimited wants, 
including those who seek medical solutions to poor lifestyle choices. Employers will con￾tinue to support initiatives aimed at empowering consumers. Gone are the days when 
patients expected the physician to make all the decisions in their care. This is one of the 
reasons employers are pushing health care providers, insurers, and government officials 
to make cost and quality information available to the public.12 In addition, major payers 
are threatening to not pay for negative outcomes caused to patients by their hospital 
stay, such as nosocomial infections, falls, and issues resulting from medical errors.
The Loss of Baby-Boomer Caregivers and Managers Despite the wide prevalence of 
obesity, baby boomers as a generation are healthier than their parents or grandparents. 
They are likely to continue or even accelerate the 25-year-long trend of declining mor￾bidity among people over 65, which Kenneth Manton and others have documented.13
The current U.S. health care system is powered by baby boomers. The average age of 
registered nurses in the United States is 47.14 Some 38% of physicians are over 50.15 The 
entire senior-management cadre of most hospitals and health systems are older boom￾ers. Most baby-boom caregivers will have moved out of direct care provision before the 
wave of boomer-driven health care demand arrives on hospital doorsteps. Though their 
retirement plans may be difficult to pin down, baby-boom caregivers and managers are 
already looking for less stressful work than manning hospital ORs, ICUs, and ERs, and 
being on call 24 hours a day.16 The resolution of this mismatch between health services 
demand and supply of professionals, technicians, and managers from this genera￾tion will determine not only its future economic health, but also, and more crucially, 
whether it can meet the demands of an aging population when they do arrive.CHAPTER 24 Organization Development in Nonindustrial Settings 655
Increased Need to Manage New Clinical Technology The introduction and use 
of new technology has accounted for 20–40% of the annual rise in U.S. health care 
spending since 1960.17 Clinical technology is commonly cited as the major driver of 
rising expenditures worldwide. Observers and researchers characterize this trend as the 
technological imperative: patients and their physicians demand, in the name of quality, 
access to the latest equipment and procedures and, for the most part, third-party pay￾ers are willing to foot the bill. Research suggests that this increased spending over the 
last part of the twentieth century has provided reasonable value measured in terms of 
increased life expectancy.18 However, because of the rising costs of the new products 
and the failure of Medicare reimbursement to keep up with those costs, the presence 
of clinical technology can result in breakeven operations if not losses for health care 
providers.
Quality as a Strategic and Regulatory Imperative Recent reports on the state of 
the health care system suggest that over the last five years, and despite the tech￾nological imperative, we have gained very little in the areas of quality and safety. 
Far too often, patients are harmed by negligent care and avoidable medical errors. 
Among 19 industrialized countries, the United States ranked 15th on “mortality from 
conditions amenable to health care”, which is defined as deaths before 75 that are 
potentially preventable with timely, effective care. At the same time, the estimated 
number of deaths due to medical errors appears to be even higher than originally 
reported in the Institute of Medicines galvanizing report To Err is Human.19 The typical 
adult has about a 50–50 chance of receiving recommended medical care.20 Minorities 
receive lower-quality care for both routine medical care and specialty care, even after 
adjusting for differences in insurance status and income level.21
Many payers, policy makers, and health care leaders are beginning to address the 
situation and are putting in place the building blocks necessary to mobilize and sustain 
change. Medicare now entices almost every hospital in the nation to publicly report 
data on clinical quality by tying a 0.4% payment increase to participation in reporting. 
Pay-for-performance has become an accepted and widely adopted strategy to align 
incentives to reduce costs and improve quality of care.22
Opportunities for Organization Development Practice
Despite, or some might say, because of, the significant negative and difficult trends fac￾ing the industry, OD practitioners can positively influence the process and outcomes 
of change in the health care environment. The opportunities include creating effec￾tive cultures; supporting and developing present and future leaders; creating systems 
and services that cost-effectively differentiate and meet needs; redesigning jobs and 
processes to maximize effective use of expertise; and restoring trust in and among 
stakeholders.
Creating Effective Cultures The past decade’s focus on mergers and alliances still 
requires some cultural integration, human systems development, and work process 
improvement. However, the focus now needs to shift to creating effective cultures that 
attract and retain key stakeholders, engage employees, and promote patient safety. The 
workforce shortages and the need to restore trust prompt the need for attention to 
cultures that welcome, support, and engage commitment from all stakeholders. Health 
systems that enable consumers, physicians, and employees to feel a sense of belonging 
and trust will achieve a sustainable competitive advantage. Alignment of recruitment, 
orientation, performance management, and other systems with the culture will be 
critical to success.
Recent articles about the workforce challenges cite the importance of attention to 
culture. An American Hospital Association (AHA) commission studying the workforce 656 PART 7 Special Applications of Organization Development
issue suggested that culture changes and fostering meaningful work are as important as 
compensation for the long term.23 Ideas for making the best of scarce resources include 
creation of mid-level professionals and increasing teamwork designs. Recommendations 
from the landmark “Magnet Hospital” study of the 1980s by the American Academy of 
Nursing, which outlined approaches that successful hospitals were using to serve as a 
“magnet” to attract and retain qualified nurses, are being cited as relevant and needed 
today. All but two relate to opportunities for OD, including the following:
A philosophy of caring from top management that pervades the patient care 
environment
Leaders who are visible and accessible
Participatory management with practicing nurses engaged in decision making at the 
unit, departmental, and hospital levels
Directors that interact frequently with nursing staff one-on-one
Quality improvement programs that identify and resolve problem situations
Nursing administration that recognizes the autonomy of the professional nurse
Leadership that encourages the nurses in their continuing self-development.24
Cultivating a culture of openness and learning, as opposed to blame, is important for 
addressing the increased focus on patient safety and quality. All caregivers need to 
feel encouraged to raise quality and safety problems, and to find appropriate solutions 
to preserve patient safety, without inadvertently devastating well-meaning caregivers 
and losing the opportunity to learn and to improve processes.
High-Quality, Cost-Effective Human Resource Systems OD practitioners can con￾tribute to the creation of systems and services that strengthen health care employers’ 
ability to attract and retain qualified workers. This could include strong and unique 
training and development programs, career tracks that provide training and work 
opportunities enabling increased responsibility, mentoring programs to support new 
employees, work/family programs, diversity-friendly policies, and flexible scheduling 
and/or work assignment options. Efforts and programs devoted to effective onboard￾ing of new employees are especially important in retention.
Serving the increasing patient demand amidst human, facility, and financial capacity 
constraints results in significant, negative costs to the people involved. Although stress, 
burnout, and voluntary termination are frequent topics in industry journals today, the 
human and social issues of morale, job satisfaction, commitment, quality of work life, 
and worker productivity and performance are equally important.25 For example, one 
study found that 68% of health care executives see burnout as a serious problem, 64% 
opine that people get physically exhausted by the end of the day, and 58% say emo￾tional exhaustion is common.26 The work environment for the practice of nursing has 
long been cited as one of the most demanding across all types of work settings and it is 
increasingly described as highly stressful and professionally unfulfilling.27 The quality of 
work life for people in health care is under intense attack, and work performance may 
be a casualty of industry change. OD interventions that increase employee involve￾ment and assist members in coping with stress will clearly continue to be needed.
Effective Job and Work Designs According to a national survey, the number-one 
concern of nurses is their increased daily workload.28 Another survey on worker reten￾tion showed that the primary reason why people leave is the inability to use their 
skills and abilities.29 Job redesign may be needed to tailor jobs for an aging workforce 
and one with multiple work/family demands; to address the increasingly challenging 
workload; and to enable the most effective use of expertise. Job redesign and process 
redesign will also be important to address changes that may occur with the adoption 
of new clinical or information technology. Simply automating existing approaches to

work will not achieve the optimal benefits from the capital and human cost of technol￾ogy acquisition. OD practitioners can make a significant contribution in assuring that 
work streamlining in one area (e.g., pharmacy) does not increase workload in another 
(e.g., nursing). Team development will also be increasingly important to address the 
high patient demand and the issues around patient safety.
Restoring Trust In and Among Stakeholders Trust has a significant impact on work￾place relationships and performance. Healthy relationships need trust, and the stron￾ger the level of trust, the stronger the relationship.30 Trust is needed for constructive 
relationships among stakeholders (e.g., physicians, nurses, board, leadership, payers, 
patients, community members, and so on) and to restore public confidence in health 
care organizations. It is crucial for opening dialogue on potential areas of conflict and 
on the ideas needed to address patient safety issues and strategic decisions. Individuals 
who trust each other are more inclined to speak openly about difficult issues. Open 
dialogue facilitates commitment, accountability, and, ultimately, greater performance 
and results. Trust is also important to tap the knowledge and contribution of all work￾ers, especially amidst workforce shortages. Research demonstrates that organizations 
with a high level of trust have four times the level of employee commitment and sig￾nificantly more favorable financial results than their competitors.31
OD practitioners can contribute by assessing the current state of relationships and 
by assisting in surfacing and resolving differences. Skills in conflict resolution and 
restoration of trust will be critical to address challenges from past interactions, to 
maximize effective use of limited talent, and to address societal issues of mistrust in 
public institutions.
Success Principles for OD in Health Care
A set of principles and beliefs that describe effective OD interventions and OD practi￾tioners in health care are posed as future challenges to the practice and practitioners 
of OD in health care.
Demonstrate the Relevance of the Subject to Strategic Performance A central 
debate in OD is whether it should be focused only on quality-of-work-life issues or 
if performance and systems improvement issues should be of equal importance. The 
challenge of keeping up with demand, while addressing workforce shortages and 
tenuous financial conditions, strongly suggests that health care leaders and clinicians 
would label any organizational intervention that is not linked to strategy performance 
as “irrelevant.” Thus, in the health care industry, OD interventions must be linked 
clearly to issues of the organization’s strategic performance—those things that help the 
organization achieve and sustain competitive advantage, such as cost position, clinical 
excellence, and market share. OD interventions must be seen as relevant and neces￾sary to the life-and-death matters in operating a health care organization. Otherwise, 
OD practitioners will not be credible and will not be invited to be part of the executive 
team where they can have a positive influence on the health of the organization. In 
some situations where OD practitioners had not convinced executives of their ability to 
add value to the organization, the practice of OD became viewed as a frivolous luxury 
and did not survive the first round of budget cuts.
Linking OD efforts to issues of strategic importance will require two things: the 
practitioner’s ability to understand the business of health care and how OD skills and 
knowledge can affect organizational performance and the careful identification of and 
the ability to speak professionally about the issues selected for action. The increasingly 
connected relationships among external strategy, structural integration, and human 
systems enhancement will have to be the expanded domain of the OD practitioner 
in health care. Ironically, in attending to the strategic initiatives of the organization, 658 PART 7 Special Applications of Organization Development
quality of work life for employees can also be often enhanced through translating 
strategy down to the level of the employees for a better understanding of what is in it 
for them.
Demonstrate the Importance of Depth for Sustainability Health care’s life-and￾death focus, coupled with the crisis of insufficient capacity (i.e., human, facility, and 
financial) to care for the increased patient demand could prompt interest in quick fixes 
or reactions rather than more-lasting systemic and holistic solutions. OD practitioners 
must be able to make a compelling case for attention to deeper systemic issues for 
sustainable change such as cultures built on trust and learning, rather than shorter￾term “feel good” training and development. Often times, longer-term initiatives occur 
in parallel to the shorter-term activities that may seem more important to non-OD 
professionals.
Demonstrate Competence The changes taking place within health care will require 
constant reevaluation and redefinition of competencies in a particular field or discipline. 
This will be as true for medical professionals and health care managers as for OD prac￾titioners. That may include enhanced knowledge and skill for leaders in intervention 
technologies, exposure to important business trends and regulatory issues, and practice 
in the principles of large-scale change. Leading health systems and hospitals are already 
providing skills and awareness training to managers in areas of leadership, strategy, 
restructuring clinical care, human resources issues, and change management.32
Facilitate Integration Among and between the Diverse Parts of the System 
A universal theme of the practice of OD in health care today is integration among tra￾ditional and nontraditional stakeholder groups. For example, medical staffs, physician 
offices, community agencies, and insurance companies are typically untouched by OD 
processes. Now, in addition to new opportunities for improving the health and perfor￾mance within each of those groups, significant efforts are necessary to facilitate their 
integration to improve health care delivery and effectively deploy limited resources. 
A good example is in the practice of community building, which is currently under 
way among stakeholder groups such as medical practices, citizens, employers, and 
hospitals. The purpose of this intervention is to construct a common vision for what 
constitutes health for the entire community, across all health care providers. OD prac￾titioners are uniquely qualified to assist in developing such a vision. Many have the 
skills and knowledge to work in complex settings with diverse stakeholders and they 
possess the technologies of large-group intervention to create such a process.
Conclusions
The health care industry offers unprecedented challenges and opportunities. OD prac￾titioners can influence positive growth and development by linking their efforts to the 
strategies of the organization, demonstrating competence and integrity, and being able 
to facilitate integration of people and processes across traditional departmental and 
organizational boundaries.
This opportunity comes with a challenge. At a time when each dollar and every 
resource in health care is being closely scrutinized, the inherent value of the OD approach 
is being tested for validity. Clients, under increasing pressure to demonstrate the benefit of 
key activities, will, in turn, subject OD practitioners and their change interventions to the 
same testing. The practitioner must seek a balance between responsiveness and relevance 
while maintaining a commitment to the core values that have defined OD—namely the 
equal importance of human needs and the creation of a work environment that allows 
growth, fulfillment, and performance.33 Ultimately, the ability of the OD practitioner to 
influence health care leaders and stakeholders has the potential to help health care sur￾vive and thrive and will positively affect individuals, communities, and societies.CHAPTER 24 Organization Development in Nonindustrial Settings 659
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT IN SCHOOL SYSTEMS**
The historical search for meaning in U.S. education has shifted among different purposes 
and values, including academic discipline, social efficiency, individual development, voca￾tional competence, freedom, equality, and community. Freeman Butts described these 
purposes as . . . “intersecting, competing, overlapping, fuzzy around the edges, if not in the 
center . . . We cannot escape them by whatever new or innovative terms we may dream up. 
We must grapple with them, try to sort them out, see what they mean for our time, and try 
to decide which deserve priority in the coming years.”34
Grapple we have, and most often without the benefit of an integrated, systemic, 
or even current policy to make sense of educational purposes. Many educational 
institutions in the United States are being criticized for continuing to serve purposes 
that no longer exist in ways that are no longer relevant. Rooted in the industrial age, 
assembly-line concepts of education are still deeply embedded in many schools even 
though the circumstances upon which these concepts were based have disappeared or 
changed dramatically. In fact, educational delivery systems and their related outcomes 
are undergoing tremendous societal scrutiny. Dissatisfaction with the status quo has 
resulted in unprecedented competition, such as private schools and home schooling.35
In response to the stress of changing circumstances and increased competition, “. . . the 
system has turned up the speed on the assembly line—doing what it has always done 
only faster and harder. While this might produce a bit more output, all of us—students, 
teachers, and parents—should be asking whether or not it produces more learning.”36
Education: Industrial-Age Roots
Guided by nineteenth-century industrial practices, traditional models of education 
were designed to generate a standardized product—labor for the ever- expanding work￾place. The same assumptions that guided the operation of U.S. factories were applied 
to schools: “centralization, standardization, hierarchical top-down management, a rigid 
sense of time, and accountability based on adherence to the system.”37 Like an assem￾bly line, the system was organized in discrete stages. Children were segregrated and 
grouped by age. Everyone moved together from one stage to the next. Teachers closely 
supervised each stage. Classes were organized into units of 20–40 students and were 
assigned to meet for specified periods in a tightly scheduled day. Bells and whistles 
regulated rigid time schedules and maintained a uniform speed of operations for the 
entire school.38
The nineteenth century has come and gone; the industrial age has given way to the 
information age. Purposes for schooling have shifted and the factory model has become 
invalid—yet it still exists and some would say it still prevails. Many schools today in 
the United States look very similar to schools of the late nineteenth century. Factory 
model practices have become deeply entrenched and incredibly resistant to large-scale 
change efforts. Two efforts, described below, tried to shift the premises and practices 
of education. The Excellence Movement of the 1980s failed, and the Restructuring 
Movement launched in the 1990s is not without critics and has yet to demonstrate 
any benefits.39
Changing Conditions Cause Stress
A variety of changes, including failed and misguided reform efforts, have caused people 
to question the traditional model of education. First, historic conditions that once sup￾ported the factory model no longer exist and signs of breakdown in the assembly-line 
** Written by Dr. Linda Purrington and Dr. Paul Sparks from Pepperdine University’s Graduate School of 
Education and Psychology.660 PART 7 Special Applications of Organization Development
schools concept are evident. For example, the assumption of a captive female labor 
market for teachers has disappeared as women have pursued a broader range of careers. 
In addition, expectations for teacher certification have increased, teaching conditions 
have become more demanding (particularly in urban settings), and pay has not kept 
pace with other professions. These circumstances have resulted in more than half of 
new teachers leaving the profession within their first three years and raised serious 
concerns about teacher quality.
Second, changes in technology and the traditional family structure have interacted 
to alter the parent–teacher relationship and the availability of knowledge. The tradi￾tional family structure, one parent working and one parent staying home, has been 
replaced by that with two working parents or single parents. Responsibility for child 
care is now shared by schools, and parenting is as much a focus of conversations 
between parents and teachers as is academics. Moreover, students, as a result of com￾munication and media technology, have as much access to information as their parents 
and teachers. New educational technologies not only provide a mix of fun and learn￾ing in ways that schoolrooms are unable to match, but these learning technologies are 
controlled by the student. They can access them when they are ready and are allowed 
to interact with their peers in mutually interesting ways. “Changes in family structure 
have rendered these technologies especially influential, since they often fill the gap as 
substitute parents.”40
Third, the weakening of the traditional educational system is manifested in dis￾contentment on the part of students, administrators, and parents and has resulted in 
unprecedented competition. Strong political, economic, and religious forces have given 
rise to a plethora of schools of choice, each with their unique ideology, curriculum, 
and practices. Those who can afford it opt for other choices, including private schools, 
charter schools, and home schooling. These options are not available to families who 
lack resources. Indeed learning has moved out of schools and classrooms altogether 
into cyberspace aided by new collaborative communication tools. New formats includ￾ing serious games, online museums, and global learning communities are challenging 
the status quo.
Fourth, globalization has significantly influenced employer expectations for workers. 
Well-developed listening and communication skills, collaborative learning capabilities, 
critical thinking, creative production, and systems thinking are viewed as essential for 
the workplace, as are higher levels of literacy and the ability to adapt to rapid change. 
The “new” economy demands a higher level of education for a far greater percentage 
of workers than the old smokestack and agriculture-based economies.41
Fifth, today’s students are more diverse ethnically, culturally, and linguistically than 
ever before. Their needs and interests require more culturally responsive practices that 
require schools to reexamine their understanding of first- and second-language acqui￾sition and the relationship among language, culture, identity, school performance, 
community relations, and outreach; and to challenge biased/racist assumptions about 
learners that are not European in background.
Finally, the economic divide between students with resources and those without 
is widening. Greater pressure is being placed on schools to “level the playing field” 
and to better address the needs of students that have experienced circumstantial or 
generational poverty. Additionally, a significant digital divide has also grown between 
students with access to technology and those without.
Disappointing Reform Efforts
These trends, many of which started years ago, influenced the instigation of two 
large-scale school reform efforts over the past 30 years: the Excellence Movement 
and the Restructuring Movement. The Excellence Movement was a response to CHAPTER 24 Organization Development in Nonindustrial Settings 661
the assessment-of-education report, A Nation at Risk, by the National Commission 
on Excellence in Education in April 1983.42 The commission linked concerns over 
national security to substandard education in American public schools and generated 
considerable debate. In response to the report, hundreds of state and national task 
forces sprung into action to investigate the condition of U.S. public education.
Unfortunately, the Excellence Movement offered no new direction. Initiatives asso￾ciated with this movement were described as “more of the same,” including longer 
school days and longer school years. Roland Barth aptly described some of these efforts 
as nothing more than moving the same furniture around in the same room.43 Within 
five years the Excellence Movement had come and gone.
In 1989, President George H. W. Bush convened the nation’s governors for a sum￾mit meeting on education. Governors had convened only three times before in the 
nation’s history to consider a single topic. A two-part strategy emerged from the sum￾mit: a call for national educational goals and standards and a national exam system. 
The result of the summit was the identification of national goals for education, Goals 
2000, and a new emphasis on site-based reform. Ensuing efforts came to be known as 
the Restructuring Movement and included some common features: site-based manage￾ment with meaningful authority over staffing, program, and budget; shared decision 
making; staff teams with frequent, shared planning time and shared responsibility for 
student instruction; multi-year instructional or advisory groups; and heterogeneous 
grouping in core subjects.
Great optimism was associated with the Restructuring Movement. The term 
suggested a comprehensive redesign and systemic transformation of the schools. 
Simplistic, more-of-the-same approaches were replaced by the mind-set that funda￾mental changes were necessary if schools were to develop the capacity to successfully 
address the significant challenges with which they were presented. Roland Barth 
wrote, “The advent of the restructuring movement brought a sudden confidence 
that teachers and principals, with the help of parents and students, can get their own 
schoolhouse in order.”44
The hopes of the Restructuring Movement have yet to be realized. Research on the 
restructuring movement suggested that most schools focused on marginal changes 
rather than on core issues of teaching and learning. This left the teaching and learning 
process largely unchanged.45 Newmann and Wehlage suggested that the term “restruc￾turing” was used so widely and ambiguously that it soon lost any specific, universally 
understood meaning.46
Dufour and Eaker offered five reasons why these reform efforts failed to produce 
meaningful change in schools.47 Each of them provides important learnings as 
well as opportunities for the application of OD in educational settings. The five reasons 
were (1) the complexity of the task, (2) misplaced focus, (3) lack of clarity on intended 
results, (4) failure to appreciate and attend to the change process, and (5) lack of 
perserverance. Change is difficult in any organization, but changing something as com￾plex as the system of education in the United States is an especially challenging task. 
Fifty states operate over thousands of relatively autonomous school districts. These 
districts serve millions of students and are governed by local school board members. 
Constituents may agree that education is a national problem, but disagree about the 
quality of schools in their communities. While some teachers, students, and parents are 
disenchanted with their local schools, others staunchly defend their schools as serving 
their neighborhoods well.
Prior reform efforts have not directly addressed the quality of student learning. 
They have instead focused on peripheral issues outside of the classroom. Although 
there seems to be general agreement that the educational system needs improvement, 
there is little consensus around goals for improvement, what constitutes success, and 
how success should be measured. A need exists to shift the focus of reform efforts 662 PART 7 Special Applications of Organization Development
from marginal changes to core issues of teaching and learning and strategies that have 
proven to be effective. Subsequently, a need exists to clarify and articulate desired 
results in meaningful terms.
Failure to appreciate and attend to the change processes associated with organizational 
and system reform has resulted in superficial, short-lived, and failed efforts. The change 
process requires skillful planning from beginning efforts to “sustaining” desired out￾comes. Top-down and bottom-up initiated changes are likely to meet with resistance 
when not fully supported. Practitioners in schools who experience an endless array of 
reforms “du jour” initiated one moment and abandoned the next are reluctant to per￾severe and devote the time and energy to what may be perceived as yet another fad. 
“This too will pass” becomes the pervasive thinking and teachers close their doors and go 
about their business as usual. Even changes that are believed to be important by a major￾ity of persons are likely to be “stopped in their tracks” if they are not carefully supported 
with guidance, time, resources, opportunity to collaborate, opportunity to problem￾solve, encouragement, celebration, and a plan for sustaining the change over time.
Another perspective regarding failed reform efforts relates to an inattention to the 
features that distinguish schools from other businesses. Business in the schoolhouse 
is different from business elsewhere.48 First, education is a more purely industrial-age 
institution than is business. Although business borrowed and implemented industrial￾age ideas, it was not created with these ideas. The modern school, on the other hand, 
was conceived with the factory model in mind and has evolved into the school system 
we know today.
Second, school systems are far more tightly embedded in larger social systems than 
are businesses. Individual schools are nested within local districts, which in turn are 
nested within state departments that set policy and standards. As a result, schools are 
directly and immediately affected by changes in policy. Schools are part of communi￾ties in different ways than are businesses. Parents play an important role in school 
governance. They not only have goals for what and how their children learn, but they 
also influence school operations as a whole.
Third, Senge suggests that the degree to which the industrial-age school lives in each 
of us can be a sobering realization from a standpoint of innovation and adaptation. He 
suggests that we begin by challenging industrial-age assumptions about learning such 
as the following: Children are deficient and schools fix them; learning takes place in 
the head, not in the body as a whole; everyone learns or should learn in the same 
way; learning takes place in the classroom, not in the world; and there are smart kids 
and dumb kids. Senge also recommends that we challenge the following industrial￾age assumptions about schooling in order to create conditions and foundations for 
change: Schools are run by specialists who maintain control, knowledge is inherently 
fragmented, schools communicate the truth, learning is primarily individualistic, and 
competition accelerates learning.
A New Metaphor for Schools
In response to the changing times, a new metaphor for schooling has emerged. 
Learning communities are replacing the old model of schools as knowledge factories 
or organizations. “Both the organization and the community metaphor ring true for 
certain aspects of how schools function. But it makes a world of difference which of the 
two provides the overarching frame.”49 Rather than emphasizing externally imposed 
rules, regulations, monitoring, supervision, and evaluation systems to maintain control 
over teachers, the new metaphor implies a very different construct. Learning commu￾nities are built around relationships and shared ideas. Relationships in communities 
are close, informal, cooperative, and trusting— similar to relationships found in families CHAPTER 24 Organization Development in Nonindustrial Settings 663
and other groups of people with close ties. Shared values, sentiments, and beliefs unite 
people in communities around common causes. Leadership in communities emerges 
from moral roots and is servant in nature. Leadership is initiated from “many different 
chairs,” including leadership on the part of students, parents, and community mem￾bers.50 This in turn builds the leadership capacity of the school as a whole. Teams are 
formed with community needs and individual talents and strengths in mind. Efforts are 
made to distribute the work among those who are best suited. Building strengths-based 
communities is a mindscape that replaces the defecit notion of fixing individuals and 
weaknesses. Learning communities are regulary engaged in learning and inquiry with 
a focus on results and continuous improvement much more akin to OD strategies.
The concept of schools as a learner-centered communities emerged in the 1990s and 
has continued to evolve. Peter Senge described schools as learning organizations in his 
book The Fifth Discipline, and the term made its way from business literature to educa￾tional literature.51 In 1992, Sergiovanni translated one of Senge’s five principles—team 
learning—to an educational context: the idea of school as a learning community, sug￾gesting a family-like, close-knit connectedness among members.52 A variety of authors 
have proposed characteristics and practices that reflect a learning community, includ￾ing action and results-oriented focus; continuous improvement; supportive and shared 
leadership; shared purpose, mission, vision, values, and goals; reflective dialogue and 
collective inquiry; and shared responsibility for students’ learning.53
In 2000, The Interstate School Leaders Licensure Consortium (ISLLC) developed six 
standards for leaders and guiding school effectiveness:54
Facilitating the development, articulation, implementation, and stewardship of a 
vision of learning that is shared and supported by the school community
Advocating, nurturing, and sustaining a school culture and instructional program 
conducive to student learning and staff professional growth
Ensuring management of the organization, operations, and resources for a safe, 
efficient, and effective learning environment
Collaborating with families and community members, responding to diverse com￾munity interests and needs, and mobilizing community resources
Acting with integrity, fairness, and in an ethical manner, and
Understanding, responding to, and influencing the larger political, social, eco￾nomic, legal, and cultural context.
In 2004, Alan Blankenstein and associates from the HOPE (Harnessing Optimism and 
Potential through Education) Foundation synthesized the research from the above 
sources, research on effective schools, the U.S. Department’s criteria for excellent 
schools, and their own practice in the field, and distilled the essence of learning com￾munities into six principles:55
Principle 1. Common mission, vision, values, and goals
Principle 2. Ensuring achievement for all students: creating systems for prevention and 
intervention
Principle 3. Collaborative teaming focused on teaching and learning
Principle 4. Using data to guide decision making and continuous improvement
Principle 5. Gaining active engagement from family and community
Principle 6. Building sustainable leadership capacity.
These six principles provide an excellent framework for OD application. A need exists 
to shift the focus of reform efforts from marginal changes to core issues of teaching and 
learning and strategies that have proven to be effective in schools.

Future Opportunities for OD Practice
Schools may call themselves learning communities, but really few are in practice. This is 
not to say that many schools are not taking steps in the right direction. School transfor￾mation is a difficult and evolving process. Becoming an authentic learner-centered com￾munity requires deep changes in theory and culture for traditional schools. Embracing 
the concept of school as a center for inquiry in which children and adults construct 
their own understandings of the world in which they live calls for a significant shift 
in mindscape.56 OD practices can inspire the most promising of school improvement 
practices—those that place emphasis on the teacher, the classroom, and the patterns of 
interaction that exist among teachers and between administrators in the school.57
Building Trust An important first step in becoming an authentic learning community 
is the building of relational trust. A ten-year study of achievement in math and literacy 
in 12 Chicago public schools by the Center for School Improvement at the University 
of Chicago revealed that schools reporting strong positive trust levels were three times 
more likely to improve in reading and math than those with poor trust reports.58 OD 
values–based principles of practice (respect, inclusion, collaboration, authenticity, self￾awarenesss, empowerment) are aligned with four components of relational trust asso￾ciated with professional learning communities: respect for the importance of a person’s 
role and viewpoint, competence to administer one’s role, personal regard for others, 
and integrity in words, actions, and ethics. OD practices can help schools identify the 
nature and quality of relationships and the degree to which cultural norms promote 
school improvement. OD practices can guide schools in inquiry work around the kind 
of relationships that lead to school and student success and how such relationships can 
be formed and sustained.
Setting Strategy Four building blocks form the foundations of professional learning 
communities: mission, vision, values, and goals.59 OD practices can support schools in 
the development of effective mission and vision statements. OD practices can also guide 
school efforts with regard to clarifying values and goal setting. Eaker, DuFour, and 
Burnette recommend that four critical questions be addressed in professional learning 
community mission statements: (1) If we expect students to learn, what is it we expect 
them to learn? (2) How will we know if they are learning it? (3) What will we do when 
they don’t? and (4) How will we engage students in their own learning?60
OD practices can also help professional learning communities develop effective 
vision statements through collaborative processes that promote ownership and unity. 
These processes can ensure that vision statements are based on relevant background 
information and research and that they clarify direction and priorities. OD-supported 
vision development can result in statements that are desirable, feasible, credible, 
and easy to communicate. OD practices can challenge members of the professional 
learning community to identify the specific attitudes, behaviors, and commitments 
they must demonstrate in order to translate vision into reality. They can also help 
communities to set goals, determine which steps need to be taken first, establish 
timelines, and identify measures of success.
Learning Design Designing a systems approach to learning that considers carefully 
the needs of all students and includes prevention, intervention, and remediation 
measures provides a third opportunity for OD practice. Closing the achievement gap 
in schools has become a moral imperative. Gaining staff commitment to the task, 
developing a unifying philosophy, and creating comprehensive systems of support 
present great challenges and opportunities for school transformation.
Collaboration Central to the success of high achieving schools is a collaborative culture 
focused on teaching and learning.61 OD practices can help schools to provide opportu￾nities for collaboration to enhance teaching and learning. Specifically, OD practices can CHAPTER 24 Organization Development in Nonindustrial Settings 665
assist with strategies for effective team organization, team building, decision making, 
managing meetings, sharing workload, developing team member commitment, identi￾fying communication protocols, and monitoring team progress.
Action Research Collecting and using data to guide decision making is a fifth option 
for OD practice to help schools become more results-oriented. What data exists, what 
data should be collected, how should data be used, and who should be involved are 
important questions that schools need to answer in order to successfully use data to 
drive continuous improvement and enhance student achievement.62 The better the 
data, the more able a school is to make improvement plans. Quality data needs to come 
from multiple sources and represent multiple perspectives. It needs to be relevant, 
timely, representative, accurate, and disaggregated. OD practices can help schools use 
data to drive decisions, set goals, target interventions, support change initiatives, guide 
improvement, and monitor progress.
Community Engagement The educational research identifies family and commu￾nity support and involvement as fundamental to student achievement in schools. OD 
practices can assist schools in gaining active engagement from family and community 
through the building of positive family and community relationships, effectively involv￾ing families in the school, and reaching out to family and community members. The 
National Parent Teacher Association offers six national standards for family involve￾ment programs, along with practices that can provide a framework for OD support.63
Standard areas include communication, parenting, student learning, volunteering, 
school decision making and advocacy, and collaborating with community.
Leadership A seventh opportunity for OD practice in schools relates to the develop￾ment of human resources of the learning community so that success lasts well beyond 
the initial implementation of school improvement efforts. Building sustainable lead￾ership capacity in professional learning communities requires the intentional devel￾opment of shared and distributed leadership. In professional learning communities, 
common purpose, commitment, and action bond members together in trusting and 
caring relationships and bind them to important values, purposes, and responsibilities. 
Leadership is a group activity linked to a practice rather than an individual activity 
linked to a person. Consideration for situation and ability determines who assumes 
leadership for which responsibilities.64 OD practice can help schools build leadership 
capacity that outlives individuals and sustains improvement.
Technology’s Unique Role in School OD
The explosion of communication technology at the end of the twentieth century has 
forced a rethinking of teaching and student competencies. In 2003, the Partnership for 
21st Century Skills, in collaboration with business leaders, proposed a new set of com￾petencies necessary for the success of students.65 These competencies reflect the com￾plexities of today’s workplace and include global awareness, creativity and innovation 
skills, media literacy, and leadership/responsibility. While past educational structures 
seem unfit for the task, the recent developments, enabled by technology, are impacting 
21st Century Skills. Global access to information, collaborative virtual spaces, mobile 
technologies, ease of digital media authoring, and multiplayer online games offer rich 
new learning opportunities independent of traditional schools.
For example, collaborative virtual spaces and mobile technologies have opened a 
rich alternate channel for innovative educators to work with students online. E-mailed 
homework, discussion topics in newsgroups, dialogue using chat or IM, posting group 
work on blogs, and sharing video in real time are a few examples. Home schooling is 
another fast-growing, nontraditional educational structure that is greatly facilitated by 
new technology.66666 PART 7 Special Applications of Organization Development
Online Learning Communities These are designed to allow users with common interests 
to form their own virtual space for sharing documents, comments, and contact informa￾tion. Less formally structured than school settings and independent of geography, they 
provide powerful virtual collaboration and learning. Their popularity can be measured by 
the tens of thousands of groups and the millions of users on sites such as 43things.com, 
Meetup.com, and Google groups.
Online mentoring is an important subset of online community learning. Many 
schools, companies, and professional organizations offer online mentoring for new 
community members. Indeed, many churches and self-help organizations offer virtual 
online community space to support members. Technology supported, communities of 
practice are emerging as worthy competitors to courses and classrooms. Community 
members commit to working together to solve common problems and in the pro￾cess share valuable information and create lasting communities. Collaborative online 
tools make this possible as people with same jobs are often geographically distributed 
limiting useful interaction.
Media-Based Learning This is a whole industry of content providers that has grown 
to support organizations with common content, such as ethics training. Professional 
organizations also sponsor content creation and delivery through focused learning 
modules. Nearly all have recently added collaboration tools to the packaged learning 
to better reinforce learning.
Media and content creation have become so accessible that new tools are appearing 
that allow learners to share directly with each other. Teachertube (http://www.
teachertube.com), a takeoff from the popular youtube, was created to allow teachers 
to learn from each other by sharing videos and dialogue.Wikipedia is a collaborative 
online encyclopedia maintained and used by potentially everyone with Internet access. 
These powerful media tools clearly have implications for the structure of an education 
system designed to deliver knowledge.
Gaming Environments They represent another transformation-based technology. The 
success of video games and the complex yet effortless learning associated with them 
suggest yet another powerful learning strategy apart from schools. Many researchers 
claim games alter learning altogether—what should be learned and how.
How hard this huge new cohort works, how they try to compete, how they fit into teams, 
how they take risks—all are different in statistically verifiable ways. And those differences 
are driven by one central factor: growing up with video games.67
Quest Atlantis is a 3-D online multiplayer game funded by NSF to apply games to 
education. Students and teachers collaborate on learning quests in an environment of 
social commitment.68 Its effectiveness for formal education is being tested currently in 
South Carolina schools, but its effectiveness as a learning strategy is not disputed in 
the marketplace.
These are key examples of how new communication technologies enable more 
compelling learning strategies. The ability of educational institutions to embrace 
them will ultimately decide their future. In fact, Knight suggests that traditional edu￾cational organizations may themselves have learning disabilities, judging from their 
ongoing inability to change in the face of new theory and technology.69
Interestingly, a common feature of these emerging learning strategies is the OD 
principle of community involvement. David Cavalo, director of the Center for the 
Future of Learning at MIT, has pushed for a new learning model called “emergent 
design.” The design requires community development of learning goals similar to 
building design. He says, “the design and implementation of technology-enabled orga￾nizational change has not played a significant role in guiding educational thinking.”70
Perhaps it is time.CHAPTER 24 Organization Development in Nonindustrial Settings 667
Conclusions
The purpose and best practices of education continue to be complex and hotly debated. 
Historically, the development of traditional educational organizations has shifted among 
a variety of values and purposes largely unaided by OD principles. More recently, the 
focus has been on academics and personal and social development.71 The current need 
for connected, technology-savvy workers with 21st Century Skills and more attention 
to OD practices has given rise to a new strategy—professional learning communities. 
Independent learning communities have already been growing around online gam￾ing and other online communities. Whether school systems are able to systematically 
embrace this fundamental change is still in question.
Opportunities for OD practice in schools to support their transformation toward pro￾fessional learning communities include helping schools build relational trust; develop 
and sustain shared mission, vision, values, and goals; design a systems approach for 
learning that includes prevention and intervention; collaborate to enhance teaching 
and learning; use data to guide decision making and continuous improvement; gain 
active engagement from family and community; and build sustainable leadership 
capacity.
Shaping organizational culture is key to developing a school’s capacity to function 
as a professional learning community. Change can be accomplished and sustained only 
when key OD practices become embedded within the culture of the school. Collective 
inquiry, collaborative teams, an orientation toward action, and a focus on results are 
the essential elements of a professional learning community. Regular sharing of values, 
engaging in reflective dialogue, exchanging stories that reflect culture, and celebrating 
progress and accomplishment are strategies necessary for shaping culture.
The three Cs, communication, collaboration, and culture, are key to sustaining 
improvement initiatives. Collaboration requires teamwork, time, explicit purpose, train￾ing and support, and individual and collective commitment on the part of all members of 
the learning community. Specific leadership responsibilities are key to guiding successful 
change efforts that involve schools in deep change with a conti nuous focus on school 
improvement. Change efforts in learning communities engage teachers, administrators, 
students, and parents in inquiry. Inquiry involves challenging underlying assumptions, 
beliefs, and values. Learning communities regularly engage in inquiry, and inquiry has the 
potential of leading individuals and organizations to new and better ways of being.
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR***
Public-sector organizations, such as federal, state, and local governments, operate in 
a complex environment of competing political, social, and economic forces. Calls for 
the government to become more citizen focused and to operate in a more business￾like manner are common. Legislation and programs aimed at improving government 
accountability, quality, and effectiveness are being introduced and adopted at all levels 
of government.72 For example, the National Partnership for Reinventing Government 
(formerly the National Performance Review 1993) initiative created by former President 
Bill Clinton and run by former Vice President Al Gore called for national agencies 
to transform themselves into more effective, high-quality, customer-focused service 
providers.73 It outlined recommendations for improvements that have resulted in a 
$108 billion saving for the period FY 1995–1999.74 At the state level, initiatives to curb

Communications Department, City of Carlsbad.668 PART 7 Special Applications of Organization Development
government revenues or taxing authority, such as California’s Proposition 13 (adopted 
by voters in 1978) and Proposition 218 (adopted by voters in 1996), continue to be 
introduced.
In addition, public-sector organizations face increasingly complex and significant 
challenges in responding to citizens, crafting public policy, and providing public services. 
Conflicting public policies at the federal, state, and local level, coupled with unfunded 
mandates and restricted revenue, further complicate the environment in which they 
operate. Their record of successfully responding has been spotty at best, with trust in 
the federal government falling dramatically. In 1964, 75% of Americans said that they 
trusted the federal government to do the right thing “just about always” or “most of the 
time.” By 1999, that percentage had dropped to 29%.75 The Gallup organization has con￾ducted similar polls about trust in government since 1972. Gallup has found that “Barely 
half of Americans, 51%, say they have a ‘great deal’ or ‘fair amount’ of trust in the fed￾eral government to handle international problems. Less than half of Americans, 47%, 
now have a ‘great deal’ or a ‘fair amount’ of trust in the federal government to handle 
domestic problems. And only 32% ‘think you can trust government in Washingtion to 
do what is right . . .’ ‘just about always’ or ‘most of the time.’ In contrast, just over two￾thirds express trust in their own state and local governments.”76
In the face of terrorism, war, and global economic and social turbulence, these 
numbers at the federal level are unlikely to improve. Similarly, public participation, 
once the hallmark of the American democratic process, is suffering. Voter turnout in 
presidential elections has dropped from more than 62% in 1964 to 51% in 2000.77
Voter turnout continues to decline across the board with only 41.4% of eligible voters 
voting in 2006.78
As a result, public-sector organizations are engaging in a variety of efforts focused 
on increasing citizen participation and involvement in hopes of developing greater 
public trust and confidence in government as they move further into the twenty-first 
century.
For example, many governments are supporting community building and neigh￾borhood involvement initiatives such as the Connecting Community, Place and Spirit 
learning conference in Carlsbad, California, and the Block by Block neighborhood 
engagement program in Clearwater, Florida. At the same time, they are attempting 
to be more productive, efficient, and effective by downsizing and privatizing public 
services and introducing technology to increase effectiveness and productivity.79 The 
demand for certain public services on a 7/24 basis is making it necessary for govern￾ment agencies to adapt and provide them in new ways. The International City/County 
Management Association (www.ICMA.org) has introduced a nationwide performance 
measurement and management intitiative aimed at improving and proving public￾sector effectiveness. The Alliance for Innovation (www.transformgov.org) has intro￾duced nationwide initiatives to foster innovation at all levels of local government that 
also results in a culture of continuous improvement and learning. City governments, 
such as Phoenix, Arizona, and San Diego, California, are competing with the private 
sector through managed competition programs. Other cities, such as Carlsbad and 
Irvine, California, are implementing performance management compensation systems 
that reward employees based on competencies and the achievement of goals. All of 
these changes are being introduced to translate legislative mandates into measurable 
results and outcomes, such as citizen satisfaction and service quality.
These types of changes suggest a vital and important OD role in the public sector. 
Planned organization change efforts in this context can be as successful as those in pri￾vate organizations,80 and OD interventions are becoming more common and accepted 
in government. For example, community-visioning processes are being conducted 
to connect government with its citizens; technology has become an indespinsable 
foundation for helping governments operate more effectively; team building is being CHAPTER 24 Organization Development in Nonindustrial Settings 669
inculcated in elected officials and staff at all levels of the organization; and perfor￾mance management and compensation programs are being implemented. Culture 
change intitiatives are also finding their way into public-sector programs as a means to 
strengthen a shared knowledge of the values, mission, and vision of the organization. 
These OD interventions, and others included in this book, are helping public-sector 
organizations respond to the citizenry and transform themselves into citizen-focused, 
customer-driven, results-oriented public-sector organizations.
Although public-sector OD applications are becoming more common, they face a 
unique set of circumstances, including a complex political and operational environ￾ment. Interventions are often conducted in the public arena among a number of 
stakeholders, each of whom has legitimate standing in the policy- making process—and 
often in the decision-making process. The climate and support for OD is complicated 
further by the structure of public-sector organizations. Although the legislative and 
political arena is interdependent with the administrative and staff domain, it is highly 
unlikely that both will be involved in the same OD intervention. If they are, each 
domain has a different role and operates based on different and sometimes competing 
values. To conduct planned change initiatives effectively, OD practitioners must rec￾ognize and appreciate these differences. This section highlights some key differences 
between the public and the private sectors and discusses some of the implications for 
applying OD in public-sector organizations.
Comparing Public- and Private-Sector Organizations
Public- and private-sector organizations differ along four key dimensions: values and 
structure, the multiplicity of decision makers, stakeholder diversity and access, and the 
extent of intergovernmental relationships. Each of these differences is discussed along 
with its implications for OD practice. This discussion draws on the writing and research 
of Bob Golembiewski, John Bryson, H. George Frederickson, and John Nalbandian.
Values and Structures Public- and private-sector organizations differ in important 
ways with respect to their values and structures. In private-sector companies, the key 
values are profitability and the creation of competitive advantage. The board of direc￾tors, who represent the shareholders, and the management team, who are tasked with 
implementing a strategy, share these values. Although public-sector organizations 
share a similar structural arrangement of representation and implementation, there 
are crucial differences in purpose and role that hold important implications for OD 
practice.
In contrast to the private sector, the overarching purpose of public-sector organizations 
is to govern toward greater public good and demonstrate responsiveness to public 
wants and needs. The public good is addressed through the adoption of laws and poli￾cies and the establishment of public services and programs that support a broad array 
of citizen needs that must, by law, be discussed and adopted in an open public meeting. 
Responsiveness is reflected in demands for representation, efficiency, individual rights, 
and social equity.81 In service of these values and purposes, public-sector organizations 
also adopt a representation–implementation structural form. The representative func￾tion is known as the political or legislative domain, and the implementation function is 
known as the administrative domain.
The public-sector political–administrative structure reflects the values and roles 
inherent in government organizations. In the classic theory of public administration, 
the political domain is led by elected representatives who pass legislation and enact stat￾utes in service of the public good. In turn, they delegate implementation of programs 
and statutes to administrative agencies.82 The political domain includes both elected and 
politically appointed officials, and the administrative group includes merit-based civil 
servants and certain executives, such as city managers, who are appointed on the basis 670 PART 7 Special Applications of Organization Development
of professional rather than political criteria.83 This structure mirrors the private sector’s 
distinction between a board of directors and management.
Unlike private-sector organizations, however, the purposes and values within 
public-sector organizations are not shared necessarily by the political and administra￾tive functions. For example, politicians serve at the pleasure of the public. Although 
private-sector board members are elected representatives of the shareholders, their 
elections are not as open and public as are those of political officeholders. Politicians 
must compete to get elected and continue to posture, and compete to get reelected. 
As a result, political values of responsiveness, representation, social equity, and effi￾ciency, and the ever-present political survival value are reflected in an open and pub￾lic process where the particular interests and values of a diverse set of constituencies 
are brought together to produce a common view of the public good. Clearly, politics 
is the art and science of government.84
Moreover, the political function is responsible for the establishment and oversight 
of an administrative organization that is designed to implement the outcomes of the 
legislative process. Generally, the mission of the administrative function is the imple￾mentation and enforcement of the laws and delivery of public services or goods. The 
legislative mandates, rules, and procedures established to address public wants and 
needs make public-sector organizations less flexible than most private-sector organiza￾tions and constrain their ability to act outside of their legislative framework. Thus, the 
administrative function values partisan neutrality; selection and promotion on the basis 
of merit, specialization, and expertise; the use of information for analyzing public policy 
issues; recordkeeping for purposes of continuity; application of the work ethic; and the 
justification of decisions based on efficiency (achieving the most productivity for the 
money available) or economy (achieving a given level of productivity for as little money 
as possible) or both.85 When elected officials are responding to the citizenry or setting 
policy, the political domain’s values of responsiveness and representation may over￾ride the administrative values of functional expertise and economy. When such value 
conflicts occur, administrators are often caught in the tension between politics and their 
mandate to run an efficient organization.
These value differences, along with the government’s regulatory and taxation role, 
have contributed to the perception of government as a bureaucracy, which simply 
refers to the administration of a government through bureaus staffed with nonelected 
officials. Perceptions of bureaucracy are often negative, however, and include indif￾ferent people exercising power through strict adherence to inflexible policies, rules, 
and procedures. In addition, government appetite for risk is extremely low resulting in 
a plethora of rules and regulations fostered to minimize any possibility of something 
going wrong.
Although public- and private-sector organizations can take on the characteristics of a 
bureaucracy, such as departmentalization, vertical decision-making processes, and many 
formal rules and procedures, the characteristics are more pronounced in government 
organizations. A critical reason for this phenomenon is that government organizations 
are legislated into existence, giving the organization or agency life until it is legislated 
out of existence. As a result, the organization receives funding that sustains its existence 
regardless of performance. Although budgets at all levels of government are reviewed 
and adopted annually, the complete elimination of a public-sector agency or organization 
is rare. The effect is that public-sector organizations, despite their purpose, can be much 
less responsive to citizens and customers than private-sector organizations because they 
aren’t directly reliant on the customer for funding to sustain their existence.
The political nature of the legislative and representation process and the functional 
expert and efficiency orientation of the administrative process produce important ten￾sions in a public-sector organization. OD practitioners must be aware of these tensions 
and of the implications they have for OD practice. First, OD practitioners must understand CHAPTER 24 Organization Development in Nonindustrial Settings 671
that a public-sector organization’s primary mission, unlike private-sector organizations, is 
set by law, and major changes can occur only through additional legislative action. Even 
so, appointed officials and staff have much flexibility and discretion on how to implement 
government services and programs. The implication for OD is that many of the interven￾tions used to help private-sector organizations, such as strategic goal setting, business 
process reengineering, total quality management, large-group interventions, and team 
building, can be used successfully in the public sector.
Second, public-sector interventions often require approval and funding from an 
elected board. This increases the probability that the design, especially one for citizen￾and neighborhood-focused initiatives, will be scrutinized and challenged to ensure its 
efficacy. OD practitioners need to be ready to provide evidence of success for particular 
interventions in public-sector organizations.
Third, OD processes that support elected officials in citizen-focused initiatives or in 
enacting policy must consider the public environment in which they are being con￾ducted. Public-sector organizations are subject to greater direct public access, media 
coverage, and a much broader array of responsibilities and more distributed power 
than are most private-sector organizations. As a result, most policy-level OD and 
citizen-focused applications will be conducted in public. OD practitioners must select 
processes that create a constructive environment on the one hand and allow for public 
participation and review on the other. In addition, OD interventions must account for 
the vulnerability that elected officials, and sometimes public administrators, experi￾ence. For example, the results of a community-visioning process may serve as the 
political platform for candidates seeking the same public office that the incumbents 
leading the visioning process currently hold. OD practitioners need to be aware of this 
possibility as interventions are designed and implemented.
Fourth, the values of the political domain may differ from traditional OD values. The 
win–lose dynamics associated with passing legislation, mediating competing interests 
and political trade-offs, and balancing scarce resources can conflict with OD values of 
collaboration, teamwork, and efficiency. Improving organization effectiveness is an OD 
value often at odds with the political process. Last, administrative values and OD values 
are more likely to be aligned than either of those values with the political domain. To be 
effective, an OD practitioner must appreciate the tensions found in these differences.
Multiplicity of Decision-Makers The public sector operates in an environment of 
largely unlimited access to multiple authoritative decision makers, a phenomenon 
designed to ensure that “public business gets looked at from a variety of perspec￾tives.”86 The public expects full and legitimate access to all government decision mak￾ers at every level. As a result, access to the decision-making process is broader and 
accountability is more dispersed than in private-sector organizations, where such 
access is uncommon and responsibility is more clear-cut.87 Further, government frag￾mentation complicates the public-sector decision-making process, where it is com￾mon for different public agencies to be responsible for different steps in governmental 
processes. Such fragmentation often makes it confusing and difficult for citizens, cli￾ents, customers, and even public officials and staff to understand who is responsible 
for what decision and accountable for what product.
In addition, Golembiewski noted that decision making by public officials “tends to 
favor patterns of delegation that maximize their sources of information and minimize 
the control exercised by subordinates.”88 Specifically, the goal was to have all decisions 
brought to their level for action and review. While this may have been the case in the 
past, most public-sector organizations today are just as embroiled as the private sector 
in the task of evolving from a command-and-control decision-making structure to one 
of empowered workers. Within the constraints of the legal mandates and regulations 
governing the organization, public officials can delegate decision-making responsibility 672 PART 7 Special Applications of Organization Development
and accountability to the public worker closest to the citizen and customer if they want 
to and if it is in alignment with their leadership philosophy. The implication is that OD 
values that seek to expand worker self-direction and move decision making closest to 
the point of service are consistent with many government transformation efforts cur￾rently under way.
This multiplicity of decision makers and government fragmentation result in addi￾tional implications for OD interventions. First, multiple decision makers make it dif￾ficult to determine the identity of the client and the expected results. For example, a 
legislative body may adopt a policy, such as pay for performance, and direct staff to 
design and implement the program. In this example, both the legislative body and the 
staff are accountable and responsible for different parts of the intervention. Because 
the policy and administrative decision-making process are interdependent, the OD 
practitioner may be unable to gain the same level of clarity about who is the client, 
their authority, and an understanding of their responsibilities that is possible in the 
private sector.
Second, support and funding approval for OD interventions may be more difficult to 
obtain than in the private sector. The implication for OD practitioners, when operating 
across multiple departmental lines within the same organization, is most direct when 
entering and contracting. The project may require staff support for the intervention 
and legislative approval and funding for the project. As a result of the public approval 
process, OD practitioners must be able to explain the process and expected outcomes 
and must remember that the public or politicians resisting the project may challenge 
the efficacy of the intervention(s).
Stakeholder Access As described earlier, a stakeholder is any group or individual 
who is affected by or who can affect the policies and operations of the public-sector 
organization—citizens, customers, political parties, corporations, employees, other 
governments, interest groups, critics, and so forth.89 In contrast to private industry, the 
public sector conducts business in open public meetings and involves a “greater variety 
of individuals and groups with different and often mutually exclusive sets of interests, 
reward structures, and values.”90 In addition, citizens and interest groups have full 
access to public reports, documents, plans, and other background information via 
public records, public notices, and the Internet. OD practitioners must recognize that 
all stakeholders, most of whom bring different values, goals, or proposed solutions 
to public issues, have legitimate entry into the public policy and administrative pro￾cesses. For example, stakeholders supporting the goals inherent in the Americans with 
Disabilities Act must compete for funding with stakeholders supporting the objectives 
inherent in the Endangered Species Act and its programs. Such conflicting interests 
and access create a broad array of challenges for OD. Foremost among the challenges 
is helping diverse groups of people with different and competing interests to collabo￾rate with each other in developing a common goal that may represent an unpopular 
compromise to any individual group.
Anyone who wants to, citizens and even non-residents (legal or not), may influ￾ence the policy-making process. Such broad access may exist in the private sector with 
respect to certain types of information, but the ability to influence corporate deci￾sions and activities is much more restricted. What this level of public access does to 
the policy-making process is complicate and politicize the roles and responsibilities of 
politicians and administrators. Thus, the role demands of an elected official are much 
broader than the role demands of a private-sector board member. In addition, public￾sector administrators, who are responsible for implementing public policy, have a duty 
to respond to the citizens, elected officials, and the staff that work for them. Everyone 
must be listenened to and no one can be ignored. The implications of this network of 
roles and responsibilities for OD practitioners is that, in reality, anybody can make a CHAPTER 24 Organization Development in Nonindustrial Settings 673
demand to be involved in the process at virtually any level of a public organization and 
the likelihood is that the individual or group will have legitimate standing to do so.
In addition, public-sector employees are stakeholders as a result of their legal right 
to form unions to represent them on matters concerning wages, hours, and working 
conditions. Because collective bargaining laws are structured for managing disagree￾ment, a challenge for OD practitioners, if involved, is to help facilitate the process in 
a way where all parties perceive their interests have been considered and feel heard. 
A poor labor relations environment and poor employee morale will make it difficult, if 
not impossible, to implement OD interventions successfully. It will become especially 
difficult if the unions decide to get involved politically in supporting or opposing the 
reelection or election of a candidate(s). Importantly, OD practitioners must understand 
that, in contrast to the private sector, it is difficult to arrange stakeholder interests 
and expectations behind a common goal. Even so, practitioners must appreciate that 
“attention to stakeholder concerns is crucial because the key to success in public and 
nonprofit organizations is the satisfaction of key stakeholders.”91
Intergovernmental Relations Governments are designed to focus both functions and 
power, and paradoxically, to disperse power and functions so that no one govern￾ment or agency is all-powerful. As a result, “government” comprises a latticework of 
independent agencies or departments providing different public services to the same 
citizens and customers. The result is an intergovernmental relations environment 
where federal, state, and local governments share power, responsibility, and, in some 
cases, resources.92 These intergovernmental relationships raise several considerations 
for public-sector OD applications.
First, issues of coordination and power may emerge out of the sharing of responsibil￾ity across public-sector organizations in the provision of public services. Although the 
services may appear to be provided by “the government,” the reality is that a number 
of public organizations are often responsible for different aspects of the same public 
service. For example, providing an integrated transportation system requires federal, 
state, special district, private developer, and local government participation. The federal 
government and special districts work together to provide train and bus service. The 
state works with federal and local governments to provide interstate and state high￾ways. Local governments construct the local road system with financial assistance from 
development, federal, and state agencies. OD practitioners working on intergovern￾mental relations projects must utilize a network perspective that makes explicit these 
differences with the intention of reaching agreement about overarching outcomes, 
responsibility, and shared resources.
Second, local governments must implement federal and state laws and policies that 
often conflict with each other. In such cases, it is common to find that a federal policy, 
such as the Clean Water Act or the Endangered Species Act, sets goals and objectives 
for state and local government organizations, the objectives of which are in direct con￾flict. As a result, it often falls to local government to balance out the competing policies 
to comply with all of the mandates. The resulting questions as to which agency has the 
most power, who is responsible for which services or programs, and what is the level 
of government pay for those services or programs have important OD implications. For 
example, a network development intervention would recognize the existing transorga￾nizational system and help all agencies, each with a different degree of power, achieve 
reasonable agreement in addressing legislative goals and implementation issues. As 
with the private sector, however, reaching agreement often involves contentious nego￾tiations where differing positions are addressed, acceptable trade-offs are found, and 
conflict is managed and resolved. Since different levels of government have different 
degrees of power, the OD practitioner could facilitate a positive result to the process 
by getting early agreement between the organizations on how decision making and 674 PART 7 Special Applications of Organization Development
conflict will be managed. Such an intervention is complex, however, because govern￾ment agencies tend to preserve their power and protect their interests at virtually all 
costs while limiting their financial and resource responsibility. Appreciation for the 
mission and power relationships among agencies is critical in designing effective net￾work development interventions.
Clearly, there are important differences between public and private organizations, 
and in many instances the public-sector organization is more complex. In addition, 
one must appreciate the distinctions between the political domain and the administra￾tive domain to consult or work in public organizations. With this understanding and 
an appreciation of the political arena in which public organizations operate, applica￾tion of OD programs and techniques can be successful.
Recent Research and Innovations in Public-Sector Organizational 
Development
The comparisons between the public and the private sectors described above suggest 
that OD has a role in government and not-for-profit organizations. OD practitioners 
need to appreciate the inherent differences and understand that OD applications in 
the public sector are conducted in a complex political and organizational environment. 
Moreover, the unique features of public organizations—the values and structures, the 
multiplicity of decision makers, stakeholder diversity, and the intergovernmental rela￾tions environment—make OD applications challenging but not impossible.
Despite these challenges to OD practice in the public sector, there is growing 
evidence that OD interventions in government are successful, even when compared 
with change efforts in private industry. One review of 574 OD applications across the 
two sectors showed a similar pattern of predominantly positive results in both gov￾ernment and private industry.93 Another study of 154 quality circle interventions in 
public and private organizations concluded that, although the highest levels of suc￾cess occurred in private firms, overall success rates were substantial in both sectors.94
A recent and particularly rigorous review of 52 OD interventions in government and 
industry confirmed these conclusions. The findings suggested that OD interventions 
were similarly successful in the two sectors, and led the researchers to conclude that 
the results “serve to contradict the common notion that planned change is likely to 
be less successful in the public sector.”95
In addition to these promising findings, recent innovations in government point to 
the continued growth and success of OD in the public sector. At the federal level, for 
example, both Congress and the Clinton administration enacted legislation and reforms 
to create a twenty-first-century government designed to “get results Americans care 
about” with the overarching goal to “restore trust in America’s government.” In 1993, 
former President Bill Clinton created the National Performance Review (NPR), which 
was later renamed as the National Partnership for Reinventing Government. This 
program was discontinued in early 2001, but produced impressive results, including 
the creation of more than 4,000 customer service standards, the introduction of the 
Hammer Award for federal employees who reinvented their part of the government, 
and the passage of 34 laws enacting recommendations needing legislation. In addi￾tion, there have been cost savings of over $136 billion, more than 16,000 pages of 
reduced regulation, a reduction of 351,000 positions, and 83,000 laws enacting NPR 
recommendations.96 These results have been achieved through interventions aimed 
at creating learning organizations (Chapter 21) and high-involvement organizations 
(Chapter 15), reengineering projects aimed at streamlining work flows and response 
times (Chapter 14), and, perhaps most difficult of all, efforts to change the civil service 
system so that the federal workforce is more flexible, development oriented, and per￾formance driven.CHAPTER 24 Organization Development in Nonindustrial Settings 675
These national reforms have their complement in state and local governments. Faced 
with similar pressures to reform, become more focused on citizens and customers, and 
operate in a more businesslike manner, state and local governments are introducing 
initiatives to become more productive and efficient while providing top-quality ser￾vices. For example, a national survey of 987 state agencies found that 60% of them 
were using some type of strategic planning.97 Another national survey found that all 
but three states have performance-based budgeting requirements,98 and almost every 
state has enacted quality awards based on the Hammer Award and Malcolm Baldrige 
National Quality Award criteria.99 In addition, local governments have conducted a 
variety of OD activities, such as team building, leadership development, large-group 
interventions, and total quality management programs, to become more effective.100
Finally, NGOs are working to help improve government. The National Innovations 
in American Government Awards, cosponsored by the Ford Foundation, the John F. 
Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, and the Council for Excellence 
in Government, recognize examples of creative problem solving in the public sector. 
The National Civic League’s All-America City Award recognizes exemplary community 
problem solving and is given to communities that cooperatively tackle challenges and 
achieve results. The Alliance for Redesigning Government of the National Academy 
of Public Administration is a national network for all levels of government that advo￾cate performance-based, results-driven governance. The Alliance for Innovation is a 
national network and clearinghouse of local government organizations with the mis￾sion of innovation in providing public services, sustaining meaningful connections, 
and renewing passion for public service.
Conclusions
OD applications have proven to be effective in public-sector organizations. Faced with 
many of the same pressures as private industry and some that are unique to govern￾ment, public organizations will continue to use OD applications and inter ventions to 
transform themselves into citizen- and customer-driven, high- performance, results￾oriented organizations. But to be effective, practitioners helping government must 
appreciate the differences incumbent in public-sector values and organization struc￾ture; the differences in public and private organizations; and the mind-sets of elected 
officials and government workers. OD practitioners need to understand public- sector 
organizations and tailor interventions to fit highly diverse, politicized situations 
where elected officials and bureaucrats struggle with moving toward a new emphasis 
on continuous improvement, teamwork, customer focus, employee development, 
and learning. Although public-sector OD is difficult and challenging, the successes 
cited in this chapter illustrate that OD is an invaluable tool in helping public-sector 
organizations provide top-quality services.
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT IN FAMILY-OWNED 
BUSINESSES****
Family businesses, such as Levi Strauss, Cargill, and Kikkoman (founded in 1630), are 
the most common and least understood types of business organizations. Often thought 
of as “mom and pop” operations, more than one-third of the Fortune 500 companies are 
owned or controlled by family members. Moreover, family businesses comprise the single 
largest demographic segment—between 65 and 80% of all worldwide businesses—and 
**** Written by Dr. Otis W. Baskin, professor of management, Pepperdine University’s Graziadio School 
of Business and Management.676 PART 7 Special Applications of Organization Development
they generate half of the U.S. domestic product and employ 50% of the workforce.101
One recent study showed that one-third of S&P 500 firms are family controlled and they 
outperform the publicly controlled companies.102
While professional advisors, such as accountants, lawyers, and financial planners, 
have been serving this market for years, they are frequently puzzled by the complexity 
of relationships in these organizations. Organization development practitioners have 
recently begun to recognize that their ability to understand the dynamics of human and 
family relationships can address many needs within this context. This section explores 
the definition and model of the family business system, outlines critical issues facing 
family firms, and describes a typical planned change process.
The Family Business System
The most common definition of a family business is an organization where ownership 
and/or management control rests with a family (or families).103 This definition covers a 
wide range from small, owner-managed businesses to Ford Motor company, where the 
Ford family owns a minority of the stock but retains voting control through a complex 
system of voting shares. Some families retain 100% of the ownership while employing 
“professional management” to run their business. Cargill is a globally dominant agribusi￾ness giant with an estimated $60 billion in annual sales, employing 79,000 people in 
65 countries with ownership held by only 80 family members.104 Even when founding 
families no longer have managerial or voting control they may still be a significant force 
in the decision-making process of the firm. Many believe that the principal reason why 
the board of Hewlett-Packard failed to ultimately support CEO Carly Fiorina in her strat￾egy for the HP–Compaq merger was her failure to recognize the influence of the Hewlett 
and Packard families beyond their votes on the board. Even in companies that have long 
since lost all current family involvement, values, and vision from founding families can 
be powerful forces. The ability of Johnson & Johnson to survive the poisoningof Tylenol 
capsules is generally attributed to the application of the company’s CREDO originally 
written when it was family-owned. OD practitioners can help firms understand these 
“soft” decision factors in governance and management decision processes.
Generally, family firms are understood to have several potential competitive advan￾tages that public- or private-equity-owned organizations do not (Table 24.1). These 
include higher employee loyalty (family and nonfamily), the ability to quickly move in 
and out of market niches due to their flexible form of organization, their long-term (vs. 
short-term) orientation, and the ability to keep information about the business out of 
view of the public and their competitors. When a controlling family owns a business, 
even if family members are not active in management, their “patient capital,” interest in 
their communities, and unity of purpose can result in distinctive capabilities that com￾petitors are unable to match.105
A family business system model is shown in Figure 24.1 that defines the three basic 
components of family business organizations. It helps to understand the differences 
between family firms and more traditional businesses, and how OD practice must be 
modified. The family business system is composed of three different subsystems: the 
business, the owners, and the family. For each subsystem there is an implicit under￾standing of the goals, and in family-firm best practices there is an explicit plan that 
describes how the objectives will be achieved with a governance structure that repre￾sents the people in that system. In the case of the founding generation of an owner￾managed business, all three of these systems may completely overlap with a married 
couple both working in the business and sharing ownership. As the business and the 
family grow and ownership extends to subsequent generations these systems continue 
to move apart allowing for more variation in roles and creating more complexity in 
the system.CHAPTER 24 Organization Development in Nonindustrial Settings 677

Business, Ownership, and Family Systems One of the principal advantages of a 
family business is the increased potential for unity of purpose and action between 
owners and management.106 The lack of this unity in public-owned businesses is 
termed “agency cost” and was first described by Adam Smith in The Wealth of Nations:
“(B)eing the managers of other people’s money than of their own, it cannot well be 
expected that (the managers of public corporations) should watch over (public inves￾tors’ wealth) with the same anxious vigilance with which partners in a private co-part￾nery frequently watch over their own.”107
The business system may consist (depending upon the stage of development) of fam￾ily and nonfamily managers, the strategic business plan, and a governance structure 
including a board of directors and sometimes a nonfamily advisory board. The stra￾tegic plan should outline the business goals, objectives, strategies, and organization 
design. The board of directors and advisors counsels the business’s leader(s) on strategy 
implementation, organization form, and other key business policy decisions. It is not 
unusual to find family businesses with nonfunctioning boards made up of the founder 
and spouse and sometimes including a trusted attorney and accountant. These “nomi￾nal” boards often do not have meetings and only sign the required legal documents. 
However, when siblings or cousins own a business where some owners are managers 
and others do not work in the business, a more functional governance structure is 
needed.
The ownership system consists of the business’s owners (family and nonfamily), a 
shareholders agreement (preferably a legal document), and a governance structure 
that may be represented in a formal shareholder meeting. The shareholder agreement 
should outline the owners’ business goals and objectives including risk tolerance, 
expected return on investment, liquidity goals, and a buy–sell mechanism. A share￾holder meeting can provide a structure for owners to meet to develop and oversee 
their mutual interests in the business. Shareholder assumptions, including the buy–sell 
agreement, ownership succession, dividend policies, and investment options for busi￾ness proceeds, are relevant topics for this forum. Shareholders are responsible for 
reviewing the family enterprise plan (discussed below) and determining the relevant CHAPTER 24 Organization Development in Nonindustrial Settings 679
goals and policies to communicate to the board of directors/advisors. This is a critical 
step that sets family businesses apart from public companies, the ability of owners, 
directors, and management to be aligned in a vision for the business.
Finally, the family system may consists of all family members, including those who 
have married into the family, their enterprise plan, and often a governance structure 
frequently referred to as the family council. The family enterprise plan outlines the 
family’s philosophy, goals, and objectives for the business as well as other related fam￾ily functions, such as community service, family gatherings, and philanthropy. The 
Family Council is often the body that represents the relevant groups of family members 
(those who work in the business and those who don’t) and plans for discussions on 
such topics as educating family members on responsible ownership, developing policies 
on family participation in the business, communications and conflict resolution, and 
the financial education necessary to understand the performance of the business.
Family Business Developmental Stages
The conventional wisdom of family business around the world is often summarized 
as “Wealth doesn’t go beyond the third generation.” This can be demonstrated with 
research that shows fewer than one-third of family businesses are able to make the 
transition of ownership into the second generation and only 12% of all family busi￾nesses survive into the third generation of ownership.108 While some have pointed to 
these statistics as proof of the dangers of family business, they need to be understood in 
the broader context of business in general. For example, the expected life of a company 
on the S&P 500 list is only ten years.109 In fact, the survival rate of companies listed 
on the Dow Jones Industrial Average from its founding in 1886 through 1996 is about 
the same as the statistics for family businesses with one-third of the original firms dis￾appearing every 25 years.110 However, it cannot be denied that family businesses face 
some unique challenges as the business and the family change over time.
The challenge of generational transition in family business is complicated by the 
separation of the principal roles of Business, Ownership, and Family. In the founding 
generation, where one or both parents own and manage the business, these roles are 
embodied in the same people. However, as parents begin to make plans to retire and 
do estate planning, they often leave their children equal ownership of the business 
they have created. Usually one of the siblings will be selected to become the next 
CEO. In such cases, the expectation is often that the successor will run the business 
“like dad” because that has been a successful model. If in fact the ownership of the 
business has transitioned from the founder(s) to their children, conflict can arise if the 
next generation attempts to lead the way the founder did. Siblings can be very quick 
to let a brother or sister know that they don’t have the same rights their parents did. 
Second-generation CEOs must learn that they have something mom and dad never 
had—shareholders.
When a sibling group owns a business together they need decision-making and 
governance processes that the founders would have found only cumbersome and 
wasteful. This is especially true when not all of the owners are employed in the busi￾ness. Issues will arise about the amount of voice an owner who is not managing the 
business should have in the way their assets are being deployed. Also, the questions 
of return on investment (ROI), shareholders’ dividends or distributions versus bonuses 
to management, and reinvestment in the business may become heated topics. When a 
business attempts to transition to a third generation of ownership (cousins), the issues 
of representation and voice in decision making can become even more explosive with￾out well-designed governance processes in place.111 The potential for conflict about the 
business can also create lasting divisions in a family unless sufficient planning takes 
place to maintain and build upon the trust relationships inherent in the family system.680 PART 7 Special Applications of Organization Development
A Parallel Planning Process
When a family owns a valuable asset, such as a business, their relationships can become 
much more complex. Deliberate planning is required to preserve the natural bond that 
exists in families and to make it possible for them to develop a shared vision for their 
mutual enterprise. Carlock and Ward describe a parallel planning process where “. . . 
viable business strategy is still the outcome, but it is an outcome shaped by the concerns 
of the family.”112 Figure 24.2 illustrates the parallel processes leading to the simultane￾ous development of a Family Enterprise Plan and a Business Strategy Plan.
Values
At the center of the family business system model is a set of core values held by the fam￾ily. Research shows that family members internalize family values, such as long-term 
reciprocity, filial obligation, and hard work for one’s family.113 They represent a key 
integration point for aligning the three subsystems listed above. However, values also 
best illustrate the differences between family and nonfamily firms.114 The complexity 
of the family business is a function of not only the interplay among the family, busi￾ness, and shareholder systems, but the different (and often opposing) values that lie at 
the core of each system. For example, family and business system values are shown in 
Table 24.2 Based upon the values a family employs in making decisions about the busi￾ness and the family they can be classified as either “Family First” or “Business First.”115

business opportunity to benefit the family. A business-first value system is based upon 
the belief that a well-managed business will produce the most benefit for the family 
now and in the future.
The family-first approach is dominated by values of security and equality. There is 
a strong inward focus on the family’s dynamics, strong goals of keeping the system in 
equilibrium (even if it is an unhealthy equilibrium), and strong interest in maintaining 
unity and support. The family’s continuity, even if the business does not prosper, pro￾duces a preference for stability and risk aversion. Relationships are most important, a 
great deal of emotion is built into decisions, and one can only be born into (or married 
into) this system. Businesses hire the person that best fits the organization’s needs 
based on knowledge, skills, and abilities; however, there is no job description to be 
a good family member. The family system places high import on family and busi￾ness privacy. Families tend to hold very close financial information, family dynamics, 
and business information; often they do not want business and financial information 
shared even within the family.
On the other hand, the business-first value system is interested in risk and equitability 
in the organization. Change, competition, results, transparency, and an outward orienta￾tion characterize business system values. Ideally, decisions are made rationally and objec￾tively, and the system is composed of an often-changing mix of people who are hired into 
(or severed from) the organization. While 85% of those family firms who have identified 
a successor say they want it to be a family member,116 the number of those family succes￾sors who would objectively fit the profile of the kind of leader the company needs based 
on its goals and strategy may be very different.
Thus, value dilemmas lie at the heart of how family businesses work. A family 
involved in a business can pursue its own objectives even when these are at odds with 
generally accepted business practices. Compensation, dividends, treatment of family 
and business expenses, performance evaluation and promotion, and the budget process 
are practices that can be influenced by family factors. Similarly, tensions in the business 
can be the result of the emotional relations in the family. Family relations are personal, 
often complex, and the result of a lifetime of positive and negative experiences. These 
relations influence business decisions overtly and covertly, as every family member is,

in part, defined by their relationship to the business. Moreover, families often structure 
their business relationships in ways that fill a void in their family relationship outside 
of the business.117 OD practitioners often have to consider such issues as follows:
Should the chronic underperforming son or daughter be retained in their business 
role and for how long?
How much conflict should the family (and nonfamily) business members have to 
endure between two siblings in rivalry?
When the business is suffering, will the family member’s significantly higher com￾pensation be addressed?
In sum, the family business system model provides an effective diagnostic tool and 
helps to explain some of the reasons why OD in family firms can be difficult.
Critical Issues in Family Business
The interaction of the family, ownership, and business subsystems, particularly at 
generational transition points, can be problematic.118 Where these systems overlap, as 
family members come together as owners both inside and outside of the business, there 
are potential interface issues, potential conflicts, and always dilemmas to be faced.
Transitions, particularly those from first to second generation and second to third gen￾eration can present even the most successful families and businesses with monumental 
changes. The change from an owner-managed business to a small group of sibling owners 
to a larger group of cousins can challenge the basic assumptions that have been the basis 
of trust and unity in decision making. It is instructive to consider each of these major 
inflection points from the perspective of three states of change:119
The present or current state—identify the key elements of the organization and 
family that will be impacted by the change.
The transition state—make the decision about where to begin the change process 
in each subsystem (family, business, ownership) from the present state to the 
desired state.
The future state—a specific statement of the goal of the change process within a 
mid-range horizon of 1–3 years.
Some of the critical change triggers common to family businesses as they grow and 
develop are the following.
Entering or Leaving the Business as a Family Member Family members often report 
choosing the family business as a place to work with comments like “It just happened” 
or “I fell into it.” Family members are a convenient workforce and may be the only 
option in the start-up phase of the founding generation but businesses that success￾fully integrate family members over the long run do not base selection practices only 
on genetics. Policies on entering the family business, options for career paths, and 
multiple points of exposure to the family firm are a few of the best practices.120 There 
must be clear roles, recruiting processes, and training and development to give every 
family member who chooses to be part of the business a clear sense that they have 
earned their place. Moreover, the business strategy and organ ization structure should 
influence selection, although only 37% of family firms report having a written strategic 
plan.121 Most importantly, every family member should feel they have the opportunity 
to “opt out” of the family business without the risk of losing the unconditional love of 
the family. To that point, many founders find it impossible to leave; close to 88% of 
family business respondents said that the family will continue to control the firm in 
five years.122 Too often a founder’s identity is largely derived from the family business

they began, and many strive to keep the status quo at all costs instead of welcoming 
change, a values dilemma for an entrepreneurial business.
Conflicts and Rivalry in the Business Conflicts and rivalries are common in family 
firms and are often the result of values dilemmas.123 If a family is relationship based 
and a business is results based, how is the family member to be evaluated? If equality 
is valued in the family system, how do you choose a business successor? Family mem￾ber compensation, roles and responsibilities, authority, and opportunity are some of 
the critical issues that ignite conflict between family members. The family system is an 
emotional one, and when placed together in a business setting, family members often 
revert back to the family roles they played growing up. Another source of conflict lies in 
the secret nature of families. Substance-abuse problems, for example, are much more 
likely to be kept quiet in the family business124 and only 62% of significant sharehold￾ers report knowing the senior generation’s share transfer intentions.125 The complexity 
of the family business system requires additional structures, practices, and processes to 
ensure open communications, conflict resolution, and business performance.
Ownership Transfer and Estate Planning In addition to distinguishing between fam￾ily and business roles, members of the family system may have a third role to play, 
that of “owner” or “shareholder.” Owners’ rights and responsibilities are different from 
family and business ones. Ownership rights typically include electing directors, creat￾ing bylaws, voting on specified major business decisions, and realizing a fair return on 
investment. Typical responsibilities include making informed decisions, creating and 
keeping agreements, respecting limits of authority, and developing business competen￾cies to adequately fulfill their role as a shareholder.126
One value dilemma evidenced in the owner arena has to do with “equal vs. equitable.” 
When ownership transfer issues arise, members of the shareholder group often struggle 
between transferring family business stock to members of the entire family versus only 
those family members who are active in the business. The former option can create chal￾lenges between inside-owners, who work in the business, and outside- owners, who do 
not. Owners who earn their living from the business and are responsible for the success 
of the business often feel that outside-owners do not deserve any return for their invest￾ment because they inherited their shares.
Sometimes families attempt to resolve this dilemma by “equalizing” the total estate. 
For example, a family with two active and two inactive business members of the next 
generation all receive an equal share of the total estate, yet the two active members 
receive 100% of the business assets and the estate is “equalized” by transferring more 
of the nonbusiness assets to the inactive siblings. While this may seem equal at the 
time of transfer it can lead to future disputes if either the business or the other assets 
significantly outperform the other. Moreover, most business founders tend to reinvest 
everything in their business and may not be able to match the value of the business 
with other assets. Others attempt to avoid conflict over the business by establishing two 
classes of stock and leaving voting shares only to heirs who are working in the business. 
However, the long-term prospects for a family business where owners of a significant 
portion of the business have no voice in how their assets are utilized are not good.
No amount of planning by the previous generation can replace the need for the 
current owners to develop trust through a common vision for their business and an 
appreciation of the interest and needs of each other.
Selecting a New Leader The vast majority of family firms, 85% according to one 
survey, choose successors that are family members.127 In addition, 39% of family firms 
will change leadership within the next five years, and of those, 42% have not chosen 
a successor. Many families avoid the topic altogether due to its emotional intensity.128
Some of the key reasons include a founder/owner who won’t “let go” of the business, 684 PART 7 Special Applications of Organization Development
the lack of competency in the next generation, rivalry among siblings for key lead￾ership positions, succession timing, incongruent business visions of the current and 
successor generation, and pressures from various family branches. Forward-thinking 
family business leaders spend time to identify the optimum type of leader needed to 
take the business into the future. This can happen only after creating a shared busi￾ness vision and strategy and then identifying the best leadership candidates. Once the 
current leaders have accepted the need for change, decisions can be made as to where 
the potential candidates will come from. Will the next leader be a family or nonfamily 
member? If the choice is the former (and it typically is), what mentoring and develop￾ment will ensure the family candidate is successful? Business is about risk and change, 
yet family is about stability and status quo, which explains part of the reason why 
choosing a new leader creates difficulties. Succession is marked by a shift of power and 
influence, followed by a period of shared power,129 and for many leaders the proposed 
transition is met with great resistance.
Business Growth and Family Wealth As noted earlier, most family businesses strug￾gle to transition the generations. Absence of successors, family assets too concentrated 
in the business, family conflict, passive versus active owners, empire building, lack of 
professional management, or the absence of a shared vision and sustainable business 
model can all contribute to a family business’s demise. When the business fails, there 
is little chance for the family’s wealth to grow.
To grow the business and the family’s wealth requires careful thought and stra￾tegic planning.130 The company must move from an entrepreneurial business to a 
professionally managed firm, develop governance structures, formalize systems and 
processes, and recruit talent (from inside and outside of the family). Owners must 
continually develop assets independent of the business. As the business grows, so do 
liquidity options such as venture capital, debt or equity financing, internal stock sale, 
sale of the company, or employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs).131
OD Interventions in Family Business System
For a consultant working with family businesses, complexity is the norm, a result of 
the interconnectedness of the family, business, and shareholder systems. Necessarily 
addressing the entire family business system is a key difference from the work of a 
nonfamily business practitioner. The skill set required for a family business advisor 
is comprehensive and includes OD competencies (e.g., behavioral sciences, systems 
thinking, strategy, and organization design), family systems knowledge (e.g., life cycle 
development, birth-order issues, and family dynamics), conflict resolution skills, and 
family meeting facilitation. In addition, the family business consultant should acquire 
working knowledge in the areas of estate and financial planning, legal forms of orga￾nization, exit strategies, family philanthropy, family offices, financial analysis, and 
multidisciplinary (professional) teaming.
Perhaps the key to the success of a family business consultant is the ability to estab￾lish a trusting, caring relationship with the client system, to accurately surface the issues 
and dynamics at the heart of the family business dilemmas, and to effect positive, sus￾tainable change. Consultants must know their own values, ethics, goals, and personal 
development areas, including their beliefs about families and families in business and 
insight into their own family system issues and dynamics. Such awareness increases the 
family business consultant’s ability to handle issues that arise in a family-run business.
In addition, given the many demands and diversity of the family business system, 
it can be beneficial to use a team-consulting approach in certain cases. For example, a 
60-year-old founder may relate best to a senior advisor perceived as an “equal,” while 
the younger next-generation leaders may connect better with someone closer to their 
age who has worked with other clients with similar experiences. If significant conflicts CHAPTER 24 Organization Development in Nonindustrial Settings 685
exist in the family, an advisor with expertise and qualifications in individual and family 
therapy may be a valuable asset to the team.
Entering and Contracting The special entry and contracting issues involved in family 
businesses include the need to quickly create a safe emotional environment, asking 
sensitive questions related to the family systems early in the engagement, getting per￾mission to recontract as issues emerge, getting permission to work with other family 
members, and being clear about the requirements of collaboration. Unlike nonfamily 
firms, the “client” in a family business is the entire family business system. The mission 
of an OD practitioner dictates a systems approach, so any relationships begun in this 
phase must integrate family issues around the business issues. The contract will typi￾cally be with the major shareholders of the family firm; therefore additional efforts are 
required up front to ensure buy-in and collaboration in the process. Trust must be estab￾lished early on for the rest of the process to have a chance of moving successfully.
Diagnosing the Organization Diagnosing the family-run organization requires the 
particular tasks and skills necessary to understand the family system in addition to the 
business system. “Presenting” issues and problems that appear to be business related 
often require careful probing and unbundling to get an accurate picture of “what is 
happening.” Trust building, begun in the entry phase, continues in the diagnosis stage 
by bringing the family together for an orientation meeting. This meeting, often the 
first time the family has congregated around business issues, helps them to understand 
they are not alone in the dilemmas they face, affords time for establishing trust within 
the family and between family members and the OD practitioner, and builds com￾munications skills. Tools to help gather data include confidential interviews of a range 
of stakeholders, individual and business profiles, and a genogram, which is a visual 
representation of the family history, similar to an organization chart.132 The genogram 
enables the practitioner to understand the intergenerational dynamics and to analyze 
how the family came to be who they are by identifying the patterns and issues that 
have been passed down. The individual, confidential interview is perhaps the most 
powerful tool for gathering data and intervening in the system. It is critical to assess 
not only the pressing business issues, but those that are in the family system and the 
shareholder arena, as well as determining what boundaries exist between the subsys￾tems, including how communications flow.
Key questions for understanding the family business system include the following:
Describe what long-term “personal success” means to you and your own personal 
vision of the future.
What is most important to your family?
Tell me about the best time that you have had with the family. Looking at the 
entire experience, recall a time when you felt most alive, most involved, most 
excited. What made it a great experience? Describe the event in detail.
Describe what “business success” for your company means to you. For example, 
what would your company look like if it were operating at its very best? What is 
getting in the way of that success? What is your role?
As a shareholder in this business, what do you want most from your investment?
How much agreement (alignment) exists between the family, the business l eaders, 
and the shareholders about the vision, values, policies, goals, and strategy for the 
family business?
Feedback and Planning Providing feedback to family business members often 
includes a one- to two-day off-site session to review a “discussion guide” (as opposed to 
a completed document) that summarizes key issues, priorities, and recommendations. 
This session should be the second time the group has come together and can be viewed

as an opportunity to facilitate the practices of good communications, group decision￾making, and conflict resolution. The more the practitioner can help those in the system 
build competency in these areas, the stronger and more sustainable the family business 
system will be. Among the typical issues found in diagnostic results and the discus￾sion guides are lack of role clarity; lack of shared vision for the family, the sharehold￾ers, and the business; a dearth of communications; conflict between family members; 
and systems, processes, and structure deficiencies. The goal for the meeting is for the 
family to identify and agree on key issues, priorities, and next steps. Building good 
communication practices (e.g., regular family meetings) and resolving conflict are two 
common starting points for work with family firms. These interventions are good places 
to begin to “name” the particular value dilemmas inherent in the particular system.
Table 24.3 identifies the most common interventions in family business systems 
today.

with a family business system as many family business issues stem from a lack 
of alignment around shared vision and values. Members of each subsystem—the 
business, family, and shareholders—need to dialogue and create a shared view of 
the future and an appropriate set of goals. In reality, there is a good amount of 
overlap between members of each subsystem so the family business OD practitio￾ner must continually clarify roles, responsibilities, and boundaries. Strategic busi￾ness planning is appropriate only after the family and shareholder subsystems have 
aligned on a set of values, goals, and shared vision for the family business. In addi￾tion, the process should be an iterative one with open communications between 
the appropriate family and shareholder governance structures.
Systems. System interventions include traditional OD approaches in the business, 
such as human resource policies and procedures, technical operations, information/
management systems, and organization culture. Many family firms can benefit from 
formalizing their business systems, including performance management, succession 
planning, leadership development, rewards, core process improvement, information 
technology implementation, and recruiting. Family and shareholder systems tend to 
be less formal. Interventions in the family subsystem can focus on communications, 
education, family succession, compensation, and philanthropy while shareholder 
agreements, estate planning, ownership succession, and communications are appro￾priate in the shareholder subsystem.
Structure. Governance structures are necessary for all three subsystems so that 
effective communications and coordination can occur among these complex sys￾tems. The business system benefits from a professional management team, led by 
a qualified CEO who reports to a board of advisors or board of directors. Outside 
board members should be roughly balanced with inside board members; the for￾mer should be skilled at earning the trust of the family and working with mem￾bers of both the senior and the junior generation.133 The shareholders’ subsystem 
requires its own governance structure—a shareholders’ forum. Here, active and 
inactive shareholders can meet to develop their goals, review the performance of 
their investment, and make important decisions about family ownership. Finally, 
the governance structure for the family—the family council—is a place for the 
family to plan for their future, to nurture and develop its members, and to continu￾ally determine to what extent the business will be able to fulfill their needs.
Process. Process interventions can be very effective with family firms. This is espe￾cially true if the source or resolution of the client’s problem is unknown and the 
nature of the problem is such that the client would benefit from involvement in 
its diagnosis.134 Process interventions in the business system include coaching both 
the founder/current leader and the next-generation leader, team building, conflict 
resolution, and board development. Typical family process interventions include 
conflict resolution, communications and family meeting facilitation, and family 
charter development. The shareholder subsystem requires process interventions 
in the areas of forum development, communications/boundary management, and 
conflict resolution.
Implementing and Evaluating Change There are various levels of consultant involve￾ment in implementation. It is important to understand where involvement will sup￾port intervention success, where organization members can be “coached,” and where 
members can take primary responsibility for implementation. High involvement is 
almost always needed in the first stages of implementation, where activities typically 
include establishing goals and milestones, creating a shared vision, establishing bound￾aries for family and business roles, and facilitating productive communications. Also 
in the early stages, the OD practitioner can communicate the importance of establish￾ing and keeping to an implementation timetable and meeting regularly to resolve the

many family–business interface issues that arise. Once the implementation phase is 
well under way, a six-month or annual retreat can help to assess change process and 
effectiveness, reconnect with the family, and create plans around new family, busi￾ness, and/or ownership transitions. The continual transitions that occur in a family 
business provide a unique opportunity for an OD practitioner to become a long-term, 
trusted advisor.
SUMMARY
Traditionally, the published material in organization development has focused on 
applications in industrial organizations. This chapter presented broad applications of 
OD in nonindustrial organizations, such as health care, schools, government agencies, 
and family firms. The results of these change programs to date suggest that OD is not 
only being applied successfully but also needs a greater range of customized diagnostic 
methods and interventions, and it must be clear about the values in use when it is 
applied to nonindustrial settings.
Jean Ann Larson pointed out how dramatic changes in the health care industry are 
affecting the practice of OD in that setting. She noted how changes in the nature of 
the health care product and the way it is delivered, how technology is being adapted, 
and how health care is paid for are altering fundamentally the industry’s structure and 
making it more difficult to identify the target of change. To be effective under these 
new conditions, OD practitioners will be under considerable pressure to demonstrate 
their competence in areas such as culture, alliances and networks, and organization 
design. Change projects will likely be focused on integrating a diverse set of previously 
uncoordinated stakeholders. They will be more reactive than proactive; more solution 
oriented than people oriented.
Linda Purrington and Paul Sparks described the decline of the traditional model of 
education, one that had been based on principles of industrial organization. They sug￾gested that close public scrutiny from multiple stakeholders and shifts in technology 
and society are demanding a new model, one that leverages technology and shifts the 
goals of the system to learning. Despite recent failed attempts at reform, a variety of 
OD programs hold great promise to shift the focus of education to the development of 
learning communities.
Ray Patchett’s section suggested that the public sector is more bureaucratic and 
adheres more strongly to bureaucratic norms than does the private sector. Thus, dif￾ferences between the two sectors stem largely from differences in underlying value 
structures that encourage people to behave in different ways. He indicated that many 
of the differences between the public and the private sectors may be a matter of 
degree, rather than kind. Further, the public sector has multiple access by multiple 
decision makers, which can make it difficult to know who is really at the top of the 
organization. Thus, OD interventions in the public sector focus more on technostruc￾tural interventions, such as workflow design and structure, than on process-oriented 
interventions, such as team building. Despite these differences, OD interventions in 
the public sector have an admirable track record of success, nearly equal to the success 
rate in industrial settings.
Otis Baskin presented a family business system model to underscore the important 
differences between traditional organizations and family businesses. The family, busi￾ness, and ownership subsystems hold distinct and often-conflicting values that make 
diagnosis and intervention in family businesses complex. The model also served as a 
diagnostic framework to guide inquiry into a family business. Effective OD interventions 
must account for these three subsystems, the relationships among them, and be sensi￾tive to the family interpersonal dynamics that are likely to pervade the entire effort.CHAPTER 24 Organization Development in Nonindustrial Settings 689

In updating his OD bibliography (http://www.cba.bgsu.edu/mod/html/od_ bibliography.
html) for 2005, Glenn Varney noted that much of the recent writings in OD had 
focused more on the status of the field than on evaluations of practice or research 
on the processes of change.1 In support of that observation, reviews of the literature, 
conversations within Internet listservs, and the diversity in OD education and training 
opportunities suggest three trends occurring within OD— characterized as traditional, 
pragmatic, and scholarly.2
 Each trend has a different vision of what OD can and should 
be, and although they are presented separately, they are not mutually exclusive or 
independent. On the contrary, the future of OD will no doubt emerge from their inte￾gration. Figure 25.1 summarizes the trends and their likely implications for the future 
of OD.
Traditional
The first trend has to do with increasing calls for a return to OD’s traditional values and 
practices. Championed by the National Training Laboratories (NTL) and others, tradi￾tionalists argue that OD should be driven by long-established values of human potential, 
equality, trust, and collaboration. The major objective of OD should be to promulgate 
these root values through interventions that humanize work, organizations, and soci￾ety; help employees balance work and family life; promote diversity and spirituality at 
the workplace; and champion the self-actualization of organization members.3
 Thus, 
traditionalists propose that OD should do what is “right” by assuring that organizations 
promote positive social change and corporate citizenship.
Future Directions in Organization 
Development
The field of organization development contin￾ues to grow. New methods and interventions 
are being applied, more complex and rigorous 
research is being conducted, and organizations 
from more diverse countries and cultures are 
becoming involved. Because so much change 
has occurred in a relatively brief period, pre￾dicting the future of OD is risky if not foolhardy. 
On the other hand, the field is also maturing 
and it is useful to look at the forces influenc￾ing how OD is likely to evolve. This knowledge 
can enable OD practitioners, researchers, and 
managers to more readily affect a relevant 
OD future. The chapter first identifies three 
trends within the OD field that are pushing it 
toward different futures. The implications of 
these trends are discussed. The chapter then 
describes trends in the larger context within 
which OD operates, including economic, work￾force, technology, and organization trends. It 
concludes with a discussion of how these trends 
are likely to influence future OD practice.
25694 PART 7 Special Applications of Organization Development
A strong focus on process interventions also characterizes the traditional trend. 
OD’s key purpose, according to this view, is to ensure that organizational processes are 
transparent, possess integrity, treat people with dignity, and serve diverse stakeholders. 
Thus, OD’s primary goal is to help organizations create such processes; whether they 
subsequently lead to performance outcomes is of secondary importance.
Pragmatic
The second trend within OD is related to increasing demands for professionalization 
of the field and an emphasis on relevance. Championed by the change management 
practices at large consulting firms and some OD professional associations, pragmatists 
argue that OD practitioners should be certified like most other professionals.4
 This 
drive to professionalize OD is in response to a growing number of people marketing 
themselves as OD practitioners without any formal training or education in the field, 
as well as a lack of consistency in applying OD’s core theories, skills, and interventions. 
As a result, distinguishing between qualified and unqualified OD practitioners can be 
a difficult challenge for organizations, and professionalization of the field can help to 
remedy that problem.5
To become a profession, according to pragmatists, OD should require certification 
of members, create a common body of knowledge, define minimum levels of com￾petencies, and institute other regulatory infrastructure. Certification would create 
boundaries between who is (and is not) an OD professional and what is (and is not) 
OD practice.

The pragmatic trend is also distinguished by an emphasis on change technologies, typi￾cally under the banner of “change management.” In contrast to OD’s “soft” reputation, 
change management is viewed as a highly relevant and applied practice, much like medi￾cine, engineering, or accounting.6
 It focuses on helping organizations implement change 
and adapt to turbulent environments. Relevance, a minor chord among traditionalists, is 
a major theme among pragmatists, who value the performance outcomes of OD work. 
Thus, process interventions are not seen as ends in themselves but as means for imple￾menting change and achieving the desired results.
Scholarly
The third trend within OD is connected with the increasing number of people making 
research contributions to our understanding of change. Championed by universities 
and applied research centers, such as USC’s Center for Effective Organizations and 
MIT’s Society of Organization Learning, scholars propose a “research agenda” for OD 
that includes (1) how multiple contexts and levels of analysis affect organizational 
change; (2) the inclusion of time, history, process, and action in theories of change; (3) 
the link between change processes and organization performance; (4) the comparative 
analysis of international and cross-cultural OD interventions; (5) the study of receptiv￾ity, customization, sequencing, pace, and episodic versus continuous change processes; 
and (6) the partnership between scholars and practitioners in studying organizational 
change.7
The scholarly perspective focuses on understanding, predicting, and controlling 
change. It is far less concerned about how OD is defined, what its values are, how it is 
practiced, or whether an OD practitioner is involved except as potential explanations 
for change success. OD is just one of several ways organizations can be changed. Unlike 
traditionalists and pragmatists, scholars are concerned with creating valid knowledge, 
and with generalizing conclusions about how change occurs, how it is triggered, under 
what conditions it works well, and so on. Similar to the traditional and pragmatic 
trends, however, the scholarly trend is connected to the actors involved in change; its 
favored methodology is action research but from a more distant and detached perspec￾tive than the other two trends.
Implications for OD’s Future
Those three trends are likely to have important consequences for OD’s future. In the 
short term, advocates of each view will likely continue on their separate paths with 
periodic and perhaps intense conflicts among them. In the longer term, however, there 
should be increasing attempts at reconciling these differences and generating a more 
integrative view of OD.
OD Will Have More Conflicts in the Short Term Current views and debates about 
OD values and professionalization are likely to continue at least in the near term. The 
traditional and pragmatic trends hold different and often-conflicting views of how the 
field should evolve. Traditionalists fear that OD is becoming too corporate and may 
unwittingly collude with powerful stakeholders to promote goals that are inconsistent 
with OD’s social responsibility and humanistic values. For example, corporate strate￾gies can concentrate wealth and ignore cultural diversity. Technology can isolate people 
and alienate them. The traditionalists, therefore, advocate for a stronger focus on the 
central values of the field. Pragmatists, on the other hand, worry that relying too heav￾ily on traditional values will reinforce OD’s “touchy-feely” orientation. They argue that 
focusing on human potential exclusively will doom OD to irrelevance in today’s highly 
competitive organizations. Thus, in the short term, the battle over values within the 
field is likely to continue.696 PART 7 Special Applications of Organization Development
Symbolic of the struggle, no fewer than three formal projects are under way to 
clarify OD’s values. Each effort is championed by a different institutional sponsor, 
relies on a different set of OD practitioners, and argues that their results will clarify 
this important issue for the field. The ongoing conflict in the field is therefore likely to 
continue and may become even more intense as additional values, such as ecological 
sustainability and economic equality, enter the OD field.
OD is also likely to face more disagreement over professionalization. The debate 
over values discussed above demonstrates how difficult it will be to gain agreement 
about standards, competencies, enforcement mechanisms, and oversight. Unless a 
groundswell of support for a common set of OD values emerges, judgments about 
qualifications will likely become caught up in conflicts between the traditional and the 
pragmatic perspectives. Several prior attempts to professionalize the field or to accredit 
practitioners have had limited success, and provide ample evidence of the difficulty of 
resolving such differences.
OD Will Become More Integrated in the Long Term Despite the conflicts likely to 
continue in the short run, there is considerable common ground among the diverse 
trends within OD, and the emergence of a more integrated view of the field seems 
likely in the long term. For example, both the traditional and the pragmatic trends 
agree that applying behavioral science to organizations can improve effectiveness and 
increase member satisfaction. Both trends believe that knowledge and skill should be 
transferred to a client system, and all three trends believe that a body of theory and 
practice underlie the process of change in organizations.
Given OD’s history, its long-term future is likely to be some blend of practitioner 
values in use (traditional trend), professional change practice (pragmatic trend), and 
change theory (scholarly trend). The field is not likely to be completely pragmatic and 
ignore its values base; there is little likelihood that it will return to its purely traditional 
roots and be irrelevant to business; and the subject of change is too important and 
personal to be left to research alone. A more limited integration is also problematic. 
A pragmatic and research-driven OD would be cold and impersonal; a traditional and 
research-driven field would be naïve and irrelevant to economic realities; and a tradi￾tional and pragmatic-driven OD would be intuitive and non-cumulative. An integra￾tion of the three trends, on the other hand, will assure that OD has moral purpose, 
drives sustainable bottom lines, and represents a healthy balance of art and science.
A set of integrated values, including participation and effectiveness but recognizing 
the tension between them, will drive the traditional and pragmatic trends to exploit 
the common ground in theory and practice. For example, the theories of change 
underlying traditional action research; positive scholarship and practice; contemporary 
approaches to change, such as network models, complexity, and chaos theories; and 
the evolution of underorganized systems can be integrated. The practical benefits of 
traditional objective approaches and the traditional values reflected in a social con￾structionist view hold promise for a new view of OD.
This integrated view will challenge the field to redefine existing views of work, 
competition, culture, and organizations. OD cannot view systems only as objects with 
inertia, structure, resistance, and permanence, but as social processes produced, main￾tained, and changed through conversations that are flexible, aspirational, and change￾able.8
 A positive view of organizations and their members’ potential aligns well with 
the traditional trend, and it supports values of basic human rights, social responsibility, 
democracy, and ecological sustainability. This view of organizations also supports the 
pragmatic trend; it recognizes the importance of economic viability, the time value of 
activity, and the opportunities that growth conveys. If carefully applied, an integrated 
objective and socially constructed perspective can be an influential voice in OD’s 
future.CHAPTER 25 Future Directions in Organization Development 697
TRENDS IN THE CONTEXT OF ORGANIZATION 
DEVELOPMENT
The field of OD is evolving, but so too is the context within which OD is applied. 
As summarized in Figure 25.2, several interrelated trends are affecting the context 
within which OD will be applied in the near future. They concern various aspects of 
the economy, the workforce, technology, and organizations. In some cases, the trends 
will directly affect OD practice. Technology trends, such as Internet portals, voice over 
the Internet, and wireless networks, will no doubt influence how OD practitioners 
communicate with organization members, facilitate teams, and manage change. Other 
trends, such as the increasing concentration of wealth, represent important contex￾tual forces that will indirectly affect OD through their interaction with other trends.9
The Economy
Researchers and futurists have described a variety of economic scenarios, and there is 
substantial agreement that the world’s economy is in the midst of a transition from 
the industrial age that characterized much of the twentieth century.10 Although these 
scenarios differ in their particulars, they all fit under the rubric of globalization, and 
many of the same trends are identified as drivers, including technology, workforce, and 
organization, which will be discussed separately.

The fall of the Berlin Wall, the end of Apartheid, the breakup of the former Soviet 
Union, the creation of the European Union, terrorist attacks in many different countries, 
and the emergence of the Chinese and Indian economies are key events in the transition 
to a global economy. Organizations from around the world are increasingly able to shift 
their manufacturing from high- to low-labor-cost countries, execute international merg￾ers and acquisitions, and build worldwide service businesses. Today, almost any product 
or service can be made, transported, and bought anywhere in the world. Globalization 
can help companies reduce costs, gain resources, expand markets, and develop new 
products and practices more quickly.
The emergence of a global economy is well under way, but the promise and ratio￾nalization of that process is far from complete.11 The initial steps toward globalization 
have fueled real price decreases in many consumer products, provided employment for 
people in less-developed nations, and driven revenue growth in a variety of industries. 
However, the transition to a global economy is for the most part unmanaged, and there 
is increasing concern over its social and ecological consequences.12 This raises trouble￾some questions about three key issues: cultural diversity, income distribution, and ecological 
sustainability.
First, transitioning to a global economy is a complex and daunting process that 
involves organizations, technology, people, and governments. The role and function 
of national governments and the importance of cultural diversity in the process is not 
well understood. There are few generally accepted guidelines. On the one hand, some 
economists argue that globalization is good for countries and cultures.13 They cite 
numerous examples of how music, art, political thought, technology, and other arti￾facts of culture have crossed boundaries and enriched people’s experiences.
Others argue that governments must face the difficult choice of preserving or 
sacrificing their culture. Friedman notes that cultural preservation may come at the 
expense of participation in the global economy while greater economic success may 
depend on cultural sacrifices.14 For example, the Chinese government is trying dili￾gently to preserve its cultural and political underpinnings while facing a rapid influx 
of capitalist goods and services,15 and many other developing nations face pressures 
to move to a Western capitalism model despite questions as to whether it is appropri￾ate for their cultures.16 Organizations implementing global strategies (Chapter 23), for 
example, prefer standardized approaches because the economic logic of this strategy 
admits to little practical incentive to account for cultural or governmental differences. 
Pursuing both cultural preservation and economic participation is possible, but it is 
a complex task. The short-term financial benefits often appear much larger than the 
long-term social consequences, and the required leadership and management capabili￾ties are not widely available. The decisions governments make to resolve this dilemma 
will dramatically shape the character of the global economy.
Second, globalization of the economy is closely related to an increasing concen￾tration of wealth in relatively few individuals, corporations, and nations. The CIA’s 
report, Global Trends, 2015, concluded that globalization will create “an even wider gap 
between regional winners and losers than exists today. [Its] evolution will be rocky, 
marked by chronic volatility and a widening economic divide . . . deepening economic 
stagnation, political instability, and cultural alienation. [It] will foster political, ethnic, 
ideological, and religious extremism, along with the violence that often accompanies 
it.”17 Consider the following:
U.S. Census data confirms that the share of total income accounted for by the 
top 20% of households increased from about 43% to over 51% between 1975 
and 2005, while the bottom 20% of households saw their share drop from 4% 
to 3%.18
•CHAPTER 25 Future Directions in Organization Development 699
Using a conservative measure of CEO pay, the Economic Policy Institute estimates 
that in 2005 the average CEO in the United States earned 262 times the pay of the 
average worker, the second highest ratio in the 40 years of their data collection. 
(Other estimates have put the ratio as high as 431:1 for 2004.) To put this in per￾spective, a CEO earned more in a day than the average worker did in a year.19
The 793 billionaires in 2006 represent an increase of 103 people between 2005 and 
2006. Representing about 0.00001% of the world’s population, their net worth of 
$2.6 trillion accounts for about 19.5% of the U.S. gross domestic product.20
Of the world’s 6.2 billion, 5.2 billion live in low- and moderate-income countries 
and survive on about $3 a day.21
The concentration of wealth may be a natural outcome of capitalism facing imperfectly 
competitive markets, but it can also contribute to misallocation of resources, environ￾mental degradation, and short-term thinking.22 For example, the financial markets’ 
focus on quarterly earnings can skew decision-making criteria to delay preventive 
maintenance or safety initiatives, to postpone implementation of necessary environ￾mental-protection equipment, or to forego important long-term capital investments. 
The concentration of wealth can also contribute to social conflict driven by fears that 
the wealthy will act in their own self-interest at the expense of those who are finan￾cially less fortunate. The recent history of the WTO provides visible examples, such as 
the cancellation of the 2003 meetings in Cancun, Mexico, because developing nations 
banded together against developed countries who were accused of not listening to 
requests for modifications in trade agreements.
Third, there are increasingly clear warnings that the ecosystem can no longer be 
treated as a factor of production, and that success cannot be defined as the accumu￾lation of wealth and material goods at the expense of the environment. There are 
strong pressures to fuel economic growth, for example, by exploring and developing 
oil fields in sensitive and protected areas such as the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. 
Yet, sport-utility vehicle (SUV) demand remains strong despite concerns over safety 
and low gas mileage. If SUVs complied with the same fuel-economy standards as 
ordinary cars, the United States would save 1 million barrels of oil a day, more than 
the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge could produce at peak volumes.23 These concerns 
arise in part from the proliferation of capitalism, but also from the growing realiza￾tion that free and open markets can have negative unintended consequences for the 
global ecosystem.
The conclusions from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change suggest 
that industrialization is not a controversial but a probable cause of global warming.24
Several traditional organizations, such as BP and Royal Dutch/Shell, are reversing 
long-held opinions about their contribution to environmental decay by setting aggres￾sive goals to reduce greenhouse gases.25 Unfortunately, many developing economies, 
including China, the Philippines, and Mexico, continue to operate with loose environ￾mental controls. As a result, there are more calls for change in the values underlying 
capitalism—from consumption to investment, from open to mindful markets, and 
from wealth accumulation as an end in itself to an examination of the return on living 
capital.26 Some observers note that such value shifts are already under way in many 
nations and organizations. For example, traditional business models that assume labor 
scarcity and natural resource abundance are being tempered by models that empha￾size the abundance of knowledge and the scarcity of natural resources. A handful of 
companies, including IKEA, Interface, Honda, S. C. Johnson, and Hewlett-Packard, 
have altered their operations and practices radically to reduce emissions, waste, 
and environmental degradation and to increase sustainability, profits, and customer 
satisfaction.

The Workforce
The workforce is becoming more diverse, educated, and contingent. Chapter 18 
documented the diversity trend and suggested that organizations, whether they oper￾ate primarily in their home country or abroad, will need to develop policies and operat￾ing styles that embrace the changing cultural, ethnic, gender, and age diversity of the 
workforce.
The workforce is also becoming more educated. The 2006 U.S. Census data, for 
example, report that 84.1% of adults over 25 years of age have completed high 
school and that 27% have a bachelor’s or higher degree. Both numbers represent 
similar proportions compared to 2002 but significant increases compared to 2000. 
A more educated workforce is likely to demand higher wages, more involvement in 
the decision-making process, and continued investment in knowledge and skills. For 
example, the rate of change in information systems technology requires IT profession￾als to continually update their knowledge and skills to remain competent. In response, 
organizations are increasing their training and management development budgets 
significantly.27 Many organizations, such as Motorola, Capital One, Boeing, and Harley 
Davidson, have invested in corporate universities and corporate–university partner￾ships, and many others have policies outlining the minimum hours of technical and 
managerial training that each employee will receive yearly.
Finally, the continued high rate of downsizings, reengineering efforts, and mergers 
and acquisitions described in Chapters 14 and 19 is forcing the workforce to become 
more contingent and less loyal. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that contingent 
and “alternative arrangement” workers, including temporary and contract employees, 
freelancers, independent professionals, and consultants, made up between 12.4% and 
14.8% of the workforce in 2005.28 The implicit psychological contract that governs 
relationships between employers and employees is being rewritten with new assump￾tions about long-term employment and rewards in exchange for commitment and 
loyalty. For example, a study by the National Association of Temporary and Staffing 
Services found that 90% of companies use temporary help.29 Other studies have sug￾gested that the personnel supply services industry, about 90% of which is involved in 
providing contingent employees, will be among the top five fastest-growing industries. 
One article noted that the contingent staffing industry doubled in size between 2002 
and 2007 and would grow to about $200 billion in 2010.30
Technology By almost any measure, information technology is a significant and 
increasingly common fact of life. An estimated 150.9 million worldwide Internet users 
in 1998 grew to 605.6 million in 2002. 31 In 2007, according to an Internet World Stats 
estimate, more than 1.24 billion people were on the Internet, and of those, 37% were 
in Asia.32 The Internet is the backbone of a global economy, and although the technol￾ogy sector has suffered financial setbacks, few people doubt its future importance.
At the core of information technology is E-commerce, an economy that knows no 
boundaries.33 E-commerce involves using automated teller machines, buying games on 
your cell phone, buying and selling products and services over the Internet, and selling 
advertising space. This range of activities makes estimating the size of the E-commerce 
market difficult. For example, one study estimated that worldwide online retail sales 
grew 22% to $143.2 billion for 2005 while the U.S. Census Bureau estimated that U.S. 
online retail sales for 2006 grew about 20% to $119 billion.34
Two types of E-commerce seem particularly relevant to OD’s future: business-to￾consumer and business-to-business. The business-to-consumer market garners much 
attention and awareness because it is how the public participates in E-commerce. This 
market, which includes E-tailers such as Amazon.com, eBay.com, and Fandango.
com, is expected to grow in the United States from $172 billion in 2005 to over 
$329 billion by 2010.35 In these businesses, OD must help to create and implement CHAPTER 25 Future Directions in Organization Development 701
novel business models. Dell Computer, for instance, sells custom-made computers 
to consumers and businesses, but it started out as a mail-order company advertising 
in the back of magazines. More than 25% of its computer sales come through the 
Internet. The shift in organization structures, labor skill sets, work designs, and work 
processes in the transformation from a mail-order business to an E-commerce leader 
represents the kind of change that many organizations will face and the challenges 
OD practitioners must meet.
The organizational issues in the business-to-business market are even more com￾plex. A good example of the implications and potential of this market is the global 
automobile industry’s creation of an online store. In February 2000, the major 
automakers jointly addressed escalating costs and gross inefficiencies of their supply 
chain to create Covisint, a new business that leveraged the power and potential of 
the Internet to solve industry-specific business problems in real time. Today, Covisint 
supports over 266,000 users, representing more than 30,000 organizations in over 
96 countries in the global automotive industry. In addition, Covisint has moved into 
the health care industry and supports over 15,000 users, representing more than 450 
North American health systems, commercial payers, physician groups/practices, home 
health agencies, third-party administrators, extended care facilities and home medi￾cal equipment providers. Covisint migrates an entire industry’s supply chain onto the 
Internet and reengineers radically the way businesses interact with each other. Web￾based transactions are replacing the inefficient phone, mail, and face-to-face sales call 
processes that dominated these industries.
In addition to providing the infrastructure for E-commerce, technology is also chang￾ing and enabling a variety of organizational processes. New technologies, such as SAP 
or PeopleSoft, drive changes in how information and work processes are coordinated 
and managed; they also require modification in the way productivity is measured. For 
example, the implementation of enterprise resource systems and supply-chain man￾agement programs must integrate with existing work processes and the competencies 
of organization members. This requires adjustments in the entire sociotechnical system 
and how it interfaces with customers, suppliers, regulators, and other stakeholders.
Finally, we are gaining a clearer picture of the way technology affects productivity. 
For example, for years, economists were puzzled by a “productivity paradox.” Despite 
a 30-year, $2 trillion investment in computers and technology, productivity rose very 
slowly during the 1980s and early 1990s. But in 1999, productivity rose 2.9% in the 
United States (and 5% in the last six months of 1999), nearly twice the 1.5% average 
annual gains seen since the early 1970s. The biggest gains were in manufacturing, but 
service businesses such as transportation, trade, and finance also started to see a payoff 
from new technology investments. This productivity lag apparently resulted from the 
relatively long time it took for organizations to adopt the new technology and to learn 
how to apply it.36 For example, Countrywide Home Loans, one of the largest mortgage 
lenders in the United States, began experimenting with technology solutions in the late 
1980s. The benefits of technology investment did not pay off until a 1997 implementa￾tion of an automated information system in its customer service center helped reduce 
the average cost per call from $4 to less than $0.60 on more than 20,000 calls per day. 
The increased productivity has not cost jobs; Countrywide nearly doubled its workforce 
between 1996 and 1999.
Organizations
The final trend likely to shape OD’s future involves the increasingly networked and 
knowledge-based nature of organizations. The interventions described in this book 
help organizations become more streamlined and flexible, more capable of improving 
themselves continuously in response to economic and other trends, and more effective. 702 PART 7 Special Applications of Organization Development
A large proportion of organizations are not aware of these practices, however, and 
still others resist applying them.37 Despite the attention to them in the business press, 
only a small percentage of organizations use self-managed work teams, are organized 
into networks, successfully manage strategic alliances, or have organization learning 
programs. But these organizations are harbingers of the future, and they will invent 
entirely new, entrepreneurial structures capable of exploiting new ideas and technolo￾gies quickly.
Clearly, organizations are becoming more networked. As explained in Chapters 14 
and 19, network structures rely on collaborative strategies and allow single organizations 
to partner with other organizations to develop, manufacture, and distribute goods and 
services.38 More than any other organization form, networks hold the promise of real￾izing the economic opportunities presented by globalization without the negative social 
consequences of large multinational corporations.39 Large organizations that gain econo￾mies of scale in manufacturing, distribution, and marketing can also become rigid and 
slow, and indifferent to unintended social and ecological consequences. These latter 
outcomes can be disastrous in today’s rapidly changing environments and cannot be 
easily remedied in the future. Networks, on the other hand, enable small organizations 
to access the advantages of scale and scope traditionally reserved for large firms. Small, 
focused firms that perform particular tasks with excellence can align with organizations 
that have complementary resources and expertise. These networks are highly adaptable 
and can disband and reform along different task or market lines as the circumstances 
demand. To succeed, organizations are learning how to assess quickly whether they are 
compatible with network partners and whether the joint product/service is successful. 
They are gaining competence to form and end networks swiftly, thus enabling them to 
exploit product/market opportunities rapidly and to “fail quickly” when the network is 
unproductive.40 Because each network node (organization) is small and local, resident 
cultures and ecosystems are more likely to be preserved.
Finally, in an organizational world that is technically enabled, fast-paced, and net￾worked, there will be a premium placed on learning and knowledge management. This 
increasingly important source of organizational capability and competitive advantage 
will require unprecedented amounts of innovation and coordination. Multiple stake￾holders representing a diversity of interests will come together to envision a shared 
future and to learn how to enact it.
Because this process typically leads into uncharted waters, both organizational 
members and OD practitioners will be joint learners, exploring new territory together. 
Moreover, implementing new organizational innovations will require significant 
amounts of experimentation as members try out new ways of operating, assess prog￾ress, and make necessary adjustments. In essence, they will learn from their actions 
how to create a new strategy, organization, or product/service. Such collaborative 
learning is capable of implementing radically new possibilities and ways of functioning 
that could not be envisioned beforehand. It is a process of innovation, not of detection 
and correction of errors. In turn, the new structures and systems will increase feed￾back and information flow to the organization, thereby improving its capacity to learn 
and adapt to a rapidly changing environment. They will transcend both internal and 
external organizational boundaries, remove barriers to learning, and facilitate how 
employees acquire, organize, and disseminate knowledge assets.
Implications for OD’s Future
The definition and practice of OD in the future will depend on the forces within OD as 
well as the economic, workforce, technology, and organization trends outlined above. 
Although a variety of scenarios are possible, we chose to present a likely and positive 
picture.41 Figure 25.2 summarizes this view.CHAPTER 25 Future Directions in Organization Development 703
OD played a powerful role in organization and social change in the 1960s and 1970s. 
A set of shared values, including involvement and participation, and a complimentary 
set of practices, such as team building and survey feedback, shaped the way leaders and 
managers designed and operated organizations. Together, these integrated values and 
practices improved both human and economic outcomes.42
Recognizing the powerful influence that shared values and supportive practices can 
have, OD in the future will support a policy of “responsible progress.” Responsible 
progress begins with an economist’s definition of an effective system, integrates tra￾ditional OD and more recent effectiveness values, and promotes a set of practices to 
actualize those values. Economists traditionally define progress and economic health 
in terms of the development of products and services that make society better off, the 
ability to put scarce resources to their most efficient use, the capacity to support full 
employment, and the equitable distribution of rewards in relation to the risks people 
take in productive enterprise. Although few people would argue with these criteria, 
the trends discussed above suggest that there have been important unintended con￾sequences of promoting those goals. For example, global warming and the concentra￾tion of wealth cannot be the metrics by which society is judged as “better off.” The 
traditional criteria of progress either ignore the ecology and cultural diversity or make 
untenable assumptions about the market’s ability to account for them.
Responsible progress addresses that gap by defining a policy that supports economic 
success and innovation, that promotes efficiency and progress, but incorporates cultural 
diversity and ecological sustainability to produce a more balanced view of effectiveness. 
It supports a set of traditional and effectiveness-related values as well as practices that 
reflect today’s and tomorrow’s organizations. The responsible progress policy asserts 
that individuals, organizations, and countries can pursue economic and personal suc￾cess through open innovation that leverages and nurtures cultural diversity and the 
ecology.43 It defines a vision, strategy, and future path for OD.
OD will work to shape a global economy populated with flexible, innovative, net￾worked, and ecologically responsible organizations that thrive on cultural diversity. As 
an important influence of this world vision, OD is more likely to develop interventions 
that drive effectiveness in a broader range of organizations, support technological and 
managerial innovation, preserve cultural diversity, and advocate ecologically sustain￾able practices.
OD Will Be More Involved in Driving Effectiveness in a Broader Range of Organi
zations Responsible progress affirms that all forms of organizations should have the 
opportunity to be successful. It suggests, however, that success cannot be achieved at 
the expense of cultural diversity and the ecology. When OD lacks the shared values 
and applied focus of responsible progress, success can lead to cultural assimilation and 
ecological damage. The changing context of OD, in particular the economic and organi￾zational trends, suggest that planned change in the future should be as concerned with 
effectiveness as it is with traditional values of participation and workplace democracy. 
It will also be applied to a more diverse client base.
Traditionally, OD focused on large business organizations, but three other types of 
organizations increasingly will become targets of planned change: small entrepreneurial 
start-ups, government organizations, and global social change organizations. Small, entre￾preneurial start-ups are an important and underserved market for OD. Many of these 
organizations are at the forefront of the technology trends cited earlier. Because they 
are operating on scarce, expensive, and finite venture capital, time is their most valu￾able asset and the one most critical to their success. As a result, entrepreneurial firms 
generally have a clear action orientation, little perceived need to reflect and learn, and 
few structures and systems to guide behaviors and decisions.44 This is a context that 
can be well served by fast, flexible change processes orienting new people quickly to 704 PART 7 Special Applications of Organization Development
the business strategy, integrating them rapidly into new work roles, increasing the 
efficiency of work processes, and helping founders and key managers think about how 
the market, competitors, and technology are changing. Entrepreneurs are not inclined 
to think about nor are they trained to examine these issues. OD can help them gain 
the needed competence to address such matters.
Chapter 24 described the differences between public- and private-sector organizations 
and the implications of those differences for the practice of OD. The economic, work￾force, technology, and organization trends are also pushing government organi zations to 
become more efficient, flexible, and networked. Consequently, government is increas￾ingly applying OD interventions such as strategic planning, employee involvement, and 
performance management, and we expect that the demand for change management 
expertise in the public sector will grow. Moreover, governments will become more 
proactive in managing the effects of global economic development. Public–private part￾nerships, a form of collaborative strategy, are also likely to flourish. They will require 
the assistance of OD practitioners who are sensitive to the differences between these 
two types of organizations and to the demands the partnerships will be under, such as 
environmental protection, corporate citizenship, and taxation.
Similarly, Chapter 23 described the application of OD in global social change organi￾zations. The increasing concentration of wealth and globalization of the economy will 
create a plethora of opportunities for OD to assist developing countries, disadvantaged 
citizens, and the ecology. In China, for example, as the government breaks up the old 
“work unit” structure and creates market-facing enterprises, the need for NGOs to take 
over delivery of social services is likely to increase. For example, the Global Village 
of Beijing has begun campaigns to involve the Chinese people in pro-environment 
practices and to develop leaders for other NGOs; the China Brief has cataloged NGOs 
and provided a forum for their communication; the Chinese Association for NGOs 
(CANGO) provides capacity-building services to help NGOs become more effective; 
and the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) is partnering with corporations to initiate envi￾ronmentally friendly policies. OD can help these organizations achieve their objectives, 
manage their resources, and improve their functioning through such interventions as 
team building, strategic planning, and alliance building.
Not only will OD be applied to a broader range of organizations, it will also be more 
concerned with effectiveness than in the past. A large portion of the interventions 
described in this text were developed in the 1950s and 1960s with the primary aim of 
increasing participation in organizational processes. As the global economy and infor￾mation technology enable and push for faster, more flexible organizations, the ability 
to manage change continuously will become a key source of competitive advantage in 
all types of organizations. This suggests that OD practices will become more embedded 
in the organization’s normal operating routines. OD skills, knowledge, and competen￾cies can and should become part of the daily work of managers and employees.45 This 
will diffuse change capabilities throughout the organization rather than limit them to 
a special function or role. It will permit faster and more flexible reactions to challenges 
faced by the organization. In addition to embedding OD skills in managerial roles, 
OD interventions themselves will be integrated into core business processes, such as 
product development, strategic planning, and supply-chain management. This should 
provide a closer linkage between OD and business results.
This does not mean that the role of the professional OD practitioner will go away. 
Professionals will be needed to help organization members gain change management 
competencies. Small, entrepreneurial firms will need specialized assistance in bring￾ing on new members rapidly and organizing their efforts. Organizations involved in 
strategic alliances, mergers, and acquisitions will need professional help managing 
interorganizational interfaces, integrating diverse corporate cultures, and coordinating 
business practices. OD professionals will also be needed to assist in the implementation CHAPTER 25 Future Directions in Organization Development 705
of new technologies, particularly knowledge management practices. As supported by 
the contingent workforce trends, the demand for skilled OD practitioners is likely 
to increase rather than decrease. For example, there is some anecdotal evidence to 
suggest that as line and senior managers learn more about the knowledge and skills 
associated with OD practice, their requests for assistance in formulating change pro￾cesses increase. Managers will look more frequently for help in leading and facilitating 
organization change.
OD’s ability to influence responsible progress will grow as it becomes more con￾cerned with effectiveness and more embedded in a broader range of organizations. As 
OD demonstrates its ability to solve problems or help the organization to be more agile 
and responsive to opportunities, it will become easier to suggest that leaders consider 
the ecological and cultural implications of their innovations. The promise and pur￾pose of responsible progress encourages such a balanced view of success. Moreover, 
OD practitioners could begin influencing leaders to consider leveraging cultural and 
ecological resources to accelerate innovation and effectiveness. OD practitioners can 
help leaders make policy and implement actions that drive performance by leveraging 
cultural diversity and recognizing how the ecology can improve the long-term health 
of the organization, its people, and the planet.
OD Processes Will Be More Involved in Supporting Technological and Managerial 
Innovation According to the responsible progress policy, innovation is the primary 
driver of economic success. Innovation helps to create new products, services, and 
the processes to manufacture and distribute them (technological innovation) and the 
methods and activities necessary to govern and organize systems toward some goal 
(managerial innovation). Although technological innovation gets most of the atten￾tion in the research and business press, Hamel has recently argued that managerial 
innovation may be more important.46 He argues that organizations are still managed 
and operated according to rules and principles laid down before World War I. If the 
future of organization effectiveness hinges more on managerial innovation than tech￾nological innovation, there is a clear opportunity for OD. The “open innovation” mod￾els of Chesbrough and the “built to change” (B2C) principles from Lawler and Worley 
(described in Chapter 21) represent two such sets of new management principles.47 But 
there is much more that can be done. In the future, OD will be more involved in shap￾ing technological and managerial innovation according to the principles of responsible 
progress.
There is little doubt about the pervasive influence of technological innovation 
on organizations. Increases in the speed with which data and information can be 
manipulated will drive the rate of new product and service development and the 
organizational changes needed to support those developments. The extent to which 
technology allows information to be shared within and between organizations will 
increase the speed and complexity of innovation, coordination, and other decision￾making processes. The amount of information that can be stored and accessed greatly 
enhances the potential quality of decisions and actions, and the sheer amount of infor￾mation that research, practice, and experience generates threatens to overwhelm our 
ability to make sense of it.
In general, these trends will shorten product, organization, and industry life cycles. 
Pressures to reduce the cycle time of innovation and the OD activities that support 
them are also likely to increase. OD practitioners must be mindful of opportunities to 
quicken the pace of innovation and to simultaneously remain aware of the practices 
and processes that cannot be hurried.
For example, innovation is likely to be more synchronous (anytime, anywhere) as 
well as more virtual and less face-to-face. In global organizations, innovation occurs 
in a variety of locations, cultures, and time zones. OD interventions that support 706 PART 7 Special Applications of Organization Development
innovation, such as team building, employee involvement, and knowledge manage￾ment, will have to be planned and implemented in ways that encourage contributions 
from a variety of stakeholders at times that are convenient or at times when creative 
ideas emerge. Social networking technology, such as instant messaging, Facebook, and 
Myspace, and knowledge management systems can enable organization members to 
make these contributions at any time they are ready. In addition, groupware technolo￾gies allow members to discuss issues in chat rooms and portals, in Web and video con￾ferences, and in the more traditional telephone conference. IBM’s CEO Lou Gerstner 
used these technologies to lead a vigorous discussion of corporate values, a process 
they called Values Jam, that involved organization members from around the world.
Using these technologies to exchange ideas, develop technologies, or discuss imple￾mentation will produce different types of group dynamics from those found in face-to￾face meetings. OD practitioners will need to be comfortable with this technology and to 
develop virtual facilitation skills that recognize these dynamics. In many cases, a more 
structured and assertive approach will be necessary to ensure that all members have an 
opportunity to share their ideas. The effect of these technically mediated exchanges on 
work satisfaction, productivity, and quality is not yet known. In addition, processes of 
visioning, diagnosis, data feedback, and action planning will have to be reengineered to 
leverage new information technologies.
In addition, innovation processes will be adapted to ensure that members have more 
information at their fingertips. For example, organization intranets provide members 
with an information channel that is richer, more efficient, more interactive, and more 
dynamic than such traditional channels as newsletters and memos. Thus, intranets can 
provide a timely method to collect data on emerging technologies, to monitor prog￾ress on a development project or organization change, and to involve members in key 
decisions.
These same technologies can also support increased innovation speed by process￾ing a wide variety of inputs in as little as a few hours. In coming years, technological 
advances in groupware and Web conferencing will increasingly be used to bring more 
people together faster than ever before. In short, there is real potential to reduce dra￾matically the time required to perform many OD practices.
Despite the enablement of increased innovation speed, there are physical, psycho￾logical, cultural, and ecological limits to reductions in the innovation and change cycle. 
It is not realistic to expect new product development and other forms of innovation to 
be instantaneous.48 For example, managers often want product development to occur 
more rapidly or managerial innovations to be implemented more quickly. Announcing 
a technological breakthrough, drug formulation, or new method of operating is one 
thing, but its implementation often takes longer than expected because of cultural val￾ues, ecological concerns, or other unforeseen obstacles. A new organization chart or a 
new vision and values statement hung on members’ office walls often gives the illu￾sion that change has occurred, but the working relationships, process improvements, 
and other aspects of fully implementing new technologies or organizations often take 
longer than expected. Similarly, most organization members are not capable of drop￾ping a well-known and understood set of behaviors one day and picking up a new 
set of behaviors the next with the same level of efficiency. Members can face a steep 
learning curve when they are asked to change their routines, and thus there are likely 
minimums with respect to the speed of change in individual behavior.
The impact that technical and managerial innovation can have on an organiza￾tion’s effectiveness is immense. They are key drivers in economic and social progress. 
Without the invisible hand of responsible progress to guide OD practitioners and the 
organizations they serve, however, they also contain the possibility of great harm to 
cultures and the ecology. To fulfill the promise of responsible progress, innovation must 
not only support economic success, but must do so in ways that do not standardize or CHAPTER 25 Future Directions in Organization Development 707
homogenize world cultures. Innovation must also unfold in ways that do not harm the 
ecology. OD practitioners can help organizations increase their innovative activity and 
raise the questions of diversity and ecology as the process unfolds.
OD Will Become More Concerned with Preserving Cultural Diversity As organiza￾tions and the economy become more global, it is clear that the recent growth of OD 
practice in international and cross-cultural situations will continue. This is a necessary 
but not sufficient step toward responsible progress.
Responsible progress assumes that the practice of OD is capable of working effectively 
across cultures. However, we know relatively little about planned change processes 
in cross-cultural settings. Traditionally, OD has been practiced in organizations within 
specific cultures: British-trained OD practitioners helped British organizations in Great 
Britain; Mexican OD practitioners helped Latin American organizations; and so on. 
But the current trends clearly point to the need for OD applications that work across 
cultures. Team-building interventions need to be modified to help a team composed of 
Americans, Indians, Chinese, Koreans, and French Canadians who have never met face￾to-face but are charged with developing a new product in a short period of time. The 
merger-and- acquisition process needs to be adapted to help a Japanese and a U.S. firm 
implement a new organization structure that honors both cultures. Because the number 
of organizations operating in multiple countries is growing rapidly, opportunities for OD 
in these situations seem endless: interorganizational and network relationships between 
subsidiaries, operating units, and headquarters organizations; team building across cul￾tural boundaries; working out global logistic and supply-chain processes; implementing 
diversity-centric values in ethnocentric cultures; designing strategic planning exercises 
at multiple levels. Moreover, OD is likely to find increased opportunities in GSCO 
organizations that are often part of an international network. Alliance development 
processes and network structure interventions adapted for cross-cultural contexts have 
yet to be developed and will have important applications in the future.
However, working across cultures or with multiple cultures is not the same as pur￾suing progress and innovation while preserving or even leveraging cultural diversity. 
Organizations today and in the future will operate in multiple countries, governments, 
and cultures. A single-minded pursuit of financial success can—consciously or uncon￾sciously—undermine local cultures in service of greater efficiency, increased speed, or 
higher market shares. Developing and implementing business models and organization 
designs that operate globally but support local cultures will require significant managerial 
innovation. This is the promise and challenge of responsible progress. On the other hand, 
responsible progress does not suggest that preserving cultural diversity is an end in itself. 
If OD truly believes in diversity, then diversity must be a strategy that fuels innovation 
and economic progress. Biological diversity has always been the source of adaptation in 
nature, and the seeds of organizational responsiveness and successful change are in the 
innovative possibilities that exist when multiple viewpoints, values, and beliefs are heard 
and nurtured over time.
OD Will Focus More on Ecological Sustainability OD will become increasingly con￾cerned with ecological sustainability. This will be true no matter the status of responsible 
progress. Limits to the world’s ecosystem, including its capacity to absorb population 
growth, function with a depleted ozone layer, and operate with polluted waters, pro￾vide serious challenges to the traditional business model. New concepts, frameworks, 
and philosophies, including the Coalition for Environmentally Responsible Economics 
(CERES) principles, ISO 14000, The Natural Step, and natural capitalism, represent 
opportunities to make ecological sustainability a more deliberate and intentional value 
of OD. The natural capitalism model, for example, suggests that business strategies 
built around the productive use of natural resources can solve environmental problems 
at a profit.49 Most sustainability models go beyond ecological concerns to promote a 708 PART 7 Special Applications of Organization Development
multidimensional view called the triple bottom line. In line with responsible progress, 
the triple bottom line proposes that organization change and globalization should be 
guided by the economic, social, and ecological values that are added or destroyed. These 
three values provide a framework for measuring and reporting corporate performance. 
These values also guide how organizations go about minimizing harm or maximizing 
benefits through their decisions and actions to achieve innovation and effectiveness. 
This involves being clear about the company’s purpose and taking into consideration 
the needs of all stakeholders—shareholders, customers, employees, business partners, 
governments, the ecology, local communities, and the public.
OD interventions to promote ecological sustainability are just being developed. The 
Natural Step, for example, proposes a set of guidelines for development and a pro￾cess of change that aligns with an OD perspective.50 It begins with a simple premise: 
Current economic models that are based on the assumption of growth cannot reconcile 
the increasing demand for and decreasing supply of finite and fundamental natural 
resources. The sooner this incompatibility is recognized and addressed, the larger the 
number of available and socially acceptable solutions. The Natural Step utilizes four 
“system conditions” to guide an organization’s strategic decisions: (1) Substances from 
within the earth must not systematically increase in the ecosphere, (2) substances 
produced by society must not systematically increase in the ecosphere, (3) the physi￾cal ability of nature to renew itself must not be diminished, and (4) the basic human 
needs of all people need to be met with fairness and efficiency. Implementing these 
guidelines starts with building organizational awareness and knowledge of sustainabil￾ity concepts and conducting a baseline assessment. Then a vision and strategic plan are 
created and necessary changes are supported one at a time.
Ecological sustainability interventions represent important and growing influences 
on global organizations. More and more organizations on the path to globalizing their 
business or rationalizing their existing worldwide strategy are including sustainability 
as one of their values. IKEA, Interface, and Motorola, among others, provide positive 
examples of alternative business models in practice. For example, Interface, a manu￾facturer of carpet products, has pioneered the idea of “leasing” its carpets. Under its 
“Evergreen Lease,” they accept responsibility for keeping the carpet clean and fresh in 
exchange for a monthly fee. By installing carpet tiles instead of large rolls, and because 
only a small fraction of carpeting actually gets used, they can replace the tiles and save 
approximately 80% of the cost of carpeting materials. The model adds service revenues 
to the core business model and increases margins to its product line while radically 
reducing the organization’s ecological footprint.
In the short run, ecological sustainability is likely to be a constraint on economic 
success and innovation. Most organization leaders and members hold assumptions 
about management and innovation that do not account for the ecology in decision 
making. Responsible progress challenges these beliefs and the largely uncontested 
value of growth. As demonstrated by models of natural capitalism, the trick will be to 
see sustainability not as a cost or constraint, but as an ingredient and opportunity. OD 
practitioners in the future will become well versed in helping organization members 
see this possibility and fostering innovation that honors the ecology.
SUMMARY
In this concluding chapter, we described three trends within OD and four trends 
driving change in OD’s context. OD’s future is likely to be the result of the interac￾tions among the traditional, pragmatic, and scholarly trends as well as how the global 
economy evolves, technology develops, workforces engage, and organizations structure CHAPTER 25 Future Directions in Organization Development 709
themselves. To be relevant, OD practitioners and the field as a whole must act together 
to influence the future they prefer or adjust to the upcoming future. Moving OD 
toward rigor and relevance requires more than simple extensions of existing theory 
and practice. OD’s ability to contribute to an organization’s success, to shape globaliza￾tion, or unite the trends within OD will depend on its ability to generate new and more 
powerful interventions that draw on new models and integrated values in pursuit of 
responsible progress. Our hope is that this text will be able to inform and equip the 
reader with the skills, knowledge, and value awareness necessary to shape the future.

Jack Lawler returned to his desk with a fresh 
cup of coffee. In front of him was a file of his 
notes from his two visits to the B. R. Richardson 
Timber Products Corporation. As Lawler 
took a sip of coffee and opened the file, he 
was acutely aware that he had two tasks. In a 
week, he was to meet with the company pres￾ident, B. R. Richardson, and the industrial 
relations officer, Richard Bowman, to make a 
presentation on his findings with regard to 
the lamination plant and his recommenda￾tions for what might be done. Lawler knew he 
had a lot of preparation to do, starting with a 
diagnosis of the situation. It wouldn’t be easy. 
Taking another sip from his mug, he leaned 
back in his chair and recalled how this project 
had begun.
MAKING A PROPOSAL
It was about 2:30 P.M. when the office intercom 
buzzed. Lawler’s secretary said there was a 
Richard Bowman calling from Papoose, Oregon. 
Lawler knew that Papoose was a small commu￾nity about a hundred and fifty miles south, a 
town with three or four lumber mills lying in 
the mountain range of western Oregon. When 
Lawler picked up his telephone, Bowman intro￾duced himself as being in charge of industrial 
relations for the B. R. Richardson Timber 
Products Corporation. He was calling because a 
friend of his in a regional association for train￾ing and development persons had recommended 
Lawler, and Bowman had heard of Lawler’s 
management training and consulting reputation. 
Bowman said he was searching for someone to 
conduct a “motivation course” for the blue￾collar employees of the lamination plant. Morale 
in the plant was very low, there had been a 
fatality in the plant a few months before, and 
the plant manager was “a bit authoritative.” 
Given the gravity of the plant situation, Bowman 
wanted to conduct the course within the next 
few months.
Lawler asked if the plant manager was support￾ive of the course idea. Bowman replied that he 
hadn’t asked him but had gotten approval from 
B. R. Richardson, the founder and president of 
the firm. Lawler then stated that he really 
didn’t have enough information on which to 
design such a course nor enough information 
to determine whether such a course was appro￾priate. He suggested a meeting with Bowman 
and Richardson the next week; he would be 
able to stop by Papoose in the late afternoon on 
his way home from another engagement. 
Bowman immediately accepted his proposal 
and gave Lawler directions.
Taking another sip of coffee, Jack Lawler continued 
to reminisce, visualizing the road winding past 
two very large lumber and plywood plants and 
over a small hill, and recalling his first sight of the 
B. R. Richardson Timber Products Corporation. It 
was much smaller than its neighbors, consisting 
of a one-story office building, a mediumsize lum￾ber mill, open storage yards, an oblong, hangarlike 
structure, dirt connecting roads, lumber and log 
piles seemingly scattered around, and cars and 
pickup trucks parked at random. The office build￾ing entryway was paneled with photographs 
showing the company buildings as they had 
changed over many years.
Bowman greeted Lawler, led him to a carpeted 
and paneled conference room, and introduced 
him to Ben Richardson. “BR” was a man in his 
late fifties, dressed in western apparel. The sub￾sequent conversation was one in which the 
company as a whole was outlined and informa￾tion was presented about the plant workers. 
Lawler described his preferred ways of working 
(essentially, diagnosis before training or other 
action). BR and Bowman shared their concerns 
that the plant manager, Joe Bamford, was getting 
B. R. Richardson Timber Products Corporation

out the work but wasn’t sensitive to the work￾ers. Bowman then took Lawler on a tour of the 
lamination plant. The meeting ended cordially, 
with Lawler promising to write a letter in a few 
days in which he would outline his thoughts 
on going forward.
Jack Lawler opened the file in front of him on 
his desk and smiled as he found the copy of the 
letter he had sent:
Mr. Richard Bowman
B. R. Richardson Timber Corporation
P.O. Box 66
Papoose, Oregon
Dear Mr. Bowman:
When I departed from your office about a week 
ago, I promised a letter outlining my thoughts 
on some next steps regarding the laminating 
plant. Let me sketch some alternatives:
1. One is for me to put you in touch with 
someone in your immediate region who 
could design and/or present the “motiva￾tion” course for the laminating workers 
that you originally had in mind.
2. Second is for me to be engaged as a consul￾tant. Recall the experience I described with 
the plywood plant in northern California 
in which I facilitated an approach called 
“action research.” You’ll remember that it 
basically involved a process wherein the 
concerned parties were helped to identify 
noncontrolled problems and plan to over￾come them. This would begin with a diag￾nosis conducted by myself.
3. Third, you’ll also recall that I teach part￾time at State University. This relationship 
leads to two ways graduate students might 
become involved:
I believe I could get a colleague in per￾sonnel management training to create a 
student team to design and conduct the 
motivation course.
 I can have a student team in my change 
seminar do a diagnosis of the laminating 
plant and provide you with their analyses 
and recommendations.
I believe I was clear during my visit that I think 
a diagnosis is needed first, regardless of next 
steps. When you and Mr. Richardson have 
thought about these alternatives, give me a call. 
I’ll be prepared to outline what I see as the costs 
of alternatives 2 and 3.
Thanks for the opportunity to visit. I enjoyed 
meeting you and beginning to learn about your 
company.
Sincerely,
Jack Lawler

VISITING THE PLANT
Lawler remembered that six weeks went by 
before Bowman called. He had shown Lawler’s 
letter to B. R. Richardson, and they agreed that a 
more adequate diagnosis was probably a useful 
first step. Bowman was quite clear that Richard￾son did not want to invest much money but also 
wanted Lawler’s expertise. In the ensuing con￾versation, Bowman and Lawler worked out an 
initial plan in which he would utilize several of 
his graduate students in a one-day visit to the 
company to gather information. Lawler would 
then analyze it and make a presentation to BR 
and Bowman. The use of the graduate students 
would substantially reduce his time as well as 
provide the students with some useful experi￾ence. They agreed that he would bill for three 
days of his time plus the expenses incurred 
when he and the students visited.
The next week when Lawler went to campus to 
teach his evening seminar called “The Mana￾gement of Change” at the Graduate School of 
Business, he shared with the class the opportu￾nity for some relevant fieldwork experience. He 
and four students could do the observing and 
interviewing in one day by leaving very early in 
the morning to drive to Papoose and arriving 
home by midevening. The information gained 
would be the focus of a subsequent class in 
which all seminar participants performed the 
diagnosis. When he asked his seminar who was 
interested in the information-gathering day, six 
students volunteered. When particular dates for 
the trip to Papoose were discussed, however, 
most of the six had conflicting schedules. Only 
Mitch and Mike, two second-year MBA students, 
were available on one of the days that Lawler’s 
schedule permitted.
Having constituted the field team, Lawler sug￾gested that the seminar invest some time that 
evening in two ways. He wanted to share with 
the class some information he had gained on 
his first visit to B. R. Richardson Timber and 714 PART 7 Special Applications of Organization Development
suggested that the class could help prepare 
Mitch and Mike for the experience in the field. 
He then drew an organization chart on the 
blackboard that showed the various segments 
of the corporation and the lamination business, 
including the personnel and main work groups. 
He further drew a layout of the laminating 
plant on the board. Exhibits 1 and 2 show these

sketches. While doing this, Lawler spoke of his 
understanding of the technology, work flow, 
and product of the laminating plant as follows:
It’s a family-held corporation. It’s composed of 
four small companies, divisions really, three in 
Papoose—a logging operation, a lumber mill, 
and the laminating plant—and a mill over in 
eastern Oregon. The head office, the mill, and 
the lam plant are on the edge of Papoose, 
which is a very small logging town about six or 
seven miles from the interstate highway. The 
lam plant looks like a long airplane hangar, the 
type with a curved roof. Rich Bowman took 
me on a tour, safety helmet on, and explained 
the activities as we went along.
Now, the end products are long, laminated 
wood roof trusses or beams like you some￾times see in supermarkets and arenas. These 
are built up out of many layers of two-by-fours, 
two-by-sixes, and two-by-eights glued together 
end to end and then side to side. So in one end 
of the plant come lift trucks of lumber, which 
is stacked up to a height of twelve to fifteen 
feet. According to orders—and all beams are 
made to customer order—the lumber is sorted 
and then hand-placed on a machine that cuts 
deep notches in the ends of the lumber. These 
go along one wall of the plant where the 
notched ends, called fingers, are glued together 
to make really long pieces.
These then go on along the roller conveyor, to 
the other end of the plant almost, where they 
are cut to the correct length, and sets of these 
long pieces are grouped together—the right 
number of the right length to make up a beam. 
This set then goes to a work station where 
there is a metal jig. The pieces are put in the jig 
one at a time, the glue is applied, and they are 
tapped down by hand. When the beam is fully 
assembled, clamps are put on every little way. 
This rough, clamped beam, running anywhere 
from twenty to, say, seventy-eight feet in 
length and from one to three-plus feet high, 
obviously very, very heavy, is marked, then 
picked out of the jig by two small hoists and 
stacked up to cure (dry). The curing piles have 
cross sticks and must be fifteen to eighteen feet 
high in some places.
These beams cure and eventually are picked 
out of the stack with the hoists and maneu￾vered so that they are fed into the planer, 
which is set to plane the rough beam to exact 
thickness dimensions. After planing, the beam 
is stored until the finishing crew gets to it. This 
crew cuts the beam to length, patches minor 
surface blemishes, and wraps plastic around it 
for shipping. These beams then sometimes go

directly onto a truck for shipment or into the 
yard until a load is ready.
The plant is noisy from saws, conveyors and 
hoists, and especially the planer. There are glue 
drippings, sawdust, and ends everywhere. The 
aisles tend to disappear in tools and piles. 
Above the plant offices of the manager, super￾visor, and secretary is a lunchroom and another 
office for the scheduler. The company’s head 
office is about fifty yards away in one direction 
and the mill about the same distance in another. 
The yard is graveled, with lumber of all kinds 
piled up and cars parked around the edges.
The class was encouraged to visualize the lam￾inating plant and its working conditions. 
Lawler then divided the class into two groups 
around Mike and Mitch for the task of prepar￾ing for their visit to B. R. Richardson Timber. 
It was important to clarify what information 
might be usefully sought and how informal 
interviewing on the work floor might be 
accomplished.
On the next Wednesday, the trio drove to 
Papoose, stopping for breakfast along the way. 
When they arrived at the Richardson head 
office, they were met by Richard Bowman. Law￾ler initially interviewed Juanita Yates while 
Bowman took Mike and Mitch to the lamination 
plant and introduced them to Joe Bamford, the 
manager. At lunch time, Lawler and his students 
drove into Papoose and ate at a cafe. They sum￾marized what they had learned in the morning. 
Each of them had been jotting some notes, and 
Lawler encouraged even more. He reminded 
Mike and Mitch that they would dictate their 
information during the drive home but that 
notes were needed as cues. At 4:30 P.M., the 
three met at Bowman’s office, turned in their 
safety helmets, thanked him, and left. The first 
hour of the drive was filled with the sharing of 
anecdotes from each other’s day. After a dinner 
stop, they took turns in the back seat dictating 
their notes.
REVIEWING THE NOTES
Jack Lawler’s reverie was broken by the office 
intercom. His secretary announced a long￾distance telephone call from a potential client. 
After the call, Jack turned his attention to the 
Richardson file. He realized that his forth￾coming meeting with Ben Richardson and 
Richard Bowman would take place before his 
graduate seminar met to diagnose the laminat￾ing plant situation, and so he had best get to 
work himself. He decided to review the notes 
he and his students had created.
Jack’s Notes
Current Lam schedule: Breakout crew 2:00 A.M. to 
12:00 noon. Finish end 3:30 A.M. on. Joe typi￾cally works 7:00 A.M. to 6:00 P.M.
Ben Richardson (Juanita): “In the beginning he 
was very authoritarian, still is somewhat. Seen 
as a perfectionist.” “Not quite a workaholic.” 
“Has been, for several years, politically active—
that is to say, locally.” “When there is a cause, 
he throws his energies and resources behind it.” 
Example, workers’ compensation is currently a 
thorn in his side, and he has encouraged Rich to 
fight. “In the last few years, Ben has listened a 
little more and seems slightly more open.” The 
last couple of years has had consultant Chuck 
Byron from Eugene, who has pushed the idea of 
a management team. Rich is the first real out￾sider hired as a professional. Ben has a “conser￾vative philosophy.” Will not have safety meetings 
on company time. Appreciates and rewards 
loyalty and dedication. Example, December 1978 
Christmas party—a couple of twenty-year men 
were given $1,000 checks and plane tickets to 
Hawaii for themselves and families—it surprised 
everybody.
Who’s influential (Rich): Juanita Yates, office 
manager and secretary, has been with Ben ten 
years. When Ben is away, he calls her once or 
twice a day. Second-most influential is Wayne 
Teeterman, also ten years with Richardson. 
Heads construction and truck shop. Formerly 
ran the sawmill. Ben’s ear to the mill. Rich is a 
distant third in influence. Mostly via Nita. “Ben 
sees Joe, manager of lam plant, as an enigma—
almost canned him a couple of times.” However, 
Joe is seen as dedicated, mostly because of the 
long hours put in.
Overall business pretty good (Rich): “Ben keeps 
thinking the other shoe will drop one of these 
days.” “Ben used to be able to predict the lum￾ber market. This is getting more difficult.” Right 
now the economy is stable enough regarding 
lumber and lumber products. Richardson mill 
sales of clear-cut high grade are pretty much 
cutting to order. Laminating plant growing ever 
since it was started. It’s very profitable, busy, INTEGRATIVE CASES 717
and active—probably has the largest margin of 
all Richardson companies.
Laminating plant (Rich): Laminating plant has 
six- to seven-week delivery dates now.
Timber purchases (Rich): Timber purchases from 
Forest Service and BLM. One to two year’s cut￾ting is now available. Last year needed to cut 
only half of year’s sales because of fortunate 
other purchases. Last year, half of timber 
requirements were from private ground. “Costs 
of cutting, however, go up, and it makes Ben 
nervous.”
Laminating plant lumber (Rich): “Approximately 
70% of laminating plant lumber purchased 
outside—30% from Richardson mill.” This 
material is in the middle of the quality range. 
Outside purchases are primarily from Oregon 
companies—Weyerhaeuser, Bohemia, Georgia￾Pacific, and smaller ones. Joe does the purchas￾ing for lam plant. “He likes to do this.”
Recent changes (Juanita): “Turnover has consis￾tently been high and continues. For the com￾pany as a whole it is around 72 to 76%. In the 
lam plant there was 100% turnover last year” 
(among operators). “Right now this year it is 
down 50%.”
Rolf (Juanita): Rolf was formerly industrial rela￾tions manager. A year ago April, he was appointed 
supervisor in the lam plant. Rolf’s predecessor 
in lam plant ineffectual; gone from company. 
Rolf did not do a good job with personnel. 
Fatality in lam plant happened two months 
before Rolf went down there. It was in the 
breakdown area—several people quit at that 
time. There has been a constant concern for the 
height of stacking in the lam plant. “Joe has had 
a positive impact on morale—started a softball 
team in a community league.”
Reward system (Juanita): “Nine paid holidays, 
hourly wage, liberal vacation plan, life insur￾ance, no pension, no bonus except for those 
people who report directly to Ben (Nita, Wayne, 
Joe, and Rich). Joe has not had a bonus yet.”
Incentives for safety: Joe and Rolf have introduced 
incentives for safety. Competition for groups about 
lost time. Joe gave a fishing outfit last month for 
the first time that a safety target was met.
Hiring (Rich): Hiring was traditionally done by divi￾sion managers. At present, Rich has taken over 
that. He now goes into background more deeply.
Interaction with middle management (Rich): Nor￾mally when Ben is in Papoose, he and Joe 
interact a couple times a week, which is about 
the same as Ben interacts with other division or 
company managers.
Ben’s style (Juanita): “He focuses on a problem. 
He will write a list and go over it with the man￾ager item by item. Pretty much forcing his way. 
Later, he will pull out that list to check up 
with.” He often wants Rich to play intermediary 
between top management and the lam plant. 
Rich tries to resist.
Rolf (Rich): “Fairly introverted, basically a nice 
guy. He finds it hard to be tough. Doesn’t think he 
could do Joe’s job.” His folks were missionaries.
Dirk (Rich): “His goal is to get into sales. Ben has 
given okay, and he is supposed to look into 
local sales. Joe has agreed but has not given 
Dirk time to do any of this. Dirk probably has 
no long-run commitment to the company.” He 
has a degree in forestry.
John Walton (Juanita): In charge of quality con￾trol. “Very loyal to the company. Very dedicated 
to quality. Member of national organization. 
Never gets very distressed. Seems well liked by 
crews. Not afraid to pitch in when they are a 
man short or behind.”
Jim Fuller (Rich): “Ben doesn’t like him.” Had 
EMT training recently sponsored by the compa￾nies. Ben questions Jim’s commitment. Jim 
gets into lots of community activities, has been 
a disc jockey on Sunday mornings, and is very 
active in community organizations with youth. 
“Not perceived as a real strong leadership type, 
but knowledgeable and pretty well liked in the 
lam plant.”
John Rondo (Rich): “Dedicated, works hard. Pushes 
the men, too. Ben sees him as having future 
management promise.” From an old logging 
family in the area. “Much more leadership 
oriented.”
Ron Baker (Rich): Gluing supervisor. “Business￾like, could be sour. Likes to impress others.”
John McClough (Rich): “Failing as a finishing sup￾ervisor. Originally from California. Worked in 
Roseburg area as carpenter; does excellent work 
by himself. He is a flop and probably won’t last 
much longer.”
Bob Bennis (Rich): Finishing supervisor. “Not really 
a pusher.” “Time has made him knowledgeable 718 PART 7 Special Applications of Organization Development
about the work.” “Willing to be directed.” He has 
had a number of family conflicts and has been in 
financial trouble. “Overall, a nice guy.”
Bob Griffith (Rich): Planer. Came to Richardson 
out of the service. Started in gluing, then in 
breakdown, then gluing. Finally, planer’s job 
opened up, and he took it. “Still learning the 
job. Generally a good worker; some question 
about his leadership.”
Supervisors summary (Rich): “In general, the super￾visors all kind of plod along.”
Jim Fuller (Juanita): Is lam plant safety committee 
representative.
General reputation in community (Rich): “Not good 
from employees’ point of view. Matter of turn￾over, accidents, and the fatality. Seems to be 
turning around somewhat over the last year. 
The company, as a whole economically, has a 
successful image. It’s made money, survived 
downturns, and so forth.”
Summer: During summer, fill-ins are hired for 
vacationers—sometimes college or high school 
students. The supervisor spots are filled in by 
key men on the crew.
Communication: Bulletin board outside of lam 
office has safety information, vacation sched￾ule, and production information. Blackboard in 
lunchroom has jokes, congratulations, etc.
Reports: Daily production is scheduled by Dirk. 
Daily report from lam plant to office is com￾pared against that. Production and lam’s infor￾mation reported daily. Joe keeps records on 
productivity by lam plant area. This duplicates 
Susan’s records. Quality control turns in three 
sheets a day: on finger-joint testing, glue spread 
and temperature, and finished-product tests. 
Also Walton keeps cumulative information on 
block shear (where a core is drilled and stressed) 
and delamination tests made (where product is 
soaked and then stressed).
Records: A few years ago, 18,000 board feet was 
the high for preglue. May 9, daily was 16,406 
board feet. Swing shift is consistently higher 
than the day shift preglue. Gluing, Ben expects 
30,000 feet. On May 9, it was 27,815 feet.
Overtime (Juanita): “Is approximately 6% over 
the year. Right now lam plant is higher than 
that.”
April (Juanita): Bids for the month were 
$8,166,000. Orders received for the month were 
$648,600. Shipped in April: $324,400. When 
$400,000 is shipped, that is an excellent month, 
according to Nita. Joe does all the bidding. Sue 
actually may do the calls, however. “The margin 
is significantly higher than the sawmill or plan￾ing mill.”
History of lam plant (Juanita): “In 1968 Wayne 
Lauder started it. He had lots of prior experi￾ence.” “The property that Richardson stands on 
had just been purchased. Wayne came to Joe 
with a proposition. Ended up with Wayne hav￾ing stock in the Papoose Laminators Company.” 
Original crew was eight to ten men. “In fact 
Wayne taught Ben all Ben knows about the 
laminating plant.” “Got into lamination business 
at a very good time.” “In the early days, there 
were no accidents and no turnover.” “Wayne 
had hired old friends, largely married family 
types.” “Walton is the only one left from those 
days.” In the spring of 1973, Wayne went to 
South Africa on a missionary call. Between 
then and Joe, there have been four managers 
and four or five supervisors. Ben has an image 
of Wayne that successive managers cannot live 
up to. Joe, in Ben’s eyes, has done better than 
anyone since Wayne. The supervisor’s job was 
started under Wayne; since then it is not clear 
what they do. At one time, there was an exper￾iment to move the lam office up to the main 
office so that the supervisor was forced to see 
the manager up there. This did not work. With 
Joe, the office moved back to the plant.
Sue (Juanita): Secretary in lam plant. Now hand￾extending the data. Could use a computer. It is 
programmed; she has computer skills. “Computer 
never used for lam bidding since Sue came two 
years ago.” Phone coverage is awkward. To get 
copies of things means Sue has to come to the 
office.
Market conditions: Market conditions have been 
good since Joe became manager.
Joe’s ability (Juanita): Highly questioned around 
planning. Example: “Sue away; he knew it before￾hand; it was a day he wanted to be away. This 
left the head office trying to get someone to 
cover for the phone.” “Clearly sales is Joe’s strong 
area. Get excellent reports back from customers. 
But Joe doesn’t follow up, so payables are very 
weak. We still haven’t got a ninety-day pay￾ment and are likely to ship the next load to the 
customer anyway.”INTEGRATIVE CASES 719
Lack of communication (Juanita): “Lack of com￾munication with us about cash flow is another 
weak spot of Joe’s. Lack of supervision over key 
people like Sue and Rolf. Seems to just let them 
go. Certainly doesn’t supervise them. Sue gets 
to set her own hours.” Example offered by Nita 
of misbidding because Sue didn’t get the bid 
back to the customer. “Joe just wasn’t aware of 
the timing—hadn’t planned for it.” Another 
example: “Sue runs out of invoice paper, which 
means we have to scurry around.”
Sue’s wages (Juanita): “At one time, Sue was all 
riled up about wages and upset the secretaries 
in the main office. She got no pay increase last 
year. Ben upset. Joe went to bat for her. Joe 
almost put his job on the line for her.”
Sue’s performance (Juanita): “Sue does sloppy 
work. Not very efficient. Poor letters; late; miss￾ing deadlines. Joe allows or accepts, or perhaps 
doesn’t know.” Nita is supposed to be responsi￾ble for Sue on quality matters. In general, to 
make sure that her backup is there. “Sue now 
works ten to fifteen hours a week overtime.” 
Nita cannot see the reason for this.
Rolf’s attitude (Rich/Juanita): Rolf’s attitude chang￾ing. Seems more cooperative to both Rich and 
Nita. Nita thinks Rolf is a very intelligent man. 
Neither are clear exactly on what Rolf does. 
Company policy is to send out invoices each 
workday and that invoices should be sent and 
dated on the day shipped. Sue doesn’t send 
them.
After Wayne, a lot of lam workers were hippies, 
had long hair, etc. Part of that is the reason 
why Rich now hires. Why is Ben down on Jim 
Fuller? Nita says because of time lost with 
accidents. “Ben knows his family and all about 
the radio station. Doesn’t think he is commit￾ted to the lumber company. There have been 
financial problems, too. There were garnish￾ments in the past. He’s quit or been laid off, or 
was fired about three years ago. Some things 
stick in Ben’s throat. Now Jim is out of debt; 
they sold the home and moved; his wife works; 
they do an awful lot of volunteer work at the 
school. Ben sees this and wonders why he can’t 
give that energy to the company.”
John Rondo (Juanita): From a local logging 
family. He is a nephew of Butch (someone from 
a logging company). “Notorious redneck.” Once 
called Ben from a bar when he was drunk and 
swore to Ben about his paycheck. “Ben doesn’t 
forget those things.”
Sue hired by Joe: Does all the paperwork in the 
lam plant. Doesn’t really have to interact with 
any of the men except Joe. Takes care of the 
purchase orders, invoices, and daily records.
Glue used in lam plant: Twenty-two thousand 
pounds at 60 cents per pound; that’s nearly 
$10,000 a month.
Maintenance man: Leon replacing rails and 
turning chair at preglue. “Had help until noon. 
Don’t know where they took off to.” It’s really 
a two-person job. Also said that they’re probably 
six to eight months overdue with this job.
Hoists: Planer and helper talking at break that it 
is awkward and sometimes have to wait either 
on the finish end or breakdown side of planing 
because of competition for hoists. Believe the 
roof could hold more hoists. Can’t understand 
why Ben won’t spring for a couple of more 
hoists on each side. In the lunchroom, the 
planer was coaching a breakdown/finish helper 
on how to undo clamps efficiently. Says that the 
“whole operation has to be speeded up.” 
1:05 P.M.—lunchroom. The planer approaches 
Joe: “Can we get off a little early? We’ve been 
working lots of ten-hour days.” Joe responds, “If 
you get that 57 job done, maybe we’ll see.” As 
Joe turns to leave, the other finish man, who 
helps the planer, says, “Hey, Joe, I want to talk 
to you later.” Joe says, “Okay.” The man turns to 
me and says, “He thinks we should be working 
harder. I want to tell him what’s what.”
Rolf put in lam plant by Ben: Probably consulted 
with Joe, but still he did it.
Goals for lam plant (Rich): Joe and Ben both have 
some goals in their heads, of course, and talk 
on occasion. “Probably not very systematically 
written down.”
Jim Fuller, preglue supervisor: Swing shift now. 
Three men work directly under him. First work 
position is a lumber grading cut-off saw. A nine￾teen- to twenty-year-old tends to work here. 
“You need a big reach.” Then there is a cut-off 
saw that feeds a finger-joiner cut. Then the ends 
are glued. “Young men tend to be in this posi￾tion, too. Need to have a lot of manual dexterity 
and a sense of rhythm.” Then there is the radio 
frequency curing machine. It gives an eight- to 
ten-second jolt at 109; then the hardest job 720 PART 7 Special Applications of Organization Development
comes along. The lumber is stopped, set to 
length, and cut three inches longer than order 
and then put in stacks on rollers. “You need to 
visually check ahead, grade lumber, and every￾thing else.” This position has to be communi￾cated back up to preglue line for amount.
Production scheduling (Rich/Jim): “Rolf is so-called 
production supervisor. However, if Joe has his 
druthers, he’d do that, too.” Supposed to have 
orders from Joe to Dirk to Jim. Needs to be 
scheduling. This mostly happens, but some￾times he gets a message from Joe himself. 
Actually Jim says, “Both Rolf and Joe more or 
less equally give me orders.” Jim confirms that 
the majority of materials come from external 
sources and suppliers. He thinks Joe is a “sharp 
bargainer.” “If he can save $100 per thousand 
on eight- or ten-footers, he may buy them. Of 
course, this means they have to do a lot more 
cutting and gluing.” Somehow it’s known that 
thirty thousand feet a day per shift is what the 
lam plant is to produce. It takes two preglue 
shifts to get that. A few years ago, Jim reports, 
a production quota for the plant was eighteen 
to twenty thousand feet per day. “Joe is really 
production-minded, a real pusher.”
Asking about problems (Jim): He quickly res￾ponds with “confusion” and elaborates that it 
has to do with scheduling. “Sometimes Dirk 
has to work on the line and get inaccurate 
figures, or we don’t get them in time.” 
Nonetheless, he thinks Dirk is a good man and 
tries hard. Another problem has to do with 
stacking. There is not enough room to handle 
items where beams are curing, particularly in 
the finishing area. He makes a big point about 
the difference between architectural and other 
grades. There are 15% of the former in general, 
but it takes more layout space in the finish end 
to handle it.
The most inexperienced crew, in Jim’s opinion, 
is in the breakdown area (unclamping beams 
for planing). There seems to be a bottleneck 
around the planer. “The crew tries hard but is 
somewhat inexperienced. His helpers couldn’t 
care a damn.” Planing is to a tolerance of plus 
or minus 1/16-inch. He gives an example of 
large beams for Los Angeles that were over￾planed, and those beams now sit in the yard 
until they can be worked into some later order 
for someone.
Another problem, according to Fuller, has to do 
with Paul, an electrician who works under 
Wayne. Has strong sawmill preference. Can 
never find him. For example, the RF machine 
is only half rebuilt. “People who do this work 
for Wayne will probably never get it done.”
Age of workers (Jim): Mostly young—“means that 
they don’t really care about working, aren’t 
very responsible. They take off when they feel 
like it; hence, there is a lot of personnel being 
shuffled around. Both Walton and Dirk, and 
even Joe, pitch in sometimes, not that this 
makes it really more efficient.” “Personnel is 
shuffled too much.” Fuller gives an example. 
He was hit by a beam and was off for seven 
weeks. Jay replaced him. There was stacking in 
the breakdown area on the main two. Jay tried 
to move a ceiling air hose; it came back; two top 
beams fell and “snuffed him out just like that.” 
Maintenance men have to fill in on lines, too. 
This cuts into maintenance being done on time. 
The whole program is behind. It’s sort of down 
to what Fuller calls “band-aid work.” Also, 
major replacements are done poorly. Example: 
glue area where pipes come right down in the 
middle of the preglue line when they should 
have been run down the wall. Bruce did this.
Ben’s approach (Jim): “Ben used to visit the 
laminating plant twice a week a few years ago. 
I haven’t seen Ben through here for more than 
a month now. Ben likes to use a big-stick appro￾ach.” He gives example of Ben looking at main￾tenance work in gluing shop and insisting that 
the millwright come in on Saturday to get it 
done, “or else.”
Those who report to Ben: Rich, industrial rela￾tions; Wayne, construction; Juanita, who is 
secretary and office manager; and managers of 
three companies. Richardson Lumber, which 
has 110 employees, was founded in 1951. 
Papoose Laminators started in 1968, and Prairie 
Wood Products started in about 1976, with 
forty-five employees. There is a logging 
company, too, which is for buying.
Mitch’s Notes
Jack, Mike, and I arrive at B. R. Richardson. We 
enter through the main building into the office 
and are seated in a conference room located at 
the back of the main office, which is located up 
on a hill overlooking the rest of the plant.INTEGRATIVE CASES 721
Rich enters; after formal introductions, proceeds 
to talk about Joe, or I should say, describes Joe.
Describes Joe in the following way. Says that 
Joe is aware the training program was a possi￾bility. Stated that Joe had had military experi￾ence, that he (Joe) believes he knows about 
management, that there are some possible 
resentful feelings toward our intrusion upon 
the plant, that he is aware of us and the fact 
that we are from State University.
Rich, Mike, and I leave the main office and go 
down to the plant to be introduced to Joe.
Rich introduces us to Joe by saying that we are 
with Jack and that we are down looking around 
at the plant, etc.—seemed awkward. Communi￾cation not straightforward. Not a lot of eye-to￾eye contact. Rich is leaning up against the wall; 
he looks uncomfortable and leaves rather 
abruptly.
Joe immediately questions us as to what we are 
doing, why we are here, and what we are look￾ing for. My perception is that he is resentful. In 
talking to Joe, I perceive that he felt the workers 
were good, that with the proper knowledge of 
the task they could lead themselves. He also 
stated they were “multicapacity”—that “they had 
many functions which they performed,” and 
that it wasn’t that specialized down on the floor. 
He mentioned that his functions were bidding, 
managing, and engineering. He made a com￾ment toward work team functions (“work team 
crap”), and then he corrected himself. He also 
remarked that “theories come and theories go.”
At one point, Joe stressed the use of communi￾cation as a tool in management. He showed 
Mike and me a little exercise and seemed to be 
impressed with it.
In looking on the walls of his office, he had 
approximately five awards or merits for leader￾ship or worker participation.
His assistant Rolf had a desk right next to his, 
which was in an office off the side of the secre￾tarial room serving as the entrance to his 
building.
Joe’s background included working in many 
plants, primarily in forestry—that is my 
understanding. He said he preferred working at 
B. R. Richardson’s mainly because it was a “small 
and nonpolitical plant.” He likes leadership, and 
he enjoys working there. He stated, as we were 
walking through the plant, that he felt a high 
degree of frustration about the plant because the 
size was too small at times and the seasonal rush 
(which is beginning right now as of May) for 
summer building puts a crunch on things. He 
stated that production is up 10% from last year; 
that there have been scheduling problems—they 
received some wood in February, and it wasn’t 
until May that they could use it and laminate it 
and get it out the other side, so it’s been stacked 
taking up space. He stated that if they fall behind, 
they have no chance to catch up and that they 
are working at full capacity right now.
Later on that afternoon, I went back and talked 
to Joe. I asked him what his specific duties 
were. He replied in the following way: His 
duties were to take orders, to plan the shipping, 
to make bids on orders, and to manage the 
plant. His typical day was to arrive about 
7:00 to 7:15 A.M., to look over the plant, to look 
at the new orders of the day, and to take care 
of any emergencies. Lately, he stated that he 
was making engineering drawings. When asked 
if this was common, he said it usually was done 
by the customers, but he felt it was a service he 
could render them. He stated, “It’s foolishness 
because it takes too much time.” However, he 
continued to work on that project. He stated 
that he liked the work, that he didn’t mind long 
hours. When asked about the scheduling, he 
said that after he makes a bid and fills the 
order, it goes to Dirk, who schedules the work 
to be done, which goes to Ron, who is either in 
preglue or the gluing operation. I’m not sure, 
but I felt he was talking about the gluing opera￾tion. And he stated that Ron’s job was very 
specific, that he had to coordinate the people to 
get the wood clamped up, to get the glue on, 
and to get it organized in a rather specified 
manner. (I think it is interesting to check Ron’s 
description that I include later on.)
My personal comment on Joe is that he seemed 
very friendly with the workers, that it was a 
buddy-buddy relationship. At one time, we were 
in the lunchroom with Joe, and he was talking 
openly about the problems of the shop; it was 
kind of like “we all suffer through this too, don’t 
we?” He seemed to enjoy his work, he likes to 
work hard, he was proud of the fact that pro￾duction was up, he was supportive of the men 
down there, and he was also apprehensive of 
Mike’s and my presence. I think it is interesting 722 PART 7 Special Applications of Organization Development
to note the roles that Mike and I took. Mike 
took the role of a person interested in design, 
more or less, and I took the role, as I stated to 
Joe, that I was interested in seeing what it was 
like to be a manager in this situation and to 
learn any knowledge he might have to offer. 
Many times during our encounter, he asked me 
what my background was and also about what I 
wanted to do when I got through school. He 
seemed very interested in my studies and my 
goals.
Joe’s secretary, while I did not talk to her, 
seemed to play an important role in the organi￾zation. At one point, I was talking to Joe when 
the secretary answered the phone and inter￾rupted our conversation to tell Joe about a 
possible bid. Joe then made the bid based on 
the board footage, and the secretary questioned 
him on this bid, at which point Joe thought a 
minute and said, “Yeah, I want to keep the bid 
the way it is.” The secretary then asked him, 
“Are you sure?” and Joe said, “Yes,” at which 
point the secretary completed the preliminary 
parts of the bid over the phone.
At one point when we were walking through 
the plant with Joe, I made mental notes on 
safety aspects of the plant—this was something 
in question. Some of the things I noted are as 
follows.
There seemed to be many metal spacers or 
clamps by the glue section. This section wasn’t 
in use, so I don’t know if this was normal or 
not. It was very crowded and difficult to walk 
around. As we walked through the plant, I saw 
at least two different types of band saws with 
no guarding whatsoever—a very dangerous 
situation in my opinion. There were no safety 
signs around the plant—at least not outside the 
lunchroom. One worker did not have a safety 
helmet on. I also noticed that the safety helmets 
that they gave us were of very low quality. 
I base this on past experience in wearing them; 
they were the cheapest I have seen. I did see a 
safety insignia on one gentleman’s lunch box. 
(I wonder how they meet OSHA standards.) 
Also because of the crowdedness of the facility, 
it was very difficult to move around, and with 
things going on, I could see how it would be 
difficult not to get hurt. The workers at one 
point asked Joe about another worker (I think 
his name was Bob). It seems that Bob was 
going down the highway and was reaching for 
a speaker wire and hit the center rail on 
Highway I-5 and totaled his truck. He seemed 
to be okay with a mild concussion. The workers 
were very concerned. A group of about three of 
them asked Joe how Bob was doing.
I had a chance to talk to Ron, the team leader 
in gluing. His comment about his job was that 
there were long hours, that these were typically 
ten or more per day, and that he received over￾time for the long hours provided that in total 
they were over forty hours per week. Each 
hour over the forty minimum would be paid at 
1.5 times the normal rate. For Ron, the normal 
rate was about $8 an hour, $12 an hour over￾time. His comments about his job and his 
attitude toward the plant were “sweatshop,” 
“Richardson won’t spend money,” and “everyone’s 
worked at BR’s at one time or another before.” 
“They have plans for expansion of the plant, 
but they don’t want to spend the money on it.” 
At one point, he said he didn’t really know 
what he was doing in terms of how to be a 
supervisor, how to be a leader. When I ques￾tioned him some more, he really didn’t know 
what the supervisor did, in this case Rolf. He 
had just finished his first year, as far as experi￾ence on the job.
Ron had a major complaint about his job in that 
the glue person also had to prepare the glue 
and was responsible for getting all the boards 
and clamps in the right direction. He seemed to 
think maybe an extra glue prepare person 
would help. It seems to be a major job for him. 
There seemed to be quite a bit of dissatisfaction 
about Rolf in his mind. He stated that when 
overtime or a certain amount of board footage 
was needed to meet a quota, this created work 
unrest, which led to accidents. He said that 
Rolf was always the one who initiated or told 
the workers that they had to work overtime. 
When asked about the death that had occurred, 
he stated that everybody was pretty upset 
about it, that it was bound to happen. I asked 
him what happened that day. He said that a 
guy got hurt, and yet management still wanted 
them to work even after the guy died. This 
seemed to upset Ron.
Ron mentioned that they (the workers) had a 
softball team; that he felt frustrated about it 
because he couldn’t always play because the 
games were at six or seven o’clock and many 
times they were working until late in the INTEGRATIVE CASES 723
evening trying to make a quota. He also stated 
that accidents were very high around here, that 
it was not uncommon to get a finger smashed 
or something, and that management didn’t 
seem to care too much. He stated that he liked 
Joe, the manager, that he was okay but that he 
was maybe more production-oriented than 
necessary. He stated that the work is very hard 
and the need for better methods is evident. He 
stated that most men had bad backs, hernias, 
and broken fingers or toes, and he seemed to be 
kind of embarrassed. He did state that they had 
medical insurance.
Ron stated that one of the biggest causes of 
unrest, he felt, was due to overtime, and his 
own personal frustration was that in a year he 
had obtained probably the highest vertical level 
on the management structure, that of supervisor. 
He stated that the next job would probably be 
to take Joe’s job. He said that wouldn’t happen, 
so there seems to be a lack of job mobility in his 
eyes. He stated that workers do almost any￾thing, any task at any time; that what needs to 
be done, needs to be done, and they do it. He 
also stated that in the summertime, when it is 
warmer, the metal building that they work in 
gets really hot, and it’s not uncommon for men 
to lose five or more pounds in one shift, which 
would be in an eight-hour period. When asked 
if it was possible to ventilate the building a little 
bit more, he said it would be hard, that even if 
they could, management wouldn’t spend the 
money to do it.
Ron said he didn’t have enough time for his 
home life. He also stated that Rolf and Joe, who 
were the supervisor and manager, would come 
out and help when they had the time. He said 
they would actually end up losing a half-hour 
of production time that way and would be 
better off if they would just stay in their offices. 
Ron seemed to express a great amount of 
displeasure with Rolf, and he said most of the 
workers agreed that Rolf was a “thorn.” When 
Rolf would give orders, men would get upset 
and throw things around, and this would cause 
accidents. When asked about new members, he 
said they don’t last more than a couple of days, 
and very rarely do they last over a year. Ron 
stated that one of the jobs they gave new work￾ers was to bang beams in the gluing job with a 
weight that was on a pole that is picked up and 
bounced up and down off the wood. It weighed 
anywhere from forty-five to one hundred 
pounds; very grueling work. He laughed a little 
bit and said that they usually hurt their back 
the first day, and it takes them a couple of 
weeks to learn how to do it, to learn the right 
technique, but he said “there is no other way to 
learn the job, other than just jumping up there 
and doing it.”
My own personal opinion of Ron was that while 
somewhat upset at the conditions down there, 
he was dedicated, he did enjoy his role as a 
leader, and he was looked up to by the fellow 
workers. He mentioned at one time that the 
record of total board footage was broken by his 
crew, and he seemed very proud of that fact. He 
did not seem to think that any of our sugges￾tions would make any waves around there, that 
“I would not be listened to.” He was enjoyable 
to talk to, and he was more than willing to help 
me obtain the information I needed.
Marty, who like Ron has been there for over a 
year, was “key person” of the glue team. 
However, Ron acted as the leader. They seemed 
to be good friends and went home together 
that afternoon. Marty had been there the lon￾gest. He had stated that the work is hard, that 
there are long hours, and that he had been 
right next to the man who was killed. He stated 
that he was no more than three to six feet from 
his friend (I guess he was his friend) when it 
happened. He was the one to fill out the acci￾dent report for the police and insurance people. 
He stated that they wanted to stop work and 
that the plant, and he didn’t say specifically 
who, didn’t want to shut down but wanted to 
complete the work that was started. It seemed 
that most of the workers there did not want to 
work that day. That was the extent of my 
talking to Marty.
When the workers were leaving, it seems they 
had set up a bet for a keg of beer if the planer 
Griffith could plane all the beams that were set 
out in front of him, which from the comments 
of the men, was quite a chore. But Griffith 
seemed pretty confident that he could get the 
work out. He did say that he was looking to go 
to pharmacy school as soon as he got his hernia 
fixed, and when asked about the hernia, he 
said he got it some time ago. He said he got it 
working while picking up some stuff in the 
plant. Again, this seemed to be common.724 PART 7 Special Applications of Organization Development
I had a chance to talk to a couple of the preglue 
persons; there is a total of three. I believe Jack 
had talked to the leader, and I talked to the two 
workers. They pretty much agreed that a union 
would be nice; however, BR, the owner, would 
not allow one to come in. He said, “Work long 
hours, or you get fired.” There seemed to be a lot 
of stress as far as meeting their quota, and they 
could not go home until they met the quota for 
the day. They stated that the job was okay, but 
that they didn’t have much time for their fami￾lies. One said, “I go home, I sleep, I get up, I go to 
work, and I go back home and go to sleep again.” 
When asked about their salary, he stated that 
they’re paying, in his opinion, 60 cents per hour 
lower than the unions around here, and he said 
further, “The unions will get a 65-cent-per-hour 
raise, and we’ll get a 45-cent-per-hour raise.”
I also had a chance to talk to some of the guys 
in the finish area. This seemed to be a typical 
eight-hour shift that consisted primarily of 
watching the beams run through the planer. 
They go back and clean it up so that it can be 
packaged and shipped out. One man’s biggest 
complaint was that he was upset about the 
lunch-break change, which he stated was initi￾ated by Rolf. It consisted of taking their one-hour 
lunch break and cutting it down to a half-hour. 
He stated that Rolf felt production would be 
increased by cutting down the lunch break. He 
seemed upset about this. I don’t know his name. 
He lived five blocks away from the plant and 
didn’t have time to go home to eat and then 
come back (on a half-hour break). He seemed to 
have a high degree of resentment toward Rolf, 
and he had no knowledge of what Rolf does.
I had an opportunity to meet with John, the 
quality-control man. He seemed like a very nice 
man. No real quotes. He was just there for a few 
minutes. He had had an eye operated on: I guess 
a new lens was put in. He seemed to talk with 
Joe very well. When I asked Joe about John, Joe 
stated John was officially to report to him; how￾ever, John reported to Rich, and that worked 
out for the best because quality control should 
really be removed from production somewhat. 
Joe seemed to see no conflict in that.
Mike’s Notes
Mitch and I had a morning interview with 
Joe. Some of the quotes on management style 
were: “I don’t know about this work team crap, 
oops, stuff,” “Theories come and theories go,” 
“I believe in giving my workers explicit instruc￾tions; perceptions differ, and you have to be 
sure they understand,” and “I didn’t like the 
politics of larger plants I’ve worked in.” Also, 
Joe mentioned frustration over the lack of plant 
space. To a worker he mentioned, “You are frus￾trated, aren’t you, Bill?”
During our tour, Joe set a brisk pace. He seemed 
to have quite a competent manner.
When Rich approached Joe about taking Mitch 
and me under his wing for a tour, I think Rich 
was intimidated by Joe. Rich had his back 
against the wall sideways to Joe, and he shifted 
his eyes from Joe to Mitch and me during the 
conversation.
Joe was more than a bit curious in regard to our 
plant visit objective. I said it was for a class proj￾ect. Joe replied, “Oh, then it’s theory.” I explai￾ned we covered all the theories equally. Another 
quote from Joe: “A day’s production lost is a day 
lost,” delivered with a hint of frustration and 
impatience.
Joe’s office contained numerous good-worker 
awards. One prominent sign contained a mes￾sage roughly to the effect that “I am right in the 
end.” My impression of the plant—there were 
no safety glasses on the workers. One worker 
had no helmet; there were no band-saw safety 
devices. Seemed pretty lackadaisical. During our 
initial interview with Joe, Darrell, a truck driver, 
was in the office. He talked good-naturedly with 
Joe, and he seemed to like Joe in general. Later 
on in the day I had an interview alone with 
Dirk. Dirk is the scheduler. Dirk has a master’s 
in forestry from the University of Washington. 
Dirk mentioned that he spends half his time fill￾ing in various positions. He says one of the major 
problems is the transition between shifts. This is 
in regard to mistakes. One of Dirk’s quotes: 
“There is no communication between shifts. 
Mainly people don’t want to take the blame for 
mistakes.” During the course of the interview, 
Dirk’s manner was fidgety; he moved around a 
bit, but he seemed fairly open. A quote from 
Dirk: “The men change jobs so much that it is 
hard to train them. Everyone has to know what 
is needed in beams.” This implies that workers 
weren’t really trained well enough to know 
what was needed in beams. “Production people INTEGRATIVE CASES 725
go home after the quota.” That was his percep￾tion of the amount of overtime worked. “Repairs 
after gluing are costly and difficult. Double 
checking is needed before they are glued togeth￾er. Average beam is six thousand board feet, or 
approximately $840. I currently have seventy￾five bastard beams I have to find a home for.” 
Then Dirk went on to an example of mistakes 
made. A tapecloth shrunk two inches. They 
used this tape for quite some time before they 
finally found the mistake. He also mentioned 
there were frequent mixups between the 13/16-
inch and 11/4-inch strips for laminated beams. 
Dirk’s quote on the workers: “A few are incom￾petent; they just get soft warnings. Management 
should be harder on them.”
Item on bidding or posting for jobs: seniority or 
ability (whoever they think will do best) decides 
who gets the job. On the workers: Morale is 
low. Safety and overtime are the main causes. 
On Rich, industrial relations: “The only contact 
I’ve had with him is when he came down and 
asked about people.” I asked, “Who, what peo￾ple?” and Dirk said, “I’d rather not say.” On 
safety, he mentioned there are no physicals 
required. Later on in the interview, I asked 
why he didn’t try to change things, seeing as he 
has a master’s and seems to have his head 
together. Dirk mentioned, “Go up the line. Joe 
would listen.” I said, “Listen?” and Dirk said, 
“Yeah, Joe would listen.” At this point, Bruce, 
a bubbling and brassy guy who is a millwright 
in charge of special-projects maintenance, came 
in. The interview with Dirk was about thirty 
minutes under way; the next twenty minutes 
I spent with Dirk, he mentioned Ben Richardson, 
the president. I asked, “Do men like to see BR?” 
Dirk responded, “No, BR is bad news in the 
laminating plant.” He also mentioned that in 
the year he has been there, BR had been down 
to the laminating plant only five times.
Item from Bruce: “I’ve had thirty projects in the 
year I’ve been here; I only finished one. Joe 
keeps jerking me around. As I get something 
operating but not all the kinks out, I’m on to 
something else.” Bruce also mentioned that he 
is on emergency call every other week. He 
splits it with the other maintenance person.
The beam stacks before and after planing were 
mentioned as being in terrible disarray. Bruce 
mentioned that the Roseburg plants had a 
computer and a big yard with designated areas 
to organize their stacks. He said that this company 
should take a bulldozer and knock out the field 
to expand the outside stack area.
Item from Bruce: “Antiquated machinery. Main￾tenance is costly and time-consuming.” Bruce 
commented on BR: “Joe thinks labor is cheap; we 
don’t have that many benefits. An example of 
BR’s attitude: one of his right-hand men got in a 
flap over the 3:30 A.M. shift parking down here 
instead of in the muddy, rutted parking lot an 
eighth of a mile up the road. Christ, they had a 
caterpillar running up there, and they didn’t 
even smooth it out. Anyway, this guy tells Rolf, 
the super, if these guys are too lazy to walk down 
from the workers’ parking lot, they can go work 
somewhere else.” This was mentioned right in 
front of some of the men. Bruce went on to say, 
“It really makes us feel wanted.” I then asked 
who was this guy, BR’s right-hand man, and 
Bruce said, “I don’t want to say. . . . What the hell, 
I’m quitting this heap in a while anyway. It was 
Wayne Teeterman, BR’s special-projects director.” 
During most of Bruce’s spiel, Dirk appeared to be 
quite happy with what Bruce was saying; I’m 
sure he was glad he didn’t have to say it 
himself.
It was mentioned that the sawmill didn’t have 
a lunchroom, so the laminated plant felt favo￾red. Also, Rolf mentioned that the bathroom 
was one of the best in BR’s operations.
Bruce on Rolf: “He, Rolf, is a nice guy. Nobody 
respects him, though.”
Dirk and Bruce mentioned that there are only 
six or seven men who have made it ten years in 
all of BR’s five companies.
Dirk on Joe: “Joe does too much. He keeps it all 
in his head. He is efficient. It would take two 
people to replace him. He’s overworked, he 
doesn’t like the hours, and he’s just trying to 
keep his job.” Bruce concurred on the above 
points.
Bruce: “Stacks of beams are too high. Two of 
them fell last week. Damned near got me and 
another guy.” I noted that the accidental death 
last year and its details were repeated to me 
three times during the day.
Bruce mentioned that he recently organized a 
softball team. “The first thing this plant has 
ever had. It’s hard practicing and playing games 
with all the overtime. We went to BR to ask 
him for $700 to start it up. He gave us $250. 726 PART 7 Special Applications of Organization Development
There’s fourteen teams in our league, and the 
minimum anyone else has gotten is $700.”
Dirk mentioned that the workers peak out at 
$8 an hour after one year. He seemed to think 
that money was a big motivating factor.
In response to my query why there was no 
union, Bruce and Dirk mentioned that hearsay 
has it that when union representatives came, 
BR said, “Fine, if you want a union, I’ll just 
close the place down.”
Dirk: “Communication is the main problem. Joe 
schedules some changes, and I never hear about 
them.”
Bruce, on the foremen meetings with BR: “Hell, 
the foremen will have their say, and in the end 
BR will stand up and say, ‘This is the way it’s 
going to be because I pay the checks.’ ”
About five minutes before the session ended, Joe 
came in and with a friendly greeting said, “There 
you are,” to Bruce and indirectly to Dirk. Dirk 
got up as if getting ready to go back to work. 
Bruce stalled. Bruce then said that he didn’t 
know how BR made any money on the opera￾tion. Dirk giggled lightly and nodded his head.
In the afternoon, I spent an hour and a half to 
two hours with Rolf, the superintendent. About 
an hour of this talking was Rolf trying to prove 
his competence by divulging intricate, technical, 
and totally useless details of the plant. I got 
some tasty stuff anyway, and here it is:
Me: “What does Joe do?”
Rolf: “So doggone many things, I don’t know.” 
Then he went on to mention he is a general 
manager in charge of scheduling and raw mate￾rials procurement and to rattle off two or three 
more. I said, “What’s your working relationship 
with Joe?” Rolf said, “I implement his sched￾ules. Dirk, the head of the finishing and planing 
department, and I get Joe’s schedules. Joe will 
skip me whenever he wants to make changes—
goes right to planing and finishing. Then I have 
to go see what’s going on.” I asked him if he 
thought it would be more efficient if Joe 
went through him. Rolf said, “No, we get along 
well. Joe saves time by going directly to the work￾ers. We spend a lot of time after the shift going 
over and discussing what happened and plan￾ning for the next day and weeks ahead.”
Rolf mentioned that there are often schedule 
changes when customers’ trucks pick up their 
orders. I wondered if maybe they could get 
tougher with the customers, and Rolf said, “No, 
we’d lose them.”
Rolf mentioned that the company deals with 
brokers, not contractors. He said that customers 
sometimes cancel their orders.
On Bruce’s idea of bulldozing a pasture to 
expand finish-beam storage, Rolf said that in 
the winter it was tough enough to keep the field 
clear with the current area.
Rolf on equipment: “BR gives us the junkiest 
stuff to work with.” He went on to mention 
one particular piece of machinery that has four 
wheels and five feet of clearance (I don’t know 
what it is called): “It has no brakes and no shut￾off; you have to idle it to kill it.”
On Joe: “Joe’s good; he and I go to bat for the 
guys.”
Me: “You must have a pretty little bat; I hear 
BR is a tough guy to get through to.”
Rolf: “Yeah, he picks his battles.”
On Dirk: “Effective, will improve with time; he 
doesn’t always see the opportunities for utiliz￾ing stock beams. He has his master’s degree in 
glue technology.”
On John: “Quality control marginal.” That’s all 
he said.
On Nita, BR’s secretary: “She doesn’t always use 
her power right.”
On Sue, Joe’s secretary: “She does the work of 
two people. Has lots of customer respect; they 
often comment on her.”
On Joe: “He’s too intelligent for the job. I don’t 
know why he does not get something better. 
I guess he likes to work.”
On Rich: “Rich does his job well.”
On the workforce: “There are three types of 
guys. One is eight to five and a paycheck—never 
volunteers or does anything extra—50% of the 
workforce. Second are the ones who use work￾ers’ compensation to get time off all the time; 
this is 20%. Workers’ compensation is the big￾gest deterrent to an effective workforce,” he 
went on to comment. “And third, the ones who 
try, 30%.”
Rolf mentioned that 15 to 20% of the work 
hours were spent trying to unsort the beam 
piles, pre- and postplaner.INTEGRATIVE CASES 727
Rolf mentioned that architectural beams, 
7 to 12% of the output, took three times as 
long to process as the plain beams.
On Joe again: “Joe does a good job of scheduling 
and customer relations.”
On BR: “BR is secretive; he should keep the 
guys informed.”
Rolf often has to juggle men around on their 
tasks and catches a lot of flack for this. I asked 
his criteria for deciding which men would go 
on which jobs. They were (1) how well the 
man will do the job and (2) how easy it is to 
replace him at his original task.
Rolf said overtime is a big problem. It’s neces￾sary to go through the jobs in order. Men never 
know how long they’ll have to work. Lock-ups 
have to be finished. He mentioned that a good 
lock-up will take an hour, a bad one, one and a 
half to two hours. (A lock-up is essentially glu￾ing and clamping the beam into a form.)
Rolf said he used to spend three hours a day on 
the glue crew. He doesn’t do this anymore; he 
has a good crew. Eighty percent of the glue 
crew are good workers, in Rolf’s opinion. He 
mentioned that two of the bad ones quit 
because they didn’t want overtime. Also, Rolf 
noted that it was possible to avoid overtime by 
scheduling good or easy lock-ups. This was 
done when the glue crew had been putting in 
too much overtime.
Rolf stated that the overall problem with the 
operation was that everyone knows that “BR 
doesn’t give a shit about them.” I asked him if 
there was anything he liked about working for 
the company, and he said, “I like working for 
Joe.” We ended the interview with Rolf saying, 
“Overall, it’s not a bad place to work; the 
checks don’t bounce.”
PREPARING THE DIAGNOSIS
Jack Lawler leaned back in his chair and 
stretched. It had all come back. Now he needed 
a plan for working. It seemed that the first step 
was to determine what ideas, models, or theories 
would be useful in ordering and understanding 
the information he had. Then he would have to 
do a diagnosis and, finally, think about what to 
say to Ben Richardson and Richard Bowman. 
After buzzing his secretary to say that he didn’t 
want to be interrupted, Lawler rolled up his 
sleeves and began to work.
Questions
1. How would you assess Jack Lawler’s entry 
and contracting process at B. R. Richardson? 
Would you have done anything differently?
2. What theories or models would you use to 
make sense out of the diagnostic data? How 
would you organize the information for 
feedback to Ben Richardson and Richard 
Bowman? How would you carry out the 
feedback process?
3. What additional information would you 
have liked Jack Lawler and his team to 
collect? Discuss.

GLOSSARY
glossary
This glossary was prepared to help the reader to 
understand some of the more frequently used terms 
in OD. Not all the terms in the glossary appear in 
the text, but they are frequently used in the field. 
Conversly, the glossary does not attempt to define 
every term used in the text. Nevertheless, knowl￾edge of the terms in the glossary can be useful 
in understanding what at times appears to be an 
overly specialized language.
Accountability Responsibility to produce a 
promised result within a specific time.
Achievement needs A phrase applied to an 
individual, referring to the desire to perform work 
successfully and to advance in one’s career.
Achievement orientation In cross-cultural 
analysis, the extent to which a culture favors the 
acquisition of power and resources.
Acquisition The purchase of one organization by 
another. (See Merger.)
Action learning A form of action research in 
which the focus is helping organizations to learn 
from their actions how to create entirely new 
structures, processes, and behaviors. Also called 
action science, self-design, or appreciative inquiry, this 
process involves considerable trial-and- error learn￾ing as participants try out new ways of operating, 
assess progress, and make necessary adjustments. 
(See Action research.)
Action research A cyclical process of diagnosis￾change-research-diagnosis-change-research. The 
results of diagnosis produce ideas for changes, the 
changes are introduced into the same system, and 
their effects noted through further research and 
diagnosis. The number of cycles may be infinite.
Active listening Reflecting back to the other per￾son not only what the person has said but also the 
perceived emotional tone of the message.
Adaptive A term used to describe the behavior of 
many kinds of systems. Originally used mainly to 
describe individuals (for example, adaptive behav￾ior), it is now applied to groups and organizations 
vis-à-vis their environment.
Alliance A partnership between two organizations 
where their resources and capabilities are com￾bined to pursue mutual goals in developing, manu￾facturing, or distributing goods and services.
Appreciative inquiry A contemporary approach to 
planned change. Contrary to typical approaches 
that assume organ izations are like problems to 
be solved, appreciative inquiry works under the 
assumption that organizations are like mysteries to 
be understood. A focus on the “best of what is” in 
an organization provides the necessary vision for 
change.
Authenticity A term synonymous with the collo￾quial phrase “to be straight with another person.” 
It refers to one’s openness and honesty.
Balanced scorecard A control and information 
system that balances traditional financial measures 
with operational measures relating to an organiza￾tion’s critical success factors.
Behavioral science A phrase for the various disci￾plines that study human behavior. As such, all of 
the traditional social sciences are included.
Benchmarking A process where companies find 
out how other companies do something better than 
they do and then try to imitate or improve on the 
activity.
Body language An important part of nonverbal 
communications that involves the transmittal of 
thoughts, actions, and feelings through bodily 
movements and how other people interpret them.
Boundary A term used to describe systems or fields 
of interacting forces. Boundaries can be physi￾cal, such as a wall between two departments in an 
organization. More subtly, boundaries can be social 
processes, such as the boundaries between ethnic 
groups. Boundaries can be temporal: Things done 
at different times are said to be bounded from each 
other. Any set of forces or factors that tend to dif￾ferentiate parts of the system can be said to have a 
boundary effect.
Breakthrough A sudden and significant advance, 
especially in knowledge, technique, or results.GLOSSARY 747
Career The sequence of behaviors and attitudes 
associated with past, present, and anticipated 
future work-related experiences and role activities. 
A career is work related and lifelong.
Career development Activities directed at help￾ing people to attain career objectives. These may 
include skill training, performance feedback 
and coaching, job rotation, mentoring roles, and 
challenging and visible job assignments.
Career planning Activities aimed at helping people 
to choose occupations, organizations, and jobs. It 
involves setting individual career goals.
Change management The tools, techniques, and 
processes that scope, resource, and direct activities 
to implement a change. Change management is less 
concerned about the transfer of knowledge, skill, 
and capacity to manage change in the future than 
organization development.
Client system The person, group, or organization 
that is the object of diagnosis or change efforts. 
Often shortened to the client. The client may be in 
the same organization as the consultant, as in the 
case of a line manager who is the client of a staff 
group, or the client and consultant may be in dif￾ferent organizations.
Closed system The tendency to disregard relations 
between a system and its environment. This is 
often an unwitting simplification and, as such, can 
lead to error.
Closure, need for A commonly felt need to see 
something finished or brought to a logical end 
point. Sometimes it is used to describe a per￾son who is uncomfortable with ambiguity and 
uncertainty.
Coaching An intervention designed to improve the 
competencies of individual organization members 
through committed support, feedback, new views 
of work, new visions of the organization, and new 
ways of relating to people.
Collateral organization A parallel, coexisting struc￾ture that can be used to supplement the existing
formal organization. It is generally used to solve 
ill-defined problems that do not fit neatly into the 
formal organizational structure.
Communication, one-way and two-way One-way 
communication describes an interaction in which 
one or both parties are paying little attention to 
what the other is saying or doing. In two-way com￾munication, presumably both parties are engaging

Confrontation meeting A structured intervention 
that helps two (or more) groups resolve interdepart￾mental misunderstandings or conflict.
Consultant An individual (change agent) who is 
assisting an organization (client system) to become 
more effective. An external consultant is not a 
member of the system. An internal consultant is a 
member of the organization being assisted but may 
or may not have a job title that identifies the indi￾vidual as such.
Content analysis A data analysis technique that 
derives themes from qualitative data such as 
interview responses.

there is no universal best way to design an organi￾zation, that the design instead depends upon the 
situation.
Continuous improvement A philosophy of 
designing and managing all aspects of an 
organization in a never-ending quest for quality. 
The notion is that no matter how well things are

them better, and hundreds of small improvements 
can make a big difference in overall functioning. 
Also known as kaizen.

employees relate to one another and to signifi￾cant others, such as suppliers, customers, and 
government agencies.
Cost of quality The financial impact of poor 
quality. The cost of quality consists of the cost 
of conformance, nonconformance, and lost 
opportunity. The cost of conformance includes 
expenses associated with prevention measures,

of work. A customer may be either internal or 
external.
Data-based intervention A specific technique inac￾tion research. It follows some data collection phase

Diagnosis The process of collecting information 
about a client system and working collaboratively 
with it to understand the system’s current function￾ing. Diagnosis follows entry and contracting, and pre￾cedes action planning and implementation. Diagnosis 
is expected to point to possible interventions to 
address system effectiveness.
Differentiation The extent to which individual 
organizational units are different from each other 
along a variety of dimensions, such as time, tech￾nology, or formality. High uncertainty leads to the 
need for more differentiation, and low uncertainty

were explicitly established in policy and procedure 
(for example, the formal organization). The term 
has been prefixed to many types of organizational 
phenomena.
Functional The term describes those parts of a 
system that promote the attainment of its goals. It 
comes from a mode of systems analysis that seeks 
to explain systems by understanding the effects 
that parts of the system have on one another and 
the mutual effects between the system and its 
environment.

assessing whether an intervention is responsible for 
producing observed results, such as improvements 
in job satisfaction, productivity, and absenteeism. 
(See External validity.)
Intervention Any action on the part of a change
