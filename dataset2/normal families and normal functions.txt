Normal Families and 
Normal Functions
This book centers on normal families of holomorphic and meromorphic func￾tions and also normal functions. The authors treat one complex variable, several 
complex variables, and infinitely many complex variables (i.e., Hilbert space).
The theory of normal families is more than 100 years old. It has played a seminal 
role in the function theory of complex variables. It was used in the first rigorous 
proof of the Riemann mapping theorem. It is used to study automorphism groups 
of domains, geometric analysis, and partial differential equations.
The theory of normal families led to the idea, in 1957, of normal functions as 
developed by Lehto and Virtanen. This is the natural class of functions for treat￾ing the Lindelof principle. The latter is a key idea in the boundary behavior of 
holomorphic functions.
This book treats normal families, normal functions, the Lindelof principle, and 
other related ideas. Both the analytic and the geometric approaches to the subject 
area are offered. The authors include many incisive examples.
The book could be used as the text for a graduate research seminar. It would also 
be useful reading for established researchers and for budding complex analysts.

Normal families are a powerful tool in function theory, differential equations,
geometry, and many other parts of mathematics.
The idea of normal family of holomorphic functions is usually associated
with the name Montel. Although Montel was the first to formulate the phrase
“normal family”, the concept was in use well before Montel defined it. But
the fact is that Montel’s work was preceded by related ideas of Weierstrass,
Stieltjes, Osgood, and others.
The idea of compactness had emerged as a fundamental concept in analysis
during the nineteenth century: provided a set is bounded in R
n, it is possible
to define for any sequence {xj} of points of the set a subsequence {xjk
} which
converges to a point of R
n (the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem).
Riemann had sought to extend this extremely useful property to sets E of
functions of real variables, but it soon appeared that boundedness of E was
not sufficient.
Around 1880, Ascoli introduced the additional condition of equicontinuity
of E, which implies that E has again the Bolzano-Weierstrass property.
But at the beginning of the twentieth century, Ascoli’s theorem had very
few applications, and it was Montel who made it popular by showing how
useful it could be for analytic functions of a complex variable.
His fundamental concept is what he called a normal family, which is a set
H of functions defined in a domain Ω ⊂ C, taking their values in the Riemann
sphere and meromorphic in Ω, and satisfying the following condition: from
any sequence of functions of H it is possible to extract a subsequence that,
on every compact subset of Ω, converges uniformly either to a holomorphic
function or to the point ∞ of the Riemann sphere.
Most of Montel’s mathematical papers are concerned with the theory of
analytic functions of one complex variable, a very active field among French
mathematicians between 1880 and 1940.
Montel’s central observation is that if H consists of uniformly bounded
holomorphic functions in Ω, then it is a normal family; this is a consequence
of the Cauchy integral formula and of Ascoli’s theorem. From this criterion
follow many others; for instance, if the values of the functions of a set H belong
to a domain Ω that can be mapped conformally onto a bounded domain, then
H is a normal family. This is the case in particular when Ω is the complement
of a set of two points in the complex plane C.
Montel showed how the introduction of normal families may bring substan￾tial simplifications in the proofs of many classical results of function theory
viiviii Preface
such as the mapping theorem of Riemann and Hadamard’s characterization
of entire functions of finite order. An ingenious application is to the proof
of Picard’s theorem on essential singularities: suppose 0 is an essential sin￾gularity of a function f holomorphic in Ω := {0 < |z| ≤ 1}. Then Picard’s
theorem asserts that f(z) takes on all finite complex values, with one possi￾ble exception, as z ranges through Ω. It can be proved by observing that if
there are two values that f does not take in Ω, then the family of functions
fn(z) = f (z/2
n) in the annulus Γ : 1
2 ≤ |z| ≤ 1 would be a normal family,
and there would be either a subsequence (fmk
) with |fmk
(z)| ≤ M in Γ or a
subsequence with |fmk
(z)| ≥ 1/M in Γ, contradicting the assumption that 0
is an essential singularity of f.
Montel’s works solidified this circle of ideas, and he provided the name
“normal family”. This led to work of Valiron that was later developed by
Lohwater-Pommerenke and Zalcman. Montel also proved the very elegant
theorem—characterizing normal families—that every mathematics student
learns.
Today the theory of normal families has blossomed into a subject area all
its own. There are a number of mathematicians (including these authors) who
specialize in the study of normal families.
And, in the past 50 years, new ideas have grown out of Montel’s concept.
The idea of normal functions is one of the best and most fruitful of these. As
we show in this text, normal functions (a natural generalization of bounded
holomorphic functions) are the natural context in which to study normal fam￾ilies.
The genesis of the idea of normal function began with a paper of Kosaku
Yosida in 1934. In 1939, Noshiro introduced the notion of normal function
(although the notion of normal family existed at this time, he did not use
that name; he says, after Yosida, that such function belongs to class (A)).
This name was given to these functions much later in another pioneering
paper in this vein—the 1957 paper of Lehto and Virtanen. In that article,
Lehto and Virtanen showed that the notion of a normal meromorphic function
is closely related to some of the most important problems of the boundary
behavior of meromorphic functions. The 1957 paper of Lehto and Virtanen
really formalized the concept of normal function and is the standard reference
today.
What we try to do in this book is to put the study of normal families and
normal functions into a natural, geometric context. Inspired by the ideas of
H. H. Wu, we treat normal families and functions on complex manifolds. We
describe the relationship of these ideas with invariant metrics.
We hope that this book will inspire other mathematicians to take up the
gauntlet of normal families. We look forward to feedback from our readership.

Introduction
The history of the concept of uniform convergence is a paradigm in the history
of ideas in modern mathematics. One of the earliest results on the uniform con￾vergence of a sequence of holomorphic functions is attributed to Weierstrass: if
f1, f2, . . . are holomorphic in a plane region D and if fj → f uniformly on D,
then f is holomorphic in D. We refer the reader to [245] for a comprehensive
survey of, and references to, Weierstrass’s work.
The next major advance toward a theory of normal families was perhaps
that of Stieltjes who, in 1894 in a paper on continued fractions [273], proved
that if a sequence of holomorphic functions is uniformly bounded in a plane re￾gion D, and converges uniformly on some nonempty, open subset of D, then it
converges, uniformly on each compact subset of D, to a function holomorphic
in D. This may have been the first result in which convergence is obtained on
a larger region than that covered by the given hypotheses.
Next, in 1901 Osgood showed that, for uniformly bounded sequences, it is
sufficient to assume that convergence occurs on a dense subset of D [230] (see
also [11]). In 1904 Porter [240] showed that it is sufficient for convergence to
occur on a curve in D, and then later, Vitali [282, 283] and, independently,
Porter [239], proved, again for uniformly bounded functions, that it is suffi￾cient for the functions to converge on a sequence of points that converges to
a point in D (see also [121, 174]). Note that these results imply that a uni￾formly bounded family of functions, each holomorphic in a plane region D, is
(according to the terminology introduced later by Montel) a normal family.
Paul Montel created the theory of normal families of holomorphic (or mero￾morphic) functions over 115 years ago. Montel’s work on normal families began
in 1907, but the term “normal family” was first employed in 1911 [197]. Mon￾tel’s theory of normal families was quite powerful. In the first two decades of
the twentieth century Montel applied his theory of normal families to a vari￾ety of subjects within complex function theory. Montel’s first mature works
on normal families are the papers [200, written in 1912], [201, written in 1916]
and [195, written in 1917]. The results from these papers are also presented
in his book Familles Normales, first published in 1927. In both [200, written
in 1912] and [201, written in 1916], he treated the Picard theory, and in [195,
written in 1917], he proved the Riemann mapping theorem as well as several
other theorems related to conformal mapping.
Although Montel was the first to use the phrase “normal family”, the
concept was in use well before Montel defined it. In an attempt to avoid

anachronistic use of the term, the phrase “Property N” will be used to indicate
the use of the concept of normality prior to Montel’s first use of the term. The
nineteenth-century conception of Property N was a little different from the
definition of normality given nowadays since the limit function usually was
not allowed to be infinite. Principal among those who studied families with
Property N in the nineteenth century were Cesare Ascoli (1843–1896) and
Giulio Arzelà (1847–1912). Each of these mathematicians offered early proofs
of what is nowadays a central theorem in the study of normal families, the
so-called Ascoli-Arzelà Theorem, which is stated below for complex functions
of a single variable.
Theorem 1.0.1 (Ascoli-Arzelà). Let F be an equicontinuous family of com￾plex functions defined on a domain D ⊂ C (i.e. for any given ε > 0 and any
compact subset K in D, there exists a positive number δ, depending only on ε
and K, such that |gj (z) − g(w)| < ε holds for all z, w ∈ K and all j) with the
property that for each z ∈ D the set {f(z) : f ∈ F} is bounded. Then F is a
normal family.
It should be emphasized that Ascoli and Arzelà each proved this theorem
only for real functions; in addition, both mathematicians were apparently
working under the implicit assumption that the families of functions they
considered were uniformly bounded.
At the beginning of the twentieth century Ascoli’s theorem had very few
applications, and it was Montel who made it popular by showing how useful
it could be for analytic functions of a complex variable. Montel’s first pub￾lished version of the Ascoli-Arzelà theorem appeared in his Comptes Rendus
note [194, written in 1904] where he claimed that uniform boundedness was
a sufficient condition for Property N to hold. In [198, written in 1907] Montel
also offered proofs of the Ascoli-Arzelà theorem for both real and complex
functions, which he then used to prove what is often called Montel’s theo￾rem. Although he proved this theorem in [198, written in 1907], the following
statement is from [193, written in 1910]:
Theorem 1.0.2 (Montel). If a family of complex analytic functions F is
uniformly bounded on a domain D ⊂ C, then “from any infinite sequence of
functions from the family, a new sequence can be extracted which converges
uniformly in the domain D to an analytic limit function”.
This theorem was also established independently by Koebe [138].
The first step of Montel’s proof of this theorem involved a very simple ap￾plication of the Cauchy integral theorem which proves that uniformly bounded
families of analytic functions are equicontinuous. His theorem follows imme￾diately from the Ascoli-Arzelà Theorem.
Montel refers to Arzelà in the footnote on [193, p. 27], and, from then,
essentially all accounts of normal families in complex analysis (see, for exam￾ple, [46, 111, 179, 196, 245, 259, 260]) have followed this development from
equicontinuity and convergence to normal families.Introduction 3
A more modern view is that a family is normal if it is relatively compact
(that is, has compact closure) in some larger space of (usually continuous)
functions endowed with the compact-open topology (see, for example, [56, 97,
126, 274]). From this perspective (for example, in several complex variables),
the emphasis shifts from sequential compactness to compactness.
An overview of the early history of normal families can be found in the
book of Daniel S. Alexander [7] or in the paper of Beardon and Minda [20].
This is a good place to mention that the short article [54, Dieudonné 1990]
devoted to Montel by the Dictionary of Scientific Biography is a very efficient
introduction to normal families.
Montel’s treatise on the subject, Leçons sur les Familles Normales de Fonc￾tions Analytiques et leur Applications, Recueillies et rédigées par J. Barbotte,
Gauthier-Villars, Paris, 1927 (reissued in 1974 by Chelsea, New York), ap￾peared 20 years after the subject began.
For 65 years after the publication of Montel’s treatise, no book devoted to
normal families appeared. And only in 1993, two books on normal families of
one complex variable have appeared — the book by Joel L. Schiff [260] and
one by Chi Tai Chuang [46].
The notion of a normal family plays an important role in the complex func￾tion theory of one complex variable. Montel used the normal family concept
to prove the big Picard theorem, Schottky’s theorem, and Landau’s theorem.
Normal families apply in the fields of entire and meromorphic functions, dis￾tribution of zeros of differential polynomials, ordinary differential equations,
and functional equations. For instance, normal families are closely connected
with a standard proof of the Riemann mapping theorem and with the circle of
ideas surrounding classical theorems of Picard, Schottky, Landau, and Bloch.
One of the most fruitful developments of normal families in recent times is
the well-known rescaling lemma of Zalcman [291]. For surveys of the numerous
applications of this lemma, see [26, 27, 292].
A heuristic principle attributed to André Bloch says that a family of holo￾morphic functions which have a property P in common in a domain Ω ⊂ C
is [apt to be] a normal family in Ω if P cannot be possessed by nonconstant
holomorphic functions in the whole plane C (that is, an entire function). [An
example of such a P is “uniform boundedness”.]
A rigorous formulation and proof of this result was given in 1975 by Zal￾cman [291], with extensions and counterexamples by Minda [189], Rubel [256],
and Pang [231]. The important paper of Caratheódory [39] should also be men￾tioned in this context. Zalcman’s work was inspired by the result of Lohwater
and Pommerenke [176]. Their theorem deals with normal functions, but the
proofs are almost identical, and Zalcman [291] gives major credit to Pom￾merenke for the idea. Pommerenke got the idea from reading Landau [155].
Landau in turn credits Valiron [280] with this idea. Of course what can be
found in Valiron’s paper is still far from the statement of the lemma in Zal￾cman’s paper. We see that Zalcman’s lemma is a beautiful example to show
how mathematics is the work of many people, each one adding a new idea to
the thoughts of the predecessors.4 Introduction
In 2017 appeared the book of Steinmetz [272]. In Section 3.3 the author
gives the alternative proof of the famous Zalcman rescaling lemma. In the
theory of normal families, Steinmetz played an important role by making use
of the rescaling method, treated in detail in [272]. See also Chapter 4 of the
recent book of Schiff [261] where an overview of the theory of normal families
in one complex variables is given.
The concept of normal meromorphic function allows one to attribute to
one function the properties related to some class of functions, namely with
a normal family of meromorphic functions. The idea of such a transfer is
simple; it was first introduced by Yosida [288] in 1934 and was discussed
by Noshiro [226] in 1939. Although normal families had their beginning in
1911 with Paul Montel and normal functions are defined in terms of normal
families, they did not have their formal beginning until 1957 when a large￾scale study was undertaken by Lehto and Virtanen [164, 165]. They showed
that the notion of a normal meromorphic function is closely related to some
of the most important problems of the boundary behaviour of meromorphic
functions. In [164], the authors extended the Lindelöf principle to meromorphic
functions by requiring them to be normal.
In the years since these classic works, much has been written; the interested
reader might consult the bibliography of [46, 260, 272] or that of A. J. Lohwa￾ter’s paper [180].
In Chapter 9 of his treatise, Montel deals with the normal families of
holomorphic functions of two complex variables. Since the publication of this
book, many interesting results have been obtained in the theory of normal
holomorphic functions (maps) and normal families of several complex variables
but there had not appeared a single book on the subject. Therefore a book
like the ones mentioned above has been waiting to be written for a long time.
We do not try to cover all developments in normal families since Montel’s
book, but concentrate mainly on our own results. This manuscript contains
a number of our results concerning the theory of normal families and nor￾mal functions of several complex variables. We have somewhat revised and
supplemented them with some of our later investigations.
In keeping with the usual practice in mathematics, we have attributed
results to the author (s) who first proved them in one complex variable. But
the form in which the results are presented in the manuscript is different from
the original ones; at least all one-dimensional results are valid for meromorphic
functions. The reader is advised to consult the relevant sources.
We have made some effort at the end of the book to give references to
related work; any omissions of references are inadvertent and regretted by both
of us. Typographical errors and mathematical slips are the pain and shame of
any author. We would appreciate any such being called to our attention.2
A Glimpse of Normal Families
Preamble: This short chapter is composed of very basic and very easy ma￾terial, likely familiar to most readers in one form or other, but we record it
here for later reference and to fix notation and terminology. Only very modest
specific knowledge is required of the prospective reader. What is really ex￾pected of the reader is a level of mathematical maturity comparable to that
fostered by books like Ahlfors [4, 5 Normal families, pp. 219–227], Greene and
Krantz [91, Chapter 6], Marshall [185, Chapter 10.1], Gunning and Rossi [98,
pp. 10–12], and Narasimhan [218, pp. 7–11], but we by no means require a
mastery of the contents of these outstanding classics.
We will let C represent the field of complex numbers and R the subfield of
real numbers.
Let C
n = C × · · · × C denote the n-dimensional complex Euclidean
space with product topology. The coordinates of C
n will be denoted by
z = (z1, . . . , zn) with zj = xj +iyj , 1 ≤ j ≤ n. Thus, C
n can be identified with
R
2n in a natural manner, z 7→ (x1, y1, . . . , xn, yn).
A domain is defined to be an open, connected set in C
n.
Definition 2.0.1. Let {gj} be a sequence of complex-valued, continuous func￾tions on a domain Ω ⊂ C
n which converges to a limit function g. If, for any
given ε > 0 and any compact subset K in Ω, there exists a positive integer j0
depending only on ε and K, such that
|gj (z) − g(z)| < ε
holds for all z ∈ K and all j > j0, then we say that {gj} converges uniformly
on compact subsets of Ω.
Definition 2.0.2. A family, F of continuous functions on a domain Ω ⊂ C
n
is said to be normal on Ω provided every sequence {fj} ⊆ F contains a
subsequence which converges uniformly on compact subsets of Ω.
This definition does not require the limit functions of the convergent sub￾sequences to be members F.
In view of the Heine-Borel theorem, locally uniform convergence is the
same as uniform convergence on each compact subset of Ω.
In what follows, P(a, r) will denote the open polydisk centered at the point
a = (a1, . . . , an) and with polyradius r = (r1, . . . , rn). That is,
P(a, r) = {z ∈ C
n
: |zk − ak| < rk, k = 1, . . . , n} ⊆ Ω
DOI: 10.1201/9781032669861-2 56 A Glimpse of Normal Families
The corresponding closed polydisk will be denoted P(a, r). Note that P(a, r)
is just the Cartesian product of the open disks D(aν, rν) ∈ C and D(a, r)
is the Cartesian product of the closed disks D(aν, rν). The set Γ :=
{z ∈ C
n : |zν − aν| = rν} is usually called the distinguished boundary of
P(a, r).
The following lemma says that normality is a local property.
Lemma 2.0.3. Suppose Ω is a domain in C
n and suppose that
Ω = [∞
j=0
Pj ,
where Pj ⊂ Ω are closed polydisks. A family of continuous functions F is nor￾mal on Ω if and only if, for each j, every sequence in F contains a subsequence
which converges uniformly on Pj .
Proof of Lemma 2.0.3. This lemma can be proved in a manner which is ab￾solutely analogous to the case of one variable.
The only if part follows by definition. Suppose that, for each j, every se￾quence in F contains a subsequence which converges uniformly on Pj . Suppose
{fn} ⊂ F. Then there is a subsequence n
f
(1)
n
o
⊂ {fn} such that n
f
(1)
n
o
con￾verges uniformly on P1. Likewise, there is a sequence n
f
(2)
n
o
⊂
n
f
(1)
n
o
which
converges uniformly on P 2
, and indeed there is a sequence n
f
(k)
n
o
⊂
n
f
(k−1)
n
o
which converges uniformly on Pk. Then the “diagonal” sequence n
f
(k)
k
o
con￾verges uniformly on each Pj , since it is a subsequence of n
f
(k)
n
o
for each k. A
compact set K ⊂ Ω can be covered by finitely many polydisks, so the diagonal
sequence converges uniformly on K.
Remark 2.0.4. There is no loss of generality in assuming Ω = ∪∞
j=0Pj . To see
this, we recall (see [271, Theorem 1 on p. 167]) that every nonvoid open set
in C
n ≈ R2n is a union of a denumerable set of closed cubes {Kj}, Kj ⊂ Ω,
the sides of which are parallel to the coordinate planes and which are pairwise
without common interior points. Since Kj is compact, there are finitely many
points a
1
j
, . . . , a
Nj
j
contained in the interior of Kj , such that Kj is contained
in a union of finitely many closed polydisk P
k
j
(a
k
j
, rk
j
) ⊂ Ω with center at a
k
j
and some polyradius r
k
j
such that
Kj ⊂
[
Nj
k=1
P
k
j
(a
k
j
, rk
j
) ⊂ Ω.
Hence
Ω = [∞
j=1
Kj ⊆
[∞
j=1
[
Nj
k=1
P
k
j
(a
k
j
, rk
j
) ⊆ Ω.A Glimpse of Normal Families 7
It follows that
Ω = [∞
j=1
[
Nj
k=1
P
k
j
(a
k
j
, rk
j
).
A countable union of finite sets is countable. After a suitable renumbering, we
obtain that Ω may be written as a denumerable union of closed polydisks.
The space of continuous functions on an open set Ω ⊂ C
n will be denoted
by C(Ω), the space of k times continuously differentiable functions on an open
set Ω in a Euclidean space by C
k
(Ω), and the space of infinitely differentiable
functions on Ω by C∞(Ω).
For any f ∈ C(Ω) and compact K ⊂ Ω put
kfkK := sup
z∈K
|f| .
We can define a metric on the space C(Ω) as follows. Let Ω be any proper
open subset of C
n. Now let 
Pj
	
be a sequence of closed polydisks of Ω such
that
Pj ⊂ Ω and Ω = [∞
j=0
Pj .
For any continuous functions f, g ∈ C(Ω) define
d(f, g) := X∞
j+1
1
2
j
kf − gkP j
1 + kf − gkP j
.
It is routine to confirm that d is a metric on C(Ω):
1. If d(f, g) = 0, then f = g on each Pj and hence on Ω,
2. We have d(f, g) = d(g, f) for f, g ∈ C(Ω),
3. We have d(f, g) ≤ d(f, h) + d(h, g) for f, g, h ∈ C(Ω).
The following criterion is sometimes useful.
Theorem 2.0.5. A sequence {fj} converges uniformly on compact subsets of
Ω to f ∈ C(Ω) if and only if d(fj , f) → 0.
Proof. See the proof of Proposition 10.3 in [185] on page 157.
We have shown that convergence with respect to the distance d is equiva￾lent to convergence on compact sets. Compactness and sequential compactness
are the same for metric spaces. A family is normal if and only if its closure is
compact in this topology.
Definition 2.0.6. A function f is said to be locally bounded at a point p ∈ Ω,
if there is a neighborhood V of p such that |f(z)| is bounded on V . A function
f(z) is said to be locally bounded if f(z) is locally bounded at every point of
Ω.8 A Glimpse of Normal Families
Definition 2.0.7. A family F of functions on Ω is called locally bounded or
bounded on compact sets if, for every compact set K contained in Ω, there is
a constant M (depending on K) such that |f(z)| ≤ M for every z in K and
every function f in the family F.
In other words, F is uniformly bounded in a neighborhood of each point
of Ω. In the literature this property is sometimes referred to as local uniform
boundedness. Since any compact subset K ⊂ Ω can be covered by a finite
number of such neighborhoods, it follows that a locally bounded family F is
uniformly bounded on compact subsets of Ω.
Definition 2.0.8. A family of functions F defined on a set S ⊂ C
n is
1. equicontinuous at w ∈ S if for each ε > 0 there exists a δ > 0 so
that if z ∈ S and |z − w| < δ, then |f(z) − f(w)| < ε for all f ∈ F;
2. equicontinuous on S if it is equicontinuous at each w ∈ S;
3. uniformly equicontinuous on S if for each ε > 0 there exists a
δ > 0 so that if z, w ∈ S with |z − w| < δ then |f(z) − f(w)| < ε
for all f ∈ F.
Next, the central result linking normal families and equicontinuity:
Theorem 2.0.9. (Arzelà-Ascoli) A family F of continuous functions is nor￾mal on a domain Ω ⊂ C
n if and only if
1. F is equicontinuous on Ω and
2. there is a point z
0 ∈ Ω so that the collection 
f(z
0
) : f ∈ F	
is
a bounded subset of C.
Proof. The proof of this theorem is the same as the proof of Arzelà-Ascoli’s
theorem in [185, Theorem 10.5, p. 158] for n = 1.
Remark 2.0.10. The proof is actually valid for any metric space. For a proof
see for example Lang [159, p. 57].
Definition 2.0.11. A complex-valued C
1
function f(z) defined on an open
subset Ω of C
n is called holomorphic, denoted by f ∈ O(Ω), if f(z) is holo￾morphic in each variable zj when the other variables are fixed. In other words,
f(z) satisfies

A family F is said to be locally bounded in Ω if the functions in F are
uniformly bounded in some neighborhood of each point of Ω. For families
of holomorphic functions local boundedness is sufficient for normality, and
indeed necessary, if the family is bounded at some point of the domain of
definition. The proof essentially uses the Arzelà-Ascoli theorem that a family
is normal if it is equicontinuous and pointwise bounded. An application of
the Cauchy integral formula shows that if a family F of analytic functions is
locally bounded, then so is F
0 = {f
0
: f ∈ F}, and equicontinuity follows.
Theorem 2.0.12. The following are equivalent for a family F of holomorphic
functions on a region Ω ⊂ C
n:
(1) F is normal on Ω;
(2) F is locally bounded on Ω;
(3) F
0 = {∇zf : f ∈ F} is locally bounded on Ω and there is a z0 ∈
Ω so that {f(z0) : f ∈ F} is a bounded subset of C. Here ∇zf := 

.
Proof. The proof of this theorem is very similar to the proof for n = 1 [185,
Theorem 10.7, p. 160]. The extra differences involved are only technicalities.
Suppose F is normal. By the proof of Theorem 2.0.9, for each w ∈ Ω,
{f(w) : f ∈ F} is bounded. By equicontinuity, each w ∈ Ω is contained in the
interior of a closed polidisk P(w, r) ⊂ Ω such that
|f(z) − f(w)| < 1 for all z ∈ P(w, r), f ∈ F.
It follows F is locally bounded.
Now suppose F is locally bounded on Ω.
By hypothesis there exists a constant M such that |f| ≤ M on a closed
polydisk

from this it follows that F

is locally bounded at z

and (3) holds.10 A Glimpse of Normal Families
Finally, if (3) holds and z ∈ Ω, then |∇zf| ≤ L for z in a some polydisk

for all
f ∈ F. This confirms the equicontinuous F at z

, an arbitrary point of Ω. By
the Arzelà-Ascoli Theorem 2.0.9, F is normal.
Holomorphic functions of several variables have compactness properties
with respect to locally uniform convergence identical to the one variable case.
A standard result in complex analysis says that the locally uniform limit of a
sequence of holomorphic functions is again holomorphic.
The next two classical results of several complex variables find frequent
application throughout the text.
Weierstrass proved that the set of holomorphic functions on a domain in
C
n is closed under uniform convergence on compact sets.
Theorem 2.0.13 (Weierstrass). Let {fj} be a sequence of holomorphic func￾tions on a domain Ω ⊂ C
n which converges uniformly on compact subsets of
Ω to a function f. Then f is holomorphic in Ω, and for any k = (k1, . . . , kn)
the sequence of derivatives ∂
|k|
fj
∂zk converges uniformly on compact subsets of
Ω to ∂
|k|
f
∂zk .
Proof. The proof is essentially the same as the classical proof of the Weier￾strass theorem in one complex variable. For holomorphic functions of one
variable, this is a standard result. Its proof is a simple application of Mor￾era’s theorem and Cauchy’s formula. In the several variable case, we simply
apply this result in each variable separately (with the other variables fixed) to
conclude that the limit of a sequence of holomorphic functions, converging uni￾formly on compacta, is holomorphic in each variable separately. Such a limitA Glimpse of Normal Families 11
is also obviously continuous, and so is holomorphic by Osgood’s lemma (we
could appeal to Hartog’s theorem but we really only need the more elementary
Osgood’s lemma).
It is routine to confirm that a sequence of holomorphic functions {fj}
converges uniformly on compact subsets of Ω if and only if {fj} converges
uniformly in any polydisk which belongs to Ω. So, it is enough to prove the
second part of the theorem for an open polydisk and the derivative with respect
to a single variable zν. Let a ∈ Ω, and choose r > 0 so that
P(a, r) = {z ∈ C
n
: |zk − ak| < r, k = 1, . . . , n} ⊂ Ω.
Let 2δ be the distance from P(a, r) to C
n\Ω, so that P(a, r) ⊂ P(a, r+δ) ⊂ Ω.
Then, by the Cauchy integral formula, for any z ∈ P(a, r + δ),

where Γ is the distinguished boundary of P(a, r+δ), since fj −f ∈ H(Ω). But
since fj → f uniformly on Γ, it follows that for any ε > 0 there is a j0 such
that |fj − f|Γ < ε for all j > j0. Take K to be a compact subset of P(a, r).

from this it follows that ∂fj

uniformly in P(a, r). Since this can be
proved for any a ∈ Ω,
∂fj
∂zν
converges uniformly in Ω.
What is true of the first derivatives is of course also true for higher deriva￾tives.
We will need the following theorem which is an n-dimensional version
of Hurwitz’s theorem. Observe that its proof uses nothing other than the
maximum modulus theorem.
Theorem 2.0.14 (Hurwitz). Let Ω be a domain in C
n and {fj} a sequence of
nonvanishing holomorphic unctions fj which converges uniformly on compact
subsets to a holomorphic function f on Ω. Then f vanishes either everywhere
or nowhere.
Proof. (The proof comes from Fuks’s book [80, Lemma 1, p. 274)].) Let n = 1.
If the limit function is constant, our assertion is evident. If f(z) 6≡ const,
then one can find for any point z0 ∈ Ω a circle γr = {

z − z
0

 = r} on
which f(z) = 0 6 . Then there exists a number ε > 0 such that |f(ζ)| > ε and
|fj (ζ)| > ε/2 when ζ ∈ γr and j > j0. Here j0 is some natural number chosen
appropriately. Since fj (z) 6= 0 for z ∈ Ω, the maximum modulus theorem
implies that for all z such that

z − z
0

 ≤ r we have |fj (z)| > ε/2. Hence it
follows that f(z
0
) 6= 0.12 A Glimpse of Normal Families
Let n > 1, z
0 ∈ Ω be an arbitrary point and the function f(z) 6≡ const in
the domain Ω ⊂ C
n. Then one can choose a complex line lz
0 (t) = {z ∈ C
n :
z = z
0 + ta} through z
0
, where |a| = 1 and t ∈ C, in such a way that the
function φ(t) = f(lz
0 (t)) is not constant in a neighborhood of the point t = 0.
Set φj (t) = fj (z
0 + at); then in some neighborhood of 0 all of the functions
φj (t) = 0 6 and limj→∞ φj (t) = φ(t) is reached uniformly. Hence, as we have
just seen, it follows that φ(0) = f(z
0
) 6= 0. The lemma is proved.
For other proofs of these theorems, we refer the reader to [218, Proposition
5 (Weierstrass theorem), p. 7, and Corollary (Hurwitz’s theorem), p. 80].3
Normal Families in C
n
Preamble: This chapter starts with the elegant definition of normal family
in C
n from the Cima and Krantz article [47] and an extension of Marty’s
criterion of normality to holomorphic functions of several complex variables.
As an immediate consequence from Marty’s theorem we obtain an exten￾sion of the famous Zalcman rescaling lemma to the several complex variables
context.
Using Marty’s criterion and Zalcman’s lemma we obtain an extension of
Montel’s theorem.
After that we give the proof of the Riemann mapping theorem, which is one
of the more famous results in the whole subject of mathematics. Together with
its generalization to Riemann surfaces, the so-called uniformization theorem,
it is without doubt a cornerstone of function theory.
As Royden [252] pointed out, although Marty’s result is necessary and
sufficient for the relative compactness of a family of holomorphic or meromor￾phic functions, it may not be easy to apply in certain instances. Zalcman’s
rescalling lemma can be used to prove the strengthening of the sufficiency
part of Marty’s normality criterion (Theorem 3.2.3 below). If n = 1 this The￾orem coincides with Schwick’s theorem [264], which is the generalization of a
normality criterion of Royden [252].
By Marty’s normality criterion, the normality of a family F of holomorphic
functions on a domain Ω ⊂ C
n is equivalent to the local boundedness of the
corresponding family F

(this notation is defined
below). It is rather surprising that there is a normality criterion based on a
lower bound of the family F
]
. We prove the extension of Grahl and Nevo’s
normality criterion [86] to a family of holomorphic functions of several complex
variables.
For the sequences of holomorphic functions of one complex variables, ex￾amples due to A.F. Beardon and D. Minda [21], and K.R. Davidson [51] show
that pointwise convergent sequences can have bad properties. We provide some
of these results.
Zalcman’s normality criterion and the one-dimensional Nevanlinna the￾orem are used to prove these results, which generalizes those obtained by
Lappan [161].

We obtain an extension of Mandelbrojt’s [184] boundedness criterion for
a family F of zero-free holomorphic functions on a bounded domain in C
n to
be normal.
The extension of the Zalcman-Pang lemma is also given.
3.1 Definitions and Preliminaries
In this chapter, we recall the basic properties of holomorphic functions
of several complex variables using for references (mainly) the book by
Narasimhan [218], Ohsawa [227], the book by Greene and Krantz [95].
For the most part, we assume only the background provided by an elemen￾tary graduate courses in real and complex analysis.
Let Ω be a domain in C. By a domain Ω, we shall always mean an open
connected subset of C. Denote by O(Ω) the set of all holomorphic functions
in Ω.
We assume that the reader is familiar with the basic properties of holo￾morphic functions of a single variable as presented in standard texts (e.g. [95])
in the subject: A holomorphic function on Ω has a convergent power series
expansion in a neighborhood of each point of Ω; a differentiable function is
holomorphic if and only if it satisfies the Cauchy-Riemann equations; the space
O(Ω) is an algebra over the complex field under the operations of pointwise
addition, multiplication, and scalar multiplication; if a sequence {fj} in O(Ω)
converges uniformly on each compact subset of Ω, then the limit function is
also holomorphic on Ω; holomorphic functions satisfy the Cauchy integral the￾orem and formula, the identity theorem, and the maximum modulus theorem.
A function on an open set Ω in C
n is holomorphic if it is holomorphic
in each variable separately (that this is equivalent to the existence of local
multi-variable power series expansions of the function see, for example [227]).
Some of the properties of holomorphic functions, like the power series ex￾pansion, do extend from one variable to several variables. They differ, however,
in many important aspects. It is therefore not correct to consider the theory
of several complex variables as a straightforward generalization of that of one
complex variable. For example, in one variable the zero set of a holomorphic
function is a discrete set. The zero set of a holomorphic function in C
n, n ≥ 2,
has a real 2n − 2 dimension. In C, it is trivial to construct a holomorphic
function in a domain Ω which is singular at one boundary point p ∈ ∂Ω. In
contrast, in C
n when n ≥ 2, it is not always possible to construct a holomor￾phic function on a given domain Ω ⊂ C
n which is singular at one boundary
point. This leads to the existence of a domain in several variables such that
any holomorphic function defined on this domain can be extended holomor￾phically to a fixed larger set, a feature that does not exist in one variable.
We first fix our terminology.Definitions and Preliminaries 15
The standard inner product on C
n is given by
hz, wi =
Xn
µ=1
zµwµ, (3.1)
where z = (z1, . . . , zn) and w = (w1, . . . , wn), with zµ, wµ ∈ C. This space is
complete, and therefore it is a finite-dimensional Hilbert space.
|z| := p
hz, zi (z ∈ C
n
)
denotes the associated norm.
Let z ∈ Cbn and let v ∈ C
n be thought of as a tangent vector to Cbn at z.
Then the infinitesimal form of the Euclidean metric at z is defined by
de(z, v) = |v|.
The Euclidean length of a curve γ : [a, b] → C is given by the integral
l(γ) := Z

The Euclidean distance between two points z and z
0
is defined to be the
infimum of the Euclidean lengths of smooth paths joining the two points:
e(z, z0
) = inf l(γ),
where the infimum is taken over smooth connecting paths γ. Taking the infi￾mum over paths and keeping in mind that the shortest path between the two
points in the Euclidean sense is the line segment joining them, we obtain the
equality
e(z, z0
) = |z − z
0
|.
Theorem 3.1.1 (Cauchy-Schwarz). If z, w ∈ C
n, then
|hz, wi| ≤ |z| |w| ,
with equality holding if and only if z and w are linearly dependent.
Proof. One proof of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality consists of the verification
of one line, namely:
|z|

It might perhaps be more elegant to multiply through by |z|
2
, so that the
result should hold for z = 0 also, but the identity seems to be more appealing
in the form given. This one line proves also that if the inequality degenerates
to an equality, then w and z are linearly dependent. The converse is trivial:
if w and z are linearly dependent, then one of them is a scalar multiple of
the other, say w = αz, and then both |hz, wi|2
and hz, zi · hw, wi are equal to
|α|

n
By B = Bn we denote the unit ball in C
n. Thus B consists of all z ∈ C
n
such that |z| < 1. To emphasize the special role played by the case n = 1, the
open unit disk in C will be denoted by D in place of B1.
We designate by C(Ω) (respectively, O(Ω)) the family of functions contin￾uous (respectively, holomorphic) in Ω. It is clear that O(Ω) ⊂ C(Ω) and C(Ω)
is an algebra over C with respect to pointwise addition and multiplication,
and that C(Ω) is closed relative to uniform convergence on compact subsets
of C
n.
Given a domain Ω ⊂ C
n, we let Tz(Ω) denote the vector space of all
tangent vectors at z of complex differentiable curves passing through z. The
space Tz(Ω) is called the tangent space to Ω at z and T(Ω) := S
z∈Ω
Tz(Ω)
is called the tangent bundle of Ω. If Ω ⊂ C
n then Tz(Ω) can be identified in
a canonical way with {z} × C
n. We denote by (z; v) the typical element of
Tz(Ω).
Now let C
2
({z}) denote the functions which are defined and twice contin￾uously differentiable on a neighborhood of the point z in C
n. We often call
C
2
({z}) the space of germs at z. For ϕ ∈ C2
({z}), we define the Levi form of
ϕ at z, Lz(ϕ, v), by
Lz(ϕ, v) := Xn

2ϕ

where (z; v) = (z; (v1, . . . , vn)) ∈ Tz(Ω).
For a holomorphic function f on Ω, set

(z) := sup
|v|=1

It should be noted that the quantity f

(z) is well defined since the Levi
form Lz(log(1 + |f|
2
), v) is nonnegative for all z ∈ Ω.
In particular, for n = 1 the formula (3.2) takes the form

(z) := |f

coincides with the spherical metric on Cb.
The invariance of the Levi form.
The following property of the Levi form can be checked directly:
If F : U → C
n is a holomorphic mapping and ϕ ∈ C
2
in a neighborhood
of the point F(z), then
Lz(ϕ ◦ F, v) = LF (z) (ϕ, F∗v) (v ∈ C
n
),
where F∗ = dF is the differential of the mapping F at z.
The last property shows that the Levi form is invariant relative to biholo￾morphic mappings.Definitions and Preliminaries 17
The Riemann sphere is denoted by Cb. Let Cb := C ∪ {∞}, where ∞ is a
symbol not contained in C. Introduce the following topology on Cb. The open
sets are the usual open sets U ⊂ C together with sets of the form V ∪ {∞},
where V ⊂ C is the complement of a compact set K ⊂ C. With this topology,
Cb is a compact Hausdorff topological space, homeomorphic to the 2-sphere
S
2
. Set
U1 := Cb \ {∞} = C,
U2 := Cb \ {0} = C
∗ ∪ {∞}.
Here and in what follows C
∗ = C \ {0}.
Define maps ϕk : Uk → C, k = 1, 2, as follows. The map ϕ1 is the identity
map and
ϕ2 := (
1/z for z ∈ C
∗
0 for z = ∞.
Clearly these maps are homeomorphisms and thus Cb is a two-dimensional
manifold. Since U1 and U2 are connected and have nonempty intersection, Cb
is also connected.
The complex structure on Cb is now defined by the atlas consisting of
the charts ϕk : Uk → C, k = 1, 2. We must show that the two charts are
holomorphically compatible. But ϕ1(U1 ∩ U2) = ϕ2(U1 ∩ U2) = C
∗ and
ϕ2 ◦ ϕ

is biholomorphic.
Further, let z ∈ Cb and let v ∈ C be thought of as a tangent vector to Cb at
z. Then the infinitesimal form of the spherical metric at z is defined by
ds(z, v) = |v|
1 + |z|
2
.
The spherical length of a curve γ : [a, b] → Cb is given by the integral

which is easily seen to converge in case one (or both) of the end points lies
at infinity. (Here, as is usual in the subject, a curve is defined to be a smooth
function γ : [a, b] → Cb.) Indeed, the change of variable z = w
−1 gives dz =
−w
−2dw, and this substitution does not alter the form of the integral; i.e., it
becomes
Λ(γ) = Z
eγ

2
.
The spherical distance between two points z and z
0
is determined by the
infimum of the spherical lengths of smooth paths joining the two points:
s(z, z0
) = inf Λ(γ),
where, the infimum is taken over smooth connecting paths γ.18 Normal Families in C
n
Then s(w1, w2) is the Euclidean length of the shortest arc of the great
circle on the Riemann sphere joining w1 and w1 and defines a metric on the
sphere known as the spherical metric.
The spherical metric is equivalent to the Euclidean metric in the finite part
of C (but of course, they are not equal). The argument goes like this: Let z
and z
0 be two points both lying in a disk E of radius r about the origin, and
let γ be a path in E connecting the two; then the next two inequalities hold:
l(γ)
1 + r
2
<
Z
γ
2|dz|
1 + |z|
2
< l(γ),
where l(γ) denotes the Euclidean length of the path γ. Taking infimum over
paths and keeping in mind that the shortest path between the two points in
the Euclidean sense is the line segment joining them, we obtain the inequalities
|z − z
0
|
1 + r
2
< ρ (z, z0
) < |z − z

| .
By this we have established that the two metrics are equivalent in the finite
part of the extended plane, but as the form of the integral giving the spherical
metric is insensitive to the change of variables w = z
−1
, the argument is even
valid in neighborhoods about the point at infinity. Hence the two metrics are
topologically equivalent.
If now w = f(z) is a holomorphic function, then the spherical length of
the image curve f ◦ γ is given by

Pseudometric spaces were introduced by Ðurađ Kurepa [149] in 1934.
Definition 3.1.2. A pseudometric space (X, d) is a set X together with a
nonnegative real-valued function d : X × X −→ R≥0, called a pseudometric,
such that for every x, y, z ∈ X,
1. d(x, x) = 0.
2. Symmetry: d(x, y) = d(y, x)
3. Subadditivity/Triangle inequality: d(x, z) ≤ d(x, y) + d(y, z).
Notice that a pseudometric space differs from a metric space in that, for
the former, d(x, y) = 0 does not imply that x = y.
Definition 3.1.3. Let (X, ρ) and (Y, σ) be pseudometric spaces, let f ∈
C(X, Y ) and let c > 0. We will say that f is Lipschitz of order c with respect
to metric ρ and σ if ρ(f(a), f(b)) ≤ cσ(a, b) for all a, b ∈ X and that a family
F ⊂ C(X, Y ) is ρ-to-σ Lipshitz of order c with respect to ρ and σ if each
f ⊂ F is Lipschitz of order c.Definitions and Preliminaries 19
For our purposes it will often be the existence of c rather than its size that
is important, in which case, we will shorten this terminology and say simply
that F is Lipshitz.
If F ⊂ C(X, Y ) is Lipschitz of order 1 with respect to ρ and σ, we will say
that F is distance decreasing with respect to ρ and σ.
Let X, Y be topological spaces. A family F ⊂ C(X, Y ) is said to be evenly
continuous from p ∈ X to q ∈ Y if for each U open in Y about q, there exist
V, W open in X, Y about p, q respectively such that
{f ∈ F : f(p) ∈ W} ⊂ {f ∈ F : f(V ) ⊂ U}.
If F is evenly continuous from each p ∈ X to each q ∈ Y , we say that
F is evenly continuous (from X to Y ). We have the following Kelley-Morse
topological version of the Ascoli-Arzelà theorem [126].
Theorem 3.1.4. Let X be a regular locally compact space and let Y be a
regular space. Then F ⊂ C(X, Y ) is relatively compact in C(X, Y ) iff
(a) F is evenly continuous, and
(b) F(x) = {f(x) : f ∈ F} is relatively compact in Y for each x ∈ X.
Let (X, ρ) and (Y, σ) be pseudometric spaces, let f ∈ C(X, Y ), and let
c > 0.
If Y is a topological space, Y ∞ will represent the one-point compactifica￾tion of Y if Y is not compact, Y ∞ = Y if Y is compact.
The following theorem establishes an important property of distance de￾creasing families.
Theorem 3.1.5. Let (Y, σ) be a locally compact metric space. Let X be a
topological space and let ρ be a pseudometric on X which is continuous on
X ×X. If F ⊂ C(X, Y ) is Lipschitz with respect to ρ and σ then F is relatively
compact in C (X, Y ∞).
Proof. Suppose F is Lipschitz of order c. We show that F is evenly continuous
from X to Y ∞. If not, there exist p ∈ X, q, s ∈ Y ∞ and nets {pα} , {fα} in
X, F respectively such that pα → p, s 6= q, fα (pα) → s, fα(p) → q. If q ∈ Y ,
then for each α we have
σ (fα (pα), q) ≤ σ (fα (pα), fα(p)) + σ (fα(p), q) ≤ cρ (pα, p) + σ (fα(p), q) .
So σ (fα (pα), q) → 0 and q = s, a contradiction. If s ∈ Y , then for each α we
have
σ (fα(p), s) ≤ cρ (p, pα) + σ (fα (pα), s)
Hence σ (fα(p), s) → 0 and s = q, a contradiction. The theorem is proved.20 Normal Families in C

3.2 Marty’s Normality Criterion
L. Ahlfors said in [4, p. 225]:
If a sequence tends to ∞, there is no great scattering of values, and it may
well be argued that for the purposes of normal families such a sequence
should be regarded as convergent. This is the classical point of view, and
we shall restyle our definition to conform with traditional usage.
So the right way to give the definition of normal families is the following.
Definition 3.2.1. A family F of meromorphic functions from a domain Ω ⊂
C
n to the Riemann sphere Cb is normal in Ω if every sequence of functions
{fj} ⊆ F contains a subsequence which converges uniformly on each compact
subset of Ω.
This elegant definition of normal family is from the Cima and Krantz 1983
article [47, Definition 1.2, p. 306]. We think not of holomorphic functions but
of meromorphic functions. Given that, one thinks of the functions as taking
values in the Riemann sphere. If we do it that way, then we don’t have to talk
about compact divergence anymore. We can still say that a family is normal
if there is a subsequence that converges uniformly on compact sets. Since the
range is now the Riemann sphere, convergence to ∞ is a possibility.
For more information on this subject, see the book of Krantz [142, Chapter
2, Section 2.3, p.79].
A sequence which converges uniformly on compact subsets of a region Ω
is sometimes said to converge normally on Ω or converge locally uniformly on
Ω.
Definition 3.2.2. A family F is said to be normal at a point p ∈ Ω if it is
normal in some neighborhood of p.
[Throughout this book, the term “neighborhood of p” refers to an open
set that contains the point p.] In these circumstances, the convergence is then
uniform on each compact subset of Ω.
It is routine to confirm that a family of holomorphic functions F is normal
in a domain Ω if and only if F is normal at each point of Ω.
In terms of the spherical metric an extremily useful normality criterion for
a family of meromorphic functions of one complex variable was given in 1931
by Frèdèric Ladislas Joseph Marty in his dissertation [187]. See Hayman [111,
pp. 158–160], for references and a statement and for another proof of the
result and Royden [252], Schiff [260] for an extension. The important paper of
Carathéodory [38] should also be mentioned in this context. Marty’s normality
criterion implies many fundamental theorems in the one-dimensional theory.
We shall prove Marty’s normality criterion for a family of holomorphic
functions of several complex variables in terms of the spherical derivative.Marty’s Normality Criterion 21
Theorem 3.2.3 (Marty, see [68, Theorem 2.1]). A family F of functions
holomorphic on Ω is normal on Ω ⊂ C
n if and only if for each compact subset
K ⊂ Ω there exists a constant M(K) such that at each point z ∈ K
f
]
(z) ≤ M(K) (3.1)
for all f ∈ F.
Proof. Of course it is enough to show that F is normal at every point z0 ∈ Ω.
We appeal to the theorem of Arzelà-Ascoli (Theorem 2.0.9). As the Riemann
sphere Cb is compact, the second condition of Arzelà and Ascoli is automatically
fulfilled, and our task reduces to checking that a family is equicontinuous on
compacts in Ω when it is spherically bounded on such compacta.
Let us show that (3.1) implies that the family F is equicontinuous. Fix an
arbitrary z0 ∈ Ω and choose r > 0 such that
K = {z ∈ C
n
: |z − z0| ≤ r} ⊂ Ω.
Let z(t) = z0 + t(z1 − z0) ⊂ K, for all t ∈ [0, 1]. It is elementary to see that
Lz(t)(log(1 + |f|
2
), v) = |Df(z)v|
2
(1 + |f(z)|
2)
2
≥ 0, (3.2)
where
Df(z)v := Xn
k=1
∂f

(z)vk.
Hence
|df(z(t))/dt|
2
(1 + |f(z(t))|
2)
2
= Lz(t)(log(1 + |f|
2
), z0
(t)) ≤ (f
]
(z(t))|z

(t)|)
2
.
Then the spherical distance satisfies
s(f(z0), f(z1)) ≤

(z(t))|z
0
(t)|dt ≤ M(K)
Z 1

|z
0
(t)|dt ≤ M(K)|z1 − z0|
for all f ∈ F. Thus we see that the family F is equicontinuous on K—
from the Euclidean metric to the spherical metric. The Ascoli-Arzelà theorem
(Theorem 2.0.9) now implies that F is normal at z0.
Conversely, assume that F is normal in Ω. If (3.1) fails for some compact
set K ⊂ Ω, then there exists a sequence {fj} ⊂ F which converges locally
uniformly in Ω to some f 6≡ ∞ and such that the maximum of f
]
j
over K
tends to ∞. By Weierstrass’s theorem (Theorem 2.0.13), ∂fj/∂zk converges
uniformly to ∂f /∂zk on K; therefore, there exists j0 such that for j > j0.
Lz(log(1 + |fj |
2
), v) ≤ Lz(log(1 + |f|
2
), v) + O(|v|
2
) for all z ∈ K, v ∈ C
n
.
It follows that
f
]
j
(z) ≤ f
]
(z) + O(1) for all j > j0.22 Normal Families in C
n
This is a contradiction, since the right-hand side is bounded on K.
If f ≡ ∞, then consider a domain Ω
0
containing K and satisfying Ω0 ⊂ Ω.
Then there exists j0 such that the functions 1/fj are holomorphic in Ω
0
for
j > j0. Since 1/fj → 0 uniformly in Ω
0
, we see as above that (1/(fj )
]
) are
bounded on K. Since the Levi form vanishes for any pluriharmonic function,
Lz(log(1 + |1/fj |
2
), v) =
Lz(log(1 + |f|
2
), v) − 2Lz(log |f|, v) =
Lz(log(1 + |f|
2
), v). (3.3)
Therefore
f
]
j
(z) = (1/fj )

(z)
and we again obtain a contradiction.
Remark 3.2.4. The proof of Marty’s theorem shows that if holomorphic func￾tions fj converge uniformly to f in the spherical metric, then f
]
j
converges
to f
]
. The converse fails: consider a sequence of constants, or a sequence of
rotations of a single function.
Specifically, Theorem 3.2.3 can be rephrased in this way:
Theorem 3.2.5 (see [62, Lemma (Marty’s criterion)]). A family F of func￾tions holomorphic on Ω is normal on Ω ⊂ C
n if and only if for each compact
subset K ⊂ Ω, there exists a constant M(K) such that at each point z ∈ K
and all vectors v ∈ C
n
Lz(log(1 + |f|
2
), v) ≤ M(K)|v|
2
(3.4)
for all f ∈ F.
Remark 3.2.6. The inequality (3.4) is equivalent to the assertion that for each
compact set K ⊂ Ω, there exists a positive number M(K) such that for all
z ∈ K and all f ∈ F,
Lz(log(1 + |f|
2
), v)/|v|
2 ≤ M(K)
for all v ∈ C
n \ {0}. When Ω is bounded domain in C
n, this is equivalent to
the existence of a positive constant M0
(K) such that
Lz(log(1 + |f|
2
), v)/F K
Ω (z, v) ≤ M0
(K)
for all z ∈ K and all f ∈ F because the Kobayashi and Euclidean metrics are
bi-Lipschitz equivalent on compact subsets of Ω.
Remark 3.2.7. Condition (3.4) means that at each point z ∈ K the Hermitian
form
M(K)|v|
2 − Lz(log(1 + |f|
2
), v)
is positive semi-definite.Marty’s Normality Criterion 23
Remark 3.2.8. Condition (3.4) implies that
s(f(z), f(w)) ≤ M(K)|z − w| for all f ∈ F and all z, w ∈ K.
The Marty criterion for a family F implies that the family F is s-to-e
Lipschitz on compact subsets of Ω.
Loosely speaking, with the correct metrics, normality for families of holo￾morphic functions is equivalent to the existence of a uniform Lipschitz condi￾tion on compact subsets of the region.
As an immediate application, we have the following result.
Corollary 3.2.9. Let {fj} be a sequence of holomorphic functions on B(0, 1)
which converges uniformly on B(0, r), r < 1, to a function f, and let {zj} be
a sequence converging to 0. Then the sequence
gj (z) := f(z + zj )
also converges uniformly to f on B(0, r1), r1 < r.
Proof. The hypothesis that fj → f converges uniformly on B(0, r), r < 1,
implies the normality of the sequence {fj} on B(0, 1). Therefore there exists
M > 0 such that f
]
(z) < M for z ∈ B(0,(r + r1)/2). Hence
s(fj (z + zj ), f(z)) <
s(fj (z + zj ), fj (z)) + s(fj (z), f(z)) <
M|zj | + s(fj (z), f(z)).
This shows that f(z + zj ) → f(z) uniformly on B(0, r1).
Remark 3.2.10. Theorem 3.4 is similar to the one obtained by Timoney [276,
Theorem 3.1, p. 252], but the article of the latter was submitted for consid￾eration on October 17, 1979, while the article [62] was submitted on July 18,
1979.
Theorem 3.2.5 has been the impetus for a large number of investiga￾tions. Several authors, including Cima and Krantz [47], Hahn [105], Josep
and Kwack [124] and Funahashi [81], to name only a few, proved Marty’s
criterion for holomorphic mappings and extended to higher dimensions some
classical theorems.
Marty’s normality criterion should not be taken lightly, for it has many
important applications. Using Theorem 3.2.5 in Chapter 4, we will find a way
to extend the definition of normal holomorphic function in the unit disk to
arbitrary domains in C

3.3 Zalcman’s Rescaling Lemma
Marty’s normality criterion has a host of applications. Here we generalize Zal￾cman’s rescalling lemma ([291, Lemma, p. 814]) to the theory of holomorphic
functions in C
n. The provided proof is fairly short and elementary; it uses only
Marty’s normality criterion (Theorem 3.2.3). The proof of Zalcman’s rescaling
lemma in C
n roughly follows the proof given in ([272, Theorem 4.1, p. 113])
for the one-dimensional case. Professor R. Steinmetz informed me, via email,
that the proof in his book does not belong to him but is essentially the proof
he learned from Professor L. Zalcman.
By an entire function we shall mean an element of O(C
n).
Theorem 3.3.1 (see [68, Theorem 3.1]). A family F of functions holomorphic
on Ω ⊂ C
n is not normal at some point z0 ∈ Ω if and only if there exist
sequences fj ∈ F, zj → z0, ρj = 1/f]
j
(zj ) → 0, such that the sequence
gj (z) := fj (zj + ρj z)
converges locally uniformly in C
n to a nonconstant entire function g satisfying
g
]
(z) ≤ g
]
(0) = 1.
It is remarkable that non-normality can be described in terms of a conver￾gent sequence. If {fj} were convergent, then the functions gj would converge
to a constant on compact subsets of C
n, since the radii ρj tend to 0. Zalcman’s
lemma (Theorem 3.3.1) says that arbitrarily small balls centered at zj can be
found where fj is close to a non-trivial entire (holomorphic in C
n) function,
after rescaling.
Proof of Theorem 3.3.1. The proof will be based on Marty’s normality cri￾terion (Theorem 3.2.3). Assume F is not normal at a point z0 ∈ Ω. To
simplify matters we assume that z0 = 0 and all functions under consider￾ation are holomorphic on the unit ball {z ∈ C
n : |z| < 1}. By Marty’s nor￾mality criterion (Theorem 3.2.3), F contains functions fj , j ∈ N, satisfying

Remark 3.3.2. In [6] Aladro and Krantz gave a theorem of a normality criterion
for families of holomorphic mappings {fj} from a domain Ω of C
n into a
complete Hermitian complex space M. Unfortunately, they failed to deal with
the compactly divergent case of the obtained mapping gj (ξ) = fj (pj + ρj ξ)
(ρj & 0). Do Duc Thai, Pham Nguyen Thu Trang, and P. D. Huong [275] fixes
the statement of the theorem and completes the proof. They give a correct
generalization of Zalcman’s lemma to complex spaces ([275, Theorem 2.5 and
Corollaries 2.8, 2.13, and Proposition 2.11]).
Zalcman in his 1993 article “Normal families revisited”, Complex Analysis
and Related Topics (J. J. O. O. ’ Wiegerinck, ed. ), Univ. ’ of Amsterdam,
Amsterdam, 1993, pp. 149–164., on page 156, made the following comment
about the use of Marty’s theorem: “The proof of the lemma is one of the few
really effective uses of Marty’s theorem of which I am aware. It is of such
a general character that it is rather easily adapted to other situations. Ap￾propriate versions thus hold for families of quasiregular or quasimeromorphic
functions in space [191] and certain holomorphic mappings in C
n [6], leading
to versions of Theorem 1 for these classes. One almost immediate consequence
of the (proof of the) Lemma is Brody’s theorem. A compact complex manifold
is hyperbolic if and only if it contains no complex lines”.
Zalcman’s lemma is of such a general character that it is rather easily
adapted to other situations (see for example [191, Theorem 1, p. 35] and [279]).
Higher-dimensional analogue of Zalcman’s lemma have also proven to be quite
useful [15, 186].
3.4 Pointwise Limits of Holomorphic Functions
While most elementary texts on real analysis contain an example to show that
a pointwise limit of differentiable functions need not be differentiable, hardly
any texts on complex analysis contain an example to show that the pointwise
limit of analytic functions need not be analytic.
Beardon and Minda [51] provide a simple example to show that the point￾wise limit of a sequence of analytic functions need not be analytic.
From a modern viewpoint, it is easy to see from Montel’s theory of normal
families why an example of a nonanalytic pointwise limit of analytic functions
requires a little work. Montel proved that the family of functions f that are
analytic in a region Ω, and that map Ω into the complement of three given
points w1, w2, and w3 in the extended plane, is normal in Ω. It follows from
this that if a sequence fn of analytic functions is pointwise convergent in Ω,
and if each fn fails to take any of the values wj there, then the convergence is
locally uniform, and the limit is analytic. Thus, in any example fn of the type
we are seeking, fn(Ω) must cover all but two points of the complex sphere.
However, Beardon and Minda [51] take a different route, and they did not
use Montel’s theorem at all in that paper.Pointwise Limits of Holomorphic Functions 27
The example of a nonanalytic limit given in the article of Beardon and
Minda [51] needs only Cauchy’s integral formula; it is a slight modification
of Exercise 11 in [259, p. 321], and a more detailed discussion (though not
on this aspect) can be found in [71, 5, pp. 160–162], where it is shown to be
closely related to the so-called Mittag-Leffler function.
Example 3.4.1. We shall construct an entire function E that has a radial
limit 0 at ∞ in each direction except along the positive real axis R
+, where
Re[E(x)] → +∞ as x → +∞. Given this, we let F(z) = exp(−E(z)), so that
F is an entire function with radial limit 1 at ∞ in all directions except along
R
+, where it has radial limit 0. It follows that the sequence of entire functions
Fn defined by Fn(z) = F(nz) converges pointwise on C to a function that is
1 on the complement of [0, +∞) and 0 on (0, +∞).
For each positive a, let γa be the boundary curve of the half-strip Ha given
in R
2 by (a, +∞) × (−π, π), and let Ea be the exterior of Ha. Notice that if
a < b then Ea ⊂ Eb, and that Ha ∩ Eb is the open rectangle (a, b) × (−π, π).
Now let f(z) = exp(exp(z)). As |f(x±iπ)| = 1/ exp(exp x), |f| is integrable
on γa with integral kfk1,a with respect to |dz|, say, and this ensures that the
function
Ia(z) = 1
2πi Z
γa
f(w)
w − z
dw
exists and is analytic in the complement of γa. Obviously
|Ia(z)| ≤ kfk1,a
2π dist (z, γa)
,
and this shows (i) that Ia has radial limit 0 at ∞ in all directions except
along R
+, and (ii) that Ia is bounded on the real segment [a+ 1, +∞). In fact,
Ia(x) → 0 as x → +∞, but we do not need this.
Next, suppose that 0 < a < b and that z /∈ γa ∪ γb. Then
Ib(z) − Ia(z) = 1
2πi Z
∂(Ha∩Eb)
f(w)
w − z
= f(z)χa,b(z),
where χa,b is the characteristic function of the rectangle Ha ∩ Eb. This shows
that Ib(z) = Ia(z) on Ea, and as ∪aEa = C; this means that we can define
an entire function E by E(z) = Ia(z) on Ea, for each a. In particular, E has
radial limit 0 at ∞ in every direction except possibly along R
+. If x ∈ Ha∩R
+
then we choose any b with b > x; then x ∈ Eb and
E(x) = Ib(x) = Ia(x) + f(x) = O(1) + exp(exp x)
as x → +∞ so that Re[E(x)] → +∞ as x → +∞. This completes the example.
We remark that (as stated in [71, 5, p. 327]) the function F in this example
also provides an interesting example relating to Liouville’s theorem, for the
function [1 − F(z)][1 − F(−z)] has radial limit zero in all directions, but it is
not identically zero.
There are also some positive results.28 Normal Families in C
n
Proposition 3.4.2. Let F be a pointwise bounded family of holomorphic func￾tions on Ω ⊂ C
n. There is a (maximal) dense open set Ω0 ⊂ Ω such that F
restricted to Ω0 is locally bounded.
Proof. For each z in Ω, let φ(z) denote the least upper bound for
{|f(z)| : f ∈ F} .
Because each f in F continuous, it is easy to see that Kj = {z : φ(z) ≤ j} is
(relatively) closed in Ω. Since φ(z) is finite for each z, Ω is the union of the
Kj . The Baire category theorem shows that, for every ball B in Ω, Kj ∩ B
has interior for large j. Thus, the union Ω0 of the interiors int Kj is a dense
open subset of Ω. Obviously F bounded on each int Kj , and hence F is locally
bounded on a dense set Ω0. Conversely, if F bounded by j on an open set Ω,
then B is contained in int Kj and thus is in Ω0.
Corollary 3.4.3 (Osgood). Suppose that f1, f2, . . . are holomorphic in a do￾main Ω ⊂ C
n, and that fj → f pointwise in Ω. Then there is a dense open
subset Ω0 of Ω on which the convergence is locally uniform, and in which f is
holomorphic.
Proof. A sequence of functions converging pointwise is pointwise bounded. By
Proposition 3.4.2, {fj} is locally bounded on Ω0. By Montel’s Theorem 2.0.12,
a subsequence converges uniformly on compact subsets to f on Ω0, and hence
f is holomorphic on Ω0.
The set where f is holomorphic does not necessarily coincide with the set
on which convergence is locally uniform (see [51, Example 1, 2]). No proof is
included, for all existing proofs rely on mathematical machinery that we do
not wish to introduce in the present text.
Proposition 3.4.4. If {fj} is a sequence of bounded holomorphic functions
on Ω ⊂ C
n converging pointwise to f, then f is holomorphic and the conver￾gence is uniform on compact subsets.
Proof. The family F = {fj} is bounded and thus locally bounded. By Mon￾tel’s Theorem 2.0.12, every subsequence of {fj} has a sub-subsequence which
converges uniformly on compact subsets. This limit is f perforce, so f is holo￾morphic. If the whole sequence does not converge to f uniformly on compact
subsets, there would be a compact set K in Ω, an ε > 0, a subsequence {fjk
},
and points zj in K such that
|fjk
(zk) − f(zk)| ≥ ε
for k ≥ 1. Thus no subsequence of {fjk
} could converge uniformly to f on K,
which is a contradiction.
Theorem 3.4.5 is an extension of Proposition 3.4.4.Montel’s Normality Criteria 29
Theorem 3.4.5. If {fj} is a sequence of holomorphic functions on Ω ⊂ C
n
whose ranges omit 0 and 1 there, and converging pointwise to f, then f is
holomorphic and the convergence is uniform on compact subset.
Proof. Because the family F manifestly omits two values in Ω, Montel’s theo￾rem in C
n empowers us to extract from the sequence {fj} ⊆ F a subsequence
{fjk
} ⊆ F that converges normally in Ω to a function f. This gives the
conclusion by repeating verbatim the argument at the end of the proof of
Proposition 3.4.4.
As an illustration of the direct use of normality rather than equicontinu￾ity, we consider Vitali’s theorem: this exploits analytic continuation and so
enables us derive information about the limit f of a sequence {fj} throughout
a domain Ω simply from a knowledge of f on only a small part of Ω.
Theorem 3.4.6 (Vitali’s Theorem). Suppose that the family F = {fj} of
holomorphic functions is normal in a domain Ω, and that fj converges point￾wise to some function f on some nonempty open subset W of Ω. Then f
extends to a function F which is holomorphic on Ω, and fj → f locally uni￾formly on Ω.
Proof. As F is normal in Ω, there is some subsequence of {fj} which con￾verges locally uniformly in Ω to some function F. By Theorem 2.0.12 F is
holomorphic in Ω, and F = f on W.
Now suppose that if {fj} fails to converge locally uniformly on Ω to F.
Then there is a compact subset K of Ω, a positive ε, and a subsequence, say
{gj}, of {fj} such that for all j,
sup
K
s(gj (z), F(z)) ≥ ε.
However, by normality, there is some subsequence, say {hj}, of {gj} which
converges locally uniformly to some function h on Ω. Clearly, h = f = F
on W, and as h is holomorphic in Ω, we must have h = F throughout Ω. It
follows that
sup
K
s(hj (z), F(z)) → 0.
and as {hj} is a subsequence of {gj}, this violates the preceding inequality
(which holds for all j). The proof is complete.
3.5 Montel’s Normality Criteria
Marty’s normality criterion provides less than complete information, prin￾cipally because condition (3.1) is generally very difficult to verify in those30 Normal Families in C
n
situations in which it is not already evident that the family F is normal. Ac￾cordingly, there has been a continuing search for other conditions which imply
normality. One of the earliest such results in the classical theory of normal
families of one complex variable, and certainly the most important, was found
by Montel himself [200].
The first, and simpler, version of the Montel theorem states that a family
of holomorphic functions defined on an open subset of the complex plane C is
normal if and only if it is locally uniformly bounded.
The first version of Montel’s theorem is a direct consequence of Marty’s
theorem and the Cauchy integral formula.
For the formulation of the second (strongest) version of Montel’s theorem,
we need the following definition.
Definition 3.5.1. A complex quantity a ∈ C is an omit value of a family F
of holomorphic functions defined on a domain Ω if
a /∈
[
f∈F
f[Ω].
The stronger version of Montel’s theorem (occasionally referred to as the
fundamental normality test) states that a family of holomorphic functions, all
of which omit the same two values a, b ∈ C is normal.
The second version of Montel’s theorem can be deduced from the first by
using the fact that there exists a holomorphic universal covering from the unit
disk to the twice punctured plane C \ {a, b}. (Such a covering is given by the
elliptic modular function.)
We will prove the extension of Montel’s normality criterion to the context
of several complex variables.
Theorem 3.5.2 (Montel, see [66, Theorem 2.1]). Let F be a family of holo￾morphic functions on an open set Ω ⊆ C
n that omit two fixed complex values.
Then each sequence of functions in F has a subsequence which converges uni￾formly on compact subsets.
We shall give two proofs of Montel’s normality criterion in C
n based on
Zalcman’s rescalling lemma (Theorem 3.3.1).
First proof of Montel’s normality criterion 3.5.2. : Composing the functions
of F with a linear fractional transformation, we may assume that the omit￾ted values are 0 and 1. Suppose F is not normal on Ω. Then, by Zalcman
Lemma (Theorem 3.3.1), there exist fj ∈ F, zj ∈ Ω and ρj → 0+ such that
fj (zj +ρj ζ) = gj (ζ) → g(ζ) uniformly on compact subsets of C
n, where g is a
nonconstant entire function. By Hurwitz’s theorem (Theorem 2.0.14), g does
not take on the values 0 and 1, since no fj does. Let b ∈ C
n. The function
gb(λ) := g(λ · b),Montel’s Normality Criteria 31
is an entire function on C, satisfying
gb(0) = g(0), gb(1) = g(b)
and
gb(C) ⊂ g(C
n
) ⊆ C \ {0, 1} .
But then, by the one-dimensional version of Picard’s little theorem, gb is
constant, hence g(0) = g(b) for all b ∈ C
n, a contradiction.
We also give a simple proof of the theorem of Montel, based on the idea
of A. Ros [249, Theorem 2, p. 240] (see [291, p. 218]).
Second proof of Montel’s normality criterion 3.5.2. : Since normality is a lo￾cal notion, we may suppose that Ω = B, the unit ball. So let F be as in the
statement of Montel’s normality criterion (Theorem 3.5.2) and suppose that
F is not normal. Composing with a linear fractional transformation, we may
assume that the omitted values are 0 and 1. This implies that if f ∈ F and
m ∈ N, then there exists a function g holomorphic in Ω such that g
2m
= f.
Let Fm be the family of all such functions g. Note that

(z) (z ∈ Ω),
where we have used the basic inequality a
−1 + a ≥ a
−t + a
t valid for a > 0
and 0 < t < 1. By Marty’s normality criterion (Theorem 3.2.3), the family
{f
]
: f ∈ F} is not locally bounded. We deduce that for fixed m ∈ N, the
family {g
]
: g ∈ Fm} is not locally bounded. Using Marty’s normality criterion
(Theorem 3.2.3) again, we find that Fm is not normal, for all m ∈ N. Note
that if g ∈ Fm, then g omits the values e
2πik/2m for k, m ∈ Z. From the
Zalcman rescalling lemma (Theorem 3.3.1), we thus deduce that there exists
an entire function gm omitting the values e
2πik/2m and satisfying gm(z) ≤
g
]
m(0) = 1. The gm thus form a normal family and we have gmj → G for some
subsequence {gmj
} and some nonconstant entire function G. By Hurwitz’s
theorem (Theorem 2.0.14), G omits the values e
2πik/2m for all k, m ∈ N.
Since G(C
n) is open this implies that |G(z)| 6= 1 for all z ∈ C
n. Thus either
|G(z)| < 1 for all z ∈ C
n or |G(z)| > 1 for all z ∈ C
n. In the first case G
is bounded and thus constant by Liouville’s theorem. In the second case 1/G
is bounded. Again 1/G is constant and thus G is constant. Thus we get a
contradiction in both cases.
We shall now show that the following result, in which the values omitted
are allowed to vary with the function, as long as they do not approach one
another too closely, is also true.32 Normal Families in C
n
Theorem 3.5.3 (Montel-Carathéodory’s theorem). Let F be a family of func￾tions holomorphic on Ω ⊂ C
n. Suppose that for some ε > 0, there exist for
each f ∈ F distinct points af , bf ∈ C such that for all z ∈ Ω, f(z) 6= af , bf
and
s(af , ∞)s(af , bf )s(∞, bf ) > ε.
Then F is normal on Ω.
Proof. Otherwise, there exists some ball B in Ω, which we may assume to
be unit ball, on which F fails to be normal. Then, by Zalcman’s Rescall￾ing Lemma 3.3.1, there exist fj ∈ F, zj ∈ B and ρj → 0+ such that
fj (zj + ρj ζ) = gj (ζ) → g(ζ) uniformly on compact subsets of C
n, where g
is a nonconstant entire function. Taking successive subsequences and renum￾bering, we can assume that afj → a and bfj → b, where a and b are distinct
points in C. Since gj (ζ) − afj
6= 0 and g is nonconstant, it follows from the
Hurwitz Theorem (Theorem 2.0.14) that g(ζ) 6= a. Similarly, g(ζ) 6= b. Again,
we may assume that the omitted values are 0 and 1. The reasoning used at
the end of Theorem 3.5.2 now shows that g is a constant, a contradiction.
Montel’s theorem remains valid if the omitted values are replaced by omit￾ted functions, so long as the omitted functions never take on the same value
at points of Ω.
Theorem 3.5.4 (Fatou’s theorem). Let a(z) and b(z) be functions holomor￾phic on Ω ⊂ C
n such that a(z) 6= b(z) for each z ∈ Ω. Let F be a family of
functions holomorphic on Ω such that, for each z ∈ Ω,
f(z) 6= a(z) , f(z) 6= b(z)
for all f ∈ F. Then F is normal on Ω.
Proof. Consider the family of functions
G =
nf(z) − a(z)
f(z) − b(z)
for all f ∈ Fo
.
Then each g ∈ G is holomorphic on Ω; and if g ∈ G, then g(z) 6= 0, 1 for z ∈ Ω.
Thus G is normal on Ω by Montel’s Theorem 3.5.2. But then, as is easily seen,
F is normal on Ω as well.
3.6 Application of Montel’s Theorem
In this section we give an application of the theorem of Montel (Theorem 3.5.2)
and, us the graph of a function, we give another description of the “ConjectureApplication of Montel’s Theorem 33
of Julia”. We also prove that, if U is a domain in the complex plane, then we
get the converse of the theorem of Hurwitz.
Recall that Ω ⊂ C
n is called a domain of normality if (1) there exists a
family F, holomorphic in the domain Ω, which which forms in this domain a
normal family; (2) there is no domain Ωe properly containing Ω possessing the
above property for the F.
In such a case the domain Ω is said to be the domain of normality for the
sequence F.
The domain of holomorphy of a family F is the intersection of the domains
of holomorphy for the functions belonging to the family F (thus, in the family
F, we can certainly find functions which have different functional elements at
different points of the domain Ω with identical coordinates).
Now, if we consider the normality of a family of holomorphic functions in a
domain Ω ⊂ C
n in the strict sense, that is, if every sequence of the family has
a subsequence which converges uniformly to a holomorphic function on every
compact set in Ω, then the domain of normality is a domain of holomorphy.
This is known as the “Conjecture of Julia”: namely, whether the normality
domain is the domain of holomorphy. This question was answered affirmatively
by H. Cartan and P. Thullen (their results can be found in [80, Chapter 1]).
Using the word “graph” of a holomorphic function, this is described in
other words as follows:
Let F be a family of holomorphic functions in a domain Ω in C
n. Suppose
that the set F(p) = {f(p); f ∈ F} is bounded for every point p ∈ Ω. If Ω × C
is a domain of normality of the family ΓF of graphs of F, then Ω is a domain
of holomorphy.
We shall give a proof of the above in what follows. For this purpose the
following definitions are necessary:
Definition 3.6.1. Let {Ej} be a sequence of subsets of a metric space X.
We say that it converges geometrically to a set E ⊂ X (and write Ej → E) if
(a) E coincides with the limit set of the sequence {Ej}, i.e. consists of all
points of the form limjv→∞ xjv, xjv ∈ Ejv
(in particular, E is closed in X);
(b) for any compact set K ⊂ E and any  > 0 there is an index j(, K) such
that K belongs to the -neighborhood of Ej in X for all j > j(, K).
A nonempty analytic set A on a domain Ω is called principal if there is
a function f ∈ O(Ω), not identically vanishing on any component of Ω, such
that A = {z ∈ Ω : f(z) = 0}. An analytic set is called locally principal if it is
principal in a neighborhood of each of its points.
Definition 3.6.2. Let {Aν} be a sequence of principal analytic sets in Ω.
This sequence is said to converge analytically to an analytic set A if and only
if, given a point p ∈ Ω, there exists a neighborhood U of p and holomorphic
functions {fν} , f in U, such that:
(i) f is not identically zero.34 Normal Families in C
n
(ii) Aν ∩ U = {q ∈ U; fν(q) = 0} , A ∩ U = {q ∈ U; f(q) = 0}.
(iii) The sequence {fν} converges uniformly to f.
From this definition, the following remarks are easily seen.
1. If A is not empty, then A is a principal analytic set in Ω.
2. If a sequence {pν} with pν ∈ Aν has accumulation points, then they
belong to A.
3. The sequence {Aν} converges geometrically to A.
Definition 3.6.3. A family F of holomorphic functions in Ω is said to be
bounded if and only if the set F = {f(p), f ∈ F} is bounded in the complex
plane C.
Definition 3.6.4. An analytic set A in Ω × C(w) is said to be fine in w at p
if and only if the set A(p) = 
(p, w) ∈ C
n+1	
∩ A has no finite accumulating
point, where C(w) is a complex plane with coordinate w.
From this definition, as is easily seen, A is not fine in w at p if and only if
A includes the complex plane 
(z, w) ∈ C
n+1; z = p
	
.
For simplicity, in the sequel, we consider the case of two complex variables
z, ζ ∈ C.
Lemma 3.6.5. Let {fj} be a sequence of holomorphic functions in Ω ⊂ C
2
satisfying the following conditions:
(i) {fj} is bounded at each point of Ω.
(ii) The sequence {Γj} := {(p, fj (p)) ∈ Ω × C; p ∈ Ω} of graphs of {fj} con￾verges analytically to an analytic set A in Ω × C(w).
Then {fj} converges uniformly to a holomorphic function on every compact
set in Ω.
Proof. This argument belongs to Professor H. Fujimoto. Let
E = {p ∈ Ω : A is not fine in w at p} .
Then E is a proper analytic set in Ω.
In fact, A is a proper analytic set in Ω × C(w) and E does not coincide
with C. Take a point p ∈ Ω and a polydisk P ⊂ Ω with center at p. Since
P × C is a domain in which we can solve second Cousin problem, there exists
a holomorphic function ϕ(z, ζ, w) in P × C such that
A ∩ (P × C) = {(z, ζ, w) ∈ P × C; ϕ(z, ζ, w) = 0} .
Then it is easily seen that
E ∩ P = {(z, ζ) ∈ P; ϕ(z, ζ, c) = 0 for all complex numbers c}
=
\
c∈C
{(z, ζ) ∈ P; ϕ(z, ζ, c) = 0} .
Thus E is a proper analytic set in Ω.Application of Montel’s Theorem 35
Now, we show that the sequence {fj} is uniformly bounded on every com￾pact set in Ω. To prove this, we have only to show that for any point p ∈ Ω
there exists a neighborhood U of p such that {fj}is uniformly bounded on
U. Let p0 ∈ Ω \ E. Since {fj (p0)} is bounded, there exists a subsequence of
{fj (p0)} which converges to a complex number q0. Since (p0, q0) ∈ A, there
exists a neighborhood U := U1 × U2 of (p0, q0) with U1 ⊂ Ω \ E and holomor￾phic functions {ψj} , ψ on U such that
Γj ∩ U = {(x, y, w) ∈ U; ψj (x, y, w) = 0} ,
A ∩ U = {(x, y, w) ∈ U; ψ(x, y, w) = 0}
and that the sequence {ψj} converges uniformly to ψ on U. Since the point
p0 ∈/ E, ψ (p0, w) is not identically zero. Therefore there exists a small posi￾tive number r such that ψ(p0, w) 6= 0 if |w − q0| = r. Thus if we choose U1
sufficiently small, we have ψ 6= 0 on U1×Θ, where Θ = {w ∈ C; |w − q0| = r}.
Put
m = min 
|ψ(p, w)| ; (p, w) ∈ U1 × Θ
	
.
Since {ψj} converges uniformly to ψ there exists a j0 such that |ψj − ψ| < m/2
on U1 × Θ for all j ≥ j0. Then for any point p ∈ U1, by the theorem of
Hurwitz, the equation ψj (p, w) = 0 has at least one root wj in the disk
{w ∈ C; |w − q0| < r} for all j ≥ j0. Thus {fj} is uniformly bounded on U1.
Let p0 ∈ E. Since E is a proper analytic set, by a linear change of coordinate
if necessary, we can choose a polydisk U = U1 × U2 of p0 such that 
∂U1 ×
∂U2

∩ E = ∅. Then {fj} is uniformly bounded on ∂U1 × ∂U2 and by the
maximal principle {fj} is uniformly bounded on U1 × U2.
Now by the theorem of Montel (Theorem 3.5.2), any sequence {fj} has
a convergent subsequence. To prove that {fj} converges uniformly on every
compact set in Ω, we have only to show that the limit function is independent
of the choice of the convergent sequence. Let n
f
(1)
j
o
and n
f
(2)
j
o
be two se￾quences of {fj} which converge to f
(1) and f
(2) respectively on every compact
set in Ω. Then it is easily seen that
A = graph of f
(1) = graph of f
(2)
,
so that f
(1) = f
(2). This complete the proof of Lemma 3.6.5.
Definition 3.6.6. A family of principal analytic sets in Ω is said to be ana￾lytically normal in Ω if and only if, given a sequence in the family, there exists
a subsequence which converges analytically to an analytic set in Ω.
Definition 3.6.7. Let Γ (resp. F) be a family of principal analytic sets (resp.
holomorphic functions) on D ⊂ C
2
. Then D is called a domain of normality
of Γ (resp. F) if and only if Γ (resp. F) is normal in D and for any schlicht

For a domain of normality of a family of holomorphic functions, the so￾called conjecture of G. Julia is well known (see for example [80, Chapter 1]).
In connection with this conjecture, we have the following.
Theorem 3.6.8. Let F be a family of holomorphic functions in Ω ⊂ C
2
.
Suppose that F(p) is bounded at each point p of Ω. If Ω × C is a domain of
normality of a family ΓF of graphs of F, then Ω is a domain of holomorphy.
Proof. Suppose that Ω is not a domain of holomorphy. Then since Ω is not
holomorphycally convex, there exists a compact set K in Ω such that
Ke =

is not compact in Ω. Put ρ = d(K, ∂Ω) and take a point p0 = (z0, ζ0) ∈ K˜
such that d (p0, ∂Ω) <
ρ
2
. It is well known that any holomorphic function in
Ω is also holomorphic in the polydisk

In fact, take a sequence {Γν} from ΓF . Since ΓF is normal in Ω × C, there
exists a subsequence {Γν
} which converges analytically to an analytic set A
in Ω × C. Let fνj be the function which represents the graph Γνj

which converges uniformly to a holomorphic function in ∆0

For simplicity, we may assume that {fνj} converges uniformly to ηe in ∆0
Application of Montel’s Theorem 37
Since ηe = η in ∆0 ∩ Ω, the holomorphic function ξ such that ξ = η in Ω and
ξ = ηe in ∆0
is determined. Then {Γνj} converges analytically to the analytic
set B = {(p, ξ(p)); p ∈ ∆0 ∪ D} in (∆0 ∪ Ω) × C. Since Ω × C is a domain of
holomorphy of ΓF , this is a contradiction.
Remark for Lemma 3.6.5.
Suppose in Lemma 3.6.5 we omit the condition of the boundedness of {fj}
at each point and consider under the condition only of an analytic convergence
of graphs. Put
Ω = {p ∈ D \ E; {fj (p)} is bounded }.
It is easily seen that the boundedness at p is equivalent to the condition
that A(p) 6= φ. Moreover, since A is fine in w at p ∈ D \ E, it is easy to see
that Ω = π(A) \ E, where π is the projection given by π(p, w) = p. Therefore
Ω is open. Thus, if Ω is not empty, then there exists a holomorphic function
η in Ω such that {fj} converges uniformly to η on every compact set in Ω. If
Ω = φ, then [(D \ E) × C] ∩ A = φ. Since {Ej} converges analytically to A,
for any compact set K1 in D \ E and for any positive number a, there exists
a j◦ such that Sj ∩ K = φ for all j = j0, where K = K1 × {w ∈ C; |w| 5 a}.
Thus if p ∈ K1 then (p, fj (p)) ∈/ K, i.e., |fj (p)| > a for all j = j0. This means
that {fj} is compactly divergent in D \ E.
Let D be a domain of holomorphy and let Ω 6= φ; then it is easily seen that
Ω is a holomorphic open set; i.e., any connected component of Ω is a domain
of holomorphy.
Lemma 3.6.9. Let Ω be a domain in C
2 and let {fj} , f be holomorphic
functions in Ω. Let Λ = {a, b, c} be a set consisting of three different complex
numbers. Suppose that for any α ∈ Λ, the sequence {Aj,α} of analytic sets in
D given by
Aν,α = {(x, y) ∈ Ω; fj (x, y) = α}
converges geometrically to an analytic set Aα = {(x, y) ∈ Ω; f(x, y) = α}.
Then {fν} is normal in Ω.
Proof. Take a point p ∈ Ω. If f(p) ∈/ Λ, then there exists a connected open
neighborhood V of p such that V ⊂⊂ Ω and f(V ) ∩ Λ = ∅. Therefore, Λ \
f(V ) = Λ. If f(p) ∈ Λ, we can choose a connected open neighborhood U of p
such that U ⊂⊂ Ω and f(U) ∩ [Λ \ {f(p)}] = ∅. In any case we can choose a
connected open neighborhood U of p such that U ⊂⊂ Ω and Λ\f(U) contains
at least two complex numbers. Let {a, b} ⊂ Λ \ f(U), then Aa ∩ U = ∅ and
Ab∩U = ∅. Since {Aj,a}, {Aj,b} converge geometrically to Aa, Ab respectively,
there exists a j0 such that Aj,a ∩ U = ∅, Aj,b ∩ U = ∅ for all j ≥ j0. That
is, the sequence {fj}j≥j0
does not take two different values a, b in U. Thus,
by the theorem of Montel (Theorem 3.5.2), it is normal in U. Since p is an
arbitrary point of Ω, {fj} is normal at each point of Ω. Then by the diagonal
method {fj} is normal in Ω.38 Normal Families in C

Definition 3.6.10. A set ω is called a set of uniqueness if and only if any
holomorphic function in Ω which is zero on ω is identically zero.
Theorem 3.6.11 (see [284, Theorem 3, p. 645]). Let {fj}, f be holomorphic
functions on Ω and let f be not constant. Let ω be a set of uniqueness. Let
Aj,a, Aa be the same as in Lemma 3.6.9. Suppose that for any a ∈ f(ω) the
sequence {Aj,a} of analytic sets in Ω converges geometrically to an analytic
set Aa, then {fj} converges uniformly to f on every compact set in Ω.
Proof. First, the set f(ω) contains infinitely many complex numbers. In fact,
suppose that f(ω) contains only finitely many complex numbers. Let f(ω) =
{a1, a2, . . . , am}. Put Si = {p ∈ Ω; f(p) = ai}. Then the analytic set S = ∪Si
is given by
S =
(
p ∈ Ω; g(p) =
i
Y=m
i=1
[f(p) − ai
] = 0)
.
Since f is not constant, g is also not constant. But since S ⊃ ω and since g = 0
on S, g is identically zero, this is a contradiction. Thus, by Lemma 3.6.9, {fν}
is normal in Ω.
To prove that the sequence {fν} converges uniformly to f on every com￾pact set in Ω, we have only to show that any sequence of {fν} contains
a subsequence which converges uniformly to f on every compact set in Ω.
Take a subsequence 
fνj
	
of {fν}. We may assume that 
fνj
	
is either com￾pactly uniformly convergent or compactly divergent. Since {Aν,a} converges
geometrically to Aa and since Aa is not empty, the case of compact diver￾gence does not occur. Let {fνj} converge uniformly to a holomorphic function
h on every compact set in Ω. Let p0 ∈ ω and let a = f(p0). Then, since
p0 ∈ Aa, there exists a sequence 
pνj
	
such that pνj ∈ Aνj ,a and pνj → p0.
Let K =

p0, pνj
; j = 1, 2, . . .	
. Since K is compact, for any positive number
ε there exists a j0 such that

p∈K

for all j ≥ j0. Then we have

(pνj

Since pνj ∈ Aνj ,a and since fνj
(pνj
) = a = f(p0), we have f(p0) = h(p0).
That is, f = h on ω, so that f = h on Ω.
Now we consider the case of just one complex variable and we get the
converse of the theorem of Hurwitz.
In Theorem 3.6.11, we cannot omit the condition that f is not constant.
But since Lemma 3.6.9 holds in the case that f is constant, by the same
method we can prove the following:Application of Montel’s Theorem 39
Theorem 3.6.12. Let U be an open set in the complex plane C such that
U ∩ f(Ω) 6= ∅. If {Aν,a} converges geometrically to Aa for all a ∈ U, then
{fν} converges uniformly to f on every compact set in Ω.
If a sequence {fj} of holomorphic functions in a domain Ω ⊂ C converges
to a nonconstant holomorphic function f on every compact set in Ω, then for
any point p ∈ Ω and for any complex number a, there exists a positive number
r which satisfies the following property:
For any r with 0 < r < r0, there exists a j0 such that the number of points
of fj in the disk {z ∈ C; |z − p| < r} are equal for all j ≥ j0, counted
according to multiplicities.
In fact, if f(p) 6= a, then there exists a neighborhood U of p such that U b
Ω and min = 
|f(z) − a| ; z ∈ U
	
= δ > 0. Since {fj} converges uniformly to
f on U, there exists a j such that
max 
|fj (z) − f(z)| ; z ∈ U
	
<
δ
2
for all j ≥ j0. Then
|fj (z) − a| ≥ |f(z) − a| − |fj (z) − f(z)| >
δ
2
for all j ≥ j0 and z ∈ U. That is fj (z) 6= a in U for all j ≥ j0. If f(p) = a,
then this is just the theorem of Hurwitz.
Since Theorem 3.6.11 holds for a domain in the complex plane, as the
converse of the above, we have
Corollary 3.6.13 (Corollary of Theorem 3.6.11). Let {fj}, f be holomorphic
functions in a domain Ω in C and let f be not constant. Suppose that for any
point p ∈ Ω and for any complex number a, there exists a positive number r0
satisfying the following property:
For any r with 0 < r < r0, there exists a j0 such that the number of a￾points of fj and f are equal in the disk {z ∈ C; |z − p| < r} for all j ≥ j0,
counted according to multiplicities.
Then {fj} converges uniformly to f on every compact set in Ω.
Proof. Because of Theorem 3.6.12 we have only to show that for every point
p ∈ Ω the sequence {Aj} of analytic sets given by Aj = {z ∈ Ω; fj (z) = f(p)}
converges geometrically to an analytic set A = {z ∈ Ω; f(z) = f(p)}.
It is easily seen that the condition (a) in Definition 3.6.1 is trivially ful￾filled.
Let K be a compact set in Ω such that A ∩ K = ∅. For any point q ∈
K, there exists a positive number δ such that f(z) − f(p) 6= 0 in the d =
{z ∈ Ω; |z − q| < δ}. Evidently we may assume that δ < r0. Then there exists40 Normal Families in C
n
a j0(q) such that fj (z) − f(p) 6= 0 in the disk d for all j ≥ j0(q). Since K is
compact we can choose finitely many such disks dν with center at qν and radius
δν such that K ⊂ ∪dν. Put j0 = max j0(qν). Then since fj (z)−f(p) 6= 0 in K
for all j ≥ j0, we have that Aj ∩ K = ∅ for all j ≥ j0. Thus the condition (b)
in Definition 3.6.1 proved. The theorem now follows from Theorem 3.6.12.
3.7 Riemann’s Theorem
The Riemann Mapping Theorem: Statement and Idea of Proof
Let us consider the question of conformal equivalence of planar domains. A
fundamental question here is “Which planar domains are conformally equiv￾alent to the unit disk D”?
We begin by examining the Cayley transform
z →
z − i
z + i
.
Under this mapping the point ∞ is sent to the point 1, the point 1 is
sent to the point (1 − i)/(1 + i) = −i, and the point −1 is sent to (−1 −
i)/(−1+i) = i. Thus the image under the Cayley transform (a linear fractional
transformation) of three points on R ∪ {∞} contains three points on the unit
circle. Since three points determine a (generalized) circle, and since linear
fractional transformations send generalized circles to generalized circles, we
conclude that the Cayley transform sends the real line to the unit circle. Now
the Cayley transform is one-to-one and onto from C ∪ {∞} to C ∪ {∞}. By
continuity, it either sends the upper half plane to the (open) unit disk or to
the complement of the closed unit disk. The image of i is 0, so in fact, the
Cayley transform sends the upper half plane to the unit disk.
The argument just given, while wordy, is conceptually much simpler and
quicker than the sort of calculations that we have given previously.
The conformal equivalence of open sets in C is generally not very easy to
compute or to verify, even in the special case of sets bounded by (general￾ized) circular arcs. For instance, it is the case (as will be verified soon) that
the square {z = x + iy : |x| < 1, |y| < 1} is conformally equivalent to the unit
disk D = {z ∈ C : |z| < 1}. But it is quite difficult to write down explicitly
the conformal equivalence. Even when a biholomorphic mapping is known
(from other considerations) to exist, it is generally quite difficult to find it.
Thus there is a priori interest in demonstrating the existence of the conformal
equivalence of certain open sets by abstract, nonconstructive methods. In this
section we will be concerned with the question of when an open set U ⊆ C is
conformally equivalent to the unit disk.Riemann’s Theorem 41
Several restrictions must obviously be imposed on U. For instance, U obvi￾ously cannot be C because every holomorphic function f : U → D would then
be constant (Liouville’s theorem). Also, U must be topologically equivalent
(i.e., homeomorphic) to the unit disk U since we are in fact demanding much
more in asking that U be conformally equivalent. For instance, U could not
be conformally equivalent to {z : 1 < |z| < 2} since it is not topologically (i.e.,
homeomorphically) equivalent. [Although at the moment we have no precise
proof that the two are not homeomorphic, this assertion is at least intuitively
plausible.]
Surprisingly, the two restrictions just indicated (that U not be C and
that U be topologically equivalent to D) are not only necessary but they are
sufficient to guarantee that U be conformally equivalent to the disk U.
To give this notion a more precise formulation, we first define formally
what we want to mean by topological (homeomorphic) equivalence:
Definition 3.7.1. Two open sets U and V in C are homeomorphic if there
is a one-to-one, onto, continuous function f : U → V with f
−1
: V → U also
continuous. Such a function f is called a homeomorphism from U to V .
[It is a fact that the inverse of a continuous, one-to-one, onto function
from one open subset of R
2
to another is automatically continuous. Thus
the condition in the definition of homeomorphism that f
−1 be continuous is
actually redundant. But this “automatic continuity” for the inverse function
is rather difficult to prove and plays no role in our later work. Thus we shall
skip the proof; the interested reader may consult a topology text.]
Theorem 3.7.2 (The Riemann mapping theorem). If U is an open subset of
C, U 6= C and if U is homeomorphic to D, then U is conformally equivalent
to D.
Riemann enunciated this theorem in 1851. Unfortunately Riemann’s proof
was flawed. He constructed his conformal mapping by way of the so-called
Dirichlet principle, and the version of that principle that he needed was not
fully understood at the time. Experts have said that it is not possible to make
Riemann’s argument rigorous.
It was many years before a rigorous proof of the Riemann mapping theorem
was finally produced—long after Riemann’s death. The first rigorous proof was
given by William Fogg Osgood in 1900. In modern times, Greene and Kim
have found a way to make Riemann’s original argument correct and rigorous
(see [92]). In fact, they won a prize for that paper.
The proof of the Riemann mapping theorem consists of two parts. First,
one shows that if a domain U is homeomorphic to the disk, then each holomor￾phic function on U has an antiderivative (this property is called “holomorphic
simple connectivity”). The argument to prove this assertion is essentially topo￾logical; and indeed the conclusion will be deduced from a topological condition
called simple connectivity that appears to be weaker than homeomorphism to
the disk, though it is in fact equivalent to it for open sets in C. The second step42 Normal Families in C
n
uses the first to construct a one-to-one holomorphic mapping from U into the
unit disk. We then construct a mapping from U to D that is both one to-one
and onto by solving an “extremal problem”; that is, we shall find a function
that maximizes some specific quantity (details will be provided momentarily).
That is where normal families comes in.
The second part of the proof of the Riemann mapping theorem will occupy
us for the rest of this section (Theorem 3.7.7—the analytic form of the Rie￾mann mapping theorem). The first, essentially topological, part of the proof
will be given separately. Before presenting the (second part of the) proof, let
us discuss the significance of the Riemann mapping theorem and of some of
the issues that it raises.
First, it is important to realize that homeomorphism is, in general, quite
far from implying biholomorphic equivalence:
Example 3.7.3. The entire plane C is topologically equivalent to the unit
disk U. An equivalence is given by
f(z) = z
1 + |z|
.
However, as previously noted, C is not conformally equivalent to U.
It is a fact that two annuli {z : r1 < |z| < r2} and {z : s1 < |z| < s2} are
conformally equivalent if and only if r2/r1 = s2/s1. Yet two such annuli are
always homeomorphic (exercise). Thus we see that the Riemann mapping
theorem is startling by comparison.
The idea of the proof of the Riemann mapping theorem comes from the
Schwarz lemma. Namely, one can think of this lemma in the following form:
Consider a holomorphic (not necessarily one-to-one and onto) function f :
D → D with f(0) = 0. Then f is conformal (i.e., one-to-one and onto) if and
only if |f
0
(0)| is as large as possible, that is, if and only if
|f
0
(0)| = sup {|h
0
(0)| : h : D → D, h(0) = 0, h holomorphic} .
The special attention paid to the point 0 here is inessential. In fact if f : D →
D is a holomorphic function such that
|f
0
(P)| = sup {|h
0
(P)| : h : D → D, h(P) = P, h holomorphic} ,
then f must be conformal. (Exercise: Prove this, and find an analogous state￾ment to cover the case when f maps P to Q and Q 6= P.)
If U satisfies the hypotheses of the Riemann mapping theorem, then one
might look for a conformal mapping of U to D by choosing a point P ∈ U
and then looking for a holomorphic function f : U → D such that f(P) = 0
and |f
0
(P)| is maximal. It turns out to be technically simpler to consider only
functions f that are assumed in advance to be one-to-one, and we shall take
advantage of the resulting simplification.Riemann’s Theorem 43
Several questions arise about our plan of attack. First, do there exist any
one-to-one holomorphic functions f : U → D? Assuming that there are such
functions, is the set of values {|f
0
(P)|} bounded? Also, is the least upper
bound attained? That is, is there a holomorphic function f from U to D such
that f(P) = 0 and |f
0
(P)| is as large as possible?
The latter question is of particular historical interest because Riemann
in fact neglected in his proof to verify that a similar sort of maximum was
assumed by some particular function. Thus his theorem was in doubt for
some time until a suitable version of what has become known as “Dirichlet’s
principle” gave a method to fill the gap. The modern approach to the Riemann
mapping theorem involves a convergence idea for holomorphic functions called
“normal families”, which we develop in the next section.
Note that the issue of the boundedness of the derivatives of f at P is
easily dispatched. For let f : U → D, f(P) = 0. Choose r > 0 such that
D(P, r) ⊆ U. Then, of course, |f(z)| ≤ 1 for all z; hence the Cauchy estimates
imply that |f
0
(P)| ≤ 1/r. Thus we have an a priori upper bound on the size of
derivatives of f at P. In the next section we turn our attention to establishing
the existence of an f whose derivative f
0
(P) has modulus that actually equals
the least upper bound of the absolute values of such derivatives.
Let us conclude this section by settling the derivative-maximizing holo￾morphic function issue that was raised earlier.
Proposition 3.7.4. Let U ⊆ C be any open set. Fix a point P ∈ U. Let F
be the family of holomorphic functions from U into the unit disk D that takes
P to 0. Then there is a holomorphic function f0 : U → D that is the normal
limit of a sequence {fj} , fj ∈ F, such that
|f
0
0
(P)| ≥ |f
0
(P)|
for all f ∈ F.
Proof. We have already noted that the Cauchy estimates give a finite upper
bound for |f
0
(P)| for all f ∈ F. Let
λ = sup {|f
0
(P)| : f ∈ F} .
By the definition of supremum, there is a sequence {fj} ⊆ F such that

f
0
j
(P)

 → λ. But the sequence {fj} is bounded by 1 since all elements of F
take values in the unit disk. Therefore Montel’s theorem applies and there
is a subsequence {fjk
} that converges uniformly on compact sets to a limit
function f0.
By the Cauchy estimates, the sequence 
f
0
jk
(P)
	
converges to f
0
0
(P).
Therefore |f
0
0
(P)| = λ as desired.
It remains to observe that, a priori, f0 is known only to map U into the
closed unit disk D. But the maximum modulus theorem implies that if f0(U)∩
{z : |z| = 1} 6= ∅, then f0 is a constant (of modulus 1). Since f0(P) = 0, the
function f0 certainly cannot be a constant of modulus 1. Thus f0(U) ⊂ D.44 Normal Families in C

Holomorphically Simply Connected Domains
The derivative-maximizing holomorphic function from an open set U to the
unit disk (as provided by Proposition 3.7.4) turns out to have some interesting
special properties when U resembles the disk in a certain sense. The type of
resemblance that we wish to consider is called “holomorphic simple connec￾tivity”. This terminology is a temporary one that we use for convenience; it
is not used universally (in particular, it is not found in most other texts on
complex function theory).
The concept of “holomorphically simply connected” (h.s.c.) arises natu￾rally in our present context. However, it turns out to be implied by a more
easily verified topological condition that is called simple connectivity. Simple
connectivity is in fact a universally used mathematical concept; it is a fact
that that simple connectivity implies holomorphic simple connectivity. Recall
the definition of holomorphic simple connectivity:
Definition 3.7.5. A connected open set U ⊆ C is holomorphically simply
connected if, for each holomorphic function f : U → C, there is a holomorphic
antiderivative F, that is, a function satisfying F
0
(z) = f(z).
Example 3.7.6. As established in [95, Chapter 4], open disks and open rect￾angles are holomorphically simply connected.
If U1 ⊆ U2 ⊆ . . . are holomorphically simply connected sets, then their
union U =
S
Uj is also holomorphically simply connected. In particular, the
plane C is holomorphically simply connected.
Theorem 3.7.7 (Riemann mapping theorem: analytic form). If U is a holo￾morphically simply connected open set in C and U =6 C, then U is conformally
equivalent to the unit disk.
The proof of this result involves some intricate constructions. We present
them in the next section. The rest of the present section is devoted to the
consideration of some preliminary results that are needed for the proof. These
results also have considerable intrinsic interest.
Lemma 3.7.8 (holomorphic logarithm lemma). Let U be a holomorphically
simply connected open set. If f : U → C is holomorphic and nowhere zero on
U, then there exists a holomorphic function h on U such that
e
h ≡ f on U.
Proof. The function z → f
0
(z)/f(z) is holomorphic on U, because f is
nowhere zero on U. Since U is holomorphically simply connected, there is
a function h : U → C such that h
0
(z) = f
0
(z)/f(z) on U. Fix a point z0 ∈ U.
Adding a constant to h if necessary, we may suppose that
e
h(z0) = f (z0).
After this normalization, we can now demonstrate that e
h ≡ f on U.Riemann’s Theorem 45
It is enough to show that g(z) ≡ f(z)e
−h(z)
satisfies g
0 ≡ 0 on U. For
then g is necessarily a constant. Since we have arranged that g (z0) = 1, we
conclude that g(z) ≡ 1. This is equivalent to what we want to prove. Now

by the way that we constructed h.
Corollary 3.7.9. If U is holomorphically simply connected and f : U →
C \ {0} is holomorphic, then there is a function g : U → C \ {0} such that
f(z) = [g(z)]2
for all z ∈ U.
Proof. Choose h as in the lemma. Set g(z) = e
h(z)/2
.
It is important to realize that the possibility of taking logarithms, or of
taking roots, depends critically on the holomorphic simple connectivity of U.
There are connected open sets (such as the annulus {z : 1 < |z| < 2}) for which
these processes are not possible even for the function f(z) ≡ z.
The Proof of the Analytic Form of the Riemann Mapping The￾orem
Let U be a holomorphically simply connected open set in C that is not equal
to all of C. In the sequel we call such set a proper domain. Fix a point P ∈ U
and set
F = {f : f is holomorphic on U, f : U → D,
f is one-to-one, f(P) = 0}.
We shall prove the following three assertions:
(1) F is nonempty.
(2) There is a function f0 ∈ F such that
|f
0
0
(P)| = sup
h∈F
|h
0
(P)| .
(3) If g is any element of F such that |g
0
(P)| = suph∈F |h
0
(P)|, then g maps
U onto the unit disk D.46 Normal Families in C
n
The proof of assertion (1) is by direct construction. Statement (2) is almost
the same as Proposition 3.7.4 (however there is now the extra element that
the derivative-maximizing map must be shown to be one-to-one). Statement
(3) is the least obvious and will require some work: If the conclusion of (3)
is assumed to be false, then we are able to construct an element gb ∈ F such
that |gb
0
(P)| > |g
0
(P)|. Now we turn to the proofs.
Proof of (1). If U is bounded, then this assertion is easy: If we simply let
a = 1/(2 sup {|z| : z ∈ U})
and b = −aP, then the function f(z) = az + b is in F.
If U is unbounded, we must work a bit harder. Since U 6= C, there is
a point Q /∈ U. The function φ(z) = z − Q is nonvanishing on U, and U
is holomorphically simply connected. Therefore there exists a holomorphic
function h such that h
2 = φ. Notice that h must be one-to-one since φ is.
Also there cannot be two distinct points z1, z2 ∈ U such that h (z1) = −h (z2)
[otherwise φ (z1) = φ (z2)]. Now h is a nonconstant holomorphic function;
hence an open mapping. Thus the image of h contains a disk D(b, r). But
then the image of h must be disjoint from the disk D(−b, r). We may therefore
define the holomorphic function
f(z) = r
2(h(z) + b)
.
Since |h(z) − (−b)| ≥ r for z ∈ U, it follows that f maps U to U. Since
h is one-to-one, so is f. Composing f with a suitable automorphism of U (a
Möbius transformation), we obtain a function that is not only one-to-one and
holomorphic with image in the disk, but also maps P to 0. Thus f ∈ F.
Proof of (2). Proposition 3.7.4 will yield the desired conclusion once it has
been established that the limit derivative-maximizing function is itself one-to￾one. Suppose for notation that the fj ∈ F converge normally to f0, with
|f
0
0
(P)| = sup
f∈F
|f
0
(P)| .
We want to show that f0 is one-to-one into U. The argument principle,
specifically Hurwitz’s theorem, will now yield this conclusion:
Fix a point b ∈ U. Consider the holomorphic functions gj (z) ≡ fj (z)−fj (b)
on the open set U \ {b}. Each fj is one-to-one: hence each gj is nowhere
vanishing on U \ {b}. Hurwitz’s theorem guarantees that either the limit
function f0(z) − f0(b) is identically zero or is nowhere vanishing. But, for
a function h ∈ F, it must hold that h
0
(P) 6= 0 because if h
0
(P) were
equal to zero, then that h would not be one-to-one. Since F is nonempty,
it follows that suph∈F |h
0
(P)| > 0. Thus the function f0, which satisfies
|f
0
0
(P)| = suph∈F |h
0
(P)|, cannot have f
0
0
(P) = 0 and f0 cannot be con￾stant. The only possible conclusion is that f0(z) − f0(b) is nowhere zero onRiemann’s Theorem 47
U \ {b}. Since this statement holds for each b ∈ U, we conclude that f0 is
one-to-one.
Proof of (3). Let g ∈ F and suppose that there is a point R ∈ U such that
the image of g does not contain R. Set
φ(z) = g(z) − R
1 − g(z)R¯
.
Here we have composed g with a transformation that preserves the disk
and is one-to-one. Note that φ is nonvanishing.
The holomorphic simple connectivity of U guarantees the existence of a
holomorphic function ψ : U → C such that ψ
2 = φ. Now ψ is still one-to￾one and has range contained in the unit disk. However, it cannot be in F
since it is nonvanishing. We repair this by composing with another Möbius
transformation: Define
ρ(z) = ψ(z) − ψ(P)
1 − ψ(z)ψ(P)
Then ρ(P) = 0, ρ maps U into the disk, and ρ is one-to-one. Therefore ρ ∈ F.
Now we will calculate the derivative of ρ at P and show that it is actually
larger in modulus than the derivative of g at P.

Thus, if the mapping g of statement (3) at the beginning of the section
were not onto, then it could not have property (2)—of maximizing the absolute
value of the derivative at P.
We have completed the proofs of each of the three assertions and hence of
the analytic form of the Riemann mapping theorem.
The proof of statement (3) may have seemed unmotivated. Let us have
another look at it. Let
µ(z) = z − R
1 − Rz¯
,
τ (z) = z − ψ(P)
1 − ψ(P)z
,
and
S(z) = z

−1 ◦ S ◦ τ

:
g = µ

≡ h ◦ ρ.
Now the chain rule tells us that
|g
0
(P)| = |h

(0)| · |ρ
0
(P)| .
Since h(0) = 0 and since h is not a conformal equivalence of the disk to
itself, the Schwarz lemma will then tell us that |h
0
(0)| must be less than 1.
But this says that |g
0
(P)| < |ρ
0
(P)|, giving us the required contradiction.
The Riemann mapping theorem has no analogue in higher dimensions: A
theorem of Liouville (see e.g. [219],[83]) states that every conformal map of a
domain in R
n with n > 2 is a Möbius transformation.
One sometimes adds this misleading comment that there is no Riemann
mapping theorem in several variables. We next describe two positive mapping
theorems. It is not hard to see that the only plane domains Ω =6 C for which
the automorphism group is transitive are those biholomorphic to the disk.
Bun Wong [286] showed that the corresponding statement is true for strictly
pseudoconvex domains in C
n, n > 1. Later, Rosay [250] generalized this result
to the following statement.
Theorem 3.7.10. A bounded domain in C
n with C
2
boundary whose auto￾morphism group is transitive is biholomorphic to the unit ball in C
n; i.e. a
bounded homogeneous domain with C
2
boundary is biholomorphic to the ball.Julia’s Theorem 49
It should be remarked that bounded homogeneous domains are always
(without any assumptions on the boundary) domains of holomorphy, i.e. pseu￾doconvex. There are, of course, many such domains without smooth boundary.
The next theorem, due to B. Fridman [77], may claim to be an approximate
Riemann mapping theorem.
Theorem 3.7.11. Let Ω be a bounded pseudoconvex domain in C
n diffeomor￾phic to the unit ball Bn. Given ε > 0, there exist domains Ω1 ⊂ Ω, Ω2 ⊂ Bn
whose boundaries are within ε of those of Ω and Bn respectively such that Ω1
and Ω2 are biholomorphically equivalent.
Let us mention also a result of Bedford and Pinchuk [22] which confirms,
at least partially, a conjecture of Greene and Krantz [94].
Theorem 3.7.12. A (weakly) pseudoconvex domain in C
2 with real analytic
boundary whose automorphism group is non-compact is biholomorphic to a
domain of the form

(z, w) ∈ C

For more on this subject see Bell and Narasimhan [23].
3.8 Julia’s Theorem
Let Ω be a domain in C
n containing the origin 0. Let F be a family of holo￾morphic functions in Ω. Consider the set
Z0 := {z = (z1, z2, . . . , zn) : zj = 0 (j = 1, . . . , n − 1), 0 < |zn| < r} ,
in Ω and assume that F is a normal family at each point of Z0; i.e., for any
p ∈ Z0 there exists a connected neighborhood V of p in Ω such that F is
normal on V .
Under this assumption we have the following theorem.
Theorem 3.8.1. (Julia [125]). Suppose F is not normal at the origin 0.
Then, given any r
0 with 0 < r0 < r, there exists ρ > 0 such that for any

such that F is not normal at q.50 Normal Families in C

Proof. Since {0}×{|zn| = r
0} ⊂ Z0, it follows from our assumptions that there
exist a ρ sufficiently small and 0 < ε < r0
such that, setting S2 := P(00

we have S2 ⊂ Ω and F is normal on S2. We prove that this ρ > 0 yields
the conclusion of the theorem. For suppose not. Then there exists some z

Here P

a subsequence {fjk
} of {fj} such that fjk
converges uniformly on S1 ∪ S2 to
a function g holomorphic on S1 ∪ S2 or to g ≡ ∞.
If g is holomorphic, then |g(z)| ≤ M < ∞ on the skeleton Ξ of the poly￾disk P(0, ρ0
0
) × {zn ∈ C : |zn| ≤ r
0} and hence |fj | ≤ M + 1 on Ξ. But then,
by the maximum principle, |fj | ≤ M + 1 on P(0, ρ0
0
) × {zn ∈ C : |zn| ≤ r
0}
for j ≥ j0. By Montel’s theorem, {fj (z)} converges uniformly on P(0, ρ0
0
) ×
{zn ∈ C : |zn| ≤ r
0}. This contradicts our assumption that F is not normal at
the origin 0.
Thus we may assume that the limiting function g ≡ ∞ on Ξ. If g ≡
∞, then, relabeling a subsequence, we may suppose that |fj | ≥ j on G :=
P(z
0
0j
, ρ0
0
) × {zn ∈ C : r
0 − ε < |zn| ≤ r
0}.
If infinitely many of the fj (z) are nonvanishing on
P(0, ρ0
0
) × {zn ∈ C : |zn| ≤ r
0
}
it follows that 1/fj is holomorphic and 1/ |fj | < 1/j on
P(0, ρ0
0
) × {zn ∈ C : |zn| ≤ r
0
} .
Therefore the sequence {1/fj (z)} converges uniformly on
P(0, ρ0
0
) × {zn ∈ C : |zn| ≤ r
0
} to 0.
Hence {fj} converges uniformly on P(0, ρ0
0
) × {zn ∈ C : |zn| ≤ r
0} to ∞. This
also contradicts our assumption that F is not normal at the origin 0.
Thus there exist a subsequence of function {fjk

0

with |zn(z

we fix z

fjk
(z) → ∞ as k → ∞ uniformly on P

), and proves the theorem.
Remark 3.8.2. In general topology, a subset of a topological space is perfect
if it is closed and has no isolated points. Denote by (F) a subset of Ω where
F is not locally normal. It follows at once from the definition of the locally
normal family that (F) is closed in Ω. From the above theorem we see that
(F) cannot have isolated points, hence (F) is perfect.
The points of (F) must go beyond the boundary of the domain Ω. The
proof goes by contradiction. Suppose that there are two points Q ∈ (F) and
Z ∈ ∂Ω such that dist(V, Z) ≤ dist(Q, Z) for all V ∈ (F). We may choose
coordinates z1, . . . , zn in C
n such that Q = (0) and Z = (δ,0 0). Clearly,
dist(Q, Z) = δ. By Theorem 3.8.1 for z
0 = (−ρ/2,
0 0) ∈ C
n, there must be at
least one point q on the set
Zz
0 : z1 = −ρ/2, zj = 0 (j = 2, . . . , n − 1), 0 < |zn| < r0
,
such that F is not normal at q. It is plain by inspection that
dist(q, Z) > δ + ρ/2 > δ = dist(Q, Z).
This is a contradiction, which proves our assertion.
Remark 3.8.3. There are three definitions of pseudoconvex domains in C
n,
n ≥ 2, which are equivalent (see [220, Chapter 4, p. 112-115]. One of them is
the following:
Definition 3.8.4. Let Ω be a domain in C
n(n ≥ 2) and let P = (a1, . . . , an) ∈
∂Ω. We say that Ω is pseudoconvex at the boundary point P if the following
holds: under the assumption that there exists r > 0 such that the punctured
disk
Za : zj = aj (j = 1 . . . , n − 1), 0 < |zn − an| < r
is contained in Ω, we have, for any r

Let F be a family of holomorphic functions in Ω ⊂ C
n. The set Ω

con￾sisting of all points z in Ω such that F is normal in a neighborhood of z is
called the domain of normality of F. Julia’s theorem states that if Ω is a
pseudoconvex domain, so is Ω
0
.
In Oka [229] the definition of a normal family of analytic hypersurfaces in
a domain in C
n was given, and it was proved that the domain of normality of
such a family in a pseudoconvex domain is also a pseudoconvex domain. This
study was developed in his last paper [228].
3.9 Schwick’s Normality Criterion
As Royden [252] pointed out, although Marty’s result is necessary and suffi￾cient for the relative compactness of a family of holomorphic or meromorphic
functions, it may not be easy to apply in certain instances. For example, it is
not obvious how Theorem 3.2.3 can be applied to establish normality of the
family

Zalcman’s rescalling lemma (Theorem 3.3.1) can be used to prove the fol￾lowing strengthening of the sufficiency part of Marty’s normality criterion
(Theorem 3.2.3):
Theorem 3.9.1 (see [64, Theorem 3]). Let F be a family of holomorphic
functions on a domain Ω ⊂ C
n with the property that, for each compact set
K ⊂ Ω, there is a function hK : [0, ∞] → [0, ∞], which is bounded in some
neighborhood of each z0 ∈ (0, ∞), such that
(1 + |f(z)|
2
)f
]
(z) ≤ hK(|f(z)|)
for all f ∈ F and z ∈ K. Then F is normal in Ω.
Proof. Since all features of the theorem are local, and translation and scale
invariant, it suffices to consider the case when z0 = 0 and Ω = B(0, 1). If F is
not normal at 0, it follows from Zalcman’s rescalling lemma (Theorem 3.3.1)
that there exist fj ∈ F, zj → 0, ρj → 0, such that the sequence
gj (z) = fj (zj + ρj z)
converges locally uniformly in C
n to a nonconstant entire function g satisfying
g
]
(z) ≤ g
]
(0) = 1.
It is clear from (3.2) that g
] has the expression
g
]
(z) = |Dg(z)|
1 + |g(z)|
2
which in particular shows that g
]
is a continuous function.Schwick’s Normality Criterion 53
Since g
]
(z) is continuous on C
n, there exists some δ, 0 < δ < 1, such that
|g
]
(z) − g
]

whenever z ∈ B(0, δ). For all such z we have, using the reverse triangle in￾equality,

for all z ∈ B(0, δ). Since g is a nonconstant entire function, it follows that
there exists a ∈ B(0, δ) such that |g(a)| 6= 0 and g
]
(a) > 1/2.
For fixed r, 0 < r < 1, the hypothesis says that there exists a function
hr : [0, ∞] → [0, ∞] such that
(1 + |f(z)|
2
)f
]
(z) ≤ hr(|f(z)|)
for all f ∈ F, z ∈ B(0, r). Also there exists some constants M > 0 and σ > 0,
say, such that hr(x) < M for |x − |g(a)|| < σ. For all j sufficiently large,
|zj + ρja| ≤ |zj | + ρj |a| < r;
this yields zj + ρja ∈ B(0, r). Next we have
gj (a) = fj (zj + ρja) → g(a),
which yields ||gj (a)| − |g(a)|| < σ for j sufficiently large. So, if j is sufficiently
large,

ρj =
hr(|gj (a)|)
1 + |gj (a)|
2
ρj ≤ hr(|gj (a)|)ρj ≤ M ρj → 0.
This implies that g
]
(a) = 0, which is a contradiction to g
]
(a) > 1/2. This
contradiction proves Theorem 3.9.1.
Remark 3.9.2. Obviously the result has its origin in the sufficiency of Marty’s
normality criterion (Theorem 3.2.3).

So, if n = 1, Theorem 3.9.1 coincides with Schwick’s theorem [265, Theo￾rem, p. 91], which is the generalization of a normality criterion of Royden [252].
Clearly a result like Theorem 3.9.1 can be useful.
3.10 Grahl and Nevo’s Normality Criterion
By Marty’s normality criterion (Theorem 3.2.3), the normality of a family
F of holomorphic functions on a domain Ω ⊂ C
n is equivalent to the local
boundedness of the corresponding family F
]
:= 
f
]
(z) : f ∈ F, z ∈ Ω
	
. It is
rather surprising that there is also a normality criterion based on a lower
bound of the family F
]
.
The result which follows is the extension of Grahl and Nevo’s normality
criterion [86] to a family of holomorphic functions of several complex variables.
Theorem 3.10.1. Let F be a family of holomorphic functions on Ω ⊂ C
n and
assume that for each compact subset K ⊂ Ω, there exists a constant M(K) > 0
such that
f
]
(z) ≥ M(K), z ∈ K,
holds for every f ∈ F. Then F is normal in Ω.
Proof. The proof will be based again on Zalcman’s rescalling lemma (Theo￾rem 3.3.1).
Since normality is a local property, we can restrict all our considerations
concerning normal families to the unit ball. So there is no harm in assuming
that
F =

f holomorphic in Ω : f
]
(z) > ε for all z ∈ B(0, 1)	
for some ε > 0.
To obtain a contradiction suppose that F is not normal at the point 0. If F
is not normal at 0, it follows from Zalcman’s rescalling lemma (Theorem 3.3.1)
that there exist fj ∈ F, zj → 0, ρj → 0, such that the sequence
gj (z) = ρ

]
(0) = 1. Since g is a nonconstant entire function it follows that there
exists a ∈ Ω such that |g(a)| > 0. Hence |gj (a)| 6= 0 for all j sufficiency large.
It is easy to see that

The right-hand side of this inequality tends to infinity as j → ∞, a contra￾diction. This contradiction shows that F is normal in Ω.

n, there exists a constant CΩ < ∞
(depending only on Ω) such that

for all j. But then of course
j < f]
j

for all j. For j > M this gives a contradiction.
In [8], Alexander has made a study of the volume images of varieties. One
of the principal tools in his study is the generalized Crofton’s formula. As an
application of his results he obtains the following theorem:
Theorem 3.10.3. Let F be a family of holomorphic functions on the ball
B ⊆ C
n.
(a) If the restriction of F to each complex line through the origin is a normal
family, then F is a normal family.
(b) If the restriction of F to each complex line through the origin is normal
at the origin (i.e. in a neighborhood of the origin), then F is normal on B
at the origin.56 Normal Families in C
n
It is true that Theorem 3.10.1 can be proved by the method of restriction to
a complex lines passing through 0, and this involves calling in the Alexander
theorem, a proof of which is not easy. We shall not prove the Alexander
theorem here. Instead we refer the interested reader to his [8, Theorem 6.2, p.
248].
Nishino [221] proved that a family F of analytic functions on a domain Ω
in C
2
is normal if the restriction to each coordinate line (of the form z1 = λ
or z2 = λ) is normal.
It is of great interest to find simple proofs of these theorems.
3.11 Lappan’s Normality Criterion
The Zalcman normality criterion has proved to be a useful tool in the study of
normal families of holomorphic functions. Zalcman’s normality criterion and
the one-dimensional Nevanlinna theorem can be used to prove the following
theorem, which generalizes those obtained by Lappan [161].
Theorem 3.11.1. Let F be a family of holomorphic functions on a domain
Ω ⊂ C
n with the property that for each compact set K ⊂ Ω, there is a function
h
0
K(|·|) : C → [0, ∞], which is finite for at least three point on C, such that
(1 + |f(z)|
2
)f
]
(z) ≤ h
0
K(|f(z)|) (3.1)
for all f ∈ F and z ∈ K. Then F is normal in Ω.
Let us begin with a definition.
Definition 3.11.2. Let g(λ) be a holomorphic function in C. If the equation
g(λ) = a, a ∈ C has no simple roots then a called a totally ramified value.
Note that an omitted value trivially satisfies this definition, but that it
will be useful to distinguish between omitted values and nonomitted totally
ramified values.
Theorem 3.11.3 (R. Nevanlinna [269, Theorem 17.3.10., p. 274]). Let g be
an entire (holomorphic in C) function. Then g has at most two totally ramified
(finite) values.
Proof of Theorem 3.11.1. We shall show that the assumption that F is not
normal at point z0 ∈ Ω leads to a contradiction. Since all features of the
theorem are local, and translation and scale-change invariant, it suffices to
consider the case when z0 = 0 and Ω = B(0, 1). If F is not normal at 0, it
follows from Zalcman’s Lemma 3.3.1 that there exists fj ∈ F, zj → 0, ρj → 0,
such that the sequence
gj (z) := fj (zj + ρj z)Lappan’s Normality Criterion 57
converges uniformly on compact subsets of C
n to a nonconstant entire function
g satisfying g
]

]
(0) = 1.
Let K ⊂ B(0, 1) be a closed ball in C
n about 0. Let E = E(K) =
{a1, a2, a3} be the set of three distinct values in C such that the function
h
0
K is finite on E and let M = M(K) be the maximal value of h
0
K on E.
Define the value set by
Agj
(al) := {ξ ∈ C
n
: gj (ξ) = al} = g
−1
j
[{al}].
Suppose that ζ
l ∈ Ag(al). Choose R > 0 such that ζ
l ∈ SR = {ξ ∈
C
n : |ξ| < R}. Since normality is a local property, the restriction of a family
{gj − al} to any open ball sn(ζ
l
) := {ξ ∈ C
n : |ξ − ζ
l
| < 1/n} ⊂ SR is a
normal family. By Hurwitz’s theorem (Theorem 2.0.14) Agj
(al) ∩ sn(ζ
l
) =6 ∅
for j sufficiently large since g is not a constant function. It is routine to show
that there exists a sequence {p
l
j
} ⊂ SK, such that gj (p
l
j
) = al
.
Since ρj → 0, we see that zj + ρjp
l
j ∈ K for j sufficiently large. Now by
(3.1), (1 + |fj (zj + ρjp

it follows that al
is a finite totally ramifies value for g(ζ
l + λ · v) (v ∈ C
n
arbitrary (but fixed) and |v| = 1).
If {ξ ∈ C
n : ξ = ζ
l + λ · v} ∩ Ag(a

, then ζ
k = ζ
l + λk · v for some
λk ∈ C. Arguing as above we have
g

(ζ

Hence ak is a totally ramified value for g(ζ
l + λ · v).
If {ξ ∈ C
n : ξ = ζ
l + λ · v} ∩ Ag(a
k
) = ∅, then a
k
is an omitted value
for g(ζ
l + λ · v) and hence a totally ramified (finite) value of the function
g(ζ

Thus a1, a2, a3 are three totally ramified (finite) values for the entire func￾tion g

is constant. Since v
was arbitrary the function g is constant, a contradiction. Thereby, the theorem
is proved.
One almost immediate consequence of the (proof of the) above Theorem
is the following extension and sharpening of Schwick’s extension [265] of a
theorem of Royden [252] (see also [64]).58 Normal Families in C

3.12 Mandelbrojt’s Normality Criterion
Mandelbrojt [184] provided a boundedness criterion for a family F of zero￾free holomorphic functions on a region Ω ⊂ C to be normal: For each compact
K ⊂ Ω, f ∈ F define
M(f, K) := max{|f(z)|/|f(w)| : z, w ∈ K}
and
L(f, K) := max{log |f(z)|/ log |f(w)| : z, w ∈ K}
if f(K)∩T = ∅; otherwise L(f, K) := +∞. Then F is normal if and only if for
each K the set {min{M(f, K), L(f, K)} : f ∈ F} is bounded. That criterion
can be considered as a variation of Montel’s theorem.
A similar result holds in several variables:
Theorem 3.12.1. [[63, Theorem 1.1]] Let F be a family of zero-free holo￾morphic functions in a domain Ω ⊂ C
n. Then F is normal in Ω if and only
if for each point z0 ∈ Ω there exists a ball B(z0, r0) ⊂ Ω such that the set
{min{M(f, B(z0, r0)), L(f, B(z0, r0))} : f ∈ F} is bounded.
We shall need the following preliminary result:
Theorem 3.12.2. If a family of holomorphic functions F is normal in a
domain Ω ⊂ C
n, then about each point z
0 ∈ Ω there is a ball B(z
0
, r) ⊆ Ω
such that either
|f(z)| < 2 or
1
|f(z)|
< 2
holds for all z ∈ B(z
0
, r), f ∈ F, and conversely.
The partitioning of the family F into two normal families works equally
well if the constant 2 in the above is replace by an arbitrary positive constant.
Proof of Theorem 3.12.2. If w

00 are in the finite plane, then

holds if w

Let z0 be arbitrary but fixed point in Ω. If, say, |f(z0)| ≤ 1 then |f(z)| < 2
for z ∈ B(z0, r), f ∈ F, (otherwise, χ(f(z), f(z0)) > χ(1, 2)), a contradiction
with the inequality (3.2). However if |f(z0)| > 1, then |f(z)| > 1/2 (otherwise,
χ(f(z), f(z0)) > χ(1, 1/2) = χ(1, 2)), a contradiction with the inequality (3.2).
Therefore, if z ∈ B(z0, r), either
|f(z)| < 2 or
1
|f(z)|
< 2, f ∈ F.
It follows that F can be expressed as the union of two families:
J = {f ∈ F, |f(z0)| ≤ 1, |f(z)| < 2, z ∈ B(z0, r)} ,
H = {f ∈ F,
1
|f(z0)|
< 1,
1
|f(z)|
< 2, z ∈ B(z0, r)} .
Proof of Theorem 3.12.1. ⇒ Fix a point z0 in Ω and consider a ball
B(z0, r) ⊂ Ω.60 Normal Families in C
n
Suppose that F is normal in Ω but the set
{min{M(f, B(z0, r0)), L(f, B(z0, r0))} : f ∈ F} ,
for some r0 < r, is unbounded. Then there exists a sequence {fj} ⊆ F such
that
min{M(fj , B(z0, r0)), L(fj , B(z0, r0))} > j for all j ∈ N. (3.3)
By hypothesis F is normal, and therefore the following two cases exhaust
all the possibilities for sequence {fj}:
(1) the sequence {fj} has a subsequence {fjk
} which converges uniformly on
B(z0, r0) to a holomorphic function f;
(2) the sequence {fj} has a subsequence {fjk
} which converges uniformly on
B(z0, r0) to ∞.
Since F is a family of zero-free holomorphic functions in a domain Ω, by
Hurwitz’s theorem (Theorem 2.0.14) f is either nowhere zero or identically
equal to zero.
Therefore, the following three cases exhaust all the possibilities for se￾quence {fj}:
(a) the sequence {fj} has a subsequence {fjk
} which converges uniformly on
B(z0, r0) to the holomorphic function f ≡ 0;
(b) the sequence {fj} has a subsequence {fjk
} which converges uniformly on
B(z0, r0) to a holomorphic function f which is zero-free on B(z0, r0);
(c) the sequence {fj} has a subsequence {fjk
} which converges uniformly on
B(z0, r0) to ∞.
Since jk ≥ k, it follows readily from (3.3) that
min{M(fjk
, B(z0, r0)), L(fjk
, B(z0, r0))} > k for all k ∈ N. (3.4)
In case (a) (respectively in case (c)) we have |fjk
(z)| < 1/2 (respec￾tively |fjk
(z)| > 2) for all z ∈ B(z0, r) and all k ∈ N sufficiently large.
Hence log |fjk
(z)| is a negative (respectively positive) pluriharmonic function
in B(z0, r). Pluriharmonic functions form a subclass of the class of harmonic
functions in B(z0, r) (obviously proper for n > 1). So by Harnack’s inequality
there exists some constant C = C(B(z0, r0), B(z0, r)), C ∈ (1, ∞), such that
log |fjk
(z)|
log |fjk
(w)|
≤ C for all z and w in B(z0, r0),
and hence L(fjk
, B(z0, r0)) ≤ C for all k ∈ N sufficiently large.Mandelbrojt’s Normality Criterion 61
In case (b) we have limk→∞ |fjk
(z)| = f(z) for all z ∈ B(z0, r). It follows
that

uniformly for z, w ∈ B(z0, r0). The function f(z)/f(w) is holomorphic on
B(z0, r0) × B(z0, r0), so it follows that M(f, B(z0, r0)) is bounded. Since
M(fjk
, B(z0, r0)) → M(f, B(z0, r0)) as k → ∞, we conclude that
M(fjk
, B(z0, r0))
is also bounded for all k ∈ N sufficiently large.
Hence the set of quantities min{M(fjk
, B(z0, r0)), L(fjk
, B(z0, r0)), k ∈
N, } is bounded, which is a contradiction to (3.4).
⇐ Fix a point z0 in Ω, consider a ball B(z0, r0) ⊂ Ω, and define the families
J and H by
J = {f ∈ F, |f(z0)| ≤ 1} ,
H = {f ∈ F, |f(z0)| > 1} .
It will be shown that J is normal in O(Ω) and that H is normal in C(Ω, C∞).
To prove that the family J := {f ∈ F : |f(z0)| ≤ 1} is normal, it is
sufficient to show that each sequence {fj} ⊂ J contains a subsequence con￾verging locally uniformly in B(z0, r0) to a holomorphic function or to ∞. The
following two cases exhaust all the possibilities:
(a) there exists a subsequence {fjk
} such that for any k ∈ N the function log |fjk
|
does not vanish in B(z0, r0);
(b) for each j ∈ N there exists zj ∈ B(z0, r0) such that log |fj (zj )| = 0.
In case (a) we have that |fjk
| < 1 in B(z0, r0) for all elements of the
sequence. Such a subsequence is normal in B(z0, r0) by Montel’s theorem,
and hence we are done in case (a).
In case (b) we have L(fj , B(z0, r0)) = +∞ for all j ∈ N. Therefore, ac￾cording to the hypothesis, M(fj , B(z0, r0)) < C for all j ∈ N and some
constant C > 0. It follows that |fj | < C in B(z0, r0) for all j ∈ N, which
means that {fj} is a normal family in B(z0, r0) and hence finishes the proof
in case (b).
If f ∈ H, then 1/f is holomorphic on Ω because f never vanishes. Also,
1/f never vanishes and 1/|f(z0)| < 1. Hence reasoning similar to that in the
above proof shows that He = {1/f : f ∈ H} is also normal in O(B(z0, r0)).
So if {fj} is a sequence in H there is a subsequence {fjk
} and an analytic
function h on B(z0, r0) such that {1/fjk
} converges in O(B(z0, r0)) to h. By
the generalized Hurwitz theorem (Theorem 2.0.14), either h ≡ 0 or h never
vanishes. If h ≡ 0 it is easy to see that fjk
(z) → ∞ uniformly on compact
subsets of B(z0, r0). If h never vanishes, then 1/h is analytic and it follows
that fjk
(z) → 1/h(z) uniformly on compact subsets of B(z0, r0).62 Normal Families in C
n
It follows that J and H are normal at z0 so that the union F is normal in
B(z0, r0). Since normality is a local property, F is a normal family in Ω. This
completes the proof of the theorem.
Remark 3.12.3. It should be pointed out that the above theorem is not true
if the condition “for each point z0 ∈ Ω there exists a ball B(z0, r0) ⊂ Ω such
that the the set of quantities L(f, B(z0, r0)), f ∈ F, is bounded” is replaced
by the condition “the corresponding family of functions given by |g(z)|/|g(w)|
is locally bounded on Ω × Ω” (cf. [260, Theorem 2.2.8]).
To see this, consider the family F = {z
j}∞
j=1 of holomorphic functions. If
we take A = {z ∈ C : 1/2 < |z| < 1}, then F|A is a set of bounded (by 1)
zero-free holomorphic functions in A so Montel’s theorem guarantees that F
is normal. It is plain by inspection that the family n
|z|
j
|w|
j
o∞
j=1
is not locally
bounded on A × A, while n
log |z|
j
log |w|
j
o∞
j=1
is a locally bounded family on A × A.
Hence Theorem 2.2.8 in [260] is not true.
Remark 3.12.4. As in the proof of Marty’s normality criterion (Theo￾rem 3.2.3), the necessary part of Theorem 3.12.1 also can be proved as fol￾lows. Suppose that F is normal in Ω, but L(fj , B(z0, r0)) is unbounded. Hence
B(z0, r0) is compactly included in Ω, the map F 3 f 7→ M(f, B(z0, r0)) ∈ R
is continuous and explodes only in a neighborhood of {f ≡ 0} and {f ≡ ∞}.
So it is sufficient to consider a sequence {fj} converging locally uniformly in Ω
(and hence uniformly in B(z0, r0)) either to 0 or to ∞. For these cases one uses
argument based on the Harnak inequality in order to obtain a contradiction.
3.13 Zalcman-Pang’s Lemma
Marty’s criterion (Theorem 3.2.3) in conjunctions with the ideas of Lawrence
Zalcman and Xue-cheng Pang yields the following theorem.
Theorem 3.13.1. A family F of functions holomorphic on Ω ⊂ C
n is not
normal at some point z0 ∈ Ω if and only if there exist sequences fj ∈ F,
zj → z0, rj → 0, such that the sequence

(0 ≤ α < 1 arbitrary)
converges locally uniformly in C
n to a nonconstant entire function g satisfying

(z) ≤ g
]
(0) = 1.
Remark 3.13.2. Zalcman’s lemma (Theorem 3.3.1) is the case α = 0 of the
result given above.Zalcman-Pang’s Lemma 63
Of central importance in the proof of Theorem 3.13.1 is the following
lemma.
Lemma 3.13.3. Let f be a holomorphic function on the unit ball B = {z ∈
C
n : |z| < 1}, and α be a real number with 0 ≤ α < 1. Suppose that j ≥ 3 and

Then there exists a point ξ

that

|z|≤1/j

)
(1 − j|ξ

2αρ
2α + |f(ξ

2
= 1.
Proof. To prove this lemma, we consider the function
ϕ(t, z) := (1 − j|z|)
1+αt
1+α(1 + |f(z)|
2
)f
]
(z)
(1 − j|z|)
2αt
2α + |f(z)|
2
.
It is easy to see that ϕ(t, z) is defined and continuous on [0, 1) × {z ∈ C
n :
|z| ≤ 1/j}. The continuous function (1 + |f(z)|
2
)f
]
(z) attains a maximum
as z varies over the compact ball {z ∈ C
n : |z| ≤ 2/3}. Then there exists a
constant M > 0 such that
ϕ(t, z) ≤ (1 − j|z|)
1−α
t
1−αM (z ∈ B(0, 2/3)). (3.1)
It follows that ϕ(t, z) is continuous on [0, 1] × {z ∈ C
n : |z| ≤ 1/j} and
ϕ(0, z) = 0 on {z ∈ C
n : |z| ≤ 1/j}, j > 3.
By Weierstrass’s theorem there exists z
∗
1
, |z
∗
1
| < 1/j such that
ϕ(1, z∗
1
) = max
|z|≤1/j
ϕ(1, z) > 1.
Since ϕ(0, z∗
1
) = 0 and ϕ(1, z∗
1
) > 1, by the intermediate value theorem
for continuous functions on [0, 1], there exists ρ1, 0 < ρ1 < 1, such that
ϕ(ρ1, z∗
1
) = 1. We are done if max|z|≤1/j ϕ(ρ1, z) = ϕ(ρ1, z∗
1
) = 1; if not, then
max|z|≤1/j ϕ(ρ1, z) > 1 and we repeats our discourse for ϕ(ρ1, z).
Again, by Weierstrass’s theorem there exists z
∗
2
, |z
∗
2
| < 1/j such that
ϕ(ρ1, z∗
2
) = max
|z|≤1/j
ϕ(ρ1, z) > 1.
Since ϕ(0, z∗
2
) = 0 and ϕ(ρ1, z∗
2
) > 1, by the intermediate value theorem
for continuous functions on [0, 1] there exists ρ2, 0 < ρ2 < 1, such that
ϕ(ρ1ρ2, z∗
2
) = 1. We are done if max|z|≤1/j ϕ(ρ1ρ2, z) = ϕ(ρ1ρ2, z∗
2
) = 1; if
not, then we repeats our discourse for ϕ(ρ1ρ2, z) again, and so on.64 Normal Families in C

If we stop after a finite number of steps, we are done; if not, we repeat this
process, ad infinitum, to obtain points ρm, 0 < ρm < 1, and z
∗
m, |z
∗
m| < 1/j,
such that
max
|z|≤1/j
ϕ(ρ1 . . . ρm, z) = ϕ(ρ1 . . . ρm, z∗
m) > 1 . (3.2)
ϕ(ρ1 . . . ρmρm+1, z∗
m) = 1 . (3.3)
The sequence {xm := ρ1 . . . ρm} is a bounded and decreasing. Then the great￾est lower bound of the set {xm : m ∈ N}, say ρ, is the limit of {xm}. The
sequence {z
∗
m} contains a subsequence, again denoted by {z
∗
m}, such that
limm→∞ z
∗
m = ξ
∗
. From (3.2) follows that 0 < ρ < 1 and |ξ
∗
| < 1/j. (This
follows at once from Weierstrass’s theorem that every bounded sequence has
a convergent subsequence.)
From (3.2) and (3.3), we have
lim m→∞
max
|z|≤1/j
ϕ(ρ1 . . . ρm, z) = lim m→∞
ϕ(ρ1 . . . ρm, z∗
m) =
lim m→∞
ϕ(ρ1 . . . ρmρm+1, z∗
m) = ϕ(ρ, ξ∗
) = 1 .
(3.4)
We claim that
max
|z|≤1/j
lim m→∞
ϕ(ρ1 . . . ρm, z) = lim m→∞
max
|z|≤1/j
ϕ(ρ1 . . . ρm, z). (3.5)
By Weierstrass’s theorem
max
|z|≤1/j
lim m→∞
ϕ(ρ1 . . . ρm, z) = max
|z|≤1/j
ϕ(ρ, z) = ϕ(ρ, η),
where |η| ≤ 1/j.
There is a sequence {wm} contained in {|z| ≤ 1/j} such that
ϕ(ρ1 . . . ρm, η) ≤ max
|z|≤1/j
ϕ(ρ1 . . . ρm, z) = ϕ(ρ1 . . . ρm, wm).
Since {|z| ≤ 1/j} is compact, there is an infinite subsequence of {wm}, again
denoted by {wm}, and ς, |ς| ≤ 1/j such that wm → ς as m → ∞. Therefore
lim m→∞
ϕ(ρ1 . . . ρm, η) ≤ lim m→∞
max
|z|≤1/j
ϕ(ρ1 . . . ρm, z) = lim m→∞
ϕ(ρ1 . . . ρm, wm)
and
ϕ(ρ, η) ≤ lim m→∞
max
|z|≤1/j
ϕ(ρ1 . . . ρm, z) = ϕ(ρ, ς) ≤ ϕ(ρ, η).
We may conclude the desired claim (3.4). Combining (3.4) and (3.5), we have
max
|z|≤1/j
ϕ(ρ, z) = ϕ(ρ, ξ∗
) = 1 (|ξ
∗
| < 1/j).
This is the desired equality. The proof of the lemma is complete.Zalcman-Pang’s Lemma 65
Proof of Theorem 3.13.1. Assume F is not normal in point z0 ∈ Ω. To sim￾plify matters, we assume that z0 = 0 and all functions under consideration are

For every m ∈ N the sequence {hj}j>m is normal in |z| < m by Marty’s

By similar arguments as those used to prove Theorem 3.13.1 we can obtain
the following:
Theorem 3.13.4. Let F be a family of zero-free holomorphic functions in a
domain Ω ⊂ C
n. The statement of Theorem 3.13.1 remains valid if 0 ≤ α < 1
is replaced with −∞ < α < ∞.68 Normal Families in C
n
Proof of Theorem 3.13.4. Assume F is not normal at the point z0 ∈ Ω. To
simplify matters we assume that z0 = 0 and all functions under consideration
are holomorphic on the unit ball {z ∈ C
n : |z| < 1}. The notations used below
are those in the proof of Lemma 3.13.3 and Theorem 3.13.1.
First we restrict our attention to the case where 0 ≤ α < ∞. The case
0 ≤ α < 1 is proved in Theorem 3.13.1. The proof of the case where 1 ≤ α < ∞
is, mutatis mutandis, the same as that of Theorem 3.13.1.
In fact, since f is zero-free we have
ϕ(ρ, z) ≤
(1 − j|z|)
1+αρ
1+α(1 + |f(z)|
2
)f

|f(z)|

.
The continuous function (1 + |f(z)|
2
)f
]
(z)/|f(z)|
2 attains a maximum as z
varies over the compact ball B(0, 2/3). Then there exists a constant M > 0
such that
ϕ(ρ, z) ≤ (1 − j|z|)
1+α
ρ
1+αM (z ∈ B(0, 2/3)).
It follows that ϕ(ρ, z) is continuous on [0, 1] × {z ∈ C
n : |z| ≤ 1/j} and
ϕ(0, z) = 0 on {z ∈ C
n : |z| ≤ 1/j}, j > 3.
The same kind of argument as in the proof of Lemma 3.13.3 yields that
the statement of Lemma 3.13.3 remains valid if f is zero-free and 0 ≤ α < 1
is replaced with 1 ≤ α < ∞. The rest of the proof of the theorem is the same
as in Theorem 3.13.1. The case 0 ≤ α < ∞ is proved. Thus we have proved
the first part of the theorem.
It remains to consider the case −∞ < α < 0. Since a family {1/f, f ∈ F }
conforms to the hypotheses of Theorem 3.13.4, the earlier argument shows
that there exist sequences 1/fj , zj → z0, rj → 0, such that the sequence
gj (z) := 1

fj (zj + rj z)
(0 ≤ α < ∞ arbitrary)
converges locally uniformly in C

(z) ≤ g
]
(0) = 1. By Hurwitz’s theorem either g ≡ 0 or g never vanishes.
Since g
]
(0) = 1, it is easy to see that if g never vanishes, then 1/g is an entire
function in C
n. It follows r
αfj → 1/g uniformly in C
n.
Since Levi form vanishes for any pluriharmonic function,
Lz(log(1 + |1/g|

), v) =
Lz(log(1 + |g|
2

Lz(log(1 + |g|

Therefore
g

(0) = 1, hence

The theorem now follows from the observation that the above means that for
all −∞ < α < 0, the sequence fj (zj + rj z)/rα
j
converges locally uniformly in
C

The proof of the other implication is similar to that of Theorem 3.13.1, so
we omit the details.4
Normal Functions in C
n
Prologue: In the papers [288] and [226], Yosida and Noshiro introduce the
notion of normal function (although they do not use that terminology). This
name was given to these functions much later in another pioneering paper in
this vein [164]. In that article Lehto and Virtanen show that the notion of a
normal meromorphic function is closely related to some of the most important
problems of the boundary behavior of meromorphic functions.
After the appearance of the paper [164], one of the main directions of re￾search was simply to test various properties of bounded holomorphic functions
in order to establish the same properties for normal functions, or to construct
examples of normal functions that do not have this property.
The most important work related to normal functions was published by
MacLane [181], who considered the general question of the asymptotic values
of holomorphic functions. It should be noted here that there is a natural
division in the study of normal functions into normal meromorphic functions
(which may not have asymptotic values) and normal holomorphic functions;
the study of the latter is more fruitful, since a holomorphic function always
has at least one asymptotic value.
Normal functions of several complex variables and their boundary behavior
began to be studied in the papers [61], [67], and [58]. Dovbush defined normal
functions in these articles in terms of the Bergman or Carathéodory metrics.
The Kobayashi metric is more convenient and the right definition of a normal
function in several variables. That these ideas can be generalized to complex
spaces was developed in another pioneering paper in this vein [47]. However,
for the case of strictly pseudoconvex domains, which Dovbush was interested
in, the Bergman, Carathéodory and Kobayashi metrics are “equivalent” in the
sense that the space of normal functions defined in terms of any of these three
metrics is the same.
After the appearance of the paper of Cima and Krantz [47], there were a
large number of works on this subject and a new rubric in the Mathematics
Subject Classification System -MSC2010 appeared: “32A19—Bloch functions,
normal functions of several complex variables”.

4.1 Definitions and Preliminaries
In Chapter 3, all the results were proved in standard n-dimensional complex
Euclidean space C
n, but in essence its complex structure was not used in the
proofs. Nevertheless, for the study of holomorphic functions, we need those
objects which are intrinsically related to the domain in question and which
reflect more intimately the complex structure of C
n.
We begin with the intrinsic metrics on domains in C
n. Here we present the
basic definitions and some well-known facts. It is intended that this material
be used mainly for reference.
By a domain we mean a connected open subset Ω of C
n. We denote by
D(Ω) (resp. Bn(Ω)) the family of holomorphic maps from Ω into the unit disk
D (resp. the unit ball Bn in C
n) and by Ω(D) (resp. Ω(Bn)) the family of
holomorphic maps from D (resp. Bn) into Ω. Furthermore, T(Ω) = {(z, v) ∈
Ω × C
n} means the holomorphic tangent bundle on Ω.
The infinitesimal metric
dsD(z, v) := |v|
1 − |z|
2
is called the Poincaré metric on D.
The Poincaré metric on a disk in the complex plane has the important
property that holomorphic maps from the disk to itself are distance decreasing
in this metric by the Schwarz-Pick Lemma.
Definition 4.1.1. The infinitesimal Carathéodory metric on Ω is the function
CΩ : T(Ω) → R
+ ∪ {0}, defined by [244]
F
C
Ω (z, v) := sup {|f∗(v)| : f ∈ O(Ω, D), f(z) = 0}
where f∗ = df is the differential of f at z.
(The condition f(z) = 0 is superfluous [244].) The Carathéodory distance
is defined by [40]
CΩ(z, w) := sup
f∈D(Ω)
ρ(f(z), f(w)), z, w ∈ Ω,
where ρ is the Poincaré distance in the unit disk; for points z, w ∈ D it is
equal to
ρ(z, w) := ln |1 − wz| + |z − w|
|1 − wz| − |z − w|
,
It was shown by Reiffen [244] that if γ : [0, 1] → Ω is a C
1
curve in Ω with
Carathéodory length defined by

then
LC (γ) = Z 1

F
C
Ω (γ(t), γ0
(t))dt.
This infinitesimal metric was first investigated in depth by Reiffen [244], who
showed that it gives the same length for arcs as the Carathéodory metric, and
is thus the inner metric corresponding to the Carathéodory metric. Set
C

Ω (γ(t), γ0

where the infimum is taken over all smooth paths γ : [0, 1] → Ω connecting z
to w. This metric, which is properly called the Carathéodory-Reiffen metric,
is, in its integrated form, equivalent to the Carathéodory metric. Since it is
the inner metric derived from the Carathéodory metric, it is always at least as
large as the Carathéodory metric, but it is actually larger in many cases. The
Carathéodory-Reiffen metric is also non-increasing under holomorphic maps,
both in its integrated and in its differential form.
Although Carathéodory states in one of his papers that he is not sure how
useful his metric will be in the future study of functions of several complex
variables, it has found numerous applications both by him and by Cartan.
Kobayashi [132, 136], however, introduced a new metric for complex man￾ifolds which has proved even more useful. In 1971 Royden [254] gave the
following infinitesimal definition of the Kobayashi metric.
Definition 4.1.2. The infinitesimal Kobayashi metric on Ω is the function

F
K
Ω (z, v) :=

Obviously F
K
Ω (z, v) ≥ 0 and F
K
Ω (z, cv) = |c|F
K
Ω (z, v) for all complex num￾bers c. The following Schwarz-Pick property is also an immediate consequence
of the definition (see [253] or [224, Theorem 1.2.6, p. 6]).
Proposition 4.1.3. Let Ωj , j = 1, 2, be bounded domains in C
n. If f ∈
O(Ω1, Ω2), then
F
K
Ω2
(f(z), f∗(x)v) ≤ F
K
Ω1
(z, v) for all (z, v) ∈ Ω1 × C

.
In particular, if f is biholomorphic, then F
K
Ω2
(f(x), f∗(z)v) = F
K
Ω1
(z, v).
Corollary 4.1.4. We have that kD(w, z) = |z|
1−|w|
2 for all (w, z) in D × C.
Proof. Now we prove the proposition. Take any v ∈ C
n. Let h : D(r) → Ω1
be a holomorphic mapping such that h(0) = z and h
0
(0) = v. Then f ◦ h :
D(r) → Ω2 is a holomorphic mapping such that (f ◦ h)
0
(0) = f∗(v). Hence,Definitions and Preliminaries 73

(f(z), f∗(v)) ≤ 1/α. Since h is arbitrary, we have FΩ2

obtain

using (4.1), and Corollary 4.1.4. These observations verify the well known
fact that the functions F
C
D and F
K
D are respectively the infinitesimal Poincarè
metric on D.
Remark 4.1.5. In general, given z ∈ Ω and v ∈ C
n, there is not a holomorphic
map ϕ : D → Ω such that FK(z, v) = |v| / |ϕ
0
(0)| (see [143]). When there
exists one, it may not be unique (see [143]). Lempert has shown that when Ω
is strongly convex (all principal curvatures of the boundary positive) then the
extremal function will exist and be unique (see [170]).
Royden’s definition has its classical source in the Schottky-Landau theo￾rem, according to which for any holomorphic map f of the disk Dr = {|z| < r}
into to the Riemann sphere Cb with three points a, b, c removed, with f
0
(0) 6= 0,
the radius r is bounded, from below by a constant depending only on a, b, c
and the values of f(0), f
0
(0).
In [254] Royden proved that F
K
Ω has the contraction property under holo￾morphic maps: if ϕ : Ω → Ω
0
is a holomorphic map then for each v ∈ C

K
Ω0 (ϕ(z), ϕ∗v) ≤ F

The Kobayashi distance is defined as follows [134, Chapter 3, p. 50]: Let
z, w ∈ Ω. Consider all finite sequences of points z = p0, p1, . . . , pk−1, pk = w
of Ω such that there exist points z1, . . . , zk, w1, . . . , wk of D and mappings
f1, . . . , fk ∈ Ω(D) satisfying f(zi) = pi−1 and f(wi) = pi
, i = 1, . . . , k. Set
KΩ(z, w) := inf X
k
i=1
ρ(zi
, wi)
where the infimum is taken over all choices of points and mappings74 Normal Functions in C
n
Royden [254] showed that KΩ is actually the integrated form of FK. That
is, given z, w ∈ Ω,
KΩ(z, w) := inf
γ
Z 1
0
F
K
Ω (γ(t), γ0
(t))dt,
where the infimum is taken over all piecewise differentiable curves γ : [0, 1] →
Ω joining z to w.
Remark 4.1.6. The Carathéodory distance and metric do not satisfy such a
relationship.
Definition 4.1.7. If the Kobayashi metric KΩ is a distance and if the topol￾ogy defined by KΩ is equivalent to the relative topology of Ω in C
n, then the
domain Ω is said to be hyperbolic.
By Theorem IV.2.2 [76], any bounded domain in C
n is hyperbolic. In C
n,
the fact that KΩ is a distance suffices to ensure that Ω is hyperbolic [76,
Proposition IV.2.3].
A variant of the definition of hyperbolicity is given in Kobayashi’s
book [134, Chapter 3, Section 2, p. 60].
It is known that the Carathéodory metric is the smallest of the class of met￾rics which generalize the Schwarz lemma and that the new metric of Kobayashi
is the largest. These metrics are particularly useful in the hyperbolic case, that
is, when they are actually metrics rather than pseudometrics. The advantage
of the Kobayashi metric lies in that, being larger, it will be an actual metric
for some manifolds on which the Carathéodory metric is only a pseudometric.
The classical infinitesimal metric of Carathéodory and infinitesimal metric
of Kobayashi share two basic properties:
(1) they agree with the Poincare metric on the unit disk;
(2) they are contractible with respect to holomorphic mappings.
Among the metrics with these two properties, the infinitesimal Caratheodory
metric is the smallest and the infinitesimal Kobayashi metric is the largest.
Let us also remark that F
C
Ω is continuous on the tangent bundle T(Ω) = C
n
and F
K
Ω is upper semicontinuous on T(Ω) see [254].
The notation FΩ without a superscript C or K refers to either metric unless
specified otherwise; also we shall usually drop the notational dependence on
Ω unless there are different domains involved.
The metric F is biholomorphically invariant which follows immediately
from the following theorem.
Theorem 4.1.8 (Schwarz lemma). Let Ω1, Ω2 be bounded domains in C
n
and let F1, F2 both be one of the above metrics on Ω1, Ω2 respectively—as
defined above. Suppose that f : Ω1 → Ω2 is a holomorphic map. Then one has
f
∗
(F2) ≤ F1Definitions and Preliminaries 75
For a proof, the reader is referred to Kobayashi [134].
Remark 4.1.9. If Ω is bounded, then there exists a positive constant R such
that Ω ⊂ BR = {z ∈ C
n, |z| < R}. By the Schwarz lemma (Theorem 4.1.8),
FΩ(z, v) ≥ FBR (z, v) for all (z, v) ∈ Ω × C
n
.
Since
FBR (z, v) = [(R2 − |z|
2
)|v|
2 + |(z, v)|
2
]
1/2
R2 − |z|

≥ |v|/R ,
we have
FΩ(z, v) ≥ |v|/R for all (z, v) ∈ Ω × C
n
. (4.3)
In function theory of several variables, the Bergman metric has played an
important role as a canonically defined invariant metric. It is also a Kähler
metric. Let Ω be a bounded domain in C
n with coordinate system z1, . . . , zn.
The set H(Ω) ol all holomorphic functions on Ω which are square integrable
forms a separable complex Hilbert space. Let h0, h1, h2, . . . be a complete
orthonormal basis for H(Ω). Then
B(z, w) := X∞
j=0
hj (z)hj (w)
is a holomorphic function in z and w, or a holomorphic function on Ω × Ω,
where Ω is the domain conjugate to Ω, and is called the kernel function of
Bergman. Define
BΩ(z, v) := Xn
k,l=1
∂
2
log B(z, z)
∂zk∂zl
vkvl
.
This form does not depend on the choice of the coordinates in C
n. It defines
an Hermitean and, even more, a Kählerian metric on Ω—called the Bergman
metric. Let us also remark that BΩ is continuous on the tangent bundle T(Ω).
For more details, see [133].
We take
F
B
Ω (z, v) = (BΩ(z, v))1/2
in the notation of [52].
Remark 4.1.10. It is easy to see that the Bergman metric is invariant under
biholomorphic maps of Ω, but it does not enjoy the contraction property for
holomorphic maps. Moreover, it turns out that the Bergman pseudometric is
not monotone with respect to inclusions (cf. [25]).
Remark 4.1.11. Let Ω be a bounded domain in C
n. Then the matrix
T(z, z) := 
∂
2
log B(z, z)
∂zk∂zl
!
k,l=1,...,n76 Normal Functions in C

determines an invariant Hermitian metric on Ω. If f = (f1, . . . , fn) : Ω →
C
n is holomorphic and bounded by a constant M (i.e., ff ≤ M2
), then
C. H. Look [177, 178] proved in 1957 that
∂f
∂z
∂f
∂z
≤ M2T(z, z). (4.4)
When f = (f1, 0, . . . , 0) and M = 1, the above inequality obviously implies

|df1| ≤ F

where the lefthand side is exactly the infinitesimal Carathéodory metric de￾fined eight years later by Reiffen [244]. Twenty years later Hahn [106] repro￾duced the proof of (4.4) and noted that the infinitesimal Carathéodory metric
is not greater than the Bergman metric.
In the class of all pseudodifferential metrics on complex manifolds satisfy￾ing the Schwarz Lemma with respect to holomorphic mappings and agreeing
with the Poincaré metric on the unit disk, the Caratheodory metric is known
to be the smallest and the Kobayashi metric is the largest. The Bergman met￾ric does not belong to this class, since it does not satisfy the required Schwarz
Lemma. Nevertheless, as shown in [104, 177, 178], on bounded domains in C
n
(and even on more general complex manifolds) the Bergman metric is always
larger than the Caratheodory metric.
It is known that the boundary behavior of the Bergrnan metric FB and
the Kobayashi metric FK on a strictly pseudo-convex domains Ω ⊂ C
n is the
same [52, 85]. As a consequence there exists a constant cΩ > 0 which might
depend on Ω, such that
FB(z, v) < cΩF
K(z, v) (4.6)
for all z ∈ Ω, v ∈ C
n.
Nevertheless, one has in contrast to this situation the following
Theorem 4.1.12 (Diederich and Fornaess, see [53, Theorem p. 257]). There
exists a pseudoconvex domain Ω ⊂ C
3 with smooth C∞ boundary such that
the quotient
Φ(z, v) := FB(z, v)/F K(z, v)
is unbounded from above on Ω × C
3
.
For the needed details on the Bergman metric we refer the reader to
Bergman [24] or [145]. All relevant properties of the Kobayashi metric are
contained in Kobayashi [134].
4.1.1 Homogeneous domains.
Let Ω be a general domain in C
n. If Ω
0
is another domain and g : Ω → Ω
0
is a holomorphic mapping with holomorphic inverse, then we say that g is
an isomorphism. If Ω = Ω0
, g is called an automorphism of Ω. The set ofDefinitions and Preliminaries 77
all automorphisms of Ω is a group under composition of mappings and we
denote it by Aut(Ω) (which sometimes, indeed generically, consists only of the
identity element).
The domain Ω is said to be homogeneous if Aut(Ω) acts transitively on Ω;
i.e., there exists for any pair of points z1, z2 ∈ Ω an automorphism g ∈ Aut(Ω)
such that g(zl) = z2.
It follows that the unit disk D ⊂ C is a homogeneous domain. By Rie￾mann’s famous theorem, every proper simply connected domain Ω in C (i.e.
Ω is a holomorphically simply connected open set in C that is not equal to all
of C) is biholomorphically equivalent to D; i.e., there are h ∈ Hol(D, Ω) and
g ∈ Hol(Ω, D) such that
h(D) = Ω , g(Ω) = D , h ◦ g = idΩ , g ◦ h = idD .
Hence for every proper, simply connected domain Ω ⊂ C, we can describe
explicitly the qroup Aut(Ω) by the formula
Aut(Ω) = 
h ◦ m ◦ h
−1
: m ∈ Aut(D)
	
.
Let us recall that the mapping h can be expressed in terms of the Green’s
function of the domain Ω. In particular, each proper simply connected domain
of C is homogeneous.
If Ω is bounded, or isomorphic with a bounded domain, then Ω has an
invariant Hermitian metric, the Bergman metric.
In tracing the history of the classification theory of homogeneous bounded
domains in C
n, one must mention the pioneering work by H. Poincaré [237].
In 1907, he proved that the ball {|z1|
2 + |z2|
2 < 1} and the polidisk {|z1|
2 <
1, |z2|
2 < 1} in C
2 are not holomorphically equivalent to each other, but they
are both connected and simply connected. One sometimes adds the misleading
comment that there is no Riemann mapping theorem in several variables. We
next describe two positive mapping theorems. It is not hard to see that the only
plane domains Ω =6 C for which the automorphism group is transitive are those
biholomorphic to the disk. Bun Wong [286] showed that the corresponding
statement is true for strictly pseudoconvex domains in C
n, n > 1. Later,
Rosay [250] generalized it to the following statement.
Theorem 4.1.13. Let Ω ⊂ C
n be an open set with C
2
boundary. If Ω has a
transitive automorphism group, then Ω is biholomorphic to the ball.
It should be remarked that bounded homogeneous domains are always
(without any assumptions on the boundary) domains of holomorphy, i.e. pseu￾doconvex (see, [133, Theorem 6.3, p. 280]). There are, of course, many such
domains without smooth boundary.
H. Cartan gave a complete classification of homogeneous bounded domains
in C
2 and C
3
, which was published in É. Cartan’s paper [41]. Cartan found all
the bounded homogeneous domains in the spaces C
2 and C
3
. It was shown that
in the space C
2 any bounded homogeneous domain can be biholomorphically78 Normal Functions in C
n
mapped either onto the ball {|z1|
2 + |z2|
2 < 1} or onto the polydisk {|z1|
2 <
1, |z2|
2 < 1}.
In the space C
3 any bounded homogeneous domain can be biholomorphi￾cally mapped onto one of the following domains:
(1) the ball 
z ∈ C
3
: |z1|
2 + |z2|
2 + |z3|
2 < 1
	
;
(2) the domain 
z ∈ C
3
: |z1|
2 + |z2|
2 < 1, |z3|
2 < 1
	
;
(3) the polydisk 
z ∈ C
3
: |z1|
2 < 1, |z2|
2 < 1, |z3|
2 < 1
	
;
(4) a bounded domain which is obtained by a biholomorphic mapping
from the domain n
y3 >
p
|y1|
2 + |y2|
2
o
. (Here, as usual, zk = xk +
ıyk, k = 1, 2, 3.)
One can show that all of the above-mentioned domains are not only ho￾mogeneous, but also symmetric. (A domain is called symmetric if the group
Aut(Ω) acts transitively on Ω and if there exists an automorphism with a
single fixed point in Ω whose square is the identity map).
In this connection E. Cartan [41] raised the problem: does there exist in the
space C
n for n ≥ 4 a bounded homogeneous nonsymmetric domain? An answer
to this problem was given by I. I. Pjateckii-Shapiro, who, in his paper [236]
published in 1959, constructed the first example of a bounded homogeneous
nonsymmetric domain. It was shown that similar domains exist in the space
C
n of all dimensions, beginning with the fourth. Moreover, in every one of the
spaces C
4
, C
5
, C
6
there appears a finite set of biholomorphically inequivalent
homogeneous bounded nonsymmetric domains, but already in the space C
7
,
the set of such domains attains a continuous cardinality. On the other hand,
the set of bounded symmetric domains is finite for any space.
Bounded complex homogeneous domains are of great interest from many
points of view. This arises from the fact that they form a comparatively broad
class of domains in C
n, for which it has been possible to obtain a whole series
of interesting essentially-many-dimensional results.
Having got a good many of the basic definitions under control, we are ready
to examine the concept of normal function in some detail. In the next section
we shall study holomorphic normal functions in several complex variables.
In several complex variables there is not a single standard region like D
in which to consider biholomorphic mappings. Cartan also pointed out that
some classical results of univalent function theory do not have analogs in
several complex variables.
4.2 Normal Functions in C
n
Much of the one dimensional theory of normal meromorphic functions is in￾spired by the classical theory of conformal mappings, a very special case.Normal Functions in C
n 79
The concept of normal functions was introduced by Noshiro [226] following
from earlier related work of Yosida [288]. His definition reads as follows: a
meromorphic function f : D → C is said to be normal if {f ◦ g : g ∈ Aut(D)}
is a normal family. Noshiro’s definition was restricted to the unit disk and was
later extended by Lehto and Virtanen in their seminal paper of 1957 [164].
The Riemann mapping theorem asserts that every simply connected do￾main Ω ⊂ C with Ω =6 C admits a unique conformal mapping f onto the unit
disk D with the properties f(ζ) = 0 and f
0
(ζ) > 0 for an arbitrarily prescribed
point ζ ∈ Ω. Because the inverse function is necessarily analytic, it is equiv￾alent to say that D can be mapped conformally onto Ω. The Carathéodory
extension theorem says (in a special case) that each conformal mapping of a
Jordan domain Ω onto the Jordan domain D can be extended to a homeomor￾phism of Ω onto D. The modern proof of Riemann’s theorem is based on the
theory of normal families. A full discussion and proof of Riemann’s theorem
was given in Section 3.7.
Lehto and Virtanen have introduced the following definition: A meromor￾phic function f(z) is called normal in a simply connected domain D, if the
family {f(S(z))} is normal, where z
0 = S(z) denotes an arbitrary conformal
mapping of D onto itself1
.
Normal functions have been studied by many authors; there is now a large
volume of literature on the subject (see [33] for a survey of twenty-two char￾acterization of normal functions). The survey article by A. J. Lohwater’s [180]
may be consulted for further summary accounts of the subject up to 1973.
One can naturally introduce the definition of normal holomorphic functions
in bounded homogeneous domains in C
n which is analogous to the definition
of normal function given by Noshiro [226] for the unit disk.
Definition 4.2.1. Let D be a homogeneous bounded domain in C
n. We say
that a holomorphic function f : D → C is normal if the family
F = {f ◦ g : g ∈ Aut(D)}
is normal, where Aut(D) denotes the holomorphic automorphism group of D.
Remark 4.2.2. If f(z) ∈ O(D) omits two values, then the family F also omits
these values. By Montel’s normality criterion (Theorem 3.5.2) F is normal.
Now, from Definition 4.2.1 we see that f(z) is normal. Therefore bounded
holomorphic functions are normal.
The hypotheses imposed on f ◦ g for all g ∈ Aut(D) will lead to notable
conclusions about f.
An important result of Noshiro [226, Theorem 1, p. 150] character￾izes normal functions in terms of the spherical derivative (see also Lehto￾Virtanen [164]).
1
In the case of the unit disk, Noshiro [226] said such a function belongs to the class (A)
(instead of normal function) and obtained some interesting results.80 Normal Functions in C
n
Theorem 4.2.3. A meromorphic function f(z) in the unit disk D ⊂ C is
normal if and only if
sup
z∈D
(1 − |z|
2
)f
]
(z) < ∞, (4.1)
where f
]
(z) is the spherical derivative.
That is, f is normal if there exists a constant C > 0 such that
|f
0
(z)|
1 + |f(z)|
2 < C 1
1 − |z|
2
(4.2)
for all z ∈ D.
Theorem 4.2.3 is a central result in the geometric theory of normal mero￾morphic functions, with important applications.
Remark 4.2.4. From the proof (see [225, Theorem 7, p. 87]), it is easily seen
that a nonconstant function, meromorphic in |z| < 1, is normal if and only if
{f(S(0))} is bounded for all S.
Normal meromorphic functions admit the following characterization in
terms of the spherical derivative: A nonconstant meromorphic f(z) is nor￾mal in a domain Ω ⊂ C, which then necessarily is of hyperbolic type, if and
only if there exists a finite constant C so that
|f
0
(z)| |dz|
1 + |f(z)|
2 < Cdσ(z)
where dσ(z) denotes the element of length in the hyperbolic metric of Ω
(see [164, p. 47]).
As a direct application of the Marty normality criterion (Theorem 3.4), we
obtain that Theorem 4.2.3 can be extended to bounded homogeneous domains
in C
n:
Theorem 4.2.5. Let D be a bounded homogeneous domain in C
n. Let F be
either the infinitesimal Carathéodory, Kobayashi, or Bergman metrics on D.
A holomorphic function f : D → C is normal if and only if there exists a
constant C such that
Lz(log(1 + |f|
2
), v) ≤ C(F(z, v))2
(4.3)
for all z ∈ D and all v ∈ C
n.
Proof. Suppose that f is normal in D (i.e. the family
F = {f ◦ g : g ∈ Aut(D)}
is normal). Let z0 ∈ D be a fixed point. Of course the singleton {z0} is
compact. By Marty’s criterion (Theorem 3.2.5) for the compact subset {z0} ⊂
D there exists a constant C(z0) such that
Lz0
(log(1 + |f ◦ ϕ|
2
), v) ≤ C(z0)|v|
2
(4.4)Normal Functions in C
n 81
for all ϕ ∈ Aut(D) and all v ∈ C
n. From the above inequality, taking into
account (4.3) and (4.5), we obtain
Lz0
(log(1 + |f ◦ ϕ|
2
), v) ≤ C(z0)R
2
(F(z0, v))2
(4.5)
for all ϕ ∈ Aut(D) and all v ∈ C
n.
Since the Levi form is invariant relative to biholomorphic mappings, we
have
Lz0
(log(1 + |f ◦ ϕ|
2
), v) = Lϕ(z0)(log(1 + |f|
2
), ϕ∗v), (4.6)
where ϕ∗ = dϕ is the differential of the mapping ϕ at z0. Now (4.5) and (4.6)
together give
Lϕ(z0)(log(1 + |f|
2
), ϕ∗v) ≤ C(z0)R
2
(F(z0, v))2
. (4.7)
Since Aut(D) is transitive on D and
F(z0, v) = F(ϕ(z0), ϕ∗v),
when this is substituted in (4.7) we obtain (4.3) with C = C(z0)R2
.
Conversely, suppose that (4.3) holds. Then, since the Levi form is invariant
relative to biholomorphic mappings, we have
Lz(log(1 + |f ◦ ϕ|
2
), v) ≤ C(F(ϕ(z), ϕ∗v))2
(4.8)
for all ϕ ∈ Aut(D) and all (z, v) ∈ Ω×C
n. The function F(z, v)/|v| is at least
upper semicontinuous on Ω × C
n \ {0} and therefore assumes its maximum,
say M(K), on any compact subset K × {|v| = 1 : v ∈ C
n} ⊂ Ω × {C
n \ {0}}.
Hence one obtains from (4.8)
Lz(log(1 + |f ◦ ϕ|
2
), v) ≤ C · M(K)|v|
2
(4.9)
for all ϕ ∈ Aut(D) and all (z, v) ∈ K × C
n. It follows from Marty’s normality
criterion (Theorem 3.2.5) that F = {f ◦ g : g ∈ Aut(D)} is normal, and so,
by Definition 4.2.1, f is normal. The proof is complete.
Remark 4.2.6. Later, in a refined form, this theorem appeared in Funa￾hashi [81, Theorem 1, p. 80], Hahn [99, 2.7 Lemma, p. 721], [101, Theorem 1,
p. 113].
As function theory on two biholomorphic domains is the same, one of the
main questions in complex analysis is to classify domains up to biholomorphic
equivalence. In one variable, there is the rather striking theorem due to Rie￾mann: If U ⊂ C is a nonempty simply connected domain such that U 6= C,
then U is biholomorphic to D.
In one variable, a topological property on U is enough to classify a whole
class of domains. It is one of the reasons why studying the disk is so important
in one variable and why many theorems are stated for the disk only.82 Normal Functions in C
n
There is simply no such theorem in several complex variables. The unit
ball and the polydisk are not biholomorphically equivalent
(see H. Poincaré [237]). Both are simply connected (have no holes), and they
are the two most obvious generalizations of the disk to several variables. They
are homeomorphic, that is to say, topology does not see any difference between
them.
This motivates the following definition. We want a definition that in￾cludes the classical definition of normal function and also applies to arbitrary
bounded domain in C
n.
In view of Theorem 4.2.5 the definition of normal function is extended in
the obvious way to arbitrary domain in C
n.
Definition 4.2.7. Let Ω be a bounded domain in C
n and let F be either the
infinitesimal Carathéodory, Kobayashi, or Bergman metrics on Ω. A holomor￾phic function f : Ω → C [one writes f ∈ O(Ω)] is called normal if there exists
a positive constant C such that
Lz(log(1 + |f|
2
), v) ≤ C · (F(z, v))2
(4.10)
for all (z, v) ∈ Ω × C
n.
Definition 4.2.8. We call f ∈ O(Ω) a C-normal (respectively K-normal and
B-normal) function on Ω ⊂ C
n if in Definition 4.2.7 F = F
C
Ω (respectively
F = F
K
Ω and F = F
B
Ω ).
However, for the case of strongly pseudoconvex domains the Bergman,
Kobayashi, and Caratheodory metrics are “equivalent” in the sense that nor￾mal functions defined in terms of either of the three metrics are the same.
This assertion follows from well-known estimates on the asymptotic behavior
of these metrics (see [74], [84]).
In the case of strongly pseudoconvex domains Ω ⊂ C
n, we will shorten the
above terminology and say simply that f is in class N , or equivalently f is a
normal function in Ω.
Denote by N C (Ω) (respectively NK(Ω) and N B(Ω)) a class of all C-normal
(respectively K-normal and B-normal) functions in a domain Ω ⊂ C
n.
Since F

Ω ≤ F
K
Ω and F
C
Ω ≤ F
B
Ω from this we obtain the inclusions
N
C (Ω) ⊆ N
K(Ω) and N
C (Ω) ⊆ N
B(Ω).
Remark 4.2.9. Suppose that f is a holomorphic function from Ω to C such
that C \ f(Ω) contains two points a1 and a2. Then f is K-normal. First, the
distance decreasing property of the Kobayashi metric yields
F
K
C\{a1,a2}
(f(z), f0
(z) · ξ) ≤ F
K
Ω (z, ξ) for all z ∈ Ω and all ξ ∈ C

.
Further, making use of the homogeneity and the continuity of F
K
C\{a1,a2}
and the spherical metric as well as the fact that
|1|sph,z/F K
C\{a1,a2}
(z, 1) → 0 as z → aj , j = 1, 2.Normal Functions in C
n 83
one readily finds a constant C such that
|η|sph,z ≤ C · F
K
C\{a1,a2}
(z, η) for all z ∈ C \ {a1, a2} and all η ∈ C. (4.11)
Combining (4.10) and (4.11) gives the assertion. The above proof is taken
from [119].
Another deduction of this result is given in [47, p. 308].
Let G denote the family of all functions holomorphic on D which omit the
values 0 and 1. According to Montel’s theorem [292, p. 218], the family G is
normal. Marty’s theorem [187] yields a non-negative constant L such that, for
any g ∈ G,
L0(log(1 + |g|
2
), 1) ≤ L .
The constant L in the inequality above does not depend on g ∈ G. The exact
value L is not known.
Hence for ϕ : D → Ω such that ϕ(0) = z and dϕ(0) = αv, α > 0, we have
L0(log(1+|f ◦ϕ|
2
), 1) = Lz(log(1+|f|
2
), dϕ(0)·1) = Lz(log(1+|f|
2
), αv) ≤ L,
It follows that
Lz(log(1 + |f|
2
), v) ≤ Lα−2
.
Since the left-hand side of the above inequality does not depend on α and
F
K
Ω (z, v) = infα


over all maps with the normalization ϕ(0) = z and
dϕ(0) = αv, with α > 0, we conclude that
Lz(log(1 + |f|
2
), v) ≤ L
￾

.
By Definition 4.2.7, f is a K-normal function in Ω. To prove this fact, we have
only to use the idea in the proof of Proposition 1.4 in [47].
Remark 4.2.10. Bloch functions are precisely the holomorphic functions on
D that are globally dσ-to-euclid Lipschitz. Similarly, a meromorphic function
on D is a normal function f that are globally ρ-to-s Lipschitz. Finally, a
meromorphic function on C is a Yosida function if f
]
(z) is uniformly bounded
on C, so Yosida functions are euclid-to-s Lipschitz functions [20, Example 6.1,
p. 345].
Notice that if f ∈ F, F is a normal family in Ω, and z, w ∈ Ω then
s(f(z), f(w)) ≤ C · KΩ(z, w)
as follows from the definition of the integrated distance. It follows that the
family F is uniformly Lipschitz on compact subsets of Ω with respect to the
Euclidean distance and the spherical distance.
Remark 4.2.11. From Definition 4.2.7 and the definitions of the Levi form
and the infinitesimal Carathéodory metric, it is easy to see that a natural
generalization of the class of bounded holomorphic functions is the class of
normal holomorphic functions84 Normal Functions in C
n
Remark 4.2.12. Geometrically, Definition 4.2.7 means that the spherical
derivatives of f(z) in various directions can be estimated in terms of holomor￾phic disks in Ω passing through the point z in these directions. In particular,
in strictly pseudoconvex domains this means that the spherical derivatives
along complex normals grow like O(1/δ(z)) and along complex tangential di￾rections, like O(1/
p
δ(z)). Here and later δ(z) is the Euclidean distance from
the point z to ∂Ω.
Next we prove the equivalence of Definition 4.2.7 with some others.
Remark 4.2.13. In case Ω is a homogeneous domain, Theorem 4.2.5 shows
that Definition 4.2.7 coincides with Definition 4.2.1.
Remark 4.2.14. For the unit disk Theorem 4.2.3 coincides with Noshiro’s clas￾sical theorem. Indeed, the metric FD coincides with the Poincaré metric on
D. A straightforward calculation shows that inequality (4.3) reduces to
(1 − |z|
2
)f
]
(z) ≤ C < ∞
for all z ∈ D. Taking sup on both sides over z ∈ D, we obtain the desired
inequality (4.1).
The following simple result will prove useful in later sections.
Proposition 4.2.15. Let Ω1 ⊆ C
n1
; Ω2 ⊆ C
n2 be domains. Let ϕ : Ω1 → Ω2
be holomorphic. Let f : Ω2 → C be K-normal. Then f ◦ ϕ is K-normal.
Proof. The map ϕ : Ω1 → Ω2 is distance decreasing in the Kobayashi metric.
One obvious question is whether the normality of function remains a hered￾itary property under projections. The answer is yes.
Corollary 4.2.16. Let Ω ⊂ C
n be a domain and let f : Ω → C be K-normal.
Let p ⊆ C
n be a complex linear subspace. Assume that p ∩ Ω ≡ Ωe is linearly
biholomorphic to a domain in some C
k
, k ≤ n. Then f|
Ωe
is K-normal.
Definition 4.2.7 has an obvious analogue for a complex manifold. The
same applies to the infinitesimal Carathéodory and Kobayashi metrics. The
Carathéodory metric is a continuous metric defined on every complex manifold
(sometimes trivial). The distance-decreasing property is the most prominent
of all, in that it produces useful applications. On the other hand, since the
definition of this metric depends on the bounded holomorphic functions, it
is identically zero on any compact complex manifold, or compact complex
manifolds with subsets taken away, when the set (that was removed) happens
to be necessarily a removable singularity set for bounded holomorphic func￾tions. The advantage of the infinitesimal Kobayashi pseudometric lies in that,
being larger, it will be an actual metric for some manifolds on which the in￾finitesimal Carathéodory pseudometric is only a pseudometric. Therefore, in
the definition of normal functions on manifolds, the Kobayashi pseudometric
is used.Normal Functions in C

We first formulate a sufficient condition for the non-normality of a holo￾morphic function.
Lemma 4.2.17. Let f(z) be a holomorphic function in Ω ⊂ C
n, and let {zj}
and {wj} be two sequences of points in Ω such that limj→∞ KΩ(zj , wj ) = 0,
if
lim
j→∞
f(zj ) = a and lim
j→∞
f(wj ) = b (a 6= b),
then f(z) is not a K-normal function.
Proof. Suppose, reasoning by contradiction, that f is K-normal. By the very
definition of K-normal function, there exist a positive constant C such that
Lz(log(1 + |f|
2
), v) ≤ C(F
K
Ω (z, v))2
for all (z, v) ∈ Ω × C
n
.
Let γ : [0, 1] → Ω be any differentiable curve from zj to wj . Then f ◦ γ :
[0, 1] → C is a curve from f(zj ) to f(wj ). It is elementary to see that
Lz(log(1 + |f|
2
), v) = |Df(z)v|
2
(1 + |f(z)|
2)
2
≥ 0,
where
Df(z)v := ∇f · v .
Hence
|df(γ(t))/dt|
2
(1 + |f(γ(t))|
2)
2
= Lγ(t)(log(1 + |f|
2
), γ0
(t)).
Therefore

Taking the infimum of the above inequality over all differentiable curves from
zj to wj , and applying Theorem 1 from [254] one has
s(a, b) = lim
j→∞
s(f(zj ), f(wj )) ≤
√
C lim
j→∞
KΩ(zj , wj ) = 0.
Clearly, when j → ∞ the right-hand side of the above inequality tends to zero,
while the term on the left-hand side of the inequality tends to s(a, b). This is
a contradiction, since a 6= b. This contradiction completes the proof.
Next let us introduce a little notation. If l ⊆ C
n is a complex line, l =
{aζ + b : ζ ∈ C}, then B ∩ l is a complex disk of Euclidean radius r = rl

Proposition 4.2.18. Let f : B → C be holomorphic. Then the following are
equivalent:
(1) f is normal;
(2) For any family {Φα}α∈A of automorphisms of B it holds that
{f ◦ Φα}α∈A
is a normal family;
(3) There is a constant C = C(f) such that for any complex line q and
fq = f|B∩q ◦ ψq it holds that

for all ζ ∈ D(0, r).
Proof. (2) ⇒ (3): Pick a complex line q. Without loss of generality we may
assume that q = {β · 1 : β ∈ C} where 1 = (1, 0, . . . , 0).
Let {ϕα}α∈A be automorphisms of D. Then each ϕα can be identified
in a natural way with an automorphism ϕeα of q ∩ B. And each ϕeα is the
restriction to q ∩ B of an element Φα ∈ Aut B. By (2), {f ◦ Φα} is a normal
family. Therefore {f ◦ ϕeα} is a normal family. Hence {fq ◦ ϕα} is a normal
family. By Remark 4.2.14, we may conclude that (3) holds for each complex
line q. That it holds uniformly over such lines follows from an easy argument
by contradiction.
(3) ⇒ (1): The inequality in (3) is invariant under automorphisms of B
and so is the inequality (1.1) which defines normality. So we need only check
normality at z = 0 with ξ = 1. But then the two inequalities are identical.
(1) ⇒ (2): The inequality (4.10) is clearly invariant under automorphisms
of B. Therefore it simply amounts to an equicontinuity condition for the family
{f ◦ Φα} as maps from B equipped with the Kobayashi metric to Cb equipped
with the spherical metric. By a variant of the Ascoli-Arzela theorem (see [287]),
{f ◦ Φα} is a normal family.
The following theorem is well known.
Theorem 4.2.19 (Hartogs extension theorem). If the function f is holomor￾phic everywhere in the domain D ⊂ C
n (n > 1) except perhaps for a set
K ⊂⊂ D such that K does not separate the domain (i.e., such that D\K is
connected), then f extends holomorphically to the whole domain D.
The condition that K does not separate the domain in the above theorem
is essential: Let K =

|z| =

be a sphere and D is the unit ball B in
C

The question then naturally arises: Can normal functions on D\K be ex￾tended to normal functions on D?
Let r be a positive number and Br(a) the open ball of radius r with center
a ∈ C
n, i.e.,
Br(a) = {z ∈ C

: |z − a| < r} .
As an abbreviation we denote by 0
z = (z1, . . . , zn−1) the projection of
z ∈ C
n into C

n−1
(i.e., the set of all

z for z ∈ D).
Theorem 4.2.20. If the function f is C-normal on B \ B1/2(
00, 1/2) ⊂ C
n
(n > 1), then f can be extended to a function that is normal on B.
Proof. Set Ω = B \ B1/2(
00, 1/2). Since f is a C-normal function on Ω by
hypothesis, from the definition of C-normal function, there exists a positive
constant C0 such that
Lz(log(1 + |f(z)|
2
), v) ≤ C0(F
C
Ω (z, v))2
(4.12)
for all z ∈ Ω and all v ∈ C
n.
By the Hartogs extension theorem any g holomorphic in Ω such that |g| < 1
extends holomorphically to the whole ball B and this extension ge can take only
those values at points of B1/2(
00, 1/2) that g takes in Ω. Hence |ge| < 1 in B.
It follows that

Ω (z, v) ≡ F

Therefore from (4.12) we obtain

), v) ≤ C0(F
C
B (z, v))2
(4.13)
for all z ∈ Ω and all v ∈ C
n.
By the Hartogs extension theorem f extends holomorphically to the whole
ball B. Denote this extension also by f. Since f is holomorphic in B we have
|f| < C1 on B3/4(0). It follows at once that

Since, for the domain the unit ball, the Bergman, Kobayashi, and
Carathéodory metrics are “equal” up to a constant factor we can say sim￾ply that f is in the class N , or equivalently f is a normal function in all of
B.
Remark 4.2.21. We now look at the Behnke-Sommer’s theorem. To state it,
we define an m-dimensional holomorphic surface S in C
n to be the image of
some domain G ⊂ C
m(m < n) under a nondegenerate holomorphic mapping
ϕ : G → C
n
. (4.16)
In particular, for m = 1, S is a holomorphic curve, and if G ⊂ C is a disk
and ϕ is continuous in G, then S = ϕ(G) is called a holomorphic disk. Recall
that a mapping (4.16) is said to be nondegenerate if the rank of the Jacobian
matrix 
∂ϕµ
∂zj

is equal to m at all points of G. The surface (4.16) is said to
be bounded if the set S = ϕ(G) is bounded in C
n.
Next we shall say that a sequence of sets Mj converges to a set M (notation:
Mj → M) if, for any ε > 0, there is a j0 such that for all j ≥ j0 we have
Mj ⊂ M(ε)
and M ⊂ M

j
where M(ε) and M
(ε)
j
denote the ε-dilations of the sets M and Mj , respectively
(i.e., the union of all polydisks P(z, ε) with centers at points of the sets).Normal Functions in C

Theorem 4.2.22 (Behnke-Sommer). Let Sj be a sequence of bounded holo￾morphic surfaces which, together with the boundaries ∂Sj , are contained in a
domain D ⊂ C
n. If Sj converges to some set S, ∂Sj converges to a set Γ,
and Γ ⊂⊂ D, then any function f ∈ O(D) extends holomorphically to some
neighborhood of the set S.
The Behnke-Sommer theorem is sometimes called the continuity principle.
Relatively speaking, it states that the property of a function to be holomorphic
in a neighborhood of the holomorphic surfaces Sj is also preserved for the limit
set of these surfaces.
The special case of the Behnke-Sommer theorem where the Sj are closed
subsets of the complex lines 0
z = 0aj and S is a closed subset of the line 0
z =
0a = limj→∞
0aj was already proved by Hartogs, and is known as Hartogs’s
continuity theorem.
Suppose that a domain D ⊂ C

Definition 4.2.23. A domain D with a C

a point a is said to be pseudoconvex at a if, in a neighborhood of a, there
exists a local defining function ϕ of the domain D such that

Definition 4.2.24. A domain D ⊂ C

at a point a ∈ ∂D, if there exist a neighborhood U = U(a) ⊂ C
n and a
holomorphic function f : U ∩ D → C that does not extend holomorphically
to a neighborhood of a. We say that D is holomorphically non-extendable if
it is not holomorphically extendable at each point of its boundary.
Theorem 4.2.25 (Levi-Krzoska). If a domain Ω with a C
2
boundary in a
neighborhood of a boundary point a is strictly pseudoconvex at this point, then
Ω is not holomorphically extendable at a. Conversely, if Ω is not holomorphi￾cally extendable at a point a, then it is pseudoconvex at a.
Corollary 4.2.26. Let ϕ ∈ C

be a real function in a neighborhood of a
point a ∈ C
n, ϕ(a) = 0, and suppose that the Levi form La(ϕ, ω) on the
complex tangent plane T

a
(S), where S = {ϕ(z) = 0}, has at least one negative90 Normal Functions in C
n
eigenvalue (i.e., there exists a vector ω ∈ T
c
a
(S) such that Ha(ϕ, ω) < 0). Then
any function f that is holomorphic in the part of a neighborhood of S where
ϕ < 0 has a holomorphic extension to a neighborhood of the point a.
Suppose that the domain Ω at some boundary point a can be tangent
from the exterior to a complex hypersurface A = {f(z) = 0}; this means that
f(a) = 0, but in some neighborhood Ua the surface A lies outside of Ω. Then
Ω is not holomorphically extendable at the point a (the function 1/f cannot
be extended), and hence, by the previous theorem, is pseudoconvex at this
point. This sufficient condition for psuedoconvexity is similar to the classical
geometric criterion for geometric convexity (instead of A we must take a real
hyperplane).
Until now we have considered domains with boundaries of class C
2
; how￾ever the concept of local pseudoconvexity can also be formulated in the general
case. For this let us agree to say that a domain Ω at a boundary point a can be
tangent from the interior by a family of holomorphic disks if there is a family
of holomorphic disks St ⊂⊂ D, 0 < t ≤ t0, converging as t → 0 to a disk S
such that St → S, ∂St → ∂S, where ∂S ⊂⊂ Ω, and S contains the point a. We
take the absence of this property as the definition of local pseudoconvexity in
the case of domains with arbitrary boundaries.
Definition 4.2.27. A domain Ω is said to be pseudoconvex at a boundary
point a, if at a it cannot be tangent from the interior by a family of holomor￾phic disks.
In particular, if ∂Ω is C
2
in a neighborhood of the point a and is pseudo￾convex at this point in the sense of Definition 4.2.23, then it is pseudoconvex
in the sense of Definition 4.2.27.
In fact, in the proof of the Levi-Krzoska theorem it is proved that if ∂Ω
is not pseudoconvex at a in the sense of Definition 4.2.23, then at a it can be
tangent from the interior by a family of holomorphic disks. We stress that the
notion of strict pseudoconvexity implies that the boundary is C
2
-smooth and
does not extend to arbitrary domains.
Theorem 4.2.28. If a domain Ω in C
n is not pseudoconvex at a point a ∈ ∂Ω,
then any function f that is C-normal in Ω has a C-normal extension to some
larger domain Ω
0 which contains a.
Proof. Since Ω is not pseudoconvex at a point a in the boundary then there
exists a ball Br(a) such that any function holomorphic in Ω extends holo￾morphically to Br(a). Any g ∈ O(Ω) extends holomorphically to a domain
Ω1 = Ω ∪ Br(a) and this extension ge can take only those values at points of
Ω ∪ Br(a) that g takes in Ω. It follows that

this extension fe defines a function Lz(log(1 + |fe|

is also normal.Extension for Bloch and Normal Functions 95
Proof. Since normality is a local property, it sufficient to prove that G is
a normal family in the unit ball. Fix a point z0 in Ω and consider a ball
B(z0, r) ⊂ Ω. Marty’s characterization of normal families yields a non-negative
constant M such that, for any f ∈ F,
Lz(log(1 + |f|
2
), v) < M |v|

for all z ∈ B(z0, r), v ∈ C

Arguing as in the lemmas, we conclude that there is a positive constant C
such that for any f ∈ F,
Lz(log(1 + |gfm + q|
2
), v) < C |v|

From Marty’s criterion it now follows that G = {gfm + q, f ∈ F} is a normal
family.
4.4 An Extension Theorem for Bloch and Normal
Functions
As an extension of the big Picard theorem, Lehto and Virtanen showed [164,
Theorem 9] that isolated singularities are removable for normal meromorphic
functions. Järvi [119] has given a generalization of this result for functions
defined in subdomains of C
n.
Set D∗ = D \ {0}, and let f : D∗ → Cb be normal. As noted above, f
extends to a function f
∗ meromorphic in D [164, p. 62]. Since FD(z, η) and
FD∗ (z, η) are comparable near ∂D, f ∗
is normal in D. Moreover, the order of
normality of f
∗ does not deviate too much from that of f. More precisely, we
have
Lemma 4.4.1. Given a positive number K, there is a positive number K0
such that any function f normal in D∗ with Cf ≤ K extends to a function f
∗
normal in D with Cf
∗ ≤ K0
.
Proof. We begin with a quick proof of the Lehto-Virtanen extension theorem.
Let f be normal in D∗
. Recall that
FD∗ (z, ξ) = hyperbolic metric of D∗ =
|ξ|
|z| log(1/ |z|)
.
Hence the hyperbolic area of D∗
(r) = {z ∈ C : 0 < |z| < r} is finite for
every r < 1. By (4.1), we have

By the big Picard theorem, the singularity at 0 is inessential.96 Normal Functions in C

Fix K > 0, and let f : D∗ → Cb be normal with Cf ≤ K. Again, let f
∗
stand for the extended function. Since the spherical metric is invariant under
rotations of the sphere, we may assume that f
∗
(0) = 0. Clearly it is sufficient
to exhibit an R, 0 < R < 1, depending only on K, such that |f

Set γr = {z ∈ C : |z| = r}, 0 < r < 1, and let s (f

(γr)) denote the spher￾ical length of f

(γr). We claim that R = e
−8K does the job. Suppose, on
the contrary, that |f

that |f

The next lemma is readily deduced by elementary considerations of the
Kobayashi metric. We omit the proof.
Lemma 4.4.2. Let f : (D∗
)
n → Cb be normal.
(1) For every k ∈ {1, . . . , n} and every (a1, . . . , an−1) ∈ (D∗
)
n−1
, the map
z → f (a1, . . . , ak−1, z, ak, . . . , an−1), D∗ → Cb,
is a normal function.
(2) For every k ∈ {1, . . . , n} and every a ∈ D∗
, the map
(z1, . . . , zn−1) → f (z1, . . . , zk−1, a, zk, . . . , zn−1), (D∗
)
n−1 → Cb,
is a normal function.
(3) For every a = (a1, . . . , an) ∈ ∂Dn with ai 6= 0, i = 1, . . . , n, the map
z → f (a1z, . . . , anz), D∗ → Cb,
is a normal function.
Further, the orders of normality of all these functions are bounded above by
that of f.
Let Ω ⊂ C

Theorem 4.4.3. Let Ω ⊂ C

subvariety of codimension one, whose singularities are normal crossings. Sup￾pose f : Ω \ V → Cb is normal. Then f extends to a holomorphic mapping
f

Proof. Since the problem is of a local nature and the inclusion mapping is
distance-decreasing (in the Kobayashi metrics), we may assume that Ω = Dn
and Dn \ V = (D∗
)
n
.
The proof will be by induction on n. The case n = 1 is part of Lemma
4.4.1. So let n ≥ 2 and assume that the extension is possible for 1, . . . , n − 1.
Let a = (a1, . . . , an) ∈ V \ {0}, and choose k ∈ {1, . . . , n} such that ak 6= 0.
Consider the function
fak
: (z1, . . . , zn−1) → f (z1, . . . , zk−1, ak, zk, . . . , zn−1) ,
mapping (D∗
)
n−1 → Cb. It follows from Lemma 4.4.2 that fak
is normal.
Hence, by the induction hypothesis, fak
admits a holomorphic extension f
∗
ak
:
Dn−1 → Cb. We set f
∗
(a) = f
∗
ak
(a1, . . . , ak−1, ak+1, . . . , an). We will show that
the extended mapping is holomorphic on Dn \ {0}. By the Riemann extension
theorem, it suffices to prove that f
∗
is continuous, i.e., Cl(f; a), the cluster
set of f at any a ∈ V \ {0}, reduces to a singleton (of course this also shows
that the extension does not depend on the choice of k).
So let a, k and f
∗
(a) be as above. Pick ε > 0. Set

o
is equicontinuous at ak. Hence there exists a positive δ such that
χ (f(z), f (z1, . . . , zk−1, ak, zk+1, . . . , zn)) < ε/2
and
χ (f (z1, . . . , zk−1, ak, zk+1, . . . , zn), f ∗
(a)) < ε/2
for z = (z1, . . . , zn) ∈ B(a, δ) \V . Thus χ (f(z), f ∗
(a)) < ε for z ∈ B(a, δ) \V .
It follows that Cl(f; a) = f
∗
(a).
It remains to extend f to 0. First, we infer from Lemmas 4.4.2 and 4.4.1
that f(z, . . . , z) tends to a limit, say w0, as z → 0. It suffices to show that
Cl(f; 0) = w0. Let ε > 0. Consider the mappings described in Lemma 4.4.2 (3),
or rather their counterparts for the restrictions of f to the hyperplanes of the
form {zn = a} , a ∈ D∗
. By Lemma 4.4.1, all of them extend holomorphically
to 0. Moreover, it follows from Lemmas 4.4.2 and 4.4.1 that the extensions con￾stitute an equicontinuous family at 0 (∈ C). Therefore we find a positive δ such98 Normal Functions in C

that χ (f(z), f ∗
(0, . . . , 0, zn)) < ε/3, χ (f
∗
(0, . . . , 0, zn), f (zn, . . . , zn)) < ε/3
and χ (f (zn, . . . , zn), w0) < ε/3 for z = (z1, . . . , zn) ∈ B(0, δ) \ V . Therefore
χ (f(z), w0) < ε for z ∈ B(0, δ) \ V . Hence Cl(f; 0) = w0. This completes the
proof.
Remark 4.4.4. Set V =

(z1, z2) ∈ C
2
| z1z2 (z1 − z2) = 0	
and consider the
mapping f : D2 \V → Cb,(z1, z2) → z1/z2. Since f omits the values 0,1 and ∞
in D2\V , it is normal by Remark 4.2.9. Yet f does not extend to a holomorphic
map D2 → Cb. Accordingly, we cannot dispense with some restrictions on the
singularities of V in Theorem 4.4.3.
Remark 4.4.5. One may ask whether the extended function is normal in Ω
(provided Ω is hyperbolic). However, it seems that this need not be the case
even in dimension one.
Remark 4.4.6. Results related to Theorem 1 can be found in [128], [135]
and [152]. Cf. in particular [128, Theorem 2].
In the counterexample discussed above the function involved is the restric￾tion to D2 \ V of a meromorphic function, i.e., a function with “indetermina￾cies”. This is always the case as shown by
Theorem 4.4.7. Let Ω ⊂ C
n be a domain and let V be a subvariety of Ω.
Suppose f : Ω \ V → Cb is normal. Then f extends to a meromorphic function
in Ω.
Proof. Denote by S(V ) the set of singular points of V . By Theorem 4.4.3, f
extends to a holomorphic mapping of Ω\S(V ) into Cb. Thus f can be regarded
as a meromorphic function in Ω \S(V ). Since dim S(V ) ≤ n−2, [251, p. 144],
f extends to a function meromorphic in Ω, [251, p. 149].

In several complex variables Bloch functions were studied on the ball and
on bounded homogeneous domains in [102, 107, 276, 277]. Generic smoothly
bounded domains in C
n, n > 1, are not homogeneous (for example, strictly
pseudo convex domains are generically rigid, see [143]).
Definition 4.4.8. ([148, p. 146]) A holomorphic function defined on a

functionsExtension for Bloch and Normal Functions 99
Remark 4.4.10. It is easily checked, using the explicit formula for the
Kobayashi metric given in [143], that this definition coincides with the more
classical definitions on the disk and ball.
To prove our theorem, we need some elementary results involving Haus￾dorff measures. A good exposition of the theory of Hausdorff measures can
be found in Federer’s monograph [72]. We begin by introducing the necessary
terminology and notation.
Definition 4.4.11. Let µ be a nonnegative measure on X. For any function
f : X → [0, +∞], the upper integral of f is defined as

1) If f : X → [0, +∞] is such that R ∗

Let E be an arbitrary subset of a metric space. Consider a covering of E
by at most countably many balls Bj (it is immaterial whether these are open
or closed) of radii rj , respectively, and compute the sum Σr
α
j
, where α is a
fixed positive integer. The infimum of such sums, mα(E), will to some extent
have to reflect the property that E is a set of “dimension α”; however, this
quantity is too coarse (for, say, the unit ball in Rm it equals 1 for all α ≤ m).
Therefore we first fix ε > 0, and define the quantity

For integer α = m we take the constant ck > 0 equal to the volume of the
unit ball in Rm (in particular, c0 = 1, c1 = 2, c2 = π, etc.); for noninteger α
we take it to be the corresponding expression with the gamma function (for
us the constants do not play a role at all, but this normalization is commonly
adopted); the index α will always be nonnegative.

The following lemma generalizes some elementary results from the theory
of functions of one complex variable.
Lemma 4.4.19. Let U be open in C
n, and let E be a closed subset of U.
Let fbe an analytic function on U \ E. Then f can be extended to an analytic
function on U if one of the following conditions is satisfied: (i) H2n−2
(E) = 0;
(ii) f is bounded and H2n−1
(E) = 0; (iii) fcan be extended to a continuous
function on U, and H2n−1
(E) < +∞; (iv) for some α in the range 0 < α ≤ 1,
f ∈ Lα and H2n−1+α(E) = 0.
Proof. The proof of Lemma 4.4.19 for n = 1 is elementary: case (i) is a tautol￾ogy; cases (ii) and (iii) are proved in [28]; and case (iv) can easily be established
by the methods of [28]. We now prove Lemma 4.4.19 for n > 1, utilizing the
result for n = 1. In all cases, H2n(E) = 0; therefore E is nowhere dense. Con￾sider an arbitrary point p of E, and assume without loss of generality that
p = 0n. We first consider cases (i) and (ii). By Lemma 4.4.17, we can pick a
complex line L through 0
n
so that Hl
(E ∩L) = 0. Rotate coordinates so that
L = {z1 = · · · = zn−1 = 0}. By Corollary 4.4.14 of Lemma 4.4.12, we can pick
an open disk d about 0 in C such that 0
n−1×d ⊂ U and ￾
0
n−1 × ∂d
∩E = ∅.
Since E is closed in U, there exists an open neighborhood W of 0
n−1
in C
n−1
such that W × d ⊂ U and (W × ∂d) ∩ E = ∅. Define
g(z) = 1
2πi Z
∂d
f (z1, · · · , zn−1, ζ)
ζ − zn
dζ for z ∈ W × d.
Consider the complex lines Lw = w × C
L for w ∈ w. For case
(i), let F = {w ∈ W : E ∩ Lw 6= ∅}; and for case (ii), let f = 
w ∈ W : H1
(E ∩ Lw) > 0
	
.
Consider Corollary 4.4.16 of Lemma 4.4.12. Thus the set of points w ∈ W
such that
g 6≡ f on W × d \ E
is an open subset of F, and hence it is empty. Therefore g extends f|(W×d\E)
.
Since g is analytic, these cases are proved. Now consider cases (iii) and (iv).
We can assume that f is a continuous function on all of U. Using the original
coordinates, we define g as above, where W and d are chosen so that W ×d ⊂
U. For case (iv), let F =

w ∈ W : H1+α (E ∩ LW ) > 0
	
, and for case (iii),
let F =

w ∈ W : Hl
(E ∩ Lw) = +∞
	
. Proceeding as before, we conclude
that
g = f|W×d.
Hence f|W×d is analytic with respect to zn and is similarly analytic with
respect to each zk(1 ≤ k ≤ n). Therefore f is analytic in W × Extension for Bloch and Normal Functions 103

article, but just announce that a proof can be based on a variation of reason￾ing by Campbell, Howard and Ochiai [34, Theorem 1, p. 106]. We base our
proof on the earlier argument of Campbell and Ogawa [35, Proposition 2, p.

First we prove that if O(D, Ω \ A) is dense in O(D, Ω) then the Kobayashi
pseudo-distance on Ω restricts to that on Ω \ A.
Let z and z
0 be two points of Ω not in A. Let r = KΩ(z, z0
). Choose
ε > 0, and let fi ∈ O(D, Ω), i = 1, · · · , m be holomorphic maps such that
f1(0) = z, fi (ai) = fi+1(0), fm (am) = z
0
P
for points a1, · · · , am ∈ D satisfying
m
i=1 dD (0, ai) ≤ r + ε.
Suppose that gi
is a map of D into Ω \ A, i = 1, · · · , m, and we put
ζi = gi(0), wi = gi (ai), ζ0 = z, ζm+1 = z
0
, ξi = fi (ai) = fi+1(0), ξ0 = z.
Then
KΩ\A(z, z0
) ≤

i=0
KΩ\A (wi
, ζi+1) ≤ r + ε +

i=0
KΩ\A (wi
, ζi+1).
Now, if the gi are chosen close to the fi
in O(D, Ω), then the points wi = gi (ai)
and ζi+1 = gi+1(0) will both be close to ξi = fi (ai) = fi+1(0) and hence close
to each other. Since KΩ\A is continuous, KΩ\A (wi
, ζi+1) will be small. Choose
the gi so close to the fi
in O(D, Ω) that Pm
i=0 KΩ\A (wi
, ζi+1) < ε. We obtain
KΩ−A(z, z0
) ≤ r + 2ε = dX(z, z0
) + 2ε. Finally, letting ε → 0 we obtain
KΩ−A(z, z0
) ≤ KΩ(z, z0
). Since the other inequality KΩ\A(z, z0
) ≥ KΩ(z, z0
)
is always satisfied, we obtain KΩ\A(z, z0
) = KΩ(z, z0
).
Recall also that O(D, Ω) is equipped with the usual compact-open topol￾ogy. Write
M = {f ∈ O(D, Ω) : f(D) ⊂⊂ Ω}.
It is clear that M is dense in O(D, Ω). Take g ∈ M arbitrarily. Then the
mapping G : D × Ω → D × Ω,
G(t, b) = (t, g(t) − 104 Normal Functions in C
n
is clearly a holomorphic injection. It follows, at least from [72, 2.10.45, p. 202],
that H2n(D × E) = 0. But then H2n(G(D × E)) = 0. Since the projections
do not increase Hausdorff measure, we find a sequence ck → 0, ck ∈ C
n, k =
1, 2, . . ., such that ck =6 g(t) − b for all t ∈ D, b ∈ E and k = 1, 2, . . . Define for
each k = 1, 2, . . . holomorphic mappings gk : D → C
n,
gk(t) = g(t) − ck.
Since g(D) ⊂⊂ Ω, there is a positive integer N such that gk(D) ⊂⊂ Ω for all
k ≥ N. It is clear that gk → g in O(D, Ω) as k → ∞. Moreover, one easily
sees that gk(D) ⊂ Ω \ E for all k = 1, 2, . . .. Hence the assertion follows.
Theorem 4.4.21. Let Ω be a domain in C
n, n ≥ 1, and let E ⊂ Ω be closed in
Ω such that H2n−2
(E) = 0. If f : Ω \ E → C is a Bloch function (respectively
if f : Ω \ E → C is a normal meromorphic function), then f has a Bloch
extension f
∗
: Ω → C (respectively a normal extension f
∗
: Ω → C).
Proof. By Lemma 4.4.19, f has a holomorphic extension f
∗
to Ω. Using
then Lemma 4.4.20 above, the continuity of the Kobayashi pseudodistance
KΩ and also the continuity of f
∗
, we see that f
∗
is Bloch. To prove the
normal function case, take z0 ∈ E arbitrarily. Choose R > 0 such that
B2n (z0, R) ⊂⊂ Ω and take z

spherically continuous meromorphic extension f

follows then again by using Lemma 4.4.20, the continuity of the Kobayashi
pseudodistance KΩ and the spherical continuity of f
∗
.
Remark 4.4.22. The above result supplements the result of [247, Corollary 3.2,
p. 148]. For a partial generalization, where the assumption “H2n−2
(E) = 0”
is replaced by the weaker assumption “H2n−2
(E ∩ K) < ∞ for each K ⊂ Ω
compact”, see Theorem 4.4.26 below.
For convenience of the reader, we recall first three basic results which we
need in the proof of Theorem 4.4.26 below.
Lemma 4.4.23 (see [72, 2.10.25, p. 188] or [268, Corollary 4, p. 114]). Let
A ⊂ C
n, n ≥ 2. (a) If H2n−2
(A) < ∞, then for each j, 1 ≤ j ≤ n, and for
H2n−2
-almost all Zj ∈ C
n−1
, we have that H0
(A (Zj )) < ∞.
(b) If H2n−1
(A) = 0, then for each j, 1 ≤ j ≤ n, and for H2n−2
-almost all
Zj ∈ C
n−1
, we have that H1
(A (Zj )) = 0.
The proof of the next lemma follows from the properties of the Kobayashi
metric, just as in [23, Lemma 2.2, p. 925], see [5, Proposition 1.6 and Corollary
1.7, p. 309] and [12, Lemma 2, p. 1173].
Lemma 4.4.24. Let Ω be a domain in C
n, n ≥ 2, and 1 ≤ j ≤ n. Suppose
that f : Ω → C is Bloch (respectively f : Ω → C is normal). If Zj ∈ C
n−1
Schottky’s Theorem in C
n 105
such that Ω (Zj ) is a nonempty domain in C, then the holomorphic function
fZj
: Ω (Zj ) → C (respectively the meromorphic function fZj
: Ω (Zj ) → C),
fZj
(zj ) = f (zj , Zj )
is Bloch (respectively normal).
Lemma 4.4.25. ([118, Lemma 3.4, p. 299]). Let Ω be a domain in C
n, n ≥ 2.
Let E ⊂ Ω be closed in Ω and such that for each j, 1 ≤ j ≤ n, and for
H2n−2
-almost all Zj ∈ C
n−1
the section E (Zj ) is totally disconnected. Let
f : Ω \ E → C be a holomorphic function. If for each j, 1 ≤ j ≤ n, and for
H2n−2
-almost all Zj ∈ C
n−1
the function fZj
: (Ω \ E) (Zj ) → C,
fZj
(zj ) = f (zj , Zj )
has a holomorphic (respectively a meromorphic) extension f
∗
Zj
to Ω (Zj ), then
f has a holomorphic (respectively a meromorphic) extension f
∗
to Ω.
A holomorphic function f : Ω → C is called quasi-Bloch if there is a
constant C = C(f) such that
|f(z) − f(z
0
)| ≤ CKΩ(z, z0
)
for all z, z0 ∈ Ω.
On the other hand, the assumption “H2n−2
(E) < ∞” is sufficient for Bloch
functions (and for normal functions, too):
Theorem 4.4.26. Let Ω be a domain in C
n, n ≥ 1. Let E ⊂ Ω be closed
in Ω and such that H2n−2
(E ∩ K) < ∞ for all K ⊂ Ω compact. If f is
Bloch (respectively normal) in Ω \ E, then f has a holomorphic (respectively
meromorphic) extension f
∗
to Ω.
Proof. Because of Lemma 4.4.23 (a), Lemma 4.4.24 and Lemma 4.4.25 it is
sufficient to give the proof for n = 1. But then the exceptional set E is locally
finite in Ω. Since Bloch functions are quasi-Bloch, the result follows from [248,
Theorem 2.10]. The normal function case is proved similarly, see [246, Theorem
3.5, p. 927].
The results of this section are due to Järvi [119] and Riihentaus [248].
4.5 Schottky’s Theorem in C
n
The center-piece of this chapter is the extension to C
n of the following remark￾able result due to Friedrich Schottky: if f is holomorphic in D and assumes
neither of the values 0 or 1, then f is bounded in D(r) by a bound depending106 Normal Functions in C
n
on r and |f(0)| only, for each r < 1. The principal application is the almost
immediate fact that a family of holomorphic functions on a common domain,
none of which has 0 or 1 in its range, if bounded at a point, is uniformly
bounded in a neighborhood of that point. The compactness theorems then
come into play with astounding consequences. Of course 000
00 and 001
00 here are
convenient normalization: any two distinct complex numbers would serve as
well.
A century ago, Picard [232] showed that, in any neighborhood of an essen￾tial singularity, a complex function attains every complex value, with at most
one exception, an infinite number of times. Picard’s proof was non-elementary,
in that it made use of the theory of modular functions. The first elementary
proof was given twenty-five years later by Schottky [262], and was based on
a theorem which now bears his name. Subsequently, Montel [200] used Schot￾tky’s theorem and the notion of a normal family to give what has become the
standard elementary proof of Picard’s theorem.
Classically, there are at least three approaches to Schottky’s theorem. The
most sophisticated of these uses the theory of modular functions [78, Chapter
5]. A second approach, via Bloch’s theorem, is described in §§1−3 of Chapter
XII of [49]. In [30] the authors prefer to follow an argument of Titchmarsh [278,
p. 8.85 ] which appears to be based on the original one of Schottky and which,
in many respects, seems the most natural way to arrive at Schottky’s theorem.
The main part of the proof of Schottky’s theorem in [30] follows very
closely the lines of Titchmarsh’s proof. However, what Titchmarsh describes
as “Schottky’s theorem” is not the full form of the theorem as understood by
other authors, and they are obliged to supplement his argument in order to
reach that full form.
Scottky’s theorem can be given a completely elementary proof, based on
nothing more than Montel’s theorem and general properties of normal families,
which works for the cases n = 1 and n > 1 at the same time.
Theorem 4.5.1 (Schottky Theorem). Suppose that f(z) is holomorphic in
Ω ⊂ C
n, n ≥ 1, whose range omits 0 and 1 there. If a ∈ Ω and |f(a)| < M,
then for every ε > 0 sufficiently small we have
|f(z)| < C for all z ∈ Ω, δ(z) ≥ ε, (4.1)
where δ(z) denotes the Euclidean distance from z ∈ Ω to ∂Ω. Here C is a
positive constant depending only on f(a) and ε.
The proof of Theorem 4.5.1 is based on the following lemma.
Lemma 4.5.2. Let F be a normal family of holomorphic functions in a do￾main Ω ⊂ C
n, n ≥ 1. Let M be a positive number and a ∈ Ω. Assume that
for each function f ∈ F, we have
|f(a)| < M.
Then the family F is uniformly bounded on each compact subset of Ω.Schottky’s Theorem in C
n 107
Proof. Let K be a compact set of points belonging to Ω. Assume that F is
not uniformly bounded on K. Then to each positive integer k, corresponds a
function fk ∈ F such that
max
z∈K
|fk(z)| > k.
The sequence {fk} cannot converge on compact {a} ∪ K to a holomorphic
function or to ∞ in Ω. This contradicts the hypothesis that F is a normal
family.
Proof of Theorem 4.5.1. Let G denote the family of all functions holomorphic
on Ω which omit the values 0 and 1. According to Montel’s theorem [66, The￾orem 1.4] the family G is normal. By Lemma 4.5.2, the family G is uniformly
bounded on Ωε = {z ∈ Ω, δ(z) ≥ ε}; hence there is a positive constant C such
that (4.1) holds for each function f(z) of F. This constant C has then the
required property.
Remark 4.5.3. The method of proof in Theorem 4.5.1 does not give any in￾formation about what the constant C is. The essence of this theorem is not
the exact value of the constant C, but the fact that such a constant exists.
In the case n = 1 the Schottky theorem has numerous proofs. We refer
to [31] for an exposition (the history, methods and references) of the theorem.
Schottky’s original theorem [262] did not give an explicit bound for f. Let
K(f(0), r) denote the best possible bound in Theorem 4.5.1. Various authors
have dealt with the problem of giving an explicit estimate for this bound. See
Jenkins [120]; Hempel [113] who gave some bounds which are in some sense
the best possible.
It was shown in Murali Rao [243, Theorem 7.17, p. 118] that Shottky’s
theorem holds with
C = tan(arctan M + (c(1 − r
2
))−1
),
where c is some constant. The proof is based on the work of Minda and
Schober [190].
We shall give an alternative argument based on the classical Montel theo￾rem, and Marty’s criterion for normality.
Recall that to every a in the unit disk D := {z ∈ C : |z| < 1} corresponds
an automorphism ϕa of the disk that interchanges a and 0, namely ϕa(w) :=
(w−a)/(1−aw). Note for later reference that ϕa(0) = −a and ϕ
0
a
(0) = 1−|a|
2
.
Define Aut(D) := {ϕa, a ∈ D}.
The following theorem is the main result of this section.
Theorem 4.5.4 (see [243, Theorem 7.17, p. 118]). Suppose that f(z) is holo￾morphic in the unit disk D and with range omitting 0 and 1. If |f(0)| < M,
then, for every r ∈ (0, 1), we have
|f(z)| < tan(arctan M + 2rL/(1 − r
2
)) for all |z| < r, r ∈ [0, 1). (4.2)108 Normal Functions in C
n
Proof. Let G denote the family of all functions holomorphic on the unit disk
D which omit the values 0 and 1. By Montel’s theorem [292, p. 218] the family
G◦Aut(D) is normal. Marty’s theorem [292, p. 216] now yields a nonnegative
constant L such that, for any f ◦ ϕa ∈ G ◦ Aut(D)
|f
0
(ϕa(0))|
1 + |f(ϕa(0))|
2 ≤ L.
The constant L in the inequality above does not depend on f ◦ ϕa. The exact
value of L is not known.
Using the chain rule for differentiation and replacing −a by z we obtain
|f
0
(z)|(1 − |z|
2
)
1 + |f(z)|
2
≤ L for all z ∈ D.
Since f never takes the value 0, the function t → |f(tz)| is continuously
differentiable on (0, 1) for any fixed z ∈ D[r] = {|z| < r} and

arctan(|f(z)|) ≤ arctan(|f(0)|) + 2rL

2
< arctan M +
2rL
1 − r
2
which is the theorem with C = tan(arctan M + 2rL/(1 − r
2
)). This completes
the proof of Theorem 4.5.4.
Remark 4.5.5. The same proof works for n > 1.
It still does not matter that the numerical upper bound is equal to
tan(arctan M + 2rL/(1 − r
2
)), and this estimate is still not the optimal one
(by the way, the optimal estimate is not known to this day). The important
things are, first, the fact that the estimate depends only on the radius of the
disk and on the value of function at its center; and, second, the form of its
dependence on f(0) and r.
This type of argument can also be used to prove:
Theorem 4.5.6 (Picard’s Little Theorem). At most one complex number is
absent from the range of a nonconstant entire function (= holomorphic in C).Schottky’s Theorem in C
n 109
4.5.1 Picard’s little theorem
If f ∈ H(C) and f(C) ⊂ U where C \U contains at least two points, then f is
constant. This is a dramatic strengthening of Liouville’s theorem, as Liouville’s
theorem can be thought of as the preceding theorem where the condition on U
is replaced by the condition U = D. We will actually prove an even stronger
result known as Picard’s big theorem [185, Theorem 10.14, p. 166].
Proof. Assume, to the contrary, that an entire function f omits two distinct
values from its range. Composing with a linear fractional transformation, we
may also assume that the omitted values are 0 and 1.
The function f(2kλ), where k is positive integer, is holomorphic in D,
f(2kλ) takes the same values in D as does f in |z| < 2
k
, and f(2kλ) omits
the values 0 and 1.
The family 
f(2kϕa), ϕa ∈ Aut(D), k = 1, 2 . . .	
, being contained in the
family of functions avoiding 0 and 1, is normal in D by Montel’s theorem [292,
p. 218]. By Marty’s theorem [292, p. 216], there exists L > 0 such that, for
any f(2kϕa),

f
0
(2kϕa(0))


1 + |f(2kϕa(0))|
2 ≤ L.
After some manipulations, using the chain rule for differentiation and the
equalities ϕa(0) = −a and ϕ
0
a
(0) = 1 − |a|
2
, we find that

(1 − |a|

1 + |f(−2

Replacing in this inequality −2

Keeping z fixed, let k tend to infinity to deduce that f
0
(z) = 0 for every point
z in the complex plane. But this clearly implies that f(z) is a constant, not a
nonconstant entire function. The obtained contradiction proves the theorem.
An immediate (and easy) corollary of Picard’s little theorem is Liouville’s
theorem:
Corollary 4.5.7. Every bounded entire function is constant.110 Normal Functions in C
n
Theorem 4.5.6 is a remarkable generalization of Liouville’s theorem. It
is simple to find entire functions whose range is the entire C—nonconstant
polynomials, for instance. The exponential function is an example of an entire
function whose range omits only one value, namely zero. But there does not
exist a nonconstant entire function whose range omits two different values.
The fundamental theorem of algebra is a consequence of Liouville’s theo￾rem (for the proof see, for example, [243, Corollary 4, p. 98]).
An alternative program for obtaining the above theorems (and not only)
in elementary fashion was indicated by Zalcman [292, p. 817].
Theorem 4.5.8 (Picard’s big theorem). Let f be holomorphic in
Ω = {z ∈ C : 0 < |z − z0| < δ} .
If z0 is an essential singularity of the function f, then f(z) assumes in an ar￾bitrary neighborhood of z all finite complex values with one possible exception.
Proof. Let us assume that z0 = 0. Suppose that there exist two finite numbers
a and b and a neighborhood of zero in which f(z) does not assume either the
value a or the value b. Then the functions fj (z) = f(z/2
j
), j = 1, 2, . . ., also do
not assume the values a and b in that neighborhood. Consequently, by Montel’s
theorem, the family 
f(z/2
j
)
	
is normal in the chordal metric on compact
subsets of C \ {0}. Relabeling a subsequence, we may suppose fjk
converges
uniformly on compact subsets of C\{0} to a function g holomorphic on C\{0}
or to g ≡ ∞ by Hurwitz’s theorem. If g is holomorphic, then |g(z)| ≤ M < ∞
on |z| = 1 and hence |f| ≤ M + 1 on |z| = 1/2
jk for k ≥ k0. But then, by the
maximum principle, |f| ≤ M + 1 on 1/2
jk+1 ≤ |z| ≤ 1/2
jk for k ≥ k0. Thus
|f| ≤ M + 1 on 0 < |z| < 1/2
jk0 , so that, by Riemanns theorem on removable
singularities, f extends to be holomorphic in a neighborhood of 0.
If g ≡ ∞, we can apply a similar argument to 1/f(z/2
j
) to conclude
that 1/f extends to be holomorphic at 0 and hence f is meromorphic in a
neighborhood of 0.
4.6 K-normal Functions
In the paper [47] an important equivalent formulation of normal function was
derived using ideas from invariant geometry.
Let Ω be a bounded domain in C
n. Set
Qf (z) := sup
v∈Cn\{0}
ds(f(z), f∗(z)v)
F
K
Ω
(z, v)
for all z ∈ Ω.K-normal Functions 111
Definition 4.6.1. A holomorphic function f : Ω ⊂ Cb is normal if the deriva￾tive Qf (z) is bounded from the Kobayashi metric on Ω (equivalently, the
Poincaré-Bergman metric on Ω) to the spherical metric on Cb.
The equivalence of this definition with the previous one is a sophisticated
exercise with Marty’s theorem.
Theorem 4.6.2. Let Ω be a bounded domain in C
n. The following statements
are equivalent for f ∈ H(Ω):
(a) F = {f ◦ ϕ : ϕ ∈ H(D, Ω)} is normal;
(b) there exists a constant Q > 0 such that
Qf (z) := sup
v∈Cn\{0}
ds(f(z), f∗(z)v)
F
K
Ω
(z, v)
< Q for all z ∈ Ω. (4.1)
Proof. (a) ⇒ (b) Suppose F = {f ◦ ϕ : ϕ ∈ H(D, Ω)} is normal. Marty’s char￾acterization of normal families yields a non-negative constant L > 0 such that
for any ϕ ∈ H(D, Ω)
(f ◦ ϕ)
0
(0)
1 + |f ◦ ϕ(0)|
2 < L. (4.2)
Since F
K
Ω (z, v) = inf r over all maps ϕ ∈ H(D, Ω) with the normalization
ϕ(0) = z, ϕ
0
(0)r = v, where r > 0, there exists ψ ∈ H(D, Ω) such that
ψ(0) = z, ψ∗(0)a = v and a/2 < F K
Ω (z, v) ≤ a. Therefore, from (4.2),
ds(f(z), f∗(ζ)v) < 2L · F
K
Ω (ζ, v) for all (ζ, v) ∈ C

.
Namely, Qf ≤ 2L.
(b) ⇒ (a) Let µ and ζ be distinct points in Ω. Let γ : [0, 1] → Ω be a

curves γ satisfying γ(0) = µ, γ(1) =
ζ, gives
s(f(µ), f(ζ)) ≤ Q · KeΩ(µ, ζ) for all µ, zeta ∈ Ω .
Since KΩ is the integrated form of the infinitesimal pseudometric F
K
Ω , i.e.,
KΩ = KeΩ (see [7, Corollary 3]), from the previous inequality we obtain
s(f(ϕ(z)), f(ϕ(w))) ≤ Q · KΩ(ϕ(z), ϕ(w))112 Normal Functions in C
n
for all ϕ ∈ H(D, Ω) and all z, w ∈ D. By the distance decreasing property of
the Kobayashi distance,
KΩ(ϕ(z), ϕ(w)) ≤ KD(z, w)
for all ϕ ∈ H(D, Ω) and all z, w ∈ D. Therefore
KΩ(ϕ(z), ϕ(w)) ≤ Q · KD(z, w)
for all ϕ ∈ H(D, Ω) and all z, w ∈ D. Since KD = dD it follows that
the family F = {f ◦ ϕ : ϕ ∈ H(D, Ω)} is equicontinuous from the Poincaré
metric to the spherical metric. By the Ascoli-Arzelà Theorem, the family
F = {f ◦ ϕ : ϕ ∈ H(D, Ω)} is normal on D.
Theorem 4.6.2 shows that Definition 4.6.1 is equivalent to the definition
of K-normal functions given earlier, i.e. one implies the other.
Proposition 4.6.3. Let F be the family of all holomorphic functions on Ω
with values in C \ {0, 1}. Then, for all µ, ζ ∈ Ω and all f ∈ F,
exp(−KΩ(µ, ζ)) ≤
c + log |f(µ)|
c + log |f(ζ)|
≤ exp(KΩ(µ, ζ)) (4.3)
where
c =

Furthermore, if there exists continuous log f on Ω then
exp(−KΩ(µ, ζ)) ≤
c + |log f(µ)|
c + |log f(ζ)|
≤ exp(KΩ(µ, ζ)) (4.4)
In the proof of this proposition, we combine the result of Lai [154] with
the definition of the Kobayashi metric and obtain a very elementary proof of
Proposition 3 in [45].
Proof. The classical theorem of Landau may be stated in the form that if the
function f(z) is holomorphic in the unit disk D and does not take the values
0 and 1, then f
0
(0) has a bound depending only on f(0). In fact
|f
0
(0)| ≤ 2 |f(0)|(c + |log |f(0)||), (4.5)
where
c =
Γ( 1

= 4.3768796 . . .
(see, for example, [154]).
For z ∈ D define ψz(w) = (w +z)/(1 + zw). Since f ◦ψz does not take the
values 0 and 1, from (4.5) we derive the following inequality
(1 − |z|
2
)|(f ◦ ψz)
0
(0)| ≤ 2 |(f ◦ ψz)(0)|(c + |log |f ◦ ψz(0)||). (4.6)K-normal Functions 113
Let µ, ζ be a pair of points in Ω. Since KΩ(µ, ζ) is an inner pseudometric
(see [6]), for each ε > 0 there exist an integer ` > 1, φ1, . . . , φ` ∈ H(D, Ω) and
a1, . . . , a` ⊂ (0, 1) satisfying φ1(0) = ζ, φj (0) = φj+1 for j = 1, . . . , L − 1 and
φ`(0) = µ, and
Σ
l
j=1ρ(0, aj ) < KΩ(µ, ζ) + ε/2.
Set gj = f ◦ φ. From inequality (4.6) we obtain
∂
∂t |log(c + log |gj (t)|)| ≤ 2
1 − t
2
(4.7)
If we integrate both sides from t = 0 to aj , the result becomes
log nc + log |gj (aj )|
c + log |gj (0)|
o
≤ ρ(0, aj ).
Then
log nc + log |f(µ)|
c + log |f(ζ)|
o
≤ KΩ(µ, ζ) + ε.
Letting ε → 0, we finally get
c + log |f(µ)|
c + log |f(ζ)|
≤ exp(KΩ(µ, ζ))
so the second inequality in (4.3) is proved. Since µ and ζ play symmetric roles,
it is evident that the first inequality in (4.3) also holds.
For obtaining inequalities (4.4), let us notice that there exists continuous
log(log gj ) on t ∈ [0, al
]. Since

From this inequality and inequality (4.7), we obtain
∂
∂t(c + |log gj (t)|) ≤
2
1 − t
2
for t ∈ [0, aj ].
Integrating both sides of this inequality as above we obtain the inequality
(4.4).
The proof of proposition is now complete.
By Montel’s theorem the family of all holomorphic functions on Ω with
values in C \ {0, 1} is necessary normal. In a similar fashion we may extend
the proposition to obtain the following:114 Normal Functions in C
n
Lemma 4.6.4. Let f be a K-normal function on a domain Ω ⊂ C
n. There
exist a constant c > 1 such that
log(cµ(f, x)) ≤ log(cµ(f, y)) exp(2KΩ(x, y)) for all x, y ∈ Ω.
Here µ(f, x) := max{1, |f(x)|}.
Proof. We observe that F ◦ H(D, Ω) ≡ F, i.e., F is an invariant normal
family. Hayman [111, p. 165] has obtained stronger versions of the theorems
of Schottky [262] and Landau [156]. He has shown that for an invariant normal
family in H(D) there is a constant c > 0 such that for all g ∈ F,
|g
0
(0)| < 2µ0(log µ0 + c),
where µ0 = max{1, |g(0)|}. For z ∈ D define ψz by ψz(w) = (w +z)/(1 +zw).
Then, for each g ∈ F, we have
(1 − |z|

)|g

(z)| = |(g ◦ ψz)
0
(0)| < 2µz(log µz + c),
where µz = max{1, |g(z)|}.
Let µ, ζ ∈ Ω, let f ∈ F. For each ε > 0 there exist an integer j > 1,
ϕ1, ϕ2, . . . , ϕj holomorphic maps of D into Ω and points a1, . . . , aj ⊂ (0, 1)
satisfying ϕ1(0) = ζ, ϕi(ai) = ϕi+1(0) for i = 1, . . . , j − 1 and φj (aj ) = x,
such that
X
i
kD(0, ai) < KΩ(µ, ζ) + ε/2.
We may assume that |f(µ)| > 1, that gi([0, ai
]) ⊂ D or gi([0, ai
]) ⊂ C \ D
where gi = f ◦ ϕi
. Let I = {i : gi([0, ai

If 1 ∈ I, then

Letting ε → 0, we finally get

Remark 4.6.5. Proposition 4.6.3 holds also for holomorfic functions defined
on an infinite dimensional complex Banach manifold with values in C \ {0, 1};
the same proof works. An alternative but equally complicated proof of Propo￾sition 4.6.3 can be found in [45, Proposition 3].
For the sake of convenience we shall now restate the lemma of Zal￾cman [291].
Lemma 4.6.6 (Zalcman Lemma). Let F be a family of analytic functions in
D. Then F is not normal in D if and only if there exist:
(i) a number r with 0 < r < 1;
(ii) points zn satisfying |zn| < r;
(iii) functions fn ∈ F;
(iv) positive numbers ρn → 0 as n → ∞; such that
fn(zn + ρnξ) → g(ξ) as n → ∞, (4.8)
uniformly on compact subsets of C, where g is a nonconstant entire function
in C. The function g may be taken to satisfy the normalization
g
]
(z) < g(0) = 1, z ∈ C.
As before, we desire a criterion for the non-normality of a holomorphic
function. We are now ready to present our main result.
Theorem 4.6.7. Let Ω be a bounded domain in C
n. The following statements
are equivalent for f ∈ O(Ω):
(a) f is not a K-normal function;
(b) There exist sequences {µm}, {ζm} in Ω, and a positive constant M such
that kΩ(µm, ζm) < M for all m ≥ 1
lim m→∞
f(µm) = ∞ and lim m→∞
f(ζm) = a ∈ C.
Proof. (a) ⇒ (b) Since f is not normal on Ω it follows that the family
F = {f ◦ ϕ : ϕ ∈ O(D, Ω)}
is not normal in D. Apply Lemma 4.6.6 to F with r, zn, ρn, f ◦ ϕn, and g
as given therein. Since g is a nonconstant entire function in C it follows that
there exists a sequence {ξm} ⊂ C such that |g(ξm)| > m. In fact, if this were
not the case, g is bounded in C. By Liouville’s theorem g ≡ constant.
For fixed ξm chose nm large enough so that
(i) |znm + ρnmξm| < (1 + r)/2;116 Normal Functions in C
n
(ii) |f ◦ ϕnm(znm + ρnmξm)| > m/2.
Put wnm = znm + ρnmξm, µm = ϕnm(wnm), and ym = ϕnm(znm).
By the distance decreasing property of the Kobayashi metric,
kΩ(µm, ζm) = kΩ(ϕnm(wnm), ϕnm(znm)) ≤ dD(wnm, znm).
By the triangle inequality of the Poincaré distance,
dD(wnm, znm) ≤ dD(0, znm) + dD(0, wnm).
For any z ∈ D the Poincaré distance dD(0, z) is equal to be log((1 + |z|)/(1 −
|z|)). Since |znm| < r and |wnm| < (1 + r)/2, it follows that
dD(wnm, znm) ≤ log((1 + r)/(1 − r)) + log((3 + r)/(1 − r)).
Putting the above together we get kΩ(µm, ζm) ≤ M, where M = log((1 +
r)/(1 − r)) + log((3 + r)/(1 − r)) < ∞. By (ii), we have that
lim m→∞
f(µm) = lim m→∞
f ◦ ϕnm(znm + ρnmξm) = ∞.
By (4.8), we have that
lim m→∞
f(ζm) = lim m→∞
f ◦ ϕnm(znm + ρnm0) = g(0) ∈ C.
(b) ⇒ (a) Assume, to get a contradiction, that f is a normal function on
Ω. By Lemma 2.2,
log(cµ(1, f(µm))) ≤ log(cµ(1, f(ζm))) exp(2kΩ(µm, ζm)) for all m ≥ 1. (4.9)
The left hand side of (4.9) tends to infinity as m → ∞ while the right hand
side is bounded since log(cµ(1, f(ζm))) is convergent and exp(2kΩ(µm, ζm)) is
bounded by exp(2M) and we have a contradiction. This contradiction proves
that f is not a K-normal function. That concludes the proof.
Lehto and Virtanen [14, p. 53] remark that the sum of a normal function
and a bounded function (which is necessary normal) is a normal function. In
the finite dimensional case we have:
Corollary 4.6.8. Let Ω be a bounded domain in C
n. If f1, . . . , fl are a finite
number of K-normal holomorphic function on Ω ⊂ C
n such that each sequence
{µn} of points in Ω contains a subsequence {µnm} on which at most one of
fj (1 ≤ j ≤ l) is unbounded, then h := Pl
j=1 fj is a K-normal function.
Proof. Suppose, to the contrary, that h is not a K-normal function. By The￾orem 4.6.7, we can find two sequences {µn} and {ζn} in Ω, and a positive
constant M such that kΩ(µm, ζm) < M for all m ≥ 1, limm→∞ h(µm) = ∞,
and limm→∞ h(ζm) = a ∈ C. Since limm→∞ h(µm) = ∞ then {µm} contains
a subsequence again denoted by {µm} such that at most one of fj , say f1,
is unbounded on {µm}. Since limm→∞ h(ζm) = a ∈ C then {ζm} contains a
subsequence {ζmk
} such that either:K-normal Functions 117
(i) at least two of fj (1 ≤ j ≤ l) is unbounded on {ζmk
};
(ii) or limm→∞ h(ζm) = aj ∈ C, (1 ≤ j ≤ l).
The case (i) is excluded by the assumption of the corollary. Hence
lim
k→∞
f1(µmk
) = ∞, lim
k→∞
f1(ζmk
) = a1 ∈ C,
and kΩ(µmk
, ζmk
) < M for all k ≥ 1. By Theorem 4.6.7 f1 is not a K-normal
function on Ω, a contradiction which proves the corollary.
In [14] F. Bagemihl and W. Seidel posed the following question: Given a
sequence {zj} ⊂ D converging to some ζ ∈ ∂D and a holomorphic mapping
f ∈ O(D) such that limj→∞ s(f(zj ), l) = 0 for some l ∈ C, under what
conditions on f and {zj} can f have the limit l along some continuum in D
which is asymptotic at ζ? Theorem 4.6.7 yields the following multidimensional
analogue to one of their results.
Corollary 4.6.9. Let Ω be a bounded domain in C
n. Let {µn} and {ζn}
be two sequences of points in Ω, and let M be a positive constant such that
kΩ(µm, ζm) < M for all m ≥ 1. If f ∈ O(Ω) is a K-normal function which
omits ` ∈ Cb in Ω but limm→∞ s(f(µm), `) = 0 then limm→∞ s(f(ζm), l) = 0.
Proof. Assume first that ` ∈ C. Since
1 + |f(µ) − l|
2
1 + |f(µ)|
2 ≤ 2(1 + |`|
2
)
it follows from the hypothesis and Theorem 4.6.7 that g(z) = 1/(f(z)−l) is a
K-normal holomorphic function on Ω. It is easy to see that limm→∞ g(µm) =
∞. Therefore, we have limm→∞ g(ζm) = ∞ by Theorem 4.6.7. Hence
limm→∞ s(f(ym), `) = 0 as desired. If ` = ∞ then the corollary is an im￾mediate consequence of Theorem 4.6.7. Thus the proof is complete.
Corollary 4.6.10. Let Ω be a bounded domain in C
n. If f ∈ H(Ω) is a
K-normal function and if h is not a K-normal holomorphic function on Ω
such that each sequence {µm} of points in Ω contains a subsequence {µmk
}
on which at most one of f or h is unbounded, then f + h is not a K-normal
function.
Proof. Since h is not K-normal there exists {µm} and {ζm} such that
kΩ(µm, ζm) < M, h(µm) → ∞ and h(ζm) → a. It follows that f(µm) is
bounded and hence it contains a convergent subsequence. By passing to this
subsequence we can assume f(µm) → α. From Theorem 4.6.7, as f is K￾normal, it follows that f(ζm) 6→ ∞. By passing once more to this subsequence
we may assume that f(ζm) → β. We deduce then that (h + f)(µm) → ∞ and
(h + f)(ζm) → α + β and therefore, by Theorem 4.6.7, f + h is not K-normal.
Thus the proof is complete.
The proof goes through word for word when Ω is a complex space, or a
complex Banach manifold. See [65, 151].118 Normal Functions in C

4.7 P-point Sequences
In this chapter we gives a criterion for a holomorphic function, defined in a
strictly pseudoconvex domain in C
n, to be a normal function in terms of the
distribution of values of holomorphic functions. The first result of the theory
of the distribution of values of holomorphic functions goes back to 1868; in the
master’s dissertation of Yulian Vasil’evich Sokhotskii a theorem was proved
which asserted that “at a pole of infinite order” a function always “must take
on all possible values”.
A clarification of some terminology is in order.
Definition 4.7.1. A strictly pseudoconvex domain in C
n with C
2 boundary
is a bounded domain Ω in C
n for which there exist a neighborhood U of ∂Ω
and a real-valued function φ ∈ C2
(U) such that
(a) Ω ∩ U = {z ∈ Ω : φ(z) < 0};
(b) φ is strictly plurisubharmonic in U, i.e.
Lξ(φ, v) > 0 for all v ∈ T
c
ξ
(S) \ {0};
(c) ∇φ(z) = 0 6 in U.
Primarily, we will do no more than summarize some basic results on strictly
pseudoconvex domains which we are needed in the sequel. All these results can
be found in Krantz’s book [143]; references to the indicated papers indicate
that these ideas are formulated in these papers in precisely this form.
Lemma 4.7.2 ([192, Lemma 2.8]). Let the strictly pseudoconvex domain
Ω ⊂ C
n. For any point ξ ∈ ∂Ω there exist a neighborhood W such that the
domain U = Ω∩W is biholomorphically equivalent to a convex domain in C
n;
moreover, the closure U is biholomorphically equivalent to a closed convex set
in C
n.
The next lemma is a standard consequence of Hopf’s lemma [143].
Lemma 4.7.3 ([233, Lemma 3]). Let Ω1 and Ω2 be strictly convex domains
in C
n and f : Ω1 → Ω2 Then there exist constants γ1, γ2 > 0 so that for any
point z ∈ Ω1 the inequalities
γ1δ(z, ∂Ω) < δ(f(z), Ω2) < γ1δ(z, ∂Ω)
are valid.
We record the following localization result.P-point Sequences 119
Proposition 4.7.4 ([85, Proposition 6]). Let Ω be a strictly pseudoconvex

for all vectors v ∈ C
n
lim
z→ξ
FΩ∩V (z, v)
FΩ(z, v)
= 1.
The localization is uniform in the sense that: Suppose Ω is fixed and P
is a neighborhood of the (variable) boundary point ξ of uniform size. Then,
given ε > 0, there exists a neighborhood Q of ξ of uniform size, such that
FΩ∩P (z, v)/FΩ(z, v) < 1 + ε for z ∈ Ω ∩ Q and all v ∈ C
n.

For a strictly pseudoconvex domain in C
n (cf. [114, 235]) S.I. Pinčuk and
G.M. Khenkin independently have obtained a much more refined estimate,
which takes into account the position of the vector v with respect to the
complex structure of the boundary of the domain.
The next result follows from ideas of Graham [85]. See also [5].
Theorem 4.7.6 (see [114, Lemma 1], [115]). For each strictly pseudoconvex
domain Ω ⊂ C
n, there exists positive constants k1 and k2 such that for all
points z ∈ Ω, sufficiently close to the boundary S = ∂Ω, and all v ∈ C

where πT (v) and πN (v) are the projections of v onto the complex tangent plane
and the complex normal to ∂Ω at the point ξ = ξ(z) closest to z.120 Normal Functions in C
n
In the case of the ball such a different behavior of CΩ(z, v) near the bound￾ary in different directions is evident. There is a refinement of Theorem 4.7.6
due to Graham [85]. It can be shown that an analog of Theorem 4.7.6 also
holds for the invariant Bergman metric.
For strictly pseudoconvex domains in any dimension, the Bergman,
Caratheodory, and Kobayashi metrics are all comparable; such comparabil￾ity follows from the results of I. Graham [84] and K. Diederich [52].
Let Ω be a bounded domain in C
n. We shall use cΩ(z, ζ) to denote
the Carathéodory distance between points z, ζ ∈ Ω. Denote by Bc(z

, ε) =

z ∈ Ω : cΩ(z
0
, z) < ε	
the ball in the Carathéodory metric with center z
0
and radious ε.
It is known that for the ball B = B(0, R) = {z ∈ C
n : |z| < R} the
Caratheodory metric coincides with the Bergman metric and has the form

We now have now some grasp on the fundamental facts about the strictly
pseudoconvex domains in C
n. It is time to apply our knowledge to the study
of normal functions of several complex variables.
The notion of P-point sequence was originally defined by V. I. Gavrilov [82]
for meromorphic functions in the unit disk D. Gavrilov has shown that a
holomorphic function f(z) in the unit disk D is normal, in the sense of Lehto
and Virtanen [164, p. 86], if and only if f(z) does not possess a sequence of
P-points.
We shall now state the conditions for f(z) ∈ O(Ω) to be normal. For this
purpose, we introduce
Definition 4.7.7. Let f(z) be a holomorphic function in a domain Ω ⊂ C
n.
A sequence of points {pj} of the domain Ω is called a sequence of P-pointP-point Sequences 121
for the function f(z) if for each ε > 0 and each subsequence {pk} ⊂ {pj} the
function f(z) assumes every value, with at most one exception, infinitely often
in the union of balls Bc(pk, ε) = {cΩ(pk, z) < ε : z ∈ Ω}.
For f ∈ O(Ω), set
|∇f(z)| = sup 
|f∗(v)| · (F
C
Ω (z, v))−1
: v ∈ C
n
\ {0}
	
,
where f∗ = df is the differential of f at point z ∈ Ω.
It is obvious that this quantity |∇f(z)| is well defined for bounded domains
in C
n and is invariant under biholomorphic maps of Ω.
We now state our main result.
Theorem 4.7.8. (see [59]) A function f(z) holomorphic in a bounded domain
Ω ⊂ C
n has a P-point sequence if and only if
limz→∂Ω |∇f(z)|

Proof. Sufficiency. Suppose that there is a subsequence {p
j}, p
j ∈ Ω, j =
1, 2, . . ., which converges to some point ξ ∈ ∂Ω such that

= +∞, (4.3)
but {p
j} is not a P-point sequence of f. Then there exist ε > 0 and a sub￾sequence {p
k} ⊂ {p
j} such that f(z) assumes every value, with at most two
exceptions, in the union of the balls ∪∞
k=1Bc(p
k
, ε).
Using the fact that the boundary ∂Ω is a doubly smooth compact hy￾persurface, we have the number r > 0 possessing the following property: the
inclusion
Bζ (r) ⊂ Ω,
where Bζ (r) is a Euclidean ball of radius r, whose boundary contains the point
ζ ∈ ∂Ω, is valid for any points ζ ∈ ∂Ω. Let
Ωr = {z ∈ Ω : δ(z, ∂Ω) < r} .
For any point z ∈ Ωr a ball B0
z = B(z
0
(z), r) will be found contained in Ωr
and such a one that δ(z, ∂Ω) = δ(z, ∂Bz).
By Lemma 4.7.2, for any point ζ ∈ ∂Ω, there exist a neighborhood W
such that the domain U = Ω ∩ W is biholomorphically equivalent to a convex
domain in C
n; by Lemma 4.7.4 F
C
U
is equivalent to F
C
Ω . Since our considera￾tions are in neighborhood of ξ, without loss of generality we assume that the
boundary of domain Ω in a neighborhood of ξ is convex. It follows that for
any point ζ ∈ ∂Ω sufficiently close to ξ a ball B(ζ
00, R) exists with a center at
some point ζ
00 ∈ C
n, so that
Ω ⊂ B(ζ
00, R),122 Normal Functions in C
n
ζ ∈ ∂B(ζ
00, R). From this condition it follows that regardless of the nature of
the point w ∈ Ω a ball B00
w = B(ζ
00(w), R) will be also found containing the
domain Ω and a ball such that δ(w, ∂Ω) = δ(w, ∂B00
w).
Denote by ξ(z) the point on ∂Ω such that
|z − ξ(z)| = inf {ω ∈ ∂Ω : |z − ω|} = δ(z, ∂Ω).
Let us take any point z
0 ∈ Ωr. After a possible translation and unitary linear
transformation hz
0 in the ambient space C
n, we may assume that the point
ξ(z
0
) is the origin, that the outward unit normal at ξ(z
0
) is in the negative
yn direction, (here zn = xn + iyn) and thus Nc

(z

later 0
z = (z1, . . . , zn−1)), while T

According to our initial assumption this means that for each m ∈ N and each

there is a positive constant K such that

which completes the proof
This theorem was motivated by a theorem of V.I. Gavrilov [82] about
P-point sequences.
The argument used here goes back to an idea which can be found in [234].
It follows from the definition of a normal function that Theorem 4.7.8 gives a
criterion for a holomorphic function defined in a strictly pseudoconvex domain
to be a normal function.
We deal with a proven theorem in which one gets sufficient conditions for
two limiting values of a function which is bounded and holomorphic in the
unit disk D, corresponding to two different sequences of points of D, to be
equal [267]. In this paper we prove a generalization of this theorem of Seidel to
the case of bounded holomorphic functions in strictly pseudoconvex domains
of the space C
n.
We shall prove the following theorem:
Theorem 4.7.9. Let Ω be a strictly pseudoconvex domain in C
n, (n ≥ 1),
A ∈ C and let the function f ∈ H∞(Ω) which omits the value A in domain
Ω. Let us assume that {am} and {bm} are two sequences of points of Ω, such
that
lim m→∞
am = ξ ∈ ∂Ω and lim m→∞
bm = ξ.
If the Carathéodory distance cΩ(am, bm) is less than a constant ε, independent
of m
cΩ(am, bm) < ε, m = 1, 2, . . . ,
and
lim m→∞
f(am) = A,
then also
lim m→∞
f(bm) = A.
If Ω is the unit disk D, then, as is known, the distance in the Carathéodory
metric cD coincides with the distance in the metric of the Poincaré disk D, so
if n = 1 our theorem is precisely Seidel’s theorem of [267, Theorem 3, p. 10].
The proof of our theorem is given for the case n > 1; the only difference
between the one-dimensional case and the multidimensional one is the richerP-point Sequences 125
geometry of balls with respect to the standard invariant Caratheodory metric
of multidimensional domains. It will be clear from the proof that the geometric
conditions cΩ(am, bm) < ε, m = 1, 2, . . ., mean that for all sufficiently large
numbers m, the points bm lie inside ellipsoids with centers at the points am,
whose semiaxes in the normal and tangential directions are equal to
−k1ερ(am) and k1ε
p
−ρ(am)
respectively.
Here and everywhere below k`, ` = 1, . . . , will denote certain positive
constants.
Proof of Theorem 4.7.9. Let g(z) = f(z) − A. We can without loss of gener￾ality assume that the upper bound M of |g(z)| in Ω is 1. It follows from the
definition of the infinitesimal form of the Carathéodory metric that, for all
z ∈ Ω, v ∈ C
n,
|dg(v)| ≤ F
C
Ω (z, v). (4.6)
From this, using the definition of the Levi form, we get
Lz(log(1 + |g|
2
), v) ≤ (F
C
Ω (z, v))2
.
The function g(z) 6= 0 and is holomorphic in the domain Ω, so the func￾tion log |g(z)|
2
is pluriharmonic there—since the Levi form vanishes for any
pluriharmonic function,
We now calculate that
Lz(log(1 + |1/g|
2
), v) =
Lz(log(1 + |g|
2
), v) − 2Lz(log |g|, v) ≡
Lz(log(1 + |g|
2
), v).
From this identity and (4.6), we get that the function h(z) = 1/g(z) satisfies
Lz(log(1 + |h|
2
), v) ≤ (F
C
Ω (z, v))2
(4.7)
for all z ∈ Ω, v ∈ C
n. Without loss of generality we can assume that the
defining function ρ of the domain Ω is such that
∂ρ(ξ)
∂zµ
= 0, µ = 1, 2, . . . , n − 1;
∂ρ(ξ)
∂zn
= 1. (4.8)
For each point ζ ∈ ∂Ω, belonging to some neighborhood U of the point ξ, we
make the linear transformation:
h
ζ =
(
wµ =
∂ρ(ξ)
∂zn
(zµ − ζµ) −
∂ρ(ξ)
∂zµ
(zn − ζn), µ = 1, 2, . . . , n − 1;
wn =
Pn
µ=1
∂ρ(ξ)
∂zn
(zµ − ζµ).126 Normal Functions in C
n
If the neighborhood U of the point ξ is sufficiently small then, in view of (4.8),
the transformation h
ζ
is nondegenerate. In coordinates w the complex tangent
plane T
c
ζ
(∂Ω) to ∂Ω at the point ζ has the form {wn = 0}, and the complex
normal Nc
ζ
(∂Ω) to ∂Ω at the point ζ coincides with the set {w ∈ C
n :
0w = 0}.
By the hypothesis of the theorem, the domain Ω is strictly pseudoconvex
so by Theorem 4.7.6 for all z ∈ ∂Ω, sufficiently close to ∂Ω,

where πT (v) and πN (v) are the projections of v onto the complex tangent
plane and the complex normal to ∂Ω at the boundary point ξ = ξ(z) closest
to z.
We let ξm = ξ(am), δm = δ(am), and h
m = h
ξm. Under the map h
m the
ball in the Carathéodory metric BC

From (4.11) and the Marty normality criterion we conclude that the family of
functions {Fm} is normal in the ball Bk7ε(
00, 1). Since Fm(
00, 1) = (f(am) −
A) → ∞ as m → ∞, the functions Fm converge uniformly on compact subsets
of Bk7ε(
00, 1) to infinity identically, so it is easy to see that limm→∞ f(bm) =
A.
4.8 Lohwater-Pommerenke’s Theorem in C
n
In the one-dimensional case there are many criteria known for a meromorphic
function to be normal, and Lohwater and Pommerenke [176] add a very valu￾able criterion to this list: a nonconstant function f meromorphic in the unit
disk D ⊂ C is normal if and only if there do not exist sequences {zn} and
{ρn} with zn ∈ D, ρn > 0, ρn → 0, such that
limn→∞
f(zn + ρnt) = g(t)
locally uniformly in C, where g(t) is a nonconstant meromorphic function in
C.
The following criterion is essentially a reformulation of (4.10).
Theorem 4.8.1. Let Ω be a bounded domain in C
n. Let F be either the
infinitesimal Carathéodory or Kobayashi metrics on Ω. If f : Ω → C is a
F-normal holomorphic function, then for every choice of sequence {pj} in Ω
and {rj}, rj > 0, with limj→∞ rj/δj = 0, where δj is the Euclidean distance
function from pj to ∂Ω, the sequence {f(pj +rj ζ)} converges locally uniformly
to a constant function in C
n.
Proof. Set Rj = δj/rj . It is clear that Rj → ∞. Without restriction we can
assume that Rj > j. Let ζ ∈ C
n. Then, for all |ζ| < j, we have
|(pj + rj ζ) − pj | = rj |ζ| < δj
so that pj + rj ζ ∈ B(pj , δj ) ⊂ Ω. Hence gj (ζ) := f(pj + rj ζ) is a holomorphic
function on the ball B(0, j) = {ζ ∈ C
n : |ζ| < j}.
Suppose that f is normal in Ω. By definition, ”f is normal” means that
there is a positive constant C such that
Lz(log(1 + |f|
2
), v) ≤ C · (FΩ(z, v))2
for all (z, v) ∈ Ω × C
n.128 Normal Functions in C
n
By the distance-decreasing property, we have
FΩ(z, v) ≤ FB(pj ,δj )(z, v)
for all (z, v) ∈ B(pj , δj ) × C
n.
Recall that
FB(pj ,δj )(z, v) =
[(δ

2
)|v|
2 + |(z − pj , v)|
2
]
1/2
δ
2
j − |z − pj |
2
.
As a result, we may use Schwarz’s inequality to obtain that
FB(pj ,δj )(z, v) ≤
δj |v|
δ
2
j − |z − pj |
2
.
From the above two inequalities, we obtain the inequality
FΩ(z, v) ≤
δj |v|
δ
2
j − |z − pj |
2
for all (z, v) ∈ B(pj , δj ) × C
n.
Therefore
q
Lpj+rj ζ (log(1 + |fj |
2), v) ≤
√
Cδj |v|
δ
2
j − |rj ζ|
2

Remark 4.8.2. In a sense, the wheel has come full circle. Theorem 4.8.1 shows
that the concept of normal holomorphic function of several complex variables
(see Definition 4.2.7) is equivalent to the privious one (see Definition 4.2.1)
and allows one to attribute to one function the properties related to some class
of functions, namely with a normal family of holomorphic functions defined
on the unit ball in C
n.
Theorem 4.8.1 may be rephrased as follows:
Corollary 4.8.3. Let Ω be a bounded domain in C
n. Let F be either the
infinitesimal Carathéodory or Kobayashi metric on Ω. If f : Ω → C is a
holomorphic function, and there exist sequences {pj} in Ω and {rj}, rj > 0,
with limj→∞ rj/δj = 0, where δj is the Euclidean distance function from pj
to ∂Ω, such that {f(pj + rj ζ)} converges locally uniformly to a nonconstant
holomorphic function in C
n, then f is not F-normal.
The proofs of Theorem 4.8.1 and Corollary 4.8.3 given in [101] follow
closely the method of [176]. Unfortunately several inaccuracies occur in [101],
e.g., in [101, Theorem 2] concerning the selection of convergent subsequences
of normal families.
Theorem 4.8.4. Let Ω be a bounded domain in C
n. Let F be either the
infinitesimal Carathéodory or Kobayashi metrics on Ω. A nonconstant function
f holomorphic on Ω is not F-normal if there exist sequences zj ∈ Ω, ρj =
1/f]
(zj ) → 0, such that the sequence
gj (ζ) = f(zj + ρj ζ)
converges locally uniformly in C
n to a nonconstant entire function g satisfying
g

Proof. Definition 4.2.7 imply that there is a positive constant C such that
Lz(log(1 + |f|
2
), v) ≤ C · (FΩ(z, v))2
for all (z, v) ∈ Ω × C
n.
Let {pj} be an arbitrary sequence of points in Ω. Then B(pj , δj ) ⊂ Ω. By
the distance-decreasing property,
FΩ(z, v) ≤ FB(pj ,δj )(z, v)
for all (z, v) ∈ B(pj , δj ) × C

for all j and all ζ ∈ B(0, 1). By Marty’s criterion (Theorem [68, Theorem
2.1]), the family {gj (ζ)} is normal in the unit ball B(0, 1).
So if f is not an F-normal function in Ω, then there exists a sequence {pj}
in Ω such that {gj (ζ) := f(pj + δj ζ)} is not a normal sequence at a point,
say, ζ0, ζ0 ∈ B(0, 1). It follows from Zalcman’s lemma [68, Theorem 3.1] that
there exist ζj → ζ0, ρj = 1/g]
j
(ζj ) → 0, such that the sequence
gj (ζ) = f(pj + δj (ζj + ρj ζ))

converges locally uniformly in C

(ζ) ≤ g

(0) = 1. It follows that zj = pj + δj ζj , ρj = 1/f]
(pj + δj ζj ) satisfy
our conditions. This completes the proof of Theorem 4.8.4.
Remark 4.8.5. Lohwater and Pommerenke [176, Theorem 1] originally stated
their theorem with no restriction on the speed at which ρn → 0. In proving
their theorem they assert, “if f is normal and f(zn + ρnζ) → g(ζ) locally
uniformly, then ρn/(1 − |zn|) → 0”. The statement in quotes is false as one
can see from the example f(z) = z, zn = 1 − n

In general we can not even assert that limj→∞ f

reason that the true generalization of Lohwater-Pommerenke’s theorem to the
higher-dimensional setting most likely breaks down. See also [101] and [33,
Remark 6.1, p. 68].
4.9 The Scaling Method
One of the most useful and most profound techniques in the study of auto￾morphism groups of domains is the scaling method (also called the flattening
method by some geometers). This is a rather profound application of normal
families, and we take the opportunity to describe it here.
This description will be rather informal, and not detailed. But it will give
the reader an idea of how the method works. And we shall provide references
for further reading. We particularly recommend [93].The Scaling Method 131
Let D be the open unit disk in the complex plane C. Choose a sequence
aj in D satisfying the conditions
0 < aj < aj+1 < 1, ∀j = 1, 2, . . . ,
and
lim
j→∞
aj = 1.
Define the sequence of dilations
Lj (z) = 1
1 − aj
(z − 1).
We write λj = 1 − aj . Then
Lj (D) = {ζ ∈ C : (1 + λj ζ)(1 + λj
¯ζ) < 1}
= {ζ ∈ C : 2 Reζ < −λj |ζ|
2
}.
Hence the sequence of sets Lj (D) converges to the left half-plane H = {ζ ∈
C : Reζ < 0} in the sense that
Lj (D) ⊂ Lj+1(D), ∀j = 1, 2, . . . ,
and
[∞
j=1
Lj (D) = H.
Now we combine this simple observation with the fact that there exists
the sequence of maps
ϕj (z) ≡
z + aj
1 + aj z
that are automorphisms of D satisfying ϕj (0) = aj . Consider the sequence of
composite maps
σj ≡ Lj ◦ ϕj : D → C.
A simple computation yields that
Lj ◦ ϕj (z) = 1
1 − aj

z + aj
1 + aj z
− 1

=
z − 1
1 + aj z
.
Hence we see that the sequence of holomorphic mappings Lj ◦ ϕj converges
uniformly on compact subsets of D to the mapping
σb(z) = z − 1
z + 1132 Normal Functions in C
n
that is a biholomorphic mapping from the open unit disk D onto the left half
plane H.
What we have done here is to produce the classical Cayley map using
scaling.
Of course scaling is most interesting, and most effective, when it is applied
in the function theory of several complex variables. Let us now formulate one
of the most famous theorems that can be proved with scaling.
Definition 4.9.1. Let Ω ⊆ C
n be a domain in space. Let ξ ∈ ∂Ω. We say
that ξ is a boundary orbit accumulation point if there exist biholomorphic self
maps ϕj : Ω → Ω and a point ζ ∈ Ω such that ϕj (ζ) → ξ as j → ∞.
The famous theorem of Bun Wong and Rosay ([250, 286]) says this:
Theorem 4.9.2. Let Ω ⊆ C
n be a bounded domain. Suppose that ξ ∈ ∂Ω has
a smooth neighborhood in the boundary and is strongly pseudoconvex. If ξ is
a boundary orbit accumulation point, then Ω is biholomorphic to the unit ball
in C
n.
This result has been generalized by Greene/Krantz and others to finite type
boundary orbit accumulation points. These studies have led to the following
conjecture of Greene/Krantz:
CONJECTURE: Let Ω ⊆ C
n be a bounded domain and let P ∈ ∂Ω have
a smooth boundary neighborhood and be a boundary orbit accumulation
point. Then P is of finite type in the sense of Catlin/D’Angelo/Kohn
(see [50]).
4.10 Asymptotic Values of Holomorphic Functions
After the appearance of the paper by Lehto and Virtanen [164], one of the
main directions of research was simply to test various properties of bounded
holomorphic functions in order to establish the same properties for normal
functions, or to construct examples of normal functions that do not have this
property.
The most important work related to normal functions was published by
MacLane [181], who considered the general question of the asymptotic values
of holomorphic functions. It should be noted here that there is a natural
division in the study of normal functions into normal meromorphic functions
(which may not have asymptotic values) and normal holomorphic functions;
the study of the latter is more fruitful, since a holomorphic function always
has at least one asymptotic value.
The purpose of this section is to list some results on the asymptotic values
of functions f(z) holomorphic in the unit disk D and give example showing
that some of these results do not hold in the multidimensional case.Asymptotic Values of Holomorphic Functions 133
It should be observed that all the results are for holomorphic functions.
The arguments break down in various places for meromorphic functions. In
particular, nothing in the nature of Theorem 4.10.4 can hold for meromorphic
functions, for, as was shown in [183], there exist meromorphic functions with￾out any asymptotic values for which Nevanlinna original characteristic T(r)
grows arbitrarily slowly.
Definition 4.10.1. We shall say that f has the asymptotic value a at ζ,
|ζ| = 1, if and only if there is an arc Γ ⊂ D tending to ζ such that f → a on
Γ.
Let f(z) be holomorphic and nonconstant in D. For any complex number
a (a = ∞ permitted) we define the set Aa as follows. The point ζ belongs to
Aa if and only if |ζ| = 1 and f has the asymptotic value a at ζ. See (4.10.1).
If S is any set on the Riemann sphere, we set
A(S) = ∪
a∈S
Aa, A(S) = ∅ if S = ∅.
In particular we set
A
∗ = ∪
a6=∞
Aa, A = A
∗ ∪ A∞.
Definition 4.10.2. The function f(z) belongs to the class N if and only if
f is holomorphic, nonconstant, in D, and normal.
Definition 4.10.3. The function f(z) belongs to the class A if and only if f
is holomorphic and nonconstant in D and A is dense in ∂D.
Section 7 of MacLane’s book [181] is devoted to deriving some sufficient
conditions for f ∈ A. The fundamental condition, Theorem 4.10.4, is
(I)
Z 1
0
(1 − r) log+

A more restrictive condition is

Theorem 4.10.4. Let f(z) be holomorphic, nonconstant, in D and satisfy
(I). Then f ∈ A.
Remark 4.10.5. The hypothesis (I) in Theorem 4.10.4 may be replaced by
either (II) or (III).
It is well known that the characteristic function, T(r), of f(z) is given by
the formula
T(r) = S(r) + O(1)

Theorem 4.10.6. We have N ⊂ A and the inclusion is proper. Also, if
f ∈ N , then:
Given ζ, |ζ| = 1, f has at most one asymptotic value at ζ. If f has the
asymptotic value a at ζ then f has the angular limit a at ζ.
Remark 4.10.7. Lehto and Virtanen gave an example [164, p. 58] of a normal
function without any asymptotic values. But that function is meromorphic,
not holomorphic, and Theorem 4.10.4 shows that such must be the case.
Proof. We assume that the nonconstant holomorphic function f satisfies (4.2)
and prove that f ∈ A.
Then from (4.2) we have

Since f(z) is holomorphic,
T(r) = S(r) + O(1) < C2
log 1
1 − r
+ O(1) (0 ≤ r < 1) (4.1)
where T(r) is the Nevanlinna characteristic function of f. It is immediately
clear from (4.1) that T(r) satisfies condition (II), and hence f ∈ A.
Next, the assertion in 4.10.6 follows immediately from Theorem 4.10.9
below. It is then clear that the inclusion N ⊂ A is proper. For in [182] it was
shown that there exist holomorphic functions of arbitrarily slow growth (and
hence some that satisfy condition (III)) without any radial limits.
Asymptotic values always imply angular limits, but we cannot say anything
about the existence of asymptotic values. In fact, there exist normal functions
which possess no asymptotic values at all.
Lehto and Virtanen [164, Theorem 1, p.49-52] prove the following theorem.Asymptotic Values of Holomorphic Functions 135
Theorem 4.10.8. Let f(z) be meromorphic in D. Suppose that f(z) has the
asymptotic value zero along a Jordan curve lying in D and terminating at a
point ξ in ∂D and that f(z) does not possess the angular limit zero at the point
ξ. Then there exists a Jordan curve L in D with end-point at ξ, on which f(z)
tends to zero, and a sequence of points {zn}, in D, which converges to ξ and
at which f (zn) = a for a certain value a = 0 6 , such that the points zn have a
bounded hyperbolic distance from L less than M, where M is any fixed positive
number.
As an immediate consequence of the above theorem, we have
Theorem 4.10.9. Let f(z) be meromorphic and normal in ∂D and let f(z)
have an asymptotic value α at a point ξ on ∂D along a Jordan curve lying in
D. Then, f(z) possesses the angular limit α at the point ξ.
Proof. 4 Without loss of generality, we may suppose that α = 0. Contrary
to the assertion, suppose that f(z) does not possess the angular limit zero
at ξ. Consider now the asymptotic path L and the sequence of points {zn}
in Theorem 4.10.8. Denote by z
0 = Sn(z) a function which maps D confor￾mally onto itself and satisfies the condition Sn(0) = zn. We denote by K
the hyperbolic circle with center at z = 0 and of hyperbolic radius M + 1.
By hypothesis, the family {f (Sn(z))} is normal in D; hence, we can select a
subsequence {f (Snk
(z))} which converges uniformly on every compact subset
of D to a meromorphic function ϕ(z) in D. Since the images of the arcs of
L mapped by the inverse functions z = S
−1
nk
(z
0
) into the interior of K has
at least one accumulation continuum γ, it follows that ϕ(z) = 0 on γ and
therefore ϕ(z) vanishes identically. However, this is a contradiction, because
f (Snk
(0)) = a = 0 6 .
Now the following question arises. Is it clear that there is a holomorphic
function on the disk/ball that is not normal? Example 4.10.10 shows that a
holomorphic function might fail to be normal.
Example 4.10.10. Let B be the unit ball in C
2
. The function
f(z1) =
exp z1+1
z1−1
z1 − 1
is holomorphic in the unit disk D = {z1 ∈ C : |z1| < 1} and tends to ∞ when
z1 → 1 along the path |z1 − 1/2| = 1/2 and tends to 0 when z1 → 1 along
the radius. By Noshiro-Lehto-Virtanen’s theorem about asymptotic values of
normal functions (Theorem 4.10.9) f(z1) is not a normal holomorphic function
in D.
Since the normality of the function remains a hereditary property under
projections this example also shows that f(z1) considered as a holomorphic
functions in B is not normal in B (use Corollary 4.2.16).
4An entirely similar argument was used in [226]. See also related results of Seidel [266].136 Normal Functions in C
n
Let p(r) be a function on [0, 1) such that 0 < p(r) ↑ ∞. It was shown
in [182, Theorem 2, p. 23] that there exists a function f(z) holomorphic in D
for which f(|z|) < p(|z|), 0 ≤ |z| < 1 and which has no radial limit at every
point ξ ∈ ∂D.
Lehto and Virtanen also proved results which indicate that, in some sense,
the class of normal functions is the largest class for which the Lindelöf phe￾nomenon holds.
For example, if f is meromorphic in D and has a nontangential limit at ξ,
then in each Stolz angle Γα(ξ) = {z ∈ D : |z − ξ| < α(1 − |z|)} we have
|f
0
(z)|
1 + |f(z)|
2 = O

as |z| → 1. Since the hyperbolic (Poincaré) metric on D is
ρ(z) = 1
1 − |z|
2 = O
 1
1 − |z|

,
this is a local version of (4.2).
Some of the basic theorems and concepts of complex analysis generalize to
several complex variables, but many others do not.
Normal holomorphic functions in the plane have many remarkable prop￾erties that are not shared by their higher-dimensional analogues. Attempts to
generalize these special results even to two-dimensional complex space seem
doomed to failure, although some open questions of this sort still remain.
In fact, Lehto–Virtanen’s theorem is false in dimensions higher than two.
The following simple example (probably due to Čhirka [48] but discovered
independently by several others, see Cima and Krantz [47]) shows that The￾orem 4.10.9 is not true in several complex variables, and even bounded holo￾morphic functions (which are normal, since they omits two different values in
D) can have asymptotic limits along curves other than radial ones.
Example 4.10.11. Let B ⊆ C
2 be the unit ball. Let f : B → C be given by
f (z1, z2) = z
2
2
1 − z1
.
The function f(z) is holomorphic in B and is bounded there, since
|f(z)| ≤ 1 − |z1|
2
1 − |z1|
≤ 2.
Then f has radial limit 0 at ξ = (1, 0) ∈ ∂B. However f does not have
asymptotic limit 0 at ξ — indeed, f possesses limit 1/λ along the surfaces
S =

1 − z1 = λz2
2
	
, λ ∈ C and |λ| ≥ 1/2 which belong to B and are tangent
to ∂B at the point ξ. Indeed f|S ≡ 1/λ. It is straightforward to compute that
the set of all asymptotic values of f at ξ contains a closed disk of radius 1.Asymptotic Values of Holomorphic Functions 137

approaches ξ = (1, 0), however f
m|S ≡ 1/λ while f

has radial limit 0 at ξ.
This example demonstrates the failure of the Noshiro-Lehto-Virtanen the￾orem (Theorem 4.10.9) in C
2
, even for bounded holomorphic functions.
Definition 4.10.12. If f is any function with domain the ball B, and 0 < r <
1, then fr denotes the dilated function defined for |z| < 1/r by fr(z) = f(rz).
A function f ∈ O(B) is in the Hardy space Hp
(B) (0 < p < ∞) provided
that
sup
0<r<1
Z
∂B
|fr|
p
dσ < ∞. (4.2)
In the latter case, we write kfkp for the pth root of the left side of (4.2).
This is evidently a norm when p ≥ 1, and kf − gk
p
p defines a metric when
0 < p < 1.
Clearly, Hp1 ⊂ Hp2
if p1 > p2. Note that H∞ ⊂ H1
.
It may be of interest to compare the class of normal holomorphic functions
with Hardy space Hp
.
It follows from the definition that bounded functions are always normal.
Hence Hardy space Hp has nonempty intersection with the class N for every
0 < p < ∞.
The first question that we need to consider is: Is there an unbounded
normal function on B which is in the Hardy space H1
(B)? The answer to this
question is given by the following example.
Example 4.10.13. Let B be the unit ball in C
2
. Set
f(z) = (1 − z1)
−1/2
,
then f ∈ O(B).
We now show that this function is in the Hardy space H1
(B). Let σ denote
the usual rotationally invariant measure on ∂B and let m denote area measure
on D. Then, for fixed r < 1, integrating over the slices z1 = constant (see138 Normal Functions in C

(Here and below dφ denote the differential of function φ defined on [−π, π].)
The latter integral is bounded (independently of r), and therefore f ∈ H1
(B).
The explicit calculation (which we perform below) shows that the Levi
form of log(1 + |f|
2
) at z is
Lz(log(1 + |f|
2
), v) = |v1|
2
(1 + |1 − z1|)
2 ≤ 1 · |v|
2
for all z ∈ B and all v ∈ C
2
.
From the definition of the normal function we see that f(z) is a normal func￾tion in B.
Hence the intersection of the Hardy space H1
(B) with the class of normal
holomorphic functions in B contains the unbounded normal function f defined
above.

(D) coincide
with the class of normal holomorphic functions in the unit disk D.
A fundamental fact about a normal holomorphic function f of one complex
variable is that f can posses only one asymptotic value at the boundary point
ξ. Theorem 4.10.9 implies that no normal function in the unit disk can have
more than one asymptotic value at any boundary point. This is false if the unit
disk is replaced by the unit ball; the function f mentioned in Example 4.10.11
has every c with |c| < 1 as an asymptotic value at (1, 0), even though |f| ≤ 2.
Example 4.10.11 shows that there is a major difference between the bound￾ary behavior of the normal holomorphic functions of one and several variables.
When n ≥ 2, even bounded holomorphic functions (which is definitely nor￾mal) can posses infinitely many asymptotic values at a fixed boundary point,
which is impossible in one complex variable by Theorem 4.10.9.
But we will see in the next section that we still have uniqueness if we
restrict ourselves to special ξ-curves.Lindelöf Theorem in C

4.11 Lindelöf Theorem in C
n
Lehto and Virtanen [164] studied boundary behavior of normal meromorphic
functions by applying Montel’s theory of normal families and the theory of
hyperbolic measure.
The primary motivation for this investigation is an important theorem of
Lindelöf (see [37, Vol 2, p. 42]).
Theorem 4.11.1. (Lindelöf). Let f be a bounded analytic function in the
open unit disk, D, of the complex plane with associated boundary function
f(e
iθ). If
ess lim f(e
iθ) = 0 as θ → 0
+( or 0
−)
then f(z) tends to zero in every “Stolz angle” at 1.
For smooth domains in C
n the analogous theorem for bounded holomor￾phic functions holds, and one can even supplant cones with the wider class
of so-called hypoadmissible approach regions, allowing tangential approach to
the boundary in certain directions [48].
In [60] we restrict to the class of strongly pseudoconvex domains in C
n but
extend the class of functions from bounded holomorphic functions to normal
holomorphic functions; in this setting we prove that if f has a limit along one
nontangential path terminating at a boundary point ξ then f has a limit at
ξ within any hypoadmissible region.
The following terminology describes the limiting behavior involved in this
circle of ideas.
Let Ω be a bounded domain in C
n and δ(z, ∂Ω) the Euclidean distance
from the point z to the boundary of the domain.
Let Tξ = Tξ(∂Ω) be the tangent plane to the boundary of domain Ω at
the point ξ and νξ be the unit outward normal. Tξ contains a unique complex
hyperplane T
c
ξ
passing through ξ; this T
c
ξ
is called the complex tangent plane
to ∂Ω at the point ξ, while the vectors parallel to it are called complex-valued
tangent vectors at this point. The distance up to T
c
ξ
in C
n equals |hz − ξ, νξi|
where ha, bi = a1b1 + · · · + anbn is the Hermitian scalar product in C
n, whose
real part coincides with the usual scalar product in R2n = C
n.
By δξ(z) we denote the minimum of the distances from point z to ∂Ω and
to the tangent plane Tξ; then the nontangential limit value at a point ξ is the
limit value over the sets
Cα(ξ) = {z ∈ Ω : |z − ξ| < (1 + α)δξ(z)} , α > 0.
Of course, the term “nontangential” refers to the fact that the boundary
curves of Cα(ξ) have a corner at ξ, with angle less than π.140 Normal Functions in C
n
A function f is said to have a nontangential limit at ζ if limz→ζ f(z) exists
in each nontangential region Γ(ζ, α).
A set A ⊂ Ω is said to be asymptotic if A has limit points belonging to ∂Ω,
asymptotic at the point ξ if A ∩ ∂Ω = {ξ}, and nontangentially asymptotic at
the point ξ if A ⊂ Cα(ξ) for some α > 0. An asymptotic curve at the point ξ
is a curve {γ(t) : 0 < t < 1} ⊂ Ω such that limt→1 γ(t) = ξ.
The Lindelöf principle, even for normal functions, is not really a theorem
about automorphisms of domains or about normal families (as in [164]). Indeed
it is in the nature of a Schwarz lemma, i.e., it exploits metric inequalities. The
results below depend in an essential way on the one-variable Lehto-Virtanen
result, but the proof of that result consists primarily of a careful study of the
hyperbolic metric. The portions of the Lehto-Virtanen proof which involve
normal families arguments may be entirely recast in metric terms.
Lemma 4.11.2. Let Ω ⊂⊂ C
n have C
2
boundary. Let f : Ω → Cb be K-normal
and ξ ∈ ∂Ω. Let ` ∈ Cb and suppose that f has radial limit ` at ξ. Then f has
non-tangential limit ` at ξ.
Proof. Let α > 1. Let Γeα(P) = Γα(P)∩Cνξ. By Proposition 1.6, f|Γ˜α(ξ)∩B(ξ,)
is normal in the classical one variable sense for some small  > 0. So, by the
classical theorem of Lehto-Virtanen,
lim
Γ˜α(P )3z→ξ
f(z) = ` .
Let Tp denote the Hermitian orthogonal complement to Cνξ. By elementary
geometry there is a C0 > 0 so that if z ∈ Γ˜
α(ξ), |z − ξ| < C0, and π(z) ∈ TP ,
|π(z)| < C0
p
δΩ(z), then z + π(z) ∈ Ω. Let w ∈ Γα(P), |w − ξ| < C0/2. Let
w
0 be the orthogonal projection of w into Γ˜
α(P). Let q be the complex line
determined by w, w0
. Then q ⊆ TP + w

Remark 4.11.3. The same proof shows that the hypothesis “radial limit” may
be replaced by “limit along some non-tangential curve γ”.Lindelöf Theorem in C
n 141
At this point we can give the answer to the following question: Is there a
function f ∈ H1
(B) which is not normal? Lemma 4.11.2 allows us to answer
this question.
Example 4.11.4 (cf. [257, 8.4.7. Example, 173]). Define f in
B =

z ∈ C
2
: |z| < 1
	
by
f(z) = z2
1 − z1
.
Take a point (a, b) ∈ ∂B, a 6= 1, and consider the rectilinear path
Γ(t) = (t + (1 − t)a,(1 − t)b)
from (a, b) to (1, 0). On this path,
f(Γ(t)) ≡
b
1 − a
.
All rectilinear limits of f exist therefore at (1, 0), but they are not equal.
In fact, the set of limiting values is all of C. Since f(z1, 0) = 0, the radial limit
is 0 at (1, 0).
Then f is holomorphic in B and has radial limit zero at (1, 0) since
f(z1, 0) = 0 for all z1 ∈ D. Nevertheless f does not have non-tangential
limit at (1, 0). By Lemma 4.11.2, f cannot be normal in B.
We now estimate the H1
(B) norm of f. Let σ denote the usual rotationally
invariant measure on ∂B and let m denote area measure on D. Then, for fixed
r < 1, integrating over the slices z = constant (see Proposition 1.47 of [257,
Proposition 1.4.7, p.15]) we obtain

.142 Normal Functions in C
n
The latter integral is bounded (independently of r), and therefore f ∈
H1
(B).
By Lindelöf’s theorem, no normal function can behave in this way. It fol￾lows that the class N (B) is different from the Hardy space Hp
(B), p < 1.
In Lemma 4.3.2 we saw that if f(z) is a normal function on a ball B, and
g(z) is a bounded analytic function on B, then the sum f(z)+g(z) is a normal
function; the power [f(z)]j
for any integer j is also normal.
A natural question arises: To what extent is the class of normal functions
closed with respect to various arithmetic operations?
Lappan [162] showed that the sum of two normal functions in the unit
disk need not be normal, and that if f(z) is a normal meromorphic function
with an infinite set of poles, then there exists a Blaschke product B(z) such
that the product f(z)B(z) is no longer a normal function. The condition that
the functions in question omit three values does not help. Lappan [163] also
showed that these conclusions remain in force for holomorphic functions: the
sum of two normal analytic functions in D may not have Fatou points.
Having Example 4.11.4 at our disposal it is now quite obvious that the
class of normal functions is not closed under the operations of addition or
multiplication.
Example 4.11.5. Let B be the unit ball in C
2
. It is easy to check that
−2/(1 − z1) is a normal function on B. The sum of two normal holomorphic
functions in B need not be normal. Indeed, the sum of two normal functions
(z2 + 2)/(1 − z1) (which is normal by Lemma 4.3.3) and −2/(1 − z1) is equal
to z2/(1 − z1) which is not normal in B (see Example 4.11.4).
The product of two normal holomorphic functions z2 and 1/(1 − z1) is
equal to z2/(1 − z1) which is not normal (see Example 4.11.4).
The product of a bounded normal holomorphic function z2 and an un￾bounded non-normal holomorphic function z2/(1 − z1) is equal to z
2
2/(1 − z1)
which is a bounded holomorphic function in B, since |f(z)| ≤ |z
2
2
|/(1−|z1|) ≤
2, and is thus definitely normal.
For many of the basic function theory results in a bounded domains in
C
n, approach within a hypoadmissible region replaces nontangential approach.
Suppose that its boundary ∂Ω is a (compact) real hypersurface of class C
2
in
C

orthogonal to the complex tangent plane T

(S). We call such a function ρ a
global defining function.
For each fixed α > 0, k > 0, and ε, 0 < ε < 1/2, we define a hypoadmissible
region Aε,α, with vertex ξ, by the equation
Aε,α(ξ) = n

The domain Aε,α(ξ) is tangent to Tξ(S) in directions of the complex tangent

We shall say that f has a hypoadmissible limit at ζ if limz→ζ,z∈Aε,α
f(z)
exists for all α > 0.
For each fixed α > 0 and k > 0 we define a admissible region Aα(ξ), with
vertex ξ, by the equation
Aα(ξ) = n
z ∈ Ω : |(z − ξ, ν)| < (1 + α)δξ(z), |z − ξ| < kδξ

(z)
o
.
We shall say that f has a admissible limit at ζ if limz→ζ,z∈Aα
f(z) exists,
for all α > 0.
The notion of hypoadmissible limit arises because the full analogue of
Lindelof’s theorem, with admissible limits replacing nontangential limits, does
not hold for n > 1.
Remark 4.11.6. It is well known that for arbitrary tangent directions the
assertion of the full analogue of Lindelöf’s theorem becomes false: the function
f(z) = z
2
2/(1 − z1) is holomorphic in the unit ball B ⊂ C
2 and is bounded
(and hence normal) there, since |f(z)| ≤ |z
2
2
|/(1 − |z1|) ≤ 2, but as z tends
to the boundary point ξ = (1, 0) it has different limits along the surfaces
1 − z1 = λz2, tangent to ∂B at the point ξ.
The theorem is also false for domains with nonsmooth boundaries: the
function f(z) = z1/z2 is holomorphic and bounded in the domain {z ∈ C
n :
|z1| < |z2|}, but its limits as z → (0, 0) along different lines z1 = λz2 are
different.
The following theorem, a version of Cirka’s theorem, provides an adequate
substitute.
Theorem 4.11.7. If the function f is normal in a strictly pseudoconvex do￾main Ω ⊂ C
n and it has a limit along some nontangential asymptotic curve
at ξ ∈ ∂Ω, then it has the same limit as z → ξ through the points of Aε,α(ξ).
For strictly pseudoconvex domains in any dimension, the Bergman,
Caratheodory, and Kobayashi metrics are all comparable; such comparabil￾ity follows from the results of I. Graham [84] and K. Diederich [52]. Therefore
we can just talk about normal functions without specifying the infinitesimal
metric used in Definition 4.2.7. Nevertheless, suppose for the moment that f
is C-normal in Ω. The proof of Theorem 4.11.7 hinges on the classical one￾dimensional Lindelöf-Lehto-Virtanen’s theorem [164, Theorem 2, p. 53] and
the following lemma:144 Normal Functions in C
n
Lemma 4.11.8. Let Ω be a bounded domain in C
n and let {zj}, {z

} be two
sequences of points in Ω such that
lim

that the spherical distance between the points f(zj ) and f(z

) tends to zero
as j → ∞ and therefore the assertion of the lemma follows.
Proof of Theorem 4.11.7. After a possible translation and unitary linear
transformation in the ambient space C
n we may assume that the point ξ is the
origin, that the outward unit normal at 0 is in the negative y1 direction, (here
z1 = x1 + iy1) and thus Nc
ξ = {(z1, 0, . . . , 0)}, while T
c
ξ = {(0, z2, . . . , zn)}.
Denote by πξ the orthogonal projection of C
n to Nξ; that is if z =
(z1, . . . , zn) ∈ C
n, then πξ(z) = (z1, 0, . . . , 0).
Let {z(t) : 0 < t ≤ 1} ⊂ Ω be a nontangential asymptotic curve at a point
ξ along which f has a limit f(ξ). From the definition of the distance C
i
Ω we
have

Ω(z(t), πξ(z(t))) ≤

C
Ω (γ(`), γ˙(`))d`, (4.2)
where
γ(`) = (z1(t), `z2(t), . . . , `zn(t)), ` ∈ [0, 1].
By Theorem 4.7.6, since Ω is strictly pseudoconvex and the vector γ˙(`) =
(0, z2(t), . . . , zn(t)) is parallel to T
c
ξ
, we see that
F
C
Ω (γ(`), γ˙(`)) ≤ C ·
|γ˙(`)|
p
δ(γ(`))
. (4.3)
The curve {γ(t) : 0 < t < 1} ⊂ Ω belongs to some Cα(ξ), therefore
|γ˙(`)| ≤ |z(t)| < αδξ(z(t)) ≤ αδ(z(t)).Lindelöf Theorem in C
n 145
Since δ(z) is a continuous function in Ω there exist two constants c1, c2 such
that c1 ≤ δ(γ(`))/δ(z) ≤ c2 for all ` ∈ [0, 1]. From (4.2) and (4.3) we obtain
C
i
Ω(z(t), πξ(z(t))) ≤ C ·
p
δ(z(t)) → 0
as t → 0.
Since the boundary of Ω belongs to the class C
2
then there is a ball BR
with center in some point w(ξ) = (iR, 0, . . . , 0) and radius R such that BR ⊂ Ω
and ∂BR ∩ ∂Ω = {ξ}.
From the monotonicity property of the F

Ω we have
BR ⊂ Ω ⇒ F
C
Ω (z, v) ≤ F

Thus f(z1, 0, . . . , 0) is a normal function in the classical one-variable sense
(see [164, Theorem 3, p. 56]) which has limit f(ξ) along the nontangential
asymptotic curve π(z(t)) at the point ξ. By the classical Lindelöf-Lehto￾Virtanen’s theorem [164, Theorem 2, p. 53], f(πξ) has the angular limit f(ξ)
at the point ξ.
The same proof shows that
C
i
Ω(z, πξ(z)) ≤ C · δ
ε
(z) → 0
as z → ξ, z ∈ Aα(ξ). By Lemma 4.11.8 and the fact that the function f(π(z))
has the angular limit f(ξ) at the point ξ, we obtain that f has an admissible
limit at ξ.
Proposition 4.11.9. Let Ω be a strictly pseudoconvex domain in C
n, n > 1,
and assume that the normal function f has the limit of f(z) over a se￾quence {zm} ⊂ Aε,α(ξ) so that limm→∞ zm = ξ exists and is such that
limm→∞ cΩ(zm, zm+1) = 0. Then
lim
z→ξ,z∈Aε,α(ξ)
f(z) = f
∗
(ξ).
Proof. It is easy to see that the polygonal arc L with nodes at the points zm
belongs to some approach region Aε,β(ξ), β > α.
Since f is a normal function for all points z belonging to the segment
[zm, zm+1], the spherical distance between f(z) and f(zm) is
s(f(z), f(zm)) ≤ const · cΩ(z, zm). (4.4)146 Normal Functions in C
n
From the properties of the Caratheodory metric it follows that cΩ(z, zm) ≤
cΩ(zm, zm+1) + cΩ(z, zm+1). Hence it follows from (4.4) that the function f
has the limit f
∗
(ξ) along L. Now we find ourselves under the conditions of
Theorem 4.11.7, according to which
lim
z→ξ,z∈Aε,α(ξ)
f(z) = f

(ξ).
Lindelöf’s theorem for normal functions in C
n was proved by the first
author in [60]. See also J. A. Cima, and S. G. Krantz [47].
4.12 Lindelöf Principle in C
n
The most classical formulation of the Lindelöf principle on the disk (see [175])
is as follows:
Theorem: Let f be a bounded, holomorphic function on the unit disk
D ⊂ C. Suppose that the radial limit
lim
r→1−
f(reiθ) ≡ λ ∈ C (∗)
of f exists at the boundary point e
iθ. Then in fact f has nontangential
limit λ at e
iθ
.
Thus we have a sort of tauberian theorem: for bounded holomorphic functions,
radial convergence implies nontangential convergence. It is of interest to have
a result of this nature in several complex variables. Pioneering work on the
Lindelöf principle in several complex variables was done by Cirka [48].
The paper [47] established a Lindelöf principle for holomorphic functions
of several variables. That result was new and optimal in the following senses:
(i) It was proved for normal functions (see [164]), in a sense the most
natural function space for which to consider a Lindelöf principle.
(ii) It was formulated in terms of the Kobayashi metric, thus providing
an “optimal” result in terms of the intrinsic Levi geometry of the
domain.
But the result of [47] has certain drawbacks. Notable among these is that,
whereas the most natural mode of boundary convergence in the several vari￾able setting is admissible convergence (see [139, 140, 143, 270]), that used in
the results of [47] is hypoadmissible converge—a strictly weaker concept. In ad￾dition, when the radial curve, as in (∗), is replaced by a fairly arbitrary curve—
especially by a curve with a significant complex tangential component—then
a rather unsatisfying result obtains.Lindelöf Principle in C
n 147
In this section we introduce new techniques that address the shortcom￾ings of [47] and produce a sharp version of the Lindelöf principle. In common
with [47], we shall be able to prove our result not only for bounded holomor￾phic functions but also for normal functions. We refer the reader also to [2]
and [3] for modern work on the Lindelöf principle in several variables. Also
the paper [147] must be mentioned in this context.
We begin by proving the following proposition and discussing it.
Proposition 4.12.1. Let f be a bounded, holomorphic function on the unit
ball B ⊂ C
2
. Let
T = {(s + i0, t + i0) ∈ C

Let 1 = (1 + i0, 0 + i0). Suppose that
lim
T 3z→1
f(z) ≡ λ ∈ C
exists. Then, for any α > 1,
lim
Aα(1)3z→1
f(z) = λ .

Now consider the function
gj ≡ f ◦ ϕ
−1
j
: Ωj0 → C .
Being uniformly bounded, the gj form a normal family. Let g0 be a subse￾quential limit function.
It follows from our hypotheses that g0 vanishes on T ∩ Ωj0
. But T ∩ Ωj0
,
being two-dimensional and totally real, is a set of determinacy for holomorphic
functions. Hence g0 ≡ 0.
Unravelling the logic, we find that if K ⊂ Ωj0
is a compact set such that
[∞

j
(K) ⊇ Aα(1),
then gj → 0 uniformly on K. It follows that f itself has admissible limit 0 on
K.
The proof that we have just presented is misleadingly simple. For it is
an artifact of the special geometry of T, and the way that it is imbedded
in space, that ϕ
−1
j
(T ∩ Ωj ) = T ∩ Ωj0
for each j. For a very general sort of
Lindelöf principle, we would like to replace the flat T with a rather arbitrary,
two-dimensional, totally real surface. In that situation, the sets
ϕ
−1
j
(T ∩ Ωj )
could be pairwise disjoint. Thus additional arguments will be required. It is
worth noting that this problem arises even on the disk in the complex plane—
in the situation where the hypothesis of the Lindelöf principle is the existence
of a limit along a somewhat arbitrary curve rather than along a radius.
With these thoughts in mind, we now formulate a more sophisticated ver￾sion of the Lindelöf principle on the ball:
Proposition 4.12.2. Let f be a bounded, holomorphic function on the unit
ball B ⊂ C

This result is more nearly like the general Lindelöf principle that one may
find in [164, Theorem 2, p. 53]. It hypothesizes the existence of a limit along
a fairly “arbitrary” surface terminating at the boundary point 1 ∈ ∂B, and it
concludes the existence of an admissible limit. It still leaves open the question
of obtaining a result on more general domains, and also the question of treating
normal functions. We save those two topics for subsequent sections.
Proof. Let Ωj , φj , gj be as in the proof of the preceding proposition. As before,
we may assume that λ = 0 and we may obtain a subsequential limit function
g0.
But it is important for us now to note that the sets
Tj ∩ Ωj0 ≡ ϕj (T ∩ Ωj )
are all graphs over T ∩Ωj0 of functions τj , and each τj has, by design, bounded
derivatives (with the bound uniform in j). Thus we may extract (using the
Ascoli-Arzelà theorem) a subsequence τjk
that converges uniformly, along with
its first derivatives, on compacta to some τ0. We pass to a corresponding
subsequence of the gj s, and continue to call the limit function g0. Now let T0
be the graph of τ0.
It follows that T0 is a totally real, two-dimensional manifold. And certainly
g0 vanishes on T0. Thus g0 ≡ 0. Arguing as in the proof of Proposition 4.12.1,
we conclude that f has admissible limit 0 at 1.
We continue, for the moment, to work on the unit ball B ⊂ C
n. Recall
(see [47]) that a normal function has at least two equivalent definitions. Here
we let Cb denote the Riemann sphere.
Definition 4.12.3. Let f : B ⊂ Cb be holomorphic. We say that f is normal
if, whenever {ϕj} are biholomorphic self-maps of B then {f ◦ ϕj} is a normal
family.
In the paper [47] an important equivalent formulation was derived using
ideas from invariant geometry.
Definition 4.12.4. A holomorphic function f : B ⊂ Cb is normal if the
derivative ∇f is bounded from the Kobayashi metric on B (equivalently, the
Poincaré-Bergman metric on B) to the spherical metric on Cb.
The equivalence of these two definitions is a sophisticated exercise with
Marty’s theorem. Now we have
Proposition 4.12.5. Let B ⊂ Cb be the unit ball. Let f : B ⊂ Cb be holomor￾phic and normal. Let

Then we define Ωj0
as before but now we let
Ωj = Φj−j0
(Ωj0
).
Here Φ
`
is the mapping Φ composed with itself ` times, ` > 0.
Now the proof goes through just as that for Proposition 4.12.2. We merely
must note that now we are examining the mappings gj ≡ f ◦ Φ
−(j−j0)
. These
are compositions of f with automorphisms. By the definition of “normal func￾tion”, we may be sure that the gj form a normal family. The proof is completed
then as before.
It should be stressed that it is misleading, indeed essentially incorrect, to
think of normal functions on an arbitrary domain in terms of automorphisms
of the domain. For most domains in C or C
n have only the identity as an
automorphism (see [91] for a discussion of this notion). One of the main mo￾tivations for the development in [47] of normal functions using the Kobayashi
metric was to address this difficulty. Thus, if we wish to prove a Lindelöf
principle on general domains, we certainly cannot use the ideas in Section 3.
Instead we examine the invariant Kobayashi metric. Let us begin by look￾ing at a strongly pseudoconvex domain Ω with C
2 boundary. Let P ∈ ∂Ω.
By normalizing coordinates, we may assume as usual that P = e1 = (1, 0),
that Re z1 is the real normal direction, and that Im z1 is the complex normal
direction. Thus z2, . . . , zn are the complex tangential directions at P. For sim￾plicity, we assume as above that the dimension n = 2. Following the paradigmLindelöf Principle in C
n 151
in [84] or [74] (see also [143]), we may assume that there is an internally tan￾gent ball at P ∈ ∂Ω. There is no loss of generality to assume that this ball is
the unit ball. Thus we may define regions Ωj just as on the unit ball above.
And the maps ϕj are defined as before.
Theorem 4.12.6. Let Ω ⊂ C

be a domain with C

boundary. Let f : Ω → Cb
be holomorphic and normal. Let

Proof. It is propitious to consider a holomorphic mapping ψ : D → Ω0, where
D ⊂ C
n is the unit disk. If ψ(0) = p ∈ Ω0, then we may take ψ to be
an extremal function for the Kobayashi metric at the point p. Now look at

Of course the expression in brackets on the right is nothing other than the

as we know from the definition of “normal function”, is bounded from the
Kobayashi metric on Ω (which is smaller than the Kobayashi metric on Ωj ) to
the spherical metric on Cb. In sum, the expression (∗) is bounded on compact
subsets of D. And this bound is certainly independent of j.
So we may extract a normally convergent subsequence of µ

function µ0. Arguing now as in the proof of Proposition 4.12.2, we see that
there is a corresponding sub-subsequence τjk
convergin to τ0 and a limiting
totally real, two-dimensional manifold T0 in Ω0 which is the graph of τ0. Thus
we find that µ

converges on T0. Putting together the convergence of the
derivatives together with the convergence of the functions on T0, we see that
the functions themselves converge uniformly on compact subsets of Ω0. By
the usual logic, we find that f has admissible limit λ at P.152 Normal Functions in C

4.13 Admissible Limits of Normal Functions in C
n
The existence almost everywhere of admissible limits of bounded holomorphic
functions of several complex variables was established by Korányi [141] and
Stein [270]; the complex geometric nature of this phenomenon was studied
by Čhirka [48]. A natural generalization of the class of bounded holomorphic
functions is the class of normal holomorphic functions. However, it is known
that normal functions can have bad boundary behavior almost everywhere.
Montel [200] used normal families in a simple but ingenious way to inves￾tigate boundary behavior of holomorphic functions in angular domains. We
used his ideas in studying boundary behavior in the case of functions of several
complex variables.
The basic goal of the present section is to find conditions under which
normal functions of several complex variables have admissible limits almost
everywhere.
We have the following theorem:
Theorem 4.13.1. Let Ω be a domain in C
n, (n > 1) with C
2
-smooth bound￾ary and let the function f be normal in the domain Ω. If
lim
z→ξ,z∈Aβ(ξ)
f(z) exist for some β > 0,
then f has admissible limit at the point ξ.
For bounded holomorphic functions of several complex variables this result
was first proved by Čhirka [48]. One should note that although Theorem 4.13.1
contains the result of Čhirka we do not give a new proof of it but one essentially
based on the old proof.
Proof of Theorem 4.13.1. First let us assume that f has finite limit when z
tends to the point ξ remaining inside the domain Aβ(ξ).
We shall give a proof by contradiction. Let us first assume that one can
find a number α, α > β, and a sequence of points {a
m} ∈ Aα(ξ), a
m → ξ as
m → ∞ such that f(a
m) → ∞ as m → ∞.
We choose coordinates z1, . . . , zn in C
n, so that ξ = (0, . . . , 0) and ν0 =
(
00, . . . , 1). Here and later, 0
z = (z1, . . . , zn−1).
Let
Pc(z) = n

be a polydisk in C
n, with center at the point z. One can choose the number
c so that for all z ∈ Aα(ξ) sufficiently close to zero, one has Pc(z) ⊂ Aα(ξ).
(cf. [241, Lemmas 5.2, 7.2]).
Let π(z) = (00, zn) be the projection of the point z ∈ C
n to the complex
normal to ∂Ω at the point 0. For points z ∈ Aα(0) sufficiently close to zero, theAdmissible Limits of Normal Functions in C

ratio δ(z)/δ(π(z)) remains between two positive constants depending only on
α and Ω (cf. [241, Lemma 7.2]); hence, for all sufficiently large m, the segment
[a
m, π(a
m)] belongs to Aα(0) and it can be covered by a finite number of
polydisks Pc(a
1,m) ⊂ Aα(0) such that

the polydisk Pc(z) goes into the unit polydisk

Since the Kobayashi metric is invariant with respect to biholomorphic trans￾formations, we conclude from Definition 4.2.7 and Marty’s criterion that the
family of holomorphic functions

is normal in the polydisk P. By definition of a normal family, from the se￾quence {g
i,m} one can choose a subsequence converging uniformly inside P
(i.e., converging uniformly on compact subsets of P) either to a holomorphic
function, or identically to infinity. From (a) we conclude that the sequence
{g
2,m} also converges uniformly inside P identically to infinity. After a finite
number of steps, considering (b) we get that g
N,m(0) = f(π(a
m)) → ∞ as
m → ∞. But f(π(z)) is a normal function of one complex variable, so from
the statement about the finiteness of the limit with respect to Dβ(0) and the
theorem of Lehto and Virtanen [164], f(π(z)) has finite angular limit at zero.
The contradiction obtained shows that f, for any α > 0, is bounded in the
domain Aα(0) (each time by a constant). Applying the theorem of [48] to
the bounded function f|D2α
(0), analogously to Theorem 1, we conclude that
the limit of f with respect to Aα(0) exists; in view of the arbitrariness of α,
we see that f has admissible limit at zero.
Let us now assume that f has infinite limit when z tends to zero while
remaining inside the Dβ(0). From this assumption and the theorem of Lehto
and Virtanen [164] we conclude that f(π(z)) → ∞ as z → 0, z ∈ Aα(0). We
fix any α > 0 and any sequence {a
m} ⊂ Aα(0), as m → ∞. In condition (b)
we let a
1,m = π(a
m), and a
N,m = a
m. Just as above, the family {g
i,m} is
normal in the polydisk P. Since g
N,m(0) = f(π(a
m)) → ∞ as m → ∞, the
sequence {g
1,m} converges uniformly inside P identically to infinity. From (a)
and (b), just as above we conclude that g
N,m(0) = f(a
m) → ∞ as m → ∞.
In view of the arbitrariness of α, f has admissible limit equal to infinity at
zero154 Normal Functions in C

In strictly pseudoconvex domains of the space C

Proof. We choose coordinates z1, . . . , zn in C

Since ∂Ω is of class C

, one can find a neighborhood U of the point 0 such
that for all points ξ ∈ ∂Ω ∩ U the vectors νξ make an acute angle with the
vector ν0. It follows from (4.2) and Fubini’s theorem that for almost all points

∂Ω for all ξ ∈ ∂Ω ∩ U and 0 < t ≤ δ. It is proved in [270] that for all

and hence f(`ξ(t)) tends to a finite limit as t → 0. Since the vector νξ makes an
acute angle with the vector ν0 it follows from the proof of Theorem 4.13.1 that
for such ξ the function f is bounded in the domains Aα(ξ). Let Ω
0 ⊂ Ω ∩ U
be a domain with C
2

0 ∩ V for some
neighborhood V 3 0. Then the admissible domains Aα(ξ) coincide for Ω and156 Normal Functions in C

in a neighborhood W 3 0. According to the equivalence of properties (a)
and (b) for the domain Ω
0
indicated above, we thus get that f has admissible
limits almost everywhere on ∂Ω ∩ W. Since the assertion of the theorem is
local, the theorem is proved.
One sufficient condition that guarantees existence of an admissible limit
for an arbitrary function f which is holomorphic in a domain Ω ⊂ C
n follows
from the argument Stein used to prove Theorem 12 in [270]: if f ∈ O(Ω) has
a limit along normal at ξ ∈ ∂Ω and
Z
Aα(ξ)
|∇Ωf(z)| dΩ(z) < +∞
for all α > 0, then f has an admissible limit at ξ.
Another sufficient condition for existence of an admissible limit is given by
the following
Proposition 4.13.3. Let Ω be a domain in C
n, n > 1, with C
2
-smooth
boundary. If a function f holomorphic in Ω has a finite limit along the normal
at ξ ∈ ∂Ω and Re f has an admissible limit at ξ, then f has an admissible
limit at ξ.
Proof. Without loss of generality, set ξ = 0, ν0 = (00, 1). Here and henceforth
z = (z1, . . . , zn),
0
z = (z1, . . . , zn−1).
We also assume that f has the limit zero along ν0; for, in the event that
f has a finite limit a along ν0, it suffices to consider the function f − a. The
function e
f has the limit unity along ν0 and is bounded in any domain Aα(0);
note that |e
f
| < e<f and, by hypothesis, Re f has an admissible limit at
zero. The one-dimensional Lindelöf theorem now implies that e
f(
0
0,zn) and,
consequently, f(
00, zn) have angular limits at 0. We write g(µ) = f(µ
0
z, zn),
µ ∈ C. For every domain Aα(0), we can find constants c > 0 and α

substituted for the second inequality in the definition of the domain Aα(ξ),
then the resulting domain is called weakly admissible and the limit of the func￾tion over all such domains, whenever it exists, is called weakly admissible. The
multidimensional Lindelöf theorem established by Čhirka in [48] for bounded
holomorphic functions remains valid for pluriharmonic functions. In the proof,
the Schwarz lemma should be replaced by its weakened version which ensues
immediately from the Poisson formula. Thus, if a bounded function f ∈ O(Ω)
is such that Re f has the limit a along the normal νξ and Im f has the limit
b along normal νξ, then f has a weakly admissible limit at ξ that is equal to
a + ib.5
A Geometric Approach to the
Theory of Normal Families
Preamble: It is an important insight that the theory of normal families can
be rendered in geometric language. We develop that idea in this chapter.
An important tool for us will be the Kobayashi/Royden metric. This is a
metric that was devised in the 1960s to generalize the invariant metric that
Poincaré created on the unit disk in the early twentieth century. It is fairly
simple to define, but it is a powerful tool.
Of course the Ascoli-Arzelà theorem will be a part of our considerations,
and we will realize that result as a compactness statement.
Hung-Hsi Wu’s idea of taut manifold will be discussed. It is a key idea
in the modern theory of normal families. Norberto Kerzman’s result that all
smoothly bounded pseudoconvex domains are taut will be treated.
Finally, we relate this circle of ideas to the big Picard theorem. That is an
attractive way to wrap up our geometric discussion.
5.1 Introduction
In what follows, a domain is a connected, open set. The focus of this section is
on normal families of mappings from one complete hyperbolic complex man￾ifold to another. Since there are a number of different definitions of normal
family, we begin by specifying the definition that we will use here. Our source
for this definition is [287]. In what follows we will let M, N denote complex
manifolds.
Definition 5.1.1. We let C(M, N) denote the collection of continuous map￾pings from M to N. And let H(M, N) denote the collection of holomorphic
mappings from M to N.
Definition 5.1.2. We say that a sequence of mappings fj : M → N con￾verges normally if, for each compact set K ⊆ M, the sequence fj |K converges
uniformly.
DOI: 10.1201/9781032669861-5 158History 159
We say that the sequence of mappings fj is compactly divergent if, given
any compact K ⊆ M and any compact L ⊆ N, there is an index T0 so that
fj (K) ∩ L = ∅ for j > T0.
Definition 5.1.3. We call a collection F ⊆ C(M, N) normal if every sequence
in F contains either a subsequence that converges normally or a subsequence
that is compactly divergent.
It is a pleasure to acknowledge [20, 287] as the inspiration for some of this
work.
5.2 History
Most people think of Montel as the progenitor of the theory of normal families.
But in point of fact the basic idea has a considerable history prior to Montel’s
efforts.
In the early 1860s Weierstrass contributed a key idea about normal conver￾gence of holomorphic functions (see [245]). In 1894 Stieltjes [273] showed that
uniform convergence was the natural topology to consider for holomorphic
functions. Osgood, in 1901, weakened the hypotheses needed in order to de￾rive uniform convergence of a sequence of holomorphic functions (see [230]).
These results were sharpened further by Porter [239, 240] and Vitali [282,
283]. Arzelà and Ascoli proved in [12] and [11] what we now know as the
Ascoli–Arzelà theorem.
It was not until 1907 that Montel [198] proved a version of what we now
call Montel’s theorem. In his 1912 paper [200] Montel introduced the term
“normal family”. Montel’s definitive monograph [199] established his name in
the firmament.
5.3 The Kobayashi/Royden Pseudometric and Related
Ideas
The Kobayashi/Royden pseudometric is one of many invariant metrics that
can be defined on a complex manifold. We choose to emphasize this particular
one because it is convenient for the study of normal families.
Definition 5.3.1. Let M be a complex manifold. Let P ∈ M. Let TPM be
the (complex) tangent space to M at P and T
∗M the tangent bundle. Let
D be the unit disk in the complex plane. Let e1 be the vector 1 + i0 = h1, 0i
in the plane. The infinitesimal form of the Kobayashi/Royden pseudometric is160 A Geometric Approach to the Theory of Normal Families


We say that M is Kobayashi hyperbolic if the integrated Kobayashi distance
dK is actually a metric on M. It is worth noting that a planar domain is
hyperbolic if and only if its covering space is the disk. Identifying hyperbolic
domains or manifolds in higher dimensions is notably more difficult.
Any domain in the plane that is covered by the disk is complete hyper￾bolic. Any bounded, strongly pseudoconvex domain in C
n with C
2 bound￾ary is complete hyperbolic (see [84]). Since any pseudoconvex domain can be
exhausted by smoothly bouneded, strongly pseudoconvex domains, this is a
useful result. Also a smoothly bounded, finite type domain in C
2
is complete
hyperbolic (see [42]). It is straightforward to check that if Ω is a smoothly
bounded domain and each boundary point is a peak point, then the domain
is complete hyperbolic. The work [75] is relevant here.
A key property of the Kobayashi/Royden pseudometric, and one that we
shall use decisively in what follows, is that holomorphic mappings are distance
non-increasing in the Kobayashi/Royden pseudometric. See [143, Ch. 11] for
details. We sometimes instead use the phrase “distance decreasing”.
We will use the notation BM
K (P, r) to denote an open ball in the
Kobayashi/Royden pseudometric of M with center P and radius r. Likewise,
B
M
k
(P, r) denotes the closed ball.
5.4 The Ascoli-Arzelà Theorem and Relative
Compactness
We now recall the Ascoli-Arzelà theorem in a form that will be most useful
for us. The proof is straightforward and we omit it (or see [258]).
Theorem 5.4.1 (Ascoli-Arzelà). Let M and N be complex manifolds and let
F ⊆ C(M, N). We have that F is relatively compact in C(M, N) if and only if
(a) F is equicontinuous on M;The Ascoli-Arzelà Theorem and Relative Compactness 161
(b) for each z ∈ M, the set
F(z) ≡ {f(z) : f ∈ F}
is relatively compact in N.
Now our first basic result about the circle of ideas connected to normal
families is this:
Proposition 5.4.2. Suppose that M and N are complete hyperbolic and that
F ⊆ H(M, N). Then F is relatively compact in C(M, N) if and only if there
is a point z0 ∈ M such that F(z0) ≡ {f(z0) : f ∈ F} is relatively compact in
N.
Proof. Of course we equip each of M and N with the Kobayashi/Royden
pseudometric. Then, by the distance non-increasing property of the Kobaya￾shi/Royden pseudometric, any holomorphic function f : M → N is Lipschitz
with Lipschitz constant equal to 1. Therefore, condition (a) of the Ascoli￾Arzelà theorem holds. Because F(z0) is relatively compact in N, there is a
point w0 ∈ N and a constant R > 0 so that F(z0) ⊆ B
N
K(w0, R). Let z be any
point of M and set r = dM
K (z0, z). Then, for all f ∈ F, we know that
d
N
K(f(z0), f(z)) ≤ d
M
K (z0, z).
As a result,
d
N
K(w0, f(z)) ≤ d
N
K(w0, f(z0)) + d
N
K(f(z0), f(z)) ≤ R + r .
So
F(z) ⊆ B
N
K (w0, R + r).
Because N is complete hyperbolic, we can be sure that closed hyperbolic
disks are compact. Therefore, F(z) is relatively compact in N.
An easy corollary is this:
Corollary 5.4.3. Suppose that N and P are complete hyperbolic. Assume
that N ⊆ P. Let M be another complete hyperbolic manifold. Then H(M, N)
is relatively compact in C(M, P).
Proof. Certainly H(M, N) ⊆ H(M, P). Hence the elements of H(M, N) sat￾isfy a Lipschitz condition with norm 1. Because N ⊆ P, we know that every
orbit H(M, N)(z0) is relatively compact in P. As a result, H(M, N) is rela￾tively compact in H(M, P).
Taking into account the definition of normal family given in Defini￾tion 5.1.3, we can now formulate the following result:
Theorem 5.4.4. Suppose that M and N are complete hyperbolic and that
F ⊆ H(M, N). Then F is a normal family.162 A Geometric Approach to the Theory of Normal Families
Proof. Either there is a point z0 ∈ M such that F(z0) ≡ {f(z0) : f ∈ F} is
relatively compact in N or there is not. In the first instance, the proposition
applies. In the second instance there is a complactly divergent subsequence.
Example 5.4.5. Let M be the unit disk in the complex plane and let N also
be the unit disk. Then both M and N are complete hyperbolic. And certainly
Montel’s original theorem tells us that any family F ⊆ H(M, N) is normal.
Now let M be as in the last paragraph and N be the upper half plane.
Then certainly both M and N are complete hyperbolic. Consider the family
of mappings
fj (ζ) = ij + jζ
from M to N. Then fj (0) tends to infinity, and we see that the family {fj} is
compactly divergent.
Of course the extended complex plane (the Riemann sphere Cb) is not
hyperbolic. It is instead more convenient to use the spherical metric on Cb. It
is given by
σ(z) = 2
1 + |z|
2
.
It has corresponding spherical distance function
s(z, w) = 2 tan−1
|z − w|
1 + wz
.
The next result is a version of Marty’s theorem adapted to our present
context.
Theorem 5.4.6. Let M be complete hyperbolic and Cb the Riemann sphere
equipped with the spherical metric. Let F be a family of holomorphic func￾tions from M to Cb. Assume that, for each f ∈ F, |∇f| is bounded from the
Kobayashi/Royden metric to the spherical metric. Then F is a normal family.
Proof. This result is immediate from calculus and the mean value theorem.
5.5 Some More Sophisticated Normal Families Results
Now we have the following result which is in the nature of an Ascoli-Arzelà
theorem for Lipschitz spaces. As usual we assume that each of M and N is a
complete hyperbolic complex manifold.
Theorem 5.5.1. Let F ⊆ C(M, N) have the property that each f ∈ F is
Lipschitz with Lipschitz constant equal to 1. Then F is relatively compact in
C(M, N) if and only if there is a z0 ∈ M such that F(z0) ≡ {f(z0) : f ∈ F}
is relatively compact in N.Some Examples 163
Proof. The necessity is immediate from the Ascoli-Arzelà theorem proved in
the last section.
For the sufficiency we shall also use the Ascoli-Arzelà theorem. The uni￾form Lipschitz condition on elements of F certainly tells us that F is equicon￾tinuous on M. Fix a point z ∈ M. The uniform Lipschitz condition applied
to the set {z, z0}, along with the fact that F(z0) is relatively compact, tells
us immediately that F(z) is relatively compact in N because the metric is
complete. Therefore, Condition (b) of the Ascoli-Arzelà theorem holds.
Again we have a version of Theorem 5.4.4 in this new context. This takes
into account the possibility of compact divergence.
Now for holomorphic mappings we will have a stronger result. It will be
proved using the theorem that we just treated.
Theorem 5.5.2. Let F ⊆ H(M, N). Then F is relatively compact in C(M, N)
if and only if there exists a point z0 ∈ M such that F(z0) ≡ {f(z0) : f ∈ F }
is relatively compact in Ω.
Proof. The sufficiency follows immediately from the preceding theorem.
For the necessity it suffices to show that if F is compact in C(M, N), then
it is locally uniformly Lipschitz. So suppose that F is compact in C(M, N).
Fix a compact set K ⊂ M. We then see that the continuous functional
f 7→ |f|K
attains a maximum value (call it L) on F. That establishes the relative com￾pactness of F(z0).
As an immediate consequence we have
Corollary 5.5.3. Let M be complete hyperbolic as usual. Then F ⊆ H(M, C)
is relatively compact in C(M, C) if and only if F is locally uniformly Lipschitz
and there exists a point z0 ∈ M such that F(z0) ≡ {f(z0) : f ∈ F} is relatively
compact in Ω.
Corollary 5.5.4 (Royden). Let M be complete hyperbolic. Equip the extended
complex plane Cb with the spherical metric. Then F ⊆ H(M, Cb) is relatively
compact in Cb(M, Cb) if and only if it is locally uniformly Lipschitz.
Corollary 5.5.5 (Marty). Let M be complete hyperbolic. Then F ⊆ H(M, Cb)
is relatively compact in C(M, Cb) if and only if F is locally uniformly Lipschitz.
5.6 Some Examples
Example 5.6.1. Let M be the unit disk in the complex plane and let N be
the unit disk in the complex plane. Then the Kobayashi/Royden pseudometric164 A Geometric Approach to the Theory of Normal Families
is a true metric on both these manifolds, and it is complete. So our theorems
apply, and they yield a version of the usual classical Montel theorem.
Example 5.6.2. Let M = N = C \ D(0, 1). By an inversion we may map
each of M and N to a punctured disk. So each of the domains is complete
hyperbolic, and our theorems apply.
Example 5.6.3. Let N = Cb \{−1, 1}. Let P ∈ N. If f : D → N is a holomor￾phic function that is a candidate for the Kobayashi/Royden pseudometric at
P (with f(0) = P of course), then of course we are endeavoring to maximize
|f
0
(0)| so we may as well suppose that f is univalent. So the image of f is
a simply connected region that does not contain −1 and 1. Hence it will not
contain a continuous curve X that connects −1 to 1. Since Cb \ X is confor￾mally equivalent to the disk no matter what the choice of X, we may as well
assume that X is simply the interval {(x + i0) : −1 ≤ x ≤ 1}. And of course
it is obvious that Cb \ [−1, 1] is conformally equivalent to the disk. Thus N is
complete hyperbolic. Let M be the unit disk. Then our theorems apply to this
M and N. So we have recovered the generalized Montel theorem for functions
that omit two complex values.
Note that the traditional way to handle this example is with the elliptic
modular function (see [4, 95]). Our approach of using the Kobayashi/Royden
metric is more direct and more accessible.
5.7 Taut Mappings
The paper [287] introduces the important notion of taut mapping.
Definition 5.7.1. A complex manifold M is taut if the collection of holomor￾phic mappings from the unit disk D to M is a normal family.
The paper [127] proves that any smoothly bounded, pseudoconvex domain
in C
n is taut. The ideas in this paper show that any complete hyperbolic
manifold is taut.
5.8 Classical Definition of Normal Holomorphic
Mapping
The concept of normal meromorphic function allows one to attribute to one
function the properties related to some class of functions, namely with a nor￾mal family of meromorphic functions. The idea of such a transfer is simple; itClassical Definition of Normal Holomorphic Mapping 165
was first introduced by Yosida [288] in 1934 and was discussed by Noshiro [226]
in 1939.
Noshiro’s definition reads as follows: a meromorphic function f : D → Cb
belongs to the class (A) if and only if {f ◦ g : g ∈ Aut(D)} is a normal family
([226]). He proved some interesting results about the class (A).
Noshiro’s definition only applied to the unit disk but was later extended
by Lehto and Virtanen in their seminal paper of 1957 [164]: A meromorphic
function f(z) is called normal in a simply connected domain Ω, if the family
{f(S(z))} is normal, where z
0 = S(z) denotes an arbitrary conformal mapping
of Ω onto itself. They showed that the notion of a normal meromorphic func￾tion is closely related to some of the most important problems of the boundary
behavior of meromorphic functions.
It is well-known (Marty [187]) that a family F of meromorphic functions
is normal in a domain Ω ⊂ C if and only if there exists a positive constant M
such that
|f
0
(z)|
1 + |f(z)|
2
≤ M for all f ∈ F
on every compact set in Ω.
Using this criterion, we get
Theorem 5.8.1 (Noshiro [226], Lehto-Virtanen [164]). A nonconstant func￾tion f(z) is a normal function in the unit disk D = {z ∈ C: |z| < 1} if and
only if
|f
0
(z)|
1 + |f(z)|
2
≤ C
1
1 − |z|
2
(5.1)
is satisfied at every point of D where C is a fixed finite constant.
We see at once that inequality (5.1) can be rewritten in the following form
Lz(log 1 + |f|
2
, 1) ≤ C(F
D
K (z, 1))2
. (5.2)
In this section, we define the concept of normal holomorphic mappings
similar to normal meromorphic functions (cf. [164]).
Let M and N be complex manifolds. We denote the set of holomorphic
mappings from M into N by O(M, N). We say that a subset F of O(M, N)
is a normal family if F is relatively compact in O(M, N) in the sense of the
compact-open topology.
Definition 5.8.2. Let Ω be a homogeneous, bounded domain in C
n and let
N be a complex manifold. We say that a holomorphic mapping f : D → N is
normal if the family
F = {f ◦ g; g ∈ Aut(Ω)}
is normal, where Aut(Ω) denotes the holomorphic automorphism group of Ω.
Definition 5.8.3. We say that a subset F of O(Ω, N) is Aut(Ω) invariant if
f ◦ g ∈ F for every f ∈ F and every g ∈ Aut(Ω).166 A Geometric Approach to the Theory of Normal Families
Since Riemann’s sphere with the spherical metric is a compact Hermitian
manifold and the Kobayasi metric coincides with the Poincarè metric in the
unit disk, we find, taking into account (5.2), the following theorem to be a
natural result:
Theorem 5.8.4. Let Ω be a bounded homogeneous domain in C
n and
￾
N, ds2
N

be a Hermitian complex manifold. If a subset F of O(Ω, N) is
an Aut(Ω)-invariant normal family, then there exists a constant C such that
f
∗ds2
N ≤ C · F
2
Ω for every f ∈ F.
For the proof we need the following proposition.
Proposition 5.8.5. Let FΩ be the Kobayashi metric of a homogeneous
bounded domain Ω in C
n and ￾
N, ds2
N

be a compact Hermitian manifold.
If a holomorphic mapping f : Ω → N satisfies
f
∗
ds2
N ≤ C · F
2
Ω
for a finite constant C, then f is a normal holomorphic mapping.
Proof. As F

N ≤ C · g
∗F
2
Ω = C · F
2
Ω
for every g ∈ Aut(Ω). Hence F = {f ◦ g : g ∈ Aut(Ω)} is equi-continuous.
As N is compact, F ⊂ O(Ω, N) is normal according to the Ascoli-Arzelà
theorem.
Proof of Theorem 5.8.4. Let
C(z) = sup
kµk=1,f∈F
f
∗
ds2
N /F2
Ω(z, µ)
for each z ∈ Ω, and µ ∈ TzC
n, where k · k is the length by a flat metric of
C
n. We first prove that C(0) < ∞ for a point 0 ∈ Ω.
Suppose that C(0) = ∞. Then there exist sequences {fj} ⊂ F and
{µj ∈ T0C
n, kµjk = 1} of holomorphic tangent vectors such that
(i) f
∗
nds2
N (0, µn) ≥ n

Ω (0, µn),
where we may assume that {µn} converges to µ ∈ T0C
n. From (i) we see
(ii) kfn∗µnkN ≥ n · α,
where k · kN is the length measured by ds2
N and α is a positive constant.
Since F is relatively compact in O(Ω, N), some subsequence {fjk
} of {fj}
exists such that fjk → f ∈ O(Ω, N) and fjk
(0) → p ∈ N as k → ∞. Conse￾quently fjk∗µjk → f∗µ and kfjk∗µjk
kN → kf∗µkN < ∞ as k → ∞. This is
contradictory to (ii) and hence C(0) < Examples 167
We secondly prove that C(z) is constant on Ω. From definition of C(z)
f
∗
ds2
N (z) ≤ C(z) · F
2
Ω(z)
for every f ∈ F. As F
2
Ω is Aut(Ω)-invariant,
(f ◦ g)
∗
ds2
N (z) ≤ C(g(z)) · F
2
Ω(z)
for every g ∈ Aut(Ω). Hence C(g(z)) ≥ C(z). Similarly C(z) ≥ C(g(z)) and so
C(z) = C(g(z)). As Ω is homogeneous, C(z) is constant on Ω and the theorem
is proved.
Corollary 5.8.6. Let Ω and N be as above. If f : Ω → N is a normal
holomorphic mapping, then there exists a finite constant C such that f
∗ds2
N ≤

5.9 Examples
In this section we give some examples of normal holomorphic mappings.
Example 5.9.1. Let D = {|z| < 1} ⊂ C be the unit disk.
(i) We choose q arbitrarily distinct points p1, . . . , pq in the Riemann sphere
Cb. Let F be a family of holomorphic mappings from D into Cb which satisfies
the following condition (C).
(C) Every f in F takes each value pi ∈ Cb (i = 1, . . . , q) with multiplicity
≥ mi or f omits a point pi and {mı}
q
i=1 satisfies
−2 +Xq
i=1

1 −
1
mi

> 0 ,
where we set mi = ∞ in the case f omits pi
.
Then F is normal (Montel-Valiron, cf. Theorem 8.3 in H. Fujimoto [79]).
Particularly, if a holomorphic map f : D → Cb satisfies the condition (C),
then f is a normal holomorphic mapping, that is, a normal meromorphic
function (cf. [164]).
(ii) Let T = C/L be a complex torus and take a point p of T. We consider
the family F of all holomorphic mappings from D into T which omit a value
p ∈ T. Then F is normal. Particularly, every f in F is a normal holomorphic
mapping.
(iii) Let V be a compact Riemann surface of genus ≥ 2. Then O(D, V ) is

(iv) Let N be a paracompact connected complex analytic space and M be a
hyperbolically embedded subspace of N. Then O(D, M) is relatively com￾pact in O(D, N) (See [129]). Particularly a holomorphic mapping from D
into N is normal if the image of f is contained in M. For such examples see
M. L. Green [90] and [89].

5.11 Normal Mappings
In view of Corollary 5.8.6 the definition of normal mappings is extended in
the obvious way to arbitrary complex manifolds.
Definition 5.11.1. Let M be a complex manifold and let (N, ds2
N ) be a
compact Hermitian complex manifold. Let FM be the Kobayashi metrics on
M. A holomorphic map f : M → N is called normal if there exists a positive
constant C such that
ds2
N f(z, v) ≤ C(FM(z, v))2
(5.1)
for all (z, v) ∈ Tz(M).
In view of everything else we have said in this book, that is just the right
definition.
In the paper [47], Cima and Krantz show that a more natural, geomet￾rically invariant definition of “normal function” is this. Let Ω ⊆ C
n be a
complete hyperbolic domains. Let Cb be as usual the Riemann sphere. Then
a function f : Ω → Cb is normal if and only if the derivative ∇f is bounded
from the Kobayashi metric on Ω to the spherical metric on Cb.
This idea fits naturally with the discussions we have had in earlier sections,
because a function as described in the previous paragraph is, by the mean value
theorem, Lipschitz of order 1 in the two given metrics. In fact, according to
Marty’s classical theorem, a family of functions F = {fα}α∈A of holomorphic
functions from Ω to Cb is normal if and only if the family {∇fα} is bounded
from the Kobayashi metric to the spherical metric.
Recall that the Lindelöf principle, in its simplest classical formulation, is
this.172 A Geometric Approach to the Theory of Normal Families
Proposition 5.11.2. Let f : D → C be a bounded, holomorphic function.
Suppose that limr→1− f(r) exists and equals `. Then the nontangential limit
of f at 1 exists and equals `.
Lehto and Virtanen taught us, in the context of the last proposition, (i)
how to treat a broader class of functions and (ii) how to treat a broader
class of boundary curves in the hypothesis. It is particularly interesting that
this phenomenon of boundary behavior is related to the idea of normal fam￾ilies. And even more interesting that it can be interpreted in the language of
invariant metrics.
To put these matters into perspective, we record now a version of the
Lindelöf principle in this new context. In particular, what is new here is that
we have a Lindelöf principle for mappings of manifolds rather than for function
on domains.
Proposition 5.11.3. Let M, N be complete hyperbolic manifolds as usual.
Let γ : [0, 1) → M be a continuous curve with limt→1− f(γ(t)) = `. Here `
could be a point of N or it could be a “limit point of N”. If γe : [0, 1) → M is
another curve with limt→1− F M
K (γ(t), γe(t)) = 0, then limt→1− f(γe(t)) = `.
Proof. This result is immediate from the distance non-increasing property of
the metrics.
5.12 A Generalization of the Big Picard Theorem
We set D = {w ∈ C, |w| < 1} and D∗ = {w ∈ C, 0 < |w| < 1}. Let π : D →
D∗ be the universal covering, where π(w) = e
(w+1)/(w−1)
.
Definition 5.12.1. A holomorphic mapping f from D∗
into a complex ana￾lytic space N is said to be normal if f ◦ π : D → N is a normal holomorphic
mapping.
Theorem 5.12.2. Let N be a paracompact complex manifold. If f : D∗ → N
is a normal holomorphic mapping, then f can be extended to a holomorphic
mapping from D into N.
Proof. First of all, we show that there exists a sequence {zn}
∞
n=1 ⊂ D∗
con￾verging to the origin 0 such that {f (zn)}
∞
n=1 converges to some point p0 in
N. Take a sequence {zn}
∞
n=1 ⊂ D∗
converging to 0, points {wn} such that
π (wn) = zn and take gn ∈ Aut(D) such that gn(0) = wn. Consider the
family F = {f ◦ π ◦ gn}
∞
n=1. By the hypothesis, F is normal. We can take
a subsequence {f ◦ π ◦ gnk
}
∞
n=1 of {f ◦ π ◦ gn}
∞
n=1 such that {f ◦ π ◦ gnk
}
∞
k=1
converges to some h ∈ O(D, N). Particularly f ◦ π ◦ gnk
(0) → h(0) = p0. We
set π ◦ gnk
(0) = zk. Then f (zk) → p0.A Generalization of the Big Picard Theorem 173
Secondly, we take a Hermitian metric ds2
N of N. Since f ◦ π : D → N is
normal, according to Theorem 5.8.4

We set rk = |zk|. It may be assumed that {rk}

k=1 is a decreasing sequence.
We denote by dN the distance of N defined by ds2
N . Then
dN (f(z), p0) ≤ dN (f(z), f (zk)) + dN (f (zk), p0). (5.3)

The right-hand side converges to 0 as k → ∞. According to (5.3) and (5.4),
we see that, for every ε-neighborhood W of p0, when k0 is sufficiently large,
f ({|z| = rk}) is contained in W for k = k0. By the method in the proof of
Theorem 3.1 in S. Kobayashi [135, Chapter VI] we can see that, for every
neighborhood U of p0, if δ > 0 is sufficiently small, f({z ∈ D∗
: |z| < δ}) is
contained in U, and so we can define a holomorphic extension of f to D by
f(0) = p0.
Remark 5.12.3. The above theorem remains valid for a paracompact connected
complex analytic space N, because N has a Hermitian metric h in the extended
sense, which induces the original topology of N, and the discussion of Section
5.1 and the above proof are available for such (N, h) (see the introduction of
P. Kiernan [129]).
Remark 5.12.4. Let N be a paracompact connected complex analytic space
and M be hyperbolically embedded subspace of N. Then a holomorphic map￾ping f : D∗ → N with f (D∗
) ⊂ M is normal. Hence, Theorem 5.12.2 is a
generalization of a big Picard theorem given in S. Kobayashi [135, Chapter V,
Theorem 6.1]6
Some Classical Theorems and
Families of Normal Maps in
Several Complex Variables
Preamble: We show that normal maps as defined by authors in various set￾tings are, as singleton sets, uniformly normal families and that, in these set￾tings, the maps in uniformly normal families are normal. We give an example
of a family of functions which is not uniformly normal in the framework of
the original Noshiro-Lehto-Virtanen definition of normal maps, even though
each of its members is a normal function. In this chapter we provide signif￾icant generalizations of theorems of Brody, Lehto and Virtanen, Hahn, and
Zaidenberg. A number of results for uniformly normal families on hyperbolic
manifolds are shown to carry over to uniformly normal families on arbitrary
complex spaces.
A Zaidenberg generalization (to complex manifolds) of a single-variable
version of Schottky’s theorem due to Hayman is extended to uniformly normal
families of functions on arbitrary complex spaces and provided with a simpler
proof, a several variables form of a classical lemma of Bohr.
Proved theorems include (1) extension theorems of big Picard type for
such families—defined on complex manifolds having divisors with normal
crossings—which encompass results of Järvi, Kiernan, Kobayashi, and Kwack
as special cases, and (2) generalizations to such families of an extension￾convergence theorem due to Noguchi.
6.1 Preliminaries
The type of a Riemann surface can be characterized by the sign of the cur￾vature of the natural metric it carries. Namely, elliptic with curvature +1,
parabolic with curvature 0, and hyperbolic with curvature −1.
We are interested in complex spaces of hyperbolic type since they repre￾sent the general case. The good introduction to the theory of Complex Space
are [98, Chapter 5] or [88, Chapters 1, 2].
DOI: 10.1201/9781032669861-6 174Preliminaries 175
Let Z be a complex manifold. By a closed complex subspace X we mean
a closed subset which can be locally defined by a finite number of analytic
equations.
By a complex subspace of X we mean a locally closed complex subspace,
that is a closed complex subspace of an open subset of X.
We do not want to go through a systematic treatment of the foundations
of complex spaces. For this we refer to Gunning and Rossi [98]. Gunning and
Rossi defined an analytic space as a topological space, with an additional
structure provided by a distinguished sheaf of germs of continuous functions.
Thus the “geometry” of an analytic space is derived from the function theory.
In this sense geometry cannot be separated from function theory, and in fact
the distinction they make is one of terminology rather than substance. This
will be observable in the many “geometric” facts which have function-theoretic
significance, and vice versa.
There are several ways to extend the concept of hyperbolicity to higher di￾mensional complex spaces. Kobayashi hyperbolicity is based on the existence
of a certain intrinsic distance, and this intrinsic distance was originally intro￾duced to generalize Schwarz’s lemma to higher dimensional complex spaces.
Schwarz’s lemma, reformulated by Pick, says that every holomorphic map
from the unit disk D of C into itself is distance-decreasing with respect to the
Poincaré distance ρ, and is at the heart of geometric function theory.
Our discussion of tangent spaces to analytic spaces is also not as thorough
as it could be, and serves only as an introduction. The reader is urged to
consult the paper of Whitney [285] which discusses more geometric candidates
for the tangential structure and has many interesting examples.
Given a complex space X, Kobayashi [134, Chapter 3, Section 5, p. 86]
has defined an intrinsic pseudometric, i.e., the infinitesimal form FbX of the
Kobayashi pseudodistance dX, in the following way. All necessary algebraic
results on norms are summarized in [134, Chapter 1, Section 2, p. 86].
Let TxX and T
∗
x X denote the Zariski tangent space and cotangent space
of X at x. Since there are some unresolved technical problems when X has
singularities, we often have to assume that X is a complex manifold. We first
define a quasinorm F
∗
X on the Zariski cotangent space T
∗
x X by setting
F
∗
X(λ) = sup kf
∗λk for λ ∈ T
∗
x X
where kf
∗λk is the length of the cotangent vector f
∗λ ∈ T
∗D measured by
the Poincaré metric ds2 of the unit disk D, and the supremum is taken over
all f ∈ Hol(D, X) with x ∈ f(D). Because of the homogeneity of D, it suffices
to take the supremum over all f ∈ Hol(D, X) with f(0) = x.
The notation T(X, Y ) (C(X, Y )) (H (Dn, Y )) denotes the space of maps
(continuous maps) (holomorphic maps) from a complex space X to a (topolog￾ical) (complex) space Y (with the compact-open topology). Also Y
∗ = Y ∪{∞}
denotes the one-point compactification of a noncompact space Y and Y
∗ = Y
otherwise.176 Some Classical Theorems
If F ⊂ C(X, Y ) we say that F is evenly continuous from p ∈ X to q ∈ Y
if for each U open in Y about q, there exist V, W open in X, Y about p, q
respectively such that
{f ∈ F : f(p) ∈ W} ⊂ {f ∈ F : f(V ) ⊂ U}.
If F is evenly continuous from each p ∈ X to each q ∈ Y , then we say that F
is evenly continuous (from X to Y ) [126].
We will have occasion to rely on the following topological version of the
Ascoli-Arzelà theorem.
Proposition 6.1.1. Let X be a regular locally compact space and let Y be a
regular space. Then F ⊂ C(X, Y ) is relatively compact in C(X, Y ) if and only
if
(a) F is evenly continuous, and
(b) F(x) is relatively compact in Y for each x ∈ X.
It is readily derived from a Kelley-Morse theorem (Theorem 7.21 in [126])
since F(x) = F(x) for each x ∈ X and, under the hypothesis, F is evenly
continuous if and only if F is evenly continuous, that F(x) = {f(x) : f ∈ F},
where A = topological closure of A.
If F ⊂ C(Y, Z) and G ⊂ C(X, Y ), then we write F ◦ G for {f ◦ g : g ∈
G, f ∈ F}.
A family of maps F ⊂ H(X, Y ) is called a normal family if F ◦ H(D, X)
is relatively compact in H(D, Y ) ∪ {∞} ⊂ C (D, Y ∗
).
We now recall the definition of uniformly normal families and normal
maps [124].
Definition 6.1.2. Let X and Y be complex spaces. A family F ⊂ H(X, Y )
is uniformly normal if F ◦ H(M, X) is relatively compact in C (M, Y ∗
) for
each complex manifold M. We say that f is a normal map if {f} is uniformly
normal.
Here Y
∗ = Y ∪ {∞} represents the Alexandroff one-point compactification
of the topological space Y , Y
∗ = Y if Y is compact.
It is clear from Definition 6.1.2 that each member of a uniformly normal
family is a normal map in that setting.
Example 6.1.3 shows that a family of normal functions might fail to be
uniformly normal.
Example 6.1.3. Define F ⊂ H

the framework of Lehto-Virtanen by the Picard Theorem. Define ϕn ∈ A(D)

→ 0. Hence F is not uniformly normal.
Definition 6.1.2 encompasses and unifies the concepts of normal maps de￾fined by authors in various settings (see [47], [81], [119] [112], [164]Preliminaries 177
observation that a family of holomorphic maps from (D \ {0})
n into a com￾plex space Y is uniformly normal if and only if there is a distance E on Y such
that each member is distance decreasing with respect to E together with the
hyperbolic distance of (D∗
)
n
leads to extensions of the big Picard theorem.
The Kiernan-Kobayashi-Kwack Theorem and Noguchi’s convergence theorems
for uniformly normal families [157] tell us that each element of a uniformly
normal family of maps from (D∗
)
n
to a relatively compact subspace of a com￾plex space Y extends to a holomorphic map and the family of extensions is
also uniformly normal [122].
Abate [1] showed that a complex space Y is hyperbolic iff H(D, Y ) is a
relatively compact subset of C (D, Y ∗
). Hence H(D, Y ) is a uniformly normal
family if Y is hyperbolic. Where Y
∗ = Y ∪ {∞} represents the Alexandroff
one-point compactification of the topological space Y, Y ∗ = Y if Y is compact.
The proofs of Propositions 6.1.4 and 6.1.5 are omitted since they are evi￾dent from Definition 6.1.2.
Proposition 6.1.4. If M is a complex manifold and Y is a complex space and
F ⊂ H(M, Y ) is uniformly normal, then F is relatively compact in C (M, Y ∗
).
Proposition 6.1.5. If X and Y are complex spaces, then the following state￾ments are equivalent for F ⊂ H(X, Y ):
1. F is uniformly normal.
2. If Z is a complex space and G ⊂ H(Z, X), then F ◦ G is uni￾formly normal.
3. If Z is a complex subspace of X, then the family of restrictions
of the elements of F to Z is uniformly normal.
In Proposition 6.1.6 we establish that the requirement that all complex
manifolds M satisfy the condition in Definition 6.1.2 may be replaced by a
condition on D.
Proposition 6.1.6. If X, Y are complex spaces, then the following are equiv￾alent for F ⊂ H(X, Y )
(1) F is uniformly normal.
(2) F ◦ H(D, X) is uniformly normal.
(3) F ◦ H(D, X) is relatively compact in C (D, Y ∗
).
(4) The closure of F in H(X, Y ) is uniformly normal.
Proof. (1) ⇒ (2) ⇒ (3) and (4) ⇒ (1); from Propositions 6.1.5 and 6.1.4.
(3) ⇒ (1). If (1) does not hold we may assume M = {p ∈ C
m : kpk < 1}
and, by Proposition 6.1.1, that F ◦ M(M, X) is not evenly continuous from
0 ∈ M to q ∈ Y
∗
. There are sequences {pn} in M \ {0}, {fn} in F, {ϕn} in
H(M, X) such that kpnk → 0, fn◦ϕn(0) → q and fn◦ϕn (pn) 9 q. Define λn ∈
H(D, X) by λn(z) = ϕn (zpn/ kpnk) ; fn ◦λn(0) → q while fn ◦λn (kpnk) 6→ q.178 Some Classical Theorems
From Proposition 6.1.1, F ◦ H(D, X) is not relatively compact in C (D, Y ∗
),
so (3) does not hold and we complete the proof of (3) ⇒ (1).
(1) ⇒ (4). We show that, for any complex manifold M,
(F ∩ H(X, Y )) ◦ H(M, X) ⊂ F ◦ H(M, X).
Let g ∈ F ∩ H(X, Y ) and ϕ ∈ H(M, X). There is a sequence {fn} in F
such that fn → g. It follows that fn ◦ ϕ → g ◦ ϕ.
From Proposition 6.1.6 it is not difficult to see that some important classes
of complex spaces are defined by uniformly normal families. A complex sub￾space X of a complex space Y is hyperbolically imbedded in Y if, for p, q ∈ X
and p 6= q, there are open sets V, W in Y about p, q respectively such that
kX(V ∩ X, W ∩ X) > 0, where kX is Kobayashi’s pseudo-distance on X [135].
In Proposition 6.1.8 we show that families of distance-decreasing maps
between metric spaces are relatively compact as maps into the one-point com￾pactifications of the ranges.
Example 6.1.7.
1. Kiernan [129] has shown that a relatively compact complex sub￾space of a complex space Y is hyperbolically imbedded in Y if and
only if H(D, X) is relatively compact in H(D, Y ), i.e. if and only if
H(D, X) is a uniformly normal subset of H(D, Y ).
2. Royden [254] showed that a complex manifold M is hyperbolic
if and only if H(D, M) is evenly continuous and Abate [1] showed
that M is hyperbolic if and only if H(D, M) is relatively compact
in C (D, M∗
). Hence H(D, M) is a uniformly normal family if and
only if M is hyperbolic.
3. Joseph and Kwack showed in [123] that a complex subspace X
of a complex space Y is hyperbolically imbedded in Y if and only
if H(D, X) is relatively compact in C (D, Y ∗
), i.e. if and only if
H(D, X) is a uniformly normal subset of H(D, Y ).
In Proposition 6.1.8, we show that families of distance-decreasing maps
between metric spaces are relatively compact as maps into the one-point com￾pactifications of the range.
Proposition 6.1.8. Let (Y, σ) be a locally compact metric space. Let X be
a topological space and let ρ be a pseudometric on X which is continuous on
X × X. If each f ∈ F ⊂ C(X, Y ) is distance-decreasing with respect to ρ and
σ (i.e. if σ(f(x), f(y)) ≤ ρ(x, y) for all f ∈ F, x, y ∈ X) then F is relatively
compact in C (X, Y ∗
).
Proof. We show that F is evenly continuous from X to Y
∗
. If not, there
exist p ∈ X, q, s ∈ Y
∗ and nets {pα} , {fα} in X, F respectively such that
pα → p, s =6 q, fα (pα) → s, fα(p) → q. If q ∈ Y , then for each α we have
σ (fα (pα), q) ≤ σ (fα (pα), fα(p)) + σ (fα(p), q) ≤ ρ (pα, p) + σ (fα(p), q).Uniformly Normal Families on Hyperbolic Manifolds 179
So σ (fα (pα), q) → 0 and q = s, a contradiction. If s ∈ Y then for each α
we have
σ (fα(p), s) ≤ ρ (p, pα) + σ (fα (pα), s)
Hence σ (fα(p), s) → 0 and s = q, a contradiction.
6.2 Uniformly Normal Families on Hyperbolic Manifolds
In this section we establish some properties of uniformly normal families de￾fined on hyperbolic manifolds. We apply some of these properties to generalize
theorems of Brody, Hahn, and Zaidenberg; these properties are also used to
demonstrate that normal maps as defined by various authors in a variety of
settings are uniformly normal as singleton sets and that maps in any uni￾formly normal family (in particular our normal maps) are normal maps in
the prevailing setting. Furthermore, with these properties we set the stage for
those main results which come in the next section.
Let M be a hyperbolic manifold. Let F
K
M represent the infinitesimal form
of the Kobayashi distance kM on M, that is,
F
K
M (p, v) = inf{r > 0 : ϕ(0) = p, dϕ(0, re) = v for some ϕ ∈ H(D, M)},
where p ∈ M, v ∈ Tp(M)—the tangent space of M at p—dϕ is the tangent
map for ϕ, and e is the unit vector 1 at 0 ∈ D (see [157, pp. 88–94]). For
r > 0, let Dr = {z ∈ C : |z| < r} and let D∗
r = Dr \ {0}. Brody has proved
the following (see [22], p. 68).
Theorem 6.2.1. Let X be a relatively compact complex subspace of a complex
space Y . If X is not hyperbolically imbedded in Y then there exist sequences
{rn} , {gn} such that rn > 0 and gn ∈ H (Drn
, X) and a nonconstant g ∈
H(C, Y ) such that rn ↑ ∞ and gn → g on compact subsets of C.
Remark 6.2.2. In Theorem 6.2.1 we may assume that rn = n; to see this we
first assume r1 > 1 and that rn+1 − rn > 1 by taking a subsequence. If k
is a positive integer and k ≤ r1, define fk = g1; if rn < k ≤ rn+1, define
fk = gn+1. Then fk ∈ H (Dk, X) and fk → g on compact subsets of C.
Definition 6.2.3. Let X be a complex space, let Y be a complex space, and
let F ⊂ H(X, Y ).
1. A Brody sequence for F is a sequence {fn ◦ gn} where fn ∈ F
and gn ∈ H (Dn, X).
2. A map h ∈ C (C, Y ∗
) is a Brody limit for F if there is a Brody
sequence {hn} for F such that hn → h on the compact subsets of
C.180 Some Classical Theorems
Remark 6.2.4. If Y is a relatively compact complex subspace of a complex
space Z, and X is a complex space, then Brody sequences for F ⊂ H(X, Y )
coincide with Zaidenberg’s holomorphic curves and Brody limits for F coincide
with Zaidenberg’s F-limiting mappings [290].
Theorem 6.2.5 will be used extensively in the sequel.
Theorem 6.2.5. Let M be a hyperbolic manifold, and let Y be a complex
space. The following statements are equivalent for F ⊂ H(M, Y ):
(1) F is uniformly normal.
(2) For each complex manifold Ω, F ◦ H(Ω, M) is an evenly contin￾uous subset of H(Ω, Y ).
(3) F ◦ H(D, M) is an evenly continuous subset of H(D, Y ).
(4) There is a length function E on Y such that |df|E ≤ 1 for each
f ∈ F.
(5) There is a length function E on Y such that
E (hn(0), dhn(0, e)) → 0 for each Brody sequence {hn} for F.
(6) There is a length function E on Y such that
E (hn(0), dhn(0, e)) → 0 for each Brody sequence {hn} for F with
a Brody limit.
Proof. It is obvious that (1) ⇒ (2) ⇒ (3) and that (5) ⇒ (6). To show that
(3) ⇒ (4) we will first show that if (3) holds then for each length function E
on Y and compact Q ⊂ Y there is a c > 0 such that |df(p)| ≤ c on f
−1
(Q) for
each f ∈ F. The proof that (3) ⇒ (4) may then be completed by arguments
similar to those in ([157, p. 34]). To facilitate the demonstration that each
compact Q ⊂ Y satisfies the stated property for each length function E on Y ,
we prove a lemma which establishes a property of hyperbolic manifolds that
is interesting in its own right.
Lemma 6.2.6. Let f ∈ H(M, Y ) where M is a hyperbolic manifold and Y is
a complex space with a length function E. Then
|df(p)| = sup{|df ◦ ϕ(0)| : ϕ ∈ H(D, M), ϕ(0) = p} for p ∈ M,
and |df| = sup{|df ◦ ϕ(0)| : ϕ ∈ H(D, M)}
= sup{|df ◦ ϕ| : ϕ ∈ H(D, M)}.
Proof. Let p ∈ M and v ∈ Tp(M) such that F
K
M (p, v) = 1 and let  > 0.
There exist ϕ ∈ H(D, M) and r > 0 such that ϕ(0) = p, d(ϕ(0), re) = v and
r < 1 + . Now
E(f(p), df(p, ν)) = E(f ◦ ϕ(0), df ◦ ϕ(0, re)) ≤ (1 + )|df ◦ ϕ(0)|
≤ (1 + ) sup{|df ◦ ϕ(0)| : ϕ ∈ H(D, M), ϕ(0) = p}
≤ (1 + ) sup{|df ◦ ϕ| : ϕ ∈ H(D, M)}
≤ (1 + )|df|.Uniformly Normal Families on Hyperbolic Manifolds 181
The promised equalities are now immediate.
We now return to the proof of Theorem 6.2.5.
Proof. (3) ⇒ (4). If a compact Q ⊂ Y fails the stated condition for the
length function E, then there are sequences {pn} , {fn} , {vn}, and q ∈ Q,
with pn ∈ M, fn ∈ F, vn ∈ Tpn
(M), fn (pn) ∈ Q, F K
M (pn, vn) = 1, fn (pn) → q
and E (fn (pn), dfn (pn, vn)) > n. It follows that |dfn (pn)| → ∞ and, by
Lemma 6.2.6, some sequence {ϕn} in H(D, M) satisfies ϕn(0) = pn and
|dfn ◦ ϕn(0)| → ∞. Let V be a relatively compact neighborhood of q hyper￾bolically imbedded in Y . Since F ◦ H(D, M) is an evenly continuous subset
of H(D, Y ), there is an 0 < r < 1 such that fn ◦ ϕn (Dr) ⊂ V eventually; the
sequence of restrictions of {fn ◦ ϕn} to Dr, which we call again {fn ◦ ϕn}, is
uniformly normal and is consequently relatively compact in H (Dr, Y ). Hence
some subsequence of {fn ◦ ϕn} converges to h ∈ H (Dr, Y ), contradicting
|dfn ◦ ϕn(0)| → ∞.
(4) ⇒ (5). Let E be a length function as promised in (4). If {fn ◦ ϕn} is
a Brody sequence for F we have
E (fn ◦ ϕn(0), dfn ◦ ϕn(0, e)) ≤ F
K
M (ϕn(0), dϕn(0, e)) ≤ KDn
(0, e) = 1
n
and (5) holds.
(4) ⇒ (1). From (4) there is a distance function dE on Y such that each
f ∈ F ◦ H(D, M) decreases distances from kD to dE and (1) follows from
Proposition 6.1.6 and 6.1.8.
(6) ⇒ (4). If (4) does not hold, then for any length function E on Y
there are sequences {fn} in F, {ϕn} in H(D, M) such that |dfn ◦ ϕn(0)| → ∞.
Utilizing Brody’s arguments (see [22], pp. 68–71) we may obtain a Brody
sequence {gn} and Brody limit g for F such that gn → g on the compact
subsets of C and such that E (gn(0), dgn(0)) = 1, contradicting (6).
We point out that equivalence (4) of Theorem 6.2.5 generalizes the follow￾ing theorem of Lehto and Virtanen [164] since all length functions on compact
complex spaces are equivalent [157]. Hahn [101] generalized the theorem to
f ∈ H (Ω, Pn(C)) where Ω is a bounded homogeneous domain in C
m.
Theorem 6.2.7. A meromorphic function f : D → P1
(C) is normal if and
only if |df| < ∞.
Corollary 6.2.8. Let M be a hyperbolic manifold and let F ⊂ H(M, Y ) be
uniformly normal. Then
(1) Each Brody sequence for F has a subsequence which converges
to a Brody limit for F on the compact subsets of C, and
(2) Each Brody limit for F is constant.182 Some Classical Theorems
Proof. From (4) in Theorem 6.2.5 there is a length function E on Y such
that F decreases distances from kM to dE. As for (1), if m is a positive
integer and {gn} is a Brody sequence for F, then each g ∈ G = {gn : n ≥ m}
decreases distances from kDm to dE, and G is therefore by Proposition 6.1.8
relatively compact in C (Dm, Y ∗
). For (2), let {gn} be a Brody sequence for
F and suppose g is a Brody limit for F such that gn → g on the compact
subsets of C. If p, q ∈ C and g(p), g(q) ∈ Y , for n large enough we have
dE (gn(p), gn(q)) ≤ kDn
(p, q). Since kDn
(p, q) → 0 we have g(p) = g(q). If
g(p) = ∞, then the continuity of g and connectedness of C force g(q) = ∞
since g(C) ∩ Y is at most a singleton.
Corollary 6.2.9. Let M be a hyperbolic manifold, let Y be a complex space,
and let F ⊂ H(M, Y ) satisfy F(x) is relatively compact in Y for each x ∈ M.
Then F is uniformly normal if and only if each Brody limit for F is constant.
Proof. The necessity follows from (2) of Corollary 6.2.8. As for the sufficiency,
if F is not uniformly normal, then the Brody limit g constructed in (6) ⇒ (4)
of Theorem 6.2.5 is nonconstant since Y is a complex space and g(0) ∈ Y .
In the case of Cb we have the following result. Here of course we identify the
Riemann sphere with projective space. The proof is omitted as it is readily
obtained as a consequence of previous results and Hurwitz’s lemma.
Corollary 6.2.10. Let M be a hyperbolic manifold. The following are equiv￾alent for F ⊂ H(M, C)
(1) F is uniformly normal.
(2) F is uniformly normal as a subset of H

.
(3) If g is a Brody limit for F and g ∈ H(C, C) then g is constant.
A complex space Y is said to be Brody hyperbolic if every f ∈ H(C, Y ) is
constant. We observe that Y is Brody hyperbolic if and only if each Brody
limit for the identity i : Y → Y with values in Y is constant, i.e. if f ∈ H(C, Y )
and {fn} is a sequence such that fn ∈ H (Dn, Y ) and fn → f on the compact
subsets of C, then f is constant.
In Corollaries 6.2.11–6.2.13 we give characterizations of hyperbolic and
hyperbolically imbedded spaces in terms of Brody sequences.
Corollary 6.2.11. A complex space Y is hyperbolic if and only if there is a
length function E on Y such that E (fn(0), dfn(0, e)) → 0 for each sequence
{fn} satisfying fn ∈ H (Dn, Y ) and fn → g ∈ C (C, Y ∗
) on compact subsets
of C. We note that g is necessarily constant.
Corollary 6.2.12. A complex subspace Y of a complex space Z is hyper￾bolically imbedded in Z if and only if there is a length function E on Z such
that E (fn(0), dfn(0, e)) → 0 for each sequence {fn} satisfying fn ∈ H (Dn, Y )
and fn → g ∈ C (C, Z+) on compact subsets of C. Again we note that g is
necessarily constant.Uniformly Normal Families on Hyperbolic Manifolds 183
In view of Corollaries 6.2.9 and 6.2.12 we have Corollary 6.2.13 (compare
with Theorem 2.3, Chapter III in [157]).
Corollary 6.2.13. Let Y be a relatively compact complex subspace of the
complex space Z. Then Y is not hyperbolically imbedded in Z if and only
if there is a nonconstant g ∈ H(C, Z) and a sequence {gn} such that gn ∈
H (Dn, Y ) and gn → g on compact subsets of C.
If M is a homogeneous hyperbolic manifold, then we represent its space
of automorphisms by A(M). Theorem 6.2.14 is a characterization theorem for
uniformly normal families on such manifolds and Corollary 6.2.15 gives an
indication of why we adopted the terminology “uniformly normal families”.
Theorem 6.2.14. The following statements are equivalent for F ⊂ H(M, Y )
when M is a homogeneous hyperbolic manifold and Y is a complex space:
(1) F is uniformly normal.
(2) F ◦ A(M) is an evenly continuous subset of H(M, Y ).
(3) F ◦ A(M) is relatively compact in C (M, Y ∗
).
(4) F ◦ H(M, M) is relatively compact in C (M, Y ∗
).
Proof. (1) ⇒ (2). This is clear from Definition 6.1.2 and Proposition 6.1.1.
(2) ⇒ (3). We need show that F ◦ A(M) is evenly continuous from M to
Y
∗
. Suppose x ∈ M, p ∈ Y and {xn} , {fn}, and {ϕn} are sequences in M, F
and A(M) respectively such that xn → x, fn ◦ϕn(x) → ∞, and fn ◦ϕn (xn) →
p. Let λn ∈ A(M) satisfy λn(x) = xn. It follows that fn ◦ϕn ◦λn is not evenly
continuous from x to p so (2) does not hold.
(3) ⇒ (1). We show that F ◦ H(D, M) is an evenly continuous subset
of H(M, Y ) and use equivalence (3) of Theorem 6.2.5. Suppose that F ◦
H(D, M) is not evenly continuous from 0 ∈ D to p ∈ Y . There are sequences
{zn} , {fn ◦ ϕn} in D, F ◦ H(D, M) respectively and a neighborhood U of p
in Y such that zn → 0, fn ◦ ϕn(0) → p, and fn ◦ ϕn (zn) ∈/ U is satisfied.
Let a ∈ M and let {λn} be a sequence in A(M) such that λn(a) = ϕn(0).
Then fn ◦ λn(a) → p while fn ◦ λn

our hypothesis (3).
The proof of the theorem may be completed by observing that the
equivalence of (4) to the other statements follows from the equivalence of
(1) and (3), Propositions 6.1.4 and 6.1.5, and the inclusion F ◦ A(M) ⊂
F ◦ H(M, M).
Corollary 6.2.15. Let M be a homogeneous hyperbolic manifold, let Y be a
complex space, and let F ⊂ H(M, Y ) satisfy F = F ◦ A(M). Then
(1) The family F is uniformly normal if and only if F is relatively
compact in C (M, Y ∗
)184 Some Classical Theorems
(2) If M = D and Y = C, then F is uniformly normal if and only
if F is normal in the sense of Wu [287].
Proof. Assertion (1) is an easy consequence of Proposition 6.1.4 and (3) of
Theorem 6.2.14. Assertion (2) can be seen to be a product of (1) and Hur￾witz’s lemma.

sense of Montel. In view of this and Corollary 6.2.15, we used the terminology
“uniformly normal family”.
6.3 Uniformly Normal Families Defined on Arbitrary
Complex Spaces. Higher Dimensional Versions of
Classical Results of Schottky, Lappan, and Bohr for
Uniformly Normal Families
In this section we apply results in Chapter 6 and Section 6.2 to establish prop￾erties of uniformly normal families on arbitrary complex spaces and we gen￾eralize theorems of Schottky, Hayman, and Lappan by replacing the bounded
domains in C by arbitrary complex spaces and the maps under consideration
by uniformly normal families. A Lindelöf principle shown by Cima and Krantz
to be satisfied by normal maps from a bounded domain in C
n to P1
(C) is gen￾eralized by replacing P1
(C) by an arbitrary complex space and normal maps
by uniformly normal families.
The following proposition on Brody sequences and limits will be useful.
Proposition 6.3.1. Let X, Y be complex spaces and let F ⊂ H(X, Y ). Then
(1) The sequence {gn} is a Brody sequence for F if and only if {gn}
is a Brody sequence for F ◦ H(D, X), and
(2) The mapping g is a Brody limit for F if and only if g is a Brody
limit for F ◦ H(D, X).
Proof. Conclusion (2) is an easy consequence of conclusion (1). As for (1), if
gn = fn ◦ϕn, where fn ∈ F and ϕn ∈ H (Dn, X), then gn = fn ◦ϕn ◦mn ◦m−1
n
where mn ∈ H (D, Dn) is multiplication by n. Then fn◦ϕn◦mn ∈ F ◦H(D, X)
and m−1
n ∈ H (Dn, D), so {gn} is a Brody sequence for F ◦ H(D, X) if {gn}
is a Brody sequence for F. On the other hand, if gn = hn ◦ ϕn where hn ∈
F ◦ H(D, X) and ϕn ∈ H (Dn, D), then gn = fn ◦ αn ◦ ϕn where fn ∈ F and
αn ◦ ϕn ∈ H (Dn, X). So each Brody sequence for F ◦ H(D, X) is a Brody
sequence for FUniformly Normal Families on Complex Spaces 185
Theorem 6.3.2 is a consequence of Definition 6.1.2, Proposi￾tions 6.1.6, 6.3.1, and Theorem 6.2.5.
Theorem 6.3.2. If X, Y are complex spaces, the following statements are
equivalent for F ⊂ H(X, Y )
(1) The set F is uniformly normal.
(2) The set F ◦H(M, X) is an evenly continuous subset of H(M, Y )
for each complex manifold M.
(3) F ◦ H(D, X) is an evenly continuous subset of H(D, Y ).
(4) There is a length function E on Y such that |dg|E ≤ 1 for each
g ∈ F ◦ H(D, X).
(5) There is a length function E on Y such that
E (hn(0), dhn(0, e)) → 0 for each Brody sequence {hn} for F.
(6) There is a length function E on Y such that
E (hn(0), dhn(0, e)) → 0 for each Brody sequence {hn} for F with
a Brody limit.
Propositions 6.1.6, 6.3.1 and Corollary 6.2.8 lead to the following result.
Theorem 6.3.3. Let X be a complex space and let F ⊂ H(X, Y ) be uniformly
normal. Then
(1) Each Brody sequence for F has a subsequence which converges
to a Brody limit for F on compact subsets of C.
(2) Each Brody limit for F is constant.
Theorem 6.3.4 follows from Propositions 6.1.6, 6.3.1 and Corollary 6.2.9.
Theorem 6.3.4. Let X, Y be complex spaces and let F ⊂ H(X, Y ) have the
property that F(x) is relatively compact in Y for each x ∈ X. Then F is
uniformly normal if and only if each Brody limit for F is constant.
For uniformly normal families of functions, we have the following theorem.
Theorem 6.3.5. The following statements are equivalent for a complex space

If X is a complex space, f ∈ H(X, C), and x ∈ X, we denote max{1, |f(x)|}
by µ(f, x). It is obvious that the conclusion of Theorem 6.3.6 can be replaced

Zaidenberg [290] extended Hayman’s result to uniformly normal families
of functions defined on complex manifolds. This generalization was effected by
use of the Kobayashi-Royden-Green metric which was introduced in [90] and
studied further in [289]. We utilize parts of Hayman’s proof of Theorem 6.3.6
to extend Zaidenberg’s result, using more elementary proofs, to uniformly
normal families of functions defined on complex spaces.

Proof. (1) ⇒ (2). Clearly F ◦H(D, X) is uniformly normal and invariant, and
is consequently normal in the sense of Montel by Corollary 6.2.15. Hayman

|g

where µ0 = max{1, |g(0)|}. For z ∈ D define ψz ∈ A(D) by ψz(w) = (w +

≤ [cµ(f, ϕ(y))]exp[2kD(x,y)]
(6) ⇒ (1). In view of Proposition 6.1.6 and the homogeneity of D, it
suffices to show that if {fn} and {ϕn} are sequences in F and H(D, X),
respectively, then some subsequence of {fn ◦ ϕn} converges to g ∈ C (V, Y ∗
)
on some neighborhood V of 0. If, for each compact K ⊂ Y and neighborhood
V of 0, fn ◦ ϕn(V ) ∩ K = ∅ eventually, we are finished. Otherwise we may
assume a sequence {zn} in D1/2 such that {fn ◦ ϕn (zn)} is bounded. There
is a c > 1 such that, for each z ∈ D1/2,
cµ (fn ◦ ϕn, z) ≤ [cµ (fn ◦ ϕn, zn)]exp[2dD(z,zn)]
and {fn ◦ ϕn} is uniformly bounded on D1/2.
In Corollary 6.3.9 we apply equivalence (2) in Theorem 6.3.7 to extend the
following lemma of Bohr to holomorphic functions defined on complex spaces
(see [111, p. 50]).
Lemma 6.3.8. Suppose that w = f(z) is regular in |z| ≤ 1, satisfies f(0) = 0,
and
max
|z|=1/2
|f(z)| ≥ 1 .
Then f(z) assumes in |z| < 1 all values on some circle |w| = r, where r > A
and A is a positive absolute constant.
Corollary 6.3.9. Let X be a complex space, and let B ⊂ X, f ∈ H(X, C)
satisfy
(1) B is bounded with respect to the pseudometric kX,
(2) supx∈B |f(x)| > 1 and
(3) 0 ∈ f(B).
Then there is an r > 0 independent of f such that
{w ∈ C : r < |w| < 2r} ⊂ f(X) or {w ∈ C : 4r < |w| < 5r} ⊂ f(X).
Proof. We note that H(X, C\{0, 1}) is a uniformly normal family in H(X, C).
By Theorem 6.3.7, there is a c > 0 such that
|α(p)| ≤ exp [c [exp (2kX(p, q)) − 1]]

and define ϕ ∈ H(X, C \ {0, 1}) by ϕ(p) = (f(p) − w1) / (w2 − w1). There is
a q ∈ B such that f(q) = 0; hence |ϕ(q)| ≤ 1 and, for each p ∈ B, |ϕ(p)| ≤ A
and
|f(p)| = |ϕ(p) (w2 − w1) + w1| ≤ A (|w2| + |w1|) + |w1| ≤ (7A + 2)r = 1 .
This is a contradiction.
Remark 6.3.10. Equivalences (1) ⇒ (3) ⇒ (4) ⇒ (1) of Theorem 6.3.7 are
due to Zaidenberg [290] for uniformly normal families of functions defined
on complex manifolds. In Theorem 6.3.14, we provide a generalization of the
following five-point theorem of Lappan [160].
Theorem 6.3.11. Let A be a subset of P1

We extend this theorem of Lappan to uniformly normal families from arbi￾trary complex spaces to Pn(C) by first extending the theorem to such families
defined on hyperbolic manifolds and then using equivalence (2) of Proposi￾tions 6.1.6 and 6.3.1 (also see [101], [100], [103]).
We say that g ∈ H (C
m, Pn(C)) is degenerate if g (C
m) ⊂ π for some
hyperplane π in Pn(C).
Theorem 6.3.12. Let M be a hyperbolic manifold, let σ be a collection of at
least 2n + 3 hyperplanes in general position in Pn(C) and let A =
S
σ
π.
Then F ⊂ H (M, Pn(C)) is uniformly normal if and only if the following
two conditions hold:
(1) We have that sup 
|df(p)| : p ∈
S
F
f
−1
(A)
	
< ∞, and
(2) Each degenerate Brody limit for F is constant.
Proof. The necessity of the two conditions is obvious from equivalences (4)
and (6) of Theorem 6.2.5 since all length functions on P
n(C) are equivalent.
To establish the sufficiency we will show that if condition (2) holds and F is
not uniformly normal then condition (1) fails. To effect this demonstration
we use some additional terminology and the following lemma of Hahn [101]
which generalizes a well-known result in Nevanlinna theory for meromorphic
functions (see [116, Corollary 3, p. 231]). If π is a hyperplane in Pn(C) let
Tπ be a nonzero linear functional on C
n+1 for which π is the kernel. I190 Some Classical Theorems
is a collection of hyperplanes in general position in Pn(C), we say that a
nondegenerate g ∈ H (C
m, Pn(C)) is totally ramified over σ if for each π ∈ σ,
(Tπ ◦ g)
0
(ζ) = 0 whenever Tπ ◦ g(ζ) = 0. We need this lemma to complete the
proof:
Lemma 6.3.13. Let σ = {π1, . . . , πq} be any collection of hyperplanes in
general position in Pn(C). If g ∈ H (C
m, Pn(C)) is totally ramified over σ,
then q ≤ 2n + 2.
Now we complete the proof. Since Pn(C) is compact and F is not uni￾formly normal, there is a nonconstant Brody limit g ∈ H (C, Pn(C)) for F
by equivalence (6) of Theorem 6.2.5. Let {fk}, {ψk} be sequences such that
fk ∈ F, ψk ∈ H (Dk, M), and fk ◦ ψk → g. From (2), g is nondegenerate
and from Lemma 6.3.13 g is not totally ramified over {π} for some π ∈ σ.
Choose homogeneous coordinates [
◦w, . . . , nw] of Pn(C) so that π is defined
by ◦w = 0. If gk = fk ◦ ψk, we represent g and gk by the homogeneous co￾ordinates [
◦
g, . . . , ng] and [
◦
gk, . . . ,
ngk], respectively, where s
g and s
gk are
holomorphic and ◦
gk → ◦
g. The equation ◦
g(z) = 0 has a solution z0 ∈ C
for which ◦
g
0
(z0) 6= 0, and hence if E is a length function on Pn(C), we have
E (g (z0), dg (z0, e)) = α 6= 0. By Hurwitz’s lemma there is a sequence {zk}
in C such that zk → z0,
◦
gk (zk) = 0, and E (gk (zk), dgk (zk, e)) → α. Let
pk = ψk (zk). Then

We are now in a position to prove the following generalization of the the￾orem of Lappan.

6.4 Extension and Convergence Theorems
A pseudo-length function [157] on a complex space X is an upper-semi￾continuous non-negative function H on the tangent cone, T(X), such that
H(av) = |a|H(v) for a ∈ C and v, av ∈ T(X).
A length function is a pseudo-length function which is continuous and
H(v) > 0 for all nonzero v ∈ T(X).
Every pseudo-length function H on a complex space X gives rise to an
inner pseudo-distance dH by
dH(x, y) = inf

where γ : [a, b] → X is a piecewise C
1
curve joining x to y and γ

(t) is the
velocity vector of γ at γ(t). If H is a length function, then dH is a distance
function.
A Hermitian metric on a complex manifold X defines a length function.
However, a length function is much more general than a Hermitian metric or
even a Finsler metric.
The distance function dH is known to generate the topology on X [157].
If X is a complex space, kX (KX) will denote the Kobayashi pseudodistance
(Kobayashi-Royden semi-length function [157]) on X. The notation f
∗E repre￾sents the pull-back of the semi-length function E by f (i.e. f
∗E(v) = E(df(v))
for v ∈ T(X)).
If Y is a complex space and E is a length function on Y we denote by dE
the distance function generated on Y by E [157].
Let X be a complex subspace of a complex space Y . Set
FX,Y =

f ∈ H(D, Y ) : f
−1
(Y \ X) is at most a singleton 	
.
Then, using the family FX,Y instead of H(D, X), Kobayashi [137] defined
another intrinsic pseudodistance kX,Y on X and its infinitesimal form KX,Y
when X is a complex submanifold of a complex manifold Y .
If no f ∈ FX,Y satisfies f(0) = p and (df)0(re) = v, then KX,Y (p, v) is
defined to be ∞. It was noted by Kobayashi in [137] that kD∗,D = kD, and,
indeed, he proves in his book that k(D∗)m,Dm = kDm for each positive integer
m.
The norm |df|E of the tangent map for f ∈ H(M, Y ) with respect to E is
defined by
|df|E = sup {|df(p)|E : p ∈ M} where
|df(p)|E = sup 
E(f(p), df(p, v)) : F
K
M (p, v) = 1	
.
(We will use simply |df| and |df(p)| when no confusion may arise).
Recall that a complex subspace X of a complex space Y is hyperbolically
imbedded in Y if, for p, q ∈ X, p =6 q, there are sets V, W open in Y about p, q
respectively such that kX(V ∩ X, W ∩ X) > 0 [129].
Example 6.4.1. Royden showed (Theorem 2 in [254]) that a complex mani￾fold M is hyperbolic if and only if H(D, M) is evenly continuous, and Abate
showed (Theorem 1.3 in [1]) that M is hyperbolic if and only if H(D, M) is
relatively compact in C (D, M∗
). Hence H(D, M) is a uniformly normal family
if and only if M is hyperbolic.
Example 6.4.2. It is shown in Theorem 2 in [129] that a complex subspace X
of a complex space Y is hyperbolically imbedded in Y if and only if H(D, X) is
relatively compact in C (D, Y ∗
), i.e. if and only if H(D, X) is a uniformly nor￾mal subfamily of H(D, Y ). This is a generalization of Kiernan’s theorem [129]
which deals with the case when X is relatively compact in Y .Extension and Convergence Theorems 193
For r > 0, let Dr = {z ∈ C : |z| < r} and D∗
r = Dr \ {0}.
Theorem 6.4.3. Let M be a hyperbolic manifold and let Y be a complex
space. Then F ⊂ H(M, Y ) is uniformly normal if and only if there is a length
function E on Y such that |df|E ≤ 1 for each f ∈ F.
Proof. Necessity. Clearly F ◦ H(D, M) is an evenly continuous subset of
H(D, Y ). We will show first that, for each length function E on Y and compact
Q ⊂ Y , there exists c > 0 such that |df| ≤ c on f
−1
(Q) for each f ∈ F. If
Q ⊂ Y is compact and fails the stated condition for the length function E, we
choose sequences {pn}, {fn} , {vn} and q ∈ Q, such that pn ∈ M, fn ∈ F, vn ∈
Tpn
(M), fn (pn) ∈ Q, KM (pn, vn) = 1, fn (pn) → q and E

It follows that

→ ∞ and we choose a sequence {ϕn} in H(D, M)
satisfying ϕn(0) = pn and |(dfn ◦ ϕn)
0
| → ∞. Let V be a relatively compact
neighborhood of q hyperbolically imbedded in Y . Since F ◦ H(D, M) is an
evenly continuous subset of H(D, Y ), we choose 0 < r < 1 such that fn ◦
ϕn (Dr) ⊂ V ; the sequence of restrictions of {fn ◦ ϕn} to Dr, which we call
again {fn ◦ ϕn}, is uniformly normal and is consequently relatively compact
in H (Dr, Y ). Some subsequence of {fn ◦ ϕn} converges to h ∈ H (Dr, Y ),
contradicting |(dfn ◦ ϕn)
0
| → ∞. Now, to complete the proof of the necessity,
choose sequences {Vn} , {cn} such that Vn is open and relatively compact in
Y, Vn ⊂ Vn+1,
S∞

Vn = Y, cn > 0 and |df|E ≤ cn on f

for each f ∈ F.
Choose a positive continuous function µ on Y such that µ(q)cn ≤ 1 on Vn. The
length function H on Y defined by H(v) = µ(q)E(v) for v ∈ Tq(Y ) satisfies
|df|H ≤ 1 for each f ∈ F ([157, p. 34]).
Sufficiency. Each f ∈ F ◦ H(D, M) is distance decreasing with respect
to kD and dE and the desired conclusion follows from Propositions 6.1.6 and
Theorem 3.1.5.

the group of automorphisms of D, and normal in the sense of Montel. The

represents the spherical metric. Carathéodory ([36, p. 202]) showed in this sit￾uation that F ◦ H(D, M) is normal in the sense of Montel. So F is uniformly
nor194 Some Classical Theorems
The normal maps studied in [81], [105], and [144] are all normal maps in
our sense.
Theorem 6.4.6. Let N be a hyperbolically imbedded complex submanifold
of a complex manifold M and let Y be a complex space. The following are
equivalent for F ⊂ H(N, Y ):
(1) The family F is uniformly normal.
(2) If p ∈ Y and {gn} , {zn} are sequences in F ◦ H (D∗
, N), D∗
,
respectively, such that zn → 0 and gn (zn) → p, then for each neigh￾borhood U of p there is an r, 0 < r < 1, satisfying gn (D∗
r
) ⊂ U.
(3) There is a length function E on Y such that f
∗E ≤ KN,M for
each f ∈ F.
Proof. (1) =⇒ (2). From Theorem 6.4.3 and the fact that N is hyperbolic,
there exists a length function E on Y such that each f ∈ F ◦ H (D∗
, N) is
distance decreasing with respect to kD∗ and dE. The proof that (2) holds
may be completed by arguments similar to those in [128] and (1) =⇒ (2) of
Theorem 1 in [123].
(2) =⇒ (3). We show that for any compact Q ⊂ Y and length func￾tion E on Y there exists c > 0 such that cE ((df)p(v)) ≤ 1 when f ∈
F, f(p) ∈ Q, v ∈ Tp(N) and KN,M(p, v) = 1. The proof may then be com￾pleted as in the proof of the necessity of Theorem 6.4.3. Suppose Q ⊂ Y
is compact and fails the stated condition for the length function E. We
choose q ∈ Q and sequences {fn} , {pn} , {vn} such that fn ∈ F, fn (pn) ∈
Q, vn ∈ Tpn

fn (pn) → q. We choose sequences {ϕn} in FN,M, {rn} in (1), (2) satisfying
ϕn(0) = pn,(dϕn)
0
(rne) = vn and E ((dfn ◦ ϕn)

(rne)) > n. Suppose there
exists r, 0 < r < 1, such that a subsequence of the sequence of restrictions of
{fn ◦ ϕn} to Dr, called again {fn ◦ ϕn}, satisfies fn ◦ ϕn ∈ F ◦ H (Dr, N); for
such r it follows from (2) that F ◦ H (Dr, N) is evenly continuous and since
fn ◦ϕn(0) → q we again obtain a contradiction as in the proof of the necessity
of Theorem 6.4.3. Alternatively we can choose a sequence {zn} in D∗
such
that zn → 0 and ϕn (zn) ∈ M \ N, and a sequence {αn} in A(D) such that
αn(0) = zn; let hn = ϕn ◦αn on D∗

Proof. The proof is by induction on m. Equivalence (2) of Theorem 6.4.6
establishes the result for m = 1. Suppose the statement is true for the integer k
but not for the integer k+1. Let F ⊂ H 

{wn} , {w

and let {fn} be a sequence in F such that fn (wn) → p while fn (w

Let U, V be open relatively compact neighborhoods of p such that V ⊂ U

Then F ◦ F1 ⊂ H 

If {An} is a sequence of subsets of a topological space, then we define
the limit superior of the sequence An to be the collection of elements x of
the space with the property that each neighborhood of x intersects An for
infinitely many n. We use the notation lim sup An for this set.
Theorem 6.4.8. Let M be a complex manifold, let A be a divisor on M with
normal crossings, let F ⊂ H(M \ A, Y ) be uniformly normal and let F be the
closure of F in C (M \ A, Y ∗
).
Then
(1) Each f ∈ F extends to fe∈ C (M, Y ∗
).
(2) The space C

M, Y ∗
; F

is compact in C (M, Y ∗
).
(3) If {fn} is a sequence in F and fn → f, then fen → fe.
(4) For each sequence {fn} in F there is a subsequence {fnk
} of
{fn} such that lim sup f

(Q) = ∅ in the topology
of M for each pair P, Q of disjoint subsets of Y with P compact in
Y and Q closed in Y .196 Some Classical Theorems
(5) If M is hyperbolic and KM\A,M = KM, then H

M, Y ∗
; F

is
uniformly normal.
Proof. As for the proofs of (1) and (2), we show first that each f ∈ F extends
to fe ∈ C (M, Y ∗
) and that C [M, Y ∗
; F] is relatively compact in C (M, Y ∗
).
Since the considerations involved are local in nature, we may assume that
M = Dm, F ⊂ H ((D∗
)
m , Y ), and we show that each f ∈ F extends to
˜f ∈ C (Dm, Y ∗
) and that C [(D)
m, Y ∗
; F] is evenly continuous from Dm to
Y
∗
; Lemma 6.4.7 leads to these conclusions as in (1) =⇒ (2) of Theorem 8
and Corollary 7 in [123]. To finish the proof of (1), if f ∈ F, then there exists
a sequence {fn} in F such that fn → f. There exists a subsequence {fnk
} of
{fn} such that fenk → g ∈ C (M, Y ∗
) ; nowg = fe so (1) holds. To establish
(2), we show that C

M, Y ∗
; F

= C [M, Y ∗
; F]. If g ∈ F, choose a sequence
{fn} in F such that fn → g. It follows that fenk → ge for some subsequence
{fnk
} of {fn} and one inclusion is established. For the other inclusion, if {fn}
is a sequence in F and fen → g, then fn → g on M \ A. To see that (3) holds
note that, from (2), each subsequence of n
fen
o
has a convergent subsequence;
and that if n
fenk
o
is a convergent subsequence, then fenk → fe. For the proof
of (4) we see from (2) that there is a subsequence {fnk
} of {fn} such that
fenk → g ∈ C (M, Y ∗
). If P, Q are respectively compact and closed subsets
of Y and x ∈ lim sup f
−1
nk
(P) ∩ lim sup f
−1
nk
(Q), then fenk
(x) → g(x) and for
each V open about x, fnk
(V \ A) ∩ P 6= ∅ and fnk
(V \ A) ∩ Q 6= ∅ occur
frequently. Hence g(x) ∈ P ∩ Q in Y
∗
. Since P is compact in Y and Q is
closed in Y, g(x) ∈ P ∩ Q.
Finally we prove (5). From Theorem 6.4.6 part (3), let E be a length func￾tion on Y such that f
∗E ≤ KM−A,M for each f ∈ F. Let fe∈ H 
M, Y ∗
; F

.
There is a sequence {fn} in F such that fn → f. It follows that fe∗E ≤
KM\A,M = KM.
Remark 6.4.9. Theorem 6.4.8 parts (1), (2), and (3) extend work of the
authors [123] to uniformly normal families from complex manifolds having
divisors with normal crossings in complex spaces. The results in [123] gener￾alize work of Järvi [119], Kobayashi [135], Kwack [152], Kiernan [128], and
Noguchi [222, 223]. Theorem 2.3 part (5) generalizes a second result in [119].
In particular we have the following corollary.
Corollary 6.4.10. Let Y be a complex space, and let M and M \ A be hy￾perbolic manifolds as defined in any one of the following four cases:
(1) We have M \ A = (D∗
)
n−k
× Dk and M = Dn.
(2) We have M \ A = (D∗
)
n
and M = Dn.
(3) We have that A is a closed analytic subset of M of codimension
at least 2.Extension and Convergence Theorems 197
(4) We have that M is n-dimensional and A is a closed subset of
M with (2n − 2)-dimensional Hausdorff measure equal to zero.
Let F ⊂ H(M \ A, Y ) be uniformly normal, and let F be the closure in
C (M \ A, Y ∗
). Then H

M, Y ∗
; F

is uniformly normal.
Proof. The proof follows from Theorem 6.4.8 part (5) since in each case KM =
KM\A,M (see [34] for (4)).
Theorem 6.4.11. The following statements are equivalent for complex spaces
X, Y and F ⊂ H(X, Y ), where F ◦ H (D∗, X) is the closure of F in
C (D∗
, Y ∗
):
(1) The family F is uniformly normal.
(2) The family F ◦ H (D∗
, X) is uniformly normal.
(3) The space C [D, Y ∗
; F ◦ H (D∗
, X)] is relatively compact in
C (D, Y ∗
).
(4) For each sequence {fn} in F ◦ H (D∗, X) there is a subsequence
{fnk
} of {fn} such that lim sup f

nk
(P)∩lim sup f
−1
nk
(Q) = ∅ in the
topology of D for each pair of disjoint subsets P, Q of Y with P
compact in Y and Q closed in Y .
(5) The family F satisfies the following three conditions:
(a) The family F ◦ H (D∗
, X) is relatively compact in C (D∗
, Y ∗
),
(b) Each f ∈ F ◦ H (D∗
, X) extends to fe∈ C (D, Y ∗
), and
(c) If {fn} is a sequence in F ◦ H (D∗
, X) such that fn → f, then
fen → fe.
Proof. (1) =⇒ (2). Follows from Proposition 6.1.6 part (2).
(2) =⇒ (3). From (2) of Theorem 6.4.8 and the set inclusion

(3) =⇒ (1). From the fact that F ◦ H(D, X) is a subset of the collection of
extensions in (3).
(2) =⇒ (4). From (2) and (4) of Theorem 6.4.8.
(4) =⇒ (3). We show that C [D, Y ∗
; F ◦ H (D∗
, X)] is evenly continuous.
If this is not the case choose sequences {fn} in F ◦ H (D∗
, X), {vn} , {xn} in
D∗
, x ∈ D, y ∈ Y , and open sets W1, W2 in Y about y such that W1 ⊂ W2, W1
compact, vn → x, xn → x, fn (vn) → y, and fn (xn) ∈ Y \ W2. For any sub￾sequence {fnk

even though W1 ∩ (Y \ W2) = ∅, so (4) does not hold.
(2) =⇒ (5). Condition (a) follows from definition, condition (b) from (1)
of Theorem 6.4.8 and condition (c) from (3) of Theorem 6.4.8198 Some Classical Theorems
(5) =⇒ (3). Let {fn} be a sequence in F ◦ H (D∗

} of {fn} such that fnk → f ∈
C (D∗
, Y ∗
) ; ˜fnk
, fe exist for each k by condition (b) and fenk → ˜f by con￾dition (c).
Kiernan [129] gave further insight into the concept of hyperbolic imbed￾dedness by showing that a relatively compact complex subspace X of a com￾plex space Y is hyperbolically imbedded in Y if and only if there is a length
function E on Y such that f
∗E ≤ KD for each f ∈ H(D, X). Our Theo￾rem 6.4.12 provides additional insight into the role of hyperbolic imbeddedness
in Kobayashi’s generalization of the big Picard theorem ([135, Theorem 6.1]).
Zaidenberg has provided a number of other criteria for hyperbolic imbedded￾ness and hyperbolicity in [289].
Theorem 6.4.12. Let X be a complex subspace of a complex space Y . The
following statements are equivalent:
(1) The space X is hyperbolically imbedded in Y .
(2) The family H (D∗
, X) is a uniformly normal subfamily of
H (D∗
, Y )
(3) There exists a length function E on Y such that each f ∈
H (D∗
, X) satisfies f
∗E ≤ KD∗ .
(4) There exists a distance function d on Y such that each f ∈
H (D∗
, X) is distance decreasing with respect to kD∗ and d.
Proof. (1) =⇒ (2). It is obvious that H (D∗
, X) ◦ H (D, D∗
) ⊂ H(D, X) and
hence H (D∗
, X) is a uniformly normal subfamily of H (D∗
, Y ) (see Example
1.5).
(2) =⇒ (3). Since D∗
is hyperbolically imbedded in D, by Theorem 6.4.6
part (3) there exists a length function E on Y satisfying f
∗E ≤ KD∗,D =
KD ≤ KD∗ for each f ∈ H (D∗
, X).
(3) =⇒ (4). The distance function induced on Y by the length function
E promised in (3) meets the requirements of (4).
(4) =⇒ (1). It follows from Proposition 3.1.5 that H (D∗
, X) is relatively
compact in C (D∗
, Y ∗
). Let {fn} be a sequence in H(D, X) such that fn →
f ∈ C (D∗
, Y ∗
) on D∗
. We show that f extends to fe ∈ C (D, Y ∗
) and that
fn → fe on D. This will complete the proof of (4) =⇒ (1) in view of the
result referred to in Example 6.4.2. If for each compact Q ⊂ Y there exists a
neighborhood V of 0 in D satisfying fn(V ) ∩ Q = ∅, thenf may be extended
to fe ∈ C (D, Y ∗
) by defining fe(0) = ∞, and fn → fe on D. Otherwise,
choose a subsequence of {fn}, called again {fn}, a sequence {zn}inD∗
, and
p ∈ Y such that |zn| ↓ 0, fn (zn) → p. If rn ↓ 0, the hyperbolic length of
σrn = {z ∈ D : |z| = rn} in D∗
converges to 0; it follows from (4) and winding
number arguments modeled after those of Grauert and Reckziegel ( [87, p.
120]) and found in [123] and [128], that fn(0) → p, fn (z
0
n
) → p for anySeparately Normal Maps 199
sequence {z
0
n} for which z
0
n → 0. Hence f may be extended to fe∈ C (D, Y ∗
)
by defining fe(0) = p, and fn → fe on D.
Remark 6.4.13. The equivalence (1) ⇐⇒ (3) in Theorem 6.4.12 shows sur￾prisingly that the statement obtained by dropping the relative compactness
of X and replacing D by D∗
in Kiernan’s result is valid.
Remark 6.4.14. Let X be a complex subspace of a complex space Y . Kwack’s
generalization of the big Picard theorem establishes that f ∈ H (D∗
, X) is
extendable to fe ∈ H(D, Y ) if (1) There exists a distance function d on Y
such that f is distance decreasing with respect to kD∗ and d, and (2) There
exists a sequence {zn} in D∗ and a p ∈ Y such that zn → 0 and f (zn) → p
(Theorem 3 in [152]). We observe from (1) ⇐⇒ (3) in Theorem 6.4.12 that,
under the hypothesis of Kobayashi’s generalization [135] of Kwack’s theorem,
all f ∈ H (D∗
, X) satisfy conditions (1) and (2).
Remark 6.4.15. The equivalence (1) ⇐⇒ (2) of Theorem 6.4.12 establishes
that a complex space X is hyperbolic if and only if H (D∗
, X) is a uniformly
normal subfamily of H (D∗
, X) (compare with Abate’s characterization cited
in Example 6.4.1).
6.5 Separately Normal Maps
Barth [19] proved that separately holomorphic maps into hyperbolic space
are holomorphic and also a separately normal family of maps into hyperbolic
space is a normal family. Extending these results, we prove that normal maps
and uniformly normal families satisfy similar results.
Let X, Y be complex spaces. A family of maps F ⊂ T (Dn, Y ) is said to
satisfy separately a property P if at each point p =

unit disk D under the projection onto the i-th coordinate.
Theorem 6.5.1. Let Y be a complex space and let F be a collection of maps
from Dn to Y . Suppose that each f ∈ F is separately holomorphic and that
there is a length function E on Y such that for i = 1, . . . , n, p ∈ Dn, q ∈ Di(p),
dE(f(p), f(q)) ≤ kD
￾
p(i)
, q(i)

, for all f ∈ F.
Then F is uniformly normal.
Proof. From the triangle inequality and the property of hyperbolic distances
that for p, q ∈ Dn
kDn (p, q) = max 
kD
￾
p(i)

	
it follows that
dE(f(p), f(q)) ≤
XkD
￾
p(i)
, q(i)

≤ nkDn (p, q), for all f ∈ F .
Then since f ∈ F is distance-decreasing with respect to the distances dE
and nkDn , f ∈ F is continuous. Since f is also separately holomorphic, it is
holomorphic. Now it follows from Theorem 6.4.12 that F is uniformly normal.
This function f is separately normal but not continuous at (0, 0).

Normal Families of Holomorphic
Functions and Mappings on a
Banach Space
Preamble: This chapter treats the theory of normal families in the context of
infinite-dimensional spaces. The material presented here sets our book apart
from other treatments of normal families. It is quite modern, and it is fasci￾nating.
Holomorphic function theory in infinitely many variables is complicated
because standard devices used in the finite-dimensional setting are no longer
valid. For instance, it is not the case in a Banach space that a domain may be
exhausted by compact sets. It is also no longer the case that the compact-open
topology is the most useful topology on holomorphic functions.
So we will have to give a number of new definitions in this chapter. We
will provide copious examples to illustrate how things have changed in this
new context.
But we will also give a number of positive results. The theory is especially
rich on Hilbert space.
The authors lay the foundations for the study of normal families of holo￾morphic functions and mappings on an infinite-dimensional normed linear
space. Characterizations of normal families, in terms of value distribution,
spherical derivatives, and other geometric properties are derived. Montel-type
theorems are established. A number of different topologies on spaces of holo￾morphic mappings are considered. Theorems about normal families are for￾mulated and proved in the language of these various topologies.
Normal functions are also introduced. Characterizations in terms of auto￾morphisms and also in terms of invariant derivatives are presented.
7.1 Introduction
The theory of holomorphic functions of infinitely many complex variables is at
least seventy years old. Pioneers of the subject were Nachbin [16–18, 203–217],
DOI: 10.1201/9781032669861-7 201202 Normal Families of Holomorphic Functions
Gruman and Kiselman [96], and Mujica [202]. After a quiet period of nearly
two decades, the discipline is now enjoying a rebirth thanks to the ideas of
Lempert [168, 169, 171–173]. Lempert has taught us that it is worthwhile to
restrict attention to particular Banach spaces, and he has directed our efforts
to especially fruitful questions.
The work of the present chapter is inspired by the results of [130]. That
paper studied domains in a Hilbert space with an automorphism group orbit
accumulating at a boundary point. As was the case in even one complex
variable, normal families played a decisive role in that study. With a view to
extending those explorations, it now seems appropriate to lay the foundations
for normal families in infinitely many complex variables.
One of the thrusts of the present book is to demonstrate that normal fam￾ilies may be understood from several different points of view. These include:
2. Hyperbolic geometry
3. Functional analysis
4. Distribution theory
5. Currents
6. Comparison of different topologies and norms on the space of holo￾morphic functions
It is our intention to explain these different approaches to the subject, in
the infinite-dimensional context, and to establish relationships among them.
A second thrust is to relate the normality of a family on the entire space
X (or on a domain in X) to the normality of the restriction of the family to
slices (suitably formulated). This point of view was initiated in [47], and it
has proved useful and intuitively natural.
Throughout this paper, X is a separable Banach space over the scalar field
C, Ω is a domain (a connected open set) in X, F = {fα}α∈A is a family of holo￾morphic functions on Ω, and D ⊆ C is the unit disk. If Ω
0
is another domain
in some other separable Banach space Y , then we will also consider families
{Fα} of holomorphic mappings from Ω to Ω
0
. Although separability of X is
not essential to all of our results, it is a convenient tool in many arguments.
Certainly, in the past, the theory of infinite dimensional holomorphy has been
hampered by a tendency to shy away from such useful extra hypotheses.
Part of the beauty and utility of studying infinite-dimensional holomorphy
is that the work enhances our study of finite-dimensional holomorphy. Indeed,
it is safe to say that the present study has caused us to re-invent what a
normal family of holomorphic functions ought to be.
One of the interesting features of the present work, making it different
from more classical treatments in finite dimensions, is that compact sets now
play a different role. If W is a given open set in our space X (say the unit ball
in a separable Hilbert space), then W cannot be exhausted by an increasing
union of compact sets in any obvious way. Another feature is that, in finite
dimensions, all reasonable topologies on the space of holomorphic functionsBasic Definitions 203
on a given domain are equivalent. In infinitely many variables this is no longer
the case, and we hope to elucidate the matter both with examples and results
relating the different topologies. We will define holomorphic functions on a
Banach space below.
A final note is that there are interesting underlying questions, throughout
our study, about the geometry of Banach spaces. We sidestep most of these
by concentrating our efforts on separable Banach spaces; most of our deepest
results are in separable Hilbert spaces. We intend to study the deeper questions
of the geometry of Banach space, and their impact on normal families, in a
future work.
It is a pleasure to thank John McCarthy for helpful conversations about
various topics in this paper. Eric Bedford also pointed us in some interesting
directions.
7.2 Basic Definitions
We will now define holomorphic functions and mappings and normal families.
We refer the reader to the paper [130] and the book [203] for background on
complex analysis in infinite dimensions.
Definition 7.2.1. A domain Ω ⊆ X is a connected open set.
Definition 7.2.2. Let X be a separable Banach space. Let Ω ⊆ X be an open
set. Let u : Ω → Y be a mapping, where Y is some other separable Banach
space. For q ∈ Ω and v1, . . . , vk ∈ X, we define the derivatives
du (q; vj ) = lim
R3→0
u (q + vj ) − u(q)

and
Du(q; v) = du(q; v) + idu(q;iv)
2
.
In what follows, we use the word “function” to refer to a (complex) scalar￾valued object and “mapping” to refer to a Banach-space-valued object as in
Definition 7.2.2.
A function (mapping) f on Ω is said to be continuously differentiable, or
C
1
, if df(q; v) exists for every point q ∈ Ω and every vector v, and if the
resulting function (q, v) 7→ df(q; v) is continuous.
Definition 7.2.3. Let Ω ⊆ X be an open set and f a C
1
-smooth function or
mapping defined on Ω. We say that f is holomorphic on Ω if Df ≡ 0 on Ω.
The definition just given of “holomorphic function” or “holomorphic map￾ping” is equivalent, in the C
1

smooth,
but holomorphicity can, in principle, be defined for rougher functions.
Definition 7.2.4. Let F = {fα}α∈A be a family of holomorphic functions
on a domain Ω ⊆ X. We say that F is a normal family if every subsequence
{fj} ⊆ F either
7.2.4.1 (normal convergence) has a subsequence that converges uni￾formly on compact subsets of Ω;
or
7.2.4.2 (compact divergence) has a subsequence {fjk
} such that, for
each compact K ⊆ Ω and each compact L ⊆ C, there is a number N so large
that fjk
(K) ∩ L = ∅ whenever k ≥ N.
It is convenient at this juncture to define a type of topology that will be
of particular interest for us. If Ω ⊆ X is a domain and O(Ω) the space of
holomorphic functions on Ω, then we let B denote the topology on O(Ω) of
uniform convergence on compact sets. Of course a sub-basis for the topology
B is given by the sets (with  > 0, g ∈ O(Ω) arbitrary, and K ⊆ Ω a compact
set)

It is elementary to verify (or see [203]) that the limit of a sequence of holo￾morphic functions on Ω, taken in the topology B, will be another holomorphic
function on Ω. Indeed, it is clear that the limit of such a sequence is holo￾morphic on any finite-dimensional slice (this property is commonly called “G￾holomorphic”). The limit function is clearly locally bounded. Now it follows
(see [203, p. 74]) that the limit is holomorphic.
Definition 7.2.5. Let Ω ⊆ X be a domain. Let U ≡ {Uα}α∈A be a semi-norm
topology on the space O(Ω) of holomorphic functions on Ω.
1 A real-valued
function p : X → R is called a seminorm if it satisfies the following two
conditions:
1 Triangle inequality: p(x + y) ≤ p(x) + p(y) for all x, y ∈ X.
2 Absolute homogenity: p(sx) = |s| p(x) for all x ∈ X and all scalars s.
These two conditions imply that p(0) = 0 and that every seminorm p also
has the following property:
3 Nonnegativity p(x) ≥ 0 for all x ∈ X.
Some authors include non-negativity as part of the definition of “semi￾norm” (and also sometimes of “norm”), although this is not necessary since it
follows from the other two properties.
1Let X be a vector space over either real numbers R or the complex numbers C.Basic Definitions 205
By definition, a norm on X is a seminorm that also separates points,
meaning that it has the following additional property:
4 Positive definite: whenever x ∈ X satisfies p(x) = 0 then x = 0.
2 We say that U is a Montel topology on O(Ω) if the mapping
id : [O(Ω), U] −→ [O(Ω), B]
f 7−→ f
is a compact operator.
Example 7.2.6. (1) Let Ω ⊆ C
n be a domain in finite-dimensional
complex space. The topology B is a Montel topology. This is the con￾tent of the classical Montel theorem on normal families (see [203]).
(2) Let Ω ⊆ C be a domain in one-dimensional complex space.
Let k be a positive integer, and let superscript (k) denote the k
th
derivative. The topology Ck with sub-basis given by the union of
the sets (with  > 0, g ∈ O(Ω) arbitrary, and K ⊆ Ω a compact
set)

for j = 0, 1, . . . , k, is a Montel topology. Of course, by integration
(and using the Cauchy estimates), the topology Ck is equivalent to
the topology B. [A similar topology can be defined for holomorphic
functions on a domain in the finite-dimensional space C
n.]
(3) Let Ω ⊆ C be a domain in one-dimensional complex space. The
topology D with sub-basis given by the sets (with  > 0, g ∈ O(Ω)
arbitrary, and γ˜ ⊆ Ω the compact image of a closed curve γ : [0, 1] →
Ω)

is a Montel topology, as the reader may verify by using the Cauchy
estimates. Of course, once again, the maximum principle may be
used to check that the topology D is equivalent to the topology B.
(4) In the reference [208], Leopoldo Nachbin defined the concept of
a seminorm that is “ported” by a compact set. We review the notion
here.
Let X and Y be separable Banach spaces as usual. Let Ω ⊆ X be a domain,
and let K ⊆ Ω be a fixed compact subset. We consider the family H(Ω, Y ) of
holomorphic mappings from Ω to Y . A seminorm ρ on H(Ω, Y ) is said to be
2A seminormed space is a pair (X, p) consisting of a vector space X and a seminorm p
on X. If the seminorm p is also a norm then the seminormed space (X, p) is called a normed
space.206 Normal Families of Holomorphic Functions
ported by the set K if, given any open set V with K ⊆ V ⊆ Ω, we can find a
real number c(V ) > 0 such that the inequality
ρ(f) ≤ c(V ) · sup
x∈V
kf(x)k (∗)
holds for every f ∈ H(Ω, Y ).
We note that the holomorphic mapping f here need not be bounded on V .
What is true, however (and we have noted this fact elsewhere in the present
book), is that once Ω and K are fixed then there will exists some open set V
as above on which f is bounded. So that, for this choice of V , the inequality
(∗) will be non-trivial.
Now we use the notion of “seminorm ported by K” to define a topology
on H(Ω, Y ) as follows: we consider the topology induced by all seminorms
that are ported by compact subsets of Ω. It is to be noted that, in finite
dimensions, this new topology is no different from the standard compact-open
topology. But in infinite dimensions it is quite different. As an example, let
X = Y = `2 (the space of square-summable sequences), which is of course a
separable Hilbert space. Let a typical element of `2 be denoted by {aj}
∞
j=1,
and let the j
th coordinate be zj . Let Ω ⊆ X be a domain and let K ⊆ Ω be a
compact set. Consider holomorphic functions f : Ω → C. Define a semi-norm
by

Then it is clear, by the Cauchy estimates, that ρ
∗
is ported.
But it is also clear that a typical open set defined by ρ
∗ will not contain
any non-trivial open set from the compact-open topology. Thus this topology
is not Montel. Of course it is now a simple matter to generate many other
interesting examples of ported seminorms.
Now we have
Theorem 7.2.7. Let F = {fα}α∈A be a family of holomorphic functions
on a domain Ω ⊆ X. Assume that there is a finite constant M such that
|fα(z)| ≤ M for all fα ∈ F and all z ∈ Ω. Let K be a compact subset of Ω.
Then every sequence in F has itself a subsequence that converges uniformly
on K.
Proof. Of course the hypothesis of uniform boundedness precludes compact
divergence. So we will verify 7.2.4.1. Fix a compact subset K ⊆ Ω. Then there
is a number η > 0 such that if k ∈ K then B(k, 3η) ⊆ Ω. Select fα ∈ F. Now
if k ∈ K and ` is any point such that kk − `k < η then we may apply the
Cauchy estimates (on B(k, 2η)) to the restriction of fα to the complex line
through k and `. We find that the fα have bounded directional derivatives.
Therefore they are (uniformly) Lipschitz and form an equicontinuous family
of functions.Basic Definitions 207
As a result of these considerations, the Arzelà-Ascoli theorem applies to
the family F restricted to K. Thus any sequence in F has a subsequence
convergent on K.
In practice, it is useful to have a version of Theorem 7.2.7 that hypothe￾sizes only uniform boundedness on compact sets. This is a tricky point in the
infinite-dimensional setting for the following reason: Classically (in finite di￾mensions), one derives this new result from (the analog of) Theorem 7.2.7 by
taking a compact set K ⊆ Ω and fattening it up to a slightly larger compact
L ⊆ Ω. Since the family F is uniformly bounded on L, an analysis similar to
the proof of Theorem 7.2.7 may now be performed. In the infinite-dimensional
setting this attack cannot work, since there is no notion of fattening up a com￾pact set to a larger compact set.
Nonetheless, we have several different ways to prove a more general, and
more useful, version of Montel’s theorem. The statement is as follows.
Theorem 7.2.8 (Montel). Let F = {fα}α∈A be a family of holomorphic
functions on a domain Ω in a separable Banach space X. Assume that F is
uniformly bounded on compact sets, in the sense that for each compact L ⊆ Ω
there is a constant ML > 0 such that |fα(z)| ≤ ML for every z ∈ L and every
fα ∈ F. Then every sequence in F has itself a subsequence that converges
uniformly on each compact set K ⊆ Ω. [Note that we are saying that there is
a single sequence that works for every set K.] Thus F is a normal family.
Remark 7.2.9. We may rephrase Montel’s theorem by saying that the topology
B is a Montel topology.
Proof of the Theorem:. Fix a compact set K ⊆ Ω. Of course the family F is
bounded on K by hypothesis. We claim that F is bounded on some neighbor￾hood U of K. To this end, and seeking a contradiction, we suppose instead that
for each integer N > 0 there is a point xN ∈ Ω such that dist (xN , K) < 1/N
and |fα (xN )| > N. Then the set
L = K ∪ {xN }
∞
N=1
is compact. So the family F is bounded on L. But that contradicts the choice
of the xN .
We conclude that, for some N, xN does not exist. That means that there
is a number N0 > 0 such that the family F is uniformly bounded on
U ≡ {x ∈ Ω : dist(x, K) < 1/N0}. As a result, we may imitate the proof of
Theorem 7.2.7, merely substituting U for Ω.
Remark 7.2.10. We thank Laszlo Lempert for the idea of the proof of Theo￾rem 7.2.8 just presented.
We now indulge in a slight digression, partly for interest’s sake and partly
because the argument will prove useful below. In fact we will provide a proof208 Normal Families of Holomorphic Functions
of Theorem 7.2.8 that depends on the Banach-Alaoglu theorem. This is philo￾sophically appropriate, for it validates in yet another way that a normal fam￾ilies theorem is nothing other than a compactness theorem. After that we will
sketch a proof that depends on the theory of currents.
Alternative (Banach-Alaoglu) Proof of Theorem 7.2.8:
For clarity and simplicity, we begin by presenting this proof in the complex
plane C. The reader who has come this far will have no trouble adapting the
argument to finitely many complex variable space C
n. We provide a separate
argument below for the infinite dimensional case.
Now fix a domain Ω ⊆ C. Let F = {fα}α∈A be a family of holomorphic
functions on Ω which is bounded on compact sets. Fix a piecewise C
1
closed
curve γ : [0, 1] → Ω. Let γ˜ denote the image of γ, which is of course a compact
set in Ω. Consider the functions
gα ≡ fα|γ˜
Then each gα is smooth on γ˜ and the family G ≡ {gα}α∈A is bounded by some
constant M. So we may think of G ⊆ L∞(γe) as a bounded set. Since L∞(γe)
is the dual of L
1
(γe), we may apply the Banach-Alaoglu theorem to extract a
subsequence (which we denote by {gj} for convenience) that converges in the
weak-* topology. Call the weak-* limit function g.
Now fix a point z that lies in the interior, bounded component of the
complement of γ˜. Of course the function
t 7−→
γ
0
(t)
γ(t) − z
lies in L
1
(γe). So, by weak-* convergence and the Cauchy integral formula, we
know that
gj (z) ≡

2πi I
γ
gj (ζ)
ζ − z
dζ →
1
2πi I
γ
g(ζ)
ζ − z
dζ ≡ G(z)
Here the last equality defines the function G.
So we see that the functions gj , which of course must agree with fj at
points inside the curve γ, tend pointwise to the function G; and the function
G is perforce holomorphic inside the image curve γ˜. We will show that in fact
the convergence is uniform on compact sets inside of γ˜.
So fix a compact set K that lies in the bounded open set interior to γe.
Fix a piecewise C
1
, simple, closed curve γ
∗ whose image is disjoint from, and
lies inside of, γ˜, and which surrounds K. Let η > 0 be the distance of K to
γf∗, the image of γ
∗
. Now fix a small  > 0 (here  should be smaller than the
length of γ
∗
). Choose a set E ⊆ γf∗ such that E has linear measure less than
 and so that (by Lusin’s theorem)
|gj (ζ) − g(ζ)| < Basic Definitions 209
when j is sufficiently large (j > N, let us say) and ζ ∈ γf∗\E. Then, for j, k >
N and z ∈ K, we have

Since  > 0 may be chosen to be arbitrarily small, we conclude that gj → g
uniformly on the compact set K. That is what we wished to prove for the
single compact set K.
We note that this proof may be performed when γ is a positively oriented
curve describing any square inside Ω with sides parallel to the axes, rational
center, and rational side length. Of course it is always possible to produce
the curve γ
∗ as the union of finitely many such curves. As a result, the usual
diagonalization procedure may be formed over these countably many curves,
producing a single subsequence that converges uniformly on any compact set
in Ω to a limit function G.
Our next proof depends on the theory of currents. For background in this
important technique of geometric analysis, we refer the reader to [29, 72, 73,
131, 166, 167, 188].
Alternative (Currents) Proof of Theorem 7.2.8 for Separable Banach
Spaces:
We refer to the very interesting paper [9] of Almgren. That paper gives
a characterization of the dual of the space of all k-dimensional, real, rectifi￾able currents in R
N . Remarkably, Almgren’s proof uses both the Continuum
Hypothesis and the Axiom of Choice. An examination of Almgren’s proof re￾veals that the arguments are also valid when R
N is replaced by any separable
Banach space. We take that result for granted and leave it to the reader to
check the details in [9].
Accepting that assertion, we see that the hypothesis of uniform bounded￾ness of a family F of holomorphic functions on compact subsets of a domain Ω
in a separable Banach space X can be interpreted as a boundedness statement
about one-dimensional holomorphic currents. Specifically, let F be a family
of holomorphic functions on a domain Ω ⊆ X, and assume that F is bounded
on compact subsets of Ω. As we have seen (proof of Theorem 7.2.8), it follows
that if K ⊆ Ω is any compact set, then there is a small neighborhood U of
K, with K ⊂⊂ U ⊆ Ω, such that F is bounded on U. As a result, we may
apply Cauchy estimates to see that if F = {fα}α∈A then F
0 = {∂fα}α∈A
is bounded on K. But then, by the generalization of Almgren’s theorem to
infinite dimensions, we may think of F
0 as a bounded family in the dual of the
space of 1-dimensional (complex) currents on Ω. By the Banach-Alaoglu the￾orem, we may therefore extract from any sequence in F
0 a weak-* convergent
subsequence. Call it, for convenience, {fj}.210 Normal Families of Holomorphic Functions
But now it is possible to imitate the first alternative proof of Theorem 7.2.8
as follows. Fix a closed, piecewise C
1
curve γ : [0, 1] → Ω that bounds an
analytic disk d in Ω
3
.
Think of the elements ∂fj restricted to the image γ˜ of this curve. They form
a bounded family in L∞(˜γ). Thus the first alternative proof may be imitated,
step by step, to produce a limit holomorphic function on the analytic disk d.
In fact we may even take the argument a step further.
For z, w ∈ C
n the Bochner-Martinelli kernel ω(z, w) is a differential form
in ζ of bidegree (n, n − 1) defined by
ω(ζ, z) = (n − 1)!

(where the term dζj
is omitted).
Suppose that f is a continuously differentiable function on the closure of
a domain Ω in C
n with piecewise smooth boundary ∂Ω. Then the Bochner￾Martinelli formula states that if z is in the domain Ω, then
f(z) = Z
∂Ω
f(ζ)ω(ζ, z) −

Ω
∂f(ζ) ∧ ω(ζ, z).
In particular, if f is holomorphic, the second term vanishes, so
f(z) = Z
∂Ω
f(ζ)ω(ζ, z).
(For more on this topic, see, for example, [143, Section 1.1, p. 19].)
Further, we may look at any k-dimensional slice of Ω and use the Bochner￾Martinelli kernel instead of the 1-dimensional Cauchy kernel to find that there
is a uniform limit on any compact subset of any k-dimensional slice of Ω.
This produces the required limit function G for the subsequence fj . [Note
that, because we are assuming the space to be separable, we can go further
and even extract a subsequence that converges on every compact subset. More
will be said about this point in the next remark and in what follows.]
Remark 7.2.11. This last is still not the optimal version of what we usually call
Montel’s theorem. In the classical, finite-dimensional formulation of Montel’s
result we usually derive a single subsequence that converges uniformly on
every compact set. The question of whether such a result is true in infinite
dimensions is complicated by the observation that it is no longer possible,
in general, to produce a sequence of sets K1 ⊂⊂ K2 ⊂⊂ · · · ⊂⊂ X for our
Banach space X with the property that each compact subset of X lies in some
Kj .
3Recall that a holomorphic embedding of D into a Banach space E is a holomorphic
map f : D → E such that f(D) is a closed complex submanifold and f|D → f(D) is bi￾holomorphic. D can be embedded into C2
, but there is no bounded holomorphic embedding
f : D → Cn. Aurich [13] shows that the existence or nonexistence of bounded holomorphie
embeddings f : D → E depends on E.Basic Definitions 211
In fact the full-bore version of Montel’s theorem, as just described, is false.
The next example of Y. Choi illustrates what can go wrong, at least in a non￾separable Banach space. [We note in passing that most of our examples are in
separable spaces-which is the proper venue for the present study. But in some
instances we only have examples in the non-separable case.]
Example 7.2.12. Consider the Banach space X = `∞. Let
ej = (0, . . . , 0, 1, 0, . . .)
in which all components except the j
th are zero. Let e
∗
j
: X → C be defined
by
e
∗
j
 X∞
k=1

= aj .
This function is obviously holomorphic. However, the sequence 
e
∗
j
	
does not
have a subsequence that converges uniformly on compact subsets. To see this,
let us assume to the contrary that 
e
∗
jm
	∞
m=1 is a subsequence that converges
uniformly on compact subsets. Then in particular it should converge on the
singleton set consisting of the point p that is given by
p = X∞
m=1
(−1)mejm
But, e
∗
jm
(p) = (−1)m, and this sequence of scalars does not converge.
It should be noted that this example can be avoided if we demand in
advance that the Banach space X be separable. One simply produces a count￾able, dense family of open balls, extracts a convergent sequence for each such
ball, and then diagonalizes as usual. Mujica and Nachibin [203], in their treat￾ment of normal families, achieves the full result by adding a hypothesis of
pointwise convergence.
Proposition 7.2.13 ([203, p. 74]). Let U be a connected open subset of an
arbitrary Banach space X and let {fn : U → C}n=1,2,...
be a bounded sequence
of holomorphic functions in the compact-open topology. Suppose also that
there exists a nonempty open subset V of U such that the sequence {fn(x)}n
converges in C for every x ∈ V . Then, the sequence {fn}n
converges to a
holomorphic function of U uniformly on every compact subset of U.
Now we turn our attention to characterizations of normal families that de￾pend on invariant metrics. In what follows, we shall make use of the Kobayashi
metric on a domain Ω ⊆ X. It is defined as follows: If p ∈ Ω and ξ ∈ X is a
direction vector, then we set

Here kηk is the norm of the vector η ∈ X.
One of the most useful characterizations of normal families, and one that
stems naturally from invariant geometry, is Marty’s criterion. We now estab￾lish such a result in the infinite dimensional setting.
Proposition 7.2.14. Let X be a Banach space. Let Ω ⊆ X be a domain
and let F = {fα}α∈A be a family of holomorphic functions. The family F is
normal if and only if there is a constant C such that, for each (unit) direction
ξ,
|Dfα(z; ξ)|
1 + |fα(z)|
2 ≤ C · F
Ω
K(z; ξ).
Here Dfα(z; ξ) denotes the directional derivative of the function fα at the
point z in the direction ξ.
Proof. The proof follows standard lines. See the proof of Proposition 1.3 in [47,
p. 306].
We next present a rather natural characterization of normal families that
relates the situation on the ambient space to that on one-dimensional slices
(more aptly, one-dimensional analytic disks):
Proposition 7.2.15. Let X be a Banach space. Let Ω ⊆ X be a domain
and let F = {fα}α∈A be a family of holomorphic functions. The family F is
normal if and only if the following condition holds:
(∗) For each sequence ϕj : D → Ω of holomorphic mappings and each
sequence of indices αj ∈ A, j = 1, 2, . . ., the family fαj
◦ ϕj is normal on the
unit disk D.
Proof. The implication “F normal ⇒ (∗)” is immediate from Marty’s char￾acterization of normal families. For the converse, notice that if condition (∗)
holds then, for each sequence ϕj of mappings and each collection fαj
the
compositions fαj
◦ ϕj satisfy the conclusion of Marty’s theorem:

.
Here the constant C depends in principle on the choice of ϕj and also on the
choice of fαj
. But in fact a moment’s thought reveals that the choice of C can
be taken to be independent of the choice of these mappings; otherwise; there
would be a sequence for which condition (∗) fails (this is just an exercise in
logic).
But then, using the chain rule, we may conclude that Marty’s criterion for
holomorphic families on a Banach space holds for the family F (see also the
proof of Proposition 1.4 in [47, p. 307]). As a result, F is normal.Other Characterizations of Normality 213
7.3 Other Characterizations of Normality
It is an old principle of Bloch, enunciated more formally by Abraham Robinson
and actually recorded in mathematical notation by L. Zalcman (see [291]),
that any “property” that would tend to make an entire function constant
would also tend to make a family of holomorphic functions normal. Zalcman’s
formulation, while incisive, is rather narrowly bound to the linear structure of
Euclidean space. The paper [6] finds a method for formulating these ideas that
will even work on a manifold. Unfortunately, we must note that the paper [6]
has an error, which was kindly pointed out to us by the authors of [275]. We
shall include their correct formulation of the theorem, and also provide an
indication of their proof.
Proposition 7.3.1. Let X be a separable Banach space and let Ω ⊆ X be
a hyperbolic domain (i.e., a domain on which the Kobayashi metric is non￾degenerate). Let Y be another separable Banach space. Let F = {fα}α∈A ⊆
Hol(Ω, Y ). The family F is not normal if and only if there exists a sequence
{pj} ⊆ Ω with pj → p0 ∈ Ω, a sequence fj ∈ F, and {ρj} ⊆ R with ρj > 0
and ρj → 0 such that
gj (ξ) = fj (pj + ρj ξ), ξ ∈ X
satisfies one of the following assertions:
(i) The sequence {gj}j≥1
is compactly divergent on Ω;
(ii) The sequence {gj}j≥1
converges uniformly on compact subsets
of Ω to a nonconstant holomorphic mapping g : Ω → Y .
Remark 7.3.2. The error in [6] is that the authors did not take into account
the compactly divergent case in the theorem. Consider the example (also
from [275]) of the family F of mappings fj : D → C
2 given by
fj (ζ) = (αj , ζ)
where 1 > αj > 0 and αj → 0. Then the family F is not normal, but F also
does not satisfy the conclusions of part (ii) of Proposition 7.3.1 above, which
is the sole conclusion of the Aladro/Krantz theorem.
Proof. Sketch of the Proof of Proposition 7.3.1:
We first need a definition. We say that a non-negative, continuous function
E defined on the tangent bundle T Y is a length function if it satisfies
(a) E(v) = 0 if and only if v = 0.
(b)
E(αv) = |α|E(v) for all α ∈ C and all v ∈ T X. (7.1)214 Normal Families of Holomorphic Functions
Now we have: Let F ⊆ Hol(Ω, Y ). Then
(1) If F is normal then, for each length function E on Y , and for each compact
subset K of Ω, there is a constant cK > 0 such that
E(df(z)ξ) ≤ cK · kfk for all z ∈ K, ξ ∈ X\{0}, f ∈ F.
(2) If Y is complete and the family F is not compactly divergent and satisfies
(7.1), then F is normal.
This result is standard and can be found in [287] or [275]. Now we treat
the result by cases:
Necessity
Case 1. The family F is compactly divergent. We treat this case in
some detail since it is new and does not appear in [6]. There is a sequence
{fj} ⊆ F that is compactly divergent. Take p0 ∈ Ω and r0 > 0 such that
B (p0, r0) ⊂⊂ Ω. Take pj = p0 for all j ≥ 1 and pj > 0 for all j ≥ 1 such that
ρj → 0
+and define
gj (ξ) = fj (pj + ρj ξ), all j ≥ 1 .
Observe that each gj is defined on
Sj =

ξ ∈ X : kξk ≤ Rj =

dist (p0, ∂Ω)
If K ⊆ X is compact and L is a compact subset of Y , then there is an
index j0 ≥ 1 such that p0 + ρjK ⊆ B (p0, r0) for all j ≥ j0. This implies that
gj (K) ⊆ fj
￾
B (p0, r0)

for each j ≥ j0. Since the sequence {fj} is compactly
divergent, there is an index j1 > j0 such that fj
￾
B (p0, r0)

∩ L = ∅ for all
j ≥ j1. Thus gj (K) ∩ L = ∅ for all j ≥ j1. This means that the family {gj} is
compactly divergent.
Case 2. The family F is not compactly divergent. This follows
standard lines, as indicated in [6].
Sufficiency
Case 1. The sequence gj → g with g not a constant function. By
direct estimation, one shows that
lim
j→∞
E (gj (ξ), dgj (ξ)(t)) = E(g(ξ), dg(ξ)(t)) = 0
for ξ, t ∈ X. Hence g
0 ≡ 0 and so g is constant, a clear contradiction.
So the family F cannot be normal.
Case 2. The sequence {gj} is compactly divergent. We may assume
that {fj} ⊆ F and fj → f. For ξ ∈ X we then have
gj (ξ) = fj (pj + ρj ξ) → f (p0) ∈Other Characterizations of Normality 215
since ρj → 0. This implies that the family {gj} is not compactly divergent, a
clear contradiction.
That completes our outline of the proof of Proposition 7.3.1.
Constantin Carathéodory produced a geometric characterization of normal
families that is quite appealing (see [260, p. 68]). It has never been adapted
even to several complex variables. We take the opportunity now to offer an
infinite dimensional version (which certainly specializes down to any finite
number of dimensions).
We begin with a little terminology. Let Ωj be domains in a separable
Banach space X. If some Euclidean ball B(0, r), r > 0, is contained in all
the domains Ωj , then ker {Ωj} is the largest domain containing 0 and so that
every compact subset of ker {Ωj} lies in all but finitely many of the Ωj . We say
that {Ωj} converges to Ω0 ≡ ker {Ωj}, written Ωj → Ω0, if every subsequence
{Ωjk
} of these domains has the property that ker 
Ωkj
	
= Ω0.
Theorem 7.3.3. 2.3 Fix a separable Banach space X. Let {fn} be a sequence
of univalent, holomorphic mappings from the unit ball B ⊂ X to another
separable Banach space Y with the properties that
1. fn(0) = 0;
2. hdfn(0)1, 1i > 0.
[Here 1 is the unit vector (1, 0, 0, . . .).] Set Ωn ≡ fn(B), n = 1, 2, . . .. Then
the fn converge normally in B to a univalent function f if and only if
1. Ω0 = ker {Ωn} is hyperbolic and is not {0}.
2. Ωn → Ω0
3. Ω0 = f(B).
Proof. Sketch of Proof: We first establish that it is impossible for ker {Ωn} =
{0}. Consider the Kobayashi metric ball B = BB(0, 1). Then
fn : B → BB(0, 1)
since of course each fn will be a Kobayashi isometry onto its image. Assume
that fn → f normally (i.e., uniformly on compact sets) in B. Clearly, under
the hypothesis that ker {Ωn} = {0}, there is no  > 0 such that b(0, ) ⊆ Ωn for
n large. Here b denotes a Euclidean ball. Thus BΩn must shrink to a set with
no interior. It follows that the sequence {fn} collapses any compact subset of
B to a set without interior. Thus df ≡ 0 on B hence f is identically constant.
Since f(0) = 0, f ≡ 0 (a clear contradiction).
Now we begin proving the theorem proper. Suppose that fn → f normally
on B with f univalent. Since, by the preceding paragraph, f is not identically
0, we may conclude that Ω0 = ker (Ωn) =6 {0}.
CLAIM : f(B) = Ω0216 Normal Families of Holomorphic Functions
It would follow from this claim that Ω0 =6 X, for if Ω0 = X then f
−1
:
X → B univalently, violating Liouville’s theorem [203, p. 39]. [It would also
contradict the distance-decreasing property of the Kobayashi metric.] Since
every subsequence of {fn} converges to f, it follows that every subsequence
of {Ωn} has kernel Ω0. We write Ωn → Ω0.
SUBCLAIMI : f(B) ⊆ Ω0
For consider any closed metric ball B(0, R) ⊆ f(B). We may restrict at￾tention to any finite-dimensional slice L of this ball, which will of course be
compact. Then fn|L → fL. Thus fn|L∩∂B → f|L∩aB. As a result, for n large,
we apply the argument principle to any curve in L∩∂B to see that each value
in f(B(0, R)) is attained just once by fn for n large. But this just says that
f(B) ⊆ Ω0.
SUBCLAIMI : Ω0 ⊆ f(B)
For consider Ω0 6= {0} and assume Ω0 is hyperbolic. Let Ωn → Ω0. If
b(0, ) ⊆ Ωn for all n large, then
b(0, ) ⊆ BΩn
(0, R) ⊆ Ωn for n large.
So
fn : BB(0, R) → BΩn
(0, R) ⊃ b(0, )
Hence we have a bound from below on the eigenvalues of dfn.
Obversely, we also claim that the eigenvalues of dfn are bounded above. If
not, then there exist (Euclidean) unit vectors ξn such that
dfn (ξn) → ∞
After a rotation and passing to a subsequence, we can assume that the ξn
all point in the direction 1. The result would then be that Ω0 cannot be
hyperbolic, a contradiction.
Thus the {fn} are locally bounded and {fn} forms a normal family, as
required. Thus some subsequence converges to a univalent f such that f(0) =
0. This last follows from the argument principle (see any standard complex
analysis text).
7.4 A Budget of Counterexamples
We interrupt our story to provide some examples that exhibit the limitations
of the theory of normal families in infinitely many variables.A Budget of Counterexamples 217
Example 7.4.1. There is no Montel theorem for holomorphic mappings of
infinitely many variables. Indeed, let B be the open unit ball in the Hilbert
space `2. Define
ϕj ({am}) = p
3/4a1
1 − aj/2

aj − 1/2
1 − aj/2
,
p
3/4aj+1
1 − aj/2
, . . .!
.
Then each ϕj is an automorphism of B.
Now fix an index j. Let K = Kj be the compact set
{(0, 0, . . . , 0, ζ, 0, . . . , 0) : |ζ| ≤ c},
where the non-zero entry is in the j-th position and 1/2 < c < 1 is a constant.
Define the point p ∈ K to be p = (0, 0, . . . , 0, c, 0, . . .), where the non-zero
entry is in the j-th position. Then
sup
K
kϕj − ϕkk ≥ kϕj (p) − ϕk(p)k ≥

 =




2c − 1
2 − c




> 0.
As a result, we see that the sequence {ϕj} can have no convergent subsequence.
It also cannot have a compactly divergent subsequence.
Example 7.4.2. 3.2 There are no taut domains in infinite dimensional space.
First we recall H.H. Wu’s notion of “taut”. Let N be a complex manifold. We
say that N is taut if, for every complex manifold M, the family of holomorphic
mappings from M to N is normal. We now demonstrate that there are no such
manifolds in infinite dimensions.
We begin by studying the ball B in the Hilbert space `2. We let N = B
and M = D, the disk in C (in fact it is easy to see that, when testing tautness,
it always suffices to take M to be the unit disk). Consider the mappings
ϕj (ζ) = 
0, 0, . . . , 0,

Also
dist (image (ϕj ), ∂D) = 5
12
> 0
As a result, the sequence {ϕj} has no convergent subsequence and no com￾pactly divergent subsequence.
Of course the same argument shows that there is no taut domain in Hilbert
space, nor is there any taut Hilbert manifold.218 Normal Families of Holomorphic Functions
It should be noted that the Arzelà-Ascoli theorem will fail for families
of functions (mappings) taking values in an infinite dimensional space. For
example, if X is the separale Hilbert space `2 and fj : X → X is given by
fj ({xj}) = xj , then the fj are equicontinuous and equibounded on bounded
sets, yet no compact set supports a uniformly convergent subsequence. Thus
the preceding examples do not come as a great surprise.
It is worth noting that there are results for weak or weak-* normal fami￾lies that can serve as a good substitute when the regular (or strong) Montel
theorem fails. We explore some of these in Section 7.7.
7.5 Normal Functions
Normal functions were created by Lehto and Virtanen in [164] as a natural
context in which to formulate the Lindelöf principle.
A Stolz angle at ξ ∈ ∂D is of the form
S(ξ) = 
z ∈ D :

arg(1 − ξz)

 < α, |z − ξ| < ρ	
(0 < α <
π
2
, ρ < 2 cos α).
The exact shape is not relevant. The important fact is that all points of S(ξ)
have bounded non-Euclidean distance from the radius [0, ξ].
For ξ on the unit circle D and α > 1, we define a nontangential approach
region at ξ by
Γ(ξ, α) = {z ∈ D : |z − ξ| < α(1 − |z|)} .
Of course, the term “non-tangential” refers to the fact that the boundary
curves of Γ(ξ, α) have a corner at ξ, with angle less than π.
Recall that the Lindelöf principle says this
Theorem 7.5.1. 4.1 (Lindelöf) Let f be a bounded holomorphic function on
the disk D. If f has radial limit ` at a point ξ ∈ ∂D then f has non-tangential
limit ` at ξ, i.e., limΓ(ξ,α)3z→ξ f(z) = `.
Lehto and Virtanen realized that boundedness was too strong a condition,
and not the natural one, to guarantee that Lindelöf’s phenomenon would hold.
They therefore defined the class of normal functions as follows:
Definition 7.5.2. Let f be a holomorphic (meromorphic) function on the
disk D ⊆ C. Suppose that, for any family {ϕj} of conformal self-maps of the
disk it holds that {f ◦ ϕm} is a normal family. Then we say that f is a normal
function.
Clearly a bounded holomorphic function, a meromorphic function that
omits three values, or a univalent holomorphic function (all in one complex
dimension) will be normal according to this definition.Different Topologies of Holomorphic Functions 219
Unfortunately, the original definition given by Lehto and Virtanen is rather
limited. One-connected domains in C
1 have compact automorphism groups;
finitely connected domains in C
1
, of connectivity at least two, have finite
automorphism group. Generic domains in C
n, n ≥ 2, even those that are
topologically trivial, have automorphism group consisting only of the identity
(such domains are called rigid). Thus, for most domains in most dimensions,
there are not enough automorphisms to make a working definition of “normal
function” possible. In [47], Cima and Krantz addressed this issue and devel￾oped a new definition of normal function. We now adapt that definition to the
infinite dimensional case.
Definition 7.5.3. Let X be a Banach space and let Ω be a domain in X. A
holomorphic function f on Ω is said to be normal if
|Df(z; ξ)|
1 + |f(z)|
2
≤ C · F
Ω
K(z; ξ) for all z ∈ Ω, ξ ∈ X
Proposition 7.5.4. Let f be a holomorphic function on a domain Ω in a
Banach space X. The function f is normal if and only if f ◦ ϕ is normal for
each holomorphic ϕ : D → Ω.
Proof. The proof is just the same as that in Section 1 of [47].
Remark 7.5.5. It is a straightforward exercise, using for example Proposi￾tion 7.5.4 (or Marty’s characterization of normality), to see that a holomor￾phic or meromorphic function on the unit ball B in a separable Hilbert space
H is normal if and only if, for every family {ϕα}α∈A of biholomorphic self
maps of B, it holds that {f ◦ ϕα} is a normal family.
Now let B ⊆ X be the unit ball in a separable Banach space X. We define
a holomorphic function f on B to be Bloch if
kDf(z; ξ)k ≤ C · F
Ω
K(p; ξ)
for every z ∈ B and every vector ξ. Then it is routine, following classical
arguments, to verify.
Proposition 7.5.6. If f on B is a Bloch function, then f is normal.
7.6 Different Topologies of Holomorphic Functions
One way to view a “normal families” theorem is that it is a compactness
theorem. But another productive point of view is to think of these types of
results as relating different topologies on spaces of holomorphic functions. We
begin our discussion of this idea by recalling some of the standard topologies,
as well as a few that are more unusual.220 Normal Families of Holomorphic Functions
The Compact-Open Topology. In the language of analysis, this is the topol￾ogy of uniform convergence on compact sets. Certainly in finite-dimensional
complex analysis this is, for many purposes, the most standard topology on
general spaces of holomorphic functions. In infinite dimensions this topology
is often too coarse (just because compact sets are no longer very “fat”).
The Topology of Pointwise Convergence. Here we say that a sequence fj of
functions or mappings converges if fj (x) converges for each x in the common
domain X of the fj .
The Weak Topology for Distributions. Here we think of a space of holo￾morphic functions as a subspace of the space E of testing functions for the
compactly supported distributions. We say that a sequence fj of holomorphic
functions converges if ψ (fj ) converges for each such distribution ψ. Of course
a similar definition can (and should) be formulated for nets.
The Topology of Currents. Let fj be holomorphic functions and consider
the 1-forms ∂fj . Then we may think of these forms as currents lying in the
dual of the space of rectifiable 1-chains; we topologize the ∂fj accordingly.
A holomorphic p-chain on a complex manifold M is a formal, locally finite
T =
XkjAj ,
where the Aj are pairwise distinct pure p-dimensional irreducible analytic
subsets in M and kj > 0 are integers. Here, locally finite means that for every
compact set K ⊂ M there are only finitely many indices j for which K ∩ Aj
is nonempty.
Each holomorphic 1-chain
T =
XkjAj ,
on a complex manifold M determines a current
T =
Xkj [Aj ],
on it; usually one will identify this current with the chain T.
This current is of measure type, is 1-closed and has bidegree (1, 1). Thus,
holomorphic 1-chains can be thought of as belonging to the space D0
2
(Ω) of
currents of dimension 2, dual to D2(Ω) and endowed with the topology of
weak-* convergence.
It was observed by P. Lelong [166] that a pure 1-dimensional analytic
subvariety V of an open set Ω contained in C
n determines a current T on Ω
via integration over the regular points of V . The current T has several special
properties: It is of type (n−1, n−1), positive, d-closed, and locally rectifiable.
For more on this topic see, for example, [44].A Functional Analysis Approach to Normal Families 221
7.7 A Functional Analysis Approach to Normal Families
In the classical setting of the unit disk D ⊆ C, it is straightforward to prove
that
H∞(D) = 
L
1
(D)/H1(D)
∗
(∗)
Thus H∞ is a dual space in a natural way. Properly viewed, the classical Mon￾tel theorem is simply weak-* compactness (i.e., the Banach-Alaoglu theorem)
for this dual space. Using the Cauchy integral formula as usual, one can see
that convergence in the dual norm certainly dominates uniform convergence
on compact subsets of the disk.
Alternatively, one can think of the elements of H∞(D), with D the disk,
as the collection of all operators (by multiplication) on H2
that commute with
multiplication by z. This was Beurling’s point of view. The operator topology
turns out to be equivalent (although this is nontrivial to see) to the weak-*
topology as discussed in the last paragraph, and this in turn is equivalent to
the classical sup-norm topology on H∞.
The classical arguments go through to show that there is still a Beurling
theorem on the unit ball in Hilbert space. It is a purely formal exercise to verify
that (?) still holds on the unit ball in `2, our usual separable Hilbert space.
As a result, one can think of the Montel theorem even in infinite dimensions
either in the operator topology or as an application of the Banach-Alaoglu
theorem to H∞, thought of as a dual space.
Now we would like to present an effective weak-normal family theorem in
this context.
Let Z be a Banach space and let Y = Z
∗ be its dual Banach space. Let
Ω be an open subset of a Banach space X and let O(Ω, Y ) be the set of
all holomorphic mappings from Ω into Y . Then we consider the topology on
O(Ω, Y ) generated by the sub-basic open sets given by
G(K, U) ≡ {f ∈ O(Ω, Y ) | f(K) ⊂ U}
where K is a compact subset of Ω and U is a weak-* open subset of Y . Let
us call this topology the compact-weak-*-open topology.
Theorem 7.7.1. 6.1 Let Ω be a domain in a separable Banach space X.
Let Z be a separable Banach space with a countable Schauder basis4
, and let
4Let V denote a topological vector space over the field F. A Schauder basis is a sequence
{vn} of elements of V such that for every element v ∈ V there exists a unique sequence
{αj} of scalars in F so that
v =
X∞
j=1
αjvj .
The convergence of the infinite sum is implicitly that of the ambient topology, i.e.,222 Normal Families of Holomorphic Functions
Y = Z
∗
. Further, let W be a bounded domain in Y . Then the compact-weak-*-
open topology is a Montel topology. In particular, the family O(Ω, Y ) is normal
with respect to the compact-weak-*-open topology.
Proof. Let {fj : j = 1, 2, . . .} ⊂ O(Ω, W) be given. We would like to show
that there exists a subsequence that converges in the compact-weak-*-open
topology.
Let {ej | j = 1, 2, . . .} be a Schauder basis for Z. For z ∈ Y , we define the
linear functional ψk : Y → C by ψk(z) = z (ek). Now we define
Ψk,j ≡ ψk ◦ fj
Then we see for each k that the sequence {Ψk,j}j
is normal by Theo￾rem 7.2.8. Therefore, we may select subsequences inductively so that
(1) 
Ψ1,σ1(j)
	∞
j=1 is a subsequence of Ψ1,j which converges in the
compact-weak-*-open topology, and
(2) 
fσk+1(j)
	∞
j=1 is a subsequence of 
fσk(j)
	∞
j=1 for every k =
1, 2, . . .
Notice that the diagonal sequence Ψk,σk(k) = ψk ◦ fσk(k)(k = 1, 2, . . .)
converges in the compact-weak-*-open topology. Since the weak-* topology
separate points, we may denote the weak-* limit of the sequence fσk(k)(z) by
f(z) for each z ∈ Ω. Then the map f : Ω → Y is Gateaux holomorphic.5
Since the range of f is bounded, it follows that f is in fact holomorphic.
Thus the proof is complete.
Notice that this theorem works for mappings from the spaces `
p or c0
into the space `∞, for each p with 1 ≤ p < ∞. Therefore this result may be
useful for a characterization of the infinite-dimensional polydisk by its auto￾morphism group in the space c0 of sequences of complex numbers converging
to zero, for instance. On the other hand, not only is this theorem a general￾ization of the weak-normal family theorem in the works of Kim/Krantz and
Byun/Gaussier/Kim; it also provides an easier and shorter proof even in the
case of separable Hilbert spaces. See [130] and [108].

but can be reduced to only weak convergence in a normed vector space (such as a Banach
space).
5Let X and Y be complex Banach spaces and let D be an open subset of X. We use λ
to denote a complex variable. A function h : D → Y is called Gâteaux holomorphic if it is
locally bounded and if for each x ∈ D, y ∈ X, and linear functional l ∈ Y
∗, the function
f(λ) = l(h(x + λy))
is holomorphic at λ = 0. See, for example, [109].Many Approaches to Normal Families 223
We conclude this section with some examples, due to Jisoo Byun [32], that
suggest some of the limitations of normal families in the infinite dimensional
setting. These examples all relate to the failure of convexity.
Let Ω1 and Ω2 be bounded domains in a Banach space X. We point out
that the holomorphic weak-* limit mapping fb: Ω → X of a sequence of holo￾morphic mappings fj : Ω1 → Ω2 may in general show a surprising behavior
in contrast with the finite dimensional cases. In the finite dimensional case,
ˆf (Ω1) should be contained in the closure of Ω2. Here we demonstrate that
weak-* closure is about the best one can do, even with the nicest candidates
such as sequences of biholomorphic mappings from the ball.
Example 7.7.2. Let B be the unit open ball in `
2
. Let {ej | j = 1, 2, . . .} be
the standard orthonormal basis for `
2
. Let fk : B → `

where z = z1e1 + . . .. Notice that none of fk(B) is convex. In fact, the ball
centered at 77
80 e1 with radius 1/100 never meets fk(B), while it is obvious that
the origin and the point e1 are clearly in the norm closure of the union of
fk(B). Moreover, the weak limit fb of the sequence fk is the identity map.
Hence fb(B) = B, which is convex. This shows that the weak limit can gain
in its image more than the norm closure of the union of the images of fk(B).
Example 7.7.3. In general the weak-* limit does not automatically make
the range convex. Consider gk : B → `

7.8 Many Approaches to Normal Families
It is natural to try to relate the infinite-dimensional case to the well-known
case of finite dimensions. In particular, let F be a family of holomorphic func￾tions on a domain Ω in a Banach space X. Is it correct to say that F224 Normal Families of Holomorphic Functions
normal if and only if the restriction of F to any finite-dimensional subspace
is normal? Obversely, if the post-composition of the elements of F with each
finite-dimensional subspace projection operator is normal then can we con￾clude that F is normal? We would like to treat some of these questions here.
Example 7.8.1. Suppose that if F is a family of maps of a domain Ω in a
separable Hilbert space H to itself, and assume that
{πj ◦ f : f ∈ F}
is normal for each πj : H → Hj the projection of H to the one-dimensional
subspace Hj spanned by the unit vector in the j-th direction. Then it does
not necessarily follow that F is a normal family.
To see this, let H = `2, and let fj ({x`}) = xj . Consider each fj as a map
from the unit ball B ⊆ H to itself. Then, for each fixed k, n
(πk ◦ f)
j
o∞
j=1
is a
normal family, yet the family F = {fj}
∞
j=1 is definitely not normal.
Example 7.8.2. Suppose that if F is a family of maps of a domain Ω in a
separable Hilbert space H to itself. Suppose that, for each k, the collection
{f ◦ µk : f ∈ F}
is normal for each µj : C → H the injection of C to H in the j-th variable.
Then it does not necessarily follow that F is a normal family.
For this result, again consider H = `2, and let fj ({x`}) = xj . Consider
each fj as a map from the unit ball B ⊆ H to itself. Then, for each fixed k,
the family {f ◦ µk}f∈F is clearly normal. Yet the entire family F is plainly
not normal—as we discussed in Example 7.2.1. The reader should compare
this example to Proposition 7.2.14, which gives a positive result along these
lines.
One of the main lessons of the classic paper [287] by H.H. Wu is that the
normality or non-normality of a family of mappings depends essentially on
the target space (this is the provenance of the notion of taut manifold). With
this point in mind, we now formulate a counterpoint to Example 7.4.1:
Proposition 7.8.3. Let C =
n
{xj}
∞
j=1 : |xj | ≤ 1/jo
be the Hilbert cube. Let
H = `2 be the canonical separable Hilbert space. Then any family F from a
domain Ω ⊆ H to C will be normal.
Proof. It suffices to prove that the correct formulation of the Arzelà-Ascoli
theorem holds. In particular, we establish this result:
If G = {gα}α∈A is a family of functions from a domain Ω ⊆ H into C which
is (i) equibounded and (ii) equicontinuous, then G has a uniformly convergent
subsequence.
In fact the usual proof of Arzelà-Ascoli, that can be found in any text
(see, for instance, [146, p. 284]), goes through once we establish this basicMany Approaches to Normal Families 225
fact: If gα : Ω → C and x0 ∈ Ω is fixed, then {gα (x0)} has a convergent
subsequence. Of course this simple assertion is the consequence of a standard
diagonalization argument.8
A Montel Theorem for
Holomorphic Functions on Infinite
Dimensional Spaces That Omit
the Values 0 and 1
Preamble: In a plane domain, locally uniform convergence of a sequence of
functions is equivalent to uniform convergence on compact sets. That notion
of convergence defines the compact-open topology τ0, which is natural for the
standard convergence theorems in classical function theory.
The situation in infinite dimensional holomorphy is more complicated.
As the domains of the functions are not locally compact, the topology τ0 is
too weak for many purposes. There is an extensive literature about stronger
topologies on spaces of holomorphic functions with infinite dimensional do￾mains. See, for example, [43], [55], and their bibliographies.
In spite of its deficiencies, the topology τ0 is convenient for extending some
aspects of the theory of normal families to the infinite dimensional setting. For
example, [43, Chapter 17, Theorem 17.1] and [55, Chapter 3, Lemma 3.25] use
that topology to extend Montel’s theorem about locally bounded families of
holomorphic functions.
In this chapter we present the proof by Clifford J. Earle [69] that the set
of holomorphic functions on a connected complex Banach manifold X that
omit the values 0 and 1 is a normal family, and we shall closely follow the
presentation there.

8.1 Schwarz-Pick Systems
A pseudometric space is a generalization of a metric space in which the dis￾tance between two distinct points can be zero. Pseudometric spaces were in￾troduced by Ðurađ Kurepa [149] in 1934. Their particular importance for
numerical analysis has been pointed out by J. Schröder [263]. In the same
DOI: 10.1201/9781032669861-8 226The Kobayashi Pseudometric 227
way as every normed space is a metric space, every seminormed space is a
pseudometric space.
General systems of pseudometrics with the Schwarz-Pick property were
first studied systematically in [110] by Harris, who coined the term Schwarz￾Pick system for them. These systems can be studied on various classes of
complex spaces. We choose to use the class of complex manifolds modeled
on complex Banach spaces of positive, possibly infinite, dimension. All our
manifolds are assumed to be connected Hausdorff spaces.
If X and Y are complex Banach manifolds, we shall denote the set of all
holomorphic maps of X into Y by O(X, Y ).
Definition 8.1.1 (see Harris [110]). A Schwarz-Pick system is a functor,
denoted by X → dX, that assigns to each complex Banach manifold X a
pseudometric dX so that the following conditions hold:
(a) The pseudometric assigned to D is the Poincarè metric
dD (z1, z2) = tanh−1




z1 − z2
1 − z1z2




if z1 ∈ D and z2 ∈ D . (8.1)
(b) If X and Y are complex Banach manifolds then
dY (f (x1), f (x2)) ≤ dX (x1, x2) if x1 ∈ X, x2 ∈ X and f ∈ O(X, Y ).
(8.2)
Remark 8.1.2. Because of conditions (a) and (b), the sets O(D, X) and
O(X, D) provide upper and lower bounds for dX. The upper bound leads
to the definition of the Kobayashi pseudometric.
8.2 The Classical Definition of Kobayashy Pseudometric
In what follows, dD will always be the Poincaré metric (8.1) on the unit disk
D.
Definition 8.2.1. A Schwarz-Pick pseudometric on the complex Banach
manifold X is a pseudometric d such that
d(f(z), f(w)) ≤ dD(z, w) for all z and w in D and f in O(D, X). (8.1)
If X 7→ dX is a Schwarz-Pick system, then dX is obviously a Schwarz-Pick
pseudometric on X for every complex Banach manifold X.228 Spaces That Omit the Values 0 and 1
Definition 8.2.2. The Kobayashi pseudometric KX is the largest Schwarz￾Pick pseudometric on the complex Banach manifold X.
As Kobayashi observed (see for example [136] or [134]), KX is easily de￾scribed in terms of the function δX : X × X → [0, ∞] defined by
δX (x, x0
) = inf {dD(0, z) : x = f(0) and x
0 = f(z) for some f ∈ O(D, X)}
for all x and x
0
in X. (As usual the infimum of the empty set is ∞.)
In fact Definition 8.2.1, the definition of δX, and the triangle inequality
imply that any Schwarz-Pick pseudometric d on X satisfies
d (x, x0
) ≤ inf



Xn
j=1
δX (xj−1, xj )


in X (8.2)
where the infimum is taken over all positive integers n and all (n + 1)-tuples
of points x0, . . . , xn in X such that x0 = x and xn = x
0
. The infimum on the
right side of the inequality (8.2) defines a function on X × X that is obviously
a Schwarz-Pick pseudometric on X, so (8.2) implies that
KX (x, x0
) = inf



Xn
j=1
δX (xj−1, xj )


for all x and x

in X. (8.3)
(The infimum is of course taken over the same set as in (8.2) above.)
Equation (8.3) is Kobayashi’s definition of the pseudometric KX. It follows
readily from (8.3) and the Schwarz-Pick lemma that the functor assigning
the Kobayashi pseudometric KX to each complex Banach manifold X is a
Schwarz-Pick system. A slightly stronger property of this functor will follow
from the arc length description of KX that we shall explain in the remainder
of next section.
8.3 The Infinitesimal Kobayashi Pseudometric and its
Integrated Form
Every complex Banach manifold X has an infinitesimal Kobayashi pseudomet￾ric kX, first introduced (in the finite dimensional case) by Kobayashi in [136].
Since kX is a function on the tangent bundle T(X) of X, we shall briefly
review some properties of tangent bundles.
For the moment let X be a C
1 manifold modeled on a real Banach space
V . For each x in X the tangent space to X at x will be denoted by Tx(X).
The tangent bundle T(X) of X consists of the ordered pairs (x, v) such that
x ∈ X and v ∈ Tx(X) (see [158]).The Integrated Infinitesimal Kobayashi Pseudometric 229
If X is an open set in V with the C
1
structure induced by the inclusion
map, then each Tx(X), x in X, is naturally identified with V , and T(X) =
X × V .
If X and Y are C
1 manifolds and x is a point of X, every C
1 map f : X →
Y induces a linear map f∗(x) from Tx(X) to Tf(x)(Y ) (see [158]). If X and Y
are subregions of Banach spaces V and W and the tangent spaces Tx(X) and
Tf(x)(Y ) are identified with V and W in the natural way, then f∗(x) is the
usual Fréchet derivative of f at x.
The tangent bundle T(X) has a natural C
0 manifold structure modeled
on V × V . A convenient atlas for T(X) consists of the charts T(ϕ) defined by
the formula
T(ϕ)(x, v) = (ϕ(x), ϕ∗(x)v), (x, v) ∈ T(U),
where U is an open set in X, T(U) is the open subset {(x, v) ∈ T(X) : x ∈ U}
of T(X), and ϕ is a chart on X with domain U. The image of T(U) under
T(ϕ) is the open set ϕ(U) × V in V × V .
If X is a complex Banach manifold modeled on a complex Banach space V ,
then each tangent space Tx(X) has a unique complex Banach space structure
such that the map ϕ∗(x) from Tx(X) to V is a C-linear isomorphism whenever
ϕ is a (holomorphic) chart defined in some neighborhood of x. Furthermore,
T(X) has a unique complex Banach manifold structure such that the map
T(ϕ) from T(U) to ϕ(U) × V is biholomorphic for every (holomorphic) chart
ϕ on X with domain U (see [57]).
Now we are ready for Kobayashi’s definition of kX.
Definition 8.3.1. The infinitesimal Kobayashi pseudometric on the complex
Banach manifold X is the function kX on T(X) defined by the formula
kX(x, v) = inf {|z| : x = f(0) and v = f∗(0)z for some f ∈ O(D, X)} (8.1)
Obviously kX(x, v) ≥ 0 and kX(x, cv) = |c|kX(x, v) for all complex num￾bers c. The following Schwarz-Pick property is also an immediate consequence
of the definition (see [253] or Theorem 1.2.6 in [224]).
Proposition 8.3.2. If X and Y are complex Banach manifolds and f ∈
O(X, Y ), then
kY (f(x), f∗(x)v) ≤ kX(x, v) for all (x, v) ∈ T(X)
In particular, if f is biholomorphic, then kY (f(x), f∗(x)v) = kX(x, v).
Corollary 8.3.3. We have that kD(w, z) = |z|
1−|w|
2 for all (w, z) in D × C.
Proof. Definition 8.3.1 and Schwarz’s lemma imply that kD(0, z) = |z| for all
complex numbers z. To prove the formula for kD(w, z), apply Proposition 3.4
with X = Y = D and f(ζ) = (ζ − w)/(1 − ζw¯), ζ in D.230 Spaces That Omit the Values 0 and 1
We shall use the function kX to measure the lengths of piecewise C
1
curves
in X. As usual, if the curve γ : [a, b] → X is differentiable at t in [a, b],
then the symbol γ
0
(t) denotes the tangent vector γ∗(t)1 to X at γ(t). If γ is
piecewise C
1
, it is natural to define the Kobayashi length of γ by integrating
the function kX (γ(t), γ0
(t)) over the parameter interval of γ. That function is
upper semicontinuous when X is either a domain in a complex Banach space
(see [110] or [56]) or a finite dimensional complex manifold (see [254] and [255]
or [224]), but the case of infinite dimensional complex manifolds is harder to
deal with. In [253] Royden evades that difficulty by using the upper Riemann
integral. Venturini [281] gets more refined results by using upper and lower
Lebesgue integrals. We shall follow Royden’s example, as it allows the very
elementary arguments that we shall now present.
The required upper Riemann integrals exist because the function kX is
locally bounded on T(X). To prove this we use special charts on X. By def￾inition, a standard chart at x in X is a biholomorphic map ϕ of an open
neighborhood of x onto the open unit ball of V with ϕ(x) = 0.
Lemma 8.3.4. If ϕ is a standard chart at the point x in X, then
kX(y, v) ≤ 2 kϕ∗(y)vk
for all (y, v) in T(X) such that y is in the domain of ϕ and kϕ(y)k ≤ 1/2.
Proof. If v = 0, the inequality is trivial. If v = 0 6 , we derive it from (8.1) by
setting
f(z) = ϕ
−1

ϕ(y) + z
ϕ∗(y)v
2 kϕ∗(y)vk

, z ∈ D,
so that f ∈ O(D, X), f(0) = y, and f∗(0)c =
c
2kϕ∗(y)vk
v for all c in C.
Corollary 8.3.5. The function kX is locally bounded in T(X).
Proof. Let U be the domain of the standard chart ϕ in Lemma 8.3.4. Since
holomorphic maps are C
1
, the function (y, v) 7→ 2 kϕ∗(y)vk is locally bounded
in the open set T(U) = {(y, v) ∈ T(X) : y ∈ U}.
Following Royden [253], we can now define the arc length LX(γ) of a
piecewise C
1
curve γ : [a, b] → X in X to be the upper Riemann integral
LX(γ) = Z b
a
kX (γ(t), γ0
(t)) d t (8.2)
and the distance ρX(x, y) to be the infimum of the lengths of all piecewise
C
1
curves joining x to y in X. The resulting pseudometric ρX on X is the
integrated form of the Kobayashi infinitesimal pseudometric kX. By Proposi￾tion 8.3.2,
ρY (f (x1), f (x2)) ≤ ρX (x1, x2) for all x1 and x2 in X (8.3)
whenever f ∈ O(X, Y ). In fact even more is true. If f ∈ O(X, Y ) and γ is a
piecewise C
1
curve in X, then LY (f ◦ γ) ≤ LX(γ).A Montel Theorem 231
Remark 8.3.6. The upper Riemann integral of an upper semicontinuous func￾tion equals its Lebesgue integral, so we can use a Lebesgue integral in (8.2) if
X is finite dimensional or a region in a complex Banach space, but that is an
unnecessary luxury.
Remark 8.3.7. By Corollary 8.3.3, ρD is the Poincaré metric dD on D. There￾fore, by (8.3), the functor that assigns ρX to each complex Banach manifold
X is a Schwarz-Pick system. In particular ρX is a Schwarz-Pick pseudometric
on X, so ρX(x, y) ≤ KX(x, y) for all x and y in X. In the next subsection we
shall use methods of Harris [110] to prove that the pseudometrics ρX and KX
are in fact equal.
8.4 A Montel Theorem
In a plane domain, locally uniform convergence of a sequence of functions is
equivalent to uniform convergence on compact sets. That notion of conver￾gence defines the compact-open topology τ0, which is natural for the standard
convergence theorems in classical function theory.
The situation in infinite dimensional holomorphy is more complicated.
As the domains of the functions are not locally compact, the topology τ0 is
too weak for many purposes. There is an extensive literature about stronger
topologies on spaces of holomorphic functions with infinite dimensional do￾mains. See, for example, [43, 55], and their bibliographies.
In spite of its deficiencies, the topology τ0 is convenient for extending some
aspects of the theory of normal families to the infinite dimensional setting. For
example, [43, 2, Chapter 17, Theorem 17.1] and [55, 4, Chapter 3, Lemma 3.25]
use that topology to extend Montel’s theorem about locally bounded families
of holomorphic functions.
The following proposition is a special case of the cited lemma in [55]. We
shall use it in the proof of Theorem 8.4.2 below.
Proposition 8.4.1. If U is an open subset of a complex Banach space, the
set B of holomorphic functions f on U such that |f(x)| ≤ 1 for all x in U is
compact with respect to the compact-open topology τ0 and the topology τp of
pointwise convergence, and these topologies coincide on B.
Here, τp is the topology induced by identifying B with a subset of the
product space CbU , where Cb is the Riemann sphere, and τ0 can be thought of
as the topology of uniform convergence on compact sets with respect to the
chordal metric on Cb.
Proposition 8.4.1 is our model for the following theorem, which extends
Montel’s theorem about holomorphic functions that omit the values 0 and
1. We shall denote the set of such functions on a complex manifold X by
O(X, Cb\{0, 1}).232 Spaces That Omit the Values 0 and 1
Theorem 8.4.2. Let X be a connected complex Banach manifold, and let F
be the union of O(X, C\{0, 1}) and the set of constant maps from X to C.
Then F is compact with respect to τp and τ0, and these topologies coincide on
F.
The proof of Theorem 8.4.2 rely on Proposition 8.4.1, the classical Montel
theorem, and general contraction properties of holomorphic mappings.
Theorem 8.4.2 is a corollary of the following two lemmas. The proof of the
first will use Proposition 8.4.1. We shall denote the open unit disk in C by D.
Lemma 8.4.3. The set F is closed in the product space C
X.
Proof. Suppose the net (fα) in F converges to f in C
X. We must show that
f ∈ F. Choose x0 in X. We may assume that X contains the open unit ball
B in the model Banach space E and that x0 is the point 0 in B. It will be
convenient to set Ω := Cb\{0, 1, ∞}.
First, suppose f(0) ∈ Cb\Ω. Let u in E be a unit vector. For each α, set
gα(z) := fα(zu), z in D. As fα → f, the function g(z) := f(zu) is the pointwise
limit of the net (gα). By the classical Montel theorem, the convergence is
locally uniform (with respect to the chordal metric) on some subnet (gαi
),
and the limit function g is constant in D because g(0) = f(0) = 0, 1 or ∞.
Therefore f(zu) = f(0) for all z in D. By varying u, we obtain f(x) = f(0)
for all x in B. Now suppose f(0) ∈ Ω. Since fα(0) → f(0), we may assume
that fα(0) ∈ Ω for all α. As fα ∈ F, fα(X) ⊂ Ω for all α. Let π : D → Ω
be a holomorphic covering map such that π(0) = f(0). Choose holomorphic
functions gα : B → D so that fα = π ◦ gα in B and gα(0) → 0.
By Proposition 8.4.1, some subnet gαi
converges uniformly on compact
subsets of B to a holomorphic function g. As g(0) = 0 and |g(x)| ≤ 1 for all x
in B, the maximum principle (see [117, Chapter III, Theorem 3.18.3]) implies
that g(B) ⊂ D. Therefore f = π ◦ g and is holomorphic in B.
As the point x0 was arbitrary, f is a holomorphic mapping of X into C. As
X is connected and the inverse images of 0,1, and ∞ are open in X, f ∈ F.
The proof of the next lemma will use some properties of the Kobayashi
metrics ρB and ρΩ of the ball B and domain Ω. These metrics satisfy
ρΩ(h(x), h(y)) ≤ ρB(x, y) (8.1)
if x ∈ B, y ∈ B, and h : B → Ω is holomorphic. In addition
ρB(0, x) = arctanh kxk for all x in B. (8.2)
Also, the Kobayashi metric ρD of the open unit disk D is the Poincaré metric,
scaled so that ρD(0, z) = arctanh |z| for all z in D, and ρΩ is the quotient
metric on Ω induced by the holomorphic covering map π : D → Ω, by [56,
Chapter 5, Lemma 5.7]. All closed ρΩ-bounded sets are compact, as any such
set is contained in π({z ∈ D : |z| ≤ r}) for some r < 1.A Montel Theorem 233
Lemma 8.4.4. The map P(f, x) = f(x) from F ×X to C is continuous when
F is given the topology τp of pointwise convergence.
Proof. Let (fα, xα) → (f, x) in F × X. Let U be a non-trivial closed disk in
C, centered at f(x), such that U\{f(x)} is contained in Ω. We may assume
that fα(x) ∈ U for all α. We shall also assume that X contains the open unit
ball B, that x is the point 0 in B, and that xα ∈ B for all α.
Suppose P(f, 0) = f(0) = 0, 1, or ∞. As fα(0) ∈ U, either fα(0) = f(0) or
fα(0) ∈ Ω. In the first case, fα (xα) = f(0). In the second case, fα(X) ⊂ Ω,
so fα maps B into Ω. Therefore
ρΩ (fα (xα), fα(0)) ≤ ρB (xα, 0) = arctanh kxαk → 0
so ρΩ (fα (xα), ζ) → ∞ for any given point ζ of Ω. Hence fα (xα) approaches
f(0) along with fα(0). This proves the continuity of P at any point where
P(f, x) ∈/ Ω. If P(f, 0) = f(0) ∈ Ω, then U ⊂ Ω, so fα(0) ∈ Ω for all α, and
fα maps B into Ω. By (8.1) and (8.2),
ρΩ (P (fα, xα), P(f, 0)) = ρΩ (fα (xα), f(0))
≤ ρΩ (fα (xα), fα(0)) + ρΩ (fα(0), f(0))
≤ ρB (xα, 0) + ρΩ (fα(0), f(0)) → 0,
so P is also continuous at all points of P
−1
(Ω).
Proof of the theorem.. As the product space C
X is compact, Lemma 8.4.3
implies that F is compact with respect to the topology τp. The compact-open
topology τ0 is always stronger than τp. Conversely, by Kelley [126, Chapter 7,
Theorem 5], Lemma 8.4.4 implies that τp is stronger than τ0 on F.9
Concluding Remarks
The theory of normal families has been an important tool in complex function
theory for well over 100 years. More recently the theory of normal functions
has assumed a significant role. The two theories interact productively.
The purpose of this book has been to explain these two sets of ideas, both
in the classical one-variable setting and also in the context of several complex
variables and Banach spaces. In addition, we treat normal families and normal
function on complex spaces and manifolds.
We hope that this is a new and useful contribution to the literature, and
we look forward to feedback from our readers.
