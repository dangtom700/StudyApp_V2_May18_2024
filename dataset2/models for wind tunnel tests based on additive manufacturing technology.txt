The design and fabrication of wind tunnel test models has a significant impact on 
the quality and efficiency of aircraft development. Due to the limitation of tradi￾tional processing methods, it is difficult to design and process models that must meet 
similar criteria of geometry, stiffness, mass, and dynamics, making it difficult for 
designers to evaluate the effects of aircraft structural parameters on aerodynamic 
characteristics in the early stages of aircraft development. Based on additive manu￾facturing technology (3D printing), new methods for designing and manufacturing 
wind tunnel test models have been developed significantly. The ability of additive 
manufacturing technology to print complex internal and external structures in an 
integrated manner can reduce the process constraints of manufacturing on design, 
increase the design freedom of wind tunnel test models, significantly reduce the 
number of parts of existing models, significantly increase the geometric similarity 
of shapes, and improve the model processing economy, which is more conducive 
to the development of new models with better similarity. This book introduces the 
common fundamentals of additive manufacturing technology based on wind tunnel 
test models, including design fundamentals, process fundamentals, inspection tech￾nology, and reinforcement technology. On this basis, the book introduces in detail 
the design and manufacturing technology of wind tunnel test models based on addi￾tive manufacturing with five types of wind tunnel test models, including conventional 
force measurement model, conventional pressure measurement model, elastic model, 
fluttering model, and deformation similar force measurement model and verifies the 
effectiveness of the new method by means of simulation calibration, ground test, and 
wind tunnel test.

Overview of Wind Tunnel Test Models 
1.1 Wind Tunnel Tests and Wind Tunnel Test Models 
1.1.1 Aircraft Development and Wind Tunnel Tests 
Aircraft development is a complex system engineering, including conceptual design, 
detailed design and trial production and qualification stages, of which conceptual 
design largely determines the performance of the aircraft and is the most important 
stage in aircraft development. It is the most important stage of aircraft development. 
In the conceptual design phase, the aircraft design includes aerodynamic design 
and structural design. The main task of aerodynamic design is to determine the 
aerodynamic shape parameters to minimize drag while ensuring sufficient lift, while 
the task of structural design is to select the structural layout form and determine the 
size of structural components to make the structure lightest in weight while ensuring 
structural integrity. In industrial practice, the relevant design work is carried out by the 
aerodynamic design department and the structural design department respectively. 
The main means of aircraft development include simulation modeling 
(Modeling & Simulation), ground testing (Ground Testing) and flight testing (Flight 
Testing). As shown in Fig. 1.1 shows, according to the general process of aircraft 
design, flight testing is the closest to the real situation of the aircraft, and the data 
obtained have high credibility, but it can only be carried out at the later stage of 
aircraft design, after the prototype has been designed and manufactured, which has 
high cycle time and cost, and also has greater safety and other risks; with the improve￾ment of computer computing power and the development of computing methods, 
CFD computing technology, MDO computing technology, etc. With the improve￾ment of computer computing power and the development of calculation methods, 
CFD calculation technology, MDO calculation technology, etc. are expanding the 
range of problems that can be solved, and modeling simulation technology is increas￾ingly used in the aircraft design process, but the reliability of the calculation is still

Fig. 1.1 The role of wind tunnel tests in aircraft development 
waiting for test verification, and the accurate calculation of complex problems still 
requires a long calculation cycle and cost; ground test technology, mainly wind 
tunnel test, has a long history in the application of aircraft design, and has compar￾ative advantages in terms of reliability and economy. Along with the development 
of modeling and simulation technology, the advancement of ground and flight test 
technology, and the improvement of data testing capability, the three technologies 
tend to converge in order to meet the new challenges in aircraft design [1]. Wind 
tunnel test data is the main basis of aircraft shape, strength and structure design and 
performance calculation, which is irreplaceable [1]. It is irreplaceable. 
Wind tunnel tests are essential for aircraft aerodynamics and cross research fields 
with other disciplines, and their main roles include: (1) verifying the correctness 
of theoretical analysis and calculation in aerodynamics; (2) providing reliable aero￾dynamic data for the development of aircraft, missiles, rockets and other vehicles. 
The flight test uses real aircraft actually operating in a real environment, and the 
data obtained are the most reliable, essential for checking aircraft performance and 
testing flight envelopes in the late design stage, but there are test conditions that 
are difficult to control and change, unfavorable to the adjustment and measurement 
of test parameters, and the data obtained are scattered and difficult to be used to 
establish the intrinsic laws of physical phenomena. With the rapid development of 
computational fluid dynamics and the increasing capability of computer solutions, 
numerical computation can replace part of the wind tunnel test program and can 
provide aerodynamic data more rapidly and economically [2]. However, computa￾tional fluid dynamics is based on theoretical analysis and experimental hydrody￾namics, which can solve the problem of clear physical mechanisms and sufficient 
experimental data, while its reliability is very challenging for the complex air flow1.1 Wind Tunnel Tests and Wind Tunnel Test Models 3
phenomena frequently encountered in the development of advanced aircraft. There￾fore, wind tunnel testing is still a means to balance reliability, safety and economy, 
and is widely used in aircraft type development and design research, finalization and 
modification, etc. It also keeps advancing the development of computational fluid 
dynamics. 
1.1.2 Wind Tunnel Test Models 
The wind tunnel test model is the test object of the wind tunnel test, and the phys￾ical model is designed and produced according to the similar theory, which is the 
substitute of the tested aircraft in the wind tunnel. There are various classifications 
of wind tunnel test models depending on the type of data acquired, similarity, model 
structure, test speed, etc., such as Table 1.1 shows. 
The quality of the model design has an important impact on the reliability of 
the data and the safety of the wind tunnel tests. As shown in Fig. 1.2, the main 
requirements of model design include similarity requirements, testing requirements, 
strength requirements, and processability requirements. The similarity requirement 
refers to the similarity in the wind tunnel. The similarity requirement refers to the 
similarity between the model blowing in the wind tunnel and the aircraft flying in the 
atmosphere, including both object similarity and flow field similarity. The similarity 
of the flow field is determined by the blowing parameters of the wind tunnel and 
the aerodynamic shape of the model, while the similarity of the object means that 
the model design needs to meet similar conditions, including geometric similarity 
(similar shape), mass similarity, stiffness similarity, etc. as mentioned above.
The wind tunnel test model is based on the original aircraft (prototype) and 
designed according to the similarity principle. The common model similarity require￾ments include geometric similarity, stiffness similarity, mass similarity, and dynamic 
similarity. Geometric similarity means that the shape of the model is consistent with 
the prototype (after scaling, the same below) to ensure the similarity of winding, 
which is the basic criterion to be satisfied by all models; stiffness similarity requires 
that the structure of the model has the same stiffness distribution as the prototype,

which is required to be simulated for static elastic models, etc.; mass similarity 
requires that the model has the same mass distribution as the prototype, which is 
required to be satisfied for tailspin free-flying models, etc. Dynamic similarity is a 
requirement for the dynamic characteristics of the model, and models suitable for 
this criterion include fluttering models, buffeting models, etc. Structural similarity is 
a requirement for the similarity of the force transfer structure and path of the model, 
which is important for the accurate prediction of the effect of fluid–solid coupling. 
1) Deficiencies in the similarity of traditional wind tunnel test models 
(1) Inaccuracy of geometrically similar simulations 
In order to solve the cost, for the aircraft shape of the detail features, generally 
do simplification, such as bulging; for the more complex parts of the structure, 
such as the fighter jet hanging bomb, often through the parts processing—overall 
assembly to achieve the way, which the integrity of the pneumatic shape will cause 
a certain impact. Detail simplification and assembly errors are problematic for the 
effectiveness of accurate aircraft design. Geometric scaling factor should be reason￾ably designed, generally requiring the model size to be as large as possible to increase 
the test Reynolds number, but in order to control the influence of cavity wall interfer￾ence, the maximum size of the model (maximum cross-sectional area, overall length 
and wingspan length) should be kept within the specified range (depending on the 
type of test, wind tunnel size); at the same time, the surface roughness of the model 
should also meet the specified requirements; 
(2) Inadequacy of structural parameter simulation 
The structural parameters of the model are determined by similar stiffness, similar 
mass, similar dynamics and similar structure. As mentioned above, in the traditional 
wind tunnel test subjects, the introduction of such model tests is relatively late and1.1 Wind Tunnel Tests and Wind Tunnel Test Models 5
rarely carried out, mostly “verification” tests (feasible or not), which is far from 
meeting the requirements for optimal design of structural parameters, and there is 
no way to carry out multidisciplinary optimization by means of tests. The similarity 
constraint of the existing vehicle scaled-down wind tunnel test model design is as 
follows: 
a) Similar stiffness 
Because of the complexity of the internal structure of the prototype aircraft and the 
reduced size of the model, it is more difficult to fully simulate the stiffness. The 
forms of model structures usually used are single/double beam-dimensional frame 
structure, beam frame structure, simplified similar structure, etc. 
b) Similar quality 
Mass similarity is usually achieved by using the structure mass-counterweight mass 
approach. For low-speed models, the structural mass is small and has a large coun￾terweight adjustment space, so the mass similarity is easy to achieve; while for 
high-speed models, the structural mass itself is large in order to ensure sufficient 
strength and stiffness, and there is often an overweight problem, so the simulation 
of structural similarity is a difficult problem. 
c) Similar power 
The dynamic similarity has requirements for the stiffness distribution and mass distri￾bution of the model, and involves more constraints; therefore, the accurate dynamic 
similarity design is more complicated, especially for the integral wing and full aircraft 
dynamic similarity models, which are very difficult to design and manufacture. 
d) Similar structure 
Structural similarity is a requirement for similarity of the model force transfer struc￾ture and path, which is important for accurate prediction of the effects of fluid–solid 
coupling effects. Theoretically, the model should have the same internal structure as 
the aircraft to accurately simulate the force transfer path. Theoretically, the model 
should have the same internal structure as the aircraft to accurately simulate the force 
transfer paths so that both have the same structural parameter properties. However, 
the complexity of the aircraft structure and the scaled-down nature of the model make 
this economically unacceptable for conventional machining methods. 
1.1.3 Design and Manufacturing Techniques for Existing 
Models 
The main factor that causes the lack of similarity of the traditional models mentioned 
above is the model design and manufacturing technology—the wind tunnel test model 
implementation technology. The realization of the wind tunnel test model refers to the6 1 Overview of Wind Tunnel Test Models

Fig. 1.3 Design and manufacturing process of wind tunnel test model 
process of changing the model from demand to product, which specifically includes 
two parts: model design and model manufacturing. As shown in Fig. 1.3 the input 
of model realization is the model design requirement in the wind tunnel test task 
sheet, and the output is the model wind tunnel test. The broad model realization 
also includes modeling simulation, calibration calculation, calibration experiment 
and other links. 
1) Product features of wind tunnel test model 
Models are a special class of industrial products that have the following characteristics 
from the point of view of realization: 
(1) Complexity of design constraints 
As shown in Fig. 1.2, the design of the wind tunnel test model needs to meet simi￾larity requirements, testing requirements, strength requirements and processability 
requirements, etc. There are many design constraints, and some requirements are 
contradictory to each other. For example, the static elastic model requires the model 
to have a certain stiffness distribution, but it is often difficult to meet the strength 
requirements for a model with similar stiffness when blowing wind at high speed; 
for the design of a dynamically similar model, the design with similar stiffness often 
brings overweight of mass. 
(2) Single-piece form of production 
During the development of an aircraft type, dozens of sets of models are designed 
and produced. Since the test purpose of each model set is different, the size and 
structure of the model are also different. Therefore, the processing of models is all 
single-piece processing, and the design and processing of special tooling for each 
set of models is costly and time-consuming.1.1 Wind Tunnel Tests and Wind Tunnel Test Models 7
(3) High punctuality of processing 
Both military and civilian aircraft model development follow strict time node control, 
and all stages of model development must be completed within the specified time, 
so all aspects of model design, production and testing must be on time. Due to the 
multiple constraints of model design and single-piece model processing, it is neces￾sary to go through complicated steps from the beginning of design to the completion 
of processing. Any mistake in the process will lead to the delay of model delivery 
and the postponement of wind tunnel test, which is unacceptable to both the model 
design units pursuing nodes and the test implementation units with compact test 
arrangements. 
2) Model Design 
The model design process includes the following aspects: 
(1) Overall solution design 
According to the model design requirements proposed in the wind tunnel test outline, 
the overall plan of model design is prepared, including the model size scaling factor, 
shape simulation requirements, model structure form, strength check conditions, 
material selection, processing accuracy requirements, support form and the size of 
scales and struts used, etc. This is the key step of model design. 
(2) Structural Design 
According to the proposed overall plan of the model, the detailed structure of the 
model is designed, and a full set of drawings of the model including general drawings, 
component drawings and parts drawings are drawn for processing. 
(3) Strength calibration 
The maximum aerodynamic loads are estimated based on the test conditions (Mach 
number, attitude angle, etc.) and the wind tunnel aerodynamic parameters of the 
model and its main components, and the strength of the model and the dangerous 
parts of its support rods are verified. Based on the strength check of the model, some 
adjustments are made to the structure and connections of the model and the materials 
used until the strength requirements are met. 
3) Model processing 
The materials often used in wind tunnel test models include metal (high performance 
steel and aluminum alloy), wood, glass fiber composite materials, etc., among which 
metal models are the main ones. The mechanical processing methods of metal models 
include wire cutting, EDM, CNC lathe, CNC milling machine, coordinate boring 
machine and other precision processing equipment. Tooling preparation is a neces￾sary step for machining. It is an essential and complicated work for wind tunnel test 
model which has internal and external structure and high processing accuracy require￾ment. Aircraft fuselage and missile fuselage are generally made of ordinary steel or8 1 Overview of Wind Tunnel Test Models
aluminum alloy; airfoil, model struts and balance are usually made of high quality 
high-strength alloy steel. At present, most of the metal models use CNC machining 
to manufacture the model components and leave a certain amount of post-processing 
machining allowance, and the whole assembly is manually customized and ground 
after completion. At the present stage of wind tunnel test model manufacturing, 
there is still a large part of the work to be completed manually, such as the flow line 
processing of the wind tunnel test model. The assembled model needs to be tested 
for accuracy of shape and surface quality before wind tunnel testing. 
4) Features of existing implementation methods 
The existing method has been developed for a long time and has a long technical 
accumulation. The design method and process, material selection, process prepara￾tion, and part processing are mature, and the parts realized by using high-precision 
machining technology have high dimensional accuracy and surface quality, and have 
an irreplaceable position in the realization of ultra-high-precision models (such as 
standard models). However, in view of the development trend of wind tunnel testing 
technology, the existing methods need improvement in the following aspects: 
(1) Similarity design difficulties 
In the premise of meeting the design requirements, the test model should be as light as 
possible, the current wind tunnel test model a large number of metal materials using 
CNC machining made of denser materials, weight reduction structure processing 
difficulties, so it is difficult to achieve model lightweight. For the tail spin free flight 
and other tests, the requirements to meet the quality of similar, its counterweight 
design and processing is more difficult. The internal structure of the aircraft is its 
main load-bearing component, which has an important influence on the structural 
parameters (stiffness distribution, mass distribution) and dynamic characteristics of 
the aircraft. However, the modulus of the model material is larger now, and the 
structural scaling of the model after design (e.g., 0.5 mm after scaling the skin with 
thickness of 10 mm by 1:20) is smaller than the machinable size, therefore, the 
structural similarity of the model cannot be achieved based on the present model 
implementation. 
(2) Long delivery lead time 
The shape and internal structure of the wind tunnel test model are complex, and the 
parts are generally produced in a single piece, with dozens of parts and hundreds 
of parts in 1 set of models. The process personnel have to design the processing 
plan according to the characteristics of each part, which is a great workload and 
time consuming [4]. According to the research, the delivery cycle of 1 set of full 
aircraft model is about 4 months, of which the process preparation takes about 1 
month. There is a tendency to shorten the aircraft development cycle [1]. However, 
there is a limitation to shorten the cycle time of the model implementation, and 
the computational power such as CFD is improving, and the cycle time and cost 
advantages are becoming more and more obvious.1.2 Introduction of Additive Manufacturing Technology 9
(3) Inadequate design approach 
The design method of the present model is based on the mechanical processing 
method and widely uses CAD methods for model design, which is limited by the 
material selection, tooling preparation and other factors, and its design freedom is 
greatly restricted. It cannot take advantage of the latest design methods, such as 
structural optimization for weight reduction design, nor does it support well the inte￾gration with aircraft design methods, such as computational fluid dynamics (CFD) 
and multidisciplinary design for optimization (MDO), which does not coincide with 
the trend of wind tunnel test technology [1]. 
These shortcomings have hindered the development of new aircraft and prolonged 
the development cycle of aircraft. As the complexity of the model increases, the cycle 
time and cost of machining increases rapidly [5, 6]. The model’s manufacturing cycle 
time or failure will delay the wind tunnel test. The extended manufacturing cycle or 
failure of the wind tunnel test model will delay the wind tunnel test time and make 
the scheduling of the wind tunnel test very difficult. This current situation requires 
the exploration of new manufacturing methods for wind tunnel test models. 
1.2 Introduction of Additive Manufacturing Technology 
WorldwideDomestic and foreign aerospace-related sectors are seeking a new manu￾facturing technology in order to reduce the time and cost of wind tunnel test model 
manufacturing [7, 8]. The main direction is the application of 3D Printing (or Addi￾tive Manufacturing-AM, or Rapid Prototyping-RP) technology in the manufacture of 
wind tunnel test models [9–12]. The main direction is the application of 3D Printing, 
or Additive Manufacturing-AM, or Rapid Prototyping-RP, technology to wind tunnel 
test models. 
1.2.1 Introduction of Additive Manufacturing Technology 
3D printing is a new manufacturing technology, different from the traditional mechan￾ical processing “remove material” way, is a “add material” processing technology, is 
widely believed to have the potential to trigger a revolution in manufacturing [13]. 
The U.S. government has developed plans to use it as a core technology to revitalize 
U.S. manufacturing [14]. The U.S. government has developed plans to use this as a 
core technology to revitalize U.S. manufacturing. 
3D printing technology is a processing technology that combines precision 
mechanics, material science, laser technology and CNC technology, and is known as 
a revolution in the field of manufacturing [15]. It is a manufacturing technology that 
uses the principle of material accumulation to make three-dimensional solids directly 
from virtual data. It is a manufacturing technology that uses the printing principle of10 1 Overview of Wind Tunnel Test Models

material accumulation to make 3D entities directly from virtual data. Depending on 
the process, it can be divided into light curing process (Stereolithography, SL), fused 
deposition process (Fused Deposition Manufacturing, FDM), stacked manufacturing 
process (LOM), powder sintering process (SLS). 
As shown in Fig. 1.4, the characteristics of 3D printing technology mainly lie in 
(1) rapidity: converting virtual parts (completed by CAD) into machining data (STL 
format, which can be converted automatically) and directly driving the equipment to 
produce solid parts, which can realize rapid manufacturing of products and is suitable 
for fields with strict requirements on product cycle time. (2) Highly flexible: elimi￾nating the need for tooling preparation, the equipment can complete the processing 
and manufacturing of different types of parts without any changes or adjustments, 
which is suitable for new product development or single-piece small batch produc￾tion. (3) Irrelevance to complexity: the manufacturing cycle and manufacturing cost 
of parts are not related to the shape and complexity of parts, but only to their net 
volume, which is suitable for the processing of products with internal and external 
complex structures. As shown, 3D printing technology greatly reduces the conver￾sion distance from virtual parts to physical parts due to the elimination of tooling 
preparation, reaching a new level of seamless virtual-physical connection. 
1.2.2 Application of Additive Manufacturing Technology 
in Wind Tunnel Test Models 
A. Springer’s team at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center [5, 12, 16] investigated 
the feasibility of four 3D printed models made of different materials for use in a 
high-speed wind tunnel test model. In the comparison study, the aluminum model 
was used as the baseline for comparison, and the processes used for 3D printing were: 
fused deposition method (FDM); light-curing method (SL); laser-selected sintering 
method (SLS); and laminated layer method (LOM). A launch vehicle with a tail fin1.2 Introduction of Additive Manufacturing Technology 11
was used as the object of study, and the model was divided into two sections with 
a force balance installed inside, and the test Mach number ranged from 0.3 to 5. 
The tests showed that the SL model obtained satisfactory results under most test 
conditions; compared with the current design and manufacturing of metal models, 
the four 3D printed models reflected the characteristics of low cost and short design 
and manufacturing time. The use of 3D printing technology to fabricate wind tunnel 
test models can be used for early subsonic, sonic, and supersonic wind tunnel tests, 
especially the SL and FDM based low-speed rigid model fabrication technology has 
high accuracy, short cycle time, and low cost. 
U.S. Air Force WPAFB Research Laboratory and Northrop Grumman Integrated 
Systems Research Group [17] used the 3D printing process to manufacture a fully 
resin-based rigid model of the Early Warning Aircraft (E-8C). Using the flexibility of 
3D printing technology, the research team manufactured series models with/without 
radar fairing, with/without rudder deflection, and with/without slight winglet, while 
the good accuracy of the technology ensured the comparability between the series 
models. The study shows that the use of 3D printing technology to manufacture wind 
tunnel test models can improve the efficiency of wind tunnel experiments. 
Boeing Corporation, USA [18] has identified rapid prototyping as one of two 
revolutionary technologies (the other being parametric CAD) to improve the effi￾ciency and reduce the cost of wind tunnel testing. The lab has used metal SLS, Metal 
Coated Plastic, and Direct Metal Fusion to produce wind tunnel test models, and has 
shown that this process can reduce the cost of manufacturing models by an order of 
magnitude and triple the cycle time instead of traditional machining methods (NC 
programming, machining, hand grinding, etc.). The results show that this process 
can reduce the cost of manufacturing models by an order of magnitude and shorten 
the cycle time by three times, freeing designers from tedious model processing and 
even changing the way they work in the laboratory. 
Jonathan D. Bartley-Cho et al. of Northrop Grumman, USA [19] used SL (Stereo￾lithography system, SLS) to print the stage shell of a wing model and assembled it 
with a metal Al beam to form a dynamic aeroelastic model with a single beam￾dimensional segmental structure to study the sudden wind mitigation performance 
(Gust Load Alleviation, GLA) of the wing structure, and obtained the expected 
results. The model is complex, but the main load-bearing element is an aluminum 
beam to simulate the stiffness; the aerodynamic shape is ensured by SL-printed 
segments, each segment is attached to the aluminum beam at a single point, and 
the gap between the segments is filled by foam; the mass similarity is achieved by 
installing lead blocks on the stage. Before the wind tunnel experiments, the team 
conducted a simulation check of the whole model, and the results showed that the 
static aeroelastic properties (static deformation) and flutter characteristics (flutter 
frequency and flutter speed) all meet the requirements.12 1 Overview of Wind Tunnel Test Models
G. Romeo of Politico Ditorino (Italy), P. Marzocca of Clarkson University (USA) 
and Illhan Tuzcu of University of Alabama (USA), among others, have used the SL 
process to fabricate a large span-to-skin ratio elastic wing shell for low-speed flutter 
experiments [20]. The SL shell is divided into 7 pieces with a small gap between them 
to reduce the additional stiffness of the shell, which guarantees a good aerodynamic 
profile accuracy. 
In addition to this, (1) the U.S. Air Force WPAFB Research Laboratory and Johns 
Hopkins University’s Applied Physics Laboratory [21, 22] (JHU/APL) collaborated 
to study the application of SL technology to wind tunnel pressurization model fabri￾cation. The team designed, analyzed, and machined a low-cost LAMBD wing-body￾bond wind tunnel pressurization model using the SL7000 former, and evaluated it 
with better experimental results. (2) NASA Langley Research Center [23] fabricated 
a wind tunnel test model of hypersonic aerospace spacecraft by 3D printing-based 
precision casting technology. They use light-curing 3D printing technology (SL) to 
manufacture monolithic small-size aerospace wind tunnel test models, which can 
reduce the weight of the model and improve the design speed and reduce costs. 
(3) The U.S. Air Force WPAFB Research Laboratory and Dayton University have 
jointly conducted research work on additive manufacturing technology for wind 
tunnel test models [24, 25]. The group successfully fabricated two wind tunnel test 
models by 3D printing technologies (SL and SLS): using low-cost 3D printing tech￾nology to process the outer surface of the model and regular metal parts for the 
internal strength support parts; the twisting and deformation of the wing should be 
minimized; the pressure measurement holes and pressure transfer pipes can be effec￾tively processed and electronic or mechanical pressure scanning valves and sensors 
can be installed relatively easily; the support and the model should be able to detect 
the head angle accuracy and precision under loading. (4) Heyes et al. of Imperial 
University London, UK [7] discussed methods and techniques for manufacturing 
wind tunnel test models with complex internal structures using fused filament depo￾sition manufacturing (FDM) and light-cured 3D printing (SL). It was found that the 
light-curing 3D printing technology not only shortens the model fabrication cycle 
and reduces the cost, but also enables the rapid fabrication of pressure measure￾ment flow paths and models with complex internal structures while ensuring the 
requirements of stiffness and strength. (5) D. B. Landrum et al.of Alabama Univer￾sity (USA) [26] specifically investigated the feasibility of light-curing forming in 
the fabrication of aerospace wing models. The group fabricated two wing models 
for evaluation, using polyurethane through a common casting technique and resin 
light-curing molding and sanding the surface with water-based sandpaper. The team 
concluded that the light-curing 3D printing technology provides better aerodynamic 
surface accuracy. (6) The Central Aerodynamic Research Institute of Russia and the 
Russian Academy of Sciences collaborated on the application of light-curing forming 
and its composite manufacturing technology in the design and manufacture of fighter 
models [27]. They studied the feasibility of using light-curing 3D printing to manu￾facture higher precision wind tunnel test models. The preliminary study proved that 
among the 3D printing methods, light-curing 3D printing is the most effective means 
of manufacturing aerodynamic models, which can produce individual model parts as1.2 Introduction of Additive Manufacturing Technology 13
Fig. 1.5 Compounded AGARD-B force measurement model [29–31] 
well as composite manufacturing of combined parts and models with high precision. 
(7) The Department of Mechanical Engineering, McGill University, Canada, studied 
the effectiveness and economy of 3D printing technology in the manufacture of wind 
tunnel test models [11]. The study found that 3D printing technology is particularly 
suitable for the fabrication of non-structural load components, and classified the 
fabrication techniques of wind tunnel test model components into three categories: 
non-structural load, light load and high load components. (8) Aghanajafi et al. at 
K. N. Toosi University of Technology, Iran [28] fabricated a low-speed, transonic 
wind tunnel test model using 3D printing technology and compared with a CNC 
machined aluminum alloy model. At the same time, the feasibility of the 3D printing 
manufacturing technology is evaluated to meet the high fidelity shape requirements. 
The design and manufacturing of wind tunnel test models based on light-curing 
3D printing technology has a more mature basis, and some preliminary explorations 
and applications have been carried out [29–31]. As shown in Fig. 1.5, Xi’an Jiaotong 
University, China has made some attempts in the manufacture of force measurement 
model, the design and manufacture of pressure measurement holes and flow channels 
of pressure measurement model, and the manufacture of composite wind tunnel test 
model by electrodeposition, and has also achieved certain research results. However, 
further research work is needed to push the technology to model applications. 
1.2.3 Analysis of the Current Status of the Application 
of Additive Manufacturing Technology 
Light-curing 3D printing (Stereo-Lithography, SL for short) is currently recognized 
as one of the most widely used among the many 3D printing methods [7, 12, 21, 
30, 32–35]. Compared to other 3D printing processes (FDM, LOM, SLS, etc.), 
light-curing 3D printing is currently recognized as the process with the highest 
printing accuracy (0.1 mm for conventional devices and up to 0.05 mm under special 
conditions). possibility. Recent studies have shown that SL, on the other hand,14 1 Overview of Wind Tunnel Test Models
proves to have better application prospects due to its higher processing accuracy 
[12, 15, 32]. Some researchers have also used an embedded metal skeleton to 
strengthen SL components, thus improving the bending resistance of wind tunnel 
test models in high-speed blowing tests [19, 31, 36]. 
Although the 3D printing technology represented by SL has been increasingly 
used, there are still problems to be solved in the implementation of wind tunnel test 
models as follows. The above research has laid the foundation for the establishment 
of new model implementation methods, but in order to give full play to the advantages 
of 3D printing technology and make reasonable use of the strengths of the existing 
model implementation methods, there is a need to continue research in the following 
aspects. 
1) The influence of processing technology on design methods 
Nowadays, most of the research on the implementation of wind tunnel test models 
based on 3D printing technology is limited to the discussion at the level of model 
machining, while the influence of another aspect of model implementation, model 
design, is less studied. As a constraint (machining processability and machining 
economy), the way the part is machined must have an impact on the way the part is 
designed and its efficiency. The removal of tooling preparation and the realization 
of seamless virtual-solid conversion not only shorten the cycle time significantly in 
the sense of machining, but also help to expand the choice of model design tools and 
improve the efficiency of model design by reducing constraints. Thus, the introduc￾tion of 3D printing technology affects both model design and model machining, thus 
having an impact on the overall model realization approach. 
2) Integration with traditional mechanical processing methods 
The advantages of 3D printing technology are the shortening of the conversion cycle 
from virtual parts to solid parts, the rapid processing capability of complex struc￾tures, etc. However, it is not yet able to replace traditional mechanical machining 
methods in the realization of high precision and high strength models. Therefore, the 
respective advantages of 3D printing technology and mechanical machining methods 
can be integrated, and their respective ranges of application can be fully considered 
in the model design, and the corresponding machining methods can be selected for 
different structures of the model, thus providing a new comprehensive solution for 
the realization of wind tunnel test models. In addition, most of the existing studies 
are feasibility studies, and most of the selected objects are simplified wing structures, 
which generally do not include details such as control surfaces and rudder surface 
declination adjustment mechanisms. These are important for the practicalization of 
new manufacturing methods for wind tunnel test models, and need to be studied 
specifically. Therefore, it is necessary to make full use of the respective advantages 
of 3D printing technology and mechanical processing methods for more productized 
prototypes, and expand more detailed technical aspects to establish the foundation 
for the new design of the model and the practicalization of the manufacturing method.1.2 Introduction of Additive Manufacturing Technology 15

Fig. 1.6 SL-based wind tunnel test model implementation method 
Using the mainstream 3D printing technology—SL process, model design and 
model manufacturing as a whole, this book proposes a new design and manufacturing 
method for aircraft wind tunnel test models, and the principle of the method is as 
shown in Fig. 1.6. 
This new model realization method expands the tooling options for model design, 
combines the advantages of traditional mechanical processing methods and SL tech￾nology methods, and utilizes the performance characteristics of polymer materials 
used in the SL process, which can improve the similarity of wind tunnel test models, 
improve the realization efficiency of existing model types, and provide support for 
the development of new aircraft development technologies. 
3) Rethinking the properties of polymers 
As mentioned above, polymer materials are commonly used in current 3D printing 
processing technology. According to the current model design and processing stan￾dards, polymer materials are not included in the recommended catalog. There is 
a view that polymer materials are not suitable for wind tunnel test model manu￾facturing, and the main reasons are the higher damping coefficient, lower elastic 
modulus, lower material strength and poor time stability of polymer materials. If the 
traditional metal model is used as a reference, the polymer model has a natural defi￾ciency and its performance cannot reach the “standard value”. However, if one thinks 
differently, the perception of high-index materials may be different. The low modulus 
of polymer provides a possibility to solve the structural similarity that is difficult to 
achieve with existing metallic materials; the higher damping coefficient helps to 
improve the stability of rigid models, and for dynamic models, the high damping 
characteristics of the material itself can be balanced by reducing the total number 
of parts with the advantage of 3D printing integrated processing, thus reducing the 
structural damping; the lack of strength of polymer materials can be balanced by 
embedded metal The lack of strength of polymer materials can be compensated by16 1 Overview of Wind Tunnel Test Models
embedded metal, surface metal plating, etc. Therefore, based on such new under￾standing, it is possible to design and manufacture new wind tunnel test models and 
even develop new wind tunnel test techniques. 
1.3 Overview of Additive Manufacturing Technology 
for Wind Tunnel Test Models 
1.3.1 A New Framework of Design and Fabrication for Wind 
Tunnel Test Models 
Based on additive manufacturing technology, the new framework for the design and 
manufacturing of wind tunnel test models is shown in Fig. 1.7, including require￾ment analysis, model design and manufacturing (printing), model calibration and 
wind tunnel test. In the model design segment, according to the test requirements 
and similarity requirements, designers obtain the corresponding parameters of the 
model from the parameters of the vehicle prototype. In particular, due to the intro￾duction of additive manufacturing technology to increase the model design freedom, 
more automated design methods can be adopted, such as CAD and CAE fusion for 
optimal design methods. Once the design results (e.g. CAD) have been processed 
and the process parameters have been set, the 3D printer can manufacture the model 
accordingly. To ensure the accuracy and safety of the tests, the model must pass 
strength calibration, resonance calibration, stiffness calibration, vibration calibration, 
etc. Finally, the model is installed in a wind tunnel for testing to obtain aerodynamic 
data. 
Design and manufacturing of models. The design and manufacturing process is 
shown in Fig. 1.8. The whole process is divided into two phases, “virtual model” and 
“physical model” [37]. The inputs are various design requirements, and the outputs 
include wind tunnel test models and test outlines, etc.

Fig. 1.8 Flow chart of the design and manufacturing of the models 
Model design: The design of wind tunnel model starts from similarity design, 
i.e., the corresponding parameters of the model are obtained from the geometric and 
structural parameters of the prototype of the vehicle according to the similarity prin￾ciple. Under the constraints of similarity requirements, testing requirements, process 
requirements, etc., the model design results are obtained by CAD and other tools [38]. 
The model design results are obtained by CAD and other tools under the constraints 
of similarity requirements, testing requirements and process requirements. After this 
result completes the design verification [39]. The CAD data of the model can be 
obtained. 
Data processing: Data processing is a special part of 3D printing processing, which 
is used to generate the database that drives the operation of 3D printers. Generally, 
the common formats of AM data include STL, AMF, etc. Therefore, CAD data needs 
to be converted to the above data formats. Nowadays, the mainstream CAD design 
software provides data processing interfaces. Part support design and print direction 
design are necessary parts of AM process preparation [40]. 
Model forming: Once the data is available, model forming is done automatically 
by the 3D printer. The formed parts need to be removed from the supports, cleaned of 
residual raw materials, etc. To improve the material properties and surface roughness, 
the model can be post-cured (e.g., light-cured [40]), sandblasting treatment, etc. [37] 
…. 
Model installation: Thanks to the molding capability of 3D printing technology, 
the structural integrity of the model is improved and the number of parts is signifi￾cantly reduced [41]. This allows for a simplified model assembly. During the model 
assembly process, sensors and devices for data acquisition, etc. are mounted to the 
model. After fixing the final model to the wind tunnel support (usually a balance 
[42]. The design and machining process of the model is completed.18 1 Overview of Wind Tunnel Test Models
1.4 Model Calibration Overview 
Before starting the wind tunnel test, the completed model needs to be calibrated 
in order to ensure the test safety and verify the accuracy of the design. Generally 
speaking, the model calibration includes strength calibration, resonance calibration, 
ground stiffness calibration test, ground modal calibration test, etc. 
Strength calibration: The purpose of strength calibration is to ensure that the model 
will not be structurally damaged in the wind tunnel test and to prevent damage to the 
experimenter or the wind tunnel. Numerical simulation methods are often used to 
verify the strength of a model. First, the wind tunnel test conditions that will cause 
the maximum load need to be determined. Second, the loads loaded on the model 
are calculated based on the wind tunnel test conditions. Finally, the loads are loaded 
into the model and the stress distribution of the model structure is obtained using the 
FEA method. If the maximum stress of the model at the maximum load is less than 
the required stress of the material, the design passes the strength check. 
Resonance calibration: In order to avoid resonance of the model during the test, 
which may cause damage to the model, wind tunnel and even personnel, the resonance 
frequency of the model-balance-support system should be designed to be higher than 
the peak frequency of the wind tunnel caused by the flow field. This frequency is 
determined by its stiffness, damping and mass properties. Since the first two factors 
depend mainly on the unchangeable balance and support, the main design variable 
is the weight of the model. Typically, the lower the weight of the model, the higher 
the system resonance frequency [43]. 3D printing supports the use of lightweight 
structures and materials, which can reduce the weight of the model and have a 
positive impact on improving the safety of wind tunnel tests. 
Stiffness calibration: For models that need to meet the stiffness similarity condi￾tions (such as static aeroelastic models, dynamically similar models, etc.), the assem￾bled models need to be ground-checked to determine whether the stiffness distribu￾tion of the model meets expectations [44]. The principle of this test is to load a 
specific force at a specific point and invert the stiffness distribution of the model by 
measuring the deformation of the model [43]. The measurement of the deformation 
of the model is critical. Accurate measurement of the model deformation is the key, 
and non-contact measurement methods such as optics can be used [45]. Non-contact 
measurement methods such as optical can be used. 
Vibration calibration: The purpose of ground vibration testing is to calibrate the 
dynamic characteristics of the model (such as resonant frequency and resonant mode), 
etc., for dynamic model design and manufacturing accuracy [19]. In a typical test, the 
model is first fixed on a special fixture. In a typical test, the model is first fixed on a 
special fixture, and under the excitation (shaker, etc.), the model’s response in the time 
domain is obtained by sensors or non-contact testing means, and then the dynamic 
characteristics parameters of the model can be obtained after data processing using 
Fast Fourier. In a typical test, different dynamic parameters are obtained by different 
excitation methods [46]. The non-contact vibration test method reduces the number 
of the non-contact vibration test method is widely used for vibration calibration of1.5 Typical Equipments and Materials 19
models because it can reduce the interference of sensors and improve the testing 
efficiency [44]. The non-contact vibration test method is widely used for vibration 
calibration of models. 
1.5 Typical Equipments and Materials 
Most of the wind tunnel test models in this book use the SPS600B light-curing 3D 
printer of Xi’an Jiaotong University, as Fig. 1.9. The printing range is 600 mm ×

Design Basis of Wind Tunnel Test Models 
Based on Additive Manufacturing 
In order to ensure manufacutirng effectiveness, manufacturing-oriented design of 
the wind tunnel test models is required, including shape adjustment design, Active 
manipulation surface design, segmentation and connection design, and so on. 
2.1 Wind Tunnel Test Model Shape Adjustment Design 
2.1.1 Model Shape Adjustment 
1) Plugging cone design 
Generally, in order to obtain accurate experimental data, the model should simulate 
the flow of aircraft inlet and tail nozzle [2]. However, this test model does not use the 
ventilated air inlet design. If the air inlet and tail nozzle are simply blocked, the result 
will definitely make the airflow characteristics of the model not similar to those of 
the actual aircraft. When the aircraft is in flight, the airflow around the air inlet and 
tail nozzle of the aircraft is as Fig. 2.1a shows that part of the incoming flow into the 
intake, and then ejected from the tail nozzle, the rest of the uniform flow around the 
outside, usually without airflow separation; if the simple inlet and tail nozzle blocked, 
the flow characteristics as Fig. 2.1b shows, this time around the lip of the inlet and 
near the tail nozzle to produce an obvious airflow separation, around the model of 
the airflow and the aircraft is very different. Therefore, in order to better simulate 
the airflow around the aircraft, a streamlined rotating body is usually designed in the 
inlet and tail nozzle of the model, i.e., a rectifier block.

According to the design requirement of [31], the model adopts parabolic rectifier 
block, which is a rotating body with parabolic shape. The length-to-thin ratio of the 
block is 4, and the half cone angle of the tip of the block is 15°, while the shape of 
the block is consistent with the lip of the air inlet, and it is smoothly connected with 
the airframe, as shown in Fig. 2.2. 
For the tail nozzle plug can be used symmetrical shape contour line. The tail nozzle 
plug of a model uses a straight line segment profile extending 30 mm outward, as 
shown in Fig. 2.3.

2) Local enlargement design 
In the model design, the trailing edge of the manipulation surface of the model is a 
thin edge of very small thickness. As shown in Fig. 2.4 the thickness of the trailing 
edge of the flat tail δ1 = 0.07 mm and the thickness of the trailing edge of the rear 
flap δ2 = 0.09 mm. The structure of this thin edge is difficult to realize in actual 
machining. For processing convenience, the thin edge of the trailing edge of the 
maneuvering surface needs to be designed with partial thickening. 
At present, the processing accuracy of 3D printing is ± 0.1 mm, i.e., the thickness 
of the processed layering is 0.05–0.1 mm. If the thin edge size of the manipulation 
surface of the model is less than 0.1 mm, the thin edge is easily incomplete or missing 
when printing, which affects the shape dimensional accuracy of the manipulation 
surface of the model, and then affects the aerodynamic characteristics of the model. 
The thin edge of the manipulation surface is partially thickened. As shown in 
Fig. 2.5, in order not to affect the overall shape of the manipulation surface, the 
offset section is appropriate at the last 2–3 mm of the trailing edge, and the trailing 
edge is offset by 0.1 mm outward along the center line, so that the thickness of the 
thin edge of the trailing edge is greater than 0.2 mm.
3) Baseline marking design 
After the aircraft model is assembled, in order to measure and adjust the position 
accuracy and angle of the model, it is necessary to make engraving lines on the 
model, the following are the engraving line requirements for the model [31]:
(1) The horizontal reference line of the fuselage; 
(2) The line of intersection of the fuselage reference plane (i.e. the fuselage 
symmetry plane) with the fuselage; 
(3) The intersection of the wing chord plane with the wing, the leading and lateral 
edges of the other airfoils;24 2 Design Basis of Wind Tunnel Test Models Based on Additive …

(4) The centerline of the external object and its position line on the wing and 
fuselage; 
(5) The width of the scoring line is less than 0.2 mm and the depth is less than 
0.2 mm. 
The engraving of metal models needs to be done after the processing of the model 
shape is completed, which is difficult and takes a long time to process. Light-curing 
3D printing has the processing advantage of printing any complex structure at one 
time, so we can consider processing and printing the model shape parts and model 
engraving at the same time, such as Fig. 2.6.
2.2 Active Manipulation Surface Design for Wind Tunnel 
Test Model 
2.2.1 Overview of Model Manipulation Surface Design 
According to the test outline of the test, if the efficiency of each rudder surface is 
to be measured, it is necessary to ensure that the flaps, ailerons, rudder, elevator or 
flat tail on the model can be deflected within the required range, and the relative 
position of each maneuvering surface rotation axis should be the same as that of 
the prototype. In order to achieve the rudder surface deflection, some small parts of 
the rudder surface maneuvering mechanism of the model that do not simulate the 
prototype are allowed to be exposed to the airflow. The rudder surface manipulation 
mechanism should be convenient and accurate when changing the rudder surface 
deflection angle, and it should ensure that the deflection angle of each manipulation 
surface does not change due to the aerodynamic force during the test. The technical 
requirements of the manipulating surface of the wind tunnel test model include [2]:
(1) Accurate shape: Maneuvering surfaces are designed in accordance with 
geometric similarity requirements, and certain small parts that do not mimic 
the prototype cannot be exposed to the airflow;2.2 Active Manipulation Surface Design for Wind Tunnel Test Model 25
Inscribed lines 
Fig. 2.6 Aircraft reference line design
(2) Adjustable angle: the manipulation surface can be deflected within a certain 
angle range, and the deflection angle for the manipulation surface should be 
precise; 
(3) Structural reliability: the connection structure should have sufficient rigidity and 
strength to ensure that the manipulation surface declination does not change 
during the experiment due to the action of aerodynamic forces; 
(4) Easy to disassemble: connection structure should be easy to disassemble, for 
repeated use of the structure, should also consider the durability of the mating 
surface. 
Traditional metal models generally use two forms of pivot pin positioning and 
variable angle piece positioning. Figure 2.7a is the rudder deflection method, because 
there is not enough structural space to install and fix the rotor shaft, only different 
rudder models with different angles can be made, and during the experiment, the 
rudder deflection angle can be changed by installing different rudder models, also 
this deflection method can be applied to the front flap, aileron, rear flap and other 
structures; Fig. 2.7b is the structure method of deflecting the flat tail, through the pin 
hole; Fig. 2.7b is the structure of deflecting flat tail, which can make a pair of flat 
tail meet different angles of flat tail deflection through the pin holes. The design of 
the maneuvering surface of the resin-metal composite model also refers to Fig. 2.7. 
However, it is necessary to optimize the design of these two solutions to ensure 
that the connection strength of the resin material manipulation surface structure can26 2 Design Basis of Wind Tunnel Test Models Based on Additive …

Fig. 2.7 Structural form of manipulation surface of wind tunnel test model. a Deflected rudder 
structure form, b deflected flat tail structure form 
meet the experimental requirements, and at the same time, to take advantage of the 
processing advantage of 3D printing without the complexity of the model, whether 
the model and its components that need to be divided when processing the metal 
model but are actually unnecessary can be printed as a whole by 3D printing method. 
For larger models, the manipulation surface can be positioned by means of angle 
plates, positioning plates, positioning pins and clamping hinges, as shown in Figs. 2.8, 
2.9, 2.10 and 2.11. The advantages and disadvantages of various connection posi￾tioning methods are compared in Table 2.1. Among them, the variable angle piece 
is a common positioning method, in which a series of angle pieces are machined 
according to the test content and the rudder declination is changed by replacing 
different angle pieces. If the angle needs to be increased during the test, a new angle 
piece is simply machined. The use of angle pieces to achieve different rudder decli￾nation is more time-consuming, and changing the rudder declination is also more 
troublesome. However, this way the model surface is clean, the connection is reliable, 
and the repeatability of angle positioning is high.

For smaller models, it is difficult to use various rudder surface steering mecha￾nisms mentioned above because of the small size of the steering surface and the small 
aerodynamic load on the steering surface. In this case, the transition fit of the shaft 
hole can be used to achieve the rudder surface deflection angle adjustment. Using 
this approach, angle samples should be provided. 
2.2.2 Suitable for 3D Printing of Variable Angle Piece Design 
In the model manufacturing method based on light-curing printing, the model and 
its components do not have the problem of structural complexity, and the model 
and its components that need to be divided during CNC machining but are actually 
unnecessary can be printed as a whole by the 3D printing method. Also, considering 
the size of the model and its components and the size of the load bearing, the following 
two options are designed: 
1) Integrated printing of variable angle sheets and manipulation surfaces 
As Fig. 2.12 shown, in the small-sized maneuvering surface components, the maneu￾vering surface does not have enough thickness to install the metal vario-angle piece, 
so the solution of integrating the vario-angle piece with the maneuvering surface is 
adopted. The pure resin maneuvering surface structure reduces the assembly link 
and has high assembly accuracy, but in the test, several angles of the maneuvering 
surface need to be tested, several angles of the resin maneuvering surface have to 
be manufactured, so it cannot be replaced by one resin maneuvering surface, and 
therefore, it cannot be replaced by a resin manipulating surface, and the strength 
of the connection between the manipulating surface and the main wing is low and 
cannot bear excessive load.

2) Separate printing of the angle change piece and the manipulation surface 
As Fig. 2.13a shows, in the large size manipulating surface parts, the manipulating 
surface has enough thickness to install the metal varicaps, and the deflection of the 
manipulating surface can be realized by installing varicaps with different angles, 
so only one resin manipulating surface can meet the test requirements of multiple 
deflection angles, and the resin manipulating surface fixed on the varicaps has high 
connection strength, which can improve the connection strength of the manipulating 
surface. However, the CNC milled metal angle change piece cannot fully satisfy 
the pneumatic shape of the model, and generally the shape has to be repaired with 
putty. Meanwhile, since the secondary assembly is used, the manufacturing accuracy 
of the metal angle change piece and resin manipulating surface needs to be strictly 
controlled to ensure the assembly accuracy of the manipulating surface.

As Fig. 2.13b shows, the metal skeleton can be extended to the part of the metal 
angle change piece in the large size model design. By attaching the metal angle change 
piece to the metal skeleton, it can maximize the connection strength of the maneu￾vering surface and ensure that the maneuvering surface can maintain the accurate 
deflection angle even under the large aerodynamic load. 
Analyzing the above two design solutions, we can see the advantages and disad￾vantages of each of the two solutions, as shown in Table 2.2. The model size is small 
and the experimental load is small, so the variable angle piece and the manipulation 
surface can be manufactured integrally; the model size is larger, the manipulation 
surface changes many angles, and the experimental load is large, so the variable 
angle piece and the manipulation surface can be printed separately. 
Combined with the structural size characteristics of this model, the front flap, rear 
flap, aileron and rudder of the model are printed separately from the maneuvering 
surface, as shown in Fig. 2.14. If the maneuvering surface is large, more than one 
angle-change piece can be used to fix the connection. The front flap of this model 
is fixed with two angle-change pieces, and the angle-change pieces of the front flap, 
rear flap and aileron are fixed on the metal wing skeleton in order to improve the 
connection strength of the maneuvering surface.
When the deflection axis of the maneuvering surface is not on the center line of 
the chord surface at both ends of the maneuvering surface, the maneuvering surface 
will produce position deflection after deflection, and there will be a large gap or even 
interference when connecting with the main wing, so different angles of deflection 
need to be realized with different angles of the front flap parts. For example, in 
this model, since the axis of deflection is on the lower surface, two sets of circular 
transition front flaps are designed in the two sets of rudder surface deflection to 
reduce the gap in the assembly. Table 2.3 shows the composition of the maneuvering 
surface parts for the applicable variable angle sheet form.

2.2.3 Suitable for 3D Printing of Pivot Pins Design 
Taking advantage of the processing advantages of light-curing 3D printing, the shape 
and manipulation surface parts of the model are made of resin; the main deflection 
positioning and load-bearing parts, such as the fixed base, and the rotary axis are 
made of metal. The base is fixed and connected in the resin profile, and the rotary 
axis is fixed and connected in the resin manipulation surface, and the base and rotary 
axis are fixed by pin holes when assembled, as shown in Fig. 2.15.
The base, as the main load-bearing component, is installed and fixed in a way that 
determines the reliability of the entire deflection structure, and the following two 
installation methods are mainly adopted: 
(1) Base and metal skeleton connection 
This solution is easy to position and simple to install, and because the base is 
connected to the metal skeleton, the whole metal skeleton acts as a force-bearing, 
and its connection strength is high to ensure that the maneuvering surface deflection 
angle does not change during the test due to the aerodynamic force. However, this 
also increases the design difficulty of the metal skeleton and the installation difficulty 
of the resin housing components.32 2 Design Basis of Wind Tunnel Test Models Based on Additive …

Pin 
Resin body Resin Flat

Fig. 2.15 Rotating pin structure
(2) Base embedded in resin parts and fixed with adhesive 
The connection strength of this scheme is the design key. In order to increase the 
bonding performance between resin and metal, the base should be designed as large 
as possible, try to increase the size of L, B and H, increase the contact area between 
metal and metal, and roll the grid around the surface of the base to increase the 
mosaic effect of the colloid and the surface to enhance the bonding performance. 
Also ensure that the wall thickness δ of the resin is above 5 mm to avoid thin wall 
thickness and rupture under larger load, as Fig. 2.16 shown. 
The rotating shaft parts are also embedded in the maneuvering surface and then 
fixed with adhesive. The flat surface of the chord like the flat tail makes it difficult 
to have space to insert the rotating shaft into a deeper position, and the volume and 
area occupied by the rotating shaft is small compared to the flat tail, so it cannot bear 
too much load, as shown in Fig. 2.17.
The flat tail part of this model is far away from the tail skeleton, and it is difficult 
to design the connection between the base and the skeleton, so the base is embedded 
in the resin part and then fixed with adhesive. As Fig. 2.18 and Table 2.4 shows the 
composition of the maneuvering surface parts for the variable angle piece form.

2.2.4 3D Printed Rudder Surface Connection Design 
In CNC machining, for the convenience of manufacturing, the wings, flaps and angle 
change pieces are often processed separately, and the deflection of the maneuvering 
surface is achieved by replacing the angle change pieces with different deflection 
angles. In the 3D printing-oriented manufacturing mode, there is no problem of 
the complexity of the model, and the model that needs to be divided during CNC 
machining but is not necessary can be printed as a whole by the 3D printing method. 
If required, the variable angle piece can be manufactured in conjunction with the flap. 
The comparative analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of various assembly 
connection methods is shown in Table 2.5.34 2 Design Basis of Wind Tunnel Test Models Based on Additive …

(1) Integrated manufacturing of variable-angle flaps and flaps: Applicable to small￾sized parts, a large number of interchangeable flaps need to be manufactured, 
and each flap corresponds to a certain deflection angle, thus using a large amount 
of resin, but there is only one level of assembly, and the assembly accuracy is 
relatively high. 
(2) Variable angle piece and flaps are printed separately: Applicable to large size 
parts, the position angle of flaps is adjusted by each variable angle piece with 
different declination, secondary assembly, which affects the assembly accuracy, 
but saves the use of resin material. It can be divided into three forms: resin, 
resin-metal composite, and metal. 
Pure resin angle change piece completely printed by resin, can be cured sleeve 
with screws and angle change piece assembly hole interference fit, angle change 
piece need to leave a 0.5 mm fit margin, apply external force to destroy the size 
of the angle change piece aperture spin assembly, this method angle change piece 
can not be reused, should be prepared more than one angle piece to meet the use of 
demand. The traditional metal processing method has good processing accuracy and 
connection strength, but the processing is time-consuming and does not facilitate the 
flow line with the resin profile surface repair. 
The design of the resin-metal composite angle change piece is divided into two 
parts, as shown in Fig. 2.19. The part that fits to the chord plane is made of metal 
with regular shape design, which is convenient for processing; the part that fits to the 
airfoil of the aircraft is processed by resin 3D printing method, and the resin shape is 
easy to be resharpened and convenient to match the streamline with the airfoil. The 
metal and resin are bonded to form the whole of the variable angle piece, and the 
bonding strength can be increased by changing the roughness of the bonding surface, 
and the bonding positioning of the upper and lower parts is completed by using the 
way of setting through-holes for the metal and tabs for the resin.2.2 Active Manipulation Surface Design for Wind Tunnel Test Model 35

Fig. 2.20 Built-in angular deflection method 
The above method uses the traditional form of varus sheet, which is placed only 
on one side of the wing chord plane, and part of the airfoil is scribed into the varus 
sheet, which will have some effect on the profile surface. Since 3D printing does not 
have this trouble of machining deep grooves in the thin part of the wing, this book 
also considered the method. The assembly structure shown in Fig. 2.20, where the 
variable angle piece is placed in the middle of the chord plane to keep the wing profile 
continuous and intact, forming a slotted connection, and the assembly connection is 
made with pins, which also requires metal reinforcement of the connection part. 
2.2.5 Reinforcement Method for Resin Assembly Parts 
Due to the brittleness of resin material and the disadvantage of easy wear, metal 
parts can be inlaid in the assembly part to overcome the brittleness of resin, improve 
the connection strength and ensure the reuse of each part without damaging the 
connection surface. The metal insert is used for the connection of screws, etc., so 
it is also necessary to ensure the coaxiality of the hole during assembly to avoid 
serious tilting or misalignment during the threaded connection, so the following two 
methods of positioning the assembly hole are proposed.36 2 Design Basis of Wind Tunnel Test Models Based on Additive …
(1) Auxiliary positioning method 
As shown in Fig. 2.21, the axis of the connection hole is perpendicular to the chord 
plane, so the chord plane is used as the axial positioning surface of the sleeve and 
the template, and the mounting boundary surface of the variable angle piece assists 
the hole position of the template to determine the radial position of the sleeve. The 
positioning template is laminated to the chord plane of the resin model and the 
installation boundary surface of the variable angle piece, and the positioning holes 
of the template are CNC machined, and the pins are installed and the sleeve is set to 
determine the radial direction of the connecting sleeve. The maximum length of the 
sleeve should not be higher than the aircraft airfoil where the bonding hole is located to 
prevent the impact on the airfoil shape, and then insert the sleeve on the pin to prevent 
the flow of the bonding agent into the sleeve countersink hole. The outer surface of 
the sleeve is rolled mesh to increase the mosaic effect between the adhesive and the 
surface to enhance the bonding performance; the gap between the outer surface of 
the sleeve and the bonding hole is taken as 1–3 mm, in order to facilitate the injection 
flow of viscous resin or sufficient UV irradiation of photosensitive resin, while also 
ensuring the bonding strength, the connection gap can be adjusted according to the 
height of the bonding hole. 
(2) Direct positioning method 
As shown in Fig. 2.22 the 3D printed model’s own stepped hole surface is used as the 
positioning reference, and the metal sleeve is directly pressed into the positioning 
hole after applying adhesive, thus leaving a certain gap at the non-positioning surface 
to facilitate the curing of the adhesive connection.

2.3 Segmentation and Connection Design of Wind Tunnel 
Test Model 
Wind tunnel test models are developing in the direction of large-scale and mono￾lithic, while the processing size range of 3D printing equipment is limited (e.g., the 
maximum processing size of SPS600B light-curing 3D printer of Xi’an Jiaotong 
University is 600 mm × 600 mm × 450 mm). For some larger model parts, 3D 
printers cannot finish processing at one time, which requires dividing the large parts 
into several smaller sub-parts to be processed separately and then finally bonded or 
assembled into a whole. On the other hand, due to the different shape characteristics 
of the model parts, it is sometimes difficult to ensure that all parts of the parts are 
printed in one direction with high precision or form a more uniform error. If the parts 
are reasonably divided, the printing process can be optimized separately according 
to the need, thus improving the overall manufacturing accuracy of the model. 
2.3.1 Wind Tunnel Test Model of Splitting Design 
When the model is designed, it should be combined with the test content specified 
in the test syllabus and the processing range of the 3D printer, and the model should 
be split appropriately. The reasonable splitting of the model makes the parts process 
well, reduces the manufacturing cost and improves the manufacturing accuracy; 
meanwhile, it makes the parts position accurately, connect reliably and disassemble 
easily. 
1) Principle of division 
The segmentation of the wind tunnel test model is firstly oriented to the segmen￾tation of the test requirements. When designing the model, the model should be 
decomposed into parts according to the test content specified in the test outline. 
Decomposition of parts requires reasonable, easy disassembly; parts connected to 
reliable, accurate positioning; parts of good craftsmanship, low manufacturing costs; 
parts interchangeability is good, using different forms of assembly to meet the various 
requirements of the test. For example, in the aircraft selection test, the model can38 2 Design Basis of Wind Tunnel Test Models Based on Additive …
be used to measure the aerodynamic characteristics of the whole aircraft, but also 
requires the measurement of the contribution of each component to the aerodynamics. 
Therefore, each part of the model (such as wing, fuselage, tail, hair room, landing 
gear, external bracket, etc.) should be easily disassembled and assembled. When 
doing the test of individual parts, it is required that each part itself can maintain a 
smooth aerodynamic shape; when doing the test of the whole aircraft, it can be easily 
installed and the repeatable positioning accuracy of the parts can be ensured; when 
conducting the experiment without the wing, the wing can be removed and a wing 
plug block can be installed to keep the surface of the fuselage with a smooth shape. 
In determining the structure of the model, it should also consider the support 
mode of the model in the wind tunnel, and the requirements of the model and wind 
tunnel equipment. For example, try to arrange the installation position and space of 
the scanning valve in the inner cavity of the pressure measurement model, and the 
pressure measurement tube, cable and pipeline pulled out from the model should be 
led from the position with little bypass interference. For some special test models, 
such as the power motor and water-cooled pipeline with power test, the layout of 
power cables, special measuring instruments (hot-wire anemometer, acceleration 
sensor, actual angle sensor, etc.) installation coordination, blowing or jet test of high￾pressure gas pipeline, etc., in the model design are required to leave a suitable space 
or reasonable laying. Therefore, in order to avoid the influence of the instrument on 
the aircraft blowing flow field, and to facilitate the installation of various sensors and 
piping system laying, the aircraft wind tunnel test model also needs to be processed 
in separate parts. 
The wind tunnel test model should reduce the number of divisions to reduce the 
impact of assembly errors. A typical set of model structures is roughly divided into 
the following parts: 
(1) The fuselage part: is the model of the load-bearing parts, the fuselage has 
the main force members, due to the slender fuselage, to use the segmentation 
structure, according to the needs of the general from 2 to 4 sections. 
(2) Airfoil part: It is the force-bearing part of the model, including the wing, 
horizontal tail, vertical tail, and bullet wing, etc. 
(3) Movable maneuvering surface part: including wing leading and trailing edge 
flaps, ailerons, elevator, rudder, angle piece, hinge mechanism, etc. 
(4) Power and ventilation lines: including lip devices, ventilation lines y, engine 
compartment, nozzle and nozzle, etc. 
(5) Connection and support device: mainly with the wind tunnel connected to the 
support rod, the sky and other components. 
2) The number of splits and the choice of split location 
According to the test requirements of the wind tunnel test model, accuracy require￾ments, etc., combined with the working range of the printer to determine the number 
of sub-model divisions, the overall layout of the chunk. Since the assembly of sub￾models inevitably brings a certain degree of accuracy loss, and this error may increase2.3 Segmentation and Connection Design of Wind Tunnel Test Model 39
a little with each increase in the number of sub-models, unnecessary partitioning 
should be avoided as much as possible to keep the number of sub-models as small 
as possible. 
When the printing parameters are certain, the deformation of the sub-model is 
mainly determined by the structure and manufacturing direction of the sub-model, 
so the manufacturing direction of the sub-model should be considered when the 
specific partition is made. For large parts segmentation manufacturing, in order to 
ensure the same amount of deformation on both sides of the same segmentation line 
and the same deformation direction, two adjacent sub-model manufacturing should 
try to ensure that the spatial direction of the segmentation section is the same, in order 
to reduce the overall deformation after assembly. In order to reduce the deformation 
of the sub-model, the manufacturing direction should also try to make the sub-model 
structure with small deformation or Z-direction deformation-based easy-to-control 
cross-section when printing, such as priority use of non-slender cross-section, annular 
cross-section, etc. The size of the split section should be moderate, not too large, as far 
as possible in the shape of the more regular or less strict size requirements, otherwise 
the flatness of the plane will be difficult to ensure, is not conducive to the assembly 
and bonding of the sub-model; also not too small, try to avoid cutting at the thin 
wall, otherwise the positioning structure will have nowhere to add, but also affect 
the assembly strength of the parts. 
The deformation of the model manufacturing is related to the size of the model, 
so the size distribution of the sub-model is also considered in the specific division. 
As shown in Fig. 2.23, the deformation of sub-model 1 along the common division 
line is different from the deformation of sub-models 2 and 3 along the line, and the 
deformation of sub-models 2 and 3 along the other division line is also different, so 
it is difficult to splice smoothly on this division line in the end. Therefore, the size 
of the sub-models should be the same or similar when splitting, so as to avoid the 
splicing situation of less to more on one split line.

Surface-based model, due to the sub-model manufacturing deformation not only 
Z-direction warpage, there is also deformation within the XOY surface, this defor￾mation is generally expressed as a reduction in the curvature of the arc, so that it 
tends to be straight, in the case of a small difference in arc length, the curvature of the 
arc deformation is larger. The specific model of the cross-section type is generally 
a combination of arcs of different curvature, the local deformation on both sides of 
the split line has a great impact on the assembly and the deformation after assembly, 
such as Fig. 2.24. In order to reduce the deformation after assembly, it can be seen 
that the change of local curvature may cause a large deformation after assembly. In 
order to smoothly assemble and reduce the overall deformation after assembly, the 
partition line should be chosen at the curvature of the surface as small as possible. 
The surface of the wind tunnel test model is curved, and the streamline surface is not 
complicated and has few abrupt changes, so it can be divided appropriately according 
to the curvature change. 
3) Example of segmentation design 
An aircraft test model with fuselage length L = 1420 mm and wingspan b = 850 mm 
is required to conduct efficiency tests of front flaps, ailerons, rear flaps, rudder and 
flat tail according to the test syllabus. Therefore, the front flap, aileron, rear flap, 
rudder and flat tail parts of the model should be separated from the fuselage model 
and designed as a disassembled structure; according to the processing range of 3D 
printer, the model is mainly divided into five parts: nose, front fuselage, left wing, 
right wing and tail; in order to reduce the separate manufacturing and assembly of 
small parts and reduce the assembly error of the model, the air inlet block is printed 
as one piece with the nose and the gun is printed as one piece with the front fuselage. 
In order to reduce the number of small parts, the air inlet plug is printed with the 
nose, the cannon is printed with the front fuselage, and the tail, ventral fin and tail 
are printed in one system. As shown in Fig. 2.25 the resin parts of the model were 
finally split into 14 parts.2.3 Segmentation and Connection Design of Wind Tunnel Test Model 41

4) Design of assembly auxiliary structure 
The division should be considered in a good assembly way. Unlike the test-oriented 
assembly, the model division considered here is no longer required to be removable 
after assembly. The adhesive is directly used for bonding, and a certain bonding gap 
is also cut out between the model assembly sections. At the same time, the model is 
required to meet the strength of the connection after assembly, and a mounting slot 
can be designed in the part that allows redesign, and the metal reinforcement plate 
can be embedded in the mounting slot and bonded, and a certain bonding gap should 
be reserved between the reinforcement plate and the mounting slot. In addition, the 
assembly also needs positioning structures, such as tabs, recessed holes, etc., through 
the positioning structure to assist the model of accurate assembly. The positioning 
structure is often square or round, and in order to ensure better positioning and to 
meet the strength requirements after bonding, it can be cut as shown in Fig. 2.26. The 
size and number of positioning steps on the partition line are related to the size of the 
sub-model and the length of the partition line, but the number of positioning steps 
on a partition line should not be too many, 2–4 is appropriate, too many may cause 
assembly difficulties. In addition, due to the impact of 3D printer processing accuracy, 
the best between the tab and the concave hole there is a certain gap, according to 
experience is usually taken 0.1–0.2 mm is appropriate, so as to avoid the occurrence 
of interference fit when splicing. Also consider the gap left for the bonding layer, the 
length of the tab should also be slightly greater than the depth of the positioning hole, 
generally 1–2 mm. positioning structure is best combined with the printing direction, 
so that the positioning surface without step effect, forming a better printing plane.42 2 Design Basis of Wind Tunnel Test Models Based on Additive …

The partitioning of large wind tunnel test models is a process of continuous opti￾mization around the deformation problem of 3D printing manufacturing. The number 
of sub-pieces is grasped from the whole, the manufacturing direction of the model 
is determined by combining with the accuracy requirements, and then a reasonable 
division position is selected to design the assembly support structure. Before the sub￾model is printed and manufactured, support is added according to the pre-considered 
manufacturing direction. The support should suppress the deformation well, espe￾cially to ensure the printing quality at the positioning structure. If the partitioning 
scheme does not meet the printing requirements, corresponding modifications are 
made to optimize the manufacturing deformation. 
2.3.2 Connection Design of Wind Tunnel Test Model 
1) Resin-to-metal connection 
The connection of resin parts with embedded metal parts is mainly used to improve 
the model mechanical properties of the composite reinforcement program, which 
requires simplified processing (especially metal parts), accurate positioning and 
firmness. The assembly of resin parts with metal skeleton is mainly done in two 
ways: 
(1) Resin parts are bonded directly to the metal skeleton surface using an 
adhesive 
This kind of assembly is mainly applied to resin parts that do not need to be disas￾sembled, as long as the binder is evenly applied to the surface of the metal parts, and 
then the metal parts are inserted into the resin parts, and after the binder solidifies, 
the assembly is connected. Since the resin parts cannot be disassembled, the resin 
parts must be installed successfully at one time, so the processing accuracy of the 
model is required to be high.2.3 Segmentation and Connection Design of Wind Tunnel Test Model 43
(2) Resin parts are fixed to the surface of the metal skeleton with fastening 
screws 
The resin parts of this assembly method can be disassembled repeatedly. Due to 
the disadvantages of brittleness and easy wear of resin material, the screws may 
extrude and wear the resin parts, affecting the quality of the connection surface and 
the strength of the connection. To overcome these drawbacks and to be able to ensure 
the reuse of the parts, two options were studied: 
The assembly part is embedded with metal parts. As shown in Fig. 2.27 the metal 
insert is inserted into the aperture and fixed in the resin part by the adhesive. When 
manufacturing the metal insert, the mesh can be rolled on the outer surface of the 
metal insert to increase the surface action of the binder and the metal insert to enhance 
the bonding performance. Since the metal insert is mainly used to bear the fastening 
force of the screw, the coaxiality of the hole during assembly needs to be ensured in 
order to avoid serious tilt or misalignment during the threaded connection. 
Add metal gaskets to the assembly parts. As shown in Fig. 2.28 the shim is placed 
in a recess in the resin assembly area to carry the screw fastening force. This solution 
requires the resin step to have a certain thickness to withstand the large load, while 
the depth of the recess ensures that the shims and screws are not exposed.
The advantages and disadvantages of the two solutions are shown in Table 2.6. 
The advantages of the metal insert are that it is suitable for any assembly part, but 
the assembly is complicated, and the bonding hole has to be polished to remove 
surface impurities before assembly; the coaxiality of the hole has to be ensured 
during assembly to prevent the bonding agent from overflowing, unevenness and 
other reasons from affecting the shape characteristics of the aircraft; since there will 
be a certain gap between the diameter of the 3D printed hole and the design diameter,

there is a defect that the metal sleeve cannot be properly installed and positioned, and 
if the actual resin hole diameter is larger than the metal, the radial offset error will be 
large; if the actual resin hole diameter is smaller than the metal, the resin hole needs 
to be reamed and reamed, which may also have an impact on the positioning error. 
The advantage of the shim is that it is easy and fast to assemble and does not require 
high printing accuracy for the bore diameter and concave table, but the solution has 
certain requirements for the thickness of the resin step. If the thickness of the step is 
too small, it will not be able to withstand the large load, and the step will be easily 
broken or worn through, which will not be able to play the role of screw fastening; 
at the same time, the depth of the recess should not be too shallow, so that the shim 
and the screw will not be exposed and destroy the shape characteristics of the model.

Metal inserts Suitable for any assembly part High processing requirements

In summary, considering the simplification of the model assembly link, we choose 
the option of adding shims as long as the resin thickness of the assembly part can be 
guaranteed. 
2) Resin-Resin connection 
The connection between resin parts mainly includes the split to meet the test require￾ments and the split to meet the printer processing range requirements and improve 
the printing accuracy of key parts, which requires the corresponding seams to fit 
well and not affect the pneumatic shape. The connection between resin parts can be 
divided into the following two options: 
(1) Adhesive connection 
This solution is mainly used for resin parts with non-structural loads and light loads, 
as well as resin parts that do not require disassembly. The binder is used in the resin 
parts that need to be connected, and at the same time, structures such as tabs can be 
designed between the assembly surfaces to increase the contact surface between the 
binder and the resin parts to improve the bonding performance. Due to the processing 
error of 3D printing, there may be a certain gap between resin assembly surfaces, 
which can be repaired by adding resin secondary light curing, as shown in Fig. 2.29. 
(2) Metal reinforced connection 
This solution is mainly used for resin parts with larger loads and resin parts that cannot 
be easily mounted to a metal skeleton. Under large loads, resin parts connected by 
binder alone are prone to fracture, so it is possible to consider adding metal-reinforced

inserts between resin parts and connecting the metal-reinforced inserts to resin parts 
by binder to improve the strength of the connection between resin parts, as shown in 
Fig. 2.30. 
Both resin-metal connection and resin-resin connection need to consider the 
assembly positioning of the model to ensure the correct installation position of resin 
parts and metal inserts. Resin material is difficult to adopt pin positioning because it 
is easy to wear, so positioning structures such as tabs, concave holes and steps can 
be designed. The number of positioning structures should not be too many so as not 
to increase the processing difficulty and assembly difficulty, and generally 2–4 are 
appropriate according to the size of the assembly surface. 
When resin parts are assembled with metal inserts, the processing accuracy of 
both is required to be consistent and the assembly accuracy is good. The key is that 
through a tight connection, the main load of the model can be transferred to the 
metal parts to ensure the safety of the resin parts, so ensuring the tightness of the 
two connections and the coordination of deformation is the key to such connections. 
Due to the resin material characteristics and the processing characteristics of light￾curing 3D printing, resin parts are easy to shrink when printing holes, slots and 
other structural shapes, and there is a certain loss of dimensional accuracy of the 
parts, which is easy to produce an interference fit in the assembly, making it difficult 
or impossible to assemble resin parts. Therefore, the following two measures are 
considered in the assembly design:
(1) to leave a reasonable assembly gap between the assembly structure, according to 
general processing experience, resin parts and metal inserts assembly, assembly 
gap is usually 0.2–0.3 mm appropriate; if resin parts and metal inserts need to 
use binder, assembly gap is usually 0.4–0.5 mm appropriate;2.3 Segmentation and Connection Design of Wind Tunnel Test Model 47

Process Basis of Additive Manufacturing 
for Wind Tunnel Test Models 
3.1 Relevance of Design and Manufacturing for Wind 
Tunnel Test Models 
In terms of processing range, the existing 3D printing equipment has the limitation 
of processing size and cannot manufacture the whole wind tunnel test model with 
larger size or large size wind tunnel test model parts, which need to be designed for 
splitting the wind tunnel test model. In terms of accuracy characteristics, 3D printing 
manufacturing is not limited by the complexity of the shape and structure of the 
parts, which has strong advantages for manufacturing wind tunnel test models with 
complex streamline shapes and complex internal structures. However, because the 
processing accuracy of 3D printing is ± 0.1 mm, to a certain extent, it will cause the 
absence of tiny features, and there are limitations for the microfine structural features 
of wind tunnel test models such as ultra-thin wingtips and ultra-small deep apertures, 
thus the design of wind tunnel test models can be modified to a structure suitable 
for 3D printing processing under the premise of meeting the aerodynamic shape and 
testing requirements. In addition, because the step effect will have a large impact on 
the aerodynamic shape accuracy of the wind tunnel test model, the wind tunnel test 
model shape should be designed to compensate for the different printing directions. 
In terms of manufacturing economy, the manufacturing cycle and manufacturing 
cost of 3D printed parts are not related to the shape and complexity of the parts, 
but only to their net volume, and the manufacturing cost and processing time can be 
estimated based on the volume of the CAD model. In addition, to ensure the strength 
and stiffness of the model, other low-cost and high-performance materials can be 
considered for filling inside the wind tunnel test model.

3.2 Additive Manufacturing Process for Wind Tunnel Test 
Models 
The resin parts of the model were processed on the SPS600B light-curing rapid 
prototyping machine at Xi’an Jiaotong University. SOMOS 14120 was selected as 
the resin material, and Magics RP 10.0 software was used to prepare the data before 
light-curing printing, including the selection of the printing direction of the resin 
parts, the design of the added support, and the layout design. 
3.2.1 Data Pre-processing 
1) Data Conversion 
At present, almost all types of 3D printing systems use STL data format, which is 
the data exchange standard between CAD system and 3D printing system, it discrete 
the continuous surface of 3D CAD model into the geometry of triangular pieces, so 
it greatly simplifies the data format of 3D CAD model, but STL data format only 
approximates the outer surface of 3D CAD model, the smaller the size of small 
triangular pieces, the more the number, the higher the accuracy of the model approx￾imation. The smaller the size and the more the number of small triangular slices, the 
higher the accuracy of the approximate approximation of the model. The smaller the 
size and the more the number of small triangles, the higher the accuracy of the model 
approximation. Generally, in the 3D CAD software, when exporting STL format files, 
the accuracy parameters are required to be entered, which is the maximum allow￾able error of fitting the original CAD model with STL format. However, for surface 
models, no matter how to improve the conversion accuracy, the small triangular face 
piece can not completely fit the surface, especially the larger the radius of curvature, 
the more obvious the error. For a model such as shown in Fig. 3.1, the exported data 
will be closer to the prism if the accuracy parameters are set to a limited extent.
The fundamental way to eliminate such errors is to use the CAD data directly in 
the 3D printing system without STL conversion. But so far there is no technology 
that can reach this step, the existing way is to rely on experience to set the appropriate 
accuracy parameters to reduce the error when STL format conversion of CAD models. 
Since most of the aircraft wind tunnel test models are curved surfaces, the surface 
accuracy of the shape is very critical, so the data design from CAD to STL has an 
important impact, and the common way of outputting the file directly to STL format 
is not desirable, which largely reduces the accuracy requirements of the printed parts. 
The model is designed in the design software, and the triangle tolerance can be 
set when exporting the STL file format. Figure 3.2 shows the effect of STL triangular 
surface delineation under different accuracy conditions. From the figure, it can be 
seen that if the triangle tolerance is set larger, the surface of STL data will have 
obvious stripes, which will affect the surface accuracy of the model and thus reduce 
the printing accuracy; if the triangle tolerance is set smaller, the surface of STL data3.2 Additive Manufacturing Process for Wind Tunnel Test Models 51
Fig. 3.1 STL file format for 
cylinders
will be smoother, which ensures the printing accuracy of the model. But in the CAD 
output STL, not the higher the accuracy is better, this is because the characteristics 
of the 3D printing process itself determines its accuracy in ± 0.1 mm, too high 
precision requirements exceed the accuracy indicators that can be achieved by the 
3D printing manufacturing system, generally huge amount of triangle face piece will 
reduce the running speed of Magics RP 10.0 software, the processing time of the 
model face piece increases significantly, at the same time huge amount of the large 
number of triangular facets will create many small line segments in the model profile 
cross-section, which is not conducive to the scanning motion of the beam, resulting 
in low productivity and poor surface finish.
The accuracy of the aerodynamic profile of the wind tunnel test model affects the 
accuracy of the wind tunnel test data, especially the printing accuracy of the nose 
tip, leading edge of the front flap, trailing flap, trailing edge of the aileron and other 
curved parts is especially important. This not only ensures the accuracy of the data 
but also minimizes the size of the data file and improves the efficiency of subsequent 
data processing. 
2) Offset Compensation 
Since 3D printing technology is an ensemble of 3D entities discrete into cut layers 
with thickness, model layering not only destroys the continuity of the model surface, 
but also loses the contour information between adjacent cut layers. The thickness 
of the layers is the resolution of the discrete model, the larger the thickness of the 
layers, the lower the resolution, the more data the model loses, and the greater the 
printing error. The following two main types of errors are likely to occur during 
model printing:52 3 Process Basis of Additive Manufacturing for Wind Tunnel Test Models
 
(a) Data conversion with an accuracy of 1.0mm (b) Data conversion with an accuracy of 0.08mm 
Fig. 3.2 STL triangular surface slice division under different accuracy conditions
Layering error: When the model is layered, each layer always has a certain thick￾ness, set as ∆t, the model along the cut layer direction of the dimensional length of 
l, when l can not be divided by ∆t the model will have a part of the thin layer can 
not be printed, it will cause the dimensional error in the direction of layering. For 
example, a cone with a tip, such as Fig. 3.3. If the last layer slice is located inside the 
solid, i.e., the thin layer of the model is lost, which results in the model decreasing the 
dimensional accuracy of ∆l in the tangent direction; if the last layer slice is located 
outside the solid, i.e., the thin layer of the model is exaggeratedly expressed, which 
results in the model increasing the dimensional accuracy of ∆t − ∆l in the tangent 
direction increases the dimensional accuracy of ∆t − ∆l.
Step error: When the model is layered, the shape profile of the model consists of 
two tangent layers, and since the horizontal surface profiles of the upper and lower 
tangent layers are not the same, the surface profile of the model must be replaced 
by the column surface profile, as in Fig. 3.4. The surface accuracy error caused by 
3D printing process is related to the normal direction of the solid surface, radius of 
curvature and the thickness of the layered surface, which can be improved by reducing 
the thickness of the layered surface and optimizing the manufacturing direction. In 
3D printing, the surface accuracy of the part can be improved by reducing the layer 
thickness and optimizing the manufacturing direction. However, the shape of the 
aircraft model is complex, especially the wing part of the aircraft, and the accuracy 
requirements of different parts are different. In addition, the resin printing process 
mainly relies on the polymerization chemical reaction of monomer molecules, the 
resin inevitably produces volume shrinkage [35], especially with the metal skeleton3.2 Additive Manufacturing Process for Wind Tunnel Test Models 53
Fig. 3.3 Stratification error
with holes, slots and other structures, shrinkage size is large, so it is also necessary to 
offset compensation design for such structures. The offset compensation should be 
combined with the actual size of the skeleton to make fine adjustments as appropriate. 
For example, the tip of the head, its thin tip part is likely to cause the loss 
of processing features due to the influence of 3D printing manufacturing process, 
forming a certain curvature of rounded corners in the printing process, which not only 
changes the shape characteristics of the head, but also reduces the length size of the
Fig. 3.4 Step error CAD model 
Actual model 54 3 Process Basis of Additive Manufacturing for Wind Tunnel Test Models
head along the x-axis, so the shape characteristics of the tip part of the head are shifted 
outward in the design, which can not only compensate for the processing errors of 
3D printing, but also offset the model. The amount of post-processing resharpening, 
as shown in Fig. 3.5. As shown in Fig. 3.5, the front end of the head is selected to be 
5 mm and offset by 0.2 mm. 
For example, the front flap of the wing, because its wing section is printed at an 
angle of 50°, the step effect causes the leading edge of the flap to have a certain 
dimensional contraction in the horizontal plane direction, in order to ensure the 
dimensional accuracy of the leading edge we offset the leading edge outward by 
0.2 mm, as shown in Fig. 3.6. 
For example, the nose, front fuselage, left and right wings and tail parts, the inner 
diameter value and the metal skeleton outer diameter value generally have a gap of 
0.4 mm. Since the metal skeleton outer diameter value is slightly reduced, the offset

δ1 = 0.3 mm is taken in the resin inner diameter compensation design, as shown 
in Fig. 3.7. In addition, the deviation at different plate thicknesses after processing 
of the wing plate is also different, so the deviation of the resin should be adjusted 
accordingly, as shown in Fig. 3.7. As shown in Fig. 3.8, the offset of the flat plate 
is generally taken as δ2 = 0.25 mm, the offset of the upper surface of the flat plate 
at 6 mm plate thickness is taken as δ3 = 0.35 mm, and the offset of 4 mm plate 
thickness is taken as δ4 = 0.3 mm.

3.2.2 Print Process Selection 
1) Print direction determination 
In 3D printing manufacturing, the printing direction of the part has a greater impact 
on the printing accuracy of the part [36], especially the aircraft model requires high 
printing accuracy on its surface. In order to minimize the impact of the step effect on 
the manufacturing accuracy of the model surface, different resin parts should choose 
different printing directions. 
As shown in Fig. 3.9, the printing direction of the resin nose, front fuselage, wings 
and tail is chosen in the direction of the longitudinal axis of the model, which can 
ensure the manufacturing accuracy of the surface of the model shape and make the 
flow of the fuselage shape consistent, and also ensure the manufacturing accuracy 
of the inner axis holes of the model, and ensure the assembly accuracy of the resin 
nose, front fuselage, wings and tail with the metal skeleton. 
As shown in Fig. 3.10, the print direction of the model’s maneuvering surfaces 
have to be set carefully. In the force measurement model, the leading and trailing 
edges of the maneuvering surfaces are the key parts that have a large impact on the 
aerodynamic performance. In order to maximize the shape accuracy of the edges, 
the printing direction of each maneuvering surface is generally set to the direction 
of the wingspan. For example, the front flap, aileron and rear flap in the main wing 
are printed along the wingspan direction of the main wing, while the flat tail model 
and rudder model are printed along their wingspan direction respectively.
2) Support structure design 
In the light-curing printing process, the support structure can be considered as a 
tooling central tool that is manufactured at the same time as the prototype part in 
order to ensure the precise positioning of the prototype part relative to the machining

system during manufacturing, while isolated contours and cantilevered contours in 
the part also need to be positioned by the support structure. In addition, supports 
must be added to the bottom of the printed part in order to make it easy to separate 
the print from the table without damaging the part. Supports can be divided into cross 
supports (is one of the most common support methods for general features and areas 
of internal filling), polygonal supports (with better stability and strength), oblique 
supports (cantilever supports for cantilever structures), hand-painted support whisk 
(generate supports as needed). The design principles of supports are as follows: 
(1) To ensure the printing accuracy and print stability under the premise of 
minimizing the support added area; 
(2) Adding auxiliary support to balance shrinkage stress and reduce part deforma￾tion; 
(3) The support should be easy to remove and reduce the breakage of the part 
surface. 
Figure 3.10a shows, the support of the model front flap, aileron, rear flap, flat 
tail and rudder are chosen on their assembly surfaces, and the assembly surfaces are 
all flat, which ensures the shape accuracy of the edges of each maneuvering surface 
and facilitates the post-processing repair of the assembly surfaces. For the long and 
thin parts such as the front flap, when processing and manufacturing in the printing 
direction along the vertical wing span, the front flap is easy to produce the arch 
deformation along the wing span due to the resin shrinkage stress, thus changing the58 3 Process Basis of Additive Manufacturing for Wind Tunnel Test Models
leading edge shape characteristics of the model. In order to reduce the processing 
deformation of such parts, a symmetrical combination of layout is used, and auxiliary 
supports are added to the parts that are prone to deformation or larger deformation. 
As Fig. 3.10b shows, two front flap parts are laid out symmetrically, and auxiliary 
support is added between the mating surfaces of the variable angle piece, so that the 
two machined parts are combined into one machined part, which relatively increases 
the stiffness of the front flap and reduces the machining deformation of the parts. 
3) Layout design 
As mentioned above, 3D printing can significantly reduce the manufacturing time of 
wind tunnel test models compared to traditional machining manufacturing methods. 
Nevertheless, due to the size of the part and the efficiency of 3D printing, the manu￾facturing time for most models can exceed a dozen hours, with tens of hours or even 
days for larger parts (e.g., meter-scale). Taking the light-curing 3D printing process 
as an example, the manufacturing time is mainly reflected in the laser scanning time, 
squeegee movement, pallet lift and liquid level stabilization assisted manufacturing 
time. In the auxiliary time, there is no actual part manufacturing, and the auxiliary 
time of one part and multiple parts is basically similar, which can reduce the manu￾facturing time by multiple parts manufacturing [37]. Aircraft models require high 
form accuracy, so the printing direction of model parts is often chosen to cut the 
direction with the largest number of layers, and the increase in the number of layers 
inevitably increases the overall manufacturing time. 
The manufacturing of the aircraft model should be made with the highest goal of 
manufacturing accuracy and the secondary goal of reducing the manufacturing time 
of the model, and the grouping and layout of the model should be developed. The 
aircraft model can be divided into fuselage shape part, wing shape part and maneu￾vering surface part according to the similarity of the model. Within the processing 
range allowed by the printer, the similar model parts are best printed together, using 
the same scanning speed, layering thickness and other process parameters to form 
similar processing errors. The resin parts of this model were manufactured in three 
stages: 
(1) The fuselage shape part: nose, front fuselage, tail; 
(2) Wing profile part: left and right wings; 
(3) Maneuvering surface parts: left and right 0° front flaps, left and right 24° front 
flaps, left and right rear flaps, left and right ailerons, left and right flat tails, left 
and right hang-ups and rudders. 
3.2.3 Manufacturing and Post-processing 
The model is manufactured using the SPS600B light-curing printer developed inde￾pendently by Xi’an Jiaotong University. The printing range is 600 mm × 600 mm ×
450 mm, and the printing accuracy is ± 0.1 mm. The main process parameters are 
described in Chap. 1.3.2 Additive Manufacturing Process for Wind Tunnel Test Models 59
Fig. 3.11 Resin wing 
processed in the printer 
Figure 3.11 shows the finished resin wing processed in the printer. After the resin 
part is manufactured, it needs to be raised and removed from the liquid photosensitive 
resin tank, in which the surface will adsorb liquid resin, which will not only destroy 
the surface finish of the part after curing, but also may lead to dimensional and shape 
errors of the part. Therefore, when the part is manufactured and the pallet is raised, it 
should wait for a period of time before removing it, so that the liquid resin adsorbed 
on the surface of the part can flow back into the resin tank and also save Resin. Parts 
must be cleaned in time after removal to avoid curing of the adsorbed resin on the 
part surface. Use other tools such as a razor blade to strip the support from the part 
while cleaning it with alcohol, and then sand it afterwards. 
3.2.4 Model Testing 
For 3D printed and assembled resin parts, the structural integrity and aerodynamic 
profile smoothness are first checked by observation after gap filling (e.g. putty) 
and surface treatment (e.g. sandpaper sanding). For more demanding models, the 
dimensional accuracy and surface roughness should also be checked.60 3 Process Basis of Additive Manufacturing for Wind Tunnel Test Models
According to the requirements of GJB 180A-2006 A “Low-speed wind tunnel 
aircraft model design specification” [4], the accuracy of the fuselage is required as 
follows 
(1) The error between the head surface of the fuselage and the reference is not more 
than 0.08 mm; 
(2) The error of other parts of the body and the benchmark is not more than 0.1 mm; 
(3) Length: ± 1.0 mm. 
3.3 3D Printing Error Analysis and Compensation 
Wind tunnel test models especially need to ensure the aerodynamic shape, so there are 
high requirements for surface errors, and the step effect and model post-processing 
when using 3D printing manufacturing will have a significant impact on the surface 
quality, but certain corrections can be made in the design to minimize the corre￾sponding errors. Therefore, the design for 3D printed manufacturing can make struc￾tural corrections and design compensation for the surface errors caused by the step 
effect and the foreseeable post-processing errors. 
3.3.1 3D Printing Related Error Analysis 
1) Layered processing error analysis 
Since 3D printing is a manufacturing method based on the principle of material accu￾mulation, that is, the 3D entity is discrete in the direction of material accumulation 
into a finite number of cut layers with thickness. After the layering process, the orig￾inal continuous surface of the model in the layering direction is discrete. As a result 
of layering, only the contour information and solid information of each slice layer 
are obtained, while the outer contour surface information of two adjacent slice layers 
is lost, which is an approximate representation method. The thickness of the layers 
indicates the resolution of the model expressed after discretization, and the larger 
the thickness of the layers, the lower the resolution, the more information is lost, 
and the greater the error generated by the printing process. In particular, the surface 
inclined relative to the printing direction and the surface shape, due to the presence 
of the step effect, makes the surface accuracy significantly reduced, in addition, the 
step effect is also a factor that causes post-processing errors. 
Currently in 3D printing technology, the indicators for evaluating the degree of 
step effect are generally ε and δ [24]. As shown in Fig. 3.12 ε is the maximum 
distance between the layer-piece stacked boundary and the original boundary of 
the CAD model; δ is the maximum distance between the original boundary of the 
CAD model and the boundary of the layer-piece stacked solid measured along the 
direction of the surface normal vector of the CAD model. ε value can better describe3.3 3D Printing Error Analysis and Compensation 61

diagram of step effect error 
the volume error of the solid, while δ value can better correspond to the surface 
roughness of the solid. Let the total number of solid layers be n, then max ∑n 
i=1 εi 
and max ∑n 
i=1 δi characterizes the maximum volume error and surface roughness of 
the part, respectively. 
Let the radius of curvature of the wind tunnel test model surface at a point on the 
surface of the current layered height entity be R. For convenience, the radius of the 
contour arc between the current layered thicknesses can be approximated as equal 
to R. Let the angle between the normal vector at the beginning of the arc and the 
stacking plane be α, the angle between the normal vector at the end and the stacking 
plane be β, and the layered thickness be t, as in Fig. 3.12 shown, then:

2 = t. That is, the maximum 
distance between the CAD model surface and the solid boundary along the direction 
normal to the solid surface at this time is the delamination thickness.62 3 Process Basis of Additive Manufacturing for Wind Tunnel Test Models
It can be seen that the profile accuracy errors generated by the 3D printing process 
are related to the normal direction of the solid surface, the radius of curvature, and 
the layered thickness. 
1) Post-processing error 
After the printed workpiece is removed from the printer, it needs to be stripped of 
its support structure, and in some cases, post-curing, repairing, grinding, polishing 
and surface treatment, which are collectively referred to as post-processing. In this 
process, if not handled properly will affect the size and shape accuracy of the proto￾type, resulting in post-processing errors. Post-processing can be divided into the 
following two types: 
(1) Post-processing to improve surface quality: After the workpiece is printed, not 
only does it need to be removed from the support, but it also needs to be repaired, 
sanded and polished, for example, the surface of the part is not smooth, and there 
are small steps and defects on the surface caused by layered manufacturing. 
(2) Post-treatment to improve surface properties: The surface condition and 
mechanical strength of the parts are not fully satisfied with the requirements 
of the final product, and the workpiece may continue to deform and cause errors 
due to changes in temperature, humidity and other environmental conditions 
or the influence of printing residual stress. The surface color of the product 
can be changed or its strength and other properties can be improved by surface 
coating. The electrodeposition manufacturing described later in this book can 
also be considered as a post-treatment process. 
3.3.2 Offset Compensation Design for 3D Printing 
Different placement angles when 3D printing will result in different types of surfaces 
at different locations on the model. Upward horizontal surfaces do not produce a step 
effect and do not require support; downward horizontal surfaces do not produce a 
step effect, but the larger the total area of such a surface, the greater the likelihood 
that support will be required or the more support will be needed; upward sloping 
surfaces produce a step effect and do not require support; downward sloping surfaces 
produce a step effect and may or may not require support, depending on the overall 
shape of the surface Whether support is needed depends on the overall shape of the 
surrounding; vertical surface does not produce a step effect, and generally does not 
require support; near-vertical surface produces a small step effect, and generally does 
not require support. 
As different surfaces have different errors, the step effect formed by the upward 
sloping surface makes the actual model present a decrease in material compared with 
the theoretical model, i.e., the error is negative deviation; while the downward sloping 
surface presents an increase in cured material, i.e., the error is positive deviation. The 
shape of aircraft wind tunnel test models are curved design, especially the wing has a 
great impact on the aerodynamic performance, so the shape of the wing processing to3.3 3D Printing Error Analysis and Compensation 63
ensure a high degree of accuracy. Generally 3D printing manufacturing single parts 
in order to save printing time, the parts and the horizontal plane into a conventional 
10°–30° printing, such as Fig. 3.13. Wing design generally has a chord plane will be 
divided into the shape of the upper and lower airfoil, the upper and lower surfaces 
show different error direction, making the overall wing surface deviation, and step 
effect error is larger, will increase the post-processing error, should be upward sloping 
surface for some design compensation. As shown in Fig. 3.14, if the wing is printed 
at an angle of 30° from the horizontal, the angle between the normal and vertical 
directions of the surface is slightly less than 30°, and the error δ is about 0.8t. The 
model obtained by processing the upper surface after offsetting it by 0.8t will be 
close to the theoretical boundary after removing the step effect. 
When 3D printing, the use of different machining directions creates different 
form positions and thus different accuracy requirements. Because different models 
and different parts on the same model also have different accuracy requirements. 
Generally, high-speed aircraft have higher requirements than low-speed aircraft; wing 
parts have higher requirements than fuselage-type parts on the same aircraft; the 
part before the maximum section has higher requirements than the part after the 
maximum section on the same part. The printing direction of the model can be 
divided or arranged according to the accuracy requirements of different parts, and 
the wind tunnel test model can be designed with certain compensation by combining 
different printing directions. If the processing is done along the wing span direction 
in 3D printing, so that the surface of the wing forms an upward approximated vertical 
surface when 3D printing, as Fig. 3.15 shown, the surface accuracy of the model can

be improved. In addition, the printing errors of each key surface are in the same 
direction with negative deviation, which facilitates the overall offset compensation. 
However, in the wing tip due to the transition from horizontal to vertical curvature 
direction, a larger step effect will be generated, and the local enlargement of this part 
can provide a corresponding ε offset to the cut layer profile, forming a better form 
of error compensation, which is calculated schematically as shown in Fig. 3.16. If 
the offset compensation has been designed for the overall model so that the model 
tends to have positive deviation in general, the amount of grinding in the curvature 
transition area can be properly controlled in the post-processing process to form a 
better surface quality and profile accuracy. 
The thin-tip feature or even zero-thickness area is commonly found in the wings 
of aircraft wind tunnel test models, and the thin-tip part of its tail is likely to be lost 
due to the influence of 3D printing manufacturing process, or the wing tip forms a 
jagged shape instead of a straight line, so in order to maintain the thin-tip feature, 
the offset design cannot only compensate the error caused by the step effect, but 
also should increase some compensation amount for the linear feature formed by the 
trimmed wing tip. Therefore, it is necessary to cut the wing tip of the revised model 
to a position that tends to the theoretical line to ensure the position control when 
resharpening, as shown in Fig. 3.17.
In the design of the model, the maximum volume error of the upward sloping 
surface can be compensated by local offset. As the post-processing removal of the 
support and step effect still needs to smooth the grinding amount of the model surface, 
it is necessary to set aside about 0.1 mm for grinding. The metal wind tunnel test 
model is generally reserved with 0.1 mm margin. The resin model is easier to operate 
than the metal one, so a larger amount of grinding can be reserved to give a freer3.3 3D Printing Error Analysis and Compensation 65

compensation schematic
margin for post-processing, so for 3D printing, the surface offset compensation value 
is about 0.3–0.5 mm. The design of the model compensation can be considered during 
the design of the wind tunnel test model, as well as the design of the CAD surface 
or the appropriate editing of the converted STL wind tunnel test model. 
1) CAD Offset Design 
Different surfaces have different spatial structures and different connection methods 
(point continuity, slope continuity, curvature continuity) between surfaces, while 
different thicknesses and different directions also produce different offset effects, 
and different methods can be used for offset design of CAD surfaces. The offset 
compensation direction for 3D printing manufacturing faces outward along the curva￾ture direction to compensate for the missing model caused by the step utility, and 
the offset thickness is very little, about 0.3–0.5 mm, so it is feasible to modify the 
CAD model directly. It is possible to first merge (Join) multiple surface pieces into 
a composite surface, where the surfaces must be connected, and then thicken them 
together (Thick Surface). In case of failure to thicken the surface due to gaps, sharp 
corners, or too small transition rounding, the quality of the surface can be checked and66 3 Process Basis of Additive Manufacturing for Wind Tunnel Test Models

the surface can be repaired using the HA (Healing Assistant) module before thick￾ening, or the group of surfaces with good continuity can be extrapolated, trimmed, 
and sewn together. The surface composition of the wind tunnel test model is usually 
the aerodynamic profile and assembly combination plane, which can be compensated 
separately by offset and then synthesized into a solid by Boolean operation. 
2) STL Offset Design 
If the CAD model is not corrected, the STL model can be manipulated for offset 
compensation design. The STL 3D printing (STL Rapid Prototyping) module in 
CATIA V5 software provides advanced tools to improve mesh quality by removing 
or reorganizing triangular cells, filling holes and re-meshing the mesh in whole or 
in part. STL files can be generated quickly and accurately by partitioning CAD data 
into meshes; existing STL files can be imported to display the mesh and analyze its 
quality; trace offset meshes can be generated as solids and the mesh can be partitioned 
and merged; the generated mesh can be exported as a standard binary STL file to be 
provided to 3D printers. The generated mesh can be exported to a standard binary 
STL file to be provided to the 3D printer. Also, common data pre-processing software 
for 3D printing such as Magics RP can edit the STL for compensation design.3.3 3D Printing Error Analysis and Compensation 67
3.3.3 Electrodeposition-Oriented Model Correction Design 
1) Necessity of electrodeposition manufacturing of resin models 
Under normal circumstances, the wind tunnel test model is transported from the 
manufacturing unit to the test unit for testing, and the use of the wind tunnel test 
model should consider the storage and transportation of the model. When designing 
the model, the corresponding packing box must be designed, and the number and 
volume of the packing box should be decided according to the specific situation of the 
disassembled parts of the model. The model parts should be placed in such a way that 
the deformation of the parts in the storage and transportation process is minimized, 
and in order to prevent the model from being damaged in the transportation and 
handling process, the model in the packing box should be protected from moisture 
and rust. In addition, the front surface of the model may be scarred due to the impact 
of dust particles in the air after long-term use. 
Since the resin models obtained by 3D printing are non-conductive, non-thermally 
conductive, non-abrasive, easily deformable, non-pollution resistant and lacking 
metallic luster, thus limiting the scope of use to some extent, electrodeposition 
is considered to improve the limitations of resin models. Electrodeposition is the 
process of electrochemically reducing metal compounds to metal on the surface of 
metallic and non-metallic models and forming a smooth and dense metal layer that 
meets the requirements of. The desired layer thickness can be obtained by control￾ling the process conditions (plating time, current density, etc.) during electrodepo￾sition. If a layer of metal is plated on the resin, its serviceability can be greatly 
improved, increasing functionality on the one hand and protection on the other. The 
main advantages are as follows: 
(1) Improving the hardness, stiffness, strength and other properties of the resin 
model surface; 
(2) To make resin models with wear resistance and electrical conductivity and high 
temperature oxidation resistance, etc., to extend their service life; 
(3) To make the resin model highly stable to external factors such as light and 
atmosphere, which can prevent aging; 
(4) Make the resin model surface with metallic luster, beautiful and not easy to 
contaminate. 
2) Model design of resin electrodeposition 
The simpler the shape of the model to be electrodeposited, the better. The geometry 
of the model will have a great impact on the quality of the plating, so the model 
should be designed with some attention to the following issues: 
(1) To avoid the use of large surface plane. Use a slightly curved shape with a 
surface designed to be arched with a central arch.68 3 Process Basis of Additive Manufacturing for Wind Tunnel Test Models
(2) To avoid right angles and sharp corners. Angular parts are prone to local current 
density increase, plating thickening and easy to cause nodular phenomenon. 
Therefore, the square profile is changed to curved profile as far as possible, or 
transition with rounded corners. 
(3) Do not have too deep blind holes. These parts are not only difficult to plating, but 
also easy to contaminate the solution of the next process with residual solution. 
The bottom of deep holes or non-cylindrical deep cavities should be designed 
as spherical, with small drainage holes in the middle and upper part to make the 
plating solution circulate, which is conducive to uniform plating. Narrow and 
slender holes should be changed into through holes as far as possible, which may 
not necessarily form a plating layer, but facilitate the cleaning of the aperture 
after plating. 
(4) The thickness should not be too thin, and there should not be sudden changes. 
Too thin parts are easily deformed by heat or plating stress during the plating 
process; sudden changes in thickness are likely to cause stress concentration, 
and generally speaking, the thickness difference should not exceed twice. 
(5) Leave the necessary plating process holes. Easy to load and unload conductive 
fixture, easy to hang on the plating tank cathode, and have a large conductive 
contact surface. Hanging position is designed in the part that does not affect the 
appearance, and pay attention to prevent the deformation of thin-walled parts. 
The shape of the aircraft is characterized by a streamlined curved shape, and the 
unfavorable shape for electrodeposition mainly lies in the corners of the assembly 
parts, the wingtips of each maneuvering surface and the pressure measurement micro￾apertures on the pressure measurement model. The corners can be rounded transition, 
the wingtip parts and the pressure measurement micro-aperture channel should be 
designed and retained in conjunction with the process to avoid affecting the aerody￾namic performance. Since the plating layer has a certain thickness, after the surface 
treatment of the parts, it will inevitably cause changes in the dimensions of the parts. 
Usually the model dimensions and tolerances specified on the design drawings refer 
to the final dimensions and tolerances of the model before plating, and the thick￾ness of the plating and the dimensional deviation of its plating should be reserved 
in advance in conjunction with the final dimensions. Thus the relationship between 
the assembly interface is not only with twice the deposition thickness, there is also 
the influence of the assembly error, and the model offset should be considered as 
a whole when designing. The general electrodeposition thickness is 0.1–0.2 mm, 
and the 3D printing oriented shape offset compensation is 0.3–0.5 mm, then the 3D 
printing based electrodeposition offset compensation is about 0.1–0.4 mm.Chapter 4

4.1 Manufacturing Requirements for Wind Tunnel Test 
Models 
4.1.1 Machining Accuracy and Surface Roughness 
Requirements 
Since the model and the real object must be geometrically similar, the shape of the 
model must be precisely controlled when machining it. Usually, the shape of the 
model is mostly curved, and the existing method to ensure the machining accuracy 
is through the prototype. The location and number of samples are determined by 
the complexity of the model shape. Generally speaking, the curvature of the large 
changes in the place to take a few more samples, the small changes in the place 
can be appropriate to take less. The allowable error of the model shape size varies 
with the model size, while the angle deviation is not affected by the model size. For 
the 4 m × 3 m magnitude of the low-speed wind tunnel test model of the sample 
plate and its parts of the machining accuracy and surface roughness is determined 
according to the following requirements. For the rest of the wind tunnel, the design 
tolerances of the model components can be appropriately scaled according to the 
data determined by the above principles. For example, for the wind tunnel of 8 m 
× 6 m scale, the data other than the angular tolerance can be scaled by 3 times of 
the root. For the standard calibration model, the design tolerance of each component 
should be slightly higher than the data provided above. The design tolerance of each 
part of the model is shown in Table 4.1. The requirements of surface roughness of 
each part of the model are shown in Table 4.2.
To ensure the required dimensional accuracy, wind tunnel test models are usually 
machined by high-precision CNC machine tools [2]. The above requirements for 
design tolerances, surface roughness, etc. are also applicable to wind tunnel test 
models Manufactured by additive manufacturing technology.

4.1.2 Strength and Stiffness Calibration Requirements 
The model design must be calibrated for strength and stiffness. 
The safety factor for the strength check calculation is taken as 3, mainly checking 
the roots of the wing and tail, the pivot and fixed parts of the maneuvering surface 
and the connecting parts of the front and rear pivot points of the model. Especially 
for the wings with large span ratio and the wings tested under higher wind speed, 
the strength problem is most prominent [1]. 
The requirement for stiffness check is to add static maximum aerodynamic load to 
at least 5 profiles based on the exposed wing half-wingspan, with the load distribution 
according to GJB67.2-85 “Strength and Stiffness Specification for Military Aircraft”, 
and calculate the resulting airfoil deformation with the following limits [2]: 
(1) Low-speed wind tunnel test model: the distance between the deflection of the 
wing tip and the horizontal reference plane of the wing tip is not more than 
15 mm (for the 3 m magnitude of the low-speed wind tunnel test model); 
(2) High-speed wind tunnel test model: ➀ wing surface wing tip and wing root 
relative deflection: delta wing not more than 0.1°, swept-back wing not more 
than 0.3°; ➁ deformation of the upper (lower) counter angle of the wing surface: 
delta wing not more than 0.2°, swept-back wing not more than 0.5°; ➂ defor￾mation of the rudder deflection: delta wing and swept-back wing are not more 
than 0.1°. 
Under high speed wind tunnel high speed pressure experimental conditions, the 
deformation of the model often exceeds the above limits. In order to obtain accurate 
experimental data, the deformation of the model is usually measured by optical 
instruments and the experimental data are corrected. Some wind tunnels measure 
(or calculate) the model deformation to improve the accuracy of the experimental 
data, even when the above deformation limits are not exceeded, and correct the 
experimental data. 
4.2 Evaluation of Model Manufacturing Accuracy 
4.2.1 Surface Roughness Analysis 
Surface roughness is an important indicator to measure the surface processing accu￾racy of the parts, the surface roughness of the parts will affect the two matching parts 
have contact surface friction, wear and tear of the moving surface, the sealing of the 
fitting surface, the working accuracy of the mating surface, the fatigue strength of 
the rotating parts, the beauty of the parts, etc., and even the corrosion resistance of 
the parts surface have an impact. 
The effect of the surface roughness of the wind tunnel test model on the experi￾mental data is related to the type and size of the roughness and the local boundary72 4 Inspection Techniques of Wind Tunnel Test Models Based on Additive …
layer state of the model [2]. In general, when the height of the roughness is less 
than the thickness of the bottom layer of the local turbulent boundary layer laminar 
flow, the roughness has no effect on the experimental data, i.e., the experimental data 
measured at such a roughness is the same as that measured on the smooth model 
surface. On the contrary, it has an effect. In general, the surface roughness mainly 
affects the model resistance; at sub and supersonic velocities, it mainly affects the 
frictional resistance and differential pressure resistance of the model; at transonic 
velocities, there are excitation waves on the model surface, and the mutual inter￾ference between the excitation waves and the boundary layer leads to a significant 
effect of the rent roughness on the wave resistance. When there is strong interference 
between the surge and the boundary layer and airflow separation occurs, the magni￾tude of roughness also changes the model pressure distribution, which has an effect 
on lift and moment. When large head-on angle experiments are performed, the size 
of the rent roughness changes the head-on angle at which the model appears asym￾metric vortices, leading to an effect on the cross-side aerodynamic characteristics 
from the surface. 
This book uses the surface roughness meter TR240 to measure the surface rough￾ness of resin model before and after regrinding and the surface roughness of elec￾trodeposited copper-nickel, the roughness measurement curve schematic diagram 
is shown in Fig. 4.1. The average values and the corresponding deviations were 
obtained for the unground resin parts, ground resin parts, electroplated parts with 
copper deposition and electroplated parts with nickel deposition, as shown in Fig. 4.2. 
The surface roughness of the resin part is larger than that of the copper deposited part 
due to the step effect, while the roughness of the reground resin and electrodeposited 
part is very small, and the surface roughness of the nickel deposited part is better 
than that of the copper deposited part due to the extremely fine crystallization of 
nickel, with a Ra value of 1.48 μm. It can be seen that the simplicity and conve￾nience of resin model surface treatment is particularly suitable for wind tunnel test 
model fabrication where only aerodynamic profile surface is required.

4.2.2 Manufacturing Accuracy Analysis 
In order to obtain the influence of 3D printing process and electrodeposition process 
on the surface shape, a surface shape is designed as an accuracy test piece, and this 
model is used to analyze the influence of the manufacturing process on the accuracy 
of the surface shape, and to propose further manufacturing optimization methods for 
the 3D printing of the wind tunnel test model. 
As Fig. 4.3 shown, the obvious step effect is visible through the 3D printing 
process. After the resin model was resharpened to form a smooth surface, and then 
the resin model was shielded and protected in all planes, and only the surface of 
the surface was given electrodeposited nickel. The surface data of the model was 
obtained through the LSH 3D laser measurement system (measurement accuracy: 
± 0.05 mm), and the resharpened resin surface and the surface after electrodeposi￾tion were measured separately. The point cloud data was processed in CATIA V5 
software. The point cloud was imported in the Digitized Shape Editor module and 
the cluttered and useless points were removed. Since the coordinate system where 
the point cloud is measured does not correspond to the coordinate system of the 
theoretical model, another axis system is constructed under the measurement coor￾dinate system so that the point cloud data can be relocated to match the location of 
the theoretical surface. The surface point cloud is separated from each plane point 
cloud, and each plane point cloud is extracted by activating the Basic Surface Recon￾struction command in the Quick Surface Reconstruction module to construct each 
datum. This allows you to optimize the composition of the datum by repeatedly 
building two perpendicular planes. Finally, the data from the measurement coordi￾nate system is converted to the theoretical model coordinate system using Axis To 
Axis, and the point cloud is migrated to the spatial location where the comparison 
can be performed.74 4 Inspection Techniques of Wind Tunnel Test Models Based on Additive …
Fig. 4.3 Flow chart of manufacturing and measurement of surface accuracy test parts 
The distance analysis of the point cloud measurement data before and after the 
resin electrodeposition and the theoretical surface, the overall error distribution is 
shown in Fig. 4.4. From the error distribution cloud, the distance thickness at different 
locations can be visualized, so the 3D measurement can be used as a calibration 
method for the post-processing of the resin wind tunnel test model. The uniformity 
of polishing is detected by inverse measurement, so that the thinner areas can be 
marked for re-polishing. The amount of polishing should be small rather than large 
so as not to over polish some areas and make it difficult to coordinate the overall 
repair. Figure 4.5 shows the results of the percentage distribution of the different 
error ranges. As can be seen from the figure, 96.64% of the point clouds were in the 
error range of − 0.20 to 0 mm in the surface post-processing, and 98.92% of the 
point clouds were in the error range of 0 to 0.20 mm in the surface electrodeposition. 
Considering that the characterization processing accuracy of the 3D printer used is 
± 0.1 mm, it can be seen from the figure that the different processing steps keep the 
accuracy of the model surface well. From the above analysis, we can indirectly get 
the removal amount of step effect is about − 0.1 mm and the thickness of plating is 
about + 0.2 mm. Therefore, in the offset compensation of model design, not only the 
reserved thickness of electrodeposition should be considered, but also the removal 
amount of step effect and surface finishing of 3D printed parts must be considered, 
and the processing amount of different parts will follow the relevant process for 
guidance.4.2 Evaluation of Model Manufacturing Accuracy 75

The model shown in Fig. 4.6 is divided into 19 profiles in the horizontal direction, 
marked as −9~0~9, and the point cloud data on each profile is obtained by using 
Planar Sections in the Digitized Shape Editor module, and the points are successively 
converted into lines by Curve From Scans to obtain the profile lines of the resin 
surface and the nickel deposition surface. In the longitudinal direction, 19 planes 
were also taken to intersect the curve into a finite number of points, and the average 
error between the surface points of resin and the surface points of nickel layer at each 
profile was found and the theoretical profile line, respectively. Similarly, the profile 
contour lines on the midline L1 and diagonal L2 and L3 of the model are extracted, and 
the thickness uniformity of the resin electrodeposition can be specifically analyzed.
In Fig. 4.7, the comparison of the error before and after electrodeposition of each 
profile of the test model shows that the polishing volume is larger on both sides of 
the model when resin polishing, because the curvature changes slowly on both sides76 4 Inspection Techniques of Wind Tunnel Test Models Based on Additive …
Fig. 4.6 Point-line surface 
position markers for error 
analysis
and the volume error of the step effect is larger, and the polishing volume here is 
increased accordingly. In contrast, the error formed by the measured point cloud of 
electrodeposition compared with the theoretical surface is not as obvious on both 
sides of the model as when resin polishing, which makes up for the missing part of 
over-polishing to a certain extent, indicating that a thicker deposited layer is formed 
on both sides of the model. It can be seen that the amount of resin polishing and the 
uniformity of electrodeposition compensate each other to ensure the accuracy of the 
electrodeposited surface. 
Electrodeposition is a process in which the positive and negative ions in the 
plating solution move in a directional manner along the electric power lines under 
the action of external electric field. The ability to make the deposited layer of metal 
deposited uniformly on the uneven surface of the model is called the dispersion 
ability of the plating solution. The factors affecting the dispersion ability are mainly 
geometric and electrochemical factors. Geometric factors mainly refer to the shape of
Fig. 4.7 Comparison of errors before and after electrodeposition for each profile of the test model 4.2 Evaluation of Model Manufacturing Accuracy 77
the plating bath, the shape of the anode, the shape of the part and the mutual position 
and distance between the part and the anode. The elements are tip discharge, edge 
effect, distance of cathode and anode, etc. It mainly affects the current distribution of 
plating. Electrochemical factors include polarization, current density, conductivity 
of the solution, and current efficiency, etc. 
The Z-directional absolute coordinate values of the points on lines L1, L2, and 
L3 were extracted to construct the contour lines of the test surface, and the distance 
between the resin model and the electrodeposition model was enlarged by the coor￾dinate system, as Fig. 4.8. The comparison of the deposited layers of L1, L2, and L3 
are shown respectively. It can be seen that the deposition thickness at the top of the 
model is larger, because the surface of the model faces the anode plate during elec￾trodeposition, and the top surface is closer to the electrode which makes the power 
lines shorter and concentrated. The main surface of the plated part should face the 
anode and be parallel to it, and the distance between different parts of the cathode 
and the anode should be reduced, and if necessary, pictorial anode and auxiliary 
anode should be used to ensure the uniform distribution of power lines. In a certain 
range, increasing the distance between cathode and anode can improve the disper￾sion ability, and theoretically the power line is the best when the plated part is at 
infinity. However, in reality, the distance between the electrodes cannot be increased 
indefinitely, otherwise the width and floor space of the plating tank will increase, and 
the tank voltage will increase and the energy consumption will be high.
The distribution of power lines in the end corner area will be significantly higher, 
from the figure can also be seen on both sides of the model at the edge of the thicker 
plating, especially L2, L3 edge thickness than L1 obvious, because L2, L3 are in the 
intersection of two right-angle edge, while L1 only a right-angle edge. Therefore, to 
prevent the concentration of power lines to produce “edge effect”, the layout of the 
anode should be dense in the middle, sparse on both sides, the two ends of the slot 
to leave a certain empty space, while the cathode rod to hang full. Metal protection 
wire can be hung at the tip of the part to disperse the current on the cathode, this 
metal protection wire is called the protection cathode. 
To obtain a uniform coating, in addition to choosing a reasonable solution compo￾sition and improving the formula, reasonable operation, mounting parts and taking 
some special measures are very important in production, usually using the following 
methods [40]:
(1) Impulse current: Use a current 2–3 times higher than the normal current for a 
short time to impinge on the plating at the beginning of plating. 
(2) reasonable hanging parts: so that the parts in the best current distribution state, 
while not making the precipitation of gas stagnation in the blind holes, low-lying 
parts of the parts. 
(3) Adjust the distance between the cathode and anode according to the possibility, 
and reduce the distance ratio between different parts of the cathode (i.e., the 
concave and convex parts of the part) and the anode. 
(4) Improve current distribution by using “pictorial” anodes.78 4 Inspection Techniques of Wind Tunnel Test Models Based on Additive …

4.3 Evaluation of the Mechanical Properties of Models 
4.3.1 Mechanical Properties Testing of Model Materials 
According to the ISO plastic tensile and bending test standard [41, 42], the relevant 
mechanical experiments were performed and the tensile and bending specimens 
were manufactured as shown in Fig. 4.9. The cross-section of the 3D printed tensile 
specimen is 10 × 4 mm and the cross-section of the bending specimen is 15 ×
6 mm. Different thicknesses were electrodeposited on them, and the properties of 
the resin-metal material with different thicknesses were obtained by experiments 
as shown in Figs. 4.10 and 4.11. The properties of the resin-metal materials with 
different deposited thicknesses are shown in Figs. 4.10 and 4.11. The theoretical 
values of Young’s modulus of the composites in the figures were calculated using 
the prediction equation [43].

Eq 
EL modulus of elasticity of the composite; 
E f the modulus of elasticity of the deposited metal; 
V f volume percentage of metallic material; 
Em modulus of elasticity of the resin matrix. 
As seen in the figure, the stiffness and strength of the composite increased with the 
increase of the deposition thickness. The stiffness strength of the nickel deposition

Fig. 4.10 Strength of resin copper and nickel electrodeposited composites 
Fig. 4.11 Stiffness of resin copper and nickel electrodeposited composites
is greater than that of the copper deposition for the same deposition thickness. The 
actual Young’s modulus of the copper-nickel composite is smaller than the theoretical 
calculated value due to the bond strength at the resin-metal deposition interface. 
Since the accuracy of electrodeposition decreases with the increase of deposition 
thickness, the deposition thickness is taken as 0.1–0.2 mm. Comparing the original 
14120 resin with SL-Ni-0.1 with nickel deposited thickness of 0.1 mm, the tensile 
strength increased from 45.7 to 89 MPa, the elastic modulus increased from 2.5 to 
10 GPa, the bending strength increased from 68.9 to 131.6 MPa, and the bending 
modulus increased from 2.3 to 15.4 GPa.4.3 Evaluation of the Mechanical Properties of Models 81
4.3.2 Model Numerical Analysis of the Mechanical 
Properties 
1) The choice of analysis method and analysis software 
Designers often use CFD tools to perform various virtual tests, quickly conduct 
comparative parametric studies and multiple solution screening, so that only a small 
number of design solutions that do have practical applications need to be wind-tunnel 
tested. Wind tunnel tests and CFD methods are two complementary tools in aircraft 
aerodynamic layout design, and the comparison of calculation accuracy with wind 
tunnel tests and test flight results is generally regarded as private property by each 
aircraft company and kept confidential. 
The CFD method mainly analyzes the aerodynamic performance of the aircraft 
shape, while for the actual aircraft model that needs to be manufactured, there exists 
a requirement for mechanical properties, i.e., for strength and stiffness calibration. 
This requires obtaining the surface pressure flow field of the model from CFD and 
analyzing the strength and stiffness of the wind tunnel test model for different mate￾rials and structures under this pressure load. Considering the possible damage in the 
strength of the 3D printed based wind tunnel test model in the dangerous sections 
such as the root of the wing and tail, and the joint part of the maneuvering surface 
deflection, the finite element method is proposed to be used to calibrate the wind 
tunnel test model. The finite element analysis tool can predict the wind tunnel test 
results exactly, so as to check the validity of the wind tunnel test model manufacturing, 
prevent the model from affecting the test accuracy due to the abnormal performance 
during the blowing wind, and avoid the growth of the test cycle and the increase of 
the test cost caused by the rework of the model. 
The selection of loading method is one of the important steps of engineering 
analysis using finite elements. The choice of different loading methods will produce 
different analysis results and thus affect the validity of the analysis results. Commonly 
used approximate loading methods are [44]: 
(1) Compression core concentrated force loading: the loading method is simple, 
but its results do not reflect the location of the real danger point and the 
maximum stress value, and cannot correctly reflect the force and deformation 
of the structure. 
(2) Split-plane force loading: theoretically, split-plane force loading is the most 
approximate simulation of load distribution, but it is more complicated in 
practice. 
(3) Block concentration force loading: the results obtained are very close to those 
obtained by the block surface force loading method, and the operation is very 
simple. 
With the development of finite element analysis technology, the analysis of the 
force deformation of solids in the flow field can be realized more realistically by 
using the method of fluid–solid coupling. The existing fluid–solid coupling software 
is used in the form of ADINA, ANSYS + CFX, FLUENT + MPCCI + ABAQUS,82 4 Inspection Techniques of Wind Tunnel Test Models Based on Additive …
etc. ADINA has a fluid–solid coupling (FSI) solution function that can simulate in 
a single system ADINA the physical phenomenon of complete coupling between 
a fluid and a structure that experiences significant nonlinear response due to large 
deformation, inelasticity, contact and temperature.. A fully coupled fluid–structure 
coupling model means that the deformation of the structure affects the fluid region 
and in turn the forces of the fluid are applied to the structure [45]. 
From a fluid perspective, Navier–Stokes fluids can be non-compressible, slightly 
compressible, low and high velocity compressible [46]. From the structural point 
of view, various structural cell types can be involved in the FSI process supporting 
various material models, supporting various nonlinear physical processes such as 
material failure, cell life and death, structural instability, phase transitions, etc. 
ADINA combines the structural and fluid dynamics equations in a single system 
to obtain a unified set of equations for this system and to solve it. ADINA-FSI is 
unique in that because it offers two different methods, direct FSI coupling and iter￾ative FSI coupling, to solve the coupling between the fluid model and the structural 
model. In both cases, displacement consistency and force balance conditions are 
satisfied at the fluid–structure coupling interface. 
2) Specific steps of fluid–solid coupling analysis 
The parameters used to build the fluid–solid model in ADINA software are shown in 
Table 4.3 where the Poisson’s ratio of the nickel-deposited material is obtained from 
the composite Poisson’s ratio prediction equation at [43]
νL = ν f V f + νm
(
1 − V f
) (4.2) 
Eq 
νL Poisson’s ratio of the composite; 
ν f Poisson’s ratio of the deposited metal; 
V f volume percentage of metallic material; 
νm Poisson’s ratio of the resin matrix. 
The specific setup steps for ADINA fluid–solid coupling analysis are as follows 
[47]:

(4) Start ADINA-FSI, call in the solids and fluids solution dat file, and set the 
appropriate memory size for the calculation. 
(5) Enter the *.por file post-processing and extract the analysis results. 
3) Predictive analysis of the rigidity strength of fluid–solid coupling 
The size of the model is limited by the boundary of the test section of the wind tunnel 
and cannot exceed a certain range, otherwise the boundary has a large impact and it 
is difficult to make accurate corrections; for the three-dimensional large span ratio 
aircraft model, the ratio of the wing span b to the test section width w is generally 
not greater than 0.6 for the high-speed wind tunnel and not greater than 0.7 for the 
low-speed wind tunnel. For the small span ratio aircraft model, depending on the 
experimental angle, the general requirement is b/w ≤ 0.5 [1]. Taking the maximum 
value of the ratio of wing span to test section width 0.7, the distance standard of 
wing tip deflection in the low-speed wind tunnel of 3 m magnitude is converted to a 
smaller angle standard of 0.818°. The wing model designed in this book has a half 
wing span of 210 mm, then the wing tip deflection cannot exceed 3.00 mm. 
The maximum deformation DMX of resin, nickel-deposited resin, and aluminum 
alloy at a wind speed of 100 m/s is shown in Table 4.4. By comparing the relative 
deflection angles of wing tip and wing root, it can be seen that the resin material 
does not meet the low speed requirement, while SL-Ni-0.1 and aluminum alloy both 
meet the requirement, and the deformation of aluminum alloy is very small, and 
the analyzed flow field pressure diagram and wing deformation diagram are shown 
in Figs. 4.13 and 4.14. Therefore, in terms of stiffness requirements, the pure resin 
material cannot be used for the wind tunnel test model with a large span-to-chord 
ratio, and the strength of the model can be improved and the stiffness performance 
can be improved to some extent by depositing metal on the resin surface or by lining 
with metal plates. The following is an analysis of the applicable wind speed range 
only for composites with different thicknesses of nickel layers deposited. 
At the angle of attack of 20°, the maximum stress and maximum deformation of 
Mach number from 0.2 to 0.8 were analyzed, and the stress distribution schematic

is shown in Fig. 4.15. The maximum stress increased from 3.5 to 66.7 MPa, and the 
maximum deformation increased from 0.43 to 4.42 mm, the Figs. 4.16, 4.17 and 4.18 
show the maximum stress and maximum deformation values for depositing 0.1 mm, 
0.15 mm and 0.25 mm nickel layers, respectively. The available blowing data are 
summarized in Table 4.5, that is, if the safety factor is 3, the tensile strength of SL￾Ni-0.10 is 89 MPa to meet the 0.5 Ma requirement; the tensile strength of SL-Ni-0.15 
is 111 MPa to meet the 0.6 Ma requirement; and the tensile strength of SL-Ni-0.25 is 
147 MPa to meet the 0.7 Ma requirement. And the wing tip deformation at these Mach 
numbers is within the range of 3.00 mm, and the materials of different thicknesses 
meet the requirements of both strength and stiffness at the permissible Mach numbers. 
Therefore, the applicable wind speed range of resin-nickel deposited materials can 
cross from low speed to subsonic speed. The higher the wind tunnel test wind speed, 
the higher the model accuracy requirements and stiffness strength requirements. The 
larger the deposition thickness, the higher the stiffness and strength, but the lower 
the deposition accuracy. Therefore, the deposition thickness should be selected to 
meet the stiffness and strength and also to ensure the processing accuracy.4.3 Evaluation of the Mechanical Properties of Models 87

When the Mach number is 0.8–1.4, it has entered the transonic range. Transonic 
region from the aircraft surface at a point of the so-called critical speed of sound 
speed to the entire flow field are supersonic until, is the aircraft surface of the airflow 
both subsonic and supersonic mixed flow area. When the aircraft reaches the critical 
speed, a surge is formed on the surface and develops as the Mach number increases. 
The surge generates wave resistance, which increases the drag force several times 
compared to subsonic velocity. As a result, the lift is reduced, the center of pressure 
is shifted back, the moment changes abruptly, and the aircraft may vibrate or chatter. 
Various instruments will be shaken by the excitation wave. The measures to over￾come the adverse effects of transonic velocity are the use of small span ratio, small 
thickness ratio swept back wing and research on supercritical wing and fuselage 
shaping according to the area law, etc. The composite materials used in the transonic 
wind tunnel test model are to be studied later. 
4.3.3 Reliability Testing of Plastic Model Parts 
The full-mode force measurement test is performed by using a six-component balance 
to measure the aerodynamic forces of the model at a range of attitude angles under a4.3 Evaluation of the Mechanical Properties of Models 89
given dynamic pressure condition. To perform the full-mode force measurement test, 
all subsystems of the wind tunnel are operated in a coordinated manner to keep the test 
dynamic pressure stable and to change the model attitude automatically according 
to the test requirements to achieve accurate and efficient measurement of the model 
aerodynamic force. 
In the force measurement test, when the side slip angle of the model is 0°, the 
measurement under a series of head-on angles is called longitudinal force measure￾ment test; given a certain head-on angle of the model, the measurement under a 
series of side slip angles is called transverse force measurement test; given a certain 
non-zero side slip angle of the model, the measurement under a series of head-on 
angles is called quasi-longitudinal force measurement test; under different dynamic 
pressure conditions, the force measurement of the same model state is called vari￾able Reynolds number test; Multiple repeated measurements of the same model state 
under the same test conditions are called repeatability tests [1]. In order to deduct 
the bracket interference, the bracket interference test is also performed. 
In a low-speed wind tunnel force measurement model for an aircraft design, the 
fuselage is machined in metal and the wing and tail are manufactured by 3D printing. 
The wind tunnel test was conducted in the FL-12 low-speed wind tunnel, and the 
maximum wind speed was up to 100 m/s. By changing the angle of attack to blow 
the wind test and collecting the test data, when the angle of attack was −20° and the 
wind speed accelerated to nearly 70 m/s, the vertical tailplane broke from the root 
of the connection, as shown in Fig. 4.19. The possible causes of this fracture were 
insufficient strength of the resin model on the one hand, and design or manufacturing 
defects of the wind tunnel test model on the other hand. Since the much weaker parts 
of the wing such as the front flap and ailerons were not abnormal, the main cause of the 
tail fracture should originate from the structural defects of the model. For example, 
the interlayer defects introduced during the layer-by-layer 3D printing of the tailplane 
may be the main cause of this fracture. On the one hand, the designers should choose 
the printing direction of the model parts reasonably in the main bearing direction to 
avoid making the model print the maximum load in the interlayer direction; on the 
other hand, the process personnel should reduce the interlayer defects by choosing 
stable raw materials and equipment, optimizing the printing process parameters and 
other measures.90 4 Inspection Techniques of Wind Tunnel Test Models Based on Additive …

Electrodeposition Strengthening 
of Plastic Wind Tunnel Test Models 
Many of the 3D printing materials used for model manufacturing are polymers, such 
as photosensitive resins (light-curing 3D printing) and thermoplastics (melt-extrusion 
3D printing). Compared to metals, the mechanical properties of polymer materials 
are poor. For thin and long parts in wind tunnel test models, such as wings, flaps and 
ailerons, they cannot be strengthened by embedded metals and other means, and other 
strengthening techniques need to be studied. Zhou Zhihua et al. of Xi’an Jiaotong 
University proposed the method of electrodeposition of metals on the surface of resin 
models to improve the mechanical properties and serviceability of the models [29, 
30]. In this chapter, the technology will be introduced, and the influence of resin 
surface electrodeposition process parameters on the surface quality of the model 
will be investigated through process experiments, and the influence of deposition 
thickness and bond strength of resin-metal interface on the mechanical properties 
of composite specimens will be analyzed through mechanical experimental studies, 
and the role and effect of chemical roughening on improving the bond strength of the 
interface will be investigated, and finally the economics of model manufacturing will 
be analyzed with an example of wing pressure measurement model electrodeposition 
manufacturing.

5.1.1 Surface Roughening 
The purpose of roughening is to make the resin surface microscopically rough, so that 
the contact area between the deposited layer and the substrate increases, and also 
to change the resin surface from hydrophobic to hydrophilic, in order to improve 
the bonding force between the resin surface and the deposited layer. The effect of 
roughening treatment has a large impact on the resin-metal interface bond strength 
and its mechanical properties. For the light-curing resin material and wind tunnel 
test model with complex shape, this book selects chemical roughening method as 
its surface roughening treatment method, which has the characteristics of simple 
composition, convenient maintenance, fast roughening speed and good effect. 
5.1.2 Conductivity 
Since the resin wind tunnel test models manufactured by light-curing 3D printing 
are insulators, they cannot be directly electrodeposited and need to be conductive for 
subsequent electrodeposition, which consists of sensitization, activation, reduction 
and chemical deposition processes. The wind tunnel test model requires sufficient 
bonding between the metal and the substrate as well as sufficient coverage, and 
chemical deposition is chosen as the conductive treatment method for the resin model 
in this book. The treatment process of chemical deposition conductivity includes 
cleaning, sensitization, activation, reduction and chemical deposition, which play a 
key role in the quality of the chemically deposited layer. 
5.1.3 Electrodeposition 
After the resin model has been chemically deposited for conductivity, the metal layer 
is thickened using the usual electrodeposition process. The electrodeposition cathode 
is the resin model part to be electrodeposited, and the anode is the metal material5.2 Surface Quality Analysis 93
Fig. 5.2 Schematic diagram of nickel layer thickness measurement 
plate used for electrodeposition. Nickel is chosen as the electrodeposition material 
for the resin surface because of its high strength, high stiffness, easy deposition and 
high hardness and wear resistance. Since this book uses electrodeposition method 
to enhance the resin wind tunnel test model, the deposition thickness is critical 
to the accuracy of the model, so it is necessary to quantify the deposition thick￾ness according to the deposition time. According to Faraday’s law of electrolysis, 
it is known that different deposition thicknesses are obtained for different deposi￾tion times at preset current density conditions. In order to determine the difference 
between the nickel deposition thickness calculation formula and the actual process, 
electrodeposition experiments were taken to verify it. The nickel electrodeposition 
layer thickness was measured by an optical microscope system on an intercepted 
cross-section and averaged over five measurements, as Fig. 5.2 is shown. 
5.2 Surface Quality Analysis 
Model surface quality has a large impact on wind tunnel experimental data, mainly 
related to the type and size of roughness and the state of the local boundary layer of 
the model [2]. Therefore, the surface quality of wind tunnel test models for nickel 
electrodeposition is mainly evaluated by surface roughness measurements and micro￾morphological observations. In this book, a portable surface roughness meter is used 
to measure the surface roughness of resin models before and after regrinding, as well 
as the surface roughness of electrodeposited nickel sulfamate and nickel sulfate.94 5 Electrodeposition Strengthening of Plastic Wind Tunnel Test Models
Fig. 5.3 Comparison of 
average surface roughness 
Ra 
The average values and corresponding deviations were obtained for the unground 
resin parts, the resin parts after custom grinding, the nickel sulfate electrodeposited 
parts and the nickel sulfate electrodeposited parts, and their average surface roughness 
Ra were 4.56 µm, 1.88 µm, 1.63 µm and 1.48 µm, respectively, as shown in Fig. 5.3. 
As seen from the figure, the resin parts will have larger roughness as well as deviation 
due to the step effect, and the roughness of the reground resin and electrodeposited 
sample parts is smaller and related to the degree of regrinding. It was also found 
that the surface roughness of nickel sulfate deposition was better than that of nickel 
sulfamate, with a Ra value of 1.48 µm, while the roughness of resin models depended 
on the degree of regrinding relative to the surface roughness requirement of wind 
tunnel test models. It is particularly suitable for model manufacturing with high 
surface quality requirements. The surface quality for nickel deposition is not only 
related to the degree of regrinding of the resin substrate, but also to the microscopic 
surface state. 
The microscopic surface of the electrodeposited nickel layer was observed using a 
scanning electron microscope, both at a magnification of 5000× as shown in Fig. 5.4. 
Scanning electron micrographs of nickel layer surfaces obtained by electrodeposi￾tion using nickel sulfamate formulation at different current densities Ip. It can be 
seen from the figure that the surface quality of the nickel layers at 2 A dm−2 and 
5 A dm−2 current densities are basically similar and the microscopic surfaces exhibit 
a rhombic vertebral morphology. However, the microscopic surface quality of the 
nickel layer varied greatly when the nickel sulfate formulations were electrodeposited 
at different current densities (2 A dm−2 and 5 A dm−2), with the microstructure 
showing columnar grains at Ip = 2 A dm−2 and finer grains and better surface quality 
when Ip increased to 5 A dm−2, as shown in Fig. 5.5. Therefore, the process condi￾tions of nickel electrodeposition on the surface of resin model with nickel sulfate 
formulation and Ip = 5 A dm−2 were chosen in this book.5.2 Surface Quality Analysis 95

There are many factors affecting the microscopic surface quality of nickel elec￾trodeposited layers. The composition of deposition solution, current density, addi￾tives, DC or pulsed current, PH value, temperature, etc. have effects on the grain 
size and microstructure of electrodeposited layers, while current density is the most 
important control factor affecting the surface microstructure during the preparation 
of crystals by electrodeposition. By changing the current density, not only the speed 
of electrodeposition but also the cathodic overpotential during electrocrystallization 
can be changed, thus affecting the nucleation and growth of crystals. It is found 
that the grain size of electrodeposited nickel layer decreases with increasing current 
density, and the current density reaches a certain range when it is easy to grow and 
form nickel nanocrystals.96 5 Electrodeposition Strengthening of Plastic Wind Tunnel Test Models
In addition, many studies have found that the addition of organic additives to the 
nickel deposition solution can lead to grain refinement. The organic additives added in 
the electrodeposition process are mainly some surface active substances and bright￾ening agents, such as sodium dodecyl sulfate, saccharin and aliphatic hydrocarbons. 
The addition of these organic additives has an obvious blocking effect on the electrode 
reaction, which can increase the cathodic polarization, improve the overpotential of 
electrocrystallization and effectively refine the grains. The mechanism of action of 
sugar refined grains [65] is that the saccharin molecules adsorb on the active point 
of crystal growth during the growth of the deposited layer, which effectively inhibits 
the crystal growth and promotes the formation of nuclei. Moreover, the hydrogen 
precipitation on the cathode surface is more obvious at lower pH value, and hydrogen 
provides more nucleation centers for nickel during the cathodic reduction of nickel 
ions, which makes the deposited layer of nickel crystallize meticulously and the 
grains are refined. 
5.3 Mechanical Properties Study 
5.3.1 Interfacial Bond Strength 
Usually, the bonding strength of electrodeposited layer and substrate is measured by 
bonded tensile method, scratch method, indentation method, wedge loading method 
and so on. Among them, the bonded tensile method is the most commonly used, 
and this book adopts the bonded tensile method and measures the bonding strength 
of resin-nickel layer interface according to ISO-2819 standard. This book uses the 
bonded tensile method test sample diameter of 20 mm, length of 40 mm, the test 
sample and the corresponding sample with AB two-component adhesive bonding 
Instron 1195 universal material testing machine for tensile test, the specimen is 
shown in Fig. 5.6a is the bonded specimen before tensile, (b) is the fracture surface 
of the specimen after tensile. Observation of the fracture surface of the test specimen 
shows that the adhesive bonding agent did not delaminate, which indicates that the 
adhesive bonding strength is higher than the bonding strength of resin and nickel 
layer, and the bonding tensile method can effectively measure its bonding strength.
In order to analyze the effect of chemical roughening method and electrodepo￾sition thickness of resin surface on the interfacial bond strength, the test surface 
of the specimen was roughened according to the chemical roughening process in 
the previous section, and then tensile testing of the resin-Nickel layer interfacial 
bond strength was performed. Figure 5.7 shows the stress–strain curve of the bond 
strength tensile test. As shown in Fig. 5.8, for the same deposited thickness of nickel 
layer, the difference of interfacial bond strength before and after chemical rough￾ening is obvious, and the interfacial bond strength increases more after roughening. 
However, for the resin-nickel interfacial bonding interface after chemical roughening, 
the maximum value of the bonding strength of 11.1 MPa occurred at a nickel layer5.3 Mechanical Properties Study 97
(a) bonded tensile test specimen; (b) typical test specimen fracture surface 
Electrodeposited Chemically plated 
Fig. 5.6 Bond strength test specimens and fracture surfaces
thickness of 0.25 mm, while the maximum value of the bonding strength of 5.3 MPa 
for the resin-nickel interfacial bonding interface without roughening occurred at a 
nickel layer thickness of 0.15 mm. 
This shows that the bond strength does not always increase with increasing thick￾ness of the nickel coating, but decreases with increasing thickness of the deposited 
layer after reaching a maximum value. This is mainly due to the fact that as the thick￾ness of the deposited layer increases, the residual stresses accumulated on the nickel 
deposited layer also increase, resulting in a decrease in the bond strength instead. 
The surface micromorphology of the resin specimens before and after chemical 
roughening and nickel chemical deposition and electrodeposition were observed by 
optical microscopy system (same magnification 1000), as Fig. 5.9 is shown. Among 
them, (a) and (b) show the surface morphology of the resin model before and after

roughening, and (c) and (d) show the surface micromorphology of nickel chemical 
deposition and electrodeposition, respectively. From Fig. 5.9 it can be seen that the 
chemical roughening process on the resin surface is mainly completed by the oxida￾tion of potassium permanganate and chromic acid solution, which results in irregular 
micro-pores and exhibits the form of porous structure. The experimental results show 
that some components of the resin material have been eroded by chemical oxidation 
and formed porous forms in the surface layer. Therefore, the chemically deposited 
metallic nickel subsequently fills these micro-pore structures until the entire resin 
surface is formed with a nickel cover layer, as Fig. 5.9c and d show. The location of the 
mechanical anchor lock between the metal and resin interfaces is mainly present at 
these microstructure pores, thus increasing the bond strength between the interfaces.
The bonding mechanisms between polymeric material surfaces and metal coatings 
can be divided into three main categories: mechanical anchor lock, physical bonding, 
and chemical bonding. Among them, most scholars agree that the mechanical anchor 
lock effect is the main factor for the increase of bond strength between resin and metal 
coatings. Physical and chemical bonding effects are difficult to produce between resin 
and metal coatings, mainly due to the large differences in the physical and chemical 
properties of the respective component materials themselves, making it difficult to 
form good physical and chemical bonding effects. Studies have also shown that the 
surface roughness of the resin matrix material is directly related to the bond strength, 
which means that the bonding mechanism between the resin-metal interface can 
be explained by the mechanical anchor-locking effect. Therefore, the micro-pore 
structure of the resin surface effectively increases the contact surface area between 
metal and resin, resulting in high and effective bond strength.5.3 Mechanical Properties Study 99

5.3.2 Tensile Bending Test 
Since there is no fixed test standard for the mechanical property test of resin-nickel 
layer composite specimens, this book refers to ISO and ASTM plastic tensile and 
bending test standards to conduct relevant mechanical tests. According to ISO-527 
plastic tensile [47, 48] and ISO-178 plastic bending standards [49]. The tensile and 
bending specimens of resin-nickel composite are fabricated as shown in Fig. 5.10.
The total length of the light-cured 3D printed resin tensile specimens was 180 mm, 
and the basic size of the cross-section used for testing was 10 × 4 mm, and the total 
length of the bending specimens was 160 mm, and the basic size of the cross-section 
used for testing was 15 × 4 mm, and both measured their cross-sectional dimensions 
accordingly according to the preset thickness of electrodeposited nickel. A universal 
material testing machine was used for the mechanical property experiments, and the 
average value was taken from three specimens of each test group.100 5 Electrodeposition Strengthening of Plastic Wind Tunnel Test Models

Figure 5.11 shows the stress–strain curves of test specimens for tensile and 
bending experiments. Figure (a) shows the comparison of tensile curves of nickel￾resin composite specimens with pure resin specimens, and Figure (b) shows the 
bending stress–strain curves for different thicknesses of nickel electrodeposition. 
From Fig. 5.11a it can be observed that the stress value of the electrodeposited 
nickel-resin composite specimen is larger than that of the pure resin at the same 
strain (2.5%), indicating that it has a higher strength to carry tensile strength, but it 
fractures immediately after exceeding this strain, showing brittle material properties. 
From Fig. 5.11b a jump in stress can be observed in the middle section of the bending 
test.

Fig. 5.12 Tensile and flexural strength of composite specimens 
The tensile and bending strength curves of the nickel-resin composite specimens 
show that both tensile and bending strengths increase continuously with the increase 
of deposition thickness as shown in Fig. 5.12. The tensile and bending strengths 
of the composite specimens were 89 MPa and 131.6 MPa, respectively, when the 
thickness of nickel deposited was 0.1 mm, which were 1.95 times and 1.91 times 
higher than the tensile strength (45.7 MPa) and bending strength (68.9 MPa) of the 
pure resin material, respectively. When the thickness of nickel layer was 0.5 mm, the 
tensile and flexural strengths of the composite specimens were increased by 4.7 and 
5.9 times, respectively, compared with that of the pure resin material. 
The curves of the tensile and flexural elastic models of the nickel-resin composite 
specimens with the deposition thickness are shown in Fig. 5.13, and it can be seen 
from the figure that the elastic modulus increases with the increase of the deposition 
thickness. When the thickness of nickel deposition is 0.1 mm, the Young’s modulus 
and bending modulus of the composite specimen are 10 GPa and 15.4 GPa respec￾tively, which are 4 times and 6.7 times higher than the Young’s modulus (2.5 GPa) 
and bending strength (2.3 GPa) of the pure resin material. When the thickness of 
nickel layer is 0.5 mm the tensile and flexural modulus of composite specimens are 
increased by 14.5 and 22.3 times, respectively, compared with the pure resin material.
Figure 5.14 shows the macroscopic fracture morphology of the resin-nickel layer. 
Figure 5.15 shows the microscopic fracture pattern of the electrodeposited nickel 
layer. Looking at the fracture of the tensile specimen, it can be seen that the elec￾trodeposited nickel layer exhibits a typical ductile fracture. The fracture of the nickel 
layer under tensile load is macroscopically rough, grayish, fibrous, with a 45° shear 
lip at the edge of the part surface, and its microscopic characteristics are mainly the 
fracture surface consists of some small pits, which are actually grown-up hollow 
nuclei, i.e. tough nests. Tough nest fracture [78] is a ductile fracture belonging to 
a high-energy absorption process, which proceeds through the formation of cavity 
nuclei grown and interconnected. Moreover, the shape of the tough nests after fracture102 5 Electrodeposition Strengthening of Plastic Wind Tunnel Test Models
Fig. 5.13 Tensile and flexural modulus of elasticity of composite specimens
of the electrodeposited nickel layer exhibits round and elliptical shapes of inconsis￾tent size, which grow uniformly around the microscopic cavities under the tensile 
positive stress and form nearly circular isometric tough nests after fracture. Since 
the cured Somos 14120 resin material itself is a toughened brittle material, it mainly 
exhibits brittle fracture during the tensile process. The fracture surface of its brittle 
fracture is close to perpendicular to the tensile stress, and the macroscopic fracture 
mainly consists of crystalline bright surfaces with a glossy finish.

5.3.3 Analysis and Discussion 
1) Effect of interfacial bond strength on mechanical properties 
From the fracture surface of the typical bond strength test specimen in the previous 
section, it can be seen that the interfacial bond layer between the resin matrix and 
the chemically deposited nickel layer does not fall off extensively, but is more tightly 
bonded to the resin matrix, which can indicate that the roughening effect of the resin 
surface is more obvious. The fracture surface produced by the bonding and tensile 
method is mainly at the interface between the chemically deposited nickel layer and 
the electrodeposited nickel layer, and the bond strength stress–strain curve also shows 
that the interface fractures very rapidly. Therefore, the interface between the elec￾trodeposited resin and the nickel layer can be divided into two layers: (a) the interface 
between the resin matrix and the chemically deposited nickel layer; (b) the interface 
between the chemically deposited nickel layer and the electrodeposited nickel layer. 
The interfacial bonding strength between the chemically deposited nickel layer and 
the electrodeposited nickel layer is the main factor affecting the mechanical proper￾ties. The effect of resin-metal interfacial bond strength on mechanical properties is 
mainly manifested in tensile Young’s modulus and bending strength. 
(1) Young’s modulus 
According to the theoretical calculation method of Young’s modulus of composite 
materials, we can get the calculation formula of resin-nickel layer composite 
specimen [50]: 
Ec = Em Vm + Es(1 − Vm) (5.1)104 5 Electrodeposition Strengthening of Plastic Wind Tunnel Test Models
Fig. 5.16 Comparison of 
theoretically calculated and 
experimentally measured 
modulus of elasticity 
Eq 
Ec Young’s modulus of the composite specimen/GPa; 
Em Young’s modulus of electrodeposited nickel/GPa; 
Vm volume percentage of nickel layer/%; 
Es Young’s modulus of resin matrix/GPa. 
The Young’s modulus of the composite specimen was calculated and compared 
with its experimental modulus by Fig. 5.16a, the Young’s modulus of the resin-nickel 
composite specimen measured experimentally is much smaller than the theoretical 
calculated value, mainly because the actual resin-nickel layer interface bond strength 
is lower, while the premise of the theoretical calculation assumes that the resin￾metal interface is completely tightly bonded, and the interface is not affected by 
tensile stress during the tensile process, thus causing the theoretical value of Young’s 
modulus of the composite specimen to be larger than the experimental value. 
(2) Bending performance 
During the bending experiments of composite specimens, the bending stress–strain 
curve appears to jump in the middle section as a typical case. The main reason 
for this may be due to the lower interfacial bond strength of the bending specimen 
and the form of stress jump curve. For the resin-nickel composite specimen, during 
the bending process, the form of force on the specimen is more complex, showing 
the combined effect of compressive stress, shear stress and torsional stress, and the 
interface bonding part is affected by various forms of external forces. The bending 
stress jumps in the middle section may be due to the resin-nickel interface in a variety 
of complex forms of external forces began to detach or fracture, but the external nickel 
layer can still resist the action of bending stress, composite specimen bending stress 
increases with strain, until the nickel layer fracture.5.3 Mechanical Properties Study 105
Moreover, the bending performance of the composite specimens increased more 
significantly than the tensile performance, which is mainly due to the fact that the 
bending test has a greater effect on the interfacial bond strength than the tensile test 
and is related to the cross-sectional area of the specimens. Therefore, the interfacial 
bond strength has a certain effect on both tensile and bending properties of composite 
specimens, and the effect on bending properties is particularly significant. 
2) Effect of nickel volume percentage on mechanical properties 
The volume percentage of the nickel layer Vm is calculated using the formula 
Vm = 2d × (w + h + 2d) 
(h + d) × (w + d) 
× 100% (5.2) 
Eq 
d Nickel layer thickness/mm; 
w Width of resin specimen/mm; 
h height of resin specimen/mm; 
Vm Nickel layer volume percentage/%. 
If w + d = p and h + d = q, the percentage volume of nickel layer V m: 
Vm = 2d × ( p + q) 
p × q
× 100%. (5.3) 
From Eqs. 5.2 and 5.3, it can be seen that for the same thickness of nickel elec￾trodeposited layer, the percentage of nickel layer decreases with the increase of spec￾imen cross-section. The volume percentage of nickel layer is not only related to the 
thickness of nickel layer, but also related to the size of specimen cross section. The 
mechanical properties of the composite specimen mainly depend on the strength 
and stiffness of the nickel layer, so when the thickness of nickel layer is certain, 
the strength and stiffness of the composite specimen mainly depend on the volume 
percentage of the nickel layer, the larger the resin substrate cross-section is, the 
smaller the volume percentage of its nickel layer, the smaller the strength and stiff￾ness of its composite specimen. Therefore, the effect of electrodeposition to improve 
the mechanical properties of the resin wind tunnel test model depends on the thickness 
of the nickel layer and the cross-sectional size of the model part. 
Since the accuracy of electrodeposition decreases with the increase of thickness, 
in order to ensure the accuracy of wind tunnel test model, the thickness of nickel 
layer of resin wind tunnel test model for electrodeposition is generally taken as 0.1– 
0.2 mm. When the thickness of nickel layer is certain, the strength and stiffness 
of resin-nickel layer composite wind tunnel test model mainly depends on the size 
of model cross-section. Therefore, when electrodeposited nickel is used to improve 
the strength and stiffness of the resin wind tunnel test model, the electrodeposition 
method is only applicable to thin wind tunnel test model parts such as wing, aileron, 
flap, tail, etc. with small cross-sectional size.106 5 Electrodeposition Strengthening of Plastic Wind Tunnel Test Models
Moreover, for a given cross-section of the matrix, the mass and stiffness of 
the resin-nickel layer composite specimen increase with the increase of the nickel 
deposited layer. However, if the cross-sectional size and form of the resin matrix are 
changed, the mass and stiffness of the composite are related to the volume percentage 
of each component material, i.e., the material volume composition of the resin and 
nickel layers is related to the mass and stiffness. Therefore, in order to obtain a suitable 
mass distribution and suitable specific stiffness, it is crucial to design the thickness 
and cross-sectional proportional relationship between resin and nickel layers, which 
is relevant for the design and fabrication of dynamically similar wind tunnel test 
models (static aeroelastic, fluttering models) requiring similar mass distribution and 
stiffness. 
5.4 Electrodeposition Wing Pressure Measurement Model 
Manufacturing 
The manufacturing process of composite wing pressure measurement model 
assembly by electrodeposition can be divided into the following steps: (1) modify or 
add wire process holes according to the electrodeposition process requirements; (2) 
compensate the CAD model for inward offset according to the preset electrodeposited 
nickel layer thickness; (3) manufacture the resin model after inward offset using 3D 
printing equipment; (4) rough the model surface; (5) conductive the model surface 
treatment; (6) electrodeposition of high-strength nickel metal of preset thickness. 
As the electrodeposited nickel layer has a certain thickness, after the parts are 
surface treated, it will inevitably cause changes in the dimensions of the parts. Usually 
the model dimensions and tolerances specified on the design drawings refer to the 
final dimensions and tolerances of the model before electrodeposition, and the thick￾ness of the deposited layer and its electrodeposition dimensional deviation should be 
reserved in advance in conjunction with the final dimensions. The assembly surface 
not only has the offset and the deposition thickness as twice, but also has the influ￾ence of the assembly error, and the model offset should be considered as a whole 
when designing. Since the thickness of chemical deposition is generally negligible 
(1–5 µm), the inward offset compensation of 3D printing-based electrodeposition 
is about 0.1–0.2 mm. Chemical deposition has basically 100% dispersion capa￾bility because there is no current distribution on the part, and a uniform thickness of 
deposited layer can be obtained regardless of deep holes, blind holes, deep grooves 
or complex shaped workpieces. Figure 5.17 shows the chemical deposition effect of 
the wing pressure model and the local enlargement of a pressure hole.
The electrodeposition of the nickel layer on the model surface exhibits convexity 
and unevenness due to the effect of the electrolyte dispersion ability under the action 
of external electric field. The geometric factors are the shape of the electrodeposition 
bath, the shape of the anode, the shape of the part and the mutual position and distance 
between the part and the anode, etc. The geometric factors lead to tip discharge and5.4 Electrodeposition Wing Pressure Measurement Model Manufacturing 107

edge effect, which affect the current distribution in the electrodeposition process. 
Electrochemical factors include polarization, current density, conductivity of the 
solution, and current efficiency. Therefore, the following methods are mainly adopted 
to improve the uniformity of the nickel layer during the electrodeposition of the wing 
pressure measurement model: (1) reasonable mounting of the parts, with the main 
surface of the model facing the anode and parallel to it, so that the parts are under the 
best current distribution; (2) adjusting the distance between the cathode and the anode 
according to the possibility, within a certain range, increasing the distance between 
the cathode and the anode to improve the dispersion ability, reducing the distance 
ratio between different parts of the cathode and the anode distance ratio between 
cathodes and anodes; (3) using double anodes to improve the current distribution; 
(4) using cathode shielding to reduce the current density in the concentrated part 
of the power line. Figure 5.18a shows the results of the edge effect of electric field 
distribution due to the formation of the leading edge corners of the wing, Fig. 5.18b 
shows the effect of electrodeposition of the wing model after improving the power 
line distribution by using parallel mounting and double anodes. Figure 5.19 shows 
the before and after electrodeposition effect of the scaled-down model of the whole 
aircraft.

An example of the fabrication of a wing pressure measurement model with nickel 
electrodeposition, after testing the pressure measurement orifice is still conductive 
after electrodeposition, as shown in Fig. 5.20a shows each of the electrodeposited 
parts that make up the wing model. Figure 5.20b is the pressure measurement hole 
on the main wing tip surface. Each front flap, aileron and variator are printed in one 
piece with 0° and ± 20° deflection angles, and the mounting part of the variator is 
embedded inside the wing without destroying the wing shape and assembled by pin 
positioning. As the cross section of the assembly part of the model forms multiple 
layers of electrodeposited nickel after electrodeposition, it is very helpful to increase 
the strength of the assembly connection. Figure 5.20c shows the assembly effect of 
the electrodeposited wing pressure measurement model.

5.5 Model Manufacturing Economics Analysis 
The manufacturing of metal wind tunnel test models by traditional machining 
methods is a complex process, in which the process design process takes a lot of 
time, and the process design time of a domestic set of models accounts for about 
25–30% of the whole production period. Table 5.1 is the typical process flow of 
wing force measurement model. The process is characterized by many processes 
and low efficiency. If we use light-curing 3D printing technology, we only need to 
make certain corrections to the CAD model structure design and data processing to 
enter the printing manufacturing. Light-curing 3D printing makes it very convenient 
to make recesses, convex shoulders and hollow parts of the model without special 
tooling and tool design, and without the preparation of numerous processes and 
processing materials, saving a lot of labor, material and time costs. Moreover, when 
processing slender models such as wings, there is no need to worry about machine 
vibration and cutting forces that may cause deformation.
The wing force measurement model (320 × 350 × 30 mm) for engineering appli￾cations and the pressure measurement (210× 240×16 mm) test model manufactured 
in this book were used for manufacturing economy analysis. The volume of the force 
measurement and pressure measurement models were approximately 4 times related, 
and their models were uniformly scaled to the force measurement model for time 
and cost comparison. The light-curing printing time can be predicted using parame￾ters such as model volume, effective surface area, and support structure factors. The 
printing time for the force model is about 16–18 h, and the printing time for the 
pressure model is about 10–12 h. Under the same scaling ratio and the same printing 
conditions, the manufacturing time should be similar, so it is taken as 16–18 h. 
The post-processing time for the wing force measurement model, such as cleaning, 
surface grinding and post-curing, is about 1–2 h. As there are pressure measurement 
holes in the force measurement model for cleaning, and the more holes arranged the 
more difficult it is to handle, and the more detailed the surface finishing, the post￾processing time will be more, about 3–5 h. The time spent for chemical deposition 
is about 2 h, and the electrodeposition time is related to the current density and the 
thickness of the deposited layer. If the current density is 1 A/dm2, the time required 
for electrodeposition of nickel layer thickness of about 150 µm is 13 h. 
The time comparison of each manufacturing method is analyzed as Table 5.2. 
Compared with CNC machining, the time for manufacturing wing force model is 
reduced by about 60% for 3D printing technology and 80% for wing pressure model. 
For the numerical control machining of the pressure measurement model, the smaller 
the model, the more difficult it is to manufacture, especially the pressure measure￾ment hole machining of the flaps and so on, the longer the manufacturing time and 
the higher the manufacturing cost, so there is a great advantage of using 3D printing110 5 Electrodeposition Strengthening of Plastic Wind Tunnel Test Models

Additive Manufacturing of Wind Tunnel 
Test Models for Force Measurement 
6.1 Introduction 
The force measurement model is the basic model in the wind tunnel test, used to test 
the performance of the aerodynamic shape, the geometric similarity of the shape is 
important to the test quality, and the safety and processing efficiency of the model has 
an important impact on the wind tunnel test scheduling. The design and processing 
of the wind tunnel test model is an important part of the aircraft wind tunnel test, 
which has an important impact on the development cycle and cost of the aircraft 
[18]. The design and processing of wind tunnel test models is an important part 
of aircraft wind tunnel testing, and has a significant impact on the development 
cycle and cost of aircraft. At present, the practical models are realized by metal 
mechanical processing. Metal (high quality steel or hard aluminum) has excellent 
and stable mechanical properties, which can ensure the safety and stability of the wind 
tunnel test; the manufacturing technology represented by multi-degree of freedom 
CNC machining can provide satisfactory machining accuracy. Therefore, the metal￾machining mode is used for the design and processing of high-performance models 
[3, 4]. However, the advancement of advanced manufacturing technology and mate￾rial science provides the possibility to rethink the traditional model and develop new 
model design and processing methods. On the one hand, wind tunnel test models 
are a special class of industrial products serving aircraft development, with typical 
single-piece and small batch characteristics. Aircraft development will propose a 
variety of options for aerodynamic layout, shape parameters, weapon configuration, 
internal structure, etc., and require a large number of wind tunnel tests, therefore, the 
design and manufacturing of models should be able to quickly respond to the needs 
of aircraft designers; however, this is not the case for On the other hand, non-metallic 
materials (polymers, composites, etc.) have made great progress and have been able

to provide a wider choice of materials for engineering applications. Compared with 
metals, polymers and composites usually have better specific strength and specific 
stiffness, although they have lower strength, which is of great value for designing 
and processing lightweight wind tunnel test models [43, 44]. Meanwhile, the lower 
strength and stiffness also provide new possibilities for the development of aircraft 
models, such as Yan Yin [66, 67], Qianwe [15, 66, 67] Yang Zhichun [13] and Li 
Duchen [54] and other groups have verified that the low modulus of the material 
helps to achieve the design and fabrication of structurally similar elastic models, 
which is not possible using metals as the model material. 
In recent years, several departments at home and abroad have conducted research 
on 3D printing technology to innovate the design and manufacture of wind tunnel test 
models for aircraft. Attention was first focused on the feasibility study of replacing 
metal models with non-metal models. NASA’s Springer team [17, 25] NASA’s 
Springer team, Alabama University’s Landrum team [39]. The team of Springer 
at NASA, the team of Landrum at Alabama University, USA, the team of Chuk 
at McGill University, Canada [24]. The first feasibility studies were carried out in 
the 1990s by Springer’s team at NASA, Landrum’s team at Alabama University, 
Chuk’s team at McGill University, Canada, and Azarov’s team at the Central Pneu￾matic Research Institute (TsAGI), Russi [68]. The first studies were conducted in 
the 1990s and demonstrated the feasibility of 3D printing technology for the design 
and fabrication of wind tunnel test models in preliminary aerodynamic studies. The 
USAF has used the method for the E-8C early warning aircraft [30] X-45A UAV [34, 
69] and so on, and achieved good results. However, most of the above studies have 
used simple aircraft structures as objects [17, 25, 44, 70] (missiles, aircraft wings, 
standard models, etc.), and rarely involve models with complex detailed features 
(e.g., hanged bombs, adjustable rudder surfaces, etc.). The design and machining 
capabilities of these features are important for practical models and pose further 
challenges to the feasibility of 3D printing technology. 
Metal force measurement models based on traditional machining methods have 
difficulties in detail simulation, many parts, heavy models, and long processing 
cycles. This chapter develops a new method for the design and fabrication of high￾similarity force measurement models based on additive manufacturing technology, 
taking advantage of its seamless virtual data-physical part conversion, the inte￾grated printing capability of complex structures, and the low-density characteris￾tics of plastic materials. In this chapter, the plastic-metal hybrid structure scheme 
combines the advantages of additive manufacturing technology for rapid processing 
of complex aerodynamic shapes and internal mounting structures and the character￾istics of machined high-precision parts to ensure higher geometric similarity. The 
overall technical scheme is shown in Fig. 6.1.
With the powerful internal and external structure printing capability of the light￾curing printing technology, the model can be designed to be lightweight in order to 
improve the vibration safety of the model in the wind tunnel. The model includes 
aircraft prototype detail features such as hang-ups, fuselage bulges, adjustable rudder 
surfaces, etc. Due to the introduction of light-curing printing technology, the structure 
of the model has been simplified, the number of parts has been reduced, and the6.2 Lightweight Design 115

geometric similarity of the model has been improved. Based on the characteristics of 
the light-curing printing technology, this book designs the available rudder surface 
deflection mechanism in detail for different rudder surface structures, and proposes 
a resin hole reinforcement scheme to ensure the accuracy of resin-metal assembly. 
The strength calibration of the model is carried out by numerical calculation, and 
finally the model is tested in wind tunnel and compared with the data of the metal 
model. 
6.2 Lightweight Design 
6.2.1 Optimization Strategies 
As mentioned above, the aim of this chapter is to design and fabricate a lightweight 
rigid model, where weight reduction design is a central issue. The excellent printing 
capability of SL technology and the low density of the materials it uses [24, 71]. The 
excellent printing capability of SL technology and the low density of the materials 
used offer new possibilities for weight reduction design. On the one hand, the weight 
of the model can be reduced to a great extent by replacing the heavier metal with 
lightweight resin to make the shell of the model; on the other hand, the structure 
of the metal parts can be minimized and their machinability improved, as they only 
play a supporting role inside the model and are not involved in the composition of 
the aerodynamic shape, which helps to improve the cycle time and cost of the model 
design and processing.116 6 Additive Manufacturing of Wind Tunnel Test Models for Force …

Fig. 6.2 Design flow chart of the lightweighting composite model 
As shown in Fig. 6.2, the entire design process can be divided into two major steps: 
preliminary design and structural optimization. The initial structure of the resin shell 
is obtained by subtracting the metal skeleton from the aerodynamic profile geometry; 
weight reduction In this step, the structures of the metal skeleton and the resin shell 
are further optimized to reduce the total weight of the model. 
6.2.2 Preliminary Design 
The basic structure of the metal skeleton and resin shell will be determined in this 
step. The basic dimensions of the body column include the inner wall diameter, 
wall thickness and column length, and the lightweight model requires these three 
dimensions to be as small as possible. The inner wall diameter of the column is 
limited by the test balance, which requires a solid assembly of the column and the 
balance on the one hand, and the book is designed with a conical connection structure 
as shown in Fig. 6.3. The length of the column should be as short as possible while 
meeting the installation requirements of the wing skeleton, resin housing, etc. For 
the wing skeleton, the flat shape size and thickness are determined by the attachment 
structure—resin shell, the installation of control surface and the loading requirements 
of the model. The initial structure of the resin shell is obtained on the basis of the 
above-mentioned skeleton structure, and the excellent capability of SL technology to 
print complex structures makes the design of the resin shell relatively simple, simply 
by Boolean subtraction of the model’s form geometry from the skeleton geometry.6.2 Lightweight Design 117

Fig. 6.3 Structure of the metal skeleton and its optimal configuration 
The obtained initial model is statically analyzed using Finite Element Analysis 
(FEA) to obtain its strength and stiffness data. With the model’s sufficient load 
carrying capacity as the constraint variable, the initial model (e.g., a flat plate of the 
wing) can be optimally designed to further reduce the weight of the model. As shown 
in Fig. 6.3, the flat plate structure of the metal wing is further optimized into a step 
structure, which is more efficient and naturally lower in weight compared to a flat 
plate of uniform thickness due to the loading characteristics of the cantilever beam 
of the wing. For this reason, the corresponding structural optimization mathematical 
model needs to be established and the optimal solution is obtained using the automatic 
optimization method. This structural optimization problem can be expressed as the 
following mathematical model:
 
minimize f (x)
subject to xl ≤ x ≤ xu (6.1) 
1) Objective function 
The goal of optimization is to obtain the minimum weight of the structure (here, 
a metal wing flat plate is used as an example), so the objective function can be 
expressed as the following function: 
f (x) = wMetalWing(x) (6.2)118 6 Additive Manufacturing of Wind Tunnel Test Models for Force …
2) Optimization variables 
As Fig. 6.3 shown, the metal wing plate is divided into several optimization regions 
with the thickness of the regions increasing along the trailing edge-tip to the leading 
edge-root. The optimization variables include the thickness of the region and the posi￾tioning of the region. The optimization variables can be expressed as the following 
vectors: 
x = (xThickness, xDistance) (6.3) 
where the thickness vector and the positioning vector are composed of the following 
dimensional scalars: 
xThickness = (w_t1, w_t2, w_t3, w_t4) (6.4) 
xDistance = (w_d1, w_d2, w_d3, w_d4) (6.5) 
3) Binding variables 
The purpose of setting the constraint variables is to ensure that the optimization 
results are harmonious and process-oriented. For example, load-bearing require￾ments, minimum and maximum size requirements, etc. In this chapter, the worst test 
conditions are used as the load accounting conditions; the minimum size is set based 
on processability, generally greater than 0.5 mm; the maximum size of the embedded 
metal skeleton does not exceed the shell shall prevail. 
6.2.3 Structural Optimization 
Structural optimization is based on the preliminary design, the structure of the model 
is further optimized to further reduce the weight of the model while ensuring that 
the center of gravity of the model is in the design position. The main objects of 
optimization in this step are the metal fuselage column and the resin shell at the 
fuselage, where the excess weight of the former is removed by means of grooving, 
and the unnecessary internal entities of the latter are hollowed out, as shown in 
Fig. 6.3. The capacity of 3D printing technology to print complex internal structures 
increases the freedom of weight reduction design and is the basis for lightweight 
design of the model. The optimization calculations in this section are modeled as the 
following mathematical expressions:
 
minimize f (x)
subject to xl ≤ x ≤ xu (6.6)6.2 Lightweight Design 119
1) Objective function 
The minimization of the total weight of the model is the aim of the design of this 
section, so the objective function can be expressed as. 
f (x) = wModel(x) (6.7) 
2) Optimization variables 
As Fig. 6.3 shown, the optimization variables are the parameterized dimensions of 
the participating design components (e.g., metal head, metal tail, and resin head). 
Thus, the total optimization variables vector can be expressed as 
x = (xMetalNose, xMetalTail, xPlasticNose) (6.8) 
This project reduces the weight of the metal body by cutting slots in it. The 
parameterized dimensions include the location and size of the slots, so the variable 
vectors for the metal head and tail are as follows: 
xMetalNose = (n_l, n_h, n_d1, n_d2) (6.9) 
xMetalTail = (t_l, t_h, t_d1, t_d2) (6.10) 
Figure 6.4 shows the scheme diagram of the hollowed-out design of the resin 
shell. The wing and the adjacent fuselage section were not involved in this round 
of structural optimization for safety reasons due to the large load capacity near the 
wing. Other than that, all resin shell parts were hollowed out, including the resin 
nose, resin center fuselage and resin tail. Among them, the center fuselage and tail 
retain the safety wall thickness of 2 mm ~ 5 mm and undergo a non-parametric shell 
extraction process, which is no longer involved in the subsequent optimization calcu￾lation; the hollowing of the resin nose includes both parametric and non-parametric 
parts, and the parametric hollowing is involved in the optimization calculation. As 
shown in Fig. 6.4, the faces marked in green are obtained by the non-parametric 
shell extraction operation, while the blue faces are parametrically hollowed. The 
parametric hollowing operation of the head is controlled by three circular sections: 
front, middle and rear, where the largest rear section has fixed dimensions due to its 
fit with the metal head, and the dimensions and positions of the other two circular 
sections can be used as optimization variables with vector expressions as 
xPlasticNose = (pn_r1, pn_r2, pn_d1, pn_d2) (6.11)
3) Binding variables 
Again, a reasonable range of dimensions is the purpose of setting the constraint 
variables, and the principles for setting them are the same as in the previous section.120 6 Additive Manufacturing of Wind Tunnel Test Models for Force …

In addition, a constraint on the position of the total center of gravity of the model is 
added to this round of optimization. 
6.3 Adjustable Rudder Surfaces 
The rudder surface mechanism includes the flaps and ailerons of the main wing, the 
rudder and elevator of the drogue and flat tail, and other operating surfaces, which 
are the core to ensure the aerodynamic performance and realize the flight control of 
the aircraft. In the development of aircraft, there are a large number of models need 
to be equipped with adjustable deflection angle rudder mechanism. 
6.3.1 Steering Surface Adjustment Mechanism 
The rudder surface manipulation mechanism to change the rudder surface declina￾tion angle, both convenient and accurate, and to ensure that during the test, each 
manipulation surface declination angle does not change due to aerodynamic action 
[4]. Therefore, this book has designed a new design for different rudder surfaces.6.3 Adjustable Rudder Surfaces 121
Therefore, this book designed the corresponding rudder surface adjustment mecha￾nism for different rudder surfaces, divided into the rudder surface of the main wing 
and vertical tail and full-motion flat tail. 
1) Main wing and vertical tail 
The installation position of the main wing and drogue is larger, and the adjustment 
method of variable angle piece can be used. As Fig. 6.5c shows, a series of angle 
pieces are machined according to the test content, and the change of rudder decli￾nation is realized by changing different angle pieces. In this way, the surface of the 
model is clean, the connection is reliable, and the angular repeatability is high [4]. 
The model has clean surface, reliable connection, and high repeatability of angle 
positioning. 
Figure 6.5a shows the rudder control mechanism on the main wing. The metal 
variole is screwed to the metal skeleton inside the resin main wing, while the rudder 
surfaces (ailerons, front and rear flaps) are screwed to the variole. In the experiment, 
different deflection angles of the rudder surface can be achieved by simply changing 
the vario-angle piece. The drogue tail (Fig. 6.5b) also adopts a similar design scheme, 
except that there is no metal skeleton inside the resin drogue, so the variator is directly 
installed in the resin mounting holes. Because of SL’s powerful printing capability, all

mounting holes can be machined in one piece, and no subsequent drilling is required. 
It should be noted that in order to ensure the installation accuracy of the resin parts 
during repeated disassembly, the book also reinforces the mounting holes, which 
will be detailed below. 
2) Full-motion tail fin 
For a full-motion flat tail with a small installation space airfoil, the book adopts 
a rotary axis-locating pin control scheme. As shown in Fig. 6.5 the metal base 
embedded in the resin fuselage and the metal swivel shaft in the resin flat tail are 
the main components to achieve the full-motion flat tail deflection, respectively. The 
full-motion flat tail in Fig. 6.6 is capable of achieving three different deflections, 
each performed by three pin holes facing different directions. 
Metal parts can be machined with high accuracy, so the offset accuracy of this 
solution is mainly determined by the assembly accuracy of the metal base and the 
metal rotary shaft inside the resin matrix. This part will be discussed in the next 
section. 
6.3.2 Resin-Metal Assembly 
As discussed above, the guarantee of the overall assembly accuracy of the model 
depends on the assembly accuracy between metal and resin. 
As Figs. 6.5 and 6.6 shown, the resin mounting holes machined by SL as a whole 
are the main metal-resin assembly positioning structure, and their machining accu￾racy has a direct impact on the assembly accuracy. According to the SL machining 
accuracy study, the hole machining accuracy can be improved by presetting certain 
compensation dimensions and optimizing the corresponding process parameters 
(printing direction, etc.) [72]. However, even if optimization measures are taken, 
the machining accuracy of holes with curved surfaces can be improved. However, 
even with the optimization measures, the holes with curved surfaces are still difficult6.3 Adjustable Rudder Surfaces 123
to achieve the same level of machining accuracy as metals. At the same time, the 
model usually needs to be disassembled several times, and the resin mounting holes 
lose their positioning accuracy due to wear during disassembly. For this reason, this 
book proposes a way to install metal bushings in the resin mounting holes. On the one 
hand, the metal bushing can avoid the direct participation of resin in the assembly 
and play a protective role; on the other hand, the metal bushing can adopt an external 
positioning structure to avoid the loss of accuracy caused by the direct positioning 
of resin holes. For the size of the holes in different positions, this book proposes 
two mounting hole reinforcement schemes [73]. The book proposes two options for 
mounting hole reinforcement. 
1) Direct positioning method 
As Fig. 6.7a, b, the stepped hole surface of the SL machined hole is used as the 
positioning reference, and the metal sleeve is directly pressed into the positioning 
hole after applying adhesive, leaving a certain gap at the non-positioning surface to 
facilitate the curing of the adhesive connection. The axial positioning surface is the 
upper surface of the stepped hole, which is flat and can ensure high processing and 
positioning accuracy; while the radial positioning surface is the inner surface of the 
hole, which requires process optimization. This positioning method is suitable for 
areas with large mounting positions. The advantage is that all positioning surfaces 
are machined in one go by SL, which is a simple process, but the disadvantage is that 
the positioning accuracy depends entirely on the machining accuracy of the resin 
holes, which can meet the requirements in large size areas such as the fuselage, but it 
is difficult to guarantee the positioning accuracy of small features such as the rudder 
surface.
2) Auxiliary positioning method 
As Fig. 6.7c, d, cylindrical pins and positioning are used to assist in the high-precision 
positioning and installation of the metal sleeve. The maximum length of the sleeve 
should be no higher than the airplane airfoil where the bonding hole is located to 
prevent the impact on the airfoil shape, while the sleeve is inserted on the pin to 
prevent the flow of bonding agent into the sleeve countersink hole. The axial and 
radial positioning surfaces of the metal sleeve are the positioning plate pin fit hole and 
the positioning plate plane respectively, and the accuracy can be guaranteed. For the 
positioning of the positioning plate and the resin substrate, an auxiliary positioning 
structure located outside the hole can be used. As Fig. 6.7d, the auxiliary positioning 
structure is flat, which is convenient for SL high-precision machining; therefore, this 
solution can ensure high positioning accuracy. 
The outer surface of the sleeve is rolled mesh to increase the mosaic effect between 
the colloid and the surface to enhance the bonding performance; the gap between 
the outer surface of the sleeve and the bonding hole is taken as 1 ~ 3 mm, in order 
to facilitate the injection flow of the viscous resin or sufficient UV irradiation of the 
photosensitive resin, while also ensuring the bonding strength, the connection gap 
can be adjusted according to the height of the bonding hole.124 6 Additive Manufacturing of Wind Tunnel Test Models for Force …

6.3.3 Rudder Surface Manufacturing Accuracy 
1) Print distortion 
Since 3D printing technology is an ensemble of 3D entities discrete into cut layers 
with thickness, model layering not only destroys the continuity of the model surface, 
but also loses the contour information between adjacent cut layers. The thickness 
of the layers is the resolution of the discrete model, the larger the thickness of the 
layers, the lower the resolution, the more data the model loses, and the greater the 
printing error. The following two main types of errors are likely to occur during 
model printing: 
(1) Truncation error 
The data of the part to be machined is processed in layers, and the height direction 
causes loss of accuracy due to end truncation. As Fig. 6.8a, the total height of the 
part to be machined is H, the thickness of the stratification is ∆t, and the residual 
height of a section of the part is ∆h. When ∆h < ∆t, the height will be ignored when 
the data is processed discretely, thus causing a loss of accuracy.6.3 Adjustable Rudder Surfaces 125

(a) (b) 
Fig. 6.8 Errors caused by discrete processing of 3D printing process data 
(2) Step error 
When the model is layered, the shape profile of the model consists of two tangent 
layers, and since the horizontal surface profiles of the upper and lower tangent layers 
are not the same, the surface profile of the model is necessarily replaced by discrete 
planes, as shown in Fig. 6.8b shows, the “step effect” will be generated during 
processing and printing, which will significantly reduce the surface accuracy and 
cause surface accuracy errors. 
1) Print compensation 
The profile accuracy error generated by 3D printing process is related to the normal 
direction, radius of curvature and layered thickness of the solid surface, and the SL 
printing can improve the profile accuracy of the parts by reducing the layered thick￾ness and optimizing the manufacturing direction. However, the shape of the aircraft 
model is complex, especially the wing part of the aircraft, and the accuracy require￾ments of different parts are different, so a single printing direction is not enough to 
meet the surface accuracy of different surfaces. Therefore, the offset compensation 
design can be combined with different printing directions for the parts. In addition, 
the resin printing process mainly relies on the polymerization chemical reaction of 
monomer molecules, and the resin inevitably produces volume shrinkage, especially 
for the holes and slots that fit with the metal skeleton, and the shrinkage size is large, 
so it is also necessary to design offset compensation for such structures. The offset 
compensation should be combined with the actual size of the skeleton to make fine 
adjustments appropriately.126 6 Additive Manufacturing of Wind Tunnel Test Models for Force …

Fig. 6.9 Dimensional compensation for printing of extreme structures 
The tip of the head and other sharp and thin structure, its thin tip part is likely 
to cause the loss of processing characteristics due to the influence of 3D printing 
manufacturing process, forming a certain arc of rounded corners in the printing 
process, not only changes the shape characteristics of the head, but also reduces the 
length size of the head along the x-axis, so in the design of the tip part of the head 
morphological features outward offset, not only can compensate for the processing 
errors of 3D printing, but also can offset The amount of post-processing of the model 
can also offset the amount of regrinding, as shown in Fig. 6.9a shows that the front 
end of the head is selected by 5 mm and offset by 0.2 mm. 
The flat structure such as the leading flap of the wing, due to its wing section is 
printed at an angle of 50°, the step effect causes the leading edge of the leading flap 
to have a certain dimensional contraction in the horizontal plane direction, in order 
to ensure the dimensional accuracy of the leading edge we offset the leading edge 
outward by 0.2 mm, as shown in Fig. 6.9b shows. 
6.4 Case Studies 
6.4.1 Model Design 
The structure of a low-speed wind tunnel test model of a certain type of fighter jet 
is shown in Fig. 6.1. The entire aerodynamic shape is machined in SL, including the 
fuselage, main wing, drogue tail, flat tail, hanged bomb wing and all rudder surfaces 
(such as front flap, rear flap, aileron, rudder and movable flat tail, etc.). In order to 
improve the strength of the model and ensure the assembly accuracy, a machined 
metal skeleton (metal sleeve inside the fuselage and metal plate inside the main wing) 
is inlaid inside the resin aerodynamic shell. The mechanical property parameters of 
the materials used are shown in Table 1- 3 shown. The resin shell was machined6.4 Case Studies 127

from a photosensitive resin, the wing skeleton and various connecting parts (such as 
the angle change piece on the rudder surface) were machined from 40Cr steel, and 
the material of the other skeletons was 45 steel. The test wind tunnel used in this 
book is FD-09 low-speed wind tunnel of China Aerospace Aerodynamic Technology 
Research Institute, with the test section size of 3 m × 3 m, the model size scaling 
factor of this book is 1:10, and the length and span of the fuselage are about 1.5 m 
and 0.9 m. The machining size of SL equipment used in this book is 0.60 m ×
0.60 m × 0.45 m (SPS600B, Xi’an Jiaotong University). Therefore the resin shell 
needs to be split for processing. At the same time, this division also provides the 
possibility of assembling the model. As shown in Fig. 6.1, the fuselage is divided 
to avoid important aerodynamic parts, and the wing and fuselage are machined in 
one piece (left and right main wing—middle fuselage and drogue—rear fuselage) to 
avoid aerodynamic interference between the wing and fuselage joints. All the rudder 
surfaces and hangers are machined and mounted separately. 
The position of the center of gravity of the model after optimization design is 
shown in Table 6.1 The design accuracy is good and its error can be neglected. 
The weights of the optimally designed models are shown in Table 6.2. The weight 
reduction ratio of the optimally designed composite model is nearly 50% compared 
to the all-metal model, i.e., the weight is reduced by half. 
6.4.2 Model Calibration 
To ensure the safety and effectiveness of the wind tunnel test, the load bearing 
and vibration conditions of the model need to be calibrated before the test. Among 
them, the load bearing calibration is to examine whether the strength and stiffness 
of the model meet the requirements under the extreme test conditions, which is 
carried out by the combined Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)—Computational128 6 Additive Manufacturing of Wind Tunnel Test Models for Force …
Structure Dynamics (CSD) method [74]. The vibration calibration is performed to 
ensure that the model-computerized structural dynamics is not too rigid. The vibration 
calibration is to ensure that the first-order inherent frequency of the model-balance￾strut system avoids the peak blowing frequency (related to the wind tunnel and 
working conditions, provided by the wind tunnel test department), and the inherent 
frequency of the model-balance-strut system is calculated by the Finite Element 
Analysis (FEA) method. 
(1) Pneumatic Analysis 
Because the aircraft is symmetric relative to the fuselage center, a calibrated half￾model can be used to reduce the computational effort. In this project, the NS equation 
for 3-D Reynolds averaged non-compressible flow (3-D Reynolds averaged non￾compressible Navier–Stokes equation) is used to model the CFD analysis, and the 
discrete modeling method is the second-order Finite Volume Method (FVM) [75–78], 
a k-ω turbulence model is used. In the flow-solid cross section, a non-slip boundary 
condition is used, where the boundary is free of heat transfer and adiabatic treatment 
is done as follows [79]. 
u = v = ω = 0, ∂ P/∂n = 0 and T = Taω (6.12) 
The CFD flow field mesh is a tetrahedral unstructured mesh, with the total number 
of cells in the order of 1 million, as shown in Fig. 6.10. The input parameters for 
the pneumatic analysis are shown in Table 6.3. The incoming static pressure and 
reference temperature are taken from the wind tunnel data, and the fluid velocity and 
angle of attack are extreme conditions for this test.

Figure 6.11 shows the pressure and velocity distribution of the flow field on the 
lower surface of the model wing obtained by CFD calculation, as expected. The 
pneumatic loads will be imported into the subsequent structural analysis for load 
calibration. 
(2) Load-bearing calibration 
The purpose of the load-bearing calibration is to calibrate the strength and stiffness 
performance of the model under extreme aerodynamic loads, which are solved using 
the CSD method with the aerodynamic forces calculated by CFD as the load. The 
mathematical model is shown in the following equation [80, 81], the discretization 
method is the finite element method. where [M], [C] and [K] represent the mass, 
damping and stiffness matrices of the model, respectively. F(t) In the load function, 
transformed from CFD analysis, the q(t)is the displacement vector with the solution. 
[M]{q¨(t)} + [C]{q˙(t)} + [K ]{q(t)} = F(t) (6.13) 
Four extreme conditions were chosen for the calibration. As shown in Table 6.4, 
the blowing speed and angle of attack are the maximum values in all conditions, 60 m/ 
s and 8°. Condition 1 calibrates the overall strength and stiffness of the model with 
all control surfaces in the initial position; Condition 2, Condition 3 and Condition 
4 calibrate the strength and stiffness of the rudder, front flap and rear flap/aileron, 
respectively, with the corresponding control surfaces in the maximum open position.
The calculated stress and deformation diagrams of the model (including metal and 
resin parts) are shown in Fig. 6.12. At the safety factor of 2, the allowable strengths 
of the steel and resin materials used in the model are 194 MPa and 15.6 MPa, 
respectively, and the maximum stresses of the model under the extreme conditions 
used are less than the allowable values, and the strengths are safe.
(3) Vibration calibration 
In order to avoid resonance damage to the model during the blowing process, the first￾order intrinsic frequency of the model-balance-strut system needs to be calibrated to130 6 Additive Manufacturing of Wind Tunnel Test Models for Force …

ensure that it avoids the extreme value of the blowing pulsation frequency of the wind 
tunnel [82]. The frequency value of FD-09 wind tunnel is about 10 Hz (at the ultimate 
wind speed of 100 m/s), and the design requires the first-order intrinsic frequency of 
the model-balance-strut system to be larger than this value. The inherent frequency 
of the system is determined by its stiffness, damping and mass properties [80]. Under6.4 Case Studies 131

the premise of the first two parameters, the lower the mass of the system, the higher 
the first-order inherent frequency and the better the corresponding vibration safety. 
As shown in Table 6.5, the first-order intrinsic frequencies of the pure metal model, 
the initial composite model and the optimized composite model (with optimized 
weight reduction design) increase in order, and the optimized model has a maximum 
value of 21 Hz. The first-order intrinsic modes of the model-balance-strut system 
are shown in Fig. 6.13, which is the up-and-down oscillation around the strut along 
the y-axis, and its determinants are strut stiffness, strut damping and system mass. 
The first two parameters are the same for all three models, and the weight of the 
model is the determining factor. The optimized model has a smaller mass (about 
50% weight reduction) compared to the pure metal model, so its first-order intrinsic 
frequency is larger. This value is much larger than the extreme frequency of wind 
tunnel fluctuations (10 Hz), so the vibration safety of the composite lightweight 
model is good. 
6.4.3 Wind Tunnel Test 
The machined and assembled model is mounted on the wind tunnel balance strut, 
as shown in Fig. 6.14. Compared to the model built in this book, the metal model 
used as a control has two differences: (1), there are artificial turning strips affixed132 6 Additive Manufacturing of Wind Tunnel Test Models for Force …

to the nose and leading edge of the flap; (2), the air intake is naturally vented. The 
deviations in wind tunnel test results due to the structural differences are discussed 
in the next section. 
The test conditions were arranged according to the optimal design method, shown 
in Table 6.4. The wind tunnel tests tested the effects of angle of attack, blowing 
speed, model sideslip angle, and deformation angle of each control surface on the 
aerodynamic parameters of the model. 
6.5 Analysis and Discussion 
6.5.1 Contrast Analysis 
This section discusses the economics of model design and fabrication, focusing on 
the model’s part overview, total weight, machining cycle time, and machining costs. 
A comparison of each metric for composite and metal models is shown in Table 6.6.
(1) Total number of parts 
As shown in Table 6.6, the total number of parts of the composite model is reduced 
by about 50% compared to the metal model, mainly due to the integrated manu￾facturing of the SL process. The significant reduction in the number of model parts 
contributes to shorter model machining cycles and has positive implications for the6.5 Analysis and Discussion 133

overall model reliability; fewer mounting surfaces reduce the need for mounting 
parts, which means lower total model weight; and the integrated shape reduces data 
fluctuations caused by aerodynamic clearances, which has obvious implications for 
improving data reliability. 
(2) Total weight of the model 
The total weight of the composite model is reduced by about 50% compared to the 
metal model, as Table 6.6 shows. In addition to benefiting from the reduction in the 
total number of parts, as mentioned earlier, there are two other determining factors: 
on the one hand, the composite model uses resin instead of metal to compose the 
aerodynamic profile; On the other hand, the weight reduction optimization design 
removes mass and has an important impact on the weight reduction of the composite 
model, both of which depend on the entry of the SL process. 
(3) Processing cycle and cost 
The improvement in model processing cycle time and cost is even more pronounced, 
as Table 6.6 shows, these two parameters of the composite model are only 12% and 
25% of those of the metallic model. On the one hand, the resin pneumatic shape 
machined by SL is directly influenced by SL, which can greatly reduce the cycle 
time and cost; on the other hand, the structure of the machined metal part can be 
greatly simplified because it only provides strength and stiffness in the inner cavity, 
and its machining cycle time and cost can be optimized. In addition, the design 
efficiency of the model is also simplified. Although it is difficult to analyze quantita￾tively, experience shows that after the introduction of SL technology, the constraints 
of machining process on the model structure are greatly reduced, especially SL 
has better machining capability for complex internal and external structures, and 
designers can rely on optimal design tools to select the internal and external struc￾tures with optimal performance, and the difficulty of model design is greatly reduced 
[83, 84]. The difficulty of model design is greatly reduced. 
From the above analysis, the composite model based on SL processing has a 
better economy, especially in terms of total part weight reduction and processing 
cycle time, which reflects the characteristics of 3D printing technology represented 
by SL. Compared with the metal model, the total weight of the SL composite model 
is reduced by about 50%, achieving further lightweighting of the force measurement 
model, which is unachievable with conventional processing technology, which has 
positive implications for the preparation, transportation, and testing safety of the134 6 Additive Manufacturing of Wind Tunnel Test Models for Force …
model. Meanwhile, the comparison test shows that the composite model with full 
SL resin profile in the basic state obtains well-matched data, especially the basic lift 
coefficient curve CL −α that almost overlap with that obtained from the metal model 
with high accuracy. This shows that the model obtained by the newly implemented 
method can be used for the basic test items. 
6.5.2 Technical Limitations 
Although the model implementation based on SL technology has the above advan￾tages and reflects the high value of application, there are still areas for improvement. 
On the one hand, the above conclusions come from case studies, and their appli￾cability needs to be discussed in detail in order to extend the conclusions drawn 
from individual objects to a wider range; on the other hand, the technical solutions 
proposed in this book also have certain applicability targets, and the applicability to 
general wind tunnel test models needs to be further discussed. 
1) Subjects of the case study 
The case study object is a single-engine light fighter with a length of 14.97 m, a 
wingspan of 9.46 m, and a height of 4.78 m. It adopts a normal aerodynamic layout 
with a medium delta-wing span-to-edge ratio, a maximum takeoff weight of 12,474 
kg, a maximum aircraft speed of Ma1.8, and a maximum overload of about 8g, which 
is less loaded than other types of aircraft (heavy fighters, transport aircraft, etc.). The 
model in this chapter is the full-engine force measurement model of the fighter, and 
the air inlet is simplified as a conical block, and all rudder surfaces are adjustable; the 
test wind tunnel used is the FD-09 low-speed wind tunnel of the China Aerospace 
Aerodynamic Technology Research Institute, with a test section size of 3 m × 3 m, 
compared with other low-speed wind tunnels (e.g., FL-13 test section of 8 m × 6 m/ 
16 m × 12 m), the size of the model used in this wind tunnel is smaller. The size of 
the model is smaller than other low-speed wind tunnels (e.g., FL-13 test section is 
8m × 6 m/16 m × 12 m). In this book, the blowing range in the low speed stage 
(up to 70 m/s), angle of attack and side slip angle adjustment range are small, and 
the rudder adjustment range is normal. Therefore, the object of study in this book 
is representative of smaller models, control surface effects, and low speed tests, and 
special verification should be done for the extension of large load prototypes, large 
size models, large angle of attack ranges, and high speed blowing tests. 
2) Breadth of data tested 
This book has done sufficient wind tunnel tests on the composite model, including 
basic cruise test, sideslip deflection angle test, front flap efficiency test, rear flap 
efficiency test and rudder efficiency test, and analyzed the experimental results; in 
order to study the accuracy of the data obtained from the composite model, the 
data from the basic cruise were compared with the metal model, and preliminary 
conclusions were drawn. However, the test data in this book still need to be further6.5 Analysis and Discussion 135
expanded: (1) full-motion flat-tail efficiency test is not conducted in this book, which 
needs to be supplemented; (2) the qualitative analysis of all the results is only trended, 
which helps to get the preliminary results but is slightly insufficient for more refined 
analysis and needs to be improved; (3) the comparison data of the metal model is not 
sufficient, especially the lack of comparison data in rudder efficiency, which needs 
to be further expansion. 
3) Problems with all resin profiles 
Through the strength check test, it can be seen that the designed model scheme can 
meet the test needs of this study, but the results show that the resin strength margin is 
small and the model deformation is large. Further analysis shows that the main part 
of the problem is on the rudder surface, especially the aileron and rear flap, which 
are subject to large forces. For the object and test range proposed in this book, the 
all resin rudder surface is safe and reliable for aerodynamic data collection in the 
basic no-deflection state, but it will be a serious problem for aircraft models with 
rudder deflection, large angle of attack, high speed test and other high load classes. 
Therefore this part is not suitable for SL resin processing and needs to be realized 
by means of metal mechanical processing. 
The advantage of the practical lightweight model implementation method 
proposed in this book is the lightness of the model and the economy of manu￾facturing, so the impact on the overall effect of the technology when this part is 
machined from metal instead needs to be discussed. The total number of parts and 
the difficulty of assembly remain unchanged for both options, and the impact on the 
weight and machining cycle/cost of the model needs to be considered. As Table 6.7 
shows, the overall weight gain of the model after the rudder surface (including the 
tailplane, etc.) is changed to machined by aluminum alloy or steel is 0.91 kg and 3.67 
kg, respectively. According to Table 6.3, the total weight of the composite model after 
optimization is 36.42 kg. Even if all the control surfaces (including the tailplane) are 
made of 40Cr steel, the weight increase is only about 10%, and the weight reduction 
is still about 40% compared with the all-metal model, so the advantage of light weight 
is still obvious. It can be seen that changing the rudder surface to metal processing has 
less effect on the lightweight effect of the composite model, and this effect may be 
further reduced if it is considered that only part of the high-load rudder surface (such 
as rear flap and aileron) can be replaced by metal while retaining the other rudder 
surface materials as SL resin according to the test load. Similarly, the cycle time and 
cost of composite model processing may be increased after the rudder surfaces (some 
or all) are mechanically machined from metal, but still maintain some advantages 
over the all-metal model implementation scheme.
Therefore, making full use of the advantages of SL process and other processing 
processes and SL resin materials and metal materials, integrating the advantages of 
the two model realization methods, and based on the research in this book, a model 
realization scheme that can expand the scope of application of the technology is 
proposed: (1) maintaining the main structure of resin shell-metal skeleton unchanged; 
(2) SL resin in the parts of the fuselage, main wing structure and other parts with larger 
cross-sectional dimensions, with higher strength margin, with greater expandability,136 6 Additive Manufacturing of Wind Tunnel Test Models for Force …

and it is expected that similar parts of the model used in high-load aerodynamic 
layout and high-speed tests can be processed using SL resin; (3) for the weaker edge 
parts, change to the realization of high-strength metal mechanical processing (such 
as each rudder surface), especially the ailerons and rear flaps, which are subject 
to more serious forces. The specific replacement range is determined by different 
experimental objects and test ranges, according to the strength calibration results. 
This new scheme has no effect on the model design, total number of model parts, 
and assembly process, and has less effect on the total weight of the model and model 
machining periodicity and cost, basically retaining the advantages of the technical 
scheme of full SL resin aerodynamic shape, but making the composite lightweight 
model’s expected to be extended to other high load tests.Chapter 7 
Additive Manufacturing of Wind Tunnel 
Test Models for Pressure Measurement 
7.1 Overview 
7.1.1 Pressure Measurement Methods of Wind Tunnel Test 
Model 
The main purpose of the pressure measurement test is to provide the original data 
of the aerodynamic load distribution for the strength calculation of the aircraft and 
its components, to provide a test basis for the study of the aerodynamic perfor￾mance of the aircraft and its components, to study the flow characteristics around the 
model, and to determine the location of the minimum pressure point on the wing, 
the airflow separation characteristics, as well as the lift force acting on the model, 
the differential pressure resistance and the location of the center of pressure through 
the pressure distribution measurement. Information [3] The most commonly used 
pressure measurement systems are to determine the location of the minimum pres￾sure point on the wing, the airflow separation characteristics, and the lift, differential 
drag, and center of pressure acting on the model. The most commonly used pres￾sure measurement system is to build a special pressure measurement model, make a 
pressure measurement hole along the surface normal to the location of the pressure 
measurement point, and connect it to a measurement device such as a manometer or 
pressure sensor through a pressure measurement tube. Not only the whole system 
is very complicated, causing some interference to the flow field around the model, 
but also the processing of data is very cumbersome, so later the pressure sensor with 
pressure conversion valve was introduced, and the situation has been improved to 
some extent. 
Russia, the United States and Europe have been working on optical pressure distri￾bution measurement methods and techniques based on Pressure Sensitive Paint (PSP) 
since the 1990s. This technique is a revolutionary advance compared to the traditional 
pressure sensor-based pressure measurement techniques. The surface pressure of the

measured area and its distribution are measured optically by applying a pressure￾sensitive paint to the surface of the measured model, and its fluorescence intensity 
varies with the airflow pressure. This non-contact measurement method is flexible, 
easy to use, and offers significant cost and time savings. The measurement of pres￾sure distribution over the entire surface of the model eliminates the need to create 
pressure holes, pressure pipes, and wiring, saving the expensive cost of manufac￾turing dedicated pressure measurement models. More importantly, the pressure data 
obtained is continuous and extensive, especially in areas where it is not possible to 
install a pressure line, and can be measured by this method [85]. The pressure can be 
measured especially in the area where it is not possible to install a pressure line. In 
low-speed wind tunnels, the pressure-sensitive coating PSP technique suffers from 
testing accuracy problems because the pressure on the model surface is at a low 
level. Therefore, for the low-speed wind tunnel test with wind speed less than Mach 
0.4, the optical pressure distribution measurement method based on PSP has not 
been able to be applied, mainly because of the weak luminescence intensity of the 
pressure-sensitive coating in the low-speed low-pressure blowing wind test, which 
brings great difficulties to the optical detection and image data processing, and it 
is difficult to meet the test requirements. On the current level, the optical pressure 
measurement method is still only suitable for cross, supersonic wind tunnel test. 
Specifically in China, the technology to reach the level of being able to completely 
replace the open-hole pressure measurement there is still a lot of work to be done, 
such as the sensitivity, stability and life of domestic coatings and other performance, 
the development of multi-component coatings, film-forming technology, data acqui￾sition and processing methods and calibration methods and other technical issues, 
each of which is a great research work. Therefore, there is still a way to go for the 
engineering application of this technology. In summary optical pressure measure￾ment has a broad application prospect, but at present in the low-speed wind tunnel 
test still can only take the open-hole pressure measurement method. 
7.1.2 Requirements for Pressure Measurement 
The selection of model pressure profiles and pressure points is based on the test 
task and the actual possible arrangement of the model. For the wing, in general, 
two to seven binary airfoil pressure measurement profiles can be taken, and three to 
five ternary airfoil pressure measurement profiles are generally taken. In addition, 
the pressure measurement points along the chord direction on the upper and lower 
surfaces of the wing profile should be no less than fifteen, which can usually be 
arranged at 0, 1.25, 2.5, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 95 and 100% of 
these chord direction positions on the upper and lower surfaces of the wing. The 
number of pressure measurement points can be appropriately increased in areas 
with more drastic pressure changes such as the leading edge attachment of the wing 
and other locations. If a large-scale pressure test is conducted, the requirements for 
measurement equipment and measurement technology will be higher, for example,7.1 Overview 139
in a 2.4m wind tunnel, the number of pressure measurement points can be completed 
in thousands of pressure tests [86]. For example, thousands of pressure measurement 
points can be completed in a 2.4m wind tunnel. 
The pressure measurement tube inside the pressure measurement model is gener￾ally made of purple copper tube with an inner diameter of 0.4~1.2 mm or stain￾less copper tube with annealing treatment. The requirements for the pressure 
measurement piping are as follows: 
(1) The length of the pressure measurement tube should be as short as possible, if it 
has to be led out to the outside of the model, plastic pipe can be used to connect, 
the plastic pipe in the model should be dragged out of the position to consider 
the two aspects of the small bypass interference and easy installation; 
(2) The pressure measurement tube requires a clear direction, orderly arrangement, 
and accurate identification with the corresponding serial number of the pressure 
measurement hole; 
(3) The gas tightness and aeration of all pressure measurement piping must be 
carefully checked before the experiment; 
(4) When processing the pressure measurement orifice, avoid right-angle bends in 
the pressure measurement tube to prevent breakage and pipe blockage; 
(5) The axis of the pressure measuring hole should be perpendicular to the surface 
of the model, requiring no chamfering of the orifice and smooth, no burrs or 
unevenness around the orifice. 
7.1.3 Comparison of Model Manufacturing Methods 
for Pressure Measurements 
From the conventional processing methods of pressure measurement orifices can 
be seen, pressure measurement model orifice structure is complex, the number of 
traditional mechanical processing methods is very difficult, a pressure measurement 
model processing costs may be up to a million yuasn(RMB), taking more than six 
months. Light-curing 3D printing technology has the characteristics of complex 
structure easy to print, very suitable for the intricate orifice structure on the pressure 
measurement model, can realize the pressure measurement hole, pressure trans￾mission pipeline and model shape integrated printing. In addition, light-curing 3D 
printing technology also has and has the advantages of high speed, high precision, 
good surface quality, simple and time-saving processing. 
From the above analysis of the structure of the conventional metal model, it is 
clear that the 3D printing manufacturing method has incomparable superiority to the 
conventional manufacturing method in the manufacturing of the pressure measure￾ment model, so it has a very broad application prospect. The advantages and disad￾vantages of the conventional metal model using CNC machining method and 3D 
printing manufacturing method are shown in Table 7.1.140 7 Additive Manufacturing of Wind Tunnel Test Models for Pressure …

7.2 Effect of Structure Morphology on Pressure 
Measurements 
7.2.1 Influence of Pressure Measurement Piping Parameters 
on Pressure Measurement Results 
The structural parameters of the pressure measurement pipeline have a close rela￾tionship with the wind tunnel pressure measurement experiment error, mainly in the 
diameter of the pressure measurement hole, the degree of pipe bending, pipe length 
and cross-sectional area of three aspects. 
1) The diameter of the pressure measuring hole 
When measuring the pressure and its distribution on the surface of a wind tunnel test 
model by a pressure measurement hole, the presence of the hole changes the curvature 
of the flow line and the vortex inside the hole near the location on the model surface, 
which results in a higher pressure value Pm measured by the hole than the real pressure 
value Pt. The pressure measurement error is generally characterized by ΔP/q, where 
ΔP = Pm−Pt, and q is the dynamic pressure. Ideally, a pressure measurement orifice 
with zero orifice diameter will not cause any disturbance to the air flow in the vicinity 
of the pressure measurement orifice. As shown in Fig. 7.1, the pressure measurement 
error ΔP/q caused by the finite size pressure orifice increases with the diameter of the 
orifice on the one hand, and with the number of airflow Ma on the other hand [87]. The 
pressure measurement error ΔP/q caused by the finite size pressure orifice increases 
with the diameter of the orifice on the one hand and with the number of Ma of the 
airflow on the other. Assuming a pressure hole diameter d of 1 mm and airflow Mach 
numbers Ma of 0.4 and 0.8, the pressure measurement errors ΔP/q caused by the 
pressure hole are 0.6% and 1%, respectively. Therefore, from the aspect of reducing 
the influence of the pressure measurement hole on the pressure measurement results,7.2 Effect of Structure Morphology on Pressure Measurements 141
Fig. 7.1 Effect of bore size on pressure measurement error [87] 
the pressure measurement hole with small orifice diameter should be designed as 
much as possible. The ability of light-cured 3D printing technology to fabricate 
miniature orifices will be investigated in Chap. 2. 
2) The degree of pipe bending 
In general, to ensure the stability of the airflow at this location, the vertical depth 
of the pressure measurement hole should be greater than twice the diameter of the 
orifice. When pressure is transmitted in the pressure transfer flow path, the bend in 
the flow path will have a restraining effect on the airflow. The greater the bend, the 
greater the resistance, which results in a longer time to reach pressure equilibrium. 
The calculation of the drag coefficient of a bent pipe is related to the Reynolds number 
Re, the diameter d of the bend and the radius of curvature R of the axis of the bend, 
and the Dean number De is usually used to characterize this effect in a comprehensive 
manner, De = Re √d/R. Therefore, in order to avoid causing sharp bending and 
increase the flow resistance, the design of the orifice should minimize the number of 
turns in the flow channel and the degree of bending of the elbow, such as bending 
angle as far as possible to bend into obtuse angle, avoid acute angle, etc.. In addition, 
in order to facilitate the cleanup of the residual liquid resin in the conduction 3D 
printing orifice, the bending transition connection line and transition cross-section 
can not be designed as angular, available arc connection, elliptical arc connection and 
other curvature light smooth connection, and with different diameters of the circular 
cross-section for sweeping transition. 
3) Pipe length and cross-section size 
Because the pressure measurement pipeline is long, in addition to the pressure 
measurement orifice installed inside the model, an external pressure pipeline must 
be installed to lead the airflow out of the wind tunnel to connect with the pres￾sure sensor, thus leading to a large hysteresis effect of the pressure measurement 
instrument. Therefore, when connecting the pressure sensor and scanning valve, it 
should be placed as close to the pressure measurement point as possible, in order 
to shorten the length of the pressure measurement pipe, thus reducing the pressure 
hysteresis caused by the pressure transfer, the pressure measurement error caused by 
the pressure hysteresis can be calculated by the following formula [87] Calculation:142 7 Additive Manufacturing of Wind Tunnel Test Models for Pressure …

In Fig. 7.2, the curve of Δp/p − dp/dt for the pressure measuring line is given. 
When dp/dt = 50 Pa/s, the diameter of the pressure measuring hole d = 0.51 mm, 
and the pipe length l = 0.91 m, Δp/p = 0.06%; and when increasing l by a factor 
of 5, l = 4.57 m, Δp/p = 1.5%. In order to eliminate the pressure measurement 
error caused by the pressure transfer lag, wind tunnel experiments are generally used 
to increase the pressure stabilization time and wait until dp/dt ≈ 0, i.e., Pm ≈ Pt, 
before starting to collect experimental data [87] It can be seen that shortening the 
pipeline and increasing the pipe size can reduce the pressure measurement error. It 
can be seen that shortening the pipeline and increasing the cross-sectional area of 
the pipe can shorten the pressure stabilization time and thus save the blowing time. 
In addition, the pressure state before and after the pressure reaches equilibrium at 
the pressure measurement points at different locations during the blowing process is 
different, and the lag time grows as the pressure goes from high to low pressure. When 
the pressure at the pressure measuring hole is higher than the pressure at the measuring 
instrument, the air density in the pipe increases until it reaches the equilibrium state.
Fig. 7.2 Pressure 
measurement error due to 
pressure transfer lag [87] 7.2 Effect of Structure Morphology on Pressure Measurements 143
As the density increases, the specific volume of air in the pipe decreases, resulting 
in a decrease in the velocity of airflow in the pipe, so the pressure loss in the pipe 
is small when it is close to the equilibrium state. When the pressure at the pressure 
measuring orifice is lower than the pressure at the measuring instrument, the specific 
volume of air inside the tube increases, resulting in an increase in the velocity of the 
airflow, so that the pressure loss near the equilibrium state is large. If a sensor is used 
inside the model as well as a scanning valve device, the required gauge tube length 
is correspondingly reduced, and therefore the pressure lag time is also shortened. 
However, it still takes a few seconds for stabilization when the scanning valve is 
switched from one gauge orifice to another to record the data. When arranging the 
sensor inside the body, it is important to ensure that the pressure sensor and its entire 
accessory tube system are easy to install and maintain, and that the sensor is isolated 
from the outside environment, such as vibration and heat, so that it does not affect 
the sensor’s performance. 
7.2.2 Influence of Orifice Printing Defects on Pressure 
Measurement Results 
Static pressure is the pressure acting in the direction normal to the wall of the flow 
tube during the flow of fluid. The local static pressure is felt by opening a small hole 
along the normal direction on the wall or model surface of the test section of the wind 
tunnel. If the pressure is measured after a long enough period of pressure equilibrium 
stabilization, the effect of the error mainly comes from the quality of the print at the 
pressure measurement hole. The shape of the pressure hole edge, the inclination of 
the hole axis, bulges (or depressions) near the hole, scratches, etc. all have an effect 
on the pressure measurement value [87]. When the pressure hole edge is rounded, 
part of the dynamic pressure will be felt, and the pressure measurement value is 
high; when the pressure hole edge is chamfered to form a conical flare, there will 
be airflow separation, and the pressure measurement level is low, such as Fig. 7.3. 
When the axis of the pressure orifice is tilted toward the incoming flow, the pressure 
measurement value increases; when the axis of the pressure orifice is tilted toward the 
downstream, the pressure measurement value decreases, as shown in Fig. 7.4. When 
the back of the pressure hole protrudes, the measured value is high; when the front 
of the pressure hole protrudes, the measured value is low; when there are burrs near 
the pressure hole, the measured value is low; when there are uneven corrugations on 
the surface near the pressure hole, it makes the measured value decrease, as shown 
in Fig. 7.5.
The step effect and surface treatment have to be removed after 3D printing. Due to 
the step effect in the 3D printing principle, the step formation direction of the orifice 
and vertical hole wall of the pressure measurement orifice is different in different 
printing directions. When the surface of the measurement model is not polished, 
there must be a certain protrusion near the orifice due to the ‘step effect’, and the144 7 Additive Manufacturing of Wind Tunnel Test Models for Pressure …

edge of the orifice may be scratched during the polishing process. Even if the surface 
is properly treated, it is still impossible to form a regular round hole edge because of 
the step effect of the hole wall. A square flow field model was established to simulate 
the wind tunnel wall, and a 0.8 mm pressure measurement hole was opened in the 
center of one wall of the square flow field, and the simulation was carried out in 
a CFD software. Figures 7.6 and 7.7 shows the pressure of printed holes with 90° 
vertical and 0° horizontal printing directions. The flow field inlet velocity V is 100 m/ 
s. It can be seen that different hole types have different effects on the airflow near 
the pressure measurement hole.
The flow rate and pressure at the pressure measurement orifice and the pressure 
at the measurement point are shown in Table 7.2. The pressure measurement error 
for the step orifice compared to the ideal circular orifice is calculated schematically 
as follows (ρ is the density of the incoming gas)

Obviously, 3D printing is an accurate replica of the 3D theoretical model, and 
the vertical axis of the pressure measurement hole will not form excessive skew, but 
the step effect will change the surface quality of the hole. The actual measurement 
error brought by the 3D printing manufacturing, through the numerical simulation 
can only approximate the local schematic, in the future wind tunnel test shall analyze 
the test data to obtain sufficient experience and error correction.

7.3 Additive Manufacturing Processing of Models 
for Pressure Measurements 
7.3.1 Pressure Gauge Orifice Printing Experiment 
When manufacturing a pressure measurement model using 3D printing technology, 
the pressure transfer orifice is the key to printing. In engineering applications, a model 
component has anywhere from tens to hundreds of pressure transfer orifices. During 
the integrated manufacturing process of 3D printing, if one of the orifices fails to print 
or becomes clogged, the entire model will fail, so the orifice processing capability of 
3D printing must be studied and an orifice structure suitable for 3D printing must be 
designed so that the pressure transfer model can be processed quickly and efficiently 
by 3D printing. 
The orifice test model shown in Fig. 7.8 was divided into five groups according 
to the orifice radius R, which are 300 μm, 350 μm, 400 μm, 450 μm and 500 μm 
respectively. In order to study the printing angle α (the angle between the printing 
direction of the pressure measuring flow channel and the horizontal direction, as 
shown in Fig. 7.9) on the pressure orifice printing, five groups of models were printed 
at five angles of 0°, 10°, 20°, 30°, and 90°. In order to investigate the effect of 
runner length l on the pressure orifice printing, two groups of runner lengths (100 
and 150 mm) were designed for comparison. The experimental parameters were 
designed as follows Table 7.3.

7.3.2 Analysis of Experimental Results of Orifice Printing 
The light-curing rapid prototyping equipment used in this study is the SPS600B light￾curing prototyping machine of Xi’an Jiaotong University. The model manufactured 
with this printer is shown in Fig. 7.10. 
1) Conductable orifice study 
After the model is manufactured, uncured liquid resin is adsorbed on the surface. 
If this resin cures, it will not only damage the surface finish of the part, but also 
cause dimensional and shape errors. Therefore, it is important to wait for a period 
of time after the pallets are raised before removing the part so that the liquid resin 
adsorbed on the surface of the model, especially in the pores, can flow back into 
the resin tank. In addition, the resin adsorbed inside the orifice must be cleaned 
with alcohol or acetone as soon as possible after the model is removed. In the pore 
channel conduction process, syringe injection and compressed air injection were 
used. The effect of pore diameter and printing direction on the conductivity of the 
pore channel was obtained from the printing results of groups 1 to 5 specimens 
as follows Table 7.4 The influence of aperture diameter and runner length on the 
conduction of the pressure orifice is shown in Table 7.4, and the influence of aperture 
diameter and runner length on the conduction of the pressure orifice is shown in 
Table 7.5 The effects of aperture diameter and flow path length on the conductivity 
of the pressure orifice are shown in Table 7.5. √ and × indicate conduction and 
non-conduction, respectively.

According to Tables 7.4 and 7.5 the results obtained, the following conclusions 
can be drawn: 
(1) The orifice printed in the 0 degree direction is the most difficult to conduct, and 
90 degrees is the easiest; 
(2) The difficulty of conducting the orifice increases as the radius of the orifice 
decreases; 
(3) The difficulty of conduction of the orifice increases with the increase of the 
length of the flow channel; 
(4) When designing the orifice radius according to the length of the flow channel, 
the following principles should be followed: when the length of the flow channel 
is less than or equal to 50 mm, the minimum orifice radius that can be conducted 
is 350 μm; when the length of the flow channel is between 50 and 100 mm, the 
minimum orifice radius that can be conducted is 400 μm; when the length of 
the flow channel is greater than or equal to 100 mm, the minimum orifice radius 
that can be conducted is 450 μm. 
2) Orifice quality analysis 
Since traditional pressure measurement models use metal or plastic tubes with good 
internal surface quality, there is no clear quality requirement for the orifice for pres￾sure transmission. However, the orifices manufactured by light-curing 3D printing7.3 Additive Manufacturing Processing of Models for Pressure Measurements 149
(a) Aperture R=350μm, printing direction 90° (b) Aperture R=350μm, printing direction 0°

have residual liquid resin inside them after printing and a small amount still adheres 
to the inner wall after cleaning, which has an impact on the quality of the orifices. 
In this section, the relationship between the printing direction and the quality of the 
aperture is investigated. 
By Table 7.4, It can be seen that when the aperture diameter R is greater than 
350 μm, the apertures made in any printing direction can be conducted, but the step 
effect of the light-curing printing process also makes the resin cleaned incompletely 
and attached to each step class to cause some impact on the quality of the apertures. 
Figure 7.11 the cross-sectional view of the pore channel for a model with a pore 
diameter R of 350 μm is shown in Fig. 7.11 at 0° and 90° printing angles, respectively. 
It can be seen that when the printing angle is 90 degrees, the aperture shape is close 
to circular and the aperture quality is good. When the printing angle is 0 degrees, the 
pore shape is elliptical and the pore quality is poor. 
The printing direction of a porous part should be maximized in the direction of 
the hole axis. The finer the subdivision of the same surface, the better the quality 
of the curved surface. Therefore, when the layered thickness is a constant value, the 
printing direction should maximize the number of surface layups. In addition, the 
higher the height of the part, the longer the corresponding manufacturing time, the 
greater the laser power loss brought about, and the higher the manufacturing cost, 
so the test manufacturing direction is generally taken as 20º–30º for the test. When 
performing engineering applications, the part should be printed in a stack along the 
direction of the largest dimension due to the high requirements for surface quality. 
7.3.3 Pressure Gauge Orifice Printing Accuracy Analysis 
The dimensional accuracy of the models manufactured by the light-curing printer 
is determined by the printer. For miniature pressure measurement orifices, there is 
a certain deviation between the actual size of the model orifice and the design size. 
Therefore, an accuracy analysis of the orifice test model is necessary to objectively150 7 Additive Manufacturing of Wind Tunnel Test Models for Pressure …
evaluate the dimensional deviation between the light-cured 3D printed model and 
the design value, and thus provide a compensation guideline for designing the size 
of the piezometric orifice. 
The manufactured orifice test models were truncated into three sections along 
the length of the orifice, and each section was trimmed and cleaned to measure its 
orifice diameter and calculate its average value. The measurement equipment used 
was the VH-8000 microscope system from Keyence, Japan, which has a maximum 
magnification of 3000 and a minimum dimension of 50 nm, allowing for dimen￾sioning and measurement, and direct output of digital images, as shown in Fig. 7.12. 
Table 7.6 shows the average values of the orifice radius for each group of models at 
a printing angle of 20 degrees and the average values of the standard deviation of 
each hole, which summarize the specific design compensation values. For example, 
if the runner length is 50 mm and the design orifice diameter is 450 μm, the average 
value of the measured orifice diameter is 411 μm and the compensation value is 44 
μm, which means that the design value of the orifice diameter under this condition 
is equal to the expected value of the orifice diameter plus the compensation value.

7.4 Connetctions of Models for Pressure Measurements 
7.4.1 Study on the Connection Scheme of the Internal 
Pressure Measurement Orifice of the Model 
In order to connect the orifices between the different components of the gauging 
model (fuselage, wing, front wing, rudder surface), the following two interfaces for 
the internal gauging orifices of the model were designed: 
1) Metal tube—hose connection design 
As shown in Fig. 7.13 in A, a 1.2 mm diameter hole is designed near the connection 
of the orifice to insert a metal tube with 1.2 mm outer diameter and 0.8 mm inner 
diameter, and in B, a 1.6 mm diameter hole is designed near the connection of the 
orifice to insert a plastic hose with 1.6 mm outer diameter and 1.2 mm inner diameter. 
The gap is filled with adhesive, and the metal tube in A and B is inserted into the 
plastic hose in B during assembly to complete the aperture connection. This kind 
of interface is for the smaller structure of flaps, ailerons, small rudder surfaces and 
other positions.

2) O-ring connection design 
Part A and B of the model shown in Fig. 7.14 were assembled, and the orifice 
diameter is 0.8 mm. A groove was designed near the connection in part A, and a tab 
was designed near the connection in part B. An O-ring with an inner diameter of 
2.0 mm and an outer diameter of 5.4 mm was installed in the radial direction. This 
type of interface is for larger structures such as fuselage, wing and other locations 
for connection. 
3) Comparison of the two solutions 
A comparision of the above two internal orifice connection solutions is shown in 
Table 7.7 based on the structural characteristics. 
7.4.2 Study on the Connection Scheme of the Internal 
Pressure Measurement Orifice of the Model 
To perform the pressure measurement wind tunnel experiments, it is necessary to 
connect the pressure measurement orifice in the model to the external pressure 
measurement system, so two interface solutions are designed: single-hole connection 
and modular connection. 
1. Single-hole interface design7.4 Connetctions of Models for Pressure Measurements 153
Model External pressure

Fig. 7.15 Schematic diagram of metal tube interface 
The single-hole interface options are divided into the following three types: 
1) Metal pipe interface. As shown in Fig. 7.15 the metal pipe is sealed with adhesive 
at the gap between the metal pipe and the model, and the metal pipe is inserted 
into the external pressure measurement hose for connection. 
2) Hose interface. As shown in Fig. 7.16, a conical hole is designed at the outlet of 
the model orifice, and the pressure measurement orifice in the model is extended 
outward, and the 1.6mm outer diameter and 1.2mm inner diameter pressure 
measurement hose is inserted into the hole to wrap the outward extension of the 
pressure measurement pipe, and the gap is filled and sealed with adhesive. 
3) Resin interface. As Fig. 7.17 shown, a section of pipe extending outward is 
designed at the exit of the model orifice and printed together with the model. 
The pipe is divided into two sections, the section near the model is a transition 
section with a 5-degree inclination angle, and then the interface section with an 
outer diameter of 1.2 mm and an inner diameter of 0.8 mm. When connecting, 
a 1.6 mm outer diameter and 1.2mm inner diameter pressure measurement hose 
is placed on the interface section to complete the connection with the external 
pressure measurement system.

Due to the large number of pressure measurement orifices in the wind tunnel test 
model, the following two modular interface solutions were designed to connect 
multiple orifices at once in order to improve the connection efficiency.

7.4.3 Performance Study of Pressure Measurement Orifices 
and Interfaces 
Based on the study of the connection scheme of the pressure measurement orifice, 
models of the pressure measurement orifice with various interfaces were designed 
and manufactured with a length of 150 mm and an orifice radius of 0.4 mm, as 
Figs. 7.20, 7.21, and 7.22
1) Gas tightness test verification 
According to “GJB 180A-2006 A Low-speed Wind Tunnel Aircraft Model Design 
Specification”, when there is a pressure difference of not less than 3200 Pa between 
the inside and outside of the orifice, and the loss of ΔP between the inside and 
outside of the orifice within 60 s is less than 8 Pa, the requirement of airtightness 
of the pressure measurement orifice is met. Therefore, the schematic diagram of the 
experimental equipment designed to verify the air tightness of the pressure measuring 
orifice and the interface is as follows Fig. 7.23.
The experimental steps are as follows: 
Turn on the high pressure gas source and set the pressure value to 105,000 Pa; 
Opening valve B, closing valve A and blocking the test model orifice outlet; 
Open valve A. After 60 s, read the pressure gauge reading and calculate the 
difference between it and the original pressure; 
Repeat the above steps 3 times and calculate the average value as Table 7.9.
The experimental results show that the gas tightness of the model of the pres￾sure orifice with three kinds of interfaces meets the standard of the wind tunnel 
experiments of pressure measurement. 
2) Aeration experimental verification 
According to “GJB 180A-2006 A Low-speed Wind Tunnel Aircraft Model Design 
Specification”, when a jump-step pressure difference of not less than 3200 Pa occurs 
between the input and output of the pressure measurement pipeline, the pressure 
difference between the two ends of the orifice is less than 8 Pa within 2 s, which7.4 Connetctions of Models for Pressure Measurements 157

Additive Manufacturing of Wind Tunnel 
Test Models for Static Aeroelastic 
Properties 
8.1 Overview 
The model used in the static aeroelastic wind tunnel test is the static aeroelastic 
model [88]. The ideal static aeroelastic model has the same aerodynamic shape and 
similar structural parameters (mainly structural stiffness) as the prototype aircraft in 
terms of scaling. Currently, static aeroelastic models often use beam frame—frame 
section structure. The main components of the beam frame structure are single or 
multiple beams, located inside the model (fuselage and wings), generally made of 
metal, which simulate the stiffness of the model and provide strength to the overall 
model; the frame segment structure is mounted on the beam frame, which forms the 
aerodynamic shape of the model and transmits the aerodynamic force to the beam 
frame. For design and processing convenience, the stiffness of the model is entirely 
provided by the beam frame, and the complete aerodynamic shape is divided into 
disconnected frame segments (e.g., Fig. 8.1). The complete aerodynamic shape is 
divided into disconnected frame segments (shown in Fig. 8.1) and mounted on the 
beam frame as “point connections” to reduce the influence of the shape stiffness 
on the design model stiffness. During the blow test, the frame segments were filled 
with low modulus materials such as foam and elastomer to maintain the complete 
aerodynamic shape. In the low-speed stage, the model designed and processed by the 
above scheme can provide enough accurate test data; however, in the high-speed test, 
the low-modulus material between the frame segments will be deformed greatly, and 
the integrity of the aerodynamic shape is difficult to be guaranteed, which increases 
the uncertainty of the test data.
After more than two decades of development, 3D printing has been applied to the 
manufacturing of wind tunnel test models for a wide range of aircraft, speed ranges, 
and test types, and its feasibility and advantages have been verified in large numbers. 
However, there are relatively few reports on the application of elastic models, and 
there are many reasons for this situation. First, because the elastic model test is an 
“advanced test project”, its implementation is in the final stage of aircraft design,

which requires high confidentiality and is not easy to be reported publicly; second, 
the elastic model has more design constraints and specific similar requirements for 
structural parameters, and its design and manufacturing process is tedious for the 
feasibility verification project. This research object is too complex, so it is generally 
not selected as a research topic; furthermore, elastic models are sensitive to the 
mechanical response of materials, and the replacement of manufacturing materials 
and manufacturing processes has a greater impact. Compared with general rigid 
models, the selection of 3D printing technology to process elastic models, engineers 
have to take greater risks, which also limits the adoption of this type of models to 
new technologies. In summary, the need for confidentiality, design difficulty, and 
implementation risk have resulted in fewer reports of research on the adoption of 
3D printing technology for elastic models. The limited reports focus on the use of 
3D printing to replace non-metallic material components [49]. The model simulates 
the dynamic characteristics of the wing section of a prototype aircraft with a beam￾frame segment structure, in which the aerodynamic shape is divided into disconnected 
segments. Tests have shown that the plastic frame segments machined with SL can 
withstand transonic loads and satisfactory data can be obtained. 
This chapter proposes a structural solution and implementation method for a wind 
tunnel test model with an integrated aerodynamic shape. The key of this new idea is 
that the aerodynamic shape is an integrated structure that contributes to the overall 
stiffness of the model and is machined in one piece by 3D printing after the design 
is completed; the beam frame structure can be simplified. The idea can solve the 
influence of the deformation of the segmented frame section on the aerodynamic 
shape of the model on the one hand, which is expected to improve the geometric 
similarity of the model and thus ensure the accuracy of the wind tunnel test; on the 
other hand, it simplifies the model design and manufacturing process and helps to 
improve the efficiency of the wind tunnel test. 
The structure of the model is shown in Fig. 8.2. The structure of the model is 
shown in Fig. 8.2, which consists of two major parts: the metal skeleton and the 
plastic shell. The metal skeleton is located inside the model and divided into two 
major parts, fuselage and wing, which provide the main strength and stiffness and 
are mounted on the balance located at the tail of the model through the inner cavity of 
the fuselage; the plastic shell is divided into two major parts, fuselage and wing, which8.2 Composite Model Design Method 163
Fig. 8.2 Structural scheme 
of the composite aircraft 
model 
are mounted on the corresponding metal skeleton and provide the full aerodynamic 
shape of the model. As shown in Fig. 8.2, both the left and right wing shells are 
integrated monolithic structures, which are machined by 3D printing (SL process) 
in one go. Because of their large stiffness, the impact on the overall wing stiffness 
cannot be neglected, so the stiffness of the plastic shells needs to be accounted for in 
the stiffness design. To maintain the continuity of the aerodynamic shape as much 
as possible, the fuselage part connected to the wing is also integrated into the wing, 
designed and machined in one piece, thanks to the powerful manufacturing capability 
of 3D printing technology for complex structures inside and outside. Other plastic 
shells include the front and rear sections of the fuselage—the nose and fuselage— 
and since the fuselage stiffness did not need to be simulated in this project, the 
design of this section was made simple, requiring only the maintenance of the correct 
aerodynamic shape and a reliable fit to the rest of the model. 
8.2 Composite Model Design Method 
8.2.1 Design Process 
From the above, it is clear that the key to the design of this model is the wing part—the 
load-bearing metal beam frame and the integrated plastic shell. Since the wing of the 
prototype with a large span is long and narrow, and the variability along the chordal 
direction within the airfoil is small, its structural parameters can be simplified to a 
single beam, so the metal beam frame of this model adopts a single beam structure.164 8 Additive Manufacturing of Wind Tunnel Test Models for Static …
As shown in Fig. 8.2 the left and right beams are joined as one at the wing root 
and fixed to the fuselage skeleton by the assembly, and only the part from the wing 
tip to the wing root needs to be designed for the model design. The plastic shell is 
installed on the outside of the beam, and the left and right parts are installed in the 
middle of the fuselage in a docking position. Because of its integrated structure, it 
has a large stiffness and contributes to the wing stiffness, and its influence needs to 
be considered in the model design phase. 
The design flow of the static aeroelastic model is shown in Fig. 8.3. From the 
prototype to the model goes through two stages of similar design and structural 
design, and the design objects include the structural parameters and aerodynamic 
shape of the model and the aerodynamic parameters of the blowing wind. In order 
to verify the model design accuracy, a series of validation tests were conducted in 
this project, including ground deformation tests for the structural parameters of the 
model and numerical simulations and wind tunnel tests for the overall performance 
of the model. 
Fig. 8.3 Design flow of the pneumatic elastic model8.2 Composite Model Design Method 165
8.2.2 Scaled Down Design 
The task of similarity design is to determine the scaling factors of the model. For 
static aeroelastic models, the scaling factors to be determined are divided into two 
categories: dimensional scaling factors and aerodynamic scaling factors: the former 
includes form geometry and structural parameters; the latter covers Mach number, 
dynamic pressure, and density. Form geometry scaling factor Kl is determined 
according to the prototype size, wind tunnel test section size and sky level parameters; 
the Mach number Ma of the model should be consistent with the prototype, i.e., the 
scaling factor is 1; the dynamic compression ratio coefficient Kq and density scaling 
factor Kρ. For the static aeroelastic model, the scaling factor of structural parameters 
refers to the ratio of structural stiffness between the prototype and the model, and the 
large span ratio wing mainly includes the horizontal bending stiffness scaling factor 
of the wing section KEI and torsional stiffness scaling factor KGJ For the large span 
ratio wing, the horizontal bending stiffness scaling factor and the torsional stiffness 
scaling factor of the wing section are mainly included. 
8.2.3 Stiffness Design 
In this section, based on the model dimensions and structural stiffness distribu￾tion data obtained above, we detail the selection of a suitable structure and the 
determination of the corresponding dimensions to achieve the obtained stiffness 
distribution. 
1) Cross-sectional structure 
As mentioned above, the single wing consists of a single metal beam and a plastic 
shell. Due to the integrated structural characteristics of the plastic shell, its stiffness 
is not negligible and its contribution to the overall stiffness of the wing needs to be 
considered in the design. The internal structural solution of the wing selected for this 
project is shown in Fig. 8.4.
For the convenience of design and processing, the metal beam is selected with 
rectangular cross-section, and its shear center coincides with the shear center of 
the prototype wing section. For the integrated plastic shell, the shape geometry is 
obtained from the prototype according to the dimensional scaling factor, and the 
internal cavity is cavity to set the mounting surface of the metal beam. To improve 
the stiffness and strength of the shell, the vertical web is designed at the trailing edge 
position to divide the cavity into two independent closed forms. 
2) Cross-sectional dimensions 
As mentioned above, the horizontal bending stiffness EI (EI xx) and torsional stiffness 
GJ (GJzz) are distributed continuously along the spreading direction, and ideally, the 
structure to be designed should have exactly the same distribution continuously.166 8 Additive Manufacturing of Wind Tunnel Test Models for Static …
Fig. 8.4 Stiffness design of the wing section
In fact, for reasons of design complexity and processing economy, in engineering 
practice, a number of key sections are generally selected along the spreading direction 
to make the stiffness distribution reach the target value, and the structural dimensions 
of the key sections are approximated by the interpolation method. This method can 
ensure that the stiffness distribution of the critical section has high accuracy and 
the error of the interpolation part can be better controlled, and also ensure that 
the designed structure has good processability. As shown in Fig. 8.4 seven critical 
sections were selected along the wing span: one at the wing root and one at the 
wing tip, two at the sharp change in stiffness and three at the intermediate transition 
section. 
In order to complete the design of the model wing structure, the dimensions of 
the above structure need to be determined. In this project, the structural dimensions 
of the selected cross-section, including the position of the cross-sectional torsional 
center and the structural dimensions of the beam and the shell, are designed using 
an optimal design method. The position of the torsional center of the cross-section 
of the model includes the respective torsional centers of the metal beam and the 
plastic shell, which coincide with the torsional center of the prototype after scaling. 
The structural dimensions of the beam and shell are shown in Fig. 8.4, driven by the 
model geometric parameters section moment of inertia I and section torsion constant 
J. The horizontal bending stiffness EI and torsional stiffness GJ of each key section 
have been obtained in the scaled-down design stage. The optimized configuration is 
given by the following equation. 
minimize f (x) (8.1) 
The expression of the objective function is shown below as the error-weighted 
sum of three parts of the optimization objective: horizontal bending stiffness EI, 
torsional stiffness GJ and torsional center position SC. αEI , αGJ and αSC are the 
weighted amounts of each objective quantity, which are taken from the (0,1) open 
interval, respectively, and the sum is 1.8.2 Composite Model Design Method 167

where i is the serial number of the critical section and n is its total number, n = 7 
in this project; |E Ii|/|G Ji| is the absolute value of the error between the sum of 
horizontal bending stiffness/torsional stiffness of the metal beam and plastic shell of 
the ith critical section and the target value, and its expression is as follows: 
|E Ii| =

section can be obtained as

 (8.5) 
where SC includes the coordinate values in the x and y directions, as Fig. 8.84 is

The optimization variables include the amount of metal and the geometric 
parameters of the plastic housing, expressed as follows: 
x = 
xspar, xshell (8.6) 
where the structural dimensions of the metal beam include width s_w and height s_ 
h, as follows: 
xspar = (s_w,s_h) (8.7) 
The structural dimensions of the plastic housing include the mounting surface 
positioning coordinates m_x and height m_h, the web positioning coordinates w_x 
and thickness w_t, and the thickness of the leading and trailing edges of the housing 
l_t and t_t. Among them, the mounting surface height m_h is the same as the metal 
beam height s_h, and this variable can be incorporated into the beam. Therefore, the 
optimized variables for the plastic housing are as follows. 
xshell = (m_x, wx , wt ,l_t, t_t) (8.8) 
In order to obtain a reasonable solution, it is necessary to set a certain value 
interval for the optimization variables.168 8 Additive Manufacturing of Wind Tunnel Test Models for Static …
8.3 Case Studies 
8.3.1 Model Design 
The static aeroelastic model in this study is a 1/35-scale wing-body model of an 
airliner to simulate the stiffness distribution of the wing section of the prototype 
aircraft, to test the component deformation and aerodynamic response of the model 
under specific conditions, to determine the divergence conditions, and to provide 
basic data for aircraft prototype design. The structure of the model is shown in 
Fig. 8.2. 
1) Scaled down design 
The shape of the model can be obtained by simply scaling down the geometry of the 
prototype according to the dimensional reduction factor Kl The Mach number Ma 
and dynamic pressure parameter q in the wind tunnel flow field can be obtained by 
adopting the values used in the scaling design; as for the internal structure, a suitable 
structure can be designed according to the stiffness distribution, and the stiffness 
distribution is obtained from the prototype stiffness distribution and the stiffness 
scaling factor KEI /KGJ . The distribution of the horizontal bending stiffness EI along 
the spreading direction is shown in Fig. 8.2, and the torsional stiffness distribution 
GJ is calculated in a similar way. The scaling factors used in this project are shown 
in Table 8.1. 
2) Stiffness design 
In this section, based on the model dimensions and structural stiffness distribution 
data obtained above, the selection of a suitable structure and the determination of the 
corresponding dimensions to achieve the obtained stiffness distribution are detailed. 
The material property parameters used are as follows Table 8.2.
The internal structure of the wing chosen for this project is shown in Fig. 8.4. 
For design and processing convenience, a rectangular cross-section was chosen for 
the metal beam, whose shear center coincides with the shear center of the prototype 
wing section. For the integrated plastic shell, the shape geometry is obtained from 
the prototype according to the dimensional scaling factor, and the internal cavity is

a cavity with the mounting surface of the metal beam set. To improve the stiffness 
and strength of the shell, a vertical web is designed at the trailing edge position to 
divide the cavity into two independent closed forms. 
As mentioned above, the horizontal bending stiffness EI (EI xx) and the torsional 
stiffness GJ (GJzz) are distributed continuously along the spreading direction. As 
shown in Fig. 8.4, seven critical sections were selected along the wing span: one at 
the wing root and one at the wing tip, two at the sharp change in stiffness and three at 
the intermediate transition section. The horizontal bending stiffness EI and torsional 
stiffness GJ of each critical section have been obtained in the scaling design stage 
Table 8.2. The material modulus of elasticity E and shear modulus G are given, 
according to which the required section geometry parameters can be obtained. 
The result of the optimization calculation is shown in Fig. 8.5. Figure 8.5a gives 
the error of stiffness of each section, the error of horizontal bending stiffness is less 
than 5%, and the error of torsional stiffness is less than 2%, which is a small error 
level. From Fig. 8.5b, it can be seen that the metal skeleton stiffness is a proportion of 
the overall wing stiffness, and at the wing root, the plastic shell contributes a larger 
bending stiffness (about 15%) and torsional stiffness (about 25%). 
3) Detailed design 
The connection between the metal beam and the plastic shell needs to be designed 
to ensure a reliable and stable connection while minimizing the impact on the wing 
stiffness and taking into account the good machinability of the structure. In this book,

Fig. 8.6 Detailing of the model 
the connection is realized by designing the wing rib fixed section and step mounting 
surface, and the structure is schematically shown in Fig. 8.6. 
Two cross-sectional design beam ribs are selected in the middle section of the 
plastic housing for mounting metal beams. As shown in Fig. 8.6, four ribs protrude 
inward from the skin to fix the metal volume, and their dimensions are the same 
as those of the metal beam of the corresponding section to ensure the positioning 
accuracy. This wing rib fixing section ensures a precise and solid connection between 
the metal beam and the plastic shell, and achieves the transfer of bending and torsional 
forces between them. Along the wing span direction, the upper and lower parts of 
the shell and the beam are face fits, which increases the difficulty of machining 
and assembly. In this book, by setting grooves on the mating surface of the inner 
surface of the shell, a stepped mating surface is formed to reduce the mating area, 
and sufficient connection strength is ensured by designing the number and size of 
the grooves. 
8.3.2 Strength Simulation Calibration 
The model design must be strength calibrated, especially because the tensile strength 
of resin material is much smaller than that of metal material, and it is easy to deform or 
even fracture under large load conditions. In this book, CFD-CSD is used for strength 
check, and CFD is used to calculate the flow field for severe working conditions; the 
flow field load is loaded onto the corresponding part of the model, and CSD is used 
to calculate the static response.8.3 Case Studies 171

1) Pneumatic analysis 
The blowing test conditions to be carried out in this project are Mach number Ma 
from 0.4 to 0.65, angle of attack α from −4.0° to + 4.4° (angle of attack range varies 
depending on Mach number), because lift is the main load on the wing, and the angle 
of attack has a large impact on it, so the angle of attack with the maximum angle of 
attack is chosen as the calculation condition for the strength check, specifically Ma 
= 0.4, α = 4.4. Other aerodynamic parameters are shown in Table 8.3. 
The computational grid used for CFD calculations is shown in Fig. 8.7. Due to 
the symmetry of the model, a symmetry plane was set along the longitudinal plane 
of the aircraft fuselage to reduce the computational effort. The computational mesh 
is a tetrahedral unstructured mesh with a total number in the order of 1 million. 
The flow field model is given in Fig. 8.8, which was built with reference to the 
wind tunnel used, and the model was installed in the middle; one side of the flow 
field is the air inlet and three sides are the air outlet.
2) Strength calculation 
The computational model is simplified into three parts: plastic shell, metal wing beam 
and metal fuselage skeleton, except for the tangential slip connection (No separation, 
ANSYS® Workbench®) between the wing shell and beam, all other mating surfaces 
are fixed connections (Bonded, ANSYS® Workbench®), and fixed constraints and 
Y-directional displacement constraints are set on the model’s balance mounting The

model mesh is a hexahedral and tetrahedral structure mesh with a total number of 
cells in the order of 100,000. The above fluid results are loaded onto the surface of 
the model, and the obtained deformation and stress results are shown in Fig. 8.9. 
The wing of the hydro-elastic model is flexible and has the same shape as Fig. 8.9a 
shows a large deformation displacement; the maximum stresses are all on the wing, 
and the maximum equivalent stresses of the metal beam are located at the wing root, 
while the maximum stresses of the plastic shell occur at the wing tip, so the skin is 
thin (~0.5 mm) there. It should be noted that the maximum stresses of both metal 
and plastic of the model are smaller than the required stresses and can be safely used 
for wind tunnel tests.

Figure 8.10 shows that the first-order modal frequency of the model-balance-strut

8.3.4 Stiffness Calibration Test 
1) Test protocol 
The calibration object is a plastic shell-metal beam assembly. This project evaluates 
the accuracy of the stiffness design by comparing the measured values of the model 
after loading deformation with the simulated calculated values. The deformation 
measurement is performed by a non-contact optical measurement system (XJTUSD, 
Xi’an Jiaotong University), which is based on digital close-up industrial photography 
and calculates the 3D coordinates of key points of the object by taking multiple images 
of the object before and after deformation to obtain data of the object in each state. 
And the multiple states are collocated with each other by global points or correlation 
points, and the deformation amount and deformation direction of the deformation 
points between each state are displayed by 3D chromatography. 
Static deformation experimental platform as Fig. 8.11a, the measurement device 
is located above the test specimen (model wing). Figure 8.11b shows the clamping 
and loading scheme. The plastic housing is assembled to the metal frame and fixed 
to the table by a fixture located at the center axis of the fuselage; the fixture is made 
of aluminum, which is soft and can increase the contact area with the metal frame 
after being pretensioned to ensure a tight bond, so that the center axis of the model 
does not twist during loading. The weight block is set in the loading position of the 
wing through the metal frame; the metal frame is narrow, which can be approximated

2) Analysis of results 
For the simulation calculations, the same modeling approach is used as for the 
strength check. The measured and calculated values of the maximum deformation 
at four loadings are shown in Table 8.4, and the values are in good agreement with 
each other and the test values are large. 
The vertical component of the wing deformation during four loading times is 
shown in Fig. 8.12 along the spreading distribution, where the black point cloud is 
the experimental value, and the collection points include all three groups of marker 
points of leading edge, midline and trailing edge, and the red curve is the simulated 
value, and the spreading direction is collected along the rigid axis. In general, the 
test value is larger than the simulated value, and the stiffness of the finished model is 
smaller than the machined and assembled model. This may be caused by simulation 
modeling, design errors, material parameter deviations, differences in test boundary 
conditions and testing errors. However, the two are in the same trend of change and 
the maximum deviation is less than 5%, which is a good match and can meet the 
engineering needs.8.3 Case Studies 175
Fig. 8.12 Comparison of the results of the stiffness calibration test 
In summary, it can be seen from the deformation test that the designed and 
processed model has high similarity of stiffness and meets the design requirements. 
8.3.5 Wind Tunnel Test 
The purpose of this test is to calibrate the static aeroelasticity calculations and to 
verify the theoretical calculation method. The data measured by the balance system 
is processed to derive its lift curve, and the static aeroelastic design is checked by 
observing the Mach number at the point of transition on the lift curve and comparing 
it with model-specific data. 
The FL-24 transonic wind tunnel (test section size 1.2m × 1.2 m) was used; to 
simulate the real flight characteristics, the Mach number range was selected from 0.4 
to 0.65 in steps of 0.05; the aerodynamic performance of the model was measured at 
a specific Mach number with an angle of attack from −4° to + 6°, with emphasis on 
the twisting phenomenon of the wing surface. The surface of the model was polished 
to reduce additional frictional drag; the model was assembled and the assembly 
holes on the surface were filled with putty; the model was attached to the connecting 
rod and fixed to the balance mechanism. The wind tunnel test program is shown in

8.4 Analysis and Discussion 
8.4.1 Technology Availability 
From the experimental phenomenon, it can be observed that the twist of the airfoil 
becomes more and more obvious with the increase of Mach number, and the subse￾quent data processing can be obtained that the lift-to-drag ratio curve has an obvious 
decreasing trend from Mach number 0.6–0.65, which is basically consistent with the 
twist dispersion rate of the actual vehicle. 
For a flat wing with no operational rudder surface, the main phenomena of the 
aeroelastic static problem are torsional divergence and load redistribution, which can 
be analyzed using the classical binary airfoil segment model [90].

Equation (8.9) is the torsional dispersion condition, and Eq. (8.10) is the lift 
expression when the wing undergoes elastic torsion. When the dispersion condition 
(8.9) is satisfied, the denominator of Eq. (8.10) tends to zero and the lift tends to 
infinity. And when the dynamic pressure q is smaller than the dispersion dynamic 
pressure, the denominator of (8.10) is greater than 0, and the lift force has a definite 
value, and the lift force will change with the dynamic pressure. A larger lift will 
result in a larger torsional moment and a more violent torsional deformation of the 
wing. When the unstable twist of the wing occurs, with the increase of the angle of 
approach, the airflow separation point of the surface layer of the wing moves forward 
and forms a larger turbulent area after separation, the aircraft lift is reduced and the 
differential pressure drag increases significantly. When the Mach number from 0.4 to 
0.6, the lift coefficient CL changes with the Mach number and the angle of approach,8.4 Analysis and Discussion 177
and the relationship between them is linear, when the Mach number changes from 
0.6 to 0.65, although the lift coefficient also changes with the Mach number and the 
angle of approach, when the linear correlation decreases significantly. Especially, the 
drag coefficient CD has a tendency to rise rapidly when the Mach number varies from 
0.6 to 0.65, indicating that, at this time, the airfoil boundary layer separation point 
moves forward, forming a larger differential pressure drag. Also the relationship 
between the lift-to-drag ratio curve and Mach number can verify the existence of 
this process. In summary, it can be inferred that the torsional phenomenon intensifies 
between Mach number 0.6 and 0.65. The torsional dispersion velocity is roughly 
in this interval segment. The experimental simulation of a model with torsional 
dispersion velocity in this interval, and the experimental results are close to it. The 
feasibility of manufacturing a static aeroelastic model with similar stiffness based on 
light-curing printing technology was verified from the experimental point of view. 
8.4.2 Technical Limitations 
1) Subjects of the case study 
The object of study is a regional airliner, 24.7 m long, 29.2 m wingspan, 8.85 m height, 
conventional aerodynamic layout, non-swept-back trapezoidal wing, T-shaped tail, 
design maximum takeoff weight 21,800 kg, maximum cruise speed 514 km/h, 
medium load, high requirements for flight safety; the model in this book is the 
airliner’s wing model, excluding the T-shaped tail, rudder surface adjustment, and 
only simulates the wing stiffness; the test wind tunnel is the FL-24 transonic wind 
tunnel of China Aerodynamic Research and Development Center, with a test section 
size of 1.2 m × 1.2 m and medium size; the test Mach number range is from 0.4 to 
0.65, and the angle of attack range is from −4° to + 6°, including the flight enve￾lope. Therefore, the case study made in this chapter is typical and can be used as a 
reference for other tests of the same type. 
2) Multi-material stiffness design method 
The traditional metal beam-wooden frame segment (single or double beam) struc￾ture, the beam simulates the stiffness of the wing, and the stiffness of the wooden 
frame segment is negligible, therefore, the stiffness design of the model only needs 
to consider the structural parameters of the beam; the stiffness of the SL resin of 
the integrated aerodynamic shell is larger, and in order to achieve a higher accu￾racy of stiffness simulation, this book adopts the design method of resin-metal 
composite stiffness, and the stiffness calibration test shows that the composite struc￾ture designed by the The stiffness check test shows that the composite structure 
designed by this method can achieve high precision bending stiffness simulation. 
However, the resin-metal joint stiffness needs to be taken into account for the imple￾mentation of the complex elastic model using this method. In order to reduce the 
calculation difficulty of resin-metal connection stiffness, the structure design avoids178 8 Additive Manufacturing of Wind Tunnel Test Models for Static …
glue joints, bolts and other firm but difficult to accurately simulate connections, 
which is feasible for the validation model with medium size and simple structure 
in this chapter, but in engineering practice, a large number of models have larger 
size, more detailed stiffness simulation and reuse many times, so there are higher 
requirements for the connection reliability between model parts that More complex 
interface processing is involved; from the perspective of optimization design, it 
actually increases the optimization objectives and optimization variables, and the 
design difficulty increases, requiring consideration of more complex model struc￾tures (such as increasing the cross-sectional parameters of metal beams) and more 
refined optimization algorithms.Chapter 9 
Additive Manufacturing of Wind Tunnel 
Test Models for Dynamic Aeroelastic 
Properties 
9.1 Overview 
Dynamically-scaled models (DSMs) are used in wind tunnel tests to study the flutter 
characteristics and other dynamic aeroelastic properties of aircraft or their compo￾nents [67]. Dynamically-scaled models are a class of models used in wind tunnel 
tests. To facilitate the mapping of model data from wind tunnel tests to aircraft in 
real flight conditions, wind tunnels are designed and wind tunnel tests are conducted 
according to similarity laws [68]. The important similarity laws are as follows: (1) 
Geometry similarity: the similarity of model and prototype aerodynamic shape to 
ensure the similarity of flow field, applicable to all types of models; (2) Stiffness 
similarity: the similarity of model and prototype structural stiffness distribution. (2) 
Stiffness similarity: the similarity of stiffness distribution between the model and the 
prototype to ensure the similarity of the structural response of the model, which is 
applicable to the elastic model; (3) Mass similarity: the similarity of mass distribution 
between the model and the prototype to ensure the similarity of the mass characteris￾tics of the model, which is applicable to the dynamic model. It is a common practice 
to select the most influential similarity criterion according to the test purpose, for 
example, the Static aeroelastic model does not need to satisfy the mass similarity; 
however, some types of models require high similarity and need to satisfy all the 
above similarity criteria, such as the dynamic similarity model [69]. However, there 
are some types of models that require high similarity and need to satisfy all the above 
similarity criteria, such as dynamic similarity models, in which the flutter test is used, 
called flutter models.

179180 9 Additive Manufacturing of Wind Tunnel Test Models for Dynamic …
The design and fabrication of dynamically similar models is usually based on 
metals, and the high modulus of the material makes it very difficult to ensure structural 
similarity while maintaining similar stiffness [70]. The high modulus of the material 
makes it very difficult to ensure structural similarity while maintaining similar stiff￾ness. In order to prioritize the stiffness similarity of the model, the internal structure 
is usually simplified to neutralize the “overstiffness” caused by the high modulus of 
the model material, thus sacrificing the structural similarity. At the same time, the 
machining of metal models using traditional machining techniques (represented by 
CNC machines) requires long cycle times and high costs [6, 18]. The researcher has 
tried to use low-modulus metal models. Researchers have tried to use non-metallic 
materials with low modulus [70, 71], such as resin matrix composites, to design 
and fabricate dynamically similar models with partially similar structures. These 
studies have demonstrated that non-metallic materials can be used as an alterna￾tive to metallic materials to process dynamically similar, but without the support of 
advanced processing techniques, the design and processing complexity of the models 
are not effectively simplified, thus limiting the use of structurally similar modeling 
techniques. Therefore, it is necessary to follow the new advances in material science 
and manufacturing technology to find advanced technologies that can efficiently 
process complex low-modulus materials, so as to develop new methods for designing 
and manufacturing structurally similar dynamically similar models. However, these 
studies have focused on rigid wind tunnel test models, a class of models that only 
need to simulate aerodynamic shapes, while less research has been reported on the 
direct use of SL materials as a substitute for metals to machine dynamically similar 
models. In other fields outside of aerospace, researchers have used 3D printing to 
process all-plastic dynamically similar models to predict the dynamic properties of 
metal prototypes [72, 73]. Validation experiments have shown that plastic materials 
processed by the SL process can be approximately homogeneous, and their mate￾rial properties are independent of the processing parameters (e.g., print orientation), 
which can be used to predict the dynamic properties of metallic structures [74]. The 
material properties are independent of the process parameters (e.g., print orientation) 
and can be used to predict the dynamic properties of metal structures. 
In addition to satisfying similarity criteria such as geometric similarity, stiffness 
similarity and mass similarity, an ideal dynamically similar model should also simu￾late the force transmission path of the prototype, which requires structural similarity 
of internal force transmission components to ensure. Structural similarity is a broad 
concept that refers to the similarity of internal and external structures between the 
model and the prototype, where the external structural similarity is the similarity 
of the aerodynamic shape and the internal structure includes the similarity of struc￾tural stiffness, mass, and force transmission paths. Researchers have tried to use 
low modulus non-metallic materials [70, 71] to design and fabricate partially struc￾turally similar dynamic similarity models. These studies have demonstrated that non￾metallic materials can be used as an alternative to metallic materials to process the 
dynamic similarity, but the lack of support from advanced processing technologies 
has resulted in the failure to effectively simplify the design and processing complexity9.1 Overview 181
of the models, thus limiting the widespread use of structural similarity modeling tech￾niques. On the one hand, the light-curing process SL has a strong ability to process 
complex internal and external structures, which is suitable for the fabrication of 
wind tunnel products with complex shapes and internal structures (complex force 
transfer structures); on the other hand, the plastic materials processed have small 
elastic modulus and sufficient strength, which provides the possibility of structural 
similarity and stiffness similarity in the design of dynamically similar models. 
This chapter proposes a new method for the design and fabrication of structurally 
similar dynamically similar models based on additive manufacturing technology, 
which is capable of processing models with similarity in shape, stiffness, and internal 
structure, while effectively reducing the cycle time and cost of wind tunnel test model 
design and fabrication with the high efficiency of light-curing printing technology 
processing. The chapter will detail the principles and key technologies of the new 
method and use a case study to demonstrate the feasibility of this technology. 
The technical scheme of this chapter is shown in Fig. 9.1. The dynamic charac￾teristics of the aluminum alloy prototype were obtained by the finite unit method 
calculation, and the target data were obtained after the scaling design. In order to 
verify the validity of the model design and processing, a modal test was conducted 
on the resin model, and the actual data obtained from the test was compared with 
the target data to determine the degree of agreement between the two. At the same 
time, structural analysis was performed to verify the structural similarity between the 
prototype and the model; finally, the economics of the new method of model design 
and fabrication were also discussed.

9.2 Design of Structural Similarity Model 
As mentioned above, this section completes the design of a dynamically similar model 
with similar structure through three steps: dimensional scaling, stiffness optimization 
and mass optimization, with metal as the prototype material and plastic as the model 
material. 
9.2.1 Size Scaling 
This is the first step of the model design to obtain the initial structure and the exact 
aerodynamic shape of the internal structure of the model. The scaled external and 
internal dimensions of the prototype are scaled according to the geometric similarity 
coefficient, and the scaled external dimensions define the aerodynamic shape of the 
model and remain unchanged in the subsequent design to ensure “geometric simi￾larity”; the scaled internal dimensions define the initial state of the internal structure 
of the model, and the final dimensions are determined in the stiffness optimization 
and mass optimization. The scaled internal dimensions define the initial state of the 
internal structure of the model, and the final dimensions will be determined in the 
stiffness optimization and mass optimization, but the subsequent design keeps the 
topology of the initial state unchanged and only changes the size to ensure “structural 
similarity”. 
Table 9.1 lists the similar factors that need to be satisfied in the design of the 
dynamic similarity model. They are derived from the similarity theory [75]. The 
latter can be calculated based on the former, and the key to determine the similarity 
criteria is the basic criteria [19]. The key to determine the similarity criterion is 
the basic criterion. The dimensional similarity criterion is the scaling factor of the 
prototype and model structure size, which is the key parameter of the scaling design 
and is determined according to the prototype size, wind tunnel test section size and 
other parameters; the medium velocity and density similarity criterion is determined 
according to the real flight state and wind tunnel fluid related parameters; the Mach 
number Ma similarity criterion is 1:1 according to the similarity theory.
9.2.2 Stiffness Optimization 
This book adopts the Matrices of Elastic Influence Coefficients (MEIC) method for 
the design of model stiffness [69]. The stiffness is the deformation capacity of a 
structure to withstand a load. Stiffness is the deformation capacity of a structure to 
withstand a load, and its magnitude is measured by the deformation of the structure9.2 Design of Structural Similarity Model 183

under a certain load. Therefore, Stiffness similarity can be converted into Displace￾ment similarity for a specific direction under similar loads. The specific direction is 
determined according to the dynamic structural properties of the model, depending 
on the modalities of the first few orders of the model. 
The stiffness design is done automatically using optimization calculations with 
the following mathematical model:

minimize f (x)
subject to xl ≤ x ≤ xu (9.1) 
1) Objective function 
As mentioned above, similar stiffness is defined as similar deformation under similar 
loads, and therefore the deformation error is used as the objective function for 
optimization: 
f (x) = m
i=1 
n
j=1

(9.2) 
where m is the number of loadings, and n is the number of deformation calcula￾tion nodes, the δ and δ are the calculated and target deformations at a node under 
a particular load, respectively, and the latter can be calculated by the following 
equation: 
δ = δP · Kl (9.3) 
where δP is the amount of deformation of the prototype (Prototype) at a node, and 
Kl is the deformation similarity criterion.184 9 Additive Manufacturing of Wind Tunnel Test Models for Dynamic …
2) Optimization variables 
The optimization variables are the internal structural dimensions of the model, which 
define the size of the internal structure, while its topology (e.g., number of webs, 
ribs, boom trusses and interconnections) remains unchanged; the external dimen￾sions (length, width, height) of the model do not change during the optimization 
process (already determined in the dimensional scaling stage) to maintain geometric 
similarity. 
3) Control variables 
The control variables are set to make the optimization results reasonable and 
processable. 
9.2.3 Quality Optimization 
The motion control equation is as Eq: 
[M]{q¨(t)} + [C]{q˙(t)} + [K ]{q(t)} = F(t) (9.4) 
where [M], [C] and [K] are the generalized mass matrix, the generalized damping 
matrix and the generalized stiffness matrix; F(t) is the generalized load vector, which 
is zero for modal solutions; {q¨(t)}, {q˙(t)} and {q(t)} are the generalized acceleration 
vector, generalized velocity and generalized coordinates, respectively. 
The mass properties of the model refer to the total weight, center of mass position 
and rotational inertia of the model. One way of solving is to solve the model mass 
characteristics directly according to the prototype-related parameters and similarity 
criterion (as shown in Table 9.1); another way is to solve it indirectly according to the 
model structural characteristics. As shown in Eq. (9.2), the mass properties, damping 
properties and stiffness properties jointly determine the dynamic properties of the 
model According to the above discussion, the effect of damping properties can be 
neglected in this book, and Eq. (9.2) is simplified as follows 
[M]{q¨(t)} + [K ]{q(t)} = F(t) (9.5) 
That is, the mass characteristics and stiffness characteristics jointly determine 
the model dynamic characteristics, and the model dynamic characteristics can be 
characterized by the Eigen mode of the model. The eigenmodes of the model can be 
obtained from the eigenmodes of the prototype wing box segment with the corre￾sponding similarity criterion, while the stiffness characteristics of the model have 
been obtained from the stiffness optimization, so the mass characteristics can be 
inverse obtained from the known dynamic characteristics and stiffness characteris￾tics. Based on this, the mathematical model for mass optimization is established as 
follows:9.2 Design of Structural Similarity Model 185

minimize g(x)
subject to xl ≤ x ≤ xu (9.6) 
1) Objective function 
As mentioned above, the model mass characteristics are derived from the model 
dynamic characteristics and stiffness characteristics. In the mass optimization based 
on the above stiffness optimization, the resulting structure is used as the input data 
for this optimization and remains unchanged, and the stiffness characteristics are 
already reflected; as for the dynamic characteristics of the model, they are obtained 
from the characteristic modes (including characteristic frequencies and characteristic 
vibration patterns) of the prototype wing box section and the corresponding similarity 
criterion, and the vibration pattern similarity is naturally satisfied due to the similarity 
between the model and the prototype structure, and only the characteristic frequencies 
need to be considered. Therefore, the objective function can be defined as the error 
between the actual eigenfrequency of the model and the target frequency as follows: 
g(x) = m
j=1

ωj(x) − ωj 
ωj
2 
(9.7) 
where m is the order of the considered eigenfrequencies, the ω and ω are the actual 
and target frequencies of the model, respectively, the latter being obtained from the 
eigenfrequencies of the prototype (Prototype) and the frequency similarity criterion: 
ω = ωP · Kω (9.8) 
where ωP is the eigenfrequency of a certain order of the prototype, and Kω is the 
eigenfrequency similarity criterion. 
2) Optimization variables 
This book adjusts the mass characteristics of the model by means of the counterweight 
blocks (balance-weight). Where, the total weight of all the counterweight blocks Mb 
is obtained from the following equation: 
Mb = M − M0 (9.9) 
where M0 is the initial total weight of the model, which is the total amount of the 
model after the above stiffness optimization; M is the target total weight of the model, 
which is determined by the total weight of the prototype MP and the mass similarity 
criterion K M are obtained as follows: 
M = MP · KM (9.10)186 9 Additive Manufacturing of Wind Tunnel Test Models for Dynamic …
The number, position and weight of individual counterweight blocks can be used 
as optimization variables. 
3) Control variables 
The control variables are set to make the optimization results reasonable and 
processable.

The proposed test condition in this book is subsonic speed. The size similarity crite￾rion is the scaling factor of the prototype and model structure size, which is the key 
parameter of the scaling design, and is determined according to the prototype size, 
wind tunnel test section size and other parameters, and 1:5 is selected in this book; 
the similarity criterion of medium velocity and density is determined according to 
the real flight state and wind tunnel fluid related parameters, and 1:4 and 1:1 in this 
book respectively; according to the similarity theory, the Mach number Ma similarity 
criterion is 1:1, as shown in Table 9.2.

calculated and target deformations at a node under a specific load, respectively, and

the model, such as rib thickness (root, middle and slightly, 3 in total), skin thickness

than the slightest part, the minimum value of all dimensions should be larger than 
the minimum value allowed by the SL printing process (0.5 mm), etc.

model of the stiffness of the wing box section, and its optimization module is used 
to build an automatic design to implement Single Run, DV Sweep, and First-order 
optimization algorithms to find the optimum. 
3) Quality optimization 
The quality optimization model for this book is based on the above approach as 
follows:

actual and target frequencies of the model, respectively, the latter being obtained 
from the eigenfrequencies of the Prototype and the frequency similarity criterion: 
ω = ωP · Kω (9.14) 
where ωP is the eigenfrequency of a certain order of the prototype, and Kω is the 
eigenfrequency similarity criterion. 
(2) Optimization variables 
This book adjusts the mass characteristics of the model by means of the counterweight 
blocks (balance-weight). Where, the total weight of all the counterweight blocks Mb 
is obtained from the following equation: 
Mb = M − M0 (9.15) 
where M0 is the initial total weight of the model, which is the total amount of the 
model after the above stiffness optimization; M is the target total weight of the model, 
which is determined by the total weight of the prototype MP and the mass similarity 
criterion K M are obtained as follows: 
M = MP · KM (9.16) 
Considering the different load-bearing capacity of each structural part of the model 
(the counterweights should be installed at locations with high load-bearing capacity, 
such as the wing roots), the nodal line location of the target characteristic vibration 
pattern (the counterweights should be installed to avoid the extreme value of the 
vibration pattern nodal line to reduce the influence on the vibration pattern) and 
the convenience of the assembly operation (the counterweights should be installed 
at convenient locations for disassembly and assembly, such as the surface of the 
wing box), the book has selected the following Fig. 9.3 The 12 locations shown 
in Fig. 9.3 are chosen as the mounting points of the counterweight. Therefore, the 
number of counterweights and their locations have been determined, using the ratio 
of the weight of individual counterweights to the total counterweight weight as the 
optimization variable: 
x = (x1, x2,..., x12)
T (9.17) 
where x1, x2,..., x12 is the ratio of each counterweight block in the total counter￾weight, and takes a value in the range of (0, 1). 
(3) Control variables 
This book sets the minimum weight of a single counterweight block to 0.5g, and the 
maximum value is determined by the design and is not set separately.9.3 Case Studies 191
(4) Optimize implementation 
Similar to the stiffness optimization, the MASS21 element in ANSYS® is used to 
build the mass finite element model of the wing box section, and its optimization 
module is used to build the automatic design, which implements the Single Run, 
DV Sweep and First-order optimization algorithms to find the optimum. The quality 
characteristics of the optimized parameters are shown in Table 9.3. 
9.3.3 Model Processing 
1) Model body structure 
The main structure of the model refers to the load-bearing structure of the model, 
which is the result of the stiffness optimization design and does not include the 
counterweight section. The designed wing box section was processed by SL process 
with SPS600B equipment and SOMOS®14,120 (DSM Corp.) material. The CAD 
data of the model was created according to the optimized design results, the SL 
process parameters were selected, and the model was imported into the SL machine 
for processing, and the required solid model was obtained after cleaning and grinding. 
The fine dimensions of the main structure of the model are shown in Fig. 9.5 They 
are mainly concentrated in the wing tip area, including the thickness of the trailing 
edge web (web-T. E.), the thickness of the upper skin (skin-top), the thickness of 
the wing tip rib (rib-tip), the width and height of the bottom boom truss (string￾bottom), the thickness of the leading edge (web-L. E.) and the thickness of the lower 
skin (skin-bottom), etc. The smallest dimension is 0.5 mm for the boom truss width, 
which is within the printing capability of the SL process (the minimum processing 
size is about 0.5 mm). As shown in the figure, most of these structures are located in 
the closed inner cavity of the wing box, which is difficult to achieve by mechanical 
processing methods and requires the SL technology with internal structure processing 
capability.
The selection of process parameters is a key technology for SL processing, in 
which most of the process parameters are selected with preset values (such as layered 
thickness, laser power, scanning speed, etc.), and the selection of printing direction 
needs to be focused on. Because the model in this book is a cavity structure, too 
much internal process support will bring about the loss of dimensional accuracy and 
surface quality of the inner cavity, such as the fine structure of the wing tip area 
(as Fig. 9.5), therefore, the internal support needs to be reduced or eliminated by 
optimizing the printing direction. 
As shown in Fig. 9.6 the internal support is a process structure used to prevent 
the top structure of the part from deforming or even collapsing due to gravity. For 
cavity structures that require high internal surface accuracy and are not easily post￾processed, the internal support needs to be reduced or even avoided altogether by 
optimizing the print orientation. For slender cavity structures with an advantageous 
length, increasing the print angle (the angle between the length of the part and the192 9 Additive Manufacturing of Wind Tunnel Test Models for Dynamic …

structure, but increases the printing time due to the elongation of the print height. 
Therefore, the optimal print orientation needs to be chosen to minimize the internal 
support while keeping the print time to a minimum.

This book uses the above method to select the optimal printing direction to ensure 
that there is no internal process support, and the printing direction is about 30° from 
the wingspan angle, as Fig. 9.7 shown. 
2) Counterweight structure 
As shown in Fig. 9.8, the counterweight material is lead, and the positioning structure 
is printed directly by SL and installed by 502 glue joint. The choice of counterweight 
material is examined in terms of density, processability, elastic modulus and price. In 
order to reduce the impact on the stiffness of the box section members, the density of 
the counterweight material should be large enough to reduce the assembly surface, 
while its elastic modulus should be as close as possible to that of the main structure; 
at the same time, the counterweight material should also have good processability 
and low cost. Lead has a large density (11.34 g/cm3, second only to tungsten among 
the commonly used high-density materials), and its modulus of elasticity is close to 
that of SL plastic (16 GPa) compared with other high-density materials (tungsten, 
brass, etc.), and it has better processability and lower cost, therefore, lead is chosen 
as the counterweight material in this book.

The counterweight block is the carrier for providing counterweight. The design 
of counterweight block structure not only meets the counterweight requirements, 
but also takes into account the processability and ensures the connection with the 
box section model. For the convenience of processing, the counterweight block is 
designed as a hexahedral block structure, and the connection is made by using the 
counterweight block inlay positioning glue bonding scheme, and the connection 
surface is set to insert the tab structure, as shown in Fig. 9.8. The positioning accu￾racy of the counterweight has an important impact on the simulation accuracy and 
is a difficult point for the traditional fluttering model manufacturing, but the SL 
technology provides a new solution for the high-precision positioning structure. In 
this book, the ANSYS optimized coordinates of the counterweight are imported into 
CAD design software, and the positioning structure is designed with this in mind (as 
shown in Fig. 9.8), and finally, the counterweight positioning structure is manufac￾tured with high precision by direct manufacturing with SL. Due to the pre-fabrication 
of the assembly surface in the main structure, the installation of the counterweight 
is also greatly simplified. 
9.3.4 Verification of Stiffness Characteristics 
The accuracy of the stiffness design is evaluated by comparing the measured values of 
the model after loading deformation with the simulated calculated values. The defor￾mation measurement is performed by a non-contact optical measurement measure￾ment system (XJTUSD, Xi’an, China), which is based on digital close-up industrial 
photography and calculates the 3D coordinates of key points of the object by taking 
multiple images of the object before and after deformation to obtain data of the 
object in each state. And the multiple states are combined with each other by global 
points or related points, and the deformation amount and deformation direction of 
the deformation points between each state are displayed by 3D chromatography. 
The test scheme is shown in Fig. 9.9. The machined model (without counter￾weight) is fixed on the measuring table by a custom-made fixture, and a weight 
with a load of 20 N is fixed on the slight part of the model by an iron hook, and the 
measuring points are distributed as follows Fig. 9.9. Figure 9.9b shows the simulation 
analysis model.

The measured and simulated values of model deformation under the same working 
conditions are shown in Fig. 9.10a, b show. It can be easily obtained that the deforma￾tion distribution is consistent, and the maximum deformation occurs at the slight part, 
and the error is small (about 3%), so it can be inferred that the stiffness distribution 
of the finished model matches with the expectation and the SL has high machining 
accuracy.196 9 Additive Manufacturing of Wind Tunnel Test Models for Dynamic …
9.3.5 Dynamic Characterization Verification 
In this book, the dynamic characteristics of the box segment model are measured 
by modal tests, and the results are compared with the target values (obtained by the 
prototype and similarity criterion) to analyze whether the manufactured SL plastic 
box segment model meets the design requirements and can be used for the estimation 
of the characteristic parameters of the metal prototype, in order to verify the feasibility 
of the method proposed in this book. Based on a scanning laser vibrometer (PSV￾400, Polytec) with non-contact measurement, the book establishes the following. 
The plastic box segment is mounted on the measurement base with a customized 
fixture, and the measuring marker is pre-set on the top skin and L. E. web of the box 
segment. The measuring apparatus is set up on the upper part of the model to scan the 
measuring points and obtain the dynamic characteristics (characteristic frequencies 
and characteristic vibration patterns in this book) of the SL plastic box section after 
processing (FFT, etc.). 
The results of the modal measurements are sensitive to the boundary conditions, 
including the assembly of the specimen components and the fixed mounting of the 
specimen. For the fixed mounting of the specimen, a steel fixture was designed as 
shown in Fig. 9.12. The fixture is designed to ensure the fixed connection of the 
plastic cassette at the wing root on the one hand, and to allow the top skin and L. 
E. web of the cassette to face upward vertically towards the scanner head of the 
vibrometer after mounting to the measurement substrate on the other hand.

As mentioned above, the plastic wing box section of this specimen includes two 
types of components: the main structure and the counterweight block. Since the load￾bearing capacity of each part of the main structure was considered in the design of the 
counterweight position and the extreme value point of the first 2 orders of character￾istic vibration pattern was avoided, the design requirements were satisfied by using 
502 instantaneous dry glue to assemble and connect the parts. The corresponding 
counterweights are fixed in the way shown in Figs. 9.8 and 9.12. 
The measured time domain vibration signal is transformed to frequency by FFT 
to obtain the dynamic characteristics of the box section. Figure 9.13 gives the first 
2 orders of eigenfrequencies and eigenvibrations of the plastic box section. The 
comparison results of the eigenfrequencies are shown in Table 9.4, where the actual 
values are obtained from this experiment, and the target values are obtained from the 
characteristic parameters of the aluminum box segment and the similar criterion. 
The first 2 orders of characteristic vibration patterns of the box section are up and 
down bending oscillation and left and right bending oscillation, which are obtained 
by scanning the upper skin and the leading edge web, respectively, from Fig. 9.13 
The actual and target values of the vibration patterns are similar, as can be seen in 
Table 9.4 It is easy to obtain that the actual and target values are in good agreement.

obtaining the dynamic aeroelastic parameters of the metal prototype aircraft in the 
wind tunnel [44, 46]. 
9.4 Analysis and Discussion 
9.4.1 Structural Similarity Analysis 
Figure 9.14 shows the internal structure of the aluminum box segment prototype and 
the plastic box segment model. 
By comparing the internal structures of the aluminum box section prototype and 
the plastic box section model, it can be seen that both have the same topology and 
similar force transfer characteristics, so the power similar resin model designed in 
this book achieves structural similarity. In contrast, the metal dynamically similar 
model requires a lot of simplification of the internal structure of the prototype, which 
makes it difficult to achieve structural similarity [19]. Therefore, the proposed design 
and fabrication method of plastic dynamically similar model based on SL process 
in this book can make the simulation degree of dynamically similar model further 
compared with the traditional metal mechanical processing method. 
Compared to metals, resins have a smaller modulus of elasticity, and the impli￾cations of this for model design are discussed below. Without loss of generality, a 
hollow rectangular beam is chosen as the object in this book to analyze the reasons
Fig. 9.14 Internal structure of the aluminum box segment prototype and plastic box segment model 9.4 Analysis and Discussion 199
why the resin model can achieve structural similarity. The structure and dimensions 
of the prototype beam are shown in and include five parameters: length (l), width 
(w), height (h), and wall thickness in the width direction (thick-X, tx) and height 
direction (thick-Y, ty). 
According to the design method of dynamic similar model, the hollow rectangular 
beam dynamic similar models of SL plastic and aluminum alloy are designed with w, 
tx and ty as optimization variables (h and l scaling ratio are designed to be unchanged 
to keep geometric similarity), and their structures and dimensions are shown in and 
respectively. 
1) Similar structure 
From Fig. 9.15 and Table 9.5 it can be seen that the SL resin model has the same 
topology as the prototype, and at the same time the structural dimensions are machin￾able, so the structural similarity of the dynamically similar model can be achieved 
based on the SL process. On the contrary, the minimum wall thickness ty = 0.05 mm 
of the aluminum alloy model obtained by the structural similarity design is not 
economically machinable, and in order to realize the dynamic similarity, only the 
internal structure, such as the I-beam, can be changed, thus losing the structural 
similarity. Taking the bending stiffness EI As an example, the reason for this result 
is argued. According to the similarity theory, the stiffness similarity criterion KEI 
can be expressed as follows 
KEI = KE · KI (9.18)
From the above equation, if the stiffness similarity coefficient is certain, the simi￾larity coefficient of the material stiffness parameter (here is the modulus of elasticity

KE ) is inversely related to the similarity coefficient of structural geometric parame￾ters (here, the moment of inertia of the cross-section KI ) is inversely related, i.e., a 
softer model material implies a larger model structure size. SL plastics have a lower 
modulus of elasticity than aluminum alloys, so models made from them have a larger 
cross-sectional wall thickness. 
The low modulus of the material is necessary to ensure the structural similarity of 
the dynamically similar model but also requires the support of processing technology 
printing capability. Bing-Shan Liu et al. designed and fabricated a box-section model 
of the wing based on low-modulus composite materials. The modal experiments show 
that the error range between the actual and target values of the first 2 orders of special 
diagnostic frequencies of this box-segment model is 4% ~ 15%, while the error of 
this book is less than 2%. This is because the SL process has a strong capability of 
printing internal and external structures, and is able to maintain a high machining 
accuracy for parts with irregular shapes and complex force transfer structures such 
as aircraft models, which is difficult to achieve with conventional processes. 
In conclusion, the low modulus of elasticity of the materials used in SL and 
its powerful printing capability ensure the structural similarity of the dynamically 
similar model. 
2) Weight reduction 
From Table 9.5 it can be obtained that the total weight of the counterweight of 
the aluminum model is 15.4 g, which is much larger than the 1.3 g of its main 
structure, and the former is about 11.9 times of the latter, which makes the design 
and installation of the counterweight very difficult. On the contrary, the counterweight 
of the SL resin model is much smaller than its its main structure weight, which is 
only 0.1 times of the latter and almost negligible. Theoretically, zero counterweight 
can be achieved by fine-tuning the dimensional similarity factor (1:5 neighborhood).9.4 Analysis and Discussion 201
9.4.2 Technical Limitations 
1) Subjects of the case study 
The object of this chapter is a box section without aerodynamic shape, and the 
correctness of the model implementation method is verified by means of modal 
testing. The box section is the main load-bearing member of the main wing of the 
aircraft, which plays a decisive role in the structural performance of the wing and the 
dynamic characteristics of the aircraft, so it is a representative object for the study; 
the modal test can be used to test the structural dynamic characteristics of the model, 
which is an inevitable step of the dynamic wind tunnel test.. However, the following 
research work is still needed to use the full SL resin dynamic model for the real 
aircraft wind tunnel test. 
Strength design of all-SL resin model: A research team has designed a non￾metallic dynamic model and conducted modal tests to verify that non-metallic mate￾rials can be used in the design of aircraft dynamic models.. A low modulus composite 
material was used in this study, which is similar to the SL resin used in this chapter 
in terms of elastic modulus and mechanical strength. However, no validation of wind 
tunnel tests was seen in this study, so the feasibility of non-metallic in wind tunnel 
tests still needs further study. One of the central questions is whether the strength of 
the non-metallic material is sufficient. Other research work in this book (see Chap. 5) 
shows that the all-resin F4 standard model is still safe at Ma0.8 in the FL-21 tran￾sonic wind tunnel (test section 0.6 m × 0.6 m), which provides a good basis for the 
subsequent research in this chapter. 
Processing study of full SL resin model: The dynamic model is sensitive to the 
structural parameters of the model, so SL equipment is required to be able to process 
the complete model components at one time, such as processing a single wing at 
one time. Domestic commonly used transonic wind tunnel FL-24 (test Sect. 1.2m 
× 1.2 m) and FL-26 (test section 2.4 m × 2.4 m), the maximum size of the model 
used in the former is about 0.6 m ~ 0.8 m, and the latter is about 1.0 m ~ 1.5 m. The 
current processing size of mainstream SL printing equipment is in the order of 1 m 
[15] At present, the processing size of mainstream SL printing equipment is in the 
order of 1m, such as 3D system’s iPro 9000XL SL equipment with a maximum print 
envelope of 1.5 m × 0.75 m × 0.55 m, and Xi’an Jiaotong University’s SPS600B SL 
equipment with a maximum processing envelope of 0.6 m × 0.6 m × 0.45 m. The 
existing processing capacity can barely meet the requirements, but the country still 
needs to step up the development of large-capacity SL printing equipment in order 
to avoid being restricted in the key technology. 
2) Efficiency issues of model design methods 
The model design in this chapter is realized by the optimization calculation method. 
Because of the simple structure of the wing box itself and the simplification of the 
target vibration type selection (only the first two orders are taken), the optimization 
algorithm that comes with ANSYS can obtain satisfactory convergence results after a 
relatively short calculation time (about 100 calculation steps), which is sufficient for202 9 Additive Manufacturing of Wind Tunnel Test Models for Dynamic …
the research object of this chapter. However, the design problem of a real full-engine 
fluttering model is more complex and involves more counting optimization variables, 
and the optimization algorithm embedded in ANSYS appears to be less efficient. 
Therefore, special optimization algorithms need to be developed in order to improve 
the efficiency and accuracy of optimal design. Optimization design algorithms in the 
scope of structural dimensions at home and abroad have been developed to a more 
mature stage, and some researchers have conducted special algorithms for the design 
of flutter models, which can be referred to. 
The torsional mode is an important inherent property of the wing, and the first 
two orders of the box section studied in this chapter do not involve torsion, so 
the torsional stiffness is not considered in the model stiffness design. In addition, 
the mass-similarity design in this chapter is based on the assumption that modal 
similarity and structural similarity automatically achieve modal similarity based on 
the joint determination of vibration similarity and solid frequency similarity. In a strict 
sense, this assumption needs to be tested. Therefore, the subsequent work should 
add the function of vibration similarity design and use the deformation extraction 
function of ANSYS to automatically obtain the nodal line information and optimize 
the calculation for its location configuration.Chapter 10 
Additive Manufacturing of Wind Tunnel 
Test Models with Pre-deformation 
10.1 Overview 
The wings of large transport aircraft generally have a large span to chord ratio, 
and the wing tip deformation under cruise conditions can reach the meter level. 
The huge difference in aerodynamic shape of the wing in different flight conditions 
makes it more difficult to accurately predict the aerodynamic performance of the 
aircraft and design accordingly, making this technology one of the key technologies 
for designing highly reliable and efficient large transport aircraft. In the conceptual 
design stage, a lot of calculations and experimental work are required in this regard. 
The computational techniques represented by multidisciplinary optimal design and 
fluid–structure coupling simulation technologies can help to solve many aerodynamic 
and structural mechanics problems in aircraft design [55] However, for higher-order 
aerodynamics and structural mechanics problems at high speeds, they can be used to 
solve the aerodynamic problems. However, for higher-order nonlinear aerodynamic 
problems (e.g., large deformations) at high speeds, wind tunnel testing techniques 
are widely considered to have higher reliability [58]. A series of rigid models of the 
aircraft and a static-elastic model are usually used in conducting wind tunnel tests. To 
improve the reliability of the data, the test data are first properly corrected, as shown 
in Fig. 10.1. The purpose of the static-elastic correction is to eliminate the data bias 
caused by the inevitable deformation of the rigid model during the blowing process. 
Of course, the correction process builds on the theoretical basis and a large amount of 
empirical data, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive, but indispensable under 
the current wind tunnel test program. Improvements in the design and processing 
techniques of wind tunnel test models can provide new implementations of existing 
wind tunnel tests that have the potential to improve this situation.
Because of its high accuracy and reliability, machining technology (represented by 
numerical control, NC) is the basis for the design and manufacturing of wind tunnel 
test models at present. However, recent advances in material science and processing 
technology have opened up the possibility of new model processing technologies,

among which 3D printing (Additive Manufacturing, 3D printing) technology is the 
representative [7, 76]. The most recent advances in materials science and processing 
technology have opened up the possibility of new model processing technologies, 
including 3D printing (Additive Manufacturing). This technology was introduced 
into the manufacturing of wind tunnel test models at the early stage of development 
because of its powerful ability to process complex structures, and its feasibility has 
been fully demonstrated [12, 32, 33]. The feasibility of this technology has been 
well proven. However, the materials used in high-precision 3D printing processes 
are mostly non-metallic, represented by epoxy plastics. Because of the low strength 
and low modulus of these materials, the effectiveness of this technology in the manu￾facture of high-speed wind tunnel test models has been widely doubted, and for this 
reason various methods have been developed to strengthen the models made by 3D 
printing [21, 30, 55]. These researches are based on the idea of These studies are 
based on the idea that the weak mechanical properties of non-metallic materials used 
for 3D printing are a deficiency that needs to be avoided and overcome in the design 
and fabrication of wind tunnel test models. However, if a different viewpoint is taken 
and the characteristics of non-metallic materials are fully utilized, this “deficiency” 
may be transformed into an “advantage” and a completely new technical solution for 
wind tunnel testing may be developed as a result. In terms of mechanical strength, it 
is theoretically feasible to use non-metallic materials for the wind tunnel test model, 
considering that the stress on the model decreases dramatically after the size reduc￾tion, and the lower modulus of elasticity of non-metallic materials gives the model 
a higher deformation capacity, which allows it to deform as much as a real aircraft 
with a large span ratio. In addition, it is shown that the lower modulus of elasticity 
allows the model to retain a force transfer structure similar to that of a real aircraft. 
This is not possible for models machined from metal. At the same time, plastic10.2 Pre-deformation Design 205
materials have high damping, which is important for improving the safety of wind 
tunnel tests and the efficiency of data collection. The high damping characteristics 
of the material can reduce the model vibration during the blowing process, which 
helps to improve safety; meanwhile, the high damping allows the model to return 
to the stable position faster under the initial vibration, which reduces the acquisi￾tion waiting time and thus improves the data acquisition efficiency. In addition, the 
development of the integration of computational and experimental fluid dynamics 
also provides a basis for reassessing and improving existing aircraft model design 
and manufacturing techniques [1]. 
This book proposes a new technology for the design and fabrication of an aircraft 
wind tunnel test model with a large span-to-string ratio based on light-curing printing 
technology, providing a new wind tunnel test solution for the conceptual design of 
large aircraft. In this chapter, a flexible model with "initial negative deformation" 
is designed, which is deformed to the desired aerodynamic shape of the test during 
the blowing process under the load—the target shape—compared to the rigid model 
(metal). Compared with the rigid model (metal), this model can eliminate the correc￾tion of the elasticity effect of the metal model, and is closer to the actual aircraft 
in flight, achieving “deformation similarity”. This chapter details the principles of 
this technique, addresses the key technologies involved, and uses a case study to 
demonstrate the feasibility of the approach. 
10.2 Pre-deformation Design 
10.2.1 Flexible Model 
A large number of wind tunnel tests use rigid models. These models are generally 
made of high elastic modulus materials (e.g., steel, aluminum, etc.), but during the 
blowing process, the model inevitably deforms, as shown in Fig. 10.2. 
Fig. 10.2 Deformation of 
the rigid and elastic models 
in the test [43]206 10 Additive Manufacturing of Wind Tunnel Test Models with Pre-deformation
Since the model is assumed not to be deformed, the original contour of the model 
is the target contour, but under aerodynamic loading, the initial contour is deformed 
to the actual contour, thus deviating from the target contour. In order to eliminate the 
influence of model deformation on data accuracy, the collected data are generally 
subjected to correction of deformation. 
In order to avoid the extra cost and time consuming and possible risk of accu￾racy loss caused by deformation correction, a flexible model with “initial negative 
deformation” can be designed, and the blowing process will deform to the desired 
aerodynamic shape under the action of the load—the target shape, eliminating the 
deformation correction and directly obtaining the test data under the shape. In the 
process of blowing, the air is deformed to the desired aerodynamic shape under the 
load—the target shape, eliminating the deformation correction, and directly obtain 
the test data under the shape. As shown in Fig. 10.2, the model with “negative defor￾mation” of the initial shape, the actual shape after deformation under the aerodynamic 
load and the target shape coincide. 
Machining techniques to support complex stiffness distribution models and calcu￾lation methods to obtain initial negative deformations are the key technologies of this 
new method. The rigid model requires sufficient stiffness and qualitative accuracy, 
while the flexible model requires quantitative stiffness distribution to a specific design 
value (similar to the aeroelastic model), which requires higher design methods and 
machining techniques. If the traditional rigid model uses the CNC machine tool-based 
processing technology, the cost and cycle time will be greatly increased, offsetting 
the benefits of the flexible model from deformation correction, which is not econom￾ically feasible. At the same time, the traditional model processing material is mainly 
metal, its elastic modulus is large, compared with low modulus material, its deforma￾tion range is smaller, the same pneumatic load, the pre-deformation is smaller. The 
development of 3D printing technology represented by SL process provides another 
option. As mentioned above, the SL process technology is based on a thermosetting 
plastic and is capable of economical machining of parts with complex internal and 
external structures with high precision. A comparison of the performance parameters 
of SL plastics and two commonly used model materials is shown in Table 1.3. On 
the one hand, the fast processing capability of complex internal and external struc￾tures provides the possibility of realizing complex stiffness distribution of flexible 
models and reduces the difficulty of pre-deformation calculation and model design; 
on the other hand, low-modulus plastics have a large deformation capability, which 
provides a larger design range for pre-deformation calculation. At the same time, 
compared with metallic materials, plastics have larger damping, which is beneficial 
to attenuate the model vibration caused by wind tunnel blowing fluctuations. 
10.2.2 Pre-deformation Calculation 
As mentioned above, the acquisition of the pre-deformation amount is the key to 
the design of flexible model. In this book, the model deformation under specific10.2 Pre-deformation Design 207
aerodynamic load is accurately obtained by using the fluid–solid coupling calculation 
method, and based on this, the amount of deformation with the flexible model under 
certain working conditions is obtained with the help of optimization method. 
1) Acquisition of model aerodynamic deformation—fluid–solid coupling calcula￾tion 
CFD/CSD coupling method is the core technology of deformation calculation in 
this technology, which is usually used for high precision aeroelastic analysis [21]. 
This book uses CFD and CSD to calculate the mathematical model respectively as 
discussed below. 
The CFD solved fluid control equation as Eq: 
∂
∂t ˚ 
V 
QdV +
¨ 
∂V 
F · ndS = 0 (10.1) 
where Q = [ρ , ρu, ρw, ρe]
T , ρ, u, v, w, e are the air density, the components of 
the velocity vector in the three coordinate directions and the total internal energy 
per unit mass, respectively. n is the normal unit vector of the area fraction, and V is 
the volume fraction domain, and ∂V is the boundary containing the volume fraction, 
and F is the flux term, including the inviscid term FE and the viscous term Fν . If 
the viscous term is considered Fν , Eq. (10.1) is the Navier-Stoks equation, and if the 
viscous term is not considered Fν , Eq. (10.1) is the Euler equation. Flux term F is 
discretized using the central format and the time discretization is done by the dual 
time method [32]. 
The structural motion control equation solved by CSD is as the Eq. (6.13). Without 
considering the effect of velocity and acceleration, the Eq. (6.13) can be simplified 
to the following equation, which is the structural static equilibrium equation. 
[K ]{q(t)} = F(t) (10.2) 
According to the way of coupling, CFD/CSD coupling can be divided into three 
main categories: full coupling, loose coupling and tight coupling [77]. In the fully 
coupled model approach, the fluid equations and the structural equations of motion 
are coupled in the same way. In the fully coupled model approach, the fluid equations 
and structural equations of motion are represented in a unified form, and the fluid 
equations and structural equations of motion are solved simultaneously in physical 
time. The fully coupled method is computationally expensive, limited by the grid 
size, and is only used to solve 2D simple flow problems. In the loosely coupled model 
approach, the fluid and structural equations of motion are solved by separate solvers, 
and external data exchange is used between the flow and structural modules, i.e., data 
exchange starts only after partial or full convergence. This type of data exchange 
increases the flexibility in the selection of the solution code, but the computational 
accuracy is low and limited to solving problems with small disturbances and moderate 
nonlinearities. In the Closely coupled model approach, the flow field and structural208 10 Additive Manufacturing of Wind Tunnel Test Models with Pre-deformation
equations of motion are solved by different solvers, but are coupled in a single 
module, and data are exchanged at the interface or boundary through an interface 
technique. The tightly coupled method uses only internal data exchange between the 
flow field module and the structure module, i.e., the data exchange starts when the 
data are not converged, and can be used to solve problems with large perturbations 
and high nonlinearity. The data exchanged here refers to the aerodynamic loads 
mapped from the fluid surface mesh to the structural dynamics mesh and the structural 
displacements mapped from the structural dynamics mesh to the CFD surface mesh. 
The book adopts a tightly coupled model, the flow field is discretized to solve the 
non-constant N-S equation, the structural field is discretized to solve the structural 
static equilibrium equation, the dynamic mesh is updated by the spring-like extrap￾olation method, and the interface data is transferred by the Virtual Surface (VS) 
method. 
2) Obtain model pre-deformation—Optimization calculation 
The implementation of the model design is shown in Fig. 10.3.The purpose of the 
design is to obtain the “design shape” of the model, which has an additional shape and 
can be deformed to the “target shape” under test conditions (defined as the “design 
point” of the model) under load. The “target shape” is the shape of the aircraft. 
The “target profile” is an aerodynamic state of the aircraft, usually the aerodynamic 
optimum in the aircraft design, which is expected to have better aerodynamic perfor￾mance at the “design point”, while its real aerodynamic characteristics need to be 
verified by wind tunnel tests.
If the model is realized using metal machining methods, then the shape is the 
“machined shape” of the model. Metal models are considered rigid and ideally require 
“zero deformation” during the blowing process, however, this is not possible in 
practice. In order to fix the errors caused by this unavoidable deformation, the test 
data needs to be “deformation corrected”. In contrast to metal machined models, this 
book uses 3D printing technology to produce non-metal (epoxy plastic) “flexible 
models”. This type of model has the same large deformation capacity as a real aircraft 
in the blowing state. If the shape of the model has a reverse “pre-deformation”, using 
its large deformation capacity, it can be deformed to the “target shape” in the blowing 
state, and the required experimental data can be obtained directly without correction. 
The core of this new technique is how to obtain the “design shape” from the “target 
shape”. This book is based on the coupled method of Computational Fluid Dynamics 
and Computational Structural Dynamics (CSD), using optimization calculations to 
obtain the shape. The optimization mathematical model is given by the following 
equation: 
minimize f (x) (10.3) 
where the objective function f (x)is defined as the deviation of the “acquired profile” 
from the “target profile”. Theoretically, the shape deviation should be calculated by 
considering all deviations of all nodes of all shapes, but in engineering practice, this 
method is too large to be feasible. In this book, we adopt a simplified strategy by10.2 Pre-deformation Design 209
Fig. 10.3 Schematic 
diagram of calculation of 
pre-deformation amount
(a) Calculation flow (b) Shape relationship 
selecting only the critical phases of the shape and the deviations that play a key 
role in the aerodynamic characteristics. As shown in Fig. 10.3 (b), several critical 
sections of the wing (such as the ith section in the figure) are selected and only their 
translational deviations along the z-direction and rotational deviations around the 
torsional center are calculated in this book. The simplified objective function can 
be expressed as the following equation, where the αθ and αz are the corresponding 
computational weights. 
f (x) = αθ
∑n
i 
|∆θi| + αz ∑n
i 
|∆zi| (10.4) 
The vectors in the objective function x are optimization variables that define a 
specific set of “initial profiles”. When the objective function f (x) is smaller than 
the set threshold, the “initial shape” is the “design shape” of the optimization calcu￾lation, and the “machining shape” of the model is obtained, i.e., after convergence 
of the optimization The “initial shape” = “design shape” = “processing shape”. As 
mentioned above, the “initial shape” is obtained from the “target shape” by “inverse210 10 Additive Manufacturing of Wind Tunnel Test Models with Pre-deformation
pre-deformation”, and the optimization variables x defines the amount of deforma￾tion. As with the simplified method of obtaining the objective function described 
above, the optimization variables x are also composed in a similar way: 
x = (z1,z2,...,zn, θ1, θ2,...,θn) (10.5) 
Based on the coupled CFD/CSD calculation method, the static elastic deformation 
of the model of a specific configuration under aerodynamic load can be predicted. 
Based on this method, the optimization idea is that the initial shape of the model 
is used as the design target, and the modified shape of the model is found so that 
the shape after deformation under aerodynamic load of specific conditions is the 
same as the initial shape, so that the aerodynamic data obtained removes the influ￾ence of elastic deformation. At this time, the deformation correction shape is the 
manufacturing shape of the model. 
Figure 10.3a gives the block diagram of the optimization calculation, which can 
be used to find the manufacturing profile of the model by the method of finding the 
optimization, where the error between the deformed profile and the initial profile 
is judged both quantitatively and in terms of the size of the aerodynamic impact of 
the profile error. The error source analysis sets the corresponding basic criteria to 
ensure the rapidity of the optimization search, such as the change in profile angle of 
orientation generated by torsional deformation has a greater effect on lift, drag and 
pitch moment, while the bending deformation has a smaller effect on force, etc. 
10.3 Case Studies 
10.3.1 Model Design 
The F4 model is a standard model of a wing-fuselage assembly with a large span-to￾skin ratio supercritical wing, which was used to study the relevance of experimental 
data from three large European transonic wind tunnel civil aircraft and to verify 
the usability of the ternary transonic wing-fuselage assembly calculation program 
[78]. The F4 model has a fuselage length of L = 1192 mm and a wingspan of b =
1171.29 mm. The cross-sectional dimensions of the wind tunnel in which the valida￾tion experiments are conducted are 0.6 m × 0.6 m, so the F4 model is designed and 
manufactured at a scale of 1:4. SL resin material was used (for reference of perfor￾mance parameters). The five sets of F4 manufacturing profiles were designed for 
machining under the design conditions (Mach number Ma = 0.6, angle of approach 
α=0°, velocity pressure q=20 kPa) according to the deformation correction method. 
The five sets of F4 manufacturing profiles are shown in Fig. 10.4, where No. 3 is the 
“design profile” and No. 1, 2, 4 and 5, which are symmetrically distributed on the 
top and bottom, are designed for comparison purposes.10.3 Case Studies 211

The aerodynamic parameters for the strength check are as follows Table 10.1 
where the angle of attack is chosen as the maximum value of 2°. 
Stress distribution of F4 resin model under aerodynamic action at design 
conditions Fig. 10.5 The distribution is as expected.
As shown in the figure, the maximum stress value occurs in the middle position 
of the wing, which is 15 MPa, less than the material allowable stress of 23 MPa, 
indicating that the designed light-cured F4 model meets the strength requirements 
of the wind tunnel test. 
In order to measure the aerodynamic forces acting on the model, the model needs 
to be mounted on a measurement mechanism in the wind tunnel, and the model is 
connected to the balance by means of a transition taper sleeve and pins, as shown in 
Fig. 10.6.

10.3.2 Forming and Manufacturing 
After encryption and smoothing, 5 sets of F4 models were processed on the SPS600B 
light-curing rapid prototyping machine. 
In order to reduce the influence of the step effect of each section of light-curing 
rapid forming on the surface of the wing on the surface of the model, the forming 
direction is chosen in the direction of the model axis, and the support is loaded on 
the head and leading edge of the wing. However, because the head and wing leading 
edge supports are point supports, and the support height is too high, the support 
stiffness is low, and the support deformation is easily generated during processing, 
which reduces the forming accuracy and even leads to the scrapping of the processed 
model, so the two models are processed simultaneously, and the support is added 
between the back of the fuselage of the model to increase the support stiffness, as 
shown in Fig. 10.7.
The surface roughness of the model is 1.4 μm after the support removal and 
grinding process, which meets the surface roughness requirement of the model for 
wind tunnel testing. Although the forming accuracy of the light-curing rapid forming 
method is relatively low compared with the machining method, compared with the 
traditional machining manufacturing method, the light-curing rapid forming method 
can reduce the processing cycle and processing cost, and it is easy to realize the 
seamless one-piece processing of small models without model assembly, and the 
overall performance of the processed model is good.10.3 Case Studies 213

10.3.3 Wind Tunnel Test 
The model is installed in the wind tunnel as shown in Fig. 10.8. 
The wind tunnel test of the model was conducted in the FL-21 trans-hypersonic 
wind tunnel of the High Speed Institute of the China Aerodynamic Research and 
Development Center, and the dimensions of the FL-21 wind tunnel test section 
were 0.6 m × 0.6 m × 1.75 m. The balance was a six-component balance with the 
number 2N6-18A. The wind tunnel test conditions were as follows Table 10.1, where 
Reynolds number Re is the Reynolds number based on the average aerodynamic 
chord length of the wing.

10.4 Analysis and Discussion 
10.4.1 Technology Availability 
For Mach number Ma of 0.6, the lift coefficient CL and drag coefficient CD relative 
to the angle of attack α curve are shown in Fig. 10..9. Qualitatively, all CL -α curves 
are approximately linearly distributed with the same trend as that obtained from the 
metal model [14]. 
Table 10.2 shows the lift coefficients CL and drag coefficients CD for the different 
models at the “design point”. The data for the metal models are from three European 
wind tunnels—NLR, ONERA and DRA—and are corrected for hydro-elasticity and 
deformation [78]. The resin model used in this test was obtained in the FL-21 wind 
tunnel without hydro-elastic and deformation corrections. As expected, the lift coef￾ficient CL = 0.445 for the model with the “design profile” (#3) was the closest to 
the average value of 0.440 in the three wind tunnels. Among all the results of this 
test, model #3 with the design profile has the largest lift coefficient CL, as expected, 
because of the optimal aerodynamic characteristics of the modified profile in the 
design phase [14]. At the same time, the lift coefficients of models 1 and 2 are closer, 
and the data of models 4 and 5 have similar characteristics, which is reasonable due 
to the fact that in the model design is the shape of the above two groups of models 
are located on the upper and lower surfaces of No. 3 (as Fig. 10.4 shown). 
For the drag characteristics, the results of this test differed significantly from 
those of the three wind tunnels are shown in Fig. 10.9 and Table 10.2. First, the 
drag coefficient CD is one order of magnitude smaller than the lift coefficient CL, so 
the drag coefficient CD was not considered in the model shape optimization design. 
Another reason is the difference of Reynolds number in the wind tunnel test. The 
Reynolds number in this test is Re = 4.3 × 105, and Re = 3 × 10 in the literature6 
[78], with an order of magnitude difference between the two. Because the Reynolds 
number Re is a dimensionless coefficient characterizing the viscous influence of 
fluid medium, its smaller value means the greater the viscous influence and thus the 
greater the drag. This is another reason why the drag coefficients CD in this test are 
greater than those reported in the literature.

10.4.2 Technical Limitations 
1) Subjects of the case study 
The F4 model is a standard model of a wing-body assembly with a fuselage length 
of 1.192 m, a wingspan of 1.171 m, and a large span-to-skin ratio supercritical wing, 
and was used to study the correlation of experimental data from three large European 
transonic wind tunnel civil aircraft and to verify the usability of the ternary transonic 
wing-body assembly calculation program; the wind tunnel test of the model was 
conducted in the FL-21 transonic wind tunnel at the China Aerodynamic Research 
and Development Center. The dimensions of its test section are 0.6 m × 0.6 m ×
1.75 m; the scale of the model is 1:4, with 298 mm length and 292 mm wingspan, and 
the full model can be processed at one time using SPS600B SL printing equipment. 
The case study made in this chapter is a typical representative of a large span-to￾string ratio aircraft prototype, a simplified structural model, and a small wind tunnel 
test model. In engineering applications, a large number of force tests are conducted 
in larger wind tunnels (e.g., FL-26 wind tunnel with a test section of 2.4 m × 2.4 m),216 10 Additive Manufacturing of Wind Tunnel Test Models with Pre-deformation
the model size is large (1 m magnitude), and the model is rich in detail features 
(e.g., including adjustable rudder surfaces, refer to Chap. 2), which is not easy to be 
processed at one time using SL equipment, which will certainly increase the difficulty 
of pre-deformation design and model processing, and requires targeted research. This 
method is suitable for the selection design in the conceptual design stage of large 
transport aircraft, and can be used to design and manufacture a large number of wind 
tunnel test models with a range of shapes, and conduct a large number of wind tunnel 
tests to select the solution with the best aerodynamic shape. 
2) General pre-deformation design method 
The F4 model in this chapter only considers the wing deformation, and the wing is a 
solid structure, so the design of the model does not need to consider the deformation of 
the fuselage or the tail section and the design of the internal structure of the model. 
However, for larger size and force measurement models with detailed features, it 
is necessary to consider the deformation of parts other than the wing in the pre￾deformation design, and to add the structural design function in the model design. 
For the deformation of other parts, we can refer to the optimization calculation method 
of wing deformation in this chapter, but we need to consider the methods to improve 
the efficiency of CFD/CSD coupled deformation calculation and pre-deformation 
optimization algorithm; the design of internal structure of the model can refer to the 
design methods in other chapters of this book (such as the optimization design of 
model stiffness in Chaps. 3 and 4).References
