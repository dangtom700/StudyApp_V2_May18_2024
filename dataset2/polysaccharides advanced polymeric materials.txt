Preface
The smart properties of polysaccharides were used by mankind long before the term “smart” was ever 
applied to materials. During the last half of the century, the allure of polysaccharides was eclipsed by 
large investments in chemical synthesis and molecular biology that yielded remarkable advances in 
the ability to engineer functional materials from synthetic polymers, proteins, and nucleic acids. Yet 
polysaccharides persist in technological importance, and they promise to become more important 
due to the recent trend toward sustainability and the emergence of applications in medical and life 
sciences. Importantly, polysaccharides offer unique and valuable functional properties. The work 
presents comprehensive information about carbohydrate polymers. The term “carbohydrate poly￾mers” describe ubiquity in the nature of molecular systems containing carbohydrates. The property 
of conformational restriction in polysaccharides makes them candidates for being the initial self￾ordering molecules of prebiotic evolution. This book details the novel synthetic methods involv￾ing carbohydrates, oligosaccharides, and glycoconjugates; the use of chemical methods to address 
aspects of glycobiology; physicochemical studies involving carbohydrates; and the chemistry and 
biochemistry of carbohydrate polymers. Several chapters are devoted to the study and exploitation of 
polysaccharides, which have current or potential applications in areas such as bioenergy, bioplastics, 
biomaterials, biorefining, chemistry, drug delivery, food, health, nanotechnology, packaging, paper, 
pharmaceuticals, medicine, oil recovery, textiles, tissue engineering and wood, and other aspects of 
glycoscience. This book details polysaccharides covering their source, production, structures, proper￾ties, and current and potential application. It includes a systematic discussion of the general strategies 
of isolation, separation, and characterization of polysaccharides. Subsequent chapters are devoted 
to polysaccharides obtained from various sources, including botanical, algal, animal and microbial, 
and their applications in respective fields. This book begins with an overview of the almost universal 
occurrence of natural macromolecules in living organisms where they form a variety of functions. 
The text then examines the synthesis of polysaccharides. Importantly, polysaccharides offer unique 
and valuable functional properties. We anticipate that new experimental and theoretical tools will 
emerge to provide the necessary understanding of the structure–property–function relations that 
will enable polysaccharide-smartness to be understood and controlled. This enhanced understand￾ing will complement the intrinsic characteristics of polysaccharides as sustainable, environmentally 
friendly, and biologically compatible materials. Thus, we envision polysaccharides will continue to 
be well-positioned for applications in foods, cosmetics, and medicine.xiv

1.1 INTRODUCTION
Polymers are a class of naturally occurring or synthetically made substances, which are composed 
of materials made of repeating chains of molecules or chemical units called monomers. These 
substances, which contain a large number of structural units, are joined by the same type of link￾age, giving rise to macromolecules. The macromolecules are very large molecules with molecular 
weights ranging from a few thousand to as high as millions, grams/mole. These materials have 
unique properties depending on the type of molecules being bonded and how they are bonded. 
Naturally occurring polymers have been used by man since prehistoric times. They have been 
modified and processed empirically over many centuries for various applications such as textiles 
for clothing, industrial fibers, adherences, food products, and medicines. Natural polymers may 
be of inorganic and organic origin. Inorganic polymers include diamond and graphite. Both are 
composed of carbon [1]. Furthermore, an artificial carbon allotrope notably known as graphene 
have confirmed multifunctional applications due to the surface functionalization of graphene oxide 
[2]. In line with multifaceted applications, P. Malik et. al. 2020 has successfully demonstrated the 
modulation of graphene oxide towards antioxidant behavior [3]. Organic polymers also make up 
many materials in living organisms. They play a crucial role in living things, providing structural 
materials and participating in vital life processes; e.g., solid parts of all plants are made up of natu￾ral polymers. These include cellulose, lignin, and various resins. More often, the term polymer is 
used to describe plastics, which are synthetic polymers. Vulcanized rubber is also a type of syn￾thetic polymer. Polymers are the basis of many minerals and man-made materials. These materials 
now constitute one of the most successful and useful classes of materials that possesses a broad 
range of physical properties. Besides, synthetic polymers play a crucial role in most of the consumer 
products in the present-day world. They are present everywhere. Just look around, your plastic 
bottles, the silicon rubber tips on your phones earbuds. The nylon and polyester in your jackets and 
sneakers. The rubber in the types of your family car.
Polymer chemists have designed and synthesized polymers that vary in hardness, flexibility, soft￾ening temperature, solubility in water, biodegradability, and biocompatibility. They have produced 
polymeric materials that are as strong as steel yet lighter and more resistant to corrosion. Oil, natural 
gas, and water pipelines are now routinely constructed of plastic pipes. In recent years, automobiles 2 Polysaccharides
have increased their use of plastic components to build lighter vehicles that consume less fuel. Other 
industries such as those involved in the manufacture of textiles, rubber, and paper packaging materi￾als are built upon the polymer chemistry [4–6]. Polymeric materials from natural resources can also 
be very useful for synthesis of hydrogels, coatings and other useful materials [7,8].
1.1.1 Polymeric Gels
To meet new challenges, the demand of natural polymers is expected to grow by 7.1% every year. 
Their low toxicity and an excellent biodegradability have attracted researchers to pay attention 
toward their widespread applications, which range from health sciences such as agents for various 
kinds of drug delivery systems to water purification. While different types of polymers give rise 
to various kinds of materials, among them one of the prominent materials are those of polymeric 
gels which have gained importance over the years due to their several unique characteristics such 
as their rheological and mechanical properties [9–12]. They have become indispensable part of 
new advanced and smart materials, which are used in biological, biomedical, electronic, and envi￾ronmental fields [13]. Gels: Gels are soft, solid, or liquid-like unique three-dimensional polymeric 
networks where the polymer matrix is filled with liquid or gas. The three-dimensional networks are 
composed of several components such as long polymeric chains, species of small molecules, and a 
large amount of solvent. The network formation occurs due to physical, chemical, or supramolecular 
crosslinking [14,15]. In case of physical gels, the network is due to various weak interactions, like 
the entanglement of the polymer chains, hydrogen bonds, or Van der Waals interactions. Such struc￾tures are usually not permanent, and they dissolve over the time when immersed in their solvents. 
However, the polymer chains can also be cross linked through chemical reactions leading to strong 
covalent or electrostatic bonds. The chemically crosslinked network is much more stable and cannot 
be dissolved with the degradation of the polymer. Therefore, chemical gels are usually preferable in 
the majority of the application fields.
The weight and size of gels are more like a liquid, but they are treated like a solid. Under certain 
conditions, the liquid in gel is rendered solid by more or less rigid network of microscopic particles 
dispersed throughout its volume that results in a honeycomb-like structure, enclosing within it all 
the liquid (Figure 1.1).
A gel is overall a semisolid that can have properties ranging from soft and weak to hard and 
tough [16–18]. The word “gel” was coined in the 19th century by Scottish Chemist Thomas Graham, 
who derived this name from the characteristics of gelatin. The two important characteristics of gels 
are phase state and their rheological properties. The gel phase is accompanied by a fundamental 
molecular reorganization that leads to increase in order and a loss of lateral mobility and exhibits no 
flow when in steady state. They do not show the Tyndall effect, Brownian movement, and electro￾phoresis. Gels are classified into elastic gels and non-elastic gels. Elastic gels possess the property 
of elasticity, i.e., they change to solid mass on dehydration which can again be converted into gel 
FIGURE 1.1 Gel formation [15]Polysaccharide-Based Polymeric Gels 3
by addition of water followed by heating and cooling. When they are placed in contact with water, 
they absorb water and swell. Elastic gels (or reversible gels) are lyophilic and are mostly made up of 
organic substances. Some examples of elastic gels are gelatin, agar, starch, etc. [19].
Non-elastic gels (or irreversible gels) do not possess the property of elasticity, i.e., they change 
to solid mass by dehydration which becomes rigid and cannot be converted into original form by 
heating with water. They are lyophobic in nature. Some examples of non-elastic gels are silica acid, 
hydroxides of Fe, Al, Cr, solid alcohol, etc. When contraction of gel causes separation of liquid from 
it, the process is called syneresis. Many gels have tendency to absorb liquid and swell. This property 
is known as imbibition. These hydrophilic gels can swell in water and hold large amount of water 
while maintaining the structure due to physical and/or chemical crosslinking of individual polymer 
chains. These are called hydrogel.
In certain gels when the liquid component of the gel has been replaced with an air or gas without 
significant collapse of the gel structure, the result is mesophorous solid foam with extremely low 
density and extremely low conductivity. These are called aerogels. The term mesoporous here refers 
to a material that contains pores ranging from 2 to 50nm in diameter. The shrinkage in aerogels is 
less than 15%.We may also have nanogels. A nanogel is a particle of nano dimension composed of a 
hydrogel. It is a crosslinked hydrophilic polymer network where polymerization and crosslinking are 
being held concomitantly. A gel is named as a xerogel, when the liquid phase of a gel is removed by 
evaporation at room temperature. It may retain its original shape but often cracks due to the extreme 
shrinkage that is experienced while being dried. The shrinkage is more than 90%. Xerogel usually 
retains high porosity (15%–50%) and enormous surface area, along with small pore size (1–10nm).
Solvent removal under supercritical conditions results in aerogels. Therefore, the method of dry￾ing will dictate whether an aerogel or a xerogel will be formed. Cryogel is yet another form of gel 
that is formed by freeze-drying. This enables the solvent to convert to gas phase directly from solid 
phase. It results in a flexible composite blanket designed for insulating cold temperature environ￾ments ranging from cryogenic to ambient.
From the aforementioned discussion, it is clear that all other types of gels originate from hydro￾gels. So hydrogel can be called the fundamental type of gel system on which the formation of other 
types of gel systems such as aerogels, xerogels, and cryogenic gels depend. 
• Hydrogels have good cell attachment, molecular response, structural integrity, biodegradabil￾ity, biocompatibility, and good mechanism for solute transport. In addition to these, hydro￾gels have some basic characteristics, which make them a preferred choice of gel systems [20].
• Hydrogels are inherently heterogeneous. They have solid-rich regions distributed within 
liquid environment.
• Water can be freely diffused or be loosely bound or tightly associated with the network.
• Hydrogels have solid-like characterstics with infinite viscosity, defined shape, and modu￾lus. At the same time, they exhibit liquid-like characterstics, allowing solutes to diffuse 
freely as long as they are not larger than the average mesh size.
The basic criterion for a material or polymer to be called hydrogel is that water must constitute at 
least 10% of the total weight (or volume). When the content of water exceeds 95% of the total weight 
(or volume), the hydrogel is said to be superabsorbent. Apart from the swelling factor in hydrogels 
or for that matter any type of gel system, the factor that matters the most is the type of crosslinking. 
Based on the nature of crosslinking, we have the following types of hydrogels:
• Physical hydrogels: involve physical interactions such as molecular entanglement, ionic 
interactions, hydrogen bonding, and Van der Waals forces. E.g. Gelatin, agar.
• Chemical hydrogels: involve the formation of covalent bonds, e.g., poly(methyl methac￾rylate) (PMMA). Based on the charge of building blocks, these are neutral (e.g., dextran); 
anionic (e.g., carrageenam, alginic acid, etc.); and cationic (e.g., chitosan); and ampholytic 4 Polysaccharides
(that can behave as both positive and negative) (e.g., collagen carboxymethyl chitin, fibrin, 
etc.). The crosslinkages in hydrogels are based on the following methods of preparation:
• Homopolymer: involves the crosslinking network of a single hydrophilic monomer type.
• Copolymer: involves crosslinking of two (or more) monomer units, at least one of which 
is hydrophilic to render them swellable.
• Multipolymer: involves three or more comonomers reacting together.
• Interpenetrating polymer networks: comprises two or more networks which are at least 
partially interlaced on a polymer scale but are not covalently bonded to each other.
1.1.2 Crosslinking Methods
Preparing hydrogels with certain aspects like mesh size, swelling behavior, and permeability char￾acteristics depend on the method of preparation. The method may be of a physical and/or chemical 
crosslinking, graft polymerization, or radiation crosslinking. The last one may cause either physical 
or chemical crosslinking depending on the kind of polymer which is being used.
1.1.2.1 Physical Methods
The main advantage of physical crosslinking is that no other crosslinker is needed at all, and this 
makes it very safe. The crosslinker may be toxic, or even if it is not toxic, its effects may be unde￾sired. Physical crosslinking is a relatively easy process, but it often results in low mechanical strength 
for most physical crosslinkings due to the weak nature of interactions. In physical crosslinkings, 
besides ionic interactions and hydrogen bonds, we also have alternate heating or cooling cycles and 
crystallization.
When heating/cooling cycles are repeated multiple times, it ends up in the formation of coils 
(as shown in Figure 1.2). This heating/cooling is done along with sodium ions or potassium ions. 
These established physical crosslinks contribute to the stabilization of hydrogels to form a hydro￾gels, e.g., PEO, PEG, and PLA.
Crystallization is another common method used for crosslinking. In this, freezing/thawing is 
repeated multiple times which again results in the formation of coils (as shown in Figure 1.2). Finally, 
on freezing, these coils interact with each other and form a very strong hydrogel. Crystallization is 
actually a technique that provides reasonably a good mechanical strength. In many cases, it gives 
mechanical strength which is better than chemical crosslinking, e.g., PVA and Xanthan.
1.1.2.2 Chemical Methods
In many cases, chemical crosslinking is an irreversible crosslinked network due to the formation 
of covalent bonds. It is basically a direct reaction of a polymer or its branches with the bifunctional 
component of small molecular weight, which is a crosslinking agent or a crosslinker. In this, one 
group of the bifunctional crosslinker reacts with one polymer chain on one end, and with its another 
functional group, it reacts with the another polymer chain on the other end, thus creating crosslinks 
FIGURE 1.2 Effect of heating/cooling cycles and crystallization on respective polymer coils [21].Polysaccharide-Based Polymeric Gels 5
between polymer chains. One such common example is that of gluteraldehyde, where you have two 
aldehyde groups, which easily react with amines, etc. Another type of chemical crosslinking can 
be done by grafting, where polymerization of a monomer is performed on the backbone of a previ￾ously formed polymer or its branches. Apart from the types of crosslinkings, it is the nature of the 
polymer chains that defines the particular type of gel they form. Polymeric gels comprise a great 
variety of different polymeric components, which are either derived from natural resources such as 
peptides, proteins, polysaccharides, and nucleic acids or from synthetically prepared polymers such 
as polyesters, which include PEG-PLA-PEG, PEG-PLGA-PEG, PHB, etc., and from other synthetic 
polymers such as PEG-bis(PLA-acrylate), PEG-g-p(AAm-co-vamine), PAAm, etc. [21].
1.2 POLYSACCHARIDE-BASED POLYMERIC GELS
While most commercially available gels are synthetic polymer-based, there is increasing interest 
in the use of natural polymers that have renewable advantageous properties like biodegradability 
and good biocompatibility [22]. Polysaccharides are one such important group of renewable materi￾als due to their abundance and low cost. The non-polysaccharide component can range from other 
renewable resources like polypeptides, synthetic polymers to inorganic additives. In this chapter, 
we will more specifically elucidate the structural aspects, properties, and applications of polysac￾charide-based polymeric gels. 
1.3 STRUCTURAL ASPECTS
1.3.1 Cellulose
Cellulose is the most available polysaccharide biomolecule in nature. It is estimated to account 
for 50% of the world’s organic carbon. It is present mostly in plant cells. It plays an integral role 
in keeping the structure of plant cell walls stable. Cellulose can be also synthesized via certain 
types of bacteria (e.g., Acetobacter xylinum) with slightly different physical and macromolecular 
properties.
Structure: The primary structure of cellulose is comprised of a long chain of anhydrous 
d-glucose units attached together by β-1,4-glucosidic linkage (Figure 1.3). It shows high degree
of crystallinity usually 40%–60% in plant cellulose and 61%–70% in bacterial cellulose. Such 
high crystallinity is due to the extended hydrogen bonding along the cellulose chains resulting in 
very tight and well-packed chains, which hinder cellulose dissolution in common solvents [24] 
(Figure 1.4).
FIGURE 1.3 Structure of cellulose [23].6 Polysaccharides
Glucose unit in cellulose has three hydroxyl functional groups in carbon atoms six (primary) 
and two and three (secondary), which open wide possibilities of chemical modifications in order to 
produce cellulose derivatives with distinguished characteristics.
1.3.1.1 Cellulose-Based Hydrogels
As mentioned earlier, hydrogel forms when hydrophilic polymer chains crosslink either by physi￾cal or chemical bonds to create a 3D network [26–30]. Such mechanism requires water or solvent￾soluble polymers in order to facilitate the physical or chemical interactions with the crosslinker. 
Special solvent systems have been used for such purposes such as N-Methylmorpholine-N-oxide 
(NMMO) ionic liquids (ILs) and alkali/urea [31,32]. These new solvent systems have opened new 
scope for native cellulose for chemical modifications such as reversible and irreversible cellulose￾based hydrogels [33]. Due to strong intermolecular interactions, the cellulose is insoluble in water. 
However, the partial substitution of hydrogel groups results in weakening of these bonds, leading 
to improved solubility. Water solubility increases with the degree of substitution. For the hydrogel 
synthesis, mostly cellulose ethers are utilized (Figure 1.5).
Besides, cellulose derivatives, such as carboxymethyl cellulose and hydoxyethyl cellulose [34,35], 
have been widely utilized in hydrogel preparation (Figure 1.6).
FIGURE 1.4 Cellulose structure showing β-1,4-glycosidic linkages and hydrogen bonding between cellulose 
chains [25].
FIGURE 1.5 NMMO-Cellulose dissolution mechanisms showing physical crosslinking [31].Polysaccharide-Based Polymeric Gels 7
Native cellulose solution which is dissolved in lithium chloride/dimethyl acetamide (LiCl /
DMAC) system leads to 3D hydrogel upon dropping into non-solvent systems, such as azeotropic 
methanol and isopropanol. The same technique of hydrogel formation has been reported by using 
different dissolution systems, such as paraformadehyde/dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO), triethyl 
ammonium chloride /DMSO, and tetrabutylammonium chloride/DMSO [37] (Figure 1.7).
Chemical crosslinking of cellulose and mainly cellulose derivatives depend on few small mol￾ecules that react with the free hydroxyl functional groups of the glucose units, such as citric acid, 
divinyl sulphone [34,35], diglycidyl ether [39], epichlorohydrin [35,40], and carbodiimide [41] 
(Figure 1.8).
FIGURE 1.6 Crosslinked carboxymethyl cellulose/hydroxyethyl cellulose hydrogel [36].
FIGURE 1.7 Homogeneous etherification of cellulose in LiCl/DMAC [38].8 Polysaccharides
1.3.2 Starch
Starch is mostly present in plant cells as granules of energy storage [43]. It is another polysaccharide 
having its monomers as α-d-glucose units.
Structure: Starch is constituted of two different macromolecular structures: amylose and amylo￾pectin. The former shows α-1,4-linkage and the later has α-1,6-linkage. Amylose is a comparatively 
smaller macromolecule. The chains form double helices with crystalline structures. Starch exists 
in two allomorphic forms: type “A” and type” B” [44] “A” type helices are close packed with water 
molecules positioned between the helices [45–47]. In type “B”, the helices form a hexagonal lattice, 
and water molecules lie inside the hexagonal structure (Figure 1.9).
FIGURE 1.8 Cellulose-based hydrogel crosslinked with citric acid [42].
FIGURE 1.9 Structure of amylopectin and amylose [48].Polysaccharide-Based Polymeric Gels 9
1.3.2.1 Starch-Based Hydrogels
The granular structure of starch gets destroyed while hydrogel synthesis. Bioactive carboxymethyl￾ated starch is considered to be relevant for its gel synthesis (Figure 1.10 [49]). Ecofriendly hydrogel 
synthesis of starch is carried out with citric acid and itaconic acid (Figure 1.11, [50]).
In situ hydrogel is constructed by using starch-based nanoparticles via Schiff base (Figure 1.12).
1.3.3 Chitin
Chitin is the second abundant material, next to cellulose. It is a very important structural material in 
nature. It is found in the exoskeletons of insects, the cell walls of fungi, and certain hard structures 
in invertebrates and fish.
FIGURE 1.10 Crosslinking of CMS and citric acid using CuONPs to form hydrogel [49].10 Polysaccharides
Structure: Chitin is comprised of a long chain polymer of N-acetylglucosamine units, which 
is an amide derivative of glucose. It has glycosidic bonds joining the series of substituted glucose 
molecules possessing acetylated amine group instead of OH group in glucose (Figure 1.13).
FIGURE 1.11 Starch-based hydrogel from citric acid and itaconic acid [50].
FIGURE 1.12 Hydrogel formation of starch-based nanoparticles via a Schiff base [51].Polysaccharide-Based Polymeric Gels 11
1.3.3.1 Chitin-Based Hydrogels
Biocompatible chitin/CNTs (carbon nanotubes) composite hydrogels were prepared with chitin solu￾tion in 11 wt% NaoH/4 wt% urea aqueous solution and subsequently regenerating in ethanol [53]. In 
these, CNTs were dispersed homogeneously in chitin matrix and combined with chitin nanofibers 
to form a compact and neat chitin/CNT nanofibrous network (as shown in Figure 1.14) through 
intermolecular interactions, such as electrostatic interactions, hydrogen bonding, and amphiphilic 
interactions [54].
In another latest development, [55] a novel, chitin-based composite hydrogel reinforced by tan￾nic acid and modified reduced graphene oxide was prepared via a facile freezing-thawing approach. 
Epicholrohydrin and TRGO sheets were employed as efficient crosslinkers to fabricate dually cross￾linked TRGO/chitin composite hydrogels (Figure 1.15).
FIGURE 1.13 Structures of chitin and chitosan [52].
FIGURE 1.14 Chitin/CNTs composite hydrogel [54].12 Polysaccharides
1.3.4 Chitosan
The most important derivative of chitin is its deacetylated form, called chitosan, which contains 
amino groups in C(2) position. Chitosan is a polymeric structure that is composed of linear sequence 
of d-glucosamine and N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (Figure 1.13).
1.3.4.1 Chitosan-Based Hydrogels
Chitosan is a natural cationic copolymer that presents a great deal of interest for hydrogel 
structures. The polymer has hydrophilic nature with ability via human enzymes, which result 
in its biocompatibility and biodegradability. To make chitosan hydrogel, you can use cross￾linker such as glutarudehyde, genipin (Figure 1.16, below), diisocyanate, and tripolyphosphate. 
FIGURE 1.15 TRGO/chitin composite hydrogel [55].
FIGURE 1.16 Crosslinking of chitosan with genipin [57].Polysaccharide-Based Polymeric Gels 13
Physical crosslinking method such as thawing and freezing is also made use of for the purpose. 
Apart from traditional methods, a novel chitosan hydrogels reinforced by silver nanoparticles can 
be constructed (Figure 1.17, [56]). In this method, LiOH/urea solvent system is used and then Ag 
nanoparticles are integrated into the chitosan network, which results in the formation of 3D net￾work due to intermolecular and intramolecular interactions with ultra-high mechanical properties 
and improved antibacterial property.
1.3.5 Alginates
Alginates are naturally occurring linear anionic polysaccharides extracts found in brown marine 
algae and several bacteria strains. It is biocompatible, biodegradable, nontoxic, and easy to gel. 
Alginates can be processed into various forms such as hydrogels, microspheres, fibers, and 
sponges [58]. They have been widely applied in medical field.
Structure: Chemically alginates are copolymers mainly composed of β-d-mannuronic acid (M) 
and its C-5 epimer α-l-guluronic acid (G) residues linked via 1,4-glycosidic bond in an irregular 
blockwise manner (as shown in Figure 1.18).
The M and G residues are organized in homopolymeric blocks of G units (GG) or M units as 
(MM blocks) and heteropolymeric sequences of randomly coupled G and M units (GM or MG 
blocks). There occurrence, proportion, and distribution may differ significantly depending on their 
natural source.
1.3.5.1 Alginate-Based Gels
The most important property of alginates is their ability to form ionic gel in the presence of the poly￾valent cations. The gelling is the result of ion exchange between monovalent ions of alginate solution 
(most often, Na+ ions) and polyvalent cations, followed by subsequent coordination of polyvalent metal 
FIGURE 1.17 Chitosan hydrogel reinforced by silver nanoparticles [56].14 Polysaccharides
ions with alginate macromolecule. Calcium is the most common cation applied to form alginate gels. 
The typical gelation mechanism involves coordination and chelating structures in the model of egg 
box, in which G units selectively form higher order junction zones (Figure 1.19), which is composed 
of two or more chains and crosslink via hydrogen bonding, with oxygen atoms in the G blocks of the 
two adjacent polymer chains. In 3D network of egg box, each cation is bound with four G residues, 
thus there should be 8–12 adjacent G residues in order to form a stable junction for Ca2+ alginate gels.
Several other divalent cations can bind to alginates, but with different affinity which is in the 
order of:
Mg2+ <Mn2+ <Zn2+, Ni2+, Co2+,<Fe2+ <Ca2+ <Sr2+ <Ba2+ <Cd2+ <Cu2+ <Pb2+
Alginate can also form irreversible hydrogel by creating permanent bonds between alginate 
chains either by chemical crosslinking agents or by photo crosslinking using photoinitiators [61]. 
FIGURE 1.18 Structure of alginate [59].
FIGURE 1.19 The junction zone in the egg box model of calcium alginate gel [60].Polysaccharide-Based Polymeric Gels 15
This is done with the help of bifunctional or multifunctional crosslinkers. For instance, glu￾teraldehyde, a bifunctional chemical crosslinker, creates an acetal link with alginate hydroxyl 
group [62] in the presence of poly(ethylene glycol) diamine. Reductive amination takes place 
between amino groups of the crosslinker and the aldehyde group of oxidized alginate [63] 
(Figure 1.20). Photo crosslinking of alginate hydrogel has also been reported for medical pur￾poses [64] (Figure 1.21). It requires modifying alginate with photo-active groups such as methyl 
acrylate, etc. [65,66].

1.3.6 Carrageenans
Carrageenans are a family of natural linear sulfated polysacchasides that are extracted from red 
edible seaweeds. The most prominent among them is Chondrus crispus which is a dark-red parsley 
like plant that grows attached to rocks. Gelatinons extracts of the Chondrus crispus seaweeds have 
been used as food additives since approximately the 15th century. Carrageenan is a vegetarian and 
vegan alternative to gelatin in diary, confectionery, and other foods. Besides, it is also used in meat 
products due to their strong bonding to food proteins.
Structure of Carrageenans: Carrageenans contain 15%–40% ester-sulfate content, which 
makes them anionic polysaccharides. Based on their sulfate content, carrageenans are catego￾rized into three different classes: (kapa) κ-carrageenan, which has one sulfate group per disac￾charide; (iota) i-carrageenan which has two; and (lambda) λ-carrageenan, which has three sulfate 
groups (Figure 1.22).
κ-Carrageenan is a polysaccharide that consists of alternating disaccharide units of O-3 linked 
β-d-galactopyranosyle-4-sulfate and O-4-linked 3,6-anhydro-d-galactopyranosyl residues (below 
in Figure 1.22), and ι-carrageenan is more highly sulfated galactan and is also most characterized 
polysaccharide. The polymer consists of O-3-linked β-d-galactopyranosyl-4-sulfate and O-4-linked 
3,6-anhydro-α-d-galactopyranosyl-2-sulfate residues.
1.3.6.1 Gelation Mechanism of κ-Carrageenan
κ-Carrageenan is well known for its gel-forming property. It is a cation-selective bonding poly￾mer, which gels in the presence of large size univalent cations such as K+ (Van der Waals rad 275 
pm), Rb+ (303 pm), and Cs+ (343 pm) but does not do so in the presence of small cations, i.e., Na+
(227 pm) and Li+ (182 pm) (Masakuni Tako 295). Even at a concentration range of 0.1%–10% 
at room temperature, it changes into ice-like structure with hydrogen bonding between polymer 
FIGURE 1.22 Chemical structures for three basic types of carrageenans [69].Polysaccharide-Based Polymeric Gels 17
and water molecules and between water–water molecules, resulting in gelling. In κ-carrageenan, 
an intramolecular K+ bridge is developed between sulfate oxygen C-4, which is oriented at axial 
configuration of d-galactopyranosyl residues and 3,6 oxygen of 3,6-anhydro-α-d-galactopyranosyl 
residue (Figure 1.23). This type of bridge does not exist with Na+ ions because the radius of Na+
ions is too small for an association with ring oxygen group and also due to the presence of too 
much hydration, which prevents electrostatic forces of attraction being involved in the bridge. 
Many intramolecular K+ cation bridges serve to keep the polymer chains rigid, which further lead 
to intermolecular association. However, the transition temperature is observed at 25°C where inter 
and intramolecular associations dissociate above the given temperature.
1.3.6.2 Gelation Mechanism of ι-Carrageenan
Gelation in i-carrageenan occurs with Ca-salt on cooling but does not do so with K-salt or Na-salt. 
Ca-salt of i-carrageenan involves intramolecular association through Ca cation, with the ionic bond￾ing between sulfate oxygen (as shown in Figure 1.24). Each Ca cation is coordinated to two sulfate 
FIGURE 1.23 Gelation mechanism of κ-carrageenan ionic bonding (curved lines) and electrostatic forces of 
attraction (dotted lines) [45].
FIGURE 1.24 Gelation mechanism of ι-carrageenan, ionic bonding (curved lines), and electrostatic forces 
of attraction (dotted lines) [45].18 Polysaccharides
groups by ionic bonding, which is stronger than electrostatic forces of attraction. This makes the 
molecular chain rigid even at room temperature, and therefore, intermolecular associations take 
place. Thus intramolecular Ca-bridge is developed, which further leads to intermolecular asso￾ciations of Ca-salt of ι-carrageenan. These two types of bridges differ essentially from that of the 
K-salt bridges of κ-carrageenan. The former consists of double ionic forces and an electrostatic force 
of attraction, whereas the later consists of single bond and triple electrostatic forces of attraction. 
These differences give rise to conformational transition of ι-carrageenan and κ-carrageenan in aque￾ous solution. Since the ionic bonding is stronger than electrostatic forces of attraction, the molecular 
chain can keep rigid even up to 45°C, which is the transition temperature for ι-carrageenan, beyond 
45°C intra and intermolecular Ca-bridges dissociate.
1.3.7 Agarose
Agarose is the major gelling constituent of agar extracted from red sea weeds and is also found as a 
support structure of cell wall for marine algae. It is a polysaccharide which together with agropectin 
creates agar. It is used especially as a supporting medium in gel electrophoresis.
Structure of Agarose: Agarose consists of a copolymer alternating O-3 linked beta-d-galacto￾pyranosyl and O-4 linked 3,6-anhydro-alpha-l-galactopyranosyl residues. Its structure is similar 
to κ-carrageenan and ι-carrageenan, except for the sulfate content and l-configuration (as shown 
in Figure 1.25). In fact, agarose is a diastereomeric derivative of κ-carrageenan and ι-carrageenan.
1.3.7.1 Gelation Mechanism of Agarose
Gelation occurs at a concenteration of 0.08% at low temperature (0°C), stays constant during 
increase in temperature upto 60°C in the presence of 0.1% of salt (NaCl, KCl, CaCl2 or MgCl2), 
and then decreases rapidly with further increase in temperature [45,71]. This can be caused by 
“salting out” effect which might take place because of the rigidity of the molecular chains of 
agarose through the formation of intra and intermolecular association, resulting from the tetra￾hedral distribution of anhydro α-l-galactosyl residues and water molecules. However, the least 
elastic modulus was observed in the presence of area (4.0 M). Thus, it was proposed that there 
exists an intramolecular hydrogen bonding between OH-4, which is oriented at axial configu￾ration of the β-d-galactopyranosyl and the adjacent hemiacetal oxygen atom of 3,6-anhydro￾α-l-galactopyranosyl residues (Figure 1.26). The 3,6-anhydro-l-galactopyranosyl residues is a 
cage-like sugar that contributes by stabilizing the proposed intramolecular hydrogen bonding, 
even at high temperature >60°C. lntermolecular hydrogen bonding was also proposed between 
the ring O-3, 6-atom and OH-2 which is oriented at axial configuration of 3,6-anhydro-α-l￾galactopyranosyl residues on different molecules (Figure 1.26). This intermolecular hydrogen 
bonding results from the cage effect of the 3,6-anhydro-α-l-galactopyranosyl residues, which 
adopt a tetrahedral distribution and therefore also attract water molecules with hydrogen bonding 
(Figure 1.26). The mode of intra and intermolecular hydrogen bonding of agarose molecules has 
been supported by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy.

1.4 PROPERTIES
Properties of hydrogels include their mechanical, rheological, and swelling properties. Apart from 
these, they have their respective thermal, electrical, and physicochemical properties. In this section, 
we will focus on the properties which pertain to some polysaccharide-based polymeric gels, in par￾ticular, and also on some principle properties which pertain to hydrogels in general.
1.4.1 Mechanical Properties
To explain mechanical behaviors of hydrogels, rubber elastic theory is regarded as the most relevant 
and efficient approach because it associates important bulk property of hydrogels: rubbery modulus 
scales, temperature, and crosslinking density [72, 73]. Hydrogels show elastic property like rubber. 
Peppas et al. [74] developed an equation (Eq. 1.1). It is known as rubber elastic theory, which gives 
the structure of hydrogels in solvent.
τ=pRT/Mc (1_2Mc/Mn) (a_1/a2) 3√ (V2,s/V2, r) (1.1)
FIGURE 1.26 Gelation mechanism of agarose showing intra and intermolecular (---) hydrogen bonding and 
with water molecules also [45].20 Polysaccharides
Here, “τ” (tau) is the applied stress to the polymer as a function of elongation, “ρ” (rho) is the poly￾mer density, “R” is the universal gas constant, “T” is the absolute temperature, Mc and Mn are the 
average molecular weights between and without crosslink, respectively, “a” is known as the exten￾sion ratio, and V2,s and V2,r are the polymer volume fraction in the swollen and relaxed forms.
However, the original rubber theory cannot properly explain the nature of hydrogels in aqueous 
medium and demands some modifications [75].
Yet, other parameters of mechanical properties and hydrogel stiffness can be demonstrated by 
using oscillatory shear measurements of elastic (G′) and viscous modulus (G″) of hydrogel matrices 
that have been measured at varied temperature using constant stress rheometer. Given below is typi￾cal DMA scan (dynamic mechanical analysis) of thermoelastic polymers which is used to describe 
the viscoelastic behavior of a polymer in the test temperature range.
DMA is a frequently used technique in material characterization. It is the most useful for 
studying the viscoelastic behavior of polymers. DMA mechanically deforms a sample and mea￾sures the sample response as a function of temperature, time, frequency, and amplitude. The 
DMA measurements are used mainly to determine glass transition temperature, moduli, damp￾ing behavior, relaxation behavior, molecular interactions, creep recovery, degree of crosslinking, 
crystallinity, and effect of fillers on material properties. In Figure 1.27, G′ represents storage 
modulus, G″ represents loss modulus, and “tan delta” represents function of temperature. It is 
also called the loss factor and is the ratio of loss modulus to storage modulus. These three param￾eters describe viscoelastic behavior of polymers in the test temperature range.
In the “glassy state,” polymers are ideally elastic and the value of storage modulus G′ is very 
high. As the temperature goes up, short chain mobility starts in the sample, and we enter the glass 
transition range. In this range, the sample becomes leathery and soft, and therefore, the storage 
modulus G′ decreases sharply. Also in this range, the value of loss modulus G″ and “tan delta” 
attain their peaks. After the glass transition range, we enter the so-called rubbery plateau in which 
loss modulus G″ and “tan delta” are small. Here the thermoplastic polymer exhibits rubbery-like 
properties and can be permanently deformed. The width of the rubbery plateau increases with the 
increase in molecular weight of the polymer. After this, at higher temperature, the material starts to 
flow, and this is called the flow region. In this state, the storage modulus G′ decreases while the loss 
modulus G″ and “tan delta” increase. The material behaves like a liquid because in melted state the 
polymer behaves like amorphous polymer.
FIGURE 1.27 Typical DMA scan (Center for Industrial Rheology).Polysaccharide-Based Polymeric Gels 21
G′ relates to the energy stored in the material, G″ (is the loss factor), which relates to the energy 
dissipated in the form of heat, and the “tan delta” is the measure of how well the energy is dissipated.
Examples of mechanical characteristics: Storage modulus (G′) and loss modulus (G″) of 
polysaccharide hydrogels in native and squeezed situations. Data are reported as mean of three 
value ± standard error [22].
For low values of oscillation stress, the storage moduls (G′) is higher than the viscous one (G″) 
indicating the gel like nature of the material. Above the cross point, i.e., the oscillation stress at 
which G′ and G″ assume the same value, the viscous modulus is higher than the storage modulus, 
which is characteristic of a liquid. This implies a sol-gel transition of a material. However, when the 
oscillation stress is decreased (step2), G′ and G″ show always lower values than those found during 
the increase in oscillation stress (Figure 1.28). By repeating the same sequence of steps in step 3 
and 4 (Figure 1.29), G′ and G″ values follow the same trend and maintain the same values as those 
determined in step 2. This result indicates a sort of “recovery effect” of the G′ and G″ values once 
the material is subjected to further cycles of stress.
In case of squeezed hydrogels (Figure 1.29), both the storage modulus G′ and loss modulus G″
values are reduced due to the passage from the syringe with respect to those of the native hydro￾gels (Table 1.1). However, by repeating the same cycles of stress several times on the squeezed 
hydrogels as done on native hydrogels (Figure 1.29), G′ and G″ values remain same. This does not 
occur for a native hydrogel (step 1 and 2- Figure 1.28). The squeezing process induces the same 
effect on the hydrogel as the stress applied by the rheometer. The lower values of G′ and G″ of a 
squeezed hydrogel with respect to its native sample indicate that the hydrogel network is softened 
by the application of shear stress such as squeezing through a syringe or by the stress applied 
by a rheometer. However, additional stress does not lead to further alterations of the hydrogels 
mechanical properties [22].
• In another study, four different gel-forming polysaccharides, ι-carrageenan, κ-carrageenan, 
xantham gum, and Konjac gum were used for making hydrogels (for wound healing) [76]. 
These hydrogels are biocompatible, and they form helical structures and thus are stronger 
materials. DMA data shows some unusually high modulus for these hydrogels. In some 
cases, it is higher than those of contact lenses, which are considered to be some of the 
strongest known biodegradable hydrogels. DMA reports show that in these polysaccharide 
hydrogels the strength increases considerably after drying.
FIGURE 1.28 Typical trend of G′ and G″ values vs oscillation stress during sweep test performed on a poly￾saccharide-based hydrogel. The figure shows the G′ and G″ value vs oscillation stress for each step of test [22].22 Polysaccharides
• In yet another study, cellulose gel membrane was used as GPE (gel polymer electrolyte) in 
lithium-ion battery. This showed mechanical properties of GPE [17]. In this GPE based on 
cellulose membrane with 5% crosslinker, possessed good tensile fracture strength robust 
which increased along with increase of ECH from 5% to 9%. The tensile strength signifi￾cantly increased from 14.61 to 46.21MPa.
1.4.2 Rheological Properties
Rheology is a branch of mechanics, which deals with the study of deformation and flow of objects 
under an external force. The study of the rheological properties of polysaccharides is useful for 
applications in food industry, e.g., prediction of their gelation or thickening properties can aid 
the manufacture, distribution, storage, and consumption of food products [77]. Many naturally 
occurring polysaccharides are used as gelling agents, thickeners, and emulsifiers due to their 
unique rheological properties. Xanthan gum and gellan gum are most commonly used for such 
purposes. Examples:
• A polysaccharide fraction (FMPS) was isolated from floral mushrooms cultivated in 
Huangshan Mountain in Anhui Province of China. Their rheological properties in aque￾ous solutions were investigated [78]. The FMPS solution showed shear thinning behavior

at 25°C. Dynamic viscoelastic tests revealed that G′ and G″ exhibited strong depen￾dences on the concentration and temperature. The exponent n of G′ ~Wn and “tan delta” 
also exhibited strong dependence on concenteration and temperature. The gel point 
(C gel) of FMPS solution was 1.16 × 10−2 gel mL−1 at 15°C, and the “T gel” of 1.14 × 10−2
g mL−1 FMPS solution was 20.6°C. Dynamic frequency sweep measurements indicated 
that the FMPS gel system was stable in the selected range of frequency. The heating 
cooling process proved that the sol-gel transition of FMPS in aqueous solutions was 
thermally reversibly.
• In another study, rheological properties of starch isolated from Avocado seeds were evalu￾ated [79]. Avocado seed powder was suspended in solution containing 2mM Tris, 7.5mM 
NaCl, and 80mM NaHSO3 (solvent A) or sodium bisulfite solution (1,500ppm SO2, sol￾vent B). Solvent type had no influence (p>0.05) on starch properties. Amylose content 
was 15%–16%. Gelatinization temperature range was 56°C–74°C, and peak temperature 
was 65.7°C. Maximum viscosity 380–390 Bu, breakdown -2 Bu, consistency 200 Bu, and 
setback 198 Bu. Avocado seed starch dispersions (5% W/V) were characterized as visco￾elastic systems with G′>G″.
Avocado seed starch has potential applications as thickening agent and gelling agent in food sys￾tems, as a vehicle in pharmaceutical systems, and as an ingredient in biodegradable polymers for 
food packaging.
1.4.3 Swelling Properties
The factors on which swelling property and the degree of swelling depend are the network density, 
solvent nature, polymer solvent interactions, crosslinking density, temperature, and surface-to-vol￾ume ratio. Besides all these factors, water or solvent appears as a plasticizer in a hydrophilic poly￾mer network system [80,81]. Swelling theory of hydrogels was pioneered by Flory and Rehner 1943. 
This provided a simple conceptual and mathematical approach of swelling which further attracted a 
lot of interest in research perusals that have helped in its better understanding. The theory is related 
to the molecular weight of the chains which is said to be proportional to the extent of swelling 
(Figure 1.30) with larger values allowing more swelling.
When a solvent is added to a crosslinked polymer, it swells. The amount of swelling depends on 
two factors:
1. How soluble (uncrosslinked) the polymer is in the solvent and
2. The length (or in this theory the molecular weight) of the chains between crosslinks. 
Obviously, the shorter the length (the higher the crosslink density), the lesser the swelling.
Moreover, the quantity of water absorption by a hydrogel is an important measure, which is referred 
to as degree of swelling.
Degree of swelling = (wet wt. − dry wt.)/dry wt. × 100%
The degree of swelling helps to find:
• The solute diffusion coefficient through the hydrogel
• The surface properties and surface mobility and also the mechanical properties.
Examples of highly swollen hydrogels are those of cellulose, poly(vinyl alcohol), and poly(ethylene 
glycol), since all these instances have lot of OH groups. Besides this concept, other factors which 24 Polysaccharides
influence the swelling capacity are such as osmotic pressure, rise in temperature of water, and 
surface-to-volume ratio.
When content of water exceeds 95% of total weight (or volume), the hydrogels are categorized as 
SAPs (superabsorbent polymers). Some SAPS undergo distinct physical changes upon small envi￾ronmental variations. These so-called “smart polymers” have the ability to sense environmental 
stimuli including changes in pH, temperature, light, and pressure [83]. Nowadays, these SAPs are 
usually made from synthetic polymers and are aimed to be replaced by naturally occurring poly￾saccharides and proteins, since these are biocompatible, biodegradable, renewable, and have less 
environmental impacts. Currently, the polysaccharides that are used in the manufacture of SAPs are 
based on alginate, chitosan, agrose, carrageenans, dextrin, cellulose, starch, gellan gum, xanthan, 
etc. These polysaccharides on their own or along with some suitable components show a great deal 
of swelling properties.
FIGURE 1.30 Swelling shown as ratio of (a) heat flow vs temperature. (b) Swelling vs time [82].Polysaccharide-Based Polymeric Gels 25
1.4.4 Miscellaneous Properties
Apart from the properties discussed above, polysaccharide-based polymeric gels have exhibited 
(and continue to do so) various physicochemical and some other properties. Several instances are 
highlighted as follows:
• Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were incorporated into cellulose nanofibers (CNF) gel. The 
gelation process caused the shrinking of CNT/CNF gel film. These CNF/CNT gel films 
showed a conductivity of 5.20 s/cm after treatment with alkali, which is almost threefold 
higher than the CNF/CNT film (without alkali treatment), at 20wt% CNTs, Conductivity 
further improved to, as high as 17.4 s/cm, when adding 50wt% CNTs. This high-den￾sity 3D network provides for adequate electron transport pathways and gives the gel film 
remarkable electrical conductive properties [84].
• In the last decades, there has been a notable increasing interest in the development of plas￾tics from polysaccharides as an alternative to replace synthetic plastics films. Therefore, a 
plasticized cassava starch matrix composite reinforced by a multiwalled carbon nanotube 
(MWCNT) and hercynite (FeAl2O4) nanomaterial was developed. This nanofiller hybrid 
shows strong mechanical interlocking with the matrix and provides excellent stability in 
water, ensuring a good dispersion in the starch matrix. The composite containing 0.04wt% 
of the nanohybrid filler displays tremendous increments of 370% in Young’s modulus, 
350% in tensile toughness, and 70% decrease in water vapor permeability. The introduc￾tion of plasticizers such as glycerol and water induces crystallization without deterioration 
of the tensile strength [85].
• The effects on physicochemical properties of “in vitro” starch digestibility of composite 
potato starch/protein blends have been investigated. The proteins in blends were taken as 
0%, 5%, 10%, or 15% during processing (i.e., cooking, cooling, and reheating). The results 
showed that the protein in the blend proportionally restricted starch granule swelling dur￾ing cooking and facilitated amylopectin recrystallization during cold storage. It was seen 
that starch protein interaction reduced starch digestibility of the processed blends [86].
1.5 APPLICATIONS
The fascinating physicochemical, mechanical, rheological, structural and other unique properties 
of Polysaccharide-based polymeric gels made them to find applications in various fields of technol￾ogy and are used in innumerable systems. It is not possible to discuss every aspect in an elaborated 
manner, yet we have tried to list some prominent applications and presented several instances to 
elucidate their wide range of scope and prospects in field of biomedics, industry, and agriculture. 
1.5.1 Biomedical Applications
1.5.1.1 Drug Delivery
• Controlled release: Smart hydrogels, with high water content, soft and rubbery consistency, 
and low interfacial tension, and biological fluids are considered as excellent drug delivery 
systems for various bioactive molecules [87]. Characteristics like the swelling behavior in an 
aqueous medium, pH and/or temperature sensitivity, and zero-order kinetics play important 
roles in the development of hydrogel-based drug delivery systems [88]. The pH-responsive 
bacterial cellulose (BC)-g-PAA hydrogels prepared by electron beam (EB) irradiation were 
explored as an oral delivery system for proteins by using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a 
model protein drug. BSA is loaded in the hydrogel via swelling diffusion method, and the 26 Polysaccharides
entrapment efficiency (EE) of BSA was 4,055%. Hydrogels with greater swelling exhibited 
great EE. It was found that less than 10% of BSA was released in simulated gastric fluids 
(SGF) due to lower swelling of hydrogels at acidic pH 1.6, and a maximum release of 90% 
was observed at simulated intestinal fluids (SIF), because of higher swelling of hydrogel at 
higher pH 6.8. Subsequent conformational stability analyses indicated that the structural 
integrity and bioactivity of released BSA were maintained [89].
• Targeted release: Some dangerous pathogenic strains such as Methicillium-resistant 
Staphylococcus aureus are resistant to the wide range of conventional antibiotics. 
Antimicrobial peptides (AmPs) are remarkable antibacterial drugs, which can be used 
instead of conventional antibiotics due to their membrane targeting activity, especially 
against both gram-negative and gram-positive multidrug-resistant strains of pathogenic 
bacteria. Among these novel carriers, polysaccharide-based nanogels have incredible 
properties such as high-loading capacity, stimuli-responsive release behavior, simple large￾scale production, and thermodynamic stability.
1.5.1.2 Tissue Engineering
Recently, some successful strategies have been constructed to prepare hydrogels with enhanced 
mechanical performance and other attractive properties, such as double network hydrogels and 
nanocomposite hydrogel, which are promising for tissue engineering applications [90,91].
CNCs (cellulose nanocrystals), which are typically isolated from cellulose, have been widely used 
as fillers to reinforce polymeric hydrogels due to their favorable mechanical properties and intrinsic 
biocompatibility. The unique aspect ratio and plenty of active –OH groups on their surface make 
CNCs a remarkable precursor to prepare a solid stabilizer. Yang et al. reported injectable hydrogels 
based on adipic acid dihydrazine-modified CMC, and aldehyde-modified dextran reinforced with 
CNCs, and aldehyde-functionalized CNCs (CHO-CNCs). Gelation occurred within seconds as the 
hydrogel components were extruded from double-barrel syringe, and the CNCs were observed to be 
evenly distributed throughout the composites. Swelling tests showed that all the CNCs reinforced 
hydrogels could maintain their structure for more than 60days both in water and in 10mM PBS, sug￾gesting the possibility of long-term applications. The CHO-CNCs could act both as filler and a chem￾ical crosslinker, making the hydrogels more elastic, more stable, and capable of facilitating higher 
NP loadings without compromising the mechanical strength compared to hydrogels with unmodified 
CNCs. Cytotoxicity tests found that both the starting components and the hydrogels showed good 
cytocompatiblity against NIH 3T3 fibroblast cells. Combined with their syringeability, the prepared 
CNC-reinforced injectable hydrogels could fill in irregular cavities and shapes without the need for 
pre-shape forming processing, thus they were found to be promising for bone tissue engineering.
The introduction of inorganic NPs (nanoparticles), such as LAPONITE, hydroxyapatite (HAp), 
and titanium doxide, can also reinforce cellulose-based hydrogels for bone tissue engineering appli￾cations. Boyer and colleagues developed a LAPONITE NP reinforce silated HPMC (Si-HPMC) 
hydrogel, in which the LAPONITE NPs were self-setting within the gel structure of Si_HPMS, 
resulting in a hybrid interpenetrating network (IPN). This IPN structure increased the mechanical 
properties of the hydrogel without interfering with the O2 diffusion and cell viability after gelifica￾tion. The ability of the hybrid scaffold containing the Si-HPMC/LAPOTINE hydrogel and chon￾drogenic cells to form cartilaginous tissue in vivo was investigated during 6week implantation in 
subcutaneous pockets of nude mice. Histological analysis of the composite constructs revealed the 
formation of cartilage-like tissue with the extracellular matrix containing glycosaminoglycans and 
collagens. These results indicated the prepared Si-HPMC/LAPOTINE hydrogels have great poten￾tial for cartilage defect repairs.
Moreover, the morphology, inner pore structure, and uniformity of hydrogels play an important 
role in determining their biomedical applications. 3D printing technology provides a unique opportu￾nity to develop biomedical scaffolds with uniform or gradient porosity required for tissue rapair and 
regeneration using biocompatible cellular-based nanocomposites. By 3D printing technology, Sultan Polysaccharide-Based Polymeric Gels 27
et al. fabricated CNC-based hydrogel scaffolds with uniform and/or gradient porosity from a hydro￾gel ink of sodium alginate (SA) and gelatin reinforced with CNCs. The CNCs provided favorable rhe￾ological properties required for 3D printing. The printed scaffolds were crosslinked sequentially via 
covalent and ionic interactions, resulting in dimensionally stable hydrogel scaffolds with a pore size 
of 80–2,125 run and nanoscaled pore wall roughness which were favorable for cell interaction [89].
1.5.1.3 Wound Healing
Cellulose-based hydrogels are promising wound dressing materials since they are biocompatible, 
biodegradable, and environmentally friendly. Anjum et al. [92] developed a composite material con￾taining nano-silver nanohydrogels (nSnH) along with Aloe vera and curcumin that promote antimi￾crobial activity, wound healing, and injection control. A PVA/polyethylene oxide/CMC matrix was 
used as a gel system to blend with nSnH, Aloe vera, and curcumin and was coated onto hydrogel 
polyester fabric to develop antimicrobial dressings. The cumulative release of Ag from the dressing 
was found to be about 42% of the total loading after 48hours. The antimicrobial activity of the dress￾ings was demonstrated against both S. aureus and E. coli. All of the dressings showed bacteria colony 
reduction above 70%, and the Gel/nSnH/Aloe was found to lead to complete (100%) reduction of S. 
aureus. In vivo wound healing was carried out on full thickness skin wounds created on Swiss albino 
mice. After 16days, the Gel/nSnH/Aloe treated wounds were healed 100% with minimum scarring. 
By histological studies, Gel/nSnH/Aloe treated wound tissues were found to exhibit a thinner epider￾mal layer and organized collagen deposition without inflammation of healed tissues [93].
These results indicated that nSnH and Aloe vera–based dressing materials could be promising 
candidates for wound dressing [89].
1.5.1.4 Ophthalmic Uses
Cellulose derivatives such as methylcellulose (MC), carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), and hydroxyl 
propyl methyl cellulose (HPMC) are naturally occurring polymers with thermo-responsive proper￾ties. They are commercially available in various products for the treatment of dry eyes, including 
Murocel (MC), Celluvisc (CMC sodium), and Ultra Tears (HPMC). Combining cellulose deriva￾tives with poloxamers generates gelling systems with enhanced properties to favor ophthalmic drug 
delivery, e.g., huronic F-127 in combination with HPMC as a viscosity enhancing agent, and pro￾longs the ocular residence time of the drug. Other polymers which are investigated for enhancing 
ocular drug delivery include Xyloglucan.
A novel stimuli-responsive gel was designed by Yu et al. [94] for ophthalmic drug delivery. The 
hydrogel was made by chemical crosslinking of the biocompatible and pH-sensitive carboxymethyl 
chitosan (CMC) with the temperature-sensitive poloxamer 407 (F127) using gluteraldehyde as a 
crosslinking agent to form a pH-induced thermo-sensitive sol-gel transition at a very low concen￾tration. The gel maintained controlled release of a model drug and showed no toxicity to human 
corneal epithelial cells [95].
Moreover, preparation of polysaccharide-based contact lenses, made from chitosan/gelatin com￾posites were successfully synthesized and the products showed good properties [96]. The incorpo￾ration of non-crosslinked hydrophilic polysaccharides such as hyaluronic acid [97] and hydroxyl 
propylmethyl cellulose [98] in contact lenses provides a reduction in ocular dryness caused by the 
lenses and minimizes protein sorption through their slow release and effectively function as a wet￾ting agent on the lens surface.
1.5.1.5 Bio-imaging
Bio-imaging such as fluorescent imaging (FLI), MRI, USI, photoacoustic imaging and tomographic 
scanning, has been recognized as an important technology in life science and medical fields. 
Fluorescent materials can be embedded in cellulose-based hydrogels, these materials include CdSe/
ZnS QDs carbon dots (CDs), rare-earth doped phosphor (SrAl2O4;Eu2+, Dy3+), and S,N-codoped gra￾phene QDs, For instance, fluorescent cellulose QDs hydrogels were obtained by embedding CdSe/28 Polysaccharides
ZnS QDS in cellulose materials in NaoH/urea aqueous system via a mild chemical crosslinking 
process. These cellulose QDs hydrogels were found to exhibit a transparent appearance under vis￾ible light, while under a UV lamp, a single color emission (yellowish-green) was observed with QDs 
(0.06wt%) indicating a high efficiency for the fluorescent emission (Figure 1.31). QDs with sizes 
in the range of 2.8–3.6nm emitted different colors from green to red, depending on the size of the 
QDs. This suggested that the optical properties of QDs could be well maintained in the hydrogels, 
which are promising for applications in the fields of fluoroimmunoassay and biological labeling.
Finger print FLI is one of the most prominent technologies in the field of forensic medicine. 
Recently, Hai et al. [100] developed a C10-SCN stimulated reversible response lanthanide lumines￾cent Tb (m)-CMC complex hydrogel, which consisted of 2,6-dimethyl pyridin-4-amine, functional￾ized with a CMC-binding aptamer and a terburin (m)-2-(2-aminobenzamide) benzoic acid complex 
modified with CMC, upon irradiation with 270nm UV light, the imaging information of the finger￾print could be quenched and recovered by ClO-/SCN-regulation, respectively. This results in revers￾ible on/off conversion of the luminescence signals for the encryption and decryption of multilevels 
of information as shown in Figure 1.32. These complex hydrogels can ensure the confidentiality of 
fingerprint information and thus opens the possibility of using tunable luminescent hydrogels for 
fingerprint information detection, security protection, and storage.
1.5.1.6 Self-Healing Sensors
The development of smart wearable devices has become a research hotspot due to their potential 
applications in health monitoring. Self-healing devices can restore their structure and functionality 
after damaging, endowing them with enhanced durability, reliability, and safety. Self-healing hydro￾gels have attracted significant attention for the development of self-healing wearable devices (pressure 
sensors) for human motion detection, due to their viscoelasticity, conductivity, and biocompatibility. 
Self-healing hydrogels should simultaneously meet the required mechanical toughness and excel￾lent mobility properties, which are two contradictory characteristics. These criteria are met by CNCs 
which are commonly used as fillers to reinforce hydrogels due to their unique properties. Recently, 
CNCs have been successfully used to create integrated conductive hydrogels with both excellent self￾healing and mechanical performance. Liu and coworkers developed a conductive, elastic, self-healing, 
and strain-sensitive polymer network hydrogel called “F-hydrogel”. This was done via covalent cross￾linking of PVA and PVP, in which a “hard” Fe3+ crosslinked CNC network with dynamic CNC-Fe3+
coordination bonds was interconnected as reinforcing domains. These “F-hydrogels” displayed 
FIGURE 1.31 A cellulose QDs hydrogel with 0.06wt% QDs (3.0nm) under visible and UV lamp, respec￾tively [99].Polysaccharide-Based Polymeric Gels 29
ultrasensitive, stable, and repeatable resistance variations upon mechanical deformations and could 
be applied tightly on the skin surface, which were promising in the application of wearable devices. 
Based on these characteristics of the “F-hydrogels”, a wearable soft strain sensor was assembled to 
monitor finger-point motions, breathing, and even a slight blood pulse. When the “F-hydrogel” sensor 
was put on the wrist of a volunteer, the blood pulse changes before and after the exercise.
Progress has been made in recent past in self-healing hydrogels, which are conductive and 
mechanically durable. Different methods are adopted for designing self-healing sensors based on 
hydrogels [101], which are biocompatible and respond to various stimuli such as strain, concentera￾tion, temperature, pH, etc., and these changes are detected via electrical signals (Figure 1.33).
1.5.2 Industrial Applications
1.5.2.1 Food Packaging
Polysaccharides have played a tremendous role in replacing synthetic polymers for being biodegrad￾able and biocompatible. They are used in food packaging in the form of edible films, membranes, 
coatings, and even modified to be used as thermoplastics for making packaging materials [102].

image. (c and d) Luminescence images of the fingerprint in response to ClO- (c) and SCN- (d) [100].30 Polysaccharides
FIGURE 1.33 The figure above shows various types of bonding in hydrogels and their response as sensors 
via electrical signals [101].Polysaccharide-Based Polymeric Gels 31
1.5.2.2 Food Additives
They are also used as approved food additives; as thickeners, emulsifiers, stabilizers, and gelling 
agents in various food items. They are also used as edible films for preserving fish, fruits, vegetables, 
and dairy products. Polysaccharide gels are used in pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, fibers, textile dying, 
and textile printing, and also in the manufacture of various petroleum products. Polysaccharide nano￾composites have become increasingly important in offering a green alternative to synthetic polymers 
for preparing soft nanomaterials. They have been used in composites with hard nanomaterials, such 
as metal nanoparticles and carbon-based nanomaterials [103]. Polysaccharide-based hydrogels due 
to their swelling property are made use of for making SAPs which in turn find wide range of appli￾cations in field of biomedics, agriculture, wastewater treatment, and in the manufacture of different 
types of diapers. They are also used in designing smart polymer. These so-called “smart polymers” 
have ability to sense environmental stimuli including very small changes in pH, temperature, light, 
pressure, etc. In batteries and energy storages devices, polysaccharide gels such as dense cellulose￾based polymer gels are used as electrolytes in lithium-ion batteries. These are renewable low cost 
and have high discharge capacity. Meanwhile, researches are on for designing the next-generation, 
all-cellulose energy storage devices, having improved cyclic stability and specific capacitance [104].
1.5.3 Agricultural Applications
1.5.3.1 Fertilizer Release
Polysaccharide-based gels are used to release compounds like fertilizers into the soil in a controlled 
manner, by which their benefit remains to be there, for the longer period of time. The desired bioac￾tive agents are incorporated into polymer matrix, and the gel expansion is controlled by the presence 
of moisture, which leads to their swelling. The controlled release effect is optimum usually when 
the soil water content is lower than 45% (w/w), temperature is below 35°C, and the soil pH is in the 
range from weak acid to neutral [105].
1.5.3.2 Pest Control
Hydrogels are also used for the controlled allowance or release of other chemicals which protect the 
yield against pests (pesticides), weeds (herbicides), and fungus (fungicides).
1.5.3.3 Soil Conditioning
In agricultural field, hydrogels are used for increasing the amount of available moisture in the root 
zones, thus implying longer intervals between irrigation and for improving the physical properties 
of soil which include water-holding pores, bulk density, porosity, structural stability, infiltration, 
and hydraulic conductivity. With controlled release mechanism, the functionalized polymers can be 
increased for enhancing the absorption of nutrients by plants.
1.6 CONCLUSION
Most of the polysaccharides are cheap, easily available, and important ones like cellulose and chitin 
are present in nature in abundance. Due to their biodegradable, biocompatible, and renewable nature, 
as well as their nontoxic and minimal environmental impact, polysaccharides naturally become the 
most preferred choice for the application of hydrogels and all other types of gels. For hydrogels 
preparations, they have the ability to be used alone or with various kinds of copolymers or/and 
nanomaterials to form unique composites which show extraordinary performances. Polysaccharide￾based polymeric gels have usually a lot of hydroxyl groups present in their structures, which is a 
pathway for their various types of derivatizations. This makes them useful in diverse applications. 
With desirable and modifiable properties such as mechanical, rheological, swelling, physicochemi￾cal and being stimuli-responsive, etc.; polysaccharide-based polymeric gels presently have numer￾ous applications and a great potential for interesting research with bright future prospects.32 Polysaccharides

Recycling, and Sustainability

2.1 PREFACE
As the world’s ability to cope with the fast-rising manufacturing of disposable plastic products over￾whelms the world’s ability to deal with them, plastic pollution has become one of the most impor￾tant environmental challenges. The low cost of producing primary plastic packaging materials from 
petroleum resources, when compared to recycled plastics, has resulted in the largest virgin plastic 
market, resulting in significant amounts of plastic in landfills and the natural environment [1]. Plastic 
pollution is especially noticeable in impoverished Asian and African countries, where rubbish col￾lection systems are sometimes ineffective or non-existent [2]. However, the industrialized world, 
particularly in nations with poor recycling rates, has difficulty collecting discarded plastics properly. 
Plastic waste has become so pervasive that efforts are underway to draft a global treaty. Plastics are 
synthetic polymers that are qualified for being utilized in plenty of industries, whether as tools or as 
products. The manufacturing and development of thousands of new plastic products have surged in 
recent years, altering the modern age to the point that life would be unrecognizable without them [2]. 
However, the conveniences that plastics give have resulted in a throw-away culture that exposes the 
material’s dark side: single-use plastics (SUPs) now account for a large percentage of all plastic manu￾factured every day. Many of these products, such as plastic bags and food wrappers, have a short lifes￾pan but because of their durability, they often stay intact for a long time in the environment resulting 
in fragmentation that produces microplastics. Over time, more discoveries of SUP pollution have 
been recorded in different environmental media globally, including soil and oceans. There is a grow￾ing push to reduce SUPs because of the accumulating research and results indicating that they pose a 
threat to plant growth, land animals, and marine ecosystems. As a result, there have been proposals 
of guidelines and plans to reduce SUP usage, as well as some suggestions for reducing SUP waste [3].
Plastic pollution is the accumulation of synthetic plastic items in the environment to the point 
where they pose a threat to wildlife habitats, along with human populations. Bakelite’s development 
in 1907 ushered in a material revolution by introducing genuinely synthetic plastic resins into global 
commerce. Plastics had been discovered to be persistent pollutants in numerous environmental 
niches, from Mount Everest to the bottom of the sea, by the end of the 20th century. Plastics have 
gained increased attention as large-scale pollution, whether they are mistaken for food by animals 
or just cause substantial visual blight.
Can plastic pollution major current environmental issue be addressed by biomaterials? This 
type of material, whether alone or in combination, can achieve commercially functional properties 
of a matter known as bioplastics and biocomposites. Made from renewable resources, they have 
the tendency of being naturally recycled [4]. Waste management is the main key player. The nega￾tive environmental implications of the extensive use of synthetic plastics in the production process 38 Polysaccharides
have given the right impetus to biopolymers produced by biologically derived plastics as a likely 
viable replacement in a variety of fields. The true edge, though, is creating novel substitutes exploit￾ing food waste whether it is industrially or agriculturally sourced. In the past few years, there has 
been a considerable rise in the test results of materials produced using biowaste. Research institu￾tions and project managers have been drawn to the great number of raw materials which is abundant 
and may be utilized to produce new alternatives, in addition to the many young researchers that have 
embraced these different approaches in the time now being [5]. They have emerged as a suitable 
choice for consumers and producers looking for an alternative to ubiquitous plastics. Furthermore, 
the environmental fate of such materials solos, or blends, is remarkably friendly [6]. The name 
appears promising at first glance, suggesting a sustainable product, yet, is bioplastic, however, the 
answer to our environmental woes? A single-use item with the feel of plastic but none of the guilt? 
Such an effective alternative requires a thorough knowledge of both the source of the widespread 
use of plastics and the ecological consequences, therefore, sound multidisciplinary research to out￾reach reliable solutions [2].
2.2 LIMITATIONS, CHALLENGES, AND OPPORTUNITIES
Despite having many advantages, plastics are denounced because of their key features; durability 
and chemical stability which elongate their degradation process [7]. The versatility of plastic uti￾lization has led to intensifying our consumption of such lightweight, cheap, and durable material. 
Flexible packaging, often known as film-based packaging, is any piece of material that might be 
easily reshaped, bags, labels, and wraps for instance. Flexible packaging is made using a special￾ized film that has a specific set of properties for a given use. In another sense, film-based packaging 
is used because of its large spectrum of protective functions which gives the greatest properties of 
materials like plastic, paper, and aluminum while using a fewer amount of them [8]. Low-density 
polyethylene (LDPE) films, for example, offer a high degree of transparency and moderate stretch￾ability, making them ideal for use as shopping bags. High-density polyethylene (HDPE) films, on 
the other hand, have a certain degree of opacity and limited stretchability, making them suitable 
for use as drinks packages [9]. Building on the industry of consumer-level products, it is critical to 
investigate the challenges of regulations that may be in the favor of the environment, especially the 
techniques of handling the long-lasting stage in the life of film-based packaging, to be able to design 
and set up sustainable solutions [10].
Plastic waste can be handled in a variety of ways, including dumping in the landfills, burn￾ing, and reincorporating into new products. However, because each of these activities has different 
effects on the environment, determining the optimum option can be challenging. Discussing the 
burden of plastics and their consequences on behalf; treatment strategies and patterns, recycling 
technologies, and policies are a must to assess the possibilities of reducing the negative conse￾quences on the environment [11]. A Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), perhaps, is a tool for evaluating 
all the different impacts of how a process could interact with the environment and comparing it with 
other processes which may be one of many needed solutions to take a step forward into reducing 
such negative effect.
Although plastics are easily pliable, which means they could be molded to form various shapes. 
Moreover, when adding the right additive, stabilizer for example, they can have several transpar￾ency, thinness, elasticity, and thermal qualities, regardless, plastic production, consumption, and 
waste generation are on the rise, posing a growing threat to the marine and terrestrial ecosystems 
and turning their most appealing aspects into a curse. Such pollution has gotten a lot of attention 
in the last years, when it polluted ecosystems, ruined the aesthetics of seas, and had severe effects 
on marine creatures. Pollution levels in the water are so high that it is impacting and threatening 
all ocean life. Plastic is one of the most prevalent causes of marine pollution; bags are frequently 
swallowed by marine species, resulting in the deaths of many. It dissolves into microplastic, which 
is a major hazard of untreated plastic waste. Micro and nano-plastics have been shown to penetrate Environmental Aspects, Recycling, and Sustainability 39
the tissues of animals, marine organisms, and humans, posing serious risks. Furthermore, to extend 
the life of plastic, manufacturers are adding stabilizers, causing more problems. Plastics can adsorb 
and release pollutants to and from the environment due to their production process which includes 
dangerous chemicals. These are all found in the bodies of animals, according to research published 
in 2018, by The State of Plastics, and eventually, contaminate the human food chain [7].
2.2.1 The Three Major Phenomena
The pollution is rising, three separate phenomena have resulted which are the origin of causing such 
this devastating mess… First is shopping bags and film materials thrown all over the places, being 
single-use non-biodegradable plastics. Second, the non-recyclability of plastics: the necessity for high￾quality recycling must be valued by society and the market. The third is human behavior: our lack 
of knowledge about pollution and apathy toward it. Comparatively, little has been done to persuade 
society to discourage excessive plastic use, implement recycling practices, and raise awareness of the 
various types of plastic and their potential to harm as well as benefit human health and other species. 
This contrasts with the speed at which plastics have permeated millions of uses across all cultures [12].
2.3 SINGLE-USE, NON-BIODEGRADABLE PLASTICS
The majority of increasement in plastic production has been attributed to plastic packaging, which 
makes up more than 40% of non-fiber materials. Plastic packaging makes about half of all world￾wide plastic waste because most plastic components are only meant to be used once [7]. SUPs are 
gaining popularity around the world, especially with regard to packaging and consumables like 
shopping bags and disposable tableware that are intended to be used only once [13]. A consid￾erable portion of the material generated has a transient purpose and is quickly discarded. SUPs 
that are discarded, as well as various shapes and sizes of non-recycled plastic materials, pose the 
greatest threat. All of them eventually make their way to the seas via landfills, water bodies, and 
rivers. Plastic has the ability to endure in sea surface waters, where it will eventually assemble in 
remote areas of the world’s oceans. In subtropical areas between California and Hawaii, the Great 
Pacific Garbage Patch (GPGP) is a significant ocean plastic accumulation zone. Recent research has 
revealed that the north-central Pacific Ocean’s gyres have molded a floating island of plastic the size 
of the State of Taxes [14]. A key technological advancement was the use of synthetic fibers in fishing 
and aquaculture gear, yet gear losses became a large source of ocean plastic pollution. Ghost nets, 
also known as lost or discarded fishing nets, are a specific problem because they directly impact 
marine environments all around the world [15]. According to reports, by 2050, the world’s oceans 
would have more pollutants, primarily plastic components, than the entire creatures in the oceans.
Non-biodegradable plastics, especially single-use ones, have lots of consequences on not only 
our health but also wildlife and the environment. They do not decompose or degenerate biologi￾cally. Agreeing to certain findings, laws simply based on the thickness of the plastic bags do not 
reduce their use. However, rules concentrated on banning the utilization of single-use plastic bags 
and imposing higher charges and levies on customers, resulting in a dramatic reduction in the use of 
plastic bags. Overall, findings demonstrate that public policy or laws can greatly influence attitude, 
perception, and behavior change toward biodegradable materials or ecofriendly activities [16].
Particularly single-use non-biodegradable plastics have negative effects on the environment, wild￾life, and human health. They do not biologically decay or decompose. According to some research, 
legislation that only consider the thickness of plastic bags have little effect on the use of plastic bags. 
However, regulations focused on outlawing the use of single-use plastic bags and increasing user 
fees and levies, which caused a sharp decline in the use of plastic bags. Overall, the results show that 
laws or public policy can have a significant impact on changing people’s attitudes, perceptions, and 
behaviors toward using biodegradable products or engaging in ecofriendly activities.40 Polysaccharides
2.4 PLASTICS ARE NOT RECYCLED
Plastic has virtually surpassed every other man-made material in recent years, with production 
roughly expanding in recent years. For instance, with a lifespan of decades, construction accounts 
for half of all steel production. According to a study that was published in the peer-reviewed journal 
Science Advances, half of all plastic produced ends up in landfills in less than a year. Due to its 
durability, plastic has accumulated over time. The vast majority is being disposed of as waste, either 
in landfills or in the environment. That is to say, a large portion of it finally finds up in the oceans, 
which serve as the last sink. Not only “You can’t manage what you don’t measure,” but also, “It’s 
not simply that we make a lot; it’s that we make more year after year” [17].
2.5 HUMAN BEHAVIOR
Raising public awareness of the immediate impact of plastic pollution and the health dangers of 
plastic itself is critical to educating the public about plastic management and consumption. Since 
plastic is regarded as an environmentally dangerous material, several projects aiming at transferring 
knowledge about the consequences of plastic pollution and consumption have been taking place. In 
addition, the relationship between culture and community behavior in terms of single-use plastic is 
the most important to be addressed.
Research shows that knowledge isn’t the only thing that will change behavior. Usually, it’ll 
require a lot more. The benefits shall be tangible, and the behavior to be doable and within their 
capabilities. One essential holdback is the near impossibility of avoiding single-use plastic. But it 
isn’t just a case of people forgetting. It makes no difference if one carries his water bottle if there 
isn’t anywhere to refill it. For others, it’s a matter of personal preference that using their own prod￾ucts is safer. In many cases, the consumer has little choice except to accept plastic. And since it’s 
so frequent, it becomes a matter of habit. We go to the supermarket, purchase some produce, place 
it in a plastic bag, and leave [18]. Plastic products have undoubtedly improved the comfort and ease 
of our lives. Largely utilized outcomes, on the other hand, offer a landfill nightmare, particularly 
when recycling alternatives are limited, and most of the material is non-biodegradable. Another 
benefit of plastic is the significant improvements in disease control have come from using single￾use, sterile plastic products in medical fields because they reduce the possibility of cross-infection. 
Of course, these things need to be disposed of or recycled safely and properly. The first step toward 
changing the products and practices we take for granted despite these and other developments is 
to change our attitudes.
2.6 CIRCULAR ECONOMY FOR PLASTIC
A circular economy is an innovative approach to tackling plastic pollution that incorporates tech￾nical advancements, local creativity, commerce, business models, and job possibilities. Making 
plastics from plants instead of fossil fuels, redesigning products to use fewer materials, promoting 
recycling and reuse, and recycling plastic waste are all ways to maximize the positive effects of 
plastics while minimizing their negative effects on ecosystems, human health, and the environment. 
Local innovations that play an important part in the circular economy’s ability to reduce plastic pol￾lution, require marketing, investment, and before all that to believe it is an idea of worthiness to put 
any kind of effort.
Historically, cleaning-up events have been used to combat plastic pollution, but the only effective 
solution is to determine the key points or root causes… This kind of solution may be letting go of the 
current “take, make, waste” linear economy, which runs on massive amounts of cheap, readily avail￾able energy and other resources and generates disposable products. The circular economy, on the 
other hand, aims to keep resources in use for as long as possible, keeping as much value as possible, 
and then recovering and repurposing products and materials once their functional life has ended. Environmental Aspects, Recycling, and Sustainability 41
Its objective is to design waste materials out of the equation, leaving restoration and regeneration 
to take their place.
About 4% of the world’s non-renewable oil and gas production is needed for plastics, and an 
additional 3%–4% is needed to power their production. Plastic is utilized in the packaging of 
disposable and other short-lived products that are discarded right after. We can conclude that our 
current plastic use is unsustainable based on these two data alone. Furthermore, vast amounts of 
waste plastics are found as garbage in landfills and natural habitats all over the world due to the 
durability of the polymers utilized. Recycling, which is one of the most dynamic solutions now 
available to alleviate the damage caused by plastic. It may reduce the oil usage, greenhouse gas, 
and the amount of waste that needs to be disposed of. Poor women and children in some cities, 
such as Bangladesh, gather used plastic materials and sell them to small commercial enterprises, 
who clean the waste and give it to specific industries for recycling to be again a new product sold 
on the market. As a result of the collection, processing, and trading of plastic waste, poor and small 
traders have found work. However, more research into the circular economy and the management 
of plastic pollution is required.
The extensive use along with the environmental consequences of synthetic plastics in product 
manufacture has reignited interest in biopolymers made from plant, animal, or microbial sources 
as a strong equivalent for a variety of applications. The real thing is creating new materials from 
abundant resources like food waste rather than especially needed materials, which come at a cost to 
the environment in any case. The number of raw materials that can be used has encouraged research 
that has been tremendously adopted by many entrepreneurs who create outstanding products using 
waste in recent years [19, 20].
2.7 RECYCLING VS. UPCYCLING
Nowadays, pollution, climate change, and destroyed ecosystem are matters of concern for interna￾tional organizations and activists. There has been slow transition from linear economy of “take, 
make, and waste” to a circular economy of “make, use, and recycle.” Governmental and private 
policies are becoming stricter in many nations, and the manufacturing industries are continually 
shifting to operate under these obligations. It is vital to lessen the negative effects of waste materi￾als and their by-products on the environment, including contamination of the air, water, and green￾house gases. In the future, repurposing the materials of waste in a way that consumes less energy 
than manufacturing them from scratch may be the way to go.
The process of breaking down waste and reusing it as raw materials to generate new products is 
referred to as recycling. In contrast, Reiner Pilz coined upcycling as “the method of recycling waste 
materials in their existing state without having to break them down into their original state” [21]. 
Although, clearly, this procedure uses less energy than typical recycling. It does, however, present 
its own difficulties.
2.7.1 What Exactly Is Recycling?
Recycling is the process of creating products by turning waste into new raw materials. Interestingly, 
reduce, reuse, and recycle (3R process) have become popular. Production and consumer trends are 
gradually adopting this method. Millions of tons of waste are generated worldwide, of which only a 
few are recycled [22]. This shows that there is room for improvement in the recycling business. The 
main purpose of recycling was not to eliminate waste but to reduce its impact on the environment. 
For example, energy recovery is a type of recycling aimed at extracting energy by converting non￾recyclable waste into heat, electricity, or fuel energy. It accounts for most of the recycling process 
around the world. This is usually a waste incinerator, which can cause harmful emissions as it is 
closely monitored, restricted, and regularly assessed.42 Polysaccharides
2.7.2 And Upcycling?
Upcycling is a type of recycling that is sometimes referred to as “creative recycling.” It is not the 
same as recycling. Instead, upcycling, on the other hand, entails taking something that would other￾wise be wasted and improving it in some way to make it useful again. This is an economically and 
ecologically interesting trial as it is becoming increasingly difficult to directly procure raw materi￾als from natural resources. Materials such as aluminum are obtained by secondary recycling, not 
by primary sources from the mining industry. It is the process of reusing waste without breaking it 
down into basic forms to create higher quality or more valuable products. The term “upcycling” is 
new, but the philosophy behind it is not, it aims to reuse the waste in ways that increase its value and 
quality, rather than simply reusing it.
Widely recognized as two of the upcycling pioneers, Braungart and McDonough highlight the 
importance of considering future upcycling when designing products [23]. This principle is also 
known as “waste creation.” Waste can be perfected using several strategies such as reuse planning, 
material optimization, and waste efficient sourcing. Waste disposal can be done from an upcycling 
perspective by creating products that are easy to assemble or disassemble and can include future 
redesigns as needed, faster and easier [24]. Assessing the environmental impact of a material is 
important and a common way of doing so is the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). A “cradle-to-grave” 
kind of analysis that identifies the environmental impact of a product at every stage of its lifecycle, 
from obtaining raw materials through the product manufacturing to disposing of it at the end.
To create new sustainable materials for production, some companies, like Sabic, have even started 
fusing the recycling and upcycling processes. By upcycling post-consumer recycled polyethylene 
terephthalate (rPET) into more valuable polybutylene terephthalate (PBT) compound resins, Sabic 
can enhance the properties of the material while also extending the useful life of PET products and 
minimizing plastic waste [25].
2.8 RECYCLABILITY
High recyclability refers to a material’s ability to be easily recycled, as well as the fact that its mate￾rial qualities do not significantly depreciate from those of the original material. Some products are 
difficult to recycle or upcycle owing to their exceptional design/application or the nature of the mate￾rials used to produce them. For example, foam polystyrene is difficult and expensive to recycle. It’s 
also difficult to recycle products with incompatible components because they’re hard to separate. 
Plastics like HDPE, PET, and PVC are typically easier to recycle because they are commonly uti￾lized as liquid containers or piping components. Other plastics, such as LDPE, are commonly used 
in food packaging, as squeezable tubes, which means they are regularly contaminated to the point 
where recycling them would be more energy-intensive than manufacturing them from scratch. Dual￾material products, such as glossy paperboard used to make juice boxes, are also not easy to separate 
their components into the original state. Certain stuff that can’t be recycled, instead, can be upcycled, 
and the other way around. And of what can be upcycled rather than recycled is the foam polystyrene, 
also known as Styrofoam, copper tubing and wires can easily be recycled rather than upcycled [26].
2.9 FROM BIOWASTE BURDEN TO USEFUL BIO-BASED PLASTIC
Biowaste makes up a significant amount of municipal solid waste (MSW). The constant generation of 
waste is causing management issues. Traditional waste discarding processes, such as incineration and 
landfilling, emit gases that may contribute to global warming. Plastic consumption is also fast expanding 
because of increased industrialization and population growth. Access to clean and green alternatives 
is critical for sustainable development to address this ever-increasing need. Researchers, scientists, 
governments, and stakeholders must all work together to make these technologies more feasible. We 
expect that the markets for agricultural by-products and recycled plastics will continue to expand. Environmental Aspects, Recycling, and Sustainability 43
Then, we’re committed to aiding product designers and manufacturers in incorporating bio-based 
materials into high-quality, long-lasting materials that are also more likely to be preferred by the 
environment and people.
2.9.1 Bioplastics
The modern world has a significant interest in sustainable alternatives to plastics and espouses any 
budding technology that is driving that growth. Traditional plastics are made from fossil fuels, 
while innovative plastics can also be made from renewable biomass. Bioplastic is simply plastic 
made from plant or other biological material rather than petroleum. It is also known as bio-based 
plastic. One can argue that every material either can or will undergo the process of biodegradation, 
which is theoretically very correct, but also not very accurate because practically some materials’ 
behaviors are much slower than others, that some materials can take decades while others can take 
only a few days. That’s why we consider some materials are biodegradable and others are not [26].
Bio-based plastics were used by humans in the industry for centuries long before the discovery 
of refining oil or harnessing the monomers that were obtained from it. For example, natural rub￾ber, cellulose, and casein these materials were widely used bac —in the 18th and 19th centuries as 
resources for fibers used in functional objects such as carrying and packaging purposes [27].
Later, “Bakelite,” the first totally synthetic material, was invented by Leo Baekeland—in 1907. 
This discovery was revolutionary. For the first time, human manufacture was unrestricted by natu￾ral constraints. There was only so much wood, metal, stone, bone, and horn that mother nature 
could provide. Humans, moreover, can now develop new materials. This opened the gate to a new 
era of manufacturing in which synthetic plastics are utilized every aspect of our daily life [28]. After 
many decades of this discovery, synthetic polymers became the first option when it comes to the 
production of various stuff with a market exceeding 600 billion USD [29]. That’s because of low the 
price and the varied range of properties that can be obtained. But this of course comes with a heavy 
price and mainly on the environment.
The first patent presented a technical bioplastic was published—in 1947, by a small French com￾pany named Oraganico [30] but is now owned by Arkema [31]. They introduce Rilsan or Nylon 
11 to the market which is a bio-based material made from castor beans and the polymerization of 
11-aminoundecanoic acid. Such material has been found to have excellent mechanical properties 
and chemical resistance. Here’s a quick yet not comprehensive summary of bioplastics’ milestones:
• 1950—Amylomaize (corn with a higher than 50% amylose content) was successfully bred, 
and commercial bioplastics applications began to be explored.
• 1970—The environmental movement spurred more development in bioplastics.
• 1973— The surprising increase in the oil prices in the USA draws attention to the new 
possibilities of a plastic industry that is away from oil-based materials.
• 1989—Dr. Patrick R. Gruber succeeded to produce PLA from corn.
• 1992—Poirier, Dennis, Klomparens, Nawrath, and Somerville published a paper showing 
how polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) can be made from the plant Arabidopsis thaliana.
• 2001—Nick Tucker used grass as a base to make bio-based material that can be used in 
plastic car parts.
• 2013—The synthesis of a bioplastic produced from waste blood and a bio-based crosslink￾ing agent such as sugars or proteins has been granted a patent.
• 2018—First packaging made from a fruit, Jun Aizaki grew a fruit into a mold with the 
form of a cup and it worked.
Although the huge amount of research, the bio-based plastics with the current production lines are 
only on the order of 1% of the annual production amounts of plastic production [31]. Nevertheless, in 
the last years, this is changing because of multiple motives. Besides the research and development, 44 Polysaccharides
the continuously varying fossil raw materials prices, the rise of environmental awareness, consumer 
preference, and some economics along with government policies toward “green procurement.” All 
these reasons have contributed to increasing the market share of bioplastics with a growth rate of 
17% annually. Moreover, it’s expected to reach 30.9 billion USD by 2028 [32]. For the next years, 
various enhancements will be made in order to push the bioplastics to the level of usability of fossil￾based plastics [33].
2.9.2 Its Applications
According to European Bioplastics, for the packaging of premium and branded products with spe￾cific needs as well as organic food, there is a significant demand for bioplastics. About 2.42 million 
tons of bioplastics were produced globally in 2021, with nearly 1.15 million tons of that volume 
going to the packaging sector.
Food packaging regulations are more different and sophisticated than those for other products. 
The package’s primary functions are to store the product. The rate of change in quality, which 
includes both physical (mechanical damage during transit or storage, loss of crispness or appearance) 
and organoleptic changes (loss of taste, color, and odor), can be thought of as product protection 
[26]. Bioplastic used in food packaging is designed to protect food while also preserving its quality. 
These characteristics, as the mechanical and barrier properties of biopolymers, dependent on their 
structure, are crucial to tell how the packing material’s properties change over time while in touch 
with the food. Bioplastics’ end-use segments—presents:
• Packaging, bags for shopping.
• Waste collection bags that are compostable.
• Vegetable, fruit, meat, and egg trays and punnets.
• Catering service products that are disposable.
There are fundamental principles to verify that food packaging is functional, a set of variables listed 
below is mainly used to determine the best material for minimizing resources while maximizing 
shelf life (Table 2.1).
The continuous manufacturing of synthetic plastics will keep arising leading to more accumula￾tion hence more waste—recycling and reuse are the only strategies that can work. Even though the 
challenges that face biopolymers, unlike synthetic plastics, they are sustaining their market growth. 
This generation of polymers has shown very promising results, with an advanced ability to overtake 
traditional plastic [34].

2.10 INVEST IN NEW POSSIBILITIES
Bioplastics are being studied to wean society off fossil fuels while simultaneously addressing some 
of the environmental concerns linked to plastic waste. The synthesis and application of biowaste￾based polymer, for example, are at the forefront of this science. Being 100% organic, bioplastic has 
the ability to decompose in just a matter of few weeks whether in the soil or sea. Moreover, today’s 
techniques are innovative enough to produce bioplastics from the food waste or the unused organic 
substances. Researchers are concentrating their efforts on the use of such waste as a renewable feed￾stock for bioplastics. This waste mostly contains high-value compounds making it worthwhile to put 
it to new uses. Bioplastics made from starch are discovered to be easier to make than those made 
from other sources. Yet, the properties of such biofilms have some limitations [26]. Despite the 
green prospective that bioplastics have either in terms of carbon footprint or biodegradation, this 
class of materials is still needing research and laboratory work.
2.11 CONCLUSION AND WAY FORWARD
The demand for plastics is on a continuous rise; as a result, reducing plastic pollution will be 
one of the key difficulties. Reducing pollution to maintain human health and ecosystems would 
require proper legal measures and administration by relevant agencies. This can be accomplished 
by enforcing a strict regulatory system, encouraging users to separate their garbage, and increas￾ing municipalities’ capacity to collect as much solid waste as feasible in comparison to solid 
waste generation. Individual, family, community, and institutional levels of users’ understanding 
of the significance of going green should be raised. Governments should encourage the plastic 
industry to reduce, reuse, and recycle. This would need technological and local innovation, as 
well as favorable public engagement and funding for such projects. It would be very appreciated 
if governments issued an order banning single-use plastic within the next few years as a means 
of controlling plastic production, processing, and trade. The government may take proactive 
approach, enlisting the help of consumers and stakeholders, this must be treated seriously right 
from the start.
It is critical to consider proper plastic management and pollution reduction in a holistic manner. 
With all its obstacles, it is tough and difficult to have a completely sustainable plastic industry, but 
each country can certainly develop a system for greener and cleaner plastic production that will help 
it achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Plastic pollution management can give a new 
route for adolescents and disadvantaged populations in both urban and rural areas to have access 
to decent labor, cleaner technologies, and low-pollution plastic because of now being rapid digital 
transformation. Local and global solutions would be required, as well as investment, effective inno￾vation, and technology transfer.
The issues might be resolved by using materials that are biodegradable, bio-based, or both. 
Materials like that should be designed to ensure effective degradation while retaining their mechan￾ical properties during the “use” phase. Applications out of these bags offer benefits since they can 
be degraded, eliminating the accumulation of plastics. The use of biodegradable plastics to mitigate 
environmental pollution due to leakage in open environments is another discussed advantage; cur￾rently, this seems optimistic!

3.1 INTRODUCTION
Polysaccharides, which serve as structural components and energy storage for living cells, are the 
most abundant renewable polymers found in nature (Smith et al., 2020). Polysaccharides are com￾plex carbohydrates that are an integral part of our diet and play a vital role in many biological pro￾cesses. They are found in a variety of foods, such as fruits, vegetables, grains, and legumes, and are 
known for their high energy content, fiber content, and beneficial health effects (Li & Lin, 2021). 
It is one of the ubiquitous biopolymers with unique physical, chemical, and biological properties. 
As a biopolymer, it shows excellent characteristics and can be used in different sectors which lead 
to environmental and health benefits (AL-Oqla et al., 2022). It paves the way for the development 
of new adaptive materials for use in need-based applications. Monosaccharide building blocks are 
linked together by glycosidic linkage in a linear or highly branched order forming the backbone of 
polysaccharide (Li & Lin, 2021). Typically, more than 20 repeating units are joined to make poly￾saccharide. Starch, glycogen, and cellulose are the three most common natural polysaccharides.
To make a suitable polysaccharide, dozens of monosaccharides (homopolymer and copolymer) 
units can be combined. Starch, glycogen, and cellulose are examples of natural homopolymer-based 
polysaccharides that yield only glucose as the monosaccharide after complete hydrolysis. However, 
heteropolymers can also include amino sugars, sugar acids, and non-carbohydrate compounds in 
combination to monosaccharides. Heteropolymers, which are abundant in nature, include sub￾stances such as gums and pectins. Additionally, the glucose unit has a lot of hydroxyl groups (–OH), 
carboxyl acids (–COOH), or amines (–NH2) covalently anchored on its periphery, offering a flexible 
platform for functionalization and post modification (Li & Lin, 2021).
However, in recent decades, synthetic polysaccharides, made by chemical or biological means, 
have become increasingly popular in various industries, including food and pharmaceuticals, con￾struction, and energy. The biosynthesis polysaccharides can be produced by a myriad of glycosyltrans￾ferases (GTs). Synthetic polysaccharides are favored for their versatility, as they can be engineered to 
exhibit specific properties, such as high strength, viscosity, and stability, that make them useful in a 
range of applications. But chemical modifications can greatly hamper the structure-property relation￾ships by the heterogeneity and by the random distribution of functional groups. But structural arrange￾ments (e.g., monosaccharide components, positions of functional groups, modes of linkages) greatly 
confer the properties for particular applications. Polysaccharide isolation from natural resources often 
necessitates extensive purification and harsh treatments, resulting in polydispersity that is difficult to Synthetic Polysaccharides 49
analyze, reproduce, and control. However, synthesis of polysaccharides with multiple –OH groups in 
the laboratory is extremely difficult. However, the glycal assembly method is considered modern one 
for polysaccharide synthesis. This technique involves adding or removing additional sulfation, phos￾phorylation, acetylation, methylation, and other modifications to the glycans.
They are used as thickening agents, emulsifiers, and stabilizers in food, and as excipients in phar￾maceuticals to improve the effectiveness of drugs. In construction, they are used as adhesives, binders, 
and insulation materials, while in energy, they are used as biofuels, lubricants, and hydraulic fluids. Its 
nontoxic biodegradable properties define the commercial applications in pharmaceuticals, photographic 
films, food products, and tertiary oil recovery. It has some superior uses in the areas of biomedical fields. 
Polysaccharides are used in many biomedical applications like cell identification, expansion, adherence, 
immune system, swelling and bacterial identifications, and many more (Wu et al., 2017). Carbohydrate￾protein interactions (CPIs) and carbohydrate-carbohydrate interactions (CCIs) play a crucial role in regu￾lating various biochemical processes such as cell differentiation, adhesion, proliferation, and immune 
responses (Yu & Delbianco, 2020). Despite the benefits of synthetic polysaccharides, their widespread 
use has led to criticism, as some of these compounds have been shown to have negative impacts on the 
environment and human health. For example, synthetic polysaccharides are not biodegradable and can 
persist in the environment for long periods, contributing to pollution and degradation of ecosystems. 
Additionally, some synthetic polysaccharides have been linked to adverse health effects, such as diges￾tive problems, skin irritation, and allergic reactions. Given the adoration, depreciation, and ubiquity of 
synthetic polysaccharides, it is essential to understand their benefits, drawbacks, and overall significance 
in today’s world. However, complex polysaccharides are difficult to understand at the molecular level for 
better applicability, limiting the viable reach. This chapter will provide a comprehensive overview of syn￾thetic polysaccharides, exploring their properties, applications, and environmental and health impacts. 
The aim of this chapter is to provide an objective and balanced assessment of synthetic polysaccharides, 
highlighting the need for further research and regulation to ensure their safe and sustainable use.
3.2 SYNTHESIS AND EXPLORATION OF POLYSACCHARIDES
Saccharides units obtained in different natural carbohydrates from which isolation of saccharides is 
almost impracticable in many cases. Chemical synthesis of saccharides is now one of the interesting 
research parts by which different methods were developed recently. The regio- and stereoregulation in 
the polymeric chain is one of the most challenging parts of the synthesis of the synthetic polysaccharides 
unit which is very time-consuming. Different types of synthesis paradigm were used to make synthetic 
polysaccharide in various times. Currently, enzymatic synthesis, automated glycan assembly (AGA), one￾pot glycosylation strategy, polymerization processes, and other synthetic techniques are being explored to 
facilitate the rapid creation of synthetic polysaccharides. Tailored synthetic materials, featuring precise 
compositions and modifications, have the potential to advance glycoscience and find applications in mate￾rial science, biology, and nanotechnology. Their adaptability and diversity result in a variety of commer￾cially exploited features. Chemical alterations enable the expansion of their uses (de Moura et al., 2015).
3.2.1 Difficulties in Synthesizing Synthetic Polysaccharides
Preparing chemically synthesized monosaccharides can be time-consuming and frequently requires 
many stages to get the necessary long polysaccharide chain. Through the reaction of glycosylation, 
glycoside bonds are joined to form long-chain polymeric carbohydrates. Glycosylation processes are 
often challenging due to the severe conditions required, the low solubility of products and intermedi￾ates, and the formation of aggregates that can slow down the reactions (Delbianco et al., 2018). Stereo 
and regio-controlled chemistry in the long chain is another challenge in the synthesis. Significant 
effort has been expended to mechanistically comprehend the glycosylation reaction to predict its 
stereochemical consequence (Nigudkar & Demchenko, 2015). Since 1890, the Emil Fischer gly￾cosylation process has been extensively used to synthesize specific glycosides and has undergone 50 Polysaccharides
significant optimization and modification (Haese et al., 2022). The synthesis of polysaccharides 
requires careful selection of monomeric or oligomeric building blocks, regio- and stereo-selective 
techniques for the formation of glycosidic linkages, precise control of glycan size, and the removal 
of protective groups. During lengthy polymerizations, loss of stereospecificity can occur, which sig￾nificantly complicates the assembly process. But from the very beginning of 1981 to the date, many 
researchers applied many synthesis methods to create synthetic polysaccharides. Currently, several 
steps are being used to produce synthetic polysaccharides, mainly (i) AGA, (ii) enzymatic synthesis, 
(iii) chemical synthesis, and (iv) chemical polymerization, as shown in Figure 3.1.
3.2.2 Automated Glycan Assembly
Enzymes provide an advantage in glycosylation processes by allowing the use of exposed sug￾ars as substrates and providing precise govern over regio- and stereoselectivity, making them 
an invaluable tool in the process. The efficiency of coupling is a critical factor in determining 
the maximum length of biopolymers that can be synthesized without requiring purification 
steps. To address this, automated synthesis techniques have been developed to ensure high 
coupling efficiencies, reduce cycle durations, and expand the limit of appropriate long-chain 
polysaccharides. These developments are partly inspired by the routine production of 200-mers 
in polynucleotide syntheses (Ma et al., 2012). 128-mer of polysaccharides are synthesized to 
date through the glycosylation process from the very beginning of 1981, a list of comparisons 
of AGA synthesis is shown in Table 3.1 (Zhu et al., 2020). The entitled strategy of monosac￾charides through glycosylation which leads to polysaccharides has been taken by the AGA. 
Isolating a natural polysaccharide with an optimum length, content, and substitution is impos￾sible due to microheterogeneity. Functional investigations of polysaccharides, which play nec￾essary roles in various biological procedures such as bacterial infection, cell recognition, cell 
signaling, and viral entry, have often utilized heterogeneous and poorly defined polysaccha￾rides, thereby neglecting their precise structure.

method (Fittolani et al., 2021).Synthetic Polysaccharides 51
The linear 100-mer polymannoside was constructed using newly discovered linker and improved 
AGA procedures from variably protected monosaccharide building blocks. A branched 151-mer 
polymannoside was obtained through AGA-catalyzed convergent [31 + 30 + 30 + 30 + 30] block 
coupling of fully and partially protected polysaccharides (Joseph et al., 2020). In Figure 3.2, AGA 
assembly of polysaccharide concept is completely illustrated for the better understanding.

of Fmoc carbonate in preparation for subsequent glycosylation. Figure 3.3b shows the synthesis 
of a 100-mer α-(1–6)-polymannoside using AGA and Merrifield resin containing a photolabile 
linker. The automated synthesizer runs coupling cycles that include an acidic wash, glycosyl￾ation using the second mannose thioglycoside building block, capping to obstruct any unre￾acted nucleophiles, and cleavage of the temporary Fmoc protecting group. By photocleavage, 
the 100-mer α-(1–6)-polymannoside 3 is released from the solid support, and 100-mer α-(1–6)-
polymannoside 4 is created through a two-step global deprotection process. The AGA method 
was used to synthesize a 151-mer branched polymannoside through a block coupling strategy, 
as shown in Figure 3.3. In Figure 3.3a, the AGA of 30-mer glycosylating agents (7 and 8) is 
demonstrated using the AGA method. Merrifield resin 5 underwent 30 coupling cycles utilizing 
mannose thioglycoside building block 2, followed by photocleavage, yielding partially protected 
30-mer 6. By treating polymannoside 6 with trichloroacetonitrile or deoxo-fluor, the match￾ing 30-mer α-(1–6)-polymannoside donors 7 and 8 were generated. In Figure 3.3b, the block 
coupling strategy is shown. A branched 31-mer polymannoside acceptor 10, prepared using the 
AGA method, was coupled with the 30-mer α-(1–6)-polymannoside donors 7 and 8 using a 
31 + 30 + 30 + 30 + 30 block coupling. The resulting product was a branched 151-mer poly￾mannoside. In addition, Figure 3.3b shows the assembly of a 31-mer polymannoside acceptor 
10. Four mannose thioglycoside building blocks 2 were incorporated, followed by the addition 
of branching building block 9. The first two parallel couplings with building block 2 required 
FIGURE 3.3 Synthesis of branched 151-mer polymannoside (Joseph et al., 2020).Synthetic Polysaccharides 53
10 equivalents to glycosylate the secondary C2-hydroxyl group and establish an α-1,2 linkage. 
After three more parallel glycosylations with building block 2, the procedure was repeated with 
the addition of two more branching points using building block 8, allowing for rapid expan￾sion of the 31-mer polymannoside. After photocleavage and purification, 30 mg of the 31-mer 
polymannoside acceptor 10 was obtained. Figure 3.3c shows the successful combination of the 
30-mer glycosylating agent 8 and the branched 31-mer 10 to produce a fully protected 151-mer 
polymannoside 11 with a yield of 78%. After the removal of all protecting groups through meth￾anolysis and hydrogenolysis, a branched 151-mer polymannoside 12 was obtained with a yield 
of 1.8mg. An important development in the field was the automated synthesis of straight and 
branched polysaccharides up to 100-mers using monosaccharides, which opened the door for 
the synthesis of bigger polysaccharides like the 151-mer. By acting as both glycosylating agents 
and glycosyl acceptors, the fully and partially protected polysaccharides made by AGA allow 
the synthesis of carbohydrate materials that contain both natural and synthetic monomers. This 
technology has enormous potential in both biological and material science applications, similar 
to the applications of the automated polynucleotide and polypeptide synthesis.
3.2.3 Enzymatic Synthesis
Enzymes are advantageous in glycosylation reactions because they allow the use of exposed sug￾ars as substrates and provide excellent govern over regioselectivity and stereoselectivity. They can 
polymerize monosaccharides or oligosaccharides that have a reactive leaving group to produce the 
desired polysaccharide. There are numerous types of enzymes, including as hydrolases, sucrases, 
phosphorylases, glycosynthases, and glycosyltransferases (Cobucci-Ponzano & Moracci, 2012; 
Danby & Withers, 2016; Hayes & Pietruszka, 2017; Mackenzie et al., 1998). Even though this method 
had several benefits, the range of substrates was restricted by the low availability of the enzymes 
and their high selectivity. The synthesis of synthetic polymers is generally hindered by the highly 
selective enzyme reactive site, which only accepts minor alterations. Additional difficulties with the 
enzymatic production of polysaccharides include low glycosylation yields and product hydrolysis 
(Wang & Huang, 2009). Due to the enzymes’ inability to differentiate between acceptors of vari￾ous lengths in the reaction mixture, homopolymers are frequently produced using this method as 
non-uniform samples. Since the beginning, numerous enzymes and substrates have been created 
with the goal of controlling the molecular organization of the finished product, increasing DP, or 
narrowing the dispersion of molecular weight (MW) (Hattori et al., 2012; Hiraishi et al., 2009). 
Kobayashi reported the first successful enzymatic cellulose synthesis in 1991 (Kobayashi et al., 
1991). There are a lot of biocatalysts that have been shown to be able to selectively and quickly form 
glycosidic connections between saccharides without the time-consuming protection and deprotec￾tion procedures required in chemical synthesis (Smith et al., 2020). Enzymatic polymerizations may 
result in considerable amounts of distinct polysaccharides provided the necessary substrates and 
enzymes that are available in enough quantities. For polysaccharide synthesis in cell-free systems, 
three classes of enzymes can be used: (i) GTs, which transfer monosaccharides from activated sugar 
nucleotides to suitable acceptor substrates; (ii) glycoside hydrolases and glycosynthases, which are 
engineered glycoside hydrolases that use a glycoside hydrolysis’s reverse reaction; and (iii) phos￾phorylases and sucrases, which use sugar-1 (Figure 3.4).
The hydrolytic breakdown of glycosidic bonds is catalyzed by the carbohydrate-active enzymes 
known as glycoside hydrolases (GHs) (Lombard et al., 2014; Davies & Henrissat, 1995). Due 
to their ability to degrade polysaccharides including cellulose, hemicellulose, and starch, these 
enzymes are important for the efficient valorization of plant biomass (Bornscheuer et al., 2014). 
They may be manufactured in vast quantities using bacterial expression methods and are fre￾quently highly stable. Exo-glycosidases, which operate on terminal monosaccharides, are one type 
of GHs. Endoglycosidases, also known as endo-glycanases, hydrolyze internal glycosidic linkages 
(Ardèvol & Rovira, 2015). Additionally, they may be divided into two categories based on their 54 Polysaccharides
catalytic mechanism: retaining and inverting (Figure 3.5). By using a double-displacement method 
that entails forming an inverted covalent bond with the active site nucleophile, glycoside hydro￾lases can maintain the structure at the anomeric carbon. In contrast, inverting glycoside hydrolases 
employ a single displacement mechanism that involves a carbenium ion transition state and results 
in a net inversion of the anomeric center. Transglycosylation, a process in which GHs catalyzes the 
formation of a glycosidic link, is another capability. In retaining enzymes, the capacity to catalyze 
transglycosylation is more frequent.
When a reactive donor saccharide, such as a saccharide oxazoline or glycosyl fluoride, is present, 
significant amounts of glycosyl-enzyme precursors are produced that can preferentially react with 
the right acceptor substrates. Numerous other polysaccharides, such as glycosaminoglycans and 
derivatized celluloses, have been created in this fashion (Kadokawa, 2011). Nevertheless, the com￾peting hydrolytic activity of the enzymes imposes an inherent restriction on the chain lengths and 
yields of polysaccharides produced by this method. To eliminate background hydrolysis activity and 
increase yields, the Withers group developed modified glycoside hydrolases, now known as “gly￾cosylases,” in which the catalytic nucleophile has been swapped out for a nonnucleophilic residue 
(Hayes & Pietruszka, 2017). Glycosidic bonds are generated extremely effectively when activated 
donors are combined with glycosylases that (i) have the opposite configuration from the original 
substrate and (ii) have a sufficient leaving group at the anomeric carbon.

polysaccharides and the processes they catalyze (Smith et al., 2020).Synthetic Polysaccharides 55
3.2.4 Chemical Polymerization
The passage highlights the advantages of chemical polymerization in achieving a broad range 
of cellulose structures, specifically through ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of orthoesters. 
ROP has been proven effective in producing (1–4) glucopyranan structures, with the first stereo￾regular cellulose synthesized using 3,6-dibenzyl-protected 4 catalyzed by Ph3CBF4. This method 
also produced a protected polymer 14 with a productivity of 62% and a mean DP of 19.3 in just 
2 hours. Selective transformation requires the presence of benzyl (Bn) groups. Several cellulose 
analogs have been produced using this technique, including 6-deoxy, 13C-labeled, L-GLC, and 
ethyl/methyl variants. The water solubility of the polymer can be adjusted by changing the con￾centration of methyl/ethyl. However, there is no control over the replacement pattern. For instance, 
6-O-methyl and 6-O-ethyl celluloses were less water-soluble than heterogeneous polymers con￾taining more ethyl groups. Although different BB ratios can alter the methyl/ethyl proportion, 
the replacement pattern cannot be controlled. The removal of benzyl protective groups can be 
a bottleneck, requiring several treatments at high temperatures and pressures. To overcome this 
issue, allyl groups can be used as an alternative, which can be removed within 4 hours using pal￾ladium chloride at 60°C (Figure 3.6).

FIGURE 3.5 Pathways for (a) saccharide hydrolysis catalyzed by retaining glycosidases, (b) the formation 
of glycosidic bonds catalyzed by preserving glycosidase, and (c) the formation of glycosidic bonds catalyzed 
by glycosynthase (Smith et al., 2020).56 Polysaccharides
We were able to synthesize a 128-mer glycan using the best mix of assembly techniques, protecting 
group arrangement, and glycosylation reaction (Zhu et al., 2020).
3.2.5 Chemical Synthesis
Chemical synthesis offers a significant advantage over polymerization methods because it allows 
complete rule over the polymer length, preventing non-uniform MW dispersions. This method 
also enables the creation of polymers with virtually any alteration pattern. By selectively remov￾ing strategically placed protective groups (PGs), it is possible to introduce branches or chemical 
changes into the polymer. The intense aggregation and insolubility of cello oligosaccharides, 
which have until now limited this process to just extremely short structures in low yields, have 
severely hindered this technology. To solve this problem, the products were transformed into ace￾tate equivalents and studied similarly to how cellulose 20-mer made using a convergent process 
(Nishimura & Nakatsubo, 1996, 1997). Because of the creation of insoluble aggregates during 
the deprotection phase, which led to material waste during the purification process, the longest 
well-marked cellulose analog manufactured by chemical synthesis so far is a 12-mer (22, Figure 
3.7), which was achieved with a 2% yield (Yu et al., 2019). AGA produced 22 as one of a number 
of modified compounds that were produced with substantially greater yields. By breaking up 
hydrogen-bond networks, especially the formation of insoluble clumps was decreased by strategi￾cally placed substituents, such as methyl, fluorine, and carboxymethyl groups. When comparing 
compounds with the same degree of substitution but different substitution patterns, significant 
differences were observed in the conformation of the molecule, such as the gyration radius and 
conformation of glycosidic bond, as well as in the aggregation behavior, including crystallinity 
and solubility. These differences emphasize the necessity of producing pure and well-furnished 
FIGURE 3.6 Lewis acid (LA) or base-enhanced cellulose synthesis by ROP from protected orthoester 4 
(Fittolani et al., 2021).Synthetic Polysaccharides 57
polysaccharides to accurately characterize their structure and properties. When methyl groups 
were placed in blocks, for example, compounds with alternating methylation patterns created 
quasi-linear forms, whereas compounds with more curved geometries. As chemical synthesis 
provides for a high degree of exploitation flexibility, non-carbohydrate moieties can be utilized to 
modify the structure of the resulting molecules. Synthetic cellulose I was created by paralleling 
β-(1–4)-linked glucose chains with an anthraquinone molecule.

(CLASSIFICATION) OF SYNTHETIC POLYSACCHARIDES
FIGURE 3.7 AGA of many cellulose analogs produced using BBs 6–9. Higher isolated yields were achieved 
as a result of changes that were strategically placed to prevent the development of insoluble aggregates. The 
coupling (NIS/TfOH), capping (Ac2O), and Fmoc deprotection (piperidine or Et3N) steps of the AGA cycle 
are all included (Fittolani et al., 2021).58 Polysaccharides
3.3.1 Homo Synthetic Polysaccharides
Homo synthetic polysaccharides are those polysaccharides that are made of a repetition of a mono￾saccharide. For example – dextran, it is prepared by certain lactic acid bacteria from sucrose, the 
best-known Leuconostoc mesenteroides. It is a nontoxic polysaccharide and can form hydrogel cross￾linking at that time need to use reagents like diisocyanates and epicholorohydrin. Dextran has some 
special qualities for which they are commercially very interested solubility, viscosity, thermal, and 
rheological properties. In Figure 3.8, the general pathways for carbohydrates and the synthesis of 
dextran in four different types of lactic acid bacteria: Leuconostoc, Weissella, Lactobacillus, and 
Streptococcus.
3.3.2 Hetero Synthetic Polysaccharides
Hetero synthetic polysaccharides are those that contain two or more different monosaccharide units, 
some heteropolysaccharides participate together with amino acid chains. Chitosan is one kind of 
heteropolysaccharides which have glucosamine (deacetylated monomer) and N-acetylglucosamine 
(acetylated monomer) and also they are linked through β-1,4-glycosidic bonds (Figure 3.9). By 
enzymatic or chemical deacetylation, chitin is derivative into chitosan. Due to having good bio￾degradability and biocompatibility, it is easy to modify, and for this reason, it has extensive use in 
the biomedical (drug and vaccine) sector. Due to having antimicrobial quality, it is used in the food 
industry and tissue engineering.
3.3.2.1 Blockwise Assembly
Blockwise assembly refers to the process of synthesizing a polysaccharide by adding small, 
pre-synthesized building blocks, or blocks, together to form the final product. For examples of 
FIGURE 3.8 The general pathways of carbohydrates and the process of dextran synthesis in different lactic 
acid bacteria, including Leuconostoc, Weissella, Lactobacillus, and Streptococcus (Díaz-Montes, 2021).Synthetic Polysaccharides 59
the synthesis of oligo-β-(1–6)-glucosamines, blockwise assembly of oligosaccharide chains 
(Figure 3.10) is regarded to be a more dependable and scalable method.
3.3.2.2 Iterative Assembly
The process in which a growing polysaccharide chain is repeatedly modified until the desired 
structure is obtained. In iterative assembly (Figure 3.11), the polysaccharide chain is synthesized 
in a stepwise manner and the chemical structure is modified after each step, leading to the final 
desired product.
FIGURE 3.9 Chitosan, a linear polysaccharide.
FIGURE 3.10 Blockwise assembling of oligosaccharide.60 Polysaccharides
Iterative glycosylation allows two qualities in the chain -
• Stepwise elongation of polysaccharides
• Specific modifications of defined positions in the chain
3.3.3 According to Molecular Weight
3.3.3.1 Low Molecular Weight Synthetic Polysaccharide
Low molecular weight synthetic polysaccharide refers to a type of carbohydrate polymer com￾posed of repeating units of simple sugars, with a relatively low molecular weight compared to other 
polysaccharides. These polysaccharides have a molecular weight ranging from a few hundred to a 
few thousand daltons.
For example, class 1 Dextrans, a low molecular weight polysaccharide, molecular weight 
is≥1,000. Dextrans are synthesized by the action of leuconostoc mesenteric on sucrose, but it has a 
high molecular weight form too (Figure 3.12).
3.3.3.2 High Molecular Weight Synthetic Polysaccharide
High molecular weight synthetic polysaccharide refers to a type of carbohydrate polymer composed 
of repeating units of simple sugars, with a relatively high molecular weight compared to other 
polysaccharides. These polysaccharides have a molecular weight ranging from tens of thousands to 
millions of daltons. Examples of high molecular weight synthetic polysaccharides include chitosan, 
on average its molecular weight is 3,800–20,000 daltons.
• Chitosan (Figure 3.9)

3.3.4 Reactivity Toward Functional Groups
3.3.4.1 Acceptor Synthetic Polysaccharides
Acceptor synthetic polysaccharide is a type of synthetic carbohydrate molecule that can accept 
chemical groups in a reaction, and they are referred to as “acceptors” because they have reactive 
functional groups, such as hydroxyl groups, that can accept chemical groups through chemical reac￾tions such glycosylation (Figure 3.13).
3.3.4.2 Donor Synthetic Polysaccharides
Donor synthetic polysaccharides are a group of molecules that provides a sugar or other type of 
monomer unit that can be used in the formation of a glycosidic bond with another molecule (the 
“acceptor”). For example, glycosyl fluoride donor (Figure 3.14).
FIGURE 3.13 Glycosidases.
FIGURE 3.14 Activated glycosyl donors are oxazoline derivatives.62 Polysaccharides
3.3.5 According to Ionic Nature
3.3.5.1 Positively Charged Synthetic Polysaccharides
A positively charged polysaccharide refers to a polysaccharide molecule that has a posi￾tive charge because of the presence of more positive ions (e.g., cations) than negative ions 
(e.g., anions) in its chemical structure. This charge can influence the behavior and interactions 
of the polysaccharide with other molecules and can affect its solubility and stability in vari￾ous environments. For example, there is only an alkaline polysaccharide containing a positive 
charge and that is chitosan.
3.3.5.2 Negatively Charged Synthetic Polysaccharides
Polysaccharides can carry a negative charge due to the presence of negatively charged functional 
groups such as carboxyl or sulfate groups. These negatively charged polysaccharides are called 
anionic polysaccharides, and they play important roles in various biological processes, cosmetics, 
and vaccines. For example, heparin has the highest negative charge density of any known biomol￾ecule, and heparinoid is a chemically modified derivative of heparin (Figure 3.15).
3.4 FABRICATION TECHNIQUES OF SYNTHETIC POLYSACCHARIDES
Synthetic polysaccharide can fabricated in many ways for diversified uses. Some are mentioned 
below.
3.4.1 Solution Casting
The solution-casting method is based on the principle of Stokes’ law (Das et al., 2018a). Membranes 
are made using the casting method of solution casting. The solution system’s primary constituents 
are polymer and solvent although additional additives may also be used. When making the casting 
solution, the polymer we choose is quite important. In reality, the final membrane application is the 
only factor that determines whether the polymer is soluble in the chosen solvent at the proper con￾centration. Membranes with a porous structure typically result from low polymer concentrations, 
whereas membranes with a dense structure are produced by high polymer concentrations (Galiano, 
2020). Solution casting is a common method for fabricating synthetic polysaccharides. It involves 
dissolving the polysaccharide in a suitable solvent to form a homogeneous solution. The solution is 
then cast onto a substrate, such as a glass or plastic slide, and allowed to dry. The solvent evapo￾rates, leaving behind a thin film of polysaccharide material. One advantage of solution casting is 
that it can be easily scaled up to produce large amounts of polysaccharide films, making it a suit￾able method for large-scale production. Additionally, the solvent used for casting can influence 
the final morphology of the polysaccharide film, leading to improved properties such as increased 
FIGURE 3.15 Heparin.Synthetic Polysaccharides 63
mechanical strength or enhanced stability. This material is versatile and can be utilized for many 
different applications, including but not limited to wound healing, tissue engineering, and drug 
delivery. However, solution casting also has some limitations, such as the need to carefully select 
solvents that are compatible with the polysaccharide material and the substrate, and the potential 
for the formation of defects in the film due to uneven drying or solvent evaporation. Additionally, 
some polysaccharides may not be soluble in commonly used solvents, making solution casting not 
suitable for these materials.
3.4.2 Electrospinning
A method for creating ultra-fine fibers from a polymer solution, electrospinning has the advan￾tages of ease of use, cheap cost, a variety of raw material sources, and controlled process param￾eters (Rahimi et al., 2020). Lots of application need this method to prepare nanocomposites, 
nanofibers, etc. (Alam et al., 2023; Majumder et al., 2020). In electrospinning, a polymer solu￾tion is subjected to a high electric field, causing the solution to be drawn out into a fine fiber. The 
fiber is then collected onto a grounded collector. These fibers are referred to as nanofibers when 
they have diameters of less than 500 nm and are characterized by their large surface-to-mass 
ratio, high porosity, and mechanical performance; these properties have caught the interest of 
the scientific community (Mejía Agüero et al., 2022). The electric field and the solvent evapo￾ration rate determine the diameter of the fiber produced. Synthetic polysaccharides, such as 
alginate, chitosan, and gelatin, can be used in electrospinning to create nanofibers with tunable 
properties (Rahimi et al., 2020).
A laboratory-scale electrospinning setup typically comprises four main parts, as depicted 
in Figure 3.1: syringe pump, a high-voltage supply, syringe, ground collector, and syringe. The 
process starts with an electrified pendant droplet held together by surface tension, which morphs 
into a cone shape (known as the Taylor cone) due to repulsion from surface charges. The cone 
then produces an electrified jet that moves in a straight line until it experiences a whipping 
instability. During this instability, the jet is stretched and thinned into fibers that have nanoscale 
diameters. The fibers then dry once they reach the ground collector. Overall, this process is 
well-suited for various applications and produces fibers with small diameters (Mokhena et al., 
2000) (Figure 3.16).
Synthetic polysaccharides are attractive for electrospinning because they are biocompatible and 
biodegradable, making them compatible for biomedical applications such as wound healing and tis￾sue engineering. Additionally, their properties, such as mechanical strength and surface charge, can 
be tailored by adjusting the spinning conditions and post-processing treatments.
Despite its potential applications, electrospinning of synthetic polysaccharides still faces some 
challenges, including low processing yields, limited fiber uniformity, and poor fiber stability. Further 
research is needed to overcome these challenges and to optimize the electrospinning process for 
these materials.
3.4.3 Blending
The most promising methods for producing polymer materials are the binary mixtures of natu￾ral polysaccharides (cellulose-chitin, cellulose-chitosan), as well as their mixtures with synthetic 
polymers (Rogovina & Vikhoreva, 2006). The blending of synthetic polysaccharides is a process 
where two or more polysaccharides are combined to create a new material with improved proper￾ties compared to the individual polysaccharides. The blend can be done through various methods, 
including physical blending, chemical modification, or a combination of both. Blending polysac￾charides can offer several benefits, including improved mechanical strength, enhanced biocompat￾ibility, and altered drug release behavior. For example, chitosan and alginate have been blended to 64 Polysaccharides
produce materials with improved mechanical properties and improved wound healing performance. 
The blending of polysaccharides can also lead to synergistic effects, where the properties of the blend 
are greater than the sum of its parts. Yet, the blending of polysaccharides can also present challenges, 
such as compatibility issues between the polysaccharides and the formation of a phase-separated 
structure. It is important to carefully consider the processing conditions, such as the blending ratio, 
temperature, and the presence of a solvent, to ensure the formation of a homogeneous blend.
3.4.4 Layer-by-Layer Assembly
Using nanoscale polymer to change planar and spherical substrates, the layer-by-layer (LbL) assem￾bly approach is a potential way to create highly conformal coatings. It has been used in the develop￾ment of drug delivery systems, biosensors, enzyme immobilization, and cell adhesion (Tong et al., 
2012). The technique offers many benefits, such as simplicity, adaptability, cheap operating costs, 
accurate structure control, and a high capacity for guest loading (Manuscript, 2013). This process 
is used to build up thin films by alternating depositions of oppositely charged materials, typically 
polymers or nanoparticles. In the case of polysaccharides, the layers can be built up by the sequential 
adsorption of polysaccharides with opposite charges onto a substrate. This allows for the creation of 
thin films with controlled thickness, composition, and surface charge. For example, if a positively 
charged polysaccharide is first adsorbed onto a substrate, it can then be followed by the adsorption 
of a negatively charged polysaccharide. This process can be repeated multiple times to build up the 
desired thickness. By varying the type and amount of polysaccharides used in each layer, the prop￾erties of the resulting film can be tailored to meet specific requirements. LbL assembly of polysac￾charides has numerous potential applications, such as in the creation of protective coatings, and drug 
delivery systems, and in the design of biosensors and bioelectronics.

3.4.5 Sol-Gel Processing
The sol-gel processing method, first described by Ebelman in the middle of the 18th century, was pre￾viously used to fabricate decorative and constructional materials, but it has since undergone extensive 
development for uses in the production of ceramics, glasses, catalysts, fibers, coatings, and compos￾ites (O’Brien et al., n.d.; Wright and Sommerdijk, 2011). This process is also used to fabricate nano￾composites (Das et al., 2018a). The sol-gel process generally entails the change of a solution from a 
liquid (usually colloidal) phase to a solid phase. The sol-gel process begins with the preparation of 
the sol solution. This is usually done by mixing a precursor, such as a metal alkoxide or a metal salt, 
with a solvent. The precursor is chosen based on the desired final product, as different precursors 
will yield different materials. The sol solution is then subjected to a chemical reaction, typically an 
acid-catalyzed hydrolysis that causes the precursor to form a gel-like structure. During the gelation 
process, the solvent evaporates and the gel structure forms. The gel structure can be further modified 
by controlling the conditions of the gelation process, such as temperature and evaporation rate, to 
produce materials with different structures and properties. Once the gel has formed, it can be sub￾jected to further processing, such as drying and calcination, to obtain the final product. The drying 
process causes the solvent to continue to evaporate, causing the gel to shrink and become denser. 
Calcination, the heating of the material in a controlled environment, can be used to modify the struc￾ture of the material, improve its thermal stability, and remove any residual solvent.
This technique has many advantages over traditional fabrication methods, such as the ability to 
produce materials with high homogeneity, uniform pore sizes, and controlled porosity. It also allows 
for the incorporation of sensitive or reactive materials into the final product without damaging them, 
as the process is carried out at relatively low temperatures. The sol-gel fabrication of polysaccha￾rides offers a multitude of possibilities due to the adaptable nature and versatility of the materials 
produced. These polysaccharides can be utilized in various fields, including biomedicine as drug 
carriers and tissue engineering scaffolds, sensing technologies, energy production as catalysts, envi￾ronmental remediation, cosmetic products, biodegradable food packaging, and in membrane pro￾duction for high selectivity and permeability. The combination of uniform structure, high surface 
area, and biocompatibility makes these materials a desirable option for numerous applications.
3.4.6 Microfluidics
The technology of manipulating fluid in channels of tens of micrometers-wide diameters is known 
as microfluidics. Microfluidics is a field of science and technology that deals with the manipulation 
and processing of small volumes of fluids, ranging from 10−9 to 10−18L, through channels that have 
dimensions in the tens to hundreds of micrometers range (Whitesides, 2006). Microfluidic technol￾ogy is a rapidly advancing field that provides various tools to manipulate small volumes of fluids, 
ranging from 10−9 to 10−18L, and control chemical, biological, and physical processes essential for 
sensing. Lithographic techniques have facilitated the development of such tools, which can be inte￾grated with electronic and optical components to construct functional sensors (Stroock, 2008). The 
microfluidic process typically starts with the preparation of two immiscible liquids, one of which 
contains the precursors and reagents, and the other containing the solvent. The two liquids are then 
mixed in a microfluidic device, and the resulting droplets are subjected to the chemical reactions 
necessary to synthesize the polysaccharide. After the reaction is complete, the droplets can be further 
processed to obtain the final product. This may involve drying, calcination, or other post-synthesis 
treatments to modify the properties of the polysaccharide. The final product can then be collected and 
analyzed to determine its structure and properties. The main advantage of the microfluidic approach 
is the high level of control it provides over the reaction conditions, including temperature, reaction 
time, and reactant concentration. This control enables the precise synthesis of polysaccharides with 
well-defined structures and properties. Additionally, the small droplet size in microfluidic systems 
allows for high-throughput synthesis, as many droplets can be processed simultaneously.66 Polysaccharides
3.4.7 Photolithography
Typically, photolithography (PL) is used to create micro and nanostructures in a thin photoresist 
film by exposing it to light in a specific pattern (Nicaise et al., 2015). It entails applying a photoresist 
layer to a substrate and then subjecting it to UV light (Mustafa et al., 2020). The process has been 
explored using polysaccharides such as starch as the material to be patterned. Despite the environ￾mentally friendly and biodegradable nature of polysaccharides, their use in photolithography is still 
in its early stages due to challenges such as low solubility and low thermal stability. However, ongo￾ing research is aimed at developing new processing methods and materials to allow for the wider use 
of polysaccharides in photolithography as a sustainable alternative to traditional materials.
3.4.8 Microencapsulation
The microencapsulation process involves wrapping active substances in tiny capsules. This cutting￾edge technology has been utilized in several industries, including cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, agro￾chemicals, and food, for encapsulating a variety of substances such as flavors, acids, oils, vitamins, 
and microorganisms. The success of microencapsulation relies on the appropriate selection of the 
coating material, the form of the core material, and the encapsulation technique (Silva et al., 2014). 
Synthetic polysaccharides, such as alginate or chitosan, can be used as coatings to encapsulate vari￾ous substances, including drugs, flavors, and fragrances. The microencapsulation process involves 
droplet formation, coating, and drying, with properties such as size, stability, and release rate con￾trolled by adjusting the coating solution and process conditions. Microencapsulation offers a flexible 
and versatile approach to delivering substances with potential applications in various industries.
3.5 VERSATILE APPLICATION OF SYNTHETIC 
POLYSACCHARIDES IN DIFFERENT FIELDS
3.5.1 Uses in Vaccine
Responses to infectious illnesses, inflammatory agents, and carcinogens are only some of the many 
challenges faced by the body, and the immune system plays a crucial part in each. Pharmaceutical 
companies are putting more of an emphasis on finding novel immune-stimulating substitutes that 
are both safe and effective, and polysaccharides are one of the finest options in this regard. This 
is due to the rise in the prevalence of cancer and infectious diseases as well as the shortcom￾ings of several current medications, such as toxicity, resistance, and a lack of immune responses. 
Polysaccharides produced from traditional Chinese medicine have been shown to activate or con￾trol T cells and macrophages, increase interleukin activity, improve antibody levels, and control 
immunological function in the body (Yu et al., 2018). Polysaccharides were also shown to be a key 
modulator because they boost immunity via several pathways, including by activating macrophages, 
splenocytes, and thymocytes (Chen et al., 2019). Numerous efforts are being made to determine 
whether or not vaccines based on carbohydrates are viable options. Given the significance of poly￾saccharides in immunological cell–cell communication and tumor-associated carbohydrate antigen 
identification by the host immune system (Mohammed et al., 2020), usher in a new era in glycobiol￾ogy and the availability of vaccinations (Zhang & Wang, 2015). Many vaccine formulations have 
used polysaccharide-based antigens, such as tumor-associated carbohydrate antigens and bacterial 
capsular polysaccharides (Morelli et al., 2011). Polysaccharides vaccines, including those for pneu￾monia and meningitis, have been on the market since the 1980s (Jennings, 1990; Nair, 2012). Due to 
the lacking of immunological memory and flip of class from IgM to IgG, traditional polysaccharide 
antigens, which are mainly pure polysaccharides capsular, have limitations such as a brief duration 
and a limited immunogenic response in newborn children and young children. Researchers have 
begun combining polysaccharide vaccines like diphtheria, tetanus toxins, with protein carriers that Synthetic Polysaccharides 67
highly immunogenic, to overcome these drawbacks. These carriers interact with the immune system 
to increase the immunogenicity of the vaccine by eliciting a T cell-dependent response (Finn, 2004; 
Nikolaev & Sizova, 2011).
3.5.2 Applications in Biomedical Fields
Biomedical researchers have been using polysaccharides since the turn of the previous century 
(Muhamad et al., 2019). Numerous biomedical applications have investigated polysaccharides as a pos￾sible choice due to their many desirable characteristics, such as biocompatibility, non-immunogenicity, 
biodegradability, and increased stability and solubility (Boddohi & Kipper, 2010; Zhang & Wang, 
2015). Some of such applications are shown in Table 3.2. Furthermore, polysaccharides are substances 
of choice and are employed in many biomedical and biotechnological (Usman et al., 2017) applications 
due to their availability of sources and affordable cost. Algal polysaccharides, for instance, have seen 
considerable usage in a variety of biological contexts, including wound treatment, regenerative medi￾cine, and drug delivery regulation (De Jesus Raposo et al., 2015). This new family of biomaterials also 
has the advantage of being able to be made into hydrogels, like the hydrogels that have been success￾fully used to transport bone morphogenetic proteins and are loaded with heparin. It has been shown 
that polysaccharides can improve mechanical properties and make up for synthetic polymers’ poor 
biological performance (D’Ayala et al., 2008; Boddohi & Kipper, 2010; Gemini et al., 2016; Cascone 
et al., 2001).
3.5.3 Drugs, Vaccine Delivery, and Tissues Engineering
Polysaccharides are gaining popularity in the domains of tissue engineering (Li et al., 2004; 
Ngwuluka, 2018), cosmetics (Bragd et al., 2004), and wound healing (D’Ayala et al., 2008; 
Muhamad et al., 2019) due to their use as drug carriers, bioactive materials, building blocks 
for drug delivery, and excipients to improve drug delivery. Natural polysaccharides are adapt￾able, meaning they could be used for anything from medicine and vaccine delivery to cosmetics

and industrial purposes. Polysaccharides including gellan gum, xanthan gum, and scleroglucan, 
all of which are produced by microbes, have been the subject of substantial research for their 
potential use in drug administration (Alvarez-Lorenzo et al., 2013). By encapsulating the medi￾cation inside a nanoparticle carrier made of bioadhesive polysaccharides, drug uptake can be 
improved (Liu et al., 2008). Pectin, amylose, guar gum, inulin, chitosan, dextran, and chondroit￾sulfateate are some of the other naturally occurring polysaccharides that have been studied for 
their potential as pharmaceutical excipients for colon-specific drug release (Chourasia & Jain, 
2004). Chitin and chitosan are tissue-compatible polysaccharides that have been demonstrated 
to be effective in bone regeneration, tissue engineering, wound healing, and the transportation 
of medications and vaccinations (Chourasia & Jain, 2004; Vandamme et al., 2002). One of the 
most extensively utilized biopolymers for medication and vaccine administration is chitosan, 
which is depicted in Figure 3.9 (Luo & Wang, 2014). This is because a range of antigens can be 
encapsulated without harsh temperatures and organic solvents, preventing denaturalization and 
degradation (Arca et al., 2009) (Figure 3.17).
The potential of polysaccharide-based nanoparticles as nanometric carriers in the medication 
delivery system has recently seen an increase in research (Liu et al., 2008). Cationic polysaccha￾rides, used as gene transfection vectors, are a novel class of non-viral gene delivery systems (Azzam 
et al., 2002). These polycations are created through a reductive amination reaction between primary 
amines and periodate-oxidized polysaccharides. While cross-linked polysaccharide hydrogels are 
employed in significant applications like tissue engineering, medication delivery systems. It is antic￾ipated that the hyper-branched polymer would be a suitable carrier for gene delivery nanoparticles 
(Chen et al., 2019; Laurienzo, 2010).

3.5.4 Application in Antitumor and Immunomodulatory Activities
Tumors are a primary cause of death globally (Zong et al., 2012), and numerous plants (Guo et al., 
2019) and marine polysaccharides (De Jesus Raposo et al., 2015) have been shown to have antican￾cer properties. Several other types of natural polysaccharides, such as lentinan and schizophyllan 
(Chen  et  al., 2019), are potent antitumor agents. Antitumor activity and the ability to boost the 
efficacy of standard chemotherapeutic medicines are both hallmarks of polysaccharide-protein con￾jugates (Zong et al., 2012). This polysaccharide’s immunosuppressive action against tumor growth 
has been demonstrated by numerous studies in recent years (Wu et al., 2019). Despite their unique 
chemical structures and conjugated components, mushrooms have long been valued for their ability 
to provide a variety of health benefits whether consumed or applied topically. Natural polysaccha￾rides isolated from mushrooms have been the subject of substantial research due to their power￾ful anticancer and pharmacological activities (Ren et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2007). Mushroom 
polysaccharides include Ganoderma lucidum, which showed strong in vitro immune activation 
and anticancer action on breast cancer cells (Lee et al., 2002; Zhao et al., 2010), and Lentinus 
edodes, which had a striking antitumor impact against subcutaneously implanted sarcoma (Paulsen, 
2005). Mushroom polysaccharides have been shown to have anticancer effects (Pandya et al., 2019), 
and several mechanisms have been hypothesized for how they do so, including the inhibition of 
tumor growth, the stimulation of the immune system, and the induction of apoptosis in tumor cells. 
Mushroom polysaccharides are utilized in clinical trials to boost the efficacy of chemotherapeu￾tic drugs while reducing their negative effects (Schepetkin & Quinn, 2006). The polysaccharides 
found in algae are also very significant due to their wide range of pharmacological properties, 
which include anticancer activity (Costa et al., 2010). Polysaccharides induce cytokine expression 
in effector cells like T lymphocytes, macrophages, B lymphocytes, natural killer cells, and cyto￾toxic T lymphocytes; these cytokines always exhibit antiproliferative activity, trigger apoptosis 
and differentiation in tumor cells shown in Figure 3.2, and secrete products like reactive oxygen 
intermediates, nitrogen, and interleukins (Meng et al., 2016; Seidi et al., 2018). Saccharide-coated 
nanoparticles have a longer half-life in the body’s circulatory system. Furthermore, they are seen in 
high concentrations within tumors (Seidi et al., 2018) (Figure 3.18).
FIGURE 3.17 Chitosan-based drug delivery (Mohammed et al., 2021).70 Polysaccharides
FIGURE 3.18 Probable immune system mechanism. The production of cytokines such IL-2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 
12 as well as TNF, IFN, and IL-1 by T cells was boosted by fungal polysaccharides. The NK cells’ produc￾tion of IL-1, 2, 3, 12, TNF-, and IFN- was boosted by cytokines B found in mushroom polysaccharides. The 
release of IL-6 and 8, IL-1, TNF, and IFN- from macrophages may be enhanced by cytokines C from fungal 
polysaccharides. LPS was employed as a general B cell, macrophage, and DC activator, while ConA was used 
as a specialized T cell activator (Meng et al., 2016; Mohammed et al., 2021).Synthetic Polysaccharides 71
3.5.5 Antioxidative Applications
Many diseases, including diabetes mellitus, cancer, neurodegenerative, serious tissue injuries, and 
inflammatory diseases, may be caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS) because they assault vari￾ous macromolecules such as membrane lipids, DNA, and proteins. Since antioxidants can inhibit 
or lessen the harmful effects of these substances (Kardošová & Machová, 2006; Wijesekara et al., 
2011) and boost health (Rocha De Souza et al., 2007), they are extremely helpful in this context. 
Because of the many negative effects that synthetic antioxidants, such as carcinogenesis and liver 
damage, have, a natural alternative would be quite useful. Plant-based polysaccharides have been 
shown to have potent antioxidant properties (Tseng et al., 2008), which may help shield the human 
body from the damaging effects of free radicals and reduce the severity of many diseases (Yuan 
et al., 2008). Since plant polysaccharides play such an important role in biology, scientists have spent 
a lot of time delving into their chemical properties to learn more about their potential uses in medi￾cine, such as anticancer, immune-stimulating, and antioxidant actions (Jin, 2012). Polysaccharides, 
for example, have been shown to protect against and even reverse the damage to the heart and brain 
caused by free radicals (Chen et al., 2019); therefore, their presence as natural antioxidants that may 
scavenge these ROS is very helpful. Hyriopsis cumingii is just one example of a naturally occurring 
polysaccharide that has been studied for its antioxidative effects (Qiao et al., 2009). Polysaccharides 
isolated from the Chinese herb astragalus also exhibited strong antioxidant and anticancer action 
(Li et al., 2010). Anticoagulant/antithrombotic, antilipidemic, antiviral, and antioxidant actions are 
just some of the properties of the sulfated polysaccharides found in seaweed and red alga (Arad & 
Levy-Ontman, 2010; Jiao et al., 2011). For their antioxidant properties, sulfated polysaccharides 
found in seaweed, galactomannan, arabinogalactan, and pectic polysaccharides found in plants, and 
glucans and glycoproteins found in mushrooms have all been used (Yu et al., 2018).
Polysaccharides may have an anti-inflammatory effect through one of these mechanisms. For 
instance, TCM polysaccharides have anti-inflammatory activity primarily because they inhibit the 
expression of chemotactic factors and adherence factors as well as the activities of key enzymes involved 
in the inflammation process (Chen et al., 2016). Other polysaccharides inhibit inflammatory-related 
mediators like cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α) and NO (nitric oxide), and decreased the infiltration of 
inflammatory cells (Chen et al., 2016). Sulfated polysaccharides derived from algae show their anti￾inflammatory effect by inhibiting the migration of leukocytes to sites of inflammation (Jiao et al., 2011).
3.5.6 Other Applications
3.5.6.1 Anti-inflammatory Activity
The anti-inflammatory effects of natural polysaccharides were proven experimentally (Muhamad et al., 
2019) and led to their widespread usage in nanotechnology for the management of inflammatory dis￾orders. One of these mechanisms may be responsible for polysaccharides’ anti-inflammatory effect; 
for example, polysaccharides used in traditional Chinese medicine have anti-inflammatory properties 
primarily due to their capacity to inhibit the production of chemotactic and adhesion factors as well 
as the actions of important enzymes involved in the inflammation process (Chen et al., 2016). Algal
sulfated polysaccharides inhibit leukocyte migration to inflammatory areas, which is how they exert 
their anti-inflammatory effects (Jiao et al., 2011; Ullah et al., 2019). Sulfated polysaccharides from 
algae demonstrate their anti-inflammatory impact differently than other polysaccharides, which have 
an inhibitory effect on inflammatory-related mediators including cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α).
3.5.6.2 Hypoglycemic and Hypocholesterolemic Activities
Since the 1980s of the last century (Chen et al., 2019; Nie et al., 2018), several clinical investigations 
have been undertaken on polysaccharides for their hypoglycemic and hypocholesterolemic impact. 
Protecting against kidney impairment in people with type 2 diabetes, Ganoderma atrium polysaccharide 
also has the potential to cure hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, and hyperinsulinemia. 72 Polysaccharides
Orally given insulinloaded dextran-chitosan nanoparticulate polyelectrolyte complex, for instance, has 
a greater bioavailability and a longer-lasting hypoglycemic impact (Ngwuluka, 2018). Proteins placed 
onto natural polysaccharides operate more steadily and have a longer therapeutic effect than proteins 
alone. Chitosan and kefran are two polysaccharides that have hypoglycemic and hypocholesterolemic 
properties (Nayak et al., 2019; Moradi & Kalanpour, 2019), as well as the sulfated polysaccharides that 
are extracted from Bullacta exarate (Yu et al., 2018). By modification of PPAR-mediated lipid metabo￾lism, a dose-dependent hypoglycemic impact and improved insulin sensitivity can be achieved (Wu et 
al., 2019) were seen in mice administered a traditional Chinese medication comprising polysaccharides 
derived from Tremella fuciformis mushrooms.
3.5.6.3 Anticoagulant Activity
Anticoagulant activity is one of several polysaccharide qualities that has been examined in depth; 
sulfated polysaccharides like unfractionated and low molecular weight heparins are utilized as anti￾coagulant medications but have undesirable side effects such bleeding and thrombocytopenia (Costa 
et al., 2010). Antitumor, antioxidant, and anticoagulant actions are only some of the many biological 
effects of polysaccharides that have been demonstrated (Yu et al., 2018). These sulfated polysaccharides 
have anticoagulant action due in large part to their high sulfate concentration (De Jesus Raposo et al., 
2013). Possible anticoagulant agents include plant-derived polysaccharides like pectin (Olennikov et al., 
2015) and those acquired from marine sources like shellfish (shrimp, crab, squid, lobster, crayfish, etc.), 
marine macro-algae (seaweeds), marine fungus, microalgae, and corals (Mohan et al., 2019).
3.5.6.4 Antiviral Activity
It has been demonstrated that sulfated polysaccharides found from seaweeds have a suppressive 
effect on the replication of enveloped viruses such as the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), 
herpes simplex virus (HSV), human cytomegalovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and dengue virus 
(Jiao et al., 2011). This has been known since the 1950s when the polysaccharides’s antiviral activity 
was first demonstrated. Sulfated exopolysaccharides (EPS) are produced by a variety of microal￾gal species and have a significant biological role as antiviral agents (De Jesus Raposo et al., 2013). 
Traditional Chinese medicine polysaccharides have been utilized for decades as antiviral drugs due 
to their proven ability to boost immunity by stimulating macrophages to increase their phagocytic 
capacity and secrete IL-2, IFN-, and antibodies (Chen et al., 2016). 
3.6 SYNTHETIC POLYSACCHARIDES: FUTURE PROSPECTIVE, 
LIMITATION, AND CHALLENGES
3.6.1 Adored Synthetic Polysaccharides
Synthetic polysaccharides, also known as synthetic sugars, are a highly versatile class of materi￾als that have garnered significant attention and adoration due to their various applications in the 
biomedical field. One of the most notable applications of synthetic polysaccharides is as hydrogels, 
which are highly absorbent materials that are widely used in wound dressings and drug delivery 
systems. Another important application is as mucoadhesive polymers, which have the ability to 
adhere to mucosal surfaces and have proven to be effective in oral drug delivery. Additionally, 
synthetic polysaccharides have been developed as biodegradable polymers, providing a more envi￾ronmentally friendly alternative to traditional petroleum-based polymers. Furthermore, synthetic 
polysaccharides have also shown promise as materials for wound healing, with studies indicating 
that they can promote tissue regeneration and improve healing outcomes. The adoration for syn￾thetic polysaccharides is driven by their versatility and potential for application in a range of bio￾medical fields, including drug delivery, wound healing, and regenerative medicine. These materials 
hold great potential for improving human health and well-being, making them a highly valued and 
adored component of the biomedical landscape.Synthetic Polysaccharides 73
3.6.2 Deplored Synthetic Polysaccharides
Synthetic polysaccharides are being widely used in food additives, cosmetics, packaging and bio￾medical applications. However, despite their widespread use, there are growing concerns about the 
impact of synthetic polysaccharides on both the environment and human health. One major concern 
is the contribution of synthetic polysaccharides to the microplastics crisis, which is causing significant 
harm to wildlife and marine life, as well as the potential for these particles to enter the food chain. 
Additionally, synthetic polysaccharides have been linked to toxicity and biocompatibility issues, with 
studies indicating that they may cause skin irritation and immune system suppression. The non-bio￾degradable nature of synthetic polysaccharides also means that they persist in the environment for 
extended periods, leading to increased pollution and environmental harm. Despite these concerns, 
there is currently limited regulation and standardization in the production and use of synthetic poly￾saccharides, making it difficult for consumers to make informed decisions about the products they use.
3.6.3 Ubiquitous Synthetic Polysaccharides
Synthetic polysaccharides are employed as thickeners, emulsifiers, and stabilizers in the food indus￾try to raise the caliber of food items. They are valued for their ability to enhance the texture, 
appearance, and stability of food, making them an attractive ingredient for food manufacturers. 
In pharmaceuticals, synthetic polysaccharides are used as excipients, substances added to drugs 
to improve their effectiveness. They play a critical role in controlling the release of drugs, improv￾ing their solubility, and reducing their toxicity. In cosmetics, synthetic polysaccharides are used 
as moisturizers, emollients, and film-formers, providing a smooth, moisturized feel to the skin. 
They are also used as thickening agents and stabilizers to improve the consistency and shelf life of 
cosmetic products. In the textile industry, synthetic polysaccharides are used as fibers and yarns, 
providing strength, durability, and comfort to clothing and other textiles. They are also used as siz￾ing agents to improve the stiffness, handling, and finish of textiles.
3.7 CONCLUSIONS
In conclusion, synthetic polysaccharides, or synthetic sugars, are a versatile class of materi￾als with a wide variety of applications in various industries, including biomedical and cos￾metic industries. These materials are adored for their versatility and potential to improve human 
health and well-being, as well as their ability to function as hydrogels, mucoadhesive polymers, 
and biodegradable polymers. However, there are also concerns about the negative impact of 
synthetic polysaccharides on the environment and human health, particularly with regard to 
microplastics and toxicity. This lack of regulation and standardization has led to calls for greater 
government oversight and action to ensure that synthetic polysaccharides are used in a safe and 
responsible manner. The use of synthetic polysaccharides in these industries highlights their 
versatility and ability to exhibit specific properties that make them useful in a range of applica￾tions. However, it is important to note that the widespread use of these compounds has led to 
criticism, as some have been shown to have negative impacts on the environment and human 
health. This highlights the need for further research and regulation to ensure their safe and sus￾tainable use in these industries.
Looking toward the future, there is great potential for synthetic polysaccharides to continue 
to play a significant role in the biomedical field, with ongoing research aimed at developing new 
applications and improving their safety and biocompatibility. At the same time, it is crucial to 
consider ethical considerations and ensure that these materials are produced and used in a safe 
and responsible manner. This may involve greater government oversight and regulation, as well 
as increased efforts to promote sustainability and reduce the environmental impact of synthetic 
polysaccharides.74 Polysaccharides
In conclusion, synthetic polysaccharides are a versatile and valuable class of materials with both 
positive and negative aspects. It is essential to balance the potential benefits of these materials with 
the need to protect the environment and human health. Ultimately, the use of synthetic polysac￾charides must be guided by ethical considerations and a commitment to responsible and sustainable 
practices. As a society, we must work together to ensure that these materials are used in a way that 
benefits both people and the planet.

4.1 INTRODUCTION
Nanotechnology has recently accomplished wide interest due to its numerous applications in a vari￾ety of fields, like biomedical science and biotechnology [1]. The use of nanomaterials in pharma￾ceutical and biomedical research is currently gaining wider attention. NPs having diameter <100nm 
have the ability to improve the patient compliance, site-specific drug delivery, and several advan￾tages in biomedical and pharmaceutical industry including solubility of poorly water-soluble drugs 
[2]. Recently, nanotechnology is becoming more specialized in synthesizing nanoparticles having a 
wide range of physicochemical properties including surface charge, particle size, etc. [3].
As effective drugs delivered by nanoparticles have remarkable release/degradation mechanisms, 
the use of biopolymers like starch, cellulose, silk, gelatin, albumin, and chitosan (Ch) – in synthesiz￾ing nanoparticles offers several advantages as it is biocompatible, biodegradable, and least toxic as 
compared to synthetic NPs. Therefore, polysaccharide is coming to the notice to many researchers 
not only for their excellent physical and biological qualities but due to their different reactive group 
which is subjected to chemical modification [4, 5]. In advance, the fabrication of polysaccharide￾based nanoparticles is particularly appropriate for preparing nanoparticles composed of polymeric 
backbone. Polysaccharide is composed of monosaccharide which is linked by O-glycosidic bonds 
to form polysaccharides. Polysaccharide obtained from different sources like algae (alginic acid 
and carrageenan), plants (cellulose, pectin, and guar gum), and animals like chitosan, hyaluronic, 
and chondroitin. Much research has been done up to this point on the fabrication and engineering of 
polysaccharide-based nanoparticles for medication, protein/peptide, and nucleic acid delivery sys￾tem in biomedical applications [5]. They exhibit a wide variety of physical and chemical properties 
and exhibit a wide range of applications depending on the chemical structure [5, 6]. From the chem￾istry of polymer to material research to advance biomedical fields of application, polysaccharide 
nanoparticles (PSNPs) are extensively explored in numerous branches of fundamental and applied 
science. The principal behind PS is supramolecular self-assembly of polysaccharide that makes it 
possible to utilize it for the fabrication of inventive bio-nanomaterial. Polysaccharides are nontoxic, 
biocompatible, and often have beneficial bioactive properties.
4.2 NANOPARTICLES
Nanoparticles are entities, size ranging from 1 to 1,000nm. Nanoparticles are considered as a link 
between macroscopic and microscopic structures. They exhibit the properties of both bulk materials 
and microscopic structures due to their unique size. The small particle size gives them the unique 
intrinsic property of a high surface-to-volume ratio. When in a free state, nanoparticles are highly 82 Polysaccharides
mobile which causes a drastic decline in sedimentation rate. Nanoparticles are in a highly movable 
state when they are free, which leads to an extremely slow rate of sedimentation. Depending upon 
their use, they exhibit a wide range of configurations ranging from soft to hard materials depending 
and may possess quantum effects. The presence of quantum effects causes ultimate control over 
the surface energy of these particles that will result in control of initial protein adsorption to allow 
cellular interaction. Nanoparticles are differentiated from microparticles, fine particles, and coarse 
particles due to their small size that exhibits different physical and chemical properties encompass￾ing other properties like colloidal, ultra-optical effect, and electrostatic properties [7]. Owing to 
Brownian motion, they do not sediment unlike colloidal particles. The properties of nanoparticles 
differ remarkably from those particles of significantly larger particle size of the same substance as 
the diameter of an atom commonly lies between 0.15 and 0.6nm, a large portion of the nanopar￾ticle’s material lies within a few atomic diameters from its surface. Therefore, the properties of the 
surface layer seem to be prominent over those of the bulk material. Therefore, when a nanopar￾ticle is dispersed in a medium possessing different composition, this effect becomes stronger, since 
there is a significant interaction between the surface of two materials. Polarized optical microscopy 
(POM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), infrared 
atomic force microscopy (AFM), Raman spectroscopy, and zeta size analyzer are used for charac￾terization and analysis of the morphology of nanoparticles.
4.2.1 Types of Nanoparticles
NPs are categorized on the basis of their morphology, size, physical, and chemical properties. Some 
of the common classes of NPs categorized on the basis of their physical and chemical characteristics 
are given below [8].
4.2.1.1 Carbon-based NPs
Fullerenes and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) form the two main classes of carbon-based NPs. Fullerenes 
contain nanomaterials that are composed of spherical hollow cage-like allotropic forms of carbon. 
Owing to their electrical conductivity, high strength, structure, electron affinity, and versatility, 
they have gained remarkable commercial interest. These materials possess arranged pentagonal 
and hexagonal carbon units in an arranged manner, each carbon being sp2 hybridized. CNTs, on 
the other hand, are elongated, tubular structures, ranging 1–3nm in diameter. These nanomaterials 
are metallic or semiconducting depending upon their diameter. Structurally, these nanomaterials 
resemble a sheet of graphite getting rolled upon itself. The rolled sheets are usually mono, double, 
or multi-walled and therefore they are named single-walled (SWNTs), double-walled (DWNTs), 
or multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCTs), respectively. They are prepared via two methods. 
One of the widely used methods involves the deposition of carbon precursors, i.e., atomic carbons 
that had been vaporized from graphite via laser or electric arc onto the metal particles. The other 
method used for synthesizing CNTs is chemical vapor deposition (CVD). CNTs are unique since 
they are thermally conductive throughout the length and show zero conductivity across the tube. 
Owing to their unique physicochemical and mechanical properties, these materials are employed in 
the form of pristine and also as nanocomposites for several commercial applications encompassing 
fillers, efficient gas adsorbents as remedies regarding environment-related issues, and as supporting 
medium for several inorganic and organic catalysts.
4.2.1.2 Metal Nanoparticles
Metal NPs are purely synthesized by precursors made up of metal. These nanoparticles are made 
by employing chemical, electrochemical, and photochemical methods. In chemical methods, 
chemical reducing agents are used to reduce the metal ion precursor present in the solution to get 
metal nanoparticles. Owing to their innovative optical properties, metal NPs find applications in 
many research areas, including imaging and detection of biomolecules, and environmental and Design and Structure of Polysaccharide-Based Nanoparticles 83
bioanalytical applications. A sampling of SEM is done widely by using gold NPs to enhance the 
electronic stream and obtain SEM images of high quality.
4.2.1.3 Ceramic Nanoparticles
Ceramics NPs are inorganic nonmetallic solids, prepared by heat and continuous cooling, composed 
mainly of oxides, carbides, carbonates, and phosphates. They are mainly found in amorphous, dense, 
porous, polycrystalline, and hollow forms. These nanoparticles are chemically inert and highly resis￾tant to heat. Therefore, these NPs are gaining interest from researchers owing to their wide usage in 
applications like catalysis, photocatalysis, photodegradation of dyes, imaging, etc.
4.2.1.4 Semiconductor Nanoparticles
Semiconductors are the materials that exhibit properties between metals and nonmetals due to 
which they find several applications. Due to the presence of wide band gaps, they show different 
properties on tuning. They find crucial applications in photocatalysis, photo optics, and electronic 
devices. For instance, the presence of significant band gaps and edge positions have demonstrated 
semiconductor NPs to be effective in water-splitting applications too [9].
4.2.1.5 Polymeric Nanoparticles
These are organic-based nanoparticles, collectively called polymer nanoparticles (PNP). They can 
be nanospherical or nanocapsules, based on the method of preparation. In the former, the matrix and 
the polymer are evenly dispersed, and they have a matrix-like structure [10]. In the latter case, the 
solid mass is surrounded by a polymeric shell and they possess core-shell morphology.
4.2.1.6 Lipid Based Nanoparticles
These NPs contain lipid moieties and are spherical in structure having diameter (10–100nm). Lipid 
NPs are composed of a solid core and an external core which is stabilized by surfactants and emul￾sifiers. In the biomedical field, these nanoparticles have found applications in drug delivery and 
release of RNA for treating cancer [11].
4.3 POLYSACCHARIDE-BASED NANOPARTICLES
All living organisms have been subjected to polysaccharide-based nanoparticles. Also, they do not 
exhibit any toxic effects since they are biocompatible, biodegradable, and safe for various therapies. 
These nanoparticles are commonly synthesized by simple methods requiring mild temperature and 
pressure conditions as in ionotropic gelation and self-assembly of polyelectrolytes. They possess sev￾eral advantages as they are safe, stable, and non-explosive and have natural availability compared 
to metal nanoparticles. They exhibit high stability, safety, non-explosive, and naturally accessible 
to the comparison of metal nanoparticles. Also, they are more stable as compared to peptide-based 
nanoparticles, as peptides are subjected to deformation and possess less risk of immunogenicity [12]. 
Polysaccharides-based nanoparticles are synthesized by self-assembly of nanoparticles as well as physi￾cal and chemical cross-linking. They find numerous applications in the therapeutic diagnosis of vari￾ous diseases by employing imaging and therapeutic agents. Nanoparticles can be made from natural 
polymers by employing different polysaccharides such as alginic acid, dextran, chitosan, cyclodex￾trin, hyaluronic acid, and pullulan. These polymers are derived from different sources of plant origin 
(e.g., starch, guar gum), algal origin, microbial origin (e.g., dextran, gellant), and animal origin (chito￾san, hyaluronic acid) [12]. These polymers exhibit some advantages over synthetic polymers as these 
are economical and find multiple applications in industries. Polysaccharide possesses many chemically 
reacting moieties in their structure that can be simply functionalized chemically and biochemically. 
Polysaccharide exhibits the presence of different hydrophilic groups such as hydroxyl, carboxyl, and 
amino groups in their structure that helps in enhancing bioadhesion with epithelia and mucous mem￾branes by forming non-covalent bond and hence enhancing the bioavailability of many drugs [12].84 Polysaccharides
Different types of polysaccharides that had been used to successfully synthesize nanoparticles 
according to the report are as follows:
Chitosan nanoparticles (CS-NPs)
Chitosan is the most commonly used polysaccharide for preparing nanoparticles since it is bio￾compatible and when given at a higher dose possesses no toxicity. It is gaining much wider attention 
from researchers since it has the ability to elongate the duration of drug residence at the absorption 
site and hence improve its bioavailability [1]. Rizvi et al. prepared chitosan nanoparticles loaded 
with carboplatin for treating breast cancer, showing improved anti-proliferative activity as com￾pared to the native carboplatin. Li et al. synthesized doxorubicin-loaded CS-LDL (chitosan-low 
density lipoprotein) by self-assembly and evaluated it showing higher cell toxicity on gastric cancer 
SGC7901 cells.
Alginate nanoparticles (ALG-NPs)
Alginate is a linear polysaccharide that is polyanionic in nature, acquired from marine brown 
algae. Chemically, it is 1,4-linkage acid and β-d-mannuronic acid. Due to its mucoadhesive, bio￾compatibility, and biodegradability, it has several potential applications in the pharmaceutical and 
biomedical filed as drug delivery systems. Costha et al. developed a pH-sensitive sodium ALG 
iron oxide nanoparticle composite coated with bilayer hydroxyapatite by employing co-precipitation 
method. It was developed for loading of curcumin and 6-gingerol for targeted and controlled release 
of the same that showed improved drug release profile in a sustained and pH-controlled manner. 
Laraba-Djebari’s group developed ALG nanoparticles loaded with scorpion venom toxin by ion 
gelation method for oral delivery of the vaccine. It was developed to provide protection to the venom 
against degradation caused by the biological environment and to improve its delivering efficiency 
to the APC (73).
Hyaluronic acid nanoparticles (HA-NPs)
Hyaluronic acid (HA), referred to as hyaluronan, forms the major part of the extracellular matrix, 
and it is found in abundant quantities in several organs, including connective, epithelial, and neural 
tissues. It is a linear polysaccharide that possesses chemical stability and the ability to imbibe water 
into it along with biocompatibility and biodegradability. Carboxylic acid present in the structure 
of HA enables efficient conjugation with other drugs and targeting ligands. Owing to the amazing 
properties possessed by HA, it finds potential application in pharmaceutical and medical science 
fields. Jeon et al. prepared a nano-sized drug delivery system for treating cancer. Amphililic hyal￾uronic acid conjugates were prepared by chemically conjugating hydrophobic 5β-cholanic acid to 
the backbone of HA. This amphiphilic HA conjugate enabled the formation of a stable nanoparticle 
by self-assembly in an aqueous media [1].
Dextran nanoparticles
Dextran is an unbranched polysaccharide, soluble in water, and widely utilized in medical prod￾ucts because of its significant and remarkable biocompatibility, biodegradability, non-antigenicity, 
and immunogenicity properties. Dextranspermine is an unbranched water-soluble polysaccharide 
and is extensively utilized in medical products because of its excellent biocompatibility, biode￾gradability, non-antigenicity, and immunogenicity properties. Dextranspermine conjugate-based 
nanoparticles were also prepared by researchers for delivering genes to leukemic cells and magnetic 
dextran spermine nanoparticles for targeting drug delivery to the brain [1].

4.5 STRUCTURE AND DESIGN OF POLYSACCHARIDE-BASED NANOPARTICLES
4.5.1 Chitosan
Chitosan polysaccharide is cationic and found in nature. It is made up of N-acetyl-2-deoxy-d￾glucopyranose and 2-amino-2-deoxy-d-glucopyranose linked by (1,4)-β-glycosidic bonds [4, 16]. 
Chitosan is formed by the removal of alkyl group from chitin, and different molecular weights of 
chitosan can be made with varying degrees of deacetylation while it shows various physicochemical 
and biological characteristics on the basis of chitosan synthesis [17]. Various chitosan modifications 
have been done to enhance the target specificity and bioavailability. As drug delivery vectors, a 
range of chitosan derivatives have been developed, including sugar-bearing, carboxyalkyl, and qua￾ternized chitosan has been invented as a drug delivery vector [18] (Figure 4.1).

4.5.2 Functionalization of Chitosan
Chitosan has functional groups that are strategically placed to provide polysaccharide with unique 
qualities and attributes due to the existence of an amino group at the C-2 position of the glucosamine. 
Then amino group represents its cationic nature having wound healing, antibacterial action, and its 
mucoadhesive, making it an excellent carrier for drug delivery. Chitosan has pKa 6.5, and it is soluble 
in acidic solution and insoluble water solution. The chitosan is protonated and polycationic in nature 
and forms various anions such as lipids, proteins, DNA, alginate, and pectin. The physicochemical 
properties, such as toxicity and solubility, depend on the degree of dealkylation. The functionaliza￾tion of the hydroxyl group and the amino group as N-modified, O-modified, and N,O-modified chito￾san resulting enhance biological activity. The antimicrobial activity, solubility, and its mucoadhesive 
properties can be increased by quaternized, N-alkyl-/N-benzylchitosan and phosphorylated chitosan. 
By using electrophilic reactants like alkyl halide, acids and isocyanides, nonselective N, O-modified 
chitosan derivatives, and selective O-modified chitosan derivative are synthesized, wherein the acid 
protonated amino group which leaves, the –OH group to undergo the reaction, and by securing a 
hydroxyl functional group, N-modified derivatives are obtained [19] (Figure 4.2).
4.5.3 Synthesis of Chitosan Nanoparticles
Chitosan nanoparticles are reported to be synthesized by the following two methods:
1. Deprotonation of amino group
2. Ionic crosslink method
Sodium tripolyphosphate (TPP) is used as a crosslinking agent to enhance intermolecular bond￾ing between negative phosphate in TPP structure and positive charges of chitosan amino group. 
Chitosan powder incorporated in 1% acetic acid solution was allowed for magnetic stirring for 
24 hours [20]. For amino deprotonation, chitosan was used in concentrations 0.9 g/100 g and 1.5 
g/100 g having pH 3.5–6.7 with 6M NaOH. In the ionic crosslinking method, triphosphate (TPP) 
FIGURE 4.2 Structures of some functionalized chitosan derivatives [19].Design and Structure of Polysaccharide-Based Nanoparticles 87
aqueous solution having pH 8 is added in chitosan solution having pH 3.5 [21]. The final concentra￾tion of solution is 0.9 g/100 g and 1.5 g/100 g with pH values 4.34 and 5.16, respectively, resulting 
in the 3 : 1 mass ratio of CS:TPP. The final nanoparticle is designed as 0.9CN-TPP and 1.5CN-TPP, 
respectively [5] (Figure 4.3).
4.5.4 Synthesis of Chitosan-Dicarboxylic Acid NPs
One gram chitosan in 5.58mmol glucosamine was added and dissolved in 50mL HCL (0.37% v/v) 
aqueous solution. Certain amount of anhydride (phenyl succinic or phthalic) was incorporated and 
dissolved in pyridine, and a chitosan solution was added dropwise and stirred. To maintain the pH 
of the reaction mixture, some quantity of NaOH was added and the reaction was continued for 40 
minutes. Then precipitate was washed with absolute alcohol and acetone and allowed for drying for 
48hours in a hot air oven for 35°C [22].
4.5.5 Galactosylated Chitosan Nanoparticles
4.5.5.1 Synthesis (GACHNPs)
Chitosan was coupled with the lactobionic acid by carbodiimide reaction. When a small quantity 
of NHS (1.80 g) is dissolved in 20mL of HCl buffer solution at a pH of 4.7, then the carboxylic 
group of lactobionic acid (2.80 g) is activated. Then a small quantity of chitosan (1.25 g was 
dissolved in 200mL of HCl 90.1 M) buffer solution. Then the lactobionic acid solution and the 
chitosan solution were mixed by using a magnetic stirrer for 72 hours. Then the final product was 
distilled in a dialysis tube to purify galactosylated chitosan. Then the final product was dried by 
using lyophilization [23] (Table 4.2).
FIGURE 4.3 Deprotonation of amino group of chitosan and ionic crosslinking between chitosan and TPP.88 Polysaccharides
4.6 PROPERTIES OF POLYSACCHARIDE-BASED NANOPARTICLES
Polysaccharide-based NPs prepared by ionic crosslinking have the ability to efficiently encapsu￾late labile biomacromolecular drugs encompassing peptides and proteins without loss of activity. 
Alonso and coworkers successfully incorporated chitosan/tripolyphosphate (CS/TPP) nanoparticles 
for delivering biomacromolecular drugs and other low molecular weight drugs (Mw), such as doxo￾rubicin (DOX) [31–32]. High physical stability was shown by CS/TPP nanoparticles, and successful 
encapsulation was achieved for both plasmid DNA and dsDNA oligomers (20 mers), irrespective of 
the molecular mass of CS. Increasing the amount of deacetylation of CS (75.5%–92%) leads to slight 
improvement in the encapsulation efficiency [33]. Calcium-alginate nanoparticles prepared by ionic 
cross-linking showed high efficiency in transfection [34]. Nanoparticles prepared by polyelectrolyte 
complexation (PEC) have been demonstrated to be highly biocompatible. The molecular weight of 
CS greatly affected the particle sizes of the CS-DNA PECs, and high efficiency in transfection was 
achieved when CS with an Mw of 40–84kDa was employed [35]. Kim et al. synthesized nanocomplex

by employing anionic HA and cationic PEGylated tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis 
inducing ligand (TRAIL), a potential therapeutic protein for cancer and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) 
[36]. Enhanced in vivo stability and a remarkable therapeutic effect against RA compared to native 
poly(ethylene glycol) was achieved in the prepared HATRAIL nanocomplex. Kwon’s research group 
established hydrophobically modified glycol CS (HGC), which has the ability to form self-assembled 
nanoparticles, by the means of chemical conjugation of 5β-cholanic acid to glycol CS. These HGC 
nanoparticles achieved numerous advantageous characteristics such as serum stability, deformabil￾ity, and rapid uptake by tumor cells. In vivo results showed these nanoparticles to exhibit prolonged 
blood circulation and remarkable tumor specificity for delivering various anticancer drugs [31].
4.7 APPLICATIONS OF POLYSACCHARIDE-BASED NANOPARTICLES
Owing to the biocompatibility and biodegradability of polysaccharide NPs, they have remarkable 
advantages and prospective applications in biomedicine and biomaterials engineering. In recent 
years, applications in drug delivery and tissue engineering have also been studied and investigated 
owing to their favorable properties such as mucoadhesiveness and cellular uptake. For example, Park 
and coworkers investigated photodynamic therapy by employing chitosan CS-based nanoparticles. 
Here, the reactive oxygen species sensitive thioketal linker was utilized for conjugating photosen￾sitizer pheophorbide A with CS. In the aqueous environment, the self-assembly of the amphiphilic 
CS-conjugate into nanoparticles (NPs) occurred, leading to the self-quenching of the photosensitizer. 
Near IR was used for the activation of photosensitizer. The mechanism of circulation of polymeric 
drug or gene-loaded nanoparticles has also been studied recently. The drug or gene-loaded nanopar￾ticles are injected into the body that crosses the epithelial barrier, circulates in the blood vessels, 
and reaches the target site. The nanoparticles being more accessible to small openings and pores in 
tissues get accumulated at the target site, such as tumors, due to the enhanced penetration and reten￾tion effect (EPR). The application of drug or gene-loaded nanoparticles overcomes and prevents the 
adverse effect caused to the tissue by delivering the drug systemically. Also, polysaccharide NPs 
have been employed to enhance the solubility of drugs that are poorly soluble in water, deliver active 
drug molecules to the target site, and facilitate controlled and sustained release of drugs and genes. 
Polysaccharide NPs based on theranostic systems have also been fabricated as described by Lee 
and coworkers, e.g., fluorescence imaging and drug delivery, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), 
and near-IR fluorescence imaging and delivery of drugs. Yameens and coworkers developed a novel 
enzyme-responsive DEX-based oligoester NPs by crosslinking, for the controlled release of 5-fluoro￾uracil, an anticancer drug with improved release kinetics and decreased cell viability.
Polymer nanoparticles containing polysaccharide shells are also widely used as nanocarriers. For 
example, Xu et al. incorporated CS oligosaccharides, forming a cationic hydrophilic shell surround￾ing the anionic hydrophobic PLGA NPs. It was investigated from the results that the core-shell NPS 
formed showed enhanced water solubility and improved stability as compared to PLGA NPs without 
a CS oligosaccharide shell. The developed nanoparticles thus have application in transporting and 
delivering hydrophobic drugs and other nutraceuticals. Seabra and workers developed an alginate￾based system for delivering NO and Ag NPs. Alginate nanoparticles were made by gelation and Ca2+
precipitation. Ag NPs were developed by utilizing AgNO3, tea extract, and mercaptosuccinic acid, 
and later, it was encapsulated into the alginate NPs. The particles, loaded with NO through nitrosa￾tion of mercaptosuccinic, were demonstrated for antibacterial properties. It was investigated that the 
developed alginate-based NPs showed antibacterial activity against three bacterial strains. It dis￾played the synergistic effect of NO release and Ag NPs, without being toxic to Vero cells.
Tissue engineering utilizes the principle of engineering in life sciences and develops biologi￾cal substitutes that help restore, maintain, and improve functioning of tissue. From the genesis of 
scaffolds, hydrogels, and particulate systems ranging from biocompatible polymer, it also includes 
growth factors which are soluble-secreting proteins that play an important role in tissue regenera￾tion. Controlled release of therapeutic factors as in the case of drug delivery enhances the efficiency 
of tissue engineering. Polysaccharide-based nanoparticles have been found to be a suitable material 90 Polysaccharides
as a carrier since it has the ability to protect the protein-based growth factor, showing a versatile 
release profile with less possible side effects. Mandal and coworkers synthesized dual growth factor 
loaded CSNPs (chitosan nanoparticles) by incorporating epidermal growth factor (EGF), fibroblast 
growth factor (FGF), and CS. The developed CSNPs demonstrated successful delivery of growth 
factors from CSNPs, enhanced in vitro fibroblast proliferation, controlled release, and nontoxicity. 
These results paved the way for further application of these dual growth factors loaded nanoparticles 
in the tissue engineering domain. Nanotechnology by utilizing polysaccharide-based NPs has also 
been applied in the field of cosmetics. Several research studies are ongoing regarding the applica￾tion of polysaccharide-based NPs for improving and enhancing the properties of cosmetic products, 
using cosmetic ingredients for stabilizing pickering emulsion, and delivering useful substances. An 
emulsion is known to be a dispersion of two liquids that are immiscible with one another. It con￾sists of a stabilizer for the stability of the interfacial layer. The formed emulsion, in the absence of 
an interfacial stabilizer, becomes unstable leading to phase separation that causes creaming of the 
emulsion. In order to overcome the issue, surfactants and solid NPs are employed in the emulsion 
to lower the interfacial tension between the two liquid phases, thereby improving the stability of 
the emulsion. The resulting emulsion stabilized by incorporating solid NPs is quoted as pickering 
emulsions. Solid NPs have been proven to be a better alternative for stabilizing emulsion over sur￾factants. Since surfactants used as a stabilizer improve both kinetic and thermodynamic stability 
of the emulsion, they are associated with several limitations such as toxicity, high cost, and issues 
in recovery. Whereas polysaccharide NPs used as solid NPs are environment friendly and biologi￾cally compatible. Pickering emulsion also provides improved stability preventing coalescence and 
produces a long-term durable stabilized emulsion that has the potential application in cosmetics.
Polysaccharide-based NPs have also been employed as nanocarriers in cosmeceuticals since they 
are biodegradable. For example, cosmeceutical vitamin A alcohol, i.e., retinol, has been success￾fully encapsulated into CSNPs that demonstrated improved water solubility. Apart from skin care, 
polysaccharide NP-based nanocarriers have also been applied in hair care. Gelfuso and coworkers 
synthesized MXS minoxidil sulfate (MXS)-loaded CSNPs for targeted delivery to hair follicles. 
MXS has significant applications in treating androgenentic conditions i.e. alopecia in males as well 
as females, but these are also associated with several limitations such as low solubility in water, 
high irritancy, and side effects substantiated with its potent antihypertensive activity. Therefore, the 
targeted delivery of minoxidil to hair follicles has always been a topic for interest to the research￾ers. MXS-loaded CSNPs developed by Gelfuso et al. were investigated to accumulate into the hair 
follicles, demonstrating sustained release of MXS. Hence, MXS-loaded CSNPs were found to be 
an easy and promising delivery system to enhance the topical treatment of alopecia [29]. Also, 
there are several potent applications of polysaccharide-based NPs in the food and agricultural field. 
Packaging form a vital part in the food industry since it imparts protection against physical and 
chemical damages during storage and transportation, thereby improving shelf life and providing 
ease in handling. Many researchers investigated the improvement in physical and chemical proper￾ties, including mechanical strength and thermal stability in the food packaging material by incorpo￾rating CSNPS. For example, for the development of sustainable packaging material, polysaccharide 
NPs were incorporated that demonstrated lower water vapor permeability. Sun and coworkers inves￾tigated the corn starch-based packaging film by incorporating taro-derived selenium nanoparticles 
(SNPs). The resulting packaging film demonstrated significantly higher tensile strength which was 
the result of strong interaction between taro SNPs and films [2].
4.8 ADVANTAGES AND LIMITATIONS
The advantages associated with polysaccharide-based NPs are as follows:
1. Significant less toxic reagents involved in the preparation process
2. The preparation and synthesis involve simple stepsDesign and Structure of Polysaccharide-Based Nanoparticles 91
3. Optimization enables improvement in the yield and retention efficiency
4. Formation of nanoscale preparation composed of mucoadhesive polysaccharides such as 
chitosan with certain drugs increases the residence time in the body
5. Biodegradable enabling enhanced absorption via the epithelial barrier
6. Enables targeted delivery of hydrophobic drugs by getting incorporated in self-assembled 
amphiphilic polysaccharides
7. Improves the permeability, bioavailability, and retention of hydrophobic drugs [2]
Disadvantages associated with polysaccharide-based NPs are as follows:
1. Molecular imaging and targeted therapeutics have shown interesting results, but the 
conclusive performance of these nanocarriers is yet to be established and studied in 
clinical trials.
2. The clinical translation of these novel nanocarriers due to their inherent complexity is the 
greatest challenge.
3. Significant challenges are faced during the optimization of nanoparticle properties for 
improving targeting and reducing non-specific tissue residence.
4.9 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE PERSPECTIVE
As reviewed above, several polysaccharide-based nanoparticles had been synthesized and prepared 
for therapeutic drug, genes, and cosmeceutical delivery. This gives insight for the development of 
more polysaccharide-based nanoparticles for drug delivery systems [37]. Physicochemical proper￾ties, drug loading ability, in vitro toxicity, and in vivo tests have been explored for these polysaccha￾ride NPs. There is a need for more investigational research for cases of specific interaction of these 
nanoparticles with human organs, tissues, and cells. The effect brought by them on metabolism 
along with a broad range of applications in drug delivery, etc. is yet to be explored in the future. 
These nanoparticles have the potential to overcome unmet clinical needs in the form of personal￾ized medicines. Until now, the research on polysaccharide-based nanoparticles had been restricted 
to academic institutions. Therefore, there is a need for medical translation of nanoparticles, their 
nanoscale manufacturing, scale-up, and regulatory requirements.

Sweet Solutions to 
Sticky Situations

5.1 INTRODUCTION
Polymers in adhesive technology feature a major contribution within global marketing. The phenol￾formaldehyde resins, polyesters, elastomers, polyacrylates, and polyurethanes are the backbone for 
polymers in adhesive applications.1 While these polymers are highly functional and have a big 
selection of applications, the sources of the polymers are non-renewable and depleting petrochemi￾cal sources. Also, a variety of toxic chemicals are used for the synthesis of those adhesives. As an 
example, in the synthesis of PU adhesive, toxic monomers like methylene diphenyl diisocyanate 
(MDI) are used. Likewise, for phenol-formaldehyde resins, the usage of formaldehyde is important.
These adhesives thereby are toxic to animals and other organisms.
Bioadhesives or the employment of biopolymers as an adhesive are very prominent nowadays as 
they are from natural sources, renewable, non-toxic, and price effective. Polysaccharides, nucleic 
acids, polyesters, polythioesters, polyoxoesters, proteins, polyisoprenoids, and polyphenols are 
the key examples of bioadhesives. Polysaccharides have been used for a long term as an adhesive 
in many applications. Polysaccharides are polymeric carbohydrates bounded together by glyco￾sidic linkage with an enormous number of hydroxyl group. Polysaccharides, which are the fore￾most abundant natural biopolymer, have many physical, chemical, and biological characteristics. 
Monosaccharides act as the constituent element, and glycosidic linkages form the building block 
of those polymers, which successively regulates the heterogeneity and complication of the polysac￾charides. Polysaccharides are the biggest constituent of biomass. It is said that over 90% of the 
carbohydrate mass in nature is within the sort of polysaccharides. Polysaccharides originate from a 
range of sources—from the farm, the forest, generally all plants, the ocean, shells of aquatic organ￾isms, microbes, and eventually by chemical alteration of natural polysaccharides. The event of 
polysaccharide adhesives is of utter significance because of their structural mutability and various 
intra- and intermolecular interactions.
This review mainly focuses on nine differing types of polysaccharide-based adhesive. It briefly 
describes the sources, synthesis routes, properties, and also advantages. As we move forward, the 
review gives more information about the mechanism of adhesive formation and testing techniques. 
Toward the last part, the review ends with the possible application areas of polysaccharide adhesives.
5.2 TYPES OF POLYSACCHARIDES-BASED ADHESIVE
5.2.1 Chitosan-Based Adhesive
Chitosan is one among the interesting bio-based polymers such as protein, tannin, and lignin which 
are used as adhesives.2 The presence of OH– groups within the chitosan causes interaction with other 
chemical functions, which provides the adhesive with more cohesive strength. The properties such 
as biodegradability, biocompatibility, and good mechanical properties make them a decent material Polysaccharides as Adhesive 95
for adhesive application. It is the second most abundant natural polysaccharide on earth. In 1859, it 
was found that chitin is often made water soluble by chemical modification. The chitin was altered 
chemically and was called chitosan by Hoppe-Seyler.3 Chitosan possesses two sorts of monomers 
2-amino-2-deoxy-β-d-glucopyranose and 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-β-d-glucopyranose, which contains 
an acetamido group and an amino group.4 The main dissimilarity within the structure of chitosan 
and chitin is that in second position of chitosan, acetamide group is substituted (Figure 5.1).
The source of chitosan is a natural source like shrimp, crab, and lobster.5 It is also found on the 
exoskeleton of insects and fungal cell walls.6 Every shellfish waste doesn’t seem to be a source of 
chitin.7 The content of chitin varies from source to source, like oyster contains 4%–6% of chitin 
while blue crab contains 14% of chitin.8 The percentage of chitin depends on the proportions of 
minerals, proteins, carotenoids, and species.8
The countries such as Japan, the US, India, Poland, and Australia produce chitin and chitosan 
commercially.9 The annual production of chitin is approximately 1 × 1010 to 1 × 1012 tons in nature.10
The high amount of production of chitin in nature makes it a less costly and mostly obtainable biopoly￾mer.11 Chitosan is produced from chitin by the enzymatic deacetylation of chitin.12 The property within 
which the chitosan strongly depends on molecular chain orientation and regular packing. Crystalline 
of chitosan is much less than chitin, which makes it more dissolvable and available to reagents.
The material which is employed to affix two surfaces by means of strong adhesion is thought as 
adhesive.13 The adhesion is guaranteed by the diffusion of adhesive within the gap of the surface 
before it gets solidified. The adsorption theory gives the mechanism of adhesion. The theory con￾tains interatomic and intermolecular forces formed between adhesive molecules and molecules at 
the surface of adherend.
An adhesive in the liquid state is characterized by viscosity, surface tension, and diffusion of 
the adhesive on the surface of a material. To achieve a decent molecular interaction, the surface 
tension of the adhesive should be equal to the material surface energy. Comparing the surface ten￾sion of metals and polymers (metal Aluminum-1134m Nm−1 and polymers Polyethylene 35.76m 
Nm−1),14,15 chitosan at low concentration has a surface tension of 64m Nm−1, which decreases after 
an extended time.16 The chitosan solution with more concentration has lower surface tensions. These 
key factors, the high dispersive part, and lower surface tension make the chitosan spread easily 
in every kind of material. It shows Newtonian behavior and shear-thinning behavior at not up to 
0.25% (w/v) and above this value.17 With increasing concentration, the viscosity of chitosan has been 
increased, and with temperature, it decreased.18 The viscosities of classical and artificial adhesives 
vary significantly. For instance, in the case of phenol formaldehyde, the viscosity range between 
FIGURE 5.1 Structure of chitosan.96 Polysaccharides
60 and 2825 MPa s, and polysaccharide adhesive range from 40 to 400 Pa s. The chitosan adhesive 
includes a larger value which makes it suitable as an adhesive. It also has an excellent bonding prop￾erty.19 The glass transition temperature and the temperature of decomposition are two values that 
characterize the adhesive thermal resistance. The thermal decomposition temperature of chitosan 
is 250°C, which makes it useful as an adhesive in temperatures above the room temperature.19,20
The chitosan adhesive found application mainly in biomedical adhesives, which mainly focus 
on purposes like surgery and substitute for traditional drug delivery systems.21 It is also employed 
in  skin wound closure because of its hemostatic properties.22 It is a wonderful mucoadhesive 
(swollen stage) that might adhere to hard and soft tissues.23 The films made of chitosan are used in 
wound healing and tissue repair.24–26 It is also used as a wood adhesive.
5.2.2 Cellulose Based Adhesive
Cellulose is the most abundant biopolymer in the world, and it’s a polysaccharide consisting of 
β-1,4 linked d-glucose units. They’re synthesized from a sizable amount of living organisms start￾ing from the bacterium Dictyostelium discoideum to larger trees.27 The primary reason cellulose 
is used as paper and other composite materials are due to its easy adhesion. Cellulose could be a 
linear molecule, and they are bonded by intramolecular and intermolecular hydrogen bonds and 
also Van der Waals force. Cellulose has a strong affinity to water-containing molecules. The hydro￾gen bonding that occurs when wetted fibers dry and comes in contact with one another is primarily 
responsible for the binding of cellulose fibers in paper.28 The advantage of cellulose is that a variety 
of hydroxyl groups present on cellulose molecule leads to the formation of different derivatives, and 
these derivatives successively give comparable adhesive properties to cellulose. On the opposite 
hand, the most problem that lies within cellulose is that the OH groups of cellulose have likely less 
chance to break making the polymer insoluble in solvents. As a result, cellulose undergoes etherifi￾cation and esterification to make derivatives that have excellent adhesive properties.
5.2.2.1 Cellulose Modification
Esterification and etherification are the two main chemical modifications of cellulose. Esterification 
is the reaction of mixing an organic acid with an alcohol to produce an ester and water. Common 
esterified cellulose includes nitrocellulose, cellulose ester, and cellulose ester butyrate. On the oppo￾site hand, etherification is a process of dehydration of alcohols to provide ethers. Methyl cellulose, 
ethyl cellulose, and carboxy methyl cellulose are the samples of etherified cellulose.
5.2.2.2 Esterification
A German-Swiss scientist named Schonbein found the procedure for esterification for the primary 
time. He synthesized cellulose nitrate by a reaction of cellulose, acid, and aqua fortis. The formed 
material was too inflammable that its usage was restricted, and its first use was as smokeless gunpow￾der. The particular synthesis of cellulose nitrate involves the reaction between cellulose and nitric acid, 
where sulfuric acid acts as a catalyst giving cellulose nitrate and water. The foremost common applica￾tion of cellulose nitrate is general-purpose household cement. When applied to a substrate, the solution 
immediately loses all its solvent to make strong, moisture-resistant, transparent films (Figure 5.2).29
Cellulose acetate, on the other side, despite being the most important ester derivative of cellulose, 
is not widely used as an adhesive. It is synthesized from the chemical reaction of cellulose and acetic 
anhydride, catalyzed by sulfuric acid.30 Then the triacetate is partially hydrolyzed to achieve the desired 
degree of substitution (DS). Lately, a variety of other synthesis methods for cellulose ester has been 
performed.31 Cellulose acetate butyrate is another esterified cellulose and has more advantages than cel￾lulose acetate. These include good spraying ability, chemical stability, good chlorine tolerance, and cold￾crack and moisture resistance, and it acts as a stable carrier dispersing medium for pigments.32 Though 
there is a number of synthesis methods used, the foremost common method of production may be a reac￾tion between acetic anhydride and butyric acid or propionic acid catalyzed by sulfuric acid.Polysaccharides as Adhesive 97
5.2.2.3 Etherification
One of the earliest used etherified cellulose is methyl cellulose. They are mainly used for sizing 
and paper coating to give oil resistance, as a binder in ceramics, as a non-tinting paste for wallpa￾per, and in adhesives for leather drying.33 Ethyl cellulose is another type. Its synthesis method is 
similar to methyl cellulose. It is obtained by a reaction between ethyl chloride and cellulose. As 
a result of their soluble nature, the films usually have a tendency to swell little or no within the 
presence of water. In adhesive application, ethyl cellulose can either be applied as a solvent or in 
FIGURE 5.2 Significant reactions of cellulose.98 Polysaccharides
a hot melt form. Carboxy methyl cellulose is the most typically and widely used etherified cellu￾lose. It’s also called sodium salt and is very soluble in water because of its ionic nature. They have 
significant use in the food industry as a thickener as a result of their non-toxicity.34 In addition, a 
variety of research on carboxy methyl cellulose as an oral delivery system and other pharmaceuti￾cal applications is taking place.35
5.2.3 Starch-Based Adhesive
Starch is a biodegradable, abundant, renewable, and inexpensive polymer. Moreover, it is the second 
most abundant natural polymer. The abundance range comes after cellulose and is on the market 
mainly from the roots, corn, stalks rice, wheat, potato, and tapioca. Starch could be a polysaccha￾ride, consisting of amylose and amylopectin. Linear amylose and branched amylopectin are the two 
main components of starch, representing its simplest forms. Lipids, proteins, ash, and moisture are 
constituents of starch in low amounts. The amylose and amylopectin content in a starch depends on 
its source, and most starches contain 20%–30% amylose, although different varieties can contain 
quite 80% amylose (Figure 5.3).36
Starch in water cannot act as adhesive as starch is so tightly bound in granules. So, for starch to 
be used as an adhesive, modification is important. The branches of amylose and amylopectin are 
opened using suitable methods like acidic/alkali treatment, heat treatment, and oxidation.37
In heat treatment, starch is simply heated or cooked until gelation occurs. Usually, the gelation 
temperature for starch lies between 55°C and 75°C. But just in the case of starch, a phenomenon 
called retrogradation occurs. It is a process where suspensions of amylose and high-amylose starches 
have a bent to harden and become solid upon cooling.38 In alkali treatment, gelation temperature 
may be lowered when alkalis like sodium hydroxide are added.39 Acid treatment is completed by 
heating the starch to 45°C–55°C using suitable mineral acids and then neutralizing it with a base. 
Oxidized starch is additionally commercially available. There is a variety of oxidizing agents used, 
but aqueous alkaline hypochlorite treatment is the most typically preferred. Oxidized starch will be 
more viscous, stable, and has an excellent range of adhesion. Hypochlorite is taken into account as 
one of the foremost efficient oxidants.40
5.2.4 Pullulan-Based Adhesive
Pullulan, a linear glucosic polysaccharide, is a water-soluble polymer synthesized by the polymor￾phic fungus Aureobasidium pullulans.41 A low degree of hydrogen bonding in the crystal form makes 
it water soluble. It’s an exopolysaccharide and encompasses a large choice of applications in numer￾ous sectors ranging from food and pharmaceutical industries to biomedical applications.42 Pullulan, 
a linear α-d-glucan, contains malt trioseas subunits and is connected by (1–6)-α-d-glycosidic 
FIGURE 5.3 Structure of starch.Polysaccharides as Adhesive 99
linkages. Because it contains a unique linkage pattern, pullulan shows exemplary physical proper￾ties, like fiber and film formation, adhesion capacity, etc. Due to these advantages, pullulan has long 
been employed in various applications like food adhesive, blood plasma alternatives, and cosmetic 
additives. One of the most features of pullulan is that it can be chemically altered to decrease the 
water solubility or to extend the pH sensitivity by functionalizing the polymer by various means.43,44
The characteristics that make it an excellent choice of adhesive is that pullulan can easily form 
fibers, compression moldings, and oxygen-proof films. The introduction of various groups in pul￾lulan helps in modifying its properties thereby helping in numerous adhesive applications.
5.2.5 Levan-Based Adhesive
Levan is a polysaccharide that is found in some plants and microorganisms. They comprise mostly 
fructosyl residues linked by β-2,6-carbon45 and are mainly synthesized from sucrose or molas￾ses. Some of the unique characteristics which make this polymer different from others are strong 
adhesivity, their property to self-assemble into spherical colloids in water, very low intrinsic viscos￾ity, and biocompatibility. Because of its attractive properties, it is having various applications in 
medicine, beauty products, food, and other industries.46 Compared to other natural polymers, it has 
higher shear and tensile strength. The polymer has all the properties of the material needed for an 
adhesive like thermal stability, tensile strength, and reversibility.
Levan is a natural and biodegradable adhesive that acts as a binder in the manufactured wood, 
foundry sand cores,47 fiberglass, and bare aluminum.48 It is also used as a bioadhesive in engineering 
smart scaffolds, drug delivery systems, tissue engineering, and wound-healing applications.49 Adhesion 
can be explained as bonding between the surfaces of two different substances. In the case of Levan, 
the hydroxyl group along with Van der Waal forces keeps the adhesion. Metals create strong adhesive 
bonds with Levan than the polymers. The main adhesive application of Levan adhesive is membranes 
and films fabricated from Levan for medical applications such as drug delivery systems, implants, sen￾sors, and optoelectronics. Adhesive Levan can bond aluminum films, similar to a wood adhesive.
5.2.6 Dextran-Based Adhesive
Dextran is a natural polymer that has attained great attention due to its natural resources, non￾toxicity, and good water-soluble ability. It is a bacterial-derived polysaccharide of glucose in which 
they are linked mainly by – (1–6) type.50 It is synthesized directly by dextransucrases and by polym￾erizing the glucose of the sucrose in dextran. In industry, it is produced through Leuconostoc mes￾enteroides NRRLB512.51 The dextran is classified into two categories based on the length of the 
chains like simple dextran having a molecular weight greater than 40kDa and oligodextran having 
a molecular weightless than 40 kDa.52,53
It has been employed in biomedical fields by chemically modifying dextran into hydrogels via 
crosslinking.54 Synthetic dextran hydrogels are utilized in tissue adhesives and vascular tissue engi￾neering.55,56 Aldehyde dextran together with a series of amine-PEG act as a controlled biocompati￾ble tissue adhesive.57 The dextran-based bioadhesive can crosslink at a fast rate and may adhere with 
a very good strength. They can’t adhere to the surface of gels because of the high swelling ratio.
5.2.7 Xanthan Based Adhesive
Xanthan gum is an extracellular heteropolysaccharide consisting of d-glucose, d-mannose, d-glucuronic 
acid, pyruvic acid which has acetal linkages, and O-acetyl repeating unit.58 It is a pentasaccharide derived 
from bacteria and fungi.59 Xanthan is synthesized commercially by fermentation. It is used in a large 
number of applications like in eatables, beauty aids, drugs, and medicines.60,61 When combined with 
other polysaccharides like starch, we get a variety of films and hydrogels having different properties.62–64
One of the main disadvantages lies within its hydrophilicity making its application limited to adhesives. 100 Polysaccharides
Therefore, improving the property, xanthan gum is oxidized which decreases hydrophilicity.65 Xanthan 
gum reacts with chitosan efficiently.66 The combined adhesive of chitosan with oxidized dextran has 
good bonding strength, which finds application in surgery for bone or tissue gluing.67
It found application in toothpastes and gels as an ideal stabilizer. It is also used as an emulsion 
stabilizer and water binder in creams and lotions. Hypoallergenic and benign nature of xanthan 
makes it useful in pharmaceutical applications. Sialorrhea was treated using thiolated xanthan gum. 
The thiolation was done using l-cysteine which releases tannin in buccal mucosa. This functional￾ization of xanthan gum resulted in improved adherence on the buccal mucosa.68
5.2.8 Gum Arabic
Gum arabic aka gum Acacia is a tree gum efflux. The gum is oozed out from Acacia Senegal 
or Acacia Seyal trees. This has been commercially used since ancient times as paints for hiero￾glyphic inscriptions by Egyptians. The main component of gum arabic is polysaccharides along 
with glycoproteins and oligosaccharides. It’s neutral or slightly acidic and composed of 1,3-linked 
β-d-galactopyranosyl units. l-Arabinose, l-rhamnose, and d-glucuronic acid have also been found 
as components of this gum. They are environmentally friendly, harmless, and have low carbon foot￾prints. It’s easily soluble, excellent emulsifier, highly binding, and a really good stabilizing agent. As 
a result, it’s heavily in usage in food, pharmaceutical, textile, and cosmetic industries.69 It also has 
antimicrobial properties and helps in demineralizing teeth; it will increases its usage in dentistry.70
Gum arabic is generally a good adhesive for soft substrates.71 As gum arabic is a polyelectrolyte, the 
viscosity of the solution drops when electrolytes are present as a result of charge screening and at 
low pH when the carboxyl groups get undissociated.72
5.2.9 Gellan Gum
Gellan gum is a hydrophilicpolymer derived from bacteria. It’s an anionic polysaccharide that con￾sists of tetra saccharide as a repeating unit, and it can withstand temperature around 120°C. Gellan 
gum can be produced artificially by fermenting sugar with bacteria. It works as a plant-based alter￾native to gelatin. It is also similar to xanthan gum. It is used as an additive for food which is used 
to bind and is used as a stabilizer for processed foods. It is also a gelling agent and gives jelly like 
consistency to food. It is also used in medical and pharmaceutical application for tissue regenera￾tion, bone repair, and drug manufacturing.
5.3 MECHANISM OF ADHESION
Adhesives have been used for many centuries and are still a popular alternative to mechanical joints 
in engineering applications. The binding strength of an adhesive to an adherend can be described 
as a sum of various forces such as mechanical, physical, and chemical and also involves several 
theories. The basic principle behind the adsorption theory of adhesion is that adhesion occurs once 
two materials come into contact at the molecular level. This can be physisorption or chemisorption. 
The primary or secondary forces are more than enough supply to provide a high bond strength along 
with good wettability. A clean surface, ideally, zero contact angles between the adherend and adhe￾sive is required to have adequate wettability, and it greatly depends on interfacial tension. Thus, the 
contact angle can be calculated as follows:
Cos lg sg sl γ θ = γ − γ
where γ is the interfacial tension, θ denotes contact angle, and s, l, and g are solid, liquid, and 
gas, respectively. The mechanical theory involves interlocking, where the adhesive penetrates the 
cavities or pores on the surface of the material. As the roughness of the exterior area increases, the Polysaccharides as Adhesive 101
mechanical adhesion also enhances. One of the indicators used to identify roughness is the root 
mean square, Rrms, as follows:73
R
(h h)
n rms i i
2
∑ =
−
where hi
 is the ith sampling point feature height value, h is the mean height value, and n is the 
number of data points. In the 1920s McBain and Hopkins’ stated: “that a good joint must result 
whenever a strong continuous film of partly embedded adhesive is formed in situ.” The mechanical 
theory was also used to explain the adhesion of all other metallic substrates. Further, in the 1940s, 
Deryagin introduced the electrostatic theory which reveals the interactive electron transfer between 
adherend and adhesive. In this theory, the adhesive-substrate system is considered comparable to 
a parallel plate condenser. In addition, diffusion theory by Voyutskii put forward a representation 
for polymer-to-polymer adherence. This theory explains the adhesion of polymers that are mutu￾ally capable of mixing by considering the dependence of time and molecular weight on adhesion.74
5.3.1 Mechanical Tests for Adhesion Strength
A wide range of testing methods have been performed to find out how strong are the adhesives, 
and this includes the test for tension, compression, cleavage, shear, and peel stresses. Their primary 
use is to induce shear stress to find the stability of an adhesive by evaluating the properties like 
tensile strength, durability, deformability, and brittleness.75 Besides that, lap tests, such as thin-lap 
shear, double-lap shear, strap joint, and thick adhered shear, are most familiar among mechanical 
tests for adhesive joints. From the standpoint of specimen preparation and testing, a single-lap or 
thin-lap joint test is pretty simple. However, these tests are aware of the limitations of accurately 
determining the design parameters of the joint, as the force is given at the end. To overcome these 
disadvantages, a new mechanical test was put forward: the double-lap test. Even though the test is 
expensive, it gives the shear strength of adhesives directly. The shape of thin adherend tails and end 
fillets is helpful to control the point of stress maximum. Moreover, the tension pull tests determine 
the force needed to stretch the adhesive from the surface, and the peel test measures the resistance 
of the adhesive-adherend system to force peel loading (Figure 5.4).76
5.4 APPLICATIONS OF POLYSACCHARIDE-BASED ADHESIVE
5.4.1 Biomedical and Pharmaceutical Applications
The biocompatibility, biodegradability, antimicrobial activity, non-toxicity, and low-cost properties 
make polysaccharide-based adhesives a suitable candidate for several biomedical applications. In 
drug delivery and biological hemostasis application, chitosan is used as a promising bio adhesive. A 
mucoadhesive neuronanoemulsion based on N,N,N-trimethyl chitosan and flaxseed oil was reported 
for application of drug delivery directly from nose to brain in Parkinson’s disease treatment.77 In 
2020, Zhang et al. prepared hydroxybutyl chitosan and diatom-biosilica based porous composite 
sponge with effective hemorrhage control. The composite sponge can shortened the clotting time 
up to 70% than that of control by the quick absorption of plasma, increasing hemocyte and platelet 
concentrations and thereby triggering the blood coagulation.78 Furthermore, the macroporous scaf￾fold from methacrylate dextran and aminoethyl methacrylate was used as cell adhesive in tissue 
engineering. The cell adhesion and neurite outgrowth was improved by the covalent modification 
with extracellular matrix-derived peptides.79 Recently, Singh et al. reported composites of bacterial 
cellulose and carbene as bioadhesive in oral cavity applications.80
The polysaccharides such as levan, pullulan, chitosan, and starch have found notable applica￾tions in the pharmaceutical field. Levan is used to producing temporary coating or bandage and 102 Polysaccharides
tablet binder since it is an adhesive of very strength and a water-soluble film-forming material.81 The 
in-vitro studies of bioadhesive films of pullulan-polyacrylamide blends show the potential of this 
material in immediate-release formulations for dermal applications.82 The substituted starches such 
as carboxymethyl starch, starch acetate, and crosslinked starch has wide application in oral tablets 
to control drug release (Figure 5.5).83
5.4.2 Industrial Applications
The polysaccharide-based adhesives are used as binders and thickening agents in wood, paper, and 
textile industries. The extracellular polysaccharide-based wood adhesive exhibits improved perfor￾mance in shear strength and moisture resistance.84 In the wood industry, modified polysaccharides 
significantly improve the adhesion properties. In this regard, starch-based wood adhesive with silica 
nanoparticles enhances both the bonding strength and water resistance compared to starch-based 
adhesive without silica nanoparticles.85 Besides that, the chitosan-phenolics system is also used as 
a strong wood adhesive.86 In the paper industry, adhesives are used for repairing holes and gaps, or 
consolidating paper. Due to high chemical stability for artificial aging, low color alteration, depo￾lymerization, and pH changes, starch base-adhesives are commonly used in paper consolidation.87
5.4.3 Food and Packaging Application
In the preservation of spiced and flavored coatings in oil roasting of nutmeat products, the dextrin￾based food-grade adhesives are used along with slight amount of xanthan, carboxymethyl cellulose, 
or its mixtures. Besides that, the dried sap of gum arabic has significant use in many foodstuffs 
applications as a stabilizer, binder, and shelf-life enhancer.75 Adhesives are inevitable in packaging. 
The polysaccharide-based adhesives, mainly starch and its derivatives, come in the classification of 
water-based adhesives for packaging application. Due to low-cost, biodegradability, and availability 
FIGURE 5.4 Various modes of mechanical testing.Polysaccharides as Adhesive 103
in good quality grades, starch adhesives are remarkably used for corrugated board making, paper 
bag manufacturing, and also for tube winding. In fast-drying applications, dextrin adhesives, deriv￾atives of starch, are widely used. It is also available in different viscosities, and modifications are 
also possible, which makes it suitable for applications such as bonding paper-based materials, tube 
winding, and high-speed labeling (Table 5.1).88

5.5 CONCLUSION
Polysaccharides have developed an increasing application in the field of adhesives. The ease of 
availability, low cost, and biodegradability have made them more popular. Polysaccharides such 
as starch, chitosan, and cellulose which are obtained from natural and renewable resources are 
the right alternative for petroleum-based adhesives in the near future. Each of these bioadhe￾sives poses different properties such as non-toxicity, biocompatibility, and antimicrobial activity, 
along with good bond strength. The wide range of applications of polysaccharide-based adhe￾sives includes the biomedical, pharmaceutical, packaging, cosmetics, wood, and paper industries. 
Detailed research and studies are required for the improvement of bond strength and thermal 
properties of these adhesives. The adhesive properties of these natural polymers can be enhanced 
through modification by cross-linking or combining with additives and this can make them more 
attractive in the commercial market.

6.1 INTRODUCTION
Carbohydrates are the important ingredient of the dietary component. Carbohydrates are the 
complex biomolecules that exist abundantly around us. It can be found profusely on the cell sur￾face of eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Carbohydrates are an integral part of living system and are 
involved in various biological processes, cellular interactions, and signaling to various cellular 
molecules and cell surface receptors. This biomolecule plays an important role in various diseases. 
Carbohydrates are involved in different imperative biological process, including cell identification 
events, signal transduction, intercellular adhesion, cellular differentiation, molecular recognition, 
and embryonic development. These molecules serves as the building blocks of genetic materials 
like DNA and RNA. Carbohydrates are immediate source of energy; moreover, these are involved 
in a variety of biological events, including reproduction, immune responses, inflammation, build￾ing macromolecules, signal transmission, signal transduction, and infection. Cell recognition is 
accelerated through cell surface saccharides, which is involved in drug development. Lectin is a 
carbohydrate-binding protein present on the cell surface, and saccharides bind to that site in vari￾ous diseased states. Oligosaccharides are located on the cell exteriors, playing a crucial role in 
controlling the interactions of cells with other cells in the extracellular environment and with vari￾ous molecules. As carbohydrates are involved in cellular recognition and signaling, these are used 
as therapeutics and diagnostics in various areas like infectious diseases, cancer, inflammation, 
immunology, neurodegenerative disease, vascular diseases, diabetes, and arthritis. Novel carbo￾hydrates-based therapeutics have wide scope and applications. Carbohydrates exhibit significant 
biological importance as biologically active molecule. In addition, they act as starting materials for 
various therapeutic agents like d-glucose.1,2
Carbohydrates are involved in formation of genetic materials, supporting the structure of 
organisms. A large variety of monosaccharide and oligosaccharide residues are attached 
through glyosidic linkages to form fundamental glycoconjugates, glycoproteins, glycolipids, and 110 Polysaccharides
glycosylated natural products. Natural and semisynthetic glycoconjugates have been used as 
anticancer and antimicrobial drugs. Carbohydrates possess outstanding characteristics like bio￾compatible, biodegradable, hydrophilic, nonimmunogenic, and nontoxic. Carbohydrate-based 
microparticles and nanoparticles have grabbed huge attention due to biomedical applications 
as it is being used for bioimaging, biosensing, and as targeted and controlled drug delivery. 
Polysaccharides are biocompatible substance having suitable rigidity and functionality, form￾ing polymeric biomaterials that have extensive applications in drug delivery, biomedical, tissue 
engineering, etc. Carbohydrate-based polymers like β-cyclodextrins can be used as solubilizing 
agents in various dosage forms. Carbohydrates have been extensively explored in the develop￾ment and discovery of new drug. Marine carbohydrates are significant biological macromol￾ecules that broadly exist in marine algae and animals. Examples include alginate, carrageenan, 
porphyran, fucoidan, ulvan, agarose, and chitosan.3,4
6.2 CLASSIFICATION OF CARBOHYDRATES
Carbohydrates are huge source of energy, available in the form of starch, sugar, legumes, fruits, 
vegetables, and fibers. Carbohydrates, based on the number of sugar moieties present, are mainly 
classified as monosaccharides (single sugar unit), disaccharides (two carbohydrate units), oligo￾saccharides (three to nine carbohydrate units), and polysaccharides (more than nine carbohydrate 
units). Monosaccharides and oligosaccharides residues are bridged by glyosidic linkages to form 
crucial glycoconjugates, including glycoproteins, glycolipids, and glycosylated natural products. 
Polysaccharides are also called as glycans.5
Polysaccharides containing similar monosaccharides are homopolysaccharides, and polysaccha￾rides containing different monosaccharides are heteropolysaccharides. Based on the number of car￾bon atoms present, monosaccharides are further classified as tetrose, pentose, hexose, nanose, etc. 
Naturally occurring sugar acids (monosaccharides) are another important class of carbohydrates. 
Aldonic acid, uronic acid, glucuronic acid, ascorbic acid, and sialic acid are some physiologically 
important sugar acids. Sialic acids are diverse monosaccharides that can mediate various pathologi￾cal and physiological processes. Pathogens of diseases like human influenza A, Helicobacter pylori, 
and Vibrio cholerae attach to sialic acid present on human cell surface, thus regulating immune 
response and ligand selection.6,7.
 Imino sugar is another important carbohydrate class, obtained 
from natural plants. Imino sugar inhibits selective glycosyl transferases involved in cancer and 
microbial disease, thus it can be used as therapeutic agent.8
6.3 CARBOHYDRATES AS THERAPEUTICS
6.3.1 Glycoconjugates as Therapeutic Agents
Carbohydrates exhibit diversity in structure, property, and function that facilitate to synthe￾size novel carbohydrate-based therapeutic agents or make significant improvements to advance 
the activity of existing drugs.8 Carbohydrates-based drugs are of natural origin, obtained from 
marine sources, animal extracts, plant origin, bacterial sources, etc. There are some examples 
of natural origin carbohydrate-based therapeutics. For instance, Ancer 20 is used in the man￾agement of leukopenia, and it is derived from different tubercle bacillus. Heparin is the oldest 
carbohydrate-based drug, isolated from porcine intestinal mucosal tissue, and used as an antico￾agulant drug. It is complex mixture of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) polysaccharides. Hyaluronic 
acid is natural oligosaccharide that has been used extensively, especially in ophthalmology. 
Acemannan is complex polysaccharide isolated from aloe vera used in wound healing. Acarbose 
is obtained from Actinoplanes utahensis bacterial species and is used in the management of 
Type II diabetes mellitus. Sodium hyaluronate is obtained from animal source and is used as an 
antiarthritic agent (Figure 6.1).4,9Carbohydrate-Based Therapeutics 111
6.3.2 Carbohydrate-Based Antibiotics
Antibiotics are the chemical compounds produced by microorganisms that interfere with meta￾bolic process and precisely inhibit the expansion of or kill microorganisms. Carbohydrate antibi￾otics are microbial metabolites, and these can be isolated from bacteria, fungi, plants, algae, etc. 
Carbohydrate-based antibiotics are mostly fungal and bacterial origin. Carbohydrate-based anti￾biotics are microbial metabolites having antifungal and antibacterial properties with carbohydrate 
component in chemical structure. There are three types of carbohydrate-based antibiotics, like ami￾noglycosides, macrolides, nucleoside analogs, and glycosylated aromatic structures.
First antibiotics group includes carbohydrates linked glycosidically with cyclitols or amino￾cyclitols, i.e., aminoglycoside antibiotics which consist of gentamicin, amikacin, tobramycin, 
streptomycin, and kanamycin. Second group includes oligosaccharides in which monosaccha￾rides are linked glycosidically as well as with one or more orthoester linkages, i.e., orthosomy￾cins antibiotics which consist of flambamycin, hygromycin, destomycins, avilamycins, etc. Third 
group include carbohydrates linked glycosidically with non-carbohydrate group of antibiotic like 
macrolide antibiotics, e.g., erythromycin, clarithromycin, azithromycin, nystatin, etc. Macrolide 
antibiotics have broad-spectrum antibacterial activities, and they are used in the management of 
respiratory tract infections associated with patients allergic to penicillin.1,2 Carbohydrates are 
linked to nucleotide moiety, giving rise to antibiotics such as liposidomycin, tunicamycin, mure￾idomycins, etc.
Aminoglycoside antibiotics are highly potent drugs that inversely bind to small subunit of 
bacterial ribosome 30 S and thereby inhibit protein synthesis. These are used in the treatment 
of aerobic, gram positive bacterial infection. Streptomycin has been used in the treatment of 
tuberculosis. Streptomycin is an effective against gram positive as well as gram negative bacteria. 
Amikacin and kanamycin are mainly effective in the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculo￾sis. Kanamycin is used in the management of infections caused by Escherichia coli, Proteus, and 
Acinetobacter species.4
Nucleoside antibiotics inhibit biosynthesis of peptidoglycan attached on the outer plasma mem￾brane of bacterial cell wall. Mildiomycin is a peptidyl nucleoside antibiotic produced by an actino￾mycete that obstructs the fungal peptidyl-transferase center of the larger ribosomal subunit and acts 
as antifungal agent. Among lipopeptide antibiotics, ramoplanin is glycolipodepsipeptide produced by 
Actinoplanes spp. It is new class of antimicrobial agent antibiotic that interferes with peptidoglycan 
production and thereby blocks bacterial cell wall biosynthesis. It is used in the treatment for multiple 
antibiotic-resistant Clostridium difficile infection of the gastrointestinal tract (Figure 6.2).10,11

6.3.3 Carbohydrate-Based Vaccine
Vaccination is important to fight against infectious diseases. Pneumovax was the first polysac￾charide-based vaccine, commercially launched by Merck in 1983. Avery and Heidelberger in the 
1920s have discovered carbohydrate-based vaccines, containing capsular polysaccharides (CPS) for 
Streptococcus pneumoniae. Carbohydrate-based vaccines have been discovered, developed, and 
effectively used against a variety of infectious diseases, including cancer, hepatitis, meningitis, 
pneumonia, influenza, and viral diseases. Carbohydrate antigens are present on the bacterial cell 
surface in the form of glycans, and these glycans have unique complex structures that distinguish 
them from mammalian glycans. Thus glycan become promising target for vaccines and biomarkers. 
Polysaccharides and glycoconjugates present on cell surface of bacteria, fungi, viruses, and para￾sites act as important antigenic targets for vaccine design and development.12
Quimi-Hib® is carbohydrate-based synthetic vaccine used for Haemophilus influenza Hib type 
b, and it consists of synthetic capsular polysaccharide antigen from Hib coupled with carrier protein 
tetanus toxoid (TTox). Glycosyl phosphatidyl inositol based antimalarial vaccines have been devel￾oped. Neisseria meningitides vaccines are available in various brands including Menveo (GSK), 
Menactra® (Sanofi Pasteur), and Nimenirix® (Pfizer). Provenge® sipuleucel-T, an autologous cellular 
immunotherapy, used in the treatment of late-stage prostate cancer vaccine. Vaccination is used to 
prevent pneumococcal disease. Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine PPSV10, PPSV13, PPSV23, 
marketed under various brands Synflorix®, Prevnar13®, and Pneumovax®23, respectively, are used 
in the prevention of infection caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteria.
Typhoid fever is the severe systemic infectious disease caused by S. typhi. Typhoid Vi polysac￾charide vaccine, known as Typhim Vi, was developed by Sanofi pharma to prevent typhoid fever.12,13
Tumor-associated carbohydrate antigen (TACA) is one of the promising targets for the devel￾opment of anticancer vaccines. Carbohydrates alone cannot provoke T-cell-dependent immune 
responses, which are necessary for cancer therapy. TACA linked with carrier protein was used 
to improve immunogenicity. TACA coupled with T-cell peptide multiepitopes form multicompo￾nent glycoconjugate vaccines. GM2 ganglioside (melanoma-specific antigen) can be attached with 
immunostimulant keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) to form an anticancer vaccine.14 Heptavalent 
vaccine consists of seven TACAs: globohexaosylceramide (globo-H), GM2, Lewis-y, MUC1–32 
(mucin 1–32 cancer antigen aa), sTn(c), TF(c), and Tn(c) conjugated with KLH, an immunomodula￾tor. This vaccine possibly encourages the production of IgG and IgM antibodies and an antibody￾dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) against tumors expressing these antigens.15,16
6.3.4 Carbohydrate-Based Anticancer Therapeutics
Glycosylation plays an essential role in cancer malignancy expansion and development. Glycans are 
distinctively expressed on the surface of tumor cells, and these glycans have been targeted for the 
Gentamicin Streptomycin Azithromycin
FIGURE 6.2 Structure of antibiotics.Carbohydrate-Based Therapeutics 113
discovery and development of anticancer therapeutic, diagnostic, and preventive treatments, includ￾ing vaccines magnetic nanoparticles and monoclonal antibodies. Synthetic oligosaccharides have 
been used in the development of therapeutic vaccines for cancer. Peptide and proteins or nucleic 
acid-based therapeutics are the most promising anticancer biopharmaceuticals.17,18
Various clinical studies and attempts of vaccination with carbohydrate-based therapeutics have 
been proven unsuccessful, mostly due to the glycan-associated immune tolerance. However, novel 
monoclonal antibodies are specially designed to identify cancer-bound carbohydrates and provoke 
tumor cell killing. Several carbohydrate-based magnetic nanocomposites and nanoparticles have 
been developed for safe and effective treatment and diagnosis of cancer. These carbohydrate-based 
magnetic nanoparticles show various advantages such as enhanced stability, higher biocompatibil￾ity, and lower toxicity. In various research studies, TACAs, primarily expressed on cancer tissues, 
have been found by National Institutes of Health as significant biomarkers of cancer prognosis and 
for therapeutics design. Several preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated that naturally 
acquired, actively induced, or passively administered antibodies against TACAs are competent to 
remove circulating tumor cells and micro-metastases in cancer patients.18
TACA alone is poorly immunogenic to induce a T-cell dependent immune response, which is 
very essential for cancer therapy. TACAs can be ideal candidates to bring out an antitumor immune 
response; TACAs were used as conjugate with T-cell stimulating protein carriers, like KLH, tetanus 
toxoid (TT), bovine serum albumin (BSA), and diphtheria toxin (CRM197). TACA were coupled 
with various polysaccharides like Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) ligand, zwitterionic polysaccharide 
(PS A1), and T-cell peptide epitopes for the development of fully synthetic, self-adjuvating, multi￾component vaccines for cancer.19
Cancer cells contain a glucose transporters (GLUTs) and lectins on its membrane surface, and 
these can transport and bind carbohydrate moieties, respectively. Increased energy in proliferation 
of cancer cells is satisfied by GLUTs, and these allow for an increased uptake of glucose at a supe￾rior rate than normal cell. This occurrence is commonly referred to as the Warburg effect. Thus 
sugar-based targeted drug delivery have been designed and developed. Several cytotoxic drugs, 
including glufosfamide, chlorambucil, busulfan, docetaxel, and paclitaxel, have been glycoconju￾gated and found to be less toxic to normal cells than the parent aglycons.
Some plasma tumor markers, including prostate-specific antigen (PSA), cancer antigen 125 
(CA125), and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), have been clinically used in United States for diagnosis of 
cancer in early stage. Recently, carbohydrate-based noninvasive diagnosis cancer tools, like lectin 
binding, metabolic oligosaccharide engineering (MOE) imaging technology, and glycan micro￾arrays, have been used for tumor screening.20
Mifamurtide is synthetic immunomodulator used in the treatment for osteosarcoma, a type of 
bone cancer. It is derivative of muramyl dipeptide (MDP). It is naturally occurring immune stimula￾tory component of cell walls found in Mycobacterium species (Figure 6.3).21
Docetaxel Paclitaxel Chlorambucil
FIGURE 6.3 Structure of anticancerous drugs.114 Polysaccharides
6.3.5 Carbohydrate-Based Diagnosis
In many diseases, there is change in the expression of oligosaccharides and glycoproteins. Glycan￾based diagnostic have been developed for various human diseases. Diabetes type I is recognized at 
late stage, after getting autoimmune damage of pancreatic cells. Magnetic resonance imaging can be 
used to detect diabetes type I in early stage. Glycans are involved in various cellular events with sig￾nificant implications for therapeutic purposes. The glycan-based plasmonic sensor were developed 
for prostate cancer diagnosis. Lamarre et al. have developed antibodies against the tumor-associated 
carbohydrate antigen (Tn), or TACA, that develop early in carcinogenesis, making them a remark￾able alternative as a target for prostate cancer diagnostics.22 Carbohydrates are crucial biomolecules 
that can act as markers in the recognition of immune systems. Carbohydrates exhibit antimicro￾bial, antimicrobial, and antifungal properties. Various serum glycoprotein biomarkers, including 
carcino-embryonic antigen (CEA), carbohydrates antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) and 125 (CA125), alpha￾fetoprotein (AFP), and PSA, have been discovered to be useful in the preliminary detection and 
diagnosis of colon, ovarian, and prostate cancers, respectively.23
Specific lectins have been screened as potential carbohydrate tumor biomarkers in the diagnosis 
of cancer. Various lectin proteins, including Artocarpus integrifolia agglutinin (AIA), Amaranthus 
caudatus agglutinin (ACA), Arachis hypogea agglutinin (AHA), Vicia villosa lectin (VVL), 
Artocarpus integrifolia agglutinin (AIA), Grionia simplicifolia agglutinin I (GSA I), and Ulex 
europaeus agglutinin I (UEA I), are able to recognize Tn, TF, and STn alteration of CA125 anti￾gens. Glycan microarray technology can detect antibodies against specific antigens like GOBO-H 
in patients’ blood serum, and this provides glycan protein interaction.
Positron emission tomography (PET) scan can also be used for early detection of cancer, as 
it depends on enhanced concentration of 2-fluoro deoxy glucose concentration in tumor cells. 
Nowadays, metabolic oligosaccharide engineering technology (MOE) have been used for the diag￾nosis of cancer.24
Aridol (mannitol inhalation powder) is a sugar alcohol indicated for diagnosing asthma to assess 
bronchial hyper responsiveness.25 Regadenoson is an adenosine analogue and a coronary vasodila￾tor used in radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) as a diagnostic agent.26
6.3.6 Carbohydrate-Based Antiviral Drugs
Viral pathogens and diseases are one of the most life threatening diseases among human history. 
Around 60% of pandemic diseases are viral diseases, including pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A 
(H5N1) in 2009–2010, Ebola virus in West Africa in 2014–2016, recently happening coronavirus dis￾ease 2019 (COVID-19), etc. Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) is one of the serious viral 
diseases caused by human immunodeficiency virus. Hepatitis liver infection is caused by the hepatitis 
B virus (HBV). Carbohydrate-based drugs give unique advantages in the antiviral drug development. 
Nucleotides and nucleosides affect and disrupt the replication of viral DNA and RNA. Idoxuridine, 
vidarabine, ribavirin, entecavir, telbivudine, clevudine, and sofosbuvir are examples of nucleotide 
or nucleoside antiviral drugs. Entecavir is carbocyclic nucleoside-based antiviral drug developed by 
Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS) pharmaceuticals. It is primarily used in the treatment of HBV and HIV. 
Entecavir is deoxyguanosine triphosphate analogue nucleoside, and it inhibits reverse transcription, 
HBV-DNA polymerase replication, and transcription in the viral replication process. Vidarabine, a 
nucleoside analog, interferes in the synthesis of viral DNA. Telbivudine is l-nucleoside analogue of 
thymidine developed by Idenix and Novartis. It is used in treatment of chronic HBV. It interacts with 
viral polymerase and inhibits viral replication and results in termination of DNA synthesis.27,28
Ribavirin interferes on the synthesis of viral mRNA, and it acts on DNA and RNA viruses. 
It is the only approved nucleoside analogue for the treatment of HCV. Remedesivir, Azvudine, 
Molnupiravir, Carragelose, Peramivir, and Maribavir are the examples of carbohydrate-based 
antiviral drugs.Carbohydrate-Based Therapeutics 115
Remdesivir is an antiviral drug that is a nucleoside analogue developed for the treatment of ebola 
virus. Molnupiravir was found helpful in reducing nasopharyngeal COVID-19 virus and viral RNA, 
with high safety and tolerability.
Zanamivir is the first neuraminidase inhibitor developed by the Australian biotech firm Biota 
Holdings. It is used in the treatment of influenza A and B (Figure 6.4).26–28
6.3.7 Carbohydrate-Based Antidiabetic Agents
Diabetes is metabolic disorder affecting many people across the world. DM Type I is commonly 
treated with insulin replacement therapy, while type II DM is treated with oral hypoglycemic drugs. 
Diabetes mellitus type II is non-insulin-dependent diabetes. If the diabetes is not cured properly, it 
may lead to severe complications.1,2 Diabetes mellitus is a most common chronic metabolic disorder 
characterized by hyperglycemia that results from insulin resistance, or no insulin secretion, or both. 
SGLT II inhibitors reduce reabsorption of glucose, and thereby increase urinary glucose excretion 
by approximately 60–80g per day and improve hyperglycemia. SGLT II inhibitors are the newest 
class of drugs for type 2 diabetes. These reduce the reabsorption of renal-filtered glucose back into 
the bloodstream, thereby leading to increased glucose in the urine. SGLT II inhibitors and carbohy￾drate-based glycosidase inhibitors are major class of antidiabetic. Carbohydrate-based antidiabetic 
drugs can be developed by natural or synthetic process.29,30
6.3.7.1 Carbohydrate-Based Glycosidase Inhibitors
Glycosidase plays an important role in oligosaccharides biosynthesis in cell organelles. Glycosidase 
enzymes are responsible for hydrolysis of glycoside linkages in the digestion of carbohydrates and 
polysaccharides. α-Glycosidase inhibitors lower blood glucose levels by preventing hydrolysis of 
polysaccharide, delaying carbohydrate metabolism. Antidiabetic drugs for the treatment and manage￾ment type II diabetes can be developed using this glycosidase inhibitors mechanism. Carbohydrates 
from diet get converted into simple sugars or monosaccharides by α-glycosidase enzyme at intesti￾nal cell linings, and they get absorbed through intestine. α-Amylase and α-glucosidase enzymes are 
accountable for carbohydrates metabolism.29–32
Thus alpha glycosidase inhibitors prevent carbohydrate digestion and thus reduce blood glu￾cose level. α-Glycosidase inhibitors are classified as irreversible glucosidase inhibitors, reversible 
α-glucosidase inhibitors, and sucrose inhibitors. Acarbose, emiglitate, voglibose, and miglitol are 
reversible α-glucosidase inhibitors of antidiabetic drugs.31,32
6.3.7.2 Carbohydrate-Based Sodium-Glucose Co-Transporter-II (SGLT II) Inhibitors
In the kidney, approximately 180g of glucose is excreted per day in primitive urine through the glo￾merular filtration. Most of the glucose present in the primitive urine is reabsorbed by SGLTII and SGLT 
I present in the proximal tubule, and usually glucose is not excreted in the urine. SGLTII is responsible 
Idoxuridine Vidarabine Telbivudine Remedesivir
FIGURE 6.4 Structure of antiviral drugs.116 Polysaccharides
for the 90% of glucose reabsorbtion. SGLT II inhibitors reduce renal tubular reabsorbtion of glucose 
and thereby increases urinary glucose excretion by approximately 60–80 g per day and controls hyper￾glycemia. SGLT II inhibitors are the newest class of drugs for type II diabetes. These reduce the reab￾sorbtion of renal-filtered glucose back into the bloodstream, thereby increases glucose in the urine.32
Recently, dapagliflozin, canagliflozin, empagliflozin, sotagliflozin, ipragliflozin, tofogliflozin, 
and luseogliflozin are the new class of SGLT II inhibitors.33
Phlorizin, remogliflozin, sergliflozin, and dapagliflozin are initially synthesized O-aryl glu￾copyranosides that act as SGLT II inhibitors. Dapagliflozin was developed by companies BMS 
and AstraZeneca. Empagliflozin was developed by Boehringer Ingelheim and Eli Lilly Company. 
Canagliflozin hemihydrate (CNZ) is the first gliflozin, a selective sodium glucose co-transporter 
(SGLT II) inhibitor approved for the management of type II diabetes under the brand name 
“Invokana” by Janssen pharmaceuticals (Figure 6.5).32,33
6.3.7.3 Other Carbohydrate-Based Antidiabetics
Naturally found, plant-derived flavonoids like rutin and quercetin have potential as hyperglycemic 
agents for the treatment of diabetes.
6.3.8 Carbohydrate-Based Central Nervous System Drugs
Carbohydrates have been proved promising drugs for the treatment of central nervous system 
(CNS) disorders. Carbohydrate-based nanoparticles have been used as noninvasive technique for 
drug delivery to the central nervous system. Sodium oligomannate (GV-971) is an oral oligosaccha￾ride derived from marine algae used in the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). It is developed 
by Shanghai Green Valley Pharmaceuticals. Sodium oligomannate is derived from marine brown 
algae β-d-(1,4)-polymannuranate containing 2–10 sugars. In clinical trial studies, it has been proved 
effective and safe in the treatment of AD. Sugammadex is neuromuscular reversal drug used as 
reversal of neuromuscular blocking agents (NBA). It is novel synthetic ϒ-cyclodextrin molecule 
developed by Merck Sharp & Dohme. It is used in reversal of neuromuscular blockade induced by 
rocuronium bromide and vecuronium bromide in general anesthesia during surgery.34,35 Topiramate 
is monosaccharide d-fructose derivative and carbonic anhydrase inhibitor found naturally. It is used 
in the management of seizures in epilepsy and to prevent migraines.36
6.4 CARBOHYDRATES IN CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES
Digoxin is one of the oldest cardiovascular drugs used for the management of atrial fibrillation and 
the symptoms of heart failure. Digoxin slows heart rate and improves prognosis in patient with heart 
failure. Acetyldigoxin is prodrug of digoxin that shows enhanced absorption, efficacy, and toler￾ance. Methylated derivative of digoxin, medigoxin, shows superior bioavailability.

gratus plants. It is used in the treatment of congestive heart failure. Tribenoside is a glucofuranoside 
derivative, is an anti-inflammatory drug, and reduces vascular permeability and causes vasocon￾striction to treat hemorrhoids.
Cangrelor is a nucleoside analogue and an intravenous, reversibly-binding platelet P2Y12 recep￾tor antagonist. It shows antithrombotic activity and used in the treatment of myocardial infarction.37
Ticagrelor is antiplatelet agents and used in the prevention and treatment of thromboembolism in 
patients with acute coronary syndrome.38
Fondaparinux sodium is synthetic anticoagulant agent consisting of five monomeric sugar units 
and a O-methyl group. It is structurally similar to polymeric glycosaminoglycan heparin, and hepa￾ran sulfate is used as antithrombotic agent. Tinzaparin sodium is a low-molecular-weight heparin 
used in the treatment of deep-vein thromboembolism.39
6.5 CARBOHYDRATES FOR BIOMEDICAL APPLICATIONS
Carbohydrates are abundantly found in nature and have the affinity to form supramolecular 
network, thus polysaccharides or carbohydrate-based natural polymers have found promising 
applications in biomedical field. Carbohydrate polymers like starch, chitosan, cellulose, cyclodex￾trin, alginate, dextran, galactose, and derived polymers can be used for nanocomposites forma￾tion. Nanocomposites have been designed with nanoparticles (metal, metal oxide), nanocarbons 
(carbon nanotube, graphene, graphene oxide), metal, and inorganic nanofillers. It has several 
biomedical applications, including antibacterial, wound healing, inorganic nanofillers, tissue engi￾neering, implants, biosensing, cosmetics, and drug delivery system.40
Chitosan and its derivatives like N,N,N-trimethyl-chitosan, O-carboxymethyl-N,N,N￾trimethyl-chitosan, and N,O-carboxymethyl-chitosan have been used widely for wound heal￾ing in veterinary medicines. Chitosan-based nanocomposites exhibit antibacterial properties.41
Polysaccharides drug conjugate have been used in anticancer drug delivery system. Carbon 
nanocomposites prepared with carbon nanotubes and biopolymers like starch, cellulose, chito￾san have been used in drug delivery. Alginates in the form of hydrogel, nanogel and nanopar￾ticles is used in anticancer drug delivery. Various natural polysaccharides, including alginates, 
cyclodextrin, chitosan, pullulan, hyaluronic acid, guar gum, pectin, dextran, and cellulose, have 
been used in anticancer drug delivery systems.42
Glycosaminoglycans like hyaluronic acid or hyaluronan are extensively found on the mam￾malian cell surface as well as in the extracellular matrix. Therefore, they are widely used in 
biomedical studies as drugs or carriers in drug delivery systems. Fluorescent hyaluronic acid￾iodixanol nanogels were used in targeted X-ray computed tomography (CT) imaging and che￾motherapy.43 Hyaluronic acid-coated chitosan nanoparticles loaded with chemotherapeutic drug 
5-fluorouracil were designed as tumor-targeting drug delivery system. These nanoparticles were 
found to enhance drug accumulation in tumor cells and significantly improve antitumor effi￾ciency (Figure 6.6).44
6.6 CARBOHYDRATES IN GENE THERAPY
In gene therapy, genetic material (DNA, short interfering RNA-siRNA or antisense molecule) 
is introduced into body to replace defective or missing genetic material for the treatment of 
disease or an abnormal medical condition. Gene sequences introduced into cells for gene trans￾fection in the form of plasmid DNA or oligonucleotides, that interfere with common gene 
expression either at the transcriptional level (triplex DNA), or at the translational level (anti￾sense DNA or short-interfering RNA). Viral and nonviral vectors have been typically used 
for gene transfection. Biodegradable nanoparticles and other nanostructures can be used for 
nonviral gene delivery.118 Polysaccharides
Various polysaccharides including chitosan, alginates, pullulan, hyaluronic acid, dextran, 
and their derivatives have been extensively used as polymeric backbones for the development of 
nanoparticles, which can be used as gene delivery carriers. Polysaccharides have been discovered 
in biomedicines as gene delivery carriers.45,46 Nanoparticles, liposomes, hydrogels, matrix, and 
nanoparticles can be fabricated using cyclodextrins, pectins, guar gum for encapsulating oligonu￾cleotides, DNA, and siRNA. Nanoparticle-based polysaccharides are the most important candidates 
of nonviral vectors for gene delivery systems.
Perfect gene delivery system requires an appropriate vector competent to protect and facilitate 
the genes to reach the target cells. Polysaccharide nanoparticles offer safe, efficient, and controllable 
methods for gene delivery.46,47
Chen et al. have formulated nanoparticles decorated with carbohydrate-based targeting polymers 
like mannose, galactose, dextran, galactose, etc. for efficient macrophage-targeted gene therapy. 
Study revealed that carbohydrate-based polymers showed strong entrapment of mRNA and pDNA 
with a higher encapsulation efficiency.48
6.7 OTHER CARBOHYDRATE-BASED THERAPEUTICS AND ADJUVANTS
Xyloglucan (XG) is a polysaccharide obtained from tamarind seeds. It is a natural hemicellulose 
that consists of main chain of glucan backbone with xylose and galactose side chains. Xyloglucan 
exhibits distinct mucoadhesive and gelling properties, and it can be used in drug delivery system.49
Chitin and its derivative chitosan are antibacterial, biocompatible, degradable, and nontoxic bio￾materials. Chitin and chitosan nanofibers are used for promoting bone regeneration and repair￾ing defects. Chitosan has several biomedical applications, including bacterial inhibition, drug 
delivery, and wound healing.50 Nano-carbohydrates have been used for biosensing, cell imaging, 
and screening in genetics, biotechnology, and medicines. Glycosylated gold nanoparticles, gly￾cosylated quantum dots, and self-assembled glyconanoparticles can be used for imaging, thera￾peutics, and biodiagnostic devices.51 Carragelose is sulfated polymer obtained from red seaweed 
(Chondrus crispus). It is an algae-based Iota-carrageenan type polysaccharide drug. Carragelose is 
used as antiviral drug for the treatment of common cold, influenza, and covid-19 disease52 (Table 
6.1, Figures 6.7 and 6.8).

7 Starch-Based Advanced 
Materials and Their 
Applications
Aiswarya P. R. and Sabu Thomas
Mahatma Gandhi University
7.1 INTRODUCTION
Plastic is becoming one of the most dangerous environmental issues, as the production of a new 
variety of plastic products is rapidly increasing day by day. The low degradable behavior of plastic 
is the main reason that makes plastic a harmful material. Therefore, waste plastic disposal became 
a threat to nature and living beings. There is a strong urge to replace conventional non-degradable 
plastic materials with other biopolymer materials, which are easy to degrade. The biopolymer 
industry is advancing since biodegradable plastic is a good solution to environmental problems. 
As biopolymers are also able to offer better properties similar to conventional plastic materials, the 
demand is increasing drastically. Natural polymer materials like starch, cellulose, collagen, lignin, 
etc. are tremendously used for commercial uses. Among them, starch is a promising material for 
a lot of applications due to its renewability, availability, biodegradability, and low cost. In addi￾tion, starch and derivatives of starch provide varieties of properties favorable for advanced material 
applications [1]. Desired properties of materials are obtained by starch modification or coupling 
starch with other polymeric materials. The derivatives of starch include starch processed by dif￾ferent modifications like physical, chemical, or mechanical modifications, starch-based blends and 
composites, and so on [2]. But the degradability of the materials should not be lost because of such 
modification processes and also the additives must not be toxic because there are a lot of edible 
applications such as food packaging and coatings. Because of this reason, natural edible fillers 
and reinforcing agents like natural fibers, starch, cellulose crystals, etc. are to be used in starch￾based materials. The self-reinforcement technique, that is, reinforcing starch with modified starch 
particles, is also widely used by several industries [3]. The main fields where the use of starch and 
starch-based materials was established were electronics, drug delivery, pharmaceuticals, structural 
materials, packaging, etc. [2]
7.2 WHY STARCH IS A PROMISING MATERIAL 
FOR ADVANCED APPLICATIONS
Starch is produced naturally by the polymerization of glucose during photosynthesis in plants. It is a 
source of energy and is mainly used as food. It has a lot of industrial applications due to its different 
desirable properties. It is considered a favorable material for various purposes because of the basic 
advantages of a natural biodegradable material [2]. Also, it has various unique properties such as 
water retention, water dissolution, gelatinization, ease of modification, etc. that make it a promising 
material in the industrial field [1]. On the other hand, some undesirable properties, which reduce the 
extensive use of starch for industrial applications, are the hydrophilic nature, brittleness, retrograda￾tion, and thermal degradation. Therefore, the functional –OH group of starch is modified to mitigate 
that limitations [2]. The basic structure of starch is shown in Figure 7.1.Starch-Based Advanced Materials and Their Applications 125
The structure and composition of starch are responsible for its physical and chemical properties. 
Starch is made up of amylose, a linear glucose chain that has an α-1,4-glucosidase bond, and amy￾lopectin, a branched glucose chain that has branching at the α-1,6-position. The ratio of amylose 
and amylopectin varies in different botanical sources of starch. It is differed mainly due to climate 
conditions, location of cultivation, soil properties, etc. Another component present in starch is phos￾phorous, a non-carbohydrate component that affects its gel strength, lucidity, and solubility depend￾ing on the foreign material with which it bonds [2].
7.3 STARCH-BASED ADVANCED MATERIALS
The hydrophilic nature of starch, brittleness, retrogradation, and thermal degradation has limited 
its extensive use for industrial polymer applications that require mechanical integrity. Extensive use 
of starch is limited to industrial applications which require mechanical integrity. Hydrophilicity, 
brittleness, retrogradation, thermal degradation, etc. are the properties that hinder its mechanical 
strength. It has limited mechanical integrity since it will degrade under relatively low tempera￾tures and cannot be melt-processed. These poor mechanical strengths, thermal stability, and poor 
solubility of starch limited its applications in polymer-based industries. To overcome this crisis, 
starch is subjected to several modifications. Several kinds of research are still being conducted for 
starch modifications. Many studies have relieved that conducting modifications on starch not only 
improves the mechanical properties but also helps to achieve various other functional properties. 
Figure 7.2 shows the evolution of starch-based materials.

7.3.1 Modification of Native Starch
7.3.1.1 Thermo-Plasticization
Starch is not a thermoplastic material; therefore, it should be converted into a thermoplastic so that 
it becomes an ideal material for commercial applications. Therefore, starch is converted into ther￾moplastic with or without shear stress in the presence of plasticizers like water or polyols in the heat 
range 90°C–180°C. Gelatinization of starch is the reason for this conversion. This is an irreversible 
process by which the starch granules lose their crystalline nature. In the process, the amylopectin 
double helix unwinds and amylose gets separated from amylopectin. The crystalline order is lost 
mainly because of the penetration of water into the granules. The poor mechanical and higher 
hydrophilic nature of thermoplastic starch make it unsuitable for applications. To overcome these 
drawbacks, several modifications are conducted. Incorporating reinforcements, chemical modifica￾tions, and blending with other polymers are some of those methods to improve the properties of 
starch-based materials [5].
7.3.1.2 Chemical Modification of Native Starch
Chemical modification of starch is mainly carried out by incorporating functional groups through the 
process of reduction, substitution, or crosslinking [5]. In the substitution method, the hydroxyl groups 
present in the starch chain are changed into acetyl group or similar other groups as per the requirement 
and thus altering the molecular structure of starch. Several researchers reported that esterification of 
starch with organic acids and acid anhydrides improves several properties of starch and is used for 
packaging application [6]. Starch esterification is a nucleophilic substitution process. Commonly used 
organic acids for starch esterification are formic acid, acetic acid, maleic acid, propanoic acid, and 
butanoic acid [5]. Acylated starch prevents retrogradation. Gelatinized starch on cooling the dissoci￾ated amylose chains show a tendency to realign. This reassociating tendency is called retrogradation. 
Thus, during low-temperature storage, trapped water is appeared at the surface of the material and 
may cause other damage. Succinate starches provide properties like low gelatinization temperature, 
the ability to swell in cold water to increase viscosity, and good filming properties [7].
Modification of starch by reduction consists of producing more functional groups hence reac￾tivity increases. Starch modified by reduction or oxidation showed reduced swelling capacity and 
solubility, and showed increased pasting viscosity [8]. By oxidation, the pyranosidic ring structure 
is opened, and reactive functional groups are formed in the framework. Commonly oxidizing agents 
FIGURE 7.2 Evolution of starch-based materials. By García-Guzmán et al. [5] is licensed by CC, reprinted 
from Polysaccharides, MDPI.Starch-Based Advanced Materials and Their Applications 127
used for this technique are hydrogen peroxide, oxygen, ozone, bromine, chromic acid, permanga￾nate, nitrogen dioxide, etc. [7]. Crosslinking is a method of covalently interconnecting linear or 
branched chains, resulting in improved hydrophobicity and structural stability of starch granules. 
Citric acid is an inexpensive and nontoxic crosslinking agent, and it reacts with the hydroxyl group 
in starch and produces intermolecular covalent bonds [9]. Other common crosslinking agents are 
sodium trimetaphosphate (STMP), sodium tripolyphosphate (STPP), epichlorohydrin (ECH), and 
phosphorus chloride (POCl3) [8].
7.3.1.3 Physical Modification of Native Starch
Starch is physically modified by different treatments under the action of heat, pressure, or mechan￾ics, in the dry or wet state, including fractionation. Physical modifications by nonthermal treatment 
are a highly demanding method since the amount of energy required for the process is very less, 
and it is environment friendly. And the enhancement of material properties by these modification 
techniques is very satisfying. It mainly helps to change physical properties, and in some cases, it is 
reported that chemical properties can also be changed. Obtaining chemical changes in starch with￾out using a chemical modification technique is an interesting result. In a work on waxy wheat starch, 
physical properties like gelatinization and crystallinity are influenced by hydrostatic pressure treat￾ments [10]. Research suggested that plasma treatments of starch affected the crosslinking of starch 
molecules and altered the melting temperature. On treating starch films with hexamethyldisiloxane 
(HMDSO) cold plasma, it is reported that chemical changes including substitution and crosslinking 
have occurred. C–OH bonds present in the starch were reduced, and there was an increase C–Si 
bonds, which is a hydrophobic blocking group and resulted in increased barrier property of the film. 
These changes resulted in thermal transitions like melting temperature (Tm) and enthalpy (ΔH) of 
the material. The overall result suggested that high crosslinking and hydrophobic blocking group 
(C–Si) improved the water repellency of the film and enhanced the performance [11]. In pharma￾ceutical industries, pre-gelatinized starch is commonly used to improve its flowability and enhance 
the disintegration and hardness of the starch. Therefore, the amount of pre-gelatinized starch used 
for the production of tablets will be much less than unmodified starch [7]. Starches are mainly used 
as excipients in drug production.
7.3.2 Starch-Based Materials with Filler/Reinforcement
Lignocellulosic fibers as reinforcement are mainly studied to improve TPS properties. Different 
types of organic lignocellulosic fibers are being subjected to this study. Some examples include 
green coconut, hemp, cellulose fibers, sisal, nanofibers, and microfibers from recycled paper, poly￾saccharide-based nanocrystals, and microcrystalline cellulose [7]. Adding lentil flour fiber in ther￾moplastic starch films showed an improved resistant character which is favorable property to use 
as the best packaging material [12]. Similarly, starch-based form composite material is prepared 
using different types of cellulosic fibers such as cellulose, wood pulp fiber, and municipal solid 
waste fiber, which help in enhancing the tensile strength without affecting the foam density of the 
material [13]. Starch-based films filled with cellulose fibers also contributed to an enhancement in 
resistance. This is because of the decrease of starch chain mobility caused by the starch-cellulose 
interaction [14]. Most of the studies concluded that the addition of 2.5%–3.0% of fibers improved 
the mechanical resistance of films [3] because of the formation of the nonhomogeneous structure 
of films, resulting in brittle composites. The differences in processing method and length of fibers 
added to films have an important effect on the mechanical properties. The nature and character￾istics of fibers vary with the difference in processing techniques. Soy-based biocomposite kenaf 
fiber is prepared with extrusion injection molding, compression molding, and injection molding. In 
this study, it is found that the compression molding process is beneficial to both the thermal and 
mechanical properties of the composites [15].128 Polysaccharides
7.3.3 Starch Blends with Biodegradable Polymers
Nature is in high demand of limiting petroleum-based materials. Therefore, it is relevant to find a 
substitute at least for the short term using materials for applications like packaging and disposal. 
Even though starch is a degradable natural material, it is limited to use commercially because of 
its water solubility. Several researchers reported that native starch can be converted into thermo￾plastic starch by plasticization and restructuring. But plasticized starch also shows an unfavorable 
hydrophilic nature. As a solution for this, plasticized starch is blended with another biodegradable 
polymer material and desired properties can be acquired [3]. The blending of polymer is very easy 
and cheap than synthesizing a new macropolymer. But the drawback is the non-miscibility of two 
different polymers due to their unique chemical structures [16]. Starch blending with polymers like 
polycaprolactone (PCL), polylactic acid (PLA), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), poly(butylene adipate￾co-terephthalate) (PBAT), chitosan, etc. is reported in several articles.
7.3.3.1 Polycaprolactone (PCL)
Polycaprolactone is a biodegradable aliphatic polyester. Comparatively, PCL has a low melting point 
(60°C) and thermal transition temperature around −60°C [7]. Researchers worked on PCL as a good 
biodegradable material. But blending thermoplastic starch (TPS) with PCL did not contribute to any 
significant changes in tensile strength and elongation of break. Reports suggested that the mechani￾cal properties of PCL/TPS blends depend on the type of starch used [17]. Using gelatinized starch 
for blending showed some favorable properties in blends like increased fluidity, increased absorp￾tion of water, reduced crystallinity of PCL, and maintained good dispersion of blend. In some cases, 
the mechanical and thermal properties of PCL became worse when blended with starch, mainly due 
to poor dispersion of the two phases [7].
7.3.3.2 Poly(Butylene Adipate-Co-Terephthalate) (PBAT)
PBAT is an aromatic-aliphatic copolyester and biodegradable. The major properties of PBAT are 
similar to polyethylene. But the usage of PBAT is reduced due to its high cost. PBAT/TPS blends 
are studied by using Nisin and EDTA as compatibilizers for active packaging applications and 
reported that the nisin improved the compatibility and smoothness of films, while EDTA increased 
the hydrophilicity and oxygen barrier of films [5]. Another work reported that PBAT/TPS film 
containing 6% sodium benzoate and potassium sorbate extended the shelf-life of packaged food by 
delaying microbial growth [17]. Another work using maleate PBAT and citric acid on PBAT/TPS 
films improved strain at break.
7.3.3.3 Poly(Lactic Acid) (PLA)
Polylactic acid is an aliphatic polyester suitable to use as packaging material, and it is categorized as 
a Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [7]. PLA is 
comparatively a high-cost degradable material, and starch is considered a suitable material to blend 
with PLA to reduce the cost and enhance biodegradation properties. PLA is hydrophobic and TPS 
is hydrophilic, hence the compatibility of the material may be less due to the limited barrier and 
mechanical properties [18]. Recently, several studies have been conducted to improve the compat￾ibility of PLA and TPS [19]. PLA has a wide range of physical properties. Poor mechanical and 
thermal properties of PLA limit its usage in industrial material applications. Stereo-complexation 
introduced a new way to maintain the range of properties of PLA. The results revealed that they 
have favorable properties to be used as biodegradable packaging material [20]. Reduced hydro￾philicity of TPS is shown when TPS is produced from modified graft starches which results in the 
enhancement of compatibility with PLA. Here PLA-gMTPS act as a compatibilizer by reducing the 
surface tension of the TPS phase during blending [7]. But an excess amount of coupling agent will 
act as a plasticizer and will lead to a decrease in the maximum tensile strength. PLA/TPS blends 
were studied with different starch sources. The weight proportion of PLA: TPS is fixed at 50:50, Starch-Based Advanced Materials and Their Applications 129
and two different types of starch, that is, native cassava starch and acetylated starch with different 
polarities of acetylation. Acylated starch blends showed a better melt flow ability, higher storage 
modulus, and thermal stability. By increasing the degree of acetylation, the water barrier proper￾ties of blends also increased. These improved properties made this blend a promising material for 
industrial application [21].
7.3.3.4 Poly (Vinyl Alcohol) (PVA)
PVA is a synthetic polymer commonly used in the textile industry due to its high solubility in water. 
Even though it is a comparatively expensive polymer, it has good chemical resistance and high 
mechanical properties. Disadvantages such as a limited barrier and thermal properties limit its wide 
application ranges. But since it is highly compatible with other materials, it is often mixed with 
other polymers to obtain the desired properties [7]. TPS/PVA films provide high mechanical prop￾erties and low degradation when compared to TPS films. Biodegradable sago starch film is prepared 
and studied using different amounts of silica. An optimal amount of silica provided high tensile 
strength but low elongation at break (2wt%). This study also concluded that increasing amounts 
of silica created a network structure in the plastic film, and it resulted in a higher water resistance 
[22]. Another study reported that adding 25% of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) into bioplastic made from 
cassava starch produced bioplastic with higher tensile strength than the bioplastic without the addi￾tion of PVA. Fifty percent addition of PVA showed a higher decomposition temperature than the 
bioplastic without PVA addition, which is evidence of improved thermal property. When 100% PVA 
is added, elongation is also slightly increased [23].
In some cases, nanofibers were added to improve the hydrophobic nature of the TPS/PVA films. 
Several reports suggest that adding nanofibers or nanoparticles can enhance the water absorption 
of the film. Due to the addition of nanoparticles, aggregations, voids, and cavities are produced in 
the film, thus the morphology of the material becomes imperfect [24]. PVA is a polymer contain￾ing –OH functional group in its backbone. Therefore, the blend synthesized from starch with the 
biodegradable –OH bond in PVOH is highly degradable. Studies conducted on PVOH/starch blends 
suggest that the biodegradability of the material increased with the increase in the amount of starch. 
In addition, these blends are highly polar. They can be easily molded into various shapes since it is 
thermoplastic and water soluble. It is a good material to make films, and due to its thermal stability, 
it can be used as a container. Biodegradable agents like Pseudomonas sp. degrade the starch-PVOH 
material into carbon dioxide and water [1].
7.3.3.5 Chitosan
Chitosan/TS blends are commonly used due to their mechanical properties. Intermolecular hydro￾gen bonding between NH3
+ of the chitosan backbone and OH– of the starch is the reason for the 
mechanical properties of such blends. Using glycerol as a plasticizer reduces the tensile strength, but 
the elongation of break increases due to plasticization. Glycerol increases the interaction between 
starch and chitosan by forming hydrogen bonding, and the mobility of glycerol itself is reduced. 
In addition, the water vapor transmission rate is reduced due to the presence of chitosan, and the 
crystalline structure is depressed due to the presence of starch [25].
7.3.3.6 Others
Starch blends with other polysaccharides show more favorable mechanical and thermal properties 
than the polymers alone. Pectin is a nontoxic complex heteropolysaccharide with a linear backbone 
of α-(1–4)-linked polygalacturonic acid residues and neutral side chain sugars [7]. The galacturonic 
acid can be partially methoxylated or amidated. Unmodified starch/pectin blends can form films 
with mechanical properties like synthetic polymer films. A novel hydrocolloid pectin-starch (30/70) 
films with bioactive extracts are synthesized by crosslinking pectin-starch gels with poly(ethylene 
glycol) diglycidyl ether (PEGDGE). The films obtained had shown an adequate water-uptake 
capability, ranging from 100% to 160%. PEGDGE also inhibits the disintegration of the pectin-130 Polysaccharides
starch films [25]. Another work reported a novel method for synthesizing green hydrogels by the 
crosslinking of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and aliphatic dicarboxylic acid [26].
7.3.4 TPS Blends with Synthetic Polymers
Bio-based products are those which are partially or fully made from renewable resources. The 
materials based on TPS with other synthetic polymers contribute to an increase in the performance 
properties of starch-based materials. In this way, plastic waste can be reused and better quality 
products are obtained [7].
7.3.4.1 Polypropylene (PP)
Polypropylene (PP) is an excellent material for producing TPS blends. It is a linear hydrocarbon 
polymer and one of the most widely used polyolefins produced. PP and TPS are incompatible due to 
their different polarity; TPS is strongly polar, while PP is nonpolar. Therefore, a suitable compatibi￾lizer is used, such as maleic anhydride grafted polypropylene (MA-g-PP), to improve the interfacial 
adhesion of the composite phases. When maleic anhydride is grafted into PP (PP-g-MA), covalent 
bonds are formed with the hydrophilic starch. That is why maleic anhydride is called the most 
acceptable and economical compatibilizer for PP/TPS blends [7]. PP/TPS blends with maleic anhy￾dride as compatibilizers with different concentrations were studied to understand the changes in 
properties of the material in different maleic anhydride concentrations. They revealed that increas￾ing the amount of compatibilizer up to 20wt% improved the mechanical properties, rheological 
behavior, and morphology [27]. Another study on PP/TPS blend with C14, C16, and C18 carboxylic 
acids as compatibilizers concluded that the addition of carboxylic acids proved to be equivalent or 
better compatibilizers when compared to maleic anhydride polypropylene and no compatibilizer. 
Also, the adhesion between both polymer phases was improved and the tensile strength, elongation, 
and impact strength increased with the addition of carboxylic acids [28].
7.3.4.2 Natural Rubber (NR)
TPS films with natural, modified rubbers show interesting behavior. The molecular interactions and 
crosslinking of rubbers with starch or polymers resulted in changes in the mechanical properties 
of the films. In some cases, the addition of rubber improves the tensile strength; however, in other 
cases, it results in a soft material. The influence of glycerol added to the TPS is very important in 
this case. Some reports suggested that a high amount of rubber causes the separation of phases or 
agglomeration in the mix, resulting in a total change in the matrix of materials. Thus, the blend 
becomes brittle. As a result, the properties become worse. Therefore, less amount of rubber is 
favorable in most of the cases. Several reports mentioned that, by using different types of rubber, 
materials with different properties are obtained. For example, the interaction of epoxidized rubber 
is compared with natural rubber and found that epoxidized rubber has shown better interaction [29]. 
Another similar work studied the interaction of chitosan and starch with epoxidized natural rubber. 
They found that the chemical interaction of chitosan with the epoxy groups improved the mechani￾cal properties of the blend [30]. The hydroxyl groups in the three-dimensional network of lignin in 
the rubberwood sawdust interact with starch to act as an interfacial compatibilizer and produce a 
higher tensile strength [31].
7.3.4.3 Polyethylene (PE)
Polyethylene is a simple polymer with a lineal chain backbone that is widely used for different 
industrial applications. Commercially available polyethylenes are of different densities: low (PLD) 
and high (PHD). The PHD has properties like high rigidity and resistance, and the advantages of the 
use of PLD include great flexibility, good resistance to impact, and high resistance at high tempera￾tures. The researchers found that LDP with rice starch showed low compatibility, making it difficult 
to modulate the tensile strength due to the presence of both crystalline and amorphous regions [5].Starch-Based Advanced Materials and Their Applications 131
7.3.4.4 Poly (Vinyl Chloride) (PVC)
PVC is a polymer that is commonly used by various industries for fittings, electrical insulation, 
synthetic plastic products, floor coverings, etc. The strong mechanical and thermal properties, resis￾tance to chemicals, low water absorption, etc. are the properties that made PVC a demanding mate￾rial for commercial applications. Studies revealed that the degradability of PVC can be improved 
by the addition of starch. Starch-based PVC material is easily degraded because of the presence of 
carbon chains, which attract biodegradable agents. Oxidation takes place when the microorganisms 
broke the carbon chain by releasing carbon dioxide and water. After the oxidation, a weak salt prod￾uct with a chlorine atom is formed which is not harmful to the environment [1].
7.3.5 Starch-Based Composite Materials
Better mechanical and functional properties are obtained when inorganic and organic reinforce￾ment is incorporated into the starch matrix. Studies revealed that a very low concentration of 
reinforcement is sufficient for getting desirable properties. Achieving high dispersion, finding 
suitable plasticizers, controlling the interfacial strength of the inorganic reinforcement in the 
biopolymer matrix, etc. are the main challenges faced in the preparation of nanocomposites. 
Therefore, organic cationic compatibilizer is widely used for getting suitable dispersion [3]. 
Water is a plasticizer for starch-based materials. Nowadays, polysaccharide materials at the 
nanoscale are used for improving the mechanical properties of starch-based materials since 
they are edible and compatible. For example, cellulose and starch nanocrystals exhibit improved 
tensile strength and Young’s modulus of starch-based materials. SEM images of starch films 
are represented in Figure 7.3. It clearly showed good compatibility of a starch matrix with both 
crystals because of the same chemical units present in both components (glucose) [32]. SEM 
clearly showed very good compatibility between the starch matrix and the two crystals due to 
the same chemical unit (glucose).
Cellulose crystals provide higher thermal stability, mechanical properties, and better processibil￾ity. On the other hand, starch crystals exhibited higher protection against UV radiation. The starch 
composites prepared using nanocrystals of starch or cellulose are not only biodegradable but also 
edible, making them suitable for use as food packages or coatings [3].
Inorganic reinforcements into starch-based composites include clays (montmorillonite) (MMT) 
and bentonite [33], nano-clay [34], nano-silica (SiO2) [35], and metal oxides [36]. The incorporation 
of bentonite and hectorite clay strengthens the polymeric structure and increases the compatibility 
of starch/PVA blends [31]. Adding nano-SiO2 as a nanofiller to TPS films contributed to better 
tensile strength and Young’s modulus [37]. Adding clay to potato starch/hectorite nanocomposite 
films exhibited enhanced mechanical and biodegradable properties. Clay as the nanofiller in a corn 
starch film showed the highest absorption and best antibacterial properties. In this case, the swelling 
increased with time and decreased with the addition of plasticizer and hectorite clay [38]. Corn starch—
lithium perchlorate (LiClO4)—nano-silica composites exhibited a high-water repellent property. 
FIGURE 7.3 Surface SEM images of the starch film: (a) pure starch film; (b) containing starch crystals; 
(c) containing cellulose crystals. By Amjad Ali et al. [32], reprinted from Composites Part B, Elsevier.132 Polysaccharides
This is due to the network structure formed by nano-silica in the corn starch matrix, which is pre￾venting the water molecules from dissolving. The incorporation of natural mineral fibers like talc 
improves the properties like low water vapor and oxygen permeability, making the material suitable 
for packaging application [12].
7.4 APPLICATIONS OF STARCH-BASED ADVANCED MATERIALS
Overexploitation of natural resources and increased climate changes lead industries to search for 
more environmentally friendly materials. Plastic is used widely by all industries because of its low 
cost of production, its higher versatility, and good barrier properties to water and gas permeability, 
as well as its mechanical and optical properties. But the accumulation of this waste affected the 
natural ecosystem. Therefore, there is high demand for pollution-free approaches in every industry. 
More than 40% of plastic which is produced is used for packaging applications. The packaging 
industry is now looking forward to replacing such non-degradable materials. Biopolymer is the best 
solution to overcome this situation because it has a lot of similar characteristics to synthetic polymer 
materials. It is easily available and has high biocompatibility, and it is nature friendly. In most of the 
reported works, common sources of starch like wheat, rice, potato, corn, etc., are used. But due to 
the increased demand for biodegradable advanced materials, several works included non-conven￾tional starch sources such as pehuen [39], pea, lentil, faba bean [40], chickpea [41], chestnut [42], 
jackfruit seed [43], and avocado seed [44]. As already mentioned, in different botanical sources, the 
properties of starch will be different.
7.4.1 Application in the Food Industry
Food packaging industries are in a crucial stage of replacing non-biodegradable polymer materials 
with sustainable and biodegradable materials. Developing new innovative material which is biode￾gradable and at the same time can preserve food for a long time is challenging. Nowadays, usage of 
bioplastic as packaging materials increased abundantly due to its biodegradability, biocompatibility, 
and low cost of starch-based materials [5].
The development of functional packaging materials mainly focuses on:
i. Improving the materials by mixing different materials like micro/nanostructures so that 
they provide a better barrier to oxygen and water vapor.
ii. Adding bioactive substances like antioxidant or antibacterial agents
Active packaging includes oxygen scavengers to decrease fat oxidation, ethylene scavengers to min￾imize fruit and vegetable ripening, humidity, and odor absorbers [5].
The fish and meat on normal preservation produce a color change and off-odor and flavor. 
The color change is due to the oxidation of fats and leads to the decoloration of pigments like 
myoglobin, carotenoids, etc. Odor and flavor changes occur due to rancidity, resulting from lipid 
oxidation. Nutrients like vitamin E, β-carotene, and ascorbic acid are lost due to oxidization. To 
overcome these limitations, vacuum packaging is used. Even this method is not completely sat￾isfying since it will not fully remove oxygen. Therefore, it became necessary to develop a novel 
packaging material that is highly efficient in preventing oxidation and quality loss. Thus, oxygen 
scavengers were introduced to eliminate residual oxygen. Oxygen scavengers are incorporated 
in sachets, films, or labels, and they prevented food from contamination. It is reported that ther￾moplastic starch films are efficient in controlling lipid oxidation in food [7]. Thermoplastic films 
are prepared by the incorporation of low-density polyethylene and green tea. The work proved 
that the lipid oxidation was significantly reduced due to the hydrophobic nature of films [45]. 
Using antioxidant extracts in the edible cassava starch films showed an improved UV-blocking 
properties (Figure 7.4) [46].Starch-Based Advanced Materials and Their Applications 133
Active packaging deals with improving food safety and quality. Hence, the most importance is 
given to the preparation of packaging materials by using active films having antibacterial, antioxi￾dant, and barrier properties. Smart packaging helps inform the consumer about the kinetic changes, 
which are related to the quality of food or the environment it contains. This is to ensure food qual￾ity and to minimize losses [5]. Smart packaging films based on a change of color are developed by 
adding pH-sensitive and responsive indicators like anthocyanins, betacyanins, curcumin, etc. in the 
biopolymer-based matrix [7]. These materials are prepared by blending with polymers such as PVA, 
PLA, carrageenan, chitosan, etc., and they respond to the magnetic field or have enzyme-responsive 
characteristics. Recently, natural pigments are actively been used as indicators. In a work, blueberry 
residues as a visual pH indicator are added to the corn starch-cellulose matrix to monitor fish spoil￾age. The material exhibited good pH sensitivity and thermal stability [47]. Similarly, cassava starch 
films with anthocyanins showed high pH sensitivity over a wide pH range, and potato starch-based 
films with anthocyanins displayed the color difference at pH 1–12 and helped to the spoilage of pork 
[48]. Starch films with chitosan nanoparticles were studied as a packaging material for cherry toma￾toes, and it is found that the growth of microorganisms was effectively inhibited compared with 
pure starch film. Adding cinnamon oil to the starch matrix also showed reduced microbial growth 
and protected the fruit from further contamination during transport and storage [49]. Tapioca starch 
film with anthocyanin-rich bay laurel berry extracts is synthesized and studied. The color of the 
film is changed from purple to red when it is exposed to hydrogen peroxide gas, and when exposed 
to ammonia, it quickly changed to blue and then became olive [50]. Nutmeg oil, ZnO NP, and ham 
extract are incorporated into starch/PVA films. These films showed pH-sensitive and antibacterial 
properties. Purple extract turned cherry red when pH become acidic, while an alkaline pH changed 
from brownish yellow to light green at neutral pH [51]. Similarly, PVA/starch/propolis/procyanidin 
rosemary extract films exhibited a change in color depending on pH; reddish to blue under acidic 
pH, blue under neutral pH, and yellow under alkaline pH [52].
Starch-based materials are undoubtedly a promising material for food packaging applica￾tions. Even though it is biodegradable and sustainable, drastic production and usage are still not 
FIGURE 7.4 Active and smart starch-based food packaging. By García-Guzmán et al. [5] is licensed under 
CC, reprinted from Polysaccharides, MDPI.134 Polysaccharides
established due to its limited optical properties, barrier resistance, and mechanical properties com￾pared with the conventional non-biodegradable polymeric materials. Studies are active to over￾come such limitations [5].
7.4.2 Pharmaceutical and Biomedical Application
Starch is widely used in the pharmaceutical industry since it has fundamental properties such as 
morphology, particle size, shape, surface area, porosity, density, gelling, viscosity, and its white, 
soft, smooth dryness, etc. Starch is mostly used as excipients [7]. The excipient can be defined as 
a substance other than an active drug or pro-drug that is included in the manufacturing process 
or is contained in finished pharmaceutical dosage forms. It can be categorized as binders, disinte￾grants, and glidants in tablets [2]. Starch became an attractive material in biomedical applications 
because of its availability, abundance, low cost, biodegradability, and biocompatibility. Starch 
can act as a dispersing agent to uniformly distribute the drug particles and bind the particles to 
form loose agglomerates to form compacted tablets for oral ingestion [7]. Starch is also used as 
disintegrants in the drug industry, which helps in the assimilation of the active components of 
the drug into the body. Hydrogen bonds present in the starch molecules with other constituents 
of the tablets bind them together. But in the presence of an aqueous medium (water), the water 
is absorbed and results in the rupture of hydrogen bonding. This results in the loosening of the 
tablet, and it breaks apart, which are then absorbed by the body [2]. Modified starch like pre-gela￾tinized starch is better than native starch for biomedical applications. Due to pre-gelatinization, 
the starch structure is partially opened exposing a greater number of hydroxyl groups and thereby 
forming hydrogen bonds between the other constituents in the tablets [2]. Starch is modified to 
improve flow, disintegration, and direct-compression properties, thereby enhancing the demand 
for starch in industrial applications. Pre-gelatinized starch has excellent wettability, easy disper￾sion in cold water, high viscosity, moisture sorption, and swelling [7].
Commonly in tablets excipients will be at a higher concentration than that of the active drug. 
The role of the excipient is to increase the mass of the pharmaceutical form and dilute the drug. 
Therefore, in such cases, diluents are the excipients, and the diluents must possess enough flow￾through characteristics [7]. Tablets with low crushing strength and fast disintegration can be made 
by using acetylated starch as a binder. Acetylated starch has high granular size, solubility, swelling 
power, and water absorption capacity [7]. Paracetamol-loaded starch-citrate nanoparticles are 
studied with the degree of substitution (DS) ranging from 0.11 to 0.90 and found that they had 
low toxicity and could be promising pH-responsive nanocarriers for targeted drug delivery [53]. 
An important property that is needed for a material used for drug delivery is much-adhesivity. 
It is reported that crosslinked thiolated starch coated magnetite nanoparticles for sustained 
drug release observed enhanced cell viability, mucoadhesive, and drug release properties [54]. 
Hydrogels are three-dimensional polymer networks that have high absorption capacity and can 
be used for drug delivery. The drug is loaded into the porous network, and a controlled release of 
the drug is achieved. Similarly, cross-linked starch can be used as a drug delivery system since it 
can form hydrogels. Starch has a wide range of applications in the pharmaceutical and biomedical 
fields due to its biocompatibility characteristics, low immunogenicity, and versatility of chemical 
and physical modifications. The studies suggested that products synthesized from such biodegrad￾able materials exhibited very less side effects.
7.4.3 Applications of Starch in Water Treatment
Water treatment commonly involves two types of purification: removing undissolved solid con￾taminants and removing the dissolved contaminants. Different kinds of filtration techniques are 
employed successfully to remove solid contaminants. Similarly, there are a lot of well-known 
purification techniques for removing dissolved contaminants. But these techniques involve Starch-Based Advanced Materials and Their Applications 135
various chemicals that are toxic to both humans and the environment. And replacing such tech￾niques with environment-friendly techniques is a major challenge. Starch is an ideal material for 
sustainable application since it is nontoxic, easily available, low cost, and can be easily subjected 
to different modifications. –OH functional groups present on the starch structure can target 
and trap the contaminant particles. Various nanoparticles are also used for decontamination of 
water, and in such cases, starch can act as a dispersing agent or stabilizer due to its ability to be 
soluble even in elevated temperatures or simply because of its gelation characteristics. Better 
dispersion is needed for the efficient decontamination of water [2]. Fe–Pd nanoparticles are 
prepared with and without starch as a dispersing agent for the dichlorination of trichloroethene 
(TCE) hydrocarbon. Morphology is analyzed using transmission electron microscopy and found 
that Fe–Pd nanoparticles without starch were agglomerated and Fe–Pd nanoparticles with starch 
are efficiently dispersed. The dispersion is achieved by the interaction of starch and iron. As a 
result, the dichlorination rate was greater for starch-Fe–Pd than for the particles without the 
stabilization of starch [55].
7.4.4 Application of Starch in Porous Foam Structures
Metal and ceramic foam structures are widely used for applications even at elevated temperatures 
and pressures. These materials are manufactured mainly by the replication method. The polymer 
foam structure is synthesized, and the space in the foam is filled with ceramics and allowed to 
solidify. The porous ceramic structure is obtained by burning the polymer foam. The drawback is 
the porous structure of the ceramic form is dependent on the polymeric foam used for the prepara￾tion. Another method of foam production is agitating a suspension containing ceramic particles 
and a foaming agent. By removing the liquid and sintering, a porous structure is obtained. In this 
method also, there is no any way to control the structure formed by the process. The structure of 
the form is responsible for the properties. Therefore, obtaining desirable property is not possible. In 
addition, dispersing agents and chemicals used for the process are expensive and not nature friendly 
[2]. Starch can be used as a pore former in the production of ceramic and metallic foam structures. 
An optimal quantity of starch is added to the suspension containing ceramic powder and heated 
under constant stirring. Starch granules start to swell by the uptake of water in the suspension. And 
thus, ceramic powder is consolidated into a porous structure. The pore structure and size are also 
dependent on the type of starch used, the size and amount of starch granules, and the rate of swell￾ing of starch granules. The higher the swelling, the larger will be the pore structure, and the higher 
the amount of starch also leads to the increase in pore size. At the desirable size, the starch is burned 
out and the structure is dried out [2].
7.4.5 Application of Starch in Self-Healing Polymeric Materials
Polymer materials that are hard and brittle will catastrophically fail when cracks develop. 
Elastomers can be incorporated into the polymer to stop the further propagation of the crack. 
But studies found that adding this kind of phase affects the mechanical properties like tensile 
and flexural properties of the material. Controlling cracks without diminishing the properties 
became a demand and lead to the development of self-healing polymers [2]. Self-healing poly￾mers contain crosslinked formaldehyde-based microcapsules shells, which are well-dispersed 
within them. The microcapsules are allowed to survive the process of dispersion within the poly￾mer phase without rupture. These microcapsules contain highly reactive liquids (healant), such as 
epoxies, glycidyl methacrylate (GMA), and isocyanates. These liquids readily react with multiple 
reactive functional groups on polymer chains. At the time of the development of cracks, multiple 
microcapsules containing healant are ruptured. The healant flows into the cracks, and cross￾linking takes place by bridging the gap produced due to the crack [2]. Gelatinized waxy maize 136 Polysaccharides
starch (WMS) is loaded with poly(d,l-lactide-coglycolide) microcapsules, and the effect is stud￾ied. Gelatinization of starch activates the –OH functional group of the starch and reacts during 
self-healing crosslinking. The result showed that the healing property increased as the number of 
microcapsules increased [7].
7.4.6 Other Advanced Applications of Starch and Its Derivative Materials
Starch and starch-based materials are used for various applications, such as electronics, photon￾ics, energy, sensors, and super-hydrophobic surfaces. Superhydrophobic films, coatings, and papers 
have attracted tremendous attention in a wide range of sectors. Hydrophobic papers are developed 
by coating two layers of different solutions on the surface of the paper. The first layer is gelatinized 
starch, which contains enzymes, sizing agents, crosslinkers, and aluminum sulfate as pH adjust￾ers, and the second layer was a suspension of hexamethyldisilazane treated silica nanoparticles 
(HMDSSiNPs) in ethanol. The second layer is sprayed immediately after applying the first layer, 
and ethanol is allowed to evaporate. The hydrophobic nature is obtained due to the bonds that 
are created between the two layers. The contact angle analysis revealed that the developed paper 
is super-hydrophobic with a contact angle of 162°. The effect of the starch layer is studied by the 
submersion test. The paper with and without the starch layer is submerged in water for 2 minutes. 
The paper with both layers was dry after 2 minutes, but the paper without starch was wet, and the 
water penetrated through the fibers of the paper. Also, the paper with a starch layer has increased 
mechanical durability. The paper is treated with a very thin layer of materials; therefore, the visual 
appearance of the paper was not affected [3].
Starch has a good optical property and is used for applications in photonics. Due to low oxy￾gen permeability, it is shown to have greater photostability. Gelatinized starch is doped with 
rhodamine 6G water and cast on the glass to form a layer. When it is photoexcited, a random 
lasing effect was observed due to the random formation of starch granules. Compared with other 
biomaterials, starch has exhibited a better photonic property [56]. Starch-based aerogel is an 
advanced biodegradable material with low density and high-specific surface area and is used for 
different potential applications. The procedures for fabricating the aerogel are starch gelatiniza￾tion, retrogradation, organic solvent exchange, and superfacial CO2 drying. The properties of 
aerogels are described by the parameters like density, pore size, surface area, crystallinity, ther￾mal stability and conductivity, mechanical properties, digestibility, etc. These properties of starch 
aerogels are achieved by varying preparation conditions, starch modifications, and the addition of 
other ingredients. Starch aerogels have diverse applications such as encapsulation and controlled 
release of bioactive compounds, packaging applications, tissue engineering, thermal insulation, 
CO2 adsorption, etc. [57].
7.5 CONCLUSION
The real importance of a sustainable and ecofriendly lifestyle will be going to get noticed when this 
life is about to end, and that day, we will be ready to pay any amount to save our life. However, money 
can do nothing and cannot buy life. The advantage of sustainable ecofriendly materials is that they are 
safe for us and future generations too. The use of biodegradable and natural materials can mitigate the 
current environmental and climate issues. Starch gained interest as a natural polymer that is biode￾gradable and easy to modify and blend with other materials to produce desirable properties to be used 
in different industrial applications. By varying the type and degree of modification, the properties of 
the final product can be varied easily. Therefore, starch and its derivatives became a very promising 
material for a lot of applications. Using starch as a self-healing material became a better alternative for 
conventionally used toxic chemical healants. Starch has become a promising material for drug deliv￾ery because of its degradability and biocompatibility. It is also easily available and less expensive. The 
pharmaceutical industry utilizes it as disintegrants, binders, dispersants, and lubricants, making use Starch-Based Advanced Materials and Their Applications 137
of its properties like bendability and gel-ability. Similarly, various fields are utilizing their favorable 
properties for numerous potential applications. Even though starch is at the forefront of sustainable 
materials, its competitive use as food is a limitation for extensive use in commodity applications. Even 
though, more areas of application of starch and derivatives are still in research.

8.1 INTRODUCTION
Polysaccharides are widely distributed throughout the biosphere, serving a variety of essential functions 
in human lives, including energy storage and structural materials [1]. Cellulose, lignin, hemicellulose, 
pectin, chitin, and keratin are earth's most abundant organic polymers [2,3]. Chitin, on the other hand, 
has a far a smaller number of uses than cellulose. This is caused by a different factor, including the 
scarcity of natural chitin structures that may be employed with little processing and the polysaccha￾ride’s poor solubility qualities. As a result, most of the obtained chitin undergoes substantial alkaline 
deacetylation to yield chitosan. Indeed, this kind of polysaccharide is a combination of β(1→4)N-acetyl￾d-glucosamine with d-glucosamine connected units [4]. Because of essential aspects like biodegrad￾ability and biocompatibility, as well as its mucoadhesive and harmless character, chitosan owns a huge 
interest from a variety of applications fields for example the food industry, pharmacy, biotechnology, 
and biomedicine [5].
Natural polymer modification is a recurring topic in materials research that led to the formation of 
new derivatives with distinct properties. Polysaccharide modification can be done in a variety of ways. 
Chitosan is susceptible to chemical modifications at free amino groups from deacetylated units at C2, 
as well as hydroxyl groups (–OH) at C3 and C6 [6]. Chitosan has restricted applicability because of 
its poor solubility in most organic solvents. In fact, the backbone of chitosan should have a molecular 
modification to expand its range of applications. The inclusion of functional groups in the molecular 
structure enables various modification approaches [7]. After chemical modification, physical connec￾tions (inorganic composites and polyelectrolyte complexes), and other different approaches such as the 
utilization of avidin-biotin interaction, it appears to have a lot of potential applications, especially in 
the biomedical industry. Biocompatibility, biodegradability, antimicrobial ability, anticancer capacity, 
wound-healing ability, planned drug delivery, gene therapeutic, biosensing capacity, anticoagulation 
capacity, and many other intrinsic properties of chitosan have drawn a lot of attention to it for use as 
a scaffold material in tissue engineering, membranes, nanoparticles, and many other applications [8]. 
Apart from the optimism and reputation it has in the medical field, it is also being researched in other 
industrial fields like pulp and paper, cosmetics, and water purification [9].
8.2 PROCESSING OF CHITOSAN
Crab and shrimp shells are the most common sources of chitosan. This polymer is acid-treated 
and then alkaline-treated in industrial processing to eliminate calcium carbonates and proteins, 
respectively. To remove pigments and other contaminants, decolorization and purifying processes 
are sometimes added to the process. Decalcification or demineralization is the procedure of calcium 
carbonate elimination, whereas deproteinization is the procedure of proteins removing [10]. Using Chitin and Chitosan Derivatives to Proffer New Functional Materials 141
different several such as sodium hypochlorite, hydrogen peroxide, and acetone, the decolorization 
procedure primarily removes pigments such astaxanthin and β-carotene [7]. Deacetylation is com￾monly used to produce chitosan from chitin (Figure 8.1). Chitin can be converted into its deacetylated 
form, chitosan, or even partially fragmented by the demineralization processing in an acidic environ￾ment. Among the used acids, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, formic acid, acetic acid, and especially dilute 
hydrochloric acid are preferred. After that, the material is filtered and rinsed before being dried 
overnight. Afterward, the dried material is alkaline treated with a dilute NaOH solution in order 
to perform a deproteinization process. Then, the material is washed to eliminate surplus quantities 
of utilized NaOH and dried to produce chitin. To produce the chitosan, the resultant chitin is then 
deacetylated by removing the acetyl groups. In the existence of a solution of concentrated sodium 
hydroxide (NaOH), this reaction occurs at an elevated temperature. The purification stage is then 
carried out to bring the chitosan to neutrality and remove any impurities, resulting in the desired 
chitosan.
Usually, the chitin and the chitosan isolation method can be divided into two classifications: 
the chemical and the biological extraction techniques. Indeed, the chemical technique has several 
disadvantages: it is not an environmentally friendly process as it involves the use of harmful acids 
and powerful bases. The other standpoint is that the mineral and protein that have been solubilized 
cannot be utilized as nutrition. That is why, in recent years, biological techniques have gotten a lot 
of attention. For the demineralization and deproteinization phases, this biological technique uses 
lactic acid-producing bacteria and bacterial proteases, respectively. In an enzymatic approach, chi￾tin deacetylase is utilized to deacetylate chitin [11].
Several published papers contain precise research on the chitin and chitosan isolation that exist in 
various sources using those isolation techniques. Narguess et al. report the extraction of chitin and 
chitosan that exists in a variety of Egyptian insects. Demineralization was performed via HCl solution 
(1.0 M), and proteins were removed using an alkaline treatment via sodium hydroxide solution (1.0 
M) at 100°C for 8hours. The chitin was treated with 50% NaOH for 8hours at 100°C [12]. Further, 
Haripriya et al. report demineralization and deproteinization processes in the manufacture of chitin 
and chitosan that exists in Penaeus monodon shrimp waste with HCl solution (1.0 M) and NaOH aque￾ous solution (3.0 M) over 75 minutes at lab temperature. The deacetylation of chitin was performed 
at 90°C over 50 minutes using a 50% sodium hydroxide solution in a 1:50 ratio [13]. Another paper 
reported that the shell of Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, was processed via HCl aqueous solution 
(1.7 M) at room temperature over 6hours and subsequently via NaOH aqueous solution (2.5 M) at 
70°C over 60 minutes. Using 1% potassium permanganate, the pigments were removed [14].
However, several studies reported the utilization of the biological method to extract the chitin and 
the chitosan. Fatemeh et al. report a biological approach for extracting chitosan from prawn waste. 
The lactic acid fermentation approach, which resulted in demineralization and deproteinization 
of prawn waste, was applied for 4 and 6 days using Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria. Then, the 
extracted chitin was treated with 50% sodium hydroxide for chemical deacetylation [15]. In other 
study, and using improved enzymatic deproteinization, Islem et al. produce chitin and chitosan from 
shrimp shells. Proteases were used to deproteinize the shrimp wastes at 60°C for 6hours, utilizing 
couple enzymes, the Bromelain with the Alcalase. After that, the chitin was mixed with a NaOH 
aqueous solution (12.5 M) solution and heated to 140°C for 4hours [16].

8.3 CHITOSAN MODIFICATIONS FOR NEW FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
As previously noted, chitosan has several unique features that make it a viable option for a variety 
of applications; nevertheless, because it is insoluble in most usual solvents, it is anticipated to give 
much-reduced efficiency in such fields. The unaltered forms of chitosan, on the other hand, encom￾pass most commercial uses. Many other types of modified chitosan are presently in use, and many 
more are being investigated. This modified chitosan was created utilizing self-assembly, sol-gel 
process, ultrasonication, and microcontact printing, among other ways or procedures.
Ionic gelation, micro emulsion, and spray drying procedures have all been used to produce chi￾tosan nanocarriers; however, molecular self-assembly is the most advantageous since it provides the 
needed functional group’s organized molecular structure without requiring any additional modifica￾tions. There are two types of self-assembly methods [17]:
• Mono-component systems: where only the chitosan molecules are engaged in self-assembly;
• Multicomponent systems: where other compounds, as well as chitosan, can be involved.
Hydrogen bonding, ionic bonds [18], hydrophobic interaction [18], and van der Waals contact of 
molecules have all had a positive impact on molecular self-assembly [17]. The composite impact of 
such forces becoming the self-assembly leading power. The self-assembly process was used to make 
a bio-nanocomposite film based on chitosan with montmorillonite hybrid blocks. Another promi￾nent approach for modifying chitosan is sol-gel. New composite macroporous scaffolds were gener￾ated by combining a polymer solution with bioactive glazier in the presence of a sol-gel precursor 
solution. Sol-gel procedures were applied to examine bioartificial polymeric hybrids by combining 
PVA solution and chitosan with bioactive glazier reagents [19]. Despite this, the resulting hybrid 
displayed superior mechanical, morphological, and cell survival characteristics. Another study 
employed gelation techniques to embed chopped silk fibers and electrospun silk fibers in chitosan/
glycerophosphate to generate hyaline cartilage regeneration scaffolds [20]. The sol-gel approach 
was also used for vanadium, molybdenum, and chromium oxonions adsorb from aqueous solution 
using chitosan and silica nanocomposites [21].
A membrane of chitosan was created using the phase inversion technique of immersion-pre￾cipitation as a possible wound dressing. Herein, an acetic acid solution (0.5wt%) was applied as 
the solvent, where NaOH (2wt%)-Na2CO3 (0.05wt%) solution was applied as the non-solvent. A 
casting procedure was used to complete the preparation. Pervaporation at 50°C for 10–15 minutes 
was applied to adapt the thickness of the skin surface and the porosity of the sponge-like sublayer. 
This asymmetric membrane has good antibacterial activity, as well as oxygen permeation and fluid 
drainage capabilities. Controlling evaporative water loss is also a benefit of this membrane. The 
porous cellular structure owned by the membrane is due to this chitosan modification process [22].
Microcontact printing [23] is a method for making nanostructured macromolecules including 
dendrimers, conducting polymers, and peptides. This method of modification, on the other hand, 
applied in conjunction with others to produce nanofibers in a wide variety of sizes. Nanofibers pro￾duction has recently drawn attention to the mechanical treatment technique of modification [24].
8.4 APPLICATION FIELD
Food packaging, antibacterial wound healing, tissue engineering, medication release, water treat￾ment, and bleeding control are just a few of the uses for chitin and chitosan in the industrial and 
medical industries.
8.4.1 Chitin and Chitosan Functional Materials in Food Packaging Activities
Since chitosan films and coatings are bioactive, biodegradable, and biocompatible, they have 
been intensively explored for food preservation in recent decades. However, in order to be mass Chitin and Chitosan Derivatives to Proffer New Functional Materials 143
manufactured at a cheap cost, it is importance to improve their thermal, mechanical, and water bar￾rier properties [25]. Several studies have proven chitosan films’ mechanical, thermal, and barrier 
characteristics, allowing them to be utilized for dry food packing. Furthermore, these materials’ 
functional features, like their excellent antibacterial and antioxidant abilities, have led to their identi￾fication as viable synthetic polymer alternatives in the food industry [26]. Further, in comparison to 
chitosan standalone films, chitosan blends with other polysaccharides, like pectin, starch, cellulose, 
and alginate [27–29], microbial polysaccharides [30,31] and proteins, such as gelatin [31] and whey 
proteins [32], have shown improvements in mechanical characteristics, greater moisture permeabil￾ity, and start to become more and more water insoluble. This is attributed to electrostatic interactions 
of chitosan’s protonated amino groups with the side-chain groups in the other polymer that had a 
negative charge in the specific pH [27,33]. Several papers noted challenges in the full dissolution at 
least with one of the used polymers under specified settings and the creation of highly insoluble com￾pounds within polymers during the manufacturing of blends. This restriction can be solved by bilayer 
systems, which have greater water vapor barrier characteristics than mixed films [31,34].
Indeed, incorporating nanoscale fillers (e.g., nanocellulose) into films made of chitosan, which 
could create an interaction with polymeric chains, is one method for addressing the hydrophilic 
nature of chitosan’s inherent problems, such as inadequate water resistivity, low barrier, and 
mechanical characteristics [35,36]. Because of their great compatibility with chitosan, cellu￾lose nanofibers (CNFs) and nanocrystalline cellulose (NCCs) are attractive reinforcements for 
chitosan in order to create ecofriendly biofilms with desired characteristics. The strong contact 
between chitosan molecules and nanocellulose with significant length-to-diameter ratios, caused 
by electrostatic association and hydrogen bonding, results in the construction of an interactive 
network structure, which increases the crystallinity of the films [37,38]. As a result, chitosan/
nanocellulose composites offer a huge range of potential applications [39,40]. Further, nano￾crystalline cellulose has been employed as a reinforcing component for chitosan-guar gum [41], 
gelatin-chitosan, and starch-chitosan biocomposites [42]. In the previous studies, a translucent, 
heat-resistant biopolymer-based nanocomposite with improved mechanical and barrier character￾istics was created. That new group of risk-free, harmless, sustainable, and ecofriendly chitosan/
nanocellulose films could be replacing petroleum-based polymers as a food packaging material.
Currently, the discovery of active biocompounds that give superior antibacterial and antioxidant 
capabilities to edible films is now the focus of scientific study in the chitosan active packaging field 
[43–45]. Furthermore, more research has been published to see how the addition of those chemicals 
impacts the film’s mechanical characteristics [46–48]. Currently, films are exposed to various food 
matrices to examine their effect on the food’s organoleptic properties depending on the time [36,49–51]. 
Lekjing et al. [51] investigated the impacts of chitosan/clove oil on the lifetime and properties of 
cooked pork sausages. They found that the association of those two ingredients limited microbe 
expansion, slowed the oxidation of fatty acid, and extended the lifetime of cooked pork sausages by 
more than 6days. However, at the outset of the storage period, there were some detrimental effects 
on odor and taste qualities. In comparable studies, adding ginger and rosemary essential oils to 
poultry flesh decreased the oxidation progresses [36]. Souza et al. [49] improved that chitosan films 
with rosemary showed great antimicrobial behavior versus Bacillus cereus (decrease of 7.2 log) 
and Salmonella enterica in in vitro studies (decrease of 5.3 log). In summary, bioactive compounds 
combined in chitosan films have shown excellent promise in elongating lifetime and preserving 
food property, as well as reducing postharvest fungus and foodborne bacteria in the food chain.
8.4.2 Chitin and Chitosan Functional Materials in Wound Healing Activities
Polymers are frequently applied in the form of a film or an ointment. When exposed to UV light, a 
chitosan derivative forms a hydrogel, which has lately been presented as a soft tissue biological glue. 
Usually, hydrogel efficiently protects a wound by securely attaching two parts of skin together to speed￾up healing and closure. Silver sulfadiazine was used in the developed bilayer chitosan wound dressing 
to help reduce wound infection. It should both heal and preserve the wound from bacterial infection to 144 Polysaccharides
be an effective dressing. Various chitosan-based polymers have been employed in this purpose because 
they recover without leaving scars. Chitooligomers appear to be involved in improved collagen fibril 
integration into the extracellular matrix, and they improve vascularization. In comparison to alternative 
material dressings, chitosan hydrogels had the ability to deliver therapeutic payloads to the desired area.
In a model of corneal alkali burn wound for rabbit, a combination processing of corneal epithelial 
cells/carboxymethyl chitosan/gelatin/hyaluronic acid blended membranes improved corneal wound 
healing and restored normal structure, paving the way for the investigation of a novel approach to 
corneal epithelial reconstruction and treatment via tissue engineering techniques [52]. In an in vitro 
model, Kratz and others studied the impact of heparin/chitosan biocomposite on the energizing of 
wound re-epithelialization on human skin. The outcome was considerable; however, the efficacy 
solely depends on the heparin concentration in the heparin-chitosan gel [53]. In the UV-irradiation 
presence, Ishihara et al. employed photocross-linkable chitosan hydrogel and discovered that full￾thickness wound healing was accelerated [54]. Obara et al. enhanced it further by incorporating 
fibroblast growth factor-2 to have a faster healing procedure [55].
8.4.3 Chitin and Chitosan Functional Materials in Water Treatment Process
Many organic contaminants have been discovered in a variety of water sources, and industrial effluents 
are outflows from several industries. Pesticides, biphenyls, hydrocarbons, phenols, fertilizers, plasticiz￾ers, oils, detergents, greases, medicines, and other chemicals are among them [56]. As a result, indus￾trial wastewater is a severe environmental issue. When spilled into rivers and lakes, it poses a threat to 
water quality. In addition, organic and inorganic impurities are thoroughly eliminated to achieve ever￾higher environmental quality standards. The use of nontoxic biodegradable biopolymers like chitin and 
chitosan in wastewater treatment is becoming more widely recognized [57]. They can aggregate and 
precipitate at neutral or alkaline pH due to their polycationic characteristics. Furthermore, the lengthy 
polymer chain may make it easier for the polymer to contact the polluted medium [58]. Chitosan can 
be employed as an excellent adsorbent material for wastewater contaminants’ removal because of its 
backbone’s amino (–NH2) and hydroxyl (–OH) groups. As a result, chitosan has a substantial advantage 
over the other polysaccharides (such as starch or cellulose), where its chemical structure permits it spe￾cial changes to build biocomposites for specific applications. The reactive groups can create composites 
with a variety of chemicals. Kaolinite, bentonite, oil palm ash, magnetite, montmorillonite, zeolites, 
polyurethane, and other adsorbents have lower absorbed wastewater contaminants and withstand an 
acidic condition than chitosan. Instead, the cationic charge present in chitosan can neutralize and floc￾culate anionic suspended colloidal particles in wastewaters, lowering chemical oxygen demand, chlo￾rides, and turbidity [85]. Chitosan could regenerate, and its environmentally benign character permits it 
to be used in adsorption processes [59]. Chitosan is applied as a coagulant/flocculant for contaminated 
wastewaters, in heavy metal or metalloid adsorption (Cu(II), Cd(II), Pb(II), Fe(III), Zn(II), Cr(III)), 
and for the elimination of dyes from industrial wastewater, as well as organic pollutants like organic 
oxidized, organochloride pesticides, or fatty and oil pollutants.
Activated carbon was made from the empty fruit bunch of an oil palm and employed as a filler 
in the fabrication of a PEG diglycidyl ether crosslinked chitosan/activated carbon composite films. 
Because of the strong adherence between the matrix and filler, the film had a high adsorption poten￾tial for Cd+2 [60]. In fact, chitosan films enhanced with cellulose extracted from oil palm empty 
fruit bunch were properly manufactured with an improvement in the mechanical properties. This 
improvement is attributed to the hydrogen bonds formed between chitosan and cellulose particles in 
the composite film, leading to an excellent adhesiveness of the matrix-filler interface and a homo￾geneous structure of biocomposite film. Cadmium ions were removed from aqueous solutions using 
this technique. The chitosan/cellulose biocomposites film holds a lot of promise as an affordable, 
high-performance adsorbent for removing Cd2+ that exists in water [37]. Hydroxysodalite/chitosan 
biocomposites are produced from aluminum waste using a hydrothermal process and successfully 
used to remove Ni(II) and Pb(II) ions from contaminated water [61]. Table 8.1 represents the recent 
applications and properties for chitin and chitosan derivatives to proffer new functional materials.145 Chitin and Chitosan Derivatives to Proffer New Functional Materials TABLE 8.1 Recent Applications and Properties of Chitin and Chitosan Derivatives Form Schematic Representation Applications Properties Ref

8.5 CONCLUSION
Chitosan, because of its inherent properties, could be used in a several industries field, in particu￾lar biomedical industry, water treatment, pulp, paper, and so on. Nevertheless, chitosan has some 
constraints as well. In recent years, the modification of chitosan’s structure has gained much more 
attention. Several methods of modifying chitosan have been discussed in this chapter. In addition to 
its use in different biomedical fields, chitosan has properties that make it a promising biomaterial. 
There is hope and conviction that it will become a highly valuable biomaterial in the future, and the 
numerous supplies and distinctive features point in that direction.

9 Glucans
Safe-by-Design and Applications

9.1 INTRODUCTION
Glucans are the most common polysaccharides found in nature. There is a wide range of molecu￾lar weight and configuration depending on the source, which is made up of more than ten distinct 
forms of monosaccharides linked by glycosidic bonds and is found in many organisms [1–4]. 
It is known as a bioactive glucan or biological response modifier because it can promote body 
health, control cell differentiation, regulate cell growth and senescence, and participate in cell 
recognition, cell metabolism, embryonic development, viral infection, immune response, and 
other life activities (BRM) The chemical structure of glucan determines its biological activity; 
glucans are identified by the presence of side chains attached to the backbone and emanating 
outward like tree branches [5]. The side chains’ frequency and nature strongly influence the glu￾can’s ability to help facilitate binding to surface receptors on target cells, thereby influencing the 
glucan’s effectiveness as an immunostimulant. As a result, research into the ultrastructure-activ￾ity relationship of glucan can provide theoretical guidance for screening biological activities. 
Active glucans have a high safety profile, few side effects, a good curative effect, and a diverse 
source. They function in immune regulation, antitumor, antivirus, antioxidation, and other ways. 
Natural glucans and synthetic glucans are the two types of general glucans, whereas natural 
active glucans are found in animals, plants, and microorganisms. Lentinan and Ganoderma 
lucidum glucan, for example, were frequently used for antineoplastic treatment [5]. β-Glucans 
are naturally occurring polysaccharides. These glucose polymers are constituents of the cell 
wall of certain pathogenic bacteria and fungi. The healing and immune-stimulating properties 
of mushrooms have been known for thousands of years in Eastern countries. These mushrooms 
contain biologically active polysaccharides that mostly belong to the group of β-glucans. These 
substances increase host immune defense by activating the complement system, enhancing mac￾rophages and natural killer cell function [6].
9.2 SOURCES OF ACTIVE GLUCAN
Active glucans come from a wide range of sources, mainly including fungal glucans, marine 
biological glucans, and plant glucans. Fungal glucans are active glucans isolated from myce￾lia, fruiting bodies, and fermentation broth of fungi. According to different sources, marine 
biological glucans can be divided into seaweed glucans, marine animal glucans, and marine 
microbial glucans. Plant glucans can be divided into intracellular glucans, cell wall glucans, 
and extracellular glucans according to their existing positions. Lentinan, Coriolus versicolor
glucan, schizophyllan, and polyporus glucan have been used clinically, and fungal glucan health 
products such as lentinan tablets, Hericium erinaceus glucan tablets, and Ganoderma lucidum
glucan tablets have also been put on the market. Common main active glucans and sources were 
shown in Table 9.1 [7].156 Polysaccharides
9.3 STRUCTURAL ACTIVITY OF GLUCAN
Different types of glucans have different structural units, and their biological activities are very 
different. This is because the structural units largely determine the biological activities of glucans. 
The first one is glucan, which is the basic structural unit of many biological glucans in nature, 
including animals, plants, and microorganisms. Among glucans, glucan is the most important struc￾tural unit, for example, lentinan glucan, schizophyllum glucan, Grifola frondosa mycelium glucan, 
Ganoderma lucidum glucan, Poria glucan, etc [8]. The relationship between the primary structure 
and higher structure of glucan and its biological activity is called the structure-activity relationship 
of glucan [9]. It shows that the structure of glucan is an important factor that affects the expression 
of its biological activities. At present, the most important thing is to study the structure-activity 
relationships of glucans from the following aspects: monosaccharide composition, category of gly￾cosidic bond, branch chain position, spatial configuration, substituent type, number, etc. In addition, 
glucans also have physical and chemical properties, such as relative molecular weight, viscosity, sol￾ubility, and so on, which can also affect the biological activities of glucans. The primary structure 
of glucan includes monosaccharide composition, connection mode, category of glycosidic bond, 
branching degree, etc. Various factors have different effects on the activities of glucans according to 
the influence of various factors on biological activities, the order is as follows: main chain structure 
(category of glycosidic bond, monosaccharide connection mode)>branching degree (presence or 
absence of branching)>monosaccharide composition (types of monosaccharide in homoglucan or 
heteroglucan) [10]. Glucans composed of other kinds of sugar units also have effects on their bio￾logical activities. For example, the main chain of tremella glucan is to use mannan as a sugar unit 
linked by α-(13)-glycosidic bond. Studies have found that tremella glucan has immunoregulatory, 
antithrombotic, anticoagulant, antitumor, and other functions. Mannan obtained from yeast cell 
walls could inhibit mutation of human cells and had an antioxidant effect. The galactomannan and 
arabinogalactan were the main insoluble glucans in waste coffee grounds, accounting for 24%–39% 
of their dry weight. The glucan consists of a linear β-(1–4)-linked mannan backbone connected to 
a galactose at O-6 by a (1–6)-glycosidic bond [11]. Based on these characteristics, galactomannan 
could be used as an additive in foods, infant milk powder, etc. The chemical structure of active 
glucan is the basis of its biological activity. The structure-activity relationships of glucans refer to 
the relationship between the primary and advanced structures of glucans as shown in the Figure 9.1.
9.4 EFFECT OF GLYCOSIDIC BONDING
Glycosidic bond refers to the acetal or ketal bond formed between the semiacetal group of one 
sugar and the hydroxyl group, amine, or mercapto group (such as alcohol, sugar, purine, or 
pyrimidine) of another molecule. Common glycosidic bonds are the N-glycosidic bond and the 
O-glycosidic bond. However, the connection between the glycosyl group and glycosyl group in 
glucan is called the glycosidic bond. Different types of glycosidic bonds have different biologi￾cal activities. For example, the main chain sugar unit of lentinan and amylose is glucan, but their 
biological activities are quite different. The reason is that the former has a (1→3)-glycosidic bond, 
which has strong antitumor activity, while the latter is linked with a (1→4)-glycosidic bond and 
TABLE 9.1
Common Main Active Glucans and Sources
Active Glucan Source 
Fungal glucan Mushrooms, black fungus, marine shiitake mushrooms, etc.
Plant glucan Chinese wolfberry, pumpkin, Astragalus, Aloe vera, jujube, tea, achyranthes root, kiwi fruit, etc.
Marine glucan Spirulina, brown algae, marine algae, such as Porphyridium, crustaceans, fish, shellfish, etc.Glucans 157
has no biological activity, which indicates that the type of glycosidic bond also affects the biologi￾cal activity of glucan [12].
The glycosidic bond type of glucan with strong biological activity is (1→3)-glycosidic bond, 
such as lentinan, Ganoderma glucan of Polygonatum, etc. β-(1→3)-Linked glucan had a strong 
inhibitory effect on S180 and a strong antitumor effect. For example, anticoagulant glucan is a 
homogeneous glucan with (1→3)-glucan as the main chain; lichen glucan is a mixed glucan com￾posed of 66% (1→4)-glucan and 33% (1→3)-glucan. Under the same substitution conditions, the 
inhibition rate of anticoagulant glucan derivatives to tumor cells was much higher than that of 
lichen glucan derivatives [13].
9.5 EFFECT OF MAIN CHAIN CONFIGURATION
The activity of glucan is not only affected by the sugar unit and glycosidic bond but also affected by 
the configuration of the main chain. If the configuration was different, its biological activity might be 
completely different. Most glucans with antitumor activity have the main chain structure of β-(1→3)-
D-glucan, while glucans with α-glucan as the main chain structure generally have no antitumor activ￾ity, such as active glucans in edible and medicinal bacteria, lentinan, polyporus glucan, and so on. 
The main chain structure of the antitumor active component in the glucan was β-(1→3)-D-glucan [2].
9.6 EFFECT OF SUBSTITUTION DEGREE, LENGTH, 
AND POSITION OF BRANCH
Through the analysis of these glucans with antitumor activity, it is found that their structures 
contain water-soluble D-glucan, and most of them are straight-chain glucans without extra-long 
branch chains. Therefore, the length and shape of the branch chain may affect the antitumor activ￾ity of glucans. For example, although the main chain structure of Bachman is β-(1→3)-D-glucan, 
FIGURE 9.1 Structure-activity relationships of glucans.158 Polysaccharides
each β-(1→5)-bonded glucosyl branch chain of Bachman is separated from 1 to 2 β-(1→6)-bonded 
glucosyl groups. Therefore, Bachman has no antitumor activity due to its long branched chain, but its 
main chain structure indicates that Bachman has an antitumor effect and immunomodulatory ability. 
So, we need to modify its structure to make full use of its characteristics and reduce its branch chain 
length, so it can have antitumor activity. Some studies have found that controlled oxidative hydrolysis 
can effectively reduce the branch chain length of Bachman, thus making it biologically active. The 
antitumor activity of branched glucan is negatively correlated with the degree of branching, that is to 
say, the biological activity of glucan decreases with the increase of the degree of branching. When the 
degree of branching exceeded four sugar units, the glucan lost its biological activity [14].
The excessive substitution will lead to a reduction of hydroxyl groups in glucans and poor water 
solubility, but water solubility is a prerequisite for glucans to exert their biological activities. For 
example, the level of sulfate affects the activity. Heparin had the best activity when each sugar resi￾due contained 1.5–2.0 sulfates. When the sulfated glucan contained one sulfate group per hexose 
unit, it had the strongest inhibitory effect on the herpes simplex virus. The fungal pestalotan, which 
was a highly branched glucan, had a DS as high as 2.8, but the biological activity at this time was 
relatively low. The tumor inhibition rate in rats was only 57% [15].
9.7 EFFECT OF RELATIVE MOLECULAR WEIGHT
The biological activity of glucan is affected by molecular weight. If the relative molecular weight 
is too large, the glucan is not conducive to cross-membrane transport, thus affecting the biological 
activity of glucan. However, the relative molecular weight is too small to form a bioactive glucan 
structure. Glucan with a relative molecular weight of 90,000 had certain biological activity, and its 
activity decreased quickly when the relative molecular weight was greater than or less than 90,000 
[16]. Heparin had the best anticoagulant activity when its relative molecular weight was from 4,000 to 
12,000. Only glucans with a relative molecular weight of over 50,000 and a triple structure had anti￾tumor activity. For example, the anti-HIV activity of glucan sulfate increased with the increase of the 
relative molecular weight, and the maximum activity was maintained when the molecular weight was 
between 10,000 and 500,000. However, when the molecular weight continued to increase, its antivi￾ral activity gradually weakened. Generally speaking, glucans with molecular weights between 100 
and 200 kD have higher biological activities, while glucans with molecular weights between 5 and 10 
kD from the same source have no biological activity. For example, Schizophyllum commune glucan 
with a molecular weight greater than 100 kD had strong antitumor activity, while Schizophyllum 
commune glucan with a molecular weight less than 50 kD had no biological activity [16].
9.8 EFFECT OF VISCOSITY
The viscosity of glucan is mainly due to the hydrogen bond interaction between glucan molecules. 
It is mainly the comprehensive expression of internal friction between the sugar chain and solvent. 
Its size is related to the structure and conformation of glucans, charged properties, etc. It is not only 
positively correlated with solubility to some extent but also one of the key control factors of clinical 
efficacy. If the viscosity is too high, it is not conducive to the diffusion and absorption of glucan 
drugs. The viscosity of glucan can be reduced, and its activity can be improved by introducing a 
branched chain to destroy its hydrogen bond and degrading the main chain. Among them, control￾ling the main chain by ultrasound therapy is an effective method. For example, the schizophyllan 
has great application prospects. It has obvious effects in regulating immunity, antitumor, antira￾diation, etc., but it has not been degraded. Due to the high molecular weight of schizophyllan, its 
aqueous solution has a high viscosity; it can be precipitated with ethanol and freeze-dried to form 
a crystalline structure, making it difficult to redissolve in water. After controlled ultrasound, it 
was partially depolymerized to reduce molecular weight and viscosity, but its antitumor activity 
remained unchanged due to its repetitive structure [17].Glucans 159
9.9 CLASSIFICATION OF GLUCANS
Glucans are complex polysaccharides consisting of repeated units of d-glucose linked by glycosidic 
bonds. Generally, glucans are divided into classes as follows:
i. α-Glucan
ii. β-Glucan
9.9.1 α-Glucans
α-Glucans are polysaccharides comprising polymerized glucose joined by α-glycosidic linkages. The 
most commonly studied α-glucans concerning CBM research are starch, glycogen, and pullulan. The 
glucan polymers consist of α-D-glucosyl residues, connected via α-1,4- and α-1,6-glycosidic bonds. 
α-1,4-Glucan chains are connected via α-1,6-linkages occurring approximately every 24–30 glucose 
residues. While both, starch and glycogen, are chemically identical, major differences in their physico￾chemical properties are related to the molecular organization of glucan chains within the molecules. In 
starch, branching points are clustered, in contrast to glycogen, resulting in longer linear glucan chains, 
that can form double helices, and water is excluded. Pullulan is an imperative microbial exo-polymer 
commercially produced by the yeast-like fungus Aureobasidium pullulans. Its structure contains malt￾ose repeating units which comprise two α-(1→4) linked glucopyranose rings attached to one glucopy￾ranose ring through an α-(1→6) glycosidic bond. The co-existence of α-(1→6) and α-(1→4) glycosidic 
linkages endows distinctive physicochemical properties to pullulan. It is highly biocompatible, non￾toxic, and non-carcinogenic [18]. The α-D-glucans have been widely distributed among the microbial 
world concerning plants and animals [19] and differ in their structure and function based on the source. 
Glucans associated with α-D-(1→3) linkages play a pivotal role in the pharmaceutical industry as a 
prebiotic [5] and as a biodegradable polymer in the plastic industry [20]. Nevertheless, the applica￾tion potential of a majority of the α-D-(1→3) glucans in the health sector are limited because of their 
inherent insolubility. The solubility of the glucans majorly depends upon molecular weight, glycosidic 
linkage pattern, configuration (α or β), surface ionic properties, and degree of branching. These proper￾ties in turn alter the application potential of glucans in food and non-food industries [5]. Some of the 
glucans are amorphous and soluble in hot water, because of their homogenous nature, and branching 
structure which can reduce the inter and intra-molecular interactions between polymer segments [5]. 
For example, glucans with (1→6) branching lead to easier solubility because of a largely favorable 
entropy of the solution. However, high molecular weight glucans exhibiting ordered structures with lin￾ear chains (especially linear 1→3 linkages) are water insoluble and microfibrillar in nature. These can 
act as a structural element of fungal cell walls [20]. Therefore, to improve the solubility and the appli￾cation potential of the glucans, it is essential to improve their hydrophilicity. In this regard, molecular 
weight reduction by specific techniques such as chemical derivatization and physical irradiation plays 
a significant role and has also been reported in earlier studies. The majority of the α-D-(1→3) glucans 
upon derivatization have shown improved water solubility as well as bioactivity profile [21].
α-Glucan-coated starch (α-GCS) is produced at temperatures below the general gelatinization 
temperature of raw NCS; thus, it is assumed that α-GCS retains the structural characteristics and 
physicochemical properties of raw starch. Here, we hypothesize that the degree of recrystallization 
can be reduced at the initial stage of retrogradation because it is possible to control premature ret￾rogradation by inhibiting the loss of the amylose sheet layer by α-glucan coating, which affects the 
early stage of retrogradation and increases the degree of amylose aggregation.
9.9.2 Sources of α-Glucan
The structure of α-D-glucans differs mainly in their α-glycosidic linkages, arrangement of glu￾cose units in the chain (linear or branched) as well as source. Glycogen or other similar α-D-(1→4) 160 Polysaccharides
glucans have been reported in more than 50 different bacterial species. Many Gram-negative and 
Gram-positive bacteria as well as archaea have been reported to accumulate glycogen (containing 
branched α-D-(1→4)(1→6) linkages) as a storage material used under starvation conditions. However, 
lactic acid bacteria, belonging to the genera Leuconostoc, Streptococcus, and Lactobacillus, produce 
α-D-(1→3) glucan as a capsule on the outside of the cell wall. A variety of α-D-glucans such as dex￾tran, mutant, alternan, and veteran are also produced by different bacterial species using sucrose as 
a substrate material. Source and linkage of different bacterial α-D-glucans are shown in Table 9.2.
α-D-glucans have been synthesized by a variety of natural sources such as bacteria, fungi, plants, 
algae, lichens, insects, and mammals. Their characteristics such as molecular weight, linkage pat￾tern, and branching as well as function differs with the source (see Figure 9.1). Mostly α-D-(1→4) 
glucans function as an energy source in plants (starch), animals (glycogen), bacteria (glycogen), and 
fungi (glycogen, amylose). However, α-D-(1→3) glucans majorly existed as a cell wall element in 
fungi [13] and as an exopolysaccharide (EPS) in bacteria [2] (see Figure 9.1). Apart from natural 
sources, α-D-(1→3) glucans were also synthesized by in vitro methods using rDNA technology and 
recombinant microbes.
The lichen thalli are reported to be comprised of majorly three different types of polysaccha￾rides such as α-D-glucans, β-D-glucans, galactomannans, and a few complex heteroglucans such 
as rhamnopyranosyl galactofuranan galactomannoglucans, and thamnolan. The major lichen 
polysaccharides of higher percentage (glucans, galactomannans) are part of a mycobiont showing 
primarily linear or little substitution in α, β-D-glucans and slight branching in galactomannans 
structure. The polysaccharides extracted from the part of photobiont in lichen symbiont are little 
in percentage (e.g., thamnolan). However, the localization of polysaccharides in the mycobiont 
has not been explored. It could be either a fungal cell wall structural component or a reserve 
polymer and could also be a fungal intracellular or part of intracellular material, which surrounds 
both fungal and algal cells.
Organisms that possess glucans with α-D-(1→4) and α-D-(1→6) linkages, primarily func￾tioning as storage polymers. They are intracellular in nature and resemble starch. In contrast 
to glycogen granules observed in the prokaryotic cyanobacteria and distinct α-polyglucan from 
Cyanobacterium sp. MBIC10216, Myxosarcina burdens, and Synechococcus sp. BG043511, a 
new water extractable α-D-glucan with α-D-(1→6) linkages connected through (1→3) branches 
were reported from Chlorella vulgaris, reported to exhibit immune-enhancing functionality. 
Plants also synthesize α-D-glucans, popularly known as starch molecules and utilized mainly as a 
storage material for energy. However, apart from the storage polysaccharide (starch), some of the 
plants also synthesize glycogen like α-D-(1→4) glucan with α-D-(1→4) linked branch attached 
to the O-6 position. The branching differs from source to source and exhibits pharmacological 
activity [22] (Figure 9.2).

9.9.3 Stereoselective Synthesis of α-Glucans
Even though great progress in the synthesis of (complex) oligosaccharides, no general solution for 
the stereoselective development of difficult glycosidic bonds, such as 1,2-cis and 2-deoxy link￾ages, exists. The immense variation in carbohydrate building blocks and the various mechanism 
of action pathways that can be followed in the union of these are at the root of this persistent 
problem. The majority of glycosylation reactions rely on the activation of a glycosyl donor with a 
(Lewis) acid catalyst to produce a strong electrophile, which can be a covalent species, a close ion 
pair, or a solvent-separated ion pair in which the glycosyl oxocarbenium ion and the counterion are 
fully dissociated (as shown in Figure 9.3). Triflate-based activators are most commonly used, and 
a plethora of π-conjugated anomeric triflates have been characterized over the last two decades. 
These triflates may participate in an SN2-type substitution reaction, but they are more commonly 
used as a reservoir to hold the more reactive glycosyl cation-triflate ion pair, resulting in SN1-type 
reactions. The equilibrium of the covalent species and ion pairs, combined with the reactivity of 
the incoming nucleophile the acceptor, determines which pathway(s) will be followed. The activ￾ity of the donor-building block is determined by the natural position of the functional groups on 
the carbohydrate ring, and the different reactivity of donor glycosides has been used in one-pot 
chemo-selective glycosylation sequences based on reactivity. It is also well appreciated but less well 
studied that the reactivity of the acceptor alcohol can differ as a result of the protecting/functional 
group pattern on the ring, and the intrinsic reactivity difference between primary and secondary 
alcohols often leads to a different stereochemical outcome when glycosylating these acceptors. It is 
a tremendous challenge to design a general glycosylation strategy that accommodates the varying 
reactivity of different donor−acceptor glycoside combinations and ensures a fully stereoselective 
glycosylation process. An attractive way to modulate the reactivity of a glycosyl donor is through 
the use of an exogenous nucleophile that can be added to the coupling reaction. These nucleophilic 
additives or reactivity modulators react with the activated donor to form new covalent species as 
shown in the figure. Various additives have been probed over the years, including sulfides, sulf￾oxides/sulfinamides, phosphine oxides, amides and formamides, and iodide-based reagents, and 
stereoselective 1,2-cis-glycosylation procedures have been reported based on their use. The most 
often invoked mechanistic rationale to account for the observed stereoselectivity involves the gen￾eration of a stable α-covalent species (often identified and characterized by NMR spectroscopy), 
which is in equilibrium with its less stable and more reactive β-counterpart (often not detected by 
NMR), following an in situ isomerization kinetic scenarios as first introduced by Lemieux and 
coworkers. We reasoned that modulation of donor reactivity through external nucleophiles would 
FIGURE 9.2 Some sources of α-glucan.162 Polysaccharides
be very attractive to match the reactivity of acceptoralcohols of different nucleophilicity to achieve 
fully stereoselective glycosylation reactions with both partners. We hear a re-report of how a single 
type of donor glycoside can be used for the fully stereoselective glycosylation of both secondary 
alcohol acceptors. Different additives have been used to accommodate the intrinsic reactivity that 
differs between these two types of alcohol. Key to the success of the strategy is protecting the 
group strategy that ensures identical reactivity of the parent donor-building blocks used so that 
the reactivity of the system is under the direct control of the active additive used. We show the 
applicability of this approach in the assembly of Mycobacteriumium tuberculosis (Mtb) derived 
branched α-glucans. Mtbα-Glucans play an important role in allowing the bacterium to evade the 
human immune system, and the molecular details behind this process remain obscure. To unravel 
how α-glucans interact with our immune system, well-defined α-glucans fragments will be valuable 
tools. The structures represent excellent target molecules to test the proposed synthetic strategy, 
as they only contain 1,2-cislinkages and carry different branches, necessitating flexible building 
blocks and stereoselective glycosylation methodology for the construction of glycosidic linkages to 
both primary and secondary alcohol functions [23].
All protecting groups on the building blocks are benzyl ethers, and the reactivity of the building 
blocks is as similar as possible. The only factors influencing the relative reactivity of the accep￾tors are the intrinsic difference between the primary and secondary alcohols and the effect of the 
growing chain length on the reactivity of the acceptor. Second, global protection of the donor gly￾coside with benzyl ethers leads to a donor that is as reactive as possible. Previous reports employing 
nucleophilic additives glycosylations have shown that this type of glycosylation is generally very 
slow. The reactive intermediates that are generated are relatively stable necessitating long reaction 
times. The use of acyl type protecting groups would make the system less reactive leading to even 
longer reaction times.

9.9.4 Applications of α-Glucan
• α-D-glucans have become the choice of natural biopolymer owing to their unique struc￾tural and functional properties with potential applications in the food, medical, pharma￾ceutical, cosmetic, metallic industries, etc.
• The α-D-(1→3) glucans have gained much attention in the medical field due to their potential 
applications as prebiotics and therapeutic agents in the prevention and treatment of various 
diseases such as cancer in mouse models, dengue fever, schistosomiasis cytomegalovirus 
infections, infectious illnesses, and various autoimmune diseases. However, the biologi￾cal applications of α-D-glucans depend mainly on the solubility property which in turn 
is influenced by the length, branching, linkage, and molecular weight of polysaccharide.
• The extracellular glucans (EPS) play a vital role in pharmaceutical applications as excipi￾ents in formulation, carriers in the delivery of drugs, diagnostic agents in disease diagno￾sis, as well as theranostics in the treatment and diagnosis of disease, and as vaccines to 
provide artificial immunization. Dextran, the bacterial EPS, has potential pharmaceutical 
applications as a plasma volume expander.
• The cholesteryl-pullulan nanoparticle composites act as drug-targeting carriers with the 
selective binding ability to ß-amyloid receptors and reduce the toxicity of neurological 
disorders, e.g., Alzheimer’s disease.
• The immune stimulation properties of α-D-glucans consist of (1→6) linkage extracted 
from the roots of Ipomea batatas had shown by increasing the phagocytic function, hemo￾lytic activity, and concentration of IgG antibodies in a dose-dependent manner.
• The α-D-(1→3) glucans had better prebiotic potential and can stimulate the growth of 
Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium bacteria, but therapeutic properties such as immunos￾timulation and antitumor potential are limited in the native form. However, the enhanced 
immunomodulatory and antiproliferative potential along with less systemic toxicity than 
marketed anticancer drugs was shown by derivatized α-D-(1→3) glucans. This has been 
achieved due to a reduction in molecular weight of glucans after derivatization, which 
leads to increased solubility as well as bioactivity.
• The dextrans are extensively used as a column material in size-exclusion chromatography 
owing to their gel-forming capacity.
• The structure and concentration of the cell wall glucan are vital for the maintenance of 
the fungal cell morphology and integrity. Hochstenbach and coworkers reported that a 
decrease in the concentration of either α-D-(1→3) or β-D-(1→3) glucan results in an abnor￾mality of cell shape in fission yeast.
• In some fungi such as A. nidulans and S. commune, the cell wall α-D-(1→3) glucan 
functions as a reserve carbohydrate under nutrient-deprived conditions and is involved 
in the aggregation of hyphae and conidia in A. nidulans, which has been exploited in the 
development of α-D-(1→3) glucan-based polymer development.
• The film-forming capacity of starch could be used to replace the plastics in food packaging 
applications Similarly, the bacterial α-D-glucans, viz. dextran, are known to act as a gell￾ing, viscosity modifier, and emulsifying agent in food.
• The α-D-(1→3) glucans act as mutants inducers [α-(1→3) glucanases] from microorgan￾isms that can be used to treat dental caries and as a biocontrol agent for pest control.
• α-Glucan phosphorylases (α-GPs) act as a catalyst for reversible phosphorolysis of α-1,4-
linked polysaccharides such as glycogen, starch, and maltodextrins, and thus play an 
important role in the utilization of storage polysaccharides. Because of their high operating 
temperatures, GPs provide significant benefits and facilitate bioprocess design as shown 
in Figure 9.4 [22].
• 1,4-α-Glucan branching enzymes (GBEs) are found throughout all animals, microorgan￾isms, and plants. These enzymes transform the structure of both starch and glycogen, 164 Polysaccharides
and they play a critical role in regulating the frequency and location of branch points 
in glucan chains. Thus, GBEs can change the structure of starches, thereby influencing 
their functional properties. The action patterns of 1,4-α-glucan branching enzymes allow 
several crucial downstream uses. For instance, modification of the digestibility and retro￾gradation characteristics of starch can be achieved by adjusting the points and frequency 
of branch points in glucan chains.
• α-1,6 Linkages in starch chains produce a large amount of α-limit dextrins (α-LDx) during 
α-amylolysis, decelerating glucose release at the intestinal α-glucosidase level.
• Macro-sized branched-glucans with high α-LDx has the potential to be used as a slowly 
digestible material to reduce postprandial glycemic response.
9.9.5 β-Glucan
β-Glucan is a polysaccharide that is found in yeast, mushrooms, bacteria, algae, barley, and 
oats. Because of its numerous health benefits, it is regarded as a functional food ingredient. 
The hypocholesterolemic and hypoglycemic properties of β-glucan are due to its high molecu￾lar weight (Mw) and viscosity. Lentinan, a β-glucan derived from the fungus Lentinus edodes, 
exists as triple helical structures at room temperature, resulting in high viscosity and excellent 
tolerance to a wide range of pH, temperature, and salt concentrations in aqueous solution. The 
structural component of fungal cell walls consists of chitin covalently bonded to glucan, forming 
a native composite material (chitin-glucan). The foaming capability and emulsifying properties 
of β-glucan products were better in neutral solutions (pH = 7) than in the acidic (pH = 4) and 
alkaline (pH = 9) [24]. β-Glucan is a non-starch soluble polysaccharide widely present in yeast, 
mushrooms, bacteria, algae, barley, and oat. β-Glucan is regarded as a functional food ingredi￾ent due to its various health benefits. The high molecular weight (Mw) and high viscosity of 
β-glucan are responsible for its hypocholesterolemic and hypoglycemic properties. β-Glucan 
are also used in the food industry for the production of functional food products. The inherent 
gel-forming property and high viscosity of β-glucan lead to the production of low-fat foods with 
improved textural properties [25].
β-Glucans are naturally occurring glucose polymers that are present in abundance in plants, 
bacteria, and fungi. For centuries, traditional Chinese medicine uses fungi for healing, and cur￾rently, interests have focused on polysaccharides that are a crucial component of fungi cell walls. 
Within the multitude of polysaccharides present, β-glucans are a key reason in why fungi are used 
in cosmetics, as food additives, or for medicinal purposes. β-Glucans share a common structure 
consisting of a backbone of β(1,3)-linked β-d-glucopyranosyl units. However, they can strongly dif￾fer by their length and branching structure. Fungal β-glucans, which represent the most abundant 
polysaccharides found in the cell wall of fungi, are mainly characterized by the presence of β(1,6)-
linked branches coming off of the β(1,3) backbone. The structural diversity also depends on the 
fungal source. For example, β-glucans of mushrooms have short β(1,6)-linked branches whereas 
those of yeast have β(1,6)-side branches with additional β(1,3) regions [26]. Of note, these struc￾tural differences may influence the immunogenic properties of β-glucans, and many studies have 
FIGURE 9.4 Bioprocess design of GP.Glucans 165
suggested that a higher degree of structural complexity is associated with enhanced β-glucans￾induced antimicrobial and anticancer activity. Mushrooms have unique sensory properties and 
nutritional values as well as health benefits due to their bioactive compounds, especially β-glucans. 
Well-known edible and medicinal mushroom species, as well as uncommon or unknown species 
representing interesting sources of bioactive β-glucans, have been widely studied [6].
The major structural feature of mushroom β-glucans is a β-1,3-D-glucan main chain with single 
D-glucosyl residues linked to β-1,3 along this main chain. Some of this glucan can be extracted 
from the fruiting body of the mushroom, and soluble β-glucans are also produced by cultured myce￾lia. Because β-glucans are not synthesized by the human body, they are recognized by the immune 
system and induce both adaptive and innate immune responses. In this context, the use of mush￾room extracts with soluble β-glucans vs the consumption of the whole fruiting body is discussed for 
digestibility and bioactivity In addition, chitin and α-glucans are present in mushrooms; the total 
polysaccharide contents of mushrooms range between 50% and 90%.
9.9.6 Sources of β-Glucan
β-Glucans can be divided into two subgroups: cereal and non-cereal. Cereal or grain-derived 
β-glucans usually have 1,3 1,4 glycosidic linkages without any 1,6-bonds or branching. They are 
fibrous structures found in aleurone (proteins stored as granules in the cells of plant seeds), in the 
sub-aleurone layer, and in the cell wall of endospores. Cereals include oat, barley, wheat, and rice 
β-glucans share similar structures; some differences include variation in 1,3 and 1,4 linkage ratio 
and molecular size; and some have large cellulose structures. β-Glucan content also varies among 
cereal sources—there is higher glucan content in barley than oats, and the least is found in rice 
and wheat. Mushroom is one of the major sources of β-glucan used in medical applications and 
traditional therapies. Thus, structure analysis and quantification of β-glucan content are crucial to 
evaluating medicinal mushrooms [19].
Non-cereal β-glucans are fibrous structures found in yeast, fungi, bacteria, and algae. β-Glucans 
originating from yeast have linear (1,3) backbones with long chains of 1,6 branching. Unlike grain 
β-glucans, fungal β-glucans differ between species concerning the degree of branching and dis￾tribution. Curdlan, a glucan isolated from Agrobacterium, contains no side branching, just a β-D 
glucan backbone. The solubility of the molecule is reliant on 1,3 linkages. β-Glucans are classified 
as soluble dietary fiber as the beta configuration is not digestible by enzymes in the human gastro￾intestinal (GI) tract. They are further classified pharmacologically as biological response modifiers 
(BRMs) as they influence their immune system counterparts. For cereal-based β-glucan at least, 
higher molecular weight β-glucans appear to be more effective than lower weight molecules. With 
this level of variance, it is not surprising that there is a range of diverse applications of β-glucans in 
clinical trials ranging from the alleviation of respiratory illnesses to improving fatigue and weight 
loss (Figure 9.5).
9.9.7 Stereoselective Solid-Phase Synthesis of β-Glucans
The development of an iterative automated solid-phase synthesis of linear β-(1,3)-glucans that can 
produce oligosaccharides of any chain length. The power of that approach is highlighted by the syn￾thesis of the linker-functionalized β-(1,3)-glucan dodecasaccharide. High coupling efficiencies for 
each glycosylation step are required to synthesize β-(1,3)-glucan oligosaccharides such as dodeca￾saccharide on solid support (Figure 9.1). Control of the anomeric configuration of the newly formed 
glycosidic bonds is imperative to avoid the formation of complex mixtures of products. The design 
of the building block including protecting group pattern and anomeric leaving group, the choice of 
the linker, and the type of solid support were made mindful of these requirements (Scheme 9.1). 
Thioglucoside was envisioned as a reliable building block to produce β-configured glucans. The ano￾meric leaving group was chosen since it has already been used for the introduction of β-glucosidic 
linkages, while the pivaloyl ester in the C2 position was introduced to ensure the selective formation 166 Polysaccharides
of β-glycosidic link. The 4,6-O-benzylidene acetal was seen as suitable protection for the C4 and 
C6 hydroxyl groups as it has already been successfully employed in several syntheses of β-(1,3)-
glucans. The Fmoc group was chosen for temporary protection of the C3 hydroxyl for its stability to 
acids, the ease of assessing the efficiency of each glycosylation, and the mild conditions required for 
its removal after each coupling step. Merrifield resin was selected as solid support since it has been 
employed successfully in the solid-phase synthesis of carbohydrates. The versatility of functional￾ized Merrifield resin in the synthesis of various oligosaccharides has recently been demonstrated. 
The base-labile linker allows for the simultaneous cleavage of the crude products from the solid sup￾port and the removal of base-labile protecting groups present on the oligosaccharide. Furthermore, 
it is stable to the most common activation conditions for thioglycosides. Building block was syn￾thesized in seven steps starting from β-d-glucose pentaacetate (Scheme 9.1). Intermediate was pre￾pared according to previously reported procedures. Esterification of the C2 hydroxyl group with 
pivaloyl chloride afforded thioglycoside. Removal of the TBS silyl ether using a buffered solution 
of TBAF·3H2O and glacial acetic acid gave alcohol that was treated to afford thioglycoside building 
block. Functionalized Merrifield resin was prepared according to previously described procedures. 
The solid-phase assembly of β-(1,3)-glucans on functionalized solid support was performed using 
three equivalents of thioglycoside in three repetitions per glycosylation cycle (Scheme 9.2). The 
glycosylations were carried out on the automated synthesizer by suspending functionalized resin, 
and three equivalents of the glycosylating agent in dichloromethane in dichloromethane/acetoni￾trile (1:1) were added dropwise via a syringe pump. The reaction mixture was agitated using an 
argon flow while maintaining the temperature for 5 minutes. Then the temperature was increased 
to 108°C, and the mixture was agitated for another 40 minutes before draining the reaction vessel 
using argon pressure. This procedure was executed three times, followed by washing steps using 
different solvents. Following each glycosylation cycle, the temporary Fmoc protecting group was 
removed using a 20% (v/v) solution of piperidine in DMF. The reaction vessel was drained, and the 
resin was washed. These steps were repeated until oligosaccharides of the desired chain lengths 
were assembled. The crude product was cleaved from the solid support by saponification with 
sodium methoxide in a mixture of methanol and dichloromethane.

of cellular responses by mushrooms and other β-glucans is most likely because of their 
unique interaction with several cell-specific receptors, such as complement receptors.
• β-Glucans may inhibit the body’s absorption of cholesterol from food. They may also stim￾ulate the immune system by increasing anti-infection chemicals.
• β-Glucans are powerfully bioactive compounds with anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and 
immune-modulating properties. β-Glucan is increasingly being used in food and other 
industries due to its unique physical properties such as water solubility, viscosity, and gela￾tion. Fungal chitin nanofibrils can be used to make nano papers (FChNFs). Because of 
their distinct surface properties inherited from the chitin and glucan composition, FChNF 
nano papers have the potential to be used in packaging films, composites, or membranes 
for water treatment.
• Several fungal pathogens by binding to β-glucans, and it is important in innate immune 
responses.
• β-Glucan is also extensively used in the food industry for its ability to form a gel and 
enhance the viscosity of aqueous solutions. It is used for enhancing the texture and appear￾ance of salad dressings and gravies.
• β-Glucan is also used as a fat mimetic to develop calorie-reduced food production.
• Bile acid is produced in the liver from cholesterol. The binding of β-glucan with bile acid 
and its fecal excretion lead to a decrease in the cholesterol levels in the body.
• β-Glucan has various physical properties such as thickening, stabilizing, emulsification, 
and gelation. β-Glucan has the potential to be used in acceptable health products that offer 
a wide range of added health benefits.
• A high levels of β-glucan were obtained from oat or barley grain. This product can be 
produced as an agglomerated food additive having at least about 18% β-glucan by dry 
weight. Methods are providing for enriching a product with the β-glucan agglomerated 
food additive.
• β-Glucans have a potential applications in medicine and pharmacy, food, cosmetic and 
chemical industries, as well as in veterinary medicine and feed production.
9.10 CONCLUSION
Glucan is a key food component in the treatment of the physiologic dysregulations-related meta￾bolic syndrome. Although the physiological effects of ingested glucan are similar to those of other 
soluble fibers, its availability and ease of handling led to its increasing incorporation into foods, 
with the goal of increasing daily fiber consumption. The chapter has also explored the role of glucan 
in fungal pathogenesis and how it promotes phagocytic-mediated immune responses. Similarly, 
fungal glucan administration is well known to enhance the immune system and boost resistance to 
numerous infectious diseases and cancers. Glucans with different structures and molecular weight 
interact with each receptor, and specific signaling pathways are triggered by glucan molecules with 
described biochemical properties. With such a common control, we may attempt an intellectually 
honest use of this promising molecule as an adjuvant or therapeutic age in the future.

10.1 INTRODUCTION
Polysaccharides are the most common supramolecular polymers found naturally, and they can be 
identified in phytoplankton, kingdom plantae, and microorganisms including fungi and bacteria 
[1,2]. Different investigations have been conducted to date on the numerous kinds of polysaccha￾rides found in sensors and actuators, including cellulose, starch, chitin, and chitosan [3]. A sensor is 
a sort of electrical equipment that is hypothetically characterized as a transducer that changes one 
type of energy to another that may be processed further [4]. Sensors convert physical inputs to elec￾trical outputs, while actuators do the reverse [5]. They convert the electrical signals generated by 
control modules to physical outputs [6,7]. Polysaccharides are the most prevalent class of materials 
derived from reusable and maintainable sources. They are decomposable, carbon (C) neutral; pose 
little dangers to the environment, human health, or safety; and act as a structural component of plant 
cell walls [8–10]. The production of synthetic textile fibers (e.g., organic and inorganic esters, alkyl, 
hydroxy alkyl, and carboxyl alkyl ethers), as well as coating materials, optical films, food products, 
medical devices, and cosmetics, all relies on cellulose and hemicelluloses, which have been used as 
structural materials in a broad range of applications for many years [11]. Additionally, because of 
the characteristics, usefulness, durability, and homogeneity of polysaccharides, their usage in sen￾sors and actuators has increased in recent years [9]. This chapter will address the usage of several 
kinds of polysaccharides in sensors and actuators [12].
10.2 POLYSACCHARIDES IN SENSORS AND ACTUATORS
10.2.1 Cellulose in Sensors and Actuators
Cellulose is the biosphere’s most plentiful inexhaustible organic element, with a year-round pro￾duction of around 5 × 1011 metric tons [13]. Cellulose is a syndiotactic homopolymer made up of 
D-anhydroglucopyranose units connected by β-(1→4)-glycosidic bonds as shown in Figure 10.1 [14].
Cellulose, a bio-based product, may be efficiently generated either top-down, by subjecting bio￾mass to strong shear pressures to reduce the dimension of cellulose molecule in suspension, or bot￾tom-up, by employing bacterial cellulose biosynthesis, with Acetobacter xylinam being the most 
effective bacterial specie [3]. Due of its cost efficiency, cellulose derived from plants was favored 
for mass manufacture of engineering properties. The notion of a renewable and sustainable prod￾uct derived from cellulose was deeply investigated. As a consequence of their behavior changes in 
response to stimuli, “smart” materials based on cellulose provide a diverse set of applications in 
the sensing domain [14]. Due to cellulose’s biodegradability and biocompatibility, it has recently 
been used to new sectors. One of the emerging disciplines is the unearthing of cellulose paper as Polysaccharides in Sensors and Actuators 171
a smart substance capable of being employed as sensors and actuators. The name “electro-active 
paper” (EAPap) refers to this kind of smart material. Yun et al. combined F-MWNTs (functional￾ized multiwall carbon nanotubes) with cellulose mixture to form F-MWNTs/cellulose electroac￾tive paper (EAPap) actuators. Cellulose was liquefied in a LiCl/N, DMAc (N-dimethylacetamide) 
solution and combined with F-MWNTs to form F-MWNTs/cellulose EAPap actuators. The cel￾lulose EAPap’s actuation notion was most likely inspired by the ion transfer mechanism, which 
occurs frequently in humid environments. Hydrophilic moieties on MWNTs enhanced cellulose’s 
moisture retention in a somewhat humid conditions, while enhancing Cl– ion transportation in 
F-MWNT/cellulose EAPap. Orelma et al. have developed an optical cellulose fiber for water sens￾ing utilizing a progressive preparation technique [15]. The fiber’s core was generated by dry–wet 
spinning liquefied cellulose in [EMIM]OAc into H2O. Cladding layer was developed by covering 
a sheet of C164H174O111 (cellulose acetate) liquefied in acetone onto the cellulose core using a fila￾ment coater. Employing UV and FTIR spectroscopy, cast films were used to test the chemical and 
optical properties of regenerated cellulose and cellulose acetate. It was discovered that regenerated 
cellulose sheet absorbs UV rays while fleeting visible light wavelengths. C164H174O111 sheet was 
revealed to pass the entire visible light spectrum. The manufactured optical fiber directed light in 
the 500–1,400 nm wavelength range. At 1,300 nm, the attenuation constant of the (C6H10O5)n fiber 
was determined verified to be 63 × 10−1 dB cm−1. When the fiber was immersed in H2O, a signifi￾cant decrease in light intensity was noticed. Table 10.1 summarizes the various types of cellulose 
used in sensors and actuators [4,8,16–21].
Cellulose paper, a naturally existing material that is cost-effective, compact, harmless to 
environment, and physically bendable, is crucial in the creation of next-generation wearable 
electronics. Soft actuators constructed of cellulose paper have attracted a lot of attention since

the boom in the development of functional electronics [22]. Soft actuators based on cellulose 
paper provide a legitimate response to the environmental concerns associated with the extensive 
use of flexible actuators. While far from flawless, advances in cellulose paper actuators have 
enabled simple and ecologically friendly fabrication of beneficial operating gadgets, demon￾strating their potential uses in paper robots, do-it-yourself projects, inquisitive education, and 
smart home gadgets as well. As materials science, fabrication methods, and construction tech￾nology develop, CPap actuators will emerge into elite device platforms competent of implement￾ing breakthrough flexible paper machineries.
10.2.1.1 Cellulose in Humidity Sensors
The presence of water vapor in the air is referred to as humidity. Humidity, as a fundamental 
yet critical environmental component, has a significant impact on manufacturing, assessment, 
technical performance, convenience, and healthcare [17]. With the advancement of sophisticated 
advanced urban areas and manufacturing and agribusiness activities, it is becoming more neces￾sary to monitor and adjust the humidity level. The demand for very precise humidity sensors has 
sped up the progression of various transducer innovations and material science. Capacitive sensors 
now monopolize the humidity sensor market; however, investigation into other types of sensors, 
including resistive, optical, and gravimetric sensors, is still ongoing [16]. It is widely accepted that 
inorganic materials or ceramics have effectively developed and improved the technical qualities of 
a humidity sensor in the past [16].
Guan et al. have developed humidity sensors through a straightforward solution approach using 
EPTAC (glycidyl trimethyl ammonium chloride) improved cellulose paper, with the paper serving 
as both the humidity detecting system and the sensor material [23]. By modifying EPTAC, the 
resultant sensor’s sensitivity was increased and the reaction time (RT) was lowered to 25s, which 
is equivalent to the performance of high-quality paper-based humidity sensing devices. The paper￾based moisture sensor is also exceedingly elastic and biocompatible, rendering it ideal for a wide 
range of functions such as respiration surveillance, non-contact shifting, and cutaneous moisture 
surveillance. The cheap and straightforward fabrication approach described in this paper may be an 
advantageous option for producing multifunctional humidity sensors.
Cellulose, termed electro-active paper, has been reinvented as a functional materials suitable of 
being used as sensors and actuators. Mahadeva and coworkers demonstrate the versatility of cel￾lulose as a humidity and temperature sensor. Nano-scaled polypyrrole (PPy) was put onto the cel￾lulose interface as a temperature and relative humidity sensitive layer without changing the cellulose 
architecture using an in-situ polymerization procedure. The successful application of a polypyrrole 
nanolayer onto the interface of cellulose, progress in the production of a cellulose–PPy nanocom￾posite, was confirmed using atomic force microscopy, ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy, transmission 
electron microscopy, and secondary ion mass spectrometry. The influence of polymerization time 
on cellulose–PPy nanocomposite sensing performance was investigated; experimental outcomes 
revealed that cellulose–PPy nanocomposite with a 16-hour polymerization time is well suited for 
temperature and humidity detectors [24].
For enhanced human-machine interactions, the development of non-contact bendable electronic 
sensors with elevated sensitivity and robust association is critical. Meng and coworkers designed a 
novel cellulose acetate (CA)/aluminum (Al) flexible humidity sensor using theoretical simulations 
[25]. Aligned CA fiber mats with groove architectures demonstrated a high sensitivity to humid￾ity and a programmable deformation capacity. The conductive Al layer had an organized wrinkle 
structure that was ideal for balancing high deformability and reliable electrical connection. On the 
basis of these characteristics, the non-contact CA/Al sensor can detect changes in sweating on a 
human finger and produce consistent on–off signals under ongoing deformations, making it ideal 
for wearable human-machine interface equipment. This research paves the way for the creation 
of high-performance non-contact bendable electronic sensors that are directed by artificial intel￾ligence in the future.Polysaccharides in Sensors and Actuators 173
10.2.1.2 Cellulose in pH Sensors
Halochromic or pH-sensitive textiles are constituents that alter color in response to changes in pH 
and may be utilized for injury treatment, defensive apparel, and purification, among other purposes. 
The majority of synthetic dyes are halochromic, meaning they change color depending on the pH. 
They do, however, have a negative impact on the atmosphere and are related with allergic, noxious, 
and other adverse reactions [26]. Because the process of rotting is generally accompanied by a pH 
shift, pH indicators have been used to monitor and signal the freshness of food in storage due to 
their efficiency and simplicity [19]. Ma and Wang synthesized a colorimetric pH-sensing coating 
from grape skin (EGS) extracts and embedded it in a tara gum (TG)/cellulose nanocrystal (CNC) 
matrix [19]. The EGS’s UV-vis spectra were examined throughout a pH range of 1–10, and the color 
varied dramatically from brilliant red to dark green. Ji et al. developed color-tunable luminous 
macrofibers centered on CdTe quantum dots (QDs) utilizing bacterial cellulose nanofibers and wet 
spinning [27]. The luminous macrofiber’s green, yellow, and orange fluorescence can be readily 
modified by adjusting the dimension of the CdTe QDs. The luminous macrofiber exhibited a sigmoi￾dal pH dependency, and this pH-dependent activity varied with the size of CdTe QDs.
Devarayan and Kim discuss the use of electrospun cellulose nanofibers chemically modified 
with a natural color to create an ecologically responsible, bidirectional, and global pH sensor [26]. 
A natural color originating from red cabbage was incorporated into electrospun non-woven cel￾lulose fibers using adsorption and chemical crosslinking processes. According to the observations, 
the biocomposite produced is a ubiquitous pH sensor that can recognize pH values between 1 and 14 
by presenting a different color code for each pH value. Additionally, it was discovered that the pH 
detecting was even across a wide range of temperatures and time periods. Additionally, the colors 
could be reversed and the pH sensor could be recycled.
10.2.1.3 Cellulose in Gas Detection Sensors
Gas sensors (also known as gas detectors) are electronic equipment that recognize and classify a 
wide range of gases. They’re frequently used to identify and analyze potentially hazardous or com￾bustible gases. Gas sensors are used to monitor gas leaks in factories and industrial complexes, as 
well as smoke and carbon monoxide in residential settings. Gas sensors come in a wide range of 
dimensions (transportable and stationary), sensing capabilities, and ranges. They’re usually part of a 
larger embedded device, like hazmat or security, and they’re usually connected to an audible alarm 
or user interface. Gas sensors require calibration more frequently than other types of sensors due to 
their constant interaction with air and other gases. Mun et al. created a titanium dioxide MWCNT 
composite in nanoscale using a hydrothermal technique, and further composite formation was veri￾fied by utilizing X-ray diffractometry and transmission electron microscopy. After that for using 
in ammonia gas sensor, a cellulose–TiO2–MWCNT composite was created. The cellulose–TiO2–
MWCNT hybrid nanocomposite displayed substantially better responsiveness and faster recupera￾tion when the quantity of NH3 gas was elevated from 50 to 500 ppm. This versatile and low-cost 
hybrid gas sensor provides a high level of sensitivity and repeatability [28].
Hittini et al. discovered the invention of a new class of hydrogen sulfide gas sensors manufactured by 
using metal-oxide and polymeric matrix, which are responsive, specific, and low temperature. Copper 
oxide nanoparticles were used for precise nanoparticle size control. To make elastic and semi-conduc￾tive polymeric matrix membranes, they mixed sodium carboxymethyl cellulose dust with 5% glycerol 
and varied amounts of copper oxide nanoparticles. An H2S gas sensor was created by sandwiching each 
membrane between two electrodes. Investigation of the sensor’s temperature-dependent gas detection 
capabilities was carried out from 40°C to 80°C. At a low processing temperature and a gas concentra￾tion of 15ppm, the sensors demonstrated good sensitivity and rapid response times to H2S gas. The 
sensors were also extremely specific for H2S gas and had a low humidity reliance, demonstrating that 
they will work dependably in humid conditions. This organic-inorganic hybrid materials gas sensor is 
versatile, sensitive, and energy efficient, making it ideal for use in harsh environments [29].174 Polysaccharides
10.2.1.4 Cellulose in Strain Sensor
Strain sensors are an example of a highly effective electronic sensor. They’re also known as electro￾mechanical sensors or sensor and actuator. This sensor has a wide range of industrial applications. 
Construction, bridges, and other critical infrastructure, for example, are occasionally vulnerable 
to major natural disasters like tsunamis, etc. It is vital to use a strain sensor to continuously check 
the condition of these infrastructures in order to avoid a catastrophic failure. Fundamentally, strain 
sensors with high flexibility and stretch ability play a crucial part in personal health monitoring, 
human-friendly gadgets, and extremely sensitive devices, or what are commonly referred to as 
smart devices, due to their widespread use in outdoor applications [3]. From a structural aspect, 
this type of sensor is frequently made as a thin sheet. To promote its performance, this sheet is 
frequently made as an ultra-thin layer. Strain sensor, also referred as electromechanical sensor, uses 
highly polarized nanoparticles as an active medium to generate an electrical charge in reaction to an 
external electric field. In most cellulose composites, cellulose serves as a matrix for nanoparticles. 
As a result, considerable polarization occurs when an external electric field is applied. Wu et al. 
have presented a novel way for constructing stretchable strain sensors by using cellulose [30]. The 
results demonstrate that combining reduced graphene oxide with a tiny amount of carbon nanofibers 
increases the electrical conductivity and piezoresistive sensitivity of the composite sensor. Wu et al. 
also proposed polymer which is a hybrid made up of crosslinking hydroxyethyl cotton cellulose 
in the form of nanofibers and carbon nanotubes with polyurethane and investigated response of 
amount of CNTs on the electrical conductance nanocomposite formed to see if it could be used as 
a strain [31]. The structural and water-responsive shape memory characteristics were thoroughly 
examined to assess the substance’s durability. The fully complexed TPU matrix was shown to have 
outstanding mechanical attributes and sensing capability. Figure 10.2 depicts a mechanism for 
interfacial interactions based on hydrogen bonding [31].
FIGURE 10.2 Schematic illustration of the hydrogen bonding interaction mechanism among molecules of 
TPU, CNF-C, and CNTs, and the film formation of TPU/CNF-C/CNTs. Adapted from ref. [32].Polysaccharides in Sensors and Actuators 175
The water-induced shape fixity ratio (Rf) and shape recovery ratio (Rr) demonstrating that the 
alteration in the composite could be returned back to its original shape in response to a stimulus. 
The sensing features of the resulted composite was also studied at different conditions. The hybrid 
composite can detect huge stresses correctly for more than 103 times, according to the findings, and 
water-induced shape regain capacity may help sustain sensing accuracy after material fatigue to 
some degree. It is predicted that future water-responsive sensors and actuators could benefit greatly 
from using this type of composite material.
10.2.1.5 Cellulose in Ultraviolet Sensor
UV sensors detect the amount of ultraviolet (UV) light that is emitted. Although the wavelengths of 
this kind of electromagnetic radiation are less than those of visible light, they are still longer than 
those of x-rays. UV sensors are used to determine how much ultraviolet light has been exposed to 
in a laboratory or in the environment. Cellulose was employed as the matrix and organic polymer 
which are conductive in nature was used to enhance the bio-based composite for the UV sensor, as 
was the case with gas detection and humidity sensor. Gimenez et al. suggested a unique technique 
for fabricating a composite material consisting of zinc oxide (ZnO) crystals and cellulose fibers by 
compressing them together. When subjected to ultraviolet (UV) light, the manufactured material’s 
electrical photoconductivity changed. When cellulose fibers are mixed with ZnO, the photosensitiv￾ity is greater than when the device is built entirely of ZnO [32].
Komatsu et al. used a simple spray coating approach to create transparent films made of cel￾lulose and ZnO, in the form of nanofibers and nanoparticles, respectively [33]. The nanocomposite 
films that were generated were thin (~10m) and bendable. The formation of film was verified by by 
scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy, and it was found that film consisted 
of mainly cellulose nanofibers containing ZnO nanoparticles in it and sections of agglomerated 
ZnO nanoparticles, also electrical conductance of the resulted film rose significantly above 40wt.% 
ZnO, reaching >50 nA at 60wt.% ZnO. When a particular point, the ZnO NPs present in the film 
produced an increasing number of conductive pathways, according to the researchers. The nano￾composite film displayed a consistent reactivity to UV light exposure during on/off cycles. Even if 
the device was bent, the responsiveness and sensitivity remained robust (radius of curvature equals 
to 3mm). This new nanocomposite film could be utilized to make UV sensors that are environmen￾tally friendly and versatile.
10.2.2 Starch in Sensors and Actuators
Starch is a significant carbohydrate found in plants. Amylopectin and amylose make up this 
carbohydrate’s structure [34]. Amylose is a linear polymer made up of α-d-glucopyranose units 
connected by a α-(1–4) linkage; amylopectin is comparatively large with many branches composed 
of linear α-(1–4) polymer attached with side chains via a single (1–6) junction [35].
Garcia et al. demonstrated the use of screen-printed carbon electrodes (SPCE) to detect salivary 
α-amylase (sAA) in human saliva samples (SPCE). The suggested approach included the indirect 
estimation of sAA via the use of a series of two chemical processes. Essentially, the first reaction 
occurs when sAA hydrolyzes starch to form maltose. The resulting reducing sugar then aids in con￾verting the compound [Fe (CN)6]3− to [Fe (CN)6]4− in a subsequent reaction. Numerous variables, 
including pH, time of reaction, sAA volume, and amount of starch, were optimized exhaustively. A 
better electrochemical results were obtained with optimized conditions of 5 milli mol L−1 sodium 
hydroxide at 12pH, for 20 minutes, 15 μL of sAA quantity, and a starch concentration of 0.5% (w/v). 
The results demonstrated a strong association between sAA concentrations of 100 and 1,200U 
mL−1, which was linear. Limits of detection (LOD) and sensitivity were determined to be 1.1U mL−1
and 10.7 μA/(log U mL−1)10.7 A/(log U mL−1), respectively. The electrochemical sensor presented 
here displayed a high degree of selectivity [36].176 Polysaccharides
The influence of porous structure (larger in size) on the electrical characteristics of SnO2 gas sen￾sors was investigated by Lee and Kang. For this, starch powder of varied concentration (0%–15% 
by weight) was added in SnO2 gas sensors resulted in large holes at intergranular level. Except for 
the creation of big holes, the addition of starch powder had no effect on the sintering behavior or 
microstructure. The inclusion of starch enhanced the gas sensitivity [37].
Choi et al. produced a novel film potato starch, utilizing agar, and natural colors taken from 
purple sweet potato, Ipomoea batatas [38]. A colorimeter was used to determine the color changes 
of pH indicator films following immersion in buffer solution with different pH. A feasibility study 
was done to determine the sensor’s suitability for usage as a meat-rotting sensor. These resulted 
films demonstrated how pork sample’s pH and spoilage point changed from red to green. As a result, 
these films generated might be utilized for detecting food deterioration.
Elgamouz et al. produced silver nanoparticles using starch, AgNO3, sodium borohydride as a 
capping shell, silver source, and reducing agent, respectively [39]. The detection of hydrogen per￾oxide in water taken as solvent and samples of urine were explored using starch-capped silver 
nanoparticles. It was discovered that the decomposition of H2O2 on the catalytic surface is pH, 
temperature, and time dependent [39].
Additionally, starch-based nanocomposites are employed as a sensor for heavy metals. 
Khachatryan et al. demonstrated the fabrication of new starch-based nanocomposites comprising 
zinc sulfide QDs capped with L-cysteine [40]. These nanoscale composites were made using potato 
starch gels and foils embedded with spherical QDs ranging in size from 10 to 20nm and were 
verified by using photoluminescence, infrared and ultraviolet spectra, and transmission electron 
microscopy/scanning electron microscopy. Pb2+ and Cu2+ ions lowered the photoluminescent spec￾tral band’s emission intensities.
10.2.3 Chitin and Chitosan in Sensors and Actuators
Chitin and chitosan have gained considerable interest in various fields of sciences because of their 
outstanding structural and functional features. Chitin is a polymer consisted of long-chain N-acetyl 
glucosamine that serves as the structural component of a variety of organisms, including fungal cell 
walls, insect and crustacean exoskeletons, mollusk radulas, and squid beaks [41]. Chitin deacety￾lation ultimately resulted in to chitosan and may be tailored to have a wide variety of chemical and 
physical properties by altering the chain length of the starting constituent or varying the extent 
of changing the polymers back into monomers and by removing the acetyl groups. Chitin and, in 
particular, chitosan have been widely used in advanced biofabrication. There are various functional 
groups having internal oxygen and nitrogen in its chemical structure that can be employed as start￾ing points for covalent modification of the chitosugar chain, which is another favorable attribute. 
Chitosan has been more useful as compared to chitin because it can be easily dissolved into dilute 
acids, they can be easily deposited like hydrogel and have the ability to electrodeposit a thin film on 
electrode surfaces, which is very important in nanoscale applications like micro to nanobiosensor 
formation. It’s not unexpected that chitosan is more often utilized in sensor technology than chitin 
because of these additional benefits. Polymeric matrix composites that are ecofriendly and long 
lasting have recently piqued the curiosity of scientists and industry alike, and because of vast avail￾ability and environmental appeal, naturally produced materials have been intensively investigated.
Chen et al. proposed a unique small chitosan diaphragm-based extrinsic Fabry–Perot sensors 
acoustic pressure sensor that retains the benefits of traditional all-silica micro EFPI sensors while 
increasing sensitivity [42]. The sensor is manufactured without the use of chemical processes, 
which results in cost efficiency. The studies were conducted at a range of frequencies (20Hz to 
20 kHz), and the sensor demonstrated good accuracy and consistency in sensing acoustic pressure. 
By removing retained expanding air within the space, the chitosan diaphragm solves the issue of 
background pressure shift and ensures temperature stability. The sensor’s signal-to-noise ratio may 
be increased by utilizing a narrowband filter and amplifier. Additionally, the fiber tip is coated with Polysaccharides in Sensors and Actuators 177
chitosan diaphragm material, which has a good sensitivity of 6 dB and significant promise in bio￾logical applications owing to its similar properties. In a separate investigation, Ezati et al. create a 
colorimetric indicator for evaluating the freshness of minced beef in real time [43]. The indicator 
was synthesized by incorporating alizarin into a cellulose-chitosan film. The addition of alizarin 
had no effect on the swelling index but lowered the water solubility. At pH 2–11, the indicator dem￾onstrated a distinct transition from yellow to brown to purple and exhibited greater color stability 
at 4°C than at 25°C after 2months of storage. Notably, the indicator changed color from brown to 
purple when the critical level of total volatile basic nitrogen reached 20.53mg N/100g.
Khatri et al. established that chitosan films function polysaccharide bioreceptor for the detecting 
α-synuclein, and the receptor was very sensitive in their investigation [44]. As a sensing platform, 
a U-shaped fiber optic probe whose movement was restricted with gold nanoparticles and then 
chitosan was employed to functionalized. The interaction of amyloid proteins with this film results 
in a localized change in the dielectric constant around the nanoparticles, resulting in a shift in the 
spectrum at the fiber’s output end. To establish a robust sensing platform, the binding rate kinetics 
and intensity change were combined.
Nguyen et al. investigated the use of a new polyvinyl alcohol/chitosan-thermally reduced graphene 
modified glassy carbon electrode for the measurement of lead in aqueous samples using square-wave 
anodic stripping voltammetry [45]. Graphene was synthesized by an environmentally benign process 
of in a nitrogen atmosphere. Polyvinyl alcohol was added to chitosan to increase its electrical and 
physical properties. Subsequently, FESEM images were employed to the surface of the PVA/chitosan￾TRG composite to confirm its homogenous and well-dispersed nature. Electrochemical impedance 
spectroscopy and SWASV were employed for analyzing the electrode’s electrochemical properties 
before and after modification. The impacts of various variables like pH, time and voltage, and ratio of 
various constituents were examined in a systematic manner. The redesigned electrode considerably 
boosted the sensitivity and selectivity for Pb detection. The selectivity analysis demonstrated that the 
majority of common foreign ions had no substantial interference with the detection of Pb. Additionally, 
the electrode has been successfully used to detect lead in real-world water samples. The suggested 
technique enables on-site detection of Pb at trace levels in aqueous samples utilizing a simple, cost￾effective, and environmentally friendly process that does not need the use of sophisticated gear.
Glucose is necessary for the human body to function properly. As a result, it is critical to main￾tain control over its level. Lipińska et al. reported a research on a new electrode made up of titanium 
foil with Au coating nanoparticles, and further modifications were considered by using glucose oxidase 
with enclosed chitosan [46]. Initially, the Ti foil was anodized, then chemical etching is performed, 
which then resulted in the development of uniformly distributed inverted caps, after that Au nanopar￾ticles with a size restricted by the cavity dimensions are generated and deposited. Finally, chitosan 
and enzymes are used to alter the surface of the material, and immobilization of glucose oxidase was 
confirmed with FTIR. The electrode’s response to glucose was determined in 0.1M PBS containing 
a variety of interfering agents and biological fluids. The high selectivity and stability of the material 
encourage its use as the primary biosensor component. Additionally, no extra mediators were given to 
increase the activity of the enzyme. By and large, the suggested electrode material, owing to its supe￾rior performance characteristics, biocompatibility, and relatively easy manufacturing technique, shows 
promise as a candidate for glucose monitoring, particularly non-invasive and painless monitoring.
Developing an electroconductive and resilient hydrogel that can self-heal and recover from wear￾able strain sensors is an ongoing issue. Presently hydrogels exhibit a trade-off between static cross￾links and dynamic crosslinks for SELF characteristics. Heidarian et al. worked on developing a 
simple procedure for creating a dynamic hydrogel, by using starch/polyacrylic acid, ferric ions, 
and tannic acid-coated chitin nanofibers. According to our results, the toughest hydrogel (1.43 MJ 
m−3) with a 1wt.% TA-ChNF reinforcement has a toughness that is 10.5 times that of the unrein￾forced equivalent. The improved hydrogel was subjected to morphological and FTIR analyses [47]. 
The fracture surface of the pristine and TA-ChNF-reinforced hydrogels is shown in Figure 10.3. 
Additionally, the TA-ChNF-reinforced hydrogel at 1wt.% demonstrated the strongest resistance to 
fracture propagation and a 96.5% healing efficiency after 40 minutes. As a result, it was selected as 178 Polysaccharides
the optimized hydrogel on which the subsequent tests would be conducted. Self-adhesive hydrogels 
could be used in wearable strain sensors because of their unique self-recovery ability, network resil￾ience, and machinability [47].
Brondani et al. developed ionic liquid 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate-based 
biosensor for the purpose of determining adrenaline in medications using square-wave voltammetry 
[48]. Nujol was utilized as a binder in these biosensors, and a maize homogenate was chemically 
attached (provides peroxidase, which catalyzed the reaction of adrenaline to the corresponding 
O-quinone), using carbodiimide and glyoxal. The best results were obtained when peroxidase (7.5 
unitsmg−1 carbon paste), BMIPF6: Nujol in equal ratio by weight and 0.1mol L−1 phosphate buf￾fer at pH 7.0. Linear curve was there for adrenaline concentrations ranging from 9.89 × 10−7 to 
1.22 × 10−4mol L−1. These biosensors demonstrated stability and reproducibility and tests with the 
suggested biosensors recovered adrenaline in pharmaceutical samples at a rate ranging from 97.8% 
to 100.8%, and the results were consistent with those obtained using the standard method.
Chen et al. have developed an ionic liquid-assisted approach for producing chitin films with 
ordered microstructures [49]. Chitinvitrimer composites had an unusual two-stage stress-strain 
behavior, and their failure mechanisms were explored in terms of fracture mechanics. The com￾posites were found to be weldable and recyclable after the hot-pressing procedure. Additionally, 
because to the shape memory effect, the welded bilayer structure displayed a smart actuator func￾tion. A green and sustainable industry could benefit from the employment of dynamic chemistry 
and natural materials, thanks to this simple yet successful production approach. While chitin films 
cannot compete with synthetic fibers in some technical applications, the layer-by-layer construction 
technique is very efficient and avoids the problem of dispersion, which may be used to a wide vari￾ety of different polymeric composites. Additionally, this study demonstrates how dynamic chemis￾try and natural materials may be used in a green and sustainable sector.

10.3 CONCLUSION
There has been substantial advancement and development in cellulose and cellulose-based compos￾ites during the last 30years in a wide range of application areas. Cellulose as a sensor material was 
the subject of this review’s discussion. There were numerous sensors discussed in the article ranging 
from gas detectors to capacitance detectors to UV detectors to humidity and strain sensors. We were 
encouraged by the value-added potential of cellulose in any application, which is sustainable and 
regenerative. Sensors for energy research and technology have been proposed in a variety of ways. 
However, the technical features and performance of the sensors are still being improved. To fulfill 
the requirement of employing cellulose for more efficient sensors, more improvement of cellulose’s 
engineering qualities is necessary in order to increase cellulose’s usage as a sensor in energy science 
and technology. Because they are abundant polysaccharides, chitin and chitosan are readily available 
and biocompatible. In addition to their thin-layer formation capacity and abundance of oxygen and 
nitrogen, which can be used to chemically change the various properties to match the requirements, 
the two materials have several medical and technical applications. An issue with chitin as a biosensor 
component is that it cannot be dissolved in aqueous fluids at temperatures low enough to prevent the 
inactivation of biosensor recognition elements, and one possible solution to this problem would be to 
suspend colloidal chitin in the preferred buffers for biomatrix formation on sensor surfaces. For chi￾tosan, the chemical reversibility of hydrogel film production may provide difficulties when exposed 
to fluids with a low enough pH to induce substantial reprotonation of the amine groups, resulting in 
unfavorable internal matrix conversion and/or loss of surface adherence and exfoliation.

11.1 INTRODUCTION
Biopolymers are interconnected chains of biodegradable monomers primarily produced by living 
entities. The lion’s share of these producers are microorganisms, plant biomass, or agro-wastes. 
Chemically synthesized substrates from biological sources like vegetable oil, sugar, fat, protein, 
etc., also fall under this category. Major components of most biopolymers include proteins, fats, 
nucleotides, and polysaccharides [1,2]. History suggests mankind have been using biopolymers 
since ancient time. However, the last few decades have seen a decline in their applications due to 
the emergence of less expensive and tailorable synthetic polymers. Nevertheless, in recent times, 
the realization of environmental costs and concern for the future has led to the re-insurgence 
of biodegradable polymers from renewable sources [3]. Moreover, renewability, availability, bio￾degradability, high absorption, and ease of functionalization have instigated interest from both 
academia and different industries. Compared with their synthetic counterparts, biopolymers dis￾play a more complex molecular arrangement with a specified 3D shape [4]. The nature-originated 
biopolymers are categorized as proteins, esters, and PSs biopolymers. Biopolymers can further be 
classified into three other broad categories based on occurrence and abundance. They are polynu￾cleotides, polypeptides, and PSs. The monosaccharides are linked via glycoside bonds to form PSs 
[2]. Variations in physicochemical and mechanical properties such as viscosity, gelling properties, 
interfacial characteristics, chain length, linkage variety, etc., allow PS to derive novel materials for 
a wide range of functionalities [4].
A powerful multifunctional biopolymer like PS can create high performance, value-added textile 
products. For instance, PS in the gel form can enhance the thickening quality of printing paste dur￾ing textile printing. Along with an improvement in the rheological properties of the paste, PSs like 
alginate and carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) accounted for better color fastness and hand feel than 
traditional thickeners [5]. Thus, PSs can be considered a suitable, environmentally friendly alter￾native to conventional thickeners. Textile substrate finished with PS will add functionalities to the 
textile itself. UV ray protection, contact angle and air permeability improvement, aroma generation, 
insect repellent, and microbial growth-inhibiting capabilities can be introduced [6]. Adding to that, 
PS’s ability to reduce, stabilize, and perform adhesion of metal nanoparticles (MNPs) with multi￾functionalities can enhance textiles’ performance. PSs like chitosan, alginate, starch, cellulose, and 
cyclodextrins can interact with silver, zinc, copper, titanium, etc., to introduce antimicrobial, UV 
protection, conductivity, etc. [7]. With the increasing health concern, textiles with the ability to repel 
micro-organism accommodation are becoming a popular area of research [8]. Biopolymers like 
chitosan, starch, and alginate have become crucial for many biomedical operations in the form of 
textile substrates, flexible films, or an antibacterial finish. Ease of modifications, controlled release Polysaccharide Applications in Functional Textiles 183
of drugs, and enriched biocompatibility have contributed to enhanced pharmaceutical applications 
of these PSs [1]. Furthermore, the synergistic effects of various complex structures can account for 
control, target, and delivery actions in pharmaceutical areas [9]. In wound dressings, bioactive poly￾mers containing functional components can show superior performance compared to traditional 
cotton gauzes [10]. The main advantage lies with PS being a versatile biopolymer that can introduce 
functionalities at multiple levels, making them unique compared to most other compounds. On 
another note, the textile effluent is mostly composed of unused dyes, auxiliaries, and other chemi￾cals. PSs, their derivatives, or modified PSs [11] as absorbent [12], flocculant [13], or coagulant can 
effectively remove contaminants from textile discharge.
Apart from being used as traditional textile raw material, PSs can be applied to textile industries 
in multilayers of application areas (as shown in Figure 11.1). This chapter is dedicated to natural 
PSs being used in various platforms to assist in the textile operation, adding functionalities and 
reducing textile waste. Starting with introducing the specific PSs involved with the targeted area, 
the chapter further represents a detailed overview of those PSs in action to improve textile print￾ing. It further sheds light on adding functionalities to conventional textile materials. It also covers 
various textile-based operations in the biomedical field. The chapter also includes a brief discussion 
on the PS-associated textile effluent treatment mechanism and a review of recent research works. 
Finally, the chapter concludes with accumulating challenges and limitations with the existing setup 
insinuating some directions for future researchers.
11.2 POLYSACCHARIDES FOR TEXTILES APPLICATIONS
An uncountable number of PSs can be found in the world. A few of them have found their worth 
in the textile application arena. This section talks about the specific PSs that are being used in the 
textile industry briefly.
11.2.1 Alginate
Alginate is one of the most commonly used PSs in the textile industry. It is a natural PS that can 
be found in the embankment of brown algae [14]. The most commonly used species are Laminaria

in 1881 while he was looking for beneficial products in the kelp [2]. Chemically, alginate is a poly￾meric acid that is constructed from two units of monomers (as shown in Figure A1). The two mono￾meric units are (G) and D-mannuronic acid (M) (as shown in Figure 11.2) [15].
Alginate is a naturally occurring PS, and it has some special features. The most important and 
notable features are high absorbency, biocompatibility, good mechanical properties, good breathabil￾ity, and nontoxicity [1617]. It has better properties for gelling and exceptional ease for modification 
and processing [18]. Alginate further possesses fundamental flame-retardant property [19]. Alginate 
as a textile filament is generally produced by using the wet spinning technique, where it is forced out 
in the form of a solution (sodium alginate) into a bath of aqueous calcium chloride [16,17,20].
Alginate in textile is used mainly for medical textile-related applications. It can immobilize 
enzymes or act as an assistance for bioactive molecules [16]. Numerous studies report its application 
in medical wound dressing [16–18]. Alginate can also be used to manufacture tissue engineering 
scaffolds and facilitate drug delivery systems. Textile finishing is a popular technique to enhance 
functionalities. In this case, various textile products’ functional and antibacterial finishing can also 
be done using alginate-based PSs [18]. Alginate can be incorporated into the textile industries in 
various forms, like, sliver, yarn, woven and nonwoven fabric, knitted fabric, crochet, braided, com￾posite materials, nanocomposite coating, finishing agents, etc. Good quality fibers are also manu￾factured industrially in mixed ionic form of sodium/calcium [16,18].
Scientists believe more potential applications of alginate-based PS are yet to be discovered. 
Among them, hemostasis and tissue repair is an important domain under development. Moreover, 
blended yarns made out of alginate have provided better strength and hand feeling [16]. It was also 
seen from a previous study that an aqueous solution of sodium alginate and CMC could produce a 
composite fiber with improved features [17].
11.2.2 Chitin and Chitosan
Chitin and chitosan are exceptionally convertible biomaterials having unique characteristics like 
recyclability, biodegradability, low price, etc. Chitin is ranked as the second most available polymer 
present on earth after cellulose. Biodegradability is one of the most useful features of polymers, and 
chitin is one of such polymers which will decompose after usage. It is attained from the shell of 
crabs, shrimps, crustaceans, and cell walls of fungi [14]. An amended biopolymer attained from chi￾tin is chitosan. Chitosan is basically a group of polymers extracted after the deacetylation of chitin 
to different degrees [21–24]. Deacetylation means eliminating acetyl groups of chitin and keeping 
only the amino group (–NH2). Hence, the prime difference between chitin and chitosan (as shown 
in Figure 11.3) is the acetyl content of the polymer [21,24].
Bioactive and natural PS chitin and chitosan are used in several textile fields, especially in medi￾cal textile and functional finishing. It is used in biomedical applications like tissue repairing, healing 
wounds, and producing scaffolds [14]. Different functional finishing and surface modification is done 
using chitin and chitosan. Antimicrobial finishing can be achieved by either attaching chitosan to 
the fabric or by preparing antibacterial fibers. Similarly, antiwrinkle finishing can be done by dip￾ping the fabric in chitosan solution by regular dipping-rolling-baking process, which reinforces the 
amorphous regions of the fibers and reduces the mobility [14,25]. Another special finish is antistatic 
FIGURE 11.2 Chemical structure of alginate.Polysaccharide Applications in Functional Textiles 185
finishing to produce antistatic workwear for the employees working in industrial fields and using 
sophisticated electric instruments. Dyeing is one of the most crucial processes in the textile industry. 
Chitosan is used for the degeneration of the dye effluents. It is also a flawless agent for dye fixation for 
anionic dyes as it minimizes the Coulomb repulsion between the anionic dyes and the fiber [25,26].
11.2.3 Starch
Starch is a well known polysaccharide consisting of monomers of glucose joined in α-1,4-linkages. It is 
an organic chemical which is white in color and generated by all types of green plants. It is insoluble in 
alcohol and cold water. The general chemical formula of starch is (C6H10O5)n [27]. The major sources 
of starch are cassava, corn, wheat, sweet potato, and potato. Minor sources of starch are rice, barley, 
sorghum, etc. Raw starch generally comes up in the form of grains. The dimension and the arrange￾ment of molecules in the grains depend on the species of plants and the environmental interactions [28]. 
Egyptians developed the main use of starch-based products and starch during the pre-dynastic era. 
Starch industry expanded extensively after the 19th century because of the growing needs from the tex￾tile and clothing industry, paper industry, and color printing. The ability of starch to be converted into a 
gum-like material, dextrin, accelerated its demand [29]. Since 1930, different scientists have developed 
other starch-based products like waxy corn starch, corn starch with high-amylose, sweeteners, ethanol, 
amino acid, etc. [29]. Starch is composed of two polymers of D-glucose. Amylose consists of linear 
α-1,4-linked glucose, whereas amylopectin is composed of α-1,4 and α-1,6 links which are branched. 
Amylose and amylopectin (as shown in Figure 11.4) act for around 98%–99% of the entire dry weight 
of starch, while the other 1%–2% represent phosphorus, mineral, protein, and lipid [28].
Starch is widely used in the textile industry for sizing, finish, and print purposes. It is used to 
size warp yarn to improve the yarn strength and the abrasion resistance during the weaving process. 
It should have the ability to form strong films to provide a protective coating on the yarn surface, 
flexibility, and consistent viscosity during applications. Modified tapioca starch is suitable for these 
applications [29,30]. Starch produced from wheat is used to reinforce textile yarn [29]. Rye starch 
can be used as a thickening agent instead of potato starch. Pure starch fibers can be produced by a 
modified electrospinning technique, i.e., “electro-wet spinning” [31].
In the last 10years, fibers produced from starch-based materials by electrospinning process have 
exhibited prospects in different important fields like tissue engineering, wound dressing, and drug 
delivery. As the electrospinning of native starch is difficult as they have weak mechanical properties, 
researchers have developed various modified starch suitable for electrospinning [32]. Modified starch 
FIGURE 11.3 Chitin and chitosan chemical structure.186 Polysaccharides
fibers produced by the electrospinning process can be used in diaper, paper towels, sanitary tissue, 
biomedical products such as drug delivery, sustainable wound dressing, and scaffold of tissue [31]. 
Starch graft copolymerization is one of the most efficient methods to introduce desirable sizing prop￾erties in starch. This method can be improved to further enhance the sizing quality of the yarns [33].
11.3 POLYSACCHARIDE COMPOSITES
Two or more PSs together can enhance their performance significantly. PS can form various com￾posites with other materials (for instance, cellulose polysaccharide complex, protein-polysaccha￾ride complex, nanocomposites, etc.) also. PS-based composites have become a recent research 
attraction for biodegradability, renewability, and good sustainability. Some of the composites are 
listed as follows [34–37]:
i. Fish gelatin-polysaccharide composites: This composite has a wide range of applications 
specially in wound dressing. The foremost protein gelatin is produced by degrading col￾lagen. Nanofibrous structure produced from this composite is used in tissue engineering 
and wound healing applications.
ii. CuO-Chitosan nanocomposite: This composite cotton fabric is treated in a pad-dry-ther￾mofixation technique. The final fabric shows remarkable antibacterial reduction, which 
withstands 30 laundering cycles.
iii. Neem/Cs nanocomposite: This composite is used to treat cotton fabric to impart antibacte￾rial activity.
iv. 1-Hydroxymethyl-5,5-dimethylhydantoin chitosan: Cotton is treated with improved 
chitosan in BTCA/sodium hypophosphite using the pad-dry-cure technique. This 
improves the antibacterial functionality of treated cotton against bacteria such as S. 
aureus and E. coli.
v. Cs/Ag/ZnO nanocomposite: Pad-dry technique is used to treat cotton gauze with chitosan/
Ag, or chitosan/ZnO, or chitosan/Ag/ZnO. Fabric treated with chitosan/Ag/ZnO nanocom￾posite exhibited improvement in different characteristics of wound dressing, such as water 
absorbency, time of drying, or wicking ability.
FIGURE 11.4 Amylose (linear, helical) and amylopectin.Polysaccharide Applications in Functional Textiles 187
vi. Cs/ZnO nanocomposites (CZNCs): Using pad-dry-thermofixation, cotton fabric was 
treated. The treated fabric with nanocomposite showed antibacterial behavior and UV pro￾tection without hampering other physical properties.
vii. Cs/ ZnONPs, Cs/TiO2NPs, Cs/SiO2NPs: Cotton/PET blended fabric of two different fiber 
ratio (50/50) and (65/35) was treated using pad-dry-cure method. This treatment improved 
the antibacterial activity, self-cleaning resiliency, and UV protection properties of the fabric. 
viii. Ag/TiO2/βCD nanocomposites: Using the pad-dry-cure technique, cotton fabric was 
treated, and it enhanced the self-cleaning characteristics. The treated fabric also exhibited 
antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and improved crease recovery angle 
and tensile strength.
ix. Alginate microcapsules containing herbal extract: Cotton denim was treated using micro￾capsules and citric acid by drying and curing technique. Herbal extract and sodium alginate 
were mixed, and CaCl2 solution was sprayed to produce the microcapsules. It was visible that 
microcapsule enhanced the durability of the antimicrobial functionality even after 15 washes.
x. CuNPs/Ca-alginate: CuNPs/Ca-alginate treated cotton exhibited superior antibacterial 
effect, especially against E. coli bacteria, without impacting the mechanical properties of 
the fabric.
xi. AgNPs–alginate composite: The cotton fabric was treated using AgNPs–alginate com￾posite using the pad-dry cure method in the presence of a binder. The usage of a binder 
enhanced the wash durability of the treated sample.
xii. Carboxymethyl starch/polyvinyl-alcohol electrospun composite nanofibers: PVA was blended 
with carboxymethyl starch due to its nontoxicity, water solubility, and biocompatibility, which 
enhanced the spinnability of the solutions blended. Moreover, this solution gives continuous, 
smooth, and better-quality fibers. Starch-based electrospun fibers have potential applications 
in medical textiles, which are currently being researched.
xiii. PAFC-Starch-gp (AM-DMDAAC) composite: To be used in textile wastewater treatment, 
a polymer composite which is inorganic/natural named PAFC-starch-gp(AM-DMDAAC) 
(polyaluminum ferric chloride-starch graft copolymer with acrylamide and dimethyl dial￾lyl ammonium chloride) was produced. It was seen that PAFC-Starch-gp (AM-DMDAAC) 
gives better and steady dye removal efficiency. PAFC-Starch-g-p(AM-DMDAAC) can 
deduct by more than 50% compared to the conventional technique of coagulation-floccu￾lation for wastewater treatment of synthetic textile.
11.4 OTHER POLYSACCHARIDES
Other than the usual PSs, some other important PSs that have found their worth in various textile 
applications are given as follows:
i. Zizylphus vulgaris PS: Zizylphus vulgaris plant has been cultivated for almost 4,000 years. 
Polysaccharide, a necessary bioactive material, is present in Zizylphus vulgaris. It is one 
kind of complex heteropolysaccharide. Its unique biomedical benefits are protecting the 
liver, nourishing blood functionality, antioxidants, etc. A proverb says, “three Zizylphus 
vulgaris in solar eclipse will not show aging in one’s life.” There is a scope for producing 
sustainable wound dressings from this polysaccharide, which will improve the existing 
application of technical textile of polysaccharides in meditex [38].
ii. Psyllium PS: For a long time, psyllium has been used for curing various health-related prob￾lems like diarrhea, constipation, high blood pressure, and hemorrhoids. The principal ele￾ment of the seeds and husk of psyllium is a mucilaginous polysaccharide [39,40]. Psyllium 
polysaccharide-based hydrogels have attracted a lot of attention for their distinctive charac￾teristics like sustainability and biodegradability. This hydrogel can be used in various medi￾tex applications like scaffolds for tissue engineering and cell encapsulating biomaterials. 188 Polysaccharides
It is used widely as biopolymer-based wound dressings because of its outstanding water 
absorbency, biodegradability, and biocompatibility. Hemicellulose extracted from psyllium 
seed husk (PSH) is Arabinoxylan, and it is also used in biomedical applications. The healing 
property of these gels was improved by mixing gelatin with Arabinoxylan. Arabinoxylan, 
gelatin, glycerol, and gentamicin antibiotics were blended to form AX-gelatin (GL) film [14]. 
Glycerol as a plasticizer facilitated the localized delivery of antibiotic gentamicin (GM) at 
the infection location. A high release of 89% of the GM in 24hours was recorded, and thus, 
it exhibited superior antibacterial performance to standard GM solution [39]
iii. Carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) PS: CMC is one of the most widely used cellulose deriva￾tives. It is nontoxic and obtained generally from softwood pulp or cotton linter. Cotton 
fabric is treated using carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) polysaccharide nanocomposites to 
impart antibacterial properties. Fumaric acid crosslinked CMC hydrogel was dispersed 
with silver ions and then applied on the surface of the cotton fabric. This FA is a biodegrad￾able and unsaturated dicarboxylic acid. The silver particles are distributed homogenously 
on the surface of the cotton in the size of nanoparticles. The resulting fabric shows excellent 
antibacterial properties for using this in medical textile as wound dressing [41]. Apart from 
the PSs mentioned above, some other PSs are found in nature on small scales. Table 11.1 
enlists some of the other important natural PSs with respective sources [42–47].

11.5 POLYSACCHARIDE APPLICATIONS IN 
MULTILAYERS OF TEXTILE ACTIVITIES
Other than its primary use as textile fibers in the textile industry, PSs have some other important 
roles to play. Specially for enhancing performance in textile operations like printing, adding mono 
and multifunctionalities (for instance, antimicrobial, water repellent, UV resistant, insect repellent, 
aroma finishing, etc.) to the existing textile substrates. The following section is dedicated to intro￾ducing various PSs for assisting in textile printing stage and adding functionalities to functional 
textiles in day-to-day lives and biomedical field.
11.5.1 Thickener for Textile Printing
Printing is an important textile operation that is applied for localized color placement on the textile 
substrate. Print paste is semisolid and thickener is an inevitable ingredient of printing paste that 
maintains uniform and even flow of the paste during printing [48–50]. The importance is reflected 
as they provide necessary plasticity and adhesion to the paste as it delivers design without color 
bleeding [48]. Rheological behavior is an important parameter of printing pastes for determining 
printing quality as it refers to paste liquidity, viscoelasticity, and thixotropic behavior [51]. The shear 
thinning during print paste application is observed as the applied force disrupts the paste structure 
allowing the paste to be pushed through and spread over the surface as intended design. As soon as 
the printing action is withdrawn, new entanglement forms and resists unwanted flow of paste [52]. 
Therefore, thickeners with good viscoelasticity property reflect good printing quality. The nontoxic 
and nonallergic nature of ecofriendly natural thickeners gets preference over their synthetic coun￾terparts. PS macromolecules have demonstrated high viscosity and good film-forming ability [53]. 
Most of the organic thickeners like starch, gum, or gelatins are polysaccharides [54]. Some of the 
other mentionable polysaccharides are carrageenan, methylocellulose, hydromethylocellulose, agar, 
etc. have excellent gelling properties. Sodium alginate (SA) was a widely accepted natural thickener 
as the containing -COO- group could efficiently migrate the dye particles from paste to fabric [55]. 
Carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), a modified PS, has also gained popularity because of solubility, 
film-forming character, and activity over a wide pH range [50]. Degree of substitution (DS) refers 
the number of functional groups [–OH] substituted by other groups in a PS derivative. Lower DS in 
many PS like CMC impacts the handle after printing [50].
Obele et al. reported CMC and cassanova stem waste cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) as thickeners 
for printing reactive dyes on cotton. The amount of CMC and CNC controlled the prepared print￾ing paste viscosity. The color fastness (change and stain) and handle comparison between the pre￾pared paste and commercial paste revealed almost similar results (change: 3 and 4, stain: 4, handle: 
soft) [50]. Li et al. compared various intermixtures of industrially used polysaccharide thicken￾ers (hydroxypropyl cellulose (H-HPC)/SA; H-HPC/CMC; H-HPC/hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC);

H-HPC/Guar Gum (SG-9) and H-HPC/carboxymethyl starch (SG-24)) to determine their transfer 
printing quality with reactive dyes on cotton and silk fabrics. The mixed thickener was prepared 
by generally mixing a second thickener with H-HPC in the deionized water followed by electric 
stirring and refrigeration. Reactive dye was printed after coating and baking the printing paper 
surface with this prepared paste. The result concluded H-HPC/SA showed the highest and H-HPC/
HEC showed the lowest result in terms of color depth; combinations of HHPC/CMC, H-HPC/SG-9, 
and H-HPC/SG-24 accounted for the clearest print sharpness; no thickener combination had any 
significant impact in declining fabric handle and color fastness [52]. An et al. further evaluated 
the rheological behavior of three types of PS thickeners (carboxymethyl hydroxypropyl cellulose 
(CMHPC), CMC, and SA) on printing performance with reactive dye. Wool fabric was used as base 
material for printing on. Separate pretreatment solutions of CMHPC, CMC, and SA were prepared 
and padded on the wool fabric surface before printing. The CMHPC sample showed the highest 
color strength (K/S value 28.4), lowest permeability (2.4%), lowest color bleeding, and therefore 
the highest color sharpness [53]. Parameters relevant to thickening are important to determine the 
thickening performance of a PS. Table 11.2 represents some PS in application as a thickening agent 
for textile printing along with relevant parameters.
Reusability is of great demand in this era. PS has the ability to reproduce thickening agent from 
the textile wastewater. Fijan et al. reported alginate, CMC, and carboxymethylated guar gum (CGG) 
PS-based thickeners recycled from concentrated wastewater. However, the performance in terms of 
viscosity, paste adhesion, and penetration was not as good as alginate or CMC-based thickeners [56].
11.6 ANTIMICROBIAL FINISHING
Textiles made from natural substances have the tendency to allow microorganisms and pathogens 
to grow because of their hydrophilic, nutrients containing nature, porous structure, and moisture 
attainment ability. Contact with human body while wearing those textiles provide the ideal scenario 
for those organisms to grow as they can draw the required nutrients ceaselessly [8]. Other organisms 
like molds and fungi causes damage, strength loss, staining, and discoloration of textile matters [6]. 
Attempts to hinder those growths with synthetic agents is limited by the non-biodegradability and 
polluting nature of the acting substances [57,58]. Hence, various polysaccharides like chitosan [57], 
their derivatives [58], alginate [59], and starch [60] have found their application in the antimicro￾bial textile furnishing. The anti-microorganism mechanism involves electrostatic interaction that 
causes alteration of the subject’s cell permeability. Consequently, the intracellular matrix disrupts 
to leak cytoplasmic constituents and hinder the normal metabolic operations ultimately resulting 
in cell death. The electrostatic interaction between the positively charged amine (NH3+) groups in 
cationic polysaccharides (such as chitosan) and negatively charged cell surfaces of bacteria, fungi, 
etc. is responsible for the effective antimicrobial performance (as shown in Figure 11.5) [61]. Thus, 
increasing the density of positive charge will enhance antimicrobial mechanism in case of cationic

PSs [35]. The polycationic nature of these PSs attaches efficiently to anionic microbe proteins [62]. 
Among other antibacterial mechanisms, protein synthesis, lipid peroxidation, degradation of endo￾toxin, and nucleic acid synthesis are worth mentioning [59,63]. Furthermore, PSs (SA) can also act 
as the anchoring polymer for antibacterial agents like quaternary ammonium complex (QAC) [8], 
TiO2 [59], micro/nanocapsules containing antimicrobial extracts [64], etc.
The antimicrobial activities of PSs can be regulated via alteration of parameters. For example, 
molecular weight, degree of acetylation, and pH can regulate the antimicrobial performance of chi￾tosan [66]. Table 11.3 accumulates the parameters relevant for antimicrobial performance mentioned 
in some studies. Apart from providing protection against micro-organism, antimicrobial agent inte￾grated textiles can exhibit rot proof, stain proof, odor proof functionality, etc. additionally [67].
Chitosan is a natural antibacterial component [57]. Both chitin and chitosan PSs are well known 
for bacteriostatic and bactericidal in vitro performances, while maintaining good in vivo protec￾tion against infections [68]. Alginate is another popular bioPS. It does not have antibacterial prop￾erty of its own but can demonstrate firm protection against bacterial growth by forming a barrier 
moisture transfer, oxidation, loss of flavors, etc. [69]. It has gained importance in providing a stable

deposition platform on textiles for other antimicrobial agents [70]. Starch has also shown similar 
activity of improving textile fibers adhesion toward antibacterial NPs and consequently enhancing 
durability of such performance [60]. Kudzin and Giełdowska recently developed antimicrobial 
properties on melt-blown PLA nonwoven textile by coating it with alginate and zinc solutions. 
Dip coating was conducted in two steps with alginic sodium salt solution followed by immersing 
in ZnCl2 solution. Antimicrobial tests against the gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus), gram￾negative (Escherichia coli), and fungal strains (Aspergillus niger van Tieghem and Chaetomium 
globosum) were carried out. The PLA-Alg-Zn(2+) composite sample with 39 g/Kg concentration 
of Zn showed inhibition zones of >1mm area for both the bacteria and <1mm area for the fungi 
strains [70]. Grgac et al. applied chitosan solution on the cotton and cotton/polyester blend fabric 
to develop durable antibacterial performance. Chitosan-powered dissolved in carboxylic acid (CA) 
and sodium hypophosphite (SHP) as catalyst was applied to the open structure of both the fab￾ric during mercerization operation. Experimenting with gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus 
aureus), gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli), and microfungi (Candida albicans), it can be 
concluded that cotton/chitosan and cotton-polyester/chitosan showed good antibacterial activities 
for both the bacteria. In terms of microfungi, no activity was recorded in for cotton/chitosan, 
but cotton/polyester/chitosan showed good results [66]. Kim et al. reported a PS-based SA-TSA 
(trimethoxysilyl propyl-octadecyl-dimethylammonium chloride) complex as an antibacterial 
polymer. The colloidal solution was applied on a preprocessed cotton fabric surface via pad-dry￾cure mechanism. The concentration of the applied SA-TSA NPs showed a positive correlation 
with bacterial reduction. An exposure of 8 hours at 100 ppm concentration allowed 75% and 90% 
reduction in the cases of gram-negative and positive bacteria, respectively [8]. In another study, 
El-Nahhal et al. functionalized cotton fiber with corn starch and ZnO NPs to impart antimicro￾bial ability. Starch was coated on purified cotton fibers in three separate concentrations and dried 
in vacuum condition. The starched cotton was uniformly coated with ZnO NPs using ultrasonic 
irradiation technique. Testing against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli revealed a sig￾nificant improvement in antibacterial activities, 50% and 21.5%, respectively [60]. Furthermore, 
sometimes, one antimicrobial agent cannot perform satisfactorily, in which case, combining other 
types of antimicrobial agent can provide better result. For example, silver (Ag) NP is a popular 
antibacterial agent which is difficult to be integrated with textile substrate due to their poor charge 
density. To resolve such situation, PSs like chitosan and alginate can be equipped noble metals like 
Ag, Cu, gold, etc. to impart a more effective performance [67,71]. This provides with the additional 
facility of immobilizing the metallic NPs along with enhanced antimicrobial performance [69]. 
Hence, composite antibacterial materials have been reported to show a better microbe cleansing 
[72]. Bajpai et al. reported a Cu (II) loaded alginate impregnated textile fabric with antimicrobial 
ability. The subjected cotton fabric was dipped into the SA aqueous solution followed by CaCl2
crosslinking and Cu (II) loading by immersing into the Cu (II) solution. The trapped SA on the 
fabric surface readily captured Cu (II) parts via ion-exchange mechanics. Higher concentration of 
Cu (II) solution resulted in greater captivation of metallic particle and therefore, greater area of 
bacterial inhibition zone [71]. In a similar study, Zahran et al. (2014) fabricated an AgNPs–alginate 
composite coated cotton fabric. Pad-dry-cure method was used to deposit and fixate the colloidal 
composite solution of the fabric surface. A similar result is observed as samples with higher con￾centration accounted for greater inhibition zones [69]. According to Mihailović et al., TiO2 was 
loaded on polyester fabric using alginate which enhanced the antibacterial performance remark￾ably to account for 99.9% reduction in the E. coli bacterial colony [59].
11.7 SURFACE MODIFICATION AND MULTIFUNCTIONAL TEXTILES
Functional finishing by coating, deposition, or spraying are popular surface modification princi￾ples for textile substrates. A variety of surface modification techniques are available. They can be 
categorized as physical (corona discharge, dielectric barrier discharge, neutron activation, laser, Polysaccharide Applications in Functional Textiles 193
ion beam and electron beam), chemical (enzymatic approach, sol–gel technique, chemical reagents 
treatment, surface grafting/polymerization), and microencapsulation [63]. Introduction of nanotech￾nology has introduced more sophisticated coating (aka nanocoating with thickness <1 μm) methods 
like plasma-assisted polymer coating (as shown in Figure 11.6c), layer-by-layer (LBL) self-assembly 
(as shown in Figure 11.6a), etc. [73]. Adsorption between oppositely charged cationic and anionic 
matters allows formation and adhesion of thin films or coatings on textile surfaces [74]. PSs being 
positive or negatively charged can easily form electrostatic interaction with oppositely charged sur￾face [72]. Chemical crosslinking (as shown in Figure 11.6b) is another technique that can be used 
efficiently to impart PS-based surface coating on textile substrates [58].
While being used for finishing textile substrates, PSs provide the opportunities to introduce addi￾tional functionalities like UV resistance, water resistance, insect repellant, deodorant, etc. Various 
chemical treatments to improve one property may instigate potentiality for multifunctionality. For 
instance, Cheng et al. performed a chemical modification to synthesize halamine derivative of chi￾tosan. Although the primary target was to enhance antimicrobial ability, the halamine structure 
apparently introduced and enhanced durable press finishing functionality [58]. Furthermore, nano￾structured biopolymer surface coating can introduce functionalities to textile surface [77]. PSs like 
alginate has abundance of carboxylic groups in its chemical structure, and this makes it a good 
modifier of textile surface by allowing enhanced bindings of NPs [59].
UV radiation is a major concern as it is highly detrimental for animal health apart from causing 
severe damages like discoloration, chalking, and mechanical degradation to textiles [77]. UV can 
cause skin damages such as sunburn, skin aging, allergies, cancer, etc. [78]. UV-resistant textiles can 
protect the human body from this bad radiation. UV resistance in textiles can be developed either 
by selecting the right textile raw materials or by treating textile surface with additives like titanium 
oxide, zinc oxide, carbon black, etc. This approach impedes the UV ray penetration by forming 
a layer on the subjected material. Reflection, absorption, or scattering are the typical reasons for 
showcasing UV protection behavior [6]. Dyeing of textile substrates further acts as reinforcements 
for improving UV blocking [79]. In order to protect textiles and consequently protecting the living 
beings from UV radiation, UV absorber biopolymers like PSs have shown great potential. Muzaffar 
et al. reported nanochitosan-PU (NCS-PU) based finishing of polyester-cotton fabric for introducing 
UV resistance performance. The PU extended with NCS was applied on the pre-dyed and printed 
fabric surface by pad-dry-cure method. The ultra-violation protection factor (UPF) readings for the 
applied samples were between 37.80 and 54.30 [63]. Ramadan et al. conducted a study on cotton fab￾ric with chitosan finishing to impart UV resistance behavior. Cotton fabric of multiple constructions

(shibeka, honeycomb, and crepe) was dipped into chitosan solution prepared with 5% acetic acid. 
The UPF characterization revealed that the UPF demonstrated a positive correlation with chitosan 
concentration regardless of the construction type. The maximum UPF reading was recorded 47 at 
6g L–1 chitosan concentration for crepe construction [6]. Mihailović et al carried out a research work 
based on polyester fabric functionalized with alginate and TiO2 NPs for UV protection. Desized and 
bleached polyester fabric was dipped and cured in 0.1% SA solution before immersion in 0.1M TiO2
solution. Primarily the UPF value and UPF rating of the fabric was 43 and 40 which excelled to 119.8 
and 50+ after the SA-TiO2 NPs treatment accounting for an excellent UV blocking performance [59].
Water repellency can be achieved either by minimizing the subject’s surface energy to the minimum 
or by changing the surface topography to multiscaled textured roughness. Nanoscaled formation on the 
surface also can enhance the contact angle to make it hydrophobic [80]. Polysaccharides have found 
their worth in this regard as they can be chemically modified to provide adequate sizes and rough sur￾face topography. Additionally, the mechanical stability can also be regulated in terms of dispersion and 
wettability. Ivanova and Philipchenko reported a superhydrophobic coating of chitosan on cotton fabric. 
Multiscaled layers of texturization were deposited on cotton fabric via spraying chitosan in nanoparticle 
form. The nanoparticles were formed by hydrolysis in lactic acid. The maximum contact angle was 
recorded 157.2 ± 2° for particle size of 63nm and rolling angle 14 ± 5°. Even after, 10 cycles of washing 
for 30 minutes, the samples demonstrated significant amount of water repellency [80].
Microencapsulation is a promising technique for incorporating and protective sensitive compo￾nents in textile finishing. PSs like chitosan 81], CMC [82], etc. have shown microencapsulation per￾formance. Most textile fibers are anionic facilitating the ionic affinity with cationic PSs [81]. Perfume 
and other aroma components can be incorporated more efficiently on textile surface by solid nano￾carriers. The major limitations with aromatherapeutic textiles are concerned with controlled release, 
losses by evaporation, and durability of the fragrance. The microencapsulation technique can provide 
sustainable solution [83]. PSs as the surfactant to produce stable microdroplets can very easily be 
deposited on textile surface via immersion, curing, grafting, spraying, printing, etc. [84].
CMC PS film encapsulating Citrus grandis peel oil (CGPO) and N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide 
(DEET) was studied by Misni et al. for insect repellency application. Interfacial precipitation tech￾nique was used to carry out the microcapsule formation. The flexible film encapsulated microcap￾sules were dispersed on a lotion base to apply on human skin. The experiment conducted on Ae. 
Aegypti females revealed the results that the formulation provided 100% repellency for 2 hours, a 
high 98.82% repellency for the next 4 hours, and a reduced 75.86% repellency after 8 hours [82]. 
Singh et al. studied fragrance and antimicrobial multifunctional textile finishing using chitosan 
citrate, β-cyclodextrin, and β-cyclodextrin/grafted chitosan. 1%–10% lavender oil solution with 
β-cyclodextrin, chitosan citrate, and β-cyclodextrin/grafted chitosan (β-CD-CS-L) was applied 
on cotton fabric via pad-dry technique. Six percent of lavender-associated β-CD-CS-L sample 
accounted for the maximum fragrance release rating after 72hours [85]. In a similar attempt to 
fabric multifunctional textiles with antimicrobial and aroma functionality, Cerempei et al. studied 
chitosan emulsion-encapsulated geranium oil. The chitosan dissolved in acetic acid solution was 
mixed with oil/glycerin emulsion before padding on cotton knit fabric with a 100% wet pick up. 
Controlled release of the core oil can be achieved as increased release over time with incrementing 
oil concentration can be observed. Contrarily, with the increasing chitosan amount, the oil chamber 
dimension declines, and therefore, release becomes more difficult [86]. Li et al. reported orange oil 
as fragrance particle encapsulated by acetic acid solution of chitosan deposited by spray drying on 
cotton and polyester. The orange oil showed encapsulation efficacy of >90% when applied at 1:2 
(w/w) ratio with chitosan. The storage stability of chitosan-coated oil was found to be much dura￾ble (lasted for months) compared with nonencapsulated oil (lasted only hours). Also, cotton fabric 
could retain the orange oil more than polyester fabric and more so with chitosan encapsulation [84]. 
Another functionality that PSs can offer to equip textiles is antiwrinkle finishing [87]. Table 11.4 
accumulates some more studies addressing PSs applied as printing paste thickener and finishing 
agents to introduce functionalities in textiles.Polysaccharide Applications in Functional Textiles 195

11.8 POLYSACCHARIDE-BASED TEXTILES FOR MEDICAL APPLICATIONS
The conquest for novel biomaterials in the medical arena is driven by emerging clinical com￾plexities and ever-growing economic challenges. For instance, the emergence of novel drug 
delivery alone is predicted to push the medical industry from $1,430 billion to $2,015 billion by 
2025 [92]. Biopolymers as textiles and flexible films have attracted much attention in the field of 
medical science. Textile-based transdermal therapy has gained popularity for the treatment of 
skin diseases [93]. Wound dressing is another topic that renders component to facilitate proper 
healing of the wounds. Natural biopolymers like PS have attracted attention in this area for 
many technical and economic advantages. A high degree of amino or carboxylic groups present 
in different PS allows better solubility, bioadhesion, and biorecognition with biological tissue. 
Further, positive and negative charges can attract mucosal layers and antigen agents on the cell 
surface [94]. Adding to that, availability, biocompatibility, and biodegradability make PS an 
ultimate choice for such operations.
11.8.1 Therapeutic Applications
Therapeutics mainly covers the biomedical areas concerned with wound healing, regulated drug 
delivery, and tissue engineering [95]. Textiles can be utilized as a stable, wash-protected tool 
for carrying the medicinal particles. These substances can be subjected to encapsulation inside 
PS-based enclosures and immobilized in donor layers on base textiles [96]. Thus, textiles in combi￾nation with drug careers can introduce a new evasive mechanism for effective drug delivery system 
(DDS). Natural PSs and their derivatives have been recognized in the medical field for their con￾trolled drug release behavior [11]. The stimuli (heat, perspiration, moisture, vibration, etc.) respon￾sive characteristics of PS can be exploited to facilitate effective drug release at various conditions. 
Stimuli-driven sol–gel transition is crucial for such functionalities [93]. Furthermore, highly porous 
network and well-dispersed structure can facilitate improved release characteristics of containing 
drugs [97]. The PSs capable of attaining the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) are better 
suited for controlled drug release as the upper critical solution temperature (UCST) attainable PSs 
much higher temperature than normal physiological temperature to change phase [93].
A textile-based PS nanoconjugate with dual-responsive (pH/temperature) drug release perfor￾mance was reported by Chatterjee et al. Gallic acid as pharmaceutical matter was loaded with 
hyaluronic acid-chitosan oligosaccharide lactate nanoconjugate hydrogel. Experiment conducted in 
pH condition mimicking human skin (pH 6.4) demonstrated good mechanical behavior and drug 
release. The synthesized hydrogel can be applied for the drug release application through textile￾based therapy [97]. In another recent study, Eskens et al. synthesized an alginate-methylcellulose 
(MC) gel as a career for epidermal growth components for skin regeneration application. The 
acquired thermoresponsiveness and viscosity were found to be suitable for both protective immo￾bilization and direct release behavior. A tunable and effective delivery system is thus formed [98]. 
In a similar type of study, Tang et al. synthesized a chitosan/MC/salt blended hydrogel intended for 
tissue engineering application. The effect of different types of salts on the gelation behavior was 
investigated, and thus the potential of the gel as an injectable matter for tissue engineering applica￾tion was evaluated. While applied as scaffold for tissue engineering, the gel accounted for good 
results in terms of cell viability and proliferation [99].
11.8.2 Wound Dressing
The primary functionality of a wound dressing is protection and prevention of further injuries. 
Alginate is a popular fibrous PS for targeted wound dressing application due to its enhanced wound 
healing performance along with high moisture adsorption and ion-exchange abilities [71]. The ion 
exchange between alginate and wound exudates forms a gel on the wound surface [69]. Wound 
dressings with antimicrobial functionality is also of special interest as they can bar microbial Polysaccharide Applications in Functional Textiles 199
infection on the wound and prevent bacterial impact of prolonging wound healing [86]. Some of 
the other important features the PS contains are good cytocompatibility, appropriate water uptake 
capacity, suitable water transmission rate, good mechanical stability, etc. In a recent study, Alzarea 
et al. fabricated gentamicin sulfate (GS) loaded SA flexible film with targeted application for wound 
dressing. Solvent casting process was incorporated to fabricate the film which included sonication 
to remove air, pouring on polystyrene plate and peeling off the film in dried condition. The film 
demonstrated >80% release of the GS within the first 24 hours suggesting very good performance 
against infection. The antimicrobial activity against S. aureus, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa further 
added to its performance [100]. Chitosan-based wound dressings have also become quite popular 
for cell viability and antioxidant capacity. Colobatiu et al. recently reported bioactive compound 
(Plantago lanceolata, Arnica montana, Tagetes patula, Symphytum officinale, Calendula offici￾nalis, and Geum urbanum extracts) loaded chitosan film as a functional wound dressing specifi￾cally for diabetic patients. The film was fabricated via solvent casting technique. Experiment was 
conducted both in vitro and in vivo (streptozotocin-induced diabetic rat model) conditions. The in 
vivo healing rate of both blank and bioactive compound loaded chitosan films demonstrated posi￾tive correlation with time (At 3-, 7-, and 14-days points, 29%, 61%, and 88% for blank chitosan 
and 41%, 81%, and 97% for bioactive compound loaded chitosan film). On top of that, the reported 
dressing provided a moist environment to allow proper hydration and closure for the wound [101]. 
However, in many cases, high hydrophilicity and low water stability may pose challenges for PS 
like chitosan. In such cases, combining with another PS like alginate may solve the situation. One 
such research work conducted by Sobczyk et al. presented a chitosan/alginate-based film that had 
properties suitable for wound dressing applications in terms of mechanical stability, absorption 
capacity, and water vapor flux. The film prepared by casting technique was loaded with oregano 
leaves (OR) or oregano essential oil (OEO) with superior pharmaceutical properties. Additionally, 
the film demonstrated antimicrobial activities against both Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia 
coli reaffirming its claim as wound dressing material [10]. Finishing of textile-based dressings and 
gauzes with embedded encapsulated medicinal components is also a topic of great interest nowa￾days. Antunes et al. fabricated a chitosan-based nano/microcapsule textile coating for applying on 
cotton gauzes. The 2 μm sized encapsulation contained antimicrobial peptide-Dermicidin-1-L and 
was capable of controlled release. Alternate LBL deposition was done with alginate and chitosan 
before functionalizing on cotton wound dressing by immersion followed by sonication. The trial 
with Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae revealed a remarkable bacterial reduction 
rate of 75.33% and 99.86%, respectively [102].
Metallic NPs contained and capped by PSs can facilitate wound healing up to an extent. For 
example, the noble metal Cu is known for promoting collagen crosslinking for the formation of 
bone matrix and immune-mediated inflammatory response for the burn injuries [103,104]. Ag salts 
in nanocrystal form have been reported to show excellent antimicrobial activities [105]. Table 11.5 
accumulates some more studies addressing PSs for medical textile applications.
11.9 POLYSACCHARIDES FOR TEXTILE INDUSTRIAL WASTEWATER TREATMENT
Textile is one of the most highly polluting industries of the world and is responsible for discharging 
a big volume of contaminated wastewater. The discharge may contain a wide variety of pollut￾ants, encompassing inorganic (heavy metals, nutrients, etc.) to organic ones (dyes, oil, synthetic 
fragments, etc.) [12]. A plethora of chemicals for instance, acids, bases, detergents, salts, dyes, 
wetting agents, finishing agents, oxidants, mercerizing agents, etc. are commonly found. Among 
them, mostly dyes, aromatic particles (such as phenolic derivatives, polycyclic compounds, etc.), 
and heavy metal ions are detrimental due to their toxic nature [109]. Dyes comprise the majority of 
the organic pollutants accounting for an approximate 700,000 tons outputs annually [110]. Heavy 
metal (metalloids with densities >5 g/cm3
) ions represent the most hazardous class in the inorganic 
category causing diseases and disorders as they are easily accumulated in the living cells [111]. 200 Polysaccharides
Salt of heavy metals is usually found in the mordents applied during textile dyeing [112]. Under the 
backdrop of anticipated energy and water crisis, PS may become both a viable alternative to the 
existing energy-consuming purification systems and a mean to establish recycled wastewater as a 
source for usable water.
11.9.1 Polysaccharide Adsorbents
Adsorption technique for pollutant removal from wastewater is well practiced due to its cost effective￾ness and technical simplicity. It offers additional benefit of removing contaminants present in very low 
concentration [113]. PSs have been explored well in recent years since they offer rich adsorptive ability 
besides being biocompatible [12]. Adding to that, an ideal adsorbent must be of natural origin, easily 
accessible, and modifiable, all of which are found in PSs. Porosity, surface area, surface charge, con￾centration, etc. are some of the drivers for good adsorption performance. Generally, wastewater con￾centration and contact time duration demonstrate a positive relation in adsorption activities. However, 
the adsorption is found to be faster at the beginning and slows down as time passes [109].
Adsorption (as shown in Figure 11.7a) is basically a surface phase transfer technique that oper￾ates via physical and chemical interactions of the participating elements. In other words, adsorbate 
matter is caught from the persisting phase on to a solid phase. Crosslinking may offer a good strat￾egy to produce such stable adsorbents. Functional groups like –OH, –NH2, –COOH, and –SO3H 
contained in various PS (chitin, chitosan, glycosaminoglycans, etc.) act as the adsorptive agents. PSs 
like chitin, chitosan being enriched in hydroxyl or amino functional group renders them suitable 
for such activities [114]. Chitosan shows greater regeneration and structural diversity (NPs, fibers, 
membranes, beads, gels, films, etc.), which makes its application area broader in versatile situations 
[115]. Another category of PSs (cellulose, starch, pectin, alginate, etc.) containing large amount of 
highly polar –OH and –COOH groups can effectively react with and modify groups like phosphate, 
amino, etc. as well as other water pollutants to facilitate a more efficient purification. Like chitosan, 
they also offer ample structural diversity [116–118].
Dragan and Loghin reported a composite bioadsorbent made of chitosan and starch-g-PAN (poly￾acrylonitrile) to remove Cu2+, Co2+, and Ni2+ HMIs from wastewater. Highly porous PS-based compos￾ite beads were prepared via cryogelation technique. The starch-g-PAN was dispersed in the chitosan 
solution followed by the formation of beads. The maximum adsorption capacity demonstrated by the

bioadsorbents for Cu2+, Co2+, and Ni2+ HMIs were recorded 100.6, 83.25, and 74.01 mg/g, respectively 
[113]. Bo et al. conducted a research work on synthesizing SA-based adsorbents to remove Pb2+ ions 
from actual wastewater. The SA adsorbent was cofunctionalized with melamine and polyethylenei￾mine via sol–gel process to enhance mechanical behavior along with polarity and chemical resistance. 
The adsorbent was added with the Pb2+ containing aqueous solution in a conical flask. A high Pb2+
capture of 596.68 mg/g was reported [118]. Wu et al. synthesized a carboxymethyle chitosan hemicel￾lulose resin (CMCH) to evaluate the potential to adsorb Ni (II), Cd (II), Cu (II), Mn (VII), Hg (II), 
and Cr (VI) from aqueous solution. Carboxymethyl chitosan (CMC) was thermally crosslinked with 
hemicellulose to prepare the final adsorbent before adding in the wastewater solution contained in 
conical flasks. The maximum adsorption capacities were found to be 362.3, 909.1, 333.3, 42.0, 28.2, 
and 49.0mg g–1 for Ni (II), Cd (II), Cu (II), Mn (VII), Hg (II), and Cr (VI), respectively [111].
11.9.2 Modified or Activated Polysaccharides
Modification or activation is generally done to introduce functionalities to any matter in order to 
enhance performance for a targeted application. Physical or chemical crosslinking, plasma treatment, 
grafting other polymers [11], immobilization on supports, etc. are some techniques worth mentioning.

In case of PSs, untreated adsorbents sometimes require additional alterations to enhance performance. 
Some PSs (e.g., chitosan) have been reported to have flexible chemical structures that allow particular 
modifications more easily than others (e.g., starch) [119]. Plasma treatment is a popular ecofriendly 
technique as it does not require any solvent. It basically generates moieties on PS surface (up to a 
few millimeters depth) to alter the physical-chemical behavior without affecting the bulk proper￾ties. The introduced moieties act as the particular anchoring points for the pollutants. Since oxygen, 
nitrogen, sulfur, etc. can offer a lone pair of electrons, plasma treatment on PS can be carried out as 
oxidation, amination, sulfuration, or in the form of coating (as shown in Figure 11.7b). Apart from 
increasing adsorption capacity, plasma treatment allows selectivity toward any specific pollutant [110]. 
Copolymerizing by grafting (as shown in Figure 11.7c) is another technique that allows the incorpora￾tion of desired characteristics without affecting inherent properties. PSs can be modified by grafting 
other components with radical initiators using various elements and techniques like initiators, vinyl 
monomers, oxidizing agents, radiation technique, etc. [11,120]. Different surface adsorbents like acti￾vated carbons, carbon nanotubes, graphene oxides, etc. can easily be grafted on the PS surface for 
water treatment [121]. A big advantage of graft technique is the ability to regulate desired properties 
via percentage grafting [122]. Reactive groups in the PS structure can conjugate with other compounds 
like bentonite, kaolinite, oil palm ash, montmorillonite, polyurethane, zeolites, magnetite, etc. They 
are known for showing better adsorption capacity and durability in the acidic environment [119]. 
Nanotechnology has opened a whole new area for exploring the wastewater treatment techniques. PSs 
conjugated with nanomaterials are being studied to improve the wastewater remediation performance.
In a recent study, Nasiri et al. mentioned a PS-based adsorbent modified with iron-based par￾ticles to synthesize a novel magnetic adsorbent. The magnetic nanoadsorbent was made by graft￾ing CoFe2O4 and activated carbon (AC) on methyl cellulose (MC) PS for the removal of reactive 
red 198 textile dye from wastewater. The synthesis technique involved mixing metallic particles 
(FeCl3.6H2O and CoCl2.6H2O) in a 2:1 molar ratio with distilled water. After adding MC and AC, 
the solution was stirred, microwave irradiated, and dried to synthesize the adsorbent in the form of 
black precipitate. Experiment conducted on artificial and real wastewater revealed maximum dye 
removal efficiency of 92.2% and 78%, respectively. The specialty of such water treatment technique 
is the easy separation of the iron particles with an external magnetic field afterwards [121]. Kudal 
et al. synthesized a PS-based adsorbent by grafting poly(N-hydroxyethylacrylamide) (PHEAA) in 
pectin for the removal of a cationic dye (Rhodamine 6G) and Cu (II) and Hg (II) ions from aque￾ous solution. Further, magnetic NPs were diffused within the Pec-g-PHEAA to fabricate another 
PS-based nanocomposite (Pec-g-PHEAA/Fe3O4) adsorbent. Microwave irradiation and in situ dif￾fusion techniques were applied to synthesize Pec-g-PHEAA and Pec-g-PHEAA/Fe3O4, respectively. 
The adsorbents were applied in the dye (10–500mg L–1) and metallic salt (20–1,000mg L–1) solution 
by immersion. Pec-g-PHEAA demonstrated maximum adsorption of 43.5, 237.1, and 228.6 mg/g
for R6G, Cu (II), and Hg (II), respectively. On the other hand, Pec-g-PHEAA/Fe3O4 demonstrated 
a superior 57.2, 248.6, and 240.2mg g–1 adsorption performance, respectively [109]. In a simi￾lar study, Nga et al. (2020) developed multifunctional chitosan film adsorbent grafted with MgO 
nanoparticles to remove reactive blue 19 dye from wastewater. The CS/MgO film was prepared by 
solvent casting followed by mild drying. The adsorbent film demonstrated temperature depended 
adsorption performance. For applied temperature 18, 28, and 38°C, the maximum adsorption was 
recorded 408.16, 485.43, and 512.82mg g–1, respectively [123].
11.9.3 BioFlocculation or Coagulation
Flocculation is a relatively simple technique for removing components from a solution by aggre￾gating finely dispersed particles in to a large floc. This floc can be settled and separated easily 
[124]. Thus, flocculation has been applied in textile wastewater treatment for reducing turbidity, dis￾solved and suspended solids, dyes and auxiliaries, chemical oxygen demand (COD), etc. [125]. PSs 
are efficient flocculants among natural substances primarily due to their lower molecular weight. Polysaccharide Applications in Functional Textiles 203
Additional advantages of being stable, cheap, biodegradable, and reproducible make them a good 
choice [126]. Further, chemical modification can be done to enhance flocculation performance. 
PS-derived flocculants may act as the coagulating (neutralizing) or flocculating (bridging) compo￾nents (as shown in Figure 11.7d) depending on the nature of the pollutant in the wastewater [13]. 
Some of the major bioflocculants are chitosan, starch, xanthan, cellulose, alginate, etc. that are all 
PSs [125]. Charges in the cationic PSs may flocculate the anionic suspended particles in the waste￾water and vice versa [119].
Szygula et al. reported a chitosan coagulant-flocculant to treat textile wastewater containing a dye 
(Acid Blue 92). The dye solution was combined with chitosan solution and stirred following a prede￾termined parameter before filtering through a 1.2 μm filtration system. Interaction between the anionic 
sulfonic and cationic amino group in chitosan is responsible for sedimentation. A high intensity of dye 
removal (~99%) was reported at optimum condition [13]. Kono prepared water soluble celluloses with 
different DS. The cellulosic flocculants were derived by dissolving cellulose in urea/NaOH solution in 
the presence of 2,3-epoxypropyltrimethylammonium chloride (EPTMAC) reagent. When applied for 
the removal of anionic dyes, a great performance was achieved. For DS 0.56, 0.84, and 1.33, the yields 
were within the range of 65%–82% [127]. In another study, Pal et al. incorporated a tamarind kernel 
PS (TKP) based cationic flocculant to see the intensity of pollutant removal from a collected textile 
wastewater sample. TKP was mixed with N-3-chloro-2-hydroxypropyl trimethyl ammonium chloride 
(CHPTAC) and NaOH before stirring at 40°C–50°C. The flocculent was acquired by cooling down 
and precipitating the solution. When compared with a commercial flocculant, the TKP flocculant 
showed remarkably better result for various parameters [124]. Table 11.6 contains some more studies 
were PSs for removal of pollutants from textile wastewater were reported.

11.10 CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK
Apart from many inherent ecofriendly and robust properties, PS has many advantages to offer. 
Generally, lower dose of PS solution can facilitate dye removal by flocculation from textile waste￾water. On top of that, it is possible to recover flocculated PSs with a desorption efficacy close 
to 100% [13]. PSs can also be employed as fillers in the composites to enhance the mechanical 
characteristics of the adsorbents. High performance further allows chitosan derivatives to be used 
as adsorption additives [119]. Good reducibility characterized by various functional groups in the 
chemical structure enables PSs to be a great protecting and stabilizing agent for various NPs in 
different conditions [105].
Nevertheless, PSs have some challenges. For textile printing paste thickener application, PS with 
poor rheological properties may lead to comptonization with print quality [55]. In case of coating, 
surface charge variation of nanoparticles can have a negative impact on the durability and wet￾tability, particularly in the aqueous medium [80]. Further, uneven and porous surface may render 
difficulties during coating [73]. According to many other studies, due to the protection of lipopoly￾saccharides, PSs show reduced antibacterial intensity to gram-negative bacteria than gram-positive 
ones [72]. PSs have been reported to show better performances when integrated with NPs like TiO2, 
ZnO2, etc. [59,79]. Therefore, future scientists can look into this matter to exploit better performance 
out of PS. PSs may offer difficulties regarding regeneration and reutilization. Also, their mechani￾cal characteristics are not the best and may demand to be used in combination with other materials 
[138]. Chitin demonstrates poor solubility and thus offers low adsorption capacity during wastewa￾ter purification [12]. Chitosan shows similar poor solubility behavior along with instability in acids 
and sophisticated extraction procedure [113]. On top of that, weak binding strength with textile 
fibers has been mentioned in some studies [57]. Most of the crosslinking agents used for binding 
PSs (chitosan) like glutaric aldehyde (GA) and formaldehyde derivatives are harmful for human 
beings [66]. Despite being a good adsorbent, alginate’s application is limited by showcase of poor 
mechanical behavior, swelling capacity, and chemical resistance. Therefore, alteration of chemical 
structure and properties is carried out to provide proper flexibility and performance [118]. This 
mostly requires additional energy as well as chemical treatment. Achieving targeted performance in 
most environment is also a challenge. For example, chitosan shows antibacterial activities in acidic 
pH [6]. In the last few decades, an urgency has been noticed to find out sustainable alternative to

the day-to-day synthetic products. While the existing traditional materials can barely support, they 
cannot match the performance the synthetics generate. As the demand is on the rise, so is the pollut￾ants generated by these products. This can no longer be overlooked. Recent developments relating 
to PS and textile applications have proven to be a good solution to the problem, at least for the afore￾mentioned textile areas. Different options within the PS category offer different advantages or at 
least similar performance to the existing ones. The summary of the functional textiles also upholds 
the promise of PS to be incorporated more rigorously for equipping textile with antimicrobial, UV 
resistant, insect repellent, hydrophobic, etc. functionalities. In the field of biomedical, PS can offer 
both facilities of being biocompatible along with properties like antimicrobial and infection free. 
PSs can also be applied separately for the removal of pollutants via absorbency, modifications with 
adsorbent materials, and bioflocculation techniques, among others. Despite some limitations, recent 
findings show they can be commercially applied to some extent. Nevertheless, this area requires 
more explorations to seal the gaps which still persist with the mentioned applications.

12.1 INTRODUCTION
The increased value of food packaged with polymeric nanocomposite benefits both consumers and pro￾ducers. Using nanocomposite-based active and modified packaging, we can effectively increase the shelf 
life of food while preserving its early qualities and delivering them to consumers. Biopolymer modi￾fied with metal nanoparticles when blended with polymer frameworks improves quality characteristics. 
Thus advanced modification of sodium alginate (SA) can be achieved through monomer addition and 
irradiation (Rahman et al., 2016). Metal/metal oxide nanoparticles (AgNPs) are highly sensitive to acute 
temperature and exhibit low volatility and stability at normal conditions. They can be hosted in varied 
polymeric materials and stabilizing agents during polymer synthesis/blending. Ag-TiO2 nanocomposites 
have strong ability to act as antimicrobial coating that halts, especially E. coli colony formation.
Alginates are unbranched 1,4-linked d-mannuronic acid copolymers that have a stereochemi￾cal gap at C-5 and are found in around 1,500 species and 265 taxa across the world. An alka￾line extraction of sodium alginate results in the formation of sodium alginate as a solvent and 
the buildup of seaweed. Ion-exchange equilibrium with seawater-based treatment ions defines the 
internal structure of alginates (such as sodium, calcium, magnesium, and strontium). However, the 
use of nanoparticles on polymer composite dramatically improves qualities such as mechanical 
strength, aesthetic appearance, stiffness, oil and gas permeability, thermal stability, and electrical 
or thermal conductivity. Due to nanoparticles’ great effectiveness, just 0.5%–5% of the polymer 
material’s weight is typically utilized. So, the combination of nanoparticles with continuous moni￾toring of freshness is a major issue nowadays. Bionanocomposites based on sodium alginate are 
a promising material to develop novel packaging materials. In addition to reducing flammability, 
they also preserve the polymer matrix’s translucency. Packaging materials including nanoparticles 
as nanosensors could inform the consumer when a food has gone bad.
Intelligent packaging materials can monitor the freshness, quality, and safety of food products 
over the lifespan of an individual. Many researchers are working to develop smart packaging mate￾rials that are able to detect changes in the quality of food while it’s being stored.
12.2 ALGINATE: SOURCE, STRUCTURE AND CROSS LINKING
Alginates are 1,4-linked d-mannuronic acid copolymers having a stereo-chemical gap at C-5 that is 
not branched (Draget & Taylor, 2011). Chemical compounds function and reactivity depend heavily Alginate-Based Nanocomposites for Smart Technology of Food Packaging 213
on the presence of free hydroxyl and carboxyl groups. A variety of chemical reactions may be car￾ried out on the functional groups (–OH and –COOH) of oxidized alginates, which may result in 
the formation of gels. Polymers of various molecular weights can be combined to increase the gel’s 
flexibility. It is possible to assess the viscosity of an alginated solution by measuring its polymer 
content, MW distribution, pH, and the presence of G-blocks and M-block remnants in the solution. 
Alginate as an environmentally friendly food packaging material has the potential to be employed if 
meet the biocompatibility and biodegradability standards. Alginate may be found in approximately 
1,500 species and 265 genera all over the world, depending on the coastline variety and composi￾tion of the sea water (Lee & Mooney, 2012). Some of the species and genera that can be found 
are Ascophyllum, Ecklonia, laminary, sargassum, turbinary, and macrocystis (Davis, Volesky, & 
Mucci, 2003), and a fibriller structure is both present in the algal cell walls (Kim et al., 2015) of 
alginic acid salt. The content and sequence of polysaccharide monomer units of alginate are influ￾enced by a number of factors, including the time of harvest (Draget et al., 2002), the growth site, and 
the tissue age used for alginate preparation (Latifi, Nejad, & Babavalian, 2015).
The different mannuronic and guluronic acid (M/G) ratio varies significantly from 0.19 to 2.26, 
indicating that there are major differences in the makeup of species (Ramos et al., 2018). When 
selecting raw alginate sources, the G and M content of the alginate solution, gel, and biomaterials 
generated are important considerations since the characteristics of the alginate solution, gel, and 
biomaterials produced are dependent on the alginate material to be formed.
The science of sodium alginate is becoming increasingly obvious; in brown algae, the inter￾nal structure of alginates is defined by ion-exchange equilibrium with seawater-based treatment 
ions (such as sodium, calcium, magnesium, and strontium), which is determined by ion-exchange 
equilibrium with sodium, calcium, magnesium, and strontium (Pawar & Edgar, 2012). However, 
the ratios of mannuronic (M) and guluronic (G) acids cannot be used to calculate the quantity 
and size of these blocks for a given application of alginate composition and consistency. Because 
of the various saccharides conformations, the alginate polymer of the M and G chains is particu￾larly scrupulous. Homopolymeric portions (MMMMMM or GGGGGG) or heteropolymeric areas 
(MGMGMG) with M-blocks and G-blocks in alternating sequence (Daemi & Barikani, 2012), 
respectively, make up the chain (Morris, Rees, & Thom, 1980). The uronic blocks sequence such as 
MG >MM>MG lowers stiffness. The polymer’s chain lengthens and its inherent viscosity rises as a 
result of electrostatic repulsion between charged groups (Augst et al., 2006). When alginate was first 
discovered, it was considered that only the major G-blocks were involved in the formation of hydro￾gels, but subsequent research has shown that MG blocks are also involved in this process (Mørch 
et al., 2006). There has been a suggestion that the connection of extended rotational sequences at 
various MG/GM junction points reflects alginate gels’ contraction (Donati et al., 2005). It is impor￾tant to note that the choice of alginate material and crosslinking ion effects both the gel and ion 
binding properties of alginate (Saxena et al., 2022).
Although alginate are appealing for a variety of biological applications, they have limited 
mechanical characteristics when ionically crosslinked with divalent cations (Eiselt et al., 1999). 
Covalent crosslinking is used to compare the characteristics of alginate films to those of ionically 
crosslinked gels (Gasperini et al., 2014). This type of crosslinking is often shaped by the reaction 
between carboxylic groups (COOH) in alginate chains and a crosslinking particle containing nec￾essary diamines (Gasperini et al., 2014). The use of crosslinking reagents should be thoroughly 
investigated since a considerable percentage of them can be dangerous, and unreacted crosslinkers 
should be totally excluded. How the polymers are cross-connected immensely affects how stress￾relaxation acts in hydrogels. Stress is calmed basically by the breaking and ensuing renewal of ionic 
crosslinks in gels with ionic crosslinks, though stress is eased principally by the movement of water 
in gels with covalent crosslinks (Fan et al., 2011). Ionic crosslinking stresses cause the alginate gel 
to misshape plastically, yet covalent crosslinking causes a pressure unwinding that takes into con￾sideration extensive versatile twisting (Kong et al., 2002).214 Polysaccharides
It is possible to construct polymer network with a wide range of moduli by adjusting the chain 
length of the crosslinking particle or the crosslinking thickness (Gasperini et al., 2014). Polypeptides 
and polynucleotides are the most common synthetic polymers used in alginates, rather than bio￾polymers. The molecular weight of alginate is an average of the molecular weight of Na-alginate 
because of its dispersion. Due to short G-blocks, alginates include fragments of low molecular 
weight that do not contribute to the polymer matrix and hence do not contribute to its gel strength. 
When using alginate gel for high-tech applications, limited molecular mass distributions are rec￾ommended because of the risk of leakage (Draget et al., 2002). Sodium alginates are commercially 
available from 32,000 to 400,000g mol−1 (Lee & Mooney, 2012). In general, a higher MW leads to 
greater interconnections and a greater strength and viscosity of the mechanical gel. The use of high 
MW alginate can have an effect on the real characteristics of its gels. In any instance, an alginate 
arrangement formed from a high MW polymer is extremely thick, which is typically unfavorable 
in handling (Kong et al., 2002; Draget & Taylor, 2011). High viscosity hampers the pre-gel/cell 
phase to preserve cell viability as a high solution viscosity will cause cells to be exposed to high 
shear forces during mixing. Cell membranes are highly labile and can cause damage or necrobiosis 
through their mixture (Boontheekul et al., 2005).
Thus by regulating the distribution and the molecular weight, the pregel solution, viscosity, and 
postgelling rigidity can be handled independently. Gel elasticity can be greatly enhanced by mix￾ing a combination of different molecular weight polymers (Kong et al., 2002). So the addition of 
nanoparticle with carefully property modification and safety management alginate nanocomposite 
can be a possible alternative of traditional food packaging.
12.3 NANOCOMPOSITES
At the nanoscale, the combination of polymers with inorganic solids (ranging from clays to oxides) 
can result in the formation of nanocomposites, which are a type of heterogeneous or hybrid material. 
It has been discovered that their structures are more complicated than those of microcomposites. A 
particular property’s structure, composition, interfacial interactions, and component parts all have 
substantial effect on how that feature manifests itself. The preparation of nanocomposites typically 
involves in-situ growth and polymerization of biopolymer and an inorganic matrix. This is the 
most prevalent process. Because of the remarkable potential of these cutting-edge materials, they 
are essential to a wide array of industries, ranging from the most rudimentary to the most complex 
manufacturing facilities. In addition to their positive effects on the environment, these have the 
potential to user in a wave of cutting-edge technological advancements and open up lucrative new 
markets for a wide variety of businesses, such as those in the transportation and building materials, 
electrical and electronic, food packaging, and logistics sectors. The use of nanoparticles signifi￾cantly improves properties including mechanical strength, visual appearance, stiffness, oil and gas 
permeability, thermal stability, and electrical or thermal conductivity. Due to nanoparticle’s high 
efficiency, just 0.5%–5% of the weight of the polymer material is normally used.
The surface area of a nanoparticle may be compared to its volume to understand how different it 
is from its bulk counterpart. Because of this, the polymer material’s ability to hold nanoparticles in 
place shifts. This means that a composite can be enhanced by a multiple of nanoparticles. According 
to research, certain nanocomposites have a hardness of 1,000 times greater than their bulk polymer 
composite. Despite the fact that nanocomposites are becoming more and more prevalent, new uses 
are continually being discovered. Food packaging made from solid polymers, for example, may 
incorporate a broad variety of nanomaterials. As nanocomposite films that are both biodegradable 
and bio-based are being developed, there is a technological evolution that might compensate for 
some of the limitations of bio-based and biodegradable materials, for example, oxygen barrier char￾acteristics, with active biopolymer nanocomposite materials. As an antibacterial or antioxidative 
nanomaterial is added to the nanocomposites, it may potentially eliminate the deficiencies between Alginate-Based Nanocomposites for Smart Technology of Food Packaging 215
traditional plastic packaging materials and packed products in terms of shelf life, which is a critical 
factor in determining the quality of the product.
12.3.1 Alginate-Based Silver Nanocomposite
Silver nanoparticles are often used to functionalize polymeric materials for the purpose of bun￾dling because of their excellent antibacterial properties against diseases, germs, and parasites 
(Quintero-Quiroz et al., 2020). The antibacterial impact of silver particles and silver nanopar￾ticles is attributed to the activity of these particles. Because of the interaction between nega￾tively and positively charged elements of the cell (sulfhydryl or disulfide clusters of catalysts 
and nucleic acid corrosive), the deformation of bacterial cell layers and cell dividers develops 
(Butkus et al., 2003; Feng et al., 2000). The increased surface area of silver nanoparticles, along 
with a greater potential for Ag particle discharge, is the critical variable in the antibacterial 
activity of silver nanoparticles, according to the researchers. Supposedly, the free revolutionary 
produced by silver nanoparticles will cause damage to the cell layer of microorganisms (Kim 
et al., 2007). The development of silver nanoparticles inside the cytoplasmic layer of microor￾ganisms results in an increase in the porousness of the cell, resulting in the astonishing demise 
of microorganisms (Sondi & SalopekSondi, 2004). Silver particles combined with other inac￾tive materials like as zeolite, nanoclay, and silicate (Incoronato et al., 2010; Egger et al., 2009) 
have been used as antibacterial specialists. The substitution of Na particles with Ag particles in 
zeolites results in the formation of silver zeolites. It has a broad spectrum of antibacterial action 
against a variety of microorganisms, including yeast, growth, mycelia, and germs. In this way, 
it is used as a significant antibacterial treatment; yet, it is shown to be lacking in antimicrobial 
action when tested against heat-resistant bacterial spores (Fernández et al., 2010). According to 
the results of an investigation, chitosan/Ag-zeolite exhibits significant antibacterial movement 
against gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial strains (Rhim et al., 2006). Silver silicate 
is produced with the use of a fire splash pyrolysis method. The silver nanoparticles produced 
as a result of the use of these biopolymers have been shown to have antibacterial properties. 
Nanochitosan combined with metallic nanoparticles such as Cu2O, Mn2O, Zn2O, and Ag2O has 
been shown to greatly increase antibacterial activity against S. aureus, E. coli, and Salmonella 
choleraesuis. The antibacterial properties of silver nanoparticles stacked with starch and chi￾tosan have been demonstrated (Yoksan & Chirachanchai, 2010; Gupta & Tripathi, 2011). They 
are suitable for food bundling because of their material well-being and the extension in the 
timeframe of realistic utilization that these materials have seen (Tankhiwale & Bajpai, 2010; 
Zhu et al., 2009). There are a variety of factors that influence the effectiveness of antimicro￾bial workouts. Among them are the dimensions of the polymer network, the molecule size, 
the cooperation between the polymer network and the silver surface, the amount of molecule 
aggregation, the silver substance, and so on (Kim et al., 2007). A greater amount of absolute 
scattering of silver nanoparticles on polymeric surfaces is required for improved antibacterial 
movement. Copper particles have the ability to destroy infections and bacteria, and it is also a 
component of metallic catalysts, among other things.
12.3.2 Alginate BSilver-Montmorillonite (MMT) Nanocomposite
The antibacterial efficacy of polystyrene/silver silicate nanocomposites against S. aureus and 
E. coli is considerable (Egger et al., 2009). It is the exchanging of Na particles from ordinary 
MMT for Ag particles that causes the development of silver-montmorillonite to occur (Ag-MMT). 
Ag-MMT demonstrates strong antibacterial efficacy when tested against Pseudomonas spp 
(Valodkar et al., 2010). When it comes to delivering and settling silver nanoparticles, carbohydrates 216 Polysaccharides
including waxy and dissolvable maize starch as well as sucrose are used. Many aromatic essential 
oils have been combined with montmorillonite (MMT) in biopolymers, such as montmorillonite￾ginger essential oil (Yang et al., 2021), montmorillonite-rosemary essential oil (Krasniewska et 
al., 2020), and soy protein-montmorillonite-clove essential oil (Priyadarshi et al., 2021). Pires and 
colleagues investigated chitosan films that had been reinforced with sodium montmorillonite and 
infused with rosemary or ginger essential oils, respectively, as part of their investigation. The 
films were put through their paces with fresh poultry meat in packaging trials, and the results were 
promising. A reduction in lipid oxidation of meat was attributed to the inclusion of MMT alone, 
which the authors attributed to an enhanced barrier against UV radiation as well as a consequent 
rise in the meat’s oxygen barrier (Pires et al., 2018).
Incorporating essential oils into the meat, in addition to montmorillonite, just decreased lipid 
oxidation and did not limit microbial development on the meat, according to the researchers (Dakal 
et al., 2016). The authors have also been investigated for their antibacterial characteristics in the 
perspective of the improvement of biodegradable materials, such as CMC/mucilage/ZnO (Siddiqi 
et al., 2018) and chitosan/cellulose acetate-phthalate/ZnO biocomposites (Shanmuganathan et al., 
2019). However, by mixing metal oxides with essential oils, researchers were able to achieve an 
extra antibacterial effect in numerous trials. The following are examples of such research conducted 
in the recent several years: alginate-ZnO-essential oil (Abebe et al., 2020), WPI-cellulose nanofiber￾TiO2/rosemary essential oil (Stoimenov et al., 2002), and gelatin-ZnO nanorods-clove essential oil 
biopolymer nanocomposites (Sawai & Yoshikawa, 2004).
12.3.3 Alginate-Based Titanium Nanocomposites
A polymer film of TiO2 nanocomposite coating was developed and tested on cellulosic paper 
in 2016. The biopolymer nanocomposite coating improved the mechanical qualities and inhib￾ited microbiological development on the surface of the paper packaging (Hajipour et al., 2012). 
Biodegradable coatings with chitosan integrating vermiculite nanoclay on a PET substrate have 
also been described (Youssef et al., 2015). Cost is a barrier to industrial adoption of biodegradable 
materials compared to conventional plastics. By reducing the quantity of biodegradable polymers 
necessary to achieve the desired qualities, nanotechnology may minimize production costs (Huang 
et al., 2019). Concerns about the biodegradability of biopolymer nanocomposite materials and how 
to adapt them for biodegradability need to be developed. Changing the crystallinity of various 
nanomaterials has been shown to modify the biodegradability and rates of microbial breakdown 
of biopolymers. The net chemical interaction between the biopolymer matrix and the nanopar￾ticles might alter biodegradation (Khan et al., 2019) (Socas-Rodríguez et al., 2020). According 
to (Mishra et al., 2020) achieving compatibility between nanofillers and biopolymer matrix, and 
finding suitable processing techniques for biopolymer nanocomposite materials are the key chal￾lenges to commercialization (Socas-Rodríguez et al., 2020). As nanoparticles are liberated from 
biomaterials during degradation, Souza and Fernando warned of environmental pollution and eco￾toxicity. It is unclear if nanoparticles discharged into the environment would bioaccumulate in 
the food chain or behave as pollutants (Khan et al., 2019). The release of gelatin ions, interactions 
with enzyme disulfide or sulfhydryl groups, DNA damage, and other cellular antioxidant activities 
of Salmonella, Listeria, E. coli, S. aureus, and Bacillus cereus are disrupted (Peighambardoust 
et al., 2019, Socas-Rodríguez et al., 2020). Silver-chitosan-starch inhibit the growth of E. coli
and S. aureus (Yu et al., 2022). Silver-chitosan-starch nanocomposite inhibit the growth of E. 
coli and S. aureus (Yu et al., 2022), Silver-PVA-typhimurium based composite (Kumar et al., 
2017) release ion and by ROS production and membrane failure disrupt Salmonella typhimurium, 
E. coli, and S. aureus (Bar-Ilan et al., 2009), TiO2 enriched chitosan nanocomposite inhibit the 
growth of E. coli and S. aureus, Bacillus sp., Lactobacillus platarum, Erwinia caratovora, Pichia 
jadini, and Pseudomonas fluorescens are inactivated by polypropylene-TiO2 nanocomposites 
(Peighambardoust et al., 2019; Osman et al. 2010), TiO2-LDPE nanocmpositeprevent the growth Alginate-Based Nanocomposites for Smart Technology of Food Packaging 217
of E. coli and Pseudomonas spp. (Kiss et al., 2008), CuO-LDPE disrupt key bacterial enzymes. 
Proton motive force, electron movement, energy control, or structural component production are 
all disrupted when essential oils (EO) and their active components interact with proteins and 
enzymes in the cell membrane of E. coli and S. aureus (Hua et al., 2021; Pavlicek et al., 2021; Van 
der Meulen et al., 2014).
The reaction mechanism of the silver-titanium dioxide (Ag/TiO2) nanocomposite films with 
food matrix has been given in (Figure 12.2). The composite films provide antibacterial protection 
for carbohydrate, fat, or protein content of dietary products via photocatalytic interaction with 
biodegradable and active polymeric matrices for food packaging TiO2/AgNPs. These nanoparticles 
release particular active species over sunlight (Rahman et al., 2022). A variety of metal oxides have 
been shown to exhibit antibacterial characteristics, including MgO, ZnO, and TiO2. Antibacterial 
packaging films may be manufactured using these oxides because of their excellent stability and 
strong antimicrobial properties (Zhang et al., 2010). The antimicrobial mechanism of these oxides 
is related to the formation of very reactive oxygen species when exposure to UV radiation, wherein 
these oxides exhibit photocatalytic activity (Dong et al., 2013; Applerot et al., 2009). Zinc oxide 
nanoparticle-coated glass has been shown to have antibacterial properties against both gram￾positive and gram-negative microorganisms (Applerot et al., 2009). Antibacterial activity against 
several germs or microbes is one of the distinctive qualities of TiO2 that has made this substance 
particularly valuable in a wide range of industries, including paint, cosmetics, food, and food 
packaging products (Fujishima et al., 2000). Still, owing to its low photon-utilizing capacity and 
the necessity for an excitation source, this technology has limited practical utility (UV light). The 
antibacterial property of TiO2 can be improved by doping it with metal oxides (SnO2, Ag, or Fe3) 
FIGURE 12.1 Sodium alginate-based silver-doped titanium nanocomposite film.218 Polysaccharides
or metal ions (such as SnO2, Ag, or Fe3+) (Zhang et al., 2008). Microorganisms that cause food 
poisoning are better protected by polymeric packaging made of TiO2-based oxides. Even when 
subjected to light with shorter wavelengths near the UV zone, it retains its stain, allergy, odor, 
and degradation resistance qualities. TiO2 thin film may be prepared using a variety of methods, 
including magnetron sputtering, chemical vapor deposition, chemical spray pyrolysis, sol-gel pro￾cess, evaporation, and electrodeposition. Using the sol-gel approach, a thin coating of very pure 
composite material may be produced in a single operation (Celik et al., 2006). Adding titanium 
dioxide (TiO2) to the packing material increased mechanical and chemical stability in both the IR 
and visible ranges. These materials are also more biodegradable.

12.4 ALGINATE-BASED NANOCOMPOSITES 
APPLICATIONS IN SMART TECHNOLOGY
A growing trend in the food industry and the use of intelligent packaging (IP) and active packaging 
(AP) is increasing day by day. Through absorbing and diffusion systems, AP helps to extend the shelf 
life of food products. There are several important factors to consider when producing a food product, 
including cost, marketability, consumer acceptability, food safety, and organoleptic quality. Alginates 
may provide answers to many of the problems that are currently afflicting humanity and will likely 
occur in the near future. The biocompatibility of alginates, along with their availability and simplicity 
of preparation, play significant roles in their widespread use. Research into novel alginate-based mate￾rials with expanded capabilities and clearly defined features is necessary to meet the needs of specific 
application domains. The use of food packaging is one of the most important strategies for preserving 
and maintaining the quality of food. Food companies are rapidly incorporating new technology into 
their operations, such as intelligent packaging (IP) and AP. The use of IP systems in the food packag￾ing environment improves the level of safety and the ability to issue warnings about potential risks. In 
2024, the packaging industry in the United States is predicted to produce $6 billion in AP income and 
$3.45 billion in IP revenue, according to forecasts from the International Packaging Institute (Nano￾enabled Packaging Market report). If existing packaging technologies (AP and IP) are to be used 
properly in the food industry, there are knowledge gaps that must be fulfilled.
12.4.1 Intelligent Packaging Technology
Intelligent packaging technology is a type of packaging that is designed to be environmentally 
friendly. IP is a new technology in the food packaging field. It has the potential to significantly 
enhance the traceability, safety, and nutritional value of food. Specifically, IP is defined as the sci￾ence and technology that introduces communication tools for a food packaging system to monitor 
changes in the internal and external environmental conditions of the system, as well as changes in 
the packaged food, in order to communicate the status of a system to stakeholders in supply chains, 
such as producers and retailers, as well as consumers (Yam, 2012). IP supports decision-making, 
improves safety, and contributes to the improvement of quality by giving information, and alerting 
users to possible issues. An important feature of IP is the use of sensing and identification systems 
to provide information to the public about the composition of foodstuffs (Dekker et al., 2014).
12.4.1.1 Time Temperature Indicator (TTI)
Indicator films suitable for use in intelligent packaging have been fabricated using exclusively natural 
biopolymers. Simple and unobtrusive technologies, such time temperature indicators, can be put into 
intelligent packaging to alert consumers to any issues with the cleanliness and freshness of the products 
they are purchasing. Monitoring the long-term impact of temperature on food quality is done with time 
temperature indicators (TTIs). Food applications use both diffusion-based and microbiological TTI. 
In order to maximize the use of TTIs, it appears that an accurate model for correlating temperature 
changes with the rate at which a product rots is needed. Commercially available TTIs (9860 A-9860H, 
9861A, and 9864C) have a wide range of time-temperature thresholds to meet the needs TTI indica￾tors require specified activation energy (Ea) value in the diffusible material in order to work effectively.
The deterioration of food quality necessitates the rapid use of TTI measures. The TTIs are built 
on the principle of lactic acid vapor propagation. Lactulose is a monoprotic compound whose hydro￾gen atom is separated from the parent molecule by the acid’s hydrogen bond. When hydronium 
reacts with the dye (In) mixture in a gel matrix, the acid form of the dye (HIn) is formed. The 
enzymatic response, that is, color change, was shown to be associated with the cumulative effects 
of the time-temperature variations on the food product under investigation during storage. Hsiao 
and Chang (2017) also created a microbial TTI for vacuum-packed grouper fish fillets, which was 
published in Science Advances. A flexible microbial TTI system was developed by Mataragas and 220 Polysaccharides
colleagues (2019) using the microbe Janthinobacterium sp., which generates violet pigment through 
the synthesis of violacein during early development and may be used in a variety of applications. 
They used luminosity (L* factor) and Baranyi model to estimate the TTI endpoint.
Chen, Wang, and Jan (2014) suggested a low-cost colorimetric sensor array for detecting the 
freshness of chicken meat in a laboratory setting. During the next several years, it is projected 
that smart barcodes will become increasingly popular. The Japanese business TO-GENKYO has 
created a smart barcode that can be used to monitor the quality of meat. The sensors array had its 
own colorific fingerprint, which corresponded to the freshness of the chicken samples tested. TTIs 
based on diffusion are designed to operate across a wide range of temperatures and have a reason￾ably straightforward manufacturing process. However, the exudation of colored material has an 
influence on the accuracy and safety of such TTIs. Tekin and his college develop film by adding an 
extract of red beetroot (Beta vulgaris L.) that is rich in betalain to a mix film formed of alginate (A) 
and polyvinyl alcohol. This will result in the production of film (PVA). After spending a week being 
stored at temperatures of 4, 25, 40, and 60°C, TTI film was put through a series of tests to see how 
accurately it indicated color (Tekin et al., 2020).
12.4.1.2 Gas Indicator
Gas indicators can monitor alterations of metabolites such as CO2, NH3, H2S, and trimethylamine 
(C3H9N) as quality indices. They are able to accurately monitor quality changes of food which are 
not visible to the consumer. The main problem of using pH-sensitive dyes in the packaging industry 
is that the dyes are strongly hydrophilic. Lyu et al. (2019) developed a (BTB)/tetrabutylammonium 
(TBA+) ion-paired dye and produced a CO2-sensitive packaging film. During storage, metabolites 
like amines, aldehydes, ketones, and esters are produced as well as other low molecular weight 
substances responsible for off-flavors and sensory product rejection. Lee et al. (2019a) developed 
a freshness indicator for detecting chicken breast spoilage. The system was able to classify the 
samples into three categories: fresh, medium fresh, and spoiled. As the total volatile basic nitrogen 
(TVBN) content and CO2 increased due to the proteins breakdown by the proteolytic enzymes 
produced by microorganisms, the color change from yellow to green suddenly occurred at day 7 
and 4 at storage temperatures of 4°C and 10°C. The reduction reaction of platinum or palladium 
compounds can be applied for monitoring of ethylene gas. In such a system, molybdenum oxides 
are also used. This type of indicator is sensitive to UV light, other reducing materials, humidity, and 
temperature. Sodium alginate with calcium chloride can form ionic crosslinks. The pH indicator 
held up well against repeated washings even in moist conditions. Within a minute of introducing 
benzoquinone, the film’s hue shifted from one extreme to the other at a concentration of 10–20ppm 
of gases. Due to proton mobility, the color of colorimetric sensors changed from blue to yellow or 
yellow to blue when they came into contact with harmful gases revealed by MFC. Benzoquione 
facilitates proton transport. After 10 seconds, when the film came into touch with the hazardous 
vapors, the transformation began. In order to function properly, humidity is crucial. When humidity 
levels were high, its reaction time sped up.
Kim developed a dip-coated pH indicator-based film sensors. The main substrate was non-woven 
fabric wiper (WW-2109), and the polymeric binder was sodium alginate. Electron transfer agent 
benzoquinone improved reactivity. First, they mixed sodium alginate (1%), benzoquinone, and pH 
indicator (0.1wt%). The solution was used to impregnate prepared films. Then they were impreg￾nated with 10% calcium chloride. After making sensor, mass flow controller exposed harmful gases 
(20, 10ppm) (MFC). Spectrophotometer was used to chart E*a*b* every 5 seconds to monitor color 
change (Kim et al., 2016).
12.4.1.3 Biological Sensor
Devices that can detect specific biological analyses and transform their presence or concentration 
into electrical, thermal, optical, or other signals are known as biosensors. The primary distinction 
between chemical sensors and biological sensors is found in the first component of the sensor, Alginate-Based Nanocomposites for Smart Technology of Food Packaging 221
also known as the identification layer or the identification layer. A sensor that detects a change in 
the environment should mediate an irreversible reaction in order to be able to constantly monitor 
changes, which is especially important when the sensor is placed in a remote location. While the 
cost of the created biosensor should be reasonable, pricing is always a consideration. Some bio￾sensors, in order to detect a spoiling point, must come into touch with the product’s surface. The 
increasing need for packaged foods with a high level of safety has motivated academics and corpo￾rations to create biosensors in the intellectual property industry. The development of biosensors for 
the detection of food contamination, such as bacteria and poisons, has just recently begun. Research 
is needed to reduce the size of the sensor and simplify the detection methods. Yuan uses a biosensor 
based on sodium alginate, in which the synergistic increase in strength and flexibility is due to the 
strong hydrogen bond interact between graphene and SA. The proposed bio-based aerogels could 
be a strong contender in flexible strain sensors due to their combination of electronic conductivity 
and mechanical flexibility (Yuan et al., 2016). Kikuchi develop a sodium alginate-based biosensor 
to detect E. coli in human breast milk (Kikuchi et al., 2020).
12.4.1.4 Humidity Sensor
Electronic hygrometers are commonly used to make humidity sensors. Capacitance and/or resis￾tance properties that may be measured changes in response to variations in relative humidity. In 
recent years, wheat gluten has been employed for monitoring of the packed food’s relative humidity 
(Bibi et al., 2016). For their research in 2016, Gontard and Sorli used a thin wheat gluten protein as 
film as a model system. On the interdigital capacitor, sodium alginate a polymer that monitors rela￾tive humidity information and data collection (IDC) systems. In the case of packaged food goods, 
wheat gluten might be utilized to measure relative humidity levels. Using wheat gluten as a model, 
researchers investigated its capacity to interact with water molecules as well as its electrical and 
dielectric characteristics. The created system might be used in conjunction with radio frequency 
identification (RFID) systems to track and monitor the items’ movement and condition. In order to 
securely employ humidity indicators in food packaging systems, researchers are concentrating on 
cobalt chloride-free alternatives (Konstantaki et al., 2006). It has also been developed and produced 
several metal chloride-based humidity indicators. The downside is that they are costly than cobalt 
(II) chloride and are also potentially hazardous in some situations (Qin et al., 2014).
Sodium alginate and carbonized lignin (CL) were used to make a humidity-sensitive composite 
film (SA). Repeatability, stability, and responserecovery of the CL/SA composite sensor at room 
temperature were studied. Maximum CL/SA composite film responsivity is 502,895.40% at 97% 
relative humidity. CL/SA composite film humidity sensors have ultrahigh sensitivity, minimal hys￾teresis, and consistent repeatability from 11% to 97% relative humidity (Yun et al., 2020).
12.4.1.5 Barcoding Technique
In the seventh decade of the 20th century, the barcoding technology or automated identification 
(Auto-ID) technique was developed to enable major retail and supermarket businesses. Characters 
and digits are used to encode barcodes on items. Scanners use optical barcodes to extract data from 
barcodes, which are subsequently sent to a centralized system. Barcodes are widely used these days 
due to their ease of use and low cost. One-dimensional (or conventional) barcodes typically consist 
of a series of narrow or wide black bars printed on a white backdrop. If the space between the bars 
is too large, then the bars are too close together. Using milelong lines, barcodes are measured in 
millimeters. Authenticity is ensured by measuring the blank distances to the right and left of the 
barcode character. There are several one-dimensional barcode formats that are widely used in the 
supermarket, including UPC, EAN, code 128, and code 39 (American barcode and RFID report, 
2016). The 13 digits of one-dimensional food barcodes are typical. The first three digits of the bar￾code identify the country of manufacture (Manthou Vlachopoulou, 2001).
This barcode contains just around 2,953 bytes or 10–13 characters of information. A two-dimen￾sional barcode format was born out of the necessity to store more information on the barcode 222 Polysaccharides
(Hadjila, Merzougui, & HadjIrid, 2018). Intermec (Everett, Washington, USA) created the first two￾dimensional barcode format in 1988. This code’s structure is made up of a series of white and black 
squares. A total of 4,296 alphanumeric and 7089 numeric characters can be stored in two-dimen￾sional code. The most widely used two-dimensional codes are QR code, Data Matrix, and PDF 
417. For the first time, a three-dimensional code called PM code was introduced in 2006 by content 
concept of Asia (Kuwana-shi in Mie-ken, Japan). It is, in fact, a three-dimensional QR code, with its 
third dimension being the color of the code. To acquire both the UPC code and the quality condition 
of food, Chen et al. (2017) proposed incorporating colorimetric dye sensor arrays into QR codes.
A QR code that incorporates colorimetric dyes might be beneficial in tracking and evaluating meals. 
To help consumers to identify the quality, freshness level, or spoilage of the food that they purchase, 
smartphones, and mobile applications should be developed. Accurate food evaluation might be 
achieved through the use of machine learning algorithms in conjunction with picture processing 
techniques. However, the planned method was not implemented on a mobile app. To demonstrate 
the system’s capacity to create complicated geometric patterns using a polymer mold, they simply 
built a mold featuring circles, squares, and triangles. A micro-pipette was used to drop three dif￾ferent kinds of dye-contained micro-beads onto the stamp designs. At long last, the tape with the 
micro-beads was fastened to the filter paper (as protective covering and a barrier). Some users, 
however, find it difficult to make use of this technology, raising concerns about its widespread adop￾tion. Weber suggested an effective way of making barcodes using sodium alginate beds. Patient sera 
antibodies were used to examine the performance of barcoded beads (Weber et al., 2022).
12.4.1.6 Radio Frequency Identification (RFID)
To ensure the safety and quality of your food, RFID technology may be used to monitor the state of 
your products. RFID tags have a greater operating range than barcodes, and scanners may connect 
with several tags at once. RFID technology can make it easier to automate goods handling from ware￾houses to retail marketplaces. Products in the food industry and retail sector are fitted with an RFID 
tag (also known as an RFID label) for tracking purposes. Wireless signals are used to connect with 
the RFID reader on this gadget. Passive tags broadcast the signal in the same way as active ones, but 
they do so without relying on a battery. The sensor collects analogue data, which the CPU digitizes. 
The RFID tag may be found on the surface of a smart box called Mondi plus. NXP semiconductors 
(Eindhoven, Netherlands) has developed a wireless monitoring system for packaged food goods. For 
food manufacturers, intellectual property (IP) can help them better safeguard their products.
Organic and inorganic materials, as well as biosensors, may be harmful in TTIs, thus caution 
should be exercised while using them. Increased protection against data theft and counterfeiting is 
also necessary. System components used in AP include antioxidants, antimicrobials, and moisture 
controllers, as well as systems that absorb or emit CO2, release or absorb taste, and absorb or release 
CO2. Moisture may alter the texture, appearance, and microbiological activity of food products. We 
tested several methods for packaging and moisture absorber levels to see how they affected the shelf 
life of button mush. AP systems included various packaging films and four different moisture levels. 
Djatna suggested a nanocomposite of (Silver NPs—Reduced Graphene Oxide—Polyaniline) for use 
in RFID and its fabrication method (Djatna and Fahma, 2020).
In summary, the desire in developing new packaging systems owing to the safety and quality 
concerns along the food supply chain has pushed investigations on the IP systems and the com￾mercialization of such innovations. Compared to previous approaches, IP has the capacity to give 
safer and higher quality food items to customers. Applying the IP systems such as TTIs, RFID 
tags, gas indicators, etc. can give solutions to food manufacturers to safeguard food goods in more 
convenient and secure methods. Nevertheless, the pricing of the marketed TTIs is rather pricey. The 
accuracy of TTIs is another challenge that needs additional study to fix. The TTIs including organic 
or inorganic elements as well as biosensors may cause toxicity issues owing to the migration into 
food. For this reason, toxicological studies should be established for such systems to alleviate safety 
worries of customers. The biggest challenge impacting the performance of the freshness indicators 
is responding to unrelated metabolites. The biosensors are unique concepts that were just presented Alginate-Based Nanocomposites for Smart Technology of Food Packaging 223
in IP and more studies should be considered to address the hurdles in commercialization. The RFID 
systems are also pricey making this technology uneconomical for many food goods. Increasing the 
security of these systems against data theft and counterfeiting is also vital.
Further research on the IP advances will lead to further enhancement of the existing food pack￾aging technologies, and developing new and safe mass production techniques of the IP systems will 
alleviate worries about the widespread usage of IP in the food business. AP technology is defined as 
“packaging in which ancillary components have been purposely added in or on either the packaging 
material or the package headspace to enhance the performance of the package system” (Janjarasskul & 
Suppakul, 2018; Robertson, 2012). The key AP systems include oxygen scavengers, ethylene absorb￾ers, carbon dioxide absorbers/emitters, flavor releasing/absorbing systems, antioxidants, antimicro￾bials, and moisture controllers. The texture, appearance, and microbiological activity of food can all 
be affected by moisture. Preservatives, flavors, antimicrobials, and other additives can be found in 
gas absorbers and diffusion systems (emitters) now used in the AP industry. Recently, EO have been 
used to create active edible films with antibacterial and antioxidant characteristics (Al-Hashimi 
et al., 2020; Cai, Wang, & Cao, 2020; Li, Pei, Xiong & Xue, 2020).
The effectiveness of a multilayer film-based PET film with chitosan and alginate layers on shelf 
life extension and chicken breast meat quality was tested. It was determined that the AP film’s ability 
to increase the shelf life of beef was due in part to its properties, especially its release rate of anti￾microbial compounds. Citral (-CDCI) and transcinnamaldehyde (-CDCI) include bioactive chemi￾cals (-CDTC). Li et al. (2019) AP films based on polypropylene were created and their antibacterial 
and antifungal properties examined for food applications. The development of edible chitosan-based 
antioxidative and antibacterial films for use in food packaging has resulted in better specifications. 
Pistacia terebinthus plant extracts were used to create CO2 and moisture-absorbent pads that might 
preserve the quality of shiitake mushrooms Kaya et al. (2018). Sodium carbonate, calcium hydroxide, 
polyacrylate, and super absorbent polymer based Synergistic antibacterial polymer nanocomposites 
were created, and their ability to inhibit Escherichia coli growth in humus was established (Rhim 
et al., 2017). Thymol and carvacrol fish steaks in plastic pouches were tested for the effect of O2 scav￾engers and antibacterial film on increasing their shelf life. A few drops of pure essential oil of ginger 
with a variety of packaging methods was used to keep pig patties from oxidizing during high-pressure 
processing, such as vacuum packing, oxygen scavenger packaging, and rosemary-based antioxidant 
(AP). Carnosic acid and the extract of rosemary based on polyamide an active antimicrobial packag￾ing films have been developed by Bolumar, LaPena, Skibsted, and Orlien (2016) for a variety of fresh 
fruits and vegetables (Shemesh et al., 2016). Table 12.1 represent the change of indication factor over 
time for different food sample.

Research on the niger oxygen scavengers embedded in a PET matrix was tested for their effect 
on methanol oxidation in wine solutions at varying starting oxygen concentrations (1% and 3%). 
Oxygen scavengers designated 1osPET and 3osPET that are integrated into a PET matrix. In addi￾tion to Dombre et al. (2015), the quality attributes of button mushroom silica gel and spongy foam 
were evaluated using several AP systems, including diverse packaging films (clear PVC box and 
stretch PVC), and four degrees of moisture absorber at varying storage time levels. Karimi and 
Mosharraf are two of the most prominent figures in Iranian politics (2015). In order to find the best 
shelf-life conditions for button mushrooms, multiple AP systems, comprising various packaging 
films (stretch PVC and biaxially oriented polypropylene), as well as four levels of moisture absorber, 
were tested (Karimi et al., 2014). For the research of bread rotting induced by Aspergillus niger, 
active starch-clay nanocomposites were synthesized and studied for their physical and mechanical 
characteristics. Potassium sorbate in combination with cinnamon oil. Three Barzegars and one 
Azizi are included in this. Polypropylene ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer bags with antibacterial 
characteristics were created and tested for salad packing. A blend of citral and oregano oil (C10H16O).
Protein isolate and gum acacia conjugates (via the Maillard reaction) were used to make emul￾sion-based antibacterial edible films (Muriel-Galet et al., 2012). Grapefruit essential oil was also 
encapsulated. Films’ mechanical capabilities, water barrier qualities, surface hydrophobicity, ther￾mal stability, and E. coli inhibitory action were examined. Various regulatory bodies, such as the 
European Food Safety Authority (European Food and Drug Administration in the United States), 
have regulations and standards that must be met while creating and manufacturing active systems 
(Restuccia et al., 2010). To conclude, sodium alginate-based nanocomposite would be a possible 
solution for smart packaging of food to retain its functional and nutritional quality.
12.5 ALGINATE-BASED NANOCOPOSITES APPLICATIONS IN 
INTELLIGENT FOOD PACKAGING MATERIALS
Studies have shown that sodium alginate nanocomposite is a potentially useful material for food 
packaging. Improved barriers; mechanical, thermal, and biodegradable qualities; and uses in active 
and intelligent food packaging are just a few of the ways its usefulness in food packaging has been 
demonstrated. However, the decreased particle size of nanomaterials and the fact that the chemical 
and physical characteristics of such nano-sized materials may be substantially different from those 
of their macroscale equivalents may provide difficulties for the use of nanocomposites in food pack￾aging. Nanoparticles’ potential risks to consumers need to be discussed, and a detailed examination 
into their properties is required, in addition to the quantification of data. To demonstrate the pos￾sibilities of intelligent packaging materials in the foodservice industry, we have included a number 
of examples of their use in the following section:
Food packaging is crucial important. The materials needed to package the food have tremendous 
effect on the safety of the food. In this section, we have discussed how and which materials could 
be chosen to package the different kinds of food.
12.5.1 Seafood
Fish, shrimp, crabs, and lobsters, which include long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA), vita￾mins, and minerals, are a good source of nutrients for humans (Mohammadalinejhad, Almasi, & 
Moradi, 2020). Due to their short shelf lives, these foods are especially susceptible to chemical and 
microbiological degradation while being stored. The development of intelligent packaging materials 
to monitor the freshness, quality, and safety of seafood products over the lifespan of an individual is 
therefore of considerable interest. Among the many reasons why seafood deteriorates is the produc￾tion of spoilage products by bacteria that are mostly volatile components such as ammonia, methyl￾amine, dimethylamine, trimethylamine, and other related chemicals, together referred to as TVB-N Alginate-Based Nanocomposites for Smart Technology of Food Packaging 225
products. As a result of the production of these substances, the pH of stored seafood products 
is altered. It’s for this reason that many researchers are working to develop smart packaging mate￾rials that are able to detect changes in the quality of seafood while it’s being stored. Anthocyanin 
extracts from mulberries (pH sensors) have been trapped in gelatin/PVA films designed to monitor 
the quality of fish (Zeng et al., 2019). A change in color from purple to grayish purple to dark green 
in the film was a sign of fish spoilage, according to the authors.
To monitor changes in shrimp quality during storage, curcumin and sulfur nanoparticles were 
incorporated into the pectin matrix, and a pH-responsive film was then formed (Ezati & Rhim, 
2020). A pH-responsive color change in the film was observed as the shrimp’s quality improved. 
Curcumin and nanoparticles in the film were also found to have antimicrobial activity against 
E. coli and L. monocytogenes. Volatility sensors embedded in food packaging have been used to 
monitor fish spoilage, which were reported to give a linear response to ammonium concentrations 
of 1.5ppm (Bhadra, Narvaez, Thomson, & Bridges, 2015).
12.5.2 Meat
In the same way as fish produces large quantities of TVB-N and pH changes under the influence of 
microbes, meat does the same. Thus, smart packaging materials that monitor changes in meat qual￾ity during storage may be utilized in the same way for fish products. For example, pH-sensitive dyes 
in packing materials can be used to gauge meat decomposition during storage (Zhang et al., 2019). 
Other microorganism-produced volatile chemicals, such as hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide, 
can also be detected by intelligent food packaging materials. Silver nanoparticles coated with gellan 
gum have been used to monitor the spoilage of chicken breast meat in real time using a colorimetric 
hydrogen sulfide (H2S) sensor (Zhai et al., 2019).
Using the strong binding affinity of Ag for H2S, this colorimetric sensor produces a color change 
from yellow to colorless. Microarrays of an E. coli-specific RNA-cleaving fluorogenic DNAzyme 
probe have been covalently attached to food packaging materials for real-time monitoring of E. coli
contamination during the storage of raw beef (Youssef & El-Sayed, 2018). As pathogenic micro￾organisms are used to produce this type of intelligent food packaging, it may help to reduce the 
prevalence of foodborne diseases. Calcium alginate nanocomposite lowered shrinkage loss, drip and 
degree of off odor in beef, and also prolonged the muscle color (Williams et al., 2007). Gheorjhita 
utilized sodium alginate polymers, but they have since found widespread use in the food business, 
particularly the meat processing sector. Sodium alginate films are used to wrap meat items so that 
they don’t lose weight or become ruined by light and oxygen (Gheorjhita et al., 2020). Marcos and 
others prepared alginate nanocomposite that delay the growth of L. monocytogenes in cooked ham 
(Marcos et al., 2007).
12.5.3 Dairy Products
Milk, cheese, and other dairy products are among the most widely consumed foods in the world. Milk 
is an excellent source of protein, fats, vitamins, minerals, and other trace elements (Roy, Priyadarshi, 
Ezati, & Rhim, 2022; Roy & Rhim, 2021). It is widely available and enjoyed over the world. When it 
comes to storing pasteurized milk, it is susceptible to spoiling (Aloui & Khwaldia, 2016). It is possible 
to monitor milk quality in the supply chain using intelligent food packaging in addition to the usual 
packaging function. While pH, microbial concentration, and gas concentration will all fluctuate as milk 
spoils, the indicator effect is currently achieved primarily through the monitoring of pH changes during 
storage. The freshness of milk was checked by the color change in the packaging, which was made using 
pH-sensitive anthocyanins and pigments from plants (Li, Wu, Wang, & Li, 2021; Moazami Goodarzi 
et al., 2020). The freshness of milk may be monitored by adding shikonin to gelatin/carrageenan-based 
films (Roy & Rhim, 2021). Shikonin also provides antibacterial and antioxidant characteristics to the 
packaging. Milk quality can also be monitored by the use of various index changes in food packaging. 226 Polysaccharides
In order to monitor volatile organic compounds produced by decaying bacteria in pasteurized milk and 
predict the shelf life of milk, Ziyaina et al. developed a colorimetric sensor based on SiO2 nanopar￾ticles and Schiff’s reagent (Ziyaina, Rasco, Coffey, Ünlü, & Sablani, 2019). Another colorimetric sen￾sor for intelligent milk packaging uses polydiacetylene/zinc oxide, which changes color depending on 
the change in lactic acid concentration during milk degradation. In addition to milk, we consume a 
lot of cheese, which contains a variety of nutrients including fat, vitamins, and inorganic salts. For the 
purpose of monitoring cheese quality, Bandyopadhyay and colleagues developed pH stickers based on 
essential oil and anthocyanins, which not only ensured that cheese was safe to eat but also protected the 
cheese’s flavor from being damaged, making it easier for consumers to accept it.
12.5.4 Fruits, Vegetables, and Other Foods
Food bundling materials for natural goods, veggies, and a variety of other food items have also been 
developed with innovative thinking. A colorimetric film containing bromophenol blue (sensor) and 
embedded in a bacterial cellulose matrix, for example, was used to determine the freshness of the 
fruit of the guava tree (Kuswandi, Maryska, Jayus, Abdullah, & Heng, 2013). As the guava became 
overripe, the color of the film changed from blue to green, which was attributed to the production 
of unstable natural atoms (such as acidic corrosive) that decreased the pH of the film. To determine 
the freshness of green pepper, a pH-sensitive pointer named combining methyl red and bromothy￾mol blue (sensors) has been utilized to measure the pH of the pepper (Chen et al., 2020). When the 
pH is modified, this name undergoes a shading shift, which may be attributed to a variation in the 
carbon dioxide level in the bundle, which is linked to the deterioration of the green peppers (thus 
the  name “green peppers”). Furthermore, pH-delicate color marker names have also been used 
for the continual quality monitoring of Thai pastry “brilliant droplets” to ensure that they are of 
the highest possible quality (Nopwinyuwong, Trevanich, & Suppakul, 2010). Gheorjhita utilized 
sodium alginate polymers film as coverings for fresh fruits and vegetables (Gheorjhita et al., 2020). 
Sodium alginate with silver nanocomposite increase shelf life of carrot and pear (Fayaz et al., 2009).
12.6 BIONANOCOMPOSITES AND SAFETY
Due to a lack of scientific study, it is difficult to assess the hazards associated with the use of bion￾anoparticles such as nanomaterials, and numerous nanoparticles that are physiologically active in the 
human body when dispersed elsewhere in the environment. There is some debate as to whether or not 
nanomaterials with very small particle sizes are more likely to facilitate the transfer of nanomateri￾als throughout the human body than those with larger particle sizes because of the smaller particle 
size, but nanomaterials with large surface areas have a higher activity, which in turn allows for 
greater interaction through cellular membranes, in addition to better ability (Ray et al., 2009). It has 
been documented in the literature that nanoparticles migrate from the packaging to the meal (Boyce 
et al., 2011). Food packed with polymer nanocomposite packaging materials is a major concern for 
customers, who are concerned about the impact of nanoparticles on human health from the mouth 
all the way to the intestines if they are ingested orally (Silvestre et al., 2011). We need to know how 
nanomaterials affect performance in the human body if we are to use them effectively. A nanocom￾posite based on polymer and nanoparticles was shown to slow the flow of some potentially dangerous 
substances, such as triclosan and caprolactam, into the food six times over (de Abreu et al., 2010).
12.7 IMPACT OF USING BIONANOCOMPOSITES ON HUMAN HEALTH
In most cases, polymer nanocomposite’s beneficial qualities are well known, but the potential (eco-)
toxicological features of nanomaterials, aside from their effects on human health, have received 
little attention up to this point. The main obstacle to employing nanocomposites is the rapid spread 
of nanomaterials-based consumer items, which highlights the need for better consideration of the Alginate-Based Nanocomposites for Smart Technology of Food Packaging 227
probable biological impacts of nanoparticles (Bouwmeester et al., 2009). The effects of nanopar￾ticles on the human body and the environment are becoming more well known in recent years. 
Using nanomaterials can lead to new allergies and dangerous strains, as well as an increase in the 
adsorption of nanoparticles by the environment.
12.8 FUTURE TRENDS AND CONCLUSION
Bionanocomposites (like alginate-nanocomposites) represent an inspiring route for creating new 
and innovative packaging materials. By adding appropriate nanoparticles such as zinc oxide 
(ZnO-NPs), titanium dioxide (TiO2-NPs montmorillonite (MMT), and silver-titanium nanopar￾ticles (Ag-NPs and Ti-NPs), it will be probable for fabricating films for packaging have good 
mechanical, barrier, and thermal performance. They can reduce flammability significantly and 
maintain the transparency of the polymer matrix. Inserted nanomaterials into packaging materi￾als as nanosensors will alert the customer if food has gone deteriorated. Alginate-nanocomposites 
are a viable technology for “new” materials for near-future packaging applications, especially 
for flexible, fire resistance, antimicrobial, and transparent barrier packaging films. In conclu￾sion, the area of bionanocomposites as packaging materials still needs scientific research and 
improvement in order to develop the shelf life, quality, and marketability of diverse packaging 
materials. What is possible in the near future, design and incorporation of various required 
functionalities? Antimicrobial, antibiotic, biodegradable, and combination reactions to environ￾mental or chemical changes, for example.
Research on intelligent packaging (IP) still formative; however, it is intended that further research 
in this field would lead to more inexpensive, convenient, and environmentally friendly packaging 
options that will improve the food supply in terms of its nutritional value, safety, and long-term 
resilience. Moreover, bio-based nanostructure polymer nanocomposites might be developed in the 
near future. Look at nature’s examples of packaging, skins, and structures with specific processes, 
and imagine if we could make synthetic equivalents.

13.1 INTRODUCTION
Water is indispensable for life on the planet earth, and it is one of the global challenges for 21st cen￾tury to have pure and drinkable water [1]. Water treatment is a process used to remove contaminants 
from the polluted water. Contaminated water contains physical, chemical, biological, and biochemi￾cal constituents. Examples of physical constitutes of the contaminated water are solids, turbidity, 
color, salinity, order, etc. Chemical constituents in the contaminated water can be subdivided into 
three category viz. organic, inorganic, and gases. Carbohydrate, fats, and proteins are few common 
examples of organic contaminants in the wastewater. Various heavy metals, silica, and salt are few 
examples of inorganic contaminants, and hydrogen sulfide, methane, and ammonia are some of 
the examples of gases contaminants in the wastewater. Whereas microorganism (such as bacteria, 
virus, etc.) and plants (such as algae, grass, etc.) are common biological constituents found in the 
contaminated water. The presence of heavy metals, dyes, other organic compounds, microorgan￾isms, etc. are potential threat to the human life, aquatic life, and the environment [1]. Therefore, 
the elimination of various organic and inorganic toxic components from the wastewater is essential 
before it will be discharged to the environment.
Water treatment includes drinking water and wastewater treatments. Wastewater can be catego￾rized into two major groups such as municipal wastewater and industrial wastewater. Municipal 
wastewater include household wastewater from the sink to the sewer. Whereas industrial wastewa￾ter include waste liquid from various industries such as textiles, chemical, food, pharmaceutical, 
leather, etc. Depending on the type of industries, contaminants of the wastewater will be signifi￾cantly varied. Heavy metals and dyes are widely found contaminants in the wastewater. These are 
extremely harmful to environment and aquatic life due to their high toxicity and non-degradability 
in nature [2]. Depending on the source, water pollution can be categorized into two groups viz. point 
source and non-point source. Wastewater from industries, sewages, oil refineries, and power plant 
are a few examples for the point of source wastewater. Whereas non-point of source wastewater 
cannot be traced in a single discharge point and their contaminations are diffused across broad 
areas [1].
There are various water treatment techniques, such as coagulation, precipitation, membrane 
separation, oxidation, ion exchange, adsorption, activated sludge, etc. Water treatment method can 
be broadly classified into three groups, such as physical method, chemical method, and biological 
method. Adsorption is physical method of water treatment. Depending on the type of adsorbent, 
adsorption mechanism can be classified as specific adsorption, nonspecific adsorption, and ion 
exchange. Many of these wastewater treatment techniques have disadvantages like high operating 
and maintenance cost, etc. However, adsorption is one of the simplest, economical, and effective Polysaccharide-Based Adsorbents for Water Treatment 235
water treatment techniques [1]. Adsorption is a separation process by which substances from liquid 
or gas are attached to the exterior and internal surface of a material which is known as adsorbent [3]. 
For the wastewater treatment, the ideal adsorbent should be economical, easily available, renewable 
in nature, and opportunity to modify the adsorbent surface in order to remove wide range of con￾taminants from the wastewater. Polysaccharide or polycarbohydrates are one of the most abundant 
carbohydrates found in the nature. They are polymeric carbohydrate macromolecules consists of 
monosaccharide linked together by the glycosidic linkages. This chapter presents a review on vari￾ous polysaccharide-based adsorbents for the water treatment. The chapter focused on four major 
polysaccharides such as chitin, chitosan, starch, and cyclodextrin-based adsorbents for the waste￾water treatment.
13.2 CHARACTERISTICS OF WASTEWATER
Rapid industrialization contributed to the environmental pollution [4]. A wide range of wastewater 
are produced depending on the various activities. Discharge of these untreated wastewater causes 
significant environmental concern. Depending on the source, wastewater majorly can be classified 
into domestic and industrial wastewater. Major pollutants of domestic wastewater are nitrogen, vari￾ous heavy metals, phosphorus, detergents, pesticides, oil and grease, etc. [4]. With rapid economic 
development, increasingly domestic swages, industrial wastewater, and solid waste leachate are pro￾duced [5]. Characteristics of wastewater are influenced by the source of discharge [6–8]. For an 
example, wastewater from textile industries contained high concentration of organic and inorganic 
contaminants, such as salt, enzymes, microfibers, surfactants, residual dyes, etc. [9–11]. Not only the 
industrial discharged effluent, municipal wastewater also contains various emerging contaminants in 
the wastewater. Murphy et al. reported microplastic contamination in the municipal wastewater efflu￾ent. The source of microplastic is mainly from different personal care products which contain plastic 
beads. The study revealed different forms of microplastics such as flake, fiber, film, bead, foam, etc. 
However, two-thirds of them are flake microplastics. Their study also revealed different colors of the 
microplastics in the effluent and majority of them are red, blue, and green [12]. Contaminant in the 
wastewater can be categorized into biodegradable and non-biodegradable constitutes. Degradable 
contaminants include simple organic components, such as dead microorganism which undergo grad￾ual microbial degradation. However, non-degradable contaminants are inert to the biological action 
and do not degrade with time, such as heavy metals. Further, various constituent exists in the waste￾water can be organic or inorganic in nature. Industrial wastewater contains large concentration of 
non-biodegradable organic matter. Organic matter in the wastewater can be calculated as equivalent 
quantity, such as biological oxygen demand or chemical oxygen demand [13]. Other characterization 
of wastewater are total dissolve solid, total phosphorous content, pH, chloride, total nitrogen, order, 
color, temperature, total solids, total dissolve solid, dissolved oxygen, etc. [4,14].
13.3 ADSORBENTS FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENT
The term adsorption is simply defined as accumulation of substances on the interface of two phase’s 
viz. solid–liquid or solid–gas. The adsorption can occur through physical and/or chemical reaction; 
therefore, the process is physiochemical in nature. Substances that accumulate on the interface are 
termed as adsorbate, whereas the solid on which adsorbates are accumulated has been termed as 
adsorbent [15]. The process formed a film of adsorbate on the interface of adsorbent and fluid. In 
water and wastewater treatment, adsorption technique is used for the separation of dissolved impu￾rities [16]. Because of its simplicity and cost-effectiveness, adsorption techniques are considered 
as one of the most widely used wastewater treatment techniques. Different types of adsorbents are 
reported in the literature, and these could be broadly divided into six groups: natural adsorbents 
[17], biomass-based adsorbents [2], agricultural waste-based adsorbents [15], synthetic adsorbents 
[18], carbon-based adsorbents [19], and industrial waste-based adsorbents [20]. Adsorbents based on 236 Polysaccharides
activated carbon are widely applied for the treatment of wastewater [21–23] due to their unique char￾acteristics such as surface characteristics, surface functional groups, porosity, pore volume, pore 
morphology, etc. Adsorption process can be classified as physisorption and chemisorption. Pore 
morphology and specific surface are prime factors that influence physisorption, whereas chemisorp￾tion related to functional groups on the adsorbent surface [24]. A few key characteristics of a good 
adsorbents are as follows: (i) good compatibility with the adsorbate; (ii) high specific surface area; 
(iii) high adsorption capacity; (iv) excellent stability in the aqueous media; (v) able to regenerate; 
(vi) higher selectivity, (vii) low cost, etc. There are various process parameters which can influence 
the adsorption capacity of adsorbent viz. adsorbent dosage, pH, temperature, contact time, initial 
concentration of the toxic water, size and shape of the adsorbent, ionic strength, etc. [25].
13.4 VARIOUS POLYSACCHARIDE-BASED ADSORBENTS
Polysaccharides are a wide range of natural carbohydrate polymers that are joined by glycosidic 
linkages. Depending on the source of availability, polysaccharide can be categorized as microbial 
polysaccharide, animal polysaccharide, and plant polysaccharide. Animal polysaccharide contains 
a large number of surface functional groups viz. amino, hydroxyl, carboxylic, etc., and these func￾tional groups can attach various toxic components from the wastewater. Example of animal poly￾saccharide is chitin/chitosan. Metabolites of plant cells formed the plant polysaccharides. Examples 
of plant polysaccharides are starch, cellulose, cyclodextrin, etc. Microbial polysaccharides are 
extracellular polymeric biomolecules synthesized by microorganism under the metabolic process. 
Examples of microbial polysaccharides are xanthan gum, dextran, etc. [25]. Polysaccharides are 
widely used as adsorbent due to their excellent adsorption capacity, renewability, low cost, etc. 
Outstanding adsorption behavior of polysaccharides are attributed to several factors: (i) the pres￾ence of hydroxyl groups of glucose units, which enhanced the hydrophilicity; (ii) the existence 
of significant number of other functional groups; and (iii) excellent chemical reactivity of these 
groups, allowing for the modification of the polysaccharide surface by using other molecules [26].
13.4.1 Chitin as Adsorbents
Chitin is the natural biopolymer of acetylated and non-acetylated glucosamine. It is the second most 
abundant biopolymer available in nature [27]. It can be extracted from crustacean shells (shrimp, 
lobster, crab shells), which are waste product of seafood industries. The constituent monosaccharide 
unit in chitin are linked together by β-1,4-glycosidic bonds. Chitin is non-toxic, biocompatible, bio￾degradable, ecofriendly, low-cost material, and can be easily filmable/spinnable forms that possess 
adequate mechanical properties. Chitin is insoluble in water and alkali but soluble in mineral acid 
and anhydrous formic acid [28]. Chitin has been widely applied as an adsorbent for the removal of 
different impurities from the wastewater due to their nice porous structure and the abundancy of 
functional groups on its surface [29–35]. Karthikeyan et al. described the removal of iron (III) by 
using chitin as adsorbent. They have studied various parameters on the iron (III) adsorption capac￾ity of chitin viz. particle size, contact time, initial concentration of contaminant, dosage, influence of 
ionic strength, etc. Experimental results revealed that adsorption of iron (III) is maximum with least 
particle size of chitin, and adsorption increases with dosage of adsorbate and initial concentration 
of iron (III). Thermodynamic evaluation showed that adsorption is endothermic in nature, random, 
and beneficial [28]. Modification of chitin can enhance the adsorption of contaminants due to the 
higher number of functional groups on the adsorbent surface, increase specific surface area, mor￾phological changes, etc. [36–39]. Yang et al. present arsenic [As (III)] removal by using thiol-mod￾ified chitin nanofiber adsorbent. Nanofiber has dimension of 6 nm in thickness and 24 nm in width 
with a few nm in length. In order to form more adsorption sites for arsenic (III), grafting of cysteine 
has been carried out. Maximum adsorption of arsenic (III) was 149mg g−1 of thiol-modified chitin 
at pH 7.0, and this is significantly higher than the unmodified chitin. Significant increase of arsenic Polysaccharide-Based Adsorbents for Water Treatment 237
(III) adsorption by modified chitin is due to the higher surface area and abundancy of functional 
groups on nanofiber-based adsorbents [37]. Dotto et al. reported methylene blue dye adsorption 
by using ultrasound modified chitin. Ultrasound modification decreases the crystallinity content 
due to the rearrangement of chitins, as a result of more amorphous region for adsorption of con￾taminants. Microscopic images revealed rigid, smooth, and non-porous surface for the unmodified 
chitin, whereas porous rough surface for the ultrasound modified chitins (Figure 13.1). Solution 
diffusion through the pores of adsorbents increases the adsorption capacity [38]. Adsorption of vari￾ous contaminants by using chitin or modified chitin as adsorbents has been tabulated in Table 13.1.
13.4.2 Chitosan as Adsorbents
Chitosan is the deacetylated form of chitin. In the presence of concentrated alkali at high tempera￾ture, deacetylation of chitin is usually carried out [46]. Chitosan is a linear form of polysaccha￾ride consists of randomly distributed β-(1,4)-linked d-glucosamine and N-acetyl-d-glucosamine. 
It has been made from shrimp and other crustacean shell after treatment with sodium hydroxide. 
Major characteristics of chitosan are linear polyamine, abundant hydroxyl and carboxylic func￾tionalities on the surface, biocompatible, biodegradable, etc. The presence of abundant amino, 
hydroxyl, and carboxylic functional groups on the chitosan surface makes the biopolymer chito￾san the most widely used animal polysaccharide for the preparation of adsorbents. Chitosan is a

well-known biopolymeric adsorbent for the separation of contaminants from the wastewater, due 
to their outstanding characteristics such as renewability, availability of functional groups, cost￾effective production, biodegradability, biocompatibility, ecofriendliness, etc. [47]. Szlachta et al. 
reported chitosan for the removal of uranium from real mine effluent. Chitosan exhibits adsorption 
capacity of uranium because of the electrostatic interaction between uranyl ions and functional 
groups of chitosan. Maximum separation capacity of uranium by the chitosan was 17.44mg g−1 [48]. 
Chitosan can be modified with other functional molecules to effectively remove contaminants from 
the wastewater [49,50]. The process of chemically modifying the chitosan includes the attachment 
of various surface functional groups on chitosan, such as alkyl, carboxymethyl, phenolic molecules, 
etc. [46]. The processes modify chitosan without affecting inherent properties of chitosan. Few of 
the well-known methods for the chemical modification of chitosan are alkylation [51], acylation 
[52], sulfation [53], carboxyalkylation [54], etc. Al-Harby et al. presented novel uracil functionalized 
chitosan for the removal of Congo red dye. Modified chitosan contains free amino and hydroxyl 
active center in its main chains. 434.78mg g−1 was the maximum monolayer coverage capacity of 
adsorbate [55]. Chitosan can also modify by incorporating other compounds. Chitosan modification 
can improve stability, durability, and adsorption capability of various adsorbates. Xu et al. present 
novel granular adsorbents based on titanium and chitosan, which was prepared by using sol-gel 
method. Amorphous TiOx combined with chitosan by primary (C–O–Ti) and secondary (N–Ti) 
bonds (Figure 13.2). Adsorbents were studied for the removal of As(V). As(V) was adsorbed on the 
titanium chitosan surface by forming bonds with TiOH sites on the surface of the Ti-chitosan. Rapid 
small-scale column test exhibits adsorption of 165.6 microgram L−1. Arsenic in groundwater has 
been effectively separated by approximately 126-bed volumes [56]. Yang et al. reported glutaral￾dehyde crosslinked chitosan-coated Fe3O4 nanocomposite for the separation of methyl orange from 
the wastewater. Nanocomposite-based adsorbents showed approximately 98% removal of contami￾nants by adding 0.2mg of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide to form mixed hemimicelles, which 
increase the adsorption capacity of nanocomposite [57]. Hassan et al. reported chitosan/silica/ZnO 
nanocomposite for the separation of methylene blue dye. The whole process for the preparation

of nanocomposite has been depicted schematically in Figure 13.3. Hydroxyl and amino groups of 
chitosan and residual hydroxyl groups of silica play an important role in immobilization of ZnO 
in the network structure. Highest adsorption capacity of adsorbent was 293.2mg g−1 at the slightly 
basic medium [58]. Table 13.2 summarizes adsorption of various adsorbate in the modified chitosan.

13.4.3 Starch as Adsorbents
Starch is a natural polysaccharide extracted from various renewable vegetable sources and their 
byproducts. Recently, starch-based materials are widely applied as potential adsorbents for the 
separation of various toxic components from the wastewater [70]. Starch-based adsorbents contain￾ing amide, phosphate, amino, and carboxylic groups can be used to effectively separate various 
contaminants from the wastewater. Huang et al. reported novel starch-based adsorbents involving 
esterification with maleic anhydride and radical crosslinking with acrylic acid. The whole pro￾cess for the preparation of starch-based adsorbent has been depicted schematically in Figure 13.4. 
The adsorbents were applied for the separation of toxic heavy metals, such as Hg(II) and Pb(II). 
Adsorption capacity of mercury and lead ions were 131.2mg g−1 and 123.2mg g−1, respectively. 
Excellent separation capacity of heavy metals by the adsorbent is due to the interaction among metal 
ions and functional groups by physical and chemical means [71]. Haq et al. reported succinylated 
carboxymethyl starch-based adsorbents for the removal of phenol. The maximum adsorption effi￾ciency of phenol was 0.324 g g−1 [72]. Ren et al. reported amino-functionalized starch-based adsor￾bents for the separation of uranyl ions. Separation capacity of functionalized starch was reported at 
118.92mg g−1. Excellent adsorption capacity of adsorbents was due to the chelation and coordination 
between uranyl ions and –NH2 groups on the surface of the adsorbents [73]. Starch-grafted poly￾acrylamide copolymer reinforced with Fe3O4 and graphene exhibited excellent adsorption capacity 
for the Ni(II) ions. The maximum adsorption capacity of nanocomposite adsorption was 295mg g−1, 
which is significantly higher than that of the starch-grafted polyacrylamide copolymer-based adsor￾bents. The adsorption on the adsorbents occurred in three steps such as surface adsorption, intra￾particle diffusion, and equilibrium [74]. 
13.4.4 Cyclodextrin as Adsorbents
Cyclodextrins (CD) are cyclic oligosaccharides derived from the enzymatic degradation of starch 
[75]. The cyclic orientation of CD provides a truncated cone structure, which possesses hydrophilic 
rims, and on the interior, it is more lipophilic in nature [76]. Adsorption capacity of cyclodextrin-based 
adsorbents is influenced by various factors, such as surface charge, porosity, binding affinity, etc.

Ref [71] © 2011 Elsevier B.V.Polysaccharide-Based Adsorbents for Water Treatment 241
Adsorption capacity of cyclodextrin can be enhanced by chemical modification of CD. Wei et al. 
reported improved adsorption efficiency of organic dye and metal ions for the imidazole modified 
β-cyclodextrin adsorbents [77]. Murcia-Salvador et al. reported the removal of direct blue 78 dyes 
by using epichlorohydrin modified β-cyclodextrin. Maximum adsorption capacity of dye molecules 
was observed by Freundlich isotherm, which was 23.47mg g−1 [75]. Ye et al. reported adsorbent 
based on core/shell structure of β-cyclodextrin/diatomite, which was formed by emulsion polymer￾ization of β-CD coated with diatomite. Maximum adsorption capacity of adsorbent for methylene 
blue reached at 271.7mg g−1 [78]. Sikdar et al. reported novel adsorbent based on carboxymethyl￾β-cyclodextrin attached chitosan impregnated with epichlorohydrin crosslinked β-cyclodextrin 
polymer. Composite adsorbents exhibited excellent separation capacity for the Cd(II). Separation 
capacity for the heavy metal was over 378mg g−1. Heavy metal ions are attached with composite 
adsorbent by chemisorption and electrostatic interaction (Figure 13.5). Free hydroxyl, amino, and 
carboxylic functionalities are responsible for the coordination with metal ions [79]. Cellulose nano￾fiber aerogel grafted with β-cyclodextrin exhibits excellent adsorption capacity of p-chlorophenol. 
Maximum adsorption capacity of phenol has been reached at 148 μmol g−1. Increased adsorption 
capacity of phenol by the aerogel adsorbent is due to the excellent porous structure, higher specific 
surface area, and available functional groups [80]. Fan et al. reported a novel adsorbents based on 
β-cyclodextrin–chitosan functionalized with Fe3O4 nanoparticles for the separation of methyl blue. 
β-Cyclodextrin is grafted on the chitosan surface and grafted molecules formed a layer on the mag￾netic nanoparticles (Figure 13.6) [76].

13.5 SUMMARY
Water pollutions due to various toxic components remain a serious environmental concern. 
Adsorption is most widely used technique for the wastewater treatment due to their several advan￾tages, such as cost effectiveness, ease of operation, recyclability, high efficiency, etc. The adsorption 
process is affected by various factors viz. adsorbent characteristics, various process parameters, and 
nature of contaminants. Major challenges to select the promising type of adsorbent are based on cost 
effectiveness, efficiency, selectivity, rapid kinetic, higher adsorption capacity, etc. Polysaccharides 
are promising adsorbents for wastewater treatment due to their high adsorption capacity, cost effec￾tiveness, renewability, environmental friendliness, ease of surface modification, etc. Physical and 
chemical modification of polysaccharide possesses superior adsorption properties for the removal 
of a wide range of contaminants from the wastewater. This chapter presents a review and overview 
of various polysaccharide-based adsorbents for the wastewater treatments. An account of chitin 
and modified chitin are discussed for the separation of several contaminants from the wastewater. 
This is followed by chitosan as adsorbents has been elaborated. Chitosan can be modified by using 
physical, chemical, and enzymatic method to enhance the adsorption capacity of chitosan-based 
adsorbents. Starch-based adsorbents containing various functional groups for the separation of 
toxic components from the wastewater are discussed. Finally, the preparation of cyclodextrin-based 
adsorbents and their applications for the removal of various contaminants are discussed.

14.1 INTRODUCTION
With energy being a big problem in the 21st century and the depletion of fuels and the environ￾ment occurring at the same time, researchers have dug deep into sustainable energy sources as well 
as ecologically acceptable materials for energy applications. The expanding population and the 
resulting need to fulfill their requirements, along with industrial developments, emit a high level of 
pollutants into the environment, having a significant influence on climate conditions and ecological 
balances. The use of early kinds of energy, such as fossil fuels, and technologies such as combustion 
engines, must be curtailed, and environmentally friendly energies must be developed.
Sustainable energy sources, defined as those that can be replenished or utilized for today’s needs 
without compromising or depleting future generations, are being researched. This encompasses 
solar, tidal, wind, mechanical, and other forms of energy. These types of energy are environmen￾tally friendly and do not pollute the environment. Various ways are used to produce power from 
various sources. The key problem in this regard is the technology for storing these energies, which 
necessitates energy storage devices with high efficiency, cyclability, and charging-discharging rates. 
Supercapacitors, batteries, fuel cells, and nanogenerators are all popular energy storage systems, 
with the latter two also producing electricity. Fuel cells use hydrogen as a fuel to create electric￾ity, with the only byproduct being a waste vapor, whereas nanogenerators generate power through 
mechanical movement or strain. This energy storage device composition, which comprises elec￾trodes, cathodes, separators, binders, and electrolytes, is largely made of synthetic polymeric mate￾rials that may be handled as polluting waste after use. It is imperative that they be replaced with 
biofriendly and biodegradable polymers.
Polysaccharides are biopolymers composed of simple sugar monosaccharides joined together 
by glycosidic bonds. Polysaccharides have a linear or highly branched molecular structure and can 
be composed of the same (homopolysaccharide) or diverse (heteropolysaccharide) monosaccharide 
units. They are taken from plants as well as living beings and include cellulose, starch, chitosan, 
alginates, and so on. Their abundance, low cost, biodegradability, mechanical qualities, and inter￾actions with water make them ideal for sustainable materials. Their chemical structure also allows 
for additional alteration, allowing them to be tailored for a wide range of uses. They are employed 
in various domains such as water purification, electronics (Pai et al., 2022), therapeutics, and other 
industries. These materials have been used in energy storage systems as electrodes, electrolytes, 
separators, binders, and so on.
This chapter discusses various polysaccharides such as cellulose, starch chitosan, and alginates 
in energy storage applications such as supercapacitors, batteries, fuel cells, and nanogenerators. The 
history of energy storage along with the development of bio-based sustainable materials for their 
applications are briefly described.248 Polysaccharides
14.2 HISTORY AND EVOLUTION OF ENERGY STORAGE
Energy storage may be traced back to the beginning of civilizations when wood and charcoal were 
used as energy sources. Charcoal was the primary driving force of ancient civilizations because it 
works as a biomass energy store of solar power. The process was simple when the energy stored 
in charcoal or woods is fired to cook food, to bring warmth and brightness. Later, the discovery of 
coal, a fossil fuel that had been buried for millions of years, revolutionized the history of energy 
since these materials store solar energy at a high density. They were also employed as a fuel in 
steam engines, which marked the beginning of the first industrial revolution, and later to generate 
electricity.
Petroleum, extracted from the biodegradable organic materials, was another source of fuel which 
were extracted massively by the beginning of the 20th century. Many additional by-products, such 
as synthetic fibers, polymers, and plastics, were produced from this petroleum. Natural gas, coal, 
and oil are all forms of natural energy storage for solar energy. This context may be explained as 
follows: plants absorb solar energy through photosynthesis and develop into wood, and these solar 
energies are stored in these materials before being transformed into fossil fuels, which then release 
the solar energy in the form of heat (Liu et al., 2010).
Later in the 1970s, electric generators and motors were invented, and thus electrical energy 
became the important secondary energy source of consumed energy. Traditionally, electricity is 
created via solar power, fuel-burning power, hydropower, nuclear power, wind power, biopower 
systems, tidal power, and other means, and it is essential in practically every aspect of our lives, 
from lighting, cooling, and heating to entertainment, communication, and transportation. With the 
growing population and advancements in technologies, there arises a need to design storage devices 
to store these energies. Since the late 1800s, energy-storing applications were researched where a 
large double-layer electrode in polyelectrolyte designs was invented. Traditional energy storage 
devices like supercapacitors, batteries, etc. gained popularity due to their characteristics like longer 
life cycle, power density, energy density, etc. Because of these amazing benefits, they have become a 
prospective supplier for digital cameras, industrial equipment, electronic devices, and other applica￾tions. Furthermore, the fast-growing market for portable electronic devices such as mobile phones 
and laptop computers, as well as their development trend of being small, lightweight, and flexible, 
have resulted in an ever-increasing and urgent demand for ecofriendly electrochemical energy stor￾age and conversion systems (Jadhav, Mane and Shinde, 2020).
14.3 AN OVERVIEW OF ENERGY STORAGES
Energy storage devices are being researched as there is a growing need to store renewable energies. 
Depletion of fossil fuels has lowered their consumption for generating electricity, and new efficient 
and environmentally friendly energy resources such as solar, wind, and tidal are being exploited. 
These arose the demands for energy storage devices like batteries and supercapacitors. Let’s have a 
peek into the different devices used for energy storage applications.
Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are particularly attractive for energy storage because of character￾istics such as high Columbic efficiency, high-energy densities, minimal self-discharge, and so on. 
Their common applications include aircraft, electrical equipment, hybrid electric cars, and so forth. 
Traditional battery systems based on the Li+ intercalation method are inefficient in producing large 
charge capacities and hence require modification (Kim et al., 2019). Therefore, new technologies are 
being investigated based on lithium-rich, transition-rich oxides, Li-sulfur, organic electrodes, Li-air, 
etc. Supercapacitors are another type of energy storage device that resembles the working of a bat￾tery, employs a thin dielectric high surface area material as an electrode, and broadcasts capacitance 
those are several highs in magnitude when compared with traditional capacitors. They bridge the 
gaps between energy density and power density of electrolytic capacitors and conventional batteries. 
Batteries have a low power density but a high-energy density of 100–265 Wh kg−1. Supercapacitors Polysaccharides in Energy Storage 249
have good energy density as well as high-power density which are 100 times greater than batteries 
(Xie et al., 2018).
Three types of supercapacitors are distinguished. Electrochemical double layer (EDLC), pseu￾docapacitors, and hybrid (Figure 14.1). The EDLC type has no charge transfer between electrolytes 
and electrodes and operates in a non-faradaic manner with no chemical reactions. When a voltage 
is supplied, charges collect at the electrode/electrolyte interface and are stored on the pores of the 
opposite charge electrodes through ion diffusion. Because of the great reversibility of the storing 
charge, EDLCs may run for numerous charge-discharge cycles without experiencing morphological 
or volume changes. For electroneutrality balance, a double layer of opposing charges is formed on 
the electrodes. Charging entails moving electrons from negative electrodes to positive electrodes in 
conjunction with an external supply in which anions in the electrolyte shift toward positive elec￾trodes and cations shift toward negative electrodes. The discharge procedure is the inverse of this 
procedure. The electrolyte concentration remains constant as energy is stored in the double-layer 
interface. The most prevalent electrode materials are activated carbon (Zachariah, Nizam, Grohens 
and Kalarikkal, 2021) and graphene, which have outstanding features such as large surface area, 
high porosity, and suitable electrolyte solutions (Lokhande, Chavan and Pandey, 2020).
Pseudocapacitors (PC) function in the opposite way as ELDCs, with reversible redox processes 
between electrolytes and electrodes that create and transfer charges across the double layer. The 
pseudocapacitance of pseudocapacitors is governed by thermodynamic considerations. The process 
is faradaic and may be broken down into three steps: reversible adsorption, redox reactions at metal 
oxides, and doping/de-doping at the electrodes. Due to faradaic reactions that occur at the electrode 
as well as the near-surface, this kind has a higher energy density and specific capacitance than the 
EDLC. Electrodes are often made of a high-energy combination of conducting polymer and metal 
oxide/hydroxide. Polypyrrole (Ppy), polyaniline (PANI), MnO2, RuO2, Co(OH)2, and other com￾mon electrode materials include Ppy, PANI, and MnO2. The power density of PC is less than EDLC 
as faradaic processes are slower. Furthermore, the electrodes are prone to volume change when 
FIGURE 14.1 (a) EDLC type (electrodes are parallel, drawn outward to picturize double-layer formation). 
(b) Pseudocapacitor. (c) Hybrid.250 Polysaccharides
charging and discharging, reducing the life lifetime progressively (Lokhande, Chavan and Pandey, 
2020). The low power density of PC and the low specific capacitance of EDLCs are overcome by 
employing a hybrid system of EDLC and PC in which faradaic and non-faradaic processes operate 
concurrently. Capacitance and cell voltages may be increased by using appropriate electrode materi￾als, resulting in better power and energy densities, as well as longer lifespan and stability. Based on 
the arrangement, three types of hybrid supercapacitors are being addressed: composites (produced 
by mixing EDLC and PC electrodes), asymmetric (redox reaction at one end, and non-faradaic at 
the other end), and battery (a mixture of battery and supercapacitors electrodes).
A fuel cell is another form of energy storage device that generates electricity from fuels such 
as hydrogen. When hydrogen is used as a fuel, it produces electricity, as well as by-products, such 
are water and heat, making it more ecologically friendly. Fuel cells function similarly to batter￾ies but do not require charging. An electrolyte separates two electrodes in a fuel cell system, the 
anode receives hydrogen fuel, whereas the cathode receives air or oxygen. The hydrogen atoms are 
disintegrated into electrons and protons by a catalyst at the anode. Positive protons can pass throw 
the electrolyte membrane but electron flow is restricted. They flow through the electrolyte to the 
cathode, whereas electrons pass through a circuit, producing electricity and accumulating at the 
cathode. At the cathode, hydrogen proton, electron, and oxygen molecules combine to make water. 
The process produces water and heat as by-products (Dong et al., 2013).
Nanogenerators, which turn minuscule mechanical motions into electricity, are another type 
of energy generation and storage technology. Nanogenerators of three sorts are being developed: 
triboelectric, piezoelectric, and pyroelectric nanogenerators. The first two ways convert mechanical 
movements or energies into electricity, whereas the third uses thermal energy to generate electric￾ity. Two dielectric materials are attached to two electrodes, which when exposed to external strain 
generate a charge when they come into touch and a voltage when they move up generating a gap. 
The load is balanced by passing it through an external circuit, which balances the electrostatic level. 
Piezoelectric movement is the movement of two materials upward toward the position. Triboelectric 
effects are produced when these two materials glide or brush against one other. The application of 
polysaccharides on these energy storage devices is briefly described in the following sections (Kim 
et al., 2021).
14.4 POLYSACCHARIDES IN SUPERCAPACITORS
In the past decade, there has been a growing interest in biopolymers under polysaccharides due to 
their potential and characteristics such as structural diversity, abundance, physicochemical proper￾ties, and low cost. Polysaccharides that are often used include starch, chitosan, alginates, cellulose, 
lignin, and others. They are used directly for conductive composites or as a template for high sur￾face area supercapacitor material. ‘The primary focus of supercapacitor research is to enhance the 
surface areas and conductivity of the electrode. With properties such as pore size, high chemical 
stability, and environmental endurance, porous carbon is a suitable electrode material for superca￾pacitors. The electrochemical performance of these materials is determined by the raw material 
from which the carbon is generated as well as the method of activation.
14.4.1 Cellulose
Cellulose is the most prevalent biopolymer on the planet, having unique properties such as low 
cost, renewability, biodegradability, biocompatibility, and flexibility. Their physiochemical and 
structural properties enable them to be modified in a variety of ways, allowing them to be used 
in a wide range of applications such as water purification (Nizam et al., 2020), electronics (Nizam 
et al., 2021), composite parts, reinforcements (Rose Joseph et al., 2021), etc. The fibrous structure 
and porous nature of cellulose improve the encapsulation of different nanoparticles to their surface, 
increasing their applications in supercapacitors (Selvaraj et al., 2020). Cellulose is an insulator by Polysaccharides in Energy Storage 251
nature; however, their aforementioned qualities allow for tunability with other conducting materials, 
enabling them to be used in supercapacitor applications.
Before we go into cellulose-based composites, let’s have a look at cellulose-based carbon elec￾trodes. Wang et al. demonstrated in their work that carbon fabricated using cellulose as a raw 
material has a high surface area and porosity. The preparation process and temperature have a 
significant impact on their surface characteristics. Spray drying a Zn(EDA)2
2+/cellulose solution at 
a certain pressure and nozzle temperature was performed. The calcination at a higher temperature 
eliminates the volatile elements, which are then washed away with acid. The calcination tempera￾ture determines the zinc size and the final product, so temperatures were monitored and studies 
were conducted at various temperatures. The result revealed the influence of temperature, which 
enhances the surface area up to 1,000°C and then begins to demote above that temperature, imply￾ing the effect of temperature on the preparation of carbon materials (Wang et al., 2018). Moreover, 
carbon-based fibers with uniform diameter are also an excellent electrode material which is devel￾oped using the carbonization technique using cellulose lignin as raw materials exhibiting a specific 
capacitance of 346.6 F g–1 (Cao et al., 2020).
A simple scalable approach for producing graphene-induced cellulose paper was reported. The 
sonicated graphene suspension was vacuum filtered through cellulose filter paper on both sides 
until the suspension became transparent. The three-dimensional woven network of cellulose and 
graphene provides a flexible, mechanically resilient electrode with high power performance, spe￾cific capacitance, and cyclic stability (Weng et al., 2011). The presence of a conducting filler in a 
cellulose matrix enhances specific capacitance, but what if the filler is a nonconductive graphene 
derivate? The graphene oxide, which is normally not conductive, was mixed with cellulose, and the 
resulting composite had intriguing features. A capacitance of 17.3 F g–1 was measured, as well as 
an increase in current density in the cv curve and galvanostatic charging-discharging time. These 
findings are the result of increased porosity in the matrix, which improves surface area and conse￾quently electrode properties (Kafy et al., 2017).
Previous research has demonstrated that a single system of either carbonaceous material or con￾ducting polymer does not match the requirements of a supercapacitor electrode due to its low energy 
density. To illustrate, cellulose nanofibers (CNFs)/PANI aerogels were investigated for supercapaci￾tors and demonstrated a specific capacitance of 59.26 mF cm–2 (Wang et al., 2019). These low val￾ues are addressed by employing a different matrix scheme of more than one filler. A cellulose and 
graphene oxide scaffold aerogel was produced, and PANI nanoclusters were synthesized inside the 
scaffold in situ. This combination improves the electrode properties, yielding a high areal-specific 
capacitance of 1,218 mF cm–2 (Li et al., 2020). Polypyrrole, another conducting polymer, produced 
comparable results when a composite of cellulose and reduced graphene oxide was synthesized 
through wet spinning and in-situ polymerization of polypyrrole. These composites achieved a spe￾cific capacitance of 391 F g–1, demonstrating the benefit of using two fillers in supercapacitor appli￾cations (Sheng et al., 2019).
Inorganic nanomaterials are excellent materials for reinforcements (Nizam, Binumol and 
Thomas, 2021) for supercapacitor applications. Graphene-based inorganic nanoparticles were dis￾cussed earlier. Other inorganic metal oxide nanoparticles and carbon nanotubes (CNT) are also 
employed for electrodes in supercapacitors. Multiwalled carbon nanotubes wrapped around CNF 
along with TiO2 nanotubes exhibited a discharge capacity of 62.5 mF cm–2. TiO2 has a distinct 
advantage in ultrafast charge-discharge processes via a pseudocapacitive charging mechanism. 
The inclusion of MWCNT in the composite inhibits TiO2 agglomeration, functioning as a suit￾able dispersion agent for metal oxides (Wang and Li, 2015). Metal-organic frames a class of inor￾ganic porous material linked with organic ligands and inorganic clusters via coordination bonds are 
attractive materials for fabricating electrodes for supercapacitors. These materials have the extra 
advantage of turnability with predetermined architecture and properties for various applications. 
Their high surface area and electrical conductivity make them an ideal candidate for electrochemi￾cal storage applications. CNF is employed as a template for the synthesis of the MOF due to its high 252 Polysaccharides
porosity. These nano-paper composites have a high electrical conductivity of up to 100 S cm–1 with 
exceptional mechanical properties and porosity. Furthermore, the constructed supercapacitor exhib￾its extraordinarily high cycle stability, with capacitance retentions of more than 99% after 10,000 
continuous charge/discharge cycles (Zhou et al., 2019).
Cellulose is also employed as a separator, electrolyte as well as a binder for supercapacitors. The 
primary goal of a separator is to prevent contact between the two electrodes to prevent a short cir￾cuit. An ideal separator meets the properties such as high thermal and chemical stability, porosity, 
hydrophilicity, mechanical properties, etc. The pores in the cellulose enhance a higher electrolyte 
uptake as well as ionic conductivity which are prerequisites for an ideal separator. These points were 
confirmed in a study where cellulose was dissolved in a solvent and films were cast using the phase 
inversion method. The fabricated films exhibited excellent mechanical properties, hydrophilicity, 
thermal stability, porosity (59%), electrolyte absorption (330%), etc. A charge-discharge efficiency 
of 99% at 1 A g–1 was attained. This implies the future of cellulose for separator applications (Teng 
et al., 2020). Their further applications in energy storage are discussed in the following sections.
14.4.2 Chitosan
Chitosan is a semicrystalline, cationic polysaccharide found abundantly in nature. They are pro￾duced by partial deacetylation of chitin (more than 70%), another bio-based polymer. The degree of 
deacetylation plays an important role in chitosan formed where higher DD manifests chitosan with 
high chemical stability, superior biological activity, and good solubility in an acidic medium (Roy, 
Tahmid and Rashid, 2021). These materials are extensively researched for their use as electrodes 
and electrolytes due to their ionic conductivity and excellent mechanical strength. The ionic con￾duction is a result of the lone-pair electron in -OH, NH2, and C-O-C groups in the structure.
Chitosans are employed as a precursor for the production of porous carbon electrodes for super￾capacitors. They demonstrate great competitive excellence in the energy storage industry due to 
their exceptional porosity, high surface area, and low production cost. Porous carbon alone doesn’t 
work well as an electrode and requires further modifications such as doping with heteroatoms. The 
modifications improve the wettability, electronic conductivity, as well as specific capacitance. Two 
commonly employed doping routes include artificial doping where the activated carbons are treated 
with several types of reagents to form functional groups on the surface of the carbon. Self-co-doping 
is an efficient method where the carbon precursor act as a host for heteroatoms. The structural 
features of chitosan with amino groups permit self-doped heteroatoms, thus providing a better uni￾form dispersion of these atoms in the carbon matrix. Hierarchical porous carbons provide better 
performance as an electrode material. The micropores in the carbon are not that efficient for elec￾trolytes thus limiting ion transportation. A combined, mesoporous, microporous, and microporous 
carbon is considered efficient for supercapacitors. Nitrogen-doped chitosan precursor-based porous 
carbon is produced by microwave carbonization of ZnCl2. By modulating the ZnCl2 concentration, 
varied porosity was obtained and exhibited a specific capacitance of 435 F g–1 (Abbasi, Antunes and 
Velasco, 2019; Li et al., 2017). Such modifications with heteroatoms are also carried out in cellulose 
for synthesizing porous carbons.
Chitosan is also used as a composite for supercapacitor electrodes. Chitosan-conducting polymer, 
chitosan-graphene/other inorganic metal oxides, and chitosan-conducting polymer-graphene/metal 
oxide are examples of typical binary and tertiary systems. Because of the nanostructures, these 
composites often have a high pseudocapacitive and porosity. Conductive polymers and nanopar￾ticles generally give electric energy via a faradaic reaction redox process, and carbon scaffolds offer 
an electron channel for this created energy to flow. PANI, although a great conductor, lacks cyclic 
stability due to weak shrinkage and swelling. These drawbacks can be mitigated by attaching PANI 
to supporting materials like graphene or metal oxides. These materials must fulfill characteristics 
such as excellent electrical conductivity and an appropriate structural channel for electron transport. 
Graphene performs well in this function for PANI, albeit it tends to clump or agglomerate, resulting Polysaccharides in Energy Storage 253
in poor PANI graphene dispersion. This system may be enhanced further by employing chitosan as 
a graphene stabilizing agent, resulting in a more uniform dispersion of the electrode. The specific 
capacitance of these composite electrodes was 340 F g–1 (Jang et al., 2021).
Chitosan is also used as an electrolyte in supercapacitors. 1-ethyl-3-methyl imidazolium tetra￾fluoroborate and chitosan-based gel electrolytes with outstanding mechanical characteristics and 
ionic liquid retentions were produced for EDLC. Despite the use of a gel-state electrolyte, charge￾discharge investigations revealed that a model EDLC cell with a chitosan gel had a high discharge 
capacitance, implying the strong affinity of chitosan for the activated carbon electrode decreases 
the electrode-electrolyte interfacial resistance. During 5,000 cycles, these composites retained a 
coulombic efficiency of greater than 99.9% (Yamagata et al., 2013). Another gel electrolyte based on 
carbonylated chitosan in HCl that was generated using the phase separation procedure had excep￾tional flexibility, an electrolyte absorption rate of 742.0wt.%, and the highest ionic conductivity 
of 8.69 10–2 S cm–1. The current progress in the development of chitosan-based supercapacitors is 
much more visible than it was previously. Research and studies in the right areas will be able to 
overcome the existing limitations of manufactured supercapacitors, ensuring environmental safety 
and allowing human society to make a significant leap in energy storage technology (Yang et al., 
2019).
14.4.3 Starch
Starch, like other polysaccharides, has gained a lot of interest due to its availability, renewability, 
low cost, and so on, and these materials are used in applications including bi-sensors, packaging, 
supercapacitors, and so on. As two sides of a coin starch also possess disadvantages like inherent 
properties such as low water solubility, shear resistance, high viscosity, poor mechanical properties, 
etc. These inherent qualities are frequently addressed by reinforcing with extra fillers or adding 
co-biopolymers. Starch, like the previously stated polysaccharides, is employed in supercapacitor 
applications as a precursor for porous carbon electrodes because of its carbon-rich composition, low 
cost, and degradable properties.
Porous carbon nanofibers produced from starch, electrospun in PVA, and coated with cobalt 
oxide have a high specific capacitance of 137 F g–1. The superior porosity nature of the composite, as 
well as the synergetic impact of carbon and cobalt oxide, contributes to the electrode’s performance 
(Kebabsa et al., 2020). Dialdehyde starch is employed as a reducing agent in the incorporation of 
GO with PANI. When graphene aggregates in a PANI/graphene composite, it precipitates. This is 
solved by utilizing starch as a reducing agent, and the resulting composite has a specific capacitance 
of 499 F g–1 (Wu et al., 2014). Starch and GO are combined to create a green hybrid binder. The elec￾trodes for supercapacitors were then built utilizing a standard and industrial-ready manufacturing 
procedure that simply required water as an ecological solvent. The advantage of employing starch 
as green support for GO in supercapacitor applications is demonstrated by a specific capacitance of 
174 F g–1 (Rapisarda, Marken and Meo, 2021).
14.4.4 Alginates
Abundant and non-toxic marine biomass resources, such as sodium alginate (SA), have been 
exploited to develop energy storage materials employing innovative synthesis methodologies. SA 
is a natural anionic polysaccharide of high modulus derived from abundant brown seaweed that is 
constituted of the monomers (1,4)-D-mannuronic acid (M) and (1,3)-L-guluronic acid (G). SA is 
an excellent precursor for supercapacitors due to their high amount of hydroxyl and carboxyl func￾tional groups, which provide some pseudocapacitance. The –COO- groups of SA monomers may 
be chelated with metal ions such as Cu2+, Fe3+, Co2+, and Cr3+ by an ion-exchange process. Alginates 
like other polysaccharides can be used to fabricate environmentally friendly aerogel of porous 
carbon. In one study, copper-induced carbon aerogel from alginates prepared using ion-exchange, 254 Polysaccharides
freeze-dried, and one-step carbonization exhibits a surface area of 230m2g–1. The synergetic effect 
of Cu along with the porous structure enhances the electrochemical properties in carbon aerogel 
with a specific capacitance of 415 F g–1 (Zhai et al., 2019). A similar result was observed when nitro￾gen doped in SA porous carbon aerogels were prepared (Zhao et al., 2020).
Conducting polymers also adhere with SA for the study of electrode materials. PANI-based 
SA composite synthesized using template-induced method exhibited good reversible stability, elec￾trochemical discharge capacitance, and faster oxidation and reduction responses. The composite 
showed an enhanced retention life, which can be attributed to the high surface area of the nano￾electrode which facilitates high electrode/electrolyte interfaces and shorter path lengths for ion 
transport (Patil et al., 2016). Furthermore, the sodium alginate hydrogels also proved to be a good 
recipient for electrode material, where pyrrole mixed in aqueous SA and polymerized to form poly￾pyrrole/SA hydrogel broadcasted good electrode properties (Huang et al., 2017). Polysaccharides in 
the supercapacitor applications are vast but can be simplified into carbon-based, conductive poly￾mer-based, and metal oxide-based.
14.5 POLYSACCHARIDES IN BATTERY
Polysaccharides were important components of early battery designs and are still widely employed 
in a wide range of commercial applications today. Except for energy and power densities, batter￾ies and supercapacitors are nearly identical. When it comes to polysaccharides, they are used as 
separators, binders, composites, and electrolytes. Polysaccharides are used in both batteries and 
superconductors since both systems have the same electrode, separator, electrolyte, and so on. 
Li-ion batteries are an exceedingly promising power solution in most electronic products. Because 
lithium is the lightest and most electropositive metal, it can be used in battery applications with 
high-energy density and terminal voltages. A typical Li-ion battery has two electrodes, one positive 
and one negative, with the positive being a metal oxide of lithium (LiCoO2) with a layer or tunnel 
structure and the negative being graphitic carbon or sulfur. They are encased in conductive materi￾als such as aluminum, copper, and so on. Binders are usually polymer compounds, such as PVDF, 
that improve conductivity, and the electrolytes are lithium salts in organic solvents. A typical poly￾ethylene microporous separator sheet separates the negative and positive electrodes. The positive 
electrode is oxidized while the negative electrode is reduced throughout the charging process. The 
procedure entails the migration of Li ions onto the negative point and gets intercalated at the cath￾ode. The compensating electrons travel through the external circuit and are accepted at the host end 
to balance the reaction. During discharge, this process is reversed (Jabbour et al., 2013).
Polysaccharides are used in battery applications as a precursor for carbon-based electrodes, as 
a composite with graphene, and as separators and binders with conducting polymer and metal. 
Cellulose is used as a separator material in batteries to separate the anode and the cathode. An 
excellent separator must have strong mechanical properties, as well as tunable thickness and poros￾ity, as well as good chemical stability and electrolyte wettability. Their abundance of added func￾tionality and wettability owing to the presence of hydroxyl groups on the surface make them ideal 
for use in separator applications.
A composite of cellulose/polysulfonamide (PSA) was fabricated as a separator as PSA is known 
for its excellent mechanical, thermal, chemical, and dielectric properties. A simple paper-making 
process was employed to fabricate the composite, with cellulose matrix to reduce the cost and PSA 
to impart mechanical and other thermal and chemical properties. Because of the synergetic action 
between the electrolyte and the composite material, the electrolyte-soaked cellulose/PSA composite 
membrane demonstrated improved ion conductivity (Xu et al., 2014). Cellulose nanofibrils soaked 
in ethanol manifest an areal density of 7.1g m–2 and thickness of 12μm along with uniform pores 
structure and high porosity and mechanical properties. An electrolyte uptake of 281% along with 
excellent electrolyte affinity and wettability four times higher, along with electrochemical stabil￾ity up to 4.8v with good cyclic performance were reported (Sheng et al., 2020). Carboxymethyl Polysaccharides in Energy Storage 255
cellulose is used as a binder for cathodes and anodes in Li-ion batteries. This helps the insertion and 
extraction of Li ions between cathode and anode and enhances the charge-discharge capability of 
whole Li/Ion batteries. After 200 cycles, the CMC-Li cathode exhibited a reversible capacity of 175 
mAh g–1 and increased electrochemical performance. This demonstrates that the CMC-Li binder 
may generate an effective electrically conductive network as well as a stable cathode interface struc￾ture (Lei et al., 2019).
Lithium-sulfur is another type of energy storage device with high theoretical capacity as well as 
theoretical energy-specific capacity. Sulfur is an abundant material with no toxicity and low cost. 
Their main disadvantage and restriction for commercialization is their dissolution of lithium polysul￾fide intermediates into the organic electrolyte during the electrochemical reaction. Polysulfide soluble 
in electrolyte diffuses out of the cathode and moves toward the metallic lithium to form short-chain 
polysulfide which reduces the active lithium contaminating the whole system (Figure 14.2). This effect 
commonly referred to as the shuttle effect lowers the efficiency, cycle life, self-discharge, etc., lead￾ing to a failure. Studies have revealed that the hydroxyl and amine groups in chitosan can reduce this 
shuttle effect of polysulfide by capturing them. When chitosan was used as a separator for the Li-S 
battery, an increased cyclic performance and reversible capability were observed. The improved sepa￾rator, which contains chitosan as an addition, catches more polysulfide and reactivates the trapped 
active components. Given the safety, ease of preparation of chitosan, and environmental friendliness, 
this simple functional addition gives key hints in the development of lithium-sulfur batteries and may 
be widely used in high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries (Chen et al., 2015). Chitosan derivatives 
formed by the carboxymethylation of chitosan and carboxymethyl chitosan are used as a binder for Si 
and Li-ion batteries. The characterization techniques suggest a hydrogen-bonding interaction between 
the hydroxylated Si surface and hydroxyl groups of carboxylate chitosan. The electrode fabricated 
using carboxylate chitosan as a binder broadcast a very high discharge capacity, better rate perfor￾mance, and better cycling efficiency compared to traditional binders such as PVDF (Sun et al., 2017).
Starch is an inexpensive, renewable, and biological material employed in battery applications as 
a precursor for carbon. Potato starch is a refined starch with spherical morphologies, which were 
employed to make anode. Hard carbon spherules were fabricated using potato starch using a one￾step program process in an inert atmosphere. This process retains their spherules morphology, and 
as an anode, they exhibited good reversible capacity, stable cyclic performance, and rate capability 
(Li, Chen and Wang, 2011). Because of its remarkable capacity and tolerable working potential, 
silicon offers significant promise as a replacement for graphite, which is presently utilized com￾mercially as an anode material in LIBs. Si incorporated in carbon from corn starch was studied and 
revealed excellent electrical conductivity accommodating a large volume change and aggregation 
prevention during each cycle. This development in desirable cheap, biodegradable polymer binders 
from starch has led to the improved performance of the Si anodes (Kwon et al., 2020). Proper bind￾ing materials improve the life of a battery by increasing electrochemical performance. Sustainable 
FIGURE 14.2 Charging and discharging in a Li-S battery. Reprinted from Zhang et al. (2021).256 Polysaccharides
binders normally that are dissolved in an environmentally friendly medium like water are being 
investigated. Traditional binder PVDF forfeits such properties and is dissolved in complex, toxic, 
and aqueous solvents. Tapioca starch derived from cassava roots along with polyethylene glycol was 
tested for Si electrodes in Li-ion batteries. Tapioca starch is a water-soluble, biodegradable polymer 
composed of amylose units with glycosidic bonds. Other commonly used biodegradable binders, 
such as CMC, are brittle, and peeling from the substrate is tough which is the nature of linear poly￾mer chains. Moderately branched amylopectin groups present in starch enhance stress relaxation 
during drying making them a better binder than CMC. Starch/Peg exhibited better mechanical 
hardness and elastic modulus compared to PVDF binders, which are attributed to better adhesion 
between Si nanoparticles and the binders. High coulombic efficiency and reversible capacity reten￾tion were observed in starch-based binders (Hapuarachchi et al., 2020).
Alginates are mostly employed as separators and binders in battery applications. SA binders with 
aluminum and barium cations doped were analyzed as a binder for Li-rich batteries. This type of 
doping into SA reduces the capacity decay and voltage fading. Binders based on SA can maintain 
a stable structure in electrodes during the cyclic process due to their vicious nature. Moreover, they 
form a coating on the electrode, which arrests the etching of active materials into the electrolytes. 
Such kind of doped SA exhibits remarkable capability along with high-capacity retention and sup￾pressed voltage decay (Zhang et al., 2018). SA is investigated as a binder for sulfur-based cathode 
as well. They exhibited a discharge capacity of 508 mAh·g−1 and 66% capacity retention after 50 
cycles. Electrochemical experiments show that the Na-alginate sulfur cathode has better kinetic 
properties, lower resistance, and greater cycle stability than the PVDF sulfur cathode. These find￾ings indicate that Na-alginate is a suitable sulfur cathode binder in lithium-sulfur battery applica￾tions (Bao et al., 2013). Alginate dressings due to their electrolyte retention/adsorption capabilities 
and thermal shrinkage are introduced into the lithium-ion battery as a separator. The alginate dress￾ing constitutes 85% calcium alginate and 15% of sodium carboxymethyl cellulose. Calcium alginate 
is insoluble in water and organic solvents which contribute to the skeleton and the Na-CMC func￾tions as a sticky agent for the separator. Their surface chemistry of carbonyl and hydroxyl groups 
allows them to dope with other chemical agents, where polyacrylic acid (PAA) and Li+ ions doped 
broadcasted a good electrochemical performance (Dai et al., 2020). All of the major polysaccha￾rides are promising for battery applications mainly as separators and binders.
14.6 POLYSACCHARIDES IN FUEL CELLS
A fuel cell is a promising and growing field in future energy technologies in which chemical bonds 
in the fuel, primarily hydrogen, are directly converted into electricity via chemical reactions via 
oxidation. When compared to combustion technologies, the pollution emission is negligible because 
the by-products are water vapor and heat. In terms of efficiency, fuel cells surpass other techniques 
of energy conversion—depending on the kind of fuel, the electrical efficiency of a typical cell is 
in the range of 40%–60%, and total efficiency can reach 80%–90% (Daszkiewicz et al., 2021). 
An electrolyte material separates the porous anode and cathode of the fuel cells, where the input 
fuels are passed through the anode and air or oxygen along with the cathode, which then catalyzes 
the hydrogen and dissociates into electrons and ions. Ions travel down the electrolyte to opposite 
charged electrodes, while electrons go via the external circuit to generate electricity Figure 14.3. 
They are often classed according to the electrolyte utilized. Fuel cells are classified into six cat￾egories. Molten carbonate fuel cell (MCFC), alkaline fuel cell (AFC), proton exchange membrane 
fuel cell (PEMFC), solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC), phosphoric acid fuel cell (PAFC), and biofuel cells 
are all examples of fuel cells. Figure 14.4 compares the characteristics of each of these cells. All of 
these fuel cells are based on hydrogen and are also referred to as hydrogen cells. Direct-methanol 
fuel cells (DMFCs), direct-ethanol fuel cells (DEFCs), reformed methanol fuel cells (RMFCs), and 
direct-formic acid fuel cells (DFAFCs) are other types of non-hydrogen cells that use methanol, Polysaccharides in Energy Storage 257
ethanol, and formic acids as electron donors in the anode. Fuel cells are well known for their effi￾ciency, silent operation, high-energy density, and environmental friendliness.
To overcome the disadvantages of liquid electrolytes, polymer membranes are (Danyliv et al., 
2021) utilized as an electrolyte in fuel cells. Some desirable characteristics for fuel cell membranes 
include high proton conductivity, impermeability to fuel gas or liquid, low electrical conductiv￾ity, good mechanical toughness in both the dry and hydrated states, hydrolytic stability, and so 
on. Nanocellulose is a potentially new membrane material for fuel cells that is less costly and has 
a lower environmental impact than Nafion or Aquivion. Polysaccharides have thermomechanical 
qualities but lack proton conductivity, which protic ionic liquids can provide. Cellulose nanocrystals 
and protic ionic liquids composite have a higher ionic conductivity of 10–4 to 10–3 S cm–1 at tempera￾tures ranging from 120°C to 160°C.
Cellulose nanofibers are modified with sulfonation to improve the ionic conductivity and paper￾based membranes were fabricated as a membrane for fuel cells. They exhibited good current

density and power density which symbolize the use of cellulose in fuel cells as an electrolytic 
membrane(Bayer et al., 2021).
Chitosan, the N-deacetylated derivative of chitin is a promising membrane material. The pres￾ence of free amine and hydroxyl functional groups on the chitosan backbone allows for numerous 
chemical modifications to adapt chitosan for specific applications such as polymer electrolyte mem￾branes. Chitosan-based membranes are easily produced, have high hydrophilicity, and are thermally 
and chemically stable. Anionic poly(acrylic acid) coupled with cationic chitosan membranes were 
studied by ionically crosslinking to a fabricated polyelectrolyte complex. This study showed that 
this type of membrane exhibits high proton conductivity, high ion-exchange capacity, low methanol 
permeability, and sufficient mechanical and thermal stability (Smitha, Sridhar and Khan, 2004). 
Chitosan is a low conductive material, with three hydrogen atoms bonded to their structure, which 
doesn’t be mobilized to enhance proton conduct under an electric field. When it is dissolved in 
acetic acids CH3COO−, H+ or H3O+ ions will be dispersed solvent which can be mobilized upon the 
application of an electric field. If the latter two positive ions become more mobile than the former 
proton condition occurs. Chitosan membranes crosslinked in acid such as sulfuric acid can be used 
in proton exchange membranes. These membranes outperform Nafion 117 in water uptake experi￾ments where they absorb 60% water (Mukoma, Jooste and Vosloo, 2004).
Polysaccharides find application in microbial fuels, a type of biofuel cell, where electricity is 
produced from organic matter by microorganisms as biocatalysts. This environment benign pro￾cess works by oxidizing the microbes in the anode compartment producing electrons and protons 
whereby electrons are passed through an external circuit producing electricity and collected at the 
cathode. Protons move through the internal membrane and accumulate at the cathode whereby 
oxygen gets reduced. Electricity can be produced from various waste sources or marine sedi￾ments, sludge, or other sources under mild conditions. Starch-processed wastewaters containing 
oxygen were used as a source for the anode in such a fuel cell to generate electricity. Maximum 
power density and voltage output were acquired along with coulombic efficiency of 8% (Lu 
et al., 2009). It is demonstrated that specially designed anode like platinum electrodes by a coating 
of poly(tetrafluoroaniline) and biocatalyst clostridium butyricum electricity can be produced from 
starch (Niessen, Schröder and Scholz, 2004). Along with starch, other polysaccharides such as cel￾lulose and chitosan are also employed as fuel for microbial fuel cells and are exhibiting promising 
results for future commercialization.
14.7 POLYSACCHARIDES IN NANOGENERATORS
Nanogenerators are ambient and simple next-generation electronic devices with versatile character￾istics for a wide range of applications. They employ mechanical movements or energy found in the 
environment into electric energy exploiting piezoelectric, electrostatic, electromagnetic, and tribo￾electric effects. This sort of energy can be used for wearable electronics, self-charging, and wireless 
devices. During a mechanical deformation, a change in polarization occurs in piezoelectric mate￾rials producing to generate electricity. Polysaccharides such as chitosan, bacterial cellulose, and 
cellulose are used as a material for piezoelectric generators. A drawback of this type of generator 
is its mechanical excitation range is 60–100Hz, below which very low-voltage values are acquired. 
The piezoelectric in wood is known for decades which simultaneously leads cellulose for the same 
effect, generation of polarization upon mechanical stress. Cellulose nanocrystals, as well as nanofi￾bers, are evaluated as piezoelectric material and showed good results. The piezoelectric response of 
the CNC films was attributed to the asymmetric crystalline structure of the cellulose crystals. The 
piezoelectric constant of CNC was comparable with that of a reference piezoelectric metal oxide 
confirming their future in nanogenerators (Csoka et al., 2012). Chitin has good piezoelectric proper￾ties which can be attributed to the non-centrosymmetric crystal structure of both α- and β-chitin 
polymorphs through which intrinsic molecular polarization arises. Chitosan is better as it can be Polysaccharides in Energy Storage 259
solubilized when compared to chitin. Due to their frequency range, there are of less interest when 
compared to triboelectric generators.
Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) can harvest energy in low frequencies 10 Hz and 
below from water motion, human motion, animal organs, and other small frequency sources. 
TENGs work on the principle of electrostatic and triboelectric phenomena, whereas the latter 
is also known as contact esterification which occurs when two materials are brought together 
and separated. When such a process is happening, electrons from a high Fermi-level surface 
try to transfer to a low-surface Fermi level. They are intended to alternately touch and sepa￾rate two materials with opposing triboelectric polarities to force-induced electrons between the 
electrodes. TENG output voltage and current are proportional to the triboelectric charge den￾sity on the surface, and output power is related to charge density. Polysaccharides due to their 
diverse properties are being employed in TENGs applications. The functional group present 
in the polysaccharides enhances their performances due to their electron-withdrawing/gaining 
tendency. Triboelectric charge density can be lowered or increased by altering the functional 
groups, where a fivefold improvement in efficiency and surface charge were observed when CNF 
was modified as nitro-CNF (Yao et al., 2016).
Surface area is another factor, where a larger contact area, as well as the surface roughness, 
promotes tribo outputs. Nanocellulose fibers with high surface area and roughness due to fiber 
morphologies are ideal for such applications which can be further modified by the incorporation 
of fillers or nanowires. One of the main drawbacks of polysaccharides in nanogenerator applica￾tion is their moisture absorption from the atmosphere, which hinders charge transfer and leads to 
a lower triboelectrification (Torres and De-la-Torre, 2021). Cellulose due to its surface area and 
abundant oxygen groups in its structure exhibits a high tendency to lose electrons and become posi￾tive. Therefore, cellulose films can be paired with negative triboelectric materials. The observed 
triboelectric voltage output was found to be a function of CNF film size, owing to time-dependent 
triboelectric discharging behavior. The output electric energy was determined to be in the range of 
0.01–0.16mJ as a function of the mechanical impact frequency using normal capacitor charging 
(Lei et al., 2019). Modification of CNF with nitro and methyl group by chemical reaction renders 
them with opposite and tribo-polarity. The surface charge density of nitro-CNF and methyl-CNF 
was −85.8 and 62.5 μC m−2, respectively, which is much higher than the pure CNF. This type of 
modification further enhances their employment in TBNGs, thus creating sustainable energy appli￾cations (Yao et al., 2017).
Chitosan also has proved to be an excellent material for triboelectric generators. Their pristine 
form exhibited triboelectric efficiency but the electrical output is low. This can be improved by sur￾face engineering the chitosan by modifying the functional groups present on the surface. Chitosan 
is dissolved in citric acid where two hydrolysis reactions occur: hydrolysis of N-acetyl linkages and 
glycosidic linkages. A three-dimensional hybrid network structure of chitosan/citric acid is formed 
by a crosslinking of the two reactants by hydrogen bonding. Such modified chitosan has demon￾strated high efficiency in TENG for self-powered devices, paving the way for new technologies that 
make use of abundant bio-derived materials for the economically feasible and environmentally 
friendly production of functional devices in electronics, energy, and sensor applications (Yao et al., 
2017).
14.8 CONCLUSION
Polysaccharides are intriguing materials in the field of energy storage applications, such as super￾capacitors, batteries, fuel cells, and nanogenerators. Their abundance, low cost, renewability, and 
biodegradable properties aid their use in different applications. Their surface chemistry with func￾tional groups further enhances the fabrication of composites as well as modification, thus making 
these materials an ideal candidate for energy storage devices.260 Polysaccharides

15.1 INTRODUCTION
The building blocks of any civilization are composed of substances that have served a variety of 
purposes to improve both human and animal existence since the earth was first created. Materials 
have been important in many facets of human development since the advent of agriculture more 
than 10,000years ago (Fabrice 2019). Over the past millennium, humankind has made significant 
advancements to support their constantly shifting livelihoods, as seen by the domestication of crops 
and animals from the wild into domestic management and control (Zeder 2015). Various technolog￾ical developments have led to the creation of many foods and animal feed products for humans and 
animals. As a result, even in the current environment, it is still possible to create new technologies 
and push the boundaries of science in order to manipulate crops and animals to increase accessibil￾ity, affordability, availability, and utilization of different forms. Polysaccharides derived from plants 
and animals have been one of the essential components that have fuelled human development since 
the beginning of time in order to nourish and sustain an ever-increasing human population (Souza 
et al. 2022). The significance, origin, and processing of polysaccharides in order to maximize their 
use in various parts of life have all been extensively studied. The need for starch-based products 
has influenced the evolution of agriculture and the global economy. Some chains of starch can be 
consumed immediately by humans and animals, while others need to be processed in the industrial 
setting in order to be combined with other goods. According to other studies, many polysaccharides 
or starch chains are being wasted daily, even though both animals and humans need to consume 
them in large quantities. According to Souza et al. (2022), biological materials or biomass should 
be potentialized in the industry so that each resource obtained has a specific use and does not 
produce waste. According to Mohammed et al. (2021), the continued need to create novel materi￾als as a result of the previous work has prompted current research into a wide variety of biological 
and synthetic chemicals and compounds that routinely utilize polysaccharides. This has led to the 
production and usage of these materials in several technological areas, such as agriculture, medical, 
engineering, and business development. According to research, polysaccharide materials have many 
uses throughout the world, but even when they are being used historically, most farmers don’t seem 
to be aware of them. Others are utterly ignorant of polysaccharides and are not employing them 264 Polysaccharides
efficiently or sustainably. Some report that polysaccharides are being debated and found daily and 
that their applications transform their lives. This chapter attempted to outline and explain the use 
of polysaccharides for agricultural applications and ascertain their growing presence on the farm to 
increase production and productivity as they proceed through the resilience pathway to end poverty.
15.1.1 Polysaccharides from Industrial Biomass in a Wasted World
The most prevalent biological substance in the world, polysaccharides help provide new solutions 
for sustainability in terms of the economy, society, and the environment. Despite their diversity and 
great promise, their agro-industrial application is currently very limited, but it has recently risen 
dramatically due to research and development. According to Souza et al. (2022), the use of these 
biopolymers increased by approximately 17% between 2017 and 2021, with the global market top￾ping $10 billion in the first half of 2021 (Souza et al. 2022). FMR15151A (2021) forecasts that the 
use of polysaccharides and oligosaccharides in “clean label” and sustainable improvements in the 
food and beverage sectors will result in a global market of more than $22 billion by 2030 and a com￾pound annual growth rate (CAGR) of more than 5%. For instance, the extraction of palm kernels 
can include up to 66% carbohydrates, including highly soluble (>95%) mannose, galactose, glucose, 
arabinose, xylose, and rhamnose.
According to Asim et al. (2015), agriculture and forestry goods produce 30%–40% of waste 
that might be used in processing with added value. It implies that low-density natural fibers can be 
utilized for practical application sales. For objects with low load-bearing capacity, grass fiber, for 
example, can be a great replacement. In addition to low density, cheap cost, low salary, non-carcino￾genicity, and biodegradability, it also benefits from a few other features. Asim et al. (2015) contend 
that scientists, engineers, and even farmers are very interested in finding new sources of raw mate￾rials that have the same physical and mechanical properties as synthetic fibers. Generally, natural 
fibers are also appealing because of how cheap they are, how good they are for the environment, 
how safe they are for human and animal health, how flexible they are, how old the plants are, how 
easy they are to collect, and where they grow (Abed et al. 2016). Natural fibers are the best choice 
for a sustainable supply because they are less expensive, less dense, require less processing, don’t 
pose any health risks, and have better mechanical and physical properties. They are also renewable 
resources, which makes them the best choice. Because natural fibers tend to soak up water, chemi￾cals are used to change their surface properties (Bhardwaj et al., 2021). Expensive fiber-reinforced 
synthetic polymers have an effect on the environment. Pineapple, kenaf, coir, abaca, sisal, cotton, 
jute, bamboo, banana, palmyra, talipot, hemp, and flex are among the plant fibers that could be 
exploited as raw materials in a variety of industries, as shown in Table 15.1. Commonly grown 
crops in developing nations, such as pineapple leaf fiber, sugar cane, and cassava grains, are among 
the agricultural waste products. According to Imam et al. (2021), pineapple (Ananas comosus) is 
one of the most important tropical fruits in the world, following citrus and banana, as indicated in 
Table 15.1. Pineapple leaves are processed into natural fibers and are categorized as fruit waste. 
Commercially, pineapple fruits are highly significant. PALF is chemically composed of ash, lignin, 
and holocellulose (70%–82% of PALF is holocellulose) (1.1%). Pineapple (PALF), which possesses 
exceptional mechanical qualities, can be used in low-density polyethylene (LDPE) composites, bio￾degradable plastic composites, and reinforced polymer composites (Amanor, 2019). When gathered 
and processed, the leaves and outer layers of pineapple trees have proven beneficial in this regard.
Asim et al. (2015) estimate that between 30% and 40% of the waste materials produced by 
agriculture and forestry goods could be utilized in value-added processing. These materials can 
be used for impact resistance, processing viscoelastic behavior, and tensile and flexural strength. 
It suggests that low-density natural fibers can also be used in real-world situations. For simple 
load-bearing items, grass fiber, for instance, is a great substitute. It also benefits from a variety of 
other characteristics, such as low density, low cost, low wage, non-carcinogenicity, and biodegrad￾ability (Shih et al. 2014). Discovering new sources of raw materials whose physical and mechanical Polysaccharides for Agricultural Applications 265
qualities resemble synthetic fibers is of enormous interest to scientists, engineers, and even farmers 
(Kumar Sinha 1982). When selecting raw materials, it is vital to evaluate various other criteria that 
directly impact the acceptability of natural fibers, such as cost, environmental friendliness, absence 
of health hazards, high degrees of flexibility, plant age, ease of collecting, and regional availability 
(Asim et al. 2015). Natural fibers are a superior option for a sustainable supply chain due to their 
low cost, low density, minimal processing, absence of health hazards, and high mechanical and 
physical qualities (Nicolle et al. 2021). In addition, they are renewable resources. The fundamen￾tal disadvantage of natural fibers, hygroscopicity, necessitates the application of chemical surface 
modification. The environment is impacted by expensive synthetic fiber-reinforced plastics. Several 
plant fibers, including pineapple, kenaf, coir, abaca, sisal, cotton, jute, bamboo, banana, palmyra, 
talipot, hemp, and flex, could be utilized as raw materials in a wide range of industries (Kengkhetkit 
& Amornsakchai 2012). Waste products from the agriculture industry include pineapple leaf fiber, 
sugar cane, and cassava grains, which are frequently cultivated in underdeveloped nations (Amanor 
2012; Suvedi et al. 2017). One of the most important tropical fruits in the world, the pineapple 
(Ananas comosus) ranks third after citrus and banana. Pineapple leaves are regarded as fruit waste 
and are utilized to manufacture natural fibers. The industry for pineapple fruit is enormous. The 
bulk of PALF consists of ash, lignin, and holocellulose (1.1%) (Nicolle et al. 2021) although Asim 
et al. (2015) revealed that it has 70%–82% of holocellulose. Pineapple (PALF), a material with

superior mechanical properties, can be used to create composites of low-density polyethylene 
(LDPE), biodegradable plastic, and polymer with reinforcement (Nicolle et al. 2021). Composites’ 
viscoelastic behavior, processing, tensile strength, flexural strength, and impact resistance are all 
affected by the fiber length, matrix ratio, and fiber arrangement (Asim et al. 2015).
Cassava, recently discovered as one of the crops with abundant starch and carbs, currently pro￾vides the world with much-needed polysaccharide products for use at home and in the workplace 
(Otun et al. 2022; Zezza et al. 2021). Cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) is the fourth-best source of 
calories or dietary carbs for around 800 million individuals worldwide (Otun et al. 2022). Cassava 
roots contain 30%–40% more dry matter than other types of roots, such as yams and potatoes. Even 
though cassava produces much-needed starch, it is challenging to cultivate for smallholder farmers 
due to biotic and abiotic factors such as climate change and temperature changes (Mwiinde et al. 
2022). The development of cassava varieties with a higher starch content has been identified as a 
significant area for development. Despite the problems, recent studies indicate that there are a range 
of strategies available to increase the quality and output of cassava starch (Adéyèmi et al. 2020). 
According to Zidenga et al. (2017), scientists isolated and characterized cassava gene homologs 
involved in processes such as the conversion of assimilated carbon to sucrose in photosynthetic 
cells, the transport of sucrose to storage organs through the phloem, the conversion of sucrose to 
starch, and the breakdown of starch into simple sugars in order to improve the function of starch. 
Karlström et al. (2016) assert that by altering the activity of the genes, the molecular and functional 
characterization of the genes involved in these processes can greatly increase the amount of starch in 
cassava. Additionally, it is now possible to genetically modify cassava roots to produce more starch 
of a higher quality and with greater yields due to advances in the understanding of starch production 
and the identification of the genes responsible for it (Ahimbisibwe et al. 2020). It is believed that 
hairpin dsRNAs targeting the 1,4-alpha-glucan-branching enzyme (be1) genes were constitutively 
expressed in transgenic cassava, resulting in the manufacture of starches containing up to 50% 
amylose (Otun et al. 2022). In addition, Otun et al. (2022) report that by editing genes related to the 
starch synthesis pathway, researchers were able to create cassava mutants known as MESSIII-1 and 
MESSIII-2 derived from the MESSIII genes. This finding prompted the investigation of the role of 
genes in regulating the formation of amylopectin glucan in cassava. Using CRISPR/Cas9 to directly 
change the two genes responsible for producing amylose, PTST1 and GBSS, the amylose content of 
root starch can be lowered or completely removed, according to the research by Zsögön et al. (2018).
The production of animal feeds has expanded significantly because of the new commercializa￾tion of cassava, increasing the crop’s yield by 11.5%–33%. However, the use of cassava in animal 
feed has forced researchers to focus on how the cassava plant’s cell walls affect the availability of 
nutrients, particularly starch, as well as efforts to abolish the presence of cyanogenic glycosides in 
all of its parts. Using an exogenous non-starch polysaccharide degrading enzyme product (NSPase) 
and sun-drying cassava chips for a few days until the moisture content is reduced to 100–140mg 
may improve the shelf life of the product by releasing the volatile hydrogen cyanide (Staack et al. 
2019). According to Staack et al. (2019), the use of enzymes in animal feed reduces variation in 
raw material quality and permits the use of a greater diversity of raw materials, even those that 
are difficult to digest. This decreases the variation in nutritional value across batches of identi￾cal ingredients. Staack is aware that enzymes can help form prebiotic oligomers by acting on cell 
wall polysaccharides, which are advantageous to an animal’s digestive health, and that they can 
help reduce the viscosity of feed raw materials containing high concentrations of NSP. Previous 
research has linked the breakdown of homogalacturonan and the release of 1,4-D-galactan and 
1,5-L-arabinan to a reduction in cassava viscosity (Staack et al. 2019). Cassava has lately proved its 
utility in the production of animal feed in Zambia. In recent years, large quantities of cassava have 
been purchased from contract farmers by foreign companies like Zambia Brewery and Zhongkai 
International to produce ethanol, ethanol for industrial use, glue, and food for animals. For instance, 
the presence of ethanol in hand sanitizers has aided in the fight against COVID-19 (Silimina 2021). 
The production of large, healthy cassava that can be used in homes and sold as agreed upon for Polysaccharides for Agricultural Applications 267
the industrial process requires a large number of farmers, as can be seen in Figure 15.1. In light 
of COVID-19 restrictions and the conflict between Ukraine and Russia, businesses have recently 
been employed in the production of biofertilizers and in assisting to lower the cost of agricultural 
production (Zeufack et al. 2022). As can be seen in Figure 15.2, where farmers are observing a 
demonstration for educational purposes, extension services are necessary for cassava cultivators to 
have healthy plants and good tubers.
Mr. Chen, managing director of Zhongkai International, was quoted in Silimina (2021)’s study 
as saying, “Our ultimate product is ethanol, which is why we require this crop (cassava).” “For 
instance, the cassava from Mansa District contains 75% starch, and we discovered that Zambia pro￾duces the most cassava in Africa,” said Chen Guiping, CEO of Zhongkai International, in an inter￾view with ChinAfrica. “Before creating the business, we visited all African nations and discovered 
that Zambian produce had the greatest starch content; hence, we built the facility in Zambia.” Chen 
disclosed that his company uses over 200 tons of dried cassava and that a farmer may easily earn 
K5,000 ($231) from just 1 lima (0.49acre) of land, which can go a long way toward supporting their 
way of life. Mr. Chen stated that his company required cassava in order to manufacture methylated 
spirits, hand sanitizers, cooking gel, and ethanol for blending with gasoline as fuel.

15.1.2 Polysaccharides from Cassava Production and Marketing in Zambia
Over the years, Zambia just like many countries in Southern Africa has been battling with eco￾nomic diversification moving away mineral-dependent nation to agriculture. Within the agricultural 
sector, maize, cotton, and wheat have been extensively grown by smallholder and commercial farm￾ers as major suppliers of polysaccharide products. The government has outlined the function of the 
private sector as the engine of agricultural diversification in the face of climate change through 
Zambia Vision 2030 and national agricultural policy documents (MoF 2006; SNAP 2016). The 
country has strategically positioned itself to explore the production of cassava as the alternative crop 
to supply starch to the population and the industry in light of the rising cost of production for the 
maize crop due to global inflation rates, the Ukrainian-Russian conflict, and the lost market value 
for cotton globally (Chilufya & Mulendema 2019; McCord et al. 2015; Oswake 2021; Sekwati 2012; 
Zeufack et al. 2022).
With unpredictable climate change which interface with droughts and floods, the country could 
find itself in polysaccharides shortage to support the industry whose animals and human growing 
population (Hussain et al. 2020). Therefore, cassava being a drought-tolerant crop due to its physi￾ological genetically designed has been promoted and has attracted many processors for animals 
and human feed/food, alcohol/ethanol, exports/imports, paper, and charcoal fines binder among 
many different uses (Reincke et al. 2018). Therefore, cassava being a drought-tolerant crop due to 
its physiological genetically designed has been promoted and has attracted many processors for 
animals and human feed/food, alcohol/ethanol, exports/imports, paper, and charcoal fines binder 
among many different uses (Reincke et al. 2018). Based on the cassava value chain assessment 
done by Mwansakilwa et al. in 2011 and a review of other relevant literature, the largest market for 
cassava flour or dry cassava (dc) chips in Zambia is thought to be 3,530,019 MT. This number was 
figured out using government policies on biofuels and the Cassava Expansion Strategy 2020–2024 
for market development and diversification (Szyniszewska et al., 2021). The active/licensed alcohol/
ethanol market, worth 102,250 MT dry cassava, and the exports/imports market, worth 49,506 MT 
dry cassava, are the two second-largest end markets. With 2,544 MT of dry cassava, the combined 
paper and charcoal binding markets are incredibly modest(Szyniszewska et al., 2021).
15.1.3 Processing of Cassava Ethanol to Create Ethanol-Based Products
According to Mwansakilwa et al. (2021) report, the beverage and bioethanol sectors can use cassava 
to create a diversity of products. The report states that due to restricted capacity, Zambian Breweries 
(ZB) uses HQCF to produce beer (Eagle Lager), which only needs a maximum of 4,000 dry metric 
tonnes. The establishment of ethanol production facilities in each of the five major cassava-produc￾ing provinces is suggested by the ethanol production business model. The three major companies 
currently using cassava for the manufacturing of bioethanol are Sunbird, Zhongkai International, 
and Thomro Investments, with Thomro Investments operating a prototype plant with a daily capac￾ity of 2 MT. The goal of Sunbird’s ethanol production is to provide 120 million litres of biofuel 
yearly, or around 10% of Zambia’s gasoline imports.
At a minimum yield of 6 MT of dry cassava per hectare, Zambia’s farming community would 
make US$ 346.1 million just from the provision of bioethanol feedstock. According to conversion 
from the Cassava value chain study, a tonne of dry cassava may yield roughly 330L at a cost of the 
US $0.72 per L (or K12.68/lt at the exchange rate K17.61/dollar posted at the Bank of Zambia website 
on April 5, 2022) (Mwansakilwa et al. 2021). 146,000 MT of dried cassava per year is the start-up 
market with a ready offtake for the E10 ethanol blending announced by the Zambian government.
According to estimates, ethanol products will require 3,529,686 MT of dry cassava (hydrous 
ethanol), 1.924 million MT of hydrous ethanol to replace gasoline in transportation, 61,920 MT of 
hydrous ethanol to replace kerosene, 7,000 MT of hydrous ethanol to replace non-biodegradable 
plastics and similar materials, and 14,510 MT of hydrous ethanol for sanitizers to replace chlorine. Polysaccharides for Agricultural Applications 269
Government will create an enabling environment, but private sector investment will be used to 
produce ethanol. The agribusiness center and the ethanol processors will enter into agreements for 
the ongoing supply of raw cassava and/or cassava chips/starch for ethanol production. Now that the 
ethanol production methods are reasonably understood locally, a dedicated fund will be formed 
to support the bioenergy/biofuels industry. A production facility for ethanol is thought to cost $5 
million to start up.
Regarding government assistance, there is a legal framework, a national energy policy, and a 
national strategy (the Zambia Cassava Sector Development Strategy (2020–2024)) that all support 
the use of ethanol for transportation, the replacement of charcoal, and the production of bread using 
some wheat–cassava composite flour. One of the end markets for cassava in the Zambia Cassava 
Sector Development Strategy 2020–2024 is ethanol for transportation and other purposes (Chikoti 
et al., 2019). The trends in automotive technology that are moving away from fossil fuels and toward 
greener alternatives provide additional encouragement. The e-biofuel cell is one of the best tech￾nologies for Zambia, which has a lackluster infrastructure and uses electric vehicles as one example.
The profitability of ethanol production in Zambia is dependent on the production setup, 
according to an economic analysis of the industry. Cassava Gross Margin Analysis Based on 
Traditional Production and Family Labour Only (TFL) and Gross Margin Analysis with Subsidized 
Mechanization both show good returns for ethanol producers (SM). According to estimates by 
Mwansakilwa et al., the Cassava Gross Margin Analysis on ethanol production using traditional 
Economic Labour Prices (TEL) indicated a loss of 4.1% at the current level of cassava productivity 
(2021).
15.1.4 Carbohydrates and Fiber Are Two Macronutrients
Humans and other non-ruminant animals have difficulty metabolizing fiber for energy or other 
nutritional needs, according to research (Turck et al. 2021). Due to the fact that fiber adds bulk to 
meals, it can satisfy hunger without adding many calories to the diet. There is an abundance of 
scientific evidence demonstrating the multiple health benefits of long-term dietary fiber consump￾tion, including its ability to reduce the incidence of colon and other cancers, despite the ongoing 
debates. Recent microbiome twin studies that examined the relationships between diet and gut 
microbial community structure and function discovered that differences in our gut microbiome 
ecology influence our propensity for obesity or malnutrition and that diet, not applied probiotics, 
was the single most significant indicator of gut health (Pino et al. 2022). These studies evaluate the 
intestinal microbiota/microbiome of malnourished or malnourished concordant or discordant twins 
residing in numerous developing nations and who provided samples soon before, during, and after 
therapy. Specific gut bacteria, primarily Bifidobacteria, digest dietary fiber or other unabsorbed 
carbohydrates to create short-chain saturated fatty acids. These short-chain fatty acids may trig￾ger apoptosis, inhibit 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme-A reductase (HMG-CoAR), and boost 
mineral absorption, hence decreasing LDL production and avoiding colon cancer (Grothmann and 
Patt 2005). Individual sugars such as sucrose and fructose, as well as polymeric carbohydrates such 
as starches and fructans, can be produced by plants (Hyeon et al. 2020). The biosynthesis of these 
molecules is sufficiently well understood that crops can be genetically altered to create polysac￾charides that aren’t ordinarily produced, and their properties can be bioengineered. In sugar beet 
and potato, polymeric carbohydrates such as fructans, inulins, and amylase (resistant starch) have 
been created without affecting growth or phenotypic variety, according to study (Yuan et al. 2021). 
Using a similar method, soybean cultivars having oligo-fructan components that raise populations 
of helpful bacterial species in the intestines of humans and animals while suppressing the growth 
of bad bacteria are being developed (Asghar et al. 2021; la Peña-Armada et al. 2021). According 
to Li et al. (2022), polysaccharides are used in agriculture to improve the structure and texture 
of soil. A study was undertaken to develop a brand-new sort of multifunctional soil conditioner 
utilizing the 4-arm star-shaped polymer-modified mesoporous MCM-41 as a urea transporter and 270 Polysaccharides
toxic material scavenger. A silane coupling agent was utilized to couple the star-shaped polymer 
with MCM-41. According to the results, modified MCM-41 performed around 50% better than 
raw MCM-41 in terms of its effect on urea release. The crop’s growth was successfully boosted by 
20%–25%, while loading efficiency (LE) and encapsulation efficiency (EE) increased by around 
39% and 42%, respectively. In addition, the 4-arm polymer-modified mesoporous MCM-41 pos￾sesses excellent methylene blue adsorption characteristics. Due to its unique structure, the modified 
MCM-41 exhibited high biocompatibility and negligible biological toxicity. The results suggest 
further that the multifunctional soil conditioner is appropriate for use in agricultural management 
strategies to improve the soil environment and promote crop growth. Due to its increased and sus￾tained kinetic energy, the soil conditioner was effective in terms of prolonged release, absorption, 
and crop growth stimulation.
Wang et al. (2021) looked into the effectiveness of pH-responsive gel spheres for controlled 
release of humic acid (CSGCHs) using an integrated instillation technique with a composite mate￾rial made of sodium alginate (SA) and charcoal-activated carbon (CAC) as a carrier. The goal of the 
study was to find out how well pH-responsive gel spheres work for slow release, changing pH, and 
improving soil. During soil remediation trials, it was found that humic acid (CSGCH) was effective 
in repairing a variety of soil types. After 50days of cleanup, the amount of nutrients and organic 
matter in the soil went up a lot, while the pH and salt content of the salty soils went down by 15.2% 
and 29.8%, respectively. In the plant experiment, CSGCH was shown to make plants grow faster. 
This means that the soil conditioner that was made could be used in agriculture to improve soil 
conditions and make plants grow faster.
It is obvious that polysaccharides play a critical role in maintaining and preparing soils for 
increased agricultural output and productivity, which benefits both the economy and the environ￾ment. Even though these results are encouraging, it is crucial that farmers utilize climate-smart 
agricultural techniques and inputs to maximize results through soil cultivation and use over gen￾erations (Jagustović et al. 2021; FAO 2013). According to Figure 15.3, polysaccharides are used 
to increase the soil conditioning as way of giving life to plants and living animals and ultimately 
reducing human poverty.
FIGURE 15.3 Graphical representation of the soil conditioner polysaccharide (Li et al. 2022).Polysaccharides for Agricultural Applications 271
As shown in Table 15.1, cellulose and lignin make up the majority of the chemical components 
of fibers like coir, banana, pineapple leaf, sisal, palmyra, sun hemp, and others. Both lignin and cel￾lulose are constituents of natural fibers; these celluloses have numerous fibrils running along them 
and are linked by hydrogen bonds, which give them strength and flexibility.
15.1.5 The Fundamentals of Superabsorbent Hydrogels (SH)
The use of “superabsorbent hydrogels” (SH), made of soil polysaccharides, has been beneficial 
for soil conditioning. Hydrophilic polymers that are crosslinked chemically or physically form 
three-dimensional (3-D) matrices called hydrogels. These matrices can be linear or have multiple 
branches. According to Baloch et al. (2020), they have the ability to absorb enormous amounts of 
water or biological fluids over a predetermined period of time.
Numerous studies have demonstrated that SH can maintain network stability even when it is 
bloated in a crosslinked structure, ensuring SH stability in a range of media and situations and 
being the cause of these characteristics (Baloch et al. 2021; Khan et al. 2021). The crosslinking of 
hydrogels can be done via chemical or physical means. According to Souza et al. (2022), the key 
characteristic of chemically crosslinked SH is the establishment of irreversible covalent connections 
between the polymeric chains. As a result, chemical hydrogels have been made using a range of 
crosslinking processes, including radical polymerization, the reactivity of complimentary groups, 
grafting reactions, and enzymes. Physically crosslinked hydrogels have interactions between their 
crosslinks that are caused by H-bonds, Van der Waals forces, and electrostatic forces. These interac￾tions hold together the polymeric chains. In the last type of hydrogel, crosslinking can be undone, 
and the matrix can be destroyed under certain conditions. According to Rivas et al. (2021), the type 
of crosslinking used to make SH has a substantial effect on many key variables, the final proper￾ties of SH, and, consequently, the possible applications for SH. The crosslinking approach affects 
a variety of properties, such as the ability to absorb water, swelling kinetics, mechanical and rheo￾logical properties, rate of deterioration, porosity, and toxicity (Rivas et al. 2021). SH synthesis must 
be tuned to the ultimate application to produce materials that exhibit (or are capable of exhibiting) 
desired responses, such as fast swelling, degradability, porosity, and so on. Obviously, more criteria 
may need to be met to guarantee specific features. For instance, Rivas et al. (2021) observed that the 
polymer type can improve the hydrophilicity and (bio)degradability of the SH matrix. Frequently, 
acrylic monomers and polymers are used as the primary building blocks in the production of high￾performance SH that meets the required specifications. Polyacrylamide, poly(acrylic acid), and 
other polyacrylates have been used for a very long time to produce high-performance superab￾sorbent materials (Rivas et al. 2021). As environmental concerns have grown, the use of polymers 
derived from free oil has expanded. According to Etaemadi Baloch et al. (2021), the use of certain 
monomers (or polymers) in SH synthesis permits the fabrication of stimuli-responsive materials 
that can react differently depending on the medium’s conditions. According to Guilherme et al. 
(2015), SH constructed from thermos-responsive polymers such as poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) 
and poly(N,N-diethylacrylamide) can be hydrophobic or hydrophilic, making it stimuli-responsive 
and known as “smart soft material that responds to external (environmental) stimuli.” The develop￾ment of innovative SH exploiting polysaccharides such as pectin, cashew gum, Arabic gum, starch, 
chitosan, and chitin appears to have been motivated by, among other factors, low cost, abundance, 
renewability, and biodegradability. Molasses, a byproduct of the sugar cane industry, can be used in 
the construction of farms and agricultural soils (Kibiti & Ndegwa 2016). Figure 15.4 demonstrates 
how and where molasses is combined with maize grain and fed to animals as an energy source 
(Siankwilimba 2019). Molasses has been utilized in numerous countries as a supplement to animal 
feed, as depicted in Figure 15.4.
Molasses is frequently used as the primary ingredient in road construction in nations with sug￾arcane plantations instead of bituminous materials (Kibiti & Ndegwa 2016; Prudhvi & Rao 2017; 
Solomon et al. 2020). A byproduct of the refining of sugar cane is molasses, a syrupy liquid that is 272 Polysaccharides
viscous, dark brown, and generated in large quantities. Another name for it is treacle. It contains 
resinous and inorganic components, making it unfit for human consumption. According to Prudhvi 
and Rao (2017), adding 10% molasses to a soil sample causes the cohesiveness to rise from 0.25 to 
0.6 and the friction angle to rise from 9° to 19°. After being treated with 10% molasses and lime, 
the maximum dry density of the soil increased from 1.89 to 1.933 gm cm–3. The optimal moisture 
content of the soil went from 10.0% to 12.0% after the addition of molasses and lime. The soil’s 
coefficient of permeability was decreased by adding 10% molasses and lime, going from 4.566E￾05 to 2.06E-05. According to these results, stabilizing soil with molasses and lime increased the 
soil’s strength properties by 7%–10%. Hareru and Ghebrab (2020) also said that using bio-asphalt 
in asphalt mixtures is now seen as one of the best ways to use less bitumen, which is good for the 
environment, the economy, and people’s health in farm blocks. Even though studies have shown 
that bio-asphalts are sensitive to moisture, which can have a big effect on the durability of hot￾mix asphalt (HMA) pavements, they are still used as a bitumen substitute to build pavements and 
roads, especially when sugarcane molasses is used instead of bitumen because it is better for the 
environment and costs less to build with. Hareru and Ghebrab (2020) say that it makes asphalt pave￾ments more resistant to heat and cuts greenhouse gas emissions by up to 30%. Hareru and Ghebrab 
(2020)’s study asserts that 4.7% and 13%–15% for bitumen with a 30-viscosity grade, 0%–3% and 
9% for bitumen with a 60%–70% penetration grade, and 0%–10% and 5%–20% for bitumen with 
a 50%–70% penetration grade were some of the numbers used in research studies to find the best 
% of molasses to replace bitumen when making HMA. Molasses can be used in place of bitumen 
to improve the performance of the pavement. As shown in Figures 15.3 and 15.4, the production of 
sugar could have helped build highways and many agricultural areas. Compared to regular gravel 
roads without molasses, these roads are much, much better, as shown in Figure 15.5.
Using Zambia as a case study, Figure 15.6 demonstrates how sugar companies compete to gener￾ate one of the essential polysaccharides utilized by humans and animals in agricultural development. 
15.1.6 Cellulose a Form of Polysaccharide
Cellulose is a low-cost biopolymer made from renewable resources such as the walls of wood and 
plant cells, bacteria, algae, and, bizarrely, tunicates, the only known organisms that contain cel￾lulose. According to a study, the annual industrial production in the globe is expected to exceed 
1.5 million tons, with the cotton and wood industries, which consume 98% and 90% of pulp, 
FIGURE 15.4 A cattle herd at a feedlot consuming molasses, a byproduct of sugar cane.Polysaccharides for Agricultural Applications 273
respectively, accounting for the majority of this output (Souza et al. 2022). Souza et al. (2022) say 
that cellulose is the most common polymer in nature. It has a high molecular weight and a strong 
tendency to form fibers with crystals. It is made of glucose monomers linked at positions 1–4. Based 
on how the carbon skeleton and hydrogen bonds are set up, there are four polymorphic forms: I, 
II, III, and IV. The five basic sources of cellulose are wood, plants and their byproducts, algae, 
animals, and microbes (Zuo et al. 2012). Tertiary sources include processed waste products from 
the usage, transformation, and conversion of ethanol. Secondary sources are things like bark and 
leaves that come directly from the food industry, agriculture (Siankwilimba et al. 2021), or forestry 
(Siankwilimba et al. 2021). Traditional or primary resources are used to make textile fibers, paper, 
wood for building, and ethanol. The initial three levels of cellulose origin are plant-based. Due to 
their chemical makeup, many plant remains can separate cellulose molecules. However, not all 
agricultural waste has a high concentration of cellulose, which makes extraction difficult or impos￾sible in some cases, like with bagasse. On the other hand, pseudo-stems, stalks, maize cobs, and 
barks are useful agricultural supplies because they have more than 40% cellulose. Several factors, 
such as storage, moisture, pollution, volume, distance from industrial processing facilities, other 
possible uses, like compost or fertilizer, local resources, and logistics facilities, could help or hurt 
the process of extracting cellulose for biotechnology applications. The Brazilian Biomass Industries 
Association (Fărcaş et al. 2021) gave a way to figure out the residual factor in the study. Therefore,

grain waste may be classified as cellulosic biomass. According to Fărcaş et al. (2021), rice had the 
lowest residual factor, but maize had the lowest cellulose content, with just 18%, despite having 
the highest amount of cellulose, up to 44%. Cereals have different qualities based on their species 
and how they are made, such as whether they are milled dry or wet. Rice and barley are pearled, 
but maize and wheat are ground wet and dry, respectively. Maize waste consists of biomasses such 
as cob, husk, germ, bran, and gluten (Fărcaş et al. 2021). Compared to the other cereals, this crop 
had the highest annual output and residual amounts, at about 1,200 and 700 million metric tons, 
respectively. This demonstrates its excellent viability in the extraction of cellulose and hemicellu￾lose. Considering this, extensive study has linked cellulose to the textile mills where clothing and 
other materials are produced (Alexander 2016). On this foundation, animal wool is not exceptional. 
According to recent report from The Economist website (2022) of 2,907, million metric tons, nearly 
half of all grain is either burned as biofuel or consumed by animals, meaning that humans do not 
consume most of the world’s grain as shown in Figure 15.7. As such cereals remain, the global 
sources of polysaccharides used in fuels and animal feeds and the rest human consumption. 
15.1.7 Chitosan/Chitin Use in Agriculture
Over 20 years ago, it was discovered that cell wall-produced oligosaccharides might be used to con￾trol plant growth, defense, and development. Natural compounds called chitin and chitosan are 
crucial in agriculture and a few other industries. Because they strengthen plants’ defences against 
invasive microorganisms, they are also known as “defence boosters.” Chitin and chitosan have been 
demonstrated in numerous studies to activate defence mechanisms in plants, promoting seed germi￾nation, plant growth, and yields (Salama 2020; Khan et al. 2021; Luo et al. 2022). For the past 
100years, chemical fertilizers and insecticides have been the mainstays of crop security. The chem￾ical pesticide, on the other hand, has two sides to it because it has the ability to both heal and 
destroy. Overuse of pesticides and fertilizers helps farmers produce more, but these practices have 
negative effects on biological diversity, agricultural systems, and public health. They can also breed 
resistant strains of organisms (Marczak et al. 2020; Jastrzębska & Vasilchenko 2021). The bioactivi￾ties of chitosan and its derivatives, which include triggering a defence mechanism in plants and

animals as well as encouraging plant and animal growth, have long been acknowledged as being 
significant in agricultural applications. For instance, according to Kumar et al. (2020), various 
inputs, including seeds, were coated with carboxymethyl, hydroxyethyl-chitin, and depolymerized 
chitin before being sown in the ground. According to Kumar et al. (2020), some studies revealed 
that chitin and chitosan addition increased the plant’s dry weight by 8% and increased crop produc￾tion by 12%. In order to get over some of chitosan’s technological drawbacks, like brittleness, lim￾ited elongation, and flexibility, coatings appear to be created by mixing it with other biotechnologically 
active substances (Siankwilimba et al., 2023). According to research (Duncan et al. 2021; Martey 
et al. 2021), composite coatings consisting of chitosan, poly(vinyl) alcohol, lignin nanoparticles, and 
other polysaccharides exhibit better plastic resilience than their constituent components. According 
to Berliana et al. (2020), chitosan biopolymer can be utilized to protect food goods, promote plant 
growth, and provide abiotic and biotic stress tolerance in various horticulture commodities. Chitin 
and chitosan research has been prioritized since 1990 because of its outstanding properties, includ￾ing biodegradation in the human body, control of plant diseases, immunological, antibacterial, anti￾fungal, and wound-healing action. Chitin and chitosan are thus gaining popularity as cutting-edge 
functional materials in agricultural development. The chitosan biopolymer is a viable option for the 
induction of plant defensive systems and the stimulation of plant growth, both of which are crucial 
in agricultural applications, despite their intriguing biological characteristics. The evocative effects 
of chitin and chitosan fragments promote the accumulation of phytoalexins, the production of lignin 
and cellulose, pathogen-related proteins, and proteinase inhibitors in host plants in response to 
microbial infections (Berliana et al. 2020). Chitosan’s use in agriculture for plant defence and yield 
improvement is mostly dependent on how this glucosamine polymer impacts the molecular biology 
and biochemistry of the plant cell. In the 20th century, chitosan was employed in agriculture, espe￾cially in agricultural arenas all over the world, to feed the population that was constantly expanding 
by increasing productivity per area of land used for food production (Sangiorgio et al. 2021). The 
discussion is furthered by Kumar et al. (2020), who state that a special modified form of chitosan 
called chitosan nanoparticles has been used as a practical delivery system for pesticides, fertilizers, 
herbicides, and micronutrients for crop growth promotion through balanced and sustained nutrition. 
Chitosan was discovered to be capable of triggering defense against more than 60 diseases in a 
variety of plants, according to research by Asghar et al. (2021). Chitosan promotes the accumulation 
of phytoalexins, which trigger antifungal responses and strengthen defense against upcoming infec￾tions. Orchid leaf spot disease has been shown to be significantly less severe when chitosan is 
sprayed on the plants. Chitosan has the potential to stimulate the synthesis of plant hormones like 
gibberellins. In addition, a signaling pathway associated with auxin synthesis that is unrelated to 
tryptophan may be used by chitosan to promote growth and development. On the other hand, chito￾san has conflicting results in terms of growth and development. According to Berliana et al. (2020)’s 
findings, chitosan significantly enhanced A’s height. The results showed that the number of leaves 
increased by a lot at 10ppm, and hybridus increased by up to 19.59%. However, chitosan treatment 
had no effect on chlorophyll content, fresh or dry weight, even though the dosage response peaked 
at 10 ppm. Chitosan therapy might be a good way to help many crops deal with drought stress, espe￾cially in developing countries where climate change is wreaking havoc in unpredictable ways 
(Mwiinde et al. 2022). Chitosan also decreased transpiration rates by 36.66%–66.26% (Maulu et al. 
2021; Siankwilimba et al. 2022). Recent research by Stasińska-Jakubas and Hawrylak (2022) shows 
that chitin and chitosan can be made from insects and some types of fungus as well as seafood. 
According to the study, traditional chemical processes usually need close to 30kg of wet shrimp 
shells to make 1 kg of chitin. On the other hand, traditional chemical processes usually need up to 
1.5kg of chitin and many acidic and alkaline substances to make 1kg of chitosan. Chitin is a poly￾saccharide that doesn’t dissolve in water. This is because the oxygen of the acetamido group inter￾acts with nearby NH or OH function groups (Teixeira-Costa & Andrade 2021). Teixeira-Costa and 
Andrade (2021) also said that the amount of N-acetylation in chitin chains has a big effect on its 
insolubility in water, which limits its ability to swell and, as a result, its use in industry. Allomorphs, 276 Polysaccharides
pogonophoran, and vestimentiferan worms produce the chitin that is present in squid pens. Even 
though there are more chitin forms, it is uncommon to find them produced by worms like pogo￾nophoran and vestimentiferan worms and combined with proteins (Khan et al. 2021). The different 
orientations of the microfibrils in the three crystalline phases make it possible to make a wide range 
of functional materials that can be used for medical, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and immuno￾logical purposes. When chitin is extracted and deacetylated to make chitosan, dangerous or toxic 
solvents are often used, processing yields are limited, toxic wastewater effluent is made, and pro￾cessing costs are high. As long-term solutions to these problems, green strategies like using deep 
eutectic solvents and ionic liquids have been put in place (Teixeira-Costa & Andrade 2021). Like 
other polysaccharides made from residues, chitin’s biological functions depend on its molecular 
weight and level of deacetylation. For example, higher levels of deacetylation make reactions stron￾ger. The physicochemical properties of chitin and chitosan can be affected by where the raw materi￾als come from, when they are harvested, and how they are processed (Nwe et al. 2014). Pure chitosan 
only has a few industrial uses, so it can be made more useful by making its structure chemically 
functional and crosslinking it to many molecules. Both chitin and chitosan are utilized in the bio￾medical industry to administer medications. Saberi Riseh et al. (2021) say that both biopolymers are 
used to make hypocholesterolemic dietary supplements, to control the transfer of drugs, and to take 
allergenic proteins out of certain meals. In tissue engineering, they help heal and regrow epithelial 
tissue in both humans and cattle. They are also used in antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, sunscreen, 
and anti-aging cosmetics (Guarner et al. 2004). Chitosan has a wide range of applications in food 
technology, including extending the shelf life of foods like bread and apples. Its ability to inhibit 
microbial growth and reduce starch retrogradation in both food preparation and the creation of coat￾ing packaging with bioactive properties makes these applications possible.
Polysaccharides contain inherent storage qualities, such as starch, or structural properties, such 
as cellulose, which offer physical structure and stability as shown in Figure 15.8. Positively charged 
polysaccharides (chitosan) and negatively charged polysaccharides, such as heparin alginate, pectin, 
and hyaluronic acid, can be categorized based on polyelectrolyte. Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) as 
stated in Figure 15.8 are extensively investigated major components of the cell surface and the cell￾extracellular matrix (ECM). Heparin, heparan sulfate, hyaluronan, chondroitin sulfate, dermatan 
FIGURE 15.8 Grouping of polysaccharides based on the kind of monosaccharide constituents and their 
physiological effects. Source: Mohammed et al. (2021) and author computation.Polysaccharides for Agricultural Applications 277
sulfate, and keratan sulfate are the most prominent GAGs polysaccharides in mammalian tissues. 
As shown in Figure 15.8, there are numerous sources of polysaccharides, including plants like 
soyabeans and maize, microbes, algae, and mammals, such as cattle, goats, and sheep. Expected 
to their physicochemical features, they are susceptible to physical and chemical alterations that 
result in increased properties; this is the fundamental notion underlying their wide range of bio￾logical and pharmacological uses. According to Mohammed et al. (2021), chemical modifications 
of polysaccharides, such as sulfation, phosphorylation, and carboxymethylation, are highly effec￾tive procedures for modifying and changing the biological properties of polysaccharides, making 
them suitable for drug delivery systems in various drug preparations because they can be more 
stable, non-toxic, and biodegradable. Furthermore, Mohammed et al. (2021) discussed that chemical 
changes such as grafting, crosslinking, complexation, and covalent coupling increase the potential 
for drug transport and, thus, enhance the therapeutic efficacy. They may also serve as a suitable sub￾stitute for certain excipients or synthetic polymers. It is argued that traditional polysaccharides have 
been used in vaccines by virtue of them containing pollutants and impurities in their heterogeneous 
combinations; thus, the chemically synthesized polysaccharides-based vaccination can solve these 
deficiencies (Khan et al. 2021; Khalina et al. 2015; Teixeira-Costa & Andrade 2021).
Suffice to note that stability, hydrophilicity, and biodegradability, as well as other features such 
as the diversity of physicochemical properties of natural polysaccharides, serve as the basis for its 
vast array of biological features (Teixeira-Costa & Andrade 2021). It has been demonstrated that 
the biochemical and physical characteristics of polysaccharides have contributed to their biological 
uses. Additionally, polysaccharides are indispensable macromolecules that almost occur in all liv￾ing organisms and have important functions in the body. Mohammed et al. (2021) stated that they 
are getting increasing attention seeing as they exhibit a wide range of biological and functional 
properties, including antitumor, immunomodulatory, antimicrobial, antioxidant, anticoagulant, 
anti-diabetic, antiviral, and hypoglycemia activities, making them one of the most promising candi￾dates in the biomedical and pharmaceutical fields.
15.1.8 Development of Agriculture Using Inulin
The naturally occurring polysaccharide inulin is present in over 30,000 different plant species, and 
the most widely used commercial sources are cereals, tubers, and roots (Souza et al. 2022; Kilic 
et al., 2021). It might be due to its flavor neutrality and health benefits. A remarkable biofortification 
ingredient is inulin, which is categorized as a dietary fiber. Cardullo et al. (2022) list chicory, aspar￾agus, garlic, banana, onion, rye, barley, and wheat as the foods that typically contain this polysac￾charide’s residual sources. They also mention that it can be discovered in unexpected places, such as 
aça seeds. Let’s just say that enzymatically produced inulin can also be obtained from potatoes that 
have undergone genetic modification. As a result, it’s possible to find food residues from foods like 
onions (18%) and garlic (28% of dry mass), which have a little bit more inulin (Souza et al. 2022). 
Numerous studies claim that inulin is a unique oligo- or polysaccharide because each sugar ring is 
a part of its backbone, which consists of linear fructose chains connected by glycosidic connections 
created by 2–100 monomeric units (Branca et al. 2022). According to some studies, it has more 
flexibility than pyranose rings because the majority of its chains are furanose groups (Melilli et al. 
2020). Due to its lengthy polymeric chain and glycosidic connections in the -(2-1) position, which 
render it insoluble at body temperatures and resistant to salivary amylase and intestinal enzymes, 
inulin has the potential to be used in the food and pharmaceutical industries (Souza et al. 2022).
Because it has up to ten fructose units that are useful in agriculture, inulin is called a fructo￾oligosaccharide (FOS) and is considered a prebiotic (Su et al. 2007). Rakhesh et al. (2015) say that 
many plants use inulin to store carbohydrates. Because of this, it can be found in the parts of fruits 
and vegetables that are left over after processing, such as husks, seeds, stems, and bagasse. The 
majority of the time, these by-products are a result of processing techniques like pulping, wash￾ing, sieving, and food bleaching, all of which are necessary for the processing and preservation of 278 Polysaccharides
food (Padalino et al. 2017). Rakhesh et al. (2015) say that the biomedical and agricultural fields are 
interested in biotechnological applications based on inulin, especially for nutritional or medical 
purposes. According to many studies, inulin is used to replace fats and sugars in foods because it 
has health benefits (Raccuia & Melilli 2004; Nejati et al. 2017). This makes it possible to make ice 
cream and other high-fiber foods with fewer calories (Nejati et al. 2017). This is probably because 
inulin doesn’t get broken down in the digestive system, which makes it possible to make functional 
foods. There have been many studies on fructan extraction, but few papers (Valluru & Van Den 
Ende 2008; Branca et al. 2022) have been written about how to improve the extraction process. It 
looks like inulin has been used as an ingredient in bioactive functional meals to help bifidobacteria 
and other good microorganisms grow in the gut microbiota, which is good for humans. It is used in 
the pharmaceutical industry as a bioactive carrier. In this case, inulin can help get more of the drug 
to the last part of the digestive system and stop it from breaking down in the upper part of the diges￾tive system, which delays the drug’s early breakdown. In this method, when the inulin gets to the 
colon, bacteria from the local microbiome break it down. This makes it easier for the body to absorb 
minerals and ions from food. In relation to the aforementioned advantages, inulin concentration 
enhances product texture. But because of its physical and chemical properties, high concentrations 
of inulin may change the way products feel. Inulin may have an impact on the sensory qualities of 
numerous products. The physicochemical significance of inulin depends on the extent of its polym￾erization. Inulin’s short-chain oligosaccharides are sweeter and more soluble than its long-chain 
oligosaccharides. It has qualities that are similar to those of other sugars and can make the tongue 
feel better. So, a prebiotic is a part of food that can’t be digested but is good for the host because it 
promotes the growth and/or activity of one or a small number of bacteria in the colon, which is good 
for human health (Schuster 2005; Dahiya & Nigam 2012). The International Scientific Association 
for Probiotics and Prebiotics (ISAPP) defined prebiotics in 2008 as “a selectively fermented ingredi￾ent that causes specific changes in the composition and/or activity of the gastrointestinal microbiota, 
thereby benefiting host health” (Abed et al. 2016). Abed et al.’s (2016) research states that in order for 
something to be classified as having a prebiotic effect, it must first meet the following requirements: 
(i) Fermentation by bacteria in the gut; (ii) Resistance to the acid in the stomach; (iii) Breakdown 
by enzymes in mammals; and (iv) the ability to boost the growth and/or activity of gut bacteria that 
are good for health. A product is said to be symbiotic if it has both probiotics and prebiotics. This 
is because probiotics and prebiotics work together to keep the bacteria in the intestines in balance. 
According to this theory, the term “symbiotic” can only be used if the prebiotic has a positive effect 
on the growth of the probiotic. Liu et al. (2020) say that probiotics are living microorganisms that 
help the host, especially animals and people, when given in the right amounts. Studies show that 
the survival of probiotic bacteria is always in question when they are in a hostile environment. So, 
probiotic bacteria are often put in tiny capsules to keep them alive during processing, storage, and 
delivery to specific parts of the digestive tract. In the field of probiotic microencapsulation, polysac￾charide is one of the walls that are used most often. On the other hand, traditional polysaccharides 
can’t handle these problems because the demand for probiotic microcapsules is growing and there 
are new ways to use them. By keeping a healthy gut microbiota, you can avoid problems like gas￾trointestinal infections, inflammatory bowel disorders, and even cancer (Dahiya & Nigam 2022). 
Lactobacilli like Lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacteria have been the most popular probiotics 
for a long time, according to research (Gule & Geremew 2022). Before it can help people’s health, 
a probiotic must meet a few conditions: (i) it must have good technological properties so that it can 
be made and added to food without losing its viability and functionality or making the food taste or 
feel bad; (ii) it must survive the upper gastrointestinal tract and reach its site of action alive; and (iii) 
it must be able to do its job in the environment of the gut (Pino et al. 2022). But Abed et al. (2016) 
found that probiotic bacteria are often very sensitive to the harsh environment they live in, such as 
acid, high temperatures, and high oxygen levels. Campos et al. (2021) say that microencapsulation 
technology is often used to improve survival in harsh environments and functionality in the human 
gastrointestinal tract. This is done to make up for these problems.Polysaccharides for Agricultural Applications 279
Campos et al. (2021) say that microencapsulation is a process that coats or encases bioactive 
compounds in a substance called wall material to make microcapsules in the millimeter to micron 
range. Microencapsulation is used to protect the active ingredient from the outside world until it is 
ready to be used. The wall material is one of the most important components in probiotic bacteria 
microencapsulation. Polysaccharides and proteins are two of the most common wall components 
used in probiotic microencapsulation. Polysaccharides and probiotics are related in a true sense. 
A polysaccharide is a big molecular polymer composed of several smaller monosaccharides, such 
as glucose (Stasińska-Jakubas & Hawrylak-Nowak 2022). There are two types of polysaccharides: 
homopolysaccharides and heteropolysaccharides (Stasińska-Jakubas & Hawrylak-Nowak 2022). 
Polysaccharides can take many different shapes, depending on the monosaccharides that are added 
to the chains. The following polysaccharide characteristics are relevant to the basis of probiotic 
microencapsulation: (i) an ion-induced gelation property, which allows the polysaccharide to create 
a cross-linked hydrogel structure by interacting with a variety of ions, such as Ca2+ with alginate 
and pectin and K+ with carrageenan (Jeong et al. 2012). Yao et al. (2020) say that traditional poly￾saccharides can’t keep up with the demand for probiotic microencapsulation because there are so 
many new uses for them, and the demand is going up. Scientists are actively searching for novel 
polysaccharide kinds that are ideal for microencapsulating probiotics as a result of this discovery. 
The good news is that research is already being done on the idea of putting probiotic bacteria 
inside of polysaccharides. According to Nguyen and Wang (2019), the plants Abelmoschus escul￾entus in okra and Linum usitatissimum in linseed create exopolysaccharides like mucilages, while 
Paenibacillus jamilae produces jamilan. Probiotics have been used to keep and improve the health 
of animals that have been stressed by diseases, droughts, or other things that can be seen as stresses.
15.1.9 Algae and the Enrichment of Carbohydrates
Macroalgae are an attractive source of bioactive polysaccharides with industrial and innova￾tive food applications (Cottrell et al. 2020). They include a variety of fascinating and frequently 
unique polysaccharides that are being researched for potential biomedical and dietary applications. 
However, a much more extensive application would be to employ seaweed sugars as an alternative 
fuel source. This application can be accelerated by utilizing photosynthesis, nature’s energy cycle, 
and the resulting plant biomass (Giglio et al. 2018). In order to gain the benefits of carbon-neutral 
biofuel, plastics, and healthcare, society must move from a hydrocarbon to a carbohydrate economy 
(Husmann et al. 2018). Marine biomass is an often-overlooked source of carbohydrates that might 
be a significant source of renewable energy, despite the fact that macroalgae are excellent solar 
energy converters and can rapidly create huge quantities of biomass. According to Kraan (2012), 
for example, macroalgae’s proximate composition is influenced by high ammonia and nitrate con￾centrations, resulting in a shift toward increased protein and typically lower levels of carbohydrates 
such as starch or dietary fiber. It may be amusing to vary the amount and kind of carbs in algae, 
although it is unknown how this affects the carbohydrate composition. The red carrageenophyte 
Kappaphycus alvarezii exhibited increased gel strength of the carrageenan with an increase in 
ammonia, revealing the considerable impact of ammonium supplementation on the carrageenan 
content in an otherwise nitrogen-depleted environment (Balasubramanian et al. 2021).
15.1.10 Opportunity for Circular Economy
The great opportunity exists for all market players to harness the polysaccharide business globally 
in today’s world. There is business for all to recycle the plastic that have caused a lot of air, water, 
and land pollution due waste material. Produced from the farms and forest, then to industry, these 
materials call for urgent need to work on non-fossil and the degradable substances. Marczak et al. 
(2020) have reported that the most common non-fossil plastics as of right now are those that are 
mechanically recycled, followed by those that are bio-based or biodegradable whose economic and 280 Polysaccharides
environmental importance cannot be over emphasized. In recent years, products such as bottles 
made of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polyethylene (PE) are being successfully recover￾ing these materials through mechanical procedures, which can be used to create recycled beverage 
containers (bottle-to-bottle recycling) (Pettersen et al. 2020).
However, due to safety worries about contamination, employing recycled plastics in food-grade 
products is extremely difficult. This problem can be overcome by advanced recycling, which turns 
recycled materials back into hydrocarbons and chemical precursors that can be used as feedstocks 
by other processes(Hallack et al. 2022). Advanced recycling provides a supplementary option to 
broaden the recycling landscape and includes innovations like pyrolysis, gasification, solvolysis, 
and microwave (Islam et al. 2021). As a result, it is anticipated to become more crucial in meeting 
circular economy goals and commitments and contributing to the expansion of the types, quanti￾ties, and qualities of plastic trash that can be recycled (Sheina & Babenko 2014). Even though rigid 
polyethylene (PE) and rigid PET resin have good mechanical recycling rates, some sophisticated 
recycling machines may take a variety of polymers, including mixed plastics with possibly higher 
contamination (Pettersen et al. 2020).
Many experts, including Peng et al. (2022), believe that advanced recycling will keep expanding 
and play a critical role in meeting the demand for recycled polymers if the current sustainability 
momentum continues at the same rate and if national restrictions are lifted. To meet 4%–8% of the 
total polymer demand by 2030, for instance, such a scenario would call for advanced recycling to 
require more than $40 billion in capital investments over the ensuing 10years. Even though this may 
only represent a negligible portion of the entire plastics industry, it would still represent a significant 
increase from its current share of less than 1% and would result in an annual increase in technologi￾cal potential of more than 20% until 2030 (Peng et al. 2022).
15.2 CONCLUSION
Polysaccharides are essential for both on- and off-farm use, and they have been identified as mate￾rials with the potential to transform biorefineries all over the world. Depending on how they are 
combined with other goods along the value chain, polysaccharides can significantly contribute to a 
country’s and the farmer’s economy being more environmentally friendly. Despite the differences 
in their methodologies, all the examined polysaccharides serve similar roles in the manufacturing 
of materials, functional foods, nutraceuticals, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals as drug and medica￾tion carriers. Additionally, they are properly utilized in the agricultural industry, particularly when 
it comes to the control and prevention of various diseases and pests that have a financial impact on 
the productivity and output of the farmers.
Chitosan accelerated green plant development in greenhouse settings, resulting in plants that 
were heavier, taller, and had more leaves. The rate at which the leaves transpired was slowed down 
by the application of chitosan. Chitosan may increase plant productivity, especially in areas suffer￾ing from drought. Through regional trade, international trade, and import and export, agro-indus￾trial waste is dispersed widely around the world. It is possible to find creative ways to optimize their 
use in other industries. Agro-industrial methods can be used to convert biomass into a wide range 
of chemical components.
The abundance of animal and plant biomass makes it possible to estimate the quantity of resi￾dues rich in polysaccharides, as this study has shown. Due to the sizeable amounts of waste that are 
imported and exported from important crops like rice, wheat, and maize, there are a wide variety of 
potential uses for cellulose extraction (Nugraha et al., 2023). The primary producers of leftovers are 
also the primary growers of these crops. For use in the livestock and seafood industries, respectively, 
chitin, chitosan, and hyaluronic acid are extracted from crustacean shells, fish eyeballs, and chicken 
crests. Pectin and inulin have both been extracted from chicory roots and citrus waste. Because 
they help to strengthen their immune systems, probiotic products are essential in stressful situations 
for both humans and animals. To expand this area of the economy, a variety of interventions are Polysaccharides for Agricultural Applications 281
required to encourage innovation among all market participants. It has been established, however, 
that this approach is incompatible with the idea of sustainability due to the abundance of other 
readily accessible, reasonably priced energy sources, such as solar and wind energy. Increasing the 
isolation of polysaccharides with properties capable of producing bioactive natural products and 
using agro-industrial waste as a source of valuable materials for industrial use are both necessary.

16.1 INTRODUCTION: POLYSACCHARIDES
Polysaccharides are biopolymers of monosaccharides, which are linked covalently by glycosidic 
bonds with a general formula of (C6H10O5)n, where n varies from 40 to 3,000 and has various 
degrees of branching (Zong et al., 2012). Nature synthesizes polysaccharides for various functions 
such as energy storage, structural support, and gelling agents forming the intercellular matrix 
(Mozammil Hasnain et al., 2019). They are usually found in various species of bacteria (cel￾lulose, dextran, levan, xanthan, gellan, and polygalactosamine), fungi (chitin, chitosan, elsinan, 
pollulan, and yeast glucans), algae (alginates, carrageenans, agar, galactans, and fucoidan), plants 
(cellulose, starch, hemicellulose, pectin, glucomannan, gums, and mucilage), and animals (cel￾lulose, chitin, chitosan, glycosaminoglycans, heparin, and hyaluronic acid).
These polysaccharides, obtained from differing sources, have differences in molecular weight 
with low, intermediate, and high molecular weights having differing polydispersity, position, and 
stereochemistry of the glycosidic bond as well as on the structure (linear or branched), functional 
group present (monofunctional, or polyfunctional), and properties such as water solubility, chirality, 
crystallinity, and so on. The inherent properties of the polysaccharides, such as biocompatibility, 
non-toxicity, low cost, ease of processing, and high sorption capacity, along with ease of avail￾ability, have made polysaccharides a hot topic of research in developing next-generation materials 288 Polysaccharides
for various biological and industrial applications (Shariatinia, 2019). The intermolecular and intra￾molecular hydrogen bond-forming moieties of the polysaccharides, and covalent modification of 
the different functional groups (hydroxyl, carboxyl, and aldehyde groups), are further utilized to 
develop nanomaterials and nanocomposites or nanohybrids, improving their thermal expansion 
coefficient, mechanical strength, flame-retardant capability, super-hydrophobicity, optical perfor￾mance, stimuli responsiveness, adsorption, solubility, and so on, making them ideal for various 
industrial applications such as food packaging, dye removal, electrode materials in flexible sen￾sors, batteries, organic thin-film transistors, supercapacitors, triboelectric nanogenerators, organic 
light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), tissue bioelectronics, and other flexible electronics (Li et al., 2014; 
Mobarak et al., 2015; Nešić et al., 2019; Pal et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2018; Zhao 
et al., 2021). The improved immunoregulatory, anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, anti-virus, anti-oxidant 
activities, and mechanical properties of these functionalized polysaccharides make them useful 
for medical applications such as tissue engineering, bone repair, wearable sensors, drug delivery, 
healthcare monitoring, and theranostics (Fu et al., 2019; Peng et al., 2016; Shariatinia, 2019; Zong 
et al., 2012). The details regarding different additives and methods for preparing various polysac￾charide-based nanocomposites and their applications have been described in Table 16.1 (Zheng 
et al., 2015).

have been utilized as photosensitizers and for applications such as bioimaging, UV shielding, and 
chemical sensing, and for anti-counterfeiting applications such security ink and so on (Jia et al., 
2019a; Nawaz et al., 2021; Tian et al., 2016). Such fluorescence-based polysaccharides act through 
a synergy of various non-covalent interactions such as electrostatic interactions, hydrogen bonding, 
π-stacking, and van der Waals interactions, in addition to the anchoring effect and dilution effect 
arising from the polysaccharide, providing an advantage of developing materials from fluorophores 
possessing aggregation-induced emission (AIE) and aggregation caused quenching (ACQ) alike, 
helping in the development of highly fluorescent materials (Tian et al., 2016). This chapter discusses 
exciting aspects of the fluorescent materials based on polysaccharides used for sensing and anti￾counterfeiting applications with the help of selected examples.

16.2 POLYSACCHARIDE-BASED FLUORESCENT MATERIALS FOR SENSING
Chemical and biological recognition of various analytes are of great interest as they are byproducts 
in the chemical industry, food industry, dyeing process, fine chemical engineering, and biological 
progress and are essential markers of environmental contamination and human diseases increased 
in the past years. Accumulating various metal ions in the body can lead to Parkinson’s, Minamata, 
Pinks, Alzheimer’s, and Wilson’s diseases, and affect the muscle, kidney, central nervous system, 
metabolism rate, growth, and immune-system development. Various analytical techniques include 
inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS), atomic absorption and emission spec￾trometry, X-ray fluorescence spectrophotometry, atomic absorption, and emission spectrometry, 
neutron activation analysis, etc., have been utilized to detect these analytes. However, the use of 
expensive instruments, hazardous sample preparation, and the requirement of highly trained opera￾tors hinder the real-time use of these sophisticated techniques (Basabe-Desmonts et al., 2007).
Hence, optical sensors that display signals in the form of changes in color or fluorescence upon 
interaction with analyte binding have been extensively utilized for the detection of analytes due to 
their sensitivity, selectivity, cost-effectiveness, operational simplicity, and rapid response of this 
technique compared to conventional spectroscopic and chromatographic analytical methods (Li 
et al., 2017). Over time, fluorescence-based sensors utilizing fluorescent nanomaterials, such as 
organic fluorophores, nanoclusters, carbon dots, quantum dots, and semiconducting polymer dots, 
have been extensively investigated due to their high sensitivity, selectivity, and ease of use. However, 
the applicability of these fluorescent materials is limited due to poor biocompatibility, toxicity, and 
water solubility. Therefore, the search for ecofriendly sensors with simple and smart detection is 
extremely important. Hence, the low toxicity, biocompatibility, and functionalizability of polysac￾charide-based fluorescent sensors make them good candidates for replacing traditional fluorescent 
sensors (Li et al., 2017; Nawaz et al., 2021).
16.2.1 Nitroaromatic Sensing
Nitroaromatics (NA) threaten the human population and environment regarding pollution and secu￾rity as many explosives belong to this category. In this scenario, selective detection and monitor￾ing of NAs are of significant interest. Fluorescent dye-grafted polysaccharide derivatives can be 
utilized as a fluorescent sensing platform for the selective detection of NAs. The surface functional￾ities such as hydroxy, carboxy, etc., facilitate the covalent modification of cellulose with fluorescent 
dyes and lead to the development of diverse polysaccharide-based fluorescent materials. Generally, 
on exposure to NAs, the fluorescence emission of the polysaccharide-based fluorescent materials 
undergoes quenching due to the high affinity of electron-deficient NAs to electron-rich fluorescent 
sensor moieties and consequent photoinduced electron/energy transfer from the latter to the former. 
Zhou, Nishio, and coworkers have developed a fluorescent cellulose derivative (AC-AET-DMANM) 
comprising of aminoethanethiol modified allyl cellulose backbone and 4-dimethylamine-1,8-naph￾thalimide fluorescent signaling moiety, which exhibited selective detection of 2,4-dinitrophenylhy￾drazine (DNH) and trinitrophenol (TNP) over other NAs in both aqueous and non-aqueous solvent 
medium (Figure 16.1a and b). Due to photoinduced electron transfer (PET) and fluorescence reso￾nance energy transfer (FRET) from signaling fluorescent dye to NA analyte, DNH and TNP selec￾tively quenched the fluorescence of AC-AET-DMANM with good selectivity (Hu et al., 2018).
Zhang, Chen, and coworkers demonstrated that the hydroxyl groups of hydrophilic polymer 
chains shorten the equilibrium response time by facilitating the fast diffusion of NA molecules 
onto a solid film matrix. They synthesized pyrene functionalized hydrophilic fluorescent polymer 
(poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate-co-pyrene-butyric acid poly(HEMA-co-PyMA)) with different 
weight% (0.67 & 13.5wt%) of pyrene, which was found to be sensitive to trinitrotoluene (TNT). 
Poly(HEMA-co-PyMA)) forms a stable charge transfer complex with electron-deficient TNT, and 
hence, causing a quenching in the emission intensity of the pyrene polymer (Figure 16.1c and d). The 
higher wt% of pyrene (13.5mol%; poly 2) can extend the fluorescence emission quenching response 292 Polysaccharides
in the visible region by forming excimers through intramolecular and intermolecular aggregations. 
Cellulose paper absorbed with poly 2 can act as a fluorescence sensing platform for the selective 
ultra-fast onsite naked-eye detection of TNT (Lu et al., 2017). Since TNT is more electron deficient 
than dinitrotoluene (DNT) and nitrobenzene (NB), the charge transfer complex formed between 
TNT and pyrene is more stable than that with DNT and DB, making poly 2 TNT selective.
16.2.2 Gas Sensing
Fluorescent dye-infused cellulose paper can be utilized as a fluorescent gas sensing platform. 
Meldrum and coworkers developed bis(4-pyridyl)-dineopentoxyl-p-phenylenedivinylene (P4VB) 
infused cellulose paper strips as fluorescent CO2 gas sensors (Wang et al., 2020). Here water vapor is 
necessary for detecting CO2 in terms of red spectral shift. The carbonic acid formed from CO2 and 
water will protonate the pyridyl moiety of P4VB, and weakly bound P4VB-carbonic acid perturbed 
the HOMO-LUMO energy gap of P4VB and caused a spectral shift.
Baker and coworkers demonstrated that bacterial cellulose ionogel could serve as a platform for sens￾ing ammonia on doping with pH-responsive trihexyltetradecylphosphonium8-hydroxypyrene-1,3,6-
trisulfonate ([P14,6,6,6]3[HPTS]in the presence of trihexyltetradecylphosphonium bis-[(trifluoromethyl)
sulfonyl]imide [P14,6,6,6][Tf2N] ionic liquid (Figure 16.2) (Smith et al., 2017). Due to the photo-acidic 
FIGURE 16.1 (a) Schematic representation for the synthesis and NA sensing properties of AC-AET￾DMANM. (b) Plot showing relative fluorescence intensity of AC-AET-DMANM toward various NAs, includ￾ing TNP and DNH. a and b are reproduced with permission from Hu et al. (2018) © 2017 American Chemical

nature, on exposure to ammonia, HPTS-doped bacterial cellulose ionogel showed a clear fluorescence 
profile difference before and after ammonia exposure. Ammonia exposure induces a two-state fluo￾rescence (peaks at 511 and 445nm) response of HPTS, and I511/I445 seems to increase with ammonia 
concentration, which can be easily identified even using the naked eye upon excitation using a UV 
lamp. By exploiting the chemistry of reduction of azide functionality to amine functionality, bacterial 
cellulose ionogel was utilized as a fluorescence sensor for gaseous detection of H2S by incorporating 
pro-fluorescent 8-azidopyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid molecule into the entrapped fluid phase of a bac￾terial cellulose ionogel. On contact with H2S, the fluorescence intensity was increased, which can be 
attributed to the formation of fluorescent aminopyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid upon reduction of azide 
functionality 8-azidopyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid with H2S.
16.2.3 Metal Ion Sensing
Covalent grafting or simple incorporation of metal ion-sensitive fluorescent probes into cellulose 
matrix have been utilized to develop a fluorescent sensing platform for detecting metal ions. Ertekin 
and coworkers have developed ethyl cellulose nanofibrous thin films comprising Cu2+ responsive 
fluoroionophore 2-{[(2-aminophenyl)imino]methyl}-4,6-di-tert-butylphenol (DMK) for selec￾tive detection of Cu2+ (Figure 16.3c) (Kacmaz et al., 2015). On the interaction of DMK, which is 
encapsulated within an ethyl cellulose matrix with Cu2+ in the presence of anionic additive potas￾sium tetrakis-(4-chlorophenyl)borate, fluorescence quenching was observed in DMK with pico￾molar sensitivity. It can be attributed to the ion-exchange mechanism where Cu2+ is selectively 
extracted from solution to fiber by displacing K+ into solution. Zhang and coworkers developed

of fluorescence emission response of [P14,6,6,6]3[HPTS]-containing bacterial cellulose ionogel toward NH3 taken

a cellulose-based sensing platform (Phen-MDI-CA) for the rapid and selective detection of Fe2+
by covalent grafting of Fe2+ responsive fluorescent probe 1,10-phenanthroline-5-amine onto cel￾lulose framework by employing 4,4′-methylene diphenyl diisocyanate crosslinker (Figure 16.3a and 
b) (Nawaz et al., 2018). Phenanthroline can easily form complex with Fe2+ ions, and when Phen￾MDI-CA interacts with Fe2+ ions, quenching of blue fluorescence was observed with a sensitivity of 
50 ppb. Interestingly, the red color of the non-fluorescent Fe-(Phen-MDI-CA) complex facilitates 
easy naked-eye detection of Fe2+ due to its insoluble nature with red color. Wang and coworkers 
utilized cellulose nanofiber (CNF) hydrogels functionalized with fluorescent carbon dots (CDs) 
for detecting Fe3+ ions selectively (Wang et al., 2018). The functionalization of CDs improved the 
mechanical properties of hydrogels, and upon interaction with Fe3+ ions, quenching of blue fluo￾rescence emission intensity was observed. The fluorescence response arises from efficient mass 
transfer through a porous 3D hydrogel network structure.
Generally, organic fluorescent dye molecules suffer from ACQ, reducing fluorescent emission 
intensity. Chen, Xiao, and coworkers demonstrated anti-ACQ of coumarin by preventing π-π stack￾ing with nanocellulose spacer using hydrogen bonding interaction (Li et al., 2019). Sulfurated moi￾ety in hydroxy coumarin-induced photo-induced electron transfer and weak fluorescence. When 
weakly emitting cellulose membrane comprising of sulfurated hydroxy coumarin (CAM) interacts 
with Hg2+, fluorescence intensity was dramatically increased, facilitating the turn-on mode detec￾tion of Hg2+. Upon exposure to Hg2+, the chemical reaction between Hg2+ and CAM resulted in 
the desulfuration of sulfurated coumarin into coumarin. This diminishes the photo-induced elec￾tron transfer and enhances the intramolecular charge transfer efficiency, increasing the intensity of 
emission.

Fu and coworkers have developed a disposable cellulose-based turn-on fluorescence sensor by 
incorporating amino-containing spirolactam rhodamine derivative (Xu et al., 2013). The fluores￾cent dye was integrated onto cellulose via atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP), surface￾initiated ATRP, and finally with ester-amine reaction. The spirolactam rhodamine-grafted cellulose 
(Cellulose-g-RD), when in contact with Hg2+ metal ion solution, exhibits an increase in fluorescence 
intensity along with a distinct color change from colorless to pink, which facilitates the solid-state 
sensing of Hg2+ with a detection limit of 5×10–5M (Figure 16.3d). The spectral change can be 
attributed to the formation of highly emissive rhodamine dye from the non-luminescent rhodamine 
spirocycle upon interaction with Hg2+ metal ions.
16.2.4 Biosensing
In addition to chemosensing, fluorogenic dye-attached cellulose substrates can also be employed in 
biosensing applications. But the bottleneck in developing biosensors based on cellulose is the poor 
reactivity of cellulose fiber surface. Brumer and coworkers have overcome this issue by employing 
a chemoenzymatic approach and developed 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein-tetraethylene glycol (TEG)-
azide appended cellulose paper-based fluorogenic biosensor for the detection of esterase (Figure 
16.4a and b) (Derikvand et al., 2016). The non-fluorescent diester of fluorescein was attached to 
the cellulose paper surface by Cu-catalyzed azide-alkyne click chemistry. The presence of esterase 
causes the hydrolysis of fluorescein diester, thereby liberating highly fluorescent fluorescein dye, 
which is attached to cellulose paper. The advantage of the developed sensor lies in the fact that 
the dye is covalently attached to cellulose and prevents loss of signal and increase in toxicity aris￾ing due to chromophore diffusion. Ma and coworkers developed carboxymethyl chitosan (CMC) 
appended CdTe quantum dots (CMCS-QDs) as turn-off fluorescent sensors for lysosome detection 
(Song et al., 2014). The lysosome-sensitive probe was developed by modifying CdTe quantum dots 
with CMC by utilizing the interaction between the amino group and the carboxyl group of CdTe 
quantum dots. By exploiting the affinity of Zn2+ toward chitosan, the fluorescence intensity of quan￾tum dots was enhanced by adding Zn2+ to CMCS-QDs. When Zn2+-CMCS-QDs interact with the 
lysosome, the lysosome brings about the hydrolysis of CMC chains and forms the lysosome-QDS 
complex by releasing Zn2+ from QDs. Since Zn2+ facilitates the reduction of non-radiative transi￾tion, the formation of the lysosome-QDS complex by releasing Zn2+ quenches the emission inten￾sity. Rhee and coworkers developed a ratiometric fast responsive fluorescent urea biosensor based 
on the urease oxazine 170 perchlorate-ethyl cellulose membrane immobilized with urease (Dinh 
Duong & Il Rhee, 2015). The urea sensing membrane comprised two layers where ethyl cellulose 
(EC) was employed as supporting material for the top urease membrane layer and bottom oxazine 
170 perchlorate layer. The response time of the probe depends on the protein capture ability of 
the enzyme layer, and in addition to the role of supporting material, EC also facilitates the quick 
response of the urease enzyme. The ratiometric probe works because when urea solution comes in 
contact with the probe membrane, the urease enzyme catalyzes urea hydrolysis into NH3 and CO2. 
Since Oxazine 170 perchlorate is an NH3-sensitive fluorescent molecule, the OC17-EC membrane 
in the probe interacts with NH3 released from urea hydrolysis and delivers a quick response in a 
ratiometric manner.
Lateral flow assays have been used widely to diagnose various diseases rapidly because of the 
biodegradable, affordable, and easy-to-use nature of these assays (Mansfield, 2009). A recent exam￾ple of a lateral flow assay is the rapid antigen test strip for SARS CoV-2. Porous nitrocellulose 
membranes and paper strips have been widely used as analytical strips for lateral flow assays (Hu 
et al., 2014; Yetisen et al., 2013). Prazeres and coworkers have utilized nitrocellulose membrane 
to develop a sandwich-type assay to detect Cardiac Troponin I (cTnI) (Natarajan et al., 2021). The 
assay required an incubation time of 15 minutes. Though cellulose-based lateral flow assay exhib￾ited less fluorescence, modification of the cellulose with cellulose nanofibers resulted in an ampli￾fied fluorescence. A schematic representation of the analytical test strip is shown in Figure 16.4c. 296 Polysaccharides
Chang and coworkers have developed a lateral flow assay using nitrocellulose membrane embedded 
with CdO QDs to detect α-fetoprotein, which acts as a tumor marker for primary hepatic carcinoma 
(Yang et al., 2011). This biosensor detected α-fetoprotein as low as 1ng mL–1 with a false positive 
rate of 3.92% and a false negative rate of 4.38%.
Li and coworkers developed a DNA circuit to detect nucleic acids—a diagnostic tool for infec￾tious and genetic diseases. The paper-strip-based immunogenic assay can detect specific single￾stranded markers for pathogens and has a detection limit of ~300nM (Allen et al., 2012). The type of 
analytes detected can be increased by combining the technique with amplification techniques such 
as loop-mediated isothermal amplification and enzyme-free catalytic hairpin assembly-amplified 
circuit. Krull and coworkers have developed a solid-phase assay based on paper for the transduc￾tion of nucleic acid hybridization (Noor & Krull, 2013). The surface of the cellulose paper was 
functionalized with QD−probe oligonucleotide conjugates bound to imidazole (Figure 16.4d). Cy3 
acceptors were FRET-paired with the QDs, which gave rise to FRET-sensitized emission, measured 
as the output signal.
16.2.5 pH Sensing and Food Freshness Monitoring
Fluorescent sensors have attracted considerable attention toward sensing and monitoring pH. 
Zhang and coworkers have developed a cellulose-based bimodal pH-responsive probe (Phen￾MDI-CA) that can exhibit colorimetric and fluorescence responses toward pH change (Nawaz 
et al., 2019). Phen-MDI-CA consists of pH-responsive phenanthroline chromophore moiety 
anchored on a cellulose chain with a urea linkage. Under acidic solid and basic buffer condi￾tions, Phen-MDI-CA displays a drastic change in luminescence. As the pH changes from 11 to 
14, colorless to yellow-orange color change and blue-green to yellow-red emission change were 
observed (Figure 16.5a). The shift in emission and a decrease in intensity under basic conditions 
FIGURE 16.4 (a) Surface tethering of cellulose with deacetylated fluorescein, (b) a photograph depicting 
fluorescence emission change upon interaction with urea, mechanism of pH sensing. Reproduced with per￾mission from Derikvand et al. (2016) © 2016 American Chemical Society. (c) Schematic representation of a 
lateral flow assay. Reproduced with permission from Natarajan et al. (2021). (d) Schematic representation of 
the FRET-based nucleic acid hybridization detecting paper strip. Reproduced with permission from Noor and 
Krull (2013) © 2012 American Chemical Society.Polysaccharide-Based Fluorescent Materials for Sensing and Security Applications 297
is due to the shift in intramolecular charge transfer characteristics with conjugation change upon 
deprotonation of the amino group of urea linkage. At the same time, under acidic conditions, the 
protonation of the amino group and carbonyl moiety disrupts the intramolecular charge transfer 
characteristics, resulting in a spectral shift. As a result, a color change from colorless to yel￾low in the visible region and blue to colorless under UV light was observed as the pH changed 
from 2.0 to 1.0. Interestingly, the luminescence shift can be modulated and amplified with the 
help of pH-irresponsive luminophores. Huang and coworkers developed a pH-responsive cellu￾lose nanocrystal-based fluorescent sensor by covalent modification of cellulose nanocrystals with 
pH-responsive (5 (and 6)-carboxy-2’,7’-dichlorofluorescein dye using L-leucine amino acid linker 
(Tang et al., 2016). A turn-on response was obtained on contact with a buffer solution of different 
pH. On varying the pH from 2.2 to 13, a linear increment was observed in the emission intensity 
of the probe and pH up to a pH value of 10.8, and the turn-on response can be attributed to the 
formation of anions of (5 (and 6)-carboxy-2’,7’-dichlorofluorescein dye.
In foodstuffs such as milk, fish and fish products, processed meat, fermented foodstuffs, 
beverages, and so on, biogenic amines are formed by the degradation of amino acids caused 
by microbial activity in the food products. Hence biogenic amines can be used as markers for 
assessing the quality and freshness of foodstuffs during storage and transportation. Zhang and 
coworkers developed ratiometric cellulose-based amine-responsive fluorescence material for 
naked-eye detection and real-time monitoring of the freshness of seafood (Figure 16.5b) (Jia 
et al., 2019b). The design concept was simple and very interesting. Cellulose acetate was cova￾lently linked with a biogenic amine indicator, fluorescein isothiocyanate, and an internal refer￾ence, protoporphyrin IX. Fluorescein isothiocyanate is green emissive while protoporphyrin IX 
is red-emitting, and the cellulose acetate anchoring unit prevents ACQ of both the fluorophores, 
thereby resulting in highly emissive cellulose acetate linked fluorophores. The ratiometric fluo￾rescent probe was prepared by blending various ratios of cellulose acetate-fluorescein isothio￾cyanate and cellulose acetate-protoporphyrin IX. A red emissive fluorescent tag prepared by 
mixing cellulose acetate-protoporphyrin IX and cellulose acetate-fluorescein isothiocyanate 
in a 5:1 ratio was employed to monitor the freshness of shrimp and crab at room temperature; 
as time progressed, the red emission of the tag changed to green. The emission change can be 
attributed to the spoilage of shrimp and crab, as the spoilage releases biogenic amines, which 
increase the fluorescence intensity of cellulose acetate-fluorescein isothiocyanate. Since the 
concentration of protoporphyrin IX remains constant, a distinct emission change from red to 
green was observed.

16.3 POLYSACCHARIDE-BASED FLUORESCENT MATERIALS 
FOR ANTI-COUNTERFEITING
Counterfeiting has been a severe problem faced by governments and businesses around the globe 
over the last few decades in terms of scope and magnitude. Counterfeited products, especially cur￾rency, documents, food, and drugs, can cause considerable losses to the economy, company reputa￾tion, and consumer health. Although several laws have been implemented to prevent counterfeiting, 
many counterfeited products in terms of currency, food, medicine, apparel, and electronic fields 
are readily available in markets, especially in developing and underdeveloped countries (Abdollahi 
et al., 2020).
Numerous anti-counterfeiting strategies such as barcodes, holograms, watermarks, and two￾dimensional codes are used to identify and prevent counterfeiting. However, complex identifica￾tion procedures, high cost of analysis, and easy replication limit the utility of anti-counterfeiting 
materials in real applications (Arppe & Sørensen, 2017). Hence, anti-counterfeiting materials based 
on various fluorescent materials, such as organic dyes, CDs, and quantum dots, have been devel￾oped (Yu et al., 2021). The polysaccharide-based fluorescent smart materials have gained significant 
importance in security printing applications because of their cost-effectiveness, biodegradability, 
easy processability, and fast response time. In this section, we will discuss various polysaccharide￾based anti-counterfeiting materials. We shall also discuss polysaccharide-based anti-counterfeiting 
materials exhibiting dynamic fluorescence under external stimuli such as light, heat, force, electric￾ity, and chemicals to develop fascinating and chameleon-like visual effects resulting in hard-to￾duplicate authentication strategies.
Zhang and coworkers developed a simple technique that utilized a cellulose-based bioplastic 
material for anti-counterfeiting (Wang et al., 2016). They successfully incorporated fluorescent dye 
molecules such as rhodamine and fluorescein into the cellulose material by using hydrogen bonding 
between the polar groups of dye molecules and the hydroxyl groups of cellulose material. The fluo￾rescent bioplastic material thus synthesized via the hot-pressing process exhibited excellent mechan￾ical properties with good thermal stability. Accordingly, the composite material could be easily 
incorporated into papers, making their anti-counterfeiting applicability more facile. Later, the group 
of Bian reported a similar fluorophore (thiazolopyridinecarboxylic acid) integrated cellulose system 
with enhanced fluorescence (Chen et al., 2017). They developed a one-pot synthetic methodology of 
mixing cellulose powder with citric acid and cystine and heating above 80°C, resulting in modified 
cellulose with fluorescence. The emitting material was thiazolopyridinecarboxylic acid, formed by a 
series of dehydration reactions between cysteine and citric acid. They printed the concentrated solu￾tion of citric acid and cysteine for the counterfeiting application. This paper on temperature treatment 
showed the written texts under 365nm UV light illumination and invisible under daylight.
Another class of fluorescent materials with superior photoluminescent behavior is rare-earth 
ion-based nanomaterials. There are a few reports where cellulose materials are used as a base mate￾rial to incorporate lanthanide ions and improve their emission properties. In this aspect, Wang, 
Hou, and coworkers have synthesized a new category of hydrogel materials based on cellulose 
(carboxy methyl cellulose (CMC)) that finds application in latent-fingerprint detection, decryp￾tion, and encryption. Integration of the terbium (III)-complex-functionalized CMC ((Tb (III)–car￾boxymethylcellulose) with a DPY 2,6-(dimethyl pyridine-4-amine)-functionalized CMC-binding 
aptamer leads to the formation of hydrogels with green fluorescence and excellent light stability. 
(Hai et al., 2018). This fluorescence could be quenched by adding ClO− and reverts with SCN−. The 
system retained its behavior in the solution state and the solid-state while incorporated into a filter 
paper. Highly magnified images of the latent fingerprints with minute details are extracted when the 
fingerprints are treated with the aforementioned solution (Figure 16.6).
Yu and coworkers have utilized the exceptional photoluminescent behavior of lanthanide nano￾crystals by anchoring them to cellulose-based composites (Wang et al., 2018). For this purpose, 
polyvinylpyrrolidone was incorporated into cellulose fibers, and the resulting composite material Polysaccharide-Based Fluorescent Materials for Sensing and Security Applications 299
was utilized to accommodate the lanthanum ions with enhanced stability. The highly polar −C-N￾and C=O bonds in the polyvinylpyrrolidone made the lanthanum ion adhere firmly to the site. 
The bleached hardwood pulp cellulose fibers (bhp fibers)-polyvinylpyrrolidone@LaF3:Eu3+ com￾plex showed stable fluorescence and stability toward acid and alkali. This composite could quickly 
adsorb into paper and showed better flexibility, printable, and rewritable property (Figure 16.7).
Later, the same group reported the chemical modification of cellulose by 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl￾1-piperidinyloxy (TEMPO), which allowed the enhanced adsorption of the LaF3:RE3+ via elec￾trostatic interaction (Wang et al., 2020). Incorporation of TEMPO-oxidized cellulose (TOC), 
LaF3:RE3+ composite into TiO2 (TOC@LaF3:Eu3+@TiO2) resulted in a self-standing paper, which 
upon further modification with HDTMS (hexadecyltrimethoxysilane) gives the additional advantage 
of superhydrophobicity and self-cleaning ability. The coordination ability of the TEMPO-oxidized 
cellulose nanofibrils (tCNFs) was used by Zhang and coworkers through an adequately designed 
self-assembly event (Zhang et al., 2019). Herein, they co-assembled tCNFs with lanthanide com￾plexes of tris(2-benzimidazolylmethyl)amine (NTB) ((Tb(NTB)Cl3 and/or Eu(NTB)Cl3). Blending 
and vacuum filtration of the nanocomposite gave papers with excellent fluorescent properties and 
unique translucence. This makes them a good candidate for the anti-counterfeiting application.
CDs are a unique set of fluorescent materials with a broad spectrum of applications owing to 
their low toxicity, resistance to photobleaching, biocompatibility, ease of preparation, and so on. 
However, the ACQ property of these materials in solid state often restricts their application in 
the material world. In this aspect, we will discuss a few examples where chemical modification

of cellulose with CDs provides a protective layer over each CD and thereby overcome the ACQ 
effect. Recently, Zhang and coworkers have reported the modification of cellulose by esterification 
of the acid group with (3-carboxypropyl)trimethylammonium chloride, which leaves the quater￾nized amine, which can electrostatically interact with the negatively charged CDs (Jin et al., 2020). 
CDs@cellulose showed enhanced fluorescence and quantum yield compared with the free nega￾tively charged CDs. On a comparable basis, they have extended the work with positively charged 
carbon dots (FCDs (prepared from 4-fluoro-o-phenylenediamine), pPDs (prepared from p-phen￾ylenediamine)) and negatively charged carboxymethyl cellulose, leading to different fluorescence 
emissions (Figure 16.8). They also demonstrated the processability of CDs@cellulose systems, 
which can be readily converted into ink, film, or coated into other substrates.
Later, Jin and coworkers reported a similar system where they synthesized a positively charged 
cellulose derivative by attaching the imidazole salt group (Im+) and spiropyran (SP) (C-Im+-SP) 
(Jin et al., 2021). Negatively charged carbon dots (NCDS) were introduced into the above system 
via electrostatic interaction, with bright fluorescence in the solid-state, otherwise unattainable for 
NCDs due to ACQ behavior. The proximity of NCDs and SP in the system made an excellent 
FRET pair, bringing the system additional dynamic behavior. A few CDs get excited on UV light 
irradiation and emit blue light. However, a few CDs transfer their excited state energy to the nearby 
SP, which leads to red emission. The ring-opening process of SP to merocyanine occurs in a finite 
time compared to the relatively faster FRET process, which provides the system with fluorescence 
depending on the irradiation time. This process could be reversed by visible light irradiation, caus￾ing the merocyanine ring-closing phenomenon (Figure 16.9). In addition, UV irradiation causes 
fluorescence to shift from blue to red, and their intensity ratio could be modulated by varying the 
composition of NCDs in the system. All these peculiarities make them an excellent candidate for 
anti-counterfeiting pattering. These composite NCDS@C-Im+-SP can be readily coated into the 
substrate or act as inks in photo-rewritable papers and anti-counterfeit patterns.
Guttena and coworkers have reported a facile conversion of cigarette butts into CDs with 
appreciably high quantum yield (Bandi et al., 2018). Extraction of cellulose acetate from cigarette 
butts followed by one-step hydrothermal methods is observed to synthesize nitrogen and sulfur 
co-doped CDs. The appreciably high quantum yield (26%) obtained for these CDs made them a

good candidate for security ink-related applications. The inherent behavior of cellulose to undergo 
photo-oxidation and photodegradation upon UV light irradiation leads to fluorescence. Su, Zheng, 
and coworkers cleverly explored this property for cellulose-based photolithography for anti-coun￾terfeiting applications (Cheng et al., 2021). Cellulose nanofibers extracted from the garlic husk were 
made into papers with a thickness of 20mm and excellent mechanical stability. UV irradiation 
with a pre-defined photomask made the required impression on the paper. Hence, this relatively

simple technique developed a renewable cellulose nanofiber that can act as both inks and substrates. 
Moreover, the information encrypted via UV irradiation was stable under acidic or alkaline condi￾tions, which increased their applicability in security materials.
Dynamic fluorescent materials are considered next-generation materials for anti-counterfeiting 
applications compared to static fluorescent materials as they are hard to duplicate. Zhang and cowork￾ers extended the possibility of FRET for developing dynamically controlled fluorescent materials 
(Tian et al., 2018). They have used three chromophores, spiropyran, fluorescein, and pyrene, coupled 
to cellulose. A simple blending of these three materials resulted in FRET between the chromophore, 
and the resulting blend showed excellent processability. In addition, they achieved almost full-color 
fluorescence by controlling the ratio of chromophores. They also prepared a fluorescent QR code that 
could show the gradual fluorescence change accompanied by visible light changes (Figure 16.10).

16.4 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE PERSPECTIVES
This chapter summarizes various polysaccharide-based fluorescent materials for sensing and secu￾rity applications in this chapter. Such bio-based materials are advantageous over instrumental and 
conventional sensing techniques due to their low toxicity, economical, easy processability, biocom￾patibility, and fast response time. Enhanced interest in developing such polysaccharide-based fluo￾rescent materials can result in better and greener synthetic strategies for developing such materials. 
The demonstrated properties of these materials can be improved to obtain materials with better 
selectivity, sensitivity, photostability, efficiency, reproducibility, and zero toxicity with minimal cost 
of production. The development of color-tunable stimuli-responsive multi-emissive (fluorescence/
phosphorescence) polysaccharide-based anti-counterfeiting solutions as the next-generation anti￾counterfeiting materials will be a shot in the arm for the fight against counterfeiting, as duplicating 
such materials will be near impossible.
