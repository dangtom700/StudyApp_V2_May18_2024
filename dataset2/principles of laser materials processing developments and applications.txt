PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION
Application of lasers in materials processing has been evolving since the development (first
demonstration) of the laser in 1960. The early applications focused on processes such as welding,
machining, and heat treatment. Newer processes that have evolved over the years include laser
forming, shock peening, micromachining, rapid prototyping, and nano processing. The book
provides a state-of-the-art compilation of material in the major application areas and is designed to
provide the background needed by graduate students to prepare them for industry; researchers to
initiate a research program in any of these areas; and practicing engineers to update themselves and
gain additional insight into the latest developments in this rapidly evolving field.
The book is partitioned into three parts. The first part, Principles of Industrial Lasers
(Chapters 1 to 9), introduces the reader to basic concepts on the characteristics of lasers, design of
their components, and beam delivery. It is presented in a simple enough format that an engineering
student without any prior knowledge of lasers can fully comprehend. It helps the reader acquire a
basic understanding of how a laser beam is generated, its basic properties, propagation of the beam,
and the various types of lasers available and their specific characteristics. Such knowledge is useful
to all engineering students, irrespective of their specific interests or area of application. It will
enable them to select an appropriate laser for a given application and help them to determine how
best to utilize the laser. The coverage starts with a discussion on laser generation – basic atomic
structure and how it leads to atomic transitions (absorption, spontaneous emission, and stimulated
emission). The concepts of population inversion and gain criterion for laser action are introduced.
Optical resonators (planar and spherical) are discussed in relation to beam modes (longitudinal and
transverse) and stability of optical resonators. Techniques for line and mode selection are outlined.
Various pumping techniques that can be used to achieve inversion are then presented, including
more recent developments such as diode pumping. The rate equations are then introduced to provide
some insight into the conditions necessary for achieving population inversion for both 3- and
4-level systems. This is followed by a discussion on broadening mechanisms that are responsible
for the spread of a laser frequency over a finite range. These include both homogeneous (natural and
collision broadening) and inhomogeneous (Doppler) broadening. Beam modification mechanisms
such as Q-switching and mode-locking are presented. Having obtained a fundamental background
on laser generation, the characteristics of beams that have a more direct impact on their application
are then discussed. These include beam characteristics such as divergence, monochromaticity (with
reference to broadening), coherence, polarization, intensity and brightness, frequency stabilization,
and focusing. Different types of lasers are then discussed with specific emphasis on high-power
lasers used in industrial manufacturing. These include solid-state lasers (Nd:YAG and Nd:Glass);
gas lasers (neutral atom, ion, metal vapor (copper-vapor) and molecular lasers (CO2 and excimer);
dye lasers; and semiconductor (diode) lasers. Finally, beam delivery systems are introduced,
discussing concepts such as the Brewster angle, polarization, beam expanders, beam splitters, and
transmissive, reflective, and fiber optics.
The second part, Engineering Background (Chapters 10 to 13), reviews the engineering concepts
that are needed to analyze the different processes. Topics that are discussed include thermal analysis

and fluid flow, the microstructure that results from the heat effect, solidification of the molten metal
for processes that involve melting, and residual stresses that evolve during the process.
The third part, Laser Materials Processing (Chapters 14 to 23), provides a more rigorous and
detailed coverage on the subject of laser materials processing and discusses the principal application
areas such as laser cutting and drilling, welding, surface modification, laser forming, rapid pro￾totyping, sensor systems, process monitoring, and medical and nanoapplications. Sensors that are
normally used for monitoring process quality are also discussed, along with methods for analyzing
the sensor outputs. Finally, basic concepts on laser safety are presented. The range of processing
parameters associated with each process are outlined. The impact of the basic laser characteris￾tics such as wavelength, divergence, monochromaticity, coherence, polarization, intensity, stability,
focusing, and depth of focus, as discussed in Part I, on each process, is emphasized.
The material in this book is suitable for a two-course sequence on laser processing. The material
in Part I is adequate for an upper division/first-year graduate course in engineering. Parts II and III
can then be used for a follow-up course, or the material in Part I can be skipped if only one course
needs to be offered. In either case, Part II can be quickly reviewed and more time spent on Part III.
Two sets of nomenclature are used in this text. There is an overall nomenclature that is reserved
for variables that are used throughout the text. In addition, each chapter has its own nomenclature
that is used for variables that are used primarily in that chapter.
The author wishes to express his gratitude to all his colleagues and friends who have provided
feedback on the manuscript. Special gratitude goes to all the graduate students who critiqued the
course pack on which the book is based and to Mr. Rodney Hill (rodhillgraphics.com) for the skillful
illustrations.

1 Laser Background
1.1 LASER GENERATION
The term laser is an acronym for light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation, and thus a
laser beam is a form of electromagnetic radiation. Light may be simply defined as electromagnetic
radiation that is visible to the human eye. It has a wavelength range of about 0.37–0.75 μm, between
ultraviolet and infrared radiation. Lasers, on the other hand, may have wavelengths ranging from
0.2 to 500 μm, that is, from X-ray to infrared radiation. In its simplest form, laser generation is the
result of energy emission associated with the transition of an electron from a higher to a lower energy
level or orbit within an atom.
Figure 1.1 illustrates the electromagnetic spectrum. The colors associated with the various wave￾lengths in the visible range are shown in Table 1.1.
1.1.1 Atomic Transitions
Under the right conditions, electrons within an atom can change their orbits. Light or energy (photon)
is emitted as an electron moves from a higher level or outer orbit to a lower level or inner orbit and
is absorbed when the reverse transition takes place. There is a specific quantum of energy (photon),
ΔE, of specific wavelength or frequency associated with each transition from one energy level to
another and is given by:
ΔE = hpc
𝜆 = hp𝜈 (1.1)
where c is the velocity of light = 3 × 108 (exactly 299,792,458) m/s, hp is Planck’s constant = 6.625 ×
10−34 J s, 𝜆 is the wavelength (m), 𝜈 is the frequency of transition between the energy levels (Hz),
and ΔE is the energy difference between the levels of interest.
1.1.1.1 Population Distribution For simplicity, let us focus our initial discussion on a single
frequency, which corresponds to two specific energy levels, E1 and E2, where E1 is the lower energy
level and E2 is a higher energy level, that is, E2 >E1. Furthermore, we let the population or number
of atoms (or molecules or ions) per unit volume at level 1 be N1, and that at level 2 be N2. We also
assume conditions of non-degeneracy. Degeneracy exists when there is more than one level with the
same energy.

Under conditions of thermal equilibrium, the lower energy levels are more highly populated than
the higher levels, and the distribution is given by Boltzmann’s law that relates N1 and N2 as:
N2
N1
= e
−E2−E1
kBT = e
− hp𝜈
kBT (1.2)
where kB is Boltzmann’s constant = 1.38 × 10−23 J/K and T is the absolute temperature (K).
This is illustrated in Figure 1.2a. Figure 1.2b illustrates the equilibrium distribution for the more
general case. Boltzmann’s law holds for thermal equilibrium conditions.
1.1.1.2 Absorption When atoms in a ground state, E1, are excited or stimulated, that is, subjected
to some external radiation or photon whose energy is the same as the energy difference between E1
and a higher state, E2, the atoms will change their energy level, as shown in Figure 1.3a. This process
is called stimulated absorption. The rate at which energy is absorbed by the atoms is given by:

where B12 is a proportionality constant referred to as the Einstein coefficient for stimulated
absorption, or stimulated absorption probability per unit time per unit spectral energy density
(m3 Hz/J s), N1 is the population of level 1 (per m3), e(𝜈) is the energy density (energy per unit
volume) at the frequency 𝜈(J/m3 Hz), and nabs is the absorption rate (number of absorptions per unit
volume per unit time).
Once the atom has been excited to a higher energy level, it can make a subsequent transition to a
lower energy level, accompanied by the emission of electromagnetic radiation. The emission process
can occur by spontaneous emission or stimulated emission. Each absorption removes a photon, and
each emission creates a photon.
1.1.1.3 Spontaneous Emission Spontaneous emission occurs when transition from the excited to
the lower energy level is not stimulated by any incident radiation (Figure 1.3b). The transition results
in the emission of a photon of energy:
ΔE = E2 − E1 = hp𝜈 (1.4)❦
❦ ❦
❦
6 LASER BACKGROUND
where 𝜈 is the frequency of the emitted photon. In spontaneous emission, the rate of emission per
unit volume, nsp, to the lower energy level is only proportional to the population, N2, at the higher
energy level, and is independent of radiation energy density:
nsp = AeN2 (1.5)
where Ae is the Einstein coefficient for spontaneous emission, or spontaneous emission probability
per unit time.
1.1.1.4 Stimulated Emission If the atom in energy level 2 is subjected to electromagnetic radia￾tion or photon of frequency 𝜈 corresponding to the energy difference ΔE = E2 −E1 between levels 1
and 2, the photon will stimulate the atom to undergo a transition to the lower energy level. The energy
emitted is the same as the stimulating photon and is superimposed on the incident photon, thereby
reinforcing the emitted light (Figure 1.3c). This results in stimulated emission, where the incident
and emitted photons have the same characteristics and are in phase, resulting in a high degree of
coherence, and the direction, frequency, and state of polarization of the emitted photon are essen￾tially the same as those of the incident photon. The two photons can generate yet another set, with a
resulting avalanche of photons. This is illustrated schematically in Figure 1.4. The rate of emission
per unit volume, nst, in the case of stimulated emission is given by:
nst = B21N2e(𝜈) (1.6)
where B21 is the Einstein coefficient for stimulated emission, or stimulated emission probability per
unit time per unit energy density (m3 Hz/J s).
1.1.1.5 Einstein Coefficients: Ae, B12, B21 Under conditions of thermal equilibrium, the rates of
upward (E1 → E2) and downward (E2 → E1) transitions must be the same. Thus, we have
n1→2 = n2→1 (1.7)
or from Eqs. (1.3), (1.5), and (1.6),
B12N1e(𝜈) = B21N2e(𝜈) + AeN2 (1.8)
This gives the energy density as:
e(𝜈) =

Example 1.1 (a) Compare the rates of spontaneous and stimulated emission at room temperature
(T = 300 K) for an atomic transition where the frequency associated with the transition is 3 × 1010 Hz,
in the microwave region.
Solution:
From Eqs. (1.10) and (1.11),
hp𝜈
kBT = 6.625 × 10−34(J s) × 3 × 1010(Hz)
1.38 × 10−23(J∕K) × 300(K) ≈ 5 × 10−3
Thus, Ae
B = (e5×10−3
− 1)e(𝜈) ≈ 0
This indicates that the stimulated emission rate is much greater than the spontaneous emission
rate, and thus amplification is feasible in the microwave range at room temperature.
(b) Repeat Example 1.1a for a transition frequency in the optical region of 𝜈 =1015.
Solution:
hp𝜈
kBT = 6.625 × 10−34(J s) × 1015(Hz)
1.38 × 10−23(J∕K) × 300(K) ≈ 160
⇒
Ae
B = (e160 − 1)e(𝜈)≈∞
indicating that spontaneous emission is then predominant, resulting in incoherent emission from
normal light sources. In other words, under conditions of thermal equilibrium, stimulated emission
in the optical range is very unlikely.
(c) What will be the wavelength of the line spectrum resulting from the transition of an electron
from an energy level of 40 × 10−20 J to a level of 15 × 10−20 J?
Solution:
From Eq. (1.1), we have
ΔE = hpc
𝜆 = hp𝜈
⇒ (40 − 15) × 10−20 = 6.625 × 10−34 × 3 × 108

Therefore,
𝜆 = 0.792 × 10−6 m = 0.792 μm.
1.1.2 Lifetime
The lifetime, 𝜏sp, of atoms in an excited state is a measure of the time period over which spontaneous
transition occurs. Strictly speaking, this is how long it takes for the number of atoms in the excited
state to reduce to 1/e of the initial value. It can be shown that 𝜏sp is related to the Einstein coefficient
for spontaneous emission by:
Ae = 1
𝜏sp
(1.12)
1.1.3 Optical Absorption
The intensity, I, of a laser beam diminishes as it propagates through an absorbing medium. The
variation of the beam intensity with distance (Figure 1.5) can be expressed as:
dI(x)
dx = −𝛼I(x) (1.13)
Integration of Eq. (1.13) results in the following expression for the beam variation in the material:
I(x) = I0e−𝛼x (1.14)
where I0 is the intensity of the incident beam (W/m2) and 𝛼 is the absorption coefficient (m−1).
This is known as the Beer–Lambert law and indicates that the beam intensity varies exponentially
as it propagates into the medium.
Example 1.2 A medium absorbs 1% of the light incident on it over a distance of 1.5 mm into the
medium. Determine
(i) The medium’s absorption coefficient.
(ii) The length of the medium if it transmits 75% of the light.❦
❦ ❦
❦
LASER GENERATION 9
Solution:
(i) From Eq. (1.14), we have
I(x) = I0e−𝛼x
If 1% of the incident light is absorbed over a distance of 1.5 mm, then
0.99 × I0 = I0e−𝛼×1.5
⇒ loge 0.99 = −1.5 × 𝛼
Therefore,
𝛼 = 6.7 × 10−3∕mm
(ii) If 75% of the incident light is transmitted, then
0.75 × I0 = I0e−6.7×10−3×x
⇒ loge 0.75 = −6.7 × 10−3 × x
Therefore,
x = 42.9 mm
1.1.4 Population Inversion
The absorption coefficient, 𝛼, is positive if N1 >N2. The beam intensity then decreases exponentially
with distance into the material. Since N1 >N2 under normal thermal equilibrium conditions, the beam
will be attenuated as it propagates through the medium.
However, if conditions are such that the number of atoms at the higher energy level is greater
than those at the lower energy level, that is, N2 >N1, then 𝛼 will be negative, in which case the beam
intensity will increase exponentially as it propagates through the medium. Equation (1.14) can then
be written as:
I(x) = I0e𝛽x (1.15)
𝛽 is referred to as the small-signal gain coefficient and is positive. Such amplification of the original
radiation results from stimulated emission that occurs when the right conditions exist.
The condition where N2 >N1 with more atoms existing at the higher energy level than at the
lower energy level is referred to as population inversion (Figure 1.6). Boltzmann’s equation indicates
that population inversion does not occur under normal thermal equilibrium conditions. For it to be
possible, atoms within the laser medium have to be excited or pumped to a nonequilibrium state.
This is done with the fusion of a substantial quantity of energy to the medium using an external
source. A material in which population inversion is induced is called an active medium.
Even though population inversion is a necessary condition for achieving laser action, it is not
a sufficient condition, since a significant number of the excited atoms decay spontaneously to the
lower energy level. Compensation for the loss due to such decay is accomplished by introducing
positive feedback into the system to amplify the laser beam. This is done using optical resonators.
1.1.5 Threshold Gain
In an actual laser, the active medium is normally placed between two mirrors, and these together
constitute the resonator (Figure 1.7a). Initially, spontaneous emission results in photons being❦

generated in all directions (Figure 1.7b). However, as stimulated emission becomes significant, an
electromagnetic wave traveling along the axis of the resonator oscillates between the two mirrors
(Figure 1.7c). When population inversion exists, the radiation is amplified on each passage through
the medium resulting in buildup of signal intensity (Figure 1.7d). A useful output beam is obtained
by making one of the mirrors partially transparent. This output beam is the laser that comes out
of the system. Such output coupling, along with absorption and scattering by the active medium,
absorption by the mirrors, and so on, result in losses in the radiation intensity. These losses may
be simply described by Eq. (1.14). If the losses encountered by the radiation during each passage
are greater than the amplification or gain of the laser, as shown in Eq. (1.15), then the oscillations
cannot continue, and the radiation intensity will eventually die down. Thus, for oscillations to
be maintained, the gain of the system must at least be equal to the losses in the system. This is
accomplished when a threshold gain, 𝛽th, is reached.
1.1.6 Two-Photon Absorption
When an electric field, E1, is applied to a material, the polarization, P1, that results is linear when the
strength of the electric field is relatively low, as obtained for ordinary light sources, and is given by:
Pl(t) = 𝜒El(t) (1.16)
where 𝜒 is the susceptibility of the dielectric medium and is independent of E1(t), but it is a function
of the frequency.
The actual relationship between the electric field and polarization is a power series given by:
Pl(t) = 𝜒(1)
El(t) + 𝜒(2)
El(t)
2 + 𝜒(3)
El(t)
3 +··· (1.17)
Here, 𝜒(m) is a tensor, and 𝜒(1) = 𝜒, resulting in a linear term. However, 𝜒(2), 𝜒(3), and so on are
nonlinear susceptibilities and define the degree of nonlinearity. The elements of 𝜒(m) get smaller,
the higher the m gets. Thus for the effects of the higher-order terms to be detected, the intensity
of the light source has to be very high. This is normally achieved with pulsed lasers.❦

Now normal excitation of an atom or molecule from a lower energy level to a higher level involves
absorption of a photon of a specific energy or wavelength defined by the energy levels. When the
atom is exposed to radiation of a high enough intensity, the atom can simultaneously absorb two
longer wavelength photons, resulting in the same effect as a single photon of half the wavelength
(Figure 1.8). The process is referred to as two-photon absorption. The combined energy of the two
photons enables the atom to be excited to the higher energy level. In essence, each photon provides
half the energy of the electronic transition. This occurs because each of the longer wavelength
photons can excite the atom to a transient or virtual state which has a lifetime of a few femtoseconds.
The virtual state is forbidden for a single-photon transition. Two-photon absorption can only take

place if the second photon is absorbed before the virtual state decays. The concerted interaction of
the two photons then results in a combined energy that enables the atom to be excited to a level
equivalent to what would be induced by a single photon of half the wavelength or twice the energy.
Since the two photons have to be absorbed simultaneously, it is essential for the laser source to
be ultrashort-pulsed, and of high peak power or intensity. Femtosecond lasers have thus been found
very effective in a number of applications.
Two-photon absorption has found application in such areas as fluorescence microscopy,
3D optical data storage, lithography, photodynamic therapy, and microfabrication/nanofabrication.
1.2 OPTICAL RESONATORS
The principle of an optical resonator is illustrated schematically in Figure 1.7. To understand the
characteristics of optical resonators, we take a brief look at wave propagation.
1.2.1 Standing Waves In A Rectangular Cavity
The electromagnetic waves of light have associated with them electric and magnetic fields which
oscillate in a direction perpendicular to the general direction of wave propagation (Figure 1.9).
The two waves are in phase, but perpendicular to each other, and can be represented by electric
and magnetic vectors, El and H, respectively.
Now let us consider a closed rectangular cavity with dimensions as shown in Figure 1.10, which
is filled with a homogeneous and isotropic dielectric medium that sustains an electromagnetic wave.
It can be shown that the permissible oscillating frequencies or waves of the field in the cavity are
given by:
𝜈2 = c2
4
( m2
4a2 + n2
4b2 + p2
L2
)
(1.18)
where m, n, and p give the number of nodes that the standing wave has along the y, z, and x
axes, respectively. Each set of values of m, n, and p represents a well-defined cavity mode with a
well-defined resonant frequency.
The number of modes, Mc(𝜈), that exist in a closed cavity of volume, Vc, over a frequency interval
Δ𝜈 can be shown to be

Example 1.3 A laser cavity has a wavelength centered at 𝜆 = 1500 nm. If the cavity volume is
2000 mm3, determine the number of modes which fall in a bandwidth of Δ𝜆 = 0.2 nm.
Solution:
The number of modes is given by:
Mc(𝜈) =
8𝜋𝜈2Vc
c3 Δ𝜈
Now
𝜈𝜆 = c, see Eq. (3.1a)
where c is the velocity at which electromagnetic radiation propagates in free space.
⇒ 𝜈 = c
𝜆 = 3 × 108
1500 × 10−9 = 2 × 1014 Hz
Also, from Eq. (3.2),
Δ𝜈 = −( c
𝜆2
)
Δ𝜆 = − 3 × 108
(1500 × 10−9)2
× 0.2 × 10−9 = −2.67 × 1010 Hz
The negative sign arises since the wavelength increases as the frequency decreases. Now we have
Mc(𝜈) = 8𝜋 × (2 × 1014)
2 × 2000 × 10−9
(3 × 108)3
× 2.67 × 1010 = 1.99 × 109
1.2.2 Planar Resonators
An enclosed cavity with this high number of modes oscillating would result in a laser beam covering
a very wide range of wavelengths. To overcome this problem, an open resonator (Figure 1.11), which
has the lateral portions of the resonator removed, is normally used. With such a configuration, the
modes traveling along the resonator axis will keep oscillating between the mirrors. However, the
modes formed by superposition of waves traveling at an angle to the axis of the resonator will be
lost after a few traversals. Thus, m, n ≪ p. This is essentially a planar resonator.❦

We can then use a power series expansion to reduce Eq. (1.18), for the case where a = b, to give
the resonant frequencies 𝜈 in the cavity, in the form:

Ignoring the last two terms of Eq. (1.20) enables the resonant frequencies to be approximated by:

But the wavenumber kx is given by:
kx = 2𝜋
𝜆 = p𝜋
L (1.22)
giving the oscillating wavelength as:
𝜆 = 2L
p
(1.23)
Thus, for the resonant or permissible frequencies that oscillate in the cavity, L is an integer mul￾tiple (p) of half-wavelengths.
The Fabry–Perot resonator is very difficult to operate in single mode and is not widely used.
1.2.2.1 Beam Modes There are two main categories of beam mode:
1. Longitudinal or axial modes.
2. Transverse modes.
Longitudinal Modes From Eq. (1.20), consider two modes that have the same values of m and n,
but with a unit difference in the p value. The corresponding difference in frequency of oscillation
is then
Δ𝜈p = c
2L (1.24)❦
❦ ❦
❦
OPTICAL RESONATORS 15
These two contiguous modes will only differ in their field distribution along the longitudinal
(or x) axis. Thus, the different modes resulting from the different values of p are referred to as the
longitudinal or axial modes. The various axial modes appear as a single spot in the laser output, even
though they are separated at discrete frequencies in the spectral domain.
For illustration, we note that a typical value for the mirror spacing in a laser would be about
L =1500 mm. Then,
Δ𝜈p ≈ 3 × 1011
2 × 1500 = 100 MHz
Thus, the separation between the longitudinal modes for this cavity is 100 MHz (Figure 1.12a).
The laser transition linewidth (Section 1.5.1; Figure 1.12b) is normally much wider, say, 1 GHz
for a Doppler broadened medium (Section 1.5.2.2). As a result, the output of the laser will con￾sist of a number oscillating discrete frequencies, the axial modes, within the broadened linewidth
(Figure 1.12c).
Transverse Modes When the modes have the same p value but differ in their values for m and n, the
resulting field distributions differ in the transverse direction and are thus referred to as the transverse
modes of the cavity. These give an indication of the distribution of intensity within the beam cross
section. If we consider adjacent transverse modes where m = n but the value of p does not change,
and with Δm = 1, then we have from Eq. (1.20) (Problems 1.12 and 1.13):

And considering the same example used for the axial modes, but with the mirror dimensions
a =b = 10 mm, and with the beam in the infrared region of wavelength 𝜆 ≈ 2
3 × 10−3 mm, then
since m ≈1, we find that

Thus, Δ𝜈p ≫ Δ𝜈m, indicating that the separation in frequency between longitudinal modes is
much greater than that between transverse modes (Figure 1.13).
The transverse modes show as a pattern of spots and are often referred to as transverse electro￾magnetic or TEM modes. They are characterized by two integers (m, n) that indicate the number
of modes in two orthogonal directions and are thus designated by TEMmn. The m and n values are
typically small, about 10 or less, and the larger the values, the more complex and spread out are the
beam patterns.
The modes may have either rectangular or circular symmetry. For rectangular symmetry, the mode
number is one less than the number of illuminated zones or pattern of spots in the corresponding
direction. The first number corresponds to the y-axis, while the second number corresponds to the
z-axis. Some common mode shapes are shown in Figure 1.14. TEM00 is the zero-order mode and
ideally has a Gaussian distribution (Figure 1.15). A laser operating in this mode has the highest
spectral purity and degree of coherence and can be focused to the laser’s theoretical minimum radius.

This mode is more common in lower-power lasers. The distribution of laser intensity across the beam
is then given by:
I(r) = Ipe
(

𝑤2
)
(1.26)
where I(r) is the beam intensity at any radial position, r (W/cm2), Ip is the peak beam intensity
(W/cm2), r is the radial coordinate (cm), and 𝑤 is the radius at which beam intensity is (1/e2) × Ip or
0.14 × Ip. That means 86% of the total energy is contained in a spot of radius 𝑤 (cm).
In some manufacturing processes such as laser cutting, it is desirable to have the Gaussian mode
so that the focused beam diameter which corresponds to the highest power density in the beam is
achieved. On the other hand, the multimode beam is more desirable for laser butt welding applica￾tions where the wider beam area reduces restrictions on joint precision requirements.
1.2.2.2 Line Selection Lasers often undergo transition simultaneously on a number of transition
lines or wavelengths. However, in situations where a higher degree of monochromaticity is desired,
the laser should be made to oscillate on only one of the transitions. This can be done by inserting a
wavelength dispersive element such as a prism or diffraction grating into the cavity (Figure 1.16).
As the beam propagates through the prism, the individual wavelengths undergo different levels of
refraction. The wavelength whose ray is directed normal to the mirror is reflected back into the

cavity, while the other wavelengths experience losses, resulting in only one wavelength oscillating.
Even when the laser is oscillating on a single line, that line itself may be broadened and could be
oscillating on a number of modes.
1.2.2.3 Mode Selection When a laser is used for alignment, low beam divergence is necessary,
and the lowest divergence is obtained with the TEM00 mode.
Transverse Mode Selection The higher-order modes can be eliminated by placing a diaphragm
in the cavity and having it normal to the cavity axis. If the aperture of the diaphragm is
made small enough, the higher-order modes are severely attenuated, leaving only the TEM00 mode.
One drawback of this technique is reduction in the overall output power.
Longitudinal Mode Selection This is necessary for highly monochromatic output beams. One com￾mon technique involves cavity length variation.
As discussed earlier in Section 1.2.2.1, the longitudinal modes are spaced apart by:
Δ𝜈p = c
2L (1.27)
Decreasing the cavity length L increases the spacing between the discrete frequency modes. Thus
if the cavity length is decreased to the point that the frequency spacing is greater than the transition
linewidth (Section 1.5.1; Figure 1.12), then only one mode will oscillate. This technique is effective
for cavities where the laser linewidths are relatively small, such as for gas lasers. One setback of
the technique, though, is that decreasing the cavity length decreases the volume of active material
available for lasing, and thus the output power. It is not appropriate for solids and liquids where the
laser linewidths are much greater.
Other methods for longitudinal mode selection include the Fabry–Perot etalon and Fox–Smith
interferometer.
1.2.3 Confocal Resonators
A confocal resonator consists of a pair of spherical mirrors which have the same radius, rm, and
are positioned such that the focal points of the two mirrors coincide, that is, F1 ≡F2. The center of
curvature of each mirror then lies on the surface of the other mirror so that the distance L separating
the mirrors is equal to the radius, rm (Figure 1.17).

are therefore frequency degenerate. The frequency difference between two contiguous longitudinal
modes is given by:

the beam waist and the point where the beam size is √
2 times the waist size:
xR ≈ 𝜋𝑤w

Distances within the Rayleigh range are referred to as the near-field region, while those much
greater than the Rayleigh range are referred to as the far-field region.
One advantage of confocal resonators is that they exhibit the lowest diffraction losses for the
TEM00 mode. One disadvantage, however, is that the waist spot size 𝑤w that is obtained is normally
much smaller than the cross-sectional area of the active medium so that the resonator does not make
full use of the available medium or mode volume. As a result, confocal resonators are seldom used.
1.2.4 Concentric Resonators
With concentric resonators, the mirrors have the same radii of curvature, rm, and are located such
that the centers of curvature, C1 and C2, coincide (Figure 1.20). The separation distance, L, is then
equal to twice the radius of curvature. Concentric resonators have the disadvantage that they are
sensitive to mirror alignment. Furthermore, the beam spot size at the center of the resonator is small.
As a result, they are not frequently used.

LASER PUMPING 21
Most resonators thus use concave mirrors with large radii of curvature, that is, rmi ≫ L. The spot
sizes obtained for such mirrors are relatively large, and the resonators of which they are made are
not as sensitive to alignment of the mirrors. Of course, as rmi → ∞, we end up with a plane mirror.
1.3 LASER PUMPING
Pumping is the process by which atoms are raised from a lower to a higher energy level to achieve
a population inversion. Two techniques that are commonly used for industrial lasers are as follows:
1. Optical pumping.
2. Electrical pumping.
1.3.1 Optical Pumping
This form of pumping involves the excitation of the active medium using an intense source of light.
Two types of light sources commonly used are as follows:
1. An arc lamp or a flashlamp.
2. Another laser, typically a diode laser.
1.3.1.1 Arc or Flashlamp Pumping Arc and flashlamps are preferably used with solid-state or
liquid lasers since the lamp output bandwith is relatively broad, and thus for efficient absorption, the
active medium also has to have a broad linewidth.
One form of lamp-based optical pumping is illustrated in Figure 1.21, where a linear pumping
source (cylindrical in shape) is placed along one principal axis (focus, F1) of an elliptical cav￾ity (reflector) and the laser rod (active medium) along the other axis, F2. When light from either
axis (focus) of a specular (mirror-like) elliptical cavity in a plane orthogonal to the cylinder axis is
reflected, it passes through the second axis. Thus, a significant portion of the light from the source is
directed, after reflection, toward the laser rod. The reflector may be specular or diffuse. Diffuse reflec￾tors tend to reflect light in all directions. Specular reflectors result in a higher pumping efficiency,
but less uniform pumping of the active material, compared to diffuse reflectors.
Another type of configuration involves a lamp source in the form of a helix and is placed within
a cylindrical container with a specular interior surface. The active material, which is in the form of a

rod, is placed at the center of the helix (Figure 1.22). Light from the lamp source propagates either
directly to the rod, or after reflection from the interior of the cylindrical container.
Pulsed lasers are normally pumped using medium pressure (500–1500 Torr [mm Hg]) xenon
or krypton lamps. An intense flash of light is applied for a period of the order of microseconds.
Continuous-wave lasers are based on a high pressure (4000–8000 Torr) krypton or tungsten-iodine
lamp that is continuously applied. Typical lamp life is about 800 hours.
1.3.1.2 Diode Laser Pumping Optical pumping efficiency is enhanced by using another laser for
pumping. Since the pumping laser infuses energy at a specific wavelength, very little of its energy
is wasted. Diode lasers are commonly used, especially for solid-state lasers. Two common pumping
configurations used are as follows:
1. Longitudinal or end pumping.
2. Transverse or side pumping.
Longitudinal Pumping The longitudinal or end pumping technique is illustrated in Figure 1.23.
The pumping beam is coupled to the laser medium from one end of the laser rod, along the resonator
axis. A lens arrangement is used to concentrate the beam to a small and circular spot. The pumping
beam can also be delivered using a fiber optic cable.
Transverse Pumping With transverse pumping, the laser diodes are radially arranged around the
active medium (Figure 1.24.). Several diode pumped rods may be arranged in series in order to

achieve high output powers in the kilowatt range. As in the case of longitudinal pumping, the beam
can also be delivered using fiber optic cables.
The efficiency of a lamp-based system is normally in the range of 1–3%. This is the fraction of the
input electrical energy that is converted to useful output. The 97–99% of energy that is not used is
removed in the form of heat using a chiller. Using a diode laser for pumping increases the efficiency
to the range of 30–40%.
1.3.2 Electrical Pumping
Electrical pumping is more commonly used with gas and semiconductor lasers. Pumping involves
the creation of an electrical discharge by passing electrical energy, of the order of 1 to 2 kV at a low
current of about 50 mA, through the gas medium, in the case of gas lasers (Figure 1.25).
Acceleration of electrons by the electric field results in excitation of atoms, ions, or molecules
with which they collide, from the ground state to a higher level by imparting their kinetic energy to
the atoms. The ground state refers to the situation when all the electrons are in their normal orbits.
The electrical energy may be applied as a dc (direct current) or rf (radio frequency alternating)
electric field. In dc-generated discharges, the electrodes are contained within the discharge tube, and
over a period of time, the electrodes may become contaminated. Changing the electrodes requires

24 LASER BACKGROUND
access to the interior of the tube, a process that may in itself introduce additional contamination.
On the other hand, with rf-generated discharges, the electric field is generated from outside the
discharge tube, and thus the electrodes can be changed without accessing the interior of the tube.
Excitation frequencies for rf-excited lasers are typically of the order of 30 MHz, and thus they tend
to have a fast response to a change in power, as compared to dc-excited lasers. This characteristic
makes it easier to modulate rf-excited lasers, resulting in very high pulse rates, up to 15 kHz. In
addition, higher levels of electrical power densities can be achieved, along with greater homogeneity
of the plasma, in rf-excited lasers. This further improves beam quality and also enables more compact
generator configuration to be achieved for the same power output. Radio frequency excitation does
not require the use of permanent anodes and cathodes. Thus, cathode problems that result from gas
reactions are eliminated. However, rf-excited lasers tend to have lower overall efficiencies compared
to dc-excited lasers.
1.4 SYSTEM LEVELS
1.4.1 Two-Level System
As indicated in Eq. (1.2), the distribution of atoms under thermal equilibrium at any given tempera￾ture is given by Boltzmann’s law which may be expressed in general form as:
Nj
Ni
= e
− ΔEij
kBT (1.35)
where Ni and Nj are the number of atoms per unit volume in the lower and higher energy states,
respectively, ΔEij is the energy difference between the two states, kB is Boltzmann’s constant, and T
is the absolute temperature.
It can be shown that for a two-level system, absorption occurs only insofar as there are more
atoms in the lower energy state than in the higher energy state. As the atoms are pumped to the point
where the two energy levels are equally populated, absorption stops. Thus, population inversion is
difficult to achieve in a two-level system.
1.4.2 Three-Level System
We now consider a three-energy-level system (Figure 1.26), with populations per unit volume given
by N1, N2, and N3. The lowest energy level is 1, and 3 is the highest. Atoms are normally pumped
from the lowest level, 1, to the highest level, 3. From there, they undergo rapid decay to level 2 and
radiative transition that results in lasing action occurs between levels 2 and 1.
Let Wij be the probability per unit time of the atom being thermally excited between levels i and j.
A population inversion exists between energy levels 1 and 2 for a three-level system, that is
N2 >N1, only if
W32 > W21 (1.36)
However, this is only a necessary condition for laser oscillations to occur, but not sufficient since
the population inversion has to be high enough to overcome excess cavity losses. A threshold level
of the population inversion must also be achieved. Now from Eq. (1.12), we have
Wij ∝ 1

Thus, the lifetime for transition from level 3 to level 2 must be smaller than the lifetime for
transition from level 2 to level 1, for population inversion to be possible in a three-level system
(Figure 1.26). Level 3 is then practically empty, while population buildup occurs on level 2, resulting
in population inversion between levels 2 and 1.
Lasing transition occurs between levels 2 and 1, and since level 3 is normally not a laser level,
it can have a broadband, and that makes it possible to pump the system effectively using an optical
source with a broad bandwidth.
1.4.2.1 Four-Level System For the four-level laser (Figure 1.27), we denote the levels of interest
as 0, 1, 2, and 3, for the lasing levels to correspond with those of the three-level system. It can then
be shown that population inversion between energy levels 1 and 2 can be achieved, that is N2 >N1,
only if
W10 > W21 (1.38)
Population inversion can be obtained in a four-level system much more easily, and with very little
pumping power because the process is independent of pumping power, while that for a three-level
system depends on the pumping power.

26 LASER BACKGROUND
Just as for the three-level system, level 3 in the four-level system can have a broadband since it
is not a laser level, and thus it is possible to pump the system effectively using an optical source
with a broad bandwidth. Furthermore, the energy difference between levels 1 and 0 has to be much
greater than kBT, that is, ΔE01 ≫ kBT so that the population of level 1 is essentially negligible at
ordinary temperatures. Otherwise, level 1 would be populated by atoms from level 0 through thermal
excitation, thereby reducing the population inversion and the efficiency of the system.
1.5 BROADENING MECHANISMS
Our discussion thus far has been based on the idealized assumption that there exists a single
frequency, the resonant frequency, at which lasing occurs. However, the transition frequency is not
exactly monochromatic, but it is spread over a finite frequency range. The principal mechanisms
that cause broadening of the transition frequency and their corresponding line shape functions are
discussed in Sections 1.5.1–1.5.3.
1.5.1 Line Shape Function
The finite range over which the transition frequency is spread is called the atomic linewidth and
is centered about a resonant frequency, 𝜔0. The interaction between the atom and incident radia￾tion is thus a function of frequency and is known as the line shape function, designated g(𝜔, 𝜔0).
The function g(𝜔, 𝜔0)d𝜔 represents the probability that the transition frequency lies between 𝜔 and
𝜔+d𝜔 and is centered at the resonant frequency 𝜔0. In the normalized form, the line shape function
is defined such that
∫
∞
−∞
g(𝜔, 𝜔0)d𝜔 = 1 (1.39)
It is characterized using the width or frequency range Δ𝜔0 = 2Δ𝜔 = 2(𝜔−𝜔0) at the point of the
curve where its amplitude is half the maximum amplitude. This is referred to as the full width at half
maximum (FWHM) (Figure 1.28).
1.5.2 Line-Broadening Mechanisms
Broadening mechanisms can be grouped under two main categories:
1. Homogeneous broadening.
2. Inhomogeneous broadening.
1.5.2.1 Homogeneous Broadening In homogeneous broadening, the mechanism has the same
effect on each atom, with each one having the same resonant frequency and atomic line shape. Homo￾geneous broadening mechanisms include natural or intrinsic broadening, and collision broadening.
Natural Broadening Natural broadening is the basic form of broadening that would exist even if
there were no other form of broadening. It is associated with the finite lifetime of the excited state
due to spontaneous emission, and the corresponding line shape function is given by:
g(𝜔, 𝜔0) =

This line shape function is Lorentzian (Figure 1.28). The maximum value occurs at 𝜔 = 𝜔0, and

Δ𝜔0 = 2Δ𝜔 = 1
𝜏sp
(1.41)
Natural broadening sets a lower limit on the atomic linewidth, and because of its relatively small
magnitude, it tends to be predominated by other broadening mechanisms.
Collision Broadening Collision broadening is more predominant in gaseous media and results pri￾marily from collision between atoms. The phase 𝜙 of the radiated wave changes abruptly if the
atom suffers a collision while undergoing emission (Figure 1.29). Such random phase changes cause
broadening of the atomic linewidth.
𝜙 is constant between collisions but changes randomly at each collision. The line shape function
of the emission associated with such collisions is given by:
g(𝜔, 𝜔0) = 1
𝜋

It is also Lorentzian. The maximum value of the function at 𝜔 = 𝜔0 is tca/𝜋. The corresponding
FWHM is then given by: Δ𝜔0 = 2Δ𝜔 = 2

An estimate of the average time between collisions of an atom or molecule, tca, can be obtained
by considering the mean free path and the average thermal velocity and is given by:

the radius of the atom or molecule, and T is absolute temperature.
For example, for neon gas which is at room temperature and under a pressure of 0.5 Torr, we have
tca ≈ 0.5 × 10−6s
The corresponding FWHM is then
Δ𝜔0 = 2Δ𝜔 = 2
0.5 × 10−6 = 4 × 106 rad∕s
or
Δ𝜈0 = 0.64 MHz
Similar effects arise in solids as a result of the interaction of atoms with the lattice.
1.5.2.2 Inhomogeneous Broadening In inhomogeneous broadening, the resonant frequency of
each atom is different or spread out, resulting in a band of frequencies for the entire ensemble, even
though the lines of individual atoms are not necessarily broadened.
The most common form of inhomogeneous broadening in gas lasers is Doppler broadening. It is
essentially a result of the Doppler effect, which is the phenomenon whereby an observer who is mov￾ing at a velocity u detects a frequency 𝜔0 (centerline frequency) that is different from the frequency
𝜔 detected by an observer who is in a stationary frame. A simple illustration of this is the sound of
a moving car as detected by an observer standing by the roadside. Even though the frequency of the
sound is the same to the driver (observer in the car, 𝜔0), the sound heard or detected by the standing
observer (𝜔) has a higher frequency as the car approaches and a lower frequency as the car recedes
from the stationary observer. This is because the number of oscillations that reach the stationary
observer per unit time is increased or decreased depending on whether the car is approaching or
receding.
Gaseous atoms, as we know, are in constant motion at rather high velocities. Now let the radia￾tion emitted by an atom while in motion have a frequency 𝜔0 (as measured in the moving coordinate
system or as seen by the atom). Further, let the absolute velocity of the atom (as measured rela￾tive to the stationary coordinate system) be u. If the component of this velocity in the direction of❦
❦ ❦
❦
BEAM MODIFICATION 29
wave propagation is ux, then the frequency 𝜔 of the emitted radiation as observed in the stationary
coordinate system will be related to 𝜔0 by:
𝜔 = 𝜔0
(
1 ± ux
c
)
(1.45)
The positive or negative sign depends on whether the velocity is in the opposite or same direction
as the emitted wave. Thus, even though the transition or centerline frequency 𝜔0 might be constant,
each atom would be observed to be emitting radiation at a different resonant frequency depending
on its direction, and that is what results in broadening of the emission line shape.

1.5.3 Comparison of Individual Mechanisms
To get an idea of the relative impacts of each of these broadening mechanisms, we consider a He–Ne
laser with a transition at 𝜆 = 632.8 nm, and which is at room temperature, 300 K and pressure of
0.5 Torr. For natural broadening, 𝜏sp ≈ 10−8 s. Thus,
Δ𝜈0nat = 2Δ𝜈nat = 1

≈ 20 MHz
For collision broadening, tca ≈ 0.5 × 10−6 s. Thus,
Δ𝜈0col = 2Δ𝜈col = 1

≈ 0.64 MHz
For Doppler broadening,
Δ𝜈0Dop = 2Δ𝜈Dop = 2𝜈0

The example indicates that Doppler broadening is the predominant form, with collision broaden￾ing being relatively negligible. This is the case for the He–Ne laser where the cavity pressures are
relatively low. However, at high enough pressures, such as with the CO2 laser, collision broadening
becomes significant.

to be achieved. For example, a higher peak power may be required to initiate cutting or welding in
some materials, with the power level that is needed being significantly reduced once the material
melts. Sections 1.6.1–1.6.3 discuss techniques used for varying the beam characteristics.
1.6.1 Quality Factor
The Q-factor or quality factor, Qf, is a measure of the losses or energy dissipation in any mode of
the laser cavity and is defined as:
Qf = 𝜔0 × energy stored in the mode
Energy lost or dissipated in the mode per unit time (1.48)
= 2𝜋 × energy stored in the mode
Energy lost or dissipated per cycle = 𝜔0 × Q
ql
(1.49)
where Q is the energy stored in the mode at any instant in time, ql is the power loss in the mode, and
𝜔0 is the oscillation or transition frequency of that mode.
A cavity whose Q-factor is high stores energy well. Equation (1.49) can be rewritten as:
ql = 𝜔0 × Q
Qf
(1.50)
or
dQ
dt = −𝜔0 × Q
Qf
(1.51)
The negative sign reflects a loss or reduction in energy with time. The solution of Eq. (1.51) is
Q(t) = Q0e
−𝜔0
Qf
t (1.52)
where Q0 is the initial energy at time t = 0.
The time constant of the system described by Eq. (1.52), which is equivalent to the cavity lifetime,
𝜏c, is thus given by:
𝜏c = Qf
𝜔0
(1.53)
The corresponding electric field amplitude of the mode is given by:
El(t) = E0e

since the time constant of the field amplitude is twice that of the field intensity. E0 in Eq. (1.54) is the
initial electric field amplitude at time t = 0. The first exponential expresses the decay of the signal
intensity with time.
Taking the Fourier transform gives the field spectral density as:

where R1 and R2 are the reflection coefficients of the two mirrors, L is the length of the active medium,
cm = c/n is the velocity of light in the medium, and n is the medium refractive index.
1.6.2 Q-Switching
Some basic pulsed solid-state lasers have a pulse duration of about 1 ms, with peak powers of the
order of kilowatts. Q-switching is a technique that is used to produce laser outputs of higher power
(megawatts), and of shorter duration (nanoseconds). It must be noted, however, that even though the
output power is increased, the total energy content of the pulse is not and may even be less.
To understand the principle behind Q-switching, we consider a laser cavity in which a shutter
is placed in front of one of the mirrors. When the shutter is closed, it prevents light energy from
reaching the second mirror, and thereby being reflected back into the cavity. In other words, most
of the light energy is lost, and oscillation cannot take place. The Q-value of the cavity is then very
low (Figure 1.30a-1), since the losses are high (Figure 1.30a-2). As pumping of the laser continues
(Figure 1.30a-3), the population inversion keeps building up (Figure 1.30a-4), far in excess of the
threshold value, without any oscillation taking place. When a significantly high value of population
inversion has been achieved, the shutter is suddenly opened to reduce the losses. At this point, the gain
of the laser (due to the high population inversion) is much greater than the losses. The high energy
accumulated as a result of the large difference between the instantaneous and threshold population
inversions is then released as an intense beam of short duration (Figure 1.30a-5). Opening of the
shutter to reduce the losses increases the Q-value of the cavity. Hence, the name Q-switching.
Q-switching can either result in a single pulse, in which case the pump rate is also pulsed
(Figure 1.30a) or it can be repetitively pulsed, in which case pumping is continuous (Figure 1.30b).
The necessary conditions for a laser to be Q-switchable are as follows:
1. The lifetime, 𝜏u, of the upper level has to be longer than the cavity buildup time, tcb:
𝜏u > tcb
This enables the upper level to store the extra energy pumped into it.
2. The pumping duration, tp, has to be longer than the cavity buildup time, tcb. Preferably, it has
to be at least as long as the lifetime of the upper level, 𝜏u:
tp > tcb and tp ≥ 𝜏u
3. The initial cavity loss must be high enough during pumping to prevent oscillation during that
period.
4. The change in Qf value must be sudden.❦

The major techniques for Q-switching include mechanical shutters, electro-optic shutters,
acousto-optic shutters, and passive shutters. Mechanical shutters are briefly outlined in the
following paragraphs.
With mechanical shutters, one of the cavity mirrors, usually the total reflector, is rotated about an
axis perpendicular to the resonator axis (Figure 1.31). Just before the two mirrors become parallel,
the flashlamp is triggered to initiate pumping action. However, since the mirrors are then not aligned
(closed shutter case), the cavity losses are too high to sustain oscillation. The population inversion
is thus increased beyond the threshold value. The flashlamp trigger is timed such that the population
inversion will be a maximum just when the two mirrors are parallel. The energy stored in the form of
high population inversion is then released as a high-power pulse when the mirrors become aligned
(open shutter case).
The mechanical shutter technique is robust and wavelength-independent. However, the normal
mirror rotational speeds of up to 30,000 revolutions per minute (RPM) result in slow switching
action, which in turn results in a relatively lower peak power. Furthermore, the high rotational
speeds may result in mechanical vibration that can influence the beam stability. Also, obtaining
ideal beam alignment is a significant problem. The vibrational problem may be minimized by using a
quadrilateral- or hexagonal-shaped mirror assembly. As a result, it is difficult to use mechanical shut￾ters for Q-switching, especially for lasers of very short upper-level lifetime, such as argon ion lasers.❦

The typical pulse duration obtained when using mechanical shutters is of the order of 400 ns.
Increasing the rotational speed would increase the peak power and reduce the pulse duration.
They are not extensively used because of the mechanical problems associated with them.
Electro-optic shutters are usually not as robust as mechanical shutters but are much faster. They are
normally useful for single-pulse operation. Acousto-optic modulators are normally used when pump￾ing is continuous to produce repeated pulsing, such as is done with neodymium and argon ion lasers.
Passive Q-switching is based on saturable dyes or absorbers. They are normally used for
single-pulsed operation.
1.6.3 Mode Locking
Mode locking is used to generate pulses of higher peak power (of the order of gigawatts or more)
than can be achieved by Q-switching, and of very short duration (of the order of picoseconds or
femtoseconds).
A laser cavity generally sustains a large number of oscillating modes. The oscillation of each of
these modes is normally independent of the other modes. Mode locking is achieved by combining a
number of distinct longitudinal modes of a laser in phase, with each mode having a slightly different
frequency.
In the ideal case, the various longitudinal modes in a planar resonator are equally spaced
(Figure 1.12c), with a frequency separation given by:
𝛿𝜔 = 𝜋 c
L
or 𝛿v = c
2L (1.59)
where L is the cavity length.
However, nonlinear dispersion of the active medium results in the various modes having random
phases, 𝜙m, with the frequency differences between adjacent modes also being random. The result
is a number of irregular spikes in the laser output. The total electric field, El(t), of the corresponding
electromagnetic wave is a superposition of the fields of all modes and can be expressed as:
El(t) = ∑
Mc
m=1
E0mei(𝜔mt+𝜑m) (1.60)❦
❦ ❦
❦
34 LASER BACKGROUND
where E0m is the amplitude of oscillation of mode m, 𝜔m is the frequency of mode m, 𝜙m is the
phase, and Mc is the number of oscillating modes.
For simplicity, let us consider the case where the various modes are of equal amplitude, E0.
The overall peak beam intensity is then a summation of the intensities of the individual modes:
Ip = McE0
2 (1.61)
Let us now consider the case where the individual modes are locked in phase (forced to maintain
fixed-phase relationships) such that in addition to having the same amplitude, they also oscillate with
equal relative phase:
𝜑m = 𝜑 (1.62)
If the separation between modal frequencies, 𝛿𝜔, are also equal, then we have
𝜔m = 𝜔 + m𝛿𝜔 (1.63)
where 𝜔 is the frequency of the lowest mode.
The electric field can then be expressed as:
El(t) = E0
∑
Mc
m=1
ei[(𝜔+m𝛿𝜔)t+𝜑] = E0ei(𝜔t+𝜑)

Mc
m=1

which when expanded becomes
El(t) = E0ei(𝜔t+𝜑)
[ei𝛿𝜔t + ei2𝛿𝜔t + ei3𝛿𝜔t +···+ eiMc𝛿𝜔t
] (1.65)
The overall beam intensity, which is proportional to |El(t)|2, is then given as:
I(t) = E0
2[ei𝛿𝜔t + ei2𝛿𝜔t + ei3𝛿𝜔t +···+ eiMc𝛿𝜔t
]
2 (1.66)
which forms a geometric series that reduces to the form:
I(t) = E0
2
sin2
(Mc𝛿𝜔t

) (1.67)
The peak intensity, Ip, is obtained by considering small values of time when t≈0 and thus
sin 𝜃 ≈𝜃, giving
Ip = Mc
2E0
2 (1.68)
This is the peak intensity of the mode-locked laser which is thus Mc times that of the
nonmode-locked laser. For a typical solid-state laser where the number of oscillating modes may
be very large, of the order of 104, this can be very significant. The average power, however, is
unaffected by mode locking. The peak intensity occurs at times when sin 𝛿𝜔t/2 = 0:
𝛿𝜔t

The separation between contiguous pulses is then given by:
Δt = 2L
c (1.71)
which is the time taken for a round trip of the cavity. The mode-locked laser may thus be considered
as constituting a pulse that propagates back and forth in the cavity. It can be shown that the pulse
duration, Δ𝜏p, (FWHM) of the beam is given by:
Δ𝜏p ≈ 2𝜋
Mc𝛿𝜔 = 2𝜋
Δ𝜔0
(1.72)
Thus, the larger the oscillating bandwidth, Δ𝜔0, the shorter the output pulse duration. For gas
lasers, the pulse duration is typically of the order of nanoseconds, whereas for solid-state lasers, the
pulse duration may be of the order of picoseconds or less.
The common techniques used for mode locking may be categorized as either active or passive.
We briefly outline the active mode locking method. With this method, an external signal is used to
modulate or vary cavity losses or quality factor, Qf (t), at a frequency equal to the intermodal separa￾tion (Figure 1.32). This can be done using either electro-optic or acousto-optic shutters. We consider
the simple case where the shutter is open very briefly, 𝛿𝜏, after every period of Δt = 2L/c, and closed
the rest of the time (Δt−𝛿𝜏) during that period. A pulse of light of exactly the same length as the
time 𝛿𝜏 that the shutter stays open, and which arrives exactly when the shutter is open, will then
be unaffected by the shutter. Any portion of the signal that arrives when the shutter is closed will be
eliminated. A single pulse that propagates back and forth thus results.
Mode locking induced by cavity losses as described is said to be amplitude-modulated. It can also
be induced by variation in the refractive index of the cavity, which results in variations in optical path
length. It is then said to be frequency-modulated.
1.7 BEAM CHARACTERISTICS
The properties of a laser beam that have significant influence on materials processing include diver￾gence, monochromaticity, coherence, brightness, stability, size, and mode.❦
❦ ❦
❦
36 LASER BACKGROUND
1.7.1 Beam Divergence
Beam divergence may be defined as the characteristic property of a light beam that results in an
increase in its cross-sectional area with distance from the source. Light from an ordinary source is
uniformly radiated in all directions, and as a result, its divergence is high (Figure 1.33a). Its intensity
is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source. A laser, on the other hand, is
such that it is only light which is almost parallel with the resonator axis, and which is close to the
axis that comes out, resulting in relatively low divergence (Figure 1.33b).
Divergence of a diffraction-limited monochromatic beam of wavelength 𝜆 that consists of plane
waves which are incident on a circular aperture of diameter D can be expressed, from diffraction

where K1 is a constant ≈1.22.
The low divergence of a laser enables it to be focused to a very small radius. Single-mode lasers
generally experience less divergence than multimode lasers. Also, a Gaussian beam exhibits the
smallest possible beam divergence (true diffraction-limited beam). A typical value for the diver￾gence, 𝜃d, may be 0.05∘. However, for semiconductor lasers, the divergence can be much higher, by
about two orders of magnitude (Appendix 2.B).
For some manufacturing processes such as laser cutting and microfabrication, it is essential to
have a highly focused beam. Thus, low beam divergence is important. It may not be as important
for high-power laser welding, and even less important for surface heat treatment or laser forming,
where a wider beam area is more desirable.
1.7.2 Monochromaticity
A light beam is said to be monochromatic when it is composed of only a single wavelength. Lasers are
generally considered to be monochromatic (Figure 1.35). However, in reality, due to the broadening
mechanisms discussed earlier, the wavelength of a laser is not exactly monochromatic but covers a
frequency bandwidth. For lasers, the oscillating bandwidth can be very narrow and may range from
Δ𝜈 = 500 Hz (Δ𝜆 = 10−11 μm at 𝜆 = 0.6 μm; Section 3.1) for a high-quality stable gas laser to greater
than 1 GHz (Δ𝜆 = 10−6 μm) for a solid-state laser. In comparison, the bandwidth for a conventional
monochromatic source such as the sodium lamp may be of the order of several gigahertz.
Theoretically, the minimum oscillating linewidth (or fluctuation of the laser frequency) 𝛿𝜈 of a
laser oscillating in a single mode under steady state is determined by spontaneous emission and can
be shown to be given by:
𝛿𝜈 = 4𝜋hp𝜈0(Δ𝜈)

where q is the power in the oscillating field, hp is Planck’s constant, Δ𝜈 is the half-width of the reso￾nance at half maximum intensity, 𝜈0 is the oscillation frequency, and 𝛿𝜈 is the minimum oscillating
linewidth.
Equation (1.74) indicates that an increase in the laser power results in a decrease in the theoretical
linewidth. This is because an increase in power is due to an increase in the ratio of stimulated to
spontaneous emissions.

Monochromaticity is important in laser processing, because it affects beam focusing.
A monochromatic beam can be more sharply focused than a beam with a broad bandwidth.
This may not be significant in laser welding or heat treatment, but it is important in laser cutting or
microfabrication.
1.7.3 Beam Coherence
Coherence refers to a fixed-phase relationship between two waves or between two points of the same
wave (Figure 1.36a). It is both space (spatial)- and time (temporal)-dependent and is important for
interference-based measurements.
Spatial coherence is where the phase difference between two points on a wavefront of an electro￾magnetic field remains constant with time (Figure 1.36a,b). Temporal coherence, on the other hand,
is where the phase difference between the wavefront of an electromagnetic field at a given point P at
a time t and that at the same point P and time t+𝜏0 remains constant with time. The electromagnetic
wave is then temporally coherent over the period 𝜏0. This is illustrated in Figure 1.36b, which shows
an electromagnetic wave whose phase changes at intervals of 𝜏0. Even though a beam may have both
spatial and temporal coherence, the two do not necessarily coexist. For clarity, an incoherent beam
is illustrated in Figure 1.36c.
1.7.3.1 Spatial Coherence The concept of spatial coherence is best understood using Young’s
experiment. A light source S is placed in front of a narrow slit A0 contained in a screen A. We set
up a coordinate system as shown in Figure 1.37, with origin O at the center of the slit.
A second screen B containing two parallel and narrow slits B1 and B2 is placed at a distance x1
from A such that the y-axis is exactly halfway between the two slits B1 and B2 which are parallel❦

to the y-axis and are located at a distance ±zb from the x-axis. A third screen C is now placed at a
distance x2 from B such that the x-axis passes through it at D. The three screens are all parallel to
the y–z plane.
It can be shown that light from the origin O and passing through the slits B1 and B2 will reinforce
each other if the path difference, l, at D′
(x1 +x2, z) is an integer number of wavelengths:
l = 2zzb
x2
= m𝜆 (1.76)
and they will nullify each other if the path difference is an integer number of wavelengths and a half:
l = 2zzb
x2
= (m + 1∕2)𝜆 (1.77)
Thus, as D′ varies with distance from D, the light intensity will show alternate bright and dark
fringes. From Eq. (1.76), the position of the mth bright fringe can be obtained as:
z(m) = mx2𝜆

m = 0, ±1, ±2, … (1.78)❦

The spacing between contiguous fringes will be

2zb
(1.79)
If now another slit is placed in screen A which is parallel to the one at O and located at O′
, a
distance ds from O and is very close to O, then the fringes formed by O′ will be such that there
will be a bright fringe in the neighborhood of D. If the distance ds is now gradually increased by
moving O′ in the positive z direction, its fringes will shift relative to those due to O. At some critical
separation dc, the dark fringes of O′ will be superimposed on the bright fringes of O, eliminating the
entire interference fringe pattern on the screen. dc can be shown to be given by:
dc = x1𝜆
4zb
(1.80)
If O and O′ are considered to be part of a relatively wide single slit of width ds, then it can be said
that good fringes will be obtained if
ds ≪ x1𝜆
zb
⇒ zb ≪ x1𝜆
ds
(1.81)
Thus, for a wide enough slit, no fringes will be observed for an ordinary light source, and this is
because the waves emitted from different parts of the source are incoherent. A laser beam, on the
other hand, will produce interference fringes even for a wide slit since it has high spatial coherence,
and thus light from any two points on the beam can interfere.
1.7.3.2 Temporal Coherence The concept of temporal coherence is also best explained using the
Michelson interferometer, (Figure 1.38). A parallel beam of near-monochromatic light from a source
S is split into two using a beam splitter A, such that part of the beam is reflected and the other part
transmitted. Each of the two beams is reflected back from a plane mirror. One of the mirrors, M1, is
fixed, while the other, M2, is movable along the direction of the beam. Each of the reflected beams
is again partly reflected and partly transmitted at A such that they are both directed onto a detector
at B where they are superimposed to form interference fringes. If the distance from A to M1 is the❦

same as that from A to M2, then the optical path difference between the reflected beams is zero.
Good interference fringes are then observed at B. On gradually moving the mirror M2 away from
A, the interference fringes become less and less distinct, until they completely disappear when the
optical path difference is a few centimeters (Figure 1.39).
The reduction in fringe visibility with increasing optical path difference is due to the fact that the
light waves generated by the source are not of an infinitely long duration, but rather a series of wave
trains of average duration say, 𝜏ct. The phases of the individual wave trains are random. Despite the
randomness of the wave trains, a light source appears continuously bright because the wave trains
are being constantly produced and superimposed on each other.
The duration of a wave train, 𝜏ct, is referred to as the coherence time, and its length c𝜏ct is the
coherence length. The finite duration or length of the wave trains of an ordinary light source is the rea￾son why the fringes produced by the Michelson interferometer reduce in quality as the optical path
difference between the two beams increases. When the optical path difference is less than the coher￾ence length, then light waves are being superimposed which were essentially split from the same
wave train and are thus in phase. Good interference fringes are obtained between light waves which
are coherent. When the optical path difference is greater than the coherence length, then different
light waves are being superimposed which were generated at times separated by an interval greater
than the coherence time and are thus uncorrelated.

42 LASER BACKGROUND
The linewidth Δ𝜈0 associated with a light wave having a coherence time of 𝜏ct can be shown to
be given by:
Δ𝜈0 = 1
𝜏ct
(1.82)
The linewidth associated with the emission from an ordinary source with a coherence time
of about 𝜏ct = 10−10 s will thus be 1010 Hz. On the other hand, the oscillating linewidth for a
high-quality stable gas laser may be as small as 500 Hz. The corresponding coherence time and
length are 2 × 10−3 s and 6 × 105 m (600 km), respectively. Thus, the interference properties of a
laser are very good and can be used for producing interference fringes even when the optical path
difference is large.
1.7.4 Intensity and Brightness
The brightness of a power source at a point is defined as the power emitted per unit surface area per
unit solid angle (angular cone). Brightness is a basic characteristic of the source radiation and cannot
be increased. The brightness of different light sources may be more easily compared by specifying
the brightness temperature, TB, which is defined as that temperature at which a blackbody would
emit the same radiant flux as the given body and may be expressed as:
TB = q
kBΔ𝜈0
(1.83)
where q is the power of the source, Δ𝜈0 is the linewidth, and kB is Boltzmann’s constant.
For a 1 W laser of linewidth of 1 MHz, the corresponding brightness temperature is of the order
of 1019 K. For comparison, we note that the brightness temperature of an incandescent lamp is about
104 K.

SUMMARY 43
where fl is the lens focal length, 𝑤0 is the beam radius at the lens, and 𝜃 is the angular aperture of
the lens, or the angle subtended by the lens at the focus.
The minimum spot diameter, dmin, that can be obtained at the focal point is given by:
dmin = 2𝑤min = 1.22𝜆
NA ≈ 𝜆 (1.85)
where NA = n sin(𝜃/2) is the numerical aperture, and n is the refractive index of the medium in
which the lens is working.
For traditional welding and cutting applications, the beam diameter at the focal point is about
250 μm. However, with appropriate optics, this can be reduced to the order of the beam’s wavelength.
For a general mode distribution, the radius at the focus may be expressed as:
𝑤f = Km
1
𝜋

𝑤0
(1.86)
where Km represents the energy mode distribution. A typical value for Km would be 1.
It is evident from Eq. (1.84) that the smaller the wavelength of the laser beam, the smaller the
focused beam size, and thus the greater the power density produced by a beam of given power. As a
result, for a given beam power and mode, the power density produced with an Nd:YAG laser will be
two orders of magnitude greater than that produced using a CO2 laser.
1.8 SUMMARY
A laser is a form of electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths ranging from X-ray to infrared radi￾ation. It is the result of energy emission associated with the transition of an electron from a higher to
a lower energy level within an atom. This starts with excitation of an atom or molecule to a higher
energy state as it absorbs a photon. When the excited atom is stimulated by a photon, it also releases
another photon as it undergoes a transition to the lower state. This results in stimulated emission,
where the incident and emitted photons have the same characteristics and are in phase, resulting in a
high degree of coherence. Otherwise, the photon is released spontaneously. Under thermal equilib￾rium conditions, the distribution of atoms at the various energy levels is given by Boltzmann’s law.
Laser action is achieved by placing the active medium between two mirrors to form the resonator.
Simple resonator forms include the planar, confocal, and concentric resonators. The major mode
forms that are sustained in a resonator are the longitudinal (axial) and transverse modes. Contiguous
longitudinal modes only differ in their field distribution along the longitudinal axis, while transverse
mode field distributions differ in the transverse direction. Undesirable modes can be suppressed using
mode selection methods. Higher-order transverse modes may be suppressed by placing a diaphragm
in the cavity. Longitudinal mode selection methods include cavity length variation.
Pumping is the process by which atoms are raised from a lower to a higher energy level through
stimulated absorption. This is done to achieve population inversion. Two common forms of pumping
are optical and electrical pumping.
Optical pumping can be done using either lamp-based or diode laser-based systems. Arc and
flashlamps are normally used with solid-state or liquid lasers, since the lamp output usually has a
broad bandwidth. Configurations that are used when pumping with diode lasers are longitudinal
(end) and transverse (side) pumping. Electrical pumping is normally done using radio frequency or
direct current systems and is more commonly used with gas and semiconductor lasers.
Population inversion is difficult to achieve in a two-level system by pumping. It is easier for a
three-level system, where the lifetime for transition from level 3 to level 2 must be smaller than❦
❦ ❦
❦
44 LASER BACKGROUND
the lifetime for transition from level 2 to level 1. For a four-level system, population inversion can
be achieved when the lifetime for transition from level 1 to level 0 is smaller than the lifetime for
transition from level 2 to level 1. Thus, level 2 is essentially in a metastable state, while levels 3 and
1 have relatively short lifetimes.
Even though lasers are generally considered to be monochromatic, in reality, the transition
frequency is not exactly monochromatic, but it is spread over a finite frequency range. The two major
categories of line-broadening are homogeneous and inhomogeneous broadening. Under homoge￾neous broadening, we have natural and collision broadening. Natural broadening is associated with
the finite lifetime of the excited state as a result of spontaneous emission. Collision broadening
results primarily from collision between atoms and is therefore more predominant in gaseous media.
In homogeneous broadening, the mechanism has the same effect on each atom, and thus the
response of each atom is broadened in an identical manner. The entire system is thus broadened in
the same way. Inhomogeneous mechanisms include Doppler broadening, which is a result of the
Doppler effect.
The Q-factor, Qf, of a laser cavity is a measure of the losses or energy dissipation in any mode of
the laser cavity. A cavity with a high Q-factor has low losses and thus has a smaller linewidth.
Q-switching is a technique that is used to produce pulsed laser outputs of higher power but shorter
duration. It involves using a shutter to control the Q-factor by preventing oscillation in the cavity until
a high population inversion is achieved, at which time the shutter is opened, resulting in an intense
beam of short duration being released. Q-switching can be achieved using mechanical, electro-optic,
acousto-optic, or dye (passive) shutters.
Pulses with higher peak powers and shorter duration than can be obtained by Q-switching are
achieved through mode locking. This is achieved by combining a number of distinct longitudinal
modes of a laser in phase. Mode locking is achieved using electro-optic or acousto-optic shutters.
The divergence of a laser beam is proportional to the beam wavelength and inversely proportional
to the diameter of the aperture from which the beam is emerging. Whereas ordinary light is uniformly
radiated in all directions, the divergence of a laser beam may be as low as 0.05∘. The size of a focused
beam is proportional to the wavelength of the incident beam and inversely proportional to the size
of the beam that is incident on the lens.

2 Types of Lasers
There are various types of lasers. Each one has different characteristics, which depend on the active
medium used for laser action. In this chapter, we first discuss the major types of lasers, based pri￾marily on the active medium. In addition, we also discuss recent developments in laser technology,
especially with regard to industrial lasers, specifically those used for materials processing. The prin￾cipal laser categories include the following:
1. Solid-state lasers.
2. Gas lasers.
3. Semiconductor (diode) lasers.
4. Liquid dye lasers.
In the following sections, we shall provide highlights on the solid-state, gas, and semiconductor
lasers, since they are more widely used for industrial applications.
Even though semiconductor lasers are also based on solid material, they are considered separately
since the pumping and lasing mechanisms are different. In each category, a number of lasers have
been developed using different active media. The different laser types will be discussed in this chapter
in the order listed, in the following sections. The basic concepts related to each general type will
be discussed using one or two examples for illustration. The basic characteristics of some major
industrial lasers are summarized in Appendix 2.B, and the wavelength ranges of common lasers are
summarized in Appendix 2.C.
The notations used to represent the electron configurations in other laser texts are usually complex.
In this book, we use an unconventional but very simple representation, which starts with the letter E
with a subscript that designates the energy level, for example, Ex, indicating energy level x.
In addition to the major laser categories, we shall discuss new developments in industrial laser
technology. Ultrafast (utrashort pulse or femtosecond), slab, disk, and fiber lasers are considered
separately under this category. Ultrafast lasers (which are also based on solid-state laser technology)
use special techniques, in addition to mode locking, to achieve the ultrashort pulse duration. Slab and
disk lasers are also given special consideration, even though they both use solid-state active media.
Slab lasers can also use gas active media and may be optically or electrically pumped. Finally, fiber
lasers are also based on solid-state laser technology and can generate ultrashort pulse outputs.
2.1 SOLID-STATE LASERS
Solid-state lasers normally use an insulating crystal or glass as the host lattice. The active medium
is embedded in the host material as either a dopant or impurity. The dopant is normally a transition

metal or rare-earth element and substitutes for some of the atoms in the host material, rather than
being an interstitial impurity. For the solid-state lasers that we consider under this section, the active
medium is shaped either in the form of a rod or a slab. We use the rod form as illustration in most
of our discussion. The slab configuration will be discussed at the end of this section. The rod is
normally cylindrical in shape, with ends which are ground and polished to be plane and parallel. Its
dimensions depend on the active medium being used. The ends of the rod may either be silvered
(one completely and the other partially), in which case the rod constitutes the optical cavity; or the
rod may be placed between two external mirrors. Pumping is commonly done using a flashlamp,
and the configuration involves either a cylindrical cavity with elliptical cross section, or a helical
flashtube. The rod temperature may be controlled by circulating air or liquid around it. Otherwise,
the heat generated can change the cavity dimensions and consequently, the cavity modes.
Most solid-state lasers generate pulsed beams, even though some generate continuous-wave (CW)
outputs. Their coherence lengths are thus relatively short, making them unsuitable for a number of
interference-based applications. However, the significant amount of energy available in each pulse
makes them attractive to applications that require such energy bursts. These include resistor trim￾ming, initiation of thermonuclear fusion, and spectroscopic research. Common types of solid-state
lasers include the Nd:YAG and Nd:Glass lasers. These are further discussed in the following sub￾sections. The ruby laser was the first laser to be successfully made and operated. However, since it
is not extensively used anymore, it is not further discussed.
Neodymium (Nd) lasers have either a crystal or glass material as the host lattice, and this is
doped with neodymium ions, Nd3+, that constitute the active medium. The energy levels are thus
those of the neodymium ions, as illustrated in Figure 2.1. These are four-level lasers. The ground
level (level 0) is the E0 energy level. Again, the pump level (level 3) has two bands, with E3a having
a mean wavelength of 0.73 μm, while E3b has a mean wavelength of 0.8 μm. The upper lasing level
(level 2) is E2 with a lifetime of about 0.23 ms, and from there, transition occurs to the lower lasing
level (level 1), E1. This transition is primarily homogeneously broadened with a full width at half
maximum (FWHM) of about 195 GHz, and a transition wavelength of 1.06 μm in the infrared range.
Atoms are pumped from level 0 to level 3, from which they undergo rapid non-radiative decay to
level 2 which is a metastable state. The energy difference between level 1 and the ground state, level
0, is such that hp𝜈 ≫ kBT at room temperature, and thus, transition from level 1 to level 0 is very fast,
occurring by non-radiative processes so that level 1 is practically empty under thermal equilibrium
conditions. Any atoms that make a transition to level 2 then essentially result in a population inver￾sion. There is a variety of host materials that are used for neodymium lasers, but the most common
ones are yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG) and glass.

GAS LASERS 57
2.1.1 The Nd:YAG Laser
The host lattice for this laser is a crystal of YAG with the chemical composition Y3Al5 O12, where the
Nd3+ ions (about 0.1 to 2%) substitute for some of the Y3+ ions. Operation of the Nd:YAG laser can
be either in the CW or pulsed mode, depending on whether pumping is continuous or intermittent.
A xenon flashlamp may be used at medium pressure (500–1500 Torr) or a krypton lamp at high
pressure (4–6 atm), and the rod size ranges from 0.5 to 1.0 cm in diameter and from 5 to 20 cm in
length. The power output in CW mode varies from 150 W to 6 kW, and that in Q-switched pulsed
mode is of the order of 50 MW with a pulse duration of about 20 ps, at a repetition rate of 1–100 Hz.
The high-power (up to 2 kW) CW laser may be achieved by having three Nd:YAG rods in line as
a single oscillator, with each rod being arc lamp-pumped. The very high powers (up to 6 kW) are
obtained by pumping with a diode laser, Figures 1.23 and 1.24. The efficiency of both pulsed and
CW Nd:YAG lasers typically ranges between 1 and 3%. Applications of Nd:YAG lasers include laser
surgery and materials processing, for example, welding, cutting, drilling, and surface modification.
2.1.2 The Nd:Glass Laser
The host lattice for the Nd:Glass laser is glass such as silicate, phosphate, or fluoride glass, with
1–5% Nd3+. It has the advantage that the rod size can be much larger (up to 1 m in length and
about 50 mm in diameter) than that for Nd:YAG, since glass can be easily made with high quality or
optical homogeneity (free of residual stresses) to large sizes because of its lower melting temperature.
With power output per unit volume being comparable to that of Nd:YAG, relatively larger power
outputs can be obtained with this type of laser. Since glass has an amorphous structure, it has short
range order. Thus, the environment and therefore the field of each ion are different from that of any
other ion. This variation of ion environments in the glass matrix results in additional inhomogeneous
broadening, and thus a much broader bandwidth. The Nd:glass laser therefore normally operates in
multimode. Very short pulse periods, of the order of 5 ps, with high output powers, can thus be
obtained when the output is mode-locked.
One major disadvantage of Nd:glass lasers is the low thermal conductivity of glass, which is
about an order of magnitude smaller than that of Nd:YAG. This limits their usefulness for CW oper￾ation, and are thus only used for low-rate-pulsed outputs, with a typical output pulse rate of 1 Hz.
The relatively high peak pulse outputs (up to 20 TW) of Nd:glass lasers enable them to be used in
laser-induced nuclear fusion reactions. However, the low pulse rates limit their applicability in man￾ufacturing to such operations as drilling and spot welding, and in the cases where they are acceptable,
are able to produce superior quality holes at depth-to-diameter ratios up to 50:1, much higher than
what can be achieved with the Nd:YAG laser.
2.2 GAS LASERS
Gas lasers are among the most common form in the laser industry. The power levels range from
several kilowatts (carbon dioxide (CO2) lasers) to milliwatts (helium-neon (He-Ne) lasers). They
can be operated either in the continuous mode or pulsed mode, with output frequencies ranging
from ultraviolet to infrared.
As the name implies, gas lasers use a gaseous material as the active medium. The broadening
mechanisms in gas lasers are not as strong as those in solids. Thus, the resulting linewidths, deter￾mined primarily by Doppler broadening, are relatively small. This is because collision broadening
is relatively small due to the low pressures normally used in gas lasers. As a result, the energy levels
are relatively narrow, and thus a sharp emission line is essential for excitation. Optical pumping,
with its broad emission spectrum, is therefore not suitable for pumping gas lasers, since it would❦

result in inefficient pumping. Electrical pumping is thus the most common means of exciting the
active medium in gas lasers. Pumping is also done by chemical means, with an electron beam, or by
gas-dynamic expansion.
When classified by the active medium, one can identify four principal types of gas lasers:
1. Neutral atom lasers.
2. Ion lasers.
3. Metal vapor lasers.
4. Molecular lasers.
2.2.1 Neutral Atom Lasers
The most common example of neutral atom lasers (using inert gases as the active medium) is the
He-Ne laser, which was also the first laser to generate CW output. The active medium in this case
consists of one part neon to 10 parts helium. This is a four-level laser, and Figure 2.2 illustrates the
energy level schemes of He and Ne. The helium atoms are more easily or efficiently excited to the
higher levels by electron collision than are neon atoms. Thus, the electrons that are accelerated by
the passage of a discharge through the mixture excite the helium atoms to the metastable higher
energy levels denoted by HE3a and HE3b. These energy levels of helium happen to coincide with
some of the excited states of neon, the NE3a and NE3b levels. The excited helium atoms are thus able
to transfer energy to neon atoms which are in the ground state when collision takes place between
the two. This results in de-excitation of the helium atoms involved to the ground state, while the
neon atoms are excited to the higher energy level. This process of energy transfer through collision
is referred to as resonant collision or resonant energy transfer and is so called because the corre￾sponding energy levels coincide. The process increases the population of the NE3a and NE3b levels
of neon relative to the lower NE2a and NE2b levels, resulting in a population inversion between the
two sets of levels.
Lasing action occurs between energy levels of the neon atoms. The role of helium is thus to assist
in the pumping process. The metastable state of the excited helium atoms (staying at the high level
for a relatively long time) makes the energy transfer process more efficient. The decay time of the

upper lasing levels of neon (about 100 ns) is about an order of magnitude greater than that of the
lower lasing levels (about 10 ns), thereby satisfying a necessary condition for CW operation.
The principal or strongest transitions are shown in Figure 2.2, with transition at wavelengths
of 0.633, 1.15, and 3.39 μm. The last two wavelengths fall in the infrared region, while the first
one results in the red light and is the most common mode in which the laser is used. The desired
wavelengths can be selected using techniques discussed in Section 1.2.2.
After transition, the atoms in the lower lasing level relax spontaneously to the NE1 level which is
metastable. Thus, if the temperature of the neon gas is high enough, electrons from the NE1 state may
jump back to the NE2a and NE2b levels (Boltzman’s law). This phenomenon is known as radiation
trapping and will cause the population inversion between the upper lasing level and the NE2a and
NE2b levels to decrease, resulting in quenching.
The three main factors which affect radiation trapping and the population inversion of He-Ne
lasers are as follows: current density; total and partial gas pressures of He and Ne; and diameter of
the discharge tube. With a higher current density in the discharge tube, the temperature of the gas
becomes higher. Therefore, there is an optimum current density that provides maximum pumping
power without quenching laser action.
The gas pressures of He and Ne influence the population of the NE1 state. If the population of the
NE1 state is increased due to a pressure change, the chances of radiation trapping are increased. The
optimum pressures have been found to be about 1 mm Hg (1 Torr) for helium and about 0.1 mm Hg
for neon. Finally, in order to reduce the population of the NE1 level and thus reduce the chances for
radiation trapping, the NE1 neon atoms must collide with the discharge tube walls to de-energize.
If the inner diameter of the discharge tube wall is too large, there will be less chance of collisions
with the wall. Thus, the tube wall must be made small enough to ensure a high-enough probability
of wall collisions. In practice, tube diameters range from about 1–6 mm. Beyond that range, the
output power is reduced, because the population inversion is lessened due to a fewer number of wall
collisions by atoms in the NE1 state.
Figure 2.3 is a schematic of the He-Ne laser. The discharge tube is typically 20–80 cm in length.
At the ends are the mirrors, which may be either internal (sealed inside the discharge tube) or exter￾nal to the sealed tube (Figure 2.3). The internal system has the disadvantage that it needs to be
replaced periodically due to erosion by the discharge. On the other hand, with the external system,
the windows at the ends of the tube reflect part of the beam away, resulting in losses. This problem
is mitigated by positioning the windows at the Brewster angle, 𝜃B (Section 3.3), which is given by:
tan 𝜃B = n (2.1)
where n is the refractive index of the window material.

60 TYPES OF LASERS
The output beam of the He-Ne laser has a bandwidth of about 1.6 GHz due primarily to Doppler
broadening. Thus, there may be several axial modes operating simultaneously. A single-axial-mode
operation can be obtained by reducing the cavity length to about 10–15 cm.
The outputs of He-Ne lasers typically range from 0.5 to 50 mW, with an input power requirement
of 5–10 W. The overall efficiency is thus of the order of 0.02%.
Common applications for He-Ne lasers include position sensing, character or bar code reading,
alignment, displacement measurement by interferometry, holography, and video disk memories.
2.2.2 Ion Lasers
Ion gas lasers are generally four-level lasers, and the active medium is an ionized inert gas, with a
typical operating pressure of about 1 Torr. There are a variety of ion lasers, including argon, kryp￾ton, xenon, and mercury ion lasers. These have essentially the same design. We shall use the argon
laser for illustration. The energy level scheme of the argon ion (Ar+) laser is shown in Figure 2.4.
Excitation to the higher laser level, E3, can occur in three ways:
1. Through collision of (Ar+) ions in their ground state with electrons.
2. Through collision of (Ar+) ions in the metastable state with electrons.
3. Through radiative cascading from higher levels (to the E3 level).
Laser transition occurs between the E3 (higher) and E2 (lower) levels, with the lifetime of the
E3 level being about 10−8 s which is an order of magnitude greater than that of the E2 level (about
10−9 s), thereby satisfying the condition for CW operation.
Unfortunately, the pumping process involves two stages instead of one. In the first stage, the neu￾tral atom is ionized by colliding with an electron in the discharge tube. The ion may then be excited
to a higher energy level by another collision with an electron, in the second stage. Since pumping
requires two stages, the pumping process, and therefore the ion laser in general, is inefficient. The
efficiency is approximately 0.1%. Current densities of around 1000 A/cm2 are therefore required to
maintain the threshold population inversion in ion lasers.

In addition to raising the temperature of the discharge tube, the high current density causes the ions
to migrate toward the cathode. Since the ions have a lower mobility than electrons, there is a tendency
for the ions to accumulate at the cathode. This might result in the discharge being extinguished
due to a loss of active medium. To prevent this from happening, a return path is provided between
the anode and the cathode (Figure 2.5). The return tube is made longer than the discharge tube to
prevent the discharge from passing through the return tube (path of least resistance). Overall, the
two-stage pumping scheme of ion lasers significantly complicates their design and restricts their
performance.
Output of the Ar+ ion laser occurs at a number of wavelengths, with the strongest being the
0.4881 μm (blue) and 0.515 μm (green) wavelengths. Power outputs typically range from about 1 to
over 20 W CW but can also be lower than 1 W. Ar+ ion lasers are used in laser printers, in surgery,
for pumping dye lasers, and in spectroscopy. Other ion lasers include the krypton (Kr+) ion laser
with an output wavelength of 0.6471 μm and a CW output of 5–6 mW, and the xenon (Xe+) ion
laser with an output wavelength of 0.5395–0.995 μm, and a pulsed peak power output of about
200 W.
2.2.3 Molecular Gas Lasers
Unlike the neutral atom and ion gas lasers, molecular gas lasers derive their transitional energy from
a molecule. The overall energy of a molecule is composed of four principal components:
1. Electronic energy, which results from electron motion about each nucleus.
2. Vibrational energy, which results from vibration of the constituent atoms about an equilibrium
position.
3. Rotational energy, which results from rotation of the molecule about an axis.
4. Translational energy, which results from linear or curvilinear motion of the molecule.
Each electronic energy level (Figure 2.6a) consists of a number of vibrational levels (Figure 2.6b),
and each vibrational level in turn consists of a number of rotational levels (Figure 2.6c). In Figure 2.6,
E1 refers to the ground level, and E2 refers to the first excited state for the case where the atoms of the
molecule are held fixed at a nuclear separation distance. The electronic, vibrational, and rotational
energies are quantized, and transitions between the various levels can produce laser oscillations.
Translational energy, on the other hand, is not quantized and is thus not useful for laser oscillations.❦

There are three common transitions associated with the quantized energies. These are normally used
to categorize the lasers as:
1. Vibrational-rotational.
2. Vibronic (vibrational-electronic).
3. Pure rotational.
A fourth type of molecular laser, which falls in a category of its own, is the excimer laser. In the
following sections, we shall discuss the vibrational-rotational and excimer lasers, since these are
more easily produced commercially. Since laser action is relatively difficult to achieve in rotational
lasers, these are not further discussed.
2.2.3.1 Vibrational-Rotational Lasers In vibrational-rotational lasers, oscillations result from
transitions between vibrational levels (rotational level of one vibrational state and the rotational level
of another vibrational state) of a given electronic state, normally the ground state. The wavelength
of the output beam ranges from 5 to 300 μm (middle to far-infrared).
The CO2 laser is the most common example. It has the advantage of relatively high efficiencies,
about 10–30%. Common applications of the CO2 laser include materials processing, communica￾tions, spectroscopy, and surgery.
Figure 2.7 shows the following three fundamental vibration modes of the CO2 molecule:
1. Asymmetric stretching.
2. Bending.
3. Symmetric stretching.
The energy level or oscillation behavior of the system is described using the number of energy
quanta in each vibrational mode. For example, (pqr) indicates that there are p quanta in the symmetric
mode, q quanta in the bending mode, and r quanta in the asymmetric mode.
The active medium for the CO2 laser is a mixture of CO2, N2, and He. The CO2 molecule provides
the transitions that generate the laser beam. N2 helps to increase the population of the upper lasing❦

The energy level scheme of the electronic ground state for this type of laser is shown in Figure 2.8.

Collision between electrons accelerated in the discharge and the CO2 molecules result in the
molecules being excited preferentially to the (001) energy level. This process can be represented as:
e− + CO2(000) −→ e− + CO2(001) (2.2)
With resonant energy transfer, electron collision with an N2 molecule first results in the latter
being excited from the ground level (0) to the upper level (1). This is a very efficient process, and❦

since the upper level is metastable and has about the same energy level as the (001) level of CO2,
resonant transfer of energy can occur easily between the (1) level of N2 and the (001) level of the
CO2 molecule. Finally, higher excited levels (00r) of CO2 decay rapidly to the metastable (001) state.
As a result of these various processes, pumping of the (001) level is very efficient, contributing to
the relatively high efficiency (up to 30%) of the CO2 laser.
The upper lasing level is (001), and the lower levels are (100) and (020). Transition between the
(001) and (100) levels results in oscillation at the wavelength 10.6 μm, while that between the (001)
and (020) results in oscillation at the wavelength 9.6 μm, with the transition at 10.6 μm having a much
greater likelihood (about 20 times) of occurring than the 9.6 μm transition. The 10.6 μm output is
thus more common. Frequency selection techniques can be used to suppress the 10.6 μm output if
the 9.6 μm output is desired.
In reality, each of the vibrational levels mentioned, say (001), is composed of several rotational
levels which have a population distribution given by the Boltzmann distribution. Only the rotational
level with highest gain oscillates, since the thermalization rate of the rotational levels (about 107 s−1
(mm Hg)−1) is much greater than the rate at which the population of the oscillating rotational level
decreases. Thermalization refers to redistribution of the population of various levels to achieve equi￾librium or steady-state distribution.
The lifetimes of the various levels are influenced by the partial pressures of the gas mixture. For
a typical mixture with partial pressures of 1.5 mm Hg for CO2, 1.5 mm Hg for N2, and 12 mm Hg
for He, the lifetime of the upper lasing level is about 0.4 ms. The energy difference between the
lower lasing levels, (100) and (020), is very small, much less than kBT, and thus the (100) → (020)
decay is very fast. Likewise, the (100) → (010) and (020) → (010) decays are very fast. Thermal
equilibrium is thus reached between the three levels (100), (020), and (010) in a relatively short
period. As a result, if the decay from the (010) level to the ground state (000) is not fast enough,
then there would be an accumulation of atoms in all three lower levels since they are in thermal
equilibrium. This would lead to a quenching of population inversion. The decay of the (010) level to
the ground state is accelerated or enhanced by the presence of He in the gas mixture. For the partial
pressures mentioned, the corresponding lifetime of the (010), (100), and (020) levels is about 20 μs,
therefore satisfying the condition for laser oscillation.
The presence of He in the mixture serves yet another purpose. To prevent repopulation of the
(010) level and thus lower lasing levels by thermal excitation, the energy difference between (010)
and the ground state has to be much greater than kBT. This occurs if the temperature of the CO2 gas
is kept relatively low. Since He has a high thermal conductivity, it can conduct heat away to the tube
walls effectively, thereby keeping the CO2 gas at a low temperature.
There are various designs for CO2 lasers, including the following:
1. Sealed tube lasers.
2. Axial (longitudinal) flow lasers.
3. Transverse flow lasers.
4. Transversely excited atmospheric (TEA) lasers.
5. Gas-dynamic lasers.
Others are diffusion-cooled lasers and capillary waveguide lasers. We shall only discuss the first
three designs since they are more commonly used as industrial lasers.
Sealed Tube Lasers In sealed tube lasers, the gas mixture or active medium is contained in an
enclosed chamber (the discharge tube). Therefore, there is no fresh supply of gases or active medium❦

to the laser. In the case of CO2 lasers, dissociation products that are undesirable for laser operation
may form in the tube. For example, carbon monoxide (CO) forms from CO2:
2CO2 −→ 2CO + O2 (2.3)
The formation of carbon monoxide is undesirable in CO2 lasers, because it absorbs light at
10.6 μm. Thus, if a large amount of dissociation products exist within the discharge tube, the laser
may be quenched. To prevent quenching, a catalyst is used to regenerate CO2 from CO. There are a
number of ways this can be done:
1. A small amount (about 1%) of water vapor (H2O) is added to the gas mixture.
2. A Ni cathode that is heated to about 300∘C is used as the catalyst.
With these catalysts, the laser can be used for over 10,000 hours. Typical output powers for sealed
tube lasers are about 60 W/m. The output beam of the sealed tube CO2 laser normally operates in
the low-order mode. Therefore, it has been used in microsurgery and micromachining where the
high accuracy of the low-order mode beam is essential. Machining applications include drilling and
cutting of thin metal sheets (about 0.5–1.5 mm in steels) and nonmetals.
Axial Flow Lasers Figure 2.9 shows the configuration of a typical axial flow CO2 laser, where the
gas mixture is made to flow continuously through the tube. Continuous flow of the gas mixture is used
to enable the dissociation products of the discharge, especially CO, to be removed, thereby preventing
contamination. The cavity mirrors can be either internal or external. For the external system, the
windows at each end are configured at the Brewster angle. The tube walls are water-cooled to remove
heat that is dissipated in the discharge. The pressure of the gas in the tube is kept around 15 mm Hg.
Broadening of the output laser is then primarily due to Doppler broadening, with a linewidth of
about 50 MHz, even though collision broadening is also significant. Because of the relatively small
linewidth, the system can easily be operated in a single longitudinal mode by confining the cavity
length to less than 1 m. For mechanical and thermal stability, the tube is mounted in an invar rod
frame to reduce expansion during operation. There are two types of axial flow lasers:
1. Slow axial flow lasers.
2. Fast axial flow lasers.
slow axial flow lasers In this type of laser, the gas mixture flows at a relatively slow speed
(about 20 L/min), with the prime objective of removing the dissociation products. Heat is removed

by conduction from the tube center to the walls. The output power is typically about 50–60 W/m,
or 50–500 W overall, and does not depend on the tube diameter, which is about 25 mm. The higher
output powers are obtained by increasing the optical path length of the beam in the resonator, using
folding mirrors to redirect the beam along different paths (Figure 2.10). The lower power levels are
used in laser surgery, while the higher powers are more appropriate for scribing, resistor trimming,
welding of thin sheets, and cutting nonmetals.
fast axial flow lasers The output power of axial flow lasers is limited by the heat generation
within the laser, and the manner in which it is extracted. Since the efficiency of the laser is up to
30%, over 70% of the energy input is dissipated as heat which, in slow axial flow lasers, is removed
by diffusion from the tube center to the walls. Removal of the dissipated heat can be made more
efficient by flowing the gas mixture through the tube at much higher speeds of about 300–500 m/s to
carry away the heat by convection. The gas is then recycled through a heat exchanger. This enables
the power to be greatly increased to about 600 W/m, or 500 W to 6 kW in overall power output,
and units as large as 20 kW have been built. This is a fast axial flow laser. Axial flow lasers are
extensively used in materials processing, for example, welding and cutting. They tend to have better
beam characteristics than transverse flow lasers described in the following section.
Transverse Flow Lasers In transverse flow lasers, the gas flow, electrical discharge or current flow,
and resonator axis are mutually perpendicular to one another (Figure 2.11). This is because the
heat generated within the discharge tube can be more efficiently extracted by flowing the gas at a
rate of about 60 m/s in a direction normal to the resonator axis. This results in a reduced operating
temperature, and under such circumstances, the laser can be operated at higher pressures. But the
output power for CO2 lasers increases with the pressure. Thus, for a given discharge current density,
higher output powers are achieved by increasing the total pressure from 15 to 100 mm Hg. However,
the electric field required to maintain the discharge at the higher pressures also increases to very high
levels of about 500 kV/m. For standard axial flow lasers of cavity length 1 m or more, the amount
of voltage required would be impractical. To circumvent this, the discharge is applied normal to the
resonator axis so that the distance between the electrodes is as small as possible, of the order of
10 mm. This is also sometimes referred to as a transversely excited (TE) laser.
There are two principal ways in which the discharge is sustained in transverse flow lasers.
1. The discharge is said to be self-sustained when the gas is ionized by the discharge. To initiate
the discharge, a high electric field needs to be applied. However, the electric field necessary❦

to maintain the discharge is relatively low due to the short distance between the electrodes,
but the current is quite high. The output power is about 600 W/m or up to 9 kW overall power.
The beam is often folded or reflected back and forth a number of times between the mirrors to
increase the power output (Figure 2.10).
2. The non-self-sustained discharge involves the use of an electron beam to ionize the gas, such
that the excitation voltage that is applied is just optimum for attaining population inversion,
but itself not adequate for sustaining the discharge. Power outputs obtained with this mode of
excitation may be about 10 kW/m or up to 15 kW overall power.
The high powers attainable from transverse flow lasers make them highly suitable for materials
processing applications such as welding, surface heat treatment, and cladding.
2.2.3.2 Excimer Lasers Excimer lasers are based on the transition of an excited diatomic
molecule to a lower energy state where it dissociates into single atoms. The potential energy of a
diatomic molecule (dimer), M2, depends on the separation distance, r, between the nuclei centers
of the individual atoms, and is of the form shown in Figure 2.12a. The overall curve is the resultant
of repulsive and attractive energy curves. The resultant curve, that is, the potential energy well, has
a minimum, Q0, which occurs at the equilibrium separation distance, r0, between the atoms. Thus,
each electronic energy level has a potential energy well, as shown in Figure 2.12b.
In some molecules, the ground-state potential energy curve does not have a minimum and con￾sists only of the repulsive component, whereas the excited state does have a minimum (Figure 2.12c).
Since the ground state does not have an equilibrium separation, the molecule does not exist in this
state, as the constituent atoms repel each other in this state. However, the individual atoms, M, may
exist in the ground state. On the other hand, since the excited state of the molecule does have a mini￾mum in the energy curve, the molecule can exist in the excited state M2
*. A molecule that exists under
such conditions is referred to as an excimer (excited dimer). Common examples are the noble gases
(Ar2
*, Kr2
*, Xe2
*) or their oxides, (for example, ArO*), or halides (for example, ArF*). The noble
gas halide excimer lasers tend to have better beam properties than the pure noble gas excimer lasers.
For such a material, the excimer corresponds to the upper lasing level, while the free atoms
represent the lower lasing level. Transition occurs between different electronic states. Thus, when
the molecule undergoes a transition from the upper (excimer state) to the lower lasing level❦

(ground state), it dissociates into individual atoms. As a result, the ground state of the molecule is
always empty, making it easier to achieve population inversion. The transition is broadband since
there are no well-defined vibrational-rotational transitions. The resulting output laser beam is thus
tunable over a range of wavelengths.
Pumping may involve subjecting the noble gas to a pressure of about 10 atm and using an electron
beam or an electrical discharge to excite it to the higher level, where the atoms combine to form the
excited M2
* excimer. For the Xe2
* excimer, transition occurs at a wavelength of 0.172 μm with a
linewidth of Δ𝜆 = 0.015 μm, over which the laser beam is tunable, while the output wavelength of
the Ar2
* excimer laser is about 0.125 μm. The noble gas halide excimer lasers also generate beams
in the ultraviolet range. Examples include ArF, 0.193 μm; KrF, 0.248 μm; XeCl, 0.308 μm; and XeF,
0.351 μm. The linewidth of the ArF excimer laser is about Δ𝜆 = 500 pm. This can be reduced to
about Δ𝜆 = 1 pm using wavelength dispersive optical elements in the laser cavity.
The output beam is normally pulsed with a pulse duration of about 10 ns, average output power of
up to 200 W, and a pulse rate of up to 1 kHz. The efficiency of the laser is about 1%. Excimer lasers
are useful in applications such as isotope separation where the ultraviolet output is very useful.
Generally, excimer lasers are useful for removal processes such as photochemical reactions, or more
specifically, photoablation, and are typically used for polymers, ceramics, and glass. One application
involves making holes in the nozzles of ink jet components for printers. Other applications include
wire stripping and burr removal. In recent years, they have also been gaining increasing importance
in materials processing.
2.3 SEMICONDUCTOR (DIODE) LASERS
Semiconductor (diode) lasers are based on the generation of photons when electrons in the conduc￾tion band of a semiconductor material recombine with holes in its valence band. The discussion in
this section starts with a background on semiconductor materials in general. This is followed by the
basic principles of semiconductor lasers, and finally the different types of semiconductor lasers.
2.3.1 Semiconductor Background
As discussed previously in Section 1.1.1, electrons in an atom can only occupy specific quantum
states, and the distribution of electrons in the atom depends on the temperature. In semiconductors,
it is more appropriate to consider the energy levels of the entire solid rather than individual atoms.
This is because the available energy levels for electrons in these solids can be grouped into two
broadbands, where the energy levels within each band are so closely spaced that they essentially
overlap. These are the following:
1. The valence band where the energy levels are almost completely filled by electrons such that
the electrons are not freely mobile in the solid.
2. The conduction band where the energy levels are either empty or partially occupied by elec￾trons which are able to move freely within the solid (Figure 2.13).
The energy separation between these two bands is referred to as the bandgap or forbidden band
and cannot be occupied by electrons in the solid.
The energy levels in the valence and conduction bands are described by Fermi–Dirac statistics
where the probability, p(E), of occupation of an energy level is given by:
p(E) = 1

where E is the energy level of interest, Fe is energy of the Fermi level, kB is Boltzmann’s constant,
and T is absolute temperature.
The Fermi energy defines the energy level where the probability that an electron will be in that
state is 0.5. From this equation, it is found that at absolute zero:
p(E) = {
0 for E > Fe
1 for E < Fe
(2.5)
At absolute zero temperature, the electrons occupy the lowest possible energy levels allowed,
with all lower energy levels being completely filled before the next level is occupied. Under these
conditions, the valence band is completely occupied while the conduction band is empty, and the
boundary between them is the Fermi energy level. The material is then an insulator (Figure 2.13a).
This is because conduction of current results from flow of electrons from one level in a band to
another level in the band, when the material is subjected to an electric field. With the valence band
being completely occupied, then the electron has no place to go since all levels that it could occupy
are already filled, and the energy required to cross the forbidden gap, Eg, and reach the conduction
band is much greater than the available thermal energy, that is, Eg ≫ kBT. On the other hand, in good
electrical conductors such as metals, either the conduction band is filled to some extent or there is
an overlap between it and the valence band (Figure 2.13b). There are then empty levels available for
electrons to move into when the material is subjected to a voltage source. The material is classified
as a semiconductor if the forbidden gap is small enough that electrons can be thermally excited from
the valence to the conduction band, that is, Eg ≈ kBT (Figure 2.13c). The material’s conductivity
then lies in between that of a good conductor and an insulator.
When an electron is raised from the valence band into the conduction band, a hole is created in
the valence band (Figure 2.14). This has essentially the same characteristics as an electron, except
that it has a positive charge. The hole also moves when subjected to an electric field. In fact, when a
voltage is applied to the material, holes will flow toward the negative terminal, while electrons flow
toward the positive terminal.
A pure semiconductor which contains no impurities is referred to as an intrinsic semiconductor.
Such a semiconductor has an equal number of conduction electrons and holes, since the holes are❦

created by the excitation of electrons to the conduction band. The number of holes in the valence
band, and electrons in the conduction band (which are available for electrical conduction), increases
with temperature, since the occupation of higher energy levels increases with temperature, according
to Boltzmann’s law. Thus, the conductivity of such materials increases with temperature (the opposite
is true of metals). Examples of such class of materials are silicon and germanium, which are group
IV elements of the periodic table, and each has four electrons in the outermost orbits of their atoms.
Each atom shares its four outermost electrons with four other surrounding atoms to form covalent
bonds (Figure 2.15), and since each bond involves two electrons, the outermost shell now has eight
electrons altogether and is thus completely filled. It thus behaves as an insulator at absolute zero,
with the conductivity increasing with temperature.
If now a group V element, say arsenic, which has five valence electrons, is added in small amounts
as impurities to the germanium solid (a process called doping), four of its electrons will form stable
bonds with the surrounding germanium atoms leaving the fifth atom not tightly bound and thus
essentially free and mobile in the solid (Figure 2.16a). When a semiconductor is doped in this manner,
it is said to be n-type, where the “n” indicates negative since there is an excess of electrons available
for conduction. Arsenic is then a donor element. On the other hand, if the original solid is doped
with a group III element, say gallium, which has three valence electrons, then there is a deficiency
in bonding electrons, resulting in the creation of holes (Figure 2.16b). The resulting semiconductor
is said to be p-type. The gallium atom is then an acceptor atom. It essentially takes an electron from
the valence band, leaving holes behind.❦

2.3.2 Semiconductor Lasers
To understand the principle of operation of a semiconductor laser, first consider an intrinsic semi￾conductor at absolute zero temperature (Figure 2.17a), where the valence band (Vb) is completely
filled (indicated by the shaded region). If electrons are now excited from the valence band into the
conduction band (Cb), by say, pumping, these electrons rapidly drop down to the lowest states in
the conduction band with a lifetime of about 0.1 ps. Likewise, the electrons in the valence band are
also redistributed to fill the lowest levels that are empty, resulting in holes being created at the top
of the valence band (Figure 2.17b). Under these circumstances, the semiconductor as a whole is
not in thermal equilibrium, even though the redistribution process results in localized equilibrium
in each band. Within each band, there is a quasi-Fermi level that separates the fully occupied and
empty levels in that band. These are indicated by Fc and Fv for the conduction and valence bands,
respectively, and their values depend on the number of electrons pumped to the conduction band.
When the semiconductor as a whole is in equilibrium, Fc = Fv.
With the bottom of the conduction band being occupied by electrons while the top of the valence
band contains holes, a population inversion then exists between the conduction and valence bands
(Figure 2.17b). When the electrons in the conduction band drop down into the valence band and

recombine with the holes, either a photon (light wave) or a phonon (thermal wave) will be emitted
depending on the material. In materials such as silicon and germanium where the radiation is emitted
in the form of heat (phonons), no laser action can be obtained. Laser action can be achieved in
materials like gallium arsenide (GaAs) where the radiation is in the form of light (photons).
The probability of occupation of any energy level, E, of each band is (for the conduction band,
pc(E))

(and for the valence band, pv(E))

During pumping from energy level Ev in the valence band to energy level Ec in the conduction band,
the rate of absorption depends on the following:
1. The density of incident radiation, e(𝜈).
2. The transition coefficient, B.
3. The probability that the valence band energy level is occupied, pv(Ev).
4. The probability that the conduction band energy level is empty, 1 − pc(Ec).
It is therefore given by:
dN1
dt = kcBpv(Ev)[1 − pc(Ec)]e(𝑣) (2.8)
where kc is a constant. Likewise, the rate of stimulated emission is given by:
dN2
dt = kcBpc(Ec)[1 − pv(Ev)]e(𝑣) (2.9)
Here, N1 and N2 are the number of photons absorbed and emitted, respectively.
Laser amplification will prevail only when dN2
dt > dN1
dt , that is,
pc(Ec)[1 − pv(Ev)] > pv(Ev)[1 − pc(Ec)] (2.10)
Substituting for pc(E) and pv(E) from Eqs. (2.6) and (2.7) gives
Fc − Fv > Ec − Ev = hP𝜈 (2.11)
where 𝜈 is the emitted photon frequency, while Ec and Ev are the upper and lower laser levels,
corresponding to energy levels in the conduction and valence bands, respectively.
When an electron undergoes a transition from an energy level Ec in the conduction band to an
energy level Ev in the valence band, the energy associated with the transition is also greater than the
energy gap, Eg. Thus,
Fc − Fv > hp𝜈 = hpc

for a diode are shown in Figure 2.19. The energy levels of the conduction and valence bands are
different on the two sides of the junction, with those for the n-type being at a lower level than
those for the p-type (Figure 2.19a). Population inversion is achieved if the diode is heavily doped
with acceptors and donors. Under such circumstances, the Fermi level Fn for the n-type lies in the
conduction band, while that for the p-type Fp lies in the valence band (Figure 2.19a). A portion of
the conduction band in the n-type region is then occupied by electrons up to Fn, and in the p-type
region, holes are added by the acceptors down to Fp.
When there is no voltage applied across the junction, excess electrons flow from the n-type to the
p-type, setting up an electric field that opposes and thus stops the flow. The Fermi levels on the two
sides of the junction, Fn and Fp, are then at the same level or have the same energy (Figure 2.19a).❦

If the junction is reverse biased by connecting the n-type portion of the junction to a positive
electrode and the p-type portion to a negative electrode, the electrons flow toward the anode while
the holes flow toward the cathode, until there are no more free electrons available. Current flow then
stops. On the other hand, if the positive electrode is connected to the p-type side while the negative
electrode is connected to the n-type side, forward biasing (Figures 2.18 and 2.19b), electrons flow
into the junction as they move toward the anode. At the junction, they may recombine with holes,
which are attracted in the opposite direction, to generate radiation. Current flow continues as the
n-type region is supplied with more electrons, while more holes are created in the p-type side (as
it is depleted of electrons) by the voltage source. This is the basic principle of a diode, conducting
current in one direction, and preventing current flow in the other direction.
The flow of current due to forward biasing injects electrons from the conduction band of the
n-type and holes from the valence band of the p-type materials into a narrow region in the immediate
neighborhood of the p–n junction, called the depletion layer, which is only about 0.1 μm in thickness.
That results in the creation of a population inversion in that region. Recombination of electrons and
holes in this region generates radiation of energy equal to the bandgap energy. The recombination is
equivalent to the de-excitation of an electron from the conduction band to the valence band. If the
resulting emission is not stimulated, then the device is a light-emitting diode (LED). If, however,
the applied current is high enough to exceed a certain threshold value, then a population inversion
is achieved which results in stimulated emission and laser action. Above the threshold current, the
beam intensity increases rapidly with increasing current and becomes more monochromatic, and its
divergence is significantly reduced.
Normally, laser oscillation involves using two mirrors to form a cavity. In semiconductor lasers,
this is achieved by cleavage of the material along natural crystalline planes to obtain highly reflect￾ing and parallel surfaces at two ends of the crystal which are also perpendicular to the junction.
The other two surfaces are left rough to suppress oscillation in undesired directions. Furthermore,
since semiconductors have a very high index of refraction, about 3.6, the inherent reflectivity at the
crystal–air interface is very high, about 35%, making it unnecessary to use reflecting coatings.
Semiconductor lasers have the advantage of being relatively small in size and easy to fabricate
by mass production, thereby being low cost. Typical dimensions are 1 mm × 1 mm × 200 μm, with
the thickness of the active region, where most of the oscillation is concentrated, being about 1 μm
(Figure 2.20). However, due to diffraction, the beam itself is much wider, about 40 μm, extending

away from the interface into the p and n regions. The extension of the beam into the regions away
from the interface results in high cavity losses, since absorption is much greater than emission as one
moves away from the interface. These losses result in high threshold current densities being required
for laser oscillation.
The threshold current increases with temperature, and this is because pv(Ev)[1−pc(Ec)] increases,
and pc(Ec)[1−pv(Ev)] decreases as temperature increases, and from Eq. (2.11), that means the oscil￾lation gain decreases with increasing temperature. The relatively narrow width of the beam, about
40 μm, as it comes out of the optical cavity, results in high beam divergence, compared to other
lasers, as it is diffracted at the cavity aperture. This may range from 5 to 15∘. Also, since transi￾tion occurs between two broadbands, its monochromaticity is not as good as in other lasers. The
direct conversion of electrical energy into optical energy, however, results in very high efficiencies
for semiconductor lasers, up to about 50%. The output wavelengths range from 0.7 to 30 μm in the
infrared region. Semiconductor lasers are particularly suited to optical fiber communications.
2.3.3 Semiconductor Laser Types
There are several forms of semiconductor lasers. These include the following:
1. Homojunction lasers.
2. Heterojunction lasers.
3. Quantum well lasers.
4. Separate confinement heterostructure lasers.
5. Distributed feedback lasers.
6. Vertical cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs).
In the following sections, we shall provide highlights of the first three types that are listed earlier.
2.3.3.1 Homojunction Lasers Homojunction lasers are made out of a single semiconductor mate￾rial such as GaAs. In such lasers, the high concentration of electrons and holes in the active region
increases the refractive index of the material in that region. This results in the emitted light being
internally reflected and thus confined to that region. However, the amount that is lost out of the
region is significant enough to require high threshold current densities for oscillation. For example,
the threshold current density at room temperature for GaAs is about 105 Amps/cm2. Thus, homo￾junction lasers require cryogenic temperature environment for CW operation. At room temperatures,
they can only be operated in pulsed mode. At liquid nitrogen temperature of about 77 K, the GaAs
laser can be operated under CW conditions. The output wavelength at room temperature is about
0.9 μm, decreasing to 0.84 μm at 77 K, and can thus be tuned by varying the temperature.
2.3.3.2 Heterojunction Lasers Heterojunction lasers are made out of two or more materials. This
significantly reduces the threshold current density to the extent that for some material combinations,
CW operation can be achieved at room temperature. This is because the different materials used
have different refractive indices and bandgaps. These differences cause radiation generated in the
junction region to be reflected back into the region, resulting in higher efficiency. The difference in
bandgap results in the carriers being confined to the junction region, and this reduces the threshold
current density.
Heterojunction lasers can be one of two forms:
1. Single heterojunction.
2. Double heterojunction.❦

Figure 2.21 Schematic of a double heterojunction laser.
In a single heterojunction, the junction is formed between a p-type AlxGa1−xAs semiconductor
and an n-type GaAs semiconductor, where x is a fraction. A typical double heterojunction has an
active region of p-type GaAs which is a thin layer of about 0.1–0.5 μm, sandwiched between an
n-type and a p-type AlxGa1−xAs semiconductor (Figure 2.21). There are thus two junctions between
different materials. This reduces the threshold current density to about 103 Amps/cm2, enabling room
temperature CW operation to be achieved. This is due to a number of reasons:
(1) The difference in refractive indices of the materials (being about 3.4 for AlxGa1−xAs and about
3.6 for GaAs) confines the laser to the GaAs active region where there is high gain, thereby
reducing losses due to absorption.
(2) The energy gap in the AlxGa1−xAs semiconductor is greater than that in the GaAs semicon￾ductor. This acts as an energy barrier that reflects both holes and electrons back into the active
region where they are confined, increasing their concentration and thus, gain in that region.
Since the output wavelength depends on the fraction x of Al in the semiconductor, the oscillation
wavelength can be tuned by varying x. Peak pulse powers of 10 to 20 W can be obtained at room
temperature with a pulse repetition rate of about 104 Hz, and a pulse duration of the order of a
picosecond. Output powers of 5–100 mW can be achieved at room temperature under CW operation,
but 5–10 mW is typical.
2.3.3.3 Quantum Well Lasers If the potential energy well of Figure 2.12a becomes so narrow
that it confines the motion of electrons or holes to two dimensions (planar motion), then we have a
quantum well. Confining motion to one dimension results in a quantum wire, and a quantum dot is
obtained when motion is restricted in all three dimensions. The structure of the quantum well laser
is similar to the heterojunction laser as illustrated in Figure 2.21, except that with the quantum well❦
❦ ❦
❦
78 TYPES OF LASERS
laser, the middle layer is made thin enough to confine electron motion in this region to two dimen￾sions. This improves the efficiency of the laser. Further improvements in efficiency can be obtained
with further restrictions in motion to produce a quantum wire, and further yet, a quantum dot.
2.3.4 Low-Power Diode Lasers
The CW power output of diode lasers is comparable to that of He-Ne lasers. Thus, the two types
of lasers are competitive in the 5–10 mW power range. Semiconductor lasers are much smaller,
and their power requirements are lower (due to the higher efficiency), compared to He-Ne lasers.
On the other hand, the output beam quality is much better for He-Ne lasers. Also, the 0.6328 μm
output of He-Ne lasers is more sensitive to the human eye. However, they are more expensive than
semiconductor lasers.
There have been significant improvements in the output powers of diode lasers in recent years.
This is achieved by using stacks of diode lasers. In the next section, we present a brief background
on high-power diode lasers.
2.3.5 High-Power Diode Lasers
The basic unit of high-power diode lasers is an individual diode laser with an output power of up to
100 mW (Figure 2.20). The power that is necessary for materials processing is acquired by combining
the individual diode lasers in a linear setup to form an array. A number of arrays are further combined
to form a laser bar of approximate dimensions 10 mm × 0.6 mm × 0.1 mm, and which is mounted on
a heat sink or cooling device (Figure 2.22a). The output power of each bar is about 30 to 50 W. The
individual bars are then stacked one on top of the other to form the laser diode stack (Figure 2.22b).
The number of bars used determines the overall power output of the stack. Combining stacks enables
output powers of up to 5 kW to be achieved.

The lifetime of the laser diode stack is influenced by its operating temperature. More efficient
operation is achieved at lower temperatures. Different methods have been developed for cooling the
stack. One involves forcing a coolant through micro-channels etched into a silicon manifold layer,
with each channel being approximately 25 μm in width and 150 μm in depth. Others involve the use
of micro-fins or porous materials.
The beam from a diode laser is strongly divergent in the direction of the diode junction. Beam
shaping therefore generally starts with collimating the beam in that direction. As an example, the
divergence angle of an InGaAs-based diode laser along the fast axis is about 45–60∘, while that along
the slow axis is about 12∘. Microlenses may be mounted directly in front of the diodes to collimate the
fast axis and reduce the divergence angle in that direction to about 0.6∘. Since the emitting aperture
of the laser is rather large, about 10 × 15 mm2, and the divergence differs in different directions,
cylindrical lenses are necessary to collimate the slow-axis divergence, before using an ordinary lens
to focus it down to about 8.56 × 0.62 mm2 (Figure 2.23), which would be desirable for heat treatment.
The advantages of high-power diode lasers compared to the conventional CO2 and Nd:YAG lasers
include the following:
• Compact size.
• High efficiency (over 30%).
• Almost maintenance-free operation.
• Fiber optic beam guiding capability.
• Higher absorption at metallic surfaces.
The disadvantages include the following:
• Low power.
• Poor beam quality.
2.3.6 Applications of High-Power Diode Lasers
Early applications of diode lasers were limited to pumping of solid-state lasers, where the diode
laser substitutes for the lamp. This increases efficiency, beam quality, lifetime, and reliability of the
solid-state laser. Other applications in materials processing were in areas such as surface treatment,
soldering small components, and welding plastics. With increased output powers of up to about 5 kW,
diode lasers have also found application in laser welding but are mainly limited to conduction mode
welding of thin sheets due to the relatively low-power densities of up to 3–4 × 105 W/cm2.
A class of high-power diode lasers (with output powers in the hundreds of watts) are effective for
welding high reflectivity metals such as copper. These have been termed “blue lasers” for the visible❦
❦ ❦
❦
80 TYPES OF LASERS
wavelength radiation that they generate. In using infrared lasers to weld the high reflectivity metals,
a high initial power intensity is necessary to initiate the keyhole, since the absorption at the infrared
wavelengths is low (Figure 8.5). Once the keyhole is initiated and absorption dramatically increases,
it becomes necessary to control the power and/or speed to prevent spatter and/or porosity formation.
However, absorption of visible wavelength radiation by copper is much higher than for infrared
radiation (Figure 8.5). Thus, with the blue laser, the high initial power is not required, reducing the
risk of spatter and porosity formation. The process window is also broadened.
One example blue laser might deliver 150 W of 0.450 μm beam through a 200 μm diameter optical
fiber. Another might be a 500 W beam that generates a 1.4 MW/cm2 power density, resulting in 500
μm penetration in copper at a speed of about 20 mm/s.
Since the output of the diode laser is usually either rectangular or square in shape, special optics
are required to transform the beam from the linear emission characteristics of the laser bars to a
round (or square) shape for coupling into an optical fiber.
2.4 NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN INDUSTRIAL LASER TECHNOLOGY
There have been significant advances in laser technology in recent years. In this section, we discuss
the principal developments in laser technology that are useful for materials processing. We focus, in
no particular order, on:
1. Slab lasers.
2. Disk lasers.
3. Ultrafast lasers.
4. Fiber lasers.
2.4.1 Slab Lasers
The active medium for solid-state lasers is traditionally shaped in the form of a cylindrical rod, with
pumping and cooling occurring in the radial direction, while the beam propagates axially. However,
with this configuration, a radial temperature gradient is induced in the rod. This leads to thermal
focussing effects that cause the beam to be distorted at high laser power levels. This makes it difficult
to obtain a low-order mode of operation or high beam quality at such power levels. This phenomenon
is referred to as thermal lensing.
The use of a slab geometry for the active medium enables the beam quality to be significantly
improved. The slab configuration is shown schematically in Figure 2.24. Both pumping and cooling

occur in a direction normal to the flat faces of the slab and is thus one-dimensional, resulting in
only one-dimensional temperature gradient. The beam is subjected to total internal reflection, thus
encountering the entire array of temperature variation in the medium. This minimizes thermal lensing
effects and improves beam quality.
Slab lasers can have either solid-state or gas active media, and Figure 2.25 illustrates a CO2 slab
laser. Here, the active medium is excited using two parallel rf electrodes, which are water-cooled.
The system is thus said to be diffusion-cooled. As a result, the conventional gas circulation systems
involving roots blowers or turbines are not required.
2.4.2 Disk Lasers
Disk lasers are also solid-state lasers and were developed to circumvent essentially the same prob￾lems for which slab lasers were developed – thermal lensing at high-power levels. The principle of
the disk laser is illustrated in Figure 2.26. The active medium, which is shaped in the form of a thin

82 TYPES OF LASERS
disk, is pumped using a diode laser. Parabolic mirrors are used to direct the diode laser output to one
face of the disk. Excess heat that is generated in the disk is removed by a heat sink that is attached
to the other face of the disk, resulting in efficient cooling. Since the resulting thermal gradients are
parallel to the laser beam axis, the thermal lensing effect is minimized. Beam quality is thus signif￾icantly improved and is about four times better than that of a comparable diode-pumped rod laser.
For example, a beam quality of M2 <1.5 can be obtained at a laser power of about 1 kW. Output
powers of 6 kW per disk have been achieved, and multi-kilowatt output in excess of 20 kW can be
obtained by connecting disks in series.
The higher beam quality enables a smaller focused beam size to be achieved. This results in a
much higher power density, which enables higher processing speeds to be achieved. For example,
cutting speeds of about 60 m/min have been achieved in cutting 0.2 mm-thick aluminum sheets.
Welding speeds of over 50 m/min have also been achieved in 0.2 mm-thick stainless steel sheets.
Advantages of the thin disk laser system may thus be summarized as:
1. Reduced thermal lensing effect.
2. More efficient cooling of the laser.
3. High beam quality, and thus high-power density.
4. Higher laser efficiency.
2.4.3 Ultrafast (Femtosecond) Lasers
The laser systems discussed thus far are capable of generating either CW or pulsed beams with pulse
duration of up to hundreds of picosecond duration by either Q-switching or mode locking. Shorter
laser pulses of pulse duration down to femtoseconds are obtained using ultrafast (or ultrashort pulse)
lasers. These enable much higher peak intensities to be obtained. For example, a peak intensity of
1015 W/cm2 can be obtained from a 100 fs (10−13 s) laser pulse with a pulse energy of 0.33 mJ when
focused to a 20 μm diameter. To achieve the same peak intensity with a 10 ns laser pulse, the energy
content would have to be 100 J.
Different methods have been developed for generating ultrashort pulse beams. In this section, we
discuss one of the basic principles, chirped-pulse amplification (CPA). The spectrum of a laser beam
is inversely proportional to its pulse duration. Thus, a laser gain medium with a broad, continuous
emission spectrum is necessary for generating an ultrashort pulse. The emission spectrum of tradi￾tional media such as CO2 and Nd:YAG is such that they cannot support pulse duration down to the
femtosecond range. Nd:YAG lasers, for example, can only generate pulse duration down to 30 ps.
Typical materials that are used as active media for ultrafast lasers include Ti:sapphire (6 fs), Nd:glass
(100 fs), Yb:glass, Yb:YAG, Cr:YAG, and dyes.
The generation of ultrashort pulses starts with mode locking. This generally results in a pulse
repetition rate of about 100 MHz, with a pulse energy of the order of nanojoules. For a number of
applications, it is necessary to amplify the pulse to the microjoule and millijoule range. However,
due to the high intensity of the pulses, they cannot be directly amplified, since this would damage the
optical components. The technique of CPA is one approach that is used to overcome this limitation.
The CPA principle is illustrated in Figure 2.27. The peak power of the pulse generated by the oscil￾lator is first reduced by stretching the pulse duration by a factor of 103 to 104 to make it longer. The
stretched pulse is then amplified and then finally recompressed back to its short pulse state using a
compressor. To avoid damage to the compressor, the laser beam diameter is expanded before being
sent to the compressor.
Pulse stretching is normally achieved using a pair of optical gratings which are not parallel, or by
using optical fibers. For pulses of relatively narrow bandwidths, a fiber optic cable is used. This first❦

broadens the pulse bandwidth by about 50 times and then stretches the widened pulse, usually about
3 to 5 times. Optical gratings are used for pulses that have large bandwidths. The principle of the
latter stretching process is illustrated in Figure 2.28a. The width of a pulse that has a broadband
spectrum is changed as a result of the dispersive properties of the gratings. In the original pulse,
all the frequency components travel together. However, the gratings disperse the different frequency
components into different directions, with each one having a different optical path length. And since
the frequency component with the shorter optical path length emerges earlier than the one with the
longer optical path length, the pulse becomes stretched in time.
For compression, the gratings are arranged to be parallel (Figure 2.28b). The separation between
the gratings determines the amount of compression that is achieved.

84 TYPES OF LASERS
A typical ultrafast laser may have a Ti:sapphire active medium operating in a wavelength range
of extreme ultraviolet to mid-infrared with a pulse duration of less than 10 fs and generates peak
pulses of the order of terawatts at a pulse repetition rate of 1 MHz, resulting in an average power
over 100 W.
Some applications of ultrafast lasers are discussed in Sections 9.3.1 (Micromachining) and 14.2
(Nanotechnology Applications).
2.4.4 Fiber Lasers
As the name implies, a fiber laser uses an optical fiber (Section 3.7.2) with a core that is doped with
a rare-earth element as the active medium. It may therefore be considered as a form of solid-state
laser. Fiber lasers were first produced in the mid 1960s, with output powers of the order of milliwatts
at a wavelength of about 1 μm at that time. Current versions have output wavelengths ranging from
ultraviolet through mid-infrared, with CW output powers up to 100 kW.
The basic structure consists of a single-mode or multimode core which contains the doping ele￾ment and is surrounded by an undoped outer core (also known as inner cladding) (Figure 2.29).
This is further surrounded by an outer cladding of even lower refractive index (double-cladding).

NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN INDUSTRIAL LASER TECHNOLOGY 85
The core diameter is of the order of 40 μm, while the inner cladding is about 1 mm in diameter. The
fiber can be as long as 10 m.
The challenge in achieving high beam quality (single mode) with high output power is one of
increasing the core radius without having the higher-order modes propagating. However, as can be
deduced from Eq. (3.22), for a given normalized frequency which results in single-mode operation,
a larger core radius can be obtained only by decreasing the numerical aperture (NA). However, this
is constrained by current fabrication technology, which limits the NA value to approximately 0.06,
corresponding to a maximum core diameter of approximately 15 μm in the 1 μm wavelength range.
One common approach is to induce bending losses, which are more significant for the higher-order
modes than the fundamental mode, by proper coiling of the fiber.
In the simplest case, the doped optical fiber core, with the ends cleaved and butted with dielectric
mirrors (multiple thin layers of different transparent optical materials), constitutes the laser cavity.
In practice, however, fiber Bragg gratings are used for the end mirrors, since these are easier to mass
produce. The gratings are designed to reflect light in a specific wavelength range and allow all other
wavelengths through.
In a fiber Bragg grating, stripes are introduced into a section of the glass such that the effective
refractive index in that region is varied (periodically or aperiodically). Whenever the light crosses
the boundary between two sections of the material with different refractive indices, a small portion
is reflected back. Thus with a sufficient number of stripes, the grating can be an efficient mirror.
Common elements used for doping include erbium (Er), holmium (Ho), neodymium (Nd),
thulium (Tm), and ytterbium (Yb). Neodymium and ytterbium are used extensively for high-power
applications, with Yb resulting in the most efficient and powerful laser. The host medium is
usually silica. The laser output wavelengths corresponding to the various active media are shown in
Table 2.1, together with the normal pump wavelengths. The difference between the pump and output
wavelengths is referred to as the quantum defect, and that determines the excess heat produced by
the laser. Since the difference between the two is small for fiber lasers, the quantum defect heating
and resulting thermal load are relatively low. That is especially the case with Yb lasers and is one
of the reasons for the high beam quality and high efficiency of fiber lasers.
2.4.4.1 Pumping Pumping of the fiber laser is normally done optically, using a diode laser, either
longitudinally (end pumping) or transversely (side pumping). In either case, the source may be a
single diode, an array, or several individual diodes. Since the diode laser output is low brightness
(low quality), launching it directly into the fiber core is difficult. It is therefore launched into the inner
cladding (pump core) (Figure 2.30), which has a much larger cross-sectional area (about 100–1000
times that of the core). Thus, higher power diode lasers can be used for pumping. The pumping beam
is internally reflected repeatedly, and part of it is absorbed each time it crosses the fiber core. This
absorption mechanism, and the long length of the fiber, enables high gains to be achieved, since the
laser medium gain is given by the product of the pump light intensity and the distance over which
the pump light interacts with the active medium. The result is a high-brightness, high-power output
radiation. With side pumping, the diode output is first fed into a coupler, and at an angle to the fiber
axis (Figure 2.31).

With cylindrical double-clad fibers, the reflected light rays do not always pass through the core,
and that reduces the pumping efficiency. To ensure that all modes of the inner cladding are coupled
to the core, the optical fiber is either coiled or the cladding is made noncircular in cross section. Even
though nonsymmetric shapes such as the D-shape were initially investigated, symmetric shapes such
as octagonal or hexagonal are preferable since they are much easier to splice to another fiber, and
also to fabricate.
Transitions in fiber lasers are characteristic of quasi-three-level systems. Pumping is from a
ground state to an upper level. Laser transition occurs from the lowest part of the upper level to the
ground states. The output may be CW or pulsed.
2.4.4.2 Pulsed Output Pulsed outputs can be obtained by
1. Modulation of the pump laser to obtain long-pulse (millisecond duration) output.
2. Q-switching to generate pulses ranging from nanosecond through microsecond duration.❦

3. Mode-locking to generate pulses of the order of 100 femtosecond duration.
4. CPA (Section 2.4.3) for even shorter pulses.
Using the CPA technique, pulse peak powers in excess of 1 GW have been achieved with an
average power of about 800 W, and pulse duration can be as short as 10 femtoseconds.
High power/energy pulses in the nanosecond range have been obtained by using high-gain fiber
master oscillator power amplifiers (MOPAs) and essentially consists of a master oscillator and a
number of amplifiers connected in series (Figure 2.32). The master oscillator generates a low-power
output which is amplified sequentially to the desired power level. The drawback of this approach is
that nonlinear effects that result from the long length and small diameter of the fiber can limit the
output power produced. However, this is sometimes circumvented with the use of large mode area
(LMA) active fibers, enabling higher outputs to be obtained. The greater absorption per unit length
afforded by LMA fibers enables shorter fibers to be used.
Pulsed outputs have been obtained at wavelengths ranging from 1 to 3 μm using a variety of
techniques. These are extensively used in materials processing but have found application in other
areas such as nonlinear optics, environmental monitoring and pollution control, food quality control,
and noninvasive disease diagnosis. In materials processing, high-power (energy) pulsed nanosecond
lasers are used for laser marking and engraving in a variety of materials such as metals, plastics,
ceramics, organics, and paper. High-power ultrafast fiber lasers are used for micromachining, weld￾ing, cutting, drilling, surface texturing, and microcladding.
2.4.4.3 CW Output Single-mode fibers enable diffraction-limited output beams to be generated
but result in relatively lower output powers, while multimode fibers are able to produce much higher
output beams of relatively lower quality. The CW output power of single-mode fiber lasers is typ￾ically up to hundreds of watts and, when collimated to 5 mm diameter, can result in a full angle
divergence of about 0.13 mrad. The highest power achieved thus far for a single-mode laser with a
LMA is 10 kW. This was achieved by tandem pumping, where one or more fiber lasers are used to
pump another fiber laser. In this case, Yb-doped fiber lasers, each with an output of several hun￾dred watts, were used to pump another at 1.018 μm pump wavelength, generating an output beam
at 1.070 μm. The resulting quantum defect is smaller than 5%, which is about half what would have
been obtained with diode pumping.
Higher power levels can also be achieved by combining the output from several fiber lasers. This
process can be coherent or incoherent. For example, the outputs of 10 fiber lasers can be integrated to
produce a 1 kW output system. A 33 kW output laser has been produced by incoherently combining
the outputs of six 5.5 kW fiber lasers. Powers higher than 100 kW CW have also been achieved with
multimode fibers by double-cladding.
2.4.4.4 Power Scaling Scaling of power in fiber lasers is limited by nonlinear effects, which
depend on (proportional to) the beam intensity in the fiber core and the fiber length. One source
of nonlinear effects is third-order susceptibility. This makes the refractive index of the medium
intensity-dependent, thereby introducing a self-induced phase shift (self-phase modulation).❦
❦ ❦
❦
88 TYPES OF LASERS
Second-order effects cancel out in silica fibers, since silica is a symmetric molecule. Fortunately,
self-phase modulation effects are so low that they can be neglected in CW fiber lasers. Another
source of nonlinearity is stimulated inelastic scattering. Above a threshold radiation level, stimulated
Raman scattering (SRS) or stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) results in part of the radiation
energy being transferred to the glass host. SRS involves excitation of optical phonons, while SBS
involves excitation of acoustical phonons, and its effect is much smaller than that of SRS.
The threshold power for SRS is given by:
qRS = 16Ae
gRSLe
(2.13)
where Ae is the effective fiber mode area, Le is effective length of the fiber, and gRS is the peak Raman
gain coefficient. It is 1 × 10−13 m/W in fused silica at a pump wavelength of 1 μm.
A similar relationship exists for Brillouin scattering. Eq. (2.13) indicates that the threshold
power at which nonlinear effects become significant decreases as the fiber length or beam intensity
increases, or as the mode-field area decreases. SBS is significant enough to restrict the performance
of single-frequency fiber lasers, while for spectral bandwidths greater than 0.5 GHz, power scaling
is constrained by SRS.
2.4.4.5 Applications of Fiber Lasers The higher-quality beam associated with single-mode fibers
makes them suitable for applications such as laser cutting or transmission through the atmosphere.
On the other hand, the higher power output of multimode fibers makes them suitable for laser welding
and heat treatment, which normally require a wider beam area.
High-power Yb fiber lasers operating in the 1 μm wavelength range with CW output have become
the workhorse of the laser industry for processing metals, since this wavelength range is efficiently
absorbed by metals. Example applications include using a 2 kW fiber laser for lap-welding a
zinc-coated steel sheet of thickness 1.2 mm at 5 m/min or cutting a 4 mm-thick coated steel at
10 m/min, producing clean sharp edges. In another example, a 6 mm-thick 6056 aluminum alloy
was welded with a 6.9 kW laser at 3 m/min. Other applications include laser drilling, cladding, and
cleaning.
Significant improvements in output power are being obtained for fiber lasers operating in the
1.5, 2, and 3 μm wavelength ranges. These output wavelengths have the advantage that they are
eye-safe, since they are easily absorbed by water in the vitreous humor, and thus unable to reach the
retina where damage can be done. Thulium (Tm) and Holmium (Ho) lasers operate in the 2 μm range
and are effective for welding, drilling, and cutting nonmetals such as plastics which are transparent
around the 1 μm range but absorb radiation around 2 μm efficiently. These lasers have been effectively
used in welding plastics to metals and have also found significant use in medical applications such as
ablating urinary or canine prostate tissue, since the water in the tissues is very effective in absorbing
the 2 μm wavelength radiation. For polymers, an ultraviolet fiber laser generating 10 μJ laser pulses
at 200 kHz (2.0 W) can produce a light black bar code at a marking speed of 1 m/s on ABS plastic.
2.4.4.6 Advantages of Fiber Lasers Fiber laser advantages include the following:
1. Compact size, since the fibers can be packaged in a coiled configuration. For example, a
4 kW fiber laser’s footprint is about 0.5 m2 as compared to 11 m2 for an Nd:YAG laser that
is lamp-pumped. An 8 kW fiber laser’s dimensions may be about 1.5 × 0.8 × 1.5 m.
2. High brightness output beam, which is diffraction-limited and therefore of high quality, with
M2 value of 1 to 2 for the single-mode low-power lasers. The M2 value for high-power mul￾timode operation typically ranges between 7 and 10. The high beam quality enables a 1 kW❦

laser to be focused to a 25 μm beam radius using a lens of focal length 100 mm, while an 8 kW
beam is focused to a 300 μm beam radius using a lens of focal length 250 mm.
3. Ability to generate ultrashort pulse laser beams and/or wide tunable range, due to the broad
emission spectrum of the glass gain medium.
4. Relatively high output efficiency of about 25–50% compared to about 10–30% for CO2 and
1–3% for Nd:YAG lasers. Thus, less of the input energy is wasted. Furthermore, since the fiber
has a large surface area-to-volume ratio, any excess heat is efficiently dissipated over the long
length of the fiber. There is therefore little risk of the fiber overheating and affecting the beam
quality. The optical to optical conversion efficiency typically ranges from 60% to 70% and
can be as high as 95% for erbium. This coupled with the high efficiency of diode lasers (about
50% electrical to optical) is what results in the relatively high efficiency of fiber lasers.
5. Near-infrared wavelength of the laser enables relatively high absorptivity to be achieved in
metals.
6. Relatively lower operating costs. Costs associated with using some of the major laser types are
shown in Figure 2.33. These costs are averaged over an 8-year period and show the operating
costs for fiber lasers to be lower than for CO2, Nd:YAG, or disk lasers.
2.4.4.7 Disadvantages of Fiber Lasers Fiber laser disadvantages include the following:
1. Difficulty in aligning the pump laser output to single-mode core optical fibers.
2. Potential for fiber damage at high powers.
3. Need to use long cavity lengths, since the pump absorption per unit length is limited.
2.5 SUMMARY
In this chapter, we have discussed some of the major types of lasers, focusing on those that are either
currently used, or have the potential to be used for manufacturing applications. The discussion started
with solid-state lasers, with a focus on the Nd:YAG laser (which is four-level and is extensively used
in manufacturing applications). The Nd:YAG laser is capable of transmission using a fiber optic❦

cable and can be used in either the pulsed or CW mode, with CW power levels up to 6 kW. The
Nd:Glass laser is able to deliver higher output peak power pulses than the Nd:YAG laser. However,
it has a more limited use in manufacturing because of its inability to deliver CW output power for
any reasonable period of time.
The discussion on solid-state lasers was followed by gas lasers, where the focus was on neutral
atom (He-Ne), ion (argon ion), and molecular (CO2 and excimer) lasers. The low-power CW output
of the He-Ne laser makes it suitable for position sensing and alignment, among other applications.
The CW power output of the argon ion laser is higher than that of the He-Ne laser, but much lower
than can be obtained from the CO2 laser. The CO2 laser, which is the other laser that is extensively
used in processing, is much more efficient than the Nd:YAG laser and generates much higher CW
output powers, as well as higher beam quality. However, the longer wavelength output does not lend
itself to fiber optic cable transmission. The CO2 lasers that are most extensively used in industry are
the fast axial flow and transverse flow lasers, which produce the highest power outputs. The excimer
laser, which normally generates pulsed beams in the ultraviolet wavelength range, is beginning to
see increasing use in manufacturing.
Diode lasers constitute one of the fastest growing laser type in materials processing. Even though
the power output of an individual diode laser is relatively small, stacking of the individual lasers
enables high output powers suitable for materials processing to be achieved. The near-infrared wave￾length of the diode laser makes it suitable for transmission using fiber optic cables. The major
drawback of this type of laser is the high beam divergence, which requires special optics for col￾limating and focusing the beam. Even then, it is limited to processes that require a relatively wide
beam area, such as surface modification, and conduction mode welding.
Following diode lasers, slab lasers were discussed. These can have either solid state or gas as
the active medium. However, the pumping configuration enables higher-quality output beams to be
obtained compared to the beams generated using traditional pumping techniques. This was followed
by a discussion on disk lasers, which produce even better beam quality because of reduced thermal
lensing effects. Ultrafast lasers were then discussed. Even though these are also solid-state lasers,
they were considered separately because of the special characteristics imparted by the ultrashort
pulse duration in materials processing, enabling materials to be ablated or removed with minimal
thermal damage to the surrounding material.
Finally, fiber lasers, where the active medium is a doped optical fiber, were discussed. These have
the advantage of compactness, coupled with high beam quality, and very high output powers.

3 Beam Delivery
Beam delivery is the means by which the laser beam propagates from the generator to the target of
interest. This normally involves the use of mirrors, lenses, fiber optic cables, or any combination
of these elements. Since light is part of the electromagnetic spectrum, the manner in which the beam
propagates is determined by the characteristics of the electromagnetic spectrum. Thus, we start our
discussion in this chapter with a brief introduction to the electromagnetic spectrum. This is followed
by a brief review of the Brewster angle. Next, birefringence is discussed, followed by polarization,
expanders, and beam splitters. A general discussion on beam delivery systems then follows. Fiber
optic systems are discussed as a major component of the chapter. Finally, diffractive optics and
coherent beam combining (CBC) with optical phase array (OPA) technique (or Civan method) are
discussed as effective methods for beam shaping.
3.1 THE ELECTROMAGNETIC SPECTRUM
The electromagnetic spectrum, of which visible light is part, exhibits both wave-like and particle-like
properties. The radiations of the electromagnetic spectrum are characterized by their wavelength 𝜆
and frequency 𝜈, which are related by:
𝜈𝜆 = c (3.1a)
where c is the velocity at which electromagnetic radiation propagates in free space and is given by:
c = 1
√𝜇m0𝜀p0
≈ 3 × 108 m∕s (3.1b)
The velocity, cm, at which an electromagnetic wave propagates in any medium is given by:
cm = 1
√𝜇m𝜀p
(3.1c)
where 𝜇m0 and 𝜀p0 are the magnetic permeability and electric permittivity, respectively, in free space,
and 𝜇m and 𝜀p are those in the medium.
c and cm are related by the refractive index of the medium, n, as:
n = c
cm

√ 𝜇m𝜀p
𝜇m0𝜀p0

From Eq. (3.1a), it can be shown (Problem 3.9) that for small Δ𝜆,
Δ𝜈 = −( c
𝜆2
)
Δ𝜆 or Δ𝜆 = −( c
𝜈2
)
Δ𝜈 (3.2)
The negative sign arises since the wavelength increases as the frequency decreases. Let us
now look at some basic characteristics of electromagnetic radiation that are associated with their
propagation.
3.2 BIREFRINGENCE
Birefringence is the phenomenon whereby a light beam that is incident on a material is refracted
into two rays, the ordinary ray and the extraordinary ray. Materials that exhibit this characteristic are
said to be birefringent (optically anisotropic). The two rays are plane-polarized (see next section) in
orthogonal directions. The ordinary ray obeys Snell’s law and has the same velocity in any direc￾tion in the material. The extraordinary ray, on the other hand, has different velocities in different
directions and does not follow Snell’s law. Both the ordinary and extraordinary rays have the same
velocity along the optic axis of the material. Since the two rays generally have different velocities,
the birefringent material normally has two different refractive indices. An example of such a material
is the calcite crystal.
3.3 BREWSTER ANGLE
In Figure 1.9, the electric and magnetic vectors of the light wave are shown as lying in specific
planes. Light having this characteristic where the electric vector is restricted to a specific plane is
said to be linearly or plane-polarized. The electric vector for a plane-polarized beam is illustrated
schematically in Figure 3.1a, while that for an unpolarized beam is illustrated in Figure 3.1b.
The electric vector associated with a beam that is incident on a surface can be resolved into two
components, one parallel to the plane of incidence, p-component, and the other normal to the plane
of incidence, s-component. The intensities of the two components are equal if the original beam is
unpolarized. However, the intensities of the components of the reflected beam are not necessarily
equal and depend on the reflection coefficients for the two components of the reflected beam, which
are different. These are given by:
Rp = tan2(𝜃1 − 𝜃2)
tan2(𝜃1 + 𝜃2) (3.3a)
Rs = sin2(𝜃1 − 𝜃2)
sin2(𝜃1 + 𝜃2)
(3.3b)

BREWSTER ANGLE 97
where Rp is the reflection coefficient of the reflected ray that is plane-polarized in the plane of inci￾dence and Rs is the normal component. 𝜃1 and 𝜃2 are the respective incident and refracted angles.
Rp and Rs are the intensity or power reflection coefficients and are also known as reflectances. The
corresponding amplitude reflection coefficients are given by:
Rpa = tan(𝜃1 − 𝜃2)
tan(𝜃1 + 𝜃2) (3.4a)
Rsa = sin(𝜃1 − 𝜃2)
sin(𝜃1 + 𝜃2) (3.4b)
Variation of the reflection coefficients with the angle of incidence is shown in Figure 3.2a. From
Eq. (3.3a), we observe that when 𝜃1 +𝜃2 = 90∘, the reflection coefficient, Rp, for the p-component
in the plane of incidence is zero, since tan(𝜃1 +𝜃2) is then infinity. The reflected beam is then
plane-polarized normal to the plane of incidence (Figure 3.2b). This occurs when the reflected and
refracted rays are perpendicular to each other. The angle of incidence at which this occurs is referred
to as the polarizing angle or Brewster angle, 𝜃B. Since 𝜃1 +𝜃2 = 90∘, we have sin 𝜃2 = cos 𝜃1, and
thus from Snell’s law, we have

98 BEAM DELIVERY
When the original beam is incident from the medium with the lower refractive index, that is,
medium 1, the beam undergoes a 180∘ (or 𝜆∕2 linear) phase shift during reflection. However, there is
no phase shift if the light is incident from the higher refractive index medium.
The preceding discussion applies primarily to transparent materials such as glass. The reflection
coefficients for metals are relatively large. The reflection coefficient for the s-component increases
monotonously with increasing angle of incidence. However, that of the p-component first decreases
with increasing angle of incidence until (depending on the material and wavelength of the incident
beam), about 85∘, when it begins to increase to 100% reflection at 90∘ incidence. Except for 0∘
incidence and 90∘ incidence, the reflection coefficient for the parallel component is always lower
than that of the normal component.
3.4 POLARIZATION
In discussing polarization, we first consider a simplified one-dimensional propagation of the electric
vector of an electromagnetic plane wave:
El(x, t) = E0 cos
2𝜋
𝜆 (x − ct) = E0 cos(kwx − 𝜔t) (3.6)
where El is the magnitude of the electromagnetic wave (electric field vector), E0 is the amplitude,
kw = 2𝜋
𝜆 is the wavenumber, and 𝜔 is the angular frequency. This is illustrated schematically in
Figure 3.3a.

POLARIZATION 99
If we consider measurements that are made at a fixed position along the beam, then Eq. (3.6) can
be expressed as:
El(t) = E0 cos(𝜑 − 𝜔t) (3.7)
where 𝜙 is the phase angle of the wave at the position of interest.
Two different waves, 1 and 2, of the same frequency (Figure 3.3b) can be represented as:
El1(t) = E01 cos(𝜑1 − 𝜔t) (3.8)
and
El2(t) = E02 cos(𝜑2 − 𝜔t) (3.9)
If these two waves are plane-polarized in the same plane and are superimposed on each other,
then the resulting light vector El(t) is given by:
El(t) = El1(t) + El2(t) (3.10)
which can be shown to reduce to the form:
El(t) = E0 cos(𝜑 − 𝜔t) (3.11)
where
E2
0 = E2
01 + E2
02 + 2E01E02 cos(𝜑2 − 𝜑1) (3.12)
and
tan 𝜑 = E01 sin 𝜑1 + E02 sin 𝜑2
E01 cos 𝜑1 + E02 cos 𝜑2
(3.13)
Thus, the frequency of the resulting light vector is the same as that of the original light vectors.
However, the amplitudes and phase angles are different.
Now let us consider the situation where the two plane waves Ely(t) and Elz(t) lie in different
planes which are orthogonal to each other (Figure 3.4). The resulting light vector will then have a
magnitude of

If we go back to the original equation for the wave motion, we can show that at any moment in
time, the resultant electric vector along the x-axis or direction of propagation describes an elliptical
helix (Figure 3.5a). If we now look at a projection of this resultant vector on a plane perpendicular
to the x-axis, the equation describing the outermost trace of the projected image can be obtained by
eliminating time from Eqs. (3.8) and (3.9), giving

superimposing two beams that are plane-polarized in two orthogonal planes is said to be elliptically
polarized. The projected electric vector rotates clockwise in the projected plane as time varies, and
the resulting helix is a right circular helix if the phase difference is such that
𝜑z − 𝜑y = 2m − 1
2 𝜋 m = 0, 1, 2, 3, … (3.16)
and rotates in the counterclockwise direction, producing a left circular helix if
𝜑z − 𝜑y = 2m + 1
2 𝜋 m = 0, 1, 2, 3, … (3.17)❦

BEAM EXPANDERS 101
If E0y = E0z = E0, that is, the amplitudes of the two light vectors are equal, and the phase difference
between them is 90∘ or a quarter of a wavelength, then Eq. (3.15) becomes
Ely(t)
2 + Elz(t)
2 = E0
2 (3.18)
This is the equation of a circle. The resulting light is then said to be circularly polarized.
Plane-polarized light may be obtained by using a special optical element (plane polarizer) such
as a Polaroid sheet, or by positioning a reflector such that the light beam is incident on it at the
Brewster angle. Furthermore, if we compare Eqs. (3.3a) and (3.3b) for Rp and Rs, we find that Rs is
always greater than Rp. Thus, repeated reflections from mirrors will eventually result in light that is
plane-polarized normal to the plane of incidence.
3.5 BEAM EXPANDERS
Beam expanders are normally used for changing the size of the output beam. From Eq. (1.84), it is
evident that the size of the focused beam is inversely proportional to the original beam size:
𝑤f = 1
𝜋
fl𝜆
𝑤o
Thus, a more intensely focused beam can be obtained from a laser beam of the same power
if its diameter as it enters the focusing lens is increased. This could be achieved using a beam
expander, which essentially consists of a series of mirrors (Figure 3.6a) or lenses (Figure 3.6b).

❦ ❦
❦
102 BEAM DELIVERY
The transmissive (lens) beam expanders are mounted in such a way that they have the same focal
point (Figure 3.6b). The size of the expanded beam, 𝑤2, is given by:
𝑤2 = 𝑤1
fl2
fl1
(3.19)
where 𝑤1 is the size of the incoming beam, 𝑤2 the size of the expanded beam, fl1 the focal length of
the lens on which the original beam is incident, and fl2 the focal length of the output lens.
Increasing the beam size also has the advantage of reducing the diffraction spreading associated
with it (Section 1.7.1).
For the lens system, another configuration is based on a non-focusing arrangement. This type has
the advantage of being more compact and suitable for high-power applications where the focused
beam could present problems. The focusing arrangement, on the other hand, enables the original
beam to be focused at a pinhole where higher-order diffraction fringes are filtered or blocked out.
This results in a beam whose intensity distribution is more uniform because of the noise reduction.
3.6 BEAM SPLITTERS
Beam splitters are optical elements that are used to divide an incoming beam into two, and through
cascading, into any number of parts. One simple method is based on reflection, using a wedge-shaped
reflector (Figure 3.7), with the edge pointing directly into the laser beam path to reflect the incoming
beam into two parts. For the split beams to come out parallel, the wedge angle has to be 90∘. The
power ratio of the split beams is determined by the position of the wedge edge relative to the axis
of the incoming beam. The quality of the beams depends on the dimensional accuracy of the wedge
and smoothness of the reflector.
Another technique makes use of a partially transmissive and partially reflective optical element
(Figure 3.8). When the laser beam is incident on such a material, part of the beam is reflected, while
the remaining portion is transmitted, separating the beam into two parts. Such an optical element is
normally obtained by coating a transparent material such as a ZnSe block with a reflective material
such as inconel. The amount of coating determines the ratio of transmitted to reflected beam power.
The latter can thus be varied for a given application by using an element with a graded or varied

coating density on the surface and changing the location at which the beam is incident on the surface
of the optical element.
Other techniques for splitting laser beams are based on the principles of the Fabry–Perot inter￾ferometer or a combined linear polarizer and electro-optic cell.
3.7 BEAM DELIVERY SYSTEMS
A beam delivery system is a means for directing the laser beam from the generator to the point of
application. The two principal types are as follows:
1. Conventional beam delivery.
2. Fiber optic beam delivery.
3.7.1 Conventional Beam Delivery
Conventional beam delivery systems are conceptually simple, as shown schematically in Figure 3.9a,
typically consisting of three main components:
1. The beam bending assembly, which is usually reflective, that is, consists of mirrors.
2. The focusing assembly, which may be transmissive or reflective.
3. Interconnecting beam guard tubes.
The beam bender assembly usually contains mirrors oriented at 45∘, which reflect the unfocused
beam at right angles to the original direction. Common materials used for the mirrors include copper
or molybdenum, which may be bare or coated with silicon. The advantage of bare molybdenum
is that it is durable and easily cleaned, making it suitable for industrial applications. However, it
absorbs about 1–4% of the incident light. The coated version, on the other hand, absorbs only about
0.1% of the light, but cannot be restored by cleaning.
The lens is contained in the focusing assembly, which is normally made adjustable so that the
distance between the focal point and nozzle tip can be varied to suit the application. It also has an
inlet for shielding or cutting assist gas flow. For high-power applications, both the beam bender and❦

focusing assembly have built-in circulating systems for air or water cooling to prevent overheating
of the optics, which may cause thermal lensing or distortion of the laser beam, and thereby change
the focusing characteristics of the lens. Common lens materials include ZnSe, KCl, GaAs, and CdTe.
ZnSe is more commonly used with CO2 lasers.
A number of beam benders can be used depending on the application. The workstation is some￾times placed a distance of about 6 m or more from the output coupler to permit the beam to be fully
developed in the far-field mode and also to minimize the impact of back reflection into the laser
generator. Immediately behind the output coupler (aperture), the resulting wavefront is not planar.
This is due to diffraction effects that result from Huygen’s principle. A planar wavefront is fully
developed after a distance of about five Rayleigh ranges (Section 8.1.3).
Where necessary, a beam expander may be inserted in the beam path to provide the desired beam
size (Figure 3.9b). For high-power lasers in the infrared range, it is normal practice to provide beam
guards made from aluminum tubes for the beam along its path from the generator to the bender for❦

BEAM DELIVERY SYSTEMS 105
safety since the beam is invisible. The beam guard also serves to keep dust and other contaminants
such as oil and mist off the delivery system. Internal cleanliness is assured by flowing clean dry air
or nitrogen through the optical path in a direction away from the mirrors and lenses, at a pressure of
about 30 psi.
Fiber optic systems provide a very flexible means of beam delivery. However, currently available
systems are heavily absorbed by the longer wavelength CO2 lasers and are thus suitable primarily
for the shorter wavelength lasers, for example, the Nd:YAG laser. The basic principles of fiber optic
systems will be discussed next.
3.7.2 Fiber Optic Systems
Optical fiber systems are used in transmitting laser beams or electromagnetic energy from one loca￾tion to another. This application is quite common in optical communications where the power levels
are generally low. For materials processing, where high-power industrial lasers are typically used,
usage of optical fibers for transmitting the laser beam is limited to the shorter wavelength lasers.
The longer wavelength CO2 laser results in heating of the cable. Optical fibers are thus not used for
high-power CO2 laser beam transmission. The use of fiber optic transmission makes beam delivery
more flexible, compared to the conventional mirrors and lenses.
The basic structure of an optical fiber system is shown schematically in Figure 3.10. The principal
components include:
Transmitter: Which converts an electrical signal into an optical signal. This includes a light source.
Transmission Line: Which conducts the optical signal, and this comprises the optical fibers.
Receiver: Which converts the optical signal back to the original electrical form. The receiver
normally consists of photodetectors and signal amplifiers.
Our focus in this section will be on the transmission line since fiber optic cables are used in laser
processing primarily to transmit a beam from the source to the delivery point without any electrical
conversions. First, we look at the characteristics of optical fibers in general.
3.7.2.1 Optical Fiber Characteristics Optical fibers can be characterized on the basis of either
their physical or optical properties. On the physical side, optical fibers consist of glassy fibers of
diameter about 125 μm each, with lengths up to the order of kilometers. Inorganic oxide glasses of
high silica content are often used, and the resulting fibers are very flexible. For the optical characteris￾tics, the major limitations of optical fibers are the attenuation and bandwidth dispersion. Attenuation
results in dissipation of optical energy during transmission and is caused mainly by absorption and
scattering. The bandwidth determines the limits of frequencies that can be transmitted.
Optical fibers are normally operated in the temperature range from −55 to 125 ∘C but may extend
to −250 to 500 ∘C. Due to the dielectric nature of glass and the small size of fibers (that is, much
smaller than the wavelength of radio and microwaves), they are immune to interferences from such

signals. Thus, fibers can pass through certain regions of high electromagnetic fields without inter￾ference. Also, waveguide covers prevent interference from other optical signals.
3.7.2.2 Waveguide Structure The optical fiber waveguide is the thread-like medium through
which the light propagates. It is generally circular in section and has a long cylindrical structure.
The basic structure has two components (Figure 3.11):
Core: This is the inner portion through which light is transmitted and is made of transparent glass
(or plastic) of relatively high refractive index. Core diameters typically vary between 4 and 12 μm
for single-mode fibers (see Section Single-Mode Fibers), and between 50 and 200 μm for multimode
fibers (see Section Step-Index Multimode Fibers).
Cladding: This is the concentric outer layer with a relatively lower index of refraction. It reduces
scattering loss from discontinuities at the core surface, adds mechanical strength to the fiber, and
protects the core from absorbing surface contaminants. The cladding may also be a glass or plastic
material.
The difference in refractive indices of the core (n1) and cladding (n2) is often expressed in the
normalized form, Δ, as:
Δ = n1 − n2
n1
(3.20)
Typical values for Δ would be 0.2% for single-mode and 1% for multimode fibers. Since the
core has a higher index than the cladding, total internal reflection occurs, enabling the waves to stay
within the fiber. The optical fiber waveguide is itself contained in another coaxial layer that supports
the fiber structure.
3.7.2.3 Background Consider the simple system shown in Figure 3.12, with a core of radius, rc.
Let the light incident on the fiber end make an angle 𝜃 with the waveguide axis. If 𝜃 is less than 𝜃a, the
angle of acceptance, total internal reflection occurs because the refracted light is then incident at the
core–cladding interface at an angle greater than 𝜃c, the critical angle. The light then stays within
the core. For angles greater than 𝜃a, no internal reflection will occur and the light will propagate
into the cladding. The incident rays that propagate within the core are more commonly defined using
the numerical aperture, NA. It is a measure of the light-gathering or collecting power of an optical
fiber and is defined as:
NA = sin 𝜃a (3.21)❦

For step-index fibers, this is given by:

The amount of light that can enter and stay within the fiber increases as the numerical aperture
increases. However, the bandwidth that can be transmitted decreases as the NA increases.
Only specific quantized wave modes are propagated, and the mode volume parameter or normal￾ized frequency, 𝜈n, of the modes guided by the fiber is defined as:

3.7.2.4 Fiber Types The three most common fiber types are as follows:
1. Step-index multimode fibers.
2. Single-mode fibers.
3. Graded-index multimode fibers.
Step-Index Multimode Fibers A step-index fiber is one with a uniform core refractive index, n1,
which abruptly changes at the core–cladding interface to the refractive index of the cladding, n2
(Figure 3.11):
n1 > n2 (3.24)
The core may be silica, with a refractive index of about 1.46. The step-index multimode fiber
usually has a core cross-sectional area that is large enough for transmitting a significant amount
of energy. Thus, the normalized frequency is high enough to support a number of discrete modes,
that is,

It has the disadvantage that the low-order modes (with angle of incidence at the fiber end, 𝜃, very
small) travel a shorter ray path through the guide than do higher-order modes, that is, those with 𝜃
close to 𝜃a (Figure 3.12). This causes intermodal dispersion (Section 3.7.2.5) where rays starting
at the same time become out of phase. It restricts the fiber bandwidth or the frequency range over
which it is useful. For this and other reasons, the step-index multimode fiber is only suitable for
short-distance applications.
Single-Mode Fibers Single-mode fibers are another form of step-index fibers. However, the core
is much smaller. Also, the difference in refractive index between the core and cladding is much
smaller. As the normalized frequency, 𝜈n, is reduced, so does the number of propagated modes.
When 𝜈n <2.405, all the higher-order modes are cut off, and only the fundamental mode propagates.
This reduction in 𝜈n is achieved either by a reduction in core diameter or a reduction in the index
difference, as shown in Eq. (3.22). All modes that are incident at an angle are therefore cut off, and
propagation occurs only along the fiber axis. This eliminates intermodal dispersion. A much greater
bandwidth is thus obtained. However, due to the minute core size, installation is a lot more difficult,
especially with respect to alignment during joining. To further minimize dispersion, the single-mode
fiber requires a laser beam source. A single-mode fiber is illustrated schematically in Figure 3.13.
Graded-Index Fibers In graded-index fibers, the refractive index of the core varies (is graded) from
a maximum, n1, at the center of the core to the value n2, of the cladding (Figure 3.14), according to
the relationship:
nr =
⎧
⎪
⎨
⎪
⎩
n1
√[
1 − 2Δ
( r
rc
)k1
]
0 ≤ r ≤ rc
n2 r > rc
(3.25)
where k1 is a constant and nr is the core refractive index at radius r.
k1 = ∞ for step-index fibers. For k1 = 2, light from a point source experiences periodic focus￾ing in the fiber (Figure 3.14b). For modes with larger entrance angles 𝜃, the travel path is longer.
However, they also travel in a region where the refractive index is lower, and thus the wave veloc￾ity is greater. Thus, they reach a given point about the same time as the lower-order modes which
travel mainly in the slower regions. This reduces the intermodal dispersion. Thus, the bandwidth
increases accordingly. The graded fiber index is thus good for large bandwidth and medium-distance
applications.❦

3.7.2.5 Beam Degradation As it propagates through a fiber, the light beam becomes degraded as
a result of several factors that affect the beam characteristics. The two principal forms of degradation
are as follows:
1. Dispersion or distortion.
2. Optical losses.
Before further discussing the degradation phenomena, we outline other ways in which optical
fibers are characterized. The characteristics of an optical fiber can also be described in terms of its
bandwidth or its impulse response in the time domain (rms pulse duration). Either of these char￾acterizations can be obtained by exciting the fiber with an impulse input and observing the output
pulse or its spectrum. The fiber characteristics are generally specified as either a bandwidth-length
product, with units of megahertz kilometers, or a pulse dispersion denoted in nanoseconds per meter.
We now take a look at the different forms of degradation.
Dispersion Dispersion or distortion of the light beam results from various causes. The principal
contributing mechanisms are as follows:
1. Chromatic (material) dispersion.
2. Waveguide dispersion.
3. Modal dispersion.❦
❦ ❦
❦
110 BEAM DELIVERY
To understand the phenomenon of dispersion, let us consider the concept of group velocity or
group delay associated with the energy that is transmitted through the fiber. From Eq. (3.6), we have
the following one-dimensional equation for the electric vector of a monochromatic electromagnetic
plane wave propagating in a dielectric medium:
El(x, t) = E0 cos(kwx − 𝜔t) (3.26)
By considering the phase of the wave to be constant, that is, k𝑤x−𝜔t = constant, we obtain the
phase velocity (also known as wave velocity), uw, as:
uw = dx
dt = 𝜔
kw
(3.27)
The phase velocity is also given, Eq. (3.1d), by:
uw = c
n (3.28)
where n is the refractive index of the medium and c is light velocity in free space. Thus,
uw = c
n = 𝜛
kw
(3.29)
For a nonmonochromatic source, the phase velocity in a dispersive medium may be determined
using the center wavelength of the source. However, it is customary to use the group velocity, ug,
which in the limit, is defined as:
ug = dx
dt = d𝜔
dkw
(3.30)
The group velocity is the velocity of the wave envelope and is the velocity at which information
that is modulated on the wave will propagate. Generally, the group and phase velocities of a wave in
a dispersive medium will be different. The inverse of the group velocity is referred to as the group
delay per unit length, 𝜒g:
𝜒g = 1
ug
= dkw
d𝜔 (3.31)
Now from Eq. (3.29), this can also be expressed as:
𝜒g = dkw
d𝜔 = 1
c
d(n𝜔)
d𝜔 = 1
c
(
n + 𝜔 dn
d𝜔
)
(3.32)
The expression in brackets on the right-hand side of Eq. (3.32) is referred to as the group index, ng:
ng = n + 𝜔 dn
d𝜔 (3.33)
Eq. (3.33) can also be expressed (Problem 3.5) as:
ng = n − 𝜆 dn
d𝜆 (3.34)❦

BEAM DELIVERY SYSTEMS 111
The group velocity and group delay can now be expressed as:
ug = c
ng
(3.35)
and
𝜒g = ng
c (3.36)
Chromatic Dispersion Chromatic dispersion is also sometimes referred to as material disper￾sion and results from the nonlinear variation of the refractive index of a material with wavelength,
that is, change in n1 and n2 with 𝜆. As discussed in Sections 1.5 and 1.7, even laser beams are
not exactly monochromatic and generally cover a range of wavelengths. Thus, if the refractive
index–wavelength relationship is not linear over that range, the different wavelengths will propagate
with different velocities within the fiber, resulting in distortion of the optical signal.
Now consider a nonmonochromatic source with a wavelength Δ𝜆 that spreads between 𝜆1 and
𝜆2 and is centered at 𝜆0. If it propagates energy over a single-mode fiber of length Lf, the difference
in arrival times of energies propagated by the wavelengths 𝜆1 and 𝜆2, the delay distortion or pulse
broadening, Δ𝜏cd, can be expressed as:
Δ𝜏cd = Lf[𝜒g(𝜆1) − 𝜒g(𝜆2)] =
Lf
c ng(𝜆1) −
Lf
c ng(𝜆2)=−
Lf

But from Eq. (3.34),
dng
d𝜆 = dn
d𝜆 − dn
d𝜆 − 𝜆 d2n
d𝜆2 = −𝜆 d2n
d𝜆2 (3.38)
Substituting Eq. (3.38) into (3.37) gives the pulse broadening due to chromatic dispersion in a
single-mode fiber as:
Δ𝜏cd = Lf
c 𝜆 d2n
d𝜆2 Δ𝜆 = LfDdΔ𝜆 (3.39)
where Dd is the dispersion coefficient, with units ps/(km nm). This is shown schematically in
Figure 3.15.
Example 3.1 Consider a beam of wavelength 1.0 μm propagating through a fiber of length 5 km
and whose dispersion coefficient is as shown in Figure 3.15. If the spectral width, Δ𝜆, of the beam
is 0.050 μm, determine the pulse broadening due to chromatic dispersion.
Solution:
From Figure 3.15, the absolute value of the dispersion coefficient is obtained as 42 ps/(km nm).
Thus, the pulse broadening is
Δ𝜏cd = LfDdΔ𝜆 = 5 × 42 × 50
= 10.5 ns
The effect of chromatic dispersion can be minimized by appropriate selection of beam wavelength
to fall in the region where d2n/d𝜆2 ≈0. This is normally in the range 1.2–1.4 μm for fused silica. The
impact of chromatic dispersion in multimode fibers is generally negligible. However, it is the more
dominant form of distortion and thus limits the bandwidth in single-mode fibers.❦

Wavelength (μm)

waveguide dispersion Waveguide dispersion results from the fact that the propagating charac￾teristics of a mode depend on the beam wavelength. Longer wavelengths have a longer path since
they reflect at more oblique angles with the cladding. Analysis of the delay distortion for waveguide
dispersion is beyond the scope of this book. It can be shown, however, that the pulse broadening,
Δ𝜏wd, due to waveguide dispersion may be expressed as:
Δ𝜏wd = Lf
c
Δ𝜆
𝜆 (n2 − n1)Dw(𝜈n) (3.40)
where Dw(𝜈n) is a dimensionless dispersion coefficient and Lf is the fiber length.
The pulse broadening due to waveguide dispersion is relatively small compared to chromatic
dispersion.
intermodal dispersion Intermodal dispersion results from differences in the distances propa￾gated by the different modes sustained by the fiber (Figure 3.12). If all the rays shown in the figure
start out at the same instant, the bouncing rays reach the end of the fiber at a later time than the axial
ray. The temporal delay (dispersion) in the arrival times of the rays causes delay distortion or change
in the spectrum of the original input beam. The derivation of the expression for the delay distortion
for this case is also beyond the scope of this book. However, for a step-index multimode fiber, the
group delay, 𝜒g, can be expressed as:

bc = (𝛾crc)

n
(3.42)
where 𝛾c is the rate of decay of the electric field in the cladding.
The first term on the right-hand side of Eq. (3.41) corresponds to the group delay due to chromatic
dispersion in the step-index multimode and is independent of a particular mode.
The second term corresponds to the modal waveguide delay. It is different for every mode. When
a laser pulse enters the fiber, it is shared by many guided modes in the fiber. The pulse thus splits up
into a number of pulses. Each of these exits the fiber at a different time since the delays of the modes
are different. The difference in arrival times of the mode with the largest waveguide group delay and
that with the least delay can be derived, through rigorous analysis (which is beyond the scope of this
book) to be
Δ𝜏m = Lf
c (n1 − n2)
(
1 − 𝜋
𝜈n
)
(3.43a)
Equation (3.43a) expresses the difference in the arrival times of the leading and trailing edge of the
output pulse of the fiber. A simpler approximation of the pulse broadening due to intermodal distor￾tion may be based on the difference between the travel time of the slowest mode (corresponding to the
highest-order mode) and that of the fastest (corresponding to the fundamental mode) (Figure 3.12).
Using ray tracing, this is obtained as:
Δ𝜏m = tmax − tmin = Lfn1Δ
c (3.43b)
where tmax is the travel time of the slowest mode (one with the longest ray congruence path) and tmin
is the travel time of the fastest mode (one with the shortest ray congruence path).
Example 3.2 Determine the pulse broadening for a 5 km fiber with core and cladding refractive
indices of n1 = 1.48 and n2 = 1.46, respectively.
Solution:
The approximate value of the pulse broadening is obtained as:
Δ𝜏m = Lfn1Δ
c = 5000 × 1.48
3 × 108
(1.48 − 1.46
1.48
)
= 333 ns
Thus, the time delay between the axial ray and the ray that just enters the fiber at the angle of
acceptance is about 333 ns. This corresponds to a modal dispersion-limited bandwidth of approxi￾mately 3.0 MHz.
It is evident that modal dispersion will generally not be a problem with single-mode fibers, since
single-mode fibers only sustain a single mode of the beam. However, for step-index multimode fibers,
modal dispersion is much greater than chromatic dispersion. It is the dominant form of distortion
and is the primary mechanism that limits step-index multimode fibers to low bandwidth (less than
100 MHz km) applications.❦

114 BEAM DELIVERY
Optical Losses There are several factors that contribute to optical losses associated with beam
transmission by a fiber optic system. These can be categorized as:
1. Input-coupling losses.
2. Connector/splice losses.
3. Fiber losses.
4. Output-coupling losses.
The most significant of these losses, especially in regard to fiber optic beam delivery for manufac￾turing applications, are the input-coupling and fiber losses. We will thus provide further discussion
only on these two sources of optical losses.
input-coupling losses Input-coupling losses occur at the interface between the beam source and
the fiber. These include
1. Mismatch between the source’s emitting area and the fiber core area, which contributes to
input-coupling losses.
2. Effect of the numerical aperture, which defines the light-gathering ability of the fibers them￾selves.
3. The packing fraction, which is associated with fiber bundle cables, where several fibers are
grouped together and illuminated by one light source. This loss is given by the ratio of the
collective core areas of the fibers to the total bundle cross-sectional area.
fiber losses Losses in the fiber result in attenuation of the beam as it propagates through the fiber.
The attenuation is expressed as the ratio of input power to output power (in decibels) per unit length
of fiber:
𝛼l = 1
Lf
10log10 ( qin
qout )

where 𝛼l is attenuation, qin is the input power, and qout is the output power.
Fiber losses may be categorized into intrinsic and extrinsic losses.
Intrinsic Fiber Losses Intrinsic fiber losses are associated with the basic microstructural charac￾teristics of the material used in making the fiber. They can generally be attributed to three main
causes:
1. Ultraviolet Absorption: Results from excitation of electrons of the glass material from the
valence to the conduction band by photons of ultraviolet wavelength and is thus electronic in
origin. The absorption is wavelength-dependent and may be expressed as:
𝛼uv = Kuve
−𝛼uv
𝜆 dB∕km (3.45)
where Kuv is a constant which is a function of the dopant in the glass, 𝛼uv is a constant (with
units of microns), and the wavelength 𝜆 is also expressed in microns. The absorption peaks at
approximately 0.14 μm wavelength for fused silica.❦
❦ ❦
❦
BEAM DELIVERY SYSTEMS 115
2. Infrared Absorption: This is due to the lattice vibrational modes of the fused silica and dopants.
Depending on the type of dopant, the absorption peak for this type of loss may fall between
7 and 11 μm wavelengths. The power loss due to infrared absorption increases exponentially
with wavelength and is expressed as:
𝛼ir = Kire
−𝛼ir
𝜆 dB∕km (3.46)
where Kir and 𝛼ir are constants, and the wavelength 𝜆 is expressed in microns.
3. Rayleigh Scattering: This results from inhomogeneities (such as density and composition vari￾ations) within the fiber due to the amorphous nature of glass. The microscopic density and
composition variations cause local variations of the refractive index, which are of dimensions
much smaller than a wavelength, and thus act as scattering centers. The Rayleigh scattering
loss is strongly wavelength-dependent and is given by:
𝛼Rs = KRs
𝜆4 dB∕km (3.47)
where KRs is the Rayleigh scattering coefficient, with units (dB/km) μm4.
The general dependence of the intrinsic losses on wavelength is illustrated in Figure 3.16
which shows an increase in the ultraviolet and Rayleigh scattering losses as the wavelength
decreases, while the infrared losses increase with increasing wavelength. The end effect is that
the total intrinsic loss curve has a minimum, usually in the near-infrared region between 0.6
and 1.6 μm, depending on the fiber material and dopants.
Extrinsic Fiber Losses Extrinsic fiber losses include impurity and structural imperfection losses,
macrobending losses, and microbending losses.

1. Impurity and Structural Imperfection Losses: These result from imperfections associated with
the fabrication process, such as impurities within the glass and structural imperfections, and
can be minimized by improvements to the fabrication process. An example of an impurity
loss is illustrated by the peak at about 1.375 μm of the loss curve in Figure 3.16, caused by the
hydroxyl group,OH−.
2. Macrobending Losses: These are associated with axial bends of relatively large radius, of the
order of 1 mm or more, in the fiber. This type of loss increases with increasing wavelength
and decreasing bend radius. The loss is also mode-dependent, with higher-order modes being
more severely attenuated by bending. Generally, bend radii of the order of a few centimeters
should be avoided.
3. Microbending Losses: These are caused by random deflections of the fiber along its axis. The
deflections are of the order of a few microns and can cause scattering losses.
3.7.2.6 Application of Optical Fibers in High-Power Laser Systems From the viewpoint of man￾ufacturing applications, the principal effects that beam degradation (dispersion and attenuation) have
on a laser beam as it propagates through an optical fiber are changes in the beam mode and inten￾sity. Thus, a beam that enters the fiber with a Gaussian mode may be incident at the workpiece with
a significantly different mode form and with the intensity significantly reduced. It is also obvious
from Figure 3.16 that there is a certain wavelength range (typically in the near-infrared range) over
which beam attenuation is minimized. Thus, it is more feasible to transmit the 1.06 μm wavelength
Nd:YAG laser beam using fiberoptic cables than it is to transmit the 10.6 μm wavelength CO2 laser
beam, or the much shorter wavelengths in the ultraviolet region.
Since most high-power Nd:YAG lasers have beam quality of M2 between 50 and 100, fiber sizes
that are used typically range between 800 and 1000 μm in diameter. Smaller fiber sizes can only be
used when beam quality significantly improves. This is because the beam size needs to be smaller
than the fiber core diameter. Otherwise, power losses and heating may create significant problems.
Based on the preceding discussions, following are a few points to be noted in using fiber optic
delivery systems in high-power laser applications.
1. Shorter fibers tend to have less effect on the beam characteristics, whereas a relatively long
fiber may result in an output beam whose characteristics are significantly different from that
of the incident beam.
2. Increasing the number of bends in the fiber cable or the tightness of the bends tends to generate
more modes and thus change the beam profile or quality.
3. Smaller fibers limit the number of modes and thereby increase the beam quality.
4. Graded-index fibers tend to produce higher-quality beams.
5. Smaller fibers and graded-index fibers are more appropriate for processing applications that
require high-power densities such as laser cutting.
6. For applications such as heat treatment that require a widely distributed beam (top-hat pro￾files), step-index fibers are preferable.
7. Fiber optic connectors are required at both the input end to launch the beam into the cable,
and at the output end for delivering the beam to the workpiece.
8. The output optics system may also include a pair of lenses to collimate and focus the beam.
3.8 BEAM SHAPING
The mode (profile or shape) of a laser beam used in materials processing has significant impact on
the process outcome (Section 8.1.3), influencing the melt pool shape and/or size, process window,❦
❦ ❦
❦

surface quality, and mitigating the formation of hot cracks. Changing the beam profile is thus an
effective means of influencing the process dynamics. The shape of a beam is characterized by the
irradiance profile, while the phase is defined by the optical path distance traveled by the wave￾front. Beam shaping thus involves modulation of the irradiance and/or phase of a beam, coherent or
incoherent.
Basic techniques that are used for transforming a beam include the following:
1. A small aperture to suppress the higher-order modes, leaving only the TEM00 mode (Section
1.2.2.3). A major drawback with this approach is the loss of a significant portion of the laser
power. Furthermore, the transmitted beam is not necessarily uniform, but rather Gaussian.
2. Beam integrators (Section 11.1.2.2).
3. Fast beam deflection (wobbling or beam oscillation) (Section 10.7.3).
4. Field mapping transformation using
i. Refractive optics.
ii. Reflective optics.
iii. Aspheric optical elements.
iv. Liquid crystal spatial light modulators.
v. Acousto-optical beam shaping.
vi. Diffractive optics.
5. CBC and OPA.
Refractive and reflective optics result in relatively complex systems since they are based on spher￾ical elements. Using aspherical components will reduce the number of elements, but these are more
expensive to produce. Liquid crystal spatial light modulators are effective for real-time application,
but limited to low powers (<250 W) since higher powers will damage the crystals. Acousto-optical
beam shaping is still in the research stages. Diffractive optics, on the other hand, provide a great
deal of flexibility in beam shaping, enabling a wide variety of intensity profiles to be produced eco￾nomically. However, they are not effective for real-time application, since they are based on solid
optical elements (hardware). In the next section, we discuss the basic concepts of beam shaping using
diffractive optics, followed by the CBC and OPA technique.
3.8.1 Beam Shaping Using Diffractive Optics
Differences between refractive (classic) and diffractive optical elements (DOEs) are illustrated with
the simple case in Figure 3.17, where it is evident that a diffractive lens can be generated from a
refractive lens by removing rectangular sections of material that do not contribute to focusing of
the light. The resulting diffractive lens is thus smaller in size, while maintaining the same focusing
characteristics.
Factors that need to be considered in designing a DOE are the following:
1. Efficiency of transformation by the optical element.
2. Minimization of error sources such as chromatic aberration and thermal sensitivity.
3. Ease of fabrication.
Using diffractive optics for beam shaping involves designing a DOE that will generate a desired
beam profile for a given input profile. A DOE essentially uses interference and phase modification
to modulate a wave profile by first segmenting the wavefronts and redirecting the segments. We start
our discussion on design of DOEs by considering the simple and well-known case of the Fresnel
phase plate.❦

3.8.1.1 Fresnel Phase Plate The Fresnel phase plate is a form of diffractive lens and, as such,
diffracts and focuses a collimated monochromatic radiation at a point P. It is based on the concept
of Fresnel zones where a circular aperture can be divided into annular regions such that each of the
regions has the same area and contributes the same amount of light at P, which is located on the axis
through the center of the aperture (Figure 3.18). The radii of the inner and outer rings of the annular
regions are such that the distance from the periphery of each ring to the point P is equal to the
distance from P to the aperture center (f) plus an integer number of half-wavelengths. The annular
regions are the Fresnel zones and the radii of the zones can be shown (using Pythagoras’ theorem)
to be given by:

π - Phase Regions
Figure 3.19 Fresnel phase plate.
Since the optical distance from contiguous Fresnel zones to P differs on average by a
half-wavelength, the zones are 180∘ out of phase and thus block each other out in terms of the
electric field contributed at P. The electric field at P will thus vary between two values as the aperture
diameter is increased. However, by shifting the phase of alternating zones by 180∘, the contiguous
zones will now reinforce each other at P. This phase shift is achieved by using the DOE as shown
in Figure 3.19, the Fresnel phase plate. The 180∘ (𝜋) phase-shift regions are achieved with grooves
of depth:
d = (2N − 1)𝜆
2N+1(nr − 1)
(3.49)
where nr is the refractive index of the DOE and N is the number of masks needed to manufacture the
DOE. For the simple binary case shown in Figure 3.19, N= 1. As N increases, the element becomes
more accurate. In the limit, N tends to infinity for a kinoform, and the depth equation then reduces to
d = 𝜆
2(nr − 1) (3.50)
The simple binary (two-level) structure is not very efficient, and the efficiency can be improved by
increasing the number of levels (multilevel) as shown in Figure 3.20 for two-, four-, and eight-level
structures. The diffraction efficiency is the ratio of the power of the diffracted beam to the incident
power and results from diffraction loss. Thus, a 60% phase plate will have only about 60% of the
incident light being focused onto the axis. In the limit, the resulting continuous profile, the kino￾form, has 100% efficiency. The phase functions for the different structures (phase levels) are shown
in Table 3.1, together with the depth of etching necessary to achieve that phase function, and the
corresponding efficiency.
3.8.1.2 Diffractive Optics Design For some manufacturing applications such as laser surface heat
treatment, it is desirable to use a beam that has uniform irradiation distribution that drops off sharply
at the boundary (flat top), since it provides an even distribution of the beam irradiation on the area
being processed. Flat-top beams have also been used in illumination and skin treatments in derma￾tology. In general, customized beam shaping can be useful in a variety of applications, for example,❦

laser welding of dissimilar materials. Even though in theory, diffractive optics can be used to trans￾form any beam profile into any other profile, reality dictates that the input profile be as simple as
possible. We shall therefore focus on the use of diffractive optics to transform Gaussian beams into
flat-top beams (Figure 3.21), to illustrate the basic concepts. For such a case, it is essential for the
input Gaussian (TEM00) beam to be of high quality, with a low M2 value of about 1.1 or less. Where
the input beam is of lower quality, it may be necessary to use a spatial filter to enhance the beam
quality before transformation.
One common technique for generating a flat-top beam from a Gaussian mode is to partition the
original beam into sections which are then remapped unto the focal plane. The uniform profile is
achieved by diverging the higher-intensity regions near the center and directing them away from
the center in a controlled manner, while converging lower-intensity regions (Figure 3.22). To avoid
spikiness due to interference effects, the sectioned beams are not superposed or made to overlap
between the beam shaper and the focal plane. The drawback with this method is that it is only
applicable to single-mode beams.❦

DOEs have an advantage in the variety of beam shapes that they can generate. Generally, an
optical element can transform an input wavefront into a desired output by modifying the wavefront
phase profile, 𝜙(r). For a phase-only element, this transformation, T, may be expressed as:
T(r) = ei𝜑(r) (3.51)
where r is the radial distance from the element center. 𝜙(r) essentially defines the etch depth and
zone transition points.
The phase profile of an optical element results from the phase delay (difference), Δ𝜙, at any level
due to travel through the element. For a collimated beam traveling along the optical axis, the phase
difference at any radial distance from the optical axis of the element is
Δ𝜙 = 2𝜋nrh
𝜆 − 2𝜋h
𝜆 = 2𝜋h
𝜆 (nr − 1) (3.52)
where h is the thickness at any level and is a function of the radial distance, r.❦

Thus, one basic approach to generating a flat-top beam from a Gaussian beam is to use a phase
grating as a multilevel DOE where transformation involves modulation on the phase of the input
field. It can be shown that for a Gaussian beam normal to a transmissive DOE, the phase function
that transforms it into a flat-top beam is

A DOE with grating function that is the sum of 𝜙x(x) and 𝜑y(y) will transform the Gaussian beam

Line beam profiles have been shown to be more effective than the circular beams from which
they are generated, in heat treating surface and thin films, since the surfaces can be more efficiently
heated (up to about 20 times) than when a circular beam and 2D scanner are used.
There are commercial software packages by ZEMAX, 3333OSLO, and CODE V that facilitate
the generation of the optical element geometry for a given phase function. The outcome of the trans￾formation process depends on the beam wavelength, aperture (input beam size), working distance
(or effective focal length), and output beam size.
3.8.1.3 Beam Propagation After Diffraction A given optical element design will generate
the flat-top profile only at the focal plane. The beam profile changes with propagation distance
(Figure 3.23), being convex or rounded at the top before the focal plane, and concave- or ring-shaped
after the focal plane. This is due to errors (aberrations) associated with wavefront modulation.
To understand the effect of propagation on the diffracted beam, let us consider a DOE El(x, y, 0)
(Figure 3.24). The profile El(X, Y, Z), at any general location, a distance Z from the aperture, can be
related to the aperture profile, El(x, y, 0), by the Rayleigh–Sommerfeld equation as follows:

Standard beam shapers that are based on DOEs are highly wavelength-dependent. Thus, a specific
diffractive optics design will generate the desired profile over a narrow range of wavelengths. Poly￾chromatic designs, on the other hand, are able to operate over a relatively broad wavelength range.
However, the output profiles for such systems are not as accurate as those of the standard design.
3.8.1.4 Diffractive Optical Element Construction A number of techniques have been developed
for constructing DOEs. Here, we outline the basic concepts of one common technique that is based
on photolithography, using a simple design to illustrate the concepts. It involves the use of masks,
photoresist, and etching, and the basic steps are illustrated in Figure 3.25a. The number of masks
used depends on the number of phase levels desired (Table 3.1), and the relationship between them is
p = 2N (3.57)
where p is the number of phase levels and N is the number of masks.❦

The mask can be produced using an electron beam pattern generator. It is first placed on a sub￾strate that has a thin photoresist coating on the surface and then exposed to ultraviolet radiation.
The photoresist is now developed, resulting in exposed and unexposed regions that are defined by
the mask. Etching of the substrate now results in removal of the exposed regions in steps until the
desired depth, which determines the optical path difference between the etched and unetched lev￾els, is achieved. A finer profile can be achieved by using additional masks with smaller spacing and
repeating the process in subsequent steps, as illustrated in Figure 3.25b.
3.8.2 Beam Shaping Using Coherent Beam Combining and Optical Phase Array
The CBC and OPA technique (or Civan method) is more suited for real-time beam shaping.
CBC enables high-power levels, up to 21 kW CW, to be obtained in single-mode fiber lasers.
The principle involves splitting a seed laser into a number of channels (about 10 to over a 100),
as shown in Figure 3.26. Each channel is then amplified individually, and the amplified beams
are recombined into one high-power output. For real-time applications, recombination takes
place in the far field using an interference pattern which is controlled electro-optically by rapid
modulation of each channel’s phase. This is the OPA stage which enables dynamic modulation of
process parameters.
With OPA, all the channels are directed at the workpiece in the far field to create a specific interfer￾ence pattern at the focal point by electro-optically manipulating the phases of the individual beams.
The resulting interference pattern determines the beam properties such as 2D steering (wobbling),
depth of field, shape, and power density.
The listed beam properties are currently manipulated using robots (1 Hz), mirrors (1 kHz), and
DOEs (static). The response times of these elements are relatively slow, limiting the processing
speeds. Furthermore, the use of mechanical components in some cases implies the need for main￾tenance. With electro-optical control in OPA, the parameters can be modulated at up to 10 MHz
frequencies, making the process more suited for real-time control.❦

3.9 SUMMARY
In electromagnetic wave theory, the product of the wavelength and frequency of electromagnetic
radiation is equal to the velocity at which the radiation propagates in free space. When electromag￾netic radiation or light beam enters a birefringent material, it is refracted into two rays, the ordinary
and extraordinary rays. The ordinary ray obeys Snell’s law and has the same velocity in any direction
in the material, while the extraordinary ray has different velocities in different directions and does
not follow Snell’s law.
A light beam is said to be linearly or plane-polarized when the electric vector is restricted to a
specific plane. When a light beam is incident on a surface, the electric vector associated with the
beam can be resolved into two components, the p-component (lying in, or parallel to the plane
of incidence) and the s-component (normal to the plane of incidence). The angle of incidence at
which the reflected beam becomes plane-polarized normal to the plane of incidence is called the
Brewster angle.
If two waves that have the same frequency and are plane-polarized in the same plane are super￾imposed on each other, the frequency of the resulting light vector is the same as that of the original
light vectors. However, the amplitudes and phase angles are different. Now if the two plane waves
lie in different planes which are orthogonal to each other, the resulting light vector will be ellipti￾cally polarized. Further, if the amplitudes of the two light vectors are equal, and the phase difference
between them is 90∘, the resulting light is circularly polarized.
Beam expanders are usually used to increase the size of a beam before focusing, and that reduces
the size of the focused beam, increasing the power density at the focal point. This can be achieved
using transmissive or reflective optics. On the other hand, beam splitters are used to split a light
beam into two or more beams and can be done using either a wedge-shaped reflector or a partially
reflective and partially transmissive optical element.❦
❦ ❦
❦
126 BEAM DELIVERY
In this chapter, we have discussed the two major ways in which a beam can be delivered from the
laser generator to the workpiece:
1. Using a conventional combination of transmissive and reflective optics (lenses and mirrors)
2. Using a fiber optic cable (which will usually also include some lenses).
Major components of a conventional beam delivery system include the beam bending assembly,
focusing assembly, interconnecting beam guard tubes, and different types of mirrors and lenses.
Beam delivery can also be achieved using fiber optic systems, even though these may not be appli￾cable to all types of high-power lasers. The basic structure consists of the transmitter, transmission
line (of interest in processing), and receiver. The waveguide, in which the light beam propagates,
consists of two principal components: core and cladding. The core is the inner portion through
which light is transmitted, and the cladding is the concentric outer layer with a relatively lower
index of refraction. The waveguide is characterized by the numerical aperture, normalized frequency,
and angle of acceptance. The major fiber types are the step-index multimode, single-mode, and
graded-index multimode fibers. Fiber optic systems are normally limited by beam degradation, and
the major forms of degradation are dispersion or distortion (including chromatic or material disper￾sion, waveguide dispersion, and modal dispersion), and optical losses such as input-coupling losses,
connector/splice losses, fiber losses, and output-coupling losses.
The profile or shape of a laser beam has significant influence on the process outcome. There are
different techniques that can be used for changing the beam profile, but one of the most advantageous
involves the use of diffractive optics. These change the profile by modulating the phase as a result of
phase delay at any level due to travel through the DOE. The element design can thus be generated
once the phase profile is known. Special software packages are available for this step. The designed
optical element can then be produced by a process that is based on photolithography and involves
the use of masks, photoresist, and etching. A DOE is most effective for the specific wavelength for
which it was designed. Changing the beam wavelength will deteriorate the profile. Furthermore, the
desired profile is obtained at the focal point and is modified outside this region (before or after).
The basic concepts of beam shaping using the CBC and OPA technique are then discussed. With
capability for MHz frequency modulation, this method is highly suited to real-time applications.

4 Heat and Fluid Flow
The heat and fluid flows that occur during laser processing influence the microstructures (through
the grain structure and phases that are formed), residual stresses (through the thermal stresses that
result from differential strains), and distortion that evolves during the process. These in turn affect
the mechanical properties and thus quality of the process. The discussion in this chapter is in three
sections. In the first section, simplified lumped parameter energy balance equations are presented that
enable quick estimates to be made of energy requirements for a given process. Then in the second
section, only heat flow in the solid part of the workpiece is considered. The analysis in this section is
applicable, as a first approximation, to all the processes discussed, and is more accurate in the solid
part of the workpiece. To enable closed-form solutions to be obtained, the heat source is initially
modeled as either a point or line source. Analytical expressions are then obtained for the temperature
distribution for the quasi-stationary state, together with the cooling rates, and peak temperatures.
A Gaussian distribution, which is more representative of the heat source, is then considered. This
is followed by the two-temperature model, which is appropriate for ultrashort pulse laser beams
in metals. In the third section, flow in the molten pool for processes that involve melting (such
as welding, cladding, surface melting, and cutting) is discussed. In the second and third sections,
the basic governing equations are first presented. Then where feasible, approximate closed-form
analytical solutions are presented that enable a quick analysis of the process to be made.
4.1 ENERGY BALANCE DURING PROCESSING
During processing, part of the beam that is incident on the workpiece is reflected away, and the
remaining part is absorbed by the workpiece. The absorbed energy, Qa, is what is used in processing
and may involve
1. Heating up the solid to the melting temperature, Q1 = macpΔTm
2. Melting, which requires the latent heat of melting, Q2 = maLm
3. Heating up the molten material to the vaporization temperature, Q3 = macpΔTv
4. Vaporization, which requires the latent heat of vaporization, Q4 = maLv
5. Energy lost by conduction, convection, and radiation, Ql.
where cp is the specific heat (J/kg K), Lm is the latent heat of melting per unit mass (J/kg), Lv is the
latent heat of vaporization per unit mass (J/kg), ma is the mass (kg), Tm is the melting temperature
(
∘C), Tv is the vaporization temperature (∘C), ΔTm = Tm −T0, and ΔTv = Tv −Tm
Thus, an energy balance gives
Qa = macpΔTm + maLm + macpΔTv + maLv + Ql (4.1a)

136 HEAT AND FLUID FLOW
Assuming all the absorbed energy is used in processing, and neglecting any losses, we have the
following energy balance for the process:
Qa = macpΔTm + maLm + macpΔTv + maLv = 𝜌V(cpΔTm + Lm + cpΔTv + Lv) (4.1b)
where 𝜌 is density (kg/m3) and V is volume (m3).
Since part of the absorbed energy is conducted into the surrounding material, it experiences a
temperature rise, with subsequent cooling. Conduction into the workpiece is discussed in the next
section.
4.2 HEAT FLOW IN THE WORKPIECE
The principal thermal factors that determine the microstructure of the workpiece are the temperature
distribution, the peak temperatures, and the cooling rates that are experienced during the process.
Once an expression for the temperature distribution is obtained, it can be used to derive the peak tem￾perature and cooling rate expressions. The following analysis of the heat flow in the solid workpiece
is therefore discussed along these lines.
4.2.1 Temperature Distribution
The discussion on the temperature distribution starts with the governing equation for conduction heat
flow. This is based on the assumption that heat conduction through the workpiece is usually much
greater (for materials with very low thermal conductivity, this assumption can lead to significant error
and thus might need to be reconsidered) than any heat exchange with the surroundings by natural
convection or radiation. It is further assumed that the workpiece surfaces are adiabatic, that is, there
is no heat loss or gain by either convection or radiation.
With these assumptions, the governing equation for heat flow in a solid with a coordinate system
fixed at a stationary origin relative to the solid is given (Appendix 4.B) by:

+ qs (4.2b)
or in a more compact form:
𝜌cp
dT
dt
= ∇ ⋅ (k∇T) + qs (4.2c)
where k is the thermal conductivity (W/mm K), qs is the rate of local internal energy generated per
unit volume (W/mm3), t is the time (s), and T is the temperature (∘C).
Equation (4.2) is nonlinear, and thus it is difficult to solve in closed form. To make the problem
more tractable analytically, the following simplifications are made:
1. The equation is linearized by assuming that the material’s physical coefficients such as thermal
conductivity are independent of temperature. Thus, 𝜕k/𝜕T = 0.
2. The internal heat generation is neglected. This means qs = 0. This assumption is reasonable for
a number of applications, especially when one compares the external heat sources associated
with some laser processes, with any heat that might be generated within the material. However,❦
❦ ❦

HEAT FLOW IN THE WORKPIECE 137
this is not necessarily true of oxygen-assisted laser cutting where the exothermic reaction can
be considerable.
3. The workpiece material is assumed to be homogeneous and isotropic. This is a reasonable
approximation for many non-composite materials which have not been work-hardened.
With these simplifications, Eq. (4.2a, b) reduces to the form:
dT
dt = 𝜅
(𝜕2T
𝜕x2 +

= 𝜅∇2T (4.3)
where 𝜅 = k/𝜌cp is the thermal diffusivity (mm2/s).
Solution of Eq. (4.3) requires six boundary conditions, two in each direction, and an initial con￾dition.
One general approach to solving Eq. (4.3) is to use separation of variables by first expressing
T(x, y, z, t) as:
T = X(x)Y(y)Z(z)𝜏(t) (4.4)
However, before further discussing the solution of Eq. (4.3), we first consider possible forms of
the heat flow problem in laser processing to see if the analysis can be further simplified. The heat
source used in laser processing is usually one of two possible configurations:
1. A stationary source, for example, as used in laser drilling or spot welding, and such processes
may be directly analyzed using the preceding equations.
2. A moving source, for example, as used in laser cutting, welding, or heat treatment.
Analysis of the moving heat source case is facilitated by using a coordinate system that is attached
to the heat source. Let us therefore consider a coordinate system moving with the heat source along
the x-axis, as shown in Figure 4.1. The corresponding governing equation is obtained by a coordinate
transformation from the plate to the heat source (Appendix 4.C), with x being replaced by 𝜉, y by y′
,
z by z′
, and t by t
′
, that is,
𝜉 = x − uxt, y′ = y, z
′ = z, t
′ = t
where ux is the traverse velocity of the heat source in the x-direction (mm/s).

where 𝜉, y,zis a coordinate system attached to the moving heat source, with positive 𝜉 in the direction
in which the heat source is moving; x, y, z is a coordinate system with origin O and fixed to the
workpiece, with positive x in the direction in which the heat source is moving; and 𝜕T/𝜕t is the time
rate of change of temperature in the moving coordinate system.
When a uniform prismatic workpiece is processed over a long enough period, experimental results
indicate that a state is reached when an observer positioned at the heat source or moving origin detects
no change in the temperature distribution around the source. This is the quasi-stationary state, and
for this case, the temperature undergoes no change with time with respect to the coordinate system
attached to the heat source. The time derivative in Eq. (4.5) thus vanishes and the governing equation
then becomes

This is the differential equation for the quasi-stationary case.
A convenient way of solving an equation of this form is to assume that T is of the form:
T = T0 + exp (

2𝜅
)
𝜑(𝜉, y,z) (4.7)
where T0 is the initial temperature of the workpiece and 𝜙(𝜉, y, z) is a function that is yet to be
determined.

𝜑 = 0 (4.8)
Similar differential equations are encountered in the analysis of electric wave problems. Thus, in
this form, appropriate solutions are more easily obtained, depending on the boundary conditions that
are imposed. To facilitate the analysis and obtain a closed-form solution of the preceding equation,
the following additional simplifying assumptions are made in this section:
1. A point or line heat source is used. This assumption enables a closed-form solution to be
obtained. A more accurate representation would be that of a Gaussian distribution. However,
for that, we would have to resort to numerical methods.
2. No phase changes occur, that is, the effect of latent heat of fusion is negligible. As a first-order
approximation, this is a reasonable assumption, since latent heat is absorbed in front of the
heat source and evolved behind it.
The Gaussian heat source is considered separately in Section 4.2.4. Thus, for now, we consider
two forms of solutions:
1. One case is that of a thick plate on which a point heat source moves and involves
three-dimensional heat flow. This might be the case, for example, in conduction mode
welding (Section 10.3.1).❦

2. The other case is that of a thin plate with a line heat source that penetrates through the thickness
and involves two-dimensional heat flow. Examples would be keyhole welding (Section 10.3.2)
or laser cutting (Chapter 9).
To determine whether a plate is thin or thick, the following equation may be used as an initial
approximation:
𝛽c = h
√
𝜌cpux(T − T0)
q
(4.9)
where h is the plate thickness (m) and q is the heat flux (power) input (W).
The plate is considered to be thin when 𝛽c <0.6 and thick when 𝛽c >0.9. When high accuracy is
desired and 0.6< 𝛽c <0.9, then it is best to solve the equations numerically. We now consider the
closed-form solutions for the thick and thin plate cases separately.
4.2.1.1 Thick Plate with Point Heat Source (Three-dimensional) Figure 4.2 schematically illus￾trates this configuration. Ideally, the plate is considered to be semi-infinite, and the heat source to be
a point. Now let q = heat flux (power) input and r = √𝜉2 + y2 + z2, where r is the distance of any
general point, P(𝜉, y, z), from the moving origin (Figure 4.1).
However, to make the analysis even simpler, we start by considering the fully infinite case. Since
the temperature of the plate remains unchanged far away from the source, the boundary conditions
for this case can be constructed as follows:
𝜕T
𝜕𝜉 → 0 as 𝜉 → ±∞, 𝜕T
𝜕y → 0 as y → ±∞, 𝜕T
𝜕z → 0 as z → ±∞ (4.10)
To account for the heat input, we consider the fact that for the point source, the heat flux through
the surface of a sphere of radius r drawn around the source approaches q as r → 0, that is,
lim
r→0
−4𝜋r2 × k ×
𝜕T
𝜕r = q (4.11)
Now we have to obtain the solution for Eq. (4.8) which satisfies the preceding boundary conditions
and accounts for the heat input as given in Eq. (4.11). Due to the nature of the boundary conditions❦
❦ ❦
❦
140 HEAT AND FLUID FLOW
and the heat input equation, as well as the symmetrical nature of Eq. (4.8), 𝜙 depends only on r.
Thus, using polar coordinates, Eq. (4.8) can be re-expressed as:
d2𝜑
dr2 +
2
r
d𝜑
dr −

𝜑 = 0 (4.12)
But

Thus, Eq. (4.12) becomes
d2(𝜙r)
dr2 =

𝜙r = 0 (4.14)
An obvious solution of Eq. (4.14) which also satisfies the boundary conditions is

or 𝜑 = k1

where k1 is to be determined.
This solution, Eq. (4.15a), also satisfies the heat input condition, Eq. (4.11), since
d𝜑
dr × r2 → constant value as r → 0 (4.15b)
Now substituting Eq. (4.15a) into (4.7) gives the expression for the temperature distribution for
the infinite case as:
T − T0 = q
4𝜋kr exp (
−ux(r + 𝜉)
2𝜅
)
(4.16)
The corresponding solution for the semi-infinite case, which is more representative of laser pro￾cessing of an infinite plate (semi-infinite space), follows from Eq. (4.16) as:
T − T0 = q
4𝜋kr exp [
−ux(r + 𝜉)
2𝜅
]
(4.17)
The factor 2 that results in Eq. (4.17) is due to the fact that we are now considering only one half
of the space. For laser processes that involve melting, Eq. (4.17) applies only outside the fused zone,
that is, for T < Tm (the melting temperature), and is more accurate farther away from the fusion
boundary.
4.2.1.2 Thin Plate with Line Heat Source (Two-dimensional) The configuration for this case is
illustrated schematically in Figure 4.3. In this case, heat flow is in two directions, 𝜉 (or x)-direction,
and y-direction. There is no flow in the z-direction. The heat source is considered to be a line that
goes through the entire plate thickness uniformly. Thus, heat is input to the system as power per unit
thickness. Now let r = √𝜉2 + y2, the radius of a cylinder drawn around the heat source.
Since the heat source is uniform through the thickness, there can be no change in temperature in
the thickness direction. Thus, we have

Again since the temperature of the plate remains unchanged far away from the source, the bound￾ary conditions for this case can be constructed as follows:
𝜕T
𝜕𝜉 → 0 as 𝜉 → ±∞, 𝜕T
𝜕y → 0 as y ± ∞ (4.19)
And yet again to account for the heat input, we consider the fact that since this is a line source, the
heat flux through the surface of a cylinder drawn around the line source approaches q asr → 0, that is,
lim
r→0
−2𝜋rhk ×
𝜕T
𝜕r = q (4.20)

𝜑 = 0 (4.21)
The solution to Eq. (4.21) that satisfies the boundary conditions is the modified Bessel function
of the second kind and zero order, K0(uxr/2𝜅).
It can be shown that
K0

These graphs were obtained by solving equations (4.17, 4.22). From these figures and the equations,
the following deductions can be made:
1. The temperature gradient ahead of the heat source is much higher than that behind it.
2. Different points along the y-axis in a given section reach their peak temperature at different
times. Points farther away have a lower peak temperature, and that is reached at a later time.
The locus of points that reach their peak temperatures at the same instant is indicated by curve
n – n in Figure 4.5.
3. A higher thermal conductivity material such as aluminum makes the isotherms more circular,
reducing the temperature gradient in front of the heat source (Figure 4.5).
4. Increasing the traverse speed makes the isotherms more elongated, while also increasing the
lag of the locus n – n (Figure 4.6).
5. Increasing the heat input or preheating does not change the shape of the isotherm but increases
the size. This widens the fusion zone, as well as the heat-affected zone (HAZ) (Section 5.1.3).❦

the thicker plate results in a higher temperature gradient (Figure 4.7).
Example 4.1 Two thin steel plates are welded using a laser beam. The following conditions
are used:

4.2.2 Peak Temperatures
The peak temperatures experienced throughout the workpiece determine the size of the HAZ. The
peak temperature at a given point is experienced by the point shortly after it is passed by the heat
source.
At any position of the heat source, the isotherms of various temperatures are oval-shaped. The
point on any isotherm which is furthest from the x-axis (or line of motion of the heat source) is at its
peak temperature at that instant. At these points, the tangent to the isotherm is parallel to the x-axis,
and thus the following relation holds
(𝜕y

)
T
= 0 (4.23)
Using Eqs. (4.17, 4.22, 4.23), and considering temperatures in terms of distance from the fusion
zone boundary, it can be shown that the peak temperature for a thin plate (line source) is given
(Problem 4.2) by:

where e = natural exponent = 2.71828, Tp is the peak or maximum temperature at a distance Y from
the fusion boundary (∘C), and Y is the distance from the fusion boundary at the workpiece surface
(mm).
Equations (4.24) and (4.25) are applicable to single-pass processes and have to be applied to each
pass by itself. They are useful for estimating the HAZ size and also for showing the effect of preheat
on the HAZ size. It is evident from the equations that all parameters being constant, preheating
increases the size of the HAZ. Also, the size of the HAZ is proportional to the net energy input.
Thus, high-intensity processes such as laser welding generally have a smaller HAZ. A high-intensity
energy source results in a lower total heat input, because the energy used in melting the metal is
concentrated in a small region.❦

HEAT FLOW IN THE WORKPIECE 147
In general, the equation (i.e. (4.24) or (4.25)) which gives the higher computed distance from the
fusion zone or higher peak temperature at a given location is the more accurate of the two.
Example 4.2 A steel plate is welded using a laser of output power of 5 kW, at a speed of 40 mm/s,
resulting in a heat transfer efficiency of 75%. The material has a thickness of 4 mm. If the ambient
temperature is 30 ∘C, determine
(a) The peak temperature at a distance of 1.0 mm from the fusion boundary.
(b) The HAZ size.
Solution:
The properties of the steel plate are approximated as:
Average density, 𝜌 = 7870 kg/m3
Average specific heat, cp = 452 J/kg K
Thermal conductivity, k = 0.073 W/mm K
Melting temperature, Tm = 1538 ∘C.
With a heat transfer efficiency of 75%, the net power input available at the workpiece is
q = 0.75 × 5 = 3.75 kW = 3750 W
The thermal diffusivity is given by:
𝜅 = k
𝜌cp
= 0.073
7.87 × 10−6 × 452 = 20.52 mm2∕s
We calculate the peak temperature for both the two- and three-dimensional cases and select the
higher value
(a) The peak temperature calculated at a distance of 1.0 mm from the fusion boundary, for the
thin plate, is obtained from Eq. (4.24) as:

Tp = 805 ∘C
For the thick plate, we have from Eq. (4.25):

(b) In determining the HAZ size, the temperature at which the material will experience a change
in properties will have to be defined. This temperature is used as the peak temperature in
calculating the HAZ size. For example, for a plain carbon steel, the critical temperature is
the eutectoid temperature. Thus, Tp = 723 ∘C. Since we have determined that the thick plate
formulation is more accurate, we now substitute this value in Eq. (4.25), giving

4.2.3 Cooling Rates
When a material is heated to a high enough temperature, the rate at which it cools afterward deter￾mines the grain structure and phases that are formed. These in turn affect mechanical properties
such as strength and ductility. For example, high cooling rates result in a finer grain structure which
increases the strength but reduces the ductility of the material. Knowledge of cooling rate is most
important for materials which are polymorphic in nature, for example, steels. This enables a vari￾ety of phases with widely different mechanical properties to be produced. It is of less interest for
aluminum, for example, where the cooling rates are always high.
In deriving an expression for the cooling rate, we simplify things by observing that the highest
cooling rates occur along the line of motion of the heat source, that is, along the center line (y = z = 0,
and r = |𝜉|). We also consider only negative values of 𝜉, that is, behind the heat source. Substituting
these conditions into Eq. (4.17) for the three-dimensional case (thick plate) gives

However, since the temperature undergoes no change with time with respect to the coordinate

(𝜕T(𝜉, y, z, t)/𝜕t = 0), reducing Eq. (4.27) to the form:
dT

Eq. (4.30) is applicable to the three-dimensional case, that is, thick materials, and indicates that

above the initial temperature.
For thin plates, that is, the two-dimensional case, the centerline cooling rate can be derived in a
similar fashion (Problem 4.5) and is given by

As indicated in Section 4.2.1, the plate is considered to be thin when 𝛽c <0.6 and thick when
𝛽c >0.9 (Eq. 4.9) or in general, the equation (i.e. (4.30) or (4.31)) which gives the lower cooling
rate is the more accurate of the two (Figure 4.8). This is especially the case when 0.6< 𝛽c <0.9. It
must be realized, however, that these methods are only approximate, and that where high accuracy
is essential, numerical methods ought to be used.
From Eqs. (4.30) and (4.31), the following deductions can be made:
(a) Increasing the heat input (q) reduces the cooling rate, while increasing the traverse velocity (ux)
increases the cooling rate.
(b) Increasing the initial workpiece temperature (or preheat) (T0) reduces the cooling rate and is
more effective than increasing the heat input or reducing the traverse velocity.
(c) The cooling rate increases with an increase in plate thickness (h).

(d) A higher conductivity (k) material such as aluminum results in a higher cooling rate.
(e) The cooling rate decreases with an increasing distance (y) from the process center line.
Equations (4.30) and (4.31) strictly give the centerline cooling rates behind a point or line source
of heat moving in a straight line at constant velocity on a flat surface and are most accurate for
cooling rates at temperatures which are significantly below the melting temperature. Fortunately, the
temperatures at which cooling rates are of metallurgical interest, especially for steels, are well below
the melting point, and the estimates from these equations are then reasonably accurate. Furthermore,
since the centerline cooling rate is only about 10% higher than in the HAZ, these equations also fairly
well represent cooling rates in the regions of metallurgical interest.
Example 4.3 Calculate the cooling rate at 500 ∘C in a 3-mm-thick aluminum plate which is clad
(Section 11.3) using a laser with output power of 4.5 kW and speed of 60 mm/s. Assume an ambient
temperature of 25 ∘C and a heat transfer efficiency of 0.70. Use both the thin and thick plate equations
and compare the results.
Solution:
From Appendices 4D and 4E, the properties of the aluminum plate are approximated as:
Average density, 𝜌 = 2700 kg/m3
Average specific heat, cp = 900 J/kg K
Thermal conductivity, k = 0.247 W/mm K.
The actual power available at the workpiece is
q = 0.70 × 4500 = 3150 W
First, we calculate 𝛽c using Eq. (4.9) to determine whether the thick or thin plate equation is more
appropriate:
𝛽c = h

q = 3 ×

2.7 × 10−6 × 900 × 60 × (500 − 250)

Since 𝛽c <0.6, the plate may be considered thin. Thus, we have for the thin plate:

For the thick plate solution, we have
dT
dt = −2𝜋 × 0.247 × 60
3150 × (500 − 25)
2 = −6670 ∘C∕s
Since the cooling rate value calculated for the thin plate is the lower of the two, it is the more
accurate one.❦

4.2.4 Gaussian Heat Source
The Gaussian distribution provides a better description of most heat sources than the point or line
source described in preceding sections. It is especially important for processes such as heat treatment
and laser forming, where the heat source is spread over a relatively wide area. However, it does not
have a complete closed-form solution and requires numerical analysis. The basic elements of the
analysis are presented in this section.
In analyzing the heat flow for a Gaussian heat source, the workpiece is assumed to be semi-infinite
(three-dimensional), that is, − ∞ <x, y< ∞ and 0≤z< ∞ . The heat supply in the material per unit
volume and unit time at a point (x′
, y′
, z′
) due to a Gaussian heat distribution for a constant power
source q is

for 0 < z

where w is the Gaussian beam radius and 𝛼 is the beam power absorption coefficient which is a
property of the base material. It is about 800 m−1 for mild steel in keyhole welding and R is the
reflectivity, which is about 0.3 for steel.
The initial conditions of the problem are given by:
T(x, y,z, 0) = 0 everywhere in the domain (4.33)
The boundary conditions are (for t>0)
T(x, y,z, t) = 0 for {
x, y → ±∞
z → ∞ (4.34)
Convection and radiation heat losses at the top surface of the workpiece are neglected. Thus, the
boundary condition at the work surface, z = 0, is
−k
𝜕T(x, y,z, t)
𝜕z = 0 at z = 0 (4.35)
The last boundary condition can be satisfied by using the imaginary heat source technique. For
any real point heat source in the region (x′
, y′
, z′
), we assume that there is a corresponding imaginary
heat source at (x′
, y′
,−z′
) of the same strength as the real source. We also assume an infinite medium
instead of a semi-infinite one. This makes the temperature field symmetric about the z = 0 plane,
that is, there is no heat transfer across the work surface (z = 0). Eq. (4.34) then becomes
T(x, y,z, t) = 0 for x, y,z → ±∞ (4.36)
Considering the real and imaginary heat sources, qs1 in Eq. (4.32) becomes

where |z′

Now suppose that at time t = t

, a unit heat pulse is emitted at (x′
, y′
, z′
), and that an infinite
medium moves uniformly past (x′
, y′
, z′
) with velocity u = (ux, 0, 0), ux <0, parallel to the x-axis.❦

4.2.5 The Two-Temperature Model
The two-temperature model to be discussed in this section is more appropriate for describing the
interaction between ultrashort pulse beams and metals. The mechanism of laser–material interaction
for ultrashort pulse lasers (sub-picosecond pulse duration) is different from that for the traditional
long pulse lasers (nanosecond and above). Whereas the electrons and lattice are essentially in ther￾mal equilibrium at the end of a long pulse, that is not necessarily the case for ultrashort pulse beams.
For the latter case, electrons and the metal lattice (phonons) behave as two separate systems. Elec￾trons located within the skin depth first absorb the photon energy. This is then transferred to the
metal lattice through electron–phonon collisions. Even though the same process occurs for both
long and ultrashort pulse lasers, their separate effects are more evident at short interaction times. As
the electrons absorb the photon energy, they get excited to higher energy levels, and rapidly ther￾malize, resulting in a hot free electron gas. The high-temperature electron gas then diffuses into the❦

metal, heating up the metal lattice through electron–phonon collisions. The collision or thermaliza￾tion time of the electrons is of the order of 20 femtoseconds at room temperature. However, the
electron–phonon thermal relaxation time is of the order of picoseconds, since several collisions are
necessary for effective energy exchange between electrons and phonons.
Local thermal equilibrium is thus established between the hot electrons and the lattice during the
pulse when the laser pulse duration is longer than the electron–phonon thermal relaxation time. This
results in the electrons and lattice having the same temperature by the end of the pulse. The analyses
in the preceding sections are then appropriate. These constitute the one-step heating model.
Electrons can normally be heated to very high temperatures within short time periods, since their
heat capacity is relatively low. Thus for situations where the pulse duration is of the same order of
magnitude as the electron–phonon thermal relaxation time or less, the electrons and lattice are no
more in local thermal equilibrium. They then have to be considered as separate systems and modeled
as a two-step process that constitutes
(a) Absorption of photon energy by electrons.
(b) Lattice heating through electron–phonon coupling.
The corresponding basic governing equations for the two-step process are as follows:
cvole(Te)
𝜕Te
𝜕t
= ∇ ⋅ (ke∇Te)−ΔQe→l + qsl (4.41)
cvoll(Tl)
𝜕Tl
𝜕t
= ΔQe→l (4.42)
where cvol = 𝜌cp is the heat capacity (specific heat per unit volume), the subscripts e and l refer to
electron and lattice, respectively, and qsl is the volumetric heat source term given by Eq. (4.32) for
the three-dimensional case.
ΔQe → l is the energy transferred by electrons to the lattice and can be approximated from free
electron theory (provided the lattice temperature is not much smaller than the Debye temperature)
as:
ΔQe→l = 𝜋2meneus
2
6tc(Te)Te
(Te − Ti) = G(Te − Ti) (4.43)
where me is the electron mass, ne is the electron number density (/m3), us is the speed of sound, and
tc(Te) is the electron mean free time between collisions at temperature Te.
This basic form of the two-step model is sometimes referred to as the parabolic two-step model
(PTS), while the traditional model is referred to as the parabolic one-step model (POS). Since the
expression for G in Eq. (4.43) can be shown to be only weakly dependent on Te, it can be further
simplified as:
G = 𝜋4(neuskB)

Sample measured values for G are shown in Table 4.1.
This formulation of the governing equations neglects the energy transport by phonons, since
heat flux is carried mainly by free electrons for metals. The variation of the electron and lattice
temperatures with time on an irradiated surface are illustrated in Figure 4.9a. The surface electron
temperature is much higher than the lattice temperature in the initial stages of the process as the elec￾trons absorb the incident radiation. However, the two temperatures eventually become equal after
a long enough time as thermalization occurs. The lattice temperature profiles obtained using the❦

two-temperature model are compared with those obtained for the corresponding one-temperature
or traditional model in Figure 4.9b for a 10 ps laser pulse. The traditional model tends to confine
the absorbed radiation energy mainly in regions close to the surface, resulting in much higher peak
temperatures being predicted, while the two-temperature model predicts a much larger HAZ. Similar
predictions for a nanosecond laser pulse (Figure 4.9c) shows little difference between the two models,
indicating that the effects of the microscopic radiation–metal (photon–electron and electron–phonon)
interactions are then less important.
The two-temperature model can be extended to account for energy transport in the hyperbolic
formulation. This is referred to as the hyperbolic two-step model (HTS) when only energy transport
by electrons is considered. When transport in the lattice is also considered, then we have the dual
HTS model, which is given by the following equations:

where qe and ql are the heat flux vectors for the electrons and lattice, respectively, and 𝜏F is the
relaxation time evaluated at the Fermi surface. The relaxation time is the mean time for electrons to
change their states.
Now the thermalization time, 𝜏t, that is, characteristic time for electrons and phonons to reach
equilibrium, can be expressed as:
𝜏t = cvole0(T)
G (4.49)
where the subscript 0 indicates evaluation at a reference temperature.
The hyperbolic transport effect on the electron temperature is more important when the laser
pulse duration is shorter than 𝜏F, and the mechanism of energy deposition becomes important when
the pulse duration is shorter than 𝜏t. Values of 𝜏Fe and 𝜏t for some metals are shown in Table 4.2.
At room temperature, 𝜏Fe is about an order of magnitude smaller than 𝜏t. Thus, the mechanisms of
energy deposition are expected to play much more important roles during short pulse laser heating
of metals than the effects of hyperbolic transport.❦

In the next section, we address the basic concepts associated with flow in the molten pool. The
discussion is useful for processes that involve melting, such as surface melting and welding.
4.3 FLUID FLOW IN MOLTEN POOL
Fluid flow in the molten pool affects the structure and properties of the fused zone, such as the geome￾try (penetration and bead width), surface smoothness (ripples), porosity, lack of fusion, undercutting,
solidification structure, and macrosegregation (mixing). The principal flow factors that determine the
process quality include the flow velocities and mode of solidification for the processes that involve
melting. In this section, we focus on flow in the molten pool. Solidification is discussed in the next
two chapters.
The flow system is illustrated schematically in Figure 4.10 for conduction mode laser welding
(or melting) (Sections 10.3.1 and 11.2). The primary forces responsible for flow in the molten pool
for this case are the surface tension and buoyancy forces. The equations governing convection and
fluid flow in the molten pool are obtained by considering mass conservation in the pool (continuity
equation), momentum due to motion of the fluid (Navier–Stokes equations), and conduction in the
workpiece. Heat conduction in the workpiece has already been discussed in the preceding section.
In the following subsections, we discuss the continuity and momentum equations that govern flow in
the molten pool. This is followed by a discussion on the surface tension effect for a flat pool surface.
Finally, the basic concepts involved in analyzing a pool with a free surface are outlined.
4.3.1 Continuity Equation
Using the same coordinate system as shown in Figures 4.2, 4.3, and 4.10, the general form of the
differential equation for conservation of mass in a fluid medium is expressed as:❦

forces. Thus, the only body force left is the gravitational force in the z-direction. Hence the body
force, using the Boussinesq approximation, for the configuration shown in Figure 4.10, reduces to
Fz = −𝜌g𝛽T(T − To) Fx = Fy = 0
where g is the gravitational acceleration (m/s2) and 𝛽T is the volumetric thermal coefficient of expan￾sion (/K).❦

158 HEAT AND FLUID FLOW
Here, the pressure, P, is defined to include the hydrostatic component, 𝜌gh. Equations (4.51) to
(4.54), along with Eq. (4.2a,b) constitute the governing equations for flow in the molten pool when
the conduction mode is predominant (i.e. there is no keyhole (Section 10.3.1)). They are coupled
since the buoyancy term and surface tension forces provide a link between the flow and thermal
equations. With the appropriate boundary conditions, they can be solved to obtain the temperature
and velocity fields in the molten pool. These equations are more appropriate for processes such as
conduction mode welding and surface melting. Fluid flow in laser cutting and keyhole welding will
be discussed under the appropriate topics (Chapters 9 and 10). In the following section, the influence
of surface tension on flow in the molten pool is further discussed.
4.3.3 Surface Tension Effect
The surface tension that exists on the molten pool surface induces thermocapillary (surface tension
driven) flow on the pool surface. This is because the surface tension force changes with temperature.
And since the temperature varies on the pool surface, a surface tension gradient exists on the surface.
This results in fluid being drawn along the surface from the region of lower surface tension to the
region of higher surface tension. The flow induced by surface tension is referred to as Marangoni
convection. The bead shape that results depends on whether the temperature derivative of the surface
tension (surface tension gradient) d𝛾
dT is positive or negative (Figure 4.11).
The form of the surface tension gradient is determined by surface-active elements (i.e. elements
that preferentially segregate to the surface of the molten metal) such as sulfur and oxygen (for
iron-based alloys) in the base material. These elements alter both the surface tension and temper￾ature dependence of the surface tension. Thus, different heats of the same material (compositions
within the specified allowable range) are known to produce different shapes of the fusion zone under
the same processing conditions. This is because small variations in the sulfur content, for example,
result in considerable variations in penetration.

FLUID FLOW IN MOLTEN POOL 159
Ordinarily, metals that are either pure or that have insignificant amounts of surface-active ele￾ments have a negative surface tension gradient and thus induce outward flow of molten metal on the
pool surface. Hotter material from the center is thus carried outward toward the periphery at high
velocities. As the flow approaches the edge of the molten pool, it is diverted downward and then
turned around, moving back to the pool center to complete the recirculation pattern (Figure 4.11a).
This results in a wider but shallower pool. The surface flow normally occurs in a thin layer called
the Marangoni layer.
For a molten pool with a positive surface tension gradient, the surface tension forces will increase
with temperature, that is, from the periphery or toe (which is relatively cooler) toward the center of
the molten pool (which is relatively hotter). The higher surface tension forces in the center will draw
or pull the material at the pool surface from the periphery toward the center. This results in surface
flow inward (Figure 4.11b). Since the bead shape is ideally symmetrical, the stream of metal from
the two edges of the pool will meet and flow downward at the center, thereby carrying the hottest
material from the central portion of the free surface to the bottom of the pool, resulting in deeper
penetration.
Sulfur, oxygen, and sellenium are among the elements that produce a positive surface tension
temperature coefficient. As an illustration, addition of about 50 ppm of sulfur to a steel is adequate
to increase the depth of penetration by over 80%, while about 140 ppm of selenium will increase the
depth to width ratio by more than 160%.
Addition of surface-active elements to the molten pool can be accomplished by doping the filler
rod, pre-coating the joint before processing, or doping the shielding gas.
The surface tension effect is specified as boundary shear at the free surface, that is, bound￾ary conditions on the pool surface, since tangential force balance requires that the thermocapillary
stresses should be balanced by viscous shear. The equations for the boundary shear (Eq. (4.55))
can be obtained by considering the fact that for Newtonian flow, the shear stress in the material
(right-hand side) is proportional to the resulting shear strain rate (left-hand side). For the simple
molten pool shown schematically in Figure 4.10, we obtain these equations by making the following
assumptions:
1. Shear in the shielding gas immediately above the pool surface is negligible.
2. The pool surface is flat.

where 𝛾 is the surface tension of the molten pool material at temperature T (J/m2).
Surface tension dominated flow will normally result in maximum surface velocity of the order
of 103 mm/s, while for buoyancy dominated flow, maximum surface velocities are of the order
of 10 mm/s. This indicates that the thermocapillary forces are much greater than the buoyancy
forces.
When a keyhole is formed, the depth to width ratio is not significantly influenced by the relatively
small amounts of surface-active elements normally present in steels. This is because the penetration❦

under such conditions is affected primarily by the magnitude of surface tension rather than the surface
tension gradient.
4.3.4 Free Surface Modeling
In the previous section, the pool surface was assumed to be flat. In reality, the molten pool surface
undergoes both spatial and temporal variations during processing. As a result of the surface curvature,
the surface tension stresses have both tangential and normal components. The surface stresses may
be expressed in the general form:

in phases 1 and 2, respectively, rs is the radius of curvature of the surface (m), and ni (i = 1, 2, 3)
are the components of the unit vector normal to the surface and directed into the interior of phase 1.
Summation over a repeated index (i, k = 1, 2, 3) is assumed.

where H is the height of the surface relative to some reference elevation.
Taking the projections of Eq. (4.56) in the directions normal and tangential to the interphase
boundary, we obtain the curvature and Marangoni effects, respectively. The curvature effects

4.4 SUMMARY
This chapter addressed basic concepts of heat and fluid flow as they apply to laser processing and
was broken down into three main sections:
• Energy balance.
• Heat flow in a solid workpiece.
• Fluid flow in a molten pool.
The analysis on heat flow in a solid workpiece is directly applicable to processes such as laser
forming and heat treatment, where no melting occurs. It also provides reasonable approximation for
the heat flow in the solid part of the other processes that involve melting. With the heat source being
considered as either a point or a line source, the analysis indicates that the temperature gradient
ahead of the heat source is much higher than that behind it; increasing the traverse speed elongates
the isotherms surrounding the heat source; higher thermal conductivity materials make the isotherms
more circular, reducing the temperature gradient in front of the heat source; increasing the heat input
or preheating does not change the shape of the isotherm but increases the size, thereby widening the
fusion zone and HAZ and that for the same conditions, a thinner plate results in a greater HAZ size
than a thicker plate.
The peak temperatures experienced throughout the workpiece determine the size of the HAZ.
The peak temperature at a given point is experienced by the point shortly after it is passed by the
heat source. The size of the HAZ increases with both preheating and the net energy input. Thus, the
high-intensity laser processes generally have a smaller HAZ.
The cooling rate experienced by a material determines the grain structure and phases that are
formed. Increasing the heat input reduces the cooling rate, while increasing the traverse velocity
increases the cooling rate. Preheating reduces the cooling rate, while increasing the plate thick￾ness increases the cooling rate. Higher conductivity materials such as aluminum result in a higher
cooling rate.
A Gaussian distribution, which is more representative of the heat source, was then considered.
This was followed by the two-temperature model, which is appropriate for ultrashort pulse laser
beams in metals. For the latter case, the electron and lattice heat flows are modeled separately, with
a coupling term. From this analysis, the surface electron temperature is found to be much higher
than the lattice temperature in the initial stages of the process as the electrons absorb the incident
radiation. However, the two temperatures become equal as thermalization occurs.
The analysis in the third section on flow in the molten pool is applicable to processes that involve
melting such as welding, cladding, surface melting, and cutting. It was noted that a negative surface
tension gradient (typical of pure metals) induces outward flow of molten metal on the pool surface,
resulting in a wider and shallower pool. A positive surface tension gradient (which occurs when
surface-active elements such as sulfur are present), on the other hand, induces inward flow of molten
metal, resulting in deeper penetration for processes that do not involve a keyhole.❦

In deriving Eq. (4.2a), use is made of Fourier’s law for heat conduction across a surface, which states
that
q = −kAdT
dx (4.B.1)
where A is the area perpendicular to the flow of heat and q is the heat flux (rate of heat flow) across
a surface.
To obtain the temperature distribution as a function of time, we consider a control volume as
shown in Figure 4B.1. Considering the principle of energy conservation, the rate of change of internal
energy per unit volume (qv) of the control volume must equal the sum of:
1. Net rate of heat flux per unit volume across its faces, qn.
2. Any heat sources or sinks within it per unit volume, qs, such as from chemical reactions or
current passing through it (Joule effect):

5 The Microstructure
The heat flow associated with laser processing does affect the microstructure of the part that is
produced. In this chapter, basic microstructural concepts and discontinuity (defect) formation, as
they relate to laser processing, are discussed. Defects are discussed in this chapter, since they are
closely tied to the microstructural changes that occur during processing.
The chapter starts with a brief outline of the major microstructural zones that occur in the part
during processing, addressing the fusion zone, zone of partial melting, and the heat-affected zone
(HAZ). Under fusion zone, basic concepts of solidification are introduced, starting with nucleation,
where the conditions necessary for the formation of a stable nucleus are outlined. The concepts of
homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation are presented. This is followed by a discussion on the
growth of the stable nuclei to form crystals or grains.
The microstructure that results as the molten material solidifies is presented next, outlining the
principal types of structure that may result, that is, planar, cellular, or dendritic, and the criterion that
determines which structure is most likely to form. Techniques for controlling nucleation and also for
grain refinement are then presented.
The zone of partial melting is then discussed, followed by the HAZ that results for pure metals,
precipitation-hardening and non-ferrous alloys, and steels. Next, common discontinuities that can
result during laser processing are discussed. These include porosity, cracking, incomplete penetra￾tion, lack of fusion, and undercutting.
Analyses in this chapter are based on fundamental concepts that lead to closed-form solutions
for first-order approximations. Several methods are available for more precise microstructural anal￾yses using numerical simulation. Among these are cellular automata, Monte Carlo, and phase field
methods.
The process microstructure is discussed next.
5.1 PROCESS MICROSTRUCTURE
The processes that involve fusion (laser cutting, welding, surface melting, and cladding) have four
distinct zones in the region where the heat is applied (Figure 5.1). These are as follows:
1. Fusion zone.
2. Zone of partial melting.
3. HAZ.
4. Base material.

The first three zones will be discussed individually in the following sections. For processes that
do not involve fusion (laser heat treatment and laser forming), microstructural changes occur only
in the HAZ.
5.1.1 Fusion Zone
The fusion zone is the portion of the material which melts. The discussion on the fusion zone starts
with an introduction to the solidification process, focusing on grain nucleation and growth. This is
followed by the microstructure of the fusion zone, nucleation, and grain refinement in the molten
pool. Solidification is discussed in greater detail in the next chapter.
5.1.1.1 Initial Solidification Solidification generally occurs in two stages:
1. Nucleation, which occurs when a small piece of stable solid (nucleus) forms from the liquid.
2. Growth, which occurs as atoms from the liquid are attached to the nucleus.
Nucleation A nucleus is the smallest particle of the new phase (solid in this case) that can exist in
a stable form. Nucleation will generally occur when the part is cooled below an equilibrium temper￾ature, Te. This is the temperature at which the free energies of the two phases (solid and liquid) are
equal. Below it, the solid is the more stable phase, since its free energy is then lower than that of the
liquid phase.
The process of nucleation can occur in two forms:
1. Homogeneous nucleation.
2. Heterogeneous nucleation.
In homogeneous nucleation, the nuclei of the second-phase form within the bulk or matrix of the
original phase, say the liquid, in the case of solidification. This rarely occurs in practice, and for it to
be possible, there must be extensive supercooling. In heterogeneous nucleation, the nuclei either form
on foreign particles suspended in the liquid or on the walls of the container, and the amount of under￾cooling necessary for it to occur is much smaller than that required for homogeneous nucleation.
In either case, each nucleus constitutes the basis for a crystal or grain, which may subsequently grow.❦
❦ ❦
❦
PROCESS MICROSTRUCTURE 177
For homogeneous nucleation, the total free energy change, ΔG, associated with the formation of
a spherical solid nucleus in a liquid medium consists of two components:
1. The bulk free energy change.
2. The surface energy change.
Thus, the total free energy change is given by:
ΔG = 4
3
𝜋r3ΔGv + 4𝜋r2𝛾nl (5.1)
where r is the radius of the nucleus, ΔGv denotes the bulk free energy change per unit volume of
transformed material, and 𝛾nl stands for surface energy per unit area between the solidified nucleus
and liquid (molten metal).
Typical surface energy values for some common metals are shown in Table 5.1.
ΔGv may be expressed as:
ΔGv = LmvΔTe
Te
(5.2)
where Lmv is the latent heat of fusion per unit volume, Te = equilibrium temperature = Tm,
ΔTe = Te – T = degree of supercooling, and T is the temperature of the molten metal.
Since heat is evolved during solidification, Lmv is negative, and thus the bulk free energy change
ΔGv will be negative at all temperatures below the solidification temperature, that is, T<Te, while
the surface energy change is always positive.
The variation of the two terms in Eq. (5.1) with the radius of the nucleus is shown in Figure 5.2.
It is evident from Figure 5.2 that there is a free energy barrier to the nucleation process. In other
words, a critical nucleus size, rc, is necessary for the process to continue. At the critical radius,
the system is in metastable equilibrium. A small decrease in the radius at that point will result in the
surface energy term dominating, and the nucleus will redissolve, since the total free energy decreases
with decreasing radius in the region of the curve below the critical radius. An increase in the radius
at the metastable state will result in a continued decrease in free energy with increasing radius as the
bulk free energy term dominates. The continued decrease in free energy is a necessary condition for
the formation of a stable nucleus. A stable nucleus is then formed.

In heterogeneous nucleation during cladding for example, since the nucleation would be on the
surface of the unmelted base metal, any nucleus formed would not be completely spherical in shape,
but rather can be approximated as a spherical cap (Figure 5.3). For such a shape, the total free energy
change associated with the nucleation would be given by:

and the fusion zone nucleus and liquid (molten) pool, 𝛾nl. For the spherical cap nucleus shown in

where hp is Planck’s constant, Vm is the volume of a molecule, and ΔEd is the activation energy for
diffusion.
The dependence of both the number of nuclei and nucleation rate on temperature is such that
the rate is low just below the equilibrium temperature, increases to a maximum as the degree of
supercooling increases, and then decreases to zero toward absolute zero. This is because the diffusion
rate is relatively fast at temperatures just below Te. However, since the supercooling, ΔTe, is then
small, the critical free energy change necessary for nucleation is then large (Eq. (5.4)). Thus, only a
few nuclei attain sufficient energy to reach the critical size. At relatively lower temperatures where
ΔTe is large, the critical free energy change for nucleation is correspondingly small. However, the
diffusion rate is then low, and atoms can no longer move about easily to form nuclei. The nucleation
rate is then low. A maximum occurs in the nucleation rate at intermediate temperatures where the
diffusion rate is relatively high, and the critical free energy change for nucleation is not too large.
The nucleation principles outlined in the preceding paragraphs are also applicable to solid–solid
transformations, for example, austenite to pearlite transformation, which may occur in steels after
solidification is completed and the fusion zone continues to cool. However, the resulting nucleation
rates are generally much smaller in this case for a number of reasons:
1. Much lower diffusion rates in solids.
2. Higher interfacial energies in the solid state, resulting in higher critical free energy change for
the formation of a nucleus.
3. Lower bulk free energy change in the solid, which also increases the critical free energy
change.
4. Since the solid does not flow very easily to accommodate volume changes associated with
the formation of a nucleus, there is strain energy associated with the formation of the nucleus.
That increases the total free energy change necessary for the nucleus formation, since the strain
energy term is positive. This term is absent when there is liquid present since the liquid flows
easily to accommodate any deformation or volume change associated with the transformation.
Example 5.2 For the conditions in Example 5.1,
(a) Determine the number of stable nuclei per unit volume. Assume the density of nucleation sites
is 2.5 × 1030 per m3.
(b) Determine the nucleation rate. Assume the radius of a silver atom is 0.144 nm, and the activation
energy for diffusion in silver is 44.1 kcal/mol = 184.5 kJ/mol (Shewmon, 1983, p. 66).

Growth The growth of a stable nucleus involves movement of atoms to and attachment to the
nucleus. The growth process is thus diffusion-controlled.
Since the base metal is at a lower temperature than the molten pool during laser processing,
solidification of the molten metal would ordinarily begin with the formation of solid nuclei at the
unmelted surface of the base metal in contact with the molten pool. The nuclei that are formed would
then grow into the molten metal, parallel to the direction of heat flow from the molten metal. Such is
the case in casting, for example, where nucleation occurs on the mold walls at a temperature just
below the melting temperature. On the other hand, initial solidification of a molten pool, in welding
or surface melting, for example, is usually epitaxial. In this case, atoms from the molten metal are
deposited directly on the existing crystals of the unmelted base metal, thereby extending the substrate
crystalline structure without changing it (Figure 5.4). This is especially true in autogenous welding
and surface melting. For such processes, since the initial grains in the fusion zone grow epitaxially
from the substrate grains, the initial crystal structure of the fusion zone is inherited directly from
that of the base metal. In other words, the structure and crystallographic orientation of the base
metal grains at the fusion zone interface continue into the fusion zone. Thus, the nucleation stage is
bypassed at the interface.
To understand the driving mechanism for epitaxial growth, the basic kinetics for phase transfor￾mation will be considered. The molten metal in autogenous welding or surface melting is normally

of the same material as the substrate and is also in intimate contact with it. Thus, it completely wets
the surface of the base metal, resulting in a zero value for 𝜙 in Eq. (5.6). It is thus evident that f(𝜙)
is also zero, and consequently, so is ΔGc. In other words, the critical free energy change required
for the formation of a stable nucleus of solid material from the molten metal is zero. Grain growth
thus occurs spontaneously from the base metal since there is no resistance to its initiation, that is,
the original grains in the base metal in contact with the molten pool continue to grow epitaxially into
the pool, without nucleation.

solidification

may decrease as solidification proceeds, unless a eutectic is formed. The interface in this case can
thus be planar, cellular, or dendritic, with the dendritic structure being further classified as columnar
or equiaxed (Figures 5.5a–d and 5.6a–d). Which one prevails is influenced by the solute content of
the molten metal and solidification conditions.
In the initial stages of the solidification of alloys, the low-melting elements are rejected by the
freezing solid. Thus, the enriched liquid directly ahead of the solid–liquid interface has a lower freez￾ing point than the previously solidified material. Since the low-melting atoms cannot diffuse rapidly
away from the interface, they tend to retard growth. However the liquid temperature is higher, farther
away from the interface, that is, toward the center of the molten metal. Thus, portions of the interface
protrude or grow rapidly into the liquid, resulting in columns that grow from the initially solidified
material, forming a cellular or columnar structure. For even lower temperature gradients at the inter￾face, branches can grow from the main columns, resulting in a dendritic structure. An individual grain
may contain a number of dendrites.
The planar interface in an alloy breaks down to form either a cellular or dendritic structure if the
following condition holds

where Dl is diffusion coefficient of the solute in the liquid, GTl is temperature gradient of the liquid
near the solid–liquid interface, SR stands for solidification rate, ΔTf =Tl −Ts = equilibrium freezing
range, Tl is liquidus temperature, and Ts denotes solidus temperature.
The tendency toward a dendritic structure increases with a decreasing value of the ratio on the
left-hand side of the equation, that is, as the solidification rate increases, or the temperature gradient
of the liquid near the solid–liquid interface decreases. Further reductions in the ratio again result
in an increased tendency from a columnar to an equiaxed dendritic structure. This is illustrated
schematically in Figure 5.7. The structure that is determined by the solid–liquid interface exists
within the individual grains and is commonly referred to as the substructure or subgrain structure.
The formation of a dendritic structure is illustrated schematically in Figure 5.8.
The product of the average temperature gradient, GTl, and interface velocity or solidification rate,
SR, is a measure of the average cooling rate, CR:
CR = GTl ⋅ SR ≈ Tl − Ts
ts
(5.12)
where ts is local solidification time.
Structural Variation Within Fusion Zone The microstructure or mode of solidification of the fusion
zone varies as one moves from the fusion boundary toward the centerline. This results primarily
from variations in the solidification rate and temperature gradient across the fusion zone. To further
understand this, consider the relationship between the solidification rate SR at any point along the
molten pool boundary and traverse velocity vector ux, which, as can be inferred from Figure 5.9, is
given by:
SR = ux cos 𝜓 (5.13)
where 𝜓 is the angle between the traverse velocity vector and the direction of solidification at any
point along the molten pool boundary.
Thus, the solidification rate SR is lowest (almost zero) along the fusion line where 𝜓 ≈90∘ and
maximum along the centerline where 𝜓 ≈0∘. Also, the elongated nature of the molten pool is such
that the temperature gradient GTl is highest along the fusion line and lowest along the centerline.❦

Thus, it is evident from Eq. (5.11) that initial epitaxial growth of the grains along the fusion line is
more likely to have a planar front (Figures 5.5a and 5.6a). As one moves inward along the molten pool
boundary, the temperature gradient decreases, while the solidification rate increases, with the result
that there is an increased tendency toward cellular growth, resulting in columnar grains (Figures 5.5b
and 5.6b). Further reductions in the temperature gradient and increases in the solidification rate
toward the centerline may result in subsequent transition to a dendritic structure in the fusion zone
(Figures 5.5c and 5.6c). This is especially so along the centerline where the temperature gradient
is lowest and where the solidification rate is highest. An equiaxed dendritic structure (Figures 5.5d
and 5.6d) may thus develop at very high traverse velocities and normally occurs in the final stages
of solidification, for example, in a weld crater.
Grain Orientation The direction of grain growth during solidification is controlled by two factors:
1. The maximum temperature gradient direction.
2. The preferred crystallographic growth direction, which is the ⟨100⟩ direction for face-centered
and body-centered cubic metals and the ⟨1010⟩ direction for hexagonal close-packed metals.❦

Considering the temperature gradient effect, the grains have a tendency to grow in the direction
of steepest temperature gradient. Since, in the case of solidification, this direction is normal to the
molten pool boundary, the general direction of grain orientation is also normal to the molten pool
boundary. Furthermore, since the shape of the molten pool depends on the traverse speed, so does
the direction of grain orientation. Thus, at high traverse velocities, the columnar grains grow straight
but are inclined to the fusion boundary since they tend to grow in a direction perpendicular to the
elongated molten pool boundary as shown in Figure 5.10a. However, at low traverse velocities, they
tend to curve toward the middle of the molten pool, to become perpendicular to the elliptical pool
boundary (Figure 5.10b). In situations where other grains are nucleated in the middle of the molten
pool, these grow in the direction of motion. This is because the pool boundary toward the center is
normal to the direction of motion at any speed. Thus, for such cases, the elongated shape at high
speeds results in a narrow band of grains in the middle (Figure 5.10c), while the elliptical shape at
lower speeds results in a wider band (Figures 5.10d and 5.11).
In considering the preferred crystallographic growth direction, it is found that in the initial stages
of epitaxial growth, some of the original base metal crystals may have their preferred growth direc￾tion in the same direction as the direction of steepest temperature gradient. Such grains will have
a greater driving force for growth and are thus more likely to grow at the expense of those which
have a less favorable orientation (Figure 5.12). Furthermore, crystals sometimes change orientation
during growth to enable the two directions (preferred growth and steepest gradient) to be coincident
and thus facilitate growth.

molten pool, they tend to form an equiaxed rather than a columnar grain structure. The new grains❦

may be nucleated heterogeneously by fragments of dendrite tips which are broken off by convection
within the molten pool, especially in the mushy zone. Both liquid and solid coexist in this region.
Grains which are only loosely held together by liquid films in the mushy zone may also be swept away
by convection and act as nucleation sites. Finally, new grains may be nucleated by foreign particles
in the molten pool. When deliberately applied, the latter technique is called inoculation and is used
to form a fine equiaxed grain structure. An example is the addition of titanium carbide powder as
an inoculant to the molten pool during submerged arc welding of mild steel. A fine grain structure
enhances the mechanical properties of the fusion zone, improving such properties as ductility and
toughness. It also reduces the tendency of the fusion zone to solidification cracking (Section 5.2.2.1).❦
❦ ❦
❦
188 THE MICROSTRUCTURE
Increasing the cooling rate results in a finer solidified structure (Figure 5.7). Thus, higher traverse
velocities produce finer dendritic spacings which in turn result in less segregation. They also result
in a finer grain structure.
5.1.2 Zone of Partial Melting
Low-melting constituents of the base material in the region closest to the fusion boundary often
melt during processing, resulting in a zone that is partially melted. This region forms a narrow band
around the fusion zone (Figure 5.1). Partial melting is most pervasive along grain boundaries due
to a higher concentration of impurities but may also occur within the grains. It occurs for portions
of the base alloy where the temperature falls within the solidus–liquidus range or for low-melting
second-phase particles or inclusions.
Under conditions of partial melting, tensile residual stresses that develop as the part begins to
cool can cause separation of material, resulting in hot cracking (Section 5.2.2.1), which is normally
intergranular. The impact of the partially melted region is reduced in processes where the total heat
input is low, such as in laser processing. Reduction in concentration of elements that tend to increase
the freezing temperature range of an alloy would also minimize damage in this zone. Finally, the
low-melting constituents are normally distributed along the grain boundaries. A reduction in the
average grain size, which increases the grain boundary area, would therefore reduce the concentra￾tion of the low-melting constituents, thereby minimizing their impact.
5.1.3 Heat-Affected Zone
The HAZ is the portion of the base material which does not melt, but where the temperature rise is
high enough to affect the microstructure and mechanical properties of the material (Figure 5.1). The
microstructure that develops in this region depends on the following:
1. The thermal cycle.
2. The type of material (its metallurgical and thermal properties).
3. The state of the material prior to processing (prior thermal and mechanical history).
For this discussion, we group the materials of interest into three main categories:
1. Pure metals.
2. Precipitation-hardening and nonferrous alloys.
3. Steels.
5.1.3.1 Pure Metals The HAZ microstructure obtained on processing a pure metal such as cop￾per depends on whether the material is originally in the annealed state or is work-hardened. An
annealed material will only experience grain growth in this area (Figure 5.13a), that is, there will
be no recrystallization since rearrangement of dislocations to form new boundaries is essential for
recrystallization. However, a previously work-hardened material will be recrystallized with new
grains being nucleated and therefore has a fine grain structure at the outer edge of the HAZ where the
temperature is just above the recrystallization temperature (Figure 5.13b). The grain size increases
toward the fusion boundary, and a coarse grain structure is almost always inevitable close to the
fusion boundary.
The growth kinetics of the grains is expressed as:

The importance of grain structure stems from its influence on the mechanical properties of the
component (strength and toughness). A fine grain structure results in an increase in the strength
of the material. For a pure material where there are no second-phase particles, inclusions, or other
microconstituents, the yield stress of the material, Sy, is related to the average grain size D by the
Hall–Petch equation:
Sy = 𝜎i + kyD−1∕2 (5.18)
where 𝜎i is frictional resistance of the lattice to moving dislocations and ky is a constant.
This is illustrated in Figure 5.14 for copper. The dependence of the yield strength on average grain
size is more complex for alloys, since other factors also affect the yield strength.
Example 5.3 From Figure 5.14, obtain the Hall–Petch equation for copper.
Solution:
The Hall–Petch equation is given by:
Sy = 𝜎i + kyD−1∕2
where 𝜎i is the intercept on the Sy axis and ky is the slope of the Sy – D−1/2 line.
By extrapolating the line in Figure 5.14 to the Sy axis, we find the intercept to be about 20 MPa.
Thus, 𝜎i = 20 MPa.
The slope mg of the line is estimated from the graph to be
mg = (80 − 20) MPa
(0.3 − 0) μm−1∕2 = 200 MPa μm1∕2
The Hall–Petch equation for this copper is thus given by:

5.1.3.2 Precipitation-Hardening and Nonferrous Alloys The HAZ in the case of precipitation￾hardening materials, such as aluminum–copper alloys, normally consists of two regions
(Figure 5.15):
a. There is the inner or solutionized zone, that is, material very close to the fusion zone, where
the very high temperatures result in the material transforming into a single-phase solid solution.
The new phase results in new grains being nucleated, and these grow as a result of the high
temperatures. This weakens the strength of material close to the fusion line, making the strength
equivalent to that of an annealed material. Irrespective of the initial condition of the material close
to the fusion line, that region will be solution-treated and quenched and therefore relatively soft,
of course, with the coarse grain structure persisting.
b. Slightly farther away from the fusion boundary, there is the outer or overaged zone where the
material will have been heated to just a high enough temperature to result in recrystallization
with an equiaxed fine grain structure if the material was previously cold-worked. Otherwise, grain
growth will occur in this zone. Next to this zone, the unaffected base material will have the original
structure of the material.
If the material had been previously aged, then it would become solution treated close to the fusion
zone and overaged farther away. To avoid overaging, processing may be done before solution treating
and aging. However, this is a difficult approach, due to the inconvenience of heat-treating large
structures in furnaces and also potential distortion of the structure. Low-heat-input laser and electron
beam processes reduce the overaging effect.

on the HAZ grain structure. This is followed by a discussion on the HAZ microstructure of three

of a previously work-hardened material (Figure 5.16):
a. One region is due to recrystallization after transformation to the higher temperature crystal struc￾ture, for example, low austenite region. This normally occurs in the temperature range between
723 ∘C and 900 ∘C of the steel, closer to the fusion zone. In this region, the steels become either
fully or partially austenitized. For the sections that are fully austenitized, new grains are nucle￾ated, resulting in a relatively fine grain structure in the entire section. However, in the regions that
are only partially austenitized, it is the newly formed austenite phase that produces a refined grain
structure as new grains are nucleated, while the untransformed ferrite phase essentially maintains
the original grain structure, with a possible slight growth. Thus, only partial grain refining would
occur in this section. In either case, the high temperatures in the immediate vicinity of the fusion
zone result in a tendency toward grain growth that may result in weakening in strength of material
close to the fusion line.
b. The other region corresponds to recrystallization of the low-temperature crystal structure, that is,
high ferrite region, approximately 700 ∘C depending on the type of steel. An equiaxed fine grain
structure may be formed here. This is the outer zone next to the base material. If the steel is not
work-hardened before being processed, then there will be no recrystallization, and the original
grains will simply continue to grow in this region.
Low-Carbon Steels During cooling of polymorphic materials such as steels, additional phase trans￾formation may occur in the solid state. This would often result in a new microstructure being gener￾ated that obliterates the microstructure that was generated during solidification. However, the original
grain structure may exist in conjunction with new grains that are formed in the new phase.
For low-carbon, low-alloy steels, acicular ferrite may form. This has randomly oriented short
ferrite needles and provides increased resistance to crack propagation, thereby increasing the fracture
toughness of the steel. On the other hand, bainite reduces the fracture toughness of the material.
Bainite and martensite are more likely to form with increasing carbon content and/or cooling rate.
The coarse grain structure that develops close to the fusion zone may result in a material with
strength equivalent to that of an annealed material. Normally, the high cooling rates that occur
close to the fusion zone, along with the coarse grain structure in that region, result in the forma￾tion of acicular ferrite along grain boundaries. Even though the low-carbon steels do not readily

form martensite, the cooling rates that accompany high-intensity (laser or electron beam) processes
can produce martensite in the HAZ. The low carbon content tends to reduce the hardness of any
martensite that may be formed. Furthermore, it raises the martensite start temperature such that any
martensite formed is tempered during cooling (auto-tempering), thereby softening it. However, if the
cooling rate is fast enough, there is insufficient time for the resulting martensite to be auto-tempered
and it consequently remains as hard martensite. On the other hand, if the cooling rate is very low,
the ferrite formed in the initial stages of cooling rejects carbon into the surrounding austenite which
may thus subsequently transform into hard martensite since its carbon content is then high. Thus, the
cooling rate for such steels have to be intermediate.
The portions of the workpiece which are heated to temperatures equivalent to that between the
eutectoid temperature and the lower austenite temperature experience partial transformation, with
the pearlite phase transforming to austenite which is embedded within the untransformed ferrite
matrix. Subsequent cooling of the part may result in the patches of austenite transforming to hard
bainite or martensite, embedded in softer ferrite matrix.
High-Carbon and High-Alloy Steels For hardenable steels such as high-carbon or high-alloy steels,
the relatively high cooling rates in the region closest to the fusion line usually transform material in
this region to martensite.
Hardenability refers to the ease with which martensite forms. It does not refer to the hardness or
strength of the steel. Plain carbon steels, for example, have low hardenability and as such, only very
high cooling rates can produce martensite in them. On the other hand, even air cooling may result in
the formation of martensite in some high-carbon or high-alloy steels.
Since different alloying elements affect the hardenability of a steel differently, a simple way of
estimating the hardenability or susceptibility of a given steel to cracking is to determine its carbon
equivalent (CE). This combines the impact of all the alloying elements into a single carbon frac￾tion that provides, in a nutshell, an estimate of the material’s hardenability. The carbon equivalent
relationship depends on the alloying elements, and there are various forms of it. A commonly used
expression is
CE = C +
Mn
6 +
Cr + Mo + V
5 +
Ni + Cu
15 (5.19)
The variables are expressed in percentage by weight. Preheating or postweld heat treatment is
often not necessary for materials with a carbon equivalent less than 0.35%. Preheating is normally
required when the carbon equivalent is between 0.35 and 0.55%, while for a CE greater than 0.55%,
both pre- and postheat treatments are necessary.
Stainless Steels The corrosion resistance of iron increases as its chromium content increases, since
the chromium enables a thin, protective surface layer of chromium oxide to be formed on the surface
when the material is exposed to oxygen. Stainless steels are essentially iron–chromium alloys which
are corrosion-resistant to an extent that depends on the alloying elements of the steel. Common
alloying elements include nickel, carbon, and molybdenum, and the types and amounts of theses
alloying elements determine the type of the stainless steel. There are three principal types:
(1) Ferritic stainless steels.
(2) Austenitic stainless steels.
(3) Martensitic stainless steels.
Each of these behaves differently in the HAZ, and they are briefly described in the following
paragraphs.❦
❦ ❦
❦
194 THE MICROSTRUCTURE
Ferritic Stainless Steels This type of stainless steel (Fe-Cr) has a relatively low carbon content
(less than 0.12% C) and a high chromium content (12–30% Cr). With this alloy content, the material
remains partially or completely ferritic at high temperatures. An example is Type 430. The high
chromium content gives it high corrosion resistance, even though it also makes it relatively more
expensive.
Ferritic stainless steels experience severe embrittlement when held in the temperature range of
450–550 ∘C for some time, resulting in a loss in toughness and increase in hardness. The only way
to remove the embrittlement involves reheating the material to a higher temperature and quenching
through this temperature range. As a result, this type of stainless steel is not appropriate for parts
that need to be welded, since the portion of the part that is heated to this temperature range will have
poor properties.
Another problem encountered when ferritic stainless steels are processed with a heat source is the
extensive grain growth that occurs, since there is no phase change to produce a refined grain structure,
as the material is heated in the solid state. Thus, in this material, grain refinement can only be induced
by cold working followed by recrystallization, which is not convenient for parts that are already
processed. Finally, ferritic stainless steels that contain more than 16% Cr also encounter sensitization
(see the next subsection on Austenitic Stainless Steels) when heated above 925 ∘C. This type of
sensitization is not effectively subdued by lowering the carbon content or rapid quenching from
above the sensitization temperature, as is commonly done for austenitic stainless steels. However,
additions of niobium and/or titanium can suppress the sensitization problem.
Austenitic Stainless Steels Stainless steels with a relatively high chromium content and
significant amounts of nickel (Fe-Cr-Ni), typically 18% Cr and 8% Ni stabilize the austenite phase
to the point that it still exists even at room temperature. Thus, such alloys cannot be hardened by
heat treatment and are only hardened by cold working. An example is Type 301. When this type
of stainless steel is cold-worked, the unstable austenite is transformed into martensite, significantly
increasing its strength.
When austenitic stainless steels are heated between 425 and 800 ∘C, carbon tends to react with
chromium to form chromium carbide, Cr23C6, and the reaction is most rapid around 650 ∘C. Thus,
in the regions of the HAZ which are heated to this temperature range, chromium carbide is precipi￾tated, usually at the grain boundaries. This phenomenon is called sensitization and induces corrosion
(Figure 5.17), for two reasons:
1. An electrolytic cell is formed at the grain boundaries.
2. The material loses corrosion resistance along grain boundaries due to a significant reduction
in the amount of free chromium.
Sensitization can be prevented by:
1. Reheating the part that has been processed to about 1100 ∘C to redissolve the chromium car￾bide and cooling fast to prevent the carbide from precipitating again. However, distortion

DISCONTINUITIES 195
of the part that sometimes results from quenching often makes this treatment undesirable.
Furthermore, if the structure being processed is cumbersome, then the heat treatment process
becomes unfeasible.
2. Reducing the carbon content of the alloy to say 0.03% C so that little chromium is tied up as
chromium carbide. An example is Type 304, which is easy to weld.
3. Adding niobium or titanium that has a greater affinity for carbon than does chromium, thus
having all the available carbon tied up leaving the chromium free in solution. Examples are
Type 347 which contains niobium, and Type 321 which contains titanium. However, the HAZ
of Types 321 and 347 can still suffer attack if subjected to severe corrosive conditions after
heating above 1100 ∘C and 1300 ∘C, respectively. This is because the Ti and Nb carbides go
into solution when held at those temperatures, resulting in subsequent chromium carbide pre￾cipitation along grain boundaries in a narrow zone close to the fusion boundary. The resulting
corrosion is referred to as knife-line attack. This type of problem can be eliminated by limiting
the carbon content to less than 0.03% C.
Due to the relatively low solubility of sulfur in austenite, austenitic stainless steels tend to have
a high susceptibility to hot cracking (Section 5.2.2.1). This crack sensitivity is minimized by intro￾ducing small amounts of 𝛿-ferrite, say 5–10%, to form a duplex structure containing a mixture of
ferrite and austenite, since ferrite has a greater solubility for sulfur.
Elements which tend to stabilize the austenite phase include carbon, nickel, manganese, and nitro￾gen, while those which promote the formation of ferrite are chromium, niobium, aluminum, silicon,
and molybdenum.
Martensitic Stainless Steels Martensitic stainless steels normally have chromium in the range
12 to 18%, and carbon in the range 0.15 to 1.20%. An example is Type 410, and most of them form
martensite on air-cooling from the austenite. They usually encounter severe temper embrittlement
when heated in the temperature range 370–600 ∘C.
5.2 DISCONTINUITIES
Discontinuities are normally introduced into a part during processing. As defects (i.e. result in
rejectable condition), they are undesirable as they reduce the mechanical properties of the material.
They thus influence the safety and performance of the part. There are various types of disconti￾nuities, and the principal ones include porosity and cracking, which are metallurgical; incomplete
penetration, lack of fusion, and undercutting, which are process- and technique-related (Figure 5.18).
It is sometimes also useful to identify discontinuities by geometry, that is, whether they are pla￾nar (two-dimensional) or volumetric (three-dimensional). The planar types include cracks, lack of
fusion, and incomplete penetration, and these tend to have a much greater damaging effect than do
the volumetric types. The volumetric types include porosity. The closer a given discontinuity is to the
surface, the more detrimental it can be to the integrity of the part. Furthermore, if the discontinuity is
oriented such that the applied stress tends to open it up, then its damaging effect is greater than one
that is oriented otherwise. Temperature, stress state, time, and service environment do have signifi￾cant influence on defects. Modes of failure include plastic deformation, fatigue, fracture, corrosion,
and creep.
In the following sections, the principal discontinuities are discussed.
5.2.1 Porosity
Porosity is the existence of gas pores or pockets within the fusion zone (Figure 5.19) and may
be defined as cavity-type discontinuities (voids) formed by gas entrapment during solidification.❦

Figure 5.19 Porosity in the fusion zone.
It basically arises from the absorption of gases into the melt (droplet or pool) and subsequent release
of part of the gases by the molten metal during cooling due to reduced solubility in the solid. Surface
contamination (e.g. oils, moisture, and paint) is a major source of the gases that cause porosity. Gases
may also be released by chemical reactions in the molten metal. Oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen are
the principal sources of porosity and are absorbed atomically.
The rate of solidification of the molten pool has a pronounced effect on porosity formation. Poros￾ity formation proceeds by nucleation and growth just as occurs during solidification. The bubbles
that escape to the surface if the growth rate exceeds the solidification rate, and they are trapped as
pores if the reverse is true. Porosity is usually most severe in the initial stages of a process, since the
conditions are not steady during that period.
Oxygen may be introduced into the molten metal by oxides on filler material or on the base
material. It may also be introduced from the atmosphere. The presence of oxygen in the molten pool
has two effects. One involves oxidation of the fused metal to produce material with poor properties.
The other involves a reaction with carbon in the case of steel to form carbon monoxide which is
trapped in the fusion zone. The influence of oxygen may be minimized by adding deoxidants, for
example, manganese, silicon, or aluminum to any filler metal used. The oxides so produced are much
less damaging than the porous structure that would otherwise result. However, excess deoxidants may
reduce the mechanical properties of the fusion zone. The oxides formed when aluminum is used as
a deoxidant tend to stay in the fusion zone and give it poor mechanical properties. The addition of
silicon and manganese along with aluminum tends to produce oxides which float and are therefore
removed with slag.
Hydrogen may, in addition to the porosity, also makes the fusion zone and HAZ brittle. It is
considered as the principal cause of porosity when welding steels and aluminum. This is because
there is a significant difference in the solubility of hydrogen in the molten metal at high temperatures
and its solubility at the melting temperature. The excess hydrogen may be released in the molten pool❦
❦ ❦
❦
DISCONTINUITIES 197
as it cools. Hydrogen may enter the molten pool from the atmosphere. Moisture absorbed by oxides
on the surfaces of filler rod and workpiece and humidity in the air are often the main sources of
hydrogen and oxygen. The water vapor dissociates to form hydrogen and oxygen. Thus for highly
reactive materials like aluminum and magnesium, any filler materials to be used need to be protected
from the atmosphere until used or cleaned before being used.
Brasses are difficult to weld due to volatilization of the zinc alloying element, which may result
in porosity and also affect visibility. Copper oxide reacts with hydrogen to release steam, which
may induce porosity in the fusion zone unless the copper is deoxidized by adding phosphorus and/or
silicon, manganese, titanium, and aluminum.
The most suitable traditional method for detecting porosity after processing is the radiographic
technique, followed by the ultrasonic inspection method. Liquid penetrant, magnetic particle, and
visual inspection are useful only when the pores appear on the surface. Porosity levels up to about
7% by volume generally do not have any significant influence on the tensile properties of the part.
However, the ductility tends to reduce slightly with increasing porosity, the effect being more pro￾nounced as the strength of the material increases. Failure in fatigue is influenced by porosity only
when any reinforcement that is present is removed, and surface porosity tends to be more damaging
than buried ones. A reinforcement is the portion of the fusion zone that projects above the workpiece
surface. More often than not, it results from filler material that is added to the molten pool.
5.2.2 Cracking
In this section, we discuss the basic concepts of cracking that occurs during and after processing.
Cracking is the most damaging of all the defects. The principal forms of cracking are as follows:
1. Hot cracking.
2. Liquation cracking.
3. Cold cracking.
Cracking may occur in either the fusion zone, the HAZ, or both (Figures 5.20 and 5.21). The crack
location, in the case of carbon steels, is influenced by the hardenability of both the fusion zone and
base metal. The cracks may be in the form of centerline cracks if the fusion zone and base metal
compositions are about the same and the workpiece is not severely restrained. This is because the
highest cooling rate occurs along the centerline. On the other hand, in situations where a filler metal
is used and its carbon content is lower than that of the base metal, the overall carbon content and thus
hardenability of the resulting fusion zone are lower than that of the base metal. The coarse-grained
region of the HAZ then tends to be more susceptible to crack formation, resulting in cracks appearing
in the HAZ instead.
Cracks could be formed either during the process, that is, soon after solidification (hot cracking)
or after the bead has cooled to room temperature (cold cracking), and may continue for several hours,
days, or even longer. Hot cracking is more prevalent in the fusion zone, whereas cold cracking occurs
more commonly in the HAZ. The principal factor inducing cracking is the residual stresses that are
set up as the fusion zone contracts during cooling. The stresses are tensile in the fusion zone and
gradually change to balancing compressive stresses in the surrounding material.
Cracks are unfortunately difficult to detect using conventional nondestructive evaluation tech￾niques due to its planar form. Ultrasonic testing is the best method for off-line detection of embedded
cracks, but when other forms of discontinuity exist, it becomes difficult distinguishing between them.
For real-time or online detection, acoustic emission, audible sound, and infrared/ultraviolet detection
have been found to be effective.❦

5.2.2.1 Hot Cracking Hot cracking usually occurs in the fusion zone either during or immediately
after solidification, in the temperature range of about 200–300 ∘C below the melting temperature.
It results primarily from low-melting constituents that are capable of wetting the grain boundaries
and which form either interdendritic or intergranular liquid films. The segregation of these films
results in localized regions of weakness along the grain boundaries and between dendrites which
rupture under the tensile residual stresses that develop as the part cools down. This produces inter￾dendritic or intergranular cracks, that is, the cracks occur in between grains or dendrites, or along
their boundaries, instead of occurring within the grains or dendrites themselves. They often develop
along the centerline also. The incipient cracks may heal if there is adequate molten metal near the
cracks to backfill them. Due to their high-temperature occurrence, hot cracks exposed to the surface
can often be identified by an oxide coating that discolorates the crack surfaces. Whether a crack is❦
❦ ❦

DISCONTINUITIES 199
formed or not depends on the type of intergranular films formed, the microstructure (that is, whether
it is coarse or fine), and the residual stresses developed in those regions. Fine equiaxed grains tend
to have greater resistance to hot cracking than do coarse columnar grains, since the low-melting
constituents are then distributed over a wider surface area, and thus are in lower concentrations.
Contaminants such as oils that are left on the base metal may also contribute to hot cracking.
In steels, non-metallic alloying elements such as sulfur, phosphorus, and boron that tend to
promote the formation of low-melting integranular films (which are capable of wetting the grain
boundaries) make the material more susceptible to hot cracking. Sulfur forms iron sulfide, FeS,
which dissolves in the molten steel and increases the freezing range between the solidus and liquidus
considerably. Furthermore, the surface tension between the molten iron sulfide and the solid grains
is low, resulting in wetting of the grain boundaries, that is, the formation of a liquid film. With traces
of low-melting phases rich in sulfur still existing in liquid form at relatively low temperatures when
significant residual stresses are set up, hot cracking can easily occur. Hot cracking will generally
not occur if the sulfur and phosphorus content is less than 0.06%. An increase in the carbon content
also increases the cracking tendency, as it increases the freezing range. Nickel has a similar effect,
especially in concentrations above 3%. Thus, fusion welds are difficult when the nickel content
exceeds 4%.
The solubility of sulfur in austenite is less than in ferrite. There is therefore a greater tendency for
the liquid grain boundary film to form and cause cracking in austenitic steels than in ferritic steels,
since the sulfur is more likely to segregate and form weak regions in the former. Addition of austenite
stabilizers such as carbon, nickel, and copper to steels thus makes them more crack-susceptible.
Manganese tends to make the sulfides globular and thereby prevents cracking when used in the
right amounts. This is because it does not dissolve in molten steel or increase the freezing range and
is therefore not dispersed as an intergranular film. As the carbon content of the steel increases, so
must the manganese-to-sulfur ratio to prevent hot cracking. However, at high carbon contents, say
greater than 0.3% C, higher ratios of manganese to sulfur are no longer effective.
Hot cracking in nonferrous alloys may occur for compositions that fall in regions of the phase
diagram with a high temperature range between the liquidus and solidus lines, that is, a long freezing
range. Under such circumstances, there is a greater tendency for the formation of low-melting phases.
The sensitivity of the aluminum–silicon alloy (4000 series), for example, to solidification crack￾ing increases with increasing silicon composition, peaking at about 0.5% silicon and then decreases
with further increases in the silicon content. Aluminum–magnesium alloys (5000 series) are also sen￾sitive to hot cracking. In the case of magnesium, zinc (4–6%) and calcium are the alloying elements
that result in the highest susceptibility to hot cracking, while manganese, aluminum, and zirconium
alloying elements do not present significant hot cracking problems. The presence of contaminants
such as oil and paint on the surface of nickel workpieces are often the source of low-melting con￾stituents which may result in hot cracking or liquation cracking in welding nickel and its alloys.
Adequate cleaning of such materials is thus essential for defect-free welding. The high affinity of
the reactive metals such as titanium and zirconium to oxygen and nitrogen makes them difficult to
weld, since they result in embrittlement of the joint and may also induce porosity. Thus, with such
materials, it is often necessary to introduce shielding gas on both sides of the joint.
The tendency for hot cracking may be minimized by:
1. Adequate cleaning of the workpiece to eliminate surface contaminants such as oil and paint.
2. Improved design to minimize constraint effect and thus residual stresses.
3. Using material with low cracking sensitivity.
5.2.2.2 Liquation Cracking Sometimes, complex carbides or low-melting intermetallic com￾pounds that result from segregation may melt to produce local grain boundary films or regions of❦

localized brittleness in the zone of partial melting during processing. This is especially likely in
the temperature range between the solidus and liquidus curves, even though the bulk of material
in that region may still be solid. Under sufficiently high residual stresses, cracks may open
up in these regions, causing liquation cracking. Liquation cracking may result from sulfur and
phosphorus-forming grain boundary liquation in steels, or niobium-forming eutectic patches. In
the former case, the addition of manganese does not alleviate the problem. The only solution is to
limit the amounts of sulfur and phosphorus in the steel to very low amounts. For aluminum, the
Al-Mg-Zn alloys or duralumin are most susceptible to this form of cracking.
Hot cracking involves material that is initially completely molten and is thus common in the
fusion zone, whereas liquation cracking involves partial melting, and is most common in the HAZ
or zone of partial melting.
5.2.2.3 Cold Cracking The high cooling rates that occur during processing may result in
brittleness in both the fusion zone and portions of the HAZ. The brittleness is even more likely
in steels when martensite is formed. These factors, along with the presence of hydrogen, promote
crack formation in steels, which may start soon after solidification and continue for some days
afterward. This type of crack normally occurs after the material has cooled to relatively low
temperatures and is thus referred to as cold cracking.
Cold cracking is usually transgranular in nature but may sometimes also be intergranular. It may
appear at the surface of the part, for example, toe cracks, or remain hidden beneath the fusion zone
as underbead cracks (Figures 5.20 and 5.21). It is generally induced by the following:
1. Hardening due to rapid cooling (martensite formation).
2. Residual stresses that are set up in the part.
3. Embrittlement by hydrogen (is enhanced by a moist atmosphere).
4. Existence of hot cracks.
Residual stresses are often introduced in processes that involve a heat source. The formation of
cold cracks thus depends primarily on the cooling rate (formation of martensite) and the presence
of hydrogen, for steels. Without hydrogen, cold cracking is less likely to occur in steels. Materials
with high martensite start and martensite finish temperatures have a lower susceptibility to cold
cracking, since there is a drastic reduction in the solubility of hydrogen when transformation occurs
from austenite to martensite. Also, at the higher temperatures, there is a greater tendency for the
supersaturated hydrogen to diffuse out. Furthermore, the higher transformation temperature enables
the marternsite formed to be tempered to some extent, thereby reducing the associated hardness and
residual stresses.
Increasing the hydrogen content of the shielding gas has been shown to directly increase the
extent of cold cracking. Hydrogen may be introduced through moisture on electrodes and workpiece
or from the atmosphere. Its influence is twofold:
1. Causing porosity.
2. Embrittlement.
Even though the presence of hydrogen is almost always essential for cold cracking to occur,
a high-carbon high alloy steel that is highly restrained can result in cracking in a virtually
hydrogen-free atmosphere.
Cold cracking may be prevented by:
1. Preheating to reduce the cooling rate (Chapter 4) and thus minimize the formation of marten￾site in steels (preheating also helps to remove moisture).❦
❦ ❦
❦
DISCONTINUITIES 201
2. Postweld heat treatment (about 550–650 ∘C for steels) to soften any martensite formed and
help hydrogen diffuse out (also helps remove residual stresses).
3. Improved design to minimize constraint effect and thus residual stresses.
4. Using material with low cracking sensitivity, for example, low-carbon steels.
Preheating is about the most commonly used method for preventing cracking when processing
high hardenability materials. Conventional preheating and postweld heat treatment involve either
heating the workpiece in a furnace before processing or using an induction or flame heater. For the
latter two methods, the heating is often applied locally. In the case of furnace heating, the entire
workpiece is heated to the preheat temperature, which is about 250 ∘C for a number of steels. These
methods are often either too expensive or impractical to use. For laser welding, a more convenient
approach may involve using a second laser beam to either preheat the joint or postweld heat treat the
fusion zone during the process (Section 10.7.1.1).
5.2.3 Lack of Fusion
When the heat supply is not adequate, it may result in lack of fusion of the molten region
(Figure 5.22), where there is no fusion between the fusion zone and base material. Lack of fusion
may also be caused by flooding of molten metal in front of the heat source. It is more commonly
observed in processing pure copper because of the high thermal conductivity which results in most
of the heat supplied being lost to the surrounding material, but can be minimized or eliminated by
preheating the workpiece before processing.
Ultrasonic inspection is most suited for identifying lack of fusion, since this type of discontinuity
can be either planar or volumetric. Radiographic inspection will detect the volumetric ones but not the
more planar type. It is generally considered that up to 10% lack of fusion will not have a significant
effect on the tensile properties. However, for a part loaded in fatigue and which has the reinforcement
removed and no postweld heat treatment, a 10% reduction in area due to lack of fusion is known to
reduce the fatigue strength by about 50%. Lack of fusion is most damaging at a weld face or root.
5.2.4 Incomplete Penetration
Incomplete penetration occurs when the filler and base metals do not fuse at the weld root
(Figure 5.23). The discontinuity is referred to as such only when the penetration is less than the
Figure 5.22 Lack of fusion.❦

design specification. It is usually caused by low heat input. The inspection techniques and effect
on properties are essentially the same as for lack of fusion. Incomplete penetration reduces the
load-carrying capacity of the part.
5.2.5 Undercut
This is the portion of the base metal that is melted but not filled (Figure 5.24) and forms a groove.
It is usually a region of high stress concentration at the weld toe. High processing speed is a common
cause of undercutting, since under these conditions, the filler metal being deposited does not have
sufficient time to flow to the toe. Conditions that induce a marked convex contour of the fusion zone,
such as material with high surface tension, also enhance undercutting. These tend to draw the molten
metal in the molten pool upward and to the rear, away from the sides of the bead, with the result that
a positive meniscus develops and the molten metal fails to wet the sides of the joint. It is generally
not harmful unless the part is subjected to severe fatigue loading conditions.
5.3 SUMMARY
In this chapter, we discussed the basic microstructural changes that occur in a material as a result of
laser processing and were broken down into two main sections:
• Process microstructure.
• Discontinuity formation.
Under process microstructure, there are four major zones that result after processing: the fusion
zone, zone of partial melting, HAZ, and base metal. Solidification in the fusion zone involves nucle￾ation and growth. The concept of epitaxial solidification, which is common with laser processes that❦
❦ ❦
❦
APPENDIX 5.A 203
result in melting without the addition of filler material, involves solidification without nucleation.
In conventional solidification, a critical radius and a critical free energy change are necessary to
form a stable nucleus. The two common modes of nucleation are homogeneous and heterogeneous
nucleation. After a stable nucleus is formed and begins to grow, the structure that results in the
fusion zone may be one of four types: planar, cellular, dendritic columnar, or dendritic equiaxed.
The microstructure varies from a planar to a cellular or dentritic structure as one moves from the
fusion boundary toward the centerline due to changes in solidification rate and temperature gradient.
In addition to the general structure, the grain orientation also depends on the direction of maxi￾mum temperature gradient and the preferred crystallographic growth direction. A higher cooling
rate produces a finer grain structure and also a smaller spacing between the dendrite arms, which
in turn results in greater strength, better ductility, and better toughness. A finer grain structure can
also be produced by inoculation, a process that involves the introduction of fine particles into the
molten pool.
The zone of partial melting, which is next to the fusion zone, results primarily from low-melting
impurities. Next to it is the HAZ, where no melting occurs, but the microstructure is changed by the
heat flow. If the material is previously cold-worked, recrystallization occurs in this zone, resulting
in a fine grain structure that increases in size toward the fusion boundary. Precipitation-hardening
alloys and allotropic materials such as steel may exhibit two recrystallized regions in the HAZ.
If the material is not cold-worked, then the original grains grow in size toward the fusion boundary.
Ferritic and martensitic stainless steels may encounter severe embrittlement during processing, while
austenitic steels may be subjected to sensitization.
Finally, the principal types of discontinuities that can occur during laser processing were dis￾cussed, specifically porosity, cracking (hot cracking, liquation cracking, and cold cracking), lack
of fusion, incomplete penetration, and undercutting. Cracking is quite likely in high-carbon and
high-alloy steels unless they are preheated before being processed.

negative and there is a greater driving force for the transformation to proceed. The lower the
temperature, the greater will be the driving force. Thus, one would expect the shape of the
top part of a T–T–T diagram (Figure P5.3) (above the nose) to be logical, since the lower the

6 Solidification
Solidification is important in laser processing, since the behavior of the molten pool during solidifi￾cation determines the fusion zone grain shape and size, microstructure, defects, and ultimately, the
mechanical properties of the part. In Chapter 5, we briefly outlined the basic concepts of solidifica￾tion, focusing on nucleation. The criterion that determines which structure prevails in the solidified
material was also introduced. Our focus in this chapter will be on growth, on the assumption that
nucleation has already taken place.
For processes where local equilibrium is maintained at the solid–liquid interface, conventional
solidification theory is directly applicable. However, for those processes that result in rapid solidifi￾cation, such theories may not be directly applicable. For completeness, we shall discuss both types
of solidification systems, starting with conventional solidification processes. Under conventional
solidification, we start with the simpler case of solidification without flow, where we first address
solidification of a pure metal, followed by that of a binary alloy. As part of our discussion on binary
alloy solidification, we further discuss the conditions that lead to the formation of different types
of microstructures (planar, cellular, and dendritic), and also the mushy zone (where solid and liquid
coexist). Then we provide some insight on the basic concepts of solidification with flow. Finally, we
outline the specific issues associated with rapid solidification.
6.1 SOLIDIFICATION WITHOUT FLOW
6.1.1 Solidification of a Pure Metal
We start the discussion by considering the simplest case, the classical Stefan problem. This involves
a one-dimensional analysis of the solidification of either a pure metal or binary melt of eutectic com￾position. Let us consider a semi-infinite liquid material of initial uniform temperature, T0. Now let
the base of the material be suddenly placed in contact with a chilled surface of constant temperature,
Tc at time t = 0, such that Tc <Tm, where Tm is the melting temperature of the liquid material. We
set up a coordinate system as shown in Figure 6.1 with origin at the chilled surface, x = 0. Since
we are considering a pure metal or eutectic, the composition of the solid that forms and that of the
liquid are identical, so composition does not influence solidification. We further assume that there
is no flow in the liquid and neglect any density differences that might exist between the solid and
liquid phases.
The problem is one of determining the temperature field, T(x, t), in the solid and liquid phases,
and also the motion of the solid–liquid interface, s(t). Since this is a pure metal, the interface is a

T → T0 (x → ∞) (6.2c)
where the subscripts s and l indicate solid and liquid, respectively, and Tc is the temperature of the
chilled surface.
Another boundary condition is given by the need to have conservation of heat flux (energy bal￾ance) at the interface between the liquid and solid phases:
Lmvux = ksGTs − klGTl (6.2d)
where GTs = dT

|s+ is temperature
gradient in the liquid at the interface, Lmv is the latent heat of solidification (melting) per unit volume
of solid, and ux = ṡ = SR is the interface velocity.
Equation (6.2d) implies that the net difference between the heat fluxes in the solid and liquid
phases at the interface is the rate of release of the latent heat of solidification. Very few analytical
solutions exist for Eqs. (6.1a–6.2b), and they are normally solved using numerical methods. The
temperature field that results from their solution is of the form as shown in Figure 6.1.
The discussion thus far has focused on a pure material where solidification occurs at constant
temperature, and the evolution of latent heat occurs as a step change. Most materials used in practice,
however, are alloys. The solidification process for such materials takes place over a temperature
range, between the liquidus and solidus (or eutectic) temperatures. The latent heat that evolves then
has a functional relationship with temperature. In the next section, we discuss the solidification of
alloys, focusing on the simpler but yet very common type, a binary alloy.❦

SOLIDIFICATION WITHOUT FLOW 211
6.1.2 Solidification of a Binary Alloy
In this section, we first discuss the simple case where the solidification interface is planar. This will be
followed by a detailed discussion of the conditions that lead to interface instability. Finally, the mushy
zone that exists between the completely solid and completely liquid interfaces will be discussed.
6.1.2.1 Temperature and Concentration Variation in a Solidifying Alloy Let us consider a setup
identical to that of the pure metal solidification, except that the material is now an alloy of two
elements. We make the following assumptions:
1. The composition of the solid does not change.
2. The solid–liquid interface is flat and distinct, that is, there is no mushy zone.
3. There is no convection in the liquid.
4. Transport occurs only by molecular diffusion and is one-dimensional.
5. Local thermodynamic equilibrium exists. That means the concentration of solute in the solid
and liquid sides of the interface is given by the equilibrium phase diagram.
The governing heat conduction equations are the same as for a pure metal, Eqs. (6.1a) and (6.1b),
with the thermal boundary conditions, Eqs. (6.2a–6.2c), and the thermal conservation condition,
Eq. (6.2d).
As solidification proceeds, solute is rejected from the interface into the liquid. Thus, in addition
to the energy Eqs. (6.1a and 6.1b), we must also have a solute transport equation that describes the
solute concentration in the liquid and is given by:
dC
dt = 𝜕
𝜕x
(
Dl
𝜕C
𝜕x
)
(x ≥ s(t)) (6.3)
where C is the solute concentration (%) and Dl is the diffusion coefficient of the solute in the liquid,
(m2/s).
Considering conservation of solute at the interface, we have the following boundary condition:
uxC + Dl
dC
dx
|
|
|
|s+
= 0 (x = s(t)+) (6.4)
The other boundary and initial conditions are
C → C0 (x → ∞)
C = C0 (t = 0)
where C0 is the initial liquid composition.
Since solidification occurs under local thermodynamic equilibrium, the solute concentration at
the interface and solidification or melting temperature are coupled by a simplified relationship of
the form:
T = −mgC + b (6.5)
where mg is the absolute value of the slope of the liquidus curve, which is approximated as a
straight line.
Numerical solution of Eqs. (6.3–6.5) along with (6.1a–6.2b) gives temperature and concentration
profiles of the form as shown in Figure 6.2.
For the ideal situation described in the preceding paragraphs, the temperature gradient is in
the direction of crystal growth. The solid–liquid interface is thus planar and moves with a steady❦

velocity, ux. The process is then one-dimensional, and the solute and temperature fields vary only in
the growth direction. If the liquid state is quiescent (that is, at rest), the concentration and temperature
extending ahead of the interface are exponential.
As briefly discussed in Section 5.1.1.2, the interface that develops during solidification of noneu￾tectic alloy compositions is not always flat (planar) as assumed but may become cellular or dendritic
as a result of instabilities associated with perturbations at the interface.
6.1.2.2 Interface Stability Theories There are two classes of theory that are used in analyzing
interface instability, or the conditions under which deviations from the planar interface will occur.
These are
1. The constitutional supercooling theory.
2. The morphological stability theory.
The basic principles of each approach are outlined in the following sections.
Constitutional Supercooling Theory This is normally used for solidification processes that occur
at low interface velocities and is based on thermodynamics principles. The rationale is to determine
whether the liquid ahead of a moving interface is undercooled with respect to its composition. Such
undercooling may result from rejection of solute by the growing solid and tends to make the interface
unstable, resulting in the formation of cells or dendrites that protrude into the liquid. The planar
interface may be shown to be stable if
ksGTs + klGTl > mgGc(ks + kl)f(A, kp) (6.6)
where A = k2

is the solute concentration gra￾dient at the interface in the unperturbed liquid, neglecting diffusion in the solid, kp is the equilibrium
partition coefficient, Tm is the interface melting temperature in the absence of solute and curvature,
and 𝛾 e is the interface surface energy.
Typically, solidification velocities are such that A ≪ 1, in which case f(A, kp)≈1. The stability
criterion then reduces to the form:
ksGTs + klGTl > mgGc(ks + kl) or ksGTs + klGTl > mg

which can be simplified by assuming GTs ≈ GTl, giving
GTl

or GTl > mguxC0
Dl
(kp − 1)
kp
(6.8)
On the contrary, at high solidification velocitiesf(A, kp) = 0, since A cannot exceed 1. The stability
criterion then becomes
ksGTs + klGTl > 0 (6.9)
The constitutional supercooling criterion, represented by Eqs. (6.7) or (6.8), is illustrated in
Figure 5.7 as the line between the planar and cellular regions. In the planar region, the actual temper￾ature gradient in the liquid is greater than the equilibrium temperature gradient as obtained from the
right-hand side of Eq. (6.8), and thus planar growth is morphologically stable. In the cellular region,
the solute-gradient effect dominates, and the actual temperature gradient is less than that given by
the right-hand side of Eq. (6.8). This results in chance protuberances becoming pronounced, leading
to cellular growth, which results in microsegregation. At yet higher interface velocities relative to
the temperature gradient, or higher solute concentrations, growth becomes dendritic.
The constitutional supercooling theory is a limiting case of the more general theory of morpho￾logical stability and is adequate for a number of conventional solidification processes where local
equilibrium conditions hold, and the solidification rates are relatively low. However, since it neglects
surface tension effects and latent heat evolution, both of which have a stabilizing effect on the inter￾face, it is generally not adequate for modeling rapid solidification processes. In fact, Eq. (6.7) predicts
a less stable interface as the interface velocity increases, which contradicts experimental results that
show stable flat interface morphologies at high interface velocities. For such cases, the morphological
stability theory, which incorporates surface energy effects, is more appropriate.
Morphological Stability Theory. The morphological stability and constitutional supercooling
theories predict the same outcome for a significant number of conventional solidification processes.
However, the morphological stability theory predicts a more stable interface during rapid solidifica￾tion due to the stabilizing influence of surface tension and latent heat evolution.
Let us assume a perturbation at the solidification front of the form:
x = 𝛿e(𝜔tt+i𝜔yy+i𝜔zz) (6.10)
where 𝛿 is the amplitude of perturbation at time t = 0, 𝜔t is the temporal frequency, and 𝜔y and 𝜔z
are spatial frequencies.
Using a linear time-dependent stability analysis, it can be shown that the interface is stable when
the real part of 𝜔t is negative for all perturbations. The value of 𝜔t can be obtained by solving the
steady-state heat flow and diffusion equations with appropriate boundary conditions. In other words,
the interface is stable with respect to infinitesimal perturbations when

214 SOLIDIFICATION
The first term of Eq. (6.11) is due to the solute concentration, the second due to capillary effects,
and the third due to thermal effects. The interface is stable when the inequality is satisfied. The solute
term thus tends to make the interface unstable, while the capillary term tends to prevent the growth
of a perturbation, and since the thermal term may be either positive or negative, it can be either
stabilizing or destabilizing, depending on whether the numerator is negative or positive, that is, if
GTs is sufficiently positive.
It can be shown that the morphological stability criterion, Eq. (6.11), reduces to the constitutional
supercooling criterion, Eq. (6.7), in the limiting case when the interface velocity is very low, and
when capillary effects are neglected. The relationship between the constitutional and morphological
stability criteria is illustrated in Figure 6.3. It shows the critical concentration of copper below which
interface stability occurs for different interface velocities in directional solidification of an Al–Cu
alloy.

6.1.2.3 Mushy Zone As opposed to the solidification of pure materials, binary alloys do not
exhibit a distinct front separating the solid and liquid phases. During solidification of actual alloys,
three regions exist in the overall solidification domain. These include the solid and liquid phases and
in between them is the mushy zone. The latter is a region of finite size where solid and liquid coexist
and is bounded by the liquidus and solidus (or eutectic) curves. For simplicity, we assume that the
mushy zone exists between the interface and the base surface (Figure 6.4). We further assume that
the volume fraction, fs, of the solid in the mushy zone is constant. The governing equations for the
temperature field are then given by:

where the overbar indicates properties in the mushy region and are based on averages weighted by
the volume fraction. For example,
k = fsks + flkl (6.16)
and is an appropriate approximation for a random mixture of solid and liquid. Here, f stands for
volume fraction.
The solid in the mushy region is assumed to be of constant concentration, while the interstitial
liquid concentration corresponds to that of the liquidus temperature:
T = −mgC + b (0 < x ≤ s(t)) (6.17)
The concentration of the liquid phase is also assumed to be equal to its original concentration,
since diffusion effects are considered negligible:
C = C0 ( x ≥ s(t)) (6.18)
For global conservation of solute (i.e. the total amount of solute must be conserved), we have

zone, while that of Eq. (6.21) represents the release of solute into the interstitial fluid. The boundary
condition for the spatial derivative of the solid volume fraction is given by:
𝜕T
𝜕x = −mg
𝜕C
𝜕x (x = s(t)+) (6.22)
which corresponds to equilibrium saturation in the liquid just ahead of the growing dendrites.
Since there are two phases, a natural approach to modeling such a system is to develop separate
governing equations for each phase (solid and liquid in this case) and then couple the two sets of
equations using boundary conditions at the interface. This is the approach that has thus far been
used in this section and is commonly referred to as the multiple domain method. Incorporation of
the volume fraction of each phase into the governing equations enables the mushy zone to be ana￾lyzed. However, the interfacial geometry between the solid and liquid phases is quite complex, and
it is also an unknown function of space and time for which a solution needs to be obtained. The
two-phase approach is thus very difficult to use for all but the simplest configurations such as pure
materials. To circumvent this problem and simplify the analysis, one-phase or continuum models can
be developed from the two-phase governing equations, resulting in the entire domain being treated
as a single region governed by one set of conservation equations, which are valid for the liquid and
solid regions, as well as the mushy zone. Thus, with the continuum models, it is not necessary to
track the interface, and there is no need for boundary conditions internal to the solidifying medium.
They are therefore suitable for analyzing alloys. The formulation for the continuum models is based
on volume-averaging techniques where the microscopic equations, which are valid for each phase,
are integrated over a small volume element. Classical mixture theory is also used.
6.2 SOLIDIFICATION WITH FLOW
The discussion in the preceding section focused on solidification in a liquid medium where no flow
occurs. In a number of applications such as cladding, significant flow occurs in the liquid medium as it
solidifies. Such flow may be due to either natural convection (from the solidification process itself) or
forced convection (induced by external factors). In either case, the resulting motion in the melt does
affect the solidification process. Natural convection results from buoyancy forces that are caused by
density variations within the fluid. Such variations in density may be induced by either temperature
or compositional (solutal) gradients that occur during the process. Compositional gradients result
from solute rejection into the liquid. Thus, we can have thermal or solutal buoyancy, or both.
In such situations where flow occurs in the solidification medium, the governing equations are
1. Mass.
2. Momentum.
3. Energy.
4. Solute concentration equations.❦
❦ ❦

SOLIDIFICATION WITH FLOW 217
For simplicity, we make the following assumptions:
1. Flow is Newtonian and laminar.
2. The properties of each phase are homogeneous and isotropic.
3. Local thermodynamic equilibrium exists at the solid–liquid interface, that is, at the interface,
T = Ts = Tl and Cs = kp Cl.
4. Negligible field disturbances such as dispersion fluxes and surpercooling of the liquid.
5. Saturated mixture conditions exist, that is, fs + fl =1. That means there cannot be void forma￾tion. Void formation occurs when 𝜌s > 𝜌l.
6. Solid phase is free of internal stresses and does not deform. Internal stresses develop when
𝜌s < 𝜌l.
7. Negligible solute diffusion in the solid.
We also note that there are two principal driving forces that influence flow in the molten pool
during laser processing, and these are as follows:
1. Buoyancy forces, which are accounted for in the momentum equations to be discussed shortly.
2. Shear and pressure that act on the pool surface as a result of surface tension gradient and
surface curvature. These are modeled as boundary conditions of the governing equations.
Since three-dimensional analysis can be computationally intensive, we simplify things by only
considering two-dimensional analysis. The governing equations for the one-phase or continuum
model are then given by:
Conservation of mass: The general form of the governing equation for mass conservation is
𝜕𝜌
𝜕t
+ ∇ ⋅ (𝜌u) = 0 (6.23)
where u is the velocity vector.
Momentum equations: The momentum equations are modified by a concentration term, and for
two-dimensional analysis, they become
𝜕
𝜕t
(𝜌ux)+∇ ⋅ (𝜌uux)=−𝜕P
𝜕x + ∇ ⋅ (𝜇∇ux) + Fx (6.24a)
𝜕
𝜕t
(𝜌uz)+∇ ⋅ (𝜌uuz)=−𝜕P
𝜕z
+ ∇ ⋅ (𝜇∇uz) + Fz − 𝜌g[𝛽T(T − T0) + 𝛽c(Cl − C0)] (6.24b)
where 𝛽T is the thermal volume expansion coefficient (/K), 𝛽c is the solutal volume expansion coef￾ficient (/%), g is the acceleration due to gravity (m/s2), P is the pressure (Pa (N/m2)), Fx and Fz are
the external body forces in the x and z directions, respectively (N/m3), 𝜇 is the viscosity (Pa s), ux
and uz are the magnitudes of velocities in the x and z directions, respectively (m/s), and T0 and C0
are the reference (usually eutectic) temperature and concentration, respectively.
The last term on the right-hand side of Eq. (6.24b) is the force due to thermal and solutal buoyancy.
Enthalpy (energy) conservation: For convenience, the energy equation is expressed in terms of
enthalpy, he:

Solute concentration: The equation for solute concentration is expressed as:
𝜕
𝜕t
(𝜌C)+∇ ⋅ (𝜌uC)=∇ ⋅ (D∇C) + Sc (6.26)
where Sh and Sc are enthalpy and concentration source terms, respectively.
In this formulation, the enthalpy, he, is defined as:
he = ∫
T
0
cpsdT (6.27a)
Thus,
hs = he and hl = he + 𝛿he (6.27b)
𝛿he = ∫
T
0
(cpl − cps)dT + Lm (6.27c)
where cpl and cps are the specific heats of the liquid and solid, respectively (J/kg K), hl and hs are
the enthalpies of the liquid and solid, respectively (J/kg), and Lm is the latent heat of fusion per unit
mass (J/kg).
The exact form of the one-phase model that is used depends on the nature of the mushy zone.
Thus, at this point, we consider two limiting cases:
1. Mushy fluid.
2. Columnar dendritic structure.
6.2.1 Mushy Fluid
This type of mushy zone is similar to granular solid particles that are dispersed within a liquid
medium (Figure 6.5). It is more commonly found in the equiaxed zone of some metals and also in
amorphous materials such as glasses and waxes. Both the solid and liquid phases then have the same
velocity, and as such, this model is sometimes referred to as the no relative motion model:
u = ul = us (6.24)
where ul and us are the liquid and solid velocities, respectively.

SOLIDIFICATION WITH FLOW 219
Since the volume fraction of the solid varies in the mushy zone, an effective viscosity, 𝜇, is used
at any location as:
𝜇 = fs𝜇s + fl𝜇l (6.25)
where fs and fl are the solid and liquid volume fractions, respectively, and are related to the respective
mass fractions, ms and ml, by:
𝜌ms = 𝜌sfs and 𝜌ml = 𝜌lfl (6.29a)
where 𝜌l and 𝜌s are the liquid and solid densities, respectively, and 𝜌 is the overall mixture density
and is given by:
𝜌 = 𝜌sfs + 𝜌lfl (6.29b)
Since there is no flow in the fully solid region, the velocity there has to be zero. In other words, the
system velocity has to approach zero as the local liquid fraction approaches zero. This is normally
achieved by specifying a very large solid viscosity, 𝜇s, say of the order of 108, such that as the solid
volume fraction tends to unity, the effective viscosity 𝜇 dominates the momentum equations and
eventually reduces the velocity u to zero when fully solidified. The momentum equations for this
case are given by:

concentration is given by:

𝜕t
(𝜌C)+∇ ⋅ (𝜌uC)=∇ ⋅ (𝜌D∇C)+∇ ⋅ (𝜌D∇(Cl − C)) (6.32)
6.2.2 Columnar Dendritic Structure
The columnar dendritic structure is such that the solid and liquid phases are distinct (Figure 6.6),
with the solid having a specified velocity which may or may not be zero, and is definitely different
from the liquid velocity. The model that results from this formulation is sometimes referred to as the
relative motion model. Laser spot welding is an example of the case with zero solid velocity, while
laser seam welding is for the case with nonzero solid velocity.
This structure is essentially similar to a porous medium, and as such, flow in the mushy zone is
considered to be governed by Darcy’s law. This effect is accounted for by modifying the momentum
equations to account for flow in the porous medium and requires the following assumptions:
1. The solid is free of internal stresses.
2. Viscous stresses resulting from local density gradients are small.
3. The density in each phase is constant.

velocity and is set to zero for static phase change systems, or to a constant value for continuous phase

RAPID SOLIDIFICATION 221

6.3 RAPID SOLIDIFICATION
Rapid solidification results when the rate at which the molten material cools is so high that its
temperature falls significantly below its equilibrium freezing temperature, resulting in extensive
undercooling before solidification begins. The process then occurs under nonequilibrium conditions
with a high solidification velocity, and the interface temperature becomes a function of time and
process parameters. The assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium is then invalid.
Some of the benefits of rapid solidification include
1. Fine grain structure and solidification substructure (dendrite and cell spacing).
2. Reduced microsegregation.
3. Extended solubility of alloying elements.
4. Metastable crystalline and amorphous phases – rapid solidification is the basis for obtaining
surface modification of materials using a laser beam.
There are two extreme heat flow conditions that are associated with rapid solidification. In one
case, the molten material is superheated, and so the heat of fusion is withdrawn through the solid,
and the interface velocity is controlled primarily by the rate of external heat extraction. This would
be the case for surface melting and melt spinning, for example, where the interface velocity is limited
by the rate of heat extraction to the substrate, and the material thickness.
In the other case, the molten material is supercooled and thus acts as an effective heat sink, quickly
removing any released latent heat. Crystal growth kinetics then become the main limiting factor.
However, the latent heat that is released at the interface as solidification proceeds may result in
reheating of the molten material to a temperature close to the equilibrium solidification temperature,
thereby reducing the growth rate of the freezing front (interface velocity). This is referred to as
recalescence and may result in microsegregation, reduced supersaturation, and phase segregation.
The interface velocity for this case is determined primarily by the extent of supercooling, and the
heat loss to the surroundings does not significantly affect the solidification process in the initial stages
but may become significant as solidification proceeds.
These are illustrated in the enthalpy-temperature diagram (Figure 6.7). Equilibrium solidification
essentially follows the isothermal path. Here, the latent heat that is released is used to maintain the
specimen’s temperature at the equilibrium value until solidification is completed.
The conditions under which local thermodynamic equilibrium are valid may be approximated by
considering the diffusive velocity, uD, of the solute in the liquid, which may be defined as:
uD = Di
la
(6.37)
where la is the interatomic spacing and Di is the coefficient of interdiffusion across the interface.
As the interface velocity approaches the diffusive velocity, the solidification front begins over￾taking the solute atoms, at which point local thermodynamic equilibrium is no more valid at the
interface. Complete solute trapping results as the interface velocity exceeds the diffusive velocity.
Generally, as conditions depart from local equilibrium interface stability is enhanced.❦

6.4 SUMMARY
The emphasis in this chapter has been on the growth component of the solidification process, having
covered the nucleation process in Chapter 5. For a pure metal without flow, the solidification interface
is planar. That of an alloy may break down to form a cellular, columnar dendritic, or equiaxed den￾dritic structure as a result of instability associated with the process. The instability of the interface
can be analyzed using either the constitutional supercooling theory or the morphological stability
theory. Whereas the stability criterion based on the constitutional supercooling theory depends only
on the temperature gradients in the liquid and solid at the interface, that of the morphological sta￾bility theory also takes into account the solute concentration as well as capillary effects. It is shown
that the solute term tends to make the interface unstable, while the capillary term tends to prevent
the growth of a perturbation, and since the thermal term may be either positive or negative, it can be
either stabilizing or destabilizing. For analysis in the mushy zone, similar governing equations are
used, except that they are modified to account for the solid volume fraction.
When solidification occurs under conditions involving flow, the analysis also includes mass and
momentum conservation equations. The analysis is simplified by considering the mushy zone as
either a mushy fluid (which is similar to granular solid particles that are dispersed within a liquid
medium) or a columnar dendritic structure (where the solid and liquid phases are distinct, with the
solid having a specified velocity which may or may not be zero, and is different from the liquid
velocity).
With rapid solidification, which is the more likely scenario in laser processes that involve a large
mass which acts as a heat sink, there are two extreme heat flow conditions:
1. One case where the molten material is superheated, which is also the more likely case for laser
processing.
2. Another case where the molten material is supercooled.❦

7 Residual Stresses and Distortion
Residual stresses are stresses that continue to exist in a material even when there are no external
forces acting on it. They are produced in a number of ways, for example, during welding, grinding,
forming, and heat treatment (especially when martensite is formed due to volumetric change, as
austenite transforms to martensite). Residual stresses are important because they affect the strength
of the part, either positively or negatively, and may also result in distortion.
Our discussion in this chapter starts with the fundamental causes of residual stresses, focusing
on thermal stresses and nonuniform plastic deformation. This is followed by a basic stress analysis
to explain the underlying mechanisms of residual stresses. The effects of residual stresses are then
outlined, specifically strength effects and distortion. A discussion on techniques for measuring resid￾ual stresses (stress relaxation, X-ray diffraction, and neutron diffraction) then follows, and finally,
methods for relieving residual stresses and distortion.
7.1 CAUSES OF RESIDUAL STRESSES
Two principal causes of residual stresses in materials processing are as follows:
1. Thermal stresses.
2. Nonuniform plastic deformation.
Our discussion will focus on these two causes. Other causes of residual stresses are nuclear radiation
and electromagnetic field exposure.
7.1.1 Thermal Stresses
To illustrate the development of residual stresses as a result of temperature changes, let us consider
three rods of equal length which are rigidly connected together at the top and bottom (Figure 7.1).
Now, let the middle rod, 2, be heated uniformly to a high temperature and cooled. As it is heated, it
tends to expand. If it were free, it would expand by an amount ΔL, given by:
ΔL = 𝛽lL0ΔT (7.1)
where L0 is the original length of the rod, 𝛽l is the linear coefficient of thermal expansion of the rod
material (/K), and ΔT is the temperature rise in the rod.

However, it is prevented from doing so by the other two unheated rods. This results in compressive
stress being induced in 2, while tensile stresses are induced in 1 and 3. Before the yield strength of
the material is reached, the elastic strain (𝜀e) induced in 2 is given by:
𝜀e = ΔL
L0
= 𝛽lΔT (7.2a)
which results in a compressive elastic stress of
𝜎 = Em𝛽lΔT (7.2b)
where Em is Young’s modulus.
The stress magnitude in 2 keeps increasing with temperature until the yield stress in compression
is reached (point Q) (Figure 7.2). At this time, plastic flow occurs. Beyond this point, the additional
strain that is experienced, the plastic strain, 𝜀p, is given by:
𝜀p = 𝛽lΔT − Sy
Em
(7.3)
where Sy is the yield strength of the material.
Since the yield strength decreases with increasing temperature, the stress in 2 decreases with
further increase in temperature (QR).
On cooling, 2 tends to contract and again is restrained by 1 and 3. Since it is cooling, the yield
strength increases as the temperature reduces further, and the stress in the rod becomes elastic. It
quickly reduces in compressive stress and then becomes tensile, the tensile stress increasing elasti￾cally with further cooling until yielding (point S). Thus, at room temperature, rod 2 will be subjected
to tensile residual stress, while 1 and 3 will be in compression. The residual stresses so produced are
also called thermal stresses.
For a specific example in laser processing, we consider the development of residual stresses during
welding. A schematic of a weld bead in progress along with temperature and stress distribution at
various points along the bead are shown in Figure 7.3 at points A, B, C, and D.
Far ahead of the heat source at A–A, the temperature and stress distributions are zero. At section
B–B, which passes through the heat source, very high temperatures exist in the immediate vicinity of
the weld, and this tapers off to low temperatures away from the weld. Since the molten metal cannot
endure stress, stresses in the weld are zero. Slightly farther off, there are low compressive stresses
since the heated material close to the weld is prevented from expanding. Also, the yield stress is❦

low at the high temperatures and that makes the stresses low. Yet farther away, tensile stresses are
developed that balance the compressive stresses close to the weld.
Behind the heat source, section C–C, lower temperatures exist in the weld bead, which then has
a more uniform temperature distribution. The cooling weld bead and material close to it tends to
contract, and this is prevented by the rest of the material. The result is tensile stresses in material
within and close to the bead and balancing compressive stresses further away.❦

Even further behind the heat source at section D–D, the temperatures are much lower, and the
stresses become more pronounced. The longitudinal stress distribution that results at room temper￾ature is shown in Figure 7.4. Important aspects of the longitudinal stress distribution (Figure 7.4b)
are as follows:
1. Maximum tensile stress, 𝜎m.
2. Width of the tensile region, b.
7.1.2 Nonuniform Plastic Deformation
To understand how residual stresses are introduced as a result of plastic deformation, let us first con￾sider a rod which is subjected to simple tension where the loading is high enough to produce uniform
plastic deformation throughout the rod. If the applied load is subsequently released before necking
occurs, there will be uniform elastic recovery throughout the rod. However, there will be permanent
deformation within it after the load is removed (Figure 7.5), but no residual stresses will exist.
Now consider the beam shown in Figure 7.6a, which is subjected to bending. The bending
moment, Minit, that will result in plastic deformation of the outer fibers is given by:
Minit = Sybh2

The stress distribution in the beam is then given by the dashed line (Figure 7.6b). Assuming an
elastic-perfectly plastic material, the stress distribution that results after full yield is given by the
solid line (Figure 7.6b). The resulting force on either side of the beam (either the upper or lower
half) is then given by Sybh/2. Since the distance between the resulting forces is h/2, the bending
moment My required to achieve full yield throughout the beam is
My = Sybh

If the external bending moment is now removed, elastic unloading occurs, and the stress distri￾bution that results from elastic unloading is given by the dashed line in Figure 7.7a. The resultant
stress distribution after unloading is obtained by superimposing the plastic stress distribution and
the unloading curves, giving the final stress distribution within the beam after the load is removed,
the residual stress (given by the solid line in Figure 7.7). The distribution in Figure 7.7a is the ideal
case. The actual distribution is more like the one shown in Figure 7.7b.❦

Next, we consider a small region which is plastically deformed in a body by say, indentation
(Figure 7.8). The immediate vicinity of the indentor will be subjected to plastic flow, and this will
be surrounded by a large compressive elastic field. On removing the indentor, elastic unloading
will occur, but there will be a permanent set (plastic strain that remains), which results in the dent
left behind. The end result will be elastic compressive stresses that are left after unloading. Residual
stresses due to nonuniform plastic deformation may thus result from hammering, rolling, dull cutting
tools, and eroding particles.

7.2.1 Stress–Strain Relations
Due to space constraints, we shall limit our discussion in this section to isotropic materials and also
to linear elastic behavior and plastic flow of metals.
7.2.1.1 Linear Elastic Behavior The stress–strain relations for linear elastic materials are given
by Hooke’s law:
𝜀x = 1
Em
[𝜎x − 𝜈p(𝜎y + 𝜎z)] (7.6a)
𝜀y = 1
Em
[𝜎y − 𝜈p(𝜎z + 𝜎x)] (7.6b)
𝜀z = 1
Em
[𝜎z − 𝜈p(𝜎x + 𝜎y)] (7.6c)
𝛾xy = 𝜏xy
G (7.6d)
𝛾yz = 𝜏yz
G (7.6e)
𝛾zx = 𝜏zx
G (7.6f)
where Em is Young’s modulus (N/m2), G is the shear modulus (N/m2), and 𝜈p is Poisson’s ratio (–).
Equations (7.6a–f) may also be written as:

where K is the bulk modulus for the material (N/m2).
Em, G, K, and 𝜈p are related by:
Em = 2G(1 + 𝜈p), Em = 3K(1 − 2𝜈p)
The first terms on the right-hand side of Eqs. (7.7a)–(7.7c) are associated with change in volume
of the element. This becomes evident when the three equations are added to give the volume change:
𝜀x + 𝜀y + 𝜀z = 1

The mean of the three normal stresses (𝜎x+𝜎y+𝜎z
3
)
is referred to as the hydrostatic stress. The
second terms in the expressions are associated with change in shape.
To calculate stresses from measured elastic strains, the equations can be rewritten in the form:
𝜎x = 𝜈pE
(1 + 𝜈p)(1 − 2𝜈p)
(𝜀x + 𝜀y + 𝜀z) + E
(1 + 𝜈p)
𝜀x (7.7g)
𝜎y = 𝜈pE

𝜎z = 𝜈pE
(1 + 𝜈p)(1 − 2𝜈p)
(𝜀x + 𝜀y + 𝜀z) + E

𝜀z (7.7i)
7.2.1.2 Plastic Flow of Metals In uniaxial loading such as occurs during a simple tensile test,
plastic flow or permanent deformation is known to occur when the yield stress is exceeded. For a
body that is subjected to a more general multiaxial stress state, a yield criterion is used to determine
when plastic flow occurs. One that is commonly used is the von Mises yield criterion, which in
simple terms states that
(𝜎1 − 𝜎2)
2 + (𝜎2 − 𝜎3)
2 + (𝜎3 − 𝜎1)
2 = Ck (7.8)
where 𝜎1, 𝜎2, and 𝜎3 are the principal stresses acting on any element and Ck is a constant (Pa2).
In a uniaxial tensile test, 𝜎1 is positive and 𝜎2 = 𝜎3 = 0. Furthermore, yielding occurs when
𝜎1 = Sy, where Sy is the yield strength of the material. Thus, from Eq. (7.8), Ck = 2Sy
2, giving
(𝜎1 − 𝜎2)
2 + (𝜎2 − 𝜎3)
2 + (𝜎3 − 𝜎1)
2 = 2Sy
2 (7.9a)
or in more general terms,
(𝜎x − 𝜎y)
2 + (𝜎y − 𝜎z)
2 + (𝜎z − 𝜎x)
2 + 6(𝜏xy
2 + 𝜏yz
2 + 𝜏zx2) = 2Sy
2 (7.9b)
To facilitate analysis, an effective stress, 𝜎, is defined such that it has the same effect as the
multiaxial stress state. Yielding or plastic flow occurs when its value reaches the yield strength, Sy.
Thus, considering the von Mises yield criterion,
𝜎 = 1
√
2
[(𝜎1 − 𝜎2)
2 + (𝜎2 − 𝜎3)
2 + (𝜎3 − 𝜎1)
2]
1∕2 (7.10)
or
𝜎 = 1
√
2
[(𝜎x − 𝜎y)
2 + (𝜎y − 𝜎z)
2 + (𝜎z − 𝜎x)
2 + 6(𝜏xy
2 + 𝜏yz
2 + 𝜏zx2)]1∕2 (7.11)
Yielding thus occurs when
𝜎 = Sy (7.12)
In linear elasticity, the current state of stress completely defines the state of strain. However,
the current state of stress cannot define the plastic strains measured from the virgin (e.g. annealed)
condition of the material. Any plastic deformation done before the current stresses were applied
would have to be known before the total plastic strains could be defined. The value of 𝜎 necessary❦
❦ ❦
❦
BASIC STRESS ANALYSIS 235
to maintain plastic flow thus depends on the sum of the effective plastic strain increments accrued
over the entire load path from the virgin condition of the material.
7.2.2 Plane Stress and Plane Strain
The discussion in Section 7.2.1 is based on a general three-dimensional analysis. To simplify subse￾quent discussions with respect to residual stresses, we outline the concepts of plane stress and plane
strain, which are valid for a number of engineering applications.
7.2.2.1 Plane Stress An example of a body under plane stress conditions is a relatively thin plate
which is subjected to a two-dimensional stress field. Consider a thin flat plate of uniform thickness
which is loaded such that the applied loads are parallel to the plane of the plate and are uniformly
distributed through its thickness (Figure 7.9). The state of stress on the top and bottom free surfaces
are such that
𝜎z = 𝜏zx = 𝜏zy = 0 (7.13)
Since the plate is assumed to be thin, this condition is considered to hold throughout the plate.
Thus, the only stresses that exist within the plate are 𝜎x, 𝜎y, and 𝜏xy, and are functions of x and y
alone. These are the assumptions of generalized plane stress.
7.2.2.2 Plane Strain Let us now consider a prismatic cylinder which has the same cross-sectional
area as the plate referred to in Section 7.2.2.1, and let it be subjected to the same uniform loading per
unit length in the z-direction (Figure 7.10). However, its thickness in the z-direction is much greater.
It is assumed that
1. Normal cross sections which were plane before loading remain plane after loading, that is,
they do not distort in the z-direction. In other words, the displacement 𝑤 in the z-direction is
a linear function of z alone.
2. All normal cross sections well away from the ends undergo the same deformation in the x–y
plane. In other words, the displacements u and v are functions of x and y alone.
These are the fundamental assumptions of plane strain and lead to the following equations:
𝜀z = constant at any z, 𝛾yz = 0, 𝛾zx = 0 (7.14a)
Thus, it can be shown that all the stresses are functions of x and y alone, and that
𝜏zx = 𝜏zy = 0 (7.14b)

7.2.2.3 Plane Stress/Plane Strain Equations Using the simplifications in the preceding sections,
the equilibrium equations for both plane stress and plane strain are given by:
𝜕𝜎x
𝜕x +
𝜕𝜏xy
𝜕y = 0 (7.15a)
𝜕𝜏xy
𝜕x +
𝜕𝜎y

𝜀y = 𝜕𝑣
𝜕y
(7.16b)
𝛾xy = 𝜕𝑣
𝜕x +
𝜕u
𝜕y
(7.16c)
7.2.2.4 Compatibility Equation The three strain components in Eq. (7.16a–c), 𝜀x, 𝜀y, 𝛾xy, are
functions of only two variables, u and v, and are therefore not independent. The compatibility
equation which the total strains must satisfy is given by:
𝜕2𝜀x
𝜕y2 +
𝜕2𝜀y
𝜕x2 = 𝜕2𝛾xy
𝜕x𝜕y
(7.17)
Residual stresses exist when the nonelastic (plastic, thermal, etc.) strain components do not
satisfy Eq. (7.17). Thus, an uneven distribution of plastic strains in a material results in residual
stresses.❦

EFFECTS OF RESIDUAL STRESSES 237
7.2.2.5 Stress–Strain Relations for Plane Stress/Plane Strain Here, we refocus our attention on
elastic deformation. The stress–strain relations for generalized plane stress and plane strain are as
follows:
Plane Stress:
2G𝜀x = 𝜎x − 𝜈p
1 + 𝜈p
(𝜎x + 𝜎y) (7.18a)
2G𝜀y = 𝜎y − 𝜈p
1 + 𝜈p
(𝜎x + 𝜎y) (7.18b)
G𝛾xy = 𝜏xy (7.18c)
Plane Strain:
2G𝜀x = 𝜎x − 𝜈p(𝜎x + 𝜎y) (7.19a)
2G𝜀y = 𝜎y − 𝜈p(𝜎x + 𝜎y) (7.19b)
𝜎z = Em𝜀z + 𝜈p(𝜎x + 𝜎y) (7.19c)
G𝛾xy = 𝜏xy (7.19d)
From Eqs. (7.18a–c) and (7.19a–d), it is obvious that a solution for stresses 𝜎x and 𝜎y under plane
stress conditions can be applied to plane strain if 𝜈p is replaced by 𝜈p/(1−𝜈p).
Example 7.1 Residual stresses obtained by measuring elastic strains recovered after a part is cut
are calculated for a plane stress, using Hooke’s law as follows:
𝜎x = − Em
1 − 𝜈p
2 (𝜀x
e + 𝜈p𝜀y
e
)
What is the reason for the negative sign in the expression?
Solution:
Because a region that is under tensile residual stress will contract when cut since the tensile stresses
arise because that region is prevented from contracting.
7.3 EFFECTS OF RESIDUAL STRESSES
The two primary effects of residual stresses are as follows:
1. Apparent change in the strength of a part.
2. Distortion of the part.
7.3.1 Apparent Change in Strength
Consider a relatively large diameter steel rod that is heated into the austenite range for a long enough
time for the temperature to become uniform throughout. If it is then quenched, tensile residual❦

stresses will be developed on the surface (Figure 7.11a), as a result of volume change associated
with the austenite to martensite (density of austenite is higher than that of martensite) and other
phase transformations that occur during quenching. Since tensile residual stresses then already exist
in the rod after heat treatment, if it is subsequently loaded in tension, it will yield at applied stresses
that are lower than the yield strength of the material. This is because the total stress on the rod surface
will be the sum of the existing residual stresses and the applied stress (Figure 7.11b). In essence, in
the elastic range, the residual stress can be added to the stress due to the applied external load. How￾ever, in the plastic region, the residual stress relaxes. This may result in a more uniform redistribution
of the stresses (Figure 7.12).
If a glass plate is uniformly heated and the surfaces subsequently air-cooled, compressive residual
stresses will be developed close to the surfaces (Figure 7.13), resulting in tempered glass. In this
case, there is no phase transformation and thus no volume change during cooling. The mechanism is
therefore similar to that discussed in Section 7.1.1. Such a plate can sustain higher bending moments,
since the tensile stresses on the outer surface that result from bending will be reduced by the existing
compressive residual stresses.
7.3.2 Distortion
When a material is subjected to heating and cooling during processing, thermal strains occur in
the vicinity of the heat source. The stresses that result from these strains combine and react to
produce internal forces that cause distortion, which is often evident as bending, buckling, and
rotation (Figure 7.14). Principal changes that result in distortion of a plate, for example, include the
following:
1. Transverse shrinkage perpendicular to the line along which the heat source moves
(Figure 7.14a).
2. Longitudinal shrinkage parallel to the heat source line of motion (Figure 7.14b).❦

3. Angular rotation about the heat source line of motion (Figure 7.14c). This is due primarily to
nonuniformity of transverse shrinkage in the z-direction.
4. Buckling distortion (Figure 7.14d). Thin plates may be subjected to buckling instability when
thermal compressive stresses are induced in them.
Actual distortion of structures tends to be more complex. Analysis of distortion is a coupled
problem that involves three basic issues:
1. Analysis of the temperature field. This is essentially a three-dimensional conduction heat trans￾fer problem involving a moving heat source.
2. Analysis of the plastic strains using the appropriate constitutive laws, incorporating
temperature-dependent thermal expansion coefficient, elastic modulus, and flow stress.
This would also involve a suitable yield criterion and restraint due to the geometry of the
structure.❦

3. Analysis of the distortion that results from the plastic strains. This involves consideration of
force and moment equilibrium, strain hardening, and flow stress.
We now discuss some of the common methods used in measuring residual stresses.
7.4 MEASUREMENT OF RESIDUAL STRESSES
Various methods are available for measuring residual stresses. The major ones include
1. Stress relaxation.
2. X-ray diffraction.
3. Neutron diffraction.
Others are the ultrasonic and magnetic techniques. We shall limit our discussion to the three
techniques listed. All three are based on the measurement of residual elastic strain. Residual stresses
are then computed from the measured strains. The discussion on the measurement of residual stresses
will be followed by a brief discussion on residual stress equilibrium, which can be used to check the
validity of any measurements that are made.
7.4.1 Stress Relaxation Techniques
The stress relaxation techniques involve measurement of elastic strain recovered when the part is
either cut into pieces or only parts are removed. Once the elastic strains are measured, the stresses❦
❦ ❦
❦
MEASUREMENT OF RESIDUAL STRESSES 241
that were acting under those strains can be calculated using Hooke’s law and considering the recovery
or unloading process through the stress–strain curve (Figure 7.5). Using Eq. (7.18a–c) for the plane
stress condition, we can express the residual stress in terms of the measured strains as:
𝜎x = − Em
1 − 𝜈p
2 (𝜀x
e + 𝜈p𝜀y

𝜎y = − Em
1 − 𝜈p
2 (𝜀y
e + 𝜈p𝜀x

) (7.20b)
𝜏xy = −G𝛾xy (7.20c)
The negative signs indicate that a part of the material that is subjected to tensile residual stresses
will contract when relaxed, that is, residual stresses are removed. The strains are measured using
strain gauges. The disadvantage with these techniques, however, is that they are destructive. How￾ever, they are very common and reliable methods. In this section, we discuss two primary types of
the stress relaxation technique:
1. The sectioning technique.
2. The drilling technique.
The sectioning and drilling techniques are relatively rapid and less destructive, compared to other
techniques such as the layer removal technique.
7.4.1.1 Sectioning Technique This is also sometimes referred to as the ring core method. With
this method, electrical resistance strain gages are mounted on the surface of the structure. A circular
disk piece that surrounds the strain gages is then removed by trepanning (Figure 7.15). The internal
diameter of the piece removed may range between 15 and 150 mm, and the depth between 25% and
150% of its internal diameter. The change in strains after removal are measured. For a small enough
disk, the removal may be assumed to have resulted in complete elastic recovery. Thus, the measured
strains are the elastic strains. Residual stresses can then be calculated using Hooke’s laws.
The sectioning technique is more sensitive than the drilling technique (Section 7.4.1.2), since
it almost relieves the surface strains entirely. In addition, it is insensitive to small errors in the
diameter or location of the annular hole relative to the strain gages. However, since the diameter is
relatively large, the measured stresses are not very localized. Furthermore, more damage is done to
the workpiece.
7.4.1.2 Drilling Technique The drilling technique is also known as the Mathar–Soete technique.
In this case, strain gages are placed in a star or rectangular arrangement, and a small hole then drilled
in the center of the arrangement (Figure 7.16). The hole diameter typically ranges between 1 and
4 mm and is drilled to a depth that is approximately equal to the diameter. Strain changes as measured
by the three gages are then used to calculate the stresses.
This method is less sensitive, since the strains that are relieved decay quite rapidly with distance
from the edge of the hole. Thus, the measured strains are only about 25–40% of the original residual
strains at the hole location. Furthermore, the calculated stresses are significantly affected by errors
in hole diameter or location. However, the hole drilling technique is more commonly used, since the
measured stresses are more localized and less damage is done to the workpiece. In Section 7.4.1.3,
we discuss how the measured strains can be converted to strains in cartesian coordinates.❦

7.4.1.3 Strain Analysis Consider the general case where strain gauges A, B, and C are mounted
on the surface of a part at angles 𝜃A, 𝜃B, and 𝜃C with respect to the x-axis (Figure 7.17).
The strains 𝜀x, 𝜀y, and 𝛾xy are then related to those measured by the strain gages, 𝜀A, 𝜀B, and
𝜀C as:
𝜀A = 𝜀x cos2𝜃A + 𝜀y sin2𝜃A + 𝛾xy sin 𝜃A cos 𝜃A (7.21a)
𝜀B = 𝜀x cos2𝜃B + 𝜀y sin2𝜃B + 𝛾xy sin 𝜃B cos 𝜃B (7.21b)
𝜀C = 𝜀x cos2𝜃C + 𝜀y sin2𝜃C + 𝛾xy sin 𝜃C cos 𝜃C (7.21c)
𝜀x, 𝜀y, and 𝛾xy can be calculated from Eq. (7.21a–c), from which the principal strains, 𝜀1 and 𝜀2 are
obtained as:

where 𝜙 is the angle between the maximum principal strain 𝜀1 (or maximum principal stress 𝜎1 if
the material is isotropic) and the x-axis.
Knowing the measured strains, the residual stresses can be estimated using Eq. (7.20a–c).
Example 7.2 The residual stresses at a point in a thin titanium plate that has been formed using a
laser are measured using a stress relaxation technique. The strain measurements obtained are shown
in the figure below. Assuming Poisson’s ratio to be 0.3, determine the maximum normal and shear
stresses acting at that point.

Solution:
From Appendix 7.B, Young’s modulus for titanium is 116 GPa. To simplify things, we set up a
coordinate system such that the x-axis is along Gage C. Then 𝜃C = 0∘, 𝜃A = 120∘, 𝜃B = 240∘. Thus,
𝜀C = 𝜀x = 1100 × 10−6

3𝛾xy)=−500
giving
𝜀y = −1300 × 10−6, 𝛾xy = 462 × 10−6

7.4.2 X-ray Diffraction Technique
The X-ray diffraction technique is primarily used to measure surface stresses, up to a depth of about
50 μm. It is mainly for materials with a crystalline structure. The unit cell of each crystalline structure
has lattice constants (lengths of the sides of the unit cell) which are characteristic of that material.
When the material is subjected to elastic strains, that results in changes in the lattice constants. Plastic
strains do not affect them since they result from dislocation motion. Thus, by measuring the lattice
constants of the stressed material, the corresponding elastic strains can be determined. The lattice
constants of the unstressed material are either known or are easily determined.
Measurement of the lattice constants is commonly made by X-ray diffraction. Advantages of this
method are as follows:
1. It is capable of measuring strains in areas as small as 3 μm in diameter.
2. It is nondestructive.
3. Even though earlier measurement systems were very slow, more recent systems can make
measurements in a few seconds or less.
However, it has the following disadvantages:
1. It is limited to surface stresses, up to about 2–50 μm from the surface.
2. Its accuracy is relatively low, especially for heat-treated parts with a distorted structure.
7.4.2.1 Principle of the X-ray Diffraction Technique This technique is based on Bragg’s law.
A beam of monochromatic radiation (AB and DF) incident on parallel atomic planes will be reflected
in the direction BC and FH as shown in Figure 7.18. For the waves reflected from adjacent paral￾lel atomic planes to reinforce each other, they must be out of phase by an integer (m) number of
wavelengths. Thus, for diffraction, that is, reinforcement,
EFG = m𝜆 (7.23)
where 𝜆 is the wavelength of incident beam (X-ray) (μm).Or we can say that
EF = m𝜆

246 RESIDUAL STRESSES AND DISTORTION
However,
EF = d sin 𝜃d (7.25)
where d is the inter-planar spacing and 𝜃d is the angle between incident beam and atomic
plane.Therefore,
m𝜆
2 = d sin 𝜃d (7.26)
or
m𝜆 = 2d sin 𝜃d (7.27)
Equation (7.27) is known as Bragg’s law. From it, the inter-planar spacing d can be calculated if
𝜆 and 𝜃d are known. Determining d also determines the lattice constants, ai.
For a metal with a cubic lattice such as a face-centered cubic or body-centered cubic structure,
the lattice constants are the same along all crystal axes, that is, ax = ay = az = a. Then, we have
d = a √
hm
2 + km
2 + lm
2
(7.28)
where hm, km, and lm are the Miller indices of the reflecting plane.
hm, km, and lm incorporate the integer m and give a measure of the intersection of the reflecting
plane on the crystal axes. In other words, m in Eq. (7.27) can be taken as 1. In reality, the Miller
indices are the reciprocals of the intercepts of the plane with the x-, y-, and z-axes.
Constructive interference (diffraction) is obtained for an X-ray beam incident on the surface of a
crystalline material when the beam meets lattice planes that are oriented in such a way that Bragg’s
law is fulfilled. Generally, a polycrystalline material will have some grains oriented suitably enough
to produce a diffracted beam.
Let the lattice spacing for a fine-grained and stress-free polycrystalline specimen of a given mate￾rial be d0, and that for a stressed specimen of the same material be d. The elastic strain to which the
specimen has been subjected can then be inferred from the change in crystal lattice as:
𝜀 = d − d0
d0
(7.29)
Two of the methods on which the X-ray diffraction technique is based are as follows:
1. The film technique.
2. The diffractometer technique.
7.4.2.2 The Film Technique With this method, the X-ray beam is passed through a collimator
and then directed toward the specimen (Figure 7.19). The reflected (or diffracted) beam is recorded
using a film. When the film is developed, it shows near-circular rings, with each set of rings corre￾sponding to an inter-planar distance, dhkl. For each ring, 𝜃d from Bragg’s law can be obtained using
the following relation:
H0
lx
= 2 tan(180 − 2𝜃d) (7.30)
where lx is the distance from the film to the specimen and H0 is the diameter of the diffraction ring.
The strain is then obtained using Eq. (7.29). The film technique, though accurate, is relatively
slow and thus not extensively used anymore.❦

7.4.2.3 The Diffractometer Technique In this case, the diffraction angle is measured by mov￾ing a counter and receiving slit along a goniometer circle to measure the reflected beam intensity
(Figure 7.20). The position of maximum beam intensity gives the diffraction angle. The major draw￾back of the diffractometer technique is that the specimen size is limited by equipment geometry.
However, it is more accurate and quicker than the film technique. A measurement can be made in a
few seconds or less. Thus, it is more widely used.
7.4.3 Neutron Diffraction Technique
The neutron diffraction technique is similar in principle to the X-ray diffraction technique. It is
also based on the measurement of lattice strains. The main difference is that due to the ability❦

of neutrons to penetrate more deeply into materials, neutron diffraction enables residual stresses
to be measured much deeper into the material, that is, within the volume of the material. Even
though the neutron beam may penetrate the entire volume, slits are used to define the local volume
(Figure 7.21).
With this technique, a neutron beam from a reactor is first converted to a monochromatic beam
of wavelength 𝜆, using for example, a germanium crystal. A specific direction is imparted to the
beam using a soller slit collimator. The cross-sectional area of the beam as it enters the sample and
also as it enters the detector is determined by the aperture of neutron-absorbing cadmium masks
(Figure 7.21), which are placed before and after the sample. The intersection of the incident and
diffracted beams is referred to as the gage volume. Measurement is obtained of the average strain
in grains that are properly oriented in a sample that is positioned completely within this volume.
Larger samples may be moved through the gage volume to obtain the strain at different locations
within it. The diffraction rings that result correspond to lattice planes that are oriented at an angle 𝜃d
to the incident beam. These are also the planes whose normals lie along the scattering vector. The
scattering vector, s, bisects the included angle between the incident and scattered beams. It is defined
by the wave vectors of the incident and scattered beams:
s = ki − ks (7.31)
where ki is the wave vector of the incident beam and ks is the wave vector of the scattered beam.
When 𝜃d is obtained, the strain is then determined using Eq. (7.29). Measurements are usually
made using either a crystal spectrometer or a time-of-flight diffractometer. A typical diffractometer
is illustrated in Figure 7.22.❦

7.4.4 Residual Stress Equilibrium
Since residual stresses exist within a body even when there are no external loads acting on the body,
the resultant force and moment of the residual stresses in a body must be zero. Thus, on any plane
section in the body, the following equations must hold
∫ 𝜎 ⋅ dA = 0 (7.32a)
∫ dM = 0 (7.32b)
where A is the area, M is the moment at any location, and 𝜎 is the stress at any point.
These equations can be used to validate experimentally determined residual stress data.
Example 7.3 The X-ray diffraction method is used to measure the residual stresses at a point
in a thin steel plate subjected to laser heat treatment. The material has a lattice constant of
3.008 × 10−7 mm. The wavelength of the X-ray is 1.54 × 10−7 mm and is diffracted on the {1 0 1}
planes. If uniaxial compressive stresses of 266 MPa are measured at a particular point, calculate the
diffraction angle 𝜃d obtained during measurement in degrees.
Solution:
Young’s modulus for steel is approximated as being the same as that for iron that, from Appendix 7.B,
is given by Em = 208 GPa.
𝜎 = Em𝜀
⇒ −266 × 106 = 208 × 109 × 𝜀

7.5 RELIEF OF RESIDUAL STRESSES AND DISTORTION
Methods for relieving residual stresses and distortion can be grouped into two general categories:
1. Thermal treatments.
2. Mechanical treatments.
7.5.1 Thermal Treatments
Thermal treatments that are normally used to relieve residual stresses in welding, for example,
include
1. Preheating.
2. Postheating.
7.5.1.1 Preheating Preheating involves heating the workpiece to a reasonably high temperature
before it is processed. The preheating temperature depends on the workpiece material. For example,
for ductile iron, this may be 650 ∘C, while for hardenable steels, it is normally 300 ∘C. A number of
methods are available for preheating. These include
1. Heating in a furnace.
2. Induction coil heating.❦
❦ ❦
❦
RELIEF OF RESIDUAL STRESSES AND DISTORTION 251
3. Using a hot air blast.
4. Using another laser beam or splitting the original beam (Section 10.7.1.1).
The preheated material results in less contraction stresses since it is softer, and thus, plastic flow
occurs more easily under the stresses that are developed, rather than shrinkage. Preheating also
reduces cooling rates that result from the process, thereby minimizing the formation of hard phases.
However, it has the disadvantage that if the preheating temperature is too high, it may
1. Cause corrosion in stainless steels.
2. Soften the material being processed.
3. Reduce the strength of a workpiece that has already been hardened by heat treatment.
7.5.1.2 Postheating The use of postheating to relieve residual stresses is essentially a recov￾ery/recrystallization process. The workpiece is heated to a temperature that depends on the material,
for a specified time. Any residual stresses that exist in the material are reduced to the yield strength
of the material at the treatment temperature. Subsequent cooling must be uniform throughout the
workpiece to prevent the development of additional thermal stresses. If the postheating temperature
is too high, undesirable properties may result. For carbon and low-alloy steels, stress relief is com￾monly performed between 1100 and 1350 ∘F. Postweld heat treatment is the most common method
for relieving residual stresses in weldments.
7.5.1.3 Limitations of Thermal Stress Relief These include the following:
1. Thermal treatment of stainless steel weldments may result in sensitization and embrittlement
as discussed in Section 5.1.3.3.
2. For low-carbon, high-strength steel weldments, reduction of strength and toughness in the
HAZ, or hydrogen embrittlement, or both may occur when thermally treated.
3. Thermal treatment of bimetallic and multimetallic components can create problems.
4. Workpiece configurations with large variations in wall thickness may result in thermal stresses.
5. Some components may be too large for furnaces.
6. Asymmetrically shaped workpieces may result in nonuniform temperature distribution during
cooling. Cooling rates can be slowed, but with increased costs.
7.5.2 Mechanical Treatments
Common mechanical treatments that are used in relieving residual stresses include
1. Peening.
2. Proof stressing.
3. Vibratory stress relief.
7.5.2.1 Peening Compressive residual stresses are induced in the surface layer of a material by
applying impact loading. Peening has traditionally been done by directing a hammer or stream of
small, high-velocity metal balls to the surface of the workpiece (shot peening). This is a cold work￾ing process. In recent years, lasers have been used to induce the same effect (laser shock peening,❦
❦ ❦
❦
252 RESIDUAL STRESSES AND DISTORTION
[Section 11.5]). In addition to reducing residual stresses and distortion, peening may also improve
the fatigue strength of the part, as a result of the compressive stresses that are induced. However,
it has the disadvantage that it may conceal or introduce cracks and may thereby reduce the fracture
toughness of the material.
7.5.2.2 Proof Stressing Proof stressing involves applying uniform loading to the entire work￾piece. This results in a reduction of the residual stresses and a more uniform distribution after
unloading (Figure 7.12). It serves as a means for stress relief and a test of structural integrity.
7.5.2.3 Vibratory Stress Relief This normally involves vibration of the part, usually at the natural
frequency, for a period that ranges from 10 to 30 minutes depending on the weight of the workpiece.
It is more economical than the thermal stress-relieving processes. The process induces yielding in
parts of the structure and thereby relieves stresses and reduces distortion.
7.6 SUMMARY
Our discussion in this chapter started with the basic causes of residual stresses, where thermal stresses
and nonuniform plastic deformation were identified as two of the major causes, with others being
nuclear radiation and exposure to electromagnetic fields. The residual stresses that result during
laser welding, for example, are thermal stresses and are tensile along the weld centerline, reducing
to balancing compressive stresses as one moves further away from the centerline. This was followed
by a basic discussion on stress analysis to lay the analytical framework for understanding residual
stresses. This included discussions on stress–strain relations and conditions of plane stress and plane
strain. Both elastic and plastic behaviors were presented, culminating in the compatibility equation,
which determines the conditions under which residual stresses would exist in a body. In linear elas￾ticity, the current state of stress completely defines the state of strain. However, the current state of
stress cannot define the plastic strains measured from the virgin (for example, annealed) condition
of the material. Any plastic deformation done before the current stresses were applied would have
to be known before the total plastic strains could be defined.
The impact that residual stresses have on a part were then discussed, focusing on two primary
effects: apparent change in strength and distortion. Depending on the nature of the residual stresses
(compressive or tensile), and the external loading that is applied, the strength of the part may either
be enhanced or reduced as the stresses due to external loading are superimposed on the existing
residual stresses. Following this, some of the major methods for measuring residual stresses were
discussed, focusing on the stress relaxation, X-ray diffraction, and neutron diffraction methods.
Under stress relaxation, which is destructive, the sectioning and drilling techniques were discussed.
Under X-ray diffraction, the basic principles leading up to the film and diffractometer techniques
were discussed, where the latter was identified as being the most commonly used method due to
its accuracy and speed of implementation. Since residual stresses exist within a body even when
there are no external loads acting on it, the resultant force and moment of the residual stresses in the
body must be zero. This may be used to check the efficacy of measurements that are made. Finally,
different methods for relieving residual stresses in a part were outlined, with the primary meth￾ods being identified as either thermal or mechanical based. The thermal methods include preheat￾ing and postheating, while the mechanical methods include peening, proof stressing, and vibratory
stress relief.❦

8 Background on Laser Processing
The laser beam is the heat source in laser materials processing. Even though the laser is normally
considered to be a light source, it is also a form of energy, and as such, can be a useful source of
intense heat when concentrated by focusing. Lasers are able to produce high-energy concentrations
because of their monochromatic, coherent, and low divergence properties as compared to an ordinary
light source. As a result, they can be used to heat, melt, and vaporize most materials. The processes
for which lasers are commonly used include welding, cutting, surface modification (including heat
treatment), forming, and additive manufacturing. The power densities and exposure times necessary
for various processes are shown in Figure 8.1. To provide a frame of reference, a comparison of
various heat sources is made in Table 8.1. For the laser beam, the highest power densities are achieved
with the beam in the Gaussian (TEM00) mode (Section 8.1.3).
In this chapter, we start with a general discussion on system-related parameters that have the
most significant effect on process output. The major stages of energy loss from the power drawn
from the mains supply to the actual power used in the process are then discussed in terms of process
efficiency. This is followed by a discussion on disturbances that affect process quality, and finally,
the advantages and disadvantages of laser processing in general are briefly presented.
8.1 SYSTEM-RELATED PARAMETERS
The principal system parameters that affect process quality include the beam power and power
density at the focal point, wavelength and focusing system, beam mode (distribution), beam form
(continuous wave (CW) or pulsed), and beam quality. Others include beam absorption, beam deliv￾ery, beam alignment, and the motion unit used for positioning the beam or workpiece. Our discussion
follows in that order. Some parameters such as beam polarization, assist and/or shielding gas, focal
point location, and traverse speed are more process-specific and are thus discussed in relation to
individual processes in subsequent chapters.
8.1.1 Power and Power Density
The power density at the focal point is determined by the incident power and the size of the focused
beam. For a Gaussian distributed laser beam, the beam size is defined as the radial distance at which
the intensity of the beam reduces to 1/e2 or 13.5% of the peak intensity. This is also the area which
has approximately 87.5% of the total beam energy. The power density, PD, is given by:
PD = q
𝜋w2 (8.1)
where q is the power of the laser beam (W) and w is the beam radius (mm).

8.1.2 Wavelength and Focusing
The wavelength of the beam influences the process in several ways, including absorption of the beam
and the extent of focusing. In this section, we shall discuss its influence on focusing. Its effect on
beam absorption will be separately addressed in Section 8.1.6.
When a Gaussian beam of radius w0 and wavelength 𝜆 is incident on a lens of focal length fl, it
is focused to a radius wf given by:
wf = 1
𝜋
(fl𝜆
w0
)
(8.2)
where w0 is the incident beam radius at the lens.
Equation (8.2) indicates that the power density at the focal point is inversely proportional to the
square of the wavelength. Thus, the smaller the wavelength of the beam, the higher the output power
density, all other conditions being equal. The shorter wavelength of the Nd:YAG laser (1.06 μm) thus
gives it some advantages over the CO2 laser (10.6 μm). For the same input power, beam mode, beam
size, and optics, the power density ratio of an Nd:YAG laser to a CO2 laser is 100. Equation (8.2) also❦

indicates that the greater the original beam diameter, the smaller the focused beam radius, and thus
the greater the power density of the focused beam. Therefore, an expander is often used to increase
the diameter of the beam incident on the focusing lens.
It is also evident from Eq. (8.2) that the shorter the focal length of the lens, the smaller is the
size of the focused beam, and thus the greater the power density. Thus in laser welding, the use of a
shorter focal length lens results in deeper penetration for the same beam power, especially at lower
power levels. At much higher power levels of say, 20 kW, there is little difference, if any, on the
impact of the focal length on penetration. The use of very short focal length lenses, however, has
two disadvantages:
1. The depth of focus is correspondingly small (Figure 8.2), requiring greater precision in main￾taining the lens to workpiece distance.
2. In welding, the shorter focal length lens is more liable to be damaged by vapor and molten
metal ejected from the weld.
Focal lengths normally used range from 2.5 in. (65 mm) to 10 in. (254 mm), but 7.5 in. (190 mm)
lenses are about the standard. Common lens materials include ZnSe, KCl, GaAs, and CdTe, and a
typical beam radius at the focal point would be 100 μm. For very long focal lengths (say, 200 mm
and over), a reflective parabolic copper mirror is often used for focusing.
The depth of focus,zf, of a focusing system is the distance over which the workpiece can be moved
from the original focal point without a significant change in the focused beam radius (Figure 8.2).
A long depth of focus is good for laser cutting, for example, where parallel-sided cuts or holes are
needed.
The depth of focus, zf, over which 80% of the power density at the focal point is maintained can
be shown to be given approximately (Problem 8.2) by:
zf = 𝜋 × df
2
4 × 𝜆 (8.3)
where df is the focused beam diameter.❦

266 BACKGROUND ON LASER PROCESSING
8.1.3 Beam Mode
In simple terms, the beam mode or profile is the intensity (irradiance or power per unit area) distri￾bution in a plane perpendicular to the beam propagation axis. It is an indication of how the energy
intensity is distributed over the beam cross section. The profile varies with propagation distance from
the output mirror. The near-field profile may be distorted due to diffraction effects, but the profile
tends to assume a constant, symmetrical shape in the far-field. Far-field is reliably detected after five
Rayleigh ranges. The Rayleigh range (also known as the near-field distance), xR, is defined as the
distance between the beam waist and the point where the beam size is √
2 times the waist size:
xR ≈ 𝜋ww
2
𝜆
Distances within the Rayleigh range are referred to as the near-field region, while those much
greater than the Rayleigh range are referred to as the far-field region. Depending on the type of
beam, the Rayleigh range can be as little as a few millimiters, or as much as a number of meters.
Profiles of a Gaussian (TEM00) (low order) mode and a multimode (TEMmn) (high order) are
shown schematically in Figure 8.3. The Gaussian or low-order mode (Figure 8.3a) can be focused
to the laser’s theoretical minimum radius. The higher order or multimode beams, on the other
hand, are more spread out and are not as well focused, resulting in larger focal spot sizes and
thus lower power density for the same output power. These are more common with higher power
lasers.
A Gaussian mode beam is thus normally preferred for cutting, for example, since it results in the
smallest possible focused beam radius and thus highest power density for a given incident power.
On the other hand, for butt welding, a higher-order multimode beam is preferable since the larger
beam diameter means less stringent joint fit-up requirements.

❦ ❦
❦
SYSTEM-RELATED PARAMETERS 267
Nd:YAG lasers normally generate a multimode beam (Figure 8.3b), since that ensures the most
efficient power extraction from the rod used in the laser source. CO2 lasers, on the other hand, can
generate either a low-order or multimode beam, with the low-order mode being more common at
power levels less than 5 kW. However, the output of high-power CO2 lasers is normally multimode,
since the high-power lasers are usually transverse flow machines which inherently produce multi￾mode beams.
8.1.4 Beam Form
The laser output is usually of two forms:
1. CW: where the output power is essentially constant.
2. Pulsed: where the output power varies periodically, in a manner similar to a clock signal.
The CW output is used quite often. However, the pulsed output of a laser has advantages in
a number of situations. For example, variation of the on/off ratio or duty cycle of the pulsed beam
enables applications such as drilling and cutting of sharp-edged contours to be effectively controlled.
The reduced total heat input also makes the pulsed output suitable for parts that are sensitive to
distortion. On the other hand, the lower overall average power of the pulsed beam results in a reduced
processing speed. Furthermore, in processes such as cutting and seam welding, where there is a need
for continuity, the pulse repetition rate, when a pulsed beam is used, has to be high enough for the
pulses to overlap.
Pulsed beams can be classified into three forms (Figure 8.4):
• Gated pulsing: which is obtained by switching the discharge current on and off to produce
a pulsed output (Figure 8.4a). The peak output power is about the same as the nominal CW
output power. The average power is the product of pulse energy and repetition rate, while the
pulse energy depends on the peak power, pulse shape, and pulse duration.
• Superpulsing: where the peak output power is about two to three times that of the CW output
(Figure 8.4b). However, the duty cycle is correspondingly reduced. Superpulsing enables low￾to medium-power CW lasers to produce relatively high output powers over short periods of
time and is similar to Q-switching except that it is achieved electronically.
• Hyperpulsing: where high peak power pulses are superposed on the CW output (Figure 8.4c).
Both superpulsing and hyperpulsing are useful for minimizing dross formation at the lower sur￾face during cutting of some materials such as stainless steels. This is because much higher tem￾peratures are achieved in the molten metal when either superpulsing or hyperpulsing is used. That
results in a lower viscosity of the material, making it easier to eject with the same level of gas pres￾sure. Both pulsing modes enable deeper weld penetration or greater cut thickness (up to about 50%)
to be achieved for the same average power as a CW output. They also make it easier to process highly
reflective and/or high thermal conductivity materials.
8.1.5 Beam Quality
The quality of a laser beam is normally characterized in terms of the K and M2 factors, which are
dimensionless, beam parameter product (BPP) with units mm-mrad, and beam divergence, 𝜃. They
indicate the resemblance of the beam to a Gaussian beam. These are related as follows:
M2 = 1
K = BPP × 𝜋

where

(8.6)
x is the distance measured from the beam waist along the axis of beam propagation, ww is the beam
radius at the waist, and L is the distance between the cavity mirrors.
The propagation of a non-Gaussian laser beam can be expressed in a similar manner with ww
modified as:
ww =
( L𝜆
2𝜋K
)1∕2
(8.7)
where K is the K-factor. Both the M2 and K factors are unity for diffraction-limited Gaussian beams.
However, for non-Gaussian beams, the K-factor is smaller (less than unity), while the M2-factor is
higher (greater than unity). A beam with an M = 3 has a waist almost three times larger than the
Gaussian beam and diverges slightly more. As an example, most high-power Nd:YAG lasers have
beam quality of M2 between 50 and 100.
8.1.6 Beam Absorption
In analyzing the thermal effect of a laser beam on a workpiece, the amount of power that actually
enters or is absorbed by the workpiece needs to be considered. When the beam is incident on a
solid surface, absorption occurs in a thin surface layer called the skin depth (of about 0.01 μm depth
for a CO2 laser on metals) and transferred to the inner part by conduction. The skin depth, 𝛿′
, of
a substance is the distance to which incident electromagnetic radiation penetrates that substance,
during which the light intensity drops by a factor e from its initial value, and is expressed as:
𝛿′ = 1
√𝜋𝜎e𝜇m𝜈
(8.8)
where 𝜎e is the electrical conductivity (S/m), 𝜇m is the magnetic permeability (H/m), and 𝜈 is the
frequency (Hz).
For a beam of power qi, incident on a surface of reflectance Rs, the power qa absorbed by the
workpiece is given by:
qa = qi(1 − Rs) = a𝛼qi (8.9)
The reflectance (Rs) or absorptivity (a𝛼 =1−Rs) depends on both the material on which the
beam is incident and the beam wavelength (Figure 8.5a). For metals, the absorptivity increases with
decreasing wavelength, while for nonmetals, it increases with increasing wavelength (Figure 8.5a).
Metals thus generally tend to have better absorption at the shorter 1.06 μm wavelength characteristic
of Nd:YAG lasers than at the 10.6 μm wavelength of CO2 lasers at temperatures below their melting
points. The reverse is true of nonmetallic materials such as glass, quartz, plastics, and insulators in
general. For processes that do not require melting, such as surface heat treatment, such differences
in absorption can be very significant. Figure 8.5b shows the absorption values for different metals.
The absorptivity also increases with an increase in temperature for a given wavelength. Once the
material melts, the absorptivity increases dramatically and essentially becomes independent of the
wavelength (Figure 8.6).
Initial absorption of the laser beam by the workpiece is also affected by other factors such as the
nature of the surface and the joint geometry. Absorption on a metallic surface can be enhanced by
appropriate surface modification such as anodizing, sand blasting, and surface coating. However,❦

as indicated in the preceding paragraph, the absorptivity of metals increases with increasing tem￾perature and becomes even more significant in the molten state. Thus, for processes that involve
melting and/or vaporization, such as welding and cutting, the high initial reflectivity need not be a
major problem, except in the initial stages of the process, where a high initial power is required for
highly reflective materials. On the other hand, for processes that do not involve melting, such as heat
treatment and forming, high reflectivity will result in significant power loss.
In addition to its influence on beam absorption, reflectivity also determines the amount of energy
that is reflected back to the beam delivery system (back scattering) and may result in optical feedback
into the laser resonator, affecting both the beam generation mechanism and optical elements.
8.1.6.1 Measurement of Absorptivity The absorptivity of a material can be measured using the
simple calorimetric setup as shown in Figure 8.7. A specimen of the material is attached to one side of
a calorimeter through which water flows. When the laser beam is incident on the specimen, the energy❦

it absorbs is transferred to the water flowing beneath it. Measurement of the inlet and outlet tempera￾tures of the water, along with the flow rate, enables the power absorbed to be determined as follows:
Power absorbed by the water = mċ p(Tout − Tin) (8.10)
where ṁ is the mass flow rate of the water (kg/s), cp is the specific heat (J/kg K), Tin is the inlet
temperature (K), and Tout is the outlet temperature (K).
The absorptivity of the material is then given by:
Absorptivity = Power absorbed by the water
Incident laser power (8.11)
8.1.7 Beam Alignment
To ensure that the laser beam is delivered from the generator to the appropriate spot on the work￾piece, the beam is always aligned with the optical and beam delivery systems. Since the infrared
radiation is not visible, the alignment process is normally facilitated by installing in the high-power
laser a low-power HeNe laser to generate a visible red beam that is coaxial with the invisible pri￾mary infrared beam. With the two beams being coaxial, alignment of the visible beam automatically
ensures alignment of the invisible beam. For such systems, the output lens must be transmissive to
both infrared and visible radiation. ZnSe is one such suitable material for CO2 lasers.
The alignment process essentially involves adjustment of the beam bender (mirror) orientation
using the mounting screws to redirect the beam. A cross-hair assembly is mounted at the output of
either the beam bender or focusing assembly. The mirror orientation is then adjusted until the beam
center coincides with the cross-hair center when observed on a screen held behind the cross-hair
assembly, at the location where the workpiece would normally be positioned (Figure 8.8).
For systems that do not have a visible beam installed, essentially the same procedure is followed,
except that instead of observing the visible radiation on the screen, the laser is given a single pulse at
low power, with a sheet of cardboard paper held in place of the screen. The beam will burn a pattern
on the paper that indicates the cross-hair position relative to the beam center.❦

8.1.8 Motion Unit
The motion unit is the means by which relative motion is achieved between the laser beam and the
workpiece. There are four ways in which this can be done:
1. The workpiece is kept stationary, while the entire laser and its beam delivery system is moved
relative to the workpiece. This approach is more suited to large workpieces and is often incon￾venient, given the typical size of industrial lasers.
2. The laser and its entire beam delivery system are kept fixed, while the workpiece is moved
with respect to it. This method is suitable for processing pieces of limited size. Processing of
large pieces requires significantly large floor space.
3. The use of a fiber optic system (Section 3.7.2).
4. The use of flying optics. In this case, the laser generator is kept fixed while the beam delivery
components (focusing assembly and mirrors) are moved relative to the workpiece. It usually
involves the use of a robot that incorporates the beam delivery elements. The principal setback
of this approach is the change in size of the focused spot along the processed path. This is due
to beam divergence which results in increase in beam size with distance from the laser output
window. Minimal beam divergence is thus essential.
Either the fiber optic or flying optics arrangement minimizes floor space, and the size of workpiece
that can be processed is unlimited. Another advantage is the ability to keep the beam orientation
normal to the workpiece surface, and to keep the nozzle to workpiece distance constant, even when
processing parts with complex contours.
8.2 PROCESS EFFICIENCY
Laser processing applications involve transfer of energy from the generator to the workpiece. In the
course of generation and transfer, part of the energy is lost. Sources of energy loss include
1. Absorption in the optical components.
2. Convection through the shielding gas.❦
❦ ❦
❦
PROCESS EFFICIENCY 273
3. Radiation from the workpiece surface to the surroundings.
4. Conduction into the workpiece.
Thus, only a fraction of the power generated is available for processing. The overall efficiency
of a laser process consists of four efficiency components that determine the amount of power that is
actually used in the process. These are as follows:
1. Laser generator efficiency.
2. Beam transmission efficiency.
3. Heat transfer efficiency.
4. Processing efficiency.
• Laser Generator Efficiency, 𝜂g: This is given by the ratio of the power output of the laser
generator to the power input to the generator. It is expressed as:
𝜂g = Power output of the laser
Power input to the laser generator (8.12)
It typically ranges from about 10% to 30% for CO2 lasers, 1% to 3% for Nd:YAG lasers, 1% to
4% for excimer lasers, 30% to 50% for diode lasers, and 25% to 50% for fiber lasers (Appendix 2.B).
• Beam Transmission Efficiency, 𝜂t: The beam transmission efficiency depends on the transmis￾sion components being used. The efficiency is defined as the ratio of the energy coming out of
the beam delivery system to the energy input to the beam delivery system from the laser and is
expressed as:
𝜂t = Power output from beam delivery system
Power input from laser to beam delivery system (power output of the laser) (8.13)
• Heat Transfer Efficiency, 𝜂th: The actual power available for the process is determined by the
efficiency of heat transfer, 𝜂th, which is the efficiency of energy transmission from the source
to the workpiece (absorption), that is,
𝜂th = Power actually absorbed by the workpiece (qa)
Total power available at the source (power output from beam delivery system) (qi)
(8.14)
Thus,
qa = 𝜂th × qi (8.15)
For laser welding, this typically ranges from 50% to 95%, once the welding process is
initiated and a keyhole is formed. However, before any melting occurs, this may be as low
as 1% for polished aluminum or copper and about 40% for stainless steel when using a CO2
laser. Nd:YAG lasers result in higher absorption efficiencies in solid metals. Power losses at
this stage result primarily from reflection from the workpiece surface and plasma absorption
when the material melts.
• Processing Efficiency, 𝜂p: The processing efficiency is the thermal efficiency of energy con￾version in the workpiece and is defined as the ratio of the power required for heating and/or
melting to the power actually transferred to the workpiece.❦
❦ ❦
❦
274 BACKGROUND ON LASER PROCESSING
For processes that involve melting, the processing efficiency, 𝜂p, is given by:
𝜂p = Power required to melt a given volume of material
Power actually absorbed by the workpiece = Q1Awux
qa
(8.16)
where Q1 =𝜌w [Lm +cp(Tm – T0)] (J/m3) is the heat required to melt a given volume of material
from room temperature, Aw is the total cross-sectional area of fusion zone (m2), 𝜌w is thedensity
of fused metal (kg/m3), and ux is the velocity of the moving heat source (m/s).
The processing efficiency depends on the processing conditions, material (workpiece), and joint
configuration. Materials with higher conductivity have lower efficiency, since a significant amount
of the input heat is lost by conduction. It increases with the intensity of the heat source. Higher
efficiencies are achieved at higher power levels and speeds for lower thermal conductivity materials,
since less incident power is then lost by conduction into the workpiece. Power is also lost by radiation
and convection from the surface.
• Overall Efficiency, 𝜂: The overall efficiency of the process is then given by:
𝜂 = 𝜂g𝜂t𝜂th𝜂p = Power used in processing the material
Power input to the laser generator (8.17)
Typical values of overall efficiency for arc, laser, and electron beam welding are shown in
Table 10.3 for comparison.
8.3 DISTURBANCES THAT AFFECT PROCESS QUALITY
High quality in the production environment can be maintained by minimizing the impact of distur￾bances that affect the production system. Common sources of disturbance during laser processing
include
1. Fluctuations in power line.
2. Temperature and humidity variations in the production environment.
3. Condensation that may result from cooling of optical components with tap water. Air cooling
alleviates this problem.
4. Contamination of the output window by dust and vapor from the atmosphere. This requires
prevention of contact with surrounding atmosphere.
5. Vibrations from the surroundings.
6. Back scattering, a phenomenon that results from reflection of the incident laser beam off the
workpiece. If the nozzle orifice is large enough, a significant portion of this reflected beam
may propagate backward along the transmission path. In extreme cases, this may change the
state of polarization of the laser beam, cause uncontrolled amplification of the laser process,
and possibly damage the optical elements and laser resonator. The effect of back scattering on
the process may be minimized by tilting the workpiece at such an angle that any beam that is
reflected from it is unable to propagate back into the beam delivery system.❦

SUMMARY 275
8.4 GENERAL ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF LASER PROCESSING
Lasers have several advantages over conventional techniques that are normally used in materials
processing. At the same time, there are disadvantages that may make lasers less suitable for certain
applications. These are outlined in the following paragraphs and further elaborated on with respect
to specific processes as they are discussed in Chapters 9–14.
8.4.1 Advantages
1. The ability to focus the beam to a small size, thereby attaining a high intensity and highly
localized heating source with minimal effect on surrounding areas. Spot sizes may vary from
about 0.001 to 10 mm.
2. The ease with which the beam power can be controlled by regulating the current through the
electric discharge.
3. Minimal contamination of the process.
4. Ability to manipulate the beam into ordinarily inaccessible areas using mirrors and fiberoptic
cables.
5. Minimal heat-affected zone and distortion.
6. Noncontact nature of the process.
8.4.2 Disadvantages
1. Relatively high capital cost of equipment.
2. High reflectivity of laser beam on metals.
3. Low efficiency of lasers.
4. Energy waste by beam dumping when the laser is not used continuously.
8.5 SUMMARY
Power densities generated by pulsed lasers generally exceed 1014 W/cm2 and can be as high as
1021 W/cm2, much greater than the outputs of commonly available heat sources such as the electron
beam, arc, and blackbody radiation. For materials processing, ablation requires the highest power
densities and shortest interaction times, while transformation hardening requires the lowest power
densities and longest interaction times. The principal system parameters that affect process quality
include the beam power and power density at the focal point, wavelength and focusing system, beam
mode (distribution), beam form (CW or pulsed), and beam quality. Others include beam absorption,
beam delivery, beam alignment, and the motion unit used for positioning the beam or workpiece.
The power density of a beam at the focal point is inversely proportional to the square of the
beam wavelength and lens focal length and directly proportional to the square of the original beam
diameter. Common lens materials that are used for focusing include ZnSe, KCl, GaAs, and CdTe.
The depth of focus of a focusing system is the distance over which the workpiece can be moved from
the original focal point without a significant change in the focused beam radius.❦

276 BACKGROUND ON LASER PROCESSING
The Gaussian mode is the lowest order mode a beam can have, and it can be focused to the laser’s
theoretical minimum radius. The size of a Gaussian beam is defined as the radial distance at which
the beam intensity reduces to 1/e2 or 13.5% the peak intensity. The higher-order or multimode beams,
on the other hand, are more spread out and are not as well focused. The form of the laser output can
be either continuous or pulsed, with the pulsed output being one of three types: gated, superpulsed,
or hyperpulsed. For a given total pulse energy, a shorter but higher power density pulse will result in
higher peak surface temperature than a longer, lower power density pulse. However, the lower power
density pulse produces a more uniform temperature distribution and a greater depth of penetration
of the heat at the end of the pulse. The quality of a laser beam is characterized by either the M2 or K
(=1/M2) factor, with M = K = 1 for a diffraction-limited Gaussian beam.
When a beam is incident on a solid surface, absorption occurs in a thin surface layer, the skin
depth, and transferred to the inner part by conduction. For metals, the absorptivity increases with
decreasing wavelength, while for nonmetals, it increases with increasing wavelength. The absorp￾tivity also increases with an increase in temperature for a given wavelength.
As the laser beam propagates from the generator to the workpiece, the major sources of energy loss
include absorption in the optical components, convection through the shielding gas, radiation from
the workpiece surface to the surroundings, and conduction into the workpiece. The overall efficiency
of a laser process consists of four efficiency components. These are laser generator efficiency, beam
transmission efficiency, heat transfer efficiency, and processing efficiency.

9 Laser Cutting and Drilling
In laser cutting and drilling, the focused laser beam is directed unto the surface of the workpiece
to rapidly heat it up, resulting in melting and/or vaporization, depending on the beam intensity and
workpiece material (Figure 9.1). The molten metal and/or vapor is then blown away using an assist
gas. The power density required is typically of the order of 106–107 W/cm2 for metals. Lasers can
be used to effectively cut metal plates of thicknesses up to about 10 cm. The cut surfaces are roughly
parallel and straight-edged. In reality, the diverging nature of the beam results in a slight taper being
produced. The workpiece thickness that can be cut with parallel sides is determined by the depth
of focus (Section 8.1.2). Plates that are thicker than the depth of focus normally result in tapered
surfaces. Furthermore, for effective removal of material from the cutting zone, the ratio of workpiece
thickness to kerf width needs to be less than 20 : 1 for most metals, and less than 40 : 1 for ceramics.
The kerf is the slot or opening created by the cutting process.
The total heat input required for laser cutting is relatively small. This results in a small
heat-affected zone (HAZ) size, of the order of 0.1 mm. Also, the small size of the focused beam
results in very narrow kerf sizes, typically about 0.05–1 mm. Laser cutting is used for both straight
and contour cutting of sheet and plate stock in a wide variety of materials.
Laser cutting and laser drilling are discussed in two separate sections due to the unique char￾acteristics of the two processes. The chapter as a whole begins with a general discussion on the
different ways in which laser cutting may take place. Components of a laser cutting system are
then outlined. The processing conditions that are normally used are then presented. This is followed
by a discussion on the principles of the cutting process, which leads to common defects that may
result during the process. The specific characteristics of individual materials are then discussed, fol￾lowed by the advantages and disadvantages of laser cutting, and a comparison with conventional
processes. The section on laser drilling follows a similar outline, starting with the different forms
of laser drilling. The essential process parameters are then discussed, followed by an analysis of
the material removal process. The advantages and disadvantages of the process are then presented,
followed by some of the major applications of laser drilling. Finally, new developments such as
micromachining and laser-assisted machining are discussed.

9.1.1.1 Fusion Cutting Fusion cutting involves melting of the base material, which is then ejected
using a high-pressure assist gas. The assist gas may be an inert gas, in which case the energy for
melting is provided entirely by the laser beam. It may also be oxygen (or air), which reacts with the
base metal, and the resulting exothermic reaction provides additional energy to enhance the process.
The term fusion or clean cutting is sometimes used to indicate inert gas-assisted cutting, while the
process involving exothermic reaction is then referred to as gas cutting. A major problem of fusion
cutting is the formation of striations (valleys and peaks that run along the thickness (Section 9.1.5.1))
on the cut surface and dross (molten material that clings to and solidifies on the underside of the
cut edge as burr (Section 9.1.5.2)) at the lower cut edge. However, the fusion cutting process is
more efficient, requiring less energy per unit volume of material removed as compared to the other
methods.
9.1.1.2 Sublimation Cutting In sublimation cutting, the workpiece material is vaporized along
the cutting seam. This is often achieved using a pulsed beam, and a jet of inert assist gas that is
coaxial with the beam is used to blow away the vapor produced. It is limited to thin sections since
more energy is required to remove a unit volume of material as compared to fusion cutting. However,
it has the advantage of a narrower kerf width and higher-quality surface. Pulsed beams with high peak
power may be necessary when surface quality is critical.
9.1.1.3 Photochemical Ablation Organic materials, ceramics, or difficult-to-cut materials in gen￾eral are normally cut by this method or by sublimation cutting. Organic compounds tend to absorb
ultraviolet radiation in an efficient manner. The photon energy levels of lasers based on ultraviolet
radiation range between 3.5 and 6.5 eV. This corresponds with the energy levels required for molec￾ular bonding. For example, the energy associated with the C—C bond is roughly 4.6 eV, while that of
the C—H bond is about 4.2 eV. Compare these values with the photon energy level values associated
with CO2 and Nd:YAG lasers of about 0.12 and 1.2 eV, respectively.
As a result, when an organic material is irradiated with an ultraviolet beam, the material absorbs
the beam’s energy in a very thin layer near the surface, of the order of submicrons. This breaks
molecular bonds, causing ablative decomposition of the irradiated area. The process occurs almost❦

instantaneously (about 20 ns duration), and since the thermal conductivity of organic materials is
relatively low, the resulting edges are well defined, with minimal thermal damage to the surrounding
area. Thus, the cut region is cleaner and smoother compared to that obtained using CO2 and Nd:YAG
lasers. The process is sometimes referred to as cold cutting since little heat is generated.
9.1.2 Components of a Laser Cutting System
The basic components of a cutting system are illustrated in Figure 9.2 and include
1. The laser generator that produces the beam.
2. A beam delivery system for directing the beam to the workpiece.
3. A nozzle assembly, usually integral with the focusing assembly and coaxial with the beam, for
directing the assist gas to the workpiece.
4. A motion unit for providing relative motion between the laser beam and the workpiece.
5. An exhaust for the waste material.
The beam normally emerges from the generator horizontally and is deflected vertically downward
by a bending mirror. The vertical orientation is used to minimize trapping of the beam and molten
material blown through the cut. The beam is then focused by the lens unto the workpiece. At the
same time, a gas jet is directed through a nozzle attached to the tip of the focusing assembly, unto the
workpiece. A typical nozzle diameter would be about 1–2 mm. The delivery pressures are normally
maintained at about 3–4 bar (45–60 psi or 0.3–0.4 MPa) in the gas jet nozzle for cutting thin materials
at high speeds. At high gas pressures, it is often necessary to use relatively thick lenses that can
withstand the pressure. However, care has to be taken since thermal deformation of the lens increases
with its thickness. Thus, at high power levels, say 10 kW, it is preferable to use reflective optics
(mirrors) rather than transmissive optics (lenses).

The beam is generally oriented in a direction almost normal to the workpiece surface, and there
is a deterioration in product quality as the beam orientation deviates significantly from the normal
direction. The distance from the nozzle tip to the workpiece surface is typically maintained constant
at about 0.3 mm to minimize expansion of the gas flow. Capacitive or light sensors may be installed to
measure this distance. The focusing unit may then be moved using a computer numerically controlled
(CNC) third axis or a robot. A simpler but less flexible approach involves mounting the focusing unit
on rollers that glide on the workpiece surface.
Directly opposite the nozzle, on the other side of the workpiece, an exhaust system is provided to
absorb the transmitted beam, molten debris from the cut, and exhaust vapors. This normally consists
of a vacuum pump that draws the exhaust to a disposal unit.
9.1.3 Processing Conditions
The principal parameters that affect the laser cutting process include the following:
1. Beam power.
2. Beam characteristics.
3. Traverse speed.
4. Assist gas type and flow.
5. Location of focal point relative to the workpiece surface.
Table 9.1 gives sample conditions for laser cutting of various materials. We shall further discuss
each of these parameters in Sections 9.1.3.1–9.1.3.5.
9.1.3.1 Beam Power The power is the most significant of the parameters listed. An increase in
power increases the maximum thickness that can be cut and/or speed at which it can be cut.
9.1.3.2 Beam Characteristics The most important beam characteristics in laser cutting operations
are as follows:
1. Beam mode.
2. Stability.❦
❦ ❦
❦
LASER CUTTING 283
3. Polarization.
4. Beam form (pulsed or continuous wave).
Beam Mode As indicated in Section 8.1.3, the beam mode is an indication of how the energy
intensity is distributed over the beam cross section. The mode relates to the beam’s ability to be
focused and may be compared with the sharpness of a cutting tool. In laser cutting, it is desirable to
have the beam distribution as close as possible to the fundamental or Gaussian-distributed TEM00
mode. This is the mode that can be focused to the laser’s theoretically smallest possible focal size
and thus the highest density for a given power. This reduces the kerf width and increases cutting
speeds and thickness of materials that can be cut. Since higher-order or multimode beams are more
spread out (Figure 8.3), they result in larger focal spot sizes and thus lower power density for the
same output power.
Beam Stability Stability of the beam is necessary to ensure that the beam power, mode, and direc￾tion (pointing stability) remain constant with time. An unstable beam affects the tolerances and
surface finish achievable with laser cutting. A stable beam thus reduces variations in product output
and enhances quality. The stability of the beam is a characteristic of the laser generator and depends
on its design.
Effect of Beam Polarization The basic concepts of polarization are discussed in Section 3.4. When
the output of a laser beam is randomly polarized, it shows up in the quality of the cut workpiece
as variations in kerf, edge smoothness, and perpendicularity. This is mainly due to the impact of
polarization on beam absorption by the material. Absorption of the laser beam depends on both the
angle of incidence and polarization. Experimental results indicate that in CO2 laser cutting, beams
which are plane-polarized in a plane parallel to the cutting direction result in cutting speeds which
can be up to 50% greater than those which are plane-polarized in the plane normal to the cutting
direction. Generally, the circularly polarized beam results in higher cutting speeds at higher power
levels. For beams which are plane-polarized in the cutting plane, the beam is found to be more
effectively absorbed at angles of incidence greater than 80∘ and less than 90∘.
The cut quality varies with the orientation of the plane of polarization, and a circularly polarized
beam generally results in better cut quality when the cutting direction changes. Thus, profile or
contour cutting is preferably done using a circularly polarized beam. The impact of the orientation
of a linearly polarized beam on the cut quality is illustrated schematically in Figure 9.3. As the figure
shows, when the beam is polarized in the cutting direction, the resulting cut may have a narrow kerf
with sharp, straight edges. However, as the plane of polarization is oriented away from the cutting
direction, the energy absorption decreases, and as a result, the cutting speed is reduced, the kerf
becomes wider, and the edges rougher and not square to the material’s surface.
Beam Form Both pulsed and continuous wave (CW) beams can be used for laser cutting, with
CW beams being more common. For pulsed beams, the quality of cut is affected by the pulse duty,
with the surface roughness decreasing with increasing pulse duty. The pulse duty is the ratio of
the length of time during which the laser beam is on in one cycle to the total length of the cycle
time. In addition, the maximum cutting speeds that can be achieved are significantly reduced at
low pulse repetition rates (number of pulses per second). This is due to the fact that at low pulse
rates, there is enough time between pulses for the material to substantially cool down. This helps
extinguish the exothermic oxidation reaction, thereby reducing the overall process efficiency. Fur￾thermore, as the material cools down between pulses at low pulse frequencies, there is a greater
likelihood of forming dross (Section 9.1.5.2). The resulting lower average temperature increases❦

the surface tension or viscosity of the molten material, making it more difficult to flow out of the
reaction zone.
As discussed in Section 8.1.4, superpulsing and hyperpulsing can also be used to obtain significant
improvements in process performance such as
1. Minimizing dross formation at the lower surface during cutting of some materials.
2. Greater cut thickness (up to about 100%) to be achieved for the same average power as a CW
output.
3. Increased processing speeds (20–33%) for the same average power as a CW output.
4. Making it easier to process highly reflective and/or high thermal conductivity materials.
9.1.3.3 Traverse Speed The maximum speed that can be achieved for a given laser power
decreases with increasing thickness of the workpiece (Figure 9.4). For a given power, a plot of
the variation of cutting speed with thickness will generally have two limiting curves (Figure 9.5).
The upper curve indicates the maximum speed that can be achieved for a given thickness. Above
this curve, cutting is incomplete. Below the lower curve, self-burning occurs. In other words, the
material continues to burn without the aid of the laser. This often widens the kerf and produces a
rough surface.
9.1.3.4 Assist Gas Functions The assist gas used in laser cutting serves one or more of the fol￾lowing functions:
1. Facilitates ejection of the molten metal through the backside of the workpiece.
2. Protects the lens from spatter.
3. Acts as a heat source where it results in an exothermic reaction that aids in cutting, such as
may occur in oxygen-assisted cutting of steel.
Effect of Different Types of Assist Gases Common gases used include oxygen, inert gases, nitrogen,
and air. Oxygen or air is used for exothermic reaction while cutting and therefore they improve the
cutting efficiency. Otherwise, an inert gas (usually argon) is used to assist in ejecting the molten metal
without oxidation. In cases where the exothermic reaction is desired, the decision to use oxygen or
air depends primarily on economics. Air is cheaper but would require higher flow rates for the same❦

amount of thermal energy produced. Furthermore, it may introduce other gases such as nitrogen into
the cut surface, making it more brittle.
One setback of oxygen-assisted cutting is the deposition of an oxide layer on the cut surface,
giving it a dark appearance. Depending on the subsequent use of the cut parts, it may be necessary to
clean off this oxide layer (by grinding or wire brushing). The use of inert gases or nitrogen eliminates
the formation of the oxide layer. However, this may significantly reduce the cutting speeds that can
be achieved. Furthermore, higher pressures are then necessary to reduce dross formation. Dross is
molten material that clings to and solidifies on the underside of the cut edge as burr (Section 9.1.5.2).❦

Small levels of impurity can cause significant deviations in cutting performance (such as a reduc￾tion in maximum cutting speed or increase in dross adhesion) compared to that of the pure gas, be
it oxygen or inert gas. This is illustrated in Figure 9.6, which shows a variation of the cutting speed
for various levels of oxygen gas purity. This sensitivity to contamination is due to the build-up of a
boundary layer of the contaminant at the liquid-cut front interface. It decreases the oxidation rate of
the material, thereby lowering the energy input to the cut zone.
Oxygen-Assisted Cutting To summarize the impact of oxygen assist in cutting of various materials,
Figure 9.7 illustrates the maximum cutting speeds achievable for different materials when cut using
inert gas and also oxygen assist. In addition to the exothermic reaction that results, the use of oxygen
assist in cutting also reduces the viscosity and surface tension for some metals, making it easier for
the molten metal to flow. Table 9.2 compares the surface tension of some metals and oxides. The
oxide film formed also tends to increase beam absorption.
The maximum cutting speeds achieved depend on the thermal properties of the metal. For inert
gas-assisted cutting, higher speeds are obtained for low melting and low thermal conductivity met￾als. Maximum cutting speeds are higher for oxygen-assisted cutting, compared to inert gas-assisted

cutting of titanium, zirconium, and niobium due to the relatively high exothermic energy associated
with these metals. However, the surface quality obtained is relatively poor. This is due to the fact that
the oxidation region cannot be limited to the beam irradiating region as a result of the high exother￾mic energy. The relatively low cutting speeds achieved with aluminum and zinc is due to the high
melting temperature of their oxides. The exothermic reaction associated with steel is not very high,
when compared to that of other metals such as titanium, zirconium, and niobium. Thus, the cutting
speeds are not very high, but the quality of cut is relatively good since the relatively low exothermic
reaction results in a reaction zone that is limited to the beam-irradiated region.
Care must be used in oxygen-assisted cutting, since excess oxygen may result in overreaction
or uncontrollable burning away from the main cutting direction, especially for thick materials. That
may increase striation formation, and thus, roughness.
Gas Nozzles Some of the nozzle designs that are commonly used for coaxial application of a gas
jet during laser cutting are shown in Figure 9.8.
Low or subsonic flow rates from a coaxial nozzle are found to produce repeatable results, espe￾cially when the nozzle is positioned close to the workpiece, that is, with a stand-off (nozzle to work)
distance of about 0.1–1.5 mm. Short stand-off distances are used despite the fact that the effec￾tive cutting pressure decreases rather slowly with distance from the nozzle tip (about 15% decrease
over a nozzle gap of 10 mm). This is because the jet direction is highly sensitive to manufacturing

imperfection or tip damage. Even though higher pressures or flow rates result in higher cutting
speeds and quality, they do not necessarily ensure repeatability of the process due to turbulence
in the gas flow.

in the location of the focal point relative to the workpiece surface. Best results (minimum kerf width)
are obtained when the focal point is either on the workpiece surface or just below it (Figure 9.9).
For thick plates, it might be preferable to have the focus positioned one-third of the plate thickness
below its surface.
9.1.4 Laser Cutting Principles
The laser fusion cutting process is illustrated schematically in Figure 9.1. Both the laser beam and
gas jet impinge on the workpiece surface. Sources of heat for the cutting process include
1. Absorbed laser radiation.
2. Energy due to exothermic reaction between the base material and assist oxygen gas.
The energy produced melts and may partly evaporate material in front of the beam. The pres￾surized gas jet then ejects the molten material from the lower surface of the workpiece. Material
removal thus occurs by
1. Evaporation from the surface of the molten layer.
2. Ejection from the lower surface of the workpiece due to friction between the gas flow and the
surface of the molten layer.
Energy is lost from the process by
1. Heat conduction.

2. Evaporation from the erosion front.
3. Melting of solid metal.
4. Ejection of the molten metal.
5. Reflection, radiation, and convection cooling by the gas flow. For subsonic gas flow, the con￾vection cooling effect is considered negligible.
In the initial stages of the process, the entire beam and gas jet hit the workpiece surface. However,
once the process is initiated, a kerf is formed, and only a portion of the gas and laser beam impinge
on the top surface of the workpiece directly ahead of the kerf, and that portion may be reflected back.
The remaining portion of the beam propagates downward into the kerf and is partly absorbed at the
front end of the kerf (erosion front), which is slightly inclined to the vertical. For a beam that is
linearly polarized in the cutting direction, most of the beam power is absorbed at the erosion front.
A thin layer of molten material forms at the interface between the kerf and the solid base material
in front of it and is ejected by the mechanisms listed earlier. The thickness of the melt increases
with increasing cutting speed, since more molten metal is then produced per unit time. However, an
increase in assist gas velocity decreases the melt thickness, since it results in a more rapid ejection
of molten material (Figure 9.10).
For a given laser power, the average temperatures attained in the molten layer decrease as the
thickness of the workpiece increases, until above a certain thickness, the average temperature falls
below the melting temperature. This is the maximum thickness that can be cut with a laser of that
power level, all other laser parameters being the same.
9.1.4.1 Beam Absorption During Laser Cutting Absorption of the laser beam during cutting may
be enhanced by a number of phenomena, including surface roughness, oxide formation, and plasma
formation. Absorption may be by Fresnel absorption or by inverse bremsstrahlung (Section 10.3.2.1).
However, since the direction of beam polarization strongly influences the cutting efficiency, this
suggests that Fresnel absorption is the principal mechanism. Since a significant portion of the energy
generated is removed with the ejected molten metal, temperatures in the cutting region may not be

high enough to generate the high vapor densities essential for plasma formation. The role of the
plasma in the cutting process (and therefore absorption by inverse bremsstrahlung) is thus minimal,
as opposed to the case of welding and drilling.
For p-polarized light (plane-polarized light parallel to the plane of incidence) which is incident on
metallic surfaces, the maximum value of the absorption coefficient occurs at high angles of incidence,
𝜃 (angle between the laser beam and the surface normal). The laser beam is then almost parallel to
the surface on which it is incident (Figure 9.11). This is supported by the fact that the inclination of
the cut surface on which the laser beam is incident is such that the angle of incidence is only a few
degrees below 90∘. The absorption is also about an order of magnitude greater than that at normal
incidence (when the laser beam is normal to the surface on which it is incident). Furthermore, a
p-polarized beam is absorbed much more strongly than an s-polarized light. Thus, a p-polarized
beam is more efficient for laser cutting in a straight line.
Absorption efficiency of the laser beam in cutting varies with the beam intensity, being low at low
intensities, increasing with increasing beam intensity to a maximum, and then decreasing with further
increases in the intensity (Figure 9.12). This is due to the dependence of absorption on the angle of
incidence. At low intensities, the cutting front is relatively flat, and that results in low absorption
since the angle of incidence is then almost zero, that is, the laser beam is almost normal to the
workpiece surface. With increasing intensity, the angle of incidence increases, further increasing
the absorption. At very high intensities, the cutting front is almost vertical, resulting in almost 90∘
incidence, at which the absorption is relatively low (Figure 9.13). For typical cutting conditions, the
inclination of the cutting front to the vertical is less than 1∘ close to the top of the workpiece and
increases to an inclination of 3–5∘ toward the bottom of the workpiece.

9.1.4.2 Process Modeling The laser cutting process is modeled in this section to relate process
inputs such as gas velocity, cutting velocity, laser power, and material properties to the process
outputs such as the melt thickness and quality of the cut surface. The gas jet in laser cutting sig￾nificantly influences the process dynamics. Modeling of the process thus involves consideration of
the following:❦
❦ ❦
❦
292 LASER CUTTING AND DRILLING
1. Gas flow.
2. Flow of the molten metal.
3. Heat flow in the solid material.
These flow regimes are now addressed in the following sections.
Gas Flow Model To provide a basic understanding of the process without extensive analysis, we
consider a nonreactive inert assist gas, thereby neglecting exothermic reaction, and make the follow￾ing simplifying assumptions:
1. Gas flow is subsonic and laminar.
2. The flow regime consists of a region of irrotational motion and a boundary layer region at the
cutting front.
3. The cutting front is an inclined plane.
4. The flow only separates at the lower edge.
5. The gas stream is bounded by free streamlines. This is an oversimplification since the gas is
surrounded to a large extent by air of almost the same density as the gas. Turbulent mixing of
the gas stream with the surrounding air increases downstream from the upper edge. Thus for
relatively thick workpieces, the assumption will only hold for the upper portion of the cutting
front.
With this background, and considering the schematic in Figure 9.14, we can obtain an expression
for the pressure distribution, Pg, in the gas stream using Bernoulli’s equation:
P1
𝜌g l
+ u1
2
2g
+ z1 = P2
𝜌g l
+ u2
2
2g
+ z2 + friction (9.1a)
where g is the acceleration due to gravity (m/s2), P is the pressure at a given location (Pa), u is the
velocity at that location (m/s), z is the height of the location of interest (m), and subscripts 1 and 2
refer to two different locations.
Neglecting friction and the small height difference in the laser cutting area and considering the
reference gage pressure at the nozzle to be zero (atmospheric), we have
Pg = 1

𝜌gug0

where Pg is the pressure distribution in the gas stream, ug is the gas velocity distribution, ug0 is the
gas velocity at the nozzle, 𝜌g is the room temperature gas density, which is assumed to be constant
with pressure (i.e. incompressible).
The velocity distribution is needed to obtain the pressure distribution from Eq. (9.1b). For the
shear stress distribution, we first consider the coordinate system shown in Figure 9.14 and then
make the following assumptions:
1. Flow is Newtonian.
2. The thickness of the molten layer can be neglected.
Now considering the fact that the shear stress is proportional to the shear strain rate since flow is
Newtonian, the shear stress distribution at the cutting front can be expressed as:

where 𝜇g is the gas viscosity (Pa s), 𝜏 is the shear stress distribution at the cutting front (N/m2), ugz
is the gas velocity in the z-direction, and ugx is the gas velocity in the x-direction.
The pressure gradient in Eq. (9.3) is assumed to be known. The resulting pressure and shear
stress distributions along the cutting front obtained from Eqs. (9.1b)–(9.3) are of the form illustrated
in Figures 9.15 and 9.16, respectively. The pressure distribution has a peak just below the upper
edge of the cutting front and then reduces monotonically to zero at the lower edge. The pressure also
increases with increasing inclination (𝜃i) of the cutting front from the vertical. The smaller the cutting
front slope, the lower the resistance to flow, and thus the smaller the pressure. The shear stress, on
the other hand, remains relatively constant over most of the cutting front and is less sensitive to the
inclination.
Modeling the Melt Flow Since most of the molten material is forcibly ejected by the gas jet, only a
thin layer of melt remains on the cutting front, with a thickness of the order of 40 μm. Thus flow may
be assumed, with a reasonable degree of accuracy, to be two-dimensional. In other words, this is a
boundary layer problem. Using the coordinate system shown in Figure 9.14 and assuming incom￾pressible flow, the continuity equation can be expressed as:

where Pl is the pressure in the molten metal and is assumed to be independent of x since this is
a boundary layer problem, ulz and ulx are the molten material velocities in the z and x directions,
respectively, 𝜇l is the dynamic viscosity of the molten metal, and 𝜌l is the density.
Boundary conditions have to be specified at the solid–liquid interface, x = 0, and also at the surface
of the liquid layer, x = hx(z, t), where hx, the melt thickness, is a function of both position and time.❦
❦ ❦

LASER CUTTING 295
At the solid–liquid interface, material is uniformly moved with the cutting velocity uc (Figure 9.14),
and thus continuity there requires that
ulz = uc sin 𝜃i at x = 0 (9.6a)
ulx = uc cos 𝜃i at x = 0 (9.6b)
where uc is the cutting velocity and 𝜃i is the inclination of the cut surface with the vertical.
There are normal and tangential stresses, Pg and 𝜏, respectively, at the melt surface due to the gas
jet. For equilibrium, we have
Pl = Pg + 𝛾l

where hx is the melt thickness, rc is the local radius of surface curvature, 𝛾l is the surface tension

the gas and molten material.
The following kinematic condition ensures that there is no mass transfer through the surface:
𝜕hx
𝜕t

𝜕hx
𝜕z = ulx at x = hx (9.8)
Evaporation effects are neglected in Eq. (9.8) for simplicity. Other conditions that can be applied
are as follows:
ulz = 0 when t = 0 (9.9a)
hx = 0 when t = 0 (9.9b)
hx = 0 at z = 0 (9.9c)
Knowing Pg and 𝜏 from the solution to the gas flow equations, Eqs. (9.4)–(9.9) can be solved
numerically for the pressure, velocity, and height of the molten layer. Typical trends obtained from
solution of these equations are illustrated in Figure 9.10, which shows that increasing the cutting
velocity uc increases the melt thickness hx, and that increasing the gas jet velocity decreases the
melt thickness.
The Heat Flow Effect The analyses in the preceding sections neglect the effect of heat flow. A more
complete solution of the pressure and stress fields requires consideration of the thermal effect. The
governing equation for heat flow is given by Eq. (4.2) as:

+ qs (4.2a)
In Chapter 4, this equation was first simplified by neglecting the internal energy generation term,
qs. The resulting equations associated with the line heat source model, Eqs. (4.22), (4.24), and (4.31),
for the temperature distribution, peak temperatures, and cooling rates, are still applicable as initial
approximations for conduction heat flow in the workpiece when an inert gas or nitrogen is used as
the assist gas. When oxygen or air is used as the assist gas, however, qs cannot be neglected, as the
exothermic reaction is then significant enough to influence the resulting temperatures.❦
❦ ❦
❦
296 LASER CUTTING AND DRILLING
For a more accurate analysis, however, the continuity equation, Navier–Stokes equation, and the
thermal equation will have to be solved numerically, with the appropriate boundary conditions for
the gas flow, melt flow, and solid workpiece regimes.
Example 9.1 A 2.5 mm thick aluminum plate is cut using a 1.5 kW laser. If the resulting kerf width
is 0.3 mm; the ambient temperature is 25 ∘C; and 5% of the incident laser beam is absorbed by the
plate, determine the cutting speed. You may assume that there is no vaporization, and that there are
no energy losses by conduction, convection, or radiation.
Solution:
We apply the discussion in Chapter 4 to this problem. The material properties are obtained from
Appendices 4.D and 4.E as:
Average density, 𝜌 =2700 kg/m3
Average specific heat, c =900 J/kg K
Latent heat of fusion, L =397 kJ/kg
Melting temperature, Tm =660.4 ∘C
From Eq. (4.1), we have
Qa = q × t = macpΔTm + maLm + macpΔTv + maLv + Ql
where q is the power supplied and t is the cutting time. Since it is assumed that there is no vaporiza￾tion, and that there are no energy losses by conduction, convection, or radiation, we have
q × t = macpΔTm + maLm = 𝜌V(cpΔTm + Lm)
or
q × t = 𝜌 × l × 𝑤k × h(cpΔTm + Lm)
where l is the length of the cut that is made, 𝑤k is the kerf width, and h is the plate thickness. Thus,
the average cutting speed, uc, is
uc = l
t

𝜌 × 𝑤k × h(cpΔTm + Lm)

= 38.23 mm∕s = 2.3 m∕min
9.1.5 Quality of Cut Part
The major factors that determine the quality of the cut part are the surface striations, dross formation,
and cracking. In the following sections, we discuss the mechanisms of striation and dross formation.
Cracking is discussed in relation to specific materials in Section 9.1.6 and also more extensively in
Section 5.2.2.
9.1.5.1 Striations of the Cut Surface The surfaces cut using a laser beam normally have a nearly
periodic striation pattern (Figure 9.17a), that results in a surface roughness which may also vary in
the thickness direction (Figure 9.17b), depending on the processing conditions.❦

pattern. (b) Variation of striation pattern in the thickness direction for relatively thick materials. Source: From
(a) Ready (2001), with permission from Springer Nature; (b) Powell et al. (1988)/SPIE.
Primary causes of these striations are the following:
1. Vibrations in the motion unit.
2. Fluctuations in the laser power.
3. Fluctuations in the gas flow.
4. Hydrodynamics of the molten metal flow.
A unique aspect of the striations is the two distinct patterns evident on the surface (Figure 9.15b).
One pattern is closer to the upper surface of the workpiece, with relatively fine striations. The other
pattern is on the lower portion of the cut surface, with relatively coarse striations. The two patterns
are separated by a distinct line that is almost parallel to the workpiece surface. The two striation
patterns result from the temperature distribution in the molten layer in the vertical direction, being
higher in the upper portion compared to the lower portion.
The speed of the assist gas as it enters the kerf is generally subsonic. However, its tempera￾ture increases as it penetrates deeper into the kerf, resulting in a decrease in the gas density. In a
sense, then, the cut acts as a converging nozzle, increasing the gas flow velocity. When the flow
reaches sonic velocities, it becomes turbulent and thus changes the dynamics of the molten layer.
The turbulence in the gas flow also cools the molten layer more effectively, and since the oscillation
frequency of the molten layer when subjected to perturbations is higher for higher temperatures, the
frequency of the striation pattern is lower for the lower portion of the cut surface. The character￾istic frequencies of the oscillations depend on the workpiece thickness and may be of the order of
103 cycles/s, increasing with cutting speed. As the thickness of the cut piece increases, the striations
tend to become irregular, and the average roughness of the cut surface increases (Table 9.3).
The increase in roughness of the lower portions of the cut surface with workpiece thickness is
also partly due to the inability to provide adequate energy on the lower portion of the workpiece to
produce molten metal of very low viscosity.
9.1.5.2 Dross Formation Dross is essentially material that clings to the lower edge of the
workpiece and appears as solidified drops after laser cutting (Figure 9.18). The formation of dross❦

depends on the surface tension and viscosity of the molten material. The higher the surface tension
or viscosity, the greater the tendency to form dross, since that prevents smooth flowing of the molten
material out of the reaction zone. Inert gas-assisted cutting has a greater tendency to form dross
as compared to oxygen-assisted cutting of the same material, since the surface tension of the pure
metal is generally greater than that of its oxide. Thus, higher pressures (over 1 MPa or 10 bars) are
required to achieve dross-free cutting with inert gas assist than with oxygen assist. Furthermore,❦
❦ ❦
❦
LASER CUTTING 299
the dross formed during inert gas-assisted cutting is usually more difficult to remove than the more
brittle oxide dross formed when oxygen assist is used.
9.1.6 Material Considerations
The effectiveness of a laser in processing a given material depends on the properties of the material,
for example absorptivity (1 – reflectance) at that wavelength; thermal conductivity; melting and
boiling points; heat of reaction; and surface tension of the molten material. The reflectance,
thermal, and physical properties of some common metals are summarized in Appendices 4.D–4.F.
In Sections 9.1.6.1–9.1.6.2, we consider the behavior of both metals and nonmetals when cut with
a laser.
9.1.6.1 Metals
Plain Carbon Steels Oxygen-assisted cutting is normally used for carbon steels where the exother￾mic reaction between oxygen and iron aids in the cutting process, resulting in cutting speeds which
are much higher than those achieved when inert gas is used. The exothermic reaction is given by the
following equation:
Fe +
1
2
O2 = FeO + Energy (258 kJ∕mol) at 2000 K (9.10)
2Fe +
3
2
O2 = Fe2O3 + Energy (827 kJ∕mol) at 2000 K (9.11)
Oxygen-assisted cutting also helps reduce dross formation, since the viscosity of the molten metal
decreases when oxidized, making it easier to be removed by the gas jet. The presence of phosphorus
and sulfur in the carbon steel can cause burnout along the cut edge. An increase in carbon content
of the steel tends to improve the edge quality, but with a greater tendency for cracking in the HAZ
(Section 5.2.2).
Galvanized Steel Laser cutting of galvanized steel often results in rough edges with extensive dross.
This is most likely due to the formation of zinc oxide which does not flow easily. To obtain reasonable
quality, lower cutting speeds are normally used, compared to the speeds used for uncoated steels.
Stainless Steels The small HAZ associated with laser cutting minimizes any impact that the cutting
process may have on its corrosion resistance. In using oxygen assist, the heat of reaction that results
is not as significant as that associated with plain carbon steels. Thus, the cutting speeds achieved for
stainless steels are relatively lower than those for carbon steels. As a result, oxygen assist is normally
not recommended for cutting of stainless steels, especially since the burning caused by the assist gas
may be detrimental to the cut quality. Ferritic and martensitic stainless steels tend to produce clean
and smooth-edged cuts, while austenitic stainless steels tend to have dross sticking out from the
lower surface of the workpiece. This is primarily due to the high viscosity of molten nickel.
Alloy and Tool Steels The edges produced in laser cutting of high alloy steels such as AISI 4340
steel are often clean and square. This is essentially due to the more precise control of the alloying
element contents of such materials. Likewise, a number of tool steels are also good candidates for
laser cutting. However, the tungsten-based tool steels, Groups T and H, retain a lot of heat in the
molten state, resulting in often burned out cuts.
Aluminum and Its Alloys Aluminum and its alloys are highly reflective (up to 97%) of the high
10.6 μm CO2 laser beam wavelength. This, coupled with their relatively high thermal conductivity
(≈247 W/m K), makes it difficult to initiate cutting in aluminum alloys. High beam intensities,❦
❦ ❦
❦
300 LASER CUTTING AND DRILLING
achieved using either superpulsing or hyperpulsing (Section 8.1.4), are thus necessary to cut
aluminum alloys. Absorption of the laser beam at the top surface can be enhanced by using any of
the coating techniques discussed in Section 11.1.2.3, but anodizing aluminum has been found to
be effective. This is done by coating the base material with a thin layer (approximately 20 μm) of
Al2O3. Al2O3 is highly absorptive (≈100%) of the infrared CO2 laser beam at thicknesses greater
than 5 μm. Absorptivity can also be improved by graphite coating.
Aluminum undergoes a highly exothermic reaction with oxygen as:
4Al + 3O2 = 2Al2O3 + Energy (1670 kJ∕mol) at 293 K (9.12)
which can increase cutting speeds to some extent. However, the exothermic reaction is not as effec￾tive in increasing the cutting speeds for the same amount of released energy as compared to the case
of iron. This is because the resulting oxide layer, aluminum oxide (Al2O3), reduces the diffusion
of atoms to the reaction front, thereby reducing the oxidation rate. The oxide layer is periodically
disrupted during the cutting process by the pressurized oxygen jet, permitting some amount of oxi￾dation to occur. The function of assist gas in cutting these materials is thus primarily to eject the
molten metal. As a result, oxygen assist is normally not recommended for cutting aluminum.
Dross formation can be a problem in cutting aluminum. This is because the high thermal con￾ductivity of the base material results in a low temperature melt. This results in the surface ten￾sion of the molten layer being relatively high, and thus more difficult to eject, leaving dross at
the bottom edge of the cut. The dross formed is easily removed by mechanical means, though.
The high thermal conductivity of the base material may sometimes lead to overheating of small
components during cutting. This, combined with the low melting temperature may even result in
widescale melting. This can be prevented by spraying either water or soluble oil on the component
during cutting. The water is kept away by the pressure of the gas jet and cools the component by
evaporation.
Laser cutting sometimes produces intergranular cracks (cracks that preferentially propagate along
grain boundaries) on the surface of some aluminum alloys, making them unsuitable for aircraft struc￾tural components.
Copper and Its Alloys Both the conductivity (≈398 W/m K) and reflectivity (up to 98.4%) of cop￾per are higher than those of aluminum, making it even more difficult to process with a CO2 laser.
Even though the exothermic reaction associated with the process can increase the cutting speeds, the
energy released is relatively small:
2Cu +

2
O2 = Cu2O + Energy (167 kJ∕mol) at 293 K (9.13)
Cu +
1
2
O2 = CuO + Energy (155 kJ∕mol) at 293 K (9.14)
Any increase in cutting speed is primarily due to increased absorption that results from the for￾mation of the highly absorptive oxide layer in the vicinity of the cut.
A number of copper alloys such as brass and bronze are more effectively processed due to a
reduced reflectivity and thermal conduction.
Titanium and Its Alloys Titanium is highly effective in absorbing the CO2 laser beam. The exother￾mic reaction between oxygen and titanium when oxygen assist gas is used greatly enhances the cut￾ting efficiency, thereby increasing the cutting speeds. The reaction with oxygen may be expressed as:
Ti + O2 = TiO2 + Energy (912 kJ∕mol) at 293 K (9.15)❦

titanium alloy, Ti6Al4V, using high-pressure argon assist gas. Source: From Powell et al. (1988)/SPIE.
A relatively thick and brittle oxide layer (of the order of 1–3 mm) is normally produced along the
cut edge, since the reaction is very rapid at the high cutting temperatures. When a Ti6Al4V titanium
alloy is cut with a laser using high-pressure inert gas, the resulting variation of oxygen content with
depth from the cutting edge is illustrated in Figure 9.19.
This process is mainly useful in applications where the oxide layer is not detrimental, such as low
service life or electrical applications where titanium may be used for corrosion resistance, rigidity,
and its lightweight characteristics. However, for aerospace applications where they are extensively
used for their toughness, fatigue resistance, and high strength-to-weight ratio, these properties are
highly degraded by the oxide layer formed. Cutting titanium with oxygen assist for such applications
is therefore undesirable. Thus, it may be preferable to use an inert gas assist when cutting titanium
alloys for aerospace applications, but at a reduced cutting rate which may be an order of magnitude
lower than that attainable when using oxygen-assist. On the other hand, there is a tendency for dross
to form on the underside of the cut edge under such circumstances. As an example, high cutting
speeds of about 3.6 m/min can be obtained in cutting a 6.4 mm thick plate with 500 W power using
oxygen-assist.
Nickel and Its Alloys Pure nickel has a relatively low thermal conductivity (≈59 W/m K) and reflec￾tivity (up to 94%) compared to those of copper and aluminum, making it easier to cut using lasers.
The use of oxygen assist does improve cutting speeds as a result of the exothermic reaction:

O2 = NiO + Energy (244 kJ∕mol) at 293 K (9.16)
This is more effective when cutting Ni–Fe alloys. Some nickel alloys, however, have reflectivi￾ties and conductivities that make them more difficult to process with lasers. Furthermore, the high
viscosity of molten nickel results in dross formation.
Despite the relative ease with which a number of nickel alloys can be processed with a laser,
the metallurgical effects of the process, even in the small HAZ, precludes its use in some aerospace
applications such as jet engines where the working environment can be aggressive.❦

9.1.6.2 Nonmetals
Polymers In cutting polymers, the intense laser beam tends to break down the polymer chains.
Edges produced in cutting thermoplastics appear polished as a result of resolidified melting. As the
strength of the polymer increases, there is a tendency for charring to occur along the cut edge, since
more energy is then required to break down the bonds. Polyester and polycarbonate are relatively
easier to cut, while with PVC (polyvinyl chloride), phenolic, and polyimide, a significant amount
of decomposed material may be found along the cut edge. Care must always be taken to contain
hazardous and/or corrosive fumes that may be generated in the processing of polymers. It is generally
preferable to use air rather than oxygen in cutting polymeric materials.
Both natural and synthetic rubber are effectively cut in thicknesses up to 19 mm using lasers, and
they tend to exhibit slight stickiness along the edge when freshly cut.
Composites Since composites consist of different materials, the cutting conditions are determined
by only one of the component materials, which may result in degradation of the other materials
during cutting. One approach to this problem is to cut at higher speeds using higher-power lasers.
Thin sheets (say, less than 0.5 mm) of laminated composites with a polymeric material as the matrix
can be trimmed using lasers before they are cured. Thicker sections or fully cured composites often
result in charring, delamination, and thermal damage along the cut edge. When the properties of the
constituent materials are similar, the composite material is then easier to process using a laser. In all
cases, care must also be exercised in containing hazardous fumes and material.
Carbon fiber-reinforced plastic (CFRP) composites are being increasingly used in the aerospace
(aircraft wings) and automotive (panels) industries. Cutting the material is a necessary step in pro￾duction of components. However, with conventional machining operations, the abrasive nature of
the carbon fibers results in rapid tool wear and thus high processing costs. In addition, high contact
forces may cause delamination during machining and abrasive waterjet cutting. With lasers being
noncontact, they have an advantage in that respect. On the other hand, an issue of concern in using
lasers is the resulting HAZ (Section 5.1.3). Other defects that can result with lasers include micro￾cracks, delamination, cavities, and protruding fibers. The HAZ size is found to be greater in the
direction parallel to the fibers because of the relatively high fiber conductivity. Since the energy per
unit length is smaller at higher speeds, multi-pass operations are often used (especially for thick
materials) at high speeds to reduce the overall HAZ size.
Quartz and Glass The relatively low coefficient of expansion of quartz makes it easier to cut in
comparison with glass. The high coefficient of thermal expansion of glass results in thermal shock
that tends to form edge cracks.
One approach to cutting such brittle materials is by first laser scribing to remove a small amount
of material from the surface of the glass, and then applying force by flexing, to fracture the material
along the line of scribing. This requires only a small power density, resulting in a very small HAZ
size. Another approach involves controlled thermal fracture, which takes advantage of the localized
thermal stresses that are set up due to the high coefficient of thermal expansion and high beam inten￾sity to fracture the material. The process is quite controllable, with the fracture essentially following
the path of the beam.
Ceramics The high transverse temperature gradients associated with laser processing can gener￾ate relatively high thermal stresses that cause cracking in ceramic materials, which are inherently
brittle. Furthermore, the thermal conductivity decreases rapidly with increasing temperature in such
materials, significantly reducing thermal diffusion into the body of the workpiece. Preheating the
workpiece to a relatively high temperature before cutting or preheating the region directly ahead of
the laser beam reduces the transverse temperature gradient, and thus the tendency to crack.❦
❦ ❦
❦
LASER CUTTING 303
Cutting of alumina often results in cracking. Cracks also develop during cutting of silicon carbide
of thickness greater than 3 mm. Silicon nitride, on the other hand, can be cut to 4 mm thickness at
about 10 mm/s. The surface roughness obtained when zirconia is cut is about 10 μm, while silicon
nitride results in a surface roughness of about 100 μm.
Textiles and Fabrics Lasers are also used in the textile industry to cut fabric. To increase produc￾tivity, several layers of fabric may be stacked up and cut at the same time. However, this causes the
edges of the individual layers to become welded together. This may be prevented by pressing the
layers together to prevent the cutting gas from entering sideways between them.
Wood Wood can generally be cut using CO2 lasers. The cutting rate tends to increase as the
wood’s density and moisture content decreases but appears to be independent of the grain direction.
One problem that is often encountered is charring of the cut edge during cutting. However, the extent
of charring is usually very small, of the order of microns in depth, and reduces with increasing
cutting speed.
Paper and Cardboard Laser cutting of paper and cardboard has an advantage over conventional
cutting, since it does not result in broken fibers which may remain attached to the paper and interfere
with printing.
Example 9.2 A 1.0 kW CO2 laser is used to cut a 4.5 mm thick titanium alloy plate using an inert
gas assist. The resulting cutting speed and kerf width are 3.0 m/min and 400 μm, respectively.
(a) Calculate the surface temperature at a point 4.0 mm behind the laser beam and 3.5 mm to one
side, if the heat transfer efficiency is 90%, and the ambient temperature is 25 ∘C.
(b) Estimate the size of the HAZ for this process if a cold-rolled alloy recrystallizes at a temperature
equal to half the absolute melting temperature of pure titanium.
(c) Obtain the surface temperature for the point in (a) if oxygen assist was used, and 50% of the
exothermic reaction contributed to the cutting process.
Solution:
Again, we apply the discussion in Chapter 4 to this problem. The material properties (approximated
to be the same as for pure titanium) are obtained from Appendices 4.D and 4.E as
Average density, 𝜌 =4507 kg/m3 =4.507 × 10−6 kg/mm3.
Average specific heat, cp =99.3 J/kg K.
Thermal conductivity, k =11.4 W/m K = 0.0114 W/mm K.

304 LASER CUTTING AND DRILLING
Now the laser power, q1, available at the workpiece is
q1 = 1000 × 0.9 = 900 W

is

9.1.7 Advantages and Disadvantages of Laser Cutting
9.1.7.1 Advantages The general advantages of laser cutting in comparison with conventional cut￾ting processes such as plasma arc cutting, electrical discharge machining (EDM), oxy-acetylene
flame cutting, and mechanical cutting are the following:
1. It results in a narrow kerf width, thereby reducing waste. The reduced kerf width also makes
the production of arbitrary contours more feasible.
2. Relatively high cutting speeds.
3. Small HAZ due to the relatively small total heat input. Thus, there is very little damage to the
base material, making it suitable for heat-sensitive and burnable materials. There is also very
little residual stress and distortion.
4. It is a noncontact process, and thus, there is no tool wear and no mechanical forces that could
damage delicate workpieces. The lack of mechanical forces also implies less complex fixtures
to hold the workpiece in place.
5. Good for both very soft (highly deformable) materials such as paper and very hard (difficult
to cut) materials such as diamond.
6. High degree of flexibility (which may facilitate the cutting of complex geometries) and low
level of noise.
7. It results in cut edges which are square, and not rounded, as occurs in many other thermal
cutting methods.
9.1.7.2 Disadvantages The principal disadvantages of laser cutting are the following:
1. Highly reflective and conductive materials such as gold and silver are difficult to cut using
lasers. Methods for improving the absorptivity of metals in general for the laser beam are
discussed in Section 11.1.2.3, while those for facilitating cutting in highly reflective materials
are discussed in Section 8.1.4.
2. The melting and rapid quenching associated with the process result in a hard edge of the cut
piece for hardenable materials.
3. Laser cutting has traditionally been limited to cutting thin materials, that is, less than a few mil￾limeters thick. Furthermore, it is generally limited to cutting through the materials. Thus, blind
slots, pockets, or holes are difficult to cut accurately using a laser.❦
❦ ❦
❦
306 LASER CUTTING AND DRILLING
4. The initial capital cost of a laser cutting system is relatively high, about two orders of magni￾tude higher than that of an oxy-fuel system.
5. Processing of certain materials (such as polymers) may result in the production of dangerous
exhaust fumes.
9.1.8 Specific Comparison with Conventional Processes
In Sections 9.1.8.1–9.1.8.4, laser cutting is compared with specific alternate processes. Figure 9.20
starts with a numerical comparison of the laser, oxy-acetylene, and plasma arc cutting processes.
This is followed in Figure 9.21 with a graphical comparison of EDM, laser cutting, and plasma
arc cutting with respect to kerf size, accuracy, maximum cutting speed, and HAZ size. Additional
comparison is then made with abrasive waterjet machining and punching/nibbling.
9.1.8.1 Laser, Plasma Arc, and Oxy-Acetylene (Oxy-Fuel) Cutting Each of these three processes
uses heat to melt and remove material. Two attributes that are compared in Figure 9.21 for these
processes are the kerf width and HAZ size. For both attributes, laser cutting is most advantageous,
offering the least kerf width and HAZ size.
9.1.8.2 Laser Cutting and Electrical Discharge Machining (EDM) Unlike the previous case,
each of these two processes has certain advantages over the other (Figure 9.21). EDM results
in better accuracy and smaller kerf width and HAZ size than laser cutting. Furthermore, EDM
is able to cut through relatively thick material. On the other hand, laser cutting is performed at
much higher speeds. In addition, the accuracy, kerf width, and HAZ size advantages of EDM are
only slight.
9.1.8.3 Laser Cutting and Abrasive Waterjet Machining Abrasive waterjet machining involves
cutting through a material using high-pressure water jet. Thus, it does not produce a HAZ.
It is also able to cut much thicker materials than does laser cutting. However, the kerf width
produced in waterjet machining is less accurate than that associated with laser cutting. Furthermore,
waterjet machining is a contact process, and as such, may cause workpiece deflection for weaker
materials.
Waterjet machining is often recommended as the process of choice in cutting composites, mainly
due to the thermal effect of laser cutting.

9.1.8.4 Laser Cutting and Punching/Nibbling The primary advantage of laser cutting over
punching or nibbling is that it is more flexible, since it does not require tooling. Laser cutting has
a definite advantage for small production runs, while at higher production volumes, it loses its
advantage, since traditional punching operations are then much faster.
9.1.9 Special Techniques
One special technique that has been developed to enhance the capability of laser cutting is the
laser-assisted oxygen cutting process (Lasox). Conventional laser cutting is limited to thicknesses
of up to 25 mm, which can be achieved with a laser power of about 3 kW in steels. As discussed in
Section 9.1.5.1, the roughness of the cut surface increases as the workpiece thickness increases, as
a result of striations which are formed in the thicker material.
The Lasox process is designed to significantly increase the thicknesses that can be cut with a laser
of given power without deterioration in quality. The principle is similar to traditional laser cutting
and is illustrated schematically in Figure 9.22.
In this process, the laser beam preheats the surface of the workpiece to a temperature close to
its melting temperature (>1000 ∘C for steels), and this facilitates melting of the workpiece by an
oxygen gas jet which flows coaxially with the beam. Once the reaction is initiated on the surface, it
continues through the workpiece thickness. The cutting action is driven primarily by the gas jet. The
footprint of the laser beam is made to cover an area which is just slightly larger than the footprint
of the oxygen jet. This is achieved by using a short focal length lens to maximize beam divergence
on leaving the nozzle, and yet maintain reasonable stand-off distances. As an illustration, 20–50 mm❦

steel plates can be cut with laser power levels of 700–1100 W at speeds of 0.15–0.5 m/min if the
beam diameter on the workpiece surface is 4 mm, gas jet diameter is 3 mm, nozzle exit diameter is
2.5 mm, gas pressure is about 8 bar, and the beam absorption coefficient is 30%.
The surface quality obtained under these conditions is much better than that obtained by either
oxy-acetylene cutting alone or by traditional laser cutting, which would require much higher power.
The taper that results is also less than 1∘, and the top edge is square.
9.2 LASER DRILLING
Laser drilling is used in applications such as jet engine turbine airfoils, injector nozzles, and watches.
The process involves applying a laser beam to heat up the material to its melting point or vaporization
temperature. When vaporization occurs, it generates a keyhole that results in increased absorptivity,
further increasing the hole depth. The molten material or vapor formed is blown away using an
assist gas. When the vapor or molten material is ejected out into the surrounding atmosphere, some
of it may condense on the workpiece surface as spatter. Very small diameter holes (of the order of
microns) can be drilled using a laser, resulting in high aspect ratios.
Our discussion on laser drilling starts with an outline of the different ways in which a laser may
be used to drill a hole, followed by a discussion of the basic process parameters. An analysis of
the process is then presented, first mentioning the governing equations that will need to be used
for a rigorous analysis, followed by an approximate analysis that enables the drilling velocity to
be estimated. The advantages and disadvantages of laser drilling are then presented, and finally,
potential applications.❦

9.2.1 Forms of Laser Drilling
There are three ways in which a hole can be produced by laser drilling (Figure 9.23):
1. Single-pulse (or on center) drilling.
2. Multi-pulse percussion drilling.
3. Trepanning.
9.2.1.1 Single-Pulse Drilling This form of drilling involves using a single pulse of laser beam,
with a pulse duration of about 1 ms, and energy of several Joules, resulting in a peak power of

310 LASER CUTTING AND DRILLING
the order of 10–100 kW. The material in contact with the laser beam is partly melted and partly
evaporated and blown out backward using a gas jet to form the hole. The exceedingly high energy
required for drilling very deep holes may result in poor tolerances, reduce the pulse frequency obtain￾able with the laser, thereby reducing productivity, and increase plasma formation. Plasma formation
may affect the hole quality as the laser beam is scattered and/or absorbed and re-radiated to the walls.
9.2.1.2 Multi-Pulse Percussion Drilling Multi-pulse percussion drilling involves drilling a hole
using a series of pulses. The hole quality is improved (for example, reduced tapering along the
hole length) since the peak power required is reduced, and with it, the amount of molten material
and plasma produced during any single-pulse period. However, the series of pulses used reduces the
production rate. Typical pulse duration ranges from about 100 fs to 2 ms.
In both percussion modes, the molten and/or evaporated material is ejected out of the hole by
the excess pressure of the gas or plasma in the hole over ambient, and this increases with the beam
intensity. With increasing hole depth, the pressure required to blow out the molten material increases
accordingly. One disadvantage of percussion drilling is that the material that is removed is blown
backward toward the lens.
9.2.1.3 Trepanning Trepanning involves cutting out the hole by performing a relative motion
(circular or noncircular) between the laser beam and the workpiece. The process is essentially one
of laser cutting. Thus, large diameter holes can be produced, with improved hole quality and repeata￾bility. Another advantage of the process is that the material that is removed is blown away from the
lens. However, the process is time-consuming, typically requiring about 1 second for producing a
hole. Holes drilled by this method are often limited to depths less than 12 mm.
9.2.2 Process Parameters
The type of laser selected for a given application is determined largely by the drilling technique
used, the material, and geometry of the hole to be drilled. Nd:YAG lasers are more extensively used
in drilling metals than CO2 lasers when thicknesses exceed 0.5 mm, since absorption of the shorter
wavelength 1.06 μm energy by the plasma formed is relatively small, compared to absorption at the
10.6 μm wavelength of the CO2 laser. Furthermore, higher peak pulse powers are attainable with
the Nd:YAG laser. However, both the capital and running costs of CO2 lasers are lower than those
of the Nd:YAG lasers of equivalent power.
The principal parameters associated with percussion laser drilling may be broadly categorized as
the beam characteristics (inputs), process characteristics (outputs), and process defects. These are
further discussed in the following paragraphs.
9.2.2.1 Beam Characteristics The principal beam characteristics that influence the drilling pro￾cess include pulse energy, pulse duration, number of pulses, and beam quality. A typical value of the
power density used would be 5 × 107 W/cm2 at a peak power of 8 kW, using a lens of focal length
100 mm.
Pulse Energy: The hole depth generally increases with increasing pulse energy. At much higher
energy levels, however, there tends to be greater deformation at the top surface.
Pulse Duration: Laser drilling pulses typically fall in the range of 100 fs to 2 ms. Higher qual￾ity holes (for example, reduced taper and distortion) are obtained with shorter beam pulses.
However, the number of pulses required to drill a given hole then increases.❦
❦ ❦
❦
LASER DRILLING 311
Number of Pulses: Generally, hole taper can be reduced in holes with a high depth-to-diameter
ratio by using a relatively large number of pulses, while for low depth-to-diameter holes,
fewer pulses result in a better quality hole.
Beam Quality: Beams of lower M2 values or higher quality can be focused to a smaller diameter
and also have a longer depth of focus. This increases penetration depth for drilling and cutting,
while improving hole quality (high depth-to-diameter ratio with reduced taper), especially for
small diameter holes.
9.2.2.2 Drilling Characteristics The principal characteristics of the laser drilling process include
the hole diameter, depth, and drilling angle.
Hole Diameter: Typical diameters of laser-drilled holes range in size from 1 μm to 1.5 mm.
Hole sizes smaller than 1 μm have been produced using femtosecond lasers. Maintaining a
reasonable depth of focus for holes smaller than 12.7 μm is difficult with traditional lasers.
For holes of diameter greater than 1.5 mm, it might be more appropriate to use trepanning,
which is a relatively slower process.
Hole Depth: In using Nd:YAG lasers, depth-to-diameter ratios as high as 30 : 1 can be achieved.
Drilling Angle: This is the angle that the hole or beam axis makes with the workpiece surface.
The power density incident on the workpiece surface is maximum when the workpiece is
normal to the beam axis. This configuration also permits the widest range of focal lengths
and focusing angles. The drawback, however, is that it results in any reflected beam being
redirected back into the optical system. Furthermore, material expelled during the process
may be deposited on the lens. This problem may be mitigated by the use of a coaxial gas flow
or protective transparent cover plate for the lens.
Increasing the angle between the hole axis and the normal to the workpiece surface reduces the
amount of reflected beam and debris that is directed at the lens. However, short focal length lenses
are then more difficult to use, and so are gas nozzles. Furthermore, since the beam is then spread
over a wider area, the power density is reduced.
9.2.2.3 Process Defects The product quality is affected by defects such as taper of the hole walls,
recast, and microcracking.
Taper: Erosion of molten and vaporized material from the hole, and the conical shape of the
focused beam, together result in tapering of the drilled hole. The extent of taper is influenced
by the pulse energy, number of pulses, and optical system design. It can be minimized by
using long focal length lenses, which tend to have longer depth of focus. Tapering is usually
not a problem for very small hole depths, say, less than 0.25 mm.
Recast: Recast is the result of resolidified excess molten or vaporized material that is not com￾pletely removed. It essentially remains on the newly created surface.
Microcracking: Microcracking normally arises when drilling brittle or high hardenability mate￾rials and often results from high cooling rates or temperature gradients.
9.2.3 Analysis of Material Removal During Drilling
As indicated in Section 9.1, when a pulsed beam of adequate intensity is incident on a substrate,
the absorbed energy may melt and/or vaporize the substrate material. These are the mechanisms by
which drilling takes place. Depending on the energy source and the substrate material, this may occur❦

by photochemical ablation or photothermal ablation. Photochemical ablation is briefly discussed in
Section 9.1.1.3. In this section, we focus on photothermal ablation, which may occur by normal
vaporization, normal boiling, or phase explosion.
Normal Vaporization: it refers to the transformation from the condensed phase (solid or liquid) to
the vapor phase as atoms or molecules are emitted from the extreme outer surface. It can occur
at any fluence and pulse duration, and there is no temperature threshold. The process does
not involve nucleation, and the surface temperature is not constant since the vapor pressure
is not zero. The contribution of normal vaporization to ablation is insignificant at timescales
shorter than 1 ns and also for very low temperatures. The rate at which the drilled surface
recedes during normal vaporization, that is, the drilling velocity, ud, can be obtained from the
Hertz–Knudsen equation as:

where kc is the condensation (or vaporization) coefficient, Lv is the latent heat of vaporization
(J/kg), mm is the mass of the atom or molecule (particle)(kg), Pa is the ambient gas pressure
(boiling pressure) (Pa), Ps is the saturated (equilibrium) vapor pressure (Pa), Tv is the vapor￾ization (boiling) temperature corresponding to Pa, with the assumption that there is no vapor
present in the ambient and no recondensation (K), and 𝜆a is the mean atomic spacing of the
target (μm).
Normal Boiling: it requires a relatively long pulse period and involves the nucleation of het￾erogeneous vapor bubbles which may form at the outer surface of the liquid, in the bulk of
the liquid, or at the interface between the liquid and surrounding solid. The normal boiling
process occurs within the absorption depth (1/𝛼, where 𝛼 is the absorption coefficient). The
surface temperature is constant and the same as the vaporization temperature corresponding
to the pressure at the surface. The temperature gradient at the surface and also directly beneath
it is zero (that is, 𝜕T
𝜕z = 0).
Phase Explosion: (also known as explosive boiling). For this to occur, the laser fluence has
to be sufficiently high and the pulse duration sufficiently short such that the temperature of
the surface and the region immediately beneath it reaches about 90% of the thermodynamic
critical temperature (that is, 0.90Tct). That results in homogeneous bubble nucleation, and
the material undergoes a rapid transition from a superheated liquid to a vapor/liquid droplet
mixture. Homogeneous nucleation is feasible, since the rate at which it occurs increases sig￾nificantly near the critical temperature. Here too, the temperature gradient at the surface and
also directly beneath it is zero.
Now we focus again on normal vaporization where the substrate material is first heated through
the melting point to the vaporization temperature. In this case, part of the beam energy is used to melt
the substrate, and the molten material (liquid layer) formed is in direct contact with the substrate.
Part of this molten material is further vaporized by the beam. The vapor produced creates a vapor or
recoil pressure which pushes the vapor away from the target and also exerts a force on the molten
material and expels it sideways.
Material removal may thus occur in both liquid and vapor forms. In the liquid form, the thickness
of the liquid layer is estimated to be of the order of 10 μm and decreases with increasing power.❦

In the vapor form, the vaporization rate increases with an increase in power. However, the liquid
expulsion rate increases to a maximum and then decreases. At lower power, the vapor temperature is
low. Consequently, the expulsion rate is low because of low recoil pressure. At high power, the vapor
temperature is high. On the other hand, the thickness of the liquid layer is then so small that the liquid
expulsion rate is also reduced. Generally, at low beam power, liquid expulsion is the predominant
form of material removal, while vaporization is the predominant form at high power. The process of
liquid expulsion is illustrated in Figure 9.24. For beams of much greater intensity and shorter pulse
duration, the resulting recoil pressure may be so high as to induce shock waves which are transmitted
through the material. Shock waves may also be generated as a result of the interaction of the laser
with the plasma.
In the next section, a fundamental approach for analyzing the laser drilling process is outlined.
Since the governing equations on which this approach is based are nonlinear, they can only be fully
solved using numerical methods. Therefore, in the subsequent section, we present an approximate
method for obtaining a quick estimate of the rate at which laser drilling takes place.
9.2.3.1 Basic Analysis The governing equations necessary for analyzing the laser drilling process
are the basic continuity, momentum, and energy equations, with the appropriate boundary condi￾tions. There are two interfaces associated with the material removal process. One is the solid–liquid
interface which can be treated as a conventional Stefan problem, Section 6.1.1. The other is the
liquid–vapor interface, adjacent to which may exist a Knudsen layer with a thickness of a few molec￾ular mean free paths. Across this layer, continuum theories are no longer valid since discontinuities❦

exist in temperature, density, and pressure. The discontinuity across the Knudsen layer is the basis
for the shock wave.
9.2.3.2 Approximate Analysis In this section, we present a simple extension of the Hertz–
Knudsen equation for estimating the rate (velocity) of the drilling process, which takes into account
the contribution of the ejected molten material. The following assumptions are made:
1. Heat conduction and vapor absorption losses are negligible.
2. The thermal properties of the material are constant, and thermal expansion is negligible.
3. The skin depth (≈10−5 mm) (Section 8.1.6) is negligible.
If we consider the energy flux carried away with the expulsed material to be equal to the irradiance
or power density (power per unit area) absorbed by the material, Ia, then we can write
Ia = 𝜑vΔHv + 𝜑lΔHl (9.18)
where ΔH is the specific energy absorbed by the expulsed material (J/kg), 𝜙 is the expulsion rate
(kg/m2 s), and the subscripts v and l refer to the vapor and liquid, respectively.
The drilling velocity, ud, can be expressed in terms of 𝜙v and 𝜙l as:
ud = 1
𝜌
(𝜑v + 𝜑l) (9.19)
In developing an expression for 𝜙l, one may consider a simple one-dimensional conduction heat
flow for a system with a constant moving heat source. The quasi-static temperature distribution, T,
in the medium for this case, neglecting any phase changes and lateral heat conduction losses, may
be approximated as:
T = I′

(9.20)
where I′
a = Ia − 𝜑vLv is the difference between the absorbed power density and that carried away
from the absorbing layer by the evaporated material (W/m2), Lv is the latent heat of vaporization
(J/kg), ud is the drilling velocity (m/s), 𝜅 is the thermal diffusivity of the material (m2/s), and 𝜉 is
the moving coordinate pointing in the direction of ud.
The rate of evaporation, 𝜙v, of a hot surface at a temperature Th is obtained from the
Hertz–Knudsen equation as:
𝜑v = (1 − R)Ps
( mm
2𝜋kBTh
)1∕2
(9.21)
where kB is Boltzmann’s constant (J/K), mm is the mass of the atom or molecule (particle) (kg), and
R≈0.2 is the mean particle reflection coefficient of the metal surface.
The saturated vapor pressure, Ps, may be approximated by:
Ps = Pa exp [ Lp

where Lp is the heat of evaporation per particle (J/particle), Pa is the ambient pressure (Pa), Th is the
hot surface temperature (K), and Tv is the vaporization temperature (K).❦

The hot surface temperature, Th, may be estimated as the temperature at 𝜉 = 0 in Eq. (9.23). Then

Eq. (9.23) as:
𝛿l =

(9.24)
where Tm is the melting temperature.
The pressure, P, of the evaporating surface acting on the liquid layer pushes the liquid radially
outward with a velocity, ul, determined using Bernoulli’s Eq. (9.1a) as:
ul =

(9.25)
The expelled liquid escapes through an opening (Figure 9.24) that is determined by the beam
radius, 𝑤, of an area Ae given by:
Ae = 2𝜋𝑤𝛿l (9.26)
Since the actual pressure P is about half the saturation pressure Ps (Eq. (9.22)), the liquid expul￾sion rate, 𝜙l, with respect to the irradiated surface is obtained from Eqs. (9.24)–(9.26) as:
𝜑l =

Equations (9.21) and (9.27) give the expulsion rates of the vapor and liquid in terms of the surface
temperature, Th. However, Th, in turn, depends on 𝜙l and 𝜙v, (Eq. (9.23)). Thus, actual calculation
of the expulsion rates will need to be done iteratively. However, for a first approximation, the surface
temperature, Th, may be estimated from Eq. (9.20) and assumed constant.
It must be noted that the drilling speed calculated by this approach refers to the average rate at
which material is removed during the laser pulse. It does not give the overall production rate.
Example 9.3 An Nd:YAG laser generates pulses of intensity 60 MW/cm2 for drilling 200 μm diam￾eter holes in a tungsten plate. Estimate the drilling speed that can be achieved for this operation.
Assume ambient temperature and pressure of 25 ∘C and 0.1 MPa, respectively, and that the diameter

9.2.4 Advantages and Disadvantages of Laser Drilling
9.2.4.1 Advantages The advantages that laser drilling has over conventional drilling are the
following:
1. It is a noncontact process. There are no machining forces, and thus no deflection of a tool
and/or workpiece that would result in dimensional errors in the part produced, or wear of the
tool.
2. Accurate location of holes. In conventional drilling, the drill often deflects on coming in con￾tact with the workpiece, resulting in drill “wandering.” This affects accuracy of hole location
and orientation.
3. There is no chip formation, and thus no need for elaborate chip disposal systems. However,
an appropriate exhaust system is often necessary for the vaporized material.
4. Laser drilling results in high depth-to-diameter aspect ratios, but primarily for holes of rela￾tively small diameter, and depths of a few millimeters.
5. Ability to drill difficult-to-machine materials such as diamond, ceramics, and highly refractory
metals, on which conventional drilling performs poorly.❦
❦ ❦
❦
318 LASER CUTTING AND DRILLING
6. Ability to drill holes with difficult entrance angles. Drilling of holes with low entrance angles
is quite difficult with conventional drills. However, with laser drilling, entrance angles as low
as 10∘ are possible.
7. Ability to drill very small holes. Small diameter conventional drills are liable to break easily.
On the other hand, the lower end of hole sizes that can be drilled using a laser is limited by
the beam size at the focal point, with hole sizes of the order of microns being achievable.
8. High degree of flexibility, enabling a number of operations to be combined in a single setup.
9. High duty cycles and high production rates. Since lasers can be used continuously without
interruption, high duty cycles are achieved, resulting in relatively high production rates.
9.2.4.2 Disadvantages The primary limitations of the laser drilling process include the following:
1. Inability to produce precision blind holes. Lasers are more suited to producing through holes.
2. Inability to drill deep holes. The hole depths that are achieved by laser drilling are relatively
small, being typically a few millimeters deep. As the hole depth increases, the diameter begins
to enlarge due to beam expansion, resulting in a tapered hole.
3. Holes that are close to an edge, and those that intersect other holes are often not effectively
produced by laser drilling.
9.2.5 Applications
Typical applications for holes drilled using Nd:YAG lasers include holes in jet engine turbine airfoils
and combustors (hole sizes about 180 μm–1 mm), injector nozzles, and oil passages in automotive
engine or gear components. Since CO2 lasers are more effectively used on nonmetals, typical drilling
applications involving CO2 lasers include sound suppression holes in aircraft engine liners made
of polymers or polymeric composites, drilling holes in ceramic substrates in the microelectronic
industry, and cigarette paper perforating.
9.3 NEW DEVELOPMENTS
9.3.1 Micromachining
Micromachining involves machining applications that result in feature sizes on the order of tens
of micrometers or less. As indicated in the section on laser drilling, hole diameters of the order
of a few microns can be produced using traditional lasers, with pulse durations ranging from CW
to hundreds of picoseconds. Common lasers used for this purpose include the CO2, Nd:YAG, fiber,
copper vapor, and excimer lasers. However, the mechanism of material removal with such long-pulse
lasers involves both melting and evaporation (Figure 9.24). This results in significant dross formation
(Section 9.1.5.2), which affects hole quality. Excimer lasers, being the exception, result in direct
photochemical ablation (Section 9.1.1.3) due to the ultraviolet wavelength of the beam, and that
improves the hole quality.
When a laser beam is incident on a material, the photon energy is first absorbed by electrons
which then get heated to high temperatures rapidly. The electron energy gets transferred to the lattice
through electron–phonon collisions (Section 4.2.5), resulting in heating of the lattice. The extent
of lattice heating depends on the pulse duration and the electron–phonon coupling. For long pulse
durations, the electrons and lattice can reach thermal equilibrium, and a relatively large portion of the
lattice gets heated by diffusion, with a resulting peak temperature that is relatively low. The material
is then first heated through the melting temperature to the vaporization temperature (if the power❦
❦ ❦
❦
NEW DEVELOPMENTS 319
is high enough). A relatively large volume around the laser focus melts, but only a relatively small
layer of material reaches the vaporization temperature.
As the pulse duration decreases, the laser field intensity increases, and the interaction time gets
shorter. Thus, for much shorter pulse durations, the intensity is much higher, resulting in relatively
high electron temperatures (of the order of tens of electron volts) during the pulse. Most of the
electron–phonon coupling takes place after the pulse and often results in lattice temperatures that are
higher than are achieved with long pulses for the same total energy. Most of the heating is confined to
the interaction zone and passes rapidly through the melting temperature to the vaporization tempera￾ture. Thus, a large fraction of the material in the interaction volume is vaporized, going through a melt
phase very quickly. With ultrashort pulses, when the laser fluence just exceeds the threshold value,
the region that is vaporized can be smaller than the focal area (Figure 9.25). The reproducible fabri￾cation resolution is generally limited to about 100 nm as a result of pulse to pulse energy fluctuations
and beam output variations.
Ultrashort-pulse lasers (≤1 ps) with wavelengths in the visible and near-infrared range there￾fore result in high precision micromachining, with clean and uniform holes or cuts. The breakdown
threshold of such lasers can be determined with high accuracy since it is deterministic. Since the
beam intensity profile can be controlled such that only a specified portion of the focused beam spot
is above the threshold (Figure 9.25), a region of diameter smaller (1 μm or less) than the focused
beam size (5 μm or less) can be ablated, with barely any heat being conducted out of the processing
zone. The mechanics of laser–material interaction that results in ablation under such conditions are
discussed in the following paragraphs.
Absorption of a laser beam that is incident on a material occurs by linear or nonlinear processes.
The absorption results in heating of material in the focal region first to the melting temperature,
and then to the vaporization temperature, depending on the beam intensity and pulse duration. For
radiation outside the ultraviolet range, the absorption mechanisms are different for materials such
as metals and semiconductors which are absorbing, and glasses and plastics which are transparent
dielectric materials. Absorption also depends on laser intensity. For opaque materials, absorption
is linear when the beam pulse duration is long and the intensity low, while nonlinear absorption
becomes dominant when the pulse duration is ultrashort and the intensity high.
9.3.1.1 Transparent Dielectric Materials Absorption for transparent materials results mainly
from nonlinear processes. Avalanche ionization and multiphoton ionization are the nonlinear
mechanisms that cause breakdown.

320 LASER CUTTING AND DRILLING
Avalanche Ionization The bound valence electrons of transparent dielectric materials have an ion￾ization potential or bandgap which is greater than the laser photon energy (Section 2.3.1). Therefore
at low beam intensities (typical of long-pulse lasers), the laser energy is not absorbed by the bound
electrons. However, a few free electrons (seed electrons) that exist in the material as a result of
impurities do absorb laser energy when they collide with bound electrons and lattice (inverse
bremsstrahlung process). Acceleration of the seed electrons provide them with kinetic energy that is
in excess of the ionization potential of the bound electron. Thus as these seed electrons collide with
bound electrons, ionization occurs, resulting in additional free electrons, in much the same way
that a photon interacting with an excited atom results in another photon being generated. Repetition
of this process leads to an avalanche that increases the free-electron density exponentially. At a
critical density (1018/cm3 for pulse durations greater than a nanosecond), the transparent material
breaks down and becomes absorbing. The absorption at the critical density is significant enough
that irreversible damage takes place. At the critical density, the plasma oscillation frequency equals
the laser frequency, and the transparent material becomes totally opaque. For ultrashort pulses, the
critical density, 𝜌e, is given by:
𝜌e = me𝜔2
4𝜋e2 (9.28)
where me is electron mass and 𝜔 is the laser frequency.
The critical electron density is then about 1021/cm3 for lasers in the visible and near-infrared
wavelength range. The breakdown process typically results in the generation of acoustic waves and
radiation of optical plasma or spark at the focus.
Multiphoton Ionization At very high beam intensities, bound electrons of transparent materials
are directly ionized (that is, lifted from the valence band to the conduction band or free energy
level) by multiphoton absorption. This is normally the case with ultrashort-pulse beams and involves
simultaneous absorption of m photons during the pulse such that
mhp𝑣 ≥ Eg (9.29)
where Eg is the bandgap energy or ionization potential.
Generally for the critical density to be achieved that results in irreversible breakdown and there￾fore ablation, the laser fluence must exceed a threshold value, which depends on the pulse duration.
For pulse durations longer than a few tens of picoseconds, the threshold fluence is proportional to
the square root of the pulse duration. Furthermore, there is significant scatter associated with the
threshold fluence, making it more stochastic in nature. Avalanche ionization is the principal mecha￾nism for breakdown in this pulse duration range. For ultrashort pulses, the seed electrons are created
by multiphoton ionization, but even though the actual breakdown process is primarily accomplished
through avalanche ionization, the threshold is more deterministic or precise.
9.3.1.2 Metals and Semiconductors Materials which are absorbing (such as metals and semicon￾ductors) generally have a significant number of free and valence electrons whose ionization potential
(bandgap) is smaller than the laser photon energy. Linear absorption is therefore the predominant
mode when the laser pulse duration is long, resulting in Joule heating. Here too breakdown, which
results in melting and vaporization, is accompanied by the generation of acoustic waves and radiation
of optical plasma or spark at the focus.❦
❦ ❦

NEW DEVELOPMENTS 321
There are two characteristic lengths associated with absorption of the laser beam. One is the skin
depth, 𝛿′
, (Section 8.1.6) which is the distance within which the photon energy is absorbed and may
be expressed as:
𝛿′ = 1
𝛽 (9.30)
where 𝛽 is the decay constant.
The other is the heat diffusion length, lh, which is the distance over which the thermal energy is
conducted during the pulse and can be expressed as:
lh = √𝜅𝜏p (9.31)
where 𝜏p is the pulse duration.
For long pulses, the fluence threshold varies as the square root of the pulse duration since lh > 𝛿′
,
and therefore the volume of material heated by the beam pulse depends on the heat diffusion length.
There is then significant scatter associated with the threshold. Since the volume of material that
is heated is relatively large, significant amount of melting occurs, and during ablation, material is
expelled in both liquid and vapor form by the recoil (vapor) pressure associated with the ablation pro￾cess (Section 9.2.3). The unexpelled molten material resolidifies around the ablated region, resulting
in dross formation (Figure 9.26a). The thickness of melt layer that results for long-pulse lasers can be
as much as 10 times that of the evaporation layer. That means the feature sizes that can be obtained
are relatively large.
When the pulse duration becomes short enough that lh < 𝛿′
, then the threshold becomes inde￾pendent of the pulse duration and is therefore more deterministic. Furthermore, since the energy
absorbed is highly localized, the material in this region is quickly heated through the melting temper￾ature to the vaporization temperature. Most of the ablation process then occurs by direct vaporization,
resulting in more precise and cleaner cuts (Figure 9.26b). A significant portion of the material
is removed after the laser pulse has ended. Even though heat diffusion results in heating of the

surrounding material, the amount of material that melts as a result is relatively small. This is due in
part to the rapid cooling that follows the heating process, and also to the significant amount of energy
that is lost by vaporization. With ultrashort-pulse lasers, the melt thickness may only be about twice
that of the evaporation layer. Thus, submicron feature sizes are achievable.
The dependence of the fluence threshold on the square root of the pulse duration when lh > 𝛿′ also
applies to transparent materials.
Advantages of ultrashort-pulse lasers in relation to material ablation can therefore be summarized
as the following:
1. The precision of the ablation (breakdown) threshold (which depends on the pulse duration,
being higher for the longer pulse duration beam).
2. Reduction in the laser fluence needed to initiate ablation.
3. Significant reduction in HAZ size.
In recent years, ultrashort-pulse lasers have found increasing use in machining microchannels,
such as those used in microfluidics and photovoltaic cells. They have also been used to drill holes of
diameter 35 μm in 1 mm thick stainless steel sheet, resulting in good quality holes with straight sides.
Hole sizes as small as 0.3 μm have been produced in silver films using 200 fs pulses produced by a
Ti:sapphire laser which was focused to a spot size of 3 μm. As with traditional lasers, femtosecond
lasers can be used in machining materials ranging from diamond to biodegradable polymers.
9.3.1.3 Micro-Explosions At very high intensities, material removal can also occur by the process
of micro-explosion, which triggers shock and rarefaction waves, thereby creating voxels that result in
voids within the material. This provides a means for scribing or creating internal geometrical struc￾tures in solid transparent dielectrics such as glasses, polymers, and crystals. The voxel diameters
are as small as 0.2–0.25 μm. The micro-explosion may result from multiphoton absorption, which
is initiated in a highly localized focal volume of a tightly focused beam where the intensity is high
enough (in excess of 1014 W/cm2). Thus, the scribing can occur within the interior of the transpar￾ent material where the beam is focused, at depths of about 50–200 μm. For this to be effective, a
high numerical aperture (about 1.35) lens is necessary. It may also occur as a result of individual
femtosecond pulses that create optical breakdown, resulting in extreme temperature and pressure
conditions.
The observed voxel size is often smaller than what would be expected from a region with intensity
level above the necessary threshold intensity (Figure 9.27). The smaller size is due to self-focusing
as a result of intensity dependence of the refractive index:
n(r) = n0 + n2I(r) (9.32)
where I(r) is the intensity at a radial distance r, n(r) is the refractive index at r, n0 is the nomi￾nal refractive index, n2 is proportional to the third-order susceptibility, and thus requires very high
intensities.
Self-focusing can be avoided by ensuring that the laser power used is below the threshold power
level (qth) for self-focusing, which is given by:
qth = 𝜆2
2𝜋n0n2
(9.33)❦
❦ ❦
❦
NEW DEVELOPMENTS 323
By eliminating self-focusing, the beam energy can be delivered to a precise location.
Femtosecond lasers (typically 100 fs) are most suited for this process due to the ultrashort duration
and high intensity of the pulses. In the focal region, the material is first transformed into solid density
plasma (electron density of about 1023/cm3) with a skin depth of about 60 nm. The plasma absorbs
about 60% of the incident energy, resulting in a pressure of the order of 10 TPa. A shock wave is thus
initiated at the boundary of the region where the energy is deposited, with a corresponding rarefaction
wave propagating inward to create the void. As the shock wave propagates in the cold material, it
loses energy. It becomes converted into a sound wave when the energy inside the shock-affected
volume becomes equal to the absorbed energy. That defines the boundary of the shock-affected
volume. At that point, the pressure behind the shock wave then equals the internal pressure of the
cold material. The sound wave propagates into the rest of the material without causing any permanent
structural changes. Material in the unfocused region is unaffected by the beam. Example conditions
for silica would be a 30–100 nJ pulse energy at 0.8 μm wavelength, and 180 fs duration. With a single
laser pulse in a sapphire crystal, the void formed is surrounded by an amorphous sapphire shell of
diameter approximately twice that of the void. With longer pulse lasers (200 ps or 10 ns), voxels
produced tend to have irregular shapes and are larger in size. They also usually have cracks that
extend radially.
Formation of a void in a confined region is only possible if that is accompanied by compaction
of the surrounding material, since the material removed to create the void has no room to escape.
The intense pressure of the explosion then creates the denser surrounding material (shock-affected
region) which is more reactive chemically and thus etches differently from the surrounding material.
The explosion pressure is the result of a temperature rise at constant volume. For crystalline sapphire
and high purity silica, the radius, rs, of the shock-affected region may be approximated by:
rs = 3
√Qabs∕4
3 𝜋Em (9.34)
where Qabs is the energy absorbed and Em is Young’s modulus.
The equation is based on the micro-explosion process only and does not account for self-focusing
or void refill by back-relaxation of the shock-displaced material. Thus, the final voxel size may
deviate from what is predicted by the equation.
One potential application of a process involving micro-explosion is three-dimensional data stor￾age. The technique is also applicable to semiconductors provided the frequency of the laser is below
the bandgap.
9.3.1.4 Micromachining Applications Micromachining has application in several industries
including the automotive (diesel fuel injectors), biomedical (stent (Section 14.1.1)), aerospace
(aero engines), and electronic (circuit board hole drilling) industries, as well as surface texturing
(Section 11.6) for many other industries.
9.3.2 Laser-Assisted Machining
Laser-assisted machining is a means for increasing productivity in metal removal for traditionally
difficult-to-machine materials such as titanium alloys, nickel-based superalloys, hardened steels,
ceramics, and metal matrix composites. The metal removal rate and productivity achieved when
machining such materials by conventional methods are limited by the significant reduction in tool
life at high speeds.❦

The process involves using a laser beam to heat up a portion of a material directly in front of
a cutting tool to a temperature lower than its melting point, but high enough to soften the material
ahead of the cutting tool (Figure 9.27). Increasing the temperature of a material normally decreases
its flow stress and strain hardening rate. Ordinarily, it should be possible to reduce the flow stress
simply by machining at high speeds. This is feasible with materials such as aluminum alloys whose
flow stress decrease rapidly with increasing temperature. However, many of the difficult-to-machine
materials tend to retain their strength at elevated temperatures. Thus, high-speed machining of such
materials increases tool failure rate. In conventional machining, the chip is hottest at the underside
which is in contact with the cutting tool, while the opposite is true of laser-assisted machining, even
though in the latter case, the temperature of the underside of the chip may be the same as that obtained
in conventional machining.
Laser-assisted machining is essentially an improvement of the process of using a gas torch
or induction heating to facilitate the machining process. Gas torch and induction heating are not
commercially acceptable because of the resulting large HAZ and distortion of the machine and❦

workpiece. The high heat input also affects the cutting tool. Some of the benefits of laser-assisted
machining include
1. Reduction in cutting forces.
2. Improvement in tool life.
3. Improvement in surface finish.
Reduction in cutting forces increases the accuracy of cutting by decreasing the amount of work￾piece and machine distortion. It also minimizes the tendency for tool fracture in interrupted cuts,
especially when ceramic cutting tools are used. Looking at it from another viewpoint, by keeping
the cutting forces constant, higher feed rates can be used, enabling higher material removal rates to
be achieved. Improvement in surface finish of the workpiece improves its fatigue life as well as wear
and corrosion resistance.
To minimize the effect of the applied heat on the cutting tool, the depth of heat penetration into
the shear zone has to be limited to a region above the cutting tool. By so doing, the workpiece is
softened without overheating the cutting tool.
In laser-assisted turning of 316 and 420 stainless steels and the nickel superalloy, udimet 700,
using a pulsed laser beam of power 460 W, with a maximum average power density of 2.3 MW/cm2,
it has been found that the use of laser assist produces a smoother workpiece surface. Even though
the 420 stainless steel does not show a reduction in cutting forces, the improvement in surface finish
obtained is significant. For the 316 stainless steel and 1018, 1040 plain carbon steels, force reductions
in the range of 25–50% can be expected. For 1090 steel, much higher forces (about 2–3 times) are
obtained with the laser on than when it is off. This is most likely due to hardening of the workpiece by
the laser beam through phase transformation. An improvement in surface quality, though, is obtained.
It has been found that laser-assisted machining in general is not effective at very high machining
speeds, since the interaction time at an irradiated spot is too short for the metal to be heated at the
high speeds. At very low speeds, on the other hand, the material cools between the time that it is
irradiated and the time it arrives at the tool. Hardenable materials thus experience higher forces at
low speeds. For a previously hardened material, the cutting forces are always reduced. For either
type of material, the forces are reduced at intermediate speeds that result in the maximum amount
of tempering of the material arriving at the tool.
Conventional machining of titanium alloys is normally done at relatively low speeds and exclu￾sively with carbide cutting tools, due to the relative weakness of ceramics and the high reactivity of
titanium. Also, the low thermal conductivity of titanium alloys tends to concentrate any heat gen￾erated in the immediate vicinity of the tool, accelerating tool failure. In laser-assisted machining of
titanium alloys, it has been found that effective results are obtained with the beam spot oriented such
that its minor axis is along the direction of rotation (Figure 9.27b). The amount of time that any point
on the workpiece is impinged by the beam is then minimal, thereby reducing heat penetration below
the shear plane and into the cutting tool. This is especially true when carbide tools are used, since
they are less resistant to high temperatures than ceramic tools. Due to the low speeds, absorptive
coatings may not be necessary. At a laser power level of 12 kW, cutting speed of 0.7 m/s, feed rate
0.38–2.00 mm/rev, and depth of cut 2.5 mm, productivity is doubled by increasing the feed rate if the
cutting forces and tool wear are kept constant. The low conductivity of titanium alloys results in a
reduced heat penetration, thereby reducing the impact of the laser beam on tool wear. Since titanium
alloys are normally machined at low speeds, much greater improvements can be expected with the
application of laser-assisted machining.
In laser-assisted machining of inconel 718 using ceramic tools with a laser power of 12 kW,
cutting speed of 2.0 m/s, feed rate 0.15 mm/rev, and depth of cut 1.3 mm, it has been found that
impinging the beam at the top edge of the shoulder substantially reduces notch wear at the depth❦
❦ ❦

326 LASER CUTTING AND DRILLING
of cut line but has little influence on nose wear. Nose wear could be reduced by focusing the beam
near the root of the shoulder, but then that results in no improvement in the notch wear. In either
case, however, flank wear is reduced. The forces have been found to decrease almost linearly with
increasing laser power, with the rate being a little over 1% per kilowatt when no absorptive coatings
are used on the workpiece surface. With absorptive coatings, the reductions average nearly 4% per
kilowatt at power levels up to 4 kW. However, at power levels greater than 4 kW, the force curves
level out, indicating a progressive decrease in absorptivity. At a speed of 0.5 m/s and power 14 kW, a
33% reduction in force can be obtained without a coating, but the forces may be reduced by an addi￾tional 33% when a potassium silicate coating is used. Overall, it can be deduced that metal removal
rates could be increased by one third in laser-assisted machining, while at the same time reducing
both tool wear and cutting forces.
Coating techniques are discussed in greater detail in Section 11.1.2.3. For laser-assisted machin￾ing, the necessary criteria to be satisfied by successful coatings include
1. Good dispersion with fine particle size to avoid intermittent disruption of spray.
2. Localized application.
3. Rapid bonding to workpiece surface.
4. Good thermal stability under the beam, with minimal volatilization or steaming.
5. High absorptivity.
6. Lack of abrasiveness.
7. Inertness to workpiece and ease of removal.
Process Parameters:
The principal parameters that affect the process quality are the following:
1. Beam power and size (power density).
2. Distance between the beam and cutting tool. If the beam impinges on the workpiece very far
from the tool, the thermal front can penetrate through to the tool and aggravate, rather than
alleviate tool wear.
3. Cutting speed.
4. Depth of cut.
In turning operations, the beam may be positioned as shown in Figure 9.27a. To minimize the
penetration of heat below the shear plane, the distance between the beam and cutting tool has to
be as small as possible. However, the actual distance depends on processing parameters such as
the beam intensity, cutting speed, and depth of cut. The technique has also been applied to other
machining operations such as milling, drilling, and grinding.
9.4 SUMMARY
Laser cutting and drilling both involve using a focused laser beam to rapidly heat up a material to
the melting and/or vaporization temperature, and blowing away the molten material/vapor using an
assist gas. The main difference is that in laser cutting, the ejected material is blown away from the
laser optics, whereas in laser drilling, it is partly blown toward the optics.
The three principal forms of laser cutting are fusion cutting, sublimation cutting, and photochem￾ical ablation. A laser cutting system in its simplest form consists of the laser generator and beam
delivery system, a nozzle assembly for the assist gas, a motion unit, and an exhaust for the waste❦

material. The key parameters that influence the process are the beam power and characteristics,
traverse speed, assist gas, and relative location of the focal point. As an example, a 3 mm thick stain￾less steel plate can be cut with a CO2 laser using an output power of 1.8 kW at a speed of 2 m/min
and an 800 kPa nitrogen assist gas pressure. As the material thickness increases, the cutting speed
for a given power decreases. Common assist gases used are oxygen, air, inert gases, and nitrogen.
Oxygen and air result in an exothermic reaction that may increase the cutting speed, depending on
the material.
A Gaussian beam is generally preferred for cutting, since it results in the highest power density
at the focal point. Even though beams which are plane-polarized in a plane parallel to the cutting
direction result in higher cutting speeds than beams which are plane-polarized normal to the cutting
direction, circularly polarized beams are generally used since they result in better cut quality when
the cutting direction changes. It is also generally preferred to have the focal point either on the
workpiece surface or just below it.
An analysis of the process shows that as the cutting velocity increases, the thickness of molten
material at the cutting front increases, but on the other hand, increasing the gas jet velocity decreases
the melt thickness. The quality of cut that is obtained is often determined by striations and dross
that form on the cut surface. Thicker workpieces result in more irregular striations, culminating in a
rougher cut surface. Dross formation is enhanced by higher surface tension or viscosity of the molten
material. Thus, using oxygen assist tends to reduce dross formation, as opposed to when inert gas
assist is used.
Lasers can be used to produce holes in parts in three ways: percussion drilling, which involves
using a single laser pulse; multi-pulse percussion drilling, where a series of pulses are used; and
trepanning, which actually makes a circular cut to create the hole. The drilling process is influenced
primarily by the pulse energy, pulse duration, number of pulses, and beam quality. Holes as small
as 1 μm can be made, and depth-to-diameter ratios as high as 30 : 1 can be achieved. Common
defects that affect product quality are tapering of the hole walls, recast, and microcracking. Typical
applications of laser drilling include holes in jet engine turbine airfoils and injector nozzles.
As the pulse duration of the laser beam decreases, so does the extent to which heat is diffused into
the surrounding material, for the same input energy. Furthermore, the material is heated more rapidly
through the melting range. Thus, cleaner cuts are obtained with ultrashort-pulse lasers, compared to
traditional long-pulse lasers. The ablation threshold of ultrashort-pulse lasers is also deterministic,
enabling better control of the process.
Material removal can also occur by micro-explosion, a process that results from multiphoton
absorption when the beam intensity is very high as a result of tight focusing. This triggers shock
and rarefaction waves, creating voids within the material. It therefore provides a means for scribing
or creating internal geometrical structures in solid transparent dielectrics such as glasses, polymers,
and crystals.
Combining a laser with traditional machining processes can reduce cutting forces, while also
improving surface finish and tool wear.

10 Laser Welding
Welding is one means for joining parts. Others include mechanical fastening which uses physical
devices such as bolts and rivets to hold parts together, and adhesive bonding which uses nonmetal￾lic materials to hold parts together, for example, glueing. Welding, on the other hand, uses heat
and/or pressure to produce localized coalescence of material. It may also require filler metal, shield￾ing, or fluxing. Welding processes can be categorized into two broad areas, namely fusion welding
processes where a portion of the pieces to be joined actually melts and non-fusion welding pro￾cesses. Examples of the former include arc welding, resistance welding, gas, laser, and electron beam
welding processes, and for the latter, we have brazing, soldering, and solid-state welding processes.
Our discussion in this chapter focuses on laser welding.
The most common form of lasers used for welding are CO2, Nd:YAG, and fiber lasers. However,
continuous welds have traditionally been done with CO2 lasers, since higher-power continuous wave
(CW) beams are obtained with CO2 lasers. Recent developments in high-power CW Nd:YAG and
fiber lasers have increased their application in this area.
The discussion in this chapter starts with a general outline of laser welding parameters. This is
followed by a discussion on welding efficiency and then the mechanism of the laser welding pro￾cess. After that, the behavior of different materials, including some common metals and their alloys,
ceramic materials, as well as dissimilar materials, when welded, are presented. Common discontinu￾ities encountered during laser welding are then outlined, followed by advantages and disadvantages
of the process. Special laser welding techniques, such as multiple-beam welding, arc-augmented
laser welding, wobble welding, and remote laser welding (RLW), are then presented. This is followed
by a discussion on specific applications such as microwelding and laser-welded tailored blanks.
Finally, laser transmission welding and laser brazing are discussed.
10.1 LASER WELDING PARAMETERS
The setup for laser welding is similar to the one used for laser cutting (Figure 9.1). The primary
difference is that in laser welding, the exhaust system is positioned above the beam delivery unit
rather than the other side of the workpiece. The principal parameters that affect the laser welding
process include the following:
1. Beam power and traverse speed.
2. Beam characteristics (mode, stability, polarization, and form – pulsed or CW).
3. Shielding gas.
4. Location of focal point relative to the workpiece surface.
5. Joint configuration.

As an illustration of conditions that might be used in industry, Table 10.1 gives sample conditions
for CO2 and fiber laser welding of a variety of materials, while Table 10.2 provides additional details
for a specific material. We now discuss each of the parameters listed earlier in further detail in the
following sections.
10.1.1 Beam Power and Traverse Speed
Figure 10.1 shows the effect of welding speed and laser power on weld penetration. The depth
of penetration decreases almost exponentially with increasing traverse speed for a given power.
Conversely, the depth-to-width ratio increases with increasing traverse speed, though not as dra￾matically (Figure 10.2), and then levels off. For a given speed, the penetration depth increases with
increasing power input. Generally, results obtained from low-power laser welding, say less than
5 kW, cannot be extrapolated to high-power welding, say 20 kW. This is due to differences caused
by plasma shielding effects resulting from either high power densities or high evaporation rates that
cause an enhanced plasma formation.
10.1.2 Effect of Beam Characteristics
The principal beam characteristics that affect the laser welding process include the beam mode,
stability, polarization, and form (pulsed or CW). The effect that these parameters have on the welding
process are discussed in that order in the following subsections.
10.1.2.1 Beam Mode The beam mode (Section 8.1.3) has a significant impact on the weld bead
shape. A TEM00 mode results in a greater depth-to-width ratio than higher-order modes. This is due
primarily to the more concentrated shape of the TEM00 mode, which results in a smaller focused❦

beam radius. The larger spot size of multimode beams, however, makes them more suited for butt
welding applications, since it reduces the tight fit-up requirements.
10.1.2.2 Beam Stability Repeatability or consistency of the weld quality is influenced by beam
stability. Temporal variations of the beam characteristics such as the output power and mode struc￾ture, as well as variations in the absorption coefficient with temperature, do cause variations in the
welding process, and thus the resulting weld quality.
10.1.2.3 Beam Polarization The basic concepts of beam polarization are discussed in Section 3.4.
The influence of beam polarization on the welding process depends on both the material and welding❦

conditions. In welding some steels, the depth of penetration is found to vary depending on the direc￾tion of beam polarization, being enhanced when the direction of polarization is aligned with the
welding direction. This effect is only evident above a critical welding speed, below which the polar￾ization direction has no impact on the penetration (Figure 10.3).
This is different from the case of laser cutting where the process efficiency is found to be strongly
influenced by the beam polarization. This difference in behavior is most likely the result of a loss
in correlation between any polarization of the beam and the electromagnetic field in the keyhole
due to the processes of scattering, reradiation, and reflection from the walls during keyhole welding
(Section 10.3.2).
10.1.2.4 Pulsed Beams Both pulsed and CW laser beams (Section 8.1.4) can be used for weld￾ing, with pulsed beams being more suited for spot welding, while CW beams are more suited for
continuous welds. Pulsed beams can also be used for continuous welds if the pulses are made to
overlap. Additional process parameters that need to be considered when welding with pulsed beams
are the pulse duration, shape, and pulse frequency (repetition rate).❦
❦ ❦
❦
LASER WELDING PARAMETERS 339
In using a pulsed beam for keyhole welding, the pulses ought to have a high enough energy to
exert a significant thrust on the molten metal to maintain a keyhole once it is formed and will have
to be spaced closely enough to prevent freezing of the metal while the beam is off.
When large amounts of energy are supplied in short periods to a workpiece, they tend to con￾centrate near the surface as heat, since it takes time for the heat to be conducted into the bulk of
the material. This results in high-temperature gradients in the immediate vicinity of the heat source,
producing high cooling rates once the beam is switched off.
10.1.3 Plasma Formation, Gas Shielding, and Effect of Ambient Pressure
10.1.3.1 Plasma Formation With high-power beams, a portion of the laser energy is expended
in ionizing part of the shielding gas and/or vapor cloud that forms above the workpiece, to form a
plasma (Figure 10.4). This plasma may absorb part of the laser beam energy and reradiate it in all
directions or scatter it, thereby reducing the amount of energy reaching the molten pool. The plasma
cloud may also induce an optical lensing effect that changes the effective focusing of the laser beam.
This laser-induced plasma normally develops in the intensity range of 106 W/cm2 while welding
steel with CO2 lasers.
Even though initial absorption of a CO2 laser beam on a metallic surface is normally less than
10%, the absorption can be as high as 100% once a plasma is formed. Such absorption can either
occur above the workpiece or inside the keyhole. When it occurs above the workpiece as described
earlier, it reduces the efficiency of the welding process as a significant portion of the beam power
is then lost. On the other hand, absorption inside the keyhole may enhance the process efficiency.
Plasma formation is of less significance while welding with an Nd:YAG laser. This is because the
Nd:YAG laser beam is more efficiently absorbed at metallic surfaces, while less is absorbed by the
plasma.
The formation of the plasma has advantages and disadvantages. In the initial stages of the process,
the formation of a shielding gas plasma reduces the amount of the laser energy that is reflected
away as it absorbs a significant portion of the energy. Since the plasma formed is then relatively
small and in close contact with the workpiece, it can enhance absorption of the beam energy by the
workpiece. This, it does by first absorbing the beam energy and then transferring it to the workpiece.
This is referred to as plasma-enhanced energy coupling and is most effective at the threshold or

initial stages of plasma formation. However, as the beam intensity increases and the plasma builds
up, if the plasma stays on top of the workpiece, then the energy it absorbs is not fully coupled to the
workpiece. That reduces the amount of energy that reaches or is absorbed by the work, and thus, the
process efficiency.
Variations in the plasma density can thus cause variations in beam absorption by the workpiece,
and as a consequence, variations in weld quality. Plasma fluctuations that occur during laser welding
are more severe at low beam intensity and high speed, especially in the initial stages of plasma
formation. At higher beam intensity and lower speed, the plasma is more continuous with fewer
fluctuations. This is especially the case when absorption occurs inside the keyhole.
10.1.3.2 Gas Shielding In laser welding, a shielding gas may be used for one or more purposes:
1. To blow away the vapor and plasma formed, enabling the beam to reach its target.
2. To provide a protective environment for the weld pool.
3. To protect the focusing lens.
The most common gases used for laser welding are argon and helium. Argon is more commonly
used for low- to medium-power laser welding since it is cheaper than helium, and its higher density
results in better shielding. The argon-shielded weld surface is also smoother than that obtained with
helium shielding. Since the density of helium is lower, higher flow rates are required for effective
shielding. However, for high-power or low-speed applications, helium is preferable since it has a
higher ionization potential. Thus, the threshold energy necessary to form a plasma when helium is
used for shielding is relatively high. This reduces the amount of plasma formed and keeps the gas
transparent to the laser beam, allowing the energy to reach the workpiece.
On the other hand, without the plasma, there will be no initial plasma energy coupling. This might
make keyhole formation difficult, thus preventing deep penetration welding. This effect occurs, for
example, in aluminum welding with a 2.5 kW laser at a speed of about 3 m/min. Under these con￾ditions, a deep penetration weld can be obtained using nitrogen as a shielding gas, while very little
molten metal is formed when helium shielding gas is used.
When argon is used in the higher-power applications, its ionization results in a significant por￾tion of the beam being absorbed. Thus, less power reaches the weld, thereby reducing penetration.
Generally, for a given set of conditions, penetration is found to be greater for helium shielding, fol￾lowed by nitrogen and then argon. Nitrogen is not as extensively used as argon and helium, since it
could form nitrides that might embrittle the weldment.
The weld quality thus depends on the type of shielding gas used. The effect is more significant
at low welding speeds and at higher power densities, since the local vapor density above the work￾piece is then much higher. As is evident from Figure 10.5, at low power levels, there is no difference
between the impact of argon, helium, or nitrogen. However, at higher power levels, a distinct differ￾ence exists between the depths of penetration obtained using the various gases. As mentioned earlier,
because of the high ionization potential of helium, it does not form a plasma easily. It is thus trans￾parent (does not absorb the beam energy) to the incident laser beam over a wide range of conditions,
especially at the lower welding speeds or high-power densities. By comparison, other gases tend to
form a plasma that absorbs the incident beam energy, under these conditions.
Another use of the shielding gas is protection of the focusing lens. For low-power applications,
say up to 1500 W, the normal flow of shielding gas (about 10 L/min) for protecting the weld is also
adequate to protect the lens, as long as the gas stream is coaxial with the laser beam. A typical nozzle
diameter would be 3 mm. However, at higher powers, separate shielding or helium cross-flow that
is provided by a plasma suppression device (Figure 10.6) is often applied. The plasma suppression❦

unit directs a high velocity jet of inert gas, usually helium, at the top of the weld to suppress or blow
away the plasma. Plasma suppression serves to protect the lens and also to enable the heat supplied
to reach the weld.
The final form of the weld bead is affected by the mode of application of the shielding gas.
For example, when welding steel with a 10 kW laser while using an axial gas nozzle of diameter
2 mm, no keyhole is produced at low helium flow rates of say, less than 5 L/min, since most of
the beam energy is then absorbed by the plasma. A small molten zone may result from conduction
mode welding. With increasing gas flow rates, a point is reached when a transition occurs to keyhole
formation, with a resulting deep penetration. Further increases in gas flow rate then produces a linear
but slight increase in penetration. Beyond about 40 L/min, the gas flow may be vigorous enough to
eject the molten metal out of the weld pool, resulting in an irregular and perhaps shallow bead shape.
The general effect of suppressant gas flow rate on penetration is shown in Figure 10.7.❦

10.1.3.3 Effect of Ambient Pressure The amount or intensity of plasma generated decreases as
the ambient welding pressure is reduced. Below a pressure of about 5 Torr (depending on the weld￾ing conditions), the plasma is so small in size that no significant change is observed with further
reductions in the pressure. The pool width decreases, while the penetration increases with decreas￾ing pressure. Laser welding in vacuum may increase the penetration about 30–50% more than that
obtained when welding in the atmosphere. However, laser vacuum welding is not a common prac￾tice due to the cost and other difficulties associated with setting up the vacuum welding system,
especially for large workpieces.
10.1.4 Beam Size and Focal Point Location
For a given optical system (focusing lens), the location of the focal point relative to the workpiece
surface determines the beam size on the workpiece surface, and this affects the bead width and depth
of penetration (Figure 10.8). Optimum location of the focus results in maximum depth-to-width ratio,
that is, the maximum penetration depth and minimum bead width occur for almost the same focal
position.
10.1.5 Joint Configuration
There are various types of joint configuration that can be used in welding. However, due to the small
beam size, lasers are primarily used for lap or square butt joints (Figure 10.9). The rule of thumb is
that the butt gap has to be less than 10% of the thinner plate’s thickness (Figure 10.10). Otherwise,
there is the likelihood that most or the entire beam will pass directly through the gap, resulting in
inadequate weld or no weld at all.
To minimize the problem associated with the small beam size, the beam may be defocused at the
joint to produce a relatively wide bead. However, the defocused beam is more sensitive to absorp￾tion by the material surface, since the power density is then low, and any small amount of power
that is reflected is relatively significant. This may result in fluctuations in the energy absorbed by❦

the workpiece. The use of Nd:YAG lasers for metals minimizes this fluctuation, since the 1.06 μm
wavelength is more efficiently absorbed by metals. Fluctuation in the energy absorbed may also be
minimized by superimposing a pulsed beam over the CW welding beam. This is referred to as the
rippled mode laser output or hyperpulse (Section 8.1.4). The pulse rapidly melts the material surface,
thereby increasing its absorption coefficient to a high enough value that the CW beam is efficiently
and uniformly absorbed.❦

Figure 10.10 (a) Butt joint and (b) lap joint specifications in laser welding.
The joint fitting requirements for lap joints are not as critical as for butt joints since in the lap joint,
the laser beam is made to penetrate through one piece into the underlying component (Figure 10.10).
Lap joints are more appropriately used when the upper component is relatively thin (typically less
than 1 mm in thickness). When the laser beam penetrates the top layer to join the two pieces at the
interface as shown in Figure 10.10b, the process is then sometimes referred to as direct laser welding.
Thus far, a significant number of laser welds that are made are autogenous, involving no filler
metal. However, filler metal may be used where necessary, especially for non-square butt joints, or
when the butt gap is relatively large.
10.2 WELDING EFFICIENCY
Processing efficiency is discussed in general terms in Section 8.2. For laser welding, the overall
efficiency, 𝜂, may be expressed as:
𝜂 = power used in melting solid
power input to the laser generator (10.1)
Comparison of overall efficiency for arc, laser, and electron beam welding is made in Table 10.3.
10.3 MECHANISM OF LASER WELDING
When a laser beam is incident on a metallic surface, a sequence of events take place. A significant
portion of the beam may initially be reflected away. The small percentage that is absorbed heats up
the surface, raising its temperature. With increasing temperature, the surface absorptivity increases

(Section 8.1.6), which further increases the temperature. This may eventually result in localized
melting and possible evaporation of the metal. Such vaporization, if it occurs, creates a vapor cavity
in the metal. Laser welding may thus be one of two forms:
1. Conduction mode (also known as conduction-limited).
2. Keyhole (or deep penetration) welding.
Conduction mode welding is normally used for welding of foils and thin sheets, while keyhole
mode welding is used for relatively thick sections.
10.3.1 Conduction Mode Welding
Conduction mode welding usually occurs at power densities lower than 106 W/cm2, with vapor￾ization of the workpiece being minimal. The laser power is first deposited on the surface and then
transferred by conduction to the surroundings. The penetration is thus essentially controlled by con￾duction from the initial point of contact, that is, the surface of the workpiece, causing a small surface
area to be heated above the melting point. Convection also plays a role once a weld pool is formed.
The resulting weld is shallower with a wider heat-affected zone compared to that produced by key￾hole welding. It is more common with low-power lasers, say below 1 kW. A typical configuration
is shown in Figure 10.11. The shape of the weld pool in conduction mode welding is influenced by
flow in the weld pool and by the presence of surface-active elements (Section 4.3.3).
Approximate analysis of heat flow in conduction mode welding can be done using the point heat
source analysis discussed in Section 4.2, while material in Section 4.3 will enable flow in the molten
pool to be analyzed.
10.3.2 Keyhole Welding
At very high-power densities, say above 106 W/cm2, part of the work material is vaporized to form
a cavity, the keyhole, which is surrounded by molten metal, which in turn is surrounded by the
solid material (Figure 10.12). The molten material around the keyhole fills the cavity as the beam
is traversed along the joint. The cavity contains vapor, plasma, or both. Forces at play that tend to
collapse the keyhole cavity are as follows:
1. Surface tension at the interface between the molten metal and vapor or plasma.
2. Hydrostatic pressure of the molten metal.
3. Hydrodynamic pressure of the molten metal.

These forces, however, are balanced by:
1. Vapor pressure that exists within the cavity which is greater than atmospheric pressure by
about 10% and which pushes the molten metal toward the periphery.
2. Ablation pressure of material as it vaporizes from the inner surface of the keyhole.
Ablation is the sudden removal of material by melting and/or vaporization. The balancing pressure
is maintained during the welding process, thus sustaining the keyhole.
Laser energy that enters the keyhole is trapped and carried deeper into the material, resulting
in very high absorption, greater than 90% once it is established. The keyhole mode thus enables
very narrow and deep penetration welds to be made. This feature makes it attractive for machined
components and aerospace engine components, since distortion is then minimal.❦

MECHANISM OF LASER WELDING 347
If the laser beam is stationary, the continuous vaporization of material would cause the cavity to
grow. Under such circumstances, a steady state cannot be achieved, and the keyhole would eventu￾ally collapse. On the other hand, steady-state conditions can be achieved with a moving beam. The
cavity moves along with the beam, at a rate determined by the beam. Since an adequate amount of
vapor pressure needs to be maintained to prevent collapse of the cavity, a minimum traverse speed
is necessary for steady-state conditions. As the cavity moves, material continuously moves from the
front to the back of the cavity. This may occur either by flow of molten material around the cavity,
or as vapor through the cavity or keyhole, with the bulk of the transport being through the molten
material. The driving force for flow through the molten material is the ablation or recoil pressure of
the evaporating material, or the surface tension due to temperature variation along the keyhole walls.
The effect of surface tension as a driving force of flow is relatively small compared to the flow due to
recoil pressure, since the interface temperature is close to the equilibrium evaporation temperature.
The pressure in the melt at the vapor–liquid interface is a maximum directly in front of the laser
beam, in the direction of welding, and reduces to a minimum on the side of the keyhole.
Under steady-state conditions, motion of the laser beam results in motion of the cavity and sur￾rounding molten metal, along with all isotherms, at the same rate. The width of the molten region
determines the width of the weld seam.
The simplest approximation to the keyhole configuration is that of a vertical cylinder
(Figure 10.12a). However, since the vapor pressure generally varies with depth, the radius is also a
function of depth. The variation of pressure with depth results in outward flow of vapor, causing
vapor to emerge from the end of the keyhole as an axial jet. Generally, the axis of the keyhole is
bent in the direction of workpiece travel (Figure 10.12b).
One typical shape of the keyhole is shown in Figure 10.13 and has a constriction near the cavity
outlet. Other shapes can also develop, depending on the welding conditions. Some are relatively
short with walls that are convex outward and rounded at the bottom, while others are long and thin,
concave outward, and have sharp points at the bottom when blind. The shape shown in Figure 10.13
tends to occur at relatively high welding speeds and larger penetration depths (or beam powers).

Due to the motion of the heat source, the top surface of the molten metal develops a teardrop
shape (Figure 10.14), with a typical length-to-width ratio of about 10, and the width tails off toward
the back. At low welding speeds, the molten pool is almost circular in cross section, but the teardrop
shape becomes more pronounced as the speed increases (see also Figure 4.6). The width of the
molten pool decreases at higher welding speeds, forcing the molten metal to move at a higher velocity
through the narrow channel between the vapor and the solid boundary.
When the power level is low enough, the vapor pressure produced in the keyhole is much smaller
than the fluid dynamic forces of the molten metal surrounding the keyhole. The keyhole thus col￾lapses, and a sudden drop in penetration occurs, with the weld pool becoming roughly hemispherical
in shape, resulting in conduction mode welding. Conduction mode welding is less efficient than key￾hole welding, since the absence of a keyhole results in a much lower energy transfer efficiency of
about 20%, as a significant portion of the incident beam is reflected away. Conduction mode weld￾ing typically results in a depth-to-width ratio of about 3 to 1 compared to about 100 to 1 for keyhole
welding.
The overall transverse cross-sectional shape of the weld bead produced in keyhole welding often
consists of two main sections. The lower part is nearly parallel-sided, with a gradual narrowing from
top to bottom. On top of that is a region of roughly semi-circular shape, whose width is greater than
that of the parallel-sided section.
10.3.2.1 Power Absorption in the Keyhole Absorption of beam energy in the keyhole occurs by
two principal mechanisms:
1. Inverse bremsstrahlung of the plasma.
2. Fresnel absorption (direct deposition) at the cavity walls.
Both forms of absorption normally occur simultaneously within the keyhole and are illustrated
in Figure 10.15. The absorbed beam becomes entrapped in the keyhole. This results in significantly
higher absorption in deep penetration welding compared to conduction mode welding.
Inverse Bremsstrahlung Absorption With inverse bremsstrahlung absorption, a portion of the
vaporized metal or shielding gas is ionized by the high incident energy to form a plasma which
may absorb part of the incident beam by the inverse bremsstrahlung effect inside the keyhole.
Bremsstrahlung is the electromagnetic radiation produced by the sudden retardation of a charged
particle in an intense electric field. Thus in simple terms, inverse bremsstrahlung is the absorption of
electromagnetic radiation as a result of the sudden acceleration of a charged particle, or absorption❦

of a photon by an electron in the field of a nucleus. The absorption thus depends on the presence of
free electrons and occurs within the plasma, which consists of ionized particles (Figure 10.15a). The
absorption depends on temperature, partly because the electron density varies with temperature. As
the vapor is heated in the presence of an intense beam, the absorption coefficient increases. Since
the center of the keyhole is much hotter than the walls (which are at the vaporization temperature),
most of the beam energy is absorbed within the cavity and then coupled to the keyhole wall through
conduction and radiation.
Fresnel Absorption The mechanism of Fresnel absorption results in the beam being spread along
the entire keyhole length. It results from multiple reflections at the keyhole walls (Figure 10.15b),
where the beam energy that enters the vapor cavity is reflected repetitively at the walls of the keyhole
until all the energy is eventually absorbed. For most applications, specular reflection (mirror-like)
is assumed to be predominant, with diffuse reflection (similar to reflection from a rough surface)
being neglected. Such multiple reflections, along with scattering processes, tend to randomize phase
relations that may have existed in the original beam.
10.3.2.2 Keyhole Characteristics Analysis of the keyhole is quite complex and is still the subject
of research. The approach we shall adopt is to first present the governing equations that are needed
for an in-depth analysis. We shall then follow it with a simplified analysis which will provide an
approximate insight into the keyhole characteristics.
Governing Equations In this section, we outline the governing equations necessary for analyzing
the keyhole welding process, focusing on flow in the molten material. The rarefied medium in the
keyhole is considered in so far as it affects the boundary conditions.
The velocity and temperature fields in the molten material, assuming incompressible flow, are
given by the following governing equations:

where ⋅ Fb = −𝜌lg𝛽T(T − T0) is the body force vector, incorporating the buoyancy forces, with com￾ponents Fx, Fy, and Fz. The negative sign results from the fact that the buoyancy force is opposite in
direction to g (N/m3), g is the gravitational acceleration vector (m/s2), ul is the velocity vector for
the liquid phase (m/s), 𝛽T is the volumetric thermal coefficient of expansion (/K), and s, l, and v are
the subscripts for the solid, liquid, and vapor phases, respectively. For the solid substrate, only the
energy equation is required.
Boundary Conditions
At the solid–liquid interface, no-slip conditions are used, that is,
u = 0
At the liquid–vapor interface, the boundary conditions for the momentum Eq. (10.3) are obtained
by conserving momentum in the normal and tangential directions as follows:
Normal component:
mln ⋅ (ul − uiv) + mvn ⋅ (uv − uiv) − n ⋅ [n ⋅ (𝜏l − 𝜏v)] + n ⋅ ∇lv𝛾lv − (∇lv ⋅ n)𝛾lvn ⋅ n = 0 (10.5)
Tangential component:
t ⋅ ∇lv𝛾lv − t ⋅ [n ⋅ (𝜏l − 𝜏v)] = 0 (10.6)
Energy balance at the solid–liquid interface gives the following boundary condition for the energy
Eq. (10.4):
ksn ⋅ ∇Ts − kln ⋅ ∇Tl = 𝜌sLmn ⋅ uil (10.7)
while energy balance at the liquid–vapor interface gives the following boundary condition:
kln ⋅ ∇Tl − kvn ⋅ ∇Tv + (1 − R)I0 ⋅ n = 𝜌lLvn ⋅ (uil − uiv) (10.8)
where I0 is the intensity of the incident laser beam (W/cm2), ml and mv are the mass flux of liquid and
vapor, respectively (kg), n and t are unit normal and tangential vectors, respectively, R is the reflec￾tivity (−), uv and uiv are the velocities of the vapor at the liquid–vapor interface and the free surface
(vaporization interface), respectively (m/s), uil is the velocity of the solid–liquid interface (melting
interface) (m/s), 𝛾lv is the surface tension at the liquid–vapor interface (J/m2 or N/m), 𝜏 is the stress
tensor at the liquid–vapor interface (Pa), and ∇lv is the surface gradient at the liquid–vapor interface.
The resulting Eqs. (10.2)–(10.8) are highly nonlinear, time-dependent, and coupled and can
only be solved numerically. Further simplifications may still be necessary. Thus, in the following
section, we present an approximate analysis which provides a simplified insight into the keyhole
characteristics.
Approximate Analysis An estimate of heat flow in keyhole welding can be done using the line heat
source analysis discussed in Section 4.2 to obtain the approximate temperature distribution, cooling
rates, and peak temperatures, without taking into account the fluid flow (liquid, vapor, and plasma).❦

MECHANISM OF LASER WELDING 351
The discussions in Section 4.3 and the preceding section provide a basis for analyzing the molten
pool that surrounds the keyhole but do not address the gaseous plume (vapor/plasma) within the
keyhole.
We add to these analyses by first looking at flow conditions in a plane parallel to the workpiece
surface (Figure 10.14) and make the following assumptions:
1. All variations in the z-direction (normal to the workpiece surface) over a range comparable to
the keyhole radius, rk, are small. This assumption may not be particularly valid close to the
surface.
2. Welding speeds are high enough that adiabatic heating conditions exist ahead of the weld pool.
In other words, heat conducted outward in the forward direction is not lost, but available to
subsequently melt the material, unless it is conducted sideways, out of the path of the molten
metal, faster than the advance speed. Using the nomenclature in Figure 10.14, the average
speed at which heat is conducted sideways, ucs, may be approximated as:
ucs = 𝜅s
rk + 𝑤l
(10.9)
where rk is the keyhole radius (μm), wl is the average sideways width of the molten pool (μm), and
𝜅s is the thermal diffusivity of the solid (mm2/s).
Now if the welding speed, ux, is greater than 𝜅s
rk
, only a small fraction of the heat conducted out
ahead of the molten pool will be lost. Thus, ux > 𝜅s
rk
defines the “adiabatic” heating condition in laser
welding.
Weld Pool Length Ahead of the Keyhole, lf The length of the molten material between the keyhole
and unmelted solid in front of it can be obtained by a simple heat balance that gives
(cvolTm + Lmv)ux = kl
Tv − Tm
lf
(
1 − uxlf
𝜅l

(10.10)
where cvol = 𝜌cp is the specific heat per unit volume, assumed equal for both the solid and liquid
phases (J/kg K m3), lf is the weld pool length ahead of the keyhole (mm), Lmv is the latent heat of melt￾ing per unit volume (J/m3), Tm and Tv are the melting and vaporization temperatures, respectively
(K), and 𝜅l is the thermal diffusivity of the liquid (molten pool) (mm2/s).
The factor (
1 − uxlf
𝜅l
)
corrects for the motion of the boundaries relative to the medium. Eq. (10.10)
is based on the concept that the heat conducted through the molten metal provides enough thermal
energy to advance the melt front at a speed ux. Since kl = cvol𝜅l, Eq. (10.10) reduces to the form:
lf = 𝜅l
ux
( Tv − Tm
Tv + Lmv∕cvol )
(10.11)
from which we find that the length of the molten material between the keyhole and unmelted solid
is inversely proportional to the welding speed.
Average Side Width of the Molten Pool, wl If we divide the material around the cavity into four
quadrants (Figure 10.14) and consider the first two quadrants, then in each of those two quadrants,
sufficient heat must be conducted into the molten region to melt cold material at such a rate that
the melt boundary in the quadrant moves with a speed ux. The average width of this melt is wl, and
the average temperature is Tv+Tm

Flow of Material Around the Cavity As indicated earlier in Section 10.3.2, material is transported
from the front to the back side of the cavity by flow of liquid around the cavity and/or flow of
vapor across the cavity. Assuming that flow occurs in the horizontal plane, then when we consider
continuity of mass, we get
𝜌vuvt = 𝛽v𝜌lux (10.14)
where uvt is the average velocity of vapor flow transversely across the cavity (m/s), 𝛽v is the fraction
of material transported across the cavity as vapor (−), 𝜌l is the density of both liquid and solid,
assumed equal (kg/m3), and 𝜌v is the vapor density at temperature Tv (kg/m3).
The ratio of the solid or liquid density to the vapor density is typically of the order of 104. The
excess pressure that results from flow of vaporized material from the front of the cavity is due to
momentum transport per unit area and unit time, which can be expressed as:
P = (𝛽v𝜌lux)uvt (10.15)
where the expression in brackets is the mass of the material removed per unit area per unit time. It
is this pressure that pushes the molten metal around the keyhole cavity. The resulting velocity ul of
the molten metal can be obtained using Bernoulli’s Eq. (9.1a) and is given by:
P = 1

From Eqs. (10.14) to (10.16), we get
ul = 𝛽vux

(10.17)
Now the volume of liquid (per unit time and unit cavity depth) that flows around the cavity is
2ullf, while the volume of material swept out by the cavity is 2rkux. Thus,
2ullf = (1 − 𝛽v) ⋅ 2rkux (10.18)
which gives
𝛽v = 1

rk

which is the fraction of material transported across the cavity as vapor. 𝛽v typically ranges in value
between 0.01 and 0.1. From the preceding analysis, it can be shown that 𝛽v ∝ux, uvt ∝ u2
x , and P ∝ u4
x .
The analysis breaks down at high enough welding speeds ux, as uvt then approaches the speed of
sound. At that point, the pressure P becomes comparable to the ambient pressure, and 𝛽v approaches
0.5. The assumption of a pressure which is uniform over the horizontal plane is then no longer valid.
Also, horizontal and vertical flow can then no longer be treated as independent.❦

MECHANISM OF LASER WELDING 353
Molten Material Behind the Cavity In estimating the dimensions of the molten pool behind the
cavity, we consider the balance of energy in this region, which consists of the following components:
1. Latent heat of melting required to expand the molten material from a lateral distance of rk +wl
to D, the maximum width of the molten pool.
2. Heat liberated by condensation of the vapor transported across the cavity.
3. Heat released as the molten metal cools from a temperature of Tv behind the cavity to Tm at
the edge of the molten pool.
The resulting heat balance, neglecting heat conduction from the cavity into the molten region, as
well as that conducted from the liquid into the solid, which are assumed to approximately cancel
out, gives
rk[𝛽vLvol + cvol(Tv − Tm)] = Lmv(D − rk − 𝑤l) (10.20)
where D is the maximum width of the molten zone (mm) and Lvol is the latent heat of vaporization
(or condensation), per unit volume of liquid (J/m3).
The length of the molten pool can be approximated by considering the distance l that the beam
advances during the time tD that it takes for the melt to attain the width D, that is, the time it takes for
heat to be conducted from the rear of the cavity over a distance D. l (Figure 10.14) is then given by:

Pressure Variation in the Keyhole For the purposes of this discussion, pressure within the keyhole
is considered to vary only along the length of the keyhole, that is, in the vertical direction, and is
uniform in a horizontal section. As indicated earlier, the cavity is kept open by an excess pressure
of vapor in the keyhole, Pv (the plasma plume), and ablation pressure, Pab. The forces that tend to
close it are due to surface tension, P𝛾 , hydrostatic pressure, Phs, of the surrounding molten metal,
and hydrodynamic pressure, Phd. Force balance thus gives
Pv + Pab = Pγ + Phs + Phd (10.23a)
Assuming that the principal curvature is in the horizontal plane, that is, d2rk
dz2 is negligible compared
to 1/rk, and neglecting hydrodynamic pressure, the gage pressure (right-hand side of Eq. (10.23a)),
P(z), at depth z below the liquid surface is given by:
P(z) = 𝛾lv
rk(z)
+ 𝜌lgz (10.23b)
where rk(z) is the keyhole radius at levelz(μm), 𝛾lv is the surface tension at the liquid–vapor interface
(N/m), and 𝜌l is the density of the molten metal (kg/m3). This pressure in the liquid is balanced by
the plume and ablation pressures.

6 m/min. Assume that the density of molten aluminum is 𝜌l = 2400 kg/m3, and that adiabatic heating❦

MATERIAL CONSIDERATIONS 355
10.4 MATERIAL CONSIDERATIONS
The suitability of CO2 laser welding to various materials is summarized in Table 10.4.
In the following sections, we shall consider the behavior of three groups of materials when
laser-welded:
(1) Steels.
(2) Nonferrous metals.
(3) Ceramic materials.
In addition, we shall also discuss welding of dissimilar materials.
10.4.1 Steels
Plain carbon steels with low carbon content are generally easily welded using a laser beam. How￾ever, steels with carbon content greater than 0.25% may require preheating to prevent the formation
of brittle microstructures due to the high cooling rates that normally occur during laser welding
(Section 5.1.3.3). On the other hand, the high cooling rates can be beneficial in steels that depend on
the addition of alloying elements to produce fine-particle strengthening, such as the high-strength
low-alloy (HSLA) steels. This is in contrast to conventional arc welding of HSLA steels which gen￾erally result in strength reduction due to the greater total heat input and consequent slower cooling
rates. The presence of sulfur and phosphorus as alloying elements tend to promote hot cracking
as usual (Section 5.2.2.1). Some stainless steels (Section 5.1.3.3) normally result in good welds,
especially most austenitic (300 series) types, except for those containing sulfur. Because of their rel￾atively low thermal conductivities, higher depth-to-width ratios are obtained in stainless steel welds
compared to carbon steels.
Galvinized steel is extensively used in the automotive, agricultural, and construction industries for
protection against corrosion. However, lap welding of this material poses a significant challenge due
to the low vaporization temperature of the zinc coating. When two sheets are overlapped and clamped
together without any gap between them, the vapor pressure that results from zinc vaporization tends
to blow out molten metal, causing spatter. The vapor also causes porosity. A common approach to
overcoming this problem is to create a gap (about 0.1–0.5 mm) between the sheets by dimpling or
with the use of spacers, providing an escape path for the vapor. However, this is difficult to do for
complex parts, such as automotive doors.
A recent development that is supposed to overcome this problem involves the use of a fiber laser
coupled to a device that enables the beam to be distributed between two regions, an outer ring that

between the two regions can be varied.
10.4.2 Nonferrous Alloys
Aluminum and copper require relatively high power densities to sustain a molten puddle due to their
high thermal conductivity and reflectivity. In the case of aluminum, these properties, coupled with
the low melting temperature and low ionization energy, narrow the range of process parameters that
can be used for welding, compared to steel. Filler material is often necessary for welding aluminum
alloys. Series 1000 and 3000 are among the easiest to weld.
Of the 2000 series, 2219 exhibits the greatest resistance to cracking because of high Cu content
(6.3%). 2014 and 2024 have lower Cu (4.5%) and contain a small amount of magnesium, which
increases crack sensitivity by extending the solidification range.
The 5000 series aluminum alloys with magnesium as the principal alloying element (for strength￾ening) tend to crack in the weld bead when welded. This is primarily due to the long solidification
range which induces hot cracking (Section 5.2.2.1). The cracking problem is especially serious when
the magnesium content in the weld metal is reduced to less than 3%. Silicon reduces the solidi￾fication range, thereby reducing hot cracking. Silicon is more effective when its concentration is
greater than 4%. In welding the 5000 series alloys, silicon can be introduced by using an Al–Si
filler material. There is also a significant loss of magnesium from the weld bead during welding of
the 5000 series. This tends to reduce the mechanical properties and occurs by vaporization, since
the boiling temperature of magnesium is less than half that of aluminum. Another potential prob￾lem with the 5000 series is the formation of porosity. The pores are generally spherical in nature,
indicating that they are formed by gas entrapment rather than shrinkage. Since hydrogen is the pri￾mary source of such porosity, ensuring that the shielding gas is of high purity and further ensuring
proper cleaning of the base metal to reduce surface contaminants and the oxide layer will tend to
minimize porosity formation. The 5083 and 5456 alloys are the strongest and easiest to weld in
this group.
The 4000 series with silicon as the principal alloying element are less sensitive to cracks than the
5000 series. This is mainly because the range of composition over which the alloy is crack-sensitive
is narrower for the Al–Si alloys than for the Al–Mg alloys (Figure 10.17). Al–Mg–Si alloys that
contain about 1% Mg2Si are highly crack-sensitive, since the Mg2Si content is close to the peak
of the hot cracking curve (Figure 10.17). Examples are 6061 and 6063. The crack sensitivity in
these alloys can be reduced by the addition of excess magnesium or silicon using Al–Mg or Al–Si
filler materials, respectively. Of the 7000 series aluminum alloys, there are two main groups: (i) the
Al–Zn–Mg types (for example, X7005, X7106, and 7039), which are more resistant to weld cracking,❦

and (ii) the Al–Zn–Mg–Cu types (e.g. 7075 and 7178), which are of higher strength, but less suitable
for welding. This is because the addition of copper extends the coherence range. Crack sensitivity
increases with copper content up to about 0.75% Cu and then decreases. With the Al–Zn–Mg types,
the crack sensitivity increases with magnesium content up to about 1% Mg and then decreases with
further increases in magnesium content.
An increasingly common application for laser welding of aluminum is in the casing of lithium
ion cells used in electric vehicles, where the top is welded to the case for a hermetic seal. Tightness
of the seal is important to prevent moisture from entering the cell to react with lithium and generate
gas and pressure that can degrade the cell. Spatter should also be avoided during the welding process
since the metal droplets can create short-circuiting within the cell.
For copper, it is often necessary to coat the surface to enhance absorption (Section 11.1.2.3).
The volatile nature of the zinc in brasses makes them difficult to laser weld. Silver and gold are
even more difficult to laser weld without prior treatment because of their higher reflectivity to the
laser beam, especially the CO2 laser. Alloys of nickel generally tend to absorb the CO2 laser beam
effectively, resulting in good welds, even though alloys such as Hastelloy X and Kovar are subject
to hot cracking. The reactive nature of tantalum, titanium, and zirconium alloys require that they be
welded in an inert atmosphere, since they are highly sensitive to oxidation.
10.4.3 Ceramic Materials
Laser welding of ceramic materials often presents problems because of the low thermal conductivity
of ceramic materials and also their inherent brittleness. The low thermal conductivity, coupled with
the high intensity of the laser beam, results in high-temperature gradients and thus high thermal
stresses which cause the ceramic materials to crack. Welding of mullite (3Al2O3⋅2SiO2) appears
to work well, provided it is preheated to a temperature of 700 ∘C to prevent cracking. Welding of
alumina (Al2O3) does not present problems. On the other hand, problems may arise when silicon❦

nitride (Si3N4) is welded. Other potential problems associated with welding of ceramic materials
include porosity that results from vaporization associated with heating.
10.4.4 Dissimilar Metals
Welding different materials is more difficult than welding two pieces of the same material for several
reasons:
(1) When different materials are welded, differences in composition between them can result in
the formation of intermetallic compounds or undesirable secondary phases if the solubility of
elements of the two materials is limited. This can produce an embrittled weld joint. Phases such
as eutectics and compounds that have low melting temperatures and/or are brittle can form,
depending on the phase diagram of the constituent elements, and these often reduce the joint
strength. For example, in laser lap welding of copper and aluminum, several different zones with
diverse characteristics of morphology and composition in the intermediate layer of the weld
joint can be observed (Figure 10.18). These include a banded structure with the intermetallic
compound CuAl embedded in a saturated solid solution in: zone 1; zone 2 which is a combination
of CuAl and CuAl2 with intermetallic compounds embedded in saturated solid solution; zone
3 with rod-like and cellular CuAl2 embedded in a wave eutectic; zone 4 which is a lamellar
eutectic; and zone 5 which is a dendritic hypoeutectic. These different intermetallic compounds
affect the mechanical properties of the joint.
(2) Differential thermal expansion resulting from different coefficients of expansion of the materials.
This can create severe stresses during welding, post-weld heat treatment, or in service.
(3) Differences in thermal conductivity. This can result in improper amounts of fused metal on the
two pieces. The material with the higher conductivity will have a smaller nugget size on its
side of the fused metal. This can be prevented by providing more heat to the higher thermal
conductivity material or preheating it.
(4) Different melting points. This may also result in the weld bead solidifying, while the lower
melting base material is hot and not strong enough. This can produce hot tensile failure if the
weldment is highly restrained.
(5) The formation of an electrolytic cell from the different materials. This can accelerate corrosion
in service.

WELDMENT DISCONTINUITIES 359
10.5 WELDMENT DISCONTINUITIES
A more detailed discussion on discontinuities is presented in Section 5.2. In this section, we further
discuss discontinuities that are commonly associated with laser welding, specifically porosity and
humping.
10.5.1 Porosity
Porosity formation in high-power CW laser welding of steels depends on the welding speed
(Figure 10.19). An increase in porosity with increasing speed is observed in deep penetration
welding, up to a peak, and then begins to decrease at higher welding speeds. This is because in the
initial stages, the increasing welding speed increases the depth-to-width ratio, which hinders the
ability of the evolved gas to escape, thus increasing porosity. At much higher speeds, however,
the reduced penetration enables the gas generated to escape more easily.
10.5.2 Humping
At very high welding speeds, say about 15 m/min depending on other process parameters, weld pool
instability often develops, resulting in humping (Figure 10.22), and undercutting, causing irregular
weld bead formation. Even though this phenomenon is not fully understood, one approach to miti￾gating it in electron beam welding has involved the use of a second beam to control flow within the
weld pool. Whereas there has not been an analytical basis to support this methodology, extensive
experimental data indicates that it is an effective means of preventing humping. The use of a sec￾ond beam in laser welding has also been shown to prevent humping or increase the speed at which
humping occurs. Another approach involves reducing the power input. However, the latter approach
does not appear to have significant enough supporting data to warrant its widespread use. Moreover,
a reduction in power input, and thus welding speed, implies a reduction in productivity.

10.6 ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF LASER WELDING
10.6.1 Advantages
The primary advantages of laser welding relative to conventional processes such as arc welding
include the following:
1. High depth-to-width ratio, ranging from 3 : 1 to 10 : 1.
2. Low and highly localized total heat input which results in minimal distortion and small
heat-affected zone size.
3. Noncontact processing.
4. The beam is neither affected by a magnetic field nor by passage through air and thus does not
require a vacuum for welding as required for electron beam welding. It also does not generate
radiation.
5. Easier access to the weld region, since the beam can be easily directed to ordinarily inacces￾sible regions. In this regard, Nd:YAG lasers are more flexible than CO2 lasers since Nd:YAG
lasers are more easily delivered to the workpiece using fiber optic cables.
6. Ability to weld dissimilar materials, since the heat input is limited to a very small region.
7. Ability to control the power density by focusing.
8. Easily automated process.
9. Relatively faster than most conventional welding processes.
10. Relatively high weld strength compared to most conventional welding processes.
10.6.2 Disadvantages
1. High cooling rates. The low energy input results in high cooling rates which may produce
hardening in the weld bead and also in portions of the heat-affected zone. This is especially
true of high-hardenability materials such as high carbon and some alloy steels. The formation
of such undesirable microstructures is normally mitigated by either preheating before welding
or post-weld heat treatment.
2. High transverse temperature gradients which may result in micro-cracking.
3. Need for precise fitting of joints. The small size of the heat source and resulting molten pool
require closely and accurately fitted joints, especially in the case of butt welding since any
significant opening will result in a void, undercut, or power loss through the opening.
4. High initial capital investment cost of the laser.
10.7 SPECIAL TECHNIQUES
Some of the special techniques that have been developed to enhance the quality of laser welds include
multiple-beam welding, arc-augmented welding, wobble welding, and RLW.
10.7.1 Multiple-Beam Welding
Multiple-beam welding can be used either to control the microstructure in the solid material (by
preheating and/or post-weld heat treating) or to control flow in the weld pool.❦
❦ ❦

SPECIAL TECHNIQUES 361
10.7.1.1 Multiple-Beam Preheating and Postheating As indicated in Section 10.6.2, one major
disadvantage with laser welding of certain materials (for example, high carbon and some alloy steels)
is that the highly intense beam results in a relatively small total heat input. As a result, very high
cooling rates are achieved that can form brittle phases in such materials, and consequently, cracking.
To reduce the high cooling rates, either preheating or post-weld heat treatment is used. However,
conventional preheating and post-weld heat treatment have several drawbacks. In the first place,
they often involve separate heating of the workpiece, usually in a furnace. This slows down the
production rate, since it introduces an additional step into the process. Secondly, since the entire
workpiece is often heated, energy is wasted, and also the heat applied may affect other portions of
the workpiece. Finally, conventional preheating and post-weld heat treatment are often either too
expensive or impractical to use, since the part may be complex in shape or bulky.
The drawbacks of traditional preheating and post-weld heat treatment can be eliminated by using
the multiple-beam configuration, which, in its simplest form, is illustrated in Figure 10.20. In this
configuration, there are two beams. One of the beams (the minor beam) is defocused, leads, and pre￾heats the joint, while the major beam follows and welds the material. In another configuration, the
defocused beam would follow the major beam, resulting in post-weld heat treatment. Either arrange￾ment reduces the cooling rates, thereby reducing or preventing the formation of hard microstructures.
This is especially useful in welding high hardenability materials such as high carbon and/or alloy
steels and some titanium alloys.
The analysis for the dual-heat-source system parallels that for the single-source system discussed
in Section 4.2. Since Eq. (4.3) is linear, we can use superposition for the two heat sources with the

requirement that a common coordinate system be used. The solution for the single point source is

(10.24)
This solution was obtained with the heat input at the origin of the moving coordinate system. For
the minor heat source which is displaced from the origin, we obtain the corresponding solution by
performing a linear transformation along the x-axis, giving
T2 − T20 = q2

(10.27)
where Θ = T1 +T2 – T10 – T20.
In analyzing the cooling rate, we again consider only the worst-case scenario, which occurs along
the bead centerline, that is, y = z = 0. Thus from Eq. (10.27), we have

With the moving heat source, cooling does not start until after the source passes the point of
interest. In this dual-heat-source case, one would expect the cooling to start after the leading source
passes the point. However, since the lead or minor source is only being used for preheating, and the
major source will reheat points between the two sources, most likely to a temperature higher than
that experienced as a result of the minor source, we are only interested in cooling rates along points
behind the major source, that is, for 𝜉 <0. This reduces Eq. (10.28) to

Without loss of generality in the basic deductions to be made, we further consider the situation
where the two heat sources are of the same intensity, which reduces Eq. (10.31) to the form:

(10.33)
The first term on the right-hand side of Eq. (10.33) is equivalent to the cooling rate at a temperature
Θ obtained for a single heat source. As is evident from the equation, introduction of the second heat
source results in a reduction term in the cooling rate equation. In other words, at a given temperature,
the dual-heat-source system reduces the cooling rate by an amount equal to the second term on the
right-hand side. Thus, at points in a dual-heat-source system and a single-source system which have
the same temperature (not necessarily the same location), the cooling rate will be lower for the
dual-source system, even if the heat input for the single-source system is the same as each of the
dual-system inputs.
The defocused preheating beam is useful when welding thin sheets. For relatively thick materials,
it might be necessary to have both beams focused and being used for penetration welding. The leading
beam then welds and at the same time preheats the material for the follow-up beam.
The use of the multiple-beam system also results in a reduction in the steep transverse temperature
gradients (dT
dy )
that arise during the welding process. This is especially useful in welding or cutting
inherently brittle materials such as ceramics, where the steep temperature gradients can induce high
thermal stresses and thus cause cracking of the workpiece.
The effect of the multiple-beam system on the weldment depends on the power ratio of the two
beams, the inter-beam spacing, and the distribution of the two beams. As Figure 10.21 illustrates, for
a given power of the major beam, increasing the power of the preheating beam reduces the cooling
rate for any temperature. The transverse temperature gradient is also reduced. It can be shown that
the lowest cooling rate is obtained when the preheating beam is behind the major beam, that is, the
inter-beam spacing is negative. That is essentially equivalent to post-weld heat treatment and implies
that in using the multiple-beam system, post-weld heat treatment would result in a lower cooling rate
than can be obtained from preheating. On the other hand, the highest transverse temperature gradients
are obtained when the inter-beam spacing is negative. In other words, post-weld heat treatment is
not as effective for reducing the transverse temperature gradients as preheating.
Thus, the configuration that is selected for a given application should be determined by the mate￾rial to be welded. For example, for alloy steels where the martensitic transformation can be a problem,
post-weld heat treatment, which effectively reduces cooling rates, should be used, whereas for ceram￾ics where the thermal stresses caused by transverse temperature gradients can present problems,
preheating would be more appropriate.
The distribution of the leading beam intensity affects neither the cooling rate nor transverse tem￾perature gradient as significantly as does the power ratio. However, the beam distribution tends to
affect the transverse temperature gradient more than the cooling rate.❦

Example 10.2 A CO2 laser output is split into two 3 kW beams and used for butt welding of two
semi-infinite plates of AISI 1080 steel, each 6 mm thick. A dual-beam system is used to prevent the
formation of a brittle microstructure in the weld bead. Assume that 20% of each beam is lost by
reflection.
If the critical cooling rate to avoid the formation of martensite in AISI 1080 is about 150 ∘C/s at
a temperature of 550 ∘C, and the minor heat source has been set at a distance d = 4 mm from the
major heat source, what is the maximum welding speed, ux, that can be used to avoid martensite
formation?

10.7.1.2 Multiple-Beam Flow Control A number of discontinuities such as humping and under￾cutting that arise during high-intensity welding processes are associated with the nature of molten
metal flow within the weld pool. Extensive research has been done using multiple beams to mini￾mize these defects in electron beam welding. The following discussion is based on the electron beam
research results. It is expected that in general, it will also apply to laser welding, given similarities
in the beam intensities.
At relatively high speeds, say greater than 15 m/min in the keyhole mode, humping can occur
(Figure 10.22). The pool width decreases, and the molten metal is forced to move at higher speeds
through the narrow channel between the lateral walls and the keyhole (Figure 10.23a).
In regions where the joint is not exposed, humping might appear to be esthetically acceptable
or could simply be machined off. However, beneath the hump often exists an opening or lack of
penetration which might result in structural weakness. It is difficult to suppress these discontinuities
in single-beam welding without compromising on the welding speed and penetration. However, such
defects have been shown to be effectively curtailed or suppressed by using two beams in series along
the welding direction in electron beam welding. One beam, B-1 (the leading or major beam, beam 1),
is used as a heat source to melt the specimen with full penetration, while the second beam, B-2 (the
trailing or minor beam, beam 2), is used to control flow of the molten metal (Figure 10.23b). Using
the same welding conditions that produce a humped bead at 15 m/min with a single beam, speeds of
up to 30 m/min can be achieved with the multiple-beam system.
Important parameters associated with multiple-beam processing include the inter-beam spacing
and power ratio. The location of B-2 with respect to the molten pool produced by B-1 affects the
quality of the bead produced and can be classified into three regions, region A, region B, and region
C (Figure 10.23b). In region A, the inter-beam spacing, lb, is less than the cavity length, lc, that is,
lb <lc(s), which means the second beam is located in the cavity formed by the leading beam. Hump￾ing and undercutting are enhanced under such circumstances. This is because the recoil pressure
due to the vapor resulting from the second beam accelerates the flow rate of the molten metal in the
pool cavity, thereby further elongating the cavity. In region B, lb, is less than the distance between a
single beam and its hump, lh(s), that is, lc(s)<lb <lh(s). In other words, the second beam impinges
on the surface of the molten pool between the pool cavity and the hump that would otherwise be
produced by the single beam. This is an effective way to prevent the hump formation. Under these

circumstances, the flow direction of the molten metal is changed toward the lateral walls, resulting
in melting of the solidified walls at the top and bottom of the lateral walls. This in turn broadens
the flow in the molten pool and, consequently, reduces the inner pressure of the pool and prevents
hump formation. With this configuration, the pool cavity length also becomes shorter. In region C,❦

the second beam is located much further down, beyond where the hump would start to form for the
single beam, and the bead formation again becomes irregular.
In addition to the location, proper selection of the beam power ratio is also important in achieving
good weld quality. If the power ratio (B-2 to B-1) is too low, broad undercutting results, and this is
because the flow generated by the second beam is not adequate to fill up the top and bottom parts
of the lateral walls with molten metal. On the other hand, if the power ratio is too large, an irregular
weld bead with undercutting results, as the second beam then widens the pool width. The optimum
power ratio of B-2 to B-1 in terms of pool uniformity (size from the top to the root) and stability has
been found to be about 10%.
10.7.2 Arc-Augmented Laser Welding
Laser welding can be significantly improved if combined with arc welding. Generally, for a given
total energy input to the process, the augmented process is found to produce a greater penetration
than either arc welding or laser welding by itself. For example, if a 5 kW laser beam is combined
with 300 amp gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW), the resulting depth of penetration is about 1.3
to 2 times that obtained using the 5 kW laser alone. Similarly, higher penetration is obtained with
the laser-augmented gas metal arc welding (LAGMAW) process than with gas metal arc welding
(GMAW) alone. The increase in penetration associated with LAGMAW is more significant at low
arc welding currents (Figure 10.24a). The reduction in penetration at higher currents could be due
to absorption of the laser beam by the increased plasma formation.
One possible setup is illustrated in Figure 10.24b. It is desirable to have the distance between
the laser beam and the electrode as close as possible. In the case of GTAW, no significant increases
in penetration is observed when the separation is less than 3 mm and the laser power is 2 kW with
a current of 300 amps, and a welding speed of 1 m/min. At greater distances, however, the pen￾etration reduces with increasing separation distance. In addition to increased penetration, another
advantage of the augmented welding process is the elimination of undercut and humping which
can occur at high speeds during GTAW alone. One disadvantage of arc-augmented welds is that
they tend to have a larger heat-affected zone size than a weld made using a laser of the same total
power.
The bead appearance is found to be better when the laser beam leads the arc in LAGMAW. This
is because the suppression gas flow does not affect the molten pool created by the arc. However, a
more stable arc is observed when the laser beam follows the arc.
10.7.3 Wobble Welding
The laser welding process can be enhanced using the wobble head design, which incorporates a
scanner within the weld head. This superposes a predefined motion of the focal spot on the weld
centerline motion defined by the joint trajectory, making the beam motion dynamically adjustable.
The resulting process is known as laser wobble or stir welding. For a circular motion, the scanned
beam speed, ub, is given by:
ub = 𝜋D𝜈 (10.34)
where 𝜈 is the wobble frequency and D is the wobble diameter. The overall beam speed is then
determined by ub and the specified welding speed, ux. However, ub is generally much higher than ux
and thus significantly influences the weld dynamics.
Any geometric pattern can be used for the wobble, but common designs are illustrated in
Figure 10.25a. For a constant energy input, increasing the amplitude of wobble oscillation (D)❦

changes the weld cross-sectional geometry from a traditional nail head to a rectangular profile
(Figure 10.25b), enabling the weld cross section to be effectively controlled. This may involve a
transition from a keyhole mode to conduction mode welding.
Figure 10.26 compares the welds obtained for butt, lap, and fillet welds when using wobble and
traditional laser welding processes. As can be observed in the figure, welds produced for fillet and lap
joints by traditional welding resulted in porosity, while the corresponding welds for wobble welding
were pore-free.❦

Wobble welding is more effective when the focused beam size is smaller, since a higher power
density is then obtained at the focal point. This makes it possible to initiate a keyhole while welding
high-reflectivity materials such as copper and aluminum using a near-infrared wavelength (about
1 μm) laser and yet be able to fill the joint with the smaller beam. In other words, joint fit-up require￾ments do not need to be as stringent. Smaller focused beam sizes (about 20 μm) are achievable with
single- and low-mode near-infrared fiber lasers.
Optimal selection of wobble parameters minimizes the potential for forming weld discontinuities
such as porosity and cracking.
10.7.4 Remote Laser Welding
RLW enables the welding process to be accomplished using long focal length optics (up to 1600 mm,
Table 10.2). The basic concept is illustrated in Figure 10.27a. The optics consists of two lenses and❦

two mirrors, with the first lens being moved along the optical axis to achieve correct positioning of
the focal point as the beam moves along the workpiece surface. The two mirrors move the beam in
the x and y directions. There are two forms of the beam delivery system:
1. Stationary head.
2. Robotic head.
Stationary Head Positioning of the focal point within the work envelope can be achieved with both
the workpiece and scan head stationary. The only components that move are the first lens and the
two mirrors. This has the advantages of accuracy, lower cost, and simplicity of programming. The
drawback is that the beam might not have access to certain parts of the workpiece, as the line of sight
might be blocked by part of the object.❦
❦ ❦
❦
SPECIFIC APPLICATIONS 371
Robotic Head The scanning system in this case is mounted at the end of a robot. Thus, all locations
of the workpiece surface are accessible. However, it is less accurate (since inaccuracies of the robot
contribute to the overall system error), more expensive, and more complex to program. Also, the
robot arm inertia slows down the system.
For both head types, the work envelope is in the form of a truncated pyramid (Figure 10.27b) and
is usually defined such that the maximum inclination of the beam to the work surface normal is 20∘.
RLW is especially useful in applications where joint accessibility is difficult, such as joints within
a muffler. It is also a good replacement for a number of spot welding applications and is thus being
increasingly used in the automotive industry. Major drawbacks of RLW are cost and quality. The high
initial cost is such that it only becomes more economical than resistance spot welding when a large
number of welds, say five million, are to be produced per year. Depending on the product design,
the quality of some of the welds produced by RLW can vary with position because of variations in
the beam orientation, and thus the area of incidence.
10.8 SPECIFIC APPLICATIONS
Two applications of laser welding that have received quite a bit of attention in recent years are
microwelding and welding of tailored blanks.
10.8.1 Microwelding
The small size to which the heat source can be focused makes laser welding suitable for welding
and soldering small components or joints as found in electronic components, medical devices, or
in attaching a thermocouple to a part for temperature measurement. The ability to weld dissimilar
metals using a laser beam and also the minimal thermal damage to surrounding material make it
particularly attractive in this regard. For such applications as microwelding in electronic circuitry,
the shorter wavelength fiber and Nd:YAG lasers make them preferable to the CO2 laser (10.6 μm
wavelength). The shorter wavelength beam is least absorbed by insulating materials and thus can
be scanned from one solder joint to another without shutting off the beam. In contrast, the longer
wavelength beam would need to be cycled on and off as the beam traverses from one joint to another
as it can damage the intermediate insulating material.
Specific examples of microwelding applications include micro-spot welding of razor head blades
together and hermetic instruments such as heart pace makers and transducers.
10.8.2 Laser-Welded Tailored Blanks
Tailored blank welding essentially involves welding of sheet metal blanks of either different thick￾nesses (gages), coatings (bare or galvanized), or materials (grades). There are two primary ways in
which tailored blanks are made:
1. Resistance mash-seam welding.
2. Laser welding.
This section focuses on laser-welded tailored blanks. Tailored blanks have replaced a number of
units that are traditionally produced by first forming single components, which are then subsequently
joined by welding, especially for the automotive body-in-white. One typical application of tailored
blanks in this area is the use of a thicker or higher strength material to replace the reinforcement that
would normally be required for strength or support. An example is the center pillar inner of a car body
(Figure 10.28), where a thicker material is used in the upper portion where a separate reinforcement❦

would normally be needed and joined to the thinner material that is subjected to lower stresses, before
forming.
10.8.2.1 Advantages of Tailored Blank Welding The advantages of tailored blanks over conven￾tionally produced body-in-white components include the following:
1. Weight reduction, achieved by welding a thinner gage to a thicker gage material that provides
reinforcement only where needed and also by elimination of reinforcement panels. The elim￾ination of weld flanges that are normally required for resistance spot welding of separately
formed parts also reduces weight.
2. Improved part functional performance. This results from improved structural rigidity and
body accuracy or dimensional control due to a reduction in assembly variation as a result
of a decrease in the number of stampings being assembled. This eliminates tolerance stackup,
since tailored blanks join sheets before they are stamped, rather than welding them after being
stamped.
3. Cost reduction through reduced stamping and assembly costs, and offal recovery. Offal is the
scrap metal blank that falls off during sheet metal blanking from coil. Small pieces from the
offal can be joined to form a functional single blank.
4. Reduced sealing needs.
5. Improved crash worthiness, since laser welds are stiffer than corresponding spot welds.
The advantages of tailored blank welding are further illustrated in Table 10.5, which compares two
traditional methods of producing the body side frame with tailored blank welding. In Table 10.5, the
separation (divided) method uses individual components (Figure 10.29), which are first formed, and
then joined, usually by spot welding. In the integration (one-sheet) method, cuts are made in a large
sheet panel to leave one large panel of the desired shape, which is then formed. In a sense, tailored
blank welding combines the two approaches by first welding appropriate individual components to
form the large panel of the desired shape (Figure 10.30).
10.8.2.2 Disadvantages of Tailored Blank Welding The disadvantages of tailored blank welding
include the following:
1. Formability performance. Due to the difference in thickness and/or strength of the two sheets,
forming of tailored blanks without producing defects is more difficult than traditional forming
of single sheets.❦

2. Required special edge preparation of the blanks. The gap between the blanks should not be
more than 10% of the thickness of the thinner blank. This is often achieved by precision shear￾ing, especially for long continuous welds of length greater than 1 m. Precision shearing may
not be necessary for shorter welds, since they can often be processed with a die cut edge. The
need for precision shearing, even for long welds, can also be eliminated by using filler wire or
beam weaving. However, these techniques tend to slow the process and add to cost.
3. Potential for hot cracking in steels containing significant amounts of sulfur and phosphorus.
4. Potential for enhancing die wear. Since the weld bead is usually harder than the base metal, the
welded sheet has a greater tendency to wear off die material than a single sheet that consists
of the base metal.
5. Removal of protective coating in the heat-affected zone of the weld. Since the heat-affected
zone size in laser welding is relatively small, the loss of coating may not be a significant factor.
10.8.2.3 Applications of Laser-Welded Tailored Blanks Even though there are a number of appli￾cations for tailored blanks in automotive body components, not all components can be candidates for
tailored blanks. Some of the common production applications in the automotive industry are shown
in Figure 10.30 and include center pillars, body side frames, upper and lower frame rails, roof rein￾forcement, rear deck lid, rear and front inner door panels, and floor panel. A typical vehicle may
have about 20 components that are candidates for tailored blank welding. Multi-gage inner panels
are considered to be among the tailor-welded blank applications that result in the highest benefits.
Some of the issues of concern that are often considered in setting up tailored blank applications
include the welding costs, weld seam characteristics such as quality, reliability of the welding sys￾tem, effect of welding on coatings, and weldment formability. Some of the important cost issues
include cost of the welding process, work material, blanking, pallets, transportation, blank protection,
inventory, and quality control. Critical factors that need consideration in application include the beam❦

power and characteristics, gap width, edge preparation, and clamping. Processing speeds typically
fall in the range of 4–10 m/min, depending on the laser power and sheet thickness.
The production system for laser-welded tailored blanks can be a fully automatic line with a num￾ber of workstations, or a manual single station operation. The latter would normally have a single
welding system (which would include facilities for blank shearing, laser beam, and gantry), and two
or more operators that perform the tasks of loading and unloading. The workstation may be either a
single- or two-axis system. Single-axis systems are more suitable for in-line or long continuous welds
which would normally be over a meter in length. Two-axis systems are appropriate for multiple,❦
❦ ❦

SPECIFIC APPLICATIONS 375
short welds in any planar orientation. In either case, the overall blank size that can be processed is
determined by the gantry and fixturing used.
Components of a full production system may include pallets, destacker, precision shearing
for edge preparation, material handling, laser generator, inspection station, dimpling station for
multi-gage blanks, and flipper when both left and right parts are made, for proper stacking of the
parts on the pallet. Optional items may include blank washing, weld cleaning, oiling, and trimming.
Some important factors to be considered in designing a production system include the following:
1. Sheet gage – single or multi-gage. This determines the type of clamping device to be used.
Also, dimplers are required for the thinner sheet of multi-gage blanks, to ensure even stacking
on the pallet.
2. Desired length of weld. This determines the gantry specifications.
3. Number of welds required per part.
10.8.2.4 Formability of Tailor-Welded Blanks Formability is a measure of the ease of forming
a given material or body without failure. The formability of welded blanks is influenced by weld
parameters such as the following:
1. Butt joint gap, which is the space between the two sheets (Figure 10.31a).
2. Beam misalignment, which is the offset of the centerline of the laser beam from the centerline
of the gap (Figure 10.31b).
3. Shielding gas type and flow rate.
4. Focal point location.
5. Welding speed.
6. Laser power.
Some observations regarding the influence of process parameters on formability may be summarized
as follows:
1. Formability increases with increasing welding speed, since the increased welding speed results
in a reduced weld section, even though the hardness of the weld increases.

2. An increase in misalignment or joint gap reduces formability.
3. Misalignment or joint gap tend to promote high weld concavity, and these have relatively high
failure rates. Generally, misalignment and joint gap have to be less than 0.05 mm to enhance
quality and formability.
Uniaxial tension tests provide the simplest approach to assess the formability of tailor-welded
blanks. It is more appropriate to use longitudinal specimen, that is, those cut along the weld with the
welding line in the center of the specimen (Figure 10.32a), since these provide information on the
mechanical properties of the welded blank. Transverse specimen (Figure 10.32b) do not provide ade￾quate formability information, since deformation then occurs primarily in the base metal outside the
weld. The higher yield strength of the weld then prevents plastic deformation in the weld. Transverse
specimen thus primarily provide information on the weldment quality. It should be noted, however,
that even for the longitudinal specimen, the tensile properties that are measured would depend on
the ratio of the weld width to the entire tension specimen width. Thus, the specimen widths that are
used, typically about 6 mm, are preferably smaller than the standard widths used for tensile tests.
When the direction of principal strain is in the direction of the weld, failure normally occurs in the
weld, with the crack running transversely (Figure 10.33a). This form of failure may occur in welds
made from materials with similar thicknesses/strengths. The other form of failure involves a crack
that runs parallel to and is adjacent to the weld and occurs primarily in welds made from dissimilar
thicknesses/strengths (Figure 10.33b). This normally occurs when the direction of principal strain is
normal to the weld line, and fracture tends to occur in the lower strength or thinner material. Thus,
optimum formability performance may be achieved by placing the weld line away from the major
strain direction and/or away from the areas with high component strain level in the direction along
the weld line, preferably perpendicular to the major strain direction.
10.8.2.5 Limiting Thickness or Strength Ratio When the thickness ratio or strength ratio of a
tailor-welded blank exceeds a critical value, the material with the higher strength or thickness may
be subjected to very little or no plastic deformation in the direction transverse to the weld direction,
while the material of lower strength or thickness exceeds its forming limit near the weld. The limiting
thickness ratio (LTR) (for same materials with different thicknesses) or limiting strength ratio (LSR)
(for different materials with a prespecified thickness ratio) is the thickness or strength ratio at which
one material just reaches initial yield strength when the other material reaches its forming limit.
When this value is exceeded, failure may occur parallel to the weld, with cracking occurring on the❦

side of the material of lower thickness or strength. When the thickness and strength ratios are less
than the LTR and LSR, respectively, plastic deformation would occur in both materials.
To develop an expression for the LTR or LSR, let us consider Figure 10.34, which shows two
materials (1 and 2) that are joined by a laser weld. Neglecting friction effects, equilibrium in the
transverse direction gives

where F is the force per unit width and the subscripts 1 and 2 represent the materials 1 and 2,
respectively.
Eq. (10.35a) can be written as:
𝜎1h1 = 𝜎2h2 (10.35b)
where 𝜎 is the true stress and h is the instantaneous material thickness.
The true strain, 𝜀z, in the thickness direction is given by:
𝜀z = ln ( h
h0
)
(10.36)
where h0 is the original thickness.
Thus,
h = h0e𝜀z (10.37)
Considering volume constancy during plastic deformation, we have
𝜀x + 𝜀y + 𝜀z = 0 (10.38)
where 𝜀x is the true strain in the welding direction (parallel to the weld in the sheet plane) and 𝜀y is
the true strain in the transverse direction (normal to the weld in the sheet plane).
From Eqs. (10.35a,b), (10.37), and (10.38), we get
𝜎1h01e−(𝜀x)1−(𝜀y)1 = 𝜎2h02e−(𝜀x)2−(𝜀y)2 (10.39)
The strain component parallel to the weld (longitudinal strain) must be the same in both materials
(1 and 2), that is,
(𝜀x)1 = (𝜀x)2 (10.40)
Thus,
𝜎1h01e−(𝜀y)1 = 𝜎2h02e−(𝜀y)2 (10.41)
or
S1h01 = S2h02 (10.42)
where S is the engineering stress.
If two sheets of the same material but different thicknesses are being welded, then from
Eq. (10.42), the LTR can be obtained from
ST h01 = Syh02 (10.43)
where ST is the tensile strength of the material and Sy is the yield strength of the material.
The LTR is then given by:
LTR = limit of (h02
h01 )
= ST
Sy
(10.44)
If, on the other hand, the two sheets are made from different materials but have a prespecified
thickness ratio, then Eq. (10.42) becomes

and the LSR is then given by:

normally has to be 1.25 or less, since the formability of the part reduces

10.8.3 Laser Transmission Welding of Plastics
Laser transmission welding has evolved as an effective approach to joining plastics, especially ther￾moplastics. One of the workpieces to be joined is generally transparent to the laser beam, while the
other workpiece is designed to have material properties that enable it to effectively absorb the beam.
The two pieces are kept in intimate contact, usually by clamping. For the simple case of a lap joint,
as illustrated in Figure 10.35, the laser beam is incident on and transmitted through the transparent
plastic (top layer) to the interface between the two workpieces, where significant absorption of the
beam occurs. This is made possible by either coating the interface with a highly absorbing material
or making the lower workpiece absorbing by pigmentation, usually with carbon black. Additional
absorption then occurs as the beam propagates further into the absorbing workpiece. The energy
absorbed at the interface and in the absorbing workpiece heats up the interface and surrounding
areas. Material in this region thus expands, increasing the interface pressure, and thus thermal con￾tact conductance, which further enhances heat transfer to the transparent workpiece. The end result
is melting of material in the region, accompanied by diffusion of the polymer molecules, thereby
forming the joint on solidification.
Most thermoplastics are transparent to radiation in the near-infrared range (0.78–3 μm), more
specifically up to 1.5 μm. Thus, Nd:YAG, diode, and some fiber lasers are very effective for
laser transmission welding, enabling clear polymers to be welded to other polymers or to metals.
A high-speed galvanometer scanner (wobble welding) may be used to control heat input and melting
of the polymer at the interface where the beam is mostly absorbed.
The transparency depends on the extent of crystallinity of the thermoplastic, as the crystalline
structure scatters part of the laser beam. The beam transmission (Tr) is also affected by fillers,
colorants, reinforcement, and other modifiers, all of which result in additional diffuse scattering
(multiple specular reflectance). This increases the effective optical path length of the transmitted
beam and also deflects part of the beam from the incident beam direction. Analysis of transmission

through the transparent material can therefore be quite complex but is often approximated using the
Beer–Lambert law as:
Tr = 10−Ab (10.47)
where Ab is the absorbance. For low absorbance, the overall beam transmittance, Tor, can be approx￾imated as:
Tor = 1 − Ab − R (10.48)
where R is the reflectance.
The process can be implemented in different ways as follows:
1. The more traditional seam (contour) welding, where the heat source moves along the joint.
2. Simultaneous (spot) welding, where the laser beam covers the entire region to be joined, heat￾ing and bonding the two pieces together simultaneously.
3. Mask welding, where a mask is used to direct the laser beam only to regions that need to be
joined.
The temperature distribution that results in the workpieces depends on the manner in which the
laser beam is applied (contour, simultaneous, or mask), as well as the absorption method (interface
coating or pigmentation). Increasing the amount of carbon black in the absorbing workpiece reduces
the depth of molten region in that workpiece and an increase in the depth in the transparent workpiece,
since most of the heat is then generated close to the interface.
The temperature distribution also depends on whether the workpieces are reinforced or not. The
presence of fibers and their orientation affect the workpiece absorption and thermal conduction prop￾erties, and consequently, the weld bead geometry.
Typical processing parameters might consist of a 150 W CW power output that is focused using a
100–300 mm focal length lens, with speeds ranging from 450 to 4000 mm/min and pressures between
0.7 and 4.5 MPa. Excessive energy input may degrade the polymer.
Advantages of laser transmission welding include the following:
1. Ability to control energy deposition with high precision.
2. Noncontact process.
3. High production rates.
4. Suitability to sensitive components (for example, medical and electronic parts), since there is
no vibration during the process.
5. Minimal heat-affected zone.

SPECIFIC APPLICATIONS 381
10.8.4 Laser Brazing
Laser brazing is simply another form of brazing where a laser is used as the heat source, instead
of the traditional sources such as a furnace or gas torch. It is used for joining dissimilar materials
which are not easily welded using conventional fusion welding processes. The advantage with the
laser is the localized heat input, which minimizes the formation of brittle intermetallics. The amount
of undesirable phases formed depends on the process time/temperature history, which may vary with
location, depending on the workpiece geometries, and the type of filler material used, if any.
There are two basic forms of laser brazing. These are as follows:
1. Non-autogenous.
2. Autogenous.
10.8.4.1 Non-Autogenous Laser Brazing Non-autogenous laser brazing is essentially a laser￾based variation of conventional brazing in that a filler metal is made to flow between faying surfaces.
The process has been used to braze a 5052 aluminum alloy to a 304 stainless steel, and also
interstitial free steel, both of thickness 1.2 mm, using a diode laser with an aluminum filler metal,
1.2 mm in diameter, and Nocolock flux. Joint strengths obtained were as high as 80% the strength
of the aluminum alloy, increasing with the laser power, up to an optimum value (at laser powers
of 1200–1350 W), and then decreasing. Al–Fe intermetallic compounds are formed, but the amount
depends on the laser power and other brazing conditions. So does the weld quality in general. The
tendency to crack increases with the intermetallic layer thickness, which itself increases with laser
power. The diode laser is effective because of its short wavelength and high absorptivity in metals.
Since wettability of molten metal improves with increasing temperature, penetration is enhanced at
higher powers. The braze wire feed speed is normally the same as the brazing speed. Laser beam
size may range between 1 and 2 mm.
Non-autogenous laser brazing has also been used to join ceramic to steel. A major challenge to
this process is the poor wettability of molten metals on ceramics. This is mitigated by using filler
materials that contain Ti or Zr to improve wettability. Another challenge is the large differences in
thermal expansion coefficient and elastic modulus of ceramics and metals. This can be addressed
by placing a layer of ductile metal between the two workpieces, minimizing the residual stresses
induced in the ceramic. For the specific case of aluminum oxide to steel, an AgCuTi-foil of thickness
50 μm was used as the braze filler metal. A CO2 laser, defocused to a spot size of about 5 mm, was
used as the heat source at power levels between 300 and 360 W and offset slightly toward the steel
workpiece. The resulting joint strength though was lower than that of the original ceramic.
10.8.4.2 Autogenous Laser Brazing Autogenous laser brazing is effectively used to join dissim￾ilar metals without using filler material. It involves the application of heat to the higher melting
material, which transfers the thermal energy to the lower melting component by conduction. The
interface is maintained at a temperature between the melting points of the two metals to be brazed.
The process has been effectively used to join a 6056 aluminum alloy to low-carbon steel using an
Nd:YAG laser. First, Nocolok flux mixed with alcohol is precoated on the faying surfaces to break
down any oxide film. The laser beam then irradiates the steel surface, which conducts the heat to
the aluminum workpiece, resulting in melting of a thin layer of aluminum material (of the order of
microns) at the interface, which subsequently solidifies to form a joint. Interface temperatures of
about 800 ∘C have been found to result in good joints. Since the steel has a much higher melting
temperature, it does not melt. Higher interface temperatures increase the thickness of the molten
layer and its wettability (smaller wetting angle), as well as diffusion into the solid metal. Cracks❦
❦ ❦
❦
382 LASER WELDING
may form when the process results in an intermetallic layer of thickness greater than 10 μm, but that
depends on the nature of intermetallics that are formed.
Titanium and aluminum alloys, specifically Ti6Al4V and A6061 of 2 mm thickness, have also
been joined by fiber laser brazing without filler wire using a 4 kW laser at a speed of 4 m/min. For
a butt joint, when the laser beam is offset a distance of 0.8 to 1.0 mm into the Al workpiece, there
is no melting of the titanium alloy. The joint strength then increases as the offset distance increases,
since the thickness of intermetallic TiAl3 formed at the interface is then relatively small. When the
offsetting distance is less than 0.8 mm, partial melting of the titanium alloy occurs, producing cracks
and porosity caused by intermetallic compounds.
10.9 SUMMARY
Laser welding can be done using CO2, Nd:YAG, and fiber lasers. The key parameters that influ￾ence the process are the beam power and characteristics, traverse speed, shielding gas, relative
location of the focal point, and joint configuration. As an example, a 12 mm-thick carbon steel
plate can be welded with a CO2 laser using an output power of 9 kW at a speed of 0.8 m/min, or
a 6 mm-thick carbon steel plate can be welded with a CO2 laser using an output power of 25 kW
at a speed of 10 m/min. As the welding speed increases, the depth of penetration for a given power
decreases.
A Gaussian beam mode results in a greater depth-to-width ratio than higher-order modes. How￾ever, the larger spot size of multimode beams makes them more suited for butt welding applications,
since it reduces the tight fit-up requirements. The effect of polarization on the process depends on
the material and welding conditions. For some steels, the depth of penetration is increased when the
direction of polarization is aligned with the welding direction, and when the welding speed is above
a critical value.
Both pulsed and CW laser beams can be used for welding, with pulsed beams being more suited
for spot welding, while CW beams are more suited for continuous welds. Pulsed beams can also
be used for continuous welds if the pulses are made to overlap. With high-power beams, a portion
of the laser energy is expended in ionizing part of the shielding gas and/or vapor to form a plasma.
This plasma may absorb part of the laser beam and may also induce an optical lensing effect that
changes the effective focusing of the laser beam. Shielding gases are used to blow away the vapor
and plasma formed, provide a protective environment for the weld pool, and protect the focusing
lens. Common shielding gases used are argon and helium. Argon is more commonly used for low￾to medium-power laser welding. It is also generally preferred to have the focal point either on the
workpiece surface or just below it.
Laser welding may occur in the conduction mode (normally used for foils and thin sheets), or
keyhole mode (for relatively thick sections). In conduction mode welding, the laser power is first
deposited on the surface and then transferred by conduction to the surroundings. Absorption in the
keyhole occurs by inverse bremsstrahlung of the plasma and by Fresnel absorption (direct deposition)
at the cavity walls.
Low-carbon steels and some stainless steels are easily welded with a laser, while brass, silver,
and galvanized steel are more difficult to weld. Common defects that affect product quality include
porosity, cracking, and humping. A dual-beam system can be used either to control the cooling rates
and therefore the microstructure in the solid material (by preheating and/or post-weld heat treating),
or to control flow in the weld pool. Combining a laser beam with an arc welder increases the depth
of penetration obtained compared to that for either process alone.
With wobble welding, where the laser beam is scanned with a specific geometry along the joint,
the weld penetration and width can be controlled, and the formation of discontinuities minimized.❦

APPENDIX 10.A 383
RLW also enables the welding process to be accomplished using long focal length optics and is
useful in applications where joint accessibility is difficult.
Lasers are effectively used in microwelding and also in tailored blank welding, which involves
welding of sheet metal blanks of either different thicknesses (gages), coatings (bare or galvanized),
or materials (grades). In recent years, lasers have seen increasing use in welding of plastics where one
of the workpieces to be welded is made transparent to the laser beam, while the other is absorbing.
The energy accumulated by the absorbing layer heats up the workpieces at the interface. Nd:YAG,
diode, and fiber lasers are most suited to this type of welding, referred to as laser transmission weld￾ing. Lasers have also been increasingly used for brazing, especially of dissimilar metals, because
of the localized heat input, which minimizes the formation of brittle intermetallics. The process
can be either autogenous or non-autogenous. Non-autogenous welding is preferred when there is
poor wettability between the two materials. This is mitigated by using filler materials that improve
wettability.

11 Laser Surface Modification
Laser surface modification is used to change the surface composition, microstructure, or geometry
of a material to give it certain desired properties. This may involve hardening the surface to increase
its resistance to wear, or inducing compressive residual stresses in the surface layers to enhance
fatigue life.
There are six major forms of laser surface modification. These are the following:
1. Laser surface heat treatment.
2. Laser surface melting (skin melting or glazing).
3. Laser direct metal deposition (cladding, alloying, and hard coating).
4. Laser physical vapor deposition.
5. Laser shock peening.
6. Laser surface texturing.
In laser surface heat treatment, no melting takes place, while in laser surface melting, a thin surface
layer of the workpiece is melted, and as a result of the rapid quenching, may form new structures
which are harder. In laser deposition, a second material is applied to the surface and melted by the
laser beam either to alloy with a thin surface layer of the base material or to bond to the surface.
However, in laser physical vapor deposition, the second material is applied in vapor form, and no
melting takes place. Laser shock peening, however, generates shock waves which induce compres￾sive residual stresses on the surface of the material. Surface texturing is a means of modifying the
geometric features of a surface to impart desired properties to it. These forms of surface modification
are discussed in greater detail in the following sections according to the listed order.
11.1 LASER SURFACE HEAT TREATMENT
Surface heat treatment normally involves exposing the surface of a material to a thermal cycle of
rapid heating and cooling such that the surface layers in the case of steels, for example, are first
austenitized, and then quenched, to induce martensitic transformation. The process does not involve
melting, and the transformations occur in the solid state.
The hardness of the martensite formed when steel is heat treated enhances the wear resis￾tance of the surface. Examples of components that are hardened by laser heat treatment include
laser-hardened wear tracks for power steering housing, cam shafts, automobile valve guides and
seats, gear teeth, diesel cylinder liner bores, surface hardening of cylinder head units in aluminum
car engines, hard-facing of car distribution shafts, and surface hardening of mill rollers.

The setup for laser surface heat treatment is illustrated schematically in Figure 11.1. Rapid cooling
results from mass or self-quenching into the bulk surrounding material and may result in martensitic
transformation even in some low carbon steels. The cooling rates for laser heat treatment can be
as high as 107 ∘C/s (compare with cooling rates of about 300 ∘C/s for arc welding) and produce
relatively short austenitizing cycles (on the order of 0.01–1.0 second).
The essential steps involved in laser hardening normally comprise the following:
1. Cleaning: to remove surface contaminants such as oil.
2. Masking: to limit hardening to desired areas only. This step is not always necessary.
3. Coating: to increase beam absorption.
4. Hardening: the actual laser treatment.
5. Tempering: to reduce crack susceptibility of the fully martensitic case.
6. Cleaning: to remove any remaining coating.
7. Inspection: to ensure no defective parts are produced.
In this section, we first discuss criteria that are necessary for successful laser surface treatment.
This is followed by a discussion on the key process parameters. A brief overview of the temperature
field associated with laser surface treatment is then presented, followed by a discussion on
microstructural changes in steels. Materials other than steels are then considered. Next, the hardness
and residual stresses that result during laser surface treatment are discussed. Finally, the steps
involved, and advantages and disadvantages of the process are presented.
11.1.1 Important Criteria
There are two criteria that are essential for a successful laser surface treatment operation:
1. For steels, the region to be hardened needs to be heated well into the austenite temperature
range and be maintained in that temperature range long enough for carbon diffusion to occur.
2. There must be adequate mass in contact with the region to be hardened to permit
self-quenching by conduction into the bulk material.❦

11.1.2 Key Process Parameters
The principal processing parameters that affect laser surface heat treatment are
1. Beam power, beam size, scanning speed, and shielding gas.
2. Beam mode.
3. Beam absorption by the workpiece.
4. Workpiece material properties and initial microstructure.
The process outputs include the hardness, depth of the hardened region, microstructure, and resid￾ual stresses induced.
These key process parameters are discussed in greater detail in the following Sections
11.1.2.1–11.1.2.4.
11.1.2.1 Beam Power, Size, Speed, and Shielding Gas Typical process parameters associated
with laser heat treatment are listed in Table 11.1.
A reduction in the scan rate reduces the surface hardness, but increases the depth of the hardened
zone (Figure 11.2). This is because reducing the scanning velocity increases the surface temperature
and the reaction time for austenitization, resulting in a larger average austenite grain size. Shielding
gas (usually argon or helium) may be used to protect the surface from oxidation with flow rates
similar to those used during laser welding, about 10 l/min. Due to its higher thermal conductivity,
helium results in higher hardness, all other parameters being constant.
Due to the relatively small size of the laser beam, it is often necessary to scan the surface a number
of times, with the beam being shifted a specific amount for each scan. To ensure that the entire
area of interest is treated, there has to be some amount of overlap between the scans. However, the
overlap may anneal portions of the previously hardened structure. Whereas such annealing may not
significantly affect the wear properties of a material, it could have significant impact on the fatigue
properties, with the softened regions providing preferential sites of stress relaxation at the surface.
11.1.2.2 Beam Mode In contrast to laser cutting, low order beam modes (for example, Gaussian
mode) are not particularly suitable for laser surface treatment because of the lack of uniformity in
intensity distribution. A relatively wide and uniformly distributed beam is required to obtain uni￾form surface heating over a wide area and thus avoid localized surface melting. This is done using
beam-shaping techniques.
Among the methods commonly available for shaping a laser beam into a more uniform distribu￾tion are the following:
1. Beam defocusing using a lens.
2. Optical integration.
3. Beam rastering or scanning.❦

Beam Defocusing This approach is based on normal focusing using a lens. The beam shape is
similar to that of the original beam, and the size is changed by varying the distance between the
focusing lens and the workpiece or by using an appropriate lens. Thus, the focal point is positioned
above the workpiece surface. A focusing system with a very high F number or long focal length
may be more effective for this method. The F number is the ratio of the focal length of a lens to
its diameter. Since beam defocusing does not necessarily produce a uniform beam distribution, the
resulting penetration depth distribution across the heat treated track is also non-uniform. Only about
20–30% of the track width may be of uniform penetration depth, depending on the original beam
mode. Since the focusing lens is normally part of the beam delivery system, this method is the easiest
to implement. It requires no additional effort or expense.
Optical Integration Optical integration involves segmenting the beam into a large number of por￾tions and superposing the individual segments on the same focal plane using a beam integrator.
A beam integrator has a number of small mirror segments mounted on a base plate, that is, a mul￾tifaceted mirror (Figure 11.3a). Contiguous mirror segments are positioned to be in close contact
with each other to minimize beam loss between the segments. The outcome of optical integration is
illustrated in Figure 11.3b where a Gaussian beam is segmented into four portions of equal size, and
then superposed at the focal plane. Two of the segmented beams are of one orientation, while the
other two are of opposite orientation, resulting in near-perfect intensity averaging. In normal cases
where the beam is not necessarily symmetrical, as many mirror segments as possible are used.
One drawback of beam integrators is the interference effects that are induced in the integrated
beam as a result of the mirror edges. Each edge results in diffraction effects and their superposition
produces interference fringes. The higher the Fresnel number, the lower the diffraction losses, and
thus the more uniform the integrated beam. The Fresnel number typically ranges between 6 and 12
(low) for infrared wavelength beams. A high Fresnel number would be about 100.❦

What this means is that, for the diffraction losses to be high, the Fresnel number has to be low.
Optical integration generally has the most uniform beam distribution, resulting in about 60–70%
of the track width being of uniform penetration depth.
The optics for integrating an output laser beam generally consists of three main components:
1. A flat mirror for beam bending.
2. A spherical convex mirror for expanding the laser beam to fully illuminate the face of the beam
integrator for efficient beam integration.
3. A spherical concave beam integrating mirror, which segments the beam into several small
beams.
Installation of the optical integration system is easy, but requires more effort than beam
defocusing.
Beam Rastering or Scanning A uniformly distributed beam can also be achieved by rastering a
finely focused beam to cover a wide area (Figure 11.5). The process involves vibrating two mirrors
to get the beam to move back and forth at a high frequency to create the required pattern. Like the
optical integration system, installation of the beam rastering system is also easy, but again requires
more effort than beam defocusing.
Summary of Beam-Shaping Methods The characteristics of the three types of beam-shaping devices
are summarized in Table 11.2.
Figure 11.6a–c illustrate three common forms of beam shape that are used. The circular or ellip￾tical pattern Gaussian beam can be broadened by defocussing; the uniform pattern rectangular beam
can be obtained by optical integration; and the rectangular pattern Gaussian beam is achieved by
rastering or oscillating a Gaussian beam at a frequency of several hundred Hertz. The corresponding
geometry of the hardened and heat-affected zones are also shown in the figures. It is obvious from the
figures that the softened heat-affected zone at the part surface is significantly wider for the circular
Gaussian beam. The rectangular patterns reduce the width of this zone. However, the depth of the
softened region is smaller for the circular Gaussian beam.❦

11.1.2.3 Beam Absorption The heat treatment process is strongly influenced by
1. Absorption of the beam, which depends on the beam wavelength.
2. Angle of incidence.
3. Material properties or core microstructure.
4. Workpiece surface conditions (finish, coating, and so on).
The high reflectivity of the laser beam when used on metals is a major disadvantage of laser
surface treatment. This is especially true of the CO2 laser beam when incident on metals like copper,
gold, and silver. Some of the common techniques that are used to improve absorptivity of reflective
materials for effective processing include the following:
1. Applying a thin layer of a highly absorbing coating to the material surface.
2. Using a linearly polarized laser beam on an uncoated surface.
3. Preheating the workpiece, since absorptivity increases with temperature.❦

4. Changing the composition of the material surface by oxidation before processing. However,
this approach tends to be more expensive and may not be acceptable for esthetic reasons.
Thus, it will not be further discussed.
In the following sections, the first three methods of enhancing absorption are further discussed.
Surface Coating When a surface coating is used, it must have the following characteristics:
1. High thermal stability.
2. Good adhesion to work surface.
3. Chemically passive to workpiece.
4. Easy to remove after treatment.
Examples of coatings normally used are the following:
1. A dispersion of carbon black in alcohol with a binder (colloidal graphite).❦
❦ ❦
❦
LASER SURFACE HEAT TREATMENT 399
2. Chemically deposited copper selenide layer (about 2 μm thick).
3. Manganese, zinc, or iron phosphate (about 2–100 μm thick).
4. Black paint (about 10–20 μm thick).
For these, the fraction of the incident energy that is absorbed by the surface when coated is esti￾mated to be in the range of 60–80% for a CO2 laser, and this can vary during interaction of the
laser beam with the absorptive coating. Graphite is easily applied and is inert, but is relatively more
expensive. An excessive coating tends to reduce penetration, as some of the energy absorbed may
not be easily transmitted to the base material.
In addition to increasing beam absorption, a carefully applied coating ensures reproducibility of
the process. Essentially, all the power that enters the material is absorbed at the surface, and the depth
and width of the transformed region depends on the resulting temperature distribution.
Certain coatings, especially the phosphates, have the disadvantage that during processing, they
may impregnate along grain boundaries of the base material, Figure 11.7, to form low melting com￾pounds where failure can be initiated. Surface coatings also have the disadvantage that they add to
the cost of the process and may prove to be an environmental hazard (especially paints) when they are
vaporized during heating. Also, the absorptivity is influenced by variations in thickness or adhesion
properties of a surface coating.
Linearly Polarized Beam As discussed in Chapter 3, when an unpolarized beam is incident on a
surface at the polarizing angle, the reflected beam is linearly or plane polarized. This is because the
component of the electric vector parallel to the plane of incidence vanishes, while the perpendicular
component is reflected (Figure 3.2).
When the plane polarized beam is incident on a surface, depending on its orientation, it can
have components parallel (p-polarized) and perpendicular (s-polarized) to the plane of incidence.
The parallel component is efficiently absorbed at high angles of incidence while the perpendicular
component is highly reflected. Thus by using an angle of incidence greater than, say 60∘, for a lin￾early polarized beam, the parallel component (p-polarized beam) will be efficiently absorbed by the
surface. The depth of hardening will therefore be greater if a p-polarized beam is used at an incidence
angle that corresponds with the angle of maximum absorptivity (Figure 11.8). The drawback of this
approach, however, is the significant power loss incurred in the conversion of an unpolarized laser
beam to a linearly polarized beam.
Preheating As indicated in Section 8.1.6, the absorptivity of a material increases with an increase in
its temperature, for a given wavelength (Figure 8.6). Thus one effective way for enhancing absorption

of the incident laser is to preheat the workpiece before the heat treatment process. The drawback with
this approach, however, is that preheating introduces an additional step into the process. Furthermore,
the preheating may affect the microstructure of the surrounding material.
11.1.2.4 Initial Workpiece Microstructure The initial microstructure (for example, size of
ferrite grains and pearlite colonies) of the workpiece, prior to laser heat treatment, influences the
depth of hardening that can be achieved. This is because the distance that the carbon atoms have
to diffuse affects the homogenization of austenite, and thus the rate of structural transformation.
When the initial or core microstructure is such that the carbon diffusion distance is very small (fine
microstructure with a smaller grain size), deep surface-hardened casings are obtained. Thus finer
and more evenly distributed carbide dispersoids in a quenched and tempered structure (martensitic
or bainitic microstructure prior to laser heat treatment) readily dissolve at lower temperatures within
the available exposure time, and thus produce a better hardening effect. On the other hand, when
the initial microstructure is coarse (for example, spheroidized), then the carbon diffusion distance
needed for the homogenization of austentite is long. This results in less uniform carbon distribution
in the austentite, and thus a thin surface-hardened casing (Figure 11.9). The transition from the full
martensite hardness to the core hardness is also found to be more gradual in a coarse structure than
in a fine structure.
However, for steels with the same carbon content, both fine and coarse structured samples will
have the same surface hardness since the extremely high surface temperature results in homogeneous
austenitization in the surface region for both structures. Furthermore, since the thermal properties
of steels do not change significantly with carbon and alloy content, the same cooling rates will be
obtained for the same heat treating conditions. Alloy content may increase the hardenability of the
steel, enabling it to form more martensite for a given cooling rate. Hardenability is a measure of
the amount of martensite that forms in the microstructure upon cooling. This is affected by both the
alloying elements and carbon content. However, since the hardness of a steel is determined primarily❦

by the carbon content, an alloy and a plain carbon steel of the same carbon content will have the same
hardness of martensite that is formed, but not necessarily the same overall hardness.
11.1.3 Temperature Field
Analysis of heat flow during laser surface treatment can be made using methods that are discussed
in Section 4.2. Thus, only a brief reference will be made in this section. Since absorption of the laser
beam in a solid metal is confined to a thin surface layer, the z dependence of the absorption can be
neglected, and the absorption considered to be two dimensional. Considering a Gaussian distributed
heat source moving in a semi-infinite plate in the x-direction, the temperature distribution in the y–z
plane (Figure 4.1) can be expressed as

11.1.4 Microstructural Changes in Steels
Steels are extensively discussed in this section because they are still among the most widely used
metal alloys today. Some metals undergo polymorphic transformation (that is, change their crystal
structure) when heated above a certain temperature. The change in crystal structure also changes
their properties. An example is iron which changes from 𝛼-iron with the BCC structure at room tem￾perature to 𝛾-iron with the FCC structure when heated above 910 ∘C (Appendix 11.B). The solubility❦

402 LASER SURFACE MODIFICATION
of carbon in 𝛾-iron is greater than in 𝛼-iron, and this makes steel subject to significant changes in
property when heat treated.
The overall transformation process during heat treatment of steels occurs in three stages:
1. Diffusion-controlled transformation of pearlite to austenite (pearlite dissolution).
2. Diffusion-controlled homogenization of carbon in austenite.
3. Diffusionless or displacive transformation of austenite to martensite.
These three stages are discussed in further detail in the following Sections 11.1.4.1–11.1.4.3.
11.1.4.1 Pearlite Dissolution Pearlite dissolution involves the transformation of the pearlite
colonies to austenite as the material is heated. For plain carbon steels, when the material is heated
above the eutectoid (A1) temperature, the pearlite colonies transform to austenite. For pre-eutectoid
steels, as the temperature increases, the size of the austenite regions increase by outward diffusion
of carbon from the high-carbon (0.8% C) pearlite colonies into the ferrite region. Let the spacing of
the pearlite plates in a colony be lp, Figure 11.10. Then lateral diffusion of carbon over a distance
lp might be considered sufficient to convert the colony to austenite. For an isothermal process, the
time, t, required for such diffusion is given by the equation:
lp
2 = 2Dat (11.4)
where Da is the diffusion coefficient for carbon.

Example 11.1 The surface of an AISI 1045 steel cam is to be heat treated using a 2.5 kW CO2
laser to enhance the wear resistance. The defocused beam diameter is 5 mm, and the scan rate is set
at 10 mm/s. Determine the spacing of the pearlite plates that will enable the pearlite colonies to be
fully transformed to austenite under these conditions.
Assume:
1. The temperature is time-dependent.
2. The diffusion constant, D0, for the diffusion of carbon in α-Fe (ferrite) is 0.020 cm2/s = 2 ×
10−6 m2/s = 2 mm2/s = 2 × 106 μm2/s (Shewmon 1983, Table 2-1, p. 64).
3. The activation energy for diffusion, Qa, is 20.1 kcal/mol = 84.15 kJ/mol (Shewmon 1983,
Table 2-1, p. 64).
4. The reflection coefficient of the surface is 80%.
5. Ambient temperature is 25 ∘C.
Solution:
The peak temperature and thermal time constant that will be obtained for the given conditions need
to be determined. However, without additional information, we assume that t is indefinite, since we
need to use Eq. (11.5). Therefore to calculate Tp and 𝜏h, we use Eqs. (11.10) and (11.11) on the basis

11.1.4.2 Austenite Homogenization Austenite homogenization follows the transformation from
pearlite to austenite and is associated with the diffusion of carbon from the high carbon austenite
region (which transformed from pearlite) to the low carbon austenite region (which transformed
from ferrite, Figure 11.11). The extent of homogenization depends on temperature and time.❦

11.1.5 Nonferrous Alloys
Even though our discussion thus far has focused on phase transformation in steels, other materials
can also be subjected to laser heat treatment to improve their mechanical properties. The hardness
of some aluminum alloys, for example, can be increased by about 100% after laser treatment. The
principal process for increasing the strength of nonferrous alloys is precipitation hardening. This
requires the existence of a strong supersaturated solid solution at high cooling rates. Thus, it is only
possible in alloys in which the solubility of one element in the solid solution increases with increasing
temperature (Figure 11.12). There are two steps involved in the precipitation hardening process:
1. Solution treatment.
2. Aging.❦

Figure 11.12 Solution treatment.
11.1.5.1 Solution Treatment The material is heated into the portion of the phase diagram where
only a solid solution phase exists, say T1 (Figure 11.12), and allowed to stay until the solid solution
phase, 𝛼, is formed. It is then quenched to T2. The rapid cooling prevents the formation of the second
phase, 𝛽, and the alloy formed at this stage is supersaturated, and initially relatively soft.
11.1.5.2 Aging If the alloy is maintained at T2 for a while, nuclei of the second phase are formed
and begin to grow throughout the material, resulting in second phase particles. The formation of the
second phase particles impedes the motion of dislocations. That means more stress is required to
move the dislocations through them, and the strength of the material thus increases (Figure 11.13a).
The more particles are formed and grow, the greater the strength becomes (stage 1). Thus, a finer
distribution of second phase particles produces a stronger material. However, eventually the strength
reaches a maximum (stage 2) and a further stay at T2 only results in continued growth of the parti￾cles as smaller particles join together to form larger ones, and the spacing between them increases.
The strength then begins to decrease (stage 3). This is overaging.
The lower the aging temperature, T3, the longer it takes to reach the maximum strength, but
the greater is the maximum strength since the second phase is more finely dispersed at the lower
temperatures due to the increased nucleation rate (Figure 11.13b,c). If T3 is low enough, the second
phase may not form at all.
Nonferrous alloys may also be hardened by laser treatment if at least one of the following condi￾tions is satisfied:
1. Formation of a characteristic finely-divided structure in the hardening zone.
2. Formation of metastable phases.
3. Dislocation density increase.
11.1.6 Hardness Variation
The variation of hardness and ductility for a surface-hardened workpiece is illustrated in
Figure 11.14. The top view (Figure 11.14a) illustrates hardened regions where the hardness is
higher and the ductility lower than the original material. As the cross-sectional profile of the
surface-hardened region shows (Figure 11.14b), hardness is a maximum at the surface and gradually❦

decreases with depth from the surface. This is the trend observed for macrohardness measurements
that may be obtained using a Vickers indentor. However, microhardness measurement of individual
martensitic regions for pre-eutectoid steels shows the martensite hardness to increase with distance
below the surface. This is because the carbon content of the individual martensite formed is
highest when the peak temperature experienced is just above the A1 (eutectoid) temperature of the
iron-carbon phase diagram (Appendix 11.B). The A1 temperature is achieved at a distance farther
away from the heat source. At this temperature, the carbon content of the austenite that eventually
transforms into martensite is about 0.8%, which is higher than that of the original steel. Also, at
higher peak temperatures, carbon is able to diffuse faster outward into the surrounding low carbon
matrix. This reduces the local carbon concentration. Now since the hardness of martensite decreases
with decreasing carbon content, the hardness of the individual martensitic regions is lower in
the area where the peak temperatures are highest. On the contrary, more martensite is formed in the
region where the peak temperatures are highest. Thus, the overall hardness in this region is higher❦
❦ ❦
❦
LASER SURFACE HEAT TREATMENT 411
than that in the lower temperature region, since the overall hardness of a material increases with the
amount of the harder material.
The drop in hardness observed next to the hardened region is the part of the substrate which is
heated to a high enough temperature for grain growth to occur, but where the cooling rate is not high
enough to result in martensite formation.
11.1.7 Residual Stresses
Residual stresses are normally induced in the surface layers of a part that is subjected to surface
modification. The key mechanisms responsible for the residual stresses are the following:
1. Thermal expansion and contraction associated with the process (Chapter 7).
2. Phase transformation, as occurs during austenite to martensite transformation. The second
mechanism is due to an increase in volume as austenite transforms to martensite, resulting in
compressive stresses. These compressive residual stresses improve the fatigue life of the part.
The variation of transverse stresses across the laser track for a single scan laser heat treatment is
shown in Figure 11.15, indicating tensile transverse stresses within the laser track, with balancing
compressive stresses in the heat-affected zone outside the track.
11.1.8 Semiconductors
Polycrystalline silicon that is deposited on a dielectric substrate such as glass is useful for thin film
transistors (TFTs), which are used in liquid-crystal display (LCD) technology, and also for thin
film solar cells. The solar cells are more efficient when the grain size is larger than the film thickness.
The electrical properties of the TFT also depend on the grain structure (size and texture) of the
polycrystalline silicon. Better electrical properties are obtained when the silicon has a large grain
structure. Such large grain structure can be achieved by crystallizing a layer of amorphous silicon
with a laser. Thickness of the amorphous silicon film may be about 150 nm and is normally deposited
by chemical vapor deposition.
Pulsed lasers have an advantage in being used for crystallizing the silicon layer, as opposed to
furnace hearting, since it is possible to control the beam parameters to avoid cracking or melting the

glass substrate. The use of excimer lasers is well established, but the low pulse repetition rate of about
1 kHz limits the scanning speed, making the process slow. Nd:YVO4 lasers with pulse repetition rates
up to 100 kHz result in significant improvements in the crystallization rate with similar enhancements
in the electrical properties. These are typically laser diode pumped, and the wavelength frequency
doubled to 0.532 μm, and typical processing parameters would involve a pulse energy of about 40 μJ
and a scanning speed of 10 mm/s.
11.1.9 Polymers
The characteristics of polymer surfaces can be changed with appropriate treatment using a laser.
For example, surfaces that repel water can become hydrophilic, as demonstrated by a reduced con￾tact angle, after laser treatment using a linearly polarized KrF or ArF excimer laser. In some cases,
electrical conductivity is also improved. This is especially the case with thermostable polymers such
as polyimides with high glass transition temperature. The surface texture that is created can also
affect characteristics in areas such as tribology, optics, and adhesion.
Nanostructures have also been created on polymer surfaces using pulsed Nd:YAG lasers that
have the advantage that they do not require additional polarization. Such structures facilitate the
fabrication of fine gratings and quantum devices. Periodic linear structures are produced after a few
hundred pulses, when a frequency quadrupled (fourth harmonic) Nd:YAG laser output of wavelength
0.266 μm is introduced on the surface of a polymer such as polyimide. Typical process parameters
would be a pulse repetition rate of 10 Hz, pulse duration of 5 ns, and fluence of 3–5 mJ/cm2, which is
below the polymer’s ablation threshold. The period, Λ, of the linear structure that results is given by
Λ = 𝜆
n − sin 𝜃
where 𝜆 is the laser wavelength, n is the material refractive index, and 𝜃 is the angle of incidence of
the laser beam. The linear structure is the result of a periodic electromagnetic field which is created
by the interference of a surface scattered radiation and the incident beam. The ripple direction is
parallel to the plane of polarization of the laser beam.
A typical width of the lines would be about 100 nm, with a depth of 500 nm. Continued exposure
of the polymer surface to the laser pulses will result in conversion of the linear structure to a dot
pattern after about 8000 pulses. For some polymers, such as the polystyrene family, the presence of
oxygen (processing in air) is necessary for the surface pattern to be created.
11.1.10 Advantages and Disadvantages of Laser Surface Treatment
11.1.10.1 Advantages The primary advantages of laser surface heat treatment include the
following:
1. Rapid Heating and Cooling: This enables steels of lower hardenability to be heat treated.
Thus, it is often suitable for components that are difficult to harden using conventional methods
such as flame and induction hardening.
2. The resulting heat-affected zone is minimal, compared to that associated with flame and induc￾tion hardening.
3. Minimal distortion due to low heat input. This eliminates post-hardening machining and asso￾ciated cost.
4. Localized heat input enables only desirable regions to be heat treated. Other regions are thus
essentially unaffected. It also minimizes the total heat input to the part. Thus, less energy is
used.❦
❦ ❦
❦
LASER SURFACE MELTING 413
5. Ease of processing complex shapes due to the ability to scan the beam over the part.
6. More uniform case hardness.
7. No external quenching is necessary since the process often involves self-quenching.
8. Minimization of fumes and dirt that results from heating and quenching.
9. The short cycle time results in relatively fine grain structure. This enables higher strength and
good fatigue resistance to be achieved.
11.1.10.2 Disadvantages
1. Due to the short interaction times, coarse structures (or alloys that require long soaking times
for heat treatment) tend to be difficult to laser heat treat. These include coarse pearlite, blocky
ferrite, and steels that contain spheroidal carbides and cast irons that consist primarily of
graphite without any pearlite. The austenite may not be completely homogenized in such
materials, and thus soft spots may occur in the hardened zone.
2. High capital cost of the laser.
3. The need for sufficient mass for self-quenching.
11.2 LASER SURFACE MELTING
Steels with widely dispersed carbide or graphite (mainly low carbon steels) are generally difficult to
harden by solid-state transformation. These are more easily hardened by melting and solidification,
since the diffusion rate of carbon is much higher in the molten state.
The localized nature of a laser as an energy source makes it effective for melting a thin surface
layer of metal to control its microstructure.
Laser surface melting of metals (also known as skin melting or glazing) involves melting of a thin
surface layer that subsequently undergoes rapid solidification as a result of self-quenching, resulting
in alterations in the local microstructure. The process is similar to autogenous (no filler metal added)
conduction mode laser welding. However, in this case, lower power densities are used at higher
traverse speeds to ensure that only a thin layer of the substrate is melted, and that the resulting cool￾ing rates are high enough to induce rapid solidification. Thus, the principles of rapid solidification
discussed in Section 6.3 apply to this process.
The microstructural changes may be accompanied by changes in properties such as hardness,
corrosion resistance, and wear resistance. The surface melting process results in four distinct zones
in the material (Figure 5.1):
1. Fusion zone.
2. Zone of partial melting.
3. Heat-affected zone.
4. Base material.
When the process involves multiple scanning, there also exists an overlapping zone when the
individual beam scans are made to overlap.
The microstructure of the fusion zone depends on the alloy. For example, for AISI 4340 steel, it
may consist of a fine cellular structure containing martensite, while for AISI 4140, it may consist
primarily of fine grained martensite with traces of austenite. The microhardness of the fusion zone is
generally higher than that of the overlapping zone, whose hardness is in turn higher than that of the❦
❦ ❦
❦
414 LASER SURFACE MODIFICATION
base material. Unlike the case of surface heat treatment (where no melting occurs), the microstructure
of both the fusion and overlapping regions is independent of the thermal history of a steel, while that
of the HAZ depends on the original matrix. The microstructure of the HAZ may consist of coarse
martensite, since it is austenitized during heating, and then quenched.
In the fusion zone, increasing the scanning speed or decreasing the laser power results in a finer
microstructure and thus higher microhardness. However, increasing the laser power increases the
melt depth. For a single scan treatment, the microhardness is highest at the center of the path and for
overlapping treatments reduces towards the overlap zone. Reducing the amount of overlap improves
the overall microhardness.
11.3 LASER DIRECT METAL DEPOSITION
Laser deposition is a form of cladding, hardfacing, or coating technique for enhancing the corrosion
and/or wear resistance of a part. This process involves using a laser beam to melt a very thin sur￾face of a substrate. The molten substrate mixes with melted clad alloy which is usually applied as
powder (Figure 11.16) or wire feedstock to form a metallurgical bond. As in the other cases of laser
surface modification, the rapid solidification and/or quench rates associated with the process enable
either amorphous or nonequilibrium crystalline phases to be formed. The amorphous phases enable
material properties to be obtained that cannot be obtained under equilibrium cooling. Laser cladding
applications include engine valve components, boiler firewall, and turbine blades. It also serves as
an effective tool for repairing components.
Potential problems that may arise during cladding include the following:
1. Porosity that may result from moisture and the entrapment of shielding gas.
2. Thermal stresses that may cause cracking and are due to the following factors:
(a) Difference between the melting points of the clad layer and substrate.
(b) Different coefficients of thermal expansion of the clad layer and substrate.
(c) Volume changes associated with phase changes that occur as the material cools down.
11.3.1 Processing Parameters
As an illustration, typical processing parameters for cladding of an Mg–Al alloy, for example, by
powder feeding are listed in Table 11.3.
For Mg–Al alloys, the use of nitrogen shielding gas may result in the greatest depth of the alloyed
region. Addition of helium or argon reduces the melt depth, but increases the hardness level by as
much as 100%. Inert gas mixtures without any nitrogen result in the hardest cladding, with minimal
porosity or cracking.
The clad tracks that are formed in laser deposition tend to be discontinuous with a high
height-to-width (aspect) ratio at relatively low speeds, becoming shallower with a reducing aspect
ratio as speed increases (Figure 11.17). Thus at very high speeds, about 30 mm/s, the cladding
obtained is relatively thin, and the dilution (Section 11.3.3) increases accordingly.
11.3.2 Methods for Depositing the Material
Material may be deposited in a number of ways. These include the following:
1. Preplaced loose powder bed.
2. Presprayed surfacing powder.
3. Prepositioned chip or rod.❦

11.3.2.1 Preplaced Powder With this method (Figure 11.18), the powder, either in loose form or
in a slurry mixture, is placed on the substrate, and the laser beam is directed to melt through the
powder and fuse it to the substrate. The major drawbacks of this method are listed here.
1. It is limited to flat beds. Generally, complex geometries are difficult to clad by this approach.
2. Shielding gas usage is difficult, as it tends to blow away the powder.❦

3. Evaporation or decomposition of the binder may lead to porosity.
4. Control of the molten zone between the clad layer and substrate is difficult. Variations in bed
depth may either cause excessive dilution (small depth) or absence of metallurgical bonding
(greater depth).
5. It requires a higher specific energy to melt through a specified bed depth than that for a powder
feed system.
However, it has the advantage that it is very simple to use and is also relatively low cost.
11.3.2.2 Presprayed Surfacing Powder This method involves first spraying surfacing powder on
the substrate by thermal or plasma spraying, and subsequently consolidating by laser melting. The
additional processing step involved is a drawback of the process.
11.3.2.3 Prepositioned Chip A chip that is made to the shape of the component’s surface is placed
on the substrate and consolidated by laser melting to form a metallurgical bond. The setback of this
approach is also the extra processing step.
11.3.2.4 Wire Feed This process is similar to arc or gas welding. In this case, the wire is fed into a
laser generated melt zone at the substrate. It involves a single step, and complex shapes can be clad.
11.3.2.5 Powder Feeding The setup for this method consists of the laser, powder delivery sys￾tem, and shielding gas (Figure 11.16). It involves continuously feeding the alloy powder through a
nozzle that is positioned such that the powder feeds directly into the molten portion of the substrate.
Different powder compositions can be fed in, enabling online variations in the alloy composition to
be achieved.
The powder may be dispensed in one of two ways:
1. Gravity feeding, where the powder is delivered directly in front of the molten zone, and in
that respect, resembles a preplaced powder bed. It may lead to segregation of widely different
density particles.❦
❦ ❦
❦
418 LASER SURFACE MODIFICATION
2. Using a pneumatic screw feed system with a small amount of argon gas (about 1 l/min) flowing
in the tube to aid powder flow and directional placement. Control of the powder flow rate into
the molten zone is determined by the following factors:
(a) Material flow characteristics.
(b) Powder preparation, for example, preheat.
(c) Powder injection angle.
(d) Shielding gas characteristics.
To reduce oxidation and/or elemental loss, the process may be carried out in a slightly pressurized
inert enclosure, with the laser beam being introduced through a NaCl window.
Since the cladding process involves addition of one or more materials to the substrate, this results
in dilution or change in chemical composition of portions of the base metal.
11.3.3 Dilution
Dilution of the clad material can be defined either as the ratio of the area of substrate melted to the
total melted zone or in terms of the chemical composition difference between the starting powder
and the solidified clad layer (Figure 11.19). These may be expressed as
%Area dilution = Melted substrate cross-sectional area
Clad region cross-sectional area + Melted substrate cross-sectional area
= (2)
(1)+(2) (11.15)
which is strictly applicable only to single track clads, and
%Chemical dilution = Cclad − Cpowder
Cpowder
(11.16)
where Cclad is the elemental composition of the clad at a position near the substrate/clad interface
and Cpowder is the elemental composition of the starting powder.

❦
LASER PHYSICAL VAPOR DEPOSITION (LPVD) 419
With increasing traverse speed, the area dilution tends to decrease to a minimum and then begin
to increase, while the chemical dilution remains constant. The chemical dilution is a measure of the
stoichiometry of the alloy formed by cladding, and thus is not expected to change significantly with
processing conditions once melting occurs. However, the area dilution is a measure of the amount
of substrate that melts, and thus is significanly influenced by the processing speed. A low value of
area dilution may be appropriate for say, a hard coating application where it is desired to have a hard
layer on the surface of the base material. On the other hand, where a different alloy composition is
desired, then a high value of the chemical composition would be desirable.
11.3.4 Advantages and Disadvantages of Laser Deposition
11.3.4.1 Advantages Laser deposition has the following advantages over other more traditional
methods:
1. Relatively low heat input, and thus narrow heat affected zone and reduced distortion, with
minimal machining being required.
2. Reduced alloy material loss.
3. Minimal clad dilution of base metal (less than 2%) enables the special properties of the clad
material to be maintained.
4. Flexibility and ease of automation.
5. Complete metallurgical bonding to the substrate, resulting in high integrity coating.
11.3.4.2 Disadvantages The primary disadvantages of laser deposition are as follows:
1. It is not the method of choice when the area to be hardened is relatively small.
2. It is more expensive than comparative processes that use plasma arc or gas tungsten arc heat
sources.
In general, laser deposition is an effective means of changing the microstructure and thus mechan￾ical properties of thin layers of a substrate where the surface area to be processed is large enough.
Other methods of treatment exist that do not involve melting of the substrate, for example, laser
physical vapor deposition and laser chemical vapor deposition. There are a number of other surface
modification techniques that do not involve the use of lasers. However, in the following Section 11.1,
we further discuss the laser physical vapor deposition technique.
11.4 LASER PHYSICAL VAPOR DEPOSITION (LPVD)
The principle of LPVD is illustrated in Figure 11.20. A CW laser beam is irradiated on a target in
a vacuum chamber. The target is placed on a traveling holder and inclined to the beam axis, while
the substrate is fixed and held parallel to the target. The target is moved at a preset speed, and the
substrate may be preheated. The laser beam vaporizes material from the target, which is deposited on
the substrate. As an illustration, typical key processing parameters would be as shown in Table 11.4.
The deposition rate increases with an increase in laser power, but decreases as the target–substrate
distance increases (Figure 11.21a). On the other hand, the resulting hardness decreases with an❦

increase in laser power and increases as the target–substrate distance increases (Figure 11.21b).
The hardness also increases with an increase in substrate temperature.
11.5 LASER SHOCK PEENING
Laser shock peening is a process that imparts compressive residual stresses on the surface of a mate￾rial. It is used primarily for increasing fatigue life, corrosion resistance, and improving resistance to
cracking since the compressive stresses retard the growth of cracks initiated on the surface.
It is normally done using a thermoprotective coating or absorbing layer of black paint or tape
applied to the surface of the part (Figure 11.22). The coating also serves to protect the substrate
from the thermal effects of the ablation and further enhances the magnitude of the resulting shock
wave pressure by forming a plasma. A layer of dielectric material which is transparent to the laser
beam, usually glass or water, is placed on top of the absorbing layer. The laser beam instantly vapor￾izes the absorbing layer and produces plasma that expands rapidly, creating very high pressures❦

at the interface, as a result of the recoil momentum of the ablated material. The pressure results
in shock waves which are transmitted throughout the material, and induces compressive stresses in
the material. Plastic deformation occurs when the compressive stress exceeds the Hugoniot elastic
limit (HEL). With the plasma confined by the layer of dielectric material, pressures of the order of
gigapascals are obtained. Pressures generated in the confined mode are typically an order of mag￾nitude greater than in direct ablation, for similar laser irradiances. Also, using quartz as the overlay
material results in much higher pressures than when water is used, since the acoustic impedance of
water is about 10% that of quartz. However, water is more flexible to use and thus suited for complex
geometries. Furthermore, its threshold for dielectric breakdown is higher than that of quartz.
Use of the thermoprotective coating avoids melting of the metallic surface during the irradia￾tion. Without the coating, the melting that results would create tensile residual stresses. The process
requires a laser system with high average power and large pulse energy for a high throughput. This is
normally achieved with a Q-switched laser operating in the near infrared wavelength range which is
effectively transmitted by the water or glass overlay material, for example a Nd:Glass or Nd:YAG
laser with a wavelength of 1.06 μm. Even though using a shorter wavelength laser, for example
by frequency doubling to 0.53 μm, would increase the shock wave generation due to enhanced
photon–metal interaction, this is not recommended for a number of reasons. The process of frequency
doubling can reduce the pulse energy by as much as 50%. Furthermore, at the shorter wavelength,
the threshold for dielectric breakdown of the surrounding atmosphere is reduced, resulting in more
plasma being generated above the workpiece surface, and that absorbs part of the incoming radiation
(inverse bremsstrahlung absorption). Typical process parameters are listed in Table 11.5.
Laser beams with a circular profile are often used for this process, but have the disadvantage that
the resulting stress distribution is not uniform. Circular profiles produce a stress dip in the center,
which can be a preferred location for crack initiation. For these reasons, a square profile is preferable.
The percent of cold work and compressive residual stress increase as the number of pulses increases,
with the magnitude of the compressive stress being proportional to the number of pulses per spot.
The disadvantages of laser peening are that it is a relatively slow process; it can also be quite expen￾sive, as layers of absorbing material must be applied before each peening application. However, it
is becoming a more viable alternative to shot peening as new developments in laser systems allow
faster processing.
Laser shock peening has traditionally been done using nanosecond pulse lasers. However,
recent work has demonstrated the potential for using femtosecond pulse lasers. As an illustration,
a 2024-T351 aluminum alloy that was shock peened using a 120 fs laser of 800 nm wavelength
without any absorbing or confining layer (dry laser peening) resulted in a much lower surface
roughness than that performed using a nanosecond laser. Furthermore, compressive residual stresses
were measured for depths up to 100 μm, along with hardness values that were about twice those of

the unpeened aluminum alloy. In addition, dry laser peening resulted in significant improvements
in fatigue life compared to that of the base material. One advantage with dry laser peening is that it
eliminates the time and cost associated with coating application and removal.
11.5.1 Background Analysis
The pressure generated at the interface can be analyzed using the simplified set-up shown in
Figure 11.23, considering glass to be the dielectric material. The pressure results in shock waves
in both the workpiece and the glass overlay and causes the interface walls to be displaced with
velocities u1 and u2.
If the thickness of the interface at time t is Lp(t), then we have
Lp(t) = ∫
t
0
[u1(t) + u2(t)]dt (11.17)
The velocities, ui (i =1, 2), are related to the pressure P by
P = 𝜌iUiui = Ziui (11.18)
where i = 1, 2 is the material 1 or 2, Ui is the shock velocity (m/s), Zi is the shock impedance
(g/cm2/s), and 𝜌i is the density (kg/m3).
For the situation where the two materials are solids, we can assume that their shockwave
impedances, Zi = 𝜌iUi, are constant. Then from Eqs. (11.17) and (11.18), we get

dt = 2

The laser energy that is absorbed increases the internal energy per unit volume, Qe, of the interface
plasma and also does work to open up the interface. If the laser intensity is I(t), then the energy per
unit surface area deposited over the time interval dt is I(t) dt. Let the plasma thickness increase by
dLp during this time interval. The increase in internal energy is then given by d[Qe(t)Lp] (Joules per
unit area), and the work done per unit area by the forces resulting from the pressure is P(t)⋅dLp. Thus,

We now make the following assumptions:
1. The fraction, fE, of the internal energy, Qe(t), which represents the thermal energy, QT(t), is
constant. The balance, 1−fE, is used to ionize the gas. fE is typically ≈0.1–0.2.
2. The interface plasma obeys the ideal gas laws.

Further assume that the laser beam intensity, I(t) = I0 = constant, and that Lp(0) = 0. Then the

be shown, using Eq. (11.19) and neglecting the term P(t)

Under the high impact loading associated with laser shock peening, the material becomes plas￾tically deformed when the pressure (or compressive stress due to the pressure) reaches the HEL,

where Psw is the pressure due to the shock wave; 𝜆L and 𝜇L are the elastic Lame constants of the
workpiece; r is the radius of the impact; uel and upl are the respective elastic and plastic velocities of
the shock wave; and Δ𝜏p is the duration of the pressure pulse.
Increasing the number of laser pulses at a given location increases the depth of induced stresses.
Example 11.4 In shock peening the surface of an aluminum plate, the laser that is used generates a
pulse energy of 80 J at a pulse duration of 10 ns, and a beam diameter of 3 mm. If the plasma thickness
obtained at the end of the pulse is 40 μm, determine the interface pressure generated. Assume that
the pressure is invariant with time, that 15% of the internal energy is expended as thermal energy,
and that the pulse energy is uniform throughout the pulse duration.
Solution:
The plasma thickness is given by Eq. (11.24):

426 LASER SURFACE MODIFICATION
11.5.2 Thermal Relaxation at High Temperatures
Thermal relaxation is discussed separately since laser shock peening is often applied to products
that are used in high temperature environments such as turbine blades. At such temperatures, there
is a greater relaxation of the induced stresses and that may result in loss of some or all the benefits
associated with the peening process. However, stress relaxation tends to produce a more uniform
spatial stress distribution.
The cold working associated with shot peening tends to be quite severe, but yet confined to shallow
depths of about 75–250 μm. The severe deformation makes the material unstable, resulting in rapid
loss of the compressive residual stresses at relatively high temperatures.
The major mechanisms responsible for residual stress relaxation at high temperatures include the
following:
a. Creep-controlled rearrangement of dislocation network.
b. Annihilation of meta-stable defects.
c. Softening of the material.
The extent of relaxation increases with the amount of initial cold work induced, exposure tem￾perature, and time of exposure at the high temperature. Most of the relaxation occurs in the initial
stages, eventually leveling off. It is also highest at the surface where the cold work is most severe
and reduces with depth into the workpiece.
The relaxation process may be analyzed using a relationship that is based on the Zener–Wert–
Avrami model: 𝜎rs
𝜎0
= e−(Dt)
n
(11.29)
where 𝜎rs is the residual stress at time t, 𝜎0 is the initial stress before the start of heating, n is a
constant that depends on the dominant relaxation mechanism, and D is a coefficient that has an
Arrhenius temperature behavior:
D = D0e
−
( Qd
kBT
)
(11.30)
such that D0 is a constant, Qd is the activation energy for relaxation, kB is the Boltzmann constant,
and T is the absolute temperature.
On the contrary, the cold working induced by laser shock peening is relatively small compared
to that associated with shot peening, but penetrates much deeper below the surface (about 1–2 mm).
Thus, the residual stress relaxation that results after exposure to heat is much smaller for parts that
had been subjected to laser shock peening. For example, in the titanium alloy Ti6Al4V, very little
relaxation occurs and in Inconel 718, almost no relaxation is observed at temperatures up to 700 ∘C.
However, 50% relaxation occurs in 10 minutes for the same materials if they are subjected to shot
peening before heat treatment at 700 ∘C.
11.5.3 Advantages and Disadvantages of Laser Shock Peening
11.5.3.1 Advantages Laser shock peening has several advantages over traditional shot peening,
and these are listed as follows:
1. It produces compressive residual stresses that extend deeper into the material (over 2 mm) than
can be obtained with shot peening.
2. The compressive residual stresses are also produced with less cold work than with shot peen￾ing, allowing for less thermal relaxation of these stresses when the part is subjected to high
temperatures.❦
❦ ❦
❦
LASER TEXTURING 427
3. With conventional shot peening, the surface of the workpiece is dimpled, which can be unde￾sirable esthetically. Laser shock peening does not adversely affect the surface appearance or
quality.
4. Since the process is noncontact, it is suitable for complex geometries and areas that are difficult
to access, for example, notches and small fillets.
11.5.3.2 Disadvantages The major disadvantage of laser shock peening is that it currently
requires specially designed lasers for production runs, since it requires a laser system with high
average power and large pulse energy for a high throughput.
11.5.4 Applications
Laser shock peening has applications in the aerospace, automotive, nuclear, orthopedic, and power
industries. One application of the process has been in making the leading edge of fan blades resistant
to foreign object damage. Others include turbine blades for thermal power plants, bearing compo￾nents, gear shafts in the aerospace industry, and automotive components such as leaf springs.
11.6 LASER TEXTURING
Surface texturing is a means of modifying the geometric features of a surface to impart desired
properties and functionality to it. The properties may involve minimized surface reflectivity (light
trapping, which may, for example, result in the formation of black silicon by enhancing the absorp￾tivity of silicon in the visible spectrum), enhanced tribological characteristics, modified fluid flow
characteristics, and super wetting surfaces. There are different methods for texturing a surface. It can
be done by mechanical means, by chemical etching, with reactive ion etching, using photolithogra￾phy, or with lasers. Our focus in this section is the use of lasers for surface texturing.
Lasers have the advantage of being noncontact, making it easier to impart different geometric
features unto a surface. These features can be at the microscale or at the nanoscale. Creation of
nanofeatures is discussed under nanotechnology applications in Section 14.2. Here we focus on
applications that involve micromachining of specific geometries unto the surface. Two common
approaches involve scribing grooves or creating micropores to generate different patterns. In either
case, the quality of the surface generated is influenced by the laser processing parameters. Of par￾ticular importance is the pulse duration.
Pulse duration in the nanosecond range or more (typical of Nd:YAG lasers) is longer than the
electron–phonon thermal relaxation time (of the order of picoseconds). This is the time it takes to
transfer the energy absorbed by electrons to the lattice. Thus, the electrons and lattice are essentially
in thermal equilibrium at the end of a long pulse, and material removal then involves both melting and
vaporization, resulting in the formation of recast layers that affect the surface texture. The recast layer
(ripple) on the periphery of a micropore or along the edges of a groove is the result of outward flow
of molten metal (Figure 9.26). This can have significant influence on the surface texture generated
and thus the performance of the surface.
Figure 11.24 illustrates a typical micropore formed with an Nd:YAG laser of pulse duration in
the range 100 to 600 ns and peak power of 80 W on a flat 100Cr6 steel plate to improve tribological
performance of contact surfaces. The geometry of the micropore (depth, diameter, and ripple height)
is determined by the processing parameters such as beam mode, energy per pulse, and number of
pulses.
A pattern of grooves generated on a multicrystalline silicon wafer using an Nd:YAG laser to
enhance the conversion efficiency of solar cells is shown in Figure 11.25 and further demonstrates
the formation of a recast layer along the groove edges. This reduces the efficiency of the cells. Further
etching to remove the layer improves the efficiency, but then increases the cell reflectance.❦

As previously discussed in Section 9.3.1 under micromachining, ultrashort pulse beams have
a shorter duration than the electron–phonon thermal relaxation time. The material is thus directly
vaporized, with very little or no melting, resulting in cleaner micropores or grooves (Figure 9.26).
One such application of femtosecond lasers in surface texturing involves generating a surface geome￾try that enables conversion of boundary layer flow in the heated regions of aircraft and rocket engines
from laminar to turbulent flow to enhance cooling of the components. Using a 0.775 μm wavelength
femtosecond laser with 180 fs pulse duration and a focused beam size of 30 μm on the ultrafine pol￾ished surface of nickel-based superalloys, ripples with periodicity of the order of the laser wavelength
are obtained on the surface at low average power densities of about 0.33 W/cm2. Such ripples are gen￾erally referred to as laser-induced periodic surface structures (LIPSS) and result from interference

between the incident beam and surface polaritons, which generate a standing wave on the surface
that results in selective material ablation (see also Section 14.2.1). LIPSS can be either low spatial
frequency (LSFL) or high spatial frequency (HSFL). LSFLs are common with most materials, while
HSFLs tend to be associated with semiconductors and dielectrics, and have spatial periods that are
much smaller than the laser wavelength. LIPSS has been shown to result in friction reduction during
sliding.
At higher power densities (higher fluence and lower scanning speed), micropores that are aligned
in directions perpendicular to the ripples begin to form, resulting in higher surface roughness.
To achieve a given ablation depth at lower power densities (lower fluence and higher scanning
speed), more scans are needed than would be needed at higher power densities. However, a smaller
surface roughness is associated with the lower power density.
11.7 SUMMARY
In this chapter, we have learnt that laser surface modification is used to change either the surface
composition or microstructure of a material to give it certain desired properties, and the principal
techniques include the following:
Laser Surface Heat Treatment: This involves exposing the surface of a material to a thermal
cycle of rapid heating and cooling such that the surface layers are hardened, either through
martensitic transformation in the case of steels or through precipitation hardening, in the case
of nonferrous alloys. The process does not involve melting, and the transformations occur in
the solid state.
Laser Surface Melting (Skin Melting, or Glazing): In this technique, a thin surface layer of mate￾rial is melted with the laser beam and subsequently undergoes rapid solidification as a result
of self-quenching, resulting in alterations in the local microstructure. The process is similar to
autogenous (no filler metal added) conduction mode laser welding, but the resulting cooling
rates are high enough to induce rapid solidification. This process is especially suited to mate￾rials that are generally difficult to harden by solid-state transformation, for example, steels
with widely dispersed carbide or graphite (mainly low-carbon steels). The microstructural
changes may be accompanied by changes in properties such as hardness, corrosion resistance,
and wear resistance.
Laser Deposition (Cladding, Alloying, and Hard Coating): This involves applying a second
material to the surface and melting it with a laser beam either to alloy with a thin sur￾face layer of the base material or to bond to the surface. As in the other cases of laser
surface modification, the rapid solidification and/or quench rates associated with the process
enable either amorphous or nonequilibrium crystalline phases to be formed. The major
methods for applying the coating include preplaced loose powder bed; presprayed surfacing
powder; prepositioned chip or rod; wire or ribbon feed and powder feed.
Laser Physical Vapor Deposition: In this method, the second material is applied in vapor form,
and no melting takes place. A CW laser beam is irradiated on a target in a vacuum chamber
and vaporizes material from the target, which is deposited on the substrate, forming a thin
layer. The deposition rate increases with an increase in laser power, but decreases as the
target–substrate distance increases. The resulting hardness, on the other hand, decreases with
an increase in laser power and increases as the target–substrate distance increases.
Laser Shock Peening: This involves using the laser beam to vaporize a thin layer of thermo￾protective coating or absorbing layer of black paint or tape. This is placed beneath a layer
of dielectric material that is transparent to the laser beam, usually glass or water. The recoil
momentum of the ablated material results in high pressure that generates shock waves, induc￾ing compressive residual stresses on the surface of the material. It is used primarily for❦

increasing fatigue life and improving resistance to cracking. One issue with shock peened
parts is that stress relaxation occurs when subjected to relatively high temperatures.
Laser Surface Texturing: With this process, the geometry of the workpiece surface is modified
using a laser beam, to induce some desirable properties on the surface. Such properties may
include enhanced tribological, surface reflectivity, and fluid flow characteristics.

PROBLEMS
11.1. The surface of an AISI 1080 steel gear is to be heat treated using a 2.5 kW Nd:YAG laser.
The purpose is to enhance the wear resistance. The defocused beam diameter is 5 mm, and
the scan rate is set at 10 mm/s. Only a single pass of the laser beam will be used for the
heat treatment. Determine the time, t, required for the diffusion controlled transformation of
pearlite to austenite (pearlite dissolution) that results during the process.
Assume:
(1) The temperature is time-dependent
(2) The diffusion coefficient for carbon, Da =9 × 10−10 m2/s
(3) The diffusion constant, D0, for the diffusion of carbon in α-Fe (ferrite) is 0.020 cm2/s =
2 × 10−6 m2/s (Shewmon, Table 2-1, p. 64).
(4) The activation energy for diffusion, Qa, is 20.1 kcal/mol = 84.15 kJ/mol
(5) The reflection coefficient of the surface is 80%
(6) Ambient temperature is 25 ∘C.
11.2. For the conditions in Problem 11.1, determine the average size of the zone over which marten￾site can be formed.
11.3. For the conditions in Problem 11.1, determine the volume fraction of martensite that can be
formed. You may assume that the average austenite grain size is 200 μm.
11.4. A 7 kW CO2 laser is used to heat treat the surface of an AISI 1045 steel cam at a beam diameter
of 6 mm, and a scan rate of 25 mm/s. Determine the spacing of the pearlite plates that will
enable the pearlite colonies to be fully transformed to austenite under these conditions.
Assume:
(1) The temperature is time-dependent
(2) The diffusion constant, D0, for the diffusion of carbon in α-Fe (ferrite) is 0.020 cm2/s =
2 × 10−6 m2/s (Shewmon, Table 2-1, p. 64)
(3) The activation energy for diffusion, Qa, is 20.1 kcal/mol = 84.15 kJ/mol (Shewmon, Table
2-1, p. 64)
(4) The reflection coefficient of the surface is 85%
(5) Ambient temperature is 25 ∘C.
11.5. The leading edges of titanium turbine blades are to be shock peened using a laser that gener￾ates a pulse energy of 100 J with a pulse duration of 15 ns, and a beam diameter of 4 mm. If a
plasma of thickness 50 μm develops by the time the pulse is over, determine the pressure that
is generated at the interface between the substrate and the dielectric material. Assume that
the pressure is invariant with time; that 10% of the internal energy is expended as thermal
energy; and that the pulse energy is uniform throughout the pulse duration.
11.6. The interface impedance associated with a shock peening process is determined to be
0.6 × 106 g/cm2 s. If the laser being used is capable of generating a pulse energy of 95 J,
determine the pulse duration necessary for generating a plasma thickness of 60 μm at the
end of the pulse. What is the resulting interface pressure? Assume that the beam diameter is
5 mm; that the pressure is invariant with time; that 12.5% of the internal energy is expended
as thermal energy; and that the pulse energy is uniform throughout the pulse duration.
11.7. Explain how preheating affects the absorption of a material during laser surface heat
treatment.❦

11.8. An AISI 1060 steel is subjected to laser heat treatment. The working conditions are as follows:
Nd:YAG laser output power = 4.5 kW; defocused beam diameter = 5 mm; scan rate
(ux) = 8 mm/s; reflection coefficient of the surface = 90%; ambient temperature, T0 =25 ∘C;
diffusion constant, D0 =2 mm2/s; average austenite grain size, gs =200 μm; activation
energy for diffusion, Qa =20.1 kcal/mol.

(a) The spacing of the pearlite plates that will enable the pearlite colonies to be fully trans￾formed into austenite.
(b) The average size of the region where martensite can be formed.
(c) The volume fraction of martensite that can be formed.

12 Laser Forming
Forming traditionally has been the manufacturing process by which the size or shape of a part is
changed by the application of forces that produce stresses in the part that are greater than the yield
strength and less than the fracture strength of the material. It requires the use of dies, which determine
the final shape of the part. Simple examples of parts produced by this method are beverage containers,
angle brackets, or connecting rods. Thermomechanical forming, on the other hand, enables parts
(sheet metal, rod, pipe, or shell) to be formed without external forces and does not require the use
of dies. Laser forming is a type of thermomechanical forming and may be used to form an angle
bracket, for example, without using dies. More complex parts such as connecting rods that involve
bulk forming, can only be made by traditional forming methods. However, where laser forming can
be used, it also serves as a useful tool for rapid prototyping.
This chapter starts with a discussion on the basic principles of the laser-forming process. Typical
process parameters that may be used are then outlined. This is followed by a discussion on the various
mechanisms that underlie the process. The mechanics of the process are then discussed, followed by
the advantages and disadvantages of the process. Finally, possible applications are presented.
12.1 PRINCIPLE OF LASER FORMING
The technique for laser forming is very similar to that for laser surface heat treatment and involves
scanning a defocused beam over the surface of the sheet metal to be formed. Moving the laser
beam along a straight line without interruption causes the sheet to bend along the line of motion,
Figure 12.1.
The components of a laser forming system include the following:
1. The laser source with beam delivery system.
2. Motion table unit on which the workpiece is mounted, or robot for holding a fiber-optic system.
3. Cooling system where necessary.
4. Temperature monitoring system.
5. Shape monitoring system.
6. Computer control system.
The typical bend angle that is achieved in a single step is about 2∘, but may be as high as 10∘.
The total bend angle can be as high as 90∘ and higher by repetition of the process. The bend angle
obtained after the first scan is greater than the bend angle obtained for each of the subsequent
scans. However, after the first scan, the bend angle increases almost in proportion to the number
of scans. More complex shapes can be obtained by offsetting each track by a small amount. In this

case, the radius of the part produced depends, among other processing parameters, on the amount of
offset of each track. The smaller the offset, the smaller the radius.
The bend angle that is achieved for each step increases with a decrease in sheet thickness,
Figure 12.2, due to a resulting decrease in bending restraint. The bend angle per step, however,
decreases with a decrease in plate width. This is because with decreasing plate width, the volume
of material that acts as a heat sink reduces, and as a result, the temperature gradient associated with
the process decreases, resulting in a reduced compressive strain, and thus bend angle. On the other
hand, for high width-to-thickness ratios greater than 10, the bend angle is almost independent of the
plate width.
Processing parameters also affect the bend angle, with the angle increasing with increasing beam
power and reducing scan rate. However, excessive power or very low scan rates will form a molten
pool. This is undesirable since it will result in the surface coating being absorbed into the workpiece.
Surface coating is normally used to increase the absorption of the laser radiation by the workpiece
(Section 11.1.2.3). The method of cooling does not have very significant effect on the bend angle
when laser forming.❦

12.2 PROCESS PARAMETERS
Typical processing conditions are listed in Table 12.1.
Thicker materials are more effectively bent by increasing the power input. However, the beam
diameter needs to be increased accordingly to avoid melting the part. High scan rates are nor￾mally required for higher thermal conductivity materials such as aluminum alloys, while low ther￾mal conductivity materials such as titanium alloys require lower scan rates. For the low thermal
conductivity materials, if the scan rate is too high, only a thin surface layer will be heated. Efficiency
of the process can be increased by proper application of absorptive coatings to increase the beam
absorption, especially on metallic surfaces.
A major issue with the laser-forming process is the influence of the irradiation on the material’s
microstructure. Martensitic transformation, for example, may occur during laser forming of high
carbon or alloy steels, and intermetallic phases may be formed in some aluminum alloys, resulting
in corrosion.
12.3 LASER-FORMING MECHANISMS
The basic mechanism for laser forming is one of local deformation of the material as a result of ther￾mally induced residual stresses. This may result from one of three process mechanisms depending on

the temperature field that is generated; the beam shape; and the dimensions of the part to be formed.
The three mechanisms are
1. The temperature gradient mechanism.
2. The upsetting mechanism.
3. The buckling mechanism.
These are further discussed in the following sections.
12.3.1 Temperature Gradient Mechanism
The temperature gradient mechanism is illustrated in Figure 12.3. It evolves from processing condi￾tions such as rapid heating of the workpiece surface, coupled with a relatively low heat conduction
that generate very high temperature gradients in the thickness or z-direction, Figure 12.3a. Thermal
expansion of the heated surface results in initial bending of the sheet away from the heat source, or
toward the cold side of the workpiece during heating. This is often referred to as counterbending, and
the bend angle at this stage is very small, ≈ 0.05∘. As the heated surface tries to expand, however, the
constraint of the surrounding material, which is at a lower temperature, restricts its free expansion.
This results in compressive thermal stresses that induce plastic compressive strain in the heated layer,
Figure 12.3b. Plastic strains are induced since the yield strength of the material is lower at higher
temperatures. With increasing ratio of plastic to elastic strain, the amount of final bend angle that
results increases. Thus ideally, it is desirable to minimize the elastic strain by inducing very high
temperatures in the top surface layers, where the flow stress is very low.
On cooling, the heated surface layer contracts more than the lower layers that are not heated as
much as the surface layers, resulting in bending of the sheet toward the heat source, Figure 12.3c.
Figure 12.4 illustrates a shape that is produced by the temperature gradient mechanism.
In the simplest case, a sheet of metal may be bent along a straight line. Repeating the process
increases the bend angle, 𝜃b. During the bending process, the sheet thickness increases in the region
along the bend as a result of the compressive strain. The temperature gradient mechanism is sig￾nificant for relatively thick sheets. The ratio of the heated area diameter to the sheet thickness is
relatively low, of the order of 1. It will not be effective for relatively thin materials of high ther￾mal conductivity, since the resulting temperature gradient will then not be adequate to produce any
effective bending.

12.3.2 Buckling Mechanism
The buckling mechanism occurs in relatively thin sheets, where the ratio of the diameter of the
heated area to the sheet thickness is relatively high, of the order of 10. The temperature gradient that
arises in the thickness direction is then relatively small, so the material is heated almost uniformly
through its thickness. The heated region tends to expand. However, this expansion is hindered by the
unheated surrounding material. The restraint results in thermal compressive stresses being developed
in the sheet, which for very thin sheets, may lead to buckling when a critical stress value is reached,
Figure 12.5. Buckling is more likely to occur when the sheet is relatively thin. Otherwise, the critical
load for buckling will not be reached.
Bending of material close to the center of the heat source occurs plastically due to the high tem￾peratures in that region, while farther away, close to the root of the buckle, the material is subjected
to elastic bending as a result of the lower temperatures in that region. If the heat source traverses
the entire length of the sheet, then no restraining forces exist to hold the elastically bent portion in
place during cooling. Thus, elastic recovery occurs at the root, while the center remains bent, result￾ing in the sheet being bent along the centerline. The direction of the bending that results from the
buckling mechanism is unpredictable. It could either be toward or away from the heat source. This
is because it is influenced by a number of factors such as the boundary conditions, the precurvature
(or pre-bending) of the sheet, residual stresses, and external forces. However, it has been observed
that at relatively high scan rates, say 15 mm/s (depending on the processing conditions), bending
is always toward the laser beam. It only becomes unpredictable at lower speeds. Bending by the
buckling mechanism does not increase the sheet thickness at the bend.
12.3.3 Upsetting Mechanism
The upsetting mechanism evolves when uniform heating of a localized zone is achieved through
the thickness of the sheet, Figure 12.6a,b. Thus, the process parameters may be similar to those
of the buckling mechanism, except for the diameter of the heat source area, which is relatively small.
As a result of the near homogeneous heating of the sheet in the localized zone and prevention of❦

thermal expansion by the surrounding material, the sheet is subjected to near uniform compressive
strain through its thickness, Figure 12.6c. During cooling, the heated region contracts, resulting in
corresponding deformation of the sheet. This mechanism enables shapes that are similar to deep
drawn parts to be produced, Figure 12.7.
12.3.4 Summary of the Forming Mechanisms
One common feature of all three mechanisms is the generation of strains by thermal stresses. For the
temperature gradient and upsetting mechanisms, bending results primarily from plastic strains that❦

evolve during heating. Since elastic strains are reversible, their presence tend to reduce the bend
angle, and are thus detrimental to the process. On the other hand, elastic strains are the driving force
for forming in the case of the buckling mechanism.
The forming mechanisms are further summarized in Table 12.2.
12.4 PROCESS ANALYSIS
The laser forming process is a coupled problem that involves four basic concepts:
1. Analysis of the temperature field. This is essentially a three-dimensional conduction heat
transfer problem involving a moving heat source. Approximate use may be made of the
quasi-stationary solution discussed in Chapter 4. For a more accurate analysis, however, the
time-dependent problem incorporating temperature-dependent material properties has to be
solved using numerical methods, with the appropriate boundary conditions.
2. Analysis of the plastic strains using the appropriate constitutive laws, incorporating
temperature-dependent thermal expansion coefficient, elastic modulus, and flow stress.❦

This would also involve a suitable yield criterion and restraint due to the geometry of the
structure.
3. Analysis of the curvature during cooling due to the difference in plastic strains in the thickness
direction. This would involve consideration of force and moment equilibrium, strain harden￾ing, and flow stress.
4. Determination of the bend angle as an integral of the curvature that evolves with time.
In the remainder of this section, an approximate method is discussed. This provides some basic
results that enable reasonable deductions to be made on the relationship between the process and
product variables.
For the temperature gradient method, consider the plate shown in Figure 12.8, and an associated
Cartesian coordinate system, y-z, with origin O directly below the centerline of the laser beam and
halfway between the top and bottom surfaces. Assume that the sheet is made up of two layers in the
heated zone of half length, lh, and a single layer for y>lh. Further assume that the plate width is
relatively large compared to its thickness.
Let the centers of the two layers be located at z1 and z2. Then
z1 − z2 = h
2 (12.1)
where h is the thickness of the original sheet. For this simple case, the bend angle 𝜃b will be given
by the geometry and difference in strains between the upper (𝜀1) and lower (𝜀2) layers:
𝜃b
2 = lh(𝜀2 − 𝜀1)

where 𝜃b/2 is the half bend angle that is based on the plate symmetry.❦

PROCESS ANALYSIS 445
Let the lower layer be heated to a homogeneous temperature of Tl and the upper layer to a homo￾geneous temperature of Tu = Tl + ΔT. During the heating phase, the upper layer will be subjected to
compressive forces, while the lower layer is subjected to tensile forces. The strain, 𝜀1, to which the
upper layer is subjected will be a superposition of the strains due to the induced force, F, moment,
M, and thermal expansion:
𝜀1 = F
Em1A1
− M1
(EmIm)1
z1 + 𝛽lΔT (12.3)
where A is the cross-sectional area (m2), Em is the elastic modulus (N/m2), Im is the second moment
of area (m4), M is the moment due to the forces (N m), F is the force acting on each layer (N), 𝛽l is the
linear coefficient of thermal expansion (/K), and ΔT is the temperature rise of the upper layer relative
to the lower layer (K). The subscripts 1 and 2 indicate the upper and lower layers, respectively.
This analysis is based on the assumption that the thermal expansion of the upper layer is entirely
converted into compressive plastic strain. The assumption neglects the temperature dependence of
the yield stress, as well as the reversed straining during cooling. This is reasonable since at high
temperatures, the yield stress of the material is relatively low.
As the sheet cools, conduction of heat into the lower layer results in a tendency for it to expand.
This creates compressive stresses in this layer and that reduces the amount of tensile stress that
develops in the upper layer. Thus, there is no cancellation of the compressive strain in the lower
layer. The conversion of thermal expansion into plastic compression then results in
𝜀1 = F

case where the thicknesses of the upper and lower layers are different, then we have

and
A2 = b(h − h1) (12.11)
The bend angle then becomes
𝜃b = 12𝛽lΔTmlhh1(h − h1)

An approximate expression for estimating the bend angle that results for each pass of the laser
beam during laser forming has been derived in this section. The analysis is based on the temperature
gradient mechanism. Similar expressions may be obtained for the other mechanisms. However,
only one approach is presented since they are all approximates. The interested reader is referred
to (Vollertsen, 1994a, b). More exact determination of the deformed shape will require setting
up the appropriate governing equations for both the heat flow and deformation and solving them
numerically.

thickness 4.5 mm, width 200 mm, and length 600 mm. The beam radius is 4 mm, and scanning is
done at a rate of 40 mm/s along the width of the sheet metal. For a single scan, determine
1. The bend angle, 𝜃b.
2. The induced force, F.
3. The bending moment, M.
4. Strains, 𝜀1 and 𝜀2, in the upper and lower parts of the sheet, respectively.
Assume a surface reflection coefficient of 85%.
Solution:
From appendices 4D and 4E, the properties of the titanium plate are approximated as average density,

12.5 ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES
12.5.1 Advantages
The primary advantages of laser forming include
1. The noncontact nature of the process, which makes it independent of tool inaccuracies that
might result from wear and deflection, since no external forces are involved. It also makes the
process more flexible.
2. Ability to more accurately control the energy source and thus the forming process, compared
to flame bending and mechanical forming in general.
3. Forming of parts in confined or inaccessible locations by remote application.
4. Minimal heat-affected zone size or material degradation compared to flame bending where the
heat source is more diffuse.
5. Ability to form hard and brittle materials that are difficult to form by conventional methods.❦
❦ ❦
❦
448 LASER FORMING
12.5.2 Disadvantages
The major limitations are
1. The process is relatively slow compared to mechanical forming, by a factor of 5–20.
2. The high capital cost of the laser makes it more expensive than other forms of thermomechan￾ical forming such as flame bending.
3. The low efficiency of the laser results in high energy consumption.
4. Due to the potential reflection of the laser beam in various directions, special safety precautions
are essential.
12.6 APPLICATIONS
One area in which laser forming finds useful application is part straightening for mass production.
This involves using the laser beam to deform and thus straighten parts that become distorted at one
stage or another of their production. Due to the small size of the laser beam, and the ease with which
it can be controlled, laser forming is highly suited for forming small components, that is, micrometal
forming. Laser forming is also useful for forming of some automobile body components, even though
it may not be suitable for the high production rates essential for automobile components. On the other
hand, due to the low-volume requirements in forming of ship planks and production of aerospace
fuselage, laser forming is found to be useful for such applications. Also, due to the high flexibility of
the laser beam, it is well suited to the production of sheet metal components in space. Finally, laser
forming has been applied to metal foams in recent years. Metal foams have high strength to weight
ratios and are excellent for shock and noise absorption. They are therefore useful in the aerospace and
automotive industries. The temperature gradient mechanism is the primary mechanism encountered
with metal foams. One challenge with metal foams is localized melting of thin cell walls.
Since laser forming is slow relative to conventional forming, it is most economical for mainte￾nance work when there are no spare parts available. Also, since it does not require dies, laser forming
is suited for complex components in small-lot production and fabrication of individual parts for rapid
prototyping. This enables the performance of several variants of a design to be evaluated before
committing to full production equipment.
12.7 SUMMARY
Laser forming is a thermomechanical forming process, and thus enables sheet metal parts and pipes
to be formed without external forces. Scanning the laser beam along a straight line causes the sheet
metal to bend along the line of motion. More complex parts, however, can be formed by using a
more complex trajectory. The three principal process mechanisms are
1. The temperature gradient mechanism – which results from processing conditions that generate
very high-temperature gradients in the sheet metal.
2. The buckling mechanism – which is more common in relatively thin sheets, where the ratio of
the diameter of the heated area to the sheet thickness is relatively high of the order of 10.
3. The upsetting mechanism – which evolves when uniform heating of a localized zone is
achieved through the thickness of the sheet, using a heat source area that is relatively small.
Analysis shows that the bend angle achieved is directly proportional to the power input and
inversely proportional to the traverse velocity, as well as the inverse of the plate thickness squared.❦

PROBLEMS 449
Compared to traditional sheet metal forming, laser forming is relatively slow. However, it is non￾contact and is also suitable for applications such as rapid prototyping and micrometal forming. In
addition, compared to other thermomechanical forming processes, it is appropriate for situations
where very little microstructural damage to the base material can be sustained.

13 Additive Manufacturing
Additive manufacturing (AM), in its basic form, involves the generation of physical objects from
graphical computer data without the use of traditional tools. It is referred to in the literature by
several other names, for example, three-dimensional (3D) printing, rapid prototyping, stereolithog￾raphy, solid freeform manufacturing (fabrication), layer manufacturing, desktop manufacturing, and
direct digital manufacturing. In its early years, it was used mainly in design conceptualization to
facilitate engineering stress analysis and in making patterns and/or dies for manufacturing oper￾ations. However, the technology has improved to the point that it is now used extensively for end
products that include aerospace and automotive components. It is most suitable for custom products,
especially complex parts that are difficult to produce by traditional methods. In that regard, as
the technology evolves, it will eventually put a significant amount of manufacturing in the hands
of the consumer, taking us closer to the concept of personalized production.
We start this chapter with a general discussion on the basic concepts of additive manufacturing,
namely, computer-aided design (CAD), part building (processing), and post-processing. The major
types of additive manufacturing systems in current use (including non-laser-based systems) are
outlined under part building. In this respect, this chapter is different from other chapters, since it
also includes processes that are not laser-based. This is followed by a discussion on the main appli￾cations of additive manufacturing. A general overview of additive manufacturing is illustrated in
Figure 13.1, indicating some of the major processes currently in use.
Producing a part by additive manufacturing typically involves three main stages:
1. CAD.
2. Part building (processing).
3. Post-processing.
These basic steps are common among the different types of additive manufacturing techniques,
and will be discussed in that order. The specific additive manufacturing techniques will be discussed
under part building.
13.1 COMPUTER-AIDED DESIGN
The first stage of additive manufacturing involves either using an advanced 3D CAD system to
develop a computer model of the part to be produced or using reverse engineering to develop a
computer model from a part. The reverse engineering approach normally involves using, for example,
either a coordinate measuring machine (CMM) or a laser digitizer to trace out the part. However, a
reasonably good CAD model can now be obtained using the camera of an adapted cellular phone.

Figure 13.1 General overview of additive manufacturing systems.
For the computer model to be most useful, it needs to be represented as closed surfaces that define
an enclosed volume, thus ensuring that all horizontal cross sections are closed curves. A number
of techniques are available for representing computer models of objects, and they often make use of
geometric transformations. These techniques normally involve the creation of curves, surfaces, and
solids. The latter is generally referred to as solid modeling and is most suited for additive manufac￾turing applications. We briefly discuss curves, surfaces, and solids in that order.
13.1.1 Curve and Surface Design
Curve and surface design is important since all objects are bounded by curves and surfaces. They are
especially useful in the design of aircraft fuselage, automobile bodies, ship hulls, and sculptures.
Two common curve forms that are used in geometric modeling are splines and Bezier curves.
13.1.1.1 Splines A spline is essentially a smooth curve that is made to go through a set of points.
The simplest form is the cubic spline which can be used to fit a given set of data points, x0, x1, …, xn.
This is done by first fitting each contiguous pair of points, (xj, xj+1), with a cubic polynomial such that
the polynomial and its first and second derivatives are continuous on a set of intervals from x0 to xn.
A cubic polynomial can generally be expressed as:
y = f(x) = ∑
3
i=0
aixi (13.1)
Thus, the cubic spline function can be expressed in the following form:
Sj(x) = a0j + a1jx + a2jx2 + a3jx3, j = 0, 1, 2, … , n − 1 (13.2)❦

where Sj represents span j of the spline, with the following conditions:
S(xj) = f(xj), j = 0, 1, 2, … , n (13.3)

S′′
j+1(xj+1) = S′′
j (xj+1), j = 0, 1, 2, … , n − 2 (13.6)
The spline function is fully determined when the coefficients, aij, in Eq. (13.2) are determined.
This is done by applying Eqs. (13.3)–(13.6) to each span (Sj) of the spline, that is, between two
contiguous points, (xj, xj+1). Unfortunately, this will result in a system of n−1 equations with n+1
unknowns. The other two equations are obtained by considering the boundary conditions at the end
points of the spline, A and B (Figure 13.2). If these are given by
S′′(x0) = 0 (13.7a)
S′′(xn) = 0 (13.7b)
then the resulting spline is a natural spline. It is called a clamped spline if the boundary conditions
are specified at the ends as follows:
S′
(x0) = f ′
(x0)
S′
(xn) = f ′
(xn)
where f′
(x0) and f′
(xn) are specified.
Equation (13.2) defines a nonparametric cubic spline, and these have the property that they are
single-valued functions. This makes them unsuitable for multi-valued or closed curves, which are
often encountered in geometric modeling. This problem may be overcome with the use of parametric
splines. In parametric form, the variables x and y, Eq. (13.1), are expressed in terms of a third variable,
t, such that
x = x(t) (13.8a)
y = y(t) (13.8b)❦
❦ ❦

The cubic spline between two points is then expressed as:
S(t) = ∑
3
i=0
ait
i t ∈ [0, 1] (13.9)
And a point on the curve is given by:
S(t)=[x(t) y(t)] (13.10)
Again, the constants ai in Eq. (13.9) are obtained by considering the boundary conditions for each
spline and then also the overall boundary conditions for a natural or clamped spline.
13.1.1.2 Bezier Curves The major setback of cubic splines is that the curves are uniquely defined
within a given interval, and thus the shape cannot be controlled. Bezier curves permit control of
the curve’s shape. They are not constrained to pass through all the specified points. They only have
to pass through the end points. The data points define the vertices of a polygon which defines the
shape of the curve. The curve is tangent to the polygon at the end points and lies within the convex of
the polygon, as shown in Figure 13.3. The mathematical basis of the Bezier curve is derived from the
Bernstein polynomial, which is given, for a degree n, by:
Bn,i(t) = [

PiBn,i(t) t ∈ [0, 1] (13.12)
where S(t) denotes points on the curve, Pi indicates specified data points, t is selected increment, n
is degree of the Bezier polynomial, and n+1 is number of data points, giving n+1 vertices of the
polygon.

Pi =[xi yi zi] = coordinates of the data points.
13.1.1.3 Surface Representation A common approach used in constructing complex surfaces
is to concatenate several small patches, as shown in Figure 13.4a. Another type is the ruled sur￾face which contains two space parametric curves as opposite boundary curves. Linear interpolation
is then used to connect the two curves at several points, thereby defining a surface, as shown in
Figure 13.4b. A curve may also be rotated about an axis to generate a surface of revolution, as
shown in Figure 13.4c. A patch, for example, may be generated as a Bezier surface, which, for a
region bounded by four curves, is expressed by:
S(s, t) = ∑m

13.1.2 Solid Modeling
The curve generation methods discussed in Section 13.1.1 are useful for generating wireframe mod￾els of objects. The wireframe method has the advantage of simplicity and speed of implementation.❦
❦ ❦
❦
COMPUTER-AIDED DESIGN 459
Even though quite useful for visualizing certain types of objects, it has a number of disadvantages.
Since hidden lines cannot be removed, representation of complex objects using the wireframe method
can often be ambiguous. Furthermore, it does not incorporate information on the physical character￾istics of the object such as volume and mass. These drawbacks are eliminated with the use of solid
models. Two of the most common solid modeling methods are constructive solid geometry (CSG)
and boundary representation (BREP).
13.1.2.1 Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) The CSG technique builds 3D objects using
primitives, which are basic geometric shapes such as cubes, cylinders, cones, and spheres as
building blocks. Boolean operators such as union (∪), intersection (∩), and difference (−) are used
to combine them to create the final object. Figure 13.5 illustrates these operations using simple
geometric figures. The process of union combines primitives into a new object, while the process of
difference may be used to create a hole, for example. Intersection results in an object whose volume
is common to the initial primitives and is useful for checking interference between objects.
The objects formed at intermediate stages of the CSG product development are organized in an
orderly manner using a tree structure. A tree node represents an intermediate solid, which is obtained
by combining primitive and intermediate solids lower down in the tree’s hierarchy. This is illustrated
for a simple object in Figure 13.6.
One advantage of the CSG method is that it does not require as much memory storage as the
other solid modeling methods, even though the computational time for constructing the object may
be more. Also, the structure of the CSG tree generally parallels the sequence of operations that will
be required to manufacture the object. Thus, the designer is able to envisage the basic manufacturing
plan for the object.
13.1.2.2 Boundary Representation (BREP) With the BREP method, objects are defined by their
enclosing surfaces or boundaries, in terms of their faces, edges, and vertices. Boolean operations
may then be used to combine these entities to form the desired object. The end result is similar to a
wireframe object but can incorporate the object’s physical properties. The BREP technique is useful
for nonstandard shapes such as aircraft fuselage and automobile bodies and enables models to be
constructed faster. However, it requires more storage, but less computational time in constructing
the object.

A number of systems use a combination of these basic concepts. Common CAD systems that are
based on solid modeling include Solid Works, I-DEAS, Unigraphics II, Pro/Engineer, CATIA, and
Alias Designer. Generally, for convenience, and also to avoid potential errors downstream, all CAD
values are positive numbers. That means the part geometry must reside in the positive x, y, z octant.
13.1.3 Software Formats
The CAD model is next converted into a format required by the additive manufacturing (AM)
equipment. After the conversion, the file is then transmitted to the AM system’s computer. Two of
the formats used are the standard tessellation language (STL) and initial graphics exchange
specifications (IGES) formats.
13.1.3.1 The STL Format This was developed by 3D Systems and is the most commonly used
format. It approximates the outside surfaces of the model using polygons, usually, triangular facets.
For example, a rectangle is represented using two triangles, while a curved surface is approximated
using a number of triangles. Of course, for curved surfaces, the larger the number of triangles used,
the more accurate the representation. However, the file size or computation time then increases
accordingly, even though the subsequent build (processing) time is not significantly affected.
The desired accuracy is achieved by specifying a part resolution. This may be expressed either as a
maximum absolute deviation from the true surface (Figure 13.7a) or as a percentage of chord length
(Figure 13.7b) depending on the CAD system.
Each triangular facet is described by a set of X, Y, and Z coordinates for each of the three vertices
and a unit normal vector to indicate which side of the facet is inside the object. Since STL files do
not contain topological data, the polygonal approximation models used tend to exhibit a number of
errors including gaps and overlapping facets (resulting from numerical round-off errors).
The STL format has the advantage that it is simple, providing simple files for data transfer.
However, it has the disadvantage that its file is much larger than the original CAD file, since it carries
a lot of redundant information. In addition, it is susceptible to the geometric errors mentioned in the
preceding paragraph. Slicing of the files takes a relatively long time due to the large file sizes.❦

13.1.3.2 The IGES Format This is a standard used to exchange graphics information between
commercial CAD systems. It is capable of precisely representing CAD models and includes not only
geometry information but also topological information. The entities of points, lines, arcs, splines,
surfaces, and solid elements are provided. Ways of representing the regularized operations for union,
intersection, and difference are defined. IGES files, however, have the disadvantage that they often
contain redundant information that is not needed for AM systems. Furthermore, the algorithms for
slicing (Section 13.1.5) an IGES file are more complex than those for slicing an STL file. AM systems
often need support structures (Section 13.1.4). These cannot be created directly using the IGES
format.
13.1.4 Supports for Part Building
In additive manufacturing, supports are often needed to hold the part in place during the building
phase (Figure 13.8). They also allow for safe removal of the part from the platform and prevent
the recoater from colliding with the platform during the build stage. The supports are created in
the CAD system, but generally, the output files are separate from those of the part. Creating special
supports is essential for most of the liquid-based systems (Section 13.2.1), while for other systems
such as laminated object manufacturing, selective laser sintering (SLS), and binder jetting, no special
supports are necessary since the supports are inherent in the part buildup. Where needed, supports
may be generated by the engineer, CAD designer, or AM operator.
Sections for which supports are critical include areas that overhang preceding layers. If such a
section is not supported, it will tend to pull on the preceding layer as it shrinks, resulting in curl,
just as occurs in a bimetallic strip. Supports normally consist of combinations of thin webs, and they
need to overlap into the succeeding part layers by two to three layer thicknesses. An example of a
support system is shown in Figure 13.8.
13.1.5 Slicing
The additive manufacturing process generally involves building the part layer by layer, one on top
of the other. To facilitate this process, the CAD model is first sliced into cross sections (Figure 13.9).❦

The slice thickness selected depends on the accuracy desired, and it typically ranges from 0.12 to
0.50 mm. Variation of the build time with slice thickness is shown in Figure 13.10 for liquid-based
systems. For very thin layers, the build time decreases as layer thickness increases. However, at
relatively large layer thicknesses, the build time begins to increase with increasing layer thickness.
This is because the scan velocity decreases exponentially with increasing cure thickness.
The CAD stage is normally the most time-consuming part of the additive manufacturing process.
CAD systems that are used are normally those which have capability for other design applications
such as interference studies, stress analysis, FEM analysis, detail design and drafting, and planning
of manufacturing (including NC programming). This ensures that the same CAD package can be
used for other design applications. In the next section, we discuss the basic concepts associated with
part building.
13.2 PART BUILDING
There are several types of additive manufacturing methods, and these can be categorized by the
configuration of the light source used, the materials, the energy source, or the type of application.
Due to the significant changes in processing methodology associated with different materials, our
discussion on part building will be based on the type of material to be processed. In this regard, we
consider three main types of systems:
1. Liquid-based systems.
2. Powder-based systems.
3. Solid-based systems.❦

13.2.1 Liquid-Based Systems
Liquid-based additive manufacturing is normally referred to as stereolithography (SL) or vat
polymerization. The basic premise of the liquid-based systems involves building parts in a vat
of photocurable organic liquid resin (usually thermosets) by exposing it to laser radiation to
catalyze polymerization by inducing cross-linking of the photopolymer and thus solidify or cure it.
This involves linear absorption of the radiation by the organic molecules. The wavelength of the
laser radiation used is relatively short with high photon energy and mainly in the ultraviolet range.
Thus, the most commonly used lasers are He-Cd and argon ion lasers. At any one time, only a thin
layer (with depth equal to the slice thickness) of the resin is exposed to adequate enough radiation
for polymerization to occur. The principle is illustrated in Figure 13.11.
Before each layer is exposed to the laser beam, it needs to be levelled. This involves first checking
the resin’s z level (height) using a sensor. If the resin level falls outside a tolerance band, a plunger is
used to reposition the part in the z-direction until the desired level is achieved. Following levelling,
the platform (on which the part rests) is lowered (deep dipping). A few seconds (z-wait), typically
about 15–30 seconds, is then allowed for the resin to settle. The resin is now exposed to the laser
beam. When the layer has solidified, the part is lowered to permit the next layer of resin to be formed
over it. This is repeated until the part is completed. This is the general process, even though details
may vary from one manufacturer to another.
A major advantage of stereolithography is that it is more accurate than many of the other additive
manufacturing techniques listed. Even though almost all the processes enable internal hollow spaces
to be produced, stereolithography has the added advantage that it enables the hollow interior to be
completely drained. However, the process has the disadvantage that it is only useful for photosen￾sitive materials. Furthermore, the end product needs to have UV protective coating; otherwise, it
is subject to rapid degradation. Finally, it is a two-step process involving first the laser treatment,
followed by curing in an oven.❦

There are three basic ways in which the resin can be exposed to the laser beam:
1. One-dimensional (1D) scanning with
a. A single source (beam scanning).
b. Array of sources.
2. Two-dimensional (2D) source (parallel processing).
3. Two-photon polymerization.
These techniques for energy or material deposition are also applicable to other additive manufac￾turing methods and are now discussed in Sections 13.2.1.1–13.2.1.3.
13.2.1.1 Beam Scanning In beam scanning, the laser beam traces a path on the resin surface
that is determined by the shape to be formed at that level (Figure 13.11). Scanning can be done
using either a galvanometer, robot, or X–Y motion unit. First, the part borders for the given
layer cross-section are traced. The areas that will eventually become solid are then filled in or
hatched. This essentially involves scanning the interior. There are different hatching styles available
(Figure 13.12a,b). The scan lines of a given layer may be either perpendicular to each other or
a combination of horizontal and 60∘/120∘ lines which produce an internal pattern consisting of
equilateral triangles. Scan lines of contiguous slices (layers) may either overlap (Figure 13.12c) or
just touch each other (Figure 13.12d). They may also be in line (Figure 13.12d) or be staggered
(Figure 13.12e). Hatch spacings are typically about 0.25 mm. Hatching results in vertical columns
containing unsolidified resin, which is usually cured during post-processing. Staggering and
overlapping the scan lines has the advantage of eliminating microfissures that tend to occur with
the simple hatch without overlap or staggering.
Sample conditions for additive manufacturing by beam scanning are shown in Table 13.2.
For effective scanning, the depth to which the laser beam penetrates the liquid has to at least equal
the layer thickness. That defines the depth profile of the hatch lines shown in Figure 13.12. To esti￾mate the depth profile, let us consider the coordinate system as shown in Figure 13.13. The intensity❦

where I0 is the intensity of the incident beam (W/cm2) and Dp = 1/𝛼 = penetration depth (mm).

where I0(r) is the beam intensity at any radial position, r, on the surface (W/cm2), Ip is the peak
beam intensity (W/cm2), r is radial coordinate (μm), and 𝑤 is the radius at which beam intensity is
1/e2 × Ip or 0.14 × Ip. That means 86% of the total energy is contained in a spot of radius 𝑤 (μm).❦

Since the laser beam is considered to scan linearly in the x-direction, by integrating Eq. (13.17) over
the period of scanning (mathematically from x = −∞ to x = ∞, but in reality the time it takes the
laser beam to traverse its practical zone of influence), we get the exposure (energy per unit area) on

The most common liquid-based 1D systems include
1. Stereolithography by 3D Systems.
2. Stereography by EOS.
13.2.1.2 Parallel Processing With parallel processing, a mask is used to expose the entire area
of each layer to be solidified to the laser beam at the same time (Figure 13.14). A different mask is
used for each layer, and the exposed area of the mask corresponds to the area to be solidified at that
layer. This process is thus faster than the beam scanning process. It is also cheaper since the same
glass plate is used to generate each of the masks. Several techniques have been developed for mask￾ing, but one simple approach involves transferring the information for each layer to a glass plate by
electrostatically charging the areas to be masked, such that toner adheres to those areas. The regions
corresponding to the part to be produced for that layer are thus left transparent, enabling the ultra￾violet laser radiation to be transferred to the resin, polymerizing it in those regions. The unexposed
regions remain liquid. After each layer is exposed to the beam, the resin that is not polymerized
is sucked away and replaced by water soluble wax, which provides support for the part. Thus, no
supports are needed.
Parallel processing systems are produced by 3D Systems and EnvisionTEC.
13.2.1.3 Two-Photon Polymerization Two-photon polymerization (2PP) is a process that is
used to fabricate 3D micro-components that have nano-features, using photosensitive resins, and
is based on the two-photon absorption phenomenon. It enables 3D polymer-based objects to be
created within bulk resin material without resorting to layer-by-layer application of the resin, as is
done in conventional additive manufacturing.

The polymerization process is photoinitiated (as opposed to thermal initiation), and thus by con￾trolling the intensity of the beam, the generation of radicals can be controlled. As a result, the process
can be controlled with high precision. The resin used in photopolymerization is normally one that is
catalyzed by ultraviolet radiation, together with a photochemical initiator which absorbs the radia￾tion and becomes decomposed into free radicals. In 2PP, an infrared wavelength laser beam is used
so that instead of the single ultraviolet photon, two photons of near-infrared wavelength (each of
half the energy required) are simultaneously absorbed.
In addition to the photoinitiators, the resin also consists of monomers and oligomers, together
with an appropriate concentration of reaction terminators. An example would be urethane acrylate
monomers/oligomers. The process of radical polymerization involves initiation, propagation, and
termination and is illustrated in Eqs. (13.24)–(13.27). In photopolymerization, in general, one quan￾tum of light decomposes a single initiator molecule into two free radicals. Thus, each initiator (I),
which normally absorbs a single ultraviolet photon, absorbs two infrared photons simultaneously
and is decomposed into two free radicals (2R), as shown in Eq. (13.24). Each radical reacts with a ̇
monomer (M) or oligomer (Mn), generating a chain radical (RM) at the ends of the monomers and ̇
oligomers, as shown in Eq. (13.25). Each new radical combines with another monomer, generating a
chain reaction, as shown in Eq. (13.26), which is terminated when the chained radical meets another
chained radical, as shown in Eq. (13.27).

Here, R is a photoinitiator and results from the removal of an electron from R. Addition of a monomer ̇
to an oligomer Mn through the propagation process results in the new oligomer Mn+1. An oligomer
consists of a finite number of monomers, as opposed to a polymer which theoretically has an infinite
number of monomers.
The main reason for using an infrared wavelength laser is that since the resin is transparent to
the infrared radiation, the beam is able to propagate, with little or no attenuation, to the focal zone.
Material in the unfocused region (both solid and liquid) is not affected by the radiation. If a fem￾tosecond laser of high enough intensity is used with tight focusing, the power density in the focal
zone can initiate two-photon absorption in that region. Since the rate of two-photon absorption is
proportional to the square of the power density, the process is limited to a small region within the
focal zone. Moving the focal point in 3D space through the resin enables any computer-generated
3D structure to be fabricated within the interior of the resin (Figure 13.15), with a resolution better
than 100 nm, and there is no need to fabricate it layer by layer, as is done with conventional additive
manufacturing. This improves the resolution of the process. The tight focusing also enables spatial
resolution smaller than the laser diffraction limit to be achieved. If ultraviolet radiation was used (in
which case the process would be single photon), the beam would polymerize material (while also
being attenuated by it) through which it propagates.
As an example, the liquid resin ORMOCER, which is an organic–inorganic hybrid polymer, is
sensitive to the 390 nm radiation and if it is exposed to a tightly focused femtosecond laser radiating
at 780 nm (Ti : sapphire) with a pulse duration of 80 fs, and a pulse rate of 80 MHz, 2PP occurs.

numerical aperture of 1.4 is used, resulting in a strongly convergent and thus tightly focused beam.
The threshold time for solidification of the polymer may be about 0.2 ms. After the process, the
unpolymerized resin can be removed by dissolving in acetone or ethanol, depending on the polymer.
The resolution of structures made by 2PP is determined by a number of factors:
1. Spherical aberration at the boundary between the sample and air due to their significantly
different refractive indices. This causes deformation of the focused spot along the optical axis.
This effect can be minimized by having oil between the lens and the sample to remove the
refraction at the boundary between the sample and air.
2. The diffusion of radicals and polymer chain growth beyond the radiation zone. However, since
2PP is only effective in the focused regions of high intensity, the resin does not polymerize
much beyond the focal volume where the photon density is high. Thus, the resolution is much
better than would be obtained for the conventional single-photon absorption process.
13.2.2 Powder-Based Systems
There are different forms of the powder-based systems. Some have characteristics similar to the
liquid-based systems described in the Section 13.2.1, while others are more similar to the solid-based
systems to be discussed in Section 13.2.3. The common feature among these systems is that they use
powder (which may be plastic or metallic) as the starting material. The major types of powder-based
systems include the following:
1. SLS or powder bed fusion (PBF).
2. Direct metal deposition (DMD).
3. Binder jetting.❦

Only SLS and DMD are laser-based. Even though binder jetting does not involve the use of lasers,
it is also discussed for the sake of completeness, and especially since it is becoming increasingly used.
13.2.2.1 Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) This process is now also widely known as the PBF
method. It is similar in concept to the stereolithography approach and involves first depositing a thin
layer of the powder material on the working platform within the process chamber. A high-power laser
is then scanned on the powder layer to trace out the desired shape, heating up the scanned region to a
temperature just below melting. The heat sinters the powder particles and thereby consolidates them,
forming a solid mass. The beam is only directed to the regions defined by the part’s designed shape,
and the rest of the powder material remains unchanged. On completion of this layer, another layer of
powder is deposited on top of it, using a roller mechanism (Figure 13.17). The process of applying a
powder layer and sintering is repeated until the part is completed, after which the unbound powder
is emptied from the rest of the part.
During the process, the powder that is not sintered serves as a built-in support structure. Thus,
no separate supports need to be incorporated in the design, simplifying both the design and
post-processing phases. However, the energy required may be about 300−500 times the energy
required for photopolymerization of a layer of similar thickness. Also, an inert gas is used in the
process chamber to prevent oxidation at the high temperatures. Various materials can be used, as
long as they are in powder form, for example, thermoplastics, composites, ceramics, and metals.
Sample conditions for additive manufacturing by SLS are shown in Table 13.3.
SLS has the advantage of being useful for a wide range of materials such as metals, ceramics, and
plastics. Furthermore, different powders can be sintered at the same slice level, enabling a heteroge￾neous structure with specific desired characteristics to be fabricated. Any unsintered powder can be
used again and is thus not wasted. The process is also one step and does not require any supports.
However, the resulting accuracy is less than that of stereolithography, since it depends on the size of
powder particles. Accuracy is further impaired by the tendency of neighboring particles to become
attached to treated regions as a result of conduction. Also, internal hollow spaces that are created are❦

not as easily cleaned. Thus, components made by the SLS method may not be suitable for surgical
applications. In addition, an inert atmosphere (usually argon) is needed to avoid oxidation during
sintering. Another drawback of the process is that it is mainly effective for new parts built up on flat,
2D surfaces.
SLS machines are made by 3D Systems, EOS, and Sinterit, among others. They tend to be rel￾atively more expensive than those for other AM processes and are thus mainly used in industrial
applications. Earlier machines were based on the CO2 laser. However, fiber lasers are now increas￾ingly used because of their efficiency and higher absorption by metals.
13.2.2.2 Direct Metal Deposition (DMD) The same principle used for laser deposition (Section
11.3) can be used to create 3D objects by depositing one layer on top of another. One advantage of
DMD is that it has the ability to control the type and proportions of material flow into the process,
and thus the composition of the end product. Thus, functionally graded parts can be produced. It
is also good for repairing damaged components. The major drawback is the relatively poor surface
quality and resolution.
The two major forms of DMD currently in use are the following:
1. PBF, as discussed in Section 13.2.2.1.
2. Powder fed direct energy deposition (DED) method.
The procedure for the DED technique is essentially the same as the powder feeding method as
discussed in Section 11.3.2. One major advantage is that it can be used with a five-axis arm and thus
not limited to flat surfaces. It is good for repair work, surface modification, and hybrid manufacturing
(combination of traditional metalworking processes and additive manufacturing). The two processes
are compared in Table 13.4. Some of the companies that make DMD equipment are 3D Systems,
EOS, Optomec, DM3D Technology, Renishaw, and Sinterit.
13.2.2.3 Binder Jetting The binder jetting process (originally known as 3D Printing) also starts
with a layer of powder which is spread over a powder bed mounted on top of a piston and cylinder
arrangement. However, this process is not laser-based, and in this case, the powder particles are
consolidated by ejecting an adhesive bonding material onto the powder using technology similar to
ink-jet printing, in the regions defined by the part’s designed shape. The piston is then lowered, a new
layer of powder is spread, and the binder applied (Figure 13.18). The process is repeated until the
part is completed. The part is then subjected to heat treatment to further strengthen it, after which the
unbound powder is removed. The powder may be metal, plastic, or ceramic. Binder jetting process
has the advantage that the amount of material that is ejected is relatively small compared to the size
of the build. Also, it is a lot easier to fabricate composite parts or heterogeneous components by
adding color, for example. However, the process is slowed by the fact that the powder needs to be
distributed.
Binder jetting machines are produced by ExOne, Voxeljet, Microjet Technology, and 3D Systems.❦

13.2.3 Solid-Based Systems
There are several forms of the solid-based systems, each differing in the manner in which the layer is
applied. However, due to space constraints, we shall only discuss three of the most common systems.
These are as follows:
1. Fused deposition modeling (FDM).
2. Laminated object manufacturing (LOM).
3. Wire deposition
LOM is laser-based, but FDM is not. Others are the selective adhesive and hot press system, the
multi-jet modeling system, the model maker MM-6B, and the hot plot.
13.2.3.1 Fused Deposition Modeling With this process, which is not laser-based, the material is
supplied as a filament wire (about 1.27 mm in diameter) on a spool. It is fed through a heated FDM
head, where it becomes softened into a viscous state and then is extruded and deposited in ultra-thin
layers (Figure 13.19). The extruded material quickly solidifies after deposition. The horizontal width
of the extruded material can vary between 0.25 and 2.50 mm, and the layer height between 50 and❦

400 μm. As with the other additive manufacturing processes, when one layer is completed, the next
layer is laid on top of it until the part is done. Thermoplastics, including aerospace grades such as
polyetherimide (PEI) and polyetheretherketone (PEEK), are typical materials that are processed by
this method. Materials that are used for everyday consumer items include polylactide (PLA) and
acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS). However, FDM machines have lower resolution and produc￾tion rates compared to SL systems. FDM machines are more widely used than SLS systems, since
the SLS equipment tend to be more expensive and are thus mainly used in industry. FDM systems are
produced by several companies, including Stratasys and HP. Some of the desktop products currently
on the market include LulzBot, RepRap, and Ultimaker. The typical build size of a desktop printer
is about 0.2 m × 0.2 m × 0.2 m, and that of an industrial machine may be about 1 m × 1 m × 1 m.
FDM systems that are capable of producing composite-based products are being developed by
Stratasys, Impossible Objects, and Markforged.
13.2.3.2 Laminated Object Manufacturing The principle of this process is illustrated in
Figure 13.20 and involves sequentially bonding together thin layers of material. There are different
ways that bonding can be accomplished:
1. Using an adhesive-coated sheet material that is pressed to the preceding sheets.
2. Using ultrasonic welding to bond the current sheet to the previous layers.
3. Thermal bonding.
4. Mechanical clamping.
With the adhesive-coated method, the sheet material is obtained from a supply roll. Once the
sheet is in place, a laser beam is directed to cut the outline of the part in that sheet. Cross-hatches
are then made by the beam in the excess material outside the part boundary, turning it into a support
structure with a rectangular boundary that remains in place. After that, the platform is lowered with
the formed stack, and a fresh section of the sheet material is moved on top of it. The platform is then
raised, and a heated roller rolls over it, bonding it to the preceding layer in one reciprocal motion.
The part outline is then cut with the laser beam. This continues until the entire part is produced.
The entire rectangular block then comes out, and the part is separated from the surrounding material❦

which is easily removed as a result of the cross-hatching. Sample conditions for laminated object
manufacturing are shown in Table 13.5.
When using ultrasonic bonding, a disk-shaped sonotrode rolls along the sheet metal under pres￾sure, while oscillating at ultrasonic frequencies (typically 20 kHz) in a direction parallel to the
cylindrical axis with an amplitude of about 40 μm. Each layer consists of a series of foils which
are laid next to each other and bonded to the preceding layer one after the other. A milling machine
is often used to trim the part after about four layers have been bonded. Foil thicknesses are typi￾cally about 150 μm. The production of complex structures, for example honeycombs and cooling
channels, are facilitated using this technique. Also, it is a lot easier to embed fibers in the structure.
Thermal bonding uses heat to consolidate one layer with the next, while mechanical coupling
involves the use of mechanical fastening devices.
Laminated object manufacturing is useful for a wide range of materials, including paper, plastics,
metals, ceramics, and composites. However, it has the disadvantage that unused material resulting
from internal hollow spaces can only be removed with difficulty. Also, finishing costs are generally
higher than for the other laser-based processes.
An alternate approach to laminated object manufacturing combines both additive and subtractive
processes where relatively thick slices are machined to shape and bonded to each other to form the❦

3D object. This approach is useful for very large products that may be difficult to manufacture using
conventional machining. The bond strength determines the application for which the product will be
suitable. Bonding methods range from gluing to diffusion welding in metals.
The laminated object manufacturing method has also been used to produce laser-induced
graphene foams. This involves irradiating commercial polyimide film with a CO2 laser to convert
the polyimide into a layer of porous graphene film. One layer is used as the base of a graphene
foam, while the other layers are coated with ethylene glycol as an adhesive, stacked above each
other, and fused together using the laser. The printed foam is then heated at 200 ∘C and atmospheric
pressure or in vacuum at 600 ∘C to evaporate any remaining ethylene glycol.
Overall, LOM is not as commonly used as some of the other additive manufacturing methods.
Variations of machines based on the LOM concept are produced by Cubic Technologies and Mcor
Technologies.
13.2.3.3 Wire Deposition The wire deposition technique is essentially an enhancement of the gas
metal arc welding (GMAW)/metal inert gas (MIG) process. Variations of the gas tungsten arc, plasma
arc, and shielded metal arc welding processes can also be used. It basically involves deposition of
weld beads, layer by layer, to generate a desired design.
13.2.4 Qualitative Comparison of Some Major Systems
In this section, some of the major additive manufacturing techniques are compared qualitatively
(Figure 13.21). Quantitative comparison is difficult to achieve since a number of factors (such as
system calibration, operator expertise, and method of measurement) do influence the outcome.
13.3 POST-PROCESSING
Depending on the build methodology, post-processing may involve such operations as removal of
the part, cleaning, post-curing, and part finishing. The major post-processing operations and the
processes for which they are normally needed are summarized in Table 13.6.
For the liquid-based systems, once the part is completed, excess resin is allowed to drain back into
the vat, and any resin adhering to the part wiped off. A solvent is then used to clean it and low-pressure❦

compressed air subsequently used to dry it. Finally, the part is post-cured using broadband ultraviolet
radiation to complete the polymerization process and increase the strength of the part. This last step
may take a few hours depending on the size of the part.
Finishing is often necessary because of factors that affect the process such as shrinkage, distortion,
and curling and depends on the intended application. Common finishing operations to which the part
may be subjected include cutting, sandblasting, polishing, furnace sintering, coating, and painting.
1. Cutting: Traditional cutting processes such as turning, grinding, milling, and drilling may be
used to improve the surface finish of the part, remove unwanted supports, introduce additional
form features, or improve dimensional accuracy.
2. Sandblasting and Polishing: Sandblasting may also be used to clean up the part, but for better
appearance and higher accuracy, polishing would be necessary.
3. Coating and Painting: Coating is often used to provide a protective layer for the part, while
painting is normally used for esthetic purposes.
13.4 APPLICATIONS
Early additive manufacturing (AM) systems were developed primarily for “touch-and-feel” applica￾tions that provided designers a means to visualize how the final product would look, without regard
to their function. In recent years, as newer techniques have been developed, the range of applications
has increased considerably. The major areas are as follows:
1. Design.
2. Engineering, analysis, and planning.
3. Manufacturing and tooling.
4. Personalized production.
13.4.1 Design
Early applications of additive manufacturing in design included such issues as verification of CAD
models, object visualization, proof of concept, and marketing. Additive manufacturing enables
designers to have a physical part that confirms the design that they have created using CAD. This is
especially important when esthetic requirements are critical. A number of engineering components
are quite complex, physically. Attempting to visualize the final form using CAD drawings can be
quite challenging even for experienced designers, and more so for other engineers and management
who may need to be involved in final design approval. The availability of a prototype significantly
facilitates discussion among these groups. Finally, for marketing purposes, a physical model is❦
❦ ❦
❦
APPLICATIONS 479
always beneficial, enabling potential customers to get a feel for the final product. The prototype can
also be used for marketing brochures.
13.4.2 Engineering, Analysis, and Planning
Aspects of engineering, analysis, and planning for which additive manufacturing is useful include
scaling, form and fit, stress and flow analyses, mock-up parts, planning surgical operations, and
custom prostheses and implants. AM techniques enable models to be scaled up or down by scaling
the CAD design. When the appropriate size is selected, the CAD data is changed accordingly for
creating the AM model. How a part or component fits in with the overall design is something that
can be assessed using a prototype.
The flow characteristics associated with products that involve fluid flow are more easily evaluated
with the aid of a prototype. Likewise, prototypes facilitate the evaluation of stresses that can develop
in a part, using photo-optical methods. Furthermore, prototypes or mock-up parts can be assembled
into the complete product and used for final testing. Finally, AM technology can also be used to pro￾duce custom prostheses and implants, as well as for planning surgical and reconstructive procedures.
13.4.3 Manufacturing and Tooling
In the early years, most applications of AM in manufacturing and tooling involved making patterns to
be used in various processes, for example metal casting, metal spraying, and plastic vacuum casting
with silicon molding. We shall illustrate the use of AM in these areas with metal casting.
Metal casting involves making a mold which has a cavity into which molten metal is poured
and allowed to solidify. The mold is then opened and the casting is taken out. The mold may be
made of sand, plaster, or metal. For making a sand or plaster mold cavity, a pattern is often required.
The pattern is made to the shape of the part to be produced, with only slight modifications, and
is usually made out of wood, metal, or plastic material. Metal and plastic patterns can be made
using additive manufacturing. Metal molds can also be made directly using additive manufacturing.
We shall illustrate the application of AM in metal casting with the investment casting (lost wax)
process (Figure 13.22).
Traditionally, this process first involves preparing a pattern by injecting wax or thermoplastic
resin into a die. A number of separate subpatterns may be joined together after they are removed
from their respective dies, using an adhesive, to form a more complex pattern. A flask is then placed
around the pattern, and ceramic slurry poured into the flask to cover the pattern, to form the mold.
After the mold has set, it is heated to melt out the wax, leaving the mold cavity, into which the molten
metal can be poured for casting. Additive manufacturing can be used to make the pattern faster and
more economically.
13.4.4 Personalized Production
In recent years, rapid prototyping has evolved into additive manufacturing (or 3D Printing),
enabling customized end products to be made. The cost of the production systems has reduced to
the point where individuals can now purchase their own 3D Printing equipment for simple custom
products. The technology has also evolved to the point where products can be made at a reasonable
rate. Such applications include medical (3D bioprinting), aerospace, automotive, architectural, and
medical industries. However, it is still an open question if additive manufacturing can be used for
mass production.❦

13.5 ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES
13.5.1 Advantages
1. It eliminates the need to consider the production method while designing the product, thereby
making the design process simpler.
2. It helps reduce the overall time required for product development.
3. Production of the part is mostly done with one process as opposed to the multiple processes
required when using conventional manufacturing methods.
4. It makes it possible to customize products to the end user needs.
13.5.2 Disadvantages
1. The production rates achievable with additive manufacturing are such that the process is cur￾rently only good for low volume production.
2. The surface quality achievable with the process is low compared to traditional manufacturing
methods.
13.6 SUMMARY
Additive manufacturing involves the generation of physical objects from graphical computer data
and is used in design conceptualization, to facilitate engineering stress analysis, and in making❦

PROBLEMS 481
patterns and/or dies for manufacturing operations. Making a part by additive manufacturing involves
three stages:
1. Computer-Aided Design: A CAD package is used to develop a computer model of the part to be
produced. Where a physical object already exists, reverse engineering may be used to develop
a computer model from the object. The CAD model is next converted into a format required
by the additive manufacturing (AM) equipment. A commonly used format is the STL format.
For processing, the CAD model is sliced into cross sections to facilitate the layer-by-layer
building of the part.
2. Part Building (Processing): Different materials can be processed by additive manufacturing.
The process can thus be categorized by the type of material, viz. liquid-based, powder-based,
or solid-based system. In each case, the part is built one layer at a time. The liquid-based
systems generally involve the use of lasers. One powder-based system that uses lasers is the
SLS process. One solid-based system, laminated object manufacturing, also uses a laser.
3. Post-Processing: After the part is made, it may be further finished by machining, sand-blasting
and polishing, and/or coating and painting.
Finally, 3D micro-components that have nano-features can also be created using 2PP by tightly
focusing a femtosecond infrared laser into a photosensitive resin.

14 Medical and Nanotechnology Applications of Lasers
Lasers have found extensive applications in the medical field over the years. With the field of nan￾otechnology being relatively recent, new developments are constantly evolving. Even though some
of the nano-applications are in the medical field, we separate the discussion into two sections. In the
first section, we focus on medical applications of lasers, limiting the discussion to medical device
manufacturing and therapeutic applications.
Nanotechnology applications are presented in the second section. We start by discussing the
various ways in which nano-features or structures can be produced. This is then followed by a
discussion on a number of the different features that can be produced, specifically nanoholes and
gratings, followed by nanobumps. Finally, laser-assisted nanoimprint technology is presented.
14.1 MEDICAL APPLICATIONS
Laser applications in the medical field cover a number of areas. These may be broadly categorized as:
1. Medical device manufacturing.
2. Therapy.
3. Diagnostics.
There are several applications in each of these areas. However, due to space limitations, we shall
only discuss the manufacturing and therapeutic applications, highlighting only one or two examples
in each of those areas.
The use of the laser as a therapeutic tool and as a diagnostic tool in medicine is summarized in
Tables 14.1 and 14.2, respectively.
In the next section, we shall discuss the application of lasers in the fabrication of medical devices,
using stent manufacturing to illustrate the application.
14.1.1 Medical Devices
A number of medical devices are fabricated using lasers. For metallic components, the basic princi￾ples discussed in preceding chapters do apply. We shall illustrate these with one specific example,
that is, stents (Figure 14.1a). A stent is a small, lattice-shaped, metal tube that is inserted permanently
into an artery. It provides a minimally invasive method of treating coronary artery diseases such as
heart attacks and strokes. These diseases are normally a direct result of limited blood supply due to

the constriction of blood vessels. Gradual buildup of fats in the arteries is believed to be the main
cause for arterial blockage. Earlier treatment of such blockage involved bypass surgery. The advent
of stents in the 1980s began with balloon angioplasty and provided a less expensive and less trau￾matic alternative to bypass surgery for some patients. This evolved into the use of metallic stents,
which are more durable. The stent helps to open an artery so that blood can flow through it. The
treatment simply involves placing the stent onto a balloon catheter assembly and inserting into the
artery. The balloon is then inflated (Figure 14.1b) forcing the artery to open up. When the balloon is
subsequently deflated and removed, the stent is left in place, keeping the artery open.
Such a procedure is normally good for about six months, after which growth of muscle cells at
stent–artery wall interface may lead to arterial reblockage, a phenomenon referred to as restenosis.
Among other things, restenosis has been linked to the smoothness of finished stents, as investigations
have shown that cells that cause restenosis preferentially grow at finished surface and arterial wall
interfaces. In recent years, drug-eluting stents have been developed to minimize the onset of resteno￾sis. These are very effective. However, they are also relatively expensive, compared to bare-metal
stents. Furthermore, recent studies have shown that drug-eluting stents may result in higher incidence
of stroke or heart attack compared to bare-metal stents.
Manufacturing of metallic stents involves the following steps:
1. Drawing of a tubing with dimensions that match the final stent diameter and wall thick￾ness. Typical stent diameters range from 2 to 5 mm, with wall thicknesses ranging from 50
to 200 μm, and lengths from 6 to 38 mm.
2. Laser Cutting: the appropriate design, as illustrated in Figure 14.1c, is then cut out of the
tubing, usually with a laser. Traditional laser cutting results in the formation of striations and
dross. Typical surface roughness obtainable with conventional laser cutting is in the range
0.8–6.3 μm. Finishing operations are therefore necessary to ensure a desirable surface quality.❦

3. Finishing operations as commonly performed, in order, are
a. Pickling, which involves chemical etching done in acid solution to remove most of the
dross.
b. Electropolishing, to remove any residual dross or sharp points that may be left. This involves
passing electric current through an electrochemical solution.
4. The stent is finally placed onto a balloon catheter assembly, sterilized, and packaged.
Materials that have traditionally been used for stents include stainless steels (typically 316L
series), cobalt-based alloys, tantalum alloys, nitinol (nickel and titanium) shape memory alloy, and
biocompatible materials such as polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB).
A number of lasers such as CO2, Nd:YAG, excimer, diode, copper vapor, and titanium sapphire
lasers have been used for cutting 316L-series stainless steel material in stent manufacturing. With the❦
❦ ❦

488 MEDICAL AND NANOTECHNOLOGY APPLICATIONS OF LASERS
traditional continuous wave or long pulse lasers, the thermal energy associated with the laser beam
affects the microstructure of the material in the heat-affected zone (HAZ), and thereby the mechan￾ical properties of the stent. This is undesirable for the following reasons:
1. Stents are permanently deformed by stretching during deployment in angioplasty.
2. Radial pressure from arterial walls and pressure from heart beats subject the stent to fatigue.
To mitigate these problems, ultrashort pulse lasers (pulse duration in the range 10−15 to 10−11
seconds) are being investigated for stent fabrication. These are capable of significantly improving
the surface quality and thereby eliminating the need for additional finishing operations. Also, due to
the reduced heat input and the short time available for the laser beam, the HAZ size is minimized.
14.1.2 Therapeutic Applications
There are several therapeutic applications of the laser, and due to space limitations, we shall only dis￾cuss a few of these, specifically in surgery, opthalmology, dermatology, and dentistry. In each of these
areas, the procedure may be classified under photocoagulation, photodynamic therapy, photodis￾ruption, photoevaporation, or photoablation. In a number of these applications, lasers have several
advantages over traditional procedures. These include
1. Hemostasis or the ability to minimize hemorrhaging through coagulation and thereby provide
a clear surgical field.
2. Precision of the process.
3. Minimal damage to collateral tissue.
4. Rapid and relatively painless healing.
5. The ability to control the beam intensity, enabling control of depth and extent of procedure.
6. The ease with which the laser beam can be positioned and also used to access difficult to reach
areas.
14.1.2.1 Surgical Procedures As Table 14.1 indicates, laser-based surgical procedures primarily
involve coagulation and material removal, where they have significant advantages over mechanical
incision.
One common surgical procedure that uses a laser is laser-assisted uvulopalatoplasty (LAUP).
This is used to treat snoring which results from palatal flutter by reducing the tissues of velum and
uvula and stiffening them. This minimizes or eliminates obstruction of airway, as well as vibration
of soft tissue at the soft palate level. It has the advantage of fewer long-term complications compared
with the traditional uvulopalatopharyngoplasty. The procedure involves using the laser as either an
incision tool to cut material or as a heat source to vaporize material. It is normally performed using
local anesthesia.
Most laser systems can be used for this procedure. The CO2 laser is quite commonly used, even
though diode and Nd:YAG lasers are also extensively used. The latter two have the advantage of fiber
transmission, with the diode laser having the added advantage of compactness. However, both the
Nd:YAG and diode lasers tend to result in a deeper coagulation zone and usually take longer to heal,
compared to the CO2 laser. The postsurgical pain associated with the process is also more severe for
the Nd:YAG and diode lasers.
14.1.2.2 Opthalmology Lasers are ubiquitous in opthalmology and constitute a significant portion
of opthalmic therapy. Our focus here will be on photocoagulation and photodynamic applications.❦
❦ ❦
❦
MEDICAL APPLICATIONS 489
As the name implies, photocoagulation involves the use of a laser (light source) to coagulate (clot)
or destroy abnormal, leaking blood vessels thereby stopping their growth. The process relies on the
selective absorption of light around the green wavelength range by hemoglobin, the pigment in red
blood cells. Various lasers are used for this procedure in opthalmology, for example, the argon ion,
krypton ion, diode, Nd:YAG, and dye lasers. They are usually used in the CW mode with maximum
output power of 2 W, but only for short periods of about 0.1–1.0 seconds and with focal diameters
of about 0.05–2 mm.
One common application of the procedure is in diabetic retinopathy where it is used to seal leaking
blood vessels in the retina, slowing their growth and thereby reducing the risk of vision loss. It is
an outpatient procedure that uses local or topical anesthesia. Other applications of photocoagulation
include treatment of detached retina, tumors of the retina, and age-related macular degeneration,
which is a leading cause of blindness in the elderly.
In photodynamic therapy, a photosensitizer dye, which is a type of drug, is first injected into
the patient. The dye has the tendency to accumulate in tumor tissue. When the tissue is now irradi￾ated with light that is selectively absorbed by the photosensitizer, it produces a type of oxygen that
induces cytotoxicity in the tissue cells, destroying them. It is usually an outpatient procedure and
also has application in the treatment of age-related macular degeneration. Photodynamic therapy is
also known by other names as phototherapy, photoradiation therapy, and photochemotherapy.
14.1.2.3 Dermatology Perhaps the most widely known use of lasers in medicine is in dermatology
where they are used in skin resurfacing to improve skin appearance, in the treatment of skin tumors,
in the treatment of scars and keloids, in the removal of tattoos, and so on.
The lasers that are most commonly used in laser skin resurfacing are the CO2 and Er:YAG lasers.
The coefficient of absorption in water of the Er:YAG laser beam is much higher than that of the CO2
laser. Thus, for the Er:YAG laser, a significant amount of laser energy is absorbed in a thin layer of
about 30 μm with a thermal damage zone of about 50 μm, compared to about a 100 μm depth and
150 μm damage zone for the CO2 laser. Thus, there is less risk of skin damage with the Er:YAG
laser. However, since it is necessary to penetrate to depths of about 250–400 μm for effective laser
skin resurfacing, about three passes are required for the CO2 laser as opposed to the 12–15 passes
required for the Er:YAG laser. Also, the outcome for deep wrinkles is better with the CO2 laser than
the Er:YAG laser. For facial resurfacing, general or local anesthesia may be used depending on the
extent of the procedure.
A number of skin malignancies or tumors are treated using a variety of phototherapies, including
photodynamic therapy, photovaporization, and photocoagulation. In photodynamic therapy, tunable
dye lasers are commonly used, even though other forms of noncoherent light are becoming increas￾ingly popular. CO2 lasers are more extensively used in procedures requiring photovaporization. The
beam may be defocused or focused, with the defocused beam being used to provide homogenous
vaporization of superficial layers, while the focused beam is mainly used for tissue incision. A
CW beam is normally used for large skin lesions, while a superpulse with a pulse duration rang￾ing between 50 and 200 ms is preferred for small lesions. Power levels typcially range from 5 to
20 W, with a beam diameter of about 2 mm. Photocoagulation for skin therapy is usually done with
an Nd:YAG laser.
14.1.2.4 Dentistry The use of lasers in dentistry has largely been limited to soft tissue applica￾tions. Soft tissues include the tissue supporting the tongue, the gums, and the ligaments and fibers
that bind tooth to the socket. Hard tissues refer to the tooth and root. Major advantages of lasers
in this field include the ability to induce hemostasis during the procedure, and lower postoperative
pain experienced, compared to the more traditional procedures. Dental applications for which lasers
are used include gingivectomy (removing excess gum tissue), frenectomy (removal of frenula in the❦

mouth), and removal of tumors. Lasers that are commonly used for dental procedures are the CO2,
Nd:YAG, argon ion, and holmium:YAG lasers. The collateral thermal damage that results when a
CO2 laser pulse of high peak power and short pulse duration is used on oral soft tissue is in the range
15–170 μm.
The majority of the beam power is absorbed within the first 0.3 mm of soft tissue. The argon ion
laser beam, on the other hand, is absorbed in a distance of 1–2 mm, with a collateral damage that is
slightly greater than that of the CO2 laser. The Nd:YAG laser tends to penetrate a lot deeper into soft
tissue. On the other hand, in areas where bleeding can be significant, the Nd:YAG, argon ion, and
holmium:YAG lasers are the ones to consider.
In using a laser for gingivectomy, an important issue is to prevent damage to underlying bone and
tooth substrate. The CO2 laser is effectively absorbed by watery tissue. Thus, it is the tool of choice
for this procedure, since it does not penetrate deeply into the soft tissue and therefore has minimal
impact on the underlying bone and tooth structures.
Different forms of oral lesion can be effectively removed using lasers. Oral leukoplakia is one
common type of precancerous lesion that lends itself well to laser application. It forms as thick,
white patches of the mucous membrane on the tongue, gums, or the inside of the cheeks and cannot
be removed simply by scraping. It is normally caused by chronic irritations such as tobacco or
alcohol abuse.
The procedure to remove the lesion may involve either excision or vaporization. In either case,
no suturing is required. When the lesion is thick and white, then due to its paucity of water, it might
be preferable to use excision. Also, since vaporization normally results in superficial layer removal,
deeper layers may not be removed, enabling the lesion to recur. For the thin patches that lend them￾selves to vaporization, a defocused CO2 laser beam may be used at a power level of 15–20 W.
Vaporization normally leaves a thin carbonaceous deposit on the wound. It is not fully established
whether or not this is beneficial to the healing process.
Compared to the medical field, the application of lasers in nanotechnology is a relatively new and
rapidly growing field. In Section 14.2, we outline some of the developments in nanotechnology that
involve the use of lasers.
14.2 NANOTECHNOLOGY APPLICATIONS
Nanotechnology refers to the variety of techniques that are utilized in the creation of features and/or
structures with minimum feature dimensions smaller than 100 nm. Several technologies have been
developed for fabricating parts with nanosized components and/or features. Our focus in this section,
however, will be on laser-based systems. This is an area that is mushrooming, and due to space lim￾itations, we shall only discuss a few examples. Some of the features or structures that can be created
using laser-based nanotechnology include nanoholes, grating, nanobumps, nanojets, and nanotubes.
The resolution of features created using laser technology is normally determined by the diffraction
limit of the laser system, and that is of the order of half the wavelength of the radiation. However, with
ultrashort or femtosecond pulse lasers, special techniques can be used to generate sub-wavelength
features. These include selecting the peak laser fluence to be just above the threshold ablation fluence
(Figure 9.25), using interferometry, using nanoparticles, and using the laser pulses in combination
with an atomic force microscope or a scanning near-field optical microscope. In general, the feature
resolution associated with femtosecond lasers can be approximated by:
dr = kn𝜆
NAqe

❦ ❦

NANOTECHNOLOGY APPLICATIONS 491
where dr is the femtosecond laser feature resolution, kn = 0.5–1 is a constant, NA is the numerical
aperture of the focusing optics, and qe is the number of photons required to overcome the energy
bandgap.
14.2.1 Nanoholes and Grating
A matrix of nanoholes can be generated by ablating a thin film using four interfering femtosecond
beams. Using a Ti:sapphire femtosecond laser (pulse duration, 90 fs; wavelength, 800 nm; pulse
repetition rate, 1 Hz; beam diameter, 6 mm) with an average laser fluence of 120 mJ/cm2, a matrix
of 800 nm diameter circular holes can be produced in a gold film of thickness 50 nm at intervals
of 1.7 μm (Figure 14.2a). Now with two interference beams instead of four, a grating structure is
obtained (Figure 14.2b) (see also Section 11.6).
Nanoholes can also be generated by directing the laser beam at the gap between the tip of an
atomic force or scanning near-field optical microscope and the thin film. This phenomenon results
from electromagnetic field enhancement below the tip and thermal expansion of the tip. When the
beam intensity exceeds a threshold value (which is less than the ablation threshold without any
particles), each pulse of the laser results in a nanohole being created in the film. The hole size and
depth increase with an increase in the beam intensity. When the workpiece is moved linearly at a
slow enough speed, a grating structure can be produced.
Finely dispersed nanoholes can also be created by first distributing nanoparticles which are trans￾parent to ultraviolet radiation, for example silica and polystyrene particles with diameters ranging
between 150 and 1000 nm, on say, an aluminum film of thickness 35 nm on a silicon substrate. Illu￾minating the surface with a KrF excimer laser of wavelength of 248 nm, pulse duration of 23 ns,
and fluence between 100 and 800 mJ/cm2 results in an array of nanoholes, with depths and diam￾eters that increase with the laser fluence. Similar holes can also be produced on a silicon substrate
using an infrared femtosecond laser after first depositing alumina particles (which are transparent
to the infrared radiation) on the silicon substrate. This also results from optical enhancement effect
between the particles and substrate.
14.2.2 Nanobumps
If the laser fluence is reduced to about 77 mJ/cm2, a matrix of conical bumps are formed at loca￾tions of maximum interference of the four beams (Figure 14.3a). The size of each bump grows with

increasing fluence (Figure 14.3b). At an even higher fluence, a bead or jet begins to form on top of
each bump (Figure 14.3c), and that grows with further increases in the fluence, until eventually the
entire bump becomes a nanohole (Figure 14.3d). The hole diameter increases with the laser pulse
energy. The minimum bump size obtainable is of the order of 8 nm height and 330 nm diameter.
These are much smaller than the wavelength of the laser used. However, the typical bump aspect
ratio (ratio of bump height to diameter) is about 0.44, which is about two orders of magnitude
greater than that obtained when nanosecond lasers are used for laser texturing. This is because of the
shorter thermal diffusion length (of the order of tens of nanometers) for a femtosecond laser com￾pared to that of the nanosecond laser (of the order of tens of microns). Each of the nano-features,
from the bump to the hole formation, has a well-defined threshold. For some materials, for example
100–200 nm chromium-coated layers, the hole may be surrounded by a molten ring along with some
droplets, in that region of the material where the beam intensity falls between the melting and ablation
thresholds.
The bumps result from vapor pressure that is generated as part of the film at the locations of max￾imum interference. This peels and expands material that has been softened by heating at those loca￾tions. That the material is heated at those locations is supported by the conical shape of the bumps,
indicating that the film is more elongated at the top of the bump than at the base. This is because❦

the film is at a higher temperature and therefore more ductile and thin at the top. The formation of
the jet further supports this concept and also indicates that the area where the jet forms may have
been molten.
The bump structure that is obtained depends on the number of interfering laser beams. Ellipsoidal
bumps are formed for three beams (Figure 14.4a–c), and linear bumps are obtained for two beams
(Figure 14.5a,b).
14.2.3 Laser-Assisted Nanoimprint Lithography
In traditional nanoimprint lithography (NIL), a mold (often a quartz template) is used to imprint
features as small as 20 nm into a low-viscosity material, usually either a thermoplastic or UV-curable
resist. Both two- and three-dimensional nanostructures can be produced with a single resist layer.
The UV-based process does not require heating. However, multiple resist layers and multiple etching
steps are often necessary, making it relatively expensive. The thermal-based process, on the other
hand, requires heating of the polymer to soften it. This is a relatively slow process, and it creates a
thermal expansion difference between the mold and substrate which could result in misalignment.
Laser-assisted nanoimprint (LAN) lithography uses a laser beam which is transparent to the quartz
mold (since the quartz material bandgap is greater than the photon energy), for example, a 20 ns pulse
of an XeCl excimer laser of wavelength 308 nm. The beam is directed at the polymer film on the
substrate, and at the same time, the mold is imprinted into the polymer. The entire process can take
less than 500 ns, since only a single laser pulse is necessary. Lower imprint pressures are required
since the laser beam reduces the viscosity of the polymer.❦

14.3 SUMMARY
In the medical field, lasers are used in the fabrication of medical devices such as stents in therapeu￾tic applications and in medical diagnostics. In stent manufacturing, a laser is used to cut the stent
geometry in a metal tubing, followed by finishing operations. The major therapeutic applications
include surgery, where they have been used in: LAUP; opthalmology, with applications in diabetic
retinopathy to seal leaking blood vessels in the retina; dermatology, for skin resurfacing to improve
skin appearance, and also for treating skin tumors; and dentistry, where they are mainly used for soft
tissue therapies such as gingivectomy (removing excess gum tissue), and tumor removal. In many of
these applications, lasers can be used to minimize hemorrhaging through coagulation and have the
advantage of process precision, minimal damage to collateral tissue, and rapid and relatively painless
healing.
Laser-based nanotechnology applications include the production of features or structures such
as nanoholes, grating, nanobumps, nanojets, and nanotubes. These can be produced in a number of
different ways, such as selecting the peak laser fluence to be just above the threshold ablation fluence,
using interferometry, using nanoparticles, and using the laser pulses in combination with an atomic
force microscope or a scanning near-field optical microscope.
Finally, in LAN, a laser beam is used to heat and soften a polymer film before it is imprinted by
a mold.

15 Sensors for Process Monitoring
Every process has inputs and outputs. The inputs are those parameters that can be changed and
collectively used to control the process. The outputs are those parameters that give a measure of the
state of the process and its quality. The inputs for laser processing include the beam power, beam
size (focusing), and traverse velocity (welding or cutting speed). Others are gas flow rate, gas type
(shielding gas, assist gas, and suppressant gas), orientation, workpiece and filler material properties,
properties of optics, beam mode structure, and joint configuration.
Primary outputs that provide a direct measure of the process state are usually difficult to measure
in real time, that is, while the process is in progress, and without destroying the part. Secondary
outputs are more easily measured in real time, but not after the process. The primary outputs for
laser welding, for example, include the penetration, bead width, reinforcement (collectively the bead
geometry), heat-affected zone size, microstructure, mechanical properties (hardness and strength),
residual stresses, and defects (cracks, porosity, undercut, concavity, etc.). The secondary outputs
include the temperatures (temperature distribution, peak temperatures, and cooling rate), acoustic
emission (AE), electromagnetic radiation, and weld pool motion. In the case of laser cutting, the
primary outputs include kerf width, cut edge squareness, microstructure, dross appearance, and sur￾face roughness (striations). Secondary outputs of the laser cutting process include spark discharge
beneath the cut (angle and intensity).
To ensure process quality, it is necessary to measure the outputs of interest, and sometimes where
necessary, the inputs as well. The process outputs, however, often need special sensors. Ideally, the
sensors have to be nonintrusive, rugged enough for the hostile environment, repeatable and reliable,
and relatively inexpensive.
In the rest of the chapter, some of the sensors and sensing techniques that are commonly used
or are under development for monitoring and diagnostics during laser processing are discussed. The
discussion starts with monitoring of the laser beam itself. This is followed by monitoring of the
process, with some of the systems that are discussed also being applicable to seam tracking.
15.1 LASER BEAM MONITORING
In this section, we discuss sensors that are used exclusively for monitoring and control of the laser
beam. The principal beam characteristics that are often measured include the beam power, propaga￾tion (beam size and location), and mode structure. For a continuous wave (CW) laser, the power level
is of interest, while a pulsed laser is characterized by such parameters as beam energy, peak power,
repetition rate, pulse duration, pulse shape, and average power. Beam propagation is characterized
by the variation of diameter with distance (beam divergence) and beam center direction (pointing
stability). The mode structure describes how power is distributed across a plane perpendicular to the

propagation direction. Various techniques have been developed for monitoring each of these char￾acteristics, and we shall briefly outline the principal ones in the following Sections 15.1.1 to 15.1.3.
15.1.1 Beam Power
Drifts in the resonator and other disturbances often introduce fluctuations in the laser output power.
Common techniques for measuring the output beam power are the pyroelectric detector and the
standard beam dump.
15.1.1.1 Pyroelectric or Thermopile Detector This power measuring technique uses a beam split￾ter to divert a portion of the beam, which is sampled using a chopper. The resulting intermittent
signal is then focused onto either a pyroelectric detector or a thermopile that measures the power
level. Pyroelectric detectors are further discussed in Section 15.2.4.1.
15.1.1.2 Beam Dump High-power lasers normally have a beam dump as a standard component,
and its purpose is to dispose of the energy generated when the laser is idling. The beam dump may
also be used as a calorimeter for measuring the output power of the laser. One such device con￾sists of a conical calorimeter through which water is circulated (Figure 15.1). With this device,
the beam is intercepted by a water-cooled polished copper substrate and reflected into the cone.
Thermocouples mounted at the inlet and outlet of the calorimeter enable the temperature rise in
the water as it flows through the calorimeter to be determined. The temperature rise, ΔT, when
combined with the flow rate, ṁ , as determined by a flow meter, enables the beam power q to be
determined:
q = mċ pΔT (15.1)
One major disadvantage of this device is that the entire beam is absorbed by the beam dump,
during which time the beam is not available for processing. It is thus not suitable for in-process
monitoring. Furthermore, the response time is slow (with a time constant of the order of 10 seconds)
and is also insensitive to small fluctuations in power.

Example 15.1 The inlet temperature of a cone calorimeter beam dump is measured to be 25 ∘C,
with the corresponding outlet temperature being 90 ∘C. Determine the power of the laser beam
incident on the calorimeter if the flow rate of water through it is 18 L/h, and the specific heat of
water is 4.186 J/g/K = 4186 J/kg/K.
Solution:
From Eq. (15.1), the power is given by
q = mċ pΔT
The density of water is 1 g/cm3 = 1 kg/L. The flow rate is therefore 18 kg/h = 0.005 kg/s.
The power is thus
q = mċ pΔT = 0.005 × 4186 × (90 − 25) = 1360 W = 1.36 kW.
15.1.2 Beam Mode
The profile or mode of a laser beam can be measured using several techniques:
1. Mechanical methods.
2. Camera-based methods.
3. Approximate methods.
In addition to beam mode (intensity distribution), some of the methods can also provide informa￾tion on the overall power and beam size (measured as the radius at which the beam power drops to
1/e2 of its peak (center) value). These are discussed in the following Sections 15.1.2.1 to 15.1.2.3.
15.1.2.1 Mechanical Methods The mechanical methods are among the earlier techniques devel￾oped for beam profiling. The device is normally mounted between the output window and shutter
assembly, enabling power monitoring to continue even when the laser is idling. They can also be
used to evaluate the beam profile at the focal point. A complete mapping of the beam profile may
take about five seconds. The power loss associated with this technique is only about 0.1%. The
response time for the device can be as small as 10 ms. Another advantage of the mechanical methods
is their high resolution, of the order of 1 μm. Furthermore, they can be used directly with high-power
lasers without attenuation since only a minute fraction of the beam is incident on the detector at any
instance. However, they are only applicable to CW lasers, since synchronization with pulsed beams
can be problematic.
The three most common techniques developed are the rotating rod, rotating hollow needle, and
knife edge (or slit).
Rotating Rod Technique This technique uses a rotating circular rod that is reflective. The rod is
usually made of molybdenum and is rapidly swept through the laser beam in a plane perpendicular
to the beam direction (Figure 15.2). Light is reflected from the rod surface in all directions as it
sweeps through the beam. A small portion of the beam light is reflected from the rod onto two
pyroelectric detectors that are located such that they measure light that are reflected in orthogonal
directions. The detectors may have germanium-coated windows that will only transmit radiation of
a specific wavelength. The output voltage of each pyroelectric detector is proportional to the laser
power incident on it.❦

Rotating Hollow Needle Technique With this technique, a long slender needle that is hollow inside
has a pinhole drilled close to one end of it and is mounted such that the pinhole faces the laser
beam (Figure 15.3). Photons that enter the pinhole are deflected to a pyroelectric detector using two
mirrors (Figure 15.4). The needle rotation enables the laser beam to be scanned in one direction,
say, the x-direction. Scanning in the y-direction to obtain a two-dimensional image is achieved by

Pinhole diameters and measurement resolution are summarized in Table 15.1.
Knife Edge The knife-edge scanning slit profiler is illustrated in Figure 15.5. The laser beam is inci￾dent on a rotating drum that has a slit in it. The slit allows a narrow segment of the beam to be incident
on the detector at any instant, as the drum rotation enables the slit to scan the beam cross-section.
15.1.2.2 Camera-Based Methods The camera-based methods use sensor arrays and are there￾fore similar in principle to optical detectors discussed in Section 15.2.5, capable of capturing
two-dimensional images of the beam power. Different types of camera are useful for different
regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. They have the advantage of being applicable to both CW
and pulsed beams. However, the resolution is generally low (about 10 μm) compared to that of the
mechanical methods since it is determined by the pixel size.
Two of the most common camera types in use are the charge-coupled device (CCD) and charge
injection device (CID). They are most suited for the visible and near infrared wavelength ranges.
CID cameras are not appropriate for pulsed beams since it is difficult to synchronize the camera
readout with the pulse trigger. The signal-to-noise ratio of CCD cameras may range from 8-bit for
the low-end cameras to 16-bit for the high-end cameras.
Other camera types in use include solid-state InGaAs and pyroelectric arrays. However, these
are more expensive than the CCD cameras. The pyroelectric cameras are suited for the 1.1–400 μm❦

wavelength range, have reliable linear outputs, and are good for pulsed beams. However, CW beams
need to be chopped to provide intermittent cooling of the sensor, and the cameras do have lower
resolution compared to the CCD and CID cameras.
The camera-based methods are so sensitive to the laser beam that it is necessary to attenuate the
beam before it reaches the detector. This is usually done by using neutral density (ND) filters or
diverting a small portion of the beam for measurement (Figure 15.6). The attenuation needed for
CCD cameras is typically between 105 and 1012, while that for pyroelectric cameras is of the order
of 104. One common type of ND filter used consists of glass impregnated with absorbing material. It
has a useful wavelength range of about 0.350–1 μm. The filters are characterized by an ND number
defined as
ND = log T (15.2)
where T is the transmission ratio of input to output.
Depending on the application, focused laser beams can be as small as 1 μm in size, and since this
is smaller than the pixel size of many cameras, it is preferable to use one of the mechanical methods
for scanning the focused beam.❦

LASER BEAM MONITORING 503
In recent years, efforts have been made to use smartphone technology to monitor beam parameters
such as size, shape, divergence, M2 factor, and power.
15.1.2.3 Approximate Methods Plastic burn analysis is the most common form of approximate
method used and provides a qualitative measure of beam profiles, especially CO2 laser beams. The
material most commonly used is polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA or acrylic). It is a transparent
polymer with a low thermal conductivity and high absorptivity at the CO2 laser wavelength of
10.6 μm. These properties, in addition to its low sublimation temperature of 300 ∘C, make it ideal for
identification of beam mode. The process involves manually pulsing the laser at low power, about
50 W, until a deep enough cavity is formed in the PMMA material, and measuring the shape formed.
The shape that is measured represents an imprint of the beam power distribution, since the depth to
which the PMMA is sublimated at any location is determined by the beam power at that location.
15.1.3 Beam Size
The beam size can be measured in a number of ways, but the easiest approach uses a Kapton film.
15.1.3.1 Kapton Film Kapton films are highly suited to measuring the sizes of pulsed beams.
They are nonflammable, have low thermal conductivity, and have no melting point. The characteris￾tics of the hole produced in the Kapton film depend on a number of factors, most important being the
beam intensity. When the intensity exceeds a threshold value, the film undergoes pyrolytic decompo￾sition to form a carbonaceous char. At yet higher intensities, the film is vaporized. For pulsed beams,
the length of time affects the shape of hole produced. Well-defined holes are produced at interme￾diate pulse times. For very short or very long pulse times, an irregularly- shaped hole is produced.
Finally, the size of hole produced depends on the peak pulse power and film thickness.
The hole diameter dh produced in a Kapton film by a pulsed multimode beam depends on the
total pulse energy, Qe, and is given empirically by

beam intensity distribution, and ΔHv is the energy necessary to heat and vaporize a unit volume of
the material.
From Eq. (15.3), it is evident that the hole diameter approaches the beam diameter as the pulse
energy approaches infinity, that is,
dh → 2𝑤b as Qe → ∞
Thus, the beam diameter can be obtained by simply plotting the hole diameter versus the corre￾sponding 1/Qe and extrapolating the resulting line to the diameter axis.
For a Gaussian distributed beam, the hole diameter is given by
d2
h = 2𝑤2
(
ln Qe − ln [
𝜋𝑤2hΔHv
2(1 − R)
]) (15.4)
where w is the 1/e2 beam radius.❦
❦ ❦
❦
504 SENSORS FOR PROCESS MONITORING
When the beam radius is constant, the second term of Eq. (15.4) is constant. The square of the hole
diameter is then directly proportional to the natural log of Qe. The beam size can thus be obtained
from the slope of the d2
h versus ln Qe plot for a fixed mean power level. The beam size determined
by either method is independent of the thickness of the Kapton film, which is typically in the range
of 25–125 μm.
15.1.3.2 Other Methods A simple way to determine the beam size is to use a variable aperture
to determine the area of the beam that has 87.5% of the total beam energy. The aperture is opened
to first measure the total power and then reduced in size until the transmitted power is 87.5% of the
total. The output of the aperture is directed toward any of the power measuring devices outlined in
Sections 15.1.1 and 15.1.2. The radius of a circle that has the same area is defined as the beam radius.
This method is most appropriate if the beam is circular.
Other methods for obtaining an approximate measure of the beam size include burning a hole in
a metal foil or photographic paper and measuring the resulting diameter.
15.2 PROCESS MONITORING
The principal parameters that need to be monitored during laser welding, for example, include the
weld pool geometry (width and penetration), defects or discontinuities (cracking, porosity, etc.),
microstructure (strength), residual stresses, and temperatures. For laser cutting, we have the kerf
size, striations, dross, and microstructure. Among the most commonly used sensors for real-time
monitoring are AE, audible sound (AS) (acoustic sensing), and infrared/ultraviolet detectors, all of
which are secondary outputs.
15.2.1 Acoustic Emission (AE)
AE refers to stress waves that are generated as a result of the rapid release of elastic strain energy
within a material due to a rearrangement of its internal structure. It is also sometimes referred to
as stress wave emission. The resulting stress waves propagate through the structure and produce
small displacements on the surface of the structure. These are detected by sensors that convert the
displacements into electrical signals. AE is an active phenomenon, since it is generated by the process
under investigation. As a result, AE signals are well suited for real time or continuous monitoring
because they are generated while the phenomenon is undergoing change.
15.2.1.1 AE Detection Two types of transducers are normally used for AE signal detec￾tion, namely, piezoelectric and capacitive transducers. The piezoelectric transducer is more
commonly used.
Piezoelectric Transducers The principle of piezoelectric transducers is based on the characteristics
of a damped spring-mass system attached to a frame (Figure 15.7). The signal to be detected subjects
the base frame to an input displacement, y, assumed to be sinusoidal and given by
y = Y sin𝜔t (15.5)
where Y is the maximum amplitude of the input base displacement (m) and 𝜔 is the angular frequency
of the input base oscillation (rad/s).❦

Assuming that both the mass and base are displaced in the positive direction and that x is greater
than y and ẋ is greater than ẏ , then the equation of motion of the system shown in Figure 15.7 is
given by
maẍ = −ks(x − y) − cd(ẋ − ẏ ) (15.6)
where cd is the damping coefficient (N s/m), ks is the spring constant (N/m), ma is the system mass
(kg), and x is the displacement of the mass (m).
Now let z = x − y, the relative displacement between the base and mass. Then it can be shown
that

where Z is the maximum amplitude of the relative motion between the base and mass (m), 𝜔n is the
natural frequency of vibration of the undamped system (rad/s), and 𝜁 is the damping ratio.
From Eq. (15.7), we note that when 𝜔n ≪ 𝜔, that is, the natural frequency of the device is much
lower than the lowest harmonic of the motion to be measured, then Eq. (15.7) approaches unity.
Thus,
Y ≈ Z for 𝜔
𝜔n
≫ 1 (15.8)
In other words, the relative motion between the mass and frame then approaches the absolute
motion of the frame. In effect, the mass remains motionless in space. x is the displacement of the
mass which becomes quasi-static at the high frequencies, that is x ≈ 0. The phase difference does
not affect the magnitude of the reading. Thus by replacing the spring and damper system with a
piezoelectric crystal (Figure 15.8), the relative motion between the base and mass will strain the
crystal, generating electrical signals which are a measure of the displacements due to the stress
waves.
A material that is commonly used to induce the piezoelectric phenomenon in AE transducers is
lead zirconate titanate (PZT) which is a ceramic element, and is most commonly used because it
has a relatively high dielectric constant. The relative dielectric constant of a material is the ratio of
charge density arising from an electric field with and without the material present.
Capacitive Transducers This type of transducer is based on the principle of the capacitor, where
the capacitance between two parallel plates depends on the distance between the plates. The mass
in this case is a metallic cylindrical piece placed with its flat surface parallel to the structure surface.❦

The space between the mass and structure is statically charged, and changes in the gap result in a

15.2.1.2 Background This section provides a brief summary of some important factors associated
with AE monitoring. Specifically addressed are the following:
Coupling: Since air is a poor transmitter of high frequency waves, the transducer needs to be
in very good acoustic contact with the workpiece under inspection. A couplant is normally
applied to the transducer base for effective coupling. Typical couplants are oils, glycerin, and
greases.
Pre-processing: The AE signals generated are normally of very low amplitude and high fre￾quency content, and need to be amplified close to the signal source using a low-noise pre
amplifier, to minimize noise contamination as the signal is propagated over the transmission
cable. Most preamplifiers have a gain of 40–60 dB (100–1000 times).
Signal forms: There are two principal types of AE signals:
1. Burst Signals: These are typical of individual events, for example, cracking in weldments.
An event is a single occurrence of an AE activity.
2. Continuous Signals: These are typical of overlapping series of events, for example,
continuous welding without defects.
Precautions: Some of the major precautions that need to be taken in applying conventional
AE instrumentation include the following:
Protecting the transducer from the high temperatures of the processing environments.
Providing a highly reliable acoustic contact between the transducer and the structure.
AE Sources and Major Uses: The common sources of AE include plastic deformation processes
such as dislocation motion, twinning, and grain boundary sliding; phase transformations, such
as martensitic transformation; decohesion of inclusions; fracture; and friction. The detectabil￾ity of an AE signal depends on the energy release rate of the source. Thus slow processes such
as creep and most phase transformations do not generate detectable AE. On the other hand,
processes such as twinning, martensitic phase transformation, and a short pulse laser beam,
that occur over a short period of time, tend to be prolific sources of AE.
Given the sources of AE, it would be most useful for detecting cracking in the fusion zone, and
martensitic transformation in both the fusion and heat affected zones. It would also be sensitive to
keyhole failure, and to some extent, porosity formation.❦

PROCESS MONITORING 507
15.2.1.3 AE Transmission Stress waves normally propagate in a material in any of four different
wave modes, namely, shear (transverse) waves; longitudinal (pressure) waves; Rayleigh (surface)
waves; and Lamb waves. The wave type that predominates in a detected signal depends on the loca￾tions of the transducer and source, and the structure through which the signal propagates.
15.2.1.4 Traditional AE Signal Analysis Traditional methods used in analyzing AE signals
include count and count rate (record of the signal ring-down pulses whose amplitude exceed a preset
threshold voltage); amplitude distribution analysis; frequency spectrum; autocorrelation function;
root mean square (RMS) value of the signal. Factors that influence the results include the threshold
setting (for count and count rate only); gain setting or amplification; and frequency bandwidth.
The threshold setting is a voltage level that is used for the signal counts. A signal count is reg￾istered each time the signal level exceeds the threshold setting. The latter is normally set higher
than the background noise that could interfere with desired signals. The frequency bandwidth cuts
off unwanted higher and/or lower frequency signals, while the gain enables the initial low signal
amplitude to be increased. Figure 15.9 illustrates some of the traditional AE signal processing ter￾minology.
A variation of AE detection is what is termed the acoustic mirror. This is further discussed in the
following Section 15.2.2.
15.2.2 Acoustic Mirror
The acoustic mirror device arises from the observation that high frequency signals are generated
when a high intensity laser beam is incident on a mirror. The signals are detected using a piezoelectric
transducer mounted on the back-side of the mirror (Figure 15.10). The detected signals are sensi￾tive to a number of variables, including the beam power, size, its location on the mirror, wavelength,

laser cavity gas composition, and back reflections from the workpiece. The signal intensity increases
with laser power, and decreases with beam diameter on the detector mirror. The signals are stress
waves that are generated by localized expansion of the mirror when it absorbs a certain percentage
of the incident laser radiation that instantaneously heats the mirror surface. The recorded signal is
due to power variation, and not the absolute power. A typical signal output is shown in Figure 15.11,
illustrating the long term characteristics of the signal, as well as its dependence on keyhole initia￾tion. Spectral analysis of the acoustic mirror signal normally shows two principal peaks, one around
100 kHz, and the other around 1 MHz. The low frequency component is found to depend on the gas

mixture, while the high-frequency component depends on the cavity design, and thus on the cavity
oscillations. The dependence of the acoustic mirror signal on beam location on the mirror results
from the variation in the distance between the beam location and the sensor location.
A major advantage of the acoustic mirror device is that it does not interfere with the incident laser
beam, and is also independent of the processing direction. The mirror can be located anywhere in
the beam delivery path.
A variation of this monitoring technique is what is called the AE nozzle (AEN), and involves
mounting a piezoelectric transducer on a beam delivery tube which is thermally insulated from the
nozzle by a washer. The detector is also protected from direct back reflections from the process by
a shield (Figure 15.12). The characteristics of the signal detected under these conditions are found
to be a good indication of the cut quality in laser cutting (Figure 15.13).
15.2.3 Audible Sound (AS) Emission
The AS technique uses a microphone to detect low frequency (15 Hz to 20 kHz) acoustic signals
generated during laser processing, in a sense, making use of the sound detected by an operator.
The acoustic signals are the result of pressure variations at the process source, which propagate to
the microphone. The intensity of the detected signal thus depends on the pressure and velocity of the
fluid at the source. It also depends on the size of the source, and the distance between the source
and sensor. In laser cutting, the signal intensity depends on the density and velocity of the assist
gas jet, and the resonant frequency of the detected signal is found to depend on the cutting front
geometry, specifically the kerf width and depth of cut. The signals associated with gas flow rates
up to 40 L/min and velocities of the order of 50 m/s in laser welding are barely measurable. The
microphone is normally mounted in the immediate vicinity (approximately, 40 mm) and directed
toward the process area (at an angle of about 45∘). It has the advantage of being non-contact. A
typical setup is illustrated in Figure 15.14.❦

PROCESS MONITORING 511
Sources of sound emission during laser processing include the following:
1. Variations in gas momentum caused by heating and boiling processes (vapor formation).
2. Variations in gas pressure or momentum change associated with the impact of gas jets on the
workpiece surface. This is especially important in laser cutting where the signals may result
from vibrations caused by impingment of the assist gas on the cutting front.
3. Vapor expansion out of the keyhole opening in laser welding. The contribution of this signal
source depends on
i. Vapor pressure inside the keyhole.
ii. Size of the keyhole.
iii. Velocity of the expanding front.
4. Shock wave accompanying plasma ignition, which would result in a transient signal. However,
when the plasma obstructs the laser beam and prevents it from reaching the workpiece, then
the intensity of the subsequent signal is significantly reduced.
5. Defects such as cracking.
15.2.4 Infrared/Ultraviolet (IR/UV) Detection Techniques
In this section, general information is first presented on Infrared/Ultraviolet (IR/UV) detection, and
how that relates to laser processing. This is then followed by more detailed discussion of infrared
detection, and then ultraviolet (UV) detection.
IR/UV detection techniques analyze radiation emitted from the process zone in two wavelength
bands of the electromagnetic spectrum. One is the infrared band in which most of the radiation
from the hot material is concentrated, and the other is the ultraviolet band in which the plasma
radiation is concentrated. Changes in the temperature of the plasma emerging from the keyhole will
result in a change in the ultraviolet signal, which can be used to provide a predictive indication of
keyhole failure. This is effective because the response of liquid flow is much slower than that of the
plasma. For example, should there be a sudden reduction in the plasma density, that could reduce the
effectiveness of beam coupling to the keyhole, resulting in possible eventual failure of the keyhole
and the welding process. Thus by detecting the change in the ultraviolet signal, the impending failure
can be anticipated. The intensity of the ultraviolet signal is significantly reduced when the plasma
is blown through the workpiece to form a cut, further confirming the dependence of the ultraviolet
signal on the plasma. Changes in the infrared signal also provide information on variations in the
melt pool.
A typical sensor used for the infrared radiation is a germanium photodiode fitted with a silicon
filter having a spectral range from 1.0 to 1.9 μm. The ultraviolet radiation may be measured with a
gallium phosphide (GaP) photodiode with a spectral range from 0.19 to 0.52 μm. Possible arrange￾ments for the set-up would be as shown in Figure 15.14. Both the ultraviolet and infrared signal
intensities increase with the laser power, while increasing shielding gas flow rate reduces the signal
intensities, probably due to a reduction in plasma volume. Table 15.2 illustrates how the relative
intensities of the infrared and ultraviolet signals reflect on weld quality.
15.2.4.1 Infrared Detection
Background At temperatures above absolute zero, all objects radiate infrared energy that is part of
the electromagnetic spectrum and has a wavelength range from 0.75 to 103 μm (between the visible
light and microwave bands). The bodies that emit infrared radiation can be classified into three types
based on the spectral characteristics of the radiation:❦

1. Blackbody Radiation: This type of radiation is emitted from a body with an emissivity of one.
A blackbody is one that absorbs all incident radiation and reflects none.
2. Graybody Radiation: The emissivity distribution of this type of body is similar to that of a
blackbody, but less than unity.
3. Selective Radiation: In this case, the emissivity varies with wavelength.
Emissivity is the ratio of the radiant energy emitted by a surface to that emitted by a blackbody
at the same temperature. Also, the fraction of an incident beam of radiant power that is absorbed
by a surface. It usually depends on the direction of the incident radiation and is greatest in the
normal direction and declines in magnitude in proportion to the cosine of the angle with the normal.
The intensity of the radiated power (W/mm2) depends on both the temperature of the body and
the wavelength. For a blackbody, the distribution is given by Planck’s law, which can also be
expressed as
I𝜆 = c1𝜆−5
e
c2
𝜆T − 1
(15.9)
where c1 = 2𝜋c0
2hp = 3.74 × 10−16 J m2/s, c2 = c0hp/kB = 1.44 × 10−2 m K, and I𝜆 is the amplitude
of radiant energy at a given wavelength 𝜆, at temperature T, per unit wavelength interval, per unit
time, per unit solid angle, per unit area.
The energy distributions for a blackbody are shown in Figure 15.15a,b on log–log and linear plots,
respectively, and those for a graybody and non-graybody (where radiation is selective) are illustrated
in Figure 15.16. For a blackbody, each temperature results in a specific curve that increases rapidly
from zero intensity at zero wavelength to a maximum and then gradually decreases asymptotically
toward zero at long wavelengths. The peak intensity increases with temperature and occurs at shorter
wavelengths for higher temperatures. The wavelength 𝜆m at which the peak intensity occurs for a
given temperature is given by Wien’s law:
𝜆mT = constant (15.10)
For a blackbody at a given temperature, T, the total hemispherical radiation I per unit area and time
is given by the area under the distribution curve for that temperature, and is obtained by integrating
Planck’s equation. That results in the Stefan–Boltzmann law:
I = ∫

For a graybody, the total radiation is the product of that of the blackbody and the emissivity of the
body in question. The emissivity generally depends on the material and its surface conditions. The
temperature of a graybody whose emissivity and ambient temperature is known can be determined
by measuring the radiance and using the Stefan–Boltzmann law.❦

514 SENSORS FOR PROCESS MONITORING
Infrared Detectors The sensors that are used for detecting infrared radiation can be categorized
into two broad groups:
1. Thermal Detectors: With this type of detector, the material absorbs radiation, resulting in
the generation of phonons that cause lattice heating. The lattice heating produces a change
in the electrical properties of the material that are detected. The transduction process thus
involves two steps. Common types of thermal detectors include pyroelectric devices and
thermocouples.
(a) Pyroelectric Devices: A change in temperature due to the incident radiation results in
a change in dipole moment of the material, and thus charge difference between crystal
faces, which is measured. They have fast response, but require chopped radiation source
to define absolute levels.
(b) Thermocouples: The principle of thermocouples is based on the Seebeck effect, where
thermal energy is converted into electric energy when two dissimilar metals are joined
and one end is heated. If the joined wires form a closed circuit, in which case we
also have two junctions, then electromotive force (EMF) is induced and results in
current flow through the circuit. One of the junctions, the hot junction, is exposed to
the incident radiation, while the cold junction remains at a relatively constant tem￾perature. The cold junction is usually located near massive portions of the mounting
or case.
For two dissimilar metals, A and B, joined as shown in Figure 15.17, the net induced
EMF (Ev) is given by
Ev = ∫

T1
𝛼AdT + ∫

(𝛼A − 𝛼B)dT (15.12)
where 𝛼A and 𝛼B are the absolute Seebeck coefficients of materials A and B, respectively
(V/K).
The voltage, Ev, is thus used as a measure of the temperature difference between the
hot and cold junctions.
2. Photon Detectors: With photon detectors, the radiation absorbed directly produces a change
in the electrical properties of the detector and is thus one-step. Photon detectors thus have
a faster response, and the examples are photoconductive, photoresistive, photoemissive, and
photovoltaic detectors.

PROCESS MONITORING 515
Infrared Systems At the core of the infrared system is the detector, which may either be a single
detector or an array detector.
1. Single Detectors: The single detector consists of a single element comprising one of the sensors
discussed in the preceding section. The image of an object is obtained by using a scanner,
which sequentially focuses different sections of the object unto the detector. When it is only
necessary to monitor the object along a line, a line scan is used. For area detection, the scan
is done both horizontally and vertically. For spot detection, there is no need for scanning, and
the detector is focused at one spot.
2. Linear Detectors: The linear detector consists of a linear array of detectors, about 4096. Points
along a line on the object are thus detected simultaneously, and thus for linear detection, no
scanning is necessary. For area detection, the object is scanned vertically, if the array is hori￾zontal.
3. Array Detectors: Two-dimensional array detectors are able to acquire an area image of an
object without scanning and may have up to 4096 × 4096 elements.
Many commercial infrared systems use liquid nitrogen to cool the detectors, with the detec￾tor being mounted in the base of a Dewar flask. However, more recent developments may involve
solid-state detectors that use the detector substrate as a heat sink, thereby making additional cool￾ing unnecessary. During operation, the scanner detects heat from the source by capturing thermal
radiation emitted as infrared electromagnetic waves. The use of a chopper within the scanner pro￾vides a radiance reference for the system. The detector output level may be set with this refer￾ence a number of times per second. This controls system drift that would otherwise be present
when temperature difference measurements are made in the presence of a changing background
temperature.
The detected infrared energy is converted to an electrical signal and then quantified for each ele￾ment using either color or different levels of gray to show discrete levels of thermal energy. Image
processing may also be performed directly on the electrical signal. Most systems are either of the
short wavelength or long wavelength type. The short wavelength systems have detectors that are pri￾marily sensitive to the 1–6 μm range, while the long wavelength detectors are sensitive to the 8–14 μm
range. Commercially available long wavelength systems are capable of measuring temperatures in
the range of −20 to 2500 ∘C with a resolution of 0.2 ∘C.
Two major applications of infrared sensing are currently in use: (i) thermal imaging and (ii)
infrared signal analysis.
Thermal Imaging: In thermal imaging, thermal images are recorded on-line, and by image pro￾cessing, process states such as weld geometry can be measured.
Infrared Signal Analysis: In infrared signal analysis, infrared signals are converted to electrical
signals and analyzed using signal processing techniques.
Problem Sources
1. Plasma Interference: In addition to radiation from the object to be monitored such as the
molten pool or joint, radiation may also be received from the plasma. This would result in
erroneous interpretation of the data. For reliable monitoring, the plasma either needs to be
screened from the detector or its radiation needs to be filtered from the incident radiation.
The use of a detector that is most sensitive in the appropriate wavelength range would increase
the signal-to-noise ratio.❦

2. Emissivity: The infrared radiation from a material is a function of both temperature and
emissivity. Thus, for a given detected radiation, the absolute temperature cannot be deter￾mined unless the emissivity is known. However, the emissivity can vary significantly for
a given material, depending on both the surface condition and temperature. For a steel,
for example, this may vary from about 0.07 for a polished surface to about 0.79 for an
oxidized surface.
Application to Process Monitoring In this section, welding is used as a specific example. However,
the concepts discussed are applicable to other processes that involve the formation of a molten pool.
A regular welding process, for example, results in symmetric and repeatable patterns of the temper￾ature gradients. Imperfections in the process, however, result in a discernible change in the thermal
profiles.
The thermal image of a stationary welding process with the heat source positioned directly
above the joint center is illustrated in Figure 15.18a. The corresponding line scan across the center
is shown in Figure 15.18b, from which the distribution is found to be symmetrical. The average
weld pool diameter can be obtained from the line scan and is given by the inflections around the
peak temperature.
When the heat source is shifted to one side of the joint center, the thermal image becomes distorted
in shape, consisting then of half-moon shapes (Figure 15.19a,b). This asymmetrical temperature
distribution is caused by the excess energy that is deposited on one side of the joint relative to the
other and the contact resistance at the joint, which reduces heat flow across the joint, resulting in
higher temperatures on the side with excess energy. The heat source could then be moved in the
appropriate direction until the two radii are equal.
15.2.4.2 Ultraviolet Detection Radiation associated with the plasma is concentrated in the UV
band of the electromagnetic spectrum (0.01–0.4 μm). Thus, since welding plasma is primarily gen￾erated from the keyhole, ultraviolet sensing is usually correlated with keyhole formation and weld
penetration.
There are two major applications of UV sensing: (i) spectroscopic analysis and (ii) ultraviolet
signal analysis.
Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Analysis Spectroscopic analysis is useful for determining the ion content
in the plasma. This is important in determining the extent of plasma formation due to metal vapor
and shielding gas. Especially important is plasma absorption of the laser power above the workpiece❦

or coupling of laser energy to the material, a phenomenon that is highly influenced by the plasma size
and its spectral characteristics. The spectrum provides information on the plasma electron tempera￾ture, Tpl, and also the electron density, ne, which is normally obtained using techniques involving the
relative line intensity and stark broadening of spectral lines. These techniques do not need calibra￾tion. The spectrum may be obtained using a spectograph coupled with a gated optical multichannel
analyzer.
Plasma temperatures can be extracted from spectroscopic information by using relative emission
intensity ratio of ion states of an element if the plasma is dense enough for local thermodynamic
equilibrium (LTE) to exist.
Ultraviolet Signal Analysis While spectroscopic analysis is very important, recent developments
in ultraviolet signal analysis have shown a lot of potential. In ultraviolet signal analysis, ultraviolet
signals from the process are converted into electrical signals. Magnitude and frequency analyses
of the output signals are then correlated with process states. In laser welding, for example, when
penetration occurs, a clear relationship between full penetration and the ultraviolet plasma signal is
usually observed.
Fluctuations in the laser-induced plasma do occur even when the laser power is constant. Such
fluctuations can be monitored using a photodiode. Sudden changes in mass flow rate (and thus
pressure) of the plasma out of a keyhole result in steep and narrow peaks in the photodiode signal.
A key application of plasma monitoring is in detection of melt through during laser welding, since
this significantly reduces the pressure in the keyhole, and thereby the photodiode signal.
15.2.5 Optical (Vision) Sensing
Optical sensors are often used for monitoring molten pool geometry, kerf size, and observing flow on
the free pool surface and chevron formation. In addition, they are also used for seam tracking. The
basic components of an optical sensing system include the sensor or detector, illumination source,
object, transmission elements, and the processor.
15.2.5.1 Optical Detectors The most common type of optical detector is the solid-state array cam￾era, which usually has an array of charge injection or CCD light-sensitive elements. The output from
the camera is dumped into a memory buffer for analysis. An optical filter is usually used to separate
the laser radiation from heat radiation. The detector elements may require significant attenuation,
especially when used for a focused beam.❦

15.2.5.2 Detector Setup Some of the problems associated with optical sensing include the
extreme brightness of the plasma plume compared to that of the molten pool (high contrast)
and dependence of the intensity on processing conditions. Spatter and fumes may also obscure
the object to some extent. Separate illumination is thus normally used to enhance the system
resolution. It may be in the form of either structured light or general (nonstructured) illumination. A
structured light is a pattern of lines or a grid of light that is projected unto the object to help provide
information on the three-dimensional shape of the object, based on the apparent distortion of the
pattern (Figure 15.20a).
The general illumination could come from an auxiliary high-intensity light source. An example
involves illuminating the object with a narrow bandwidth laser beam, with the beam bandwidth
selected to be in the region where the sensitivity of the detector is high, based on the spectral charac￾teristics of the detector (Figure 15.20b). This is because the light spectrum from an object generally
does not have equal intensity at all wavelengths (Figure 15.16). All light incident on the detector is
then filtered except for the narrow bandwidth of the auxilary beam, thereby subduing the effect of
the bright light from the plume.
The detector arrangement for an optical sensing system is similar to that of an infrared array
(Section Infrared Systems). It may be a linear or two-dimensional array.
15.2.5.3 Edge Detection Methodology Edge detection is used to identify the molten pool bound￾ary. This enables say the weld bead size to be determined, and hence, an estimate to be made of
the load-carrying capacity of the weldment. Using the setup shown in Figure 15.21a, an example
molten pool image data as obtained from the camera are shown in Figure 15.21b. Figure 15.22
shows a three-dimensional view of the same image. The image could be contaminated by noise from
a number of sources.❦

Noise Sources Potential sources of noise include the following:
1. Dust on the Optical Components: This results from condensation of metal vapor.
2. Noise Due to Fiber Thread Boundary: When a fiber optic cable is used, the image at the end
of the cable is a combination of small images transmitted by individual fibers in the bundle.
Very thin lines encircle each individual image cell, representing the boundaries of each fiber.
These influence the image quality because they result in uneven brightness, which is a noise
source on the image, and cannot be eliminated.
3. Noise from the CCD Array: Each individual photo diode cell of the CCD array converts
a portion of the image into an electrical signal. Increasing the density of photo diodes
in one CCD array results in a more vivid image. The image resolution is determined by
the number of photo diodes used. The noise results when the CCD array converts the
two-dimensional image into electrical signals. This is a minor noise source that cannot
be corrected.
4. Image Digitization Noise: When the resolution of the frame grabber (say, 640 × 480 pixels) is
different from that of the camcorder (say, 512 × 512 pixels) that can be a source of error.
As a result of these error sources, low-pass filtering is necessary.
Filtering There are different types of filters available for analyzing optical signals. As an
example, the nine-point averaging method, which is commonly used, is discussed. It involves
replacing a given point P(i, j) by the average of all eight neighboring points, plus the original value
of the point:
P(i, j)n = 1
9
[
∑
j+1
j−1
∑
i+1
i−1
P(i, j)
]
(15.13)
where P(i, j)n is the new value of the point P(i, j). Application of nine-point averaging to the original
image of Figure 15.22a is shown in Figure 15.22b.
Edge Detection Following filtering, edge detection is then used to determine, for example, the
molten pool boundaries. Two common techniques are directional and nondirectional edge detection.
Directional Edge Detection: The gradient value of a point P(i, j) in the x-direction for directional
edge detection is given by
x gradient of P(i, j) = |P(i − 1, j − 1) + P (i − 1, j) + P (i − 1, j + 1) − P (i + 1, j − 1)
− P (i + 1, j) − P (i + 1, j + 1)| (15.14a)
Likewise, the gradient value in the y-direction is
y gradient of P(i, j) = |P(i − 1, j − 1) + P (i, j − 1) + P (i + 1, j − 1) − P (i − 1, j + 1)
− P (i, j + 1) − P (i + 1, j + 1)| (15.14b)
The absolute value of the gradient is used, to accommodate both positive and negative values.
Boundary points are determined using a threshold, and the following equation may be used
to identify candidate boundary points:❦
❦ ❦
❦
PROCESS MONITORING 521
This is a candidate boundary point, if
(x-directional gradient ≥ threshold) or (y-directional gradient ≥ threshold) (15.15)
Nondirectional Edge Detection: The nondirectional edge detector is based on the gradient of an
image f(x, y) at location P(x, y):
∇f =
(
∇x f
∇y f
)
=
⎛
⎜
⎜
⎜
⎜
⎝
𝜕f
𝜕x
𝜕f
𝜕y
⎞
⎟
⎟

⎟
⎠
(15.16)
where ∇x f = 𝜕f
𝜕x is the x-directional gradient and ∇y f = 𝜕f
𝜕y
is the y-directional gradient.
The gradient vector points in the direction of maximum change rate. The x- and y-directional
gradient operators can be calculated using Sobel operators, which provide smoothing during
the differentiation operation. Sobel operators in the x and y directions are represented as
∇x f = |P(i − 1, j − 1) + 2P (i − 1, j) + P (i − 1, j + 1) − P (i + 1, j − 1) − 2P (i + 1, j)
− P (i + 1, j + 1)| (15.17a)
∇y f = |P(i − 1, j − 1) + 2P (i, j − 1) + P (i + 1, j − 1) − P (i − 1, j + 1) − 2P (i, j + 1)
− P (i + 1, j + 1)| (15.17b)
The values are always positive. Figure 15.23a shows the results (in two dimensions) of applying
the nondirectional gradient detector to the image in Figure 15.22b.

522 SENSORS FOR PROCESS MONITORING
Finding the Boundary Points The actual boundary points need to be determined from the candidate
points of Figure 15.23a. A simple method is the line-by-line searching algorithm which searches the
entire image row-by-row. One criterion for selecting outer boundary points might be
outer boundary point
= outer candidate point which has at least two other candidate points in its neighborhood
(15.18)
The resulting boundary for the image in Figure 15.23a is shown in Figure 15.23b.
Calibration Calibration is used to convert the initial unit of pixel to metric units and to determine
the threshold values used in the boundary point search algorithm. This may be done experimentally
by first placing white circles of known diameter against a black background and capturing their
images. The resulting images may be elliptical, depending on the camera orientation. The lengths of
the major and minor axes of the image are then determined in pixels. From these measurements, the
image resolution can be determined in millimeters per pixel.
15.3 SUMMARY
Sensors for monitoring laser processes can be categorized into three groups:
Beam monitoring sensors: They are used for measuring beam characteristics such as power and
beam distribution. Examples of such sensors are the beam dump (for power) and laser beam
analyzers (rotating rod, hollow needle, or camera) for beam distribution. The beam size can
also be determined using a Kapton film.
Process monitoring sensors: These are used to measure actual process features such as geometry
of the molten pool, kerf size, and defects that are formed during the process. The top view of
the pool geometry, for example, can be measured using vision, infrared, or ultraviolet sensors.
Infrared and ultraviolet detectors can also provide information on the stability and therefore
quality of the process. The individual detector elements can be arranged either in a linear
array (for measurement along a line) or a two-dimensional array (for area images). Whereas
the vision, infrared, and ultraviolet sensors can detect defects that are exposed to the surface,
AE detectors can, in addition, detect defects that are embedded in the workpiece. In all cases,
special precautions have to be taken to prevent contamination of the measured signal by noise.
Seam tracking sensors: These are used to detect the joint along which the laser beam is expected
to follow, enabling the beam to be guided automatically. Seam tracking can be done using
vision and infrared sensors.

16 Processing of Sensor Outputs
In Chapter 15, the major sensors that are used in monitoring laser processes were discussed. Process
outputs, as reflected in the measured signals, are generally stochastic in nature. Thus, it is often
necessary to further analyze the signals to extract pertinent information about the state of the process.
There are several methods available for analyzing signals, but only a basic approach is considered
here. The discussion in this chapter on processing of sensor outputs therefore focuses on the identifi￾cation of faults that may occur during laser processing, for example, cracking, porosity, no weld, and
so on, and is limited to classification methods. Implementation of a classification scheme normally
involves three steps (Figure 16.1):
1. Sampling (digitizing) the input signal to produce the pattern space.
2. Feature extraction, which normally involves transformation of the signal from the pattern into
the feature space, from which useful information can be obtained. This is usually accompanied
by a reduction in the data size.
3. Classification of the feature space to identify the individual signal sources (classes).
Since sampling of an analog signal influences the results of its transformation, the discussion
on these two issues are combined into one, under signal transformation. The Fourier transform, the
discrete Fourier transform, and their properties are discussed, along with pitfalls of digital analysis.
This is followed by the sampling theorem, aliasing, and leakage. Next, data reduction is presented,
focusing on the variance and Fisher criteria. Pattern recognition and neural network analysis are then
discussed in terms of pattern classification. Finally, time–frequency methods such as the short-time
Fourier transform (STFT) are briefly outlined.
16.1 SIGNAL TRANSFORMATION
Measured signals are often contaminated by noise. To characterize the system from which the signal
is being obtained, in the presence of the noise, the signal is first transformed into another domain to
facilitate analysis and interpretation. There are various transforms that can be used, such as Fourier
transform, the Walsh–Hadamard transform, the Haar transform, and the Karhunen–Loeve transform.
The Fourier transform is perhaps the most commonly used one because it permits a more useful
engineering interpretation of the results and will therefore be the focus of our discussion.
16.1.1 The Fourier Transform
The Fourier transform involves the transformation of information from the time domain (time series)
to the frequency domain (spectrum). The basis of spectral analysis is that a nonperiodic signal, f(t),

using the Fourier transform, which is given as:

where i = √
−1, 𝜔 = 2𝜋𝜈 is the angular frequency and 𝜈 is the frequency.
Equation (16.1) is the Fourier transform of f(t) and Eq. (16.2) is the inverse Fourier transform,
and together, they constitute the Fourier transform pair. The Fourier transform is a special form of
the Fourier series and is applicable to nonperiodic functions. Note that there are several variants of
the Fourier transform pair.
g(𝜔) is a complex continuous function of 𝜔 and can be rewritten as:
g(𝜔) = A(𝜔) + iB(𝜔) (16.3)
where A(𝜔) and B(𝜔) are the real and complex components, respectively, of g(𝜔).
The amplitude spectrum, a(𝜔), of the function f(t) is then given by:

A(𝜔) (16.4c)
Direct use of the amplitude spectrum, a(𝜔), can sometimes present problems when there are
pseudorandom components that can produce varying a(𝜔) that average out to zero over a long signal
length, Δ𝜏. The use of the power spectrum eliminates this problem. To make the power spectrum
independent of the duration, Δ𝜏, of the data, it can be reexpressed as:
qn(𝜔) = 1

16.1.2 The Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)
For digital analysis, the discrete equivalent of the Fourier transform is used. Let {x(j)} denote a

The signal time series, x(j), is considered to be periodic. Some points to note in relation to the
DFT are as follows:
1. Each component of the transform is a harmonic. The actual frequency is k𝜈0, where 𝜈0 is the
fundamental frequency.
2. For real x(j), the real part of the digital transform, Re[y(k)], is symmetric about the folding
frequency (
𝜈f = 𝜈s

)
where 𝜈s is the sampling rate. The imaginary component, Im[y(k)], is
antisymmetric.
16.1.3 Pitfalls of Digital Analysis
To understand some of the problems one might encounter in using the discrete Fourier transform,
and consider a simple cosine waveform. The continuous transform of this waveform consists
of two impulse functions which are symmetric about zero frequency (Figure 16.3a). For digital
analysis, only a finite portion of the original cosine waveform signal is observed. This is equivalent

to multiplying the signal by a unity rectangular window. The transform of this rectangular
window is a (sin x/x) function (Figure 16.3b). This results in distortion of the transform of the finite
waveform (Figure 16.3c). Now sampling is equivalent to multiplying the signal by a train of impulses
(Figure 16.3d). The final transform of the finite sampled waveform is thus a repetition of the distorted
transform in the frequency domain (Figure 16.3e,f). What this means is that a simple and straight￾forward sampling of a signal may introduce spurious frequency components where none existed.❦

16.1.4 The Sampling Theorem
The sampling theorem determines the lower limit of the sampling rate that needs to be used to avoid
problems that can result from sampling. For the original continuous signal to be recoverable from
its digital version, the digital form has to be obtained by sampling at a frequency which is at least
twice the highest frequency in the original continuous signal, that is,
𝜈s = 2𝜈h (16.8)
where 𝜈h is the highest frequency in the signal, 𝜈s = 1/𝛿𝜏 is the sampling rate (sampling frequency),
and 𝛿𝜏 is the sampling period.
The sampling theorem only establishes an ideal limit. In practice, the sampling rate has to be about
5–10 times the highest frequency. Some consequences of sampling, or more specifically, of using the
discrete Fourier transform are aliasing and leakage. These are briefly discussed in Sections 16.1.5
and 16.1.6.
16.1.5 Aliasing
Aliasing is a phenomenon that happens when a signal is sampled at a rate that is lower than
twice the highest frequency (𝜈h in Figure 16.4). When this occurs, frequencies above the fold￾ing frequency 𝜈f = 𝜈s
2 are aliased or folded back into the frequency range below the folding
frequency. In other words, a frequency component that is, say, 100 Hz higher than the folding fre￾quency will be impersonated by a frequency component that is 100 Hz lower than the folding
frequency. The low-frequency component has the same amplitude as the high-frequency component.
In Figure 16.5, the original high-frequency signal is impersonated by the low-frequency alias which
also fits the sampled data. In general,
𝜈alias = 𝜈sample − 𝜈actual (16.9a)
or as illustrated in Figure 16.4,
𝜈h − 𝜈f = 𝜈f − 𝜈a (16.9b)
where 𝜈a is the aliased frequency and 𝜈f is the folding frequency.

❦ ❦
❦
532 PROCESSING OF SENSOR OUTPUTS
In other words, the aliasing signal frequency is always the difference between the actual signal
and a harmonic (multiple) of the sampling frequency. In Figure 16.4, 𝜈m is sampled without any
problems, since it is lower than half the sampling rate.
16.1.6 Leakage
Leakage results primarily from the fact that the signal being analyzed is finite in length. As indicated
in Section 16.1.5, the finite length of data obtained by sampling over a period, Δ𝜏, is equivalent to
multiplying the signal by a rectangular window. This is the same as a convolution in the frequency
domain. Since the rectangular window has a sin x/x function, the convolved signal is also of this form
and centered at the spectrum of the original signal. The sin x/x function has a series of spurious peaks
that decay very slowly. These spurious peaks (side lobes) introduce high-frequency components into
the original signal and those may create aliasing problems where there was none.
The effect of the leakage problem can be minimized by applying a window which has lower side
lobes and which is as close as possible to an impulse function. Ideally, this would require an infinite
length of data. In lieu of this, windows which have the following characteristics may be used:
1. Main lobe of the window is as narrow as possible.
2. Maximum side lobe is relatively small.
16.2 DATA REDUCTION
A prime consideration in the development of any real-time monitoring system is the response speed,
since it determines how soon corrective action can be taken. The response speed in turn depends on
the computational efficiency (how fast the appropriate calculations can be made). To improve the
computational efficiency, the data size or dimensionality may be reduced by eliminating the feature
components that convey the least information about the system. This stage of analysis is referred to as
data reduction or feature selection. Data reduction is used to reduce the initial size of the data to make
subsequent computations faster, with minimal loss of information.
Here, we consider two criteria for data reduction:
1. Variance criterion.
2. Fisher criterion.
16.2.1 Variance Criterion
The variance criterion involves eliminating the data components with the smallest eigenvalues of the
covariance matrix of the sampled data set, or the feature components with the smallest variances.
16.2.2 Fisher Criterion
The Fisher criterion enables the data size to be reduced by selecting the features that minimize scatter
of data within the individual classes, while at the same time increasing the scatter (or separation)
between the classes, as shown in Figure 16.6. It involves first determining the feature mean for each
class, yi:

where Mi is the number of patterns in class si. In this section and Section 16.3.1, the subscript i is
used to indicate the class of the system. yik ≡y is the kth pattern in class si.
The classes of interest in this case would normally include the signal sources, for example, good
weld, cracking, porosity, no weld, and any other defects of interest. All other unwanted signals can
then be grouped together and classified as noise.
The overall system mean, y, is then determined as:
y = ∑s
i=1

where pi is the a priori probability of class si.
The scatter within each class is obtained by calculating the covariance matrix Φyi as:

which leads to an overall system covariance matrix Φy of

The scatter Φys between the individual classes is defined as:
𝚽ys = ∑s
i=1
pi(yi − y)(yi − y)
′ (16.14)
and from this equation the feature selection criterion is defined as:
Q = 𝚽ys(j, j)

❦ ❦
❦
534 PROCESSING OF SENSOR OUTPUTS
where Φys(j, j) and Φy(j, j) are the jth diagonal elements of the covariance matrices Φys and Φy,
respectively.
Since the objective is to minimize the scatter within the individual classes, while maximizing the
scatter between the classes, the desired number of features with maximum Q values are selected
as features. The number of features used is very important, since in addition to the computational
efficiency, a high dimensionality requires a correspondingly large number of experimental data sets
for training the system and developing the classifier. This is because the adequate number of training
data sets has to be four or more times the number of features. However, an excessive number of
training sets adds to the cost without necessarily improving the system performance. On the other
hand, a small number of features may provide an insufficient description of the system.
Once the desired number of features is known, say n, the data sets can then be represented in an
n-dimensional feature space to show their relationship to each other. For ease of graphical repre￾sentation, however, two of the features may be plotted in a two-dimensional feature space (see, for
example, Figure 16.6).
Having reduced the data set to a manageable size without significant loss of information, the next
step is to identify the source of the data or assign it to a specific class. This step is referred to as
pattern classification and is discussed in Section 16.3.
16.3 PATTERN CLASSIFICATION
There are several techniques available for classifying different patterns, but due to space limitations,
our discussion focuses on two of the most common methods, pattern recognition and neural network
analysis.
16.3.1 Pattern Recognition
The discussion on pattern recognition starts with the classical Bayes decision theory, which is a
fundamental statistical approach to pattern classification.
16.3.1.1 Bayes Decision Theory The discussion on Bayes decision theory is approached using a
specific example. Let us consider a process which can be in one of s (s≥2) mutually exclusive states
or classes and is monitored at some regular intervals. For s =2, one of the states may be considered
to be in control, while the other is out of control. For example, in laser welding, let s1 indicate the
state that the process is in good condition, while s2 represents a defective weld. Further, let each
class or state of the process have an a priori probability pi (a priori probability of s1 is p1 and that
of s2 is p2), such that
p1 + p2 = 1 (16.16)
The a priori probability of a given state is obtained from previous knowledge of the likelihood
that the next observation will belong to that particular state.
Now let the process be monitored by measurement of n-dimensional vectors of observations of
an output, say the acoustic emission signal power spectrum, y. Since we cannot at any time predict
with certainty what the next observation will be, y is considered to be a random variable with a
distribution that depends on the state. Further, let the class-conditional probability density function
for y be p(y|si). This is the probability density function for the observation y given that the state is si
(Figure 16.7).
The problem that we are concerned with is to determine, for any observation, y, that is made,
which one of the s mutually exclusive states has generated y, that is, whether the observed y is from
a good weld or a defective weld. For this, we first take a look at the Bayes rule.❦

The Bayes rule expresses the a posteriori probability p(si|y) (Figure 16.8) in terms of the a priori
probability pi and the class-conditional probability density, p(y|si), that is,
p(si|y) = p(y|si)pi
p(y) (16.17)
where p(y) = ∑2
i=1 p(y|si)pi for the two-state example being considered.
16.3.1.2 Bayes Decision Rule for Minimum Error With the a posteriori probabilities determined
using the Bayes rule, they can now be used to classify an observed signal in such a way as to minimize
classification error. Now suppose that at some point in the welding process, a single Nm-dimensional
observation, X′ = [x1, x2, x3, … , xNm], is made of say an acoustic emission signal, which after
transformation and data reduction becomes y′ = [y1, y2, y3, … , yn]. Let us further suppose we are
interested in determining whether the signal is from a good weld (i) or a defective weld (ii), that is,
whether the observation belongs to s1 or s2. If the observation y is such that
p(s1|y) > p(s2|y) (16.18)
then we assign y to s1. This is the Bayes decision rule for minimizing the probability of error. The
probability of error associated with a decision is given by:
p(error|y) = {
p(s1|y) if y is assigned to s2
p(s2|y) if y is assigned to s1
(16.19)❦
❦ ❦
❦
536 PROCESSING OF SENSOR OUTPUTS
Using Eq. (16.17), the decision rule can also be expressed as:
p(y|s1)p1 > p(y|s2)p2 ⇒ y ∈ s1 (16.20a)
or
if p(y|s1)
p(y|s2)
> p2
p1
, then y ∈ s1 (16.20b)
p(y|si) is the likelihood of si with respect to y. And
LR = p(y|s1)
p(y|s2) (16.20c)
is the likelihood ratio. Thus, the Bayes minimum error decision rule decides s1 if the likelihood ratio
exceeds a threshold value, which is independent of y.
16.3.1.3 Discriminant Function Analysis The classification approach presented in the preceding
section can be taken one step further by noting that for a multi-class system, the decision rules may
be expressed as functions, discriminant functions, gi(y), with each class or state being associated
with one function:
gi(y), i = 1, 2,…,s (16.21)
The decision rule then becomes
y ∈ si if gi(y) > gj(y) for all j ≠ i (16.22)
This may be represented schematically as in Figure 16.6. For minimum error classification, the
discriminant function may be the a posteriori probability, p(si|y), that is,
gi(y) = p(si|y) (16.23)
Without loss of generality, we replace the function by the logarithm of the a posteriori probability,
giving
gi(y) = log p(si|y) = log[p(y|si)pi] or gi(y) = log p(y|si) + log pi (16.24)
The decision rule divides the feature space into decision regions, Ωi. Contiguous decision regions
are bounded by decision boundaries such that
gi(y) = gj(y) (16.25)
From Eqs. (16.20) and (16.24), it is evident that the probability density function is necessary
for classification. For simplicity, let us consider the case where the system being monitored has a
Gaussian distribution. Then

This is the general form of the discriminant function for a process with normal distribution.
For each sampled signal, the classifier calculates the value of each discriminant function, gi(y),
and assigns the signal to the class with the maximum discriminant function value (Figure 16.9).
16.3.1.4 Least-Squares Minimum Distance Classification Each data set (collectively, the
patterns) that is analyzed can be plotted in a feature space using the individual feature components
as coordinates. In the preceding classification schemes, it is assumed that the patterns in the
feature space are clustered around their respective means, yi. However, this is not generally the case.
Quite often, there is an overlap between the various classes. Thus with a basic linear decision-making
process, there can be a substantial amount of misclassification, where signals belonging to one
class are erroneously assigned to another. To facilitate clustering of the patterns around their
respective means, the patterns may be transformed from the feature space into a decision space.
The objective is to map patterns of each class si into or to cluster around a predetermined point, Qi,
i = 1, 2, … , s associated with that class.
Thus, for each class, si, a point, Qi, is defined in the decision space. An attempt is then made to
transform all patterns belonging to si to cluster around Qi. Since there is still the likelihood of some
misclassification even after this step, the transformation is made in such a way as to minimize the
decision-making errors that will subsequently result. The transformation matrix, T, is thus selected
on basis of the minimum mean square error criterion.
Let us indicate the n-dimensional data set for class si in the feature space as yij, j = 1, 2, … , Mi.
Mi is the number of data sets in class si. Further, let this data set be mapped into the predetermined❦

point Q′
i = [q1, q2, … , qs] in the decision space. Also, let the transformed point in the decision space
be indicated by zij:
zij = Tyij (16.28a)
Since zij will not necessarily be located exactly at Qi, there will generally be an error 𝜀ij, associated
with the transformation of each pattern or data yij. This is given by:
𝜀ij = zij − Qi = Tyij − Qi (16.28b)
The total mean square error, 𝜀i, associated with the transformation for class si is then
𝜀i = 1

The transformation matrix T obtained in this manner is an (s × n) matrix.
After transforming the signals into the decision space, appropriate discriminant functions can
be developed for classifying the signals. To facilitate representation of the discriminant function in
matrix form, the dimensionality of the pattern space is increased by 1 to (n+1) dimensions to account
for the threshold in the discriminant function. Thus, y becomes ⌢y, where ⌢y′ = [y1, y2,…, yn,−1].
In this form, the transformation matrix T is an (s × (n +1)) matrix.
Applying minimum distance classification to the patterns in the decision space, we determine the
distance of the transformed point, zij, from the preselected point, Qi, and assign zij to the class of
the Qi to which it is closest. Thus, we have for our discriminant function:
di
2 = ‖zij − Qi‖2 = ‖zij‖2 − 2Q′
i
zij + ‖Qi‖2 i = 1, 2,…,s (16.35)
The resulting classifier is then known as the least-squares minimum distance classifier. To simplify
the analysis, Qi can be chosen, without loss of generality, as unit vectors. Thus,
‖Qi‖2 = 1
and since zij is the same for all classes, the classification reduces to determining Q′
i
zij which is a
maximum when di
2 is minimum. The discriminant function then becomes
gi(y) = Q′
i
zij = Q′

and the class with the maximum discriminant function value is selected. As an illustration, for a

This gives the discriminant function:
gi(y) = 𝑤i1y1 + 𝑤i2y2 +···+ 𝑤inyn + 𝑤i0 i = 1, 2,…,s (16.38)
where wik is the weighting coefficient of the kth feature for class si and wi0 is the corresponding
threshold.
16.3.1.5 System Training To implement the classifier, it is necessary to determine the elements
of the transformation matrix T or the weighting coefficients wij of the discriminant function, which❦

540 PROCESSING OF SENSOR OUTPUTS
for the linear case, are given by Eq. (16.38). This requires training of the system. For that, data is
generated under carefully controlled conditions that produce signals belonging to a particular class
without any interference from signals of other classes. For example, if the application is such that
cracks can be detrimental to the product, then one may be interested in distinguishing between say,
a sound weld and one with cracks.
In training such a system, then it is essential to design experiments that will result in crack for￾mation, without any other discontinuities being formed. The data obtained from such an experiment
will then be used to define the discriminant function for the class associated with crack formation.
A similar set of experiments is then conducted for a sound weld, and the data obtained used to define
the discriminant function for the class related to sound welds. It has to be emphasized that such
training will have to be repeated for different conditions.
From this data, the mean, yi, and covariance matrix, Φyi, for each class are then obtained and
substituted in Eq. (16.27) or (16.34) to give the corresponding discriminant function for each class.
The pattern recognition system is essentially a single-level network. Further improvements in
classification may yet be obtained by using a multilayer network or a neural network. The neural
network concept is briefly discussed in Section 16.3.2.
16.3.2 Neural Network Analysis
Neural networks are based on a parallel processing architecture where the various processors or
nodes are interconnected. Conceptually, they are loosely structured along the basic functioning of the
brain and have three components: units (nodes or neurons), links (synapses), and layers (sequencing
of groups of neurons). Several neural network models have been developed in the literature. For this
discussion, we group them into two broad categories as follows:
1. Standard neural networks.
2. Deep learning networks.
16.3.2.1 Standard Neural Networks Standard neural networks normally have a feedforward
architecture where information flow is directional. Here, we discuss a basic model that is suitable for
manufacturing applications, with a simplified structure as illustrated in Figure 16.10. The network
generally has three or more sections – input layer, hidden layer(s), and output layer. The input
layer is the one with no links toward it, and the output layer has no links leading away from it.
The network also has the following characteristics:
1. A weight (or synaptic strength) q(m, n, k) for each link (synapse) (m, n) between two nodes:
m in layer k and n in layer k−1.
2. A residue or threshold r(m, k) for each node m in layer k.
3. A relationship, I(m, k) = f[q(m, n, k), O(n, k−1), r(m, k)], for each node m in layer k:
m, n = 0, 1, 2, 3, … k = 1, 2, 3, …
where I(m, k) is the input and O(m, k) is the output for each node m in layer k.
The information available in the network is contained in the magnitude of the links between the
nodes. In the general case, each node may be connected to every other node. However, for com￾putational efficiency, a simpler structure involving layers of nodes as illustrated in Figure 16.10 is
often used. In this case, each node of a hidden layer (layers other than the input and output lay￾ers) is connected to all nodes in the adjacent layers. It receives input from nodes of the preceding
layer, and its output becomes part input to each node of the succeeding layer. The performance of❦

the network depends on the nature of the process being modeled or monitored, the number of nodes
used, the number of layers, and the link weights or synaptic strengths, among other things.
If we denote the input to the mth node of the kth layer by I(m, k), and the output of that same node
by O(m, k), then the input I(m, k) is given as:
I(m, k) = ∑
n
[q(m, n, k) × O(n, k − 1)] + r(m, k) (16.39)
where q(m,n,k) is the synaptic strength of the link from node n in layer k−1 to node m in layer k and
r(m, k) is the residue or threshold of node m in layer k.
The inputs to the overall network are denoted as y(m) and the outputs as s(m).
The network is linear when the input to each node is also taken as its output. For a useful network
of this form, the input set has to be linearly independent, in which case the network is essentially
equivalent to a two-layer network, that is, it can be shown to reduce to a two-layer network. Thus, a
nonlinear relationship between the input and output of a node is essential for enhanced performance.
In the general case, the output O(m, k) of each node in layer k is a specific function f[I(m, k)] of
the node input I(m, k). A number of functions have been investigated that relate the input and output
of a node. One that has been found to be very effective is the monotonically increasing standard
sigmoid (or logistic) function:
O(m, k) = 1
1 + exp[−I(m, k)] (16.40)
This output serves as part input to each node of the (k+1)th layer, along with all other outputs of the
kth layer. This structure is characterized as a feedforward neural network, and signals can propagate
through the network only between adjacent layers, and only in the forward direction. From one
layer to another, the signals are modified by the link magnitudes. The basic structure of the network
thus consists of three stages, namely the input, hidden layers, and the output, and the input signal
propagates through the hidden layers in sequence, being modified at each stage, and finally coming
out as the output. The hidden layers process the input information in a way that simulates the system
of interest, thereby resulting in an output that is characteristic of the system input.
Network Architecture The simplest network structure would involve direct correspondence
between the inputs and outputs, in essence, a two-layer system. However, such simple systems are
not as effective as those incorporating hidden layers.❦

542 PROCESSING OF SENSOR OUTPUTS
The system performance is strongly influenced by the number of hidden layers and neurons that
make up the network. An appropriate number of neurons needs to be used for any given problem.
The network will not perform well during the learning stage if the number of neurons is not adequate.
In other words, a small number of neurons is unlikely to produce accurate results, and the learning
process may be unsuccessful. On the other hand, an unnecessarily large number of hidden layer
neurons may increase the number of iterations required to identify the synaptic strengths without
necessarily improving the performance. Under such circumstances, several different solutions may
be produced, which will make it difficult to come up with the correct generalization for any given
input. In other words, a network is less able to generalize for a given input training set as the number
of hidden neurons increases. This will cause failure during operation.
One of two methods is usually used in determining the optimal network architecture. In one case,
the design starts with a large topology. The system is first trained, and then neurons that do not
contribute significantly to the network are eliminated systematically, thereby reducing the network
size. A major drawback of this approach is that it is computationally wasteful. The second approach
involves starting with a small network and adding one neuron at a time until a solution is obtained.
It has a better chance of coming up with the smallest possible network for the task, if the proce￾dure is done right. The drawback is that the network has to be retrained whenever a new neuron is
added. The optimum solution is considered to have been achieved when the addition of a neuron
does not result in convergence of the solution. This second method is sometimes referred to as the
dynamic-node-creation method.
Network Training Determination of the synaptic strengths and activation thresholds (residue) to
enable the network perform the mapping of the inputs to the outputs requires training for a super￾vised network, which is the focus of our discussion. This is accomplished by exposing the system
to well-defined states of the process, that is, known outputs corresponding to known inputs. This is
repeated for various known input–output sets and the total resulting error determined. The synap￾tic strengths and activation thresholds are then modified, and the entire process repeated until an
error criterion is satisfied. Once the system is subjected to the learning process and the information
base established, it can be used for real-time application, even though the training itself is normally
off-line. This is essentially similar to the training discussed for the pattern recognition system.
Several methodologies have been developed for training multilayered neural networks. Probably
the most common one is the backpropagation method which we discuss in the next seven paragraphs.
Backpropagation is a form of supervised learning, and simply put, it involves searching for the
synaptic strength and residue values that minimize the error function given by Eq. (16.41). The gradi￾ent of the error with respect to each of the function parameters is calculated and appropriate changes
made to the parameters. This is iterated until it converges.
Random values are initially assigned to the link coefficients, q(m, n, k), and residues, r(m, k),
to define the network (typically in the range of +1 to −1). The weights must not start off with
equal values, since it is generally not possible to reach a configuration of unequal weights under
such circumstances. One set of inputs is then presented to the network and the outputs generated by
the network compared with the corresponding actual or desired outputs. Due to the randomness of
the initial network definition, the two sets of outputs will generally be different. The difference or
error of each output is then determined. This is repeated for all the input sets available for training.
The maximum sum of squares, 𝜀, of the resulting errors is then determined, namely,
𝜀 = Maxi=1, … ,Ni0
∑
M0
m=1
[R(m, i) − s(m, i)]
2 (16.41)
where R(m, i) is the actual or desired mth output of data set i, s(m, i) is the mth network output of
data set i, Ni0 is the number of input–output training sets available, and M0 is the number of outputs
available in a set.❦
❦ ❦
❦
PATTERN CLASSIFICATION 543
This error measure is compared with a predetermined error threshold, 𝜀th, which serves as a
convergence limit and if the measured error is less than the threshold, then the process is terminated.
Otherwise, the network link coefficients are recalculated or updated iteratively by backpropaga￾tion. In the backpropagation method, the link coefficients preceding each node are determined
as follows:
q(m, n, k)
{j+1} = q(m, n, k)
{j} + 𝛼q𝛽(m, k)O(n, k − 1) (16.42a)
r(m, k)
{j+1} = r(m, k)
{j} − 𝛼r𝛽(m, k) (16.42b)
where 𝛼i is the correction gain or learning rate which is positive and usually less than 1. 𝛽(m,k) is
the correction factor or error term for node m. The superscript j+1 indicates the next or updated link
coefficient, while j represents the current one.
The learning rate 𝛼i can significantly affect the performance of the network. Using a small value
for 𝛼i (typically between 0.05 and 0.25) ensures that a solution will be reached. However, that
requires a large number of iterations or epochs. The normal approach is to start with a small value
of 𝛼i and increase its value as learning proceeds. The higher value will increase the convergence
speed. On the other hand, if the value is too high, that may cause the algorithm to oscillate around
the minimum.
Convergence can be enhanced by adding a momentum term to smoothen weight changes:
q(m, n, k)
{j+1} = q(m, n, k)
{j} + 𝛼q𝛽(m, k)O(n, k − 1)
+ 𝛾q[q(m, n, k)
{j} − q (m, n, k) {j−1}
] 0 < 𝛾q < 1 (16.43)
The goal of the momentum term is to keep the weight changes moving in the same direction.
A typical value of the momentum parameter 𝛾q will be 0.9.
The correction factors are generally given by:
𝛽(m, k) = O(m, k)[1 − O(m, k)]∑
k
∑
h
q(h, m, k + 1)𝛽(h, k + 1) (16.44a)
where k is summed over all layers above the current layer and h is summed over all nodes in those
layers. Those for the last or output layer are given by:
𝛽(m) = s(m)[R(m) − s(m)][1 − s(m)] (16.44b)
Once the training is completed, that is, the maximum of the sum of squared errors converges to the
threshold error, 𝜀th, then the network is defined for the process in question such that for any process
input that is presented to the network, the output predicted by the network should correspond to the
actual process output. In a sense, the network is generalized such that it is not only useful for the
inputs for which it was trained but also useful for other process inputs. It must be noted, however,
that this does not mean the neural network can be used for a completely different process, but rather
for processes in the problem domain.
Required Training Sets To ensure adequate training, the network needs to be presented with a mini￾mum number of input training sets, Nmin, which can be approximately determined using the following
relation:
Nmin = Nh
N0
[
Nilog23 + N0 − log2
(Nh
e
)] (16.45)
where Nh is the number of hidden neurons, Ni is the number of inputs, and N0 is the number of
outputs. The equation is based on the assumption that the output neurons are binary.❦

16.3.2.2 Deep Learning Networks Deep learning networks were developed to address some of
the problems associated with standard neural networks, such as overfitting and generalization. In a
general sense, deep learning architectures consist of several layers, where each layer is a nonlinear
processing unit. When applied to neural networks, they enable more complex functions to be rep￾resented by increasing the number of layers and units. Just as for standard neural networks, several
architectures have been developed for deep learning networks. Here, we outline two of the most com￾mon such architectures, the restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) and deep belief network (DBN).
Restricted Boltzmann Machines The basic structure of the RBM architecture is illustrated in
Figure 16.11 and is such that the neurons (units) form a bipartite graph having a layer of visible
units and another layer of hidden units. There is full connection between units in the visible and
hidden layers. However, there is no connection between units of the same layer.
Training of an RBM starts with a random state in one layer. Gibbs sampling, which is a Monte
Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) technique, is then used to acquire samples from a posterior distri￾bution. Obtaining the states of units in one layer enables all the units in other layers to be updated.
The process starts at time 0 with a visible data vector (vi) which is used to update the hidden data
vector (hj) based on posterior distribution. Now using the hidden vector from time 0, the visible
vector is updated at time 1. This is repeated until equilibrium distribution is achieved.
Following that, the weights within the RBM can be determined using the maximum likelihood
criterion for the RBM. This involves obtaining the gradient of the training data log-probability to
update the weights as follows:
𝜕 log p(𝑣)
0
𝜕𝑤ij
= ⟨𝑣ihj⟩0 − ⟨𝑣ihj⟩
∞ (16.46)
where p is probability, wij is the weight or synaptic strength between visible unit i and hidden unit j,
⟨vihj⟩0 and ⟨vihj⟩∞ indicate the correlations for the visible (v) and hidden (h) units in their initial and
equilibrium layer states, respectively. However, training by this method is difficult due to the length
of time it takes to reach equilibrium, ⟨vihj⟩∞ and the high variance associated with it.
A general step of a faster algorithm that is commonly used, the contrastive divergence (CD) algo￾rithm, is outlined in Table 16.1. It replaces the equilibrium term, ⟨vihj⟩∞, with the first step in the
iteration ⟨vihj⟩1 without significant error.
RBMs have found application in a number of areas, including classification, dimensionality
reduction, feature learning, and modeling. As such, different versions of the technique have been
developed, including robust Boltzmann machines and temperature-based RBMs.
Deep Belief Network In its simplest form, the DBN consists of a number of RBMs which are
stacked together, as illustrated in Figure 16.12. It is evident from the figure that each pair of

contiguous layers constitutes an RBM, with the first two layers being nondirectional. DBNs are
highly suited for problems where the data is unlabeled.
Training starts with the lower RBMs and moves sequentially upward. When features are
eventually extracted by the top layers, they are propagated back to the lower layers. The training
is a two-stage process, starting with pretraining, followed by fine-tuning. Pretraining involves
unsupervised learning from the lower level to the upper level, resulting in feature extraction.
The initial weights that are obtained at this stage help improve the network performance, since
they are more structured, as opposed to the initial random weights that would otherwise be used.
Fine-tuning involves supervised learning that goes from top to bottom to refine the network
parameters. An algorithm for the DBN is outlined in Table 16.2.
DBNs have also found application in a number of areas such as image classification, and as a
result, different versions of the technique have been developed.❦

16.3.3 Sensor Fusion
Whereas most sensors may be suitable for monitoring specific states or detecting specific defects
associated with a process, no single sensor can reliably monitor all aspects of the process. Defects that
may not be detectable to one sensor under a given set of processing conditions may be detectable
to others. Thus by combining multiple sensors, the advantages of each sensor are pooled to form a
more reliable system. The drawback, however, is the cost and complexity of the multi-sensor system.
Sensor fusion techniques can be categorized into three broad groups:
1. Low-Level or Data Fusion: Here, the original data from the different sensors is combined
before features are extracted. This type of fusion is suitable for sensors which are identical
or whose output data are comparable or can be merged, for example, infrared and ultraviolet
output signals. The advantage with this approach is the minimum loss of information.
2. Medium-Level or Feature Fusion: With feature fusion, selected features may come from one or
more sensors. The data from each sensor is first transformed into the feature space. The features
from all the sensors are then concatenated into a single feature vector, before feature selec￾tion, and then classification. Since features that are orthogonal in one sensor set (due to the
orthogonality of the FFT) may not be orthogonal to features in another sensor set, the resulting
features may need to be processed by an orthogonal transform before pattern classification.
The advantage with this approach is that it permits fusion of data from sensors which are not
commensurate.
3. High-Level or Decision Fusion: This invokes a voting system, with the data from each sensor
being processed independently until a decision is made. The decisions from each sensor are
then weighted and then combined to give the overall results through voting.
Whenever possible, it is generally recommended that the lowest level of fusion possible should be
used, since it results in minimal loss of information. Hybrids or combinations of the different fusion
methods may also be used.
16.3.4 Time–Frequency Analysis
The Fourier transform, as defined in Section 16.1.1, requires knowledge of the signal over the infi￾nite range, that is, from −∞ to ∞. This mathematical expression only represents the real physical
situation for specific cases such as steady state or stationary signals. For transients, this represents❦
❦ ❦
❦
PATTERN CLASSIFICATION 547
a distortion of the physical situation, even though it is mathematically correct since the results of
the analysis are such that the signal vanishes outside its domain. Furthermore, it does not properly
represent localized information, for example, spikes and high-frequency bursts. Such anomalies
are addressed using time–frequency analysis, which is suitable for nonstationary signals since its
frequency characteristics evolve with time. It enables the frequency content of a signal to be obtained
locally in time (or at any “instant” in time).
Several techniques have been developed for time–frequency analysis. Perhaps the simplest one
is a direct extension of the regular Fourier transform, the STFT, also known as windowed Fourier
transform.
16.3.4.1 Short-Time Fourier Transform This technique involves taking the Fourier transform of
short segments or windows of the signal one after another and concatenating the resulting spectro￾grams. Application of the window is illustrated in Figure 16.13. In essence, well-localized slices of
the function are taken one at a time by sliding the window function along the time axis and taking
snapshots of the spectrograms. The result is a three-dimensional plot of the amplitude, frequency,
and time. Quite often a two-dimensional plot in the time–frequency domain (a phase space) is used,
with amplitude being represented by a gray scale or color coding.
The STFT of a signal f(t) can be expressed as:
STFT(𝜔, 𝜏) = ∫
∞
−∞
f(t)𝜔(t − 𝜏)e−i𝜔t
dt (16.47)
where 𝜔(t) is the window function and 𝜔(t−𝜏) gives the region around the time of interest 𝜏 over
which the spectrum is obtained.
The discrete form of the transform is given by:
STFT (𝜔, k) = ∑∞
j=−∞
x(j)𝜔(j − k)e−i𝜔j k is discrete (16.48)
The signal f(t) is suppressed by the window, 𝜔(t−𝜏) outside its domain, such that the Fourier
transform results in a local spectrum. Several forms of the window function have been devel￾oped. The simplest case is that of the rectangular window function. However, as we know from

548 PROCESSING OF SENSOR OUTPUTS
Section 16.1.6, the rectangular window introduces side lobes into the frequency domain, and that
can result in leakage. When a Gaussian window is used, then we have the Gabor transform:
Gf(𝜔, 𝜏) = ∫
∞
−∞
f(t)e−𝜋(t−𝜏)
2
e−i𝜔t
dt (16.49)
From Section 16.1.2, we know that the resolution of the STFT is determined by the width of
the window function. The wider the window, the better the frequency resolution. However, the time
resolution then deteriorates. On the other hand, a narrower window results in better time resolu￾tion and poorer frequency resolution. That is one drawback of the STFT technique. To address this
issue, other techniques have been developed for time–frequency analysis. The major ones include
wavelet transforms and time–frequency distributions. In the next section, we take a brief look at the
wavelet transform.
16.3.4.2 Wavelet Transforms The time and frequency resolution problem associated with the
STFT is overcome using wavelets, since it is possible to adapt the window length of wavelets to
the frequency. As a result, wavelets are able to track rapid variations in frequency. They are thus
capable of giving good time resolution for appropriate regions of the signal (high-frequency seg￾ments) and likewise, good frequency resolution for the low-frequency segments. A wavelet, 𝜓(t),
is essentially a family of functions known as the mother wavelet which is characterized by position
and frequency, and whose average value is zero:
∫
∞
−∞
𝜓(t)dt = 0 (16.50)
Associated with the mother wavelet are scaled and translated versions, often known as daughter
wavelets. In essence, wavelets segment data into different frequency components and analyze each
component with a resolution that is commensurate with its scale. The wavelet 𝜓(t) is expressed as:
𝜓(a,b)(t) = 1
√|a|
𝜓
(t − b
a
)
(16.51)
where a is a dilation or scale parameter, known as the scalogram, that governs the frequency or
width of the wavelet and b indicates the wavelet position. Thus, a variation in b implies a translation
in time.
The factor 1∕
√|a| ensures that all scaled functions have the same energy. The smaller the absolute
value of a, the higher the frequency content of the wavelet 𝜓.
A wavelet transform essentially represents a function by wavelets, and the transform of a function
f(t) with respect to wavelet 𝜓(t) is given by:
WF(a, b) = 1
√|a| ∫
∞
−∞
f(t)𝜓̃
(t − b

)
dt (16.52)
where 𝜓̃(t) is the complex conjugate of 𝜓(t).
The discrete wavelet transform (DWT) can be viewed simply as the wavelet transform of a sam￾pled sequence, xj = x(j𝛿𝜏), which for a unit sampling period, can be expressed as:
DWT [xj; a, b] = ∑

16.3.5 Applications in Manufacturing
The time–frequency technique that is used for a given manufacturing process depends on the process
characteristics. For processes such as lathe turning or welding (including laser) of a long prismatic
part, the STFT used with an appropriate window function should be adequate for process monitoring
since the processes are essentially stationary. On the other hand, for processes such as milling, some
sheet metal forming or bulk deformation operations, spot welding, or processes involving pulsed
laser beams, it will be more appropriate to use wavelet analysis or time–frequency distributions due
to the nonstationarity of the processes.❦

550 PROCESSING OF SENSOR OUTPUTS
16.4 SUMMARY
Sensor outputs usually have to be analyzed to extract relevant information about the processes that
they monitor. One approach is to classify the process output into different states, and this involves
three steps: sampling (digitizing), feature extraction, and classification.
Sampling requires certain precautions to avoid contaminating the signal. According to the sam￾pling theorem, the theoretical sampling rate has to be at least twice (in practice about 5–10 times)
the highest frequency in the signal. Aliasing results if the sampling rate is less. Frequencies above the
folding frequency are then folded back into the frequency range below the folding frequency. Using a
finite length of sampled data is equivalent to multiplying the signal by a rectangular window, which
introduces high-frequency side lobes into the signal, creating potential aliasing problems.
Feature extraction involves transformation of the signal, along with a reduction in the data size.
Among the common transforms are the Fourier, Walsh–Hadamard, Haar, and Karhunen–Loeve trans￾forms, with the Fourier transform being the most commonly used one. The discrete form of the
Fourier transform has several advantages over the analog transform: high signal-to-noise ratio; high
resolution; no drift; and greater flexibility in analysis. However, again certain precautions need to be
taken to get meaningful results.
Data reduction is used to reduce the initial data size to increase computation speed, with minimal
loss of information. Among the most common criteria used for data reduction are the variance crite￾rion (which eliminates the feature components with the smallest variances) and the Fisher criterion
(which selects the features that minimize scatter of data within individual classes, while increasing
the scatter between classes).
Two of the most common methods for distinguishing between different signal sources are pattern
recognition and neural network analysis. Bayes’ decision theory provides a fundamental basis to
pattern recognition. It expresses the a posteriori probability in terms of the a priori probability and
the class-conditional probability density. The decision can be based on minimum error or minimum
risk. The resulting decision rules can be expressed as discriminant functions.
Neural networks represent the classifier by nodes which are interconnected, with information
available in the network being contained in the magnitude of the links between the processors. Deep
learning networks were introduced to overcome some of the problems associated with traditional
networks, and two of the most common architectures, RBMs and DBNs are outlined. Each classifier
needs to be trained to determine the coefficients and thresholds of discriminant functions, or the link
magnitudes of neural networks before being used to monitor the process.
Since the traditional Fourier transform is unable to extract information on the time variation of a
signal, it is mainly suitable for stationary processes. For nonstationary processes, it is necessary to
use time–frequency methods. The simplest one is the STFT, which is essentially an extension of the
traditional Fourier transform. Here, a series of transforms are obtained by sliding a window along
the time domain. However, the frequency resolution tends to be poor when the time domain window
is short. The use of wavelets and time–frequency distributions enable high-frequency resolutions to
be obtained over short time periods, and vice versa.

17 Laser Safety
Lasers, like most other equipment used in processing materials, require caution for safe and effective
utilization. In this chapter, the characteristics of the basic laser hazards that need to be understood for
safe use of lasers are outlined, focusing on their application in materials processing. The discussion
starts with the hazards associated with lasers. This is followed by the principal classification of lasers.
Finally, the basic steps that need to be taken to prevent laser accidents are presented.
17.1 LASER HAZARDS
There are two principal forms of hazard associated with lasers:
1. Radiation-related hazards.
2. Nonbeam hazards.
17.1.1 Radiation-Related Hazards
Assessment of the radiation-related hazards associated with a laser or laser system is normally based
on three primary issues:
1. The capacity of the laser and its ability to cause injury.
2. The environment in which the laser is to be used.
3. The personnel who will be associated with the laser (using or being exposed to it).
The damaging effects of a laser beam result primarily from:
1. Its highly collimated nature which enables it to be focused to very small sizes.
2. Its monochromaticity that can result in selective interactions with human tissue.
Since different wavelengths interact differently with tissue, the type of injury that results normally
depends on the type of laser being used. Injuries that result from radiation-related hazards are primar￾ily to the human skin and eye, and given the same conditions, the seriousness of the injury depends
on where it occurs. Whereas a burn on the hand may leave a permanent scar, an equivalent damage
to the eye may cause blindness. The primary factors that determine the extent of damage sustained
are as follows:
1. Beam power density.

2. Beam wavelength.
3. Irradiated area and its absorption characteristics.
4. Duration of exposure.
17.1.1.1 Mechanisms of Laser Damage To understand how damage may be caused, the principal
mechanisms responsible for laser damage to human tissue are briefly outlined. These are as follows:
1. Photothermal effects.
2. Photochemical effects.
3. Photoacoustic effects.
Photothermal Effects With this mechanism, the radiation absorbed by the tissue increases the tis￾sue’s temperature until damage or a laser burn occurs. The process depends more on the rate at which
incident energy is absorbed, that is, the power, rather than the total amount of energy absorbed.
Thus, injuries that immediately follow exposure are more likely to be due to photothermal effects.
Even though most cells can survive temperatures as high as 45 ∘C, cells begin to die at temperatures
of 60 ∘C, and tissue evaporation would normally occur at about 350 ∘C. Photothermal effects can
thus result in immediate and permanent damage to body tissue (skin or eye).
Photochemical Effects Photochemical effects depend more on the total amount of energy absorbed
by the tissue rather than on the rate at which it is absorbed. Its effect is thus cumulative. Thus,
even though the power levels may not be sufficient to cause thermal damage, over long periods of
exposure, the effect can be damaging. The mechanism involves changes in the chemical structure of
the underlying tissue. For example, the creation of a skin tan by absorption of ultraviolet radiation
from the sun is photochemical in nature. Even though such photochemical effects may be reversible
once absorption of the radiation is stopped, cumulative effects may result in longer-term damage.
As a result of this being an energy-dependent process, the photon energy plays a significant role.
And since the photon energy increases with decreasing wavelength, ultraviolet beams are more dam￾aging than visible radiation, even though visible radiation can affect sensitive tissue such as the retina
of the eye as a result of prolonged exposure. Infrared radiation generally does not cause damage by
the photochemical mechanism because of the low photon energy.
Photoacoustic Effects Photoacoustic effects are generally associated with ultrashort duration
pulses (typically less than 10 μs) of high energy which cause rapid expansion of the tissue on which
they are incident. This generates an acoustic shock wave in the tissue that may cause mechanical
disruption of cellular structures. This process is energy-dependent.
The major forms of radiation-related hazards, eye and skin hazards, are now discussed.
17.1.1.2 Major Hazards
Eye Hazards For effective protection of the eye against laser hazards, it is necessary to have a basic
understanding of the eye structure and how it interacts with incident radiation. Figure 17.1 shows
the basic components of the eye. Light (radiation) enters the eye through the cornea, passes through
the pupil which is the opening within the iris, and is focused on the retina by the lens, which has an
effective focal length of 17 mm. The diameter of the pupil can be as small as 2 mm and as large as
7 mm. Under normal circumstances, since light enters the eye from several different directions, an
image is formed over the entire retina (Figure 17.2a). Thus, the power density of the light incident
on the retina is relatively low. However, when a collimated beam is incident on the lens, it is focused
onto a small spot (Figure 17.2b) of diameter about 20 μm on the retina. This results in a magnification❦

of the light intensity of about 105 on the retina. Thus, radiation which might appear to be of relatively
low intensity on the outside could cause significant damage on the retina.
Figure 17.3 summarizes the absorption characteristics of the different components of the eye.
All radiation in the wavelength range below 0.3 μm (ultraviolet) and above 3 μm (far infrared) is
absorbed by the cornea. Radiation that falls between 0.3 and 0.4 μm (near-ultraviolet) and also
between 1.4 and 3 μm (mid-infrared) is absorbed by the lens. The remaining wavelength range
between 0.4 and 1.4 μm is focused on the retina. This wavelength range is known as the ocular
focus or retinal hazard region. It must be noted that part of the radiation in this range (0.4–0.7 μm)
is visible, while that in the infrared region (0.7–1.4 μm) is not visible.
Any damage that is restricted to the surface layer (up to 50 μm depth) of the cornea tends to
heal in about 48 hours since the tissue in this region regenerates itself rather easily. However, if
the deeper layers of the cornea are damaged, these are likely to result in scarring and the cornea❦

becoming permanently opaque. Damage to the lens may cause cataract (the lens becoming opaque).
Photochemical damage may result in changes to night and color vision if the retina is subjected
to long-term exposure at radiation levels that may not cause immediate injury. More severe damage to
the eye includes the formation of a blind spot, distortion of vision, loss of high-resolution capability
in the eye, and partial or total blindness.
Skin Hazards The extent to which different wavelengths of radiation penetrate the human skin
is illustrated schematically in Figure 17.4. It is evident from this figure that the radiation in the
visible wavelength regime results in the highest penetration. Ultraviolet and far-infrared radiation
are mainly absorbed in the outer protective layer of dead cells. Damage to the skin includes sun burn
and tanning (due to photochemical reaction resulting from ultraviolet radiation), inflammation due
to dilation of blood capillaries and a localized laser burn (due to a photothermal action resulting
from a high intense beam), premature aging and skin cancer (from prolonged exposure), and tissue
cutting due to ablation.
17.1.2 Nonbeam Hazards
In addition to the hazards associated with the beam itself as outlined earlier, other forms of hazards
are associated with the overall laser system and environment, for which appropriate precautions are
necessary. Such hazards can be life threatening and include

6. Other hazards.
We shall elaborate on some of these hazards, and the reader is referred to the American National
Standards Institute (ANSI) Standards Z136.1-2007 or the International Electrotechnical Commission
(IEC) Standards for further details.
17.1.2.1 Electrical Hazards A number of lasers need very high voltages for exciting the active
medium, and this is especially the case for the high-power lasers. Electric shock can result from
contact with voltages exceeding 50 volts. Such contacts usually occur when equipment protective
covers are removed, for example during laser setup, installation, maintenance, service, etc. Capacitor
banks that can store significant electric charge are often used in pulsed lasers. Deaths have occurred
in connection with laser systems as a result of electric shock. The major sources of problems are as
follows:
1. Uncovered electrical terminals.
2. Improperly insulated electrical terminals.
3. Improperly displayed power on warning lights.
4. Improperly grounded equipment.
Other problem sources are inadequate first-aid training, nonadherence to standards, and wires or
cables on floor, creating slip hazards.
17.1.2.2 Chemical Hazards Some materials used in connection with lasers may be toxic
and carcinogenic. These include some laser gases, especially those used with some excimer lasers,
and some laser dyes.❦
❦ ❦
❦
562 LASER SAFETY
17.1.2.3 Environmental Hazards Interaction of some lasers (especially the high-power ones)
with matter may generate air contaminants such as fumes, dust, and vapors which may be toxic and/or
noxious. The materials may be plastics, composites, metals, or tissue. Certain materials used for laser
windows may also generate hazardous substances when a threshold beam intensity is exceeded.
The impact of such contaminants can be significantly reduced by using
1. Proper exhaust ventilation.
2. Respiratory protection.
3. Process isolation.
For exhaust ventilation, it is preferable to use hoods whenever possible since they are more effec￾tive. Respiratory protection is normally used as a temporary measure. Process isolation involves
isolating the system using physical barriers or using remote control.
17.1.2.4 Fire Hazards This is especially important for Class 4 lasers (Section 17.2). Acciden￾tal exposure of combustible material to high-power beams (exceeding 0.5 W) can cause ignition
(author’s personal experience in the laboratory), with the risk of starting a fire. Care should therefore
be taken to avoid placing combustible materials in the beam path. For enclosure of the work area,
flame-retardant materials should be used, whenever possible.
17.1.2.5 Explosion Hazards and Compressed Gases Some components of the laser system can
be explosive if they eventually disintegrate. These include high-pressure arc lamps, capacitor banks,
and some chemicals that may be used. In addition, proper precautions must be taken to ensure that
the compressed gases used in a number of laser systems do not pose a health risk. Gas tanks must
be properly secured, and not left free-standing. Hazardous gases must be appropriately labeled.
17.1.2.6 Other Hazards Other hazards associated with laser systems include mechanical haz￾ards involving rotating machinery, and the use of robots, noise, ergonomics issues associated with
handling workpieces and other laser components, and generation of other forms of radiation by
system components.
In the next section, we outline the various classes of lasers. This, to a large extent, determines the
precautions that need to be taken to avoid injury in using lasers.
17.2 LASER CLASSIFICATION
The classification of a laser is based primarily on the ability of the main or reflected beam to cause
injury to the eye or skin, and that depends on the level of accessible emission for that laser. For a laser
in a given class, the output of that laser must not exceed the accessible emission limit (AEL) for that
class. The AEL is the maximum accessible emission level permitted within a particular class. In this
section, we provide a brief outline of the major classes of lasers. The interested reader is referred to
the ANSI Z136.1-2007 document on the “Safe Use of Lasers,” for further details.
There are four major laser classes:
Class 1: The radiation levels produced by Class 1 lasers are not considered high enough to cause
any form of injury either during operation or maintenance. Thus, no special precautions are
necessary. An example is the laser in an audio compact disk player.❦
❦ ❦
❦
PREVENTING LASER ACCIDENTS 563
Class 2: These are low-power lasers and are further subdivided into 2 and 2M. The radiation
from Class 2 lasers in general fall within the visible spectrum. Since the radiation is visible
and of low power, natural reflexes such as blinking (with a response time of about 0.2 seconds)
are considered adequate in protecting the eye against injury. However, damage may occur if
one deliberately stares into the beam.
Class 3: These are medium-power lasers and are also further subdivided into 3R and 3B. This
type of laser is not a skin hazard, but definitely an eye hazard. Direct and specularly reflected
Class 3 beams can cause eye injury in a time period shorter than what it takes for the eye to
blink, even though the diffusely reflected beam is not normally hazardous. It also does not
pose a fire hazard.
Class 4: With the high-power inherent in this class of lasers, they can be a hazard to the eye and
skin, as well as pose a fire hazard. There is not upper power limit to this class of lasers.
17.3 PREVENTING LASER ACCIDENTS
In this section, we outline some of the major steps that need to be taken to prevent or at least minimize
the occurrence of laser accidents. A more detailed description of control measures and precautions
that need to be taken are provided by the ANSI standard. The major issues that we shall touch on
are as follows:
1. Laser safety officer (LSO).
2. Engineering controls.
3. Administrative and procedural controls.
4. Protective equipment.
5. Warning signs and labels.
17.3.1 Laser Safety Officer (LSO)
A LSO is someone who is given the responsibility and authority for ensuring safety in connection
with the laser system. The appointment of an LSO is especially important for Class 3 and Class 4
laser installations. The LSO’s responsibilities include all the control measures that are necessary for
ensuring safe use of the laser as specified in the ANSI Standard Z136.1-2007, and summarized in
Sections 17.3.2–17.3.5.
17.3.2 Engineering Controls
Engineering controls that are necessary for ensuring the safe use of lasers include the provision
of protective housings, interlocks, key control, beam path enclosure, remote interlock connector,
emergency stop button, laser activation warning systems, area control, equipment labels, and area
sign posting.
Protective housing is normally provided by the equipment manufacturer. However, in situations
where it may be necessary to use the laser without protective housing, such as in research and devel￾opment, it will be necessary to provide such controls as access restriction and other safety measures.
It is also necessary to provide protective housings with interlock systems which are activated to
interrupt the beam, for example, when the protective housing is opened during operation or main￾tenance. Enclosure of the laser equipment and beam path is one of the most important steps for
minimizing hazards.❦

564 LASER SAFETY
The provision of a master switch with a key or coded access is necessary for Class 3B or 4
lasers, and in addition, a permanently attached emergency stop button should be provided. Laser
activation warning systems such as an alarm or warning light that indicate activation of high voltage
and radiation emission are also necessary. It is preferable to have such warnings activated before the
emission of laser radiation.
It is also necessary to enclose the beam path. Where this is not completely possible, the LSO
will establish a nominal hazard zone (NHZ), unless this is already provided by the laser manufac￾turer. A NHZ describes the space within which the level of the direct, reflected, or scattered radiation
during operation exceeds the applicable maximum permissible exposure (MPE). A MPE, as shown
in Tables 17.1 and 17.2, is the level of radiation to which a person may be exposed without haz￾ardous effect or adverse biological changes in the eye or skin. Under such circumstances, the work
area should be designated as a laser-controlled area with restricted access which is limited only to
necessary personnel. A remote interlock connector which terminates laser emission when opened is
then necessary for Class 3B and 4 lasers. Such a system is illustrated in Figure 17.5. It may also be
designed with an interlock-override capability so that appropriate personnel can enter and leave the
facility without necessarily interrupting the laser operation.
17.3.3 Administrative and Procedural Controls
Administrative and procedural controls specify rules and/or work practices that implement engi￾neering controls. These include standard operating procedures which are maintained with the laser
equipment for reference by the operator, maintenance, or service personnel. They also include spec￾ifying limitations on output radiation emission, education and training, specification of authorized
personnel (operators, maintenance, and service personnel), alignment procedures, specification of
protective equipment, and control of spectators.
17.3.4 Protective Equipment
The most important piece of protective equipment necessary for minimizing laser hazards is protec￾tive eyewear. Others include windows, barriers, curtains, and skin protective devices.
17.3.4.1 Protective Eyewear Eye protection is essential when personnel are either working with
or are in the NHZ of Class 3B or 4 lasers that are operating. Its main purpose is to reduce any
possible exposure to safe levels (no more than the MPE), while at the same time permitting enough
radiation to be transmitted across the visible spectrum such that visual performance is not unduly
degraded. Thus, the transmittance of the filter at the laser wavelength should not exceed 𝜏𝜆max, which
is given by:
𝜏𝜆max = MPE
maximum possible exposure (17.1)
Protective devices that can be used include goggles, face shields, and spectacles or prescrip￾tion eyewear using special filter materials or reflective coatings. Such protective eyewear should
withstand either direct or diffusely scattered beams. Important factors that need to be considered in
selecting protective eyewear are as follows:
1. Wavelength(s) of laser output.
2. Potential for multiwavelength operation.
3. Radiant exposure or intensity level.
4. Potential exposure time.
5. MPE.
6. Optical density (OD) requirement of eyewear filter at laser output wavelength.❦

The optical density, OD𝜆, is the factor by which incident radiation at a specific wavelength would
be attenuated and is given by:
OD𝜆 = log10
Ip
MPE = −log10𝜏𝜆 (17.2)
where Ip is the highest level of intensity (power per unit area) to which the eye could be exposed and
is given by the beam power over the limiting aperture (which is 7 mm for the 0.4 to 1.4 μm region)
(W/cm2), MPE is the maximum permissible exposure (W/cm2), and 𝜏𝜆 is the transmittance of the
filter at a given wavelength.
Ip and MPE have to be in the same units. The value of OD𝜆 that is calculated from Eq. (17.2) is
rounded up to the next whole number. For a given potential laser output, the MPE for that wavelength
has to be determined. Then, from Eq. (17.2), the OD which will indicate the type of protective
eyewear to be used can be calculated. For example, if the laser exposure is 105 times greater than the
MPE, then an eyewear with an OD of at least 5 would be needed.❦

Table 17.3 shows the relationship between the OD, transmittance, etc., at a given wavelength and
indicates, for a calculated OD for that wavelength, the percentage of the beam that will be transmitted,
or attenuated, or the level of protection to be expected.
For ease of reference, ODs necessary for various laser outputs are summarized in Table 17.4.
For completeness, the MPE for both eye and skin exposure are provided in Tables 17.1 and 17.2,
respectively. It must be noted that the MPE value used depends on the duration of exposure to
the beam.
17.3.4.2 Other Protective Equipment Other protective equipment include laser protective win￾dows, barriers and curtains, and skin protection clothing such as gloves or even “sunscreen” creams.

Solution:
Wavelength of the Nd:YAG laser is 1.06 μm.
From Table 17.1, the MPE for long-term exposure for this wavelength is 5.0 Cc × 10−3 W/cm2.
From Table 17.5 (Table 6 of ANSI Standards Z136.1-2007), Cc = 1.0 for the 1.06 μm wavelength.
Thus, MPE = 5.0 × 10−3 W/cm2.

SUMMARY 569
Using a limiting aperture of 7 mm = 0.7 cm, the highest level of intensity to which the eye could
be exposed, Ip, is given by:
Ip = 3000
𝜋0.72∕4 = 7794 W∕cm2
Therefore,
OD𝜆 = log10
Ip
MPE = log10
7794
5.0 × 10−3 = −log10(1.56 × 106) = 6.19
which gives a final rounded-up OD of 7. This compares with a value of 8 to be read directly from
Table 17.4. Correction factors used in various tables are listed in Table 17.5.
17.3.5 Warning Signs and Labels
Another effective means of preventing accidents involves the use of warning signs and labels on the
lasers. These inform anyone that uses the laser about the type of hazard associated with it. Such signs
may also be placed at the entrance to the NHZ of the laser. The design of signs in terms of dimen￾sions, color, letter size, and so on are specified in the American National Standard Specification for
Accident Prevention Signs, ANSI Z535. The ANSI standards for signs used to denote Class 2, 3,
and 4 lasers are shown in Figure 17.6. For Class 2 lasers, the word “Caution” is used with all signs
and labels, while for 3B and 4 lasers, the word “Danger” is used. The International Standard is based
on the symbol as shown in Figure 17.7 (IEC Publication 825). Additional wording that is required,
depending on the type of laser is as follows:
Class 2: “Laser Radiation - Do Not Stare into Beam.”
Class 2M and Some 3R: “Laser Radiation - Do Not Stare into Beam or View Directly with
Optical Instruments.
Class 3R (others): “Laser Radiation - Avoid Direct Eye Exposure.”
Class 3B: “Laser Radiation - Avoid Direct Exposure to Beam.”
Class 4: “Laser Radiation - Avoid Eye or Skin Exposure to Direct or Scattered Radiation.”
Other pertinent information to be provided on the sign includes
Position 1: Invisible Laser Radiation, Knock Before Entering, Do Not Enter When Light is On,
Restricted Area, etc.
Position 2: Type of laser, emitted wavelength, pulse duration, maximum output.
Position 3: Class of the laser.
17.4 SUMMARY
Lasers need to be used with caution for safety, since improper usage can cause serious injury. Injuries
associated directly with the laser beam generally occur with respect to the human skin and eye.
The damage that is sustained depends on the power density, wavelength, the irradiated area and its
absorption characteristics, and the exposure duration.
Damage to human tissue may result from photothermal, photochemical, or photoacoustic effects.
With regard to the eye, focusing of a collimated beam on the retina results in magnification of the
light intensity by a factor of about 105. Thus relatively low-intensity radiation can cause significant❦

damage to the retina. This is especially so for radiation in the visible and near-infrared regions.
Damage to the surface layer of the cornea tends to heal in about 48 hours. However, damage to
deeper layers of the cornea can result in scarring and the cornea becoming permanently opaque.
Damage to the lens may cause cataract. More severe damage to the eye includes the formation of a
blind spot, distortion of vision, loss of high-resolution capability in the eye, and partial blindness.
With regard to the skin, radiation in the visible wavelength regime results in the highest penetration.
Ultraviolet and far-infrared radiation are mainly absorbed in the outer protective layer of dead cells.
Damage to the skin includes sun burn and tanning, inflammation due to dilation of blood capillaries,
premature aging, and skin cancer.
There are other hazards that do not directly involve the beam, and these are associated with
electrical, chemical, environmental, fire, explosion, and compressed gas sources.
There are four major laser classes. For each class, the laser output must not exceed the AEL for
that class. Details are provided in the ANSI Standard Z136.1-2007. The four classes are as follows:
Class 1: Radiation levels for this class of lasers are not high enough to cause any form of injury,
for example, the laser in a compact disk player.
Class 2: These are low-power lasers, fall within the visible spectrum, and thus natural reflexes
such as blinking are adequate in protecting the eye against injury. However, damage may
occur if one deliberately stares into the beam.
Class 3: These are medium-power lasers, and even though not a skin hazard, are definitely an
eye hazard. They also do not pose a fire hazard.
Class 4: With the high-power inherent in this class of lasers, they can be a hazard to the eye and
skin, as well as pose a fire hazard. There is no upper power limit to this class of lasers.
To ensure that appropriate steps are taken to minimize laser accidents, it is necessary to have
1. A Laser Safety Officer: who ensures safety in connection with the laser system.
2. Engineering Controls: which include the provision of protective housings, interlocks, beam
path enclosure, emergency stop button, laser activation warning systems, area sign posting,
etc.
3. Administrative and Procedural Controls: which specify rules and/or work practices that imple￾ment engineering controls.
4. Protective Equipment: which include protective eyewear.
5. Warning Signs and Labels: which inform anyone that uses the laser about the type of hazard
associated with it.
